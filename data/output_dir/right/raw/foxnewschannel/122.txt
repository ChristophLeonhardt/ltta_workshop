ARE WE ALLOWED TO MENTION

PRESIDENT TRUMP.

136
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:06,769
HE IS DOMINATING THESE PEOPLE.

137
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,970
HE IS FRUSTRATING THEM.

138
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:09,805

SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION ANYMORE VIA

143
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:18,981
FRUSTRATED AS THEY CAN BE ABOUT

144
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:19,281
THAT.

145
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:20,815
>> Sean: HE DOESN'T NEED THAT.

146
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:21,584
>> Rush: KNOW.

147
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,119
PART OF WHAT IS GOING ON HERE, I

148
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,755
BELIEVE, ALL OF THIS -- I DO

149
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:26,288
CALL IT ABNORMALITY.

150
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:29,792
WE ARE UP AGAINST PSYCHOLOGICAL

151
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:31,227
DISORDER, ABNORMALITY, THAT IS

152
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,362
DISGUISED AS POLITICAL ISSUES.

153
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:34,730
>> Sean: WE TALK ABOUT THE

154
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:37,166
MEDIA -- IT HAS NEVER BEEN THIS

155
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:37,666
ABUSIVELY BIASED.

156
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,535
>> Rush: IT IS NOT EVEN

157
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,270
BIASED, WE ARE SO FAR BEYOND

158
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:41,604
BIASED.

159
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:43,305
THESE PEOPLE ARE PART OF THE

160
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:43,639
AGENDA.

161
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,541
I THINK THEY RUN IT.

162
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,109
I THINK THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

163
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,646
ORCHESTRATED, RUN IT, EVEN GIVE

164
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:51,380
MARCHING ORDERS TO EACH OTHER.

165
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:55,951
THE POINT IS, TRUMP HAS THEM

166
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:56,352
BAMBOOZLED.

167
00:04:56,353 --> 00:04:57,486
I THINK PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT

168
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:58,554
THEY ARE DOING IS TRYING TO

169
00:04:58,555 --> 00:04:59,855
DEMONSTRATE TO THEMSELVES THEY

170
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:01,123
STILL HAVE THE POWER TO SHAPE

171
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,958
PUBLIC OPINION VIA NARRATIVE.

172
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,560
IT IS CAUSING ALL OF THESE

173
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:05,294
PEOPLE IN THE LEFT TO GET MORE

174
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,530
AND MORE AND MORE EXTREME.

175
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:09,965
I AM JUST RELYING ON THE FACT

176
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:10,966
THAT AVERAGE, ORDINARY

177
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:11,700
AMERICANS, LIKE YOU AND I ARE,

178
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:15,971
ARE IS REPULSED AS YOU AND I ARE

179
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:17,406
BY THIS BEHAVIOR THAT THEY ARE

180
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,542
ENGAGING IN, THE DEMANDS THEY

181
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:22,378
ARE MAKING ON DECENT,

182
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:23,212
GOD-FEARING, AMERICA-LOVING

183
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:23,546
PEOPLE.

184
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,714
WE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.

185
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:27,683
AND YET WE ARE PORTRAYED AS THE

186
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:28,150
PROBLEM.

187
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,152
WHERE THE ENEMY TO THESE PEOPLE.

188
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,220
IT IS REALLY SCARY.

189
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,221
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE LOSE, GO

190
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:34,323
BACK AND LOOK -- IF WE LOSE

191
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:36,592
2016, IF THEY GET THE HOUSE, I'M

192
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,360
JUST GOING TO TELL YOU, WHATEVER

193
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:39,628
TRUMP WANTS TO DO IS GOING TO

194
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:39,995
STOP.

195
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:40,963
IT IS GOING TO BE PARALYZED.

196
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,965
IT IS GOING TO BE NOTHING BUT IN

197
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:46,969
EVERY HOUSE COMMITTEE THAT IS

198
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,404
RELEVANT, INSPECTIONS,

199
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:49,038
INVESTIGATIONS, SUBPOENAS.

200
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,573
THEY ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND

201
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:51,373
TRY TO GET KAVANAUGH THROWN OUT.

202
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:53,742
IT IS GOING TO BE NOTHING BUT

203
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:55,578
TWO YEARS TO GET EVEN WITH TRUMP

204
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,279
FOR HAVING THE AUDACITY TO WIN.

205
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,848
AND THE BUSINESS OF THE NATION

206
00:05:58,849 --> 00:05:59,982
IS GOING TO BE BROUGHT TO A

207
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:00,749
SCREECHING HALT.

208
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,484
IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ARE GOING

209
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:03,786
TO TRY TO GET RID OF THE TAX

210
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:04,186
CUTS.

211
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:05,421
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SUCCEED AT

212
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:06,222
ANY OF THIS BECAUSE THE SUN IT

213
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:08,724
IS GOING TO BE IN THE HANDS OF

214
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:09,992
MITCH McCONNELL, I ESPECIALLY

215
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:12,495
HIM COLONEL.

216
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:14,997
HE MOVES SO SLOW, BUT HE IS

217
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:16,499
SPEEDING UP.

218
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,705
>> Sean: HAD A GOOD RUN.

219
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,807
>> Rush: I STILL THINK

220
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:26,775
TRUMP -- THAT IS AND WHOM I HAVE

221
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,377
COME IN TERMS OF THE POLITICS OF

222
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:30,546
THIS, I STILL HAVE HIT IMPLICIT

223
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:30,946
TRUST.

224
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,315
I THINK TRUMP KNOWS WHAT HE IS

225
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:33,649
DOING.

226
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,384
>> Sean: WE HAVE PUT ALL OF

227
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,386
THE SUCCESS IN TWO YEARS.

228
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:38,153
OBAMA, ECONOMICALLY, THE FIRST

229
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:41,524
PRESIDENT THAT NEVER MET 3% OF

230
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:42,358
GDP GROWTH IN HISTORY.

231
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,059
>> Rush: THIS IS THE KEY.

232
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,495
AMERICA DOESN'T DESERVE THAT.

233
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:49,265
AMERICA IS SO OPPRESSIVE, SO

234
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:49,865
MEAN TO MINORITIES.

235
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:52,401
AMERICA DOESN'T DESERVE SUPER

236
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:52,835
POWER STATUS.

237
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:53,836
THIS IS WHY I WANTED OBAMA TO

238
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:54,670
FAIL.

239
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:58,307
IN HIS VIEW, IN THE AMERICAN

240
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,342
LEFT'S VIEW, AMERICA IS THE

241
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:00,910
PROBLEM IN THE WORLD.

242
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:06,315
AMERICA DOESN'T DESERVE --

243
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:09,151
>> Sean: APOLOGIES.

244
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,420
13 MILLION FOOD STAMPS, AND

245
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:11,754
POVERTY.

246
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:13,856
>> Rush: MORE PEOPLE VOTING

247
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:14,523
DEMOCRAT, MORE DEPENDING ON

248
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:15,858
GOVERNMENT CARE THEY WANT THAT,

249
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:16,158
SEAN.

250
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:19,194
>> Sean: WE HAVE 14 STATES,

251
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:19,962
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

252
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:22,464
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT SENSE '69,

253
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:23,799
1 MILLION MORE DON'T KNOW MY

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,935
JOBS THAN PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT

255
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:26,969
PAIRED LOOK AT WHO IS

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,369
BENEFITING.

257
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,337
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ON EMPLOYMENT,

258
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:28,904
LOWEST EVER.

259
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:31,607
HISPANIC ON APPOINTMENT, ASIAN

261
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:33,676
WORKPLACE UNEMPLOYMENT PAIRED

262
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,412
ALL OF THE SUCCESS, YOU ARE

263
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:37,846
SAYING, STOPS IF THEY GET THE

264
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:38,147
HOUSE.

265
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:40,149
>> Rush: LET ME ASK YOU A

266
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,616
CIVIL QUESTION.

267
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:40,883
WHY?

268
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:42,718
YOU HEARD HIM GO THROUGH THESE

269
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:44,553
STATISTICS.

270
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:45,955
THE FACTS OF THE ECONOMIC

271
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:46,355
ADVANCEMENT.

272
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:50,159
WE HAVE MORE JOBS THAN THERE ARE

273
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,859
JOB OPENINGS.

274
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,963
A MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THERE

275
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:54,964
ARE OPENINGS.

276
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:56,565
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE 2017.

277
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:58,534
WHO WAS PRESENT THEN?

278
00:07:58,535 --> 00:07:59,001
IT WASN'T OBAMA.

279
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:02,972
THE THINGS YOU JUST HEARD,  SEAN

280
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:03,772
GO THROUGH, THE DEMOCRATS ARE

281
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:04,974
ANGRY AT ALL OF IT.

282
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:05,941
WHY ARE THEY HAPPY?

283
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:08,077
FOLKS, WE ARE IN A ROARING

284
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:08,410
ECONOMY.

285
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:09,445
MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER CAN GET

286
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:10,779
THE JOB THEY WANT TO, THEY ARE

287
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,781
GETTING READY AND SAYS.

288
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:16,952
WE HAVE PEOPLE FREE TO START

289
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:17,987
THEIR OWN BUSINESSES.

290
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:18,821
EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF LIFE IN

291
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:20,589
AMERICA IS ON THE UPSWING, AND A

292
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,191
POLITICAL PARTY AND ITS VOTERS

293
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:23,726
ARE MAD ABOUT IT.

294
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:24,159
WHY?

295
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,260
WHY COULDN'T YOU BE HAPPY?

296
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:26,528
THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE.

297
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,166
IF IT HAPPENS AS A RESULT OF

298
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,301
INDIVIDUAL APTITUDE AND

299
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,136
APPLICATION AND SET OF

300
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,336
GOVERNMENT MAKING IT HAPPEN,

301
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:36,571
THEY ARE GOING TO OPPOSE IT.

302
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:39,008
THIS THE GREATEST THREAT,

303
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,777
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, ECONOMIC

304
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:43,178
GROWTH, SELF-SUFFICIENCY,

305
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,880
SELF-RELIANCE, PEOPLE LEARNING

306
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,482
THAT THE OLD RULES OF WORKING

307
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,150
HARD AND APPLYING YOURSELF PAY

308
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:49,718
OFF, BIGGEST THREAT TO THE

309
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,953
AMERICAN LEFT IN THE DEMOCRAT

310
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:51,920
PARTY THAT THERE COULD BE.

311
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:52,921
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

312
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,924
WHY ARE THEY HAPPY ABOUT THIS?

313
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:57,092
EVERYBODY OUGHT TO BE --

314
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,527
>> Sean: BECAUSE THEY LOSE

315
00:08:58,528 --> 00:08:58,927
THEIR POWER.

316
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:00,129
>> Rush: OF COURSE.

317
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,563
IT ANSWERS ITSELF.

318
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:02,931
>> Sean: YOU HAVE BEEN A

319
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:03,565
LEADER IN THE CONSERVATIVE

320
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,334
MOVEMENT IN AMERICA --

321
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:06,368
>> Rush: I DON'T KNOW.

322
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:11,106
>> Sean: NUMBER ONE --

323
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:13,642
AUDIENCE SUSTAINED AND BIGGER.

324
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:15,377
>> Rush: THE CONSERVATIVE

325
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:18,514
MOVEMENT IS LED BY

326
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:18,947
NEVER-TRUMPER.

327
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:21,550
>> Sean: IF THEY HAD THEIR

328
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:22,785
WAY, WHERE WOULD WE BE?

329
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:25,554
>> Rush: NOT HERE.

330
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:26,288
HILLARY WOULD BE PRESIDENT IF

331
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:29,692
THEY HAD THEIR WAY.

332
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:31,760
>> Sean: IF YOU BELIEVE

333
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:34,563
GOLDWATER WAS A WAY OF, IF YOU

334
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:35,397
BELIEVE REAGAN WAS A WAVE --

335
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:39,902
MEANING THE ADVANCEMENT OF

336
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:40,369
CONSERVATIVISM.

337
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,970
WHERE DOES DONALD TRUMP -- I

338
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:44,206
LOOK AT HIS POLICIES.

339
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:45,340
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A

340
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:45,774
CONSERVATIVE.

341
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,543
NEVER CHANGE MY VIEWS.

342
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,745
I SAY IT DIFFERENTLY, NEW

343
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:50,779
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT MY

344
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,747
FUNDAMENTAL, CORE BELIEFS HAVE

345
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:52,181
NEVER CHANGED.

346
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:54,550
NOR HAVE YOURS.

347
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,551
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE SAID HE

348
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,753
IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE.

349
00:09:57,754 --> 00:09:58,220
WHERE?

350
00:09:58,221 --> 00:09:59,755
BESIDES TRADE, AND I DON'T EVEN

351
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:01,457
THINK TRADE -- SHE NEVER PLANNED

352
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:01,924
A TRADE WAR.

353
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:03,559
>> Rush: HE IS IMPLEMENTING.

354
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,127
I KNOW THESE PEOPLE, I GOT TO

355
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:06,929
KNOW THEM IN 30 YEARS.

356
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,596
>> Sean: BUCKLEY LOVES YOU.

357
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:08,664
>> Rush: I WILL TELL YOU A

358
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:09,665
STORY ABOUT HIM IN A MINUTE.

359
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,066
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TO ASK ME

360
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,434
WHERE HE WOULD BE ON TRUMP.

361
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:15,003
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS PRETTY

362
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:16,505
SIMPLE.

363
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:22,111
BUT THEY DON'T LIKE US TRUMP --

364
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:23,946
HE IS IMPLEMENTING ISSUES THAT

365
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:24,713
THESE PEOPLE HAVE DEVOTED LIVES

366
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:27,916
TO BEING PASSED, AND THEY ARE

367
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,351
VOTING AWAY FROM IT.

368
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:30,385
NEVER MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE

369
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:30,719
ISSUES.

370
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,856
IT MUST BE ABOUT THE PROPER

371
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:35,724
MANNERS AND MAKING SURE WE DON'T

372
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:36,525
OFFEND OUR LIBERAL FRIENDS IN

373
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,627
WASHINGTON AND ALL OF THAT.

374
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:39,928
TRUMP DOES ALL OF THAT.

375
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,430
I CAN'T ABIDE THIS, THIS IS SO

376
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:43,065
OFFENSIVE TO ME, I CAN'T DO

377
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,134
THIS.

378
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:50,372
MEANWHILE, EVERYTHING THAT IS

379
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:51,039
HAPPENING IS MAKING AMERICA

380
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,774
GREAT, EXACTLY AS CONSERVATIVES

381
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,474
SAID IT WOULD, AND THEY DON'T

382
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,743
WANT TO BE ON THE BUS.

383
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:58,547
>> Sean: I SAY THIS TO PEOPLE

384
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:00,315
AND -- HE GOVERNS AS STRONG A

385
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,850
CONSERVATIVE AS WE HAVE SEEN IN

386
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:02,284
OUR LIFETIME.

387
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,418
>> Rush: HE DOES.

388
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,521
I DON'T THINK THE DIVIDE IN

389
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:07,489
AMERICA IS LEFT AND RIGHT SO

390
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:07,790
MUCH.

391
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,357
>> Sean: CONSERVATIVE

392
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:09,958
PRINCIPLES.

393
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,560
>> Rush: CONSERVATIVE

394
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:11,994
PRINCIPLES --

>> Sean: TAX CUTS, JUDGES,

396
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:16,398
BORDER SECURITY.

397
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,699
>> Rush: IT IS THE TRADITIONS

398
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,735
OF THE FOUNDING, ARE WE GOING TO

399
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:20,636
GO MARXIST LEFTIST?

400
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:21,737
THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

401
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:23,172
WE DON'T HAVE IN COMMON WITH

402
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,908
THEM, SEAN.

403
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:28,410
I STILL HEAR THESE PEOPLE SAY WE

404
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:29,745
NEED TO CROSS THE AISLE TO

405
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:32,047
COOPERATE -- WHAT DO WE HAVE IN

406
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:32,381
COMMON?

407
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:34,383
NAME SOMETHING WE HAVE IN COMMON

408
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,218
WITH ANY OF THE PEOPLE ACTING TO

409
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:38,120
DESTROY KAVANAUGH?

410
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:39,721
WHERE IS THE MIDDLE GROUND TO

411
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:40,355
COMPROMISE WITH THEM ON

412
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:40,722
KAVANAUGH.

413
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:43,525
THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DENY

414
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,561
HIM -- ALLOW HIM TO PROCESS.

415
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:47,129
>> Sean: ZERO.

416
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,696
ENDO- CORROBORATION.

417
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:48,430
>> Rush: THEY WANT TO DESTROY

418
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:50,866
HIS LIFE.

419
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:54,336
AND HIS FAMILY, HIS CAREER, HIS

420
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:56,738
FUTURE, AND THEY TELL US, THEY

421
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:57,539
ARE THE PARTY OF COMPASSION.

422
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,775
>> Sean: WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE,

423
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:02,311
WE HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, CLARENCE

424
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:02,644
THOMAS.

425
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:04,446
>> Rush: YOU SEE IT EVERY DAY.

426
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:06,915
HE WANTED EVERY ELECTION.

427

>> Rush: DONALD TRUMP -- I'M

428
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:13,689
SURE YOU HAVE TAKEN YOUR HITS.

429
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,524
ANYBODY THAT THEY DETERMINE IS

430
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,960
AN EFFECTIVE MESSENGER OF

431
00:12:17,961 --> 00:00:00,000
ANYTHING THEY DISAGREE WITH,
