hates world it's me Evelyn as you can
see I don't really keep up with my hair
color my roots are completely grown out
we are past the end of this colors 10
York dusty then a little bit of purple
then like dust interspersed throughout
so I'm going to show you how i refresh
my color this routine only works if
you've already lightened and dyed your
hair and you're just trying to maintain
it I'm also not a chemist but this video
contains no bleach your developer so
we're good
do you see the light reflecting you see
reflections bouncing from from my table
to your eyeballs do you see it
