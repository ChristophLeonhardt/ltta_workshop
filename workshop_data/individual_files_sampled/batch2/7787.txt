a lot of this information breaking in just the hour too before we went live but Devin unis today says that because from his point of view at least the FBI is currently under investigation by his committee because they're under investigation no one from the FBI can be used to brief the Committee on any information about dossiers or any other information so it's sort of a get-out-of-jail-free card and the FBI providing information where he's just saying all of you are suspect so you can't be used anymore I don't see that playing out the way he plans necessarily but that is his goal at least today is to Stonewall the FBI from being involved in any of these investigations we also found out earlier today I believe this is a CNN breaking a news story that back in December Donald Trump had a conversation with Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein where he asked him if he was quote on my team which is not the same thing as asking for a loyalty pledge which he famously did with James Comey when it's in that neighborhood yeah now rod Rosen Stein had said in his testimony to Congress that he had not been asked to take part in any sort of loyalty pledge or anything like that so it appears that he didn't perceive it that way either but that is from a guy like Donald Trump who we know is very interested in loyalty I think that that's not nothing well such a couple of important things there I'm rod Rosen Stein's testimony he pointedly refused to answer questions about whether he'd been asked about loyalty but then went on to say well I didn't give a loyalty pledge so that would make this story now fit in to that to his testimony which is already on the record so it turns out Donald Trump said are you on my team again asking for loyalty and and Rosenstein in his interpretation did not give that pledge and so he did say that he was on his team or he's on the team I think he said no no he the report said that it was an awkward situation which it most certainly is because he's part of the executive branch run by Donald Trump and he said well mr. president we're all part of the same team right and I mean to give the guy credit what can you say in a situation like that no piss off no you can't say that no I don't were enemy right and you also can't say yes I promise to be on your team and not the American government's team etcetera so he's in a trump with some in an untenable spot as he did with Comey and so many others and Trump to this late date either doesn't understand that you can't ask people to Justice Department whether they are on your team especially when they're charged with investigating you yeah or understands that and thinks no I am fundamentally corrupt I don't care I demand corruption yeah from people and and and both are possible given his lack of intelligence and his deep nature as a as a crop person that has been around for ever and ever for if you go back to all of his business dealings in Trump University etc so now I noticed one last thing Mike Quigley was a Democrat from Illinois said that in a private meeting of congressmen he asked nudists if the Trump White House worked with him on this secret memo that that is so important that it has you know launched this release the memo thing and noona said no I didn't work on it and when he asked them did your staff work on it with the White House he was like I'm not gonna answer that I see so in other words your staff did work with the White House so this memo is even more useless now so it's basically written by the drama White House and is seen as some sort of gotcha of the FBI yeah preposterous if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now TYT Network comm /join get the whole young turks oh every day
