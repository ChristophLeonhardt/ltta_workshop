Hello, I’m Wes Anderson.
I’m the director and
co-writer of “Isle of Dogs."
So this is Atari, the
mayor’s ward
with the hero pack —
the pack of dogs who
he has befriended.
And these men have come
to try to take him back
to civilization.
He’s on a garbage dump
island at the moment.
There’s a lot to keep track of.
There’s action happening up
in the sky and over there,
where the robot is.
And from the beach side, the
men and Atari and the dogs here.
When you’re doing
an animated movie,
you work from an animatic.
You do a storyboard
version of the movie,
and you develop it that way.
You make the movie
in sketch form,
but with sound and movement.
In a scene like
this, even if I was
trying to do it in
a live action movie,
I would work the same way.
I’ll just tell a bit about the
different devices and methods
we used to animate
all this stuff.
The landscape, we
wanted this dark area
where this is happening
and this whole hill
is made of like, miniature
cathode ray tubes.
The water is all clingfilm,
and what they call in England,
Saran wrap —
what I grew up saying.
And it’s just animated
to move like water.
The smoke and when they fight,
these clouds that happen,
are all done with
just cotton wool.
And also, the music became
a big part of this scene.
We have a score by
Alexandre Desplat.
It’s very heavy on
percussion and saxophones,
and it became a big part
of what the scene became.
We also, throughout
the movie, we
have different things that
are happening on TV screens
or projected.
Those, we’ve all done
in hand-drawn animation
so the movie’s a
mixture of stop motion,
three-dimensional
photographed objects —
puppets — and 2D
hand-drawn animation,
for those parts of the story.
It takes a significant focus,
for me, to make it clear,
how everything is working
together spatially so you
can follow the action clearly.
Now here, we go
into split screen,
and it’s a very good
technique, especially when
you have a scene with a
lot of visual information
that needs to be communicated
and you need to keep the pace.
