jumped off some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things wore some</font>

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,690

<font color="#E5E5E5">up and apparently what she's just done</font>

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,520
was an advert<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee political acts against</font>

Donald Trump which I disagree with let's

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,750
be clear here everything really is

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,700
political beyonce's singing a song about

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,559
black empowerment of black identity of

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,379
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Super Bowl when there is a massive</font>

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is political am ia flipping the</font>

bird during Madonna's halftime show of

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,300
years ago that is political and to a

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,470
certain extent Lady Gaga singing about

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,090
lgbtq+<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights with us and born this way</font>

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,479
and this year Super Bowl is political in

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
a way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think that she is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,530
given too much credit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,479
wasn't that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do sorry not funny I</font>

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,060
understand the desire and the need for

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,799
us to see our role models<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the people</font>

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,799
that we look up to standing up for

31
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,869
political views that we believe in

32
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,820
especially in a time when Donald Trump

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,720
is basically instigating the apocalypse

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,100
I'm on everything that there was nothing

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,229
political about gargoyles halftime show

36
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,729
at the Super Bowl parties were kind

37
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,409
enough to break down everything that

38
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,070
they deemed as political in her<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,899
minute performance first of all she

40
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,640
started off with a rendition of this

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">land is our land and had blue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drums for</font>

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,810
when she says this land is my land and

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">when she said this land is your land</font>

44
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,329
there were red drones which I mean

45
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,639
artistry very pretty nice use of car

46
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,260
she could have made this a really

47
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerful segment though by using a</font>

48
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,959
different version of the song<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not</font>

49
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,470
using a watered-down mass pleasing

50
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,990
version of it in the original version of

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,430
the song that never made it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be actual</font>

52
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,890
recording there's a part that goes there

53
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,569
was a big high wall dare that trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

54
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,000
stop me the sign was<font color="#E5E5E5"> painted said</font>

56
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,830
didn't say nothing this land<font color="#E5E5E5"> was made</font>

57
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,530
for you and me that would have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

58
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">kick like flipping the bird Donal Trump</font>

59
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,650
that would have been brilliant but no

60
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,080
she chose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go say it also doesn't pass</font>

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Born This Way is a political</font>

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,350

black white or beige Chola or orient

00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,709
made in the current climate though the

67
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,390
powerful things to be saying when there

68
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,000
is a racist president and there's a vice

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,620
president<font color="#CCCCCC"> who believes that gay people</font>

70
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,300
could be true<font color="#E5E5E5"> or true conversion therapy</font>

71
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,730
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the political oomph of the</font>

72
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,120
song was taken out the introduction that

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,799
goes it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter if you love him</font>

or capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> H I am why was that taken out</font>

75
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,950
why was that removed when that could

76
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,810
have made a really strong statement I

77
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,950
get what you're saying and why you're

78
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,870
saying it or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least what I'm assuming</font>

79
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,840
you're saying we should accept what we

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get but our allies are speaking out</font>

81
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,930
for the queer community and communities

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,200
of color<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that's not mine I'm</font>

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,110
I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want I'm just quit but the</font>

84
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,470
thing with allies to any community is

85
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that their activism should never be</font>

86
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,120
convenient or easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lady Gaga's activism</font>

87
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,920
if you want to call this performance

88
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,739
activism was convenient and it

89
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,190
compromised and we deserve more from our

was dissent that was political

performance political activism I don't

119
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,340
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gaga's performance falls into</font>

120
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,160
that category and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we're</font>

more often<font color="#CCCCCC"> them we the queer community</font>

that they loved her performance how is

137
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending a message to the powers</font>

138

that be it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're stupid</font>

139
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,630
those are those are smart people that

140
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,310
probably know what true dissidents would

141
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,100
be we saw a new tooth Lady Gaga there

142
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,800
and that's sad because she<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

fantastic advocate advocate of so many

144

community she's a brilliant lady but I

145
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we're if we want our role</font>

147
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,960
we should be asking and expecting a lot

148
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,900
from them enjoy lady gaga's performance

149
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,509
love the fact that she slayed yars but

150
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,690
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call this political because this</font>

151
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,740
was this was the performance equivalent

152
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the activism equivalent of somebody</font>

153
