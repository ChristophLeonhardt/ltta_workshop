1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:02,763
IN THE FIRES NOT FAR FROM

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:03,631
THE CITY OF ATHENS.

3
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:05,800
ALL RIGHT.

4
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:06,200
AINSLEY?

5
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,868
AINSLEY: THANK YOU, STEVE.

6
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:12,106
FROM AN APPARENT OVERDOSE

7
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:13,340
DESPITE INITIAL REPORTS

8
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,175
SOURCES TELLING FOX NEWS IT

9
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:16,410
WAS NOT HEROIN, ALTHOUGH WE

10
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,283
THE OPIOID REVERSAL DRUG

11
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:25,119
CALLED NARCAN AT THE SCENE.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,188
DR. DANIEL BOBBER IS A

13
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,322
CERTIFIED ADDICTION MEDICINE

14
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:29,456
PHYSICIAN AND HE JOINS US

15
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:30,391
NOW WITH REACTION.

16
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:31,592
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

17
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:32,827
>> THANK YOU, AINSLEY, GREAT

18
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:34,161
TO BE HERE.

19
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:34,929
AINSLEY: YOU ARE WELCOME.

20
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,764
WE WANT TO SHED SOME LIGHT

21
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:37,898
ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY

22
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,900
A PROBLEM.

23
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:40,801
OPIOID DEATH CAUSE FOR

24
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:41,635
INJURY DEATH IN THE UNITED

25
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:44,738
SO MANY PEOPLE LOOK UP TO

26
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:47,107
THIS, PLEASE, WITH ALL YOUR

27
00:00:47,108 --> 00:00:47,508
EXPERIENCE.

28
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:49,543
>> YOU KNOW, AINSLEY, THIS

29
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:51,745
IS A HORRIBLE EPIDEMIC, 120

30
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,180
PEOPLE A DAY OVERDOSE IN

31
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:56,217
THIS COUNTRY AND WE SPEND

32
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:57,351
$80 BILLION A YEAR IN TERMS

33
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:58,853
OF HEALTHCARE COSTS AND LOSS

34
00:00:58,854 --> 00:00:59,987
OF PRODUCTIVITY.

35
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:02,256
SO, THIS SHOULD RAISE

36
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:03,290
AWARENESS IN OUR COUNTRY

37
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,159
ABOUT A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE

38
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,161
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.

39
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:07,928
AND THERE IS TREATMENT IN

40
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:10,898
THE FORM OF DRUGS LIKE

41
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:12,333
METHADONE AND NORPHINE WHICH

42
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:13,601
HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CUT THE

43
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:18,339
IS A LOT OF IGNORANCE IN THE

44
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,473
COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE DON'T

45
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:23,277
DEPENDENCE.

46
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:24,778
SO, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO

47
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:25,779
START LOOKING AT THE WAY WE

48
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,114
ARE TREATING PEOPLE AND

49
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:32,486
THIS WAS A HEROIN OVERDOSE.

50
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:33,621
THEN THERE WAS A STATEMENT

51
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:35,923
FROM HER FAMILY SAYING YOU

52
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:36,891
KNOW, EVERYTHING THAT'S

53
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:37,725
BEING REPORTED IS NOT

54
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:38,525
NECESSARILY TRUE.

55
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:39,360
THEN WE ARE HEARING FROM

56
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:40,294
FRIENDS THAT WERE THERE

57
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:41,662
SAYING IT WASN'T HEROIN.

58
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:44,131
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT NARCAN

59
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:44,598
WAS USED.

60
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,100
WOULD NARCAN BE USED FOR

61
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:47,434
ANOTHER DRUG OR DIFFERENT

62
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:48,402
TYPE OF OVERDOSE?

63
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:50,537
>> YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES

64
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:51,805
NARCAN WILL BE USED DURING

65
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:53,207
AN OVERDOSE WHEN PAIR

66
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,209
MEDICINE DINGS, FOR EXAMPLE,

67
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,110
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DRUG IS

68
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:58,145
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HURT

69
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:01,849
IF THEY DID OVERDOSE ON

70
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,652
OPIOIDS THAT IS A WAY TO

71
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:07,922
HEROIN OR OTHER OPIOID BUT

72
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:09,957
AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW FOR

73
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:10,324
SURE.

74
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:10,990
AINSLEY: ARE YOU SEEING A

75
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:11,992
LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN HER

76
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:13,928
AGE IN THEIR 20'S USING

77
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:14,261
HEROIN?

78
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:15,396
>> YOU KNOW, I SEE THIS

79
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:16,664
EVERY DAY IN MY OFFICE.

80
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:18,465
I SEE IT EVERY DAY IN THE

81
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:19,133
HOSPITAL.

82
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:20,701
THIS IS AN ILLNESS THAT

83
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:21,969
EFFECTS PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF

84
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,836
THEIR STATUS.

85
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,807
COMMUNITIES AND IT'S

86
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:28,309
AFFECTING US EVERY DAY.

87
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:32,613
PARENTS THAT HAVE KIDS THAT

88
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:33,747
ARE DEALING WITH THIS?

89
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,550
>> WELL, THAT THEY HAVE TO

90
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:36,984
GET TREATMENT.

91
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:38,519
VERY OFTEN THIS REQUIRES

92
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT IN A

93
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:40,287
CONTROLLED SETTING.

94
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,256
AND IT CAN BE VERY COSTLY

95
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:43,324
AND VERY EXPENSIVE.

96
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:44,692
AND THIS IS WHY I CALL UPON

97
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:45,526
THE WHITE HOUSE AND

98
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:46,794
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO DO

99
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:52,900
AINSLEY: WHAT ARE THE

100
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:53,567
CHANCES PEOPLE CAN BE CLEAN

101
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,102
IF THEY DO HAVE AN ADDICTION

102
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:56,170
IF IT HAS A HOLD ON THEM?

103
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:58,706
>> ONE OF THE GREATEST MYTHS

104
00:02:58,707 --> 00:02:59,740
ABOUT ADDICTION IS THAT IT

105
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:00,841
CAN'T BE TREATED.

106
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:02,242
YOU KNOW, ADDICTION IS NOT

107
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:03,477
TREATED THE SAME WAY, FOR

108
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:04,645
EXAMPLE, OR THOUGHT OF AS

109
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,113
THE SAME WAY AS HEART

110
00:03:06,114 --> 00:03:07,414
DISEASE OR DIABETES.

111
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:08,649
YOU KNOW, IF SOMEONE TELLS

112
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,950
YOU THAT YOU HAVE -- SOMEONE

113
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:11,485
TELLS YOU THAT THEY HAVE AN

114
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:12,653
ADDICTION, WE TEND TO LOOK

115
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:13,988
AT THEM IN A STRANGE WAY.

116
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,423
SO, WE NEED TO ERASE THE

117
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:17,658
STIGMA OF ADDICTION.

118
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,692
BUT THE RATE OF TREATMENT

119
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:20,627
AND RELAPSE OR REMISSION IS

120
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:21,996
SIMILAR TO THINGS LIKE

121
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:23,163
DIABETES AND ASTHMA.

122
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:24,732
SO, WE CAN TREAT ADDICTION

123
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,600
THE SAME WAY WE TREAT ANY

124
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:27,935
OTHER MEDICAL ILLNESS.

125
00:03:30,138 --> 00:00:00,000
COMPASSION AND NOT JUDGE
