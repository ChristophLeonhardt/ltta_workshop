now we have John K what is his name John F Kennedy for staff new one what does that mean he's a former general he ran Homeland Security today in the speech in Long Island to law enforcement officials 10 to 15 times it seemed like Trump was saying this guy is a star he's one of the stars of our administration I think he mentions it in this tweet a true star of my administration what what does it mean having a general in who ran Homeland Security as chief of staff what do we say not a bad thing okay so let me explain two parts of this one is John Kelly as a general so despite all the stuff that he said about the generals during the campaign Trump respects him he's like oh that's a man of status I like men of status he's filled his administration to the rim with generals after he talked all that smack about the generals and they kept it we're not winning maybe they don't know how to win I'm gonna come in I'm gonna show him how to win and then he's like I don't know I don't know what I'm doing I need a lot of generals around me they're they're high-level people right they're successful and then Sanibel he likes Kelly because he's like okay I want you to ban the Muslims and do all this stuff and general Kelly was like yes sir okay what do you need sir I don't like you anyway let's do it right Muslim I barely know him yeah and the reason it doesn't mean anything the reason it doesn't mean any is because you think Trump won't turn on him tick tock tick tock but does he even really have any power I mean scaramouche he reports directly to Trump I don't I don't even at this point I don't know it's a chain of command person he wants something if Reince Priebus known to pull people together and say to keep the ship together whatever that means you have a general who responds to the commander-in-chief who's like exactly like I'll do what you say and I'll respect the chain of command I hate insubordination as much as you to the point where like we court-martial people and prosecute them yeah if they if they ignore the chain commit so look it's score mu cheese relevant communications director but Chiva staff sets all the meetings for the president if done right and appropriately if shiba staff is an enormous ly important position but this guy's so out of control Trump is well how can you set a meeting for him how can you said anything for him he's just all over the place so if the two cents is less relevant than they normally would be but you were Leakes maybe there'll be fewer leaves maybe watch the young turks commercial-free downloaded or stream it watch it any way you like at TYT Network comm slash join
