1
00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:01,163
HER IN HER GARAGE.

2
00:00:01,163 --> 00:00:02,665
>> THEY STILL NOT HAVE GOTTEN

3
00:00:02,665 --> 00:00:04,066
JUSTICE OR ANY SENSE OF CLOSURE.

4
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,367
>> Martha: THANK YOU FOR THE

5
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:06,769
UPDATE, MORE OF THAT ON MONDAY.

6
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,938
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

7
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:10,939
SO TONIGHT WE ARE GETTING

8
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:13,142
INCREDIBLE IN-DEPTH LOOK AT THE

9
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:14,343
STORY BEHIND THE BIGGEST LOTTERY

10
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:16,445
SCAM IN U.S. HISTORY, WORTH

11
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:18,781
$25 MILLION PAID HOW A

12
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:20,749
LITTLE-KNOWN MAN FROM RURAL,

13
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:23,752
IOWA MANAGED TO CRACK THE SYSTEM

14
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:24,920
AND RIG THE GAME IN FIVE

15
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,755
DIFFERENT STATES.

16
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,657
HE FOUND A WAY TO PICK THE

17
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:30,159
WINNING NUMBERS BEFORE THEY WERE

18
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:31,493
EVEN PICKED UP BY THE COMPUTER

19
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:32,761
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THIS.

20
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:34,630
AND NOW WE KNOW HOW.

21
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,198
THE ANSWER LIES IN THIS GRAINY

22
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:37,866
SURVEILLANCE TAPE THAT WAS TAKEN

23
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,501
FROM A QUICK TRIP GAS STATION

24
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,670
OFF OF INTERSTATE 80 IN IOWA.

25
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,805
RAISING A LOT OF EYEBROWS IN

26
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:45,574
2010 WHEN THE MAN YOU SEE

27
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:46,775
WEARING THE HOODIE AND HIDING

28
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,343
HIS FACE COMES IN AND PURCHASES

29
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:50,445
A TICKET THAT WOULD BE WORTH

30
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:50,846
$16 MILLION.

31
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,247
BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO CLAIM

32
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:54,583
THE PRIZE, HE NEVER SHOWED UP.

33
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,485
HIS LAWYER DID.

34
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,353
JUST TWO HOURS BEFORE THE

35
00:00:58,353 --> 00:00:58,720
DEADLINE.

36
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,755
DEMANDING THAT THEY WIRED THE

37
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,557
MONEY TO A BANK IN BELIZE.

38
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:03,892
SOMETHING DID NOT SMELL RIGHT,

39
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:08,163
SO THAT TIPPED THE FBI IN A

40
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:09,298
POSITION TO PUT THIS PROSECUTOR

41
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:11,600
ROB STANDS ON THIS CASE, FINDING

42
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,169
SOME SIMILAR SIMILARITIES IN

43
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:16,939
WINNING TICKETS THE SAME YEAR,

44
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:19,174
MAY 27TH, NOVEMBER 23RD,

45
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:20,809
DECEMBER 29TH, ALL SOLD ON THOSE

46
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:22,844
DAYS HAPPEN TO BE PURCHASED BY

47
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:24,179
FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES OF ONE

48
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:25,881
MAN PUT HIS NAME WAS EDDIE

49
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:28,083
TIPTON AND HE HAPPENED TO BE A

50
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,253
TOP I.T. WORKER AT THE AGENCY

51
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:33,021
THAT COORDINATES THE LOTTERIES

52
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:35,357
BETWEEN THE STATES.

53
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:37,259
ROB SAND, THE MAN WHO CRACKED

54
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:37,959
THE CASE JOINS ME NOW.

55
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,561
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

56
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:40,996
THIS IS QUITE A STORY.

57
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:43,765
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COMPUTER

58
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:45,200
HACKERS, EXPLAIN IN LAYMAN'S

59
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,403
TERMS, HOW DID HE DO THIS?

60
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:51,073
>> ESSENTIALLY HE HAD THE JOB OF

61
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:52,307
WRITING CODE TO PICK THE WINNING

62
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:52,741
NUMBERS.

63
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,376
AND WHAT HE DID WAS HE ADDED

64
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:56,244
JUST A COUPLE OF LINES OF CODE

65
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:57,579
THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM ON CERTAIN

66
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,881
DAYS OF THE YEAR TO ACTUALLY USE

67
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,450
A FORMULA TO KNOW WHAT THE

68
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,084
NUMBERS WOULD BE RATHER THAN

69
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,753
HAVING TO PICK FROM ONE IN

70
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:08,723
MILLIONS, HE WOULD BE ABLE TO

71
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:09,925
NARROW IT DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY.

72
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:11,326
>> Martha: IT IS INCREDIBLE,

73
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:14,563
SO YOU THOUGHT THIS CASE WAS

74
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:16,031
TOSSED ONTO YOUR DESK AS A YOUNG

75
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:16,765
PROSECUTOR, YOU LOOK AT THE

76
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:18,400
VIDEO AND YOU START PIECING

77
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,936
THINGS TOGETHER, HOW DID YOU

78
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:23,004
BEGIN TO CRACK THE CASE?

79
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,340
>> WE HAD A GREAT TEAM TO WORK

80
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,640
WITH.

81
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,777
A SPECIAL AGENTS IN THE IOWA

82
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:29,344
DIVISION OF CRIMINAL

83
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:30,845
INVESTIGATION AT ANDERSON AND

84
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:32,080
DON SMITH WERE HELPFUL.

85
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,116
TERRY RICH AND ROBBIE PORTER AT

86
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:37,552
THE IOWA LOTTERY WERE INCREDIBLY

87
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:38,953
HELPFUL, AND REPORTERS IN

88
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,522
WISCONSIN AS WELL.

89
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:41,623
WE UNRAVELED THIS THREAD PIECE

90
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:43,158
BY PIECE OVER THE COURSE OF A

91
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:43,658
FEW YEARS.

92
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:45,827
WE JUST HAD THE IOWA TICKET AT

93
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,529
FIRST AND HAD TO GO TO TRIAL

94
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:48,930
KNOWING ONLY ABOUT THAT TICKET

95
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,465
WITHOUT A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE

96
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:52,333
THAT WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO

97
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,134
HAVE AT THE TIME.

98
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,937
YET WE WERE ABLE TO WIN THAT

99
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:57,939
CASE, SECURE A COUPLE OF GUILTY

100
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:58,973
VERDICTS AND AT THAT POINT WE

101
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,209
HAD A TIP FROM SOMEONE IN TEXAS

102
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,745
WHO TOLD US THAT EDDIE TIPTON'S

103
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:05,547
BROTHER HAD WON THE LOTTERY IN

104
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:06,848
COLORADO ABOUT TEN YEARS

105
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:07,182
EARLIER.

106
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,150
WE WENT TO GOING FROM THERE FOR

107
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,485
EACH SUCCESSIVE TICKET.

108
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:11,786
>> Martha: YOU KNEW AFTER THE

109
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:13,588
FIRST CASE WHEN YOU GOT THE HINT

110
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:15,223
THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY MORE,

111
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:16,958
THAT IF HE HAD DONE IT OR PULLED

112
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,526
IT OFF THE ONE TIME, AND IT IS

113
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:20,729
INTERESTING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

114
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:23,331
ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE WORKED

115
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:23,865
WITH AT THE LOTTERY

116
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:24,933
ORGANIZATION, THEY LOOKED AT THE

117
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,335
VIDEO AND HELP TO YOU GUYS FIND

118
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:28,403
HIM, RIGHT?

119
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,404
AND THEY WERE SHOCKED THAT THIS

120
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:31,072
GUY THAT THEY WORKED WITH COULD

121
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:34,342
BE PULLING THIS OFF.

122
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:36,344
>> YES, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE

123
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:36,945
STORY.

124
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:38,012
PEOPLE SAID THINGS LIKE, IT WAS

125
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,948
LIKE FINDING OUT THAT MY MOTHER

126
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:41,216
WAS AN AX MURDERER, WAS THE

127
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:42,750
QUOTE FROM ONE OF HIS BEST

128
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,651
FRIENDS WHO HAD WORKED

129
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:45,353
SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH HIM FOR OVER A

130
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:45,753
DECADE.

131
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,555
PEOPLE WERE VERY BLINDSIDED BY

132
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,524
THE IDEA THAT HE COULD DO THIS,

133
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:51,726
BUT HE WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD THE

134
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:52,927
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT AND THE

135
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:53,795
KNOW-HOW TO DO IT AND THE

136
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:55,930
MOTIVATION TO DO IT.

137
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,099
>> Martha: HAVE THEY FIXED

138
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:58,399
THIS?

139
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,968
IF ANYTHING TODAY PEOPLE ARE

140
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:01,135
EVEN MORE SOPHISTICATED AT BEING

141
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:02,337
ABLE TO HACK INTO SYSTEMS, SO

142
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:04,105
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT

143
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,541
HAPPENING AGAIN?

144
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,709
>> I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT IT

145
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,144
COMES DOWN TO IS THERE IS

146
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:11,079
DARKNESS IN THE WORLD AND THERE

147
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,181
IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO

148
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:14,949
ARE GOING TO TRY TO HACK THE

149
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:15,283
SYSTEM.

150
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:16,551
WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING TO

151
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,752
MAKE SYSTEMS BETTER AND MAKE

152
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:19,387
THEM MORE EFFECTIVE, BUT AT THE

153
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:21,289
SAME TIME WE HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD

154
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:21,990
LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM TO BACK

155
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,124
IT UP.

156
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:26,160
AS THEY SAY, YOU BUILD A BETTER

157
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,428
MOUSETRAP, SOMEBODY BUILDS A

158
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:27,862
BETTER MOUSE.

159
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:28,429
>> Martha: VERY TRUE.

160
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:29,964
THIS IS AN AMAZING STORY.

161
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:31,065
GOOD FOR YOU FOR PULLING THIS

162
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:31,332
OFF.

163
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:34,168
YOU THINK HE IS GOING TO GET OUT

164
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:34,468
EARLY?

165
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:37,205
>> WELL, AND I WHILE WE HAVE

166
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,306
MADE DETERMINATE SENTENCING, SO

167
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:41,676
UP TO 25 YEARS, BUT HE WOULD GET

168
00:04:41,676 --> 00:00:00,000
A GOOD TIME CREDIT OF ABOUT HALF
