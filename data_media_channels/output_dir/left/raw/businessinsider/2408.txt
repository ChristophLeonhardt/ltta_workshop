build<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company it wasn't even that I</font>

that I kind of wasn't thinking about

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">building a company and that's why early</font>

launch it at schools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they thought</font>

lowest<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance of working right and so</font>

00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,430
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> were schools that already had some</font>

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,850
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">was just worth spending a lot of time on</font>

17
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,030
as a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in college I I</font>

18
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,829
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> built a whole lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

19
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:46,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and that's just a passion of mine</font>

00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of kept doing building</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

23
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,309
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks right and and then we improved</font>

24
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:56,230

figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that that</font>

29
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,080
maybe could grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot bigger and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's when my roommates joined me and</font>

31
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,320
