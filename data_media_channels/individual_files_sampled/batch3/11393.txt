this is the closest we can get with a camera to Ben Gurion International Airport which is just behind me for more than a week a 22 year old American student Laura al-qasim has been held here she arrived with a valid student visa but was stopped by border guards and asked if she had ever been a member of the boycott disinvestment and sanctions movement the BDS now she said she hadn't but according to Israel's strategic affairs ministry she was an active member and because of this in line with an Israeli law that was enacted last year she has been refused entry that law states that any foreigners who publicly and knowingly participate in boycotts against Israel can be refused entry and there are already 15 people who have been denied entry under this law Laura filed an appeal in the Israeli judicial system but the court ruled that her refusal of entry was valid she then filed a second appeal and the Israel District Court is due to begin hearing this on Thursday the Israelis have repeatedly said that she is not being detained and is free to return to the United States at any time she can fly back to the United States whenever she likes she decided to appeal and has been held in the facility for those refused entry now Laura says not only was she not a member of the BDS she would not have applied to study and an Israeli institution if she was she's also promised not to do so in future now the Israeli University Hebrew you wear ironic is she was supposed to study a master's degree in human rights has also come out in support of her and a number of university heads have written a letter to the strategic ministry saying that if they deport her or prevent her from entering this will only bode negatively for the country the issue again highlights the ongoing discussion over how Israel handles critics against her policy RT outside television and there has been response from Washington the US says it is aware of Laura's case and that it values freedom of expression but that it is Ridgewell to decide on who is led into the country law professor Allen her L from Jerusalem's Hebrew University thinks Israel's jeopardizing its international relations this is an improper use of the powers of the minister in this case and it harms academia very seriously people will not register as well universities because if they participated in the demonstration or if they did this oh if they did that they would have to reconsider their decision to come here and then on the top of it many people find it so I punished if they would stop cooperating with Israel because they want to cooperate with the country that it meets that that enjoys a free exchange of ideas we this is a rich stretch of Israeli academia and I think Israeli academics ought in this case to take very extreme means including a strike until the decision is being overly you
