1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,217
GREGG DAVID WILL BE HERE TO TALK

2
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:08,254
ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND

3
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:09,956
HOMELESSNESS CRIPPLING

4
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:10,356
CALIFORNIA.

5
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:13,926
FIRST LIT'S GET TO THE BIG

6
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:14,260
STORY.

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,130
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW FROM THE REST

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,533
OF THE MEDIA.

9
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,168
JOBS, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND

10
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:23,603
INCOME EFFECT YOU AND YOUR

11
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:27,573
FAMILY AND IT'S WHAT THE

12
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:28,975
POPULOUS REVOLUTION IS ABOUT.

13
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:30,710
THESE ARE OTHER NUMBERS I

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,180
HAVEN'T SEEN COVERED.

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,614
5.4%.

16
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:39,418
THAT'S THE LOWEST YOU

17
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:39,452
THAT'S THE LOWEST UOU

18
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:40,353
THAT'S THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT

19
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:43,489
RATE FOR WORKERS WITH A HIGH

20
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:49,595
SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

21
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:52,265
ALSO .5% IS THE RISE IN EARNINGS

22
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:54,033
FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES.

23
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,868
THAT'S CLEAR EVIDENCE THE TRUMP

24
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:58,171
ECONOMY IS HELPING THE PEOPLE

25
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,972
THE PRESIDENT PROMISED TO HELP.

26
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:05,144
THOSE LEFT BEHIND BY DECADES.

27
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:08,381
JOINING ME NOW, THE HOST FROM

28
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:10,283
FOX BUSINESS NETWORK KENNEDY IS

29
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:10,850
HERE.

30
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:18,891
>> SO NICE TO SEE YOU IN

31
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:20,226
BEAUTIFUL LAS ANGELES.

32
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:21,961
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY

33
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,230
WOULD BACK TRUMP BECAUSE OF THIS

34
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,932
BIG ISSUE OF THE ECONOMY.

35
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:28,634
AT LEAST HE WILL GET THE ECONOMY

36
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:28,968
MOVING.

37
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,803
IT FEELS LIKE THAT IS HAPPENING.

38
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:33,272
>> THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN

39
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:35,408
WASHINGTON SEES THE ECONOMY AND

40
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:40,079
FAMILIES SEE THE ECONOMY.

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,582
POPULISM DOESN'T MEAN STATISM OR

42
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:43,216
GROUP THINK.

43
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:46,786
IT'S ABOUT INDIVIDUALS AND

44
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:52,124
FAMILIES THAT LOOKED AT THE

45
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:52,491
LANDSCAPE.

46
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,560
THEY HAVE ASKED FOR YEARS WHAT'S

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,862
IN IT FOR ME.

48
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,598
YOU TALK ABOUT A WIN FALL ON

49
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,298
WALL STREET.

50
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,033
FOR SOME THAT'S GREAT.

51
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,736
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MILLIONS AND

52
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:09,108
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS I DON'T STOP

53
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:10,209
THEIR WEALTH.

54
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:17,183
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

55
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:19,986
THOSE METRICS DON'T NECESSARILY

56
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:21,120
APPLY TO THEM.

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,656
WHAT THEY WANT IS SOMEONE WHO

58
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:26,459
THINKS IN AN UNORTHODOX WAY THAT

59
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,096
WILL SHAKE THINGS UP AND MORE

60
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,230
IMPORTANTLY HOLD PEOPLE

61
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,531
ACCOUNTABLE THAT HAVE BEEN

62
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:34,066
ABUSING THEIR POWER AND

63
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,167
FORGETTING ABOUT THEM.

64
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,103
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN

65
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,204
YOU HERE HILLARY CLINTON AND

66
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:43,142
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND BEN RHODES

67
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:45,278
TALK ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE

68
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:46,178
2016 ELECTION.

69
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:50,850
IT WAS THEIR FAILURE TO LOOK AT

70
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,286
THE PROBLEMS THESE PEOPLE WERE

71
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:54,553
HAVING.

72
00:02:54,553 --> 00:03:00,526
>> YOU MENTIONED BEN RHODES.

73
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:03,996
HE HAS THIS QUOTE IN IT.

74
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,398
HE SPOKE ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE

75
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:06,599
JUST SAYING.

76
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:13,572
WHY THEY LOST AND OBAMA WONDERED

77
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,508
WHY THE REASON HE WAS REJECTED

78
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:19,478
WAS TO DO WITH RACE.

79
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:24,717
HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS 1

80
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:25,084
HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS 0

81
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:25,117
HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS O

82
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:25,151
HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS

83
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:25,484
HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS 0

84
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:25,518
HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS Y

85
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:25,551
HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS A

86
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:26,852
HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS S

87
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:27,653
LATER.

88
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,489
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION LEFT

89
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:31,891
SO MANY PEOPLE BEHIND.

90
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:34,226
THE ECONOMY WASN'T WORKING FOR

91
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:35,161
WORKING PEOPLE.

92
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:37,363
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE

93
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:38,864
SIMILARITIES YOU HAVE TWO BIG

94
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:40,299
SPENDING PRESIDENTS THAT FELT

95
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,702
THEY COULD JUST APPLY THEIR

96
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:45,338
WORLD VIEW AND MAKE PEOPLES

97
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,839
LIVES BETTER WHETHER IT WAS

98
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,841
STANDARDING WARS IN

99
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:48,874
STANDARDING WAR -IN

100
00:03:48,874 --> 00:03:49,175
STANDARDING WAR --N

101
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:50,409
STANDARDING WAR -- STARTING WARS

102
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,211
IN THE MIDDLE EAST OR HAVING

103
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,846
MASSIVE SPENDING PROGRAMS.

104
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:56,282
THAT MADE PEOPLES LIVES WORSE.

105
00:03:56,282 --> 00:03:59,885
IT MADE IT HARDER TO START A

106
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:02,355
BUSINESS AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE

107
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:05,858
DROPOUT OF THE WORK FORCE

108
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:06,225
ENTIRELY.

109
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:10,730
YOU HAD EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS GOING

110
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:10,997
UP.

111
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,265
YOU HAD A HUGE PART OF THE LABOR

112
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,534
FORCE THAT WASN'T PARTICIPATING

113
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:17,870
AT ALL.

114
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,637
>> THAT'S WHAT IS CHANGING NOW.

115
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:22,375
THEY TALK ABOUT THE 1%.

116
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:28,581
THE PEOPLE REALLY BEN BE

117
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:28,614
THE PEOPLE REALLY BENEFE

118
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:29,048
THE PEOPLE REALLY BENEFITING

119
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:30,883
RIGHT NOW WERE IN THE WORK

120
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:31,283
FORCE.

121
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:33,419
LOOKING AHEAD, WHAT DO YOU THINK

122
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:40,259
THE IMPACT WILL BE OF THE TRADE

123
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:40,826
STRATEGY.

124
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,095
>> IT DEPENDS ON THE LONG-TERM

125
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:43,396
GOAL.

126
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:50,870
BOTH SIDES ARE EXCITED.

127
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,205
THEY KNOW ECONOMIC PROTECTIONISM

128
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:53,906
DOESN'T WORK.

129
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:56,342
IF HE USES IT AS A SHORT-TERM

130
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:56,709
STRATEGY.

131
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:03,115
IF THIS IS A NEGOTIATION TOOL TO

132
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:04,817
RECRAFT NAFTA AND HAVE MORE

133
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:09,889
TRADE WITH THE E.U., CANADA, AND

134
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:10,222
MEXICO.

135
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,591
IF IT'S SHORT-TERM AND WORKS OUT

136
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:14,827
AND LEADS TO MORE U.S. ECONOMIC

137
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:15,928
GROWTH THAT'S GOOD.

138
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:23,903
IF IT'S A LONG TERM STRATEGY.

139
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,771
THAT WILL BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THE

140
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:28,407
PEOPLE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

141
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,977
IT COULD BE A PROTRACTED TRADE

142
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:32,445
WAR.

143
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,713
THINGS LIKE STEEL AND ALUMINUM

144
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:36,482
GO TO MAKING OTHER THINGS.

145
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:39,318
IF THEY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE

146
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:41,053
BECAUSE OF TARIFFS THAT WILL BE

147
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,155
A BIG ISSUE WITH INFLATION ALSO

148
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:44,356
ON THE RISE.

149
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:47,126
>> I REALLY AGREE WITH THAT

150
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:47,493
ANALYSIS.

151
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:50,362
WE SHOULD BELIEVE WHAT HE SAYS.

152
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,398
HE SAID I'M FOR FREE TRADE AND

153
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:53,199
FAIR TRADE.

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,635
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A

155
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:57,036
NEGOTIATION.

156
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:59,205
I WANT TO SWITCH TO ONE MORE

157
00:05:59,205 --> 00:05:59,505
TOPIC.

158
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:07,079
THIS REALLY GOT ME RILED UP.

159
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,014
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID ON

160
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,816
THURSDAY OR FRIDAY ABOUT THE

161
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:11,283
PRESIDENT.

162
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:13,452
>> MR.  TRUMP WILL PROMOTE HIS

163
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:14,153
NARRATIVE.

164
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:16,589
HE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO

165
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,792
DISCREDIT THE FBI AND CIA AND

166
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:20,126
OTHERS.

167
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,862
I THINK, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT

168
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:25,097
IT, THE AMERICAN JUSTICE SYSTEM

169
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:30,836
WILL PREVAIL IN THIS ENDEAVOR

170
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,771
ABOUT WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN

171
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,808
COLLABORATING AND WORKING WITH

172
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,610
FOREIGN ACTORS.

173
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,345
>> COLLABORATING AND WORKING

174
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:42,081
WITH FOREIGN ACTORS.

175
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,517
IT WAS YOU, JOHN, THAT GOT

176
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:48,354
INVOLVED WITH THE DOSSIER.

177
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:52,224
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE ARROGANCE OF

178
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:53,292
THE PEOPLE.

179
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,561
>> THE FBI EMPLOYED CHRISTOPHER

180
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:59,899
STEEL FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

181
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:00,199
TIME.

182
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,235
I THINK JOHN LIKE JAMES COMBY

183
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:07,273
ARE SAVIORS OF THE GILLED

184
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:07,673
INSTITUTION.

185
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:09,909
IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO HOLD

186
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:10,843
THEM ACCOUNTABLE.

187
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:15,047
WHAT HE'S DOING.

188
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:16,916
ALL IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE DOING

189
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,285
IS TRYING TO SHIELD THEMSELVES

190
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:20,553
FROM ANY ACCOUNTABILITY.

191
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,288
THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

192
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:25,391
WE TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT.

193
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:27,526
>> YES, THE LACK OF

194
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:29,261
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY.

195
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:32,498
NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE

196
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:33,599
DEFENDERS OF THE PRESIDENT.

197
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,969
I THINK HIS ATTACKS ARE SMALL

198
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:37,303
MINDED.

199
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,772
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY

200
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:40,206
SHORTSIGHTED.

201
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:42,007
THEY IMPROVE THE PRECEPTIAL OF

202
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:42,942
THE COMMUNITY.

203
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:45,344
IF THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO

204
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:47,379
HE NEEDS TO COME UP WITH A

205
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,714
BETTER STRATEGY.

206
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,716
HE HATES THE PRESIDENT AND

207
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:52,952
OPPOSED TO WINNING POLITICALLY.

208
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:56,388
HE'S DOING WHAT HE CAN TO HARM

209
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,424
THE PRESIDENT IN ANY WAY

210
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:58,991
POSSIBLE.

211
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:01,227
>> I TOTALLY AGREE.

212
00:08:01,227 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THEY JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
