00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh he does so I try to be one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,330
like minimalist ish people which means

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,550
partially not<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying a lot of stuff and</font>

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">also trying to be conscious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,320
environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like that so I</font>

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,910
just got started with something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,890
kind of totally brings all that together

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm gonna tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it because</font>

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,990
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the wave of the future so</font>

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,039
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have already heard of bike</font>

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,689
sharing there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font>

12
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies that do it there's b-cycle</font>

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,890
that's in a bunch of cities across the

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,410
u.s. there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> divvy in Chicago there's</font>

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,050
bubbler in Milwaukee but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font>

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,360
concept is you pay for a membership and

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,969
they put these stations with bikes all

18
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,010
around town and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can check them out</font>

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,430
and ride them and then turn them back in

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,020
for a long time I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's a</font>

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,910
great idea but not for me because I have

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,670
a bike that I never ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> ride like I</font>

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,309
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but for most of you here it's</font>

24
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,280
too cold and icy and my bike is all like

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,230
rusted out and old and i dont have<font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

26
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,180
to bring it in my apartment to take care

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it and then every so often somebody</font>

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,570
steals your wheel right<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget your</font>

29
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Katie bike lock or just the whole thing</font>

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a pain in the ass though bike sharing</font>

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,130
the way it works in my city is you sign

32
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,450
up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> membership you get a little card</font>

33
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I pay eight bucks a month there are</font>

34
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,970
stations in abundance you just walk up

35
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one attack your little cars on the</font>

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,009
thing and boom you have a bite now Oh

37
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,049
what if i want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the library</font>

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,180
today let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me take this bike that's</font>

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,610
conveniently been saved for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a block</font>

40
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,009
from my apartment and then write it to

41
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,439
the library<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it back in its holder</font>

42
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,049
right outside the library go in get a

43
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,450
big stack of books put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the large</font>

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,020

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
from work if one of us is out somewhere

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,310
with the car and the other person<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font>

49
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,140
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet them but we don't have two cars</font>

50
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,020
bike there then you leave the bike you

51
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,340
don't have to deal with getting it back

52
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,830
and we can write back together it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

53
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,070
convenient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so cheap I don't have to</font>

a bike<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's so convenient and</font>

61
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,650

using that very bike and we have to

<font color="#E5E5E5">spend less money and resources</font>

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,580
collectively as a community to all have
