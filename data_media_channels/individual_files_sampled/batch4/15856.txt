the DNC is about to pay Hillary Clinton a million dollars to speak what in the world do they think they're gonna get for their million bucks this is like and not to get too personal but this is like that relationship that everybody has probably once in their life where you keep going back to the really really bad ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend it's an abusive relationship but the DNC all right so we we know that Hillary we know from Donna Brazil's book that Hillary was basically controlling the purse strings during the course of the presidential election and controlling the whole damn partner yeah so I don't know I mean I feel like the DNC at this point the way that they are getting manhandled and and bruised and their bank account is being shattered by her at this point the DNC logo needs to be a donkey like on all fours just bending over it's a million bottles woman I googled that image to try to find a mock-up for the new DNC logo and you can't imagine what Google search provided me oh I'm sure I can when I googled donkey bending over it wasn't donkeys I'll tell you that why would you be googling that I'm gonna laugh the day you get home I want the DNC and help them either so I'm not loving the day you get home and guys in windbreakers a hollow out your laptop in a plastic bag it is going to be a glorious glorious day for me when I get that phone call no but but all kidding aside look this is this tells me that the DNC knows they have nobody on the bench right you've got Tom Perez the Chairman who looks like a I don't know it looks like a junkie this guy I'm sorry does looks like the junkies I used to lock up in the Bronx is all gaunt and kind of looks you've got to keep out listen who never met a radical Muslim you in love he's a buddy of Farrakhan they run the party yeah and these are these are the same people who have been not necessarily explicitly saying but alluding to the fact that they would like for some younger chickens to get the spotlight and for Hillary to go away I hate to go back to the relationship analogy again but like that person who breaks up with someone and they're like oh I can find somebody better and come to find out they can't so they go back to them right but here's the thing here's the thing Hilary has no message anymore her entire platform is basically telling you that the only reason you have opinions is because I allow you to speak on my show because you're a lowly woman who can't fend for yourself and you need men yes even clothe you and pay you I mean it's pathetic it's pathetic what do you think of anything we're gonna hear new from Hilary I I think you know every time she does a speaking engagement and she comes out with a new excuse I think to myself all right this has got to be it like she's got a she has to have exhausted her list of excuses I think that she's probably going to talk about more reasons why she didn't win blaming it on on white people and rednecks and deplorable zand and all that but I says the white woman from Arkansas right but she's also she's going to try to find a way to spin things that 80% of America sees has really really good things you know most notably last week capturing five top Isis officials bringing home three prisoners from North Korea she's going to attempt to spend those things the weight basically the way she did all along all of the things that she did that were detrimental to our country during her time as Secretary of State the same way that she spun those things she's gonna try to do that it doesn't that backfire on her Amanda you're out and look you have the show the show here on the rebel you do spokesperson work for large organization you travel to the country you're in DC you're talking to voters mostly conservative like me but we talk to people on both sides of the aisle the working independent the blue dog working Democrat they're tired of that message they don't want to hear it anymore they're they have money in their paychecks they can take their families on vacation they don't want to hear Hillary whining on about identity politics yeah a woman who who I perform singing gigs with who is a bleeding-heart liberal she voted for Hillary Clinton she was all about you know she had like the H sticker on her car and all that kind of stuff and even she has said to me a few times in the last couple months we really just need her to go away this is really important content I want to bring it to you every day so please subscribe to our premium service at www.melrosemoving.com find our petition to have Broward County Florida sheriff's Scott Israel removed by Florida Governor Rick Scott as always thanks so much for watching you have a great weekend I'll see you on Monday
