a judge in Arkansas is granted farmers in the state permission to use the toxic herbicide called dye kamba this summer in spite of all the health warnings about this product you know this again it's another Monsanto story it's like I can't get away from Monsanto their life it's and now they're now that they're there joined with Bayer can you imagine and what have we created here first of all we know their history with roundup is awful and now Dyke Amba is supposed to come in and be better it's worse it it tell us the story it is and uh died cameras been around since I think 1967 it's what they had before roundup and so roundup came out was more effective so they went with that and I can but kind of took to the back shelf but now that all this negative publicity and the horrible studies are coming out about what roundup does to you they're going back to die cam trying to tell farmers no no this isn't anywhere near as bad as a roundup it's not gonna cause those diseases it just calls a whole nother set yeah yeah interesting why they're trying to sell dye kamba and first of all let me go back it was taken off the market initially because of the problem with disease they were worried about the science wasn't good on it their own clinicals showed they weren't it was not good and so then they come up and they come up with with with with roundup and there's n roundup is non-selective it just kills everything in its way unless you have a special seed that's a GMO it won't kill you know they're gonna have I think you and I talked about we're gonna have Roundup Ready people before it's all over but doc camba is just as bad so what happened in this case what the judge has said yeah you can go ahead and spray it we know it the judge understands the science now the judge has been told that this is not that this is not just new science that this stuff has the potential to kill other plants not just not just people but it from an economic standpoint it destroys the farms that are next to die Campbell farm well exactly and that the judge had specifically you know addressed that issue because the only granted permission six different farms in the state of Arkansas and then you had all of the other farmers nearby who had kind of petition that said listen if he sprays die Campbell on his farm even though he's 20 miles down the road we know the science shows us the drift on that is going to kill my farm that is one of the the main concerns aside from the health concerns about die Kamba is that it is easily a little bit more so than roundup it can get into the atmosphere a little easier it travels a little better in the water and the soil and in the air so when you spray it somewhere you have to keep in mind that this thing is actually gonna travel well from a farmer standpoint that's important because it's non-selective right it's not gonna pick out a particular kind of weed to destroy it's gonna go after everything it's going to kill everything and the farmers that are next to these places where there's overspray it's destroying their farms this judge says it's not a problem you know it's okay the real this story really starts this story really starts getting worse when we start seeing this how it's physical harm that die can becauses is the same physical harm that roundup causes the other part of it is when we see the bio persistence of it how long does it stay in the blood we're finding roundup in people's urine that don't have never worked around it we're finding in food 1,200 parts per billion in Cheerios roundup you see and so so I don't know how many free passes we're gonna give Monsanto there's just so politically connected one here's another thing this is one of the major health concerns because dye kamba well I tell you this background up it takes a little while for things to cause problem dye camba can instantaneously cause illnesses and problems in people because its main ingredient is benzoic acid an acid so you breathe into seizures right you will you breathe it in it can cause immediate chemical burns in the throat and lungs if you get it on your skin it can cause chemical burns on the skin so those are instant damages that come from die kamba and the judge knew this but he said you know what go ahead and do it anyway to avoid elected probably an elected judge good-old-boy farmers got him elected so yeah go ahead and kill the go ahead and kill the crops of the other farmers who didn't elect me is this story
