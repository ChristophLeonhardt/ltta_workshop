MOOD. STEVE: IT HAS BEEN RAINING SO MUCH, SKIP BEDELL IN THE NEXT SEGMENT IS BUILDING AN ARK. BRIAN: GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE WAS THERE FOR HISTORIC EVENT IN ISRAEL. GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS. FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. OWN SHOW ON WEEKENDS. DOESN'T HAVE TO WEAR A TIE BECAUSE IT IS NAMED AFTER HIM. GOVERNOR, GREAT TO BE BACK. GREAT TO BE BACK WITH YOU GUYS. ALWAYS A DELIGHT. BRIAN: ARE YOU SURPRISED, HISTORIC EVENT THREE PRESIDENTS PROMISED TO PULL OFF, THIS ONE DOES AND MOST OF THE COVERAGE HOW COLD-HEARTED HAMAS WAS TREATED AND PALESTINIANS WERE TREATED IN GAZA? HAMAS IS MASTERS OF PROPAGANDA. TOO BAD THEY'RE NOT REALLY MASTERS OF TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. IN FACT THEIR ACTIONS KEEP PEOPLE IN POVERTY. THAT IS THEIR GOAL, KEEP THEM UNEDUCATED IMPOVERISHED AND SUBSERVIENT. GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. I'VE BEEN TO THE GAZA BORDER MANY TIMES. THEY CONTINUE TO TRY TO BUILD TUNNELS, GO UNDERGROUND, GET INTO ISRAEL TO KILL ISRAELIS. EVERY TIME THEY BUILD A TUNNEL ON AVERAGE COST $3 MILLION. ISRAELIS BLOW IT UP AND BLOCK IT. THAT IS THREE MILLION DOLLARS COULD HAVE BEEN BUILT FOR HOUSING PROVIDE, FOOD, INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT IN GAZA IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER AND THESE POOR PEOPLE, AND IT IS HORRIFIC WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM BUT HAPPENING A THE HANDS OF HAMAS, BECAUSE THEY ARE USING THEM AS HUMAN SHIELDS. THEY ARE EXPLOITING THEIR POVERTY AND THEIR COMPLETE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE BEING USED FOR. ABBY: WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU TOCK THERE? ONE OF THE MOSIEUR REAL MOMENTS. I WAS GOING TO ISRAEL, THIS MARKS 45th YEAR. MY FIRST TRIP IN 1973 WHEN I WAS 17. SEEING CEREMONY AND CURTAIN COME DOWN AND LOOKING AT WORD EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM, IT SENT CHILLS UP MY SPINE. IT WAS SOMETHING MANY OF US WERE HOPING FOR, PRAYING FOR, WORKING FOR. THIS IS NOT SYMBOLIC. THIS PRESIDENT DESERVES ALL THE CREDIT, ALL THE CREDIT FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT OTHER PRESIDENTS PROMISED BUT DID NOT DELIVER. STEVE: MEANWHILE AS WE'RE WRAPPING UP OUR SEGMENT WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING YOUR VISIT, TALK A LITTLE BIT WHAT IS COMING UP IN THE MONTH OF JUNE. SOUNDS LIKE THE 12th, THE SUMMIT IS STILL ON BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND KIM JONG-UN ALTHOUGH SUDDENLY HE IS KIND OF STIRRING THE POT. HE IS SAYING YOU KNOW, THESE MILITARY EXERCISES, I DON'T LIKE THOSE. I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THEY'RE SUGGESTING THAT I HAVE TO PULL THE PLUG ON ALL THE NUKES. WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES DO YOU THINK? IS HE JUST TRYING TO CONTINUE TO SAY, HEY, I'M OVER HERE, I'M OVER HERE, LOOK AT ME? YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF IT IS BRAVADO AND SABRE-RATTLING NECESSARY FOR HIM TO ASSURE HIS PEOPLE HE IS NOT SURRENDERING, HE IS NOT GIVING UP EVERYTHING. THAT HE IS GOING INTO IT WITH A SENSE OF STRENGTH BUT ALL THAT POSTURING DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT HE HAS BEEN WILLING AND SAID PUBLICLY TO COMPLETELY GET RID OF NUCLEAR ARMS. IF THAT INDEED HAPPENS, IT IS AN AMAZING RESET OF ALL OF ASIA. AND THERE IS NO GUARRANTY AND NOBODY IS BEING SO POLLYANNISH ABOUT IT OH, TO SAY IT IS ALL GOING TO BE FINE, BECAUSE IT MAY NOT. IT MAY FALL APART, AGAIN GIVE DONALD TRUMP CREDIT FOR GETTING US CLOSER THAN ANY PRESIDENT EVER HAS IN DEALING WITH THE SITUATION ON THE PENINSULA. WHEN EVERYBODY WAS CONDEMNING HIM FOR HIS TOUGH TALK, TURNS OUT IT WORKED. HE HAD THE RIGHT INSTINCTS. HE HAS GOT THE RIGHT POLICIES. ABBY: GOVERNOR, NOT ONLY IS THE PRESIDENT NOT GIVEN CREDIT BY CERTAIN FOLKS IN THE MEDIA, SOME ARE ALREADY ASKING THE QUESTION IF THE MEETING DOESN'T TAKE PLACE, IS THAT A FAILURE ON THE PRESIDENT'S PART. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU AS WHERE WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, WE CAN'T AT LEAST COME TOGETHER WANTING SUCCESS FOR NORTH KOREA? THAT IS NOT JUST GOOD FOR US AND PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA, IT IS GOOD FOR THE WORLD. IT IS INCREDIBLY GOOD FOR THE WORLD. ABBY, ONE OF THE THINGS FRUSTRATING TO THE WATCH PEOPLE ON THE LEFT SEEM TO HATE DONALD TRUMP MORE THAN THEY LOVE THE COUNTRY AND LOVE PEACE THAT THIS WORLD DESPERATELY NEEDS. THEY SHOULD BE GRATEFUL IF DONALD TRUMP CAN BRING SOME TYPE OF A RESOLUTION, THEY NEED TO BE GLAD THAT HE DID IT. IF THEY DON'T LIKE HIM THAT'S FINE. THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIKE HIM BUT NEED TO APPRECIATE WHAT HE IS GETTING DONE WHICH BY THE WAY IS QUITE A BIT. BRIAN: IT IS. ALSO A ARE A COUPLE DOZEN JUDGES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE IF YOU COUNT THE SUPREME COURT JUDGE, 22 OVERALL. HE IS PRESSURING THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO DO MORE BEFORE THEY GO ON BREAK. WE'RE BEGINNING TO REALIZE IT IS UP TO MITCH McCONNELL TO START GETTING THESE PEOPLE NOMINATED AND PROCESSED. SOME WITHOUT ANY CONTROVERSY. THEY'RE BEING HELD UP BY DEMOCRATS. DO YOU THINK THE REPUBLICANS, YOU KNOW POLITICIANS, DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GETTING THE MESSAGE? WELL IF THEY DON'T THEY WILL BE GOING HOME. WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS GO AHEAD ROLL THE NOMINATIONS THROUGH, GET APPOINTMENTS FILLED, NOT POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE AGENCIES. THERE ARE SO MANY UNPLUGGED HOLES RIGHT NOW. I HEARD SOME SENATORS SAY THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM WORK ON THE WEEKEND AND WORK OVERTIME. BRIAN: WHY NOT? THAT IS WHAT EVERY ONE ELSE DOES WHEN THEIR JOB ISN'T DONE ON TIME AND ON SCHEDULE AND DEADLINE. WHY NOT SENATORS DO WHAT EVERY OTHER AMERICAN HAS TO DO, GET THE JOB DONE BEFORE THEY GO HOME TO TAKE A VACATION. STEVE: WE'LL SEE WHAT THEY DO.
