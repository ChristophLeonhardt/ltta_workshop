we talk a lot about this but I'm gonna talk about it again because I just think yesterday it's so important after what I saw yesterday all these like a million kids all over the country protesting that the fact that we have the right to barrel harvesting like protesting our Constitution a million no nothing little punks protesting the Constitution and one of the things I talked about is the fact that we have lost all of us even on the right a lot of us have lost the reasons why we believe what we believe and so when you lose the reason for something everything becomes narrative nothing becomes argument nothing becomes logic nothing becomes actual debate it just becomes narrative and so children right make for good narrative and just to show you how we lose the narrative we lose the narrative remember Hillary Clinton was in Mumbai and she made those stupid remarks about how all deplorable you all are your interesting remarks because basically she was saying if you weren't rich you didn't vote for her so she was the candidate of the rich she was admitting she was the Kansas of the rich but the other thing she said was this isn't some insulting things about about white women white women didn't vote for her because their husbands wouldn't wouldn't let them so here's what she said we do not do well with white men and we don't do well with married white women and part of that is a an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband your boss your son whoever believes you should so there's the icon of feminism right who got where she is because of her husband the only reason she's anybody is because of her husband
