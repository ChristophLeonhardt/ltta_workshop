voting for Hezbollah the result of the general election in Lebanon boosts the power of the party the Shia Muslim group supported by Iran is already influential in Lebanon so will more power complicate the complex politics of the Middle East this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Mohammed Jim June corruption power cuts rubbish piling up on the streets and looking after huge numbers of refugees from Syria just some of the challenges facing politicians in Lebanon's newly elected parliament Sunday's parliamentary election was the first in nine years and Hezbollah was the winner the Shia muslin party with a military wing which is backed by Iran won a small majority in parliament and Delta blow to Prime Minister Saad Hariri who's supported by predominantly Sunni Saudi Arabia Herrera is expected to form the next government despite his movement losing a third of its seats it remains the largest sunny Block in parliament we'll hear from our guests in a moment but first XANA jota reports from bade woods there was a clear winner in Lebanon's election Hezbollah and its political allies won the majority of seats in parliament it's being seen by some as a victory for Iran the Shia group is backed by Tehran it's the only Lebanese party that has an armed wing and its electoral gains further empowers it politically Hezbollah's leader called for cooperation before the poll I stressed that there is a reality in Lebanon and that is that no one can eliminate the other even if we have disagreements we want political stability we need to cooperate the general elections was a loss for Lebanon's prime minister Saud L had he no longer heads the largest bloc in the legislature but he still retains the majority of seats allocated to Sonny Muslims howdini faced opposition from within his own community some accused him of being too lenient with Hezbollah which is fighting in their bring Syria when asked if he plans to change that approach the prime minister said the focus should be on development and improving the Lebanese economy I disagree with them on many issues and will continue to disagree with them but what do I tell the Lebanese people will we stop working on services like electricity water roads and instead focus on political challenge Lebanon can't handle political crises Hariri clearly indicating his willingness to continue working with his political rivals he has led a national unity government since late 2016 a cabinet that includes members of Hezbollah in the last election in 2009 it was the pro-western pro Saudi Alliance headed by saddle hadid II that won the majority of seats in parliament since then Iran's influence has been growing not just here in Lebanon but across the region and it has been at the expense of Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia used to play a major role in Lebanese politics Saudi Arabia was busy with other conflicts in the region like Kaman the war there is a priority for Riyadh also Saudi Arabia was aware that there are lies in Lebanon were no longer United and they couldn't be a forced to confront Hezbollah but Riyadh will not leave the ground for Iran for now however there is little indication that Lebanon is heading towards political instability Lebanese politicians are talking about putting their differences aside and uniting now that the election is over zenyk under Al Jazeera Beirut Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political party in Lebanon with a military wing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran helped form Hezbollah during Lebanon civil war in the 1980s Hezbollah published its political manifesto or open letter in 1985 outlining Israel and the US as the enemy the thigh of a cord that ended the Lebanese civil war in 1989 called for the disarmament of militias fighters were allowed to keep their weapons when Hezbollah rebranded itself as what it called an islamic resistance fighting Israel's occupation after Israeli forces withdrew from Lebanon eighteen years ago Hezbollah refused to disarm and continue to strengthen its military wing Hezbollah successfully participated in national elections for the first time in 1992 and started to play an active role in Lebanese politics when Lebanese government leaders moved to shut down Hezbollah's private telecommunications network in 2008 it responded by fighting Sunni groups and seizing much of the capital Beirut western states Israel and many Arab countries designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization it sent thousands of fighters to Syria to fight for Syrian President Bashar al-assad Hezbollah's involvement in Syria's Civil War has provoked criticism and sharpened sectarian tensions in Lebanon let's bring in our guests joining us in Beirut Khalid Hamad a retired general in the Lebanese army in Doha Ibrahim free hat he's an associate professor in international conflict resolution at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies and also in Beirut Kemal was a founder of the center of American Strategic Studies a warm welcome to you all now camel I want to ask you first how big a loss was this for Saad Hariri and his future bloc and why was his showing so poor in his stronghold areas of course he lost 1/3 of his coalition it's a major loss for his coalition but in the end Lebanon is built on consensus and I'm sure maybe the political process that going forward will find a place for him and maybe he returned as a prime minister of Lebanon with accommodation for certain points that highlight maybe the importance of the again an importance of a real plan for the economic condition and Lebanon and light of the major deficit that we have in Lebanon and the corruption that we have in Lebanon so in total yes he lost some influence and probably it gives way for rethinking the whole election law that was enacted very fast and was not actually well liked by the Lebanese people because very low turnout for and came out for this election Khalid was one of the factors contributing to mr. Hariri's poor showing this time a sense amongst his Sunni Muslim supporters in Lebanon that he wasn't doing enough to counter Hezbollah first of all I think mr. hurriedly by maintaining his aliens with the political group of the President and by let's say the limit limitation and the limited cooperation with him with his former allied in the 14 of March I think the people the Sunni people they they have no longer confidence in Hariri choices so for that they are not they were not very very motivated to go and to the elections and to elect mr. Hariri and meanwhile they don't have other choices for that we see this low voter turnout and I think also there is a missed confidence between and misunderstanding also between for example mr. Hariri and mr. John blood and mr. Raja where we see in the elections that there were there was no cooperation between them and I think the aliens between sir Herrera and mr. Gibran Basile yeah that that decline you know all all the others political groups let mr. Hari a peg a lot and that's what mr. John blood told told told him yesterday during a short speech he said that the tithe is the least of the sacrifices of many p.m. EDT Benny's people and did not upload to Hariri to to decline this this this agreement and to decline the authorities of the position of the prime minister ok brahim you heard how that they're talking a lot about the political forces in Lebanon about alliances that have to be made based on what you're seeing now do you believe that sad Hariri's prime ministership is under threat or do you think that he will continue in that role well thank you I think what my colleagues in Beirut mentioned are important factors that could explain his loss in the selections but it's not only about the domestic factors actually there is an important regional factor here that that happened or affected the selections which is actually that Hariri was significantly undermined in his latest crisis with Saudi Arabia I mean Hariri he delivered his resignation from Riyadh and then he withdrew his resignation and then we don't know what happened and then the French President had to mediate or intervene to have him leave Riyadh so this all actually as a leader this all significantly undermined Hariri and the questioned his leadership as a Sunni leader in Lebanon what explains this actually is that Hariri lost five seats in Tripoli in the north in his sunni place for his Sunni rivals Makati former ex prime minister won the Sunni leader in the in the north actually won four seats so this is undermining his political leadership was a major factor I think that explains what to him now whether he's going to secure his or keep his job his political future now in Lebanon or this is going to end there I think for the time being we are going to see him continuing but again with much less power than used to be in the past for simple reason one is that he still has about 21 seats and Parliament so he still considered the second party there and yeah you know because of that also the Lebanese election role low that a Sunni Prime Minister will have to be in in this position so I think for the time being it's possible that we see him continuing but unfortunately with more of a compromised position undermined position compared to what he had in the past okay Cameron Ibrahim there was just really highlighting how delicate how fragile the political balance is and it really has been for such a long time in Lebanon so what is the immediate result of these elections what does it do to that fragile balance well actually this is a Lebanese building consensus no matter what the result will be in the end the Lebanese has to come and have to sit on on a table and that's probably well we heard from everybody whether from the prime minister or the Speaker of the Parliament or from the leader of Hezbollah or from Gibran Basile everybody has to come to the table and they have to look forward because we have a lot of issues that has to be addressed and has to be addressed immediately we don't have a lot of time because the economy and that that clock is ticking on Lebanon so any delay in forming a government or playing politics at this time it will not really set very well with the Lebanese economy because the issue really at this time when you have it that close to 80 1 billion dollars and you have interest on the debt and you have a huge deficit and you have a very weak economy and you want to give a good picture to the Internet community in light of that commitment to to help Lebanon economically so any delay in forming a government they were not set very well with the Lebanese and would not sit very well for the future of Lebanon said that I think there is certain issue that has to be dealt with and I think probably the formation of the government probably will hang on cobble issue whose can a hold certain position within the government especially the Finance Ministry I think it's gonna be a hot issue probably if it doesn't resolve quickly they probably will delay the formation of the government okay Khalid when you're talking about the economy the economy in Lebanon has been in you know a dire condition for a while now and one of the things that was really campaigned upon one of the issues in the the in the run-up to this election was that was trying to get the economy into a better place now clearly government officials there wanted to encourage much more people to come out and cast a vote but at the end of the day it was less than fifty percent why is that is it a lack of faith in the politicians is it the new electoral law that people found very confusing or is it a lot more than that as well no first of all I think it's there is a mistrust between the Lebanese people the Lebanese citizens and the politicians this is first second the Lebanese people they tried this this political class and they believe that nothing will will be changing even if they will have a new Parliament everybody knows that even this in a new military a member of Parliament's they are they are they are coming from the same political parties of the same political political groups so they don't believe that something interesting will will be changing second I think that the issue of affordable law nobody nobody believed that president Hariri will be ready with his with his Ally I mean the President of the Republic they will be able to meet the challenges and the programs that mr. Herrera and the president posed before for example with this that's political loss of loss of president of Prime Minister how for example he will be able to discuss for example that strategy of defense in Lebanon I mean here how they what is the the plan to be discussed who we which can contain really the weapons of Hezbollah and even will be mr. holiday will be able to deploy the Lebanese armed forces on the eastern borders and stop the smuggling of arms and people and weapons all these big questions the Lebanese people they don't believe that the new government will be able to solve it or to face it second I think everyone interrupt you but I but I want to pick out something you were saying and also asked Ibrahim about it he's talking about Hezbollah and security of Lebanon and I want to ask you a bra heem what does this victory by Hezbollah mean when it comes to Iran's role in Lebanon and if it is really consolidated power there well definitely actually this is a major victory for Hezbollah and his allies and this is another place that where Iran is consolidating their its influence in in the region and let's keep in mind that we are now seeing this what's called the ultimate deal that trump saudi israel alliance that's being formed which the mean the core reason of this alliance is confronting Iran in the region and in places like Lebanon Syria Yemen and then other places so for for what we're seeing now actually and this is probably one reason that played really against Hariri is that with allies like donor the Trump you don't need enemies because that could explain why this there is you know poor doing of his elections so I think now we are seeing this whole deal about confronting Iran as being is not making progress in in Lebanon in one place but also at the same time let's not overestimate or the readings of this victory or of this gaining of influence additional gain of reference for Iran because at the end of the day I don't think this is going to affect the regional alliance and you know the ultimate deal and the way that the United States and Saudi Arabia you know is proceeding on that level but it's a strong sign to show that this is not the goal the whole objective about this Saudi American Israel alliance is not making progress and it's giving additional support and an additional influence for Iran in Lebanon in a popular voting that's making all this progress at a time when we are seeing additional or escalation of the threats between Lebanon and between Hezbollah and Israel Iran and Israel in Syria or in other places so I think this has to be taken into consideration but to a certain level within the what's going on now okay Scarlett let me go back to you and pick up on what Ibrahim was saying because Israeli officials have been quoted in the past few days saying that the results of these elections essentially proved that there's no distinction between Lebanon and Hezbollah so what do you think Israel might do now I think the Lebanon as the button field is not the appropriate one for a Khan a future confrontation between Lebanon and Israel I think Iran and Israel both of them they are satisfied about the resolution 1701 and I think Israel now has no threats from the Lebanese from south Lebanon and Hezbollah is satisfied and his pushing forward and to enlarge his impact and his efficiency inside the political life in Lebanon so I think there will be no confrontation in between Lebanon and Israel through our our thousand borders I think Syria now is the appropriate place for a confrontation a very wide confrontation between Iran and Israel and between United States and Iran and I think what that this Israeli declaration means nothing for us we heard since years and we are sure that 1701 is very very appropriate for the peace of the northern regions in Israel coming let me ask you to pick up on that I want to ask you first Hezbollah showing comes at a time of you know really heightened tension between Iran and Israel's I want to ask you what you think comes next on that front but also I want to ask you what you think is going to happen with regard to Syria and Lebanon in light of Hezbollah's victory I think the major issues that are probably a part of the agenda for to bring back the refugee that they are in Lebanon the Syrian refugee - back to Syria I think this is going to be a major issue in the coming in the coming days and in the coming months which they will move form a government because there is a division among this issue how we deal with the refugees as far as Hezbollah and the security of Lebanon I think nothing will change I think the election probably reinforced the position of Hezbollah that his weapon is a deterrence and it can be used only for deterrence against any Israeli aggression I think the situation today probably will hear some major announcement from the Trump administration we don't know where this will take us but my understanding are the way I look at it if there is going to be a confrontation between the Israeli in Syria it will not stop in Syria it will be a regional war and Lebanon will not be will not be out of this confrontation sorry let me ask you how problematic are the results of this election especially for the u.s. which considers Hezbollah to be a terrorist group and also for Europe in their dealings with Lebanon I think the the America administration will be waiting until the formation of the new government and we'll see if such Hariri will be able really to to to meet all the promises that he made before to the to the president McCrone and to the president Trump and from my point of view I think mr. Hariri if he will be cold and I think he will be called to form the new government I think he will face many problems starting from what what said Hassan Nasrallah yesterday about how the new Parliament has to protect the resistance and Hezbollah militia and about the issue of mr. neighborly about the the Ministry of Finance that it's a one at one of the acquired rights of the Shia community and also the I think another issue will raise up also is about relations between Lebanon and Syria and this point will be will form a big conflict between mr. Hariri and the president down I'm sorry to interrupt it's just a word we're just almost out of time I have only have time for one more question and I want to get the last word here today but I am of course these elections there was a huge drive to try to get the youth in Lebanon to come out and vote to vote for independent lists to vote for independent candidates the end of the day that didn't happen why do you think that is well that is a very important question and I think there is a huge issue I called this election that an issue of accountability the people holding their governments accountable for a widespread corruption that's everywhere in the Lebanese government and we heard about of course the you know notorious waste management issue that Lebanon experienced under this government and under this political system we have new keep in mind that the elections in a percentage dropped from 54% in 2009 the last one to now 49 percent actually which means about 5% did not go to vote because of this disbelief in the melodical establishment and as a result also we're seeing that an independent a journal and independent journalist from the NGO as Paulo Yacoubian also making it as an independent outside this political system so I think that that was a word said to the government that there is a mistress issue holding the government accountable and holding her really accountable because he's at the end of the day he is the Prime Minister and this crisis also he takes part of the blame for whether it's the corruption or I am I'm gonna have to stop you there we've run out of time gentlemen we thank you very much thanks for all our guest Ibrahim free hot camel wasnae and Khalid Hamada and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our web site aljazeera.com and for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me Mohammed Jim Jim and the whole team here bye for now
