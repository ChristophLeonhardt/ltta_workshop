WILL MITCH MCCONNELL BRING
THE GRAHAM CASSIDY HEALTHCARE
REPLACEMENT BOW TO A VOTE?
THAT
IS A QUESTION PEOPLE ARE ASKING
TODAY AFTER IT TURNS OUT THAT
JOHN MCCAIN MADE A VERY
TRANSPARENT AND OVERT STATEMENT
REGARDING WHAT HE PLANS ON
DOING WITH HIS VOTE.
HE WILL NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE
GRAHAM CASSIDY PLAN.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME MORE
DETAILS.
HE SAID, THIS IS A STATEMENT BY
JOHN MCCAIN.
JOHN 
MCCAIN IS FIRM IN HIS
DECISION.
THE REASON WHY SENATE
REPUBLICANS ARE RUSHING TO VOTE
IS BECAUSE AFTER SEPTEMBER 30,
THEY WILL NEED MORE THAN A
SIMPLE MAJORITY IN ORDER TO
PASS.
SO 
IT 
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY
ARE GOING TO HAVE THE VOTES
NECESSARY.
FIRST OF ALL, RAND PAUL IS
AGAINST THE BILL BECAUSE HE
IS NOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH.
HE WOULD LIKE TO GET MORE PEOPLE
OFF OF HEALTHCARE JUST TO
BE CLEAR.
AND MCCAIN COULDN'T BE CLEAR
THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE
FOR IT.
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THREE
REPUBLICANS, THEY
DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE THE VOTE.
BUT IS IT REALLY OVER?
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE RAND PAUL
HAS BEEN A SOLID NOTE THROUGHOUT
BECAUSE HE THINKS IT PERTAINS TO
MUCH TO OBAMA CARE.
AND SUSAN COLLINS IS LEANING
AGAINST IT.
THE ONLY PERSON WHO I AM
POSITIVE WILL VOTE NO IS
SUSAN COLLINS.
RAND PAUL WILL TWEAK IT OR
SOMETHING.
HE VOTED FOR THE OTHER ONE.
NOW, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME.
THIS IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF
DOING IT AND RAN PAUL
PARTICULARLY OBJECTS TO THIS
WAY.
AND JOHN MCCAIN, I SENT A TEXT
AROUND THAT I WANTED $10 � I'M
NOT SAYING HE WILL VOTE FOR
IT, BUT NOW HE HAS SAID NO
WHICH THERE IS NO AMBIGUITY IN
THE STATEMENT.
BUT HE WILL EQUIVOCATE BECAUSE
AT SOME POINT IN THE NEXT WEEK
HE WILL SAY WELL, IF WE CAN GET
A RUSH SCORE I WANT TO SEE IT.
LIKE, HE WILL SAY SOMETHING THAT
PUTS HIM MAY BE BACK IN PLACE.
HE STILL MY VOTE NO AT THE END
BUT MY HUNCH IS HE WILL
EQUIVOCATE.
I THINK THERE IS ONE THING OR
ONE PERSON THAT JOHN MCCAIN
HATES MORE THAN THE AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT, AND THAT IS
DONALD TRUMP.
HE HATES DONALD TRUMP.
HE COULD HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN TO
THE WIRE I GUESS.
BUT HE MIGHT VOTE AGAINST HIS
FRIENDS, BUT HE MIGHT VOTE
LINDSEY GRAHAM.
SO HE WAS SAYING TO LINDSEY
GRAHAM LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO DO
THIS AT THE LAST SECOND AGAIN.
BUT YOU ARE MY FRIEND SO I'M
JUST TELLING YOU NOW, I AM
NOT THERE.
MAYBE THAT IS IT?
THE REASON THAT LINDSEY GRAHAM
IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS IS
TO GET JOHN MCCAIN'S VOTE.
AND LINDSEY GRAHAM'S LIFELONG
COMMITMENT TO HEALTH CARE.
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT.
AND THE DONORS REALLY WANT
THIS, THAT IS A DIFFERENT STORY.
AND PART OF THE REASON IS THAT
PEOPLE JUST NEVER TALK ABOUT THE
OTHER PART OF THE BILL WHERE IT
GIVES HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS TO THE RICH.
SO IN OTHER WORDS GIVE ME THE
TAX CUTS DAMMIT.
WHAT IPO YOU GUYS TO BE MY
REPRESENTATIVES, IF YOU WILL.
THAT LEADS TO THE REASON � THE
REASON I BRING THAT UP IS A
LEADS TO PART OF MY THEORY ABOUT
JOHN MCCAIN WHICH IS THAT IT IS
CONNECTED TO MY OVERALL THEORY
OF REVERSE POLITICS.
HE IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO
RUN AGAIN.
AND NOW HE IS UNTETHERED FROM
THE DONORS.
I LOVE IT.
THE MINUTE YOU DO THAT YOU CAN
VOTE YOUR CONVICTION AND DO
THE RIGHT WAY.
AND I THINK THAT IS PARTLY WHAT
IS HAPPENING RIGHT HERE.
THIS GETS TO WHAT WILL
ULTIMATELY BE OUR LONG
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE INFLUENCE
OF MONEY IN POLITICS.
BUT THE DIRECT INFLUENCE.
THROUGH BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN,
BARACK OBAMA'S CAMPAIGN
TEACH THESE GUYS LIKE YOU DON'T
NEED MONEY FROM EVERYBODY.
YOU CAN RAISE MONEY ELSEWHERE.
NO, IT DEFINITELY DID NOT.
I DON'T THINK I'M WRONG, AND
MAYBE BILL CASSIDY CAN'T RAISE
MONEY THAT WAY.
IT LOOKS LIKE THE CLIENT HAS YET
TO PUT THE MAKE UPON.
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT
DESCRIPTION OF BILL CASSIDY.
IF THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT
DYNAMICS AT PLAY HERE, ONE
IS BERNIE SANDERS RAN FOR
PRESIDENT.
SO YOU GET A TON OF FREE MEDIA.
BILL CASSIDY AND OTHERS THAT
WERE RUNNING IN THE RACE IN
LOUISIANA ARE NOT GOING TO GET
FREE MEDIA SO THEY NEED �
THEY THINK THEY NEED THE DONOR
MINUTES WON.
THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS GO
GET SMALL DONORS BECAUSE
THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR SMALL
DONORS.
CASSIDY HAS NEVER DONE THAT IN
HIS CAREER, SO THEY CAN
POSSIBLY RAISE THE KIND OF SMALL
DONOR MONEY THAT THEY NEED.
DID ANYONE LEARN A LESSON FROM
BERNIE SANDERS CAMP?
YEAH.
I DID.
THAT IS WHY WE STARTED JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS WHICH IS RELYING
ON SMALL DONORS.
