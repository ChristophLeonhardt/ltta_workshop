I'll get the next one
our third package
I wonder what's inside good thing we
have tools here
so we have juice condensed milk hot
sauce and ginger is there any ginger
here yes we have soy sauce and I see
wasabi here
Nimmo what do you know about wasabi you
usually was RB with sushi okay what else
do we need to make sushi with well a gue
so work with wasabi I don't think so Hey
look Nemo has rice we also have super
hot chilli sauce will it work with
wasabi
but what about bubu scanner Lucas alone
takes intense milk jams won't work
either
we also need seaweed
let's see what our wives sent us hmm
what about Black Caviar it got stuck
there there it is here's our Black
Caviar
Oh
and using our appointee there are
numerous sushi restaurants in Japan and
across the world reborn me nausea coma
but in Japan we make sushi at home
so I can say it's a very popular dish in
Japan
who's doing a book well what's there to
add to what our Japanese brother said we
have pretty much everything really just
this is what Nima brought it's rice
authentic Japanese sushi rice the
peaceful opals and we have what our
families and our wives sent us seaweed
soy sauce ginger and wasabi the rest we
found lying around like the caviar
how did it end up here on the ISS I
guess one of the previous crews didn't
finish it so we got lucky I think that's
enough talking let's just watch Nima
make sushi
right we take the fish
we open the soy sauce
oh ho
from what you out there's a lot of it
you take the little fish that would be
better
which religion
and then he goes with magnets you can
squeeze it out but it might be a lot
take the little fish
this will drink later
we need wasabi that's right
it was very conveniently in space not
only bread but also for example soy
sauce comes in small portions
beware the bus
some help here please Nemo make a
picture smile
let's see per sabe
