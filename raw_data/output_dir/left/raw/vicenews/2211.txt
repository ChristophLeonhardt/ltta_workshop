6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,230
the area and his plan is to secretly

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,969
film<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hunters in case we do anything</font>

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,369
illegal so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of my standard</font>

9
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,100
kit if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like binoculars obviously</font>

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,710
camouflage gloves leafy pattern and it's

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,070
finished off nicely with her leave your

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,609
head<font color="#E5E5E5"> covering yeah this is sort of</font>

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,650
standard dress for a investigator if you

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,640
like so what sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of illegal activity</font>

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
are you looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well we're</font>

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">really looking just to see what what</font>

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,980
they're doing I mean if a deer came

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,719
running down and there's more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,570
dogs behind it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a good</font>

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">chance that's an illegal activity going</font>

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,440
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly we've heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,870
hunting horn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Huntsman already</font>

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,879
so they're certainly looking for a stag

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">down in that woodland down below us yes</font>

25
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,900
yes receiving yeah the last two of the

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,950
vehicles are going down off the hill

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,570
they'll be passing you in a minute

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,600
coming down the track and over nice

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,909
camouflage camera so when this dagger

30
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,490
actually dies how does it die when the

31
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,560
stag stop running the idea is then they

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,090
come up to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they'll shoot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,159
either through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chest accuse the</font>

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,990
heart or sometimes shoot it through the

35
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,540
head and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole chase is illegal in</font>

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,939
most circumstances right well in most

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,680
circumstances and they will make all

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,659
sorts of excuses as to why it's legal

39
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,950
don't they might say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,070
carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> out some sort of research or</font>

41
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,909
that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rescue an injured</font>

42
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,399
animal or they might say or they're

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,810
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flush it to guns and I just</font>

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't shoot it at the time so the</font>

45
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,950
dogs just got<font color="#CCCCCC"> away and chased it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,970
they come all sorts of excuses

47
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,320
this covert footage from 2013 shows

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,350
hunters using dogs to kill a stag three

49
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,790
hunters were charged<font color="#E5E5E5"> with illegal</font>

50
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,770
hunting but<font color="#E5E5E5"> prosecutors dropped the</font>

51
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,690
charges in November the men said they

52
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,350
were hunting for research purposes so

53
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,970
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the worst thing that you've seen</font>

54
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,790
while monitor in one of these hunts it's

55
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,560
the way the people stand there and I

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,450
stand over the dead animal and then they

57
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,400
poke it and they project and the

58
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,350
Huntsman cuts the God's aid for the dogs

59
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,680
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then people go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and now pay him to</font>

60
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,150
have a bit of the liver or they'll pay

61
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,090
him to have the feet off the deer so

62
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,340
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a trophy and that</font>

63
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of human strange dark side of human</font>

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,060
behavior it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> often quite</font>

65
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,920
upsetting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to think that most</font>

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,740
people moved on from that to David

67
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,300
Cameron has threatened to overturn the

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,670
2004 Hunting Act what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think will</font>

69
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">be the result of that well it would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

70
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">great pity if he did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> manage to overturn</font>

71
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act I mean it was this momentous</font>

72
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,440
achievement the league campaign for 80

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,810
years to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in place you know it's</font>

74
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,160
an important piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> animal welfare</font>

75
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,190
legislation for Britain and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to</font>

76
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,800
overturn it because some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of his friends</font>

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
go hunting and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like the Act</font>

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,780
would seem a great travesty really

79
00:03:17,700 --> 00:00:00,000
you
