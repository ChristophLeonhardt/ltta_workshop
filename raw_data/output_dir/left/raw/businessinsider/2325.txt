1
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,190
next question is from Jonathan will

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,049
Microsoft become a credible player in

3
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,960
the mobile OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wars what Microsoft what</font>

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,480
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> s OS with Microsoft deliver or</font>

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,539
what have they delivered in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past you</font>

6
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the answer that question is</font>

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,949
becoming no more each day Microsoft has

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,399
had a history of decent mobile os's

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,680
dating until about two thousand seven

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,030
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came out and made</font>

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,219
everybody looks silly and since then

12
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've made some minor tweaks to</font>

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,940
windows mobile but nothing major that

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,280
would put it on the same level as iphone

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,420
android or even palm webos so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,520
that the new microsoft windows mobile

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,620
seven which is based on kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zune</font>

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,460
the new zune HD framework kind of

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,750
looking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is actually pretty</font>

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">good but that's not going to help that</font>

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,070
much if they can't get mobile

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,110
manufacturers and carriers and

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,150
developers to embrace Microsoft again

24
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,580
and as Apple and Android really kind of

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,140
kick everyone else's butts in that field

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,330
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard for Microsoft</font>

27
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,340
even with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that money behind it even</font>

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,590
with its past relationships even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

29
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,390
some weird deal at signed with LG

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,549
recently to catch up where it's falling

31
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,830
behind so I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say the odds of</font>

32
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,450
Microsoft becoming an important player

33
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,400
here you can never count<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out they</font>

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,619
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy rim they could easily buy</font>

35
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,210
palm they could do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font>

36
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">become a big player through acquisition</font>

37
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,409
organically I think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really</font>

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,259
take a miracle for them so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

39
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,970
good windows mobile seven is I get a

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,229
hunch we're going to hear a lot about it

41
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,270
next month at the Mobile World Congress

42
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,880
in Barcelona I get a feeling they're

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,140
going to have to ship it by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year otherwise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably too</font>

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,140
late and they'll have to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> some one</font>

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,009
and from Adam why do many large

47
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,259
companies continue to create lousy

48
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,000
products rather than focus on fewer

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,399
better products and one of the examples

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,380
he gave with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sony Ericsson which used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,000
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> great phones and I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three of</font>

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,460
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> which I love for many years you</font>

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">know has this problem where they have 50</font>

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,848
different phones or<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred phones a</font>

55
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,410
year Motorola had this very problem

56
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,300
where they had six operating systems

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,540
into

58
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,629
development and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the counter</font>

59
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:17,430
example which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple or palm where</font>

60
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,099
they have to you know one phone two

61
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,530
phones something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of the</font>

62
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons for in the mobile industry</font>

63
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,120
specifically is the way that phones are

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
distributed worldwide and that is in a

65
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,560
carrier system so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Motorola</font>

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,780
may make four versions of the same phone

67
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,140
with very minor tweaks so one at verizon

68
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,030
one at t-mobile one at sprint one at 80

69
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm sure that this is a hassle for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,500
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back end but this is something</font>

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,000
where they have customers who want to

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,950
have something differentiated they want

73
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,950
to say they have the only you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Q 302</font>

74
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,859
C model they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something</font>

75
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:54,000
different to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to market to</font>

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,669
consumers is it the best way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

77
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,560
things I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,419
out especially his<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone's become more</font>

79
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,810
expensive and smarter is no and I think

80
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see things</font>

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,849
like the droid which motorola is using

82
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:11,010
as the basis for a phone for verizon

83
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,099
here but also overseas I think we'll

84
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,900
start to see more stuff like the iPhone

85
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,870
where a manufacturer will have one phone

86
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,760
that they sell on multiple carriers if

87
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,049
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> palm they're doing it with</font>

88
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,690
the palm pre plus and a pixi plus it's

89
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,239
very similar verizon and sprint but the

90
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,099
bottom line is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we'll see simpler</font>

91
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,919
product lines fewer operating systems /

92
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,790
manufacturer because<font color="#E5E5E5"> software is really</font>

93
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,979
what sets phones apart these days not

94
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,169
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> color of the case or the way the</font>

95
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,489
keyboard looks or something like that

96
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,949
it's the it's the apps and the operating

97
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,280
system so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the companies</font>

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't adapt that will have problems</font>

99
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">nokia has had problems lately they've</font>

100
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,720
been slow to adapt to that and Apple of

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,010
course has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been very successful with</font>

102
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,010
that and the last question comes from

103
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,870
Eric W who asks what are your thoughts

104
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,609
on the whole mobile social thing

105
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,310
regarding Foursquare and Yelp and

106
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,199
gowalla do you think Facebook is going

107
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,590
to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on location soon so what is this</font>

108
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,620
mobile social thing foursquare is kind

109
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,509
of the example that everyone uses right

110
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:17,970
now because they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the newest and</font>

111
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,649
we're one of the newest and one of the

112
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,719
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular in this little niche and</font>

113
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,930
this niche is I have a phone that has

114
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,660
is a powerful processor and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unit</font>

115
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,280
in it I can use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell my friends</font>

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">where I am I can find out where my</font>

117
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,110
friends are I can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures and</font>

118
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,380
information with my location tag to it

119
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,190
and share that with my friends and only

120
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,110
now this stuff has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around for a</font>

121
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,220
little while there's companies like

122
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">loopt that have been selling this sort</font>

123
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,910
of stuff for years but now we're

124
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,889
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into a period where</font>

125
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,600
there's actually practical uses for it

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,759
where foursquare<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people who are</font>

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,190
social and who go out actually find

128
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,479
something useful out of this it is

129
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,300
helpful to know where your friends are

130
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,440
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to call them or message</font>

131
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,240
them especially if they're really

132
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,800
proactive about filling out this

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,270
information recently there's been a push

134
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,039
from other companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have other</font>

135
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,080
social aspects of them to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this</font>

136
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,380
mobile area so Yelp for example which

137
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,660
has a very popular website and a popular

138
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,849
iPhone app has added this kind of

139
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:24,240
check-in activity to the yelp app and a

140
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,190
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were wondering ok it's</font>

141
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,960
Foursquare already dead is Yelp going to

142
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,330
come kick their butts I don't think Yelp

143
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,680
is going to be the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gives them</font>

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,409
much trouble Yelp obviously is bigger

145
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,330
than four square but Yelp who's actually

146
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,430
friends with people on yelp I mean if

147
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,199
you're friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people on Yelp it's</font>

148
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,120
people that you know from Yelp and those

149
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,199
are not the people you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

150
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
hanging<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with in person so I think</font>

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest trouble for foursquare could</font>

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,930
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really where</font>

153
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,030
people are friends with the people they

154
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,550
associate with in real life<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter you</font>

155
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,259
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of follow people that you know from</font>

156
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet Yelp you hang out with</font>

157
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">people I don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do on Yelp</font>

158
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,419
you talk to people who go the same

159
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,830
restaurant as you do that you probably

160
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,080
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but Facebook is the site</font>

161
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
where you interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you do</font>

162
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,130
know who you would hang out with who

163
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'd want to run into at a bar so if</font>

164
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,180
Facebook Ads some sort of check-in

165
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,490
location thing that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble for</font>

166
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,530
foursquare when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to Mark</font>

167
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">Zuckerberg about that over a year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago he</font>

168
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:21,270
said location is important to me but I

169
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,490
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're figuring out how to put</font>

170
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,960
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into facebook there's obviously a lot</font>

171
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,460
of privacy issues around that

172
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,400
infrastructure issues and security and

173
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,530
things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that they</font>

174
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be screwing over some of their</font>

175
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,419
developer partners like Foursquare so at

176
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,219
some point I imagine Facebook will do

177
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:38,560
some

178
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,970
around this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're more focused</font>

179
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,630
now in advertising and payments but as

180
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,550
this continues<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow as more people</font>

181
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,770
use foursquare and gowalla and services

182
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,450
like that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook will</font>

183
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,919
have to do something eventually and

184
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,290
that's it next week we'll have another

185
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,630
