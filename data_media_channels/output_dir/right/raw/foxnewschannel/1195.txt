1
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,449
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:14,318
EVERY YEAR IT'S APPLE'S BIG

3
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:15,419
CONFERENCE THAT GOES ON FOR FOUR

4
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,487
OR FIVE DAYS.

5
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:17,788
THE KICKOFF TODAY IS ABOUT

6
00:00:17,788 --> 00:00:19,724
TRYING TO CURE iPHONE ADDICTION.

7
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:21,259
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH VESTED

8
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:24,529
INTERESTS APPLE'S CREATOR WILL

9
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:27,331
HAVE TO TRY TO WEAN YOU, MAYBE

10
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,966
YOUR KIDS OFF OF THESE PHONES OR

11
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:29,767
LIMIT THEIR TIME.

12
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:32,336
BUT PSYCHO THERAPIST AND OFF OF

13
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,906
DISCONNECTED, HOW TO RECONNECT

14
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,910
OUR DIGITALLY DISTRACTED KIDS,

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,478
TOM, EASIER SAID THAN DONE,

16
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:40,811
RIGHT?

17
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:42,947
>> IT IS.

18
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:45,750
WE'RE COMPLETELY ENVELOPED AS A

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,083
SOCIETY.

20
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,185
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE

21
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:51,522
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

22
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:52,690
>> Neil: I HAVE TWO TEENAGE BOYS

23
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,126
THAT ARE ADDICTED TO THIS.

24
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:57,161
TO GET THEM OFF IS TOUGH.

25
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:01,165
>> THE PROBLEM IS, WE GIVE THEM

26
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:01,666
FREE REIGN.

27
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,500
TAKE THE PHONE.

28
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,935
LET IT GO TO SCHOOL WITH YOU.

29
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:05,636
WE HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT

30
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:06,704
APPROACH, THIS IS AMBITIOUS.

31
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:07,305
I UNDERSTAND.

32
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:09,574
WE GET TO THE POINT THAT IF OUR

33
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:11,142
CHILDREN WANT TO USE THE PHONE

34
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:12,843
FOR SOME REASON, THEY COME ASK

35
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:13,110
US.

36
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,013
LIKE ICE CREAM OUT OF THE

37
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:17,481
REFRIGERATOR, THEY COME ASK US.

38
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,050
>> Neil: REALLY?

39
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,951
HAVE YOU TRIED THIS?

40
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,053
>> I TRIED IT WITH MY OWN KIDS.

41
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:24,522
>> Neil: WHAT DO THEY SAY?

42
00:01:24,522 --> 00:01:26,424
>> THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

43
00:01:26,424 --> 00:01:27,491
I DO THE BEST I CAN.

44
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:28,793
>> Neil: WHEN YOU STARTED DOING

45
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:31,162
IT, WHAT WAS THE REACTION?

46
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:33,264
>> MY SON DIDN'T GET ONE UNTIL

47
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:34,599
AFTER THE EIGHTH GRADE.

48
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,067
THERE'S NO SOCIAL MEDIA.

49
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,702
IT'S THIS PROBLEM ON OUR LAPS.

50
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:39,804
NOW APPLE IS TRYING TO TELL US

51
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:43,074
IT'S -- IT'S A GOOD P.R. MOVE --

52
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:46,377
THAT THEY'RE TRYING --

53
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:47,378
>> Neil: YOU BELIEVE THEY ARE

54
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:48,479
INTERESTED --

55
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,681
>> NO, I DON'T.

56
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:52,249
ANYBODY WATCHING CAN GO ON THEIR

57
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:54,919
iPHONE, GO TO SETTLES, BATTERY

58
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,021
AND YOU'LL SEE HOW MANY HOURS

59
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,623
PER DAY OR WEEK THAT YOU SPEND.

60
00:01:58,623 --> 00:01:59,256
>> Neil: NOTHING NEW.

61
00:01:59,256 --> 00:01:59,957
>> YEAH.

62
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:01,759
IF YOU HAVE AN iPHONE, I'LL SHOW

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,159
YOU.

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,130
>> Neil: WITH MY KIDS, IT'S 24

65
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,430
HOURS.

66
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,199
SO I'M JUST WONDERING HOW YOU

67
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,201
BALANCE IT OUT.

68
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,970
IS THERE A WAY FOR APPLE TO GET

69
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,807
A HANDLE ON THIS SO THAT WE FIND

70
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:17,241
ALTERNATIVES?

71
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,376
SOME SAY THERE'S SOFTWARE TO

72
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:19,276
SHUT THE PHONE DOWN.

73
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:20,177
>> THEY HAVE THAT.

74
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:22,647
IT'S NOT REALLY AN APPLE THING.

75
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,349
IT'S A HOME-TO-HOME FAMILY

76
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:25,683
THINGS.

77
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,252
PARENTS HAVE TO START -- THE

78
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,087
KIDS CAN'T CONTROL THEMSELVES.

79
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:32,223
THE IDEA OF WE WANT TO TEACH OUR

80
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:33,791
KIDS HAVE TO HAVE CONTROL OVER

81
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,225
IT.

82
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,260
THEIR BRAIN IS NOT DEVELOPED

83
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,062
THEM TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTROL

84
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:38,329
IT.

85
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,598
IT HAS TO COME FROM THE PARENTS.

86
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:42,767
OFTENTIMES IS LIVING THE EXAMPLE

87
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:43,134
OURSELVES.

88
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:43,734
>> Neil: YEAH.

89
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,170
SO THIS TECHNOLOGY, MORE

90
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,772
ADVANCED YOU GET, THE MORE THESE

91
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:49,540
GADGETS CAN DO, THE WORSE IT'S

92
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,574
GOING TO GET, RIGHT?

93
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:52,009
>> I BELIEVE SO, YEAH.

94
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:54,011
RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT THE PRECIPICE

95
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:56,380
OF A MAJOR PROBLEM AS A SOCIETY

96
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,949
BECAUSE WHAT THIS STUFF IS DOING

97
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,751
PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO US, HOW IT'S

98
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:03,287
TEARING FAMILIES APARTY, SOCIAL

99
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:04,321
RAMIFICATIONS AND SO FORTH.

100
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:05,890
THE DEVELOPERS ARE CONTINUING TO

101
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,393
POUR OUT NEW PRODUCTS EVERY WEEK

102
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:09,794
PRACTICALLY.

103
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:10,661
THEY HAVE ONE GOAL.

104
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,996
THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP US

105
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:12,897
GET OFF --

106
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:15,132
>> Neil: THE OTHER SIDE, IT

107
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:16,967
MAKES OUR LIVES EASIER,

108
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:17,334
SMOOTHER.

109
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,604
>> DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

110
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:23,274
SIMON COWELL JUST REVEALED THAT

111
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:24,809
HE GOT RID OF HIS PHONE.

112
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,211
I WAS TIRED OF BEING CONTACTED.

113
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,979
HE NEEDED PEACE OF MIND.

114
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,482
>> Neil: BUT HE TEXTED THAT.

115
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:32,316
>> HE DID.

116
00:03:32,316 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Neil: THANKS, TO THE AUTHOR,
