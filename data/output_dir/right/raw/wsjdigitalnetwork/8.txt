1
00:00:00,881 --> 00:00:03,548
(ragtime music)

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,308
- [Host] America has always prided itself

3
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:10,054
on being the land of opportunity.

4
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:13,304
That image, for many people, is fading.

5
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:17,749
Nobel-prize-winning economist Angus Deaton

6
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:21,371
and his wife, fellow
Princeton professor Anne Case,

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:24,431
say that, for the majority, the reality

8
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:27,598
of the American dream is disappearing.

9
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,761
- I do worry about a
world in which the rich

10
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,752
get to write the rules,
which the rest of us

11
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:34,252
then have to obey.

12
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,546
- [Host Voiceover] In this
episode of Moving Upstream,

13
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:42,937
I head to Princeton to find out what's led

14
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:47,187
these provocative thinkers
to ring the alarm bells.

15
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:51,723
- This 250-year experiment
we've had with democracy

16
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:53,339
could be coming to an end.

17
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:56,506
- Might be on the edge of a precipice.

18
00:00:57,578 --> 00:01:00,161
(string music)

19
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:10,540
- [Host] Professors Deaton and Case are

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,207
on a mission to solve a mystery:

21
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:16,150
what's behind the decades-long rise

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,483
in suicide rates in America,

23
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:21,675
and what does it say about our country?

24
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:24,842
- In every state, in prime-age whites,

25
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:30,143
deaths from suicide went
up between 1999 and 2016.

26
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:32,691
Well we think it's a real sign

27
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,024
that something is not right.

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,282
- [Host] The professors
note that the suicide

29
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:41,524
rate among middle-aged African Americans

30
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:46,213
isn't on the rise, and it's
far lower than that of whites.

31
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:47,904
- Even though whites are wealthier,

32
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:50,152
within an African-American community,

33
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,402
you feel you are part of the community.

34
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:56,093
- [Host] Suicides are
striking especially hard

35
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:58,717
in a most unlikely area, one where

36
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:01,134
the myth of America was made.

37
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:02,446
- [Deaton] There's a
suicide belt in America

38
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:04,034
right up the Rocky Mountains.

39
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:06,217
- [Case] Arizona, New Mexico,
all the way up through--

40
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,050
- [Deaton] To Alaska.

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,020
- [Case] Montana, and then then a few

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,402
extra miles further, into Alaska.

43
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:11,273
- Is that really a thing, a suicide belt?

44
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:12,316
- That's what they call it.
- Yes.

45
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,853
- Do a colored map of the U.S.,

46
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,970
showing where the suicide rate is higher.

47
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,204
Looks like the Rocky Mountains.

48
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,537
- Are we talking about a despair

49
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:21,794
caused by economic hardship?

50
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:25,461
Or is it something in
the spirit of America?

51
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:29,491
- I think economics may
trigger some of these things,

52
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:31,908
but in the end it's a failure

53
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:37,673
of spiritual and social life
that drives people to suicide.

54
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:41,561
- Is it reasonable to think that

55
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,431
if some of these people had more money,

56
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,429
that they wouldn't fall
into the pits of despair?

57
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:49,818
- I don't think that anyone doubts that

58
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:52,377
if they had more money
they'd be better off, right?

59
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,304
I mean, we're economists after all.

60
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,888
But you can't link these deaths

61
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,494
to having more money or less money,

62
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:58,800
it just doesn't work.

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,005
- [Host voiceover] If you
take a look at the data

64
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,519
from the great recession,
you see what they mean.

65
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,111
Even though the economy tanked,

66
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:06,596
and many Americans lost their savings,

67
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:10,604
it didn't significantly
move the suicide trend line.

68
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,673
- You used the term "deaths of despair."

69
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:14,848
Did you guys coin that?

70
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:15,931
- Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:19,460
- [Deaton] The addiction
thing is so close to suicide.

72
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,127
Some of the opioid doctors
talk about a lost generation.

73
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,789
- [Host Voiceover] One of
the things that intrigues

74
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,404
the researchers is that it seems

75
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:31,237
to be a North American phenomenon.

76
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,247
- [Deaton] This is where the comparison

77
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,080
with Europe is very important,

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,590
'cause you don't really
see deaths of despair.

79
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,672
- Though in southern Europe

80
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:40,288
you do see really high unemployment,

81
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,305
particularly for young people.

82
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,921
- We're not talking
about unemployment here.

83
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,941
It's much more to do with the, you know,

84
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,167
things that you would correlate

85
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,167
with a spiritual crisis.

86
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,486
- The Europeans are not killing themselves

87
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:53,069
the way that the Americans are.

88
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,502
They've lost jobs, technological change

89
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,711
has come to Europe, so one of the places

90
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:01,128
our research will go next is:

91
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,188
what are the big differences between

92
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,437
the Europeans and the Americans

93
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:09,057
that is helping the Europeans
keep body and soul together?

94
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:10,631
- [Host Voiceover] Deaton and Case offer

95
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:13,841
some theories: one, the
breakdown of families.

96
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:14,924
- [Deaton] The things that make people

97
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:17,548
want to kill themselves or
lose the meaning of life

98
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,253
are to do with things like your marriage

99
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:20,576
has never worked out, you know,

100
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:22,494
you don't know your kids anymore.

101
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,911
- Social bonds deteriorating,

102
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:25,796
is that what we're talking about?

103
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:26,629
- Yeah.

104
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,258
- [Host Voicevoer]
Another theory: Americans

105
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:32,091
making a religious
migration to churches that,

106
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:34,095
Case thinks, are changing the way

107
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,762
faith connects in the community.

108
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:40,411
- You've said something
really provocative on this.

109
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,956
You've singled out the Evangelical church.

110
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:44,674
- That is a church that more people

111
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:47,384
are identifying with, and it's a church

112
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:50,801
which encourages my personal relationship

113
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,950
with my savior, but it's a
very individual experience,

114
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:59,005
whereas the mainline Protestant churches,

115
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:00,584
or the Catholic church would be,

116
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,474
you're part of a community.

117
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:04,313
- We've nothing against
the Evangelical churches,

118
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,765
and we're certainly not
correlating Evangelicals

119
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,869
with the deaths, we don't
have the data for that.

120
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:10,865
But one of the things you might think,

121
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,360
if a community is coming apart, is you see

122
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,860
less religious observance, and you do not.

123
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,498
- [Host Voiceover] But
there is one correaltion

124
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,581
they find in the numbers.

125
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:23,854
- All this bad stuff, by and large,

126
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:26,208
is happening to people
who do not have a BA,

127
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:30,495
and people who do have a BA
are largely exempt from this.

128
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,245
The economy is no longer offering

129
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:37,382
a good life to people
without a university degree.

130
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:38,599
- [Host Voiceover] People in the U.S.

131
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:41,529
that only have a high-school
diploma are more than

132
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:44,283
twice as likely to kill themselves

133
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:46,942
as those who hold a college degree.

134
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:49,405
Today, fewer than a third of Americans

135
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,370
ultimately earn a bachelor's degree

136
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,870
before reaching the age of 29.

137
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,580
- If we can only generate good lives

138
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,421
for an elite that's about
a third of the population,

139
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,754
then we have a real problem.

140
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,689
- [Host Voicevoer] The real problem,

141
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,620
as Deaton and Case see it,

142
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,203
is that deaths of
despair are an indicator.

143
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:12,360
- So, I mean, I would go as far as to say

144
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,170
if we can't fix this, it really
is a crisis of capitalism.

145
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,472
You know, it doesn't seem to be working

146
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:22,305
for the people who are
not very well educated.

147
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,293
Up until the Second World War,

148
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,699
the dominant intellectual views then was

149
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,616
that capitalism was sort of broken.

150
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:36,007
- [Footage Narrator] Little man, what now?

151
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:37,438
- [Deaton] There were a lot of people who

152
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,187
were flirting with Communism or Socialism

153
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:41,026
in one form or another.

154
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,266
And what seemed to happen after

155
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,110
the Second World War is that it started

156
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,181
delivering for more or less everybody.

157
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:48,257
And so you get this long period,

158
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:51,674
from 1945 through to the early seventies,

159
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,303
when all boats rose together.

160
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:57,424
Working-class people, people
without a college degree,

161
00:06:57,424 --> 00:07:00,689
who entered the labor
market right in 1970,

162
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,501
had a great world, and
that was a world in which

163
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,510
you could belong to a
union, there was a fabric

164
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,270
of working-class life which looked like

165
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,770
it was going to go on forever.

166
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:16,111
And that world has been sort
of coming apart since 1970.

167
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:18,832
You know, median wages, in real terms,

168
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:22,082
have been pretty stagnant for 50 years.

169
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,501
- [Host Voiceover] The
professors think conditions

170
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:28,524
are ripe in America for one
of two things to happen:

171
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:31,441
one, a resurgent left declaring war

172
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:33,996
on laissez-faire economics.

173
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,068
- Capitalism in America is much more

174
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:38,818
anti-worker than it is in Europe.

175
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,698
I mean, the income tax
rates are not very different

176
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:42,184
from what they are here, but in Europe

177
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:44,441
there's a value-added tax that generates

178
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,932
a huge amount of revenue which is used

179
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,147
to maintain an elaborate
social safety net.

180
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,498
We don't have that here.

181
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:51,718
- We've produced the Bill Gateses,

182
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:54,922
the Mark Zuckerbergs, the Steve Jobses.

183
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,885
They've come from
America, not from Europe.

184
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,733
Some of the greatest minds on this planet

185
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,316
have emerged from this society.

186
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:05,413
- Well a lot of them are immigrants.

187
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:09,590
So, something like half of
the Fortune 500 companies

188
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,049
were started by immigrants.

189
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:14,007
The year I got the Nobel Prize,
there were four Americans.

190
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:16,340
Three of us were immigrants.

191
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,578
Do we have a free society?

192
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:22,816
We don't look after each
other, and in the end

193
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,191
it's rough and tumble, a lot of people

194
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:25,537
fall right through the cracks.

195
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:28,454
But, on average, we do well. Right?

196
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:33,016
But the question is, is
"on average we do well"

197
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:36,464
okay if it's only the top third?

198
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:39,083
If it's only the people with BAs?

199
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,295
You know, in the end, you'd want a world

200
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:44,296
where people don't have
to go to college, right?

201
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,491
- [Host Voiceover] The other possibility,

202
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,391
with inequality reaching
such a high level,

203
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:52,802
they say it may be the
fabric of our society

204
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:55,469
that could be the next casualty.

205
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,901
- You know when you see a
society's life expectancy

206
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:02,067
beginning to tip over for
like three years in a row,

207
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,929
which it has been for
whites, and two years

208
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:06,423
for the whole population, the only time

209
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:10,570
that's happened before was,
you know, because of smoking.

210
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,036
So this is, you know, that does suggest

211
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,051
that something really bad is going on

212
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,551
under the surface.

213
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,600
- Canary in a coal mine kind of situation?

214
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,850
- Yes, exactly.

215
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,623
And that's very worrying.

216
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,910
And you know the world
is a much better place,

217
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,410
but it's a very fragile place.

218
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:33,137
What happens if, say, the
stock market fell by 50% again?

219
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,676
You could have some constitutional crisis.

220
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:40,176
You could have a lot of things
like that that go together.

221
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:43,343
North Korea is the most obvious thing.

222
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,774
Put a couple of those things together

223
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:50,274
and the world would not look
quite such a happy place.

224
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,481
- These acclaimed Princeton professors

225
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:01,231
think the American ideal
of self-reliance is,

226
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:05,276
due to changes in the
economy, becoming outdated.

227
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:08,527
Is the isolation and
despair being experienced

228
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:10,635
by so many people in this country,

229
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:13,032
less-educated whites in particular,

230
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:16,036
pushing us towards some sort of crisis?

231
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:17,378
What do you think?

232
00:10:17,378 --> 00:00:00,000
We look forward to reading your comments.
