1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:13,479
>> WOW.

2
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:18,618
>> USA.

3
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:19,419
USA.

4
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:19,585
USA.

5
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:23,256
USA.

6
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,390
>> HELLO JOHNSON CITY, IT IS

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,992
GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.

8
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:34,901
I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK.

9
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,170
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING BACK IN

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,905
THE GREAT STATE OF TENNESSEE

11
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,141
WITH THOUSANDS OF HARDWORKING

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,341
AMERICAN PATRIOTS.

13
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:47,981
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,517
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS WE'VE

15
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,352
ACHIEVED THE BIGGEST COMEBACK IN

16
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,185
AMERICAN HISTORY.

17
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:58,358
YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED.

18
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,760
AND OUR COUNTRY IS RESPECTED

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,563
AGAIN.

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,498
WE'RE RESPECTED AGAIN.

21
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,401
JOBLESS CLAIMS ARE AT A 50-YEAR

22
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,104
LOW AND THE STOCK MARKET IS AT

23
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:16,976
AN ALL TIME HIGH.

24
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,877
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING.

25
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:20,279
WAGES ARE RISING.

26
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:23,283
AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING

27
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:29,455
TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE, EVER

28
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:29,688
BEFORE.

29
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:30,890
AND THINK OF THAT.

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,492
THINK OF THAT.

31
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,061
SUCH A SIMPLE STATEMENT.

32
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,731
BUT SUCH A COMPLEX THING TO DO.

33
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,298
THINK OF IT.

34
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:41,100
MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING TODAY

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,635
THAN EVER BEFORE.

36
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:48,041
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL STATEMENT.

37
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:53,213
GET OUT AND VOTE THIS NOVEMBER.

38
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,847
CAN ALL CHANGE AROUND QUICKLY,

39
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:55,515
FOLKS.

40
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,419
WE ARE DEFENDING OUR SECOND

41
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:08,794
AMENDMENT, TAKING CARE BUT

42
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,064
BREDISON WILL NOT DEFEND YOUR

43
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:11,564
SECOND AMENDMENT.

44
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,967
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR GREAT

45
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:19,505
VETERANS AND REBUILDING

46
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:22,242
AMERICA'S MILITARY MIGHT.

47
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,344
AND JUST TODAY WE MADE HISTORY

48
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,112
AGAIN WHEN I ANNOUNCED TO THE

49
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:32,085
WORLD THAT WE ARE REPLACING THE

50
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,788
JOB KILLING DISASTER KNOWN AS

51
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:40,193
NAFTA WITH A BRAND NEW

52
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,061
US-MEXICO-CANADA, WE ADDED

53
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,265
CANADA, WORKED OUT GREAT, TRADE

54
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:45,598
AGREEMENT.

55
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,537
AND WE'RE CALLING IT USMCA.

56
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:54,440
NO MORE NAFTA.

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,441
NO MORE NAFTA.

58
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,976
IT'S THE LARGEST TRADE DEAL THE

59
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,245
UNITED STATES HAS EVER

60
00:02:59,245 --> 00:02:59,545
NEGOTIATED.

61
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:02,248
AND IT'S ALSO A GREAT DEAL FOR

62
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,016
OUR COUNTRY.

63
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,351
IT'S GOING TO PRODUCE JOBS AND

64
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,919
COMPANIES AREN'T GOING TO BE

65
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,922
LEAVING AND FIRING EVERYBODY AND

66
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,090
MAKING PRODUCT AND SENDING IT

67
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,594
BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES.

68
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:17,096
NO TAX.

69
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,164
IT'S FAIR.

70
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,032
IT'S MODERN.

71
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,465
AND IT'S BALANCED.

72
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,034
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

73
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,037
WE HAVE TWO WONDERFUL PARTNERS

74
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,370
NOW.

75
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,539
NOW THEY'RE PARTNERS, MEXICO AND

76
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:26,772
CANADA.

77
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:28,374
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.

78
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,411
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

79
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,645
AMERICA'S WINNING AGAIN.

80
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,449
AND AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED

81
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:42,455
AGAIN BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY

82
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:46,626
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST.

83
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,894
BUT RADICAL DEMOCRATS IN

84
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,029
CONGRESS ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO

85
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,466
ERASE EVERYTHING THAT

86
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:53,733
ACHIEVED.

87
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,535
THEY'RE LOOKING OUT THERE RIGHT

88
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,470
NOW AND THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

89
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,038
OUT HOW DID THEY TAKE AN

90
00:03:59,038 --> 00:03:59,972
ELECTION BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

91
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,708
TAKE IT BACK.

92
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,644
YOU LOOK AT YOUR 401Ks.

93
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,679
YOU KNOW, WE'RE UP.

94
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,315
FROM THE TIME OF THE ELECTION,

95
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:09,515
55%.

96
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,583
I LOVE YOU TOO.

97
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:18,023
I LOVE YOU TOO.

98
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,625
HE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MY TYPE.

99
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,662
YOU KNOW THAT VOICE IS VERY

100
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:22,895
STRONG.

101
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,464
BUT I LOVE HIM.

102
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,666
WHOEVER YOU ARE I LOVE YOU.

103
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,435
WE'RE JUST FIVE WEEKS FROM ONE

104
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,204
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

105
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,939
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS OF OUR

106
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,206
LIFETIME.

107
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,342
THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE WHAT WE

108
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,512
DID IN '16, SOMETHING THAT

109
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,314
NOBODY HAS SEEN, MAYBE IN OTHER

110
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:44,217
COUNTRIES, IT WAS THE GREATEST

111
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,520
ELECTION VICTORY IN THE HISTORY

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,022
OF OUR COUNTRY.

113
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:54,460
AND BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS WHO

114
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,361
ARE OBSTRUCTIONISTS, WHO ARE

115
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,064
PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO SEE

116
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,400
STRONG MILITARY, THEY DON'T WANT

117
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,371
BORDERS, THEY DON'T MIND CRIME.

118
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,140
AND THEIR ENABLERS, THE FAKE

119
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,778
NEWS MEDIA RIGHT BACK THERE.

120
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:14,947
WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

121
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,951
WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

122
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,054
A DEMOCRAT TAKE OVER OF CONGRESS

123
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,222
WILL PLUNGE OUR COUNTRY INTO

124
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,590
GRIDLOCK AND CHAOS AND TAKE AWAY

125
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,493
ALL OF THE WEALTH THAT YOU'VE

126
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,997
EARNED OVER THE LAST 20 MONTHS.

127
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,567
AND THINK OF THIS.

128
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,203
THE STOCK MARKET, WHICH IS UP AT

129
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:41,107
RECORD LEVELS, AND NOW THE

130
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,009
HIGHEST WILL DROP.

131
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,911
YOUR 401Ks WILL BE DEVASTATED.

132
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:51,551
YOUR TAXES WILL RISE BEYOND YOUR

133
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,785
WILDEST IMAGINATION, AND CRIME

134
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,887
WILL FLOW INTO OUR COUNTRY

135
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,556
THROUGH THESE OPEN BORDERS.

136
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,393
OTHER THAN THAT WE'LL BE DOING

137
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,961
VERY WELL.

138
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:07,533
IT'S CRAZY.

139
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:15,942
CRAZY.

140
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,042
AND WE ARE.

141
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,777
WE WANT TO GET MORE MONEY.

142
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,913
I COULD BUILD THAT THING IN ONE

143
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:21,113
YEAR.

144
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:26,853
I COULD BUILD IT.

145
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,888
WE GOT $1.6 BILLION AND ANOTHER

146
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,454
$1.6 BILLION.

147
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,223
WE WANT TO BUILD IT FAST.

148
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,090
I WANT TO BUILD IT.

149
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,592
SO AFTER THE ELECTION,

150
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,795
LEADERSHIP HAS SAID, MEANING

151
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,829
REPUBLICANS, THEY'RE GOING TO DO

152
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,331
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

153
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:38,931
VERY STRONG.

154
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,566
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

155
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,767
BUT THE WALL IS UNDER

156
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:42,435
CONSTRUCTION.

157
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,737
A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE.

158
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,073
A LOT OF -- IF YOU LOOK AT SOME

159
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,442
OF IT, SOME WALL WAS UP, FALLING

160
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,444
DOWN, TERRIBLE CONDITION.

161
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,912
NOW IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BRAND NEW,

162
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,312
AND IT WORKS.

163
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,181
IT DOES WORK.

164
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,015
WE NEED WALL.

165
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,850
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY.

166
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,585
WE WANT -- WE GOT TO TAKE CARE

167
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,220
OF OUR PEOPLE.

168
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:07,560
LOOK AT WHAT'S DOING ON -- GOING

169
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,896
ON IN CALIFORNIA.

170
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,898
YOU HAVE A MAN RUNNING FOR

171
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,499
GOVERNOR IN CALIFORNIA THAT SAYS

172
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,568
WE DON'T WANT ANY BORDERS.

173
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,537
WE DON'T WANT I.C.E.

174
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,071
WE DO WANT SANCTUARY CITIES.

175
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,073
AND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE

176
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,074
OF HEALTH CARE.

177
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,876
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF

178
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,143
EDUCATION.

179
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,045
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF

180
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,413
EVERYTHING FOR PEOPLE THAT JUST

181
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,081
FLOW IN.

182
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,949
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILLION

183
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,150
PEOPLE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA.

184
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,919
IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS.

185
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,119
WE HAVE IT RIGHT.

186
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,555
WE HAVE IT GOING PROPERLY.

187
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,558
THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE

188
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:38,825
VENEZUELA.

189
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,626
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.

190
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,930
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

191
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,464
LOOKING FOR.

192
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,566
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.

193
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,001
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS BEEN COME

194
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,237
PLATELY TAKEN OVER BY THE --

195
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,472
COMPLETELY TAKEN OVER BY THE

196
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:53,939
SO-CALLED RESISTANCE.

197
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,240
THAT'S ALL THEY DO.

198
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,176
THEY CAMPAIGN ON RESIST.

199
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,544
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

200
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,179
THEY'RE ONLY GOOD AT ONE THING.

201
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,182
THEY STICK TOGETHER LIKE GLUE.

202
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,250
THAT'S IT.

203
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,285
THEY HAVE BAD POLICY.

204
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,054
FRANKLY, THEY'RE BAD

205
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:08,354
POLITICIANS.

206
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,221
EVERYTHING'S BAD, BUT THEY STICK

207
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:09,521
TOGETHER.

208
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:11,557
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

209
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,992
THEY'LL TAKE EVERYTHING,

210
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,894
INCLUDING YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT.

211
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,030
THEY'LL TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY.

212
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,532
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE

213
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,035
ENTITLED TO POWER AND THEY HAVE

214
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,973
BEEN BLIND AND A BLIND RAGE EVER

215
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,408
SINCE, BOY, THEY LOST THE 2016

216
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:34,413
-- BOY, THEY HAVE GONE LOCO.

217
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,514
THEY HAVE GONE LOCO.

218
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,149
THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY.

219
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,417
THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE

220
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,453
BETWEEN A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT

221
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,421
IS BUILDING OUR FUTURE AND A

222
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,358
DEMOCRAT PARTY THAT IS TRYING TO

223
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:51,097
BURN OUR FUTURE DOWN.

224
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,434
THE DEMOCRATS ONLY KNOW HOW TO

225
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,769
OBSTRUCT, DEMOLISH, AND DESTROY

226
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,172
AS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS.

227
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,607
DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO DO

228
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,509
ANYTHING AND TO HURT ANYONE TO

229
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,445
GET THEIR WAY, LIKE THEY'RE

230
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:13,586
DOING WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

231
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,521
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DESTROY

232
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,356
HIM SINCE THE VERY FIRST SECOND

233
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,325
HE WAS ANNOUNCED BECAUSE THEY

234
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,127
KNOW THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL

235
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:25,264
FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION AS

236
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,432
WRITTEN.

237
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:30,068
THAT'S BEEN HIS HISTORY.

238
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:33,773
AND HE'S A GOOD MAN.

239
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,640
GREAT STUDENT.

240
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,007
GREAT INTELLECT.

241
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:35,708
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM.

242
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,011
ALL OF A SUDDEN, OH, LET'S GO

243
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,179
BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL.

244
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,414
THEY MAYBE SHOULD GO BEFORE HIGH

245
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:41,647
SCHOOL.

246
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,784
AND I KNOW SO MANY OF THEM, YOU

247
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,986
HAVE THE GREAT VIETNAM WAR HERO

248
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,989
WHO DIDN'T GO TO VIETNAM, YOU

249
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,223
KNOW THAT.

250
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:51,523
BLUMENTHAL.

251
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:58,397
HOW ABOUT BLUMENTHAL?

252
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,432
HOW ABOUT BLUMENTHAL?

253
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,168
WE CALL HIM DA NANG BLUMENTHAL.

254
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,770
15 YEARS, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

255
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,070
CONNECTICUT.

256
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,641
HE WENT AROUND TELLING WAR

257
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:08,874
STORIES.

258
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,510
PEOPLE DYING LEFT AND RIGHT BUT

259
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,611
MY PLATOON MARCHED FORWARD.

260
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,346
HE WAS NEVER IN VIETNAM.

261
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,514
IT WAS A LIE.

262
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,451
THEN HE'S UP THERE SAYING WE

263
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,319
WANT THE TRUTH FROM JUDGE

264
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,254
KAVANAUGH, AND YOU'RE GETTING

265
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:28,994
THE TRUTH FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

266
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:30,363
UNBELIEVABLE.

267
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:30,963
UNBELIEVABLE.

268
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,031
DA NANG.

269
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:36,135
YOU KNOW DA N ANG, RIGHT --

270
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:36,435
NANG, RIGHT?

271
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,636
GREAT CITY IN VIETNAM.

272
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,538
AND THEN YOU HAVE CORY BOOKER

273
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,439
WHO DESTROYED NEWARK.

274
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:45,011
I MEAN THE JOB HE DID IN NEWARK,

275
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,345
NEW JERSEY.

276
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:46,645
AND SEE?

277
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:50,349
SOME OF THE THINGS HE WROTE WHEN

278
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,851
HE WAS YOUNG ABOUT WOMEN.

279
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,086
TAKE A LOOK, OKAY?

280
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,955
AND THEN THEY WANT TO TAKE A LOT

281
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,723
LONGER WITH THE FBI.

282
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,225
NO, THE FBI, THEY SHOULD TAKE,

283
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,527
BY THE WAY, IF WE TOOK TEN

284
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,429
YEARS, THEY'D WANT MORE TIME.

285
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,399
BUT THEY WANT TO TAKE A LOT

286
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:07,632
LONGER.

287
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:11,036
BUT DIANNE FEINSTEIN SHE HAD

288
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:13,773
THIS -- SHE HAD THIS LETTER FOR

289
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,006
MONTHS.

290
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,008
AND SHE DIDN'T REVEAL IT UNTIL

291
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,244
EVERYTHING WAS FIN.

292
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,545
THEN SHE REVEALED IT.

293
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,680
THEN SHE SAYS, OH, WE WANT MORE

294
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:21,880
TIME.

295
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,516
LET'S SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT, BUT

296
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,651
I TELL YOU WHAT, THEY'RE TRYING

297
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,386
TO DESTROY A VERY FINE PERSON.

298
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,989
AND WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.

299
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,558
WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.

300
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:36,162
DEMOCRATS WANT ACTIVISTS,

301
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,430
LEFT-WING JUDGES WHO WILL

302
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,433
TOTALLY REWRITE THE LAWS, ERASE

303
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,402
YOUR BORDERS, AND REPLACE YOUR

304
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:43,635
VALUES.

305
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:45,471
YOU DON'T WANT THAT IN

306
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:45,738
TENNESSEE.

307
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,006
REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT A JUDGE'S

308
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,442
JOB IS TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND TO

309
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:57,149
DELIVER EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL.

310
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,084
THE DEMOCRATS CAN NO LONGER BE

311
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,220
TRUSTED WITH YOUR POWER AND WITH

312
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,587
THEIR POWER.

313
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,522
YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.

314
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:07,460
THEY HAVE MOVED SO FAR LEFT THAT

315
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:16,602
POCAHONTAS IS CONSIDERED A

316
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,204
CONSERVATIVE.

317
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:18,404
TRUE.

318
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,873
THAT'S RIGHT.

319
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,273
ELIZABETH WARREN.

320
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,975
SHE SAID SHE'S CONSIDERING A RUN

321
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,610
FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

322
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,078
PLEASE, PLEASE REASON.

323
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:32,718
HOW ABOUT THAT GROUP?

324
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,219
BIDEN.

325
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:33,419
BIDEN.

326
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,021
WE CALL HIM 1% BIDEN.

327
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,790
UNTIL OBAMA TOOK HIM OFF THE

328
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,158
TRASH HEAP HE COULDN'T DO

329
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:39,425
ANYTHING.

330
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,093
NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT RUNNING.

331
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:41,360
TOUGH GUY.

332
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,494
HE'S A TOUGH GUY.

333
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:44,062
HE'S A REAL GENIUS.

334
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:46,498
I WANT TO CHALLENGE HIM TO A

335
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,100
FIGHT BEHIND THE BARN.

336
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,436
OH WOULD I LOVE THAT.

337
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:57,710
WOULDN'T THAT BE GOOD?

338
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,311
I WANT TO CHALLENGE DONALD

339
00:12:59,311 --> 00:12:59,511
TRUMP.

340
00:12:59,511 --> 00:12:59,844
REMEMBER THAT?

341
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:04,583
HE GOT A LITTLE UPSET.

342
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,917
HE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY.

343
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,554
THEY'VE GT SOME REAL BEAUTIES

344
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:08,754

345
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,223

00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:11,590

THIS NOVEMBER 6TH YOU'VE GOT A

348
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,461
CHANCE TO REJECT THE OUTRAGEOUS

349
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,362
POLICIES OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.

350
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:21,734
NOT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT THE

351
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,101
DEMOCRAT PARTY.

352
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,568
SOUNDS WORSE, RIGHT?

353
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:25,337
THAT'S THEIR REAL NAME.

354
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,739
IT'S THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.

355
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,140
BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT, YOU GT

356
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,410

357
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,178
VOTE FOR REPUBLICAN.

358
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,014
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS TO GET

359
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,281
THE VES.

360
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:40,686
STOP THE CRIME.

361
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,921
YOU KNOW, I SAID THE OTHER

362
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,558
NIGHT, I SAID, YOU KNOW, I THINK

363
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:48,093
I'M GOING TO KEEP IT.

364
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,461
IT'S A LITTLE HARSH, BUT I'M

365
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,963
GOING TO KEEP IT.

366
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,665
DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF

367
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:52,865
CRIME.

368
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:53,465
IT'S TRUE.

369
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:53,732
IT'S TRUE.

370
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,300
THEY'RE THE PARTY OF CRIME.

371
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,704
SOUNDS A LITTLE TOUGH, BUT IT'S

372
00:13:58,704 --> 00:13:58,904
TRUE.

373
00:13:58,904 --> 00:13:59,237
OPEN BORDERS.

374
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:01,674
WE'RE THRILLED TO BE JOINED BY

375
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,908
MANY TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN MEMBERS

376
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,509
OF CONGRESS.

377
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,044
PEOPLE THAT ARE FRIEND OF MINE.

378
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,578

THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

596
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:43,088
A VOTE FOR BREDISON IS A VOTE

597
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,893
FOR CHUCK SCHUMER, NANCY PELOSI,

598
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,830
AND THE REAL LEADER OF THE

599
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:58,436
DEMOCRATS, MAXINE WATERS.

600
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,572
PHIL BREDISON WANTS TO RAISE

601
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:00,872
YOUR TAXES.

602
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,007
AS GOVERNOR, REMEMBER THIS,

603
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,075
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, SEEMS

604
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,244
LIKE A NAS GUY.

605
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,747
BUT WHAT -- NICE GUY, BUT WHAT

606
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,515
GOOD DOES THAT DO?

607
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,950
AS GOVERNOR HE RAISED TAXES AND

608
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,120
FEES IN YOUR STATE BY MORE THAN

609
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,520
$1 BILLION.

610
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,423
HE OPPOSES THE BORDER WALL

611
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:18,689
TOTALLY.

612
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:21,827
HE SUPPORTED DRIVER CERTIFICATES

613
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,496
FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS.

614
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,966
AND ON HIS WATCH TENNESSEE

615
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,901
UNEMPLOYMENT DOUBLED.

616
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,236
IT DOUBLED IN WHATEVER IT WAS,

617
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:35,106
HOW LONG WAS HE THERE?

618
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:35,306
EIGHT?

619
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:35,606
IT DOUBLED.

620
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:38,577
YOU WANT HIM TO BE RUNNING, I

621
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,279
DON'T THINK SO.

622
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,181
HE DOUBLED UNEMPLOYMENT.

623
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,151
IN 2010, PHIL WROTE A BOOK

624
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:46,952
ADVOCATING GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH

625
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:47,152
CARE.

626
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,886
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

627
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,855
YOU WANT TO WAIT IN LINE FOR

628
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,056
ABOUT SIX WEEKS TO GET TAKEN

629
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:53,258
CARE OF.

630
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,560
AND CALLED FOR IT TO BE FUNDED

631
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,464
BY A 20% PAYROLL TAX ON ALL OF

632
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,966
THE HARDWORKING AMERICANS, MANY

633
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,436
ARE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW.

634
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,604
GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE.

635
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,406
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

636
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,742
THAT HASN'T PROVEN TOO

637
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,509
SUCCESSFUL ANYWHERE ELSE.

638
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,713
PHIL WAS A MAJOR FINANCIAL

639
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,550
SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

640
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,318
OF HILLARY CROOKED HILLARY

641
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:20,551
CLINTON.

642
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:20,986
CROOKED AS

643
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:26,291
NOW PHIL IS RUNNING TO BE THE

644
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,595
51ST SENATE DEMOCRAT AND THE

645
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,631
51ST DEMOCRATS ARE ELECTED IN

646
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,532
NOVEMBER, THEN CHUCK SCHUMER

647
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,567
WILL BECOME A MAJORITY LEADER.

648
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:42,908
YOU PUT IN 51.

649
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,309
EVEN THOUGH HE SAID SOMETHING

650
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,511
GOOD ABOUT OUR DEAL WITH CANADA

651
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,113
AND MEXICO TODAY, BUT HOW CAN

652
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:52,217
YOU NOT SAY GOOD?

653
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,552
THAT'S WHY SCHUMER IS SO

654
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,322
DESPERATE FOR PHIL TO WIN.

655
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,623
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT WE STAND

656
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,625
FOR WILL NEVER GET THE VOTES.

657
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,592
WE NEED VOTES.

658
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:03,261
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

659
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,663
NUMBER ONE, MARSHA WILL BE A

660
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,897
GREAT GREAT SENATOR.

661
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,499
BUT NUMBER TWO, WE NEED THE

662
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:07,699
VOTES.

663
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,501
WE GOT TO HAVE THE VOTE.

664
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,870
AND HE WILL NEVER ONCE VOTE FOR

665
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,036
US.

666
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:13,238
JUST REMEMBER, HE WILL NEVER

667
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,073
VOTE FOR US.

668
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,674
NOT ON JUDGES.

669
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,142
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS

670
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:21,346
THEY SAY I GOT ELECTED, THE

671
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,682
SUPREME COURT JUDGE, THEY SAY

672
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,315
THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING

673
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:27,118
THE PRESIDENT CAN DO IS PICK A

674
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,353
SUPREME COURT JUDGE.

675
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,321
SO WE PICKED JUSTICE NEIL

676
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:35,560
GORSUCH WHO HAS BEEN FANTASTIC.

677
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,728
AND NOW JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS

678
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,429
ACTUALLY DOING WELL.

679
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,564
I REALLY BELIEVE.

680
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,500
WE'VE GOT TO DO IT.

681
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,573
WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE

682
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,240
PUSHED AROUND.

683
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,444
PHIL IS ONLY RUNNING BECAUSE

684
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,412
CHUCK SCHUMER CALLED HIM UP AND

685
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,380
BEGGED HIM.

686
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,582
THE WORD IS BEGGED HIM TO RUN

687
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,184
BECAUSE SCHUMER KNOWS THE

688
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,653
DEMOCRATS PATH OF POWER RUNS

689
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,655
RIGHT THROUGH TENNESSEE.

690
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,458
AGAIN, SECOND AMENDMENT, HIGHER

691
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,194
TAXES, LOTS OF CRIME, MS-13, GET

692
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:09,894
USED TO THEM.

693
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:10,528
NO I.C.E.

694
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:14,499
WE DON'T WANT I.C.E.

695
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:14,765
THEY SAY.

696
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:18,169
IF YOU WANT TO STOP SCHUMER FROM

697
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,404
BECOMING MAJORITY LEADER, IF YOU

698
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,240
WANT TO STOP YOUR TAXES FROM

699
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,075
GOING UP 50% OR MORE, THAT'S

700
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,377
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, THEN YOU

701
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:29,647
MUST VOTE AGAINST BREDISON.

702
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,517
YOUR VOTE IN THIS ELECTION WILL

703
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,985
DECIDE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE

704
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,218
SENATE.

705
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:36,020
THAT'S HOW CLOSE IT IS.

706
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,687
YOU KNOW?

707
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,089
I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU NO, BUT

708
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,925
THAT'S HOW CLOSE IT IS.

709
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:41,625
A DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED SENATE

710
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,896
WILL ALWAYS BE RAISING YOUR

711
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:45,096
TAXES.

712
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,531
THEY'LL ALWAYS THROW OPEN YOUR

713
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:46,731
BRDER.

714
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,566
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO --

715
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:48,799
BORDER.

716
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,468
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO

717
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:50,768
CHANGE IT.

718
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:52,403
HE'S GOING TO VOTE WITH THE

719
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:52,670
DEMOCRATS.

720
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,439
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE -- I MEAN,

721
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,374
YOU LOOK AT HEALTH CARE.

722
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:57,275
WE GOT NO VOTES.

723
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,244
WE DAVE YOU THE LARGEST TAX CUTS

724
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,045
IN -- GAVE YOU THE LARGEST TAX

725
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:03,181
CUTS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

726
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:03,414
COUNTRY.

727
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:08,186
WE DIDN'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT VOTE.

728
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,588
AND THEY DON'T VOTE FOR A

729
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:10,821
REASON.

730
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:12,256
THEY DON'T VOTE BECAUSE IT'S BAD

731
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:12,523
FOR TRUMP.

732
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:13,925
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO

733
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,359
STOP ANYTHING WE DO.

734
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,794
IF IT'S REALLY GOOD, THEY STILL

735
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:18,229
WANT TO STOP IT.

736
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,131
AND WE DON'T WANT TO LET THAT

737
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:20,565
HAPPEN.

738
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,133
WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLE THINGS

739
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:22,366
PLANNED.

740
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,669
AND WE NEED TO LET IT HAPPEN.

741
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,638
THEY'RE GOING TO FLOOD YOUR

742
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,938
STREETS WITH CRIMINAL ALIENS.

743
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,575
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

744
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,609
THEY'RE ALWAYS ATTACKING LAW

745
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:31,976
ENFORCEMENT.

746
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,245
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

747
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,480
UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

748
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,049
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF

749
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,785
SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT,

750
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:40,985
RIGHT?

751
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:41,452
TREMENDOUS EQUIPMENT.

752
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:44,422
YOU KNOW, HEAVY ARMOR, DIFFERENT

753
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:44,655
THINGS.

754
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:46,324
THAT KEEP THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

755
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,458
PROFESSIONALS, PEOPLE THAT WE

756
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,327
LOVE THAT KEEPS THEM SAFE.

757
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,062
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO

758
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,262
THEM.

759
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:58,036
I HAVE GIVEN IT TO THEM, I'M

760
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:58,269
SORRY.

761
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,704
THEY WANT TO BLOCK YOUR GREAT

762
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:00,505
JUDGES.

763
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,639
THEY WANT TO WEAEN THE

764
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,407
MILITARY.

765
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,208
IT'S NOT EVEN WEAKEN.

766
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,710
THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY

767
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,212
MONEY ON THE MILITARY.

768
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,947
THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT

769
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,116
MILITARY, NUMBER ONE YOU NEED

770
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:11,282
IT.

771
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:11,883
JOBS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

772
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,052
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MILITARY,

773
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,853
IT'S NOT THE JOBS.

774
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:16,954
THAT'S TOTALLY SECONDARY.

775
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,890
BUT WE WILL SOON HAVE THE

776
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,325
STRONGEST MILITARY THAT WE'VE

777
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,726
EVER HAD.

778
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:27,966
WE HAD FIGHTER JETS AND WE

779
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:28,399
AIRPLANES.

780
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,968
AND OUR MILITARY, THE FATHER

781
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,536
FLEW THEM, THE GRANDFATHER FLEW

782
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,905
THEM, AND THE SON GOES IN FLYING

783
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:34,638
THE SAME PLANES.

784
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:36,807
YOU KNOW WHAT IN?

785
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:40,445
THEY'RE ALL GOING FAST.

786
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,447
WE'VE ORDERED THE FINEST JETS IN

787
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:42,714
THE WORLD.

788
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,015
BUT THE OTHER THING IS THEY'RE

789
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:48,486
MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE USA, ALL

790
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,088
OF THEM.

791
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,556
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.

792
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,325
THEY WANT TO OUTLAW PRIVATE

793
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,894
HEALTH INSURANCE SO YOU'LL GET

794
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,428
GREAT HEALTH INSURANCE AND WE'RE

795
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,197
ALREADY DOING IT.

796
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,498
WE'RE PROVIDING YOU WITH

797
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,101
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF

798
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:03,401
COMPETITION.

799
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:03,968
YOU'RE GETTING GREAT HEALTH

800
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,270
INSURANCE AND IT'S GOING TO GET

801
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,805
BETTER WHEN WE CAN GET A FEW

802
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,340
MORE VOTES SO WE CAN DO IT THE

803
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,041
WAY YOU WANT IT.

804
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,343
THIS IS THE WAY YOU WANT IT.

805
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,313
THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN AMERICAN

806
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:22,754
ENERGY AND REPLACE FREEDOM WITH

807
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,021
SOCIALISM.

808
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,123
THEY WANT A TURN -- IT'S TRUE --

809
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,426
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO TURN

810
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,527
AMERICA INTO VENEZUELA.

811
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,628
THAT'LL BE WONDERFUL.

812
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,629
THAT'LL BE WONDERFUL.

813
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,764
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT

814
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,064
HAPPEN.

815
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,466
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, EVEN MOST

816
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,501
DEMOCRATS, I CAN'T BELIEVE, WHEN

817
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,902
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING

818
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,203
WITH SANCTUARY CITIES AND

819
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:39,503
EVERYTHING.

820
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:40,571
I CAN'T BELIEVE MOST OF THEM ARE

821
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,773
GOING FOR IT.

822
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,909
ALSO AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION

823
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:45,209
IS MEDICARE.

824
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,811
DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON WANT TO

825
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:51,549
RAID MEDICARE TO PAY FOR THEIR

826
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:51,816
SOCIALISM.

827
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,084
DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING SO-CALLED

828
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,320
MEDICINE FOR ALL, ROBBING OUR

829
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,524
SENIORS OF ALL OF THEIR MEDICARE

830
00:30:59,524 --> 00:30:59,891
BENEFITS.

831
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:00,491
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

832
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,893
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT

833
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,195
MEDICARE AND OUR GREAT SENIORS

834
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,263
WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND PAID FOR

835
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:06,430
IT.

836
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,133
AND WE ALWAYS PROTECT AMERICANS

837
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,902
WITH THEIR PREEXISTING

838
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,569
CONDITIONS.

839
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:16,707
WE'RE DOING THAT.

840
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:17,809
ON PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, A LOT

841
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,811
OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S NOT A VERY

842
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,277
REPUBLICAN THING.

843
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:22,313
IT IS NOW, AND IT HAS BEEN FOR

844
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:22,580
ME.

845
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,717
I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE

846
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,517
WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.

847
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,418
WE'RE DOING WELL.

848
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,288
WE CAN DO IT.

849
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,856
DEMOCRATS ALSO WANT TO GIVE

850
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:35,560
WELFARE AND FREE HEALTH CARE TO

851
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:35,993
ILLEGAL ALIENS.

852
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:40,899
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT

853
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,833
PUBLIC BENEFITS.

854
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,836
AND WE DO, WE WANT TO PROTECT

855
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,704
BENEFITS AND PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR

856
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,874
TRULY NEEDY AMERICANS, AMERICANS

857
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,442
THAT NEED HELP.

858
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,710
DEMOCRATS WANT TO ABOLISH I.C.E.

859
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,413
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO

860
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:59,417
ABOLISH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

861
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,018
ENTIRELY.

862
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,687
AND THE DEMOCRAT PARTY SUPPORTS

863
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:07,558
SANCTUARY CITIES THAT UNLEASH

864
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,461
VIOLENT PREDATORS LIKE MS-13

865
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,562
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.

866
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,298
AND REMEMBER WHAT I SAID.

867
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,933
IT'S THE PARTY OF CRIME.

868
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,602
DEMOCRATS, THEY REALLY ARE.

869
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,404
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

870
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,605
EVEN LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING

871
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,371
IN CONGRESS.

872
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,074
EVEN LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING

873
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,575
WITH OUR LAWS, THE WAY THEY

874
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,077
TREAT OUR LAWS.

875
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,679
THE WAY THEY TREAT OUR COUNTRY.

876
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,548
WHAT THEY DO IN CONGRESS.

877
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,451
THEY ARE INDEED THE PARTY OF

878
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:33,651
CRIME.

879
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,420
EVERY DAY INNOCENT LIVES ARE

880
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,723
STOLEN BECAUSE OF

881
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,323
DEMOCRAT-SUPPORTED IMMIGRANT

882
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:39,590
POLICIES.

883
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,826
IF YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK, YOU

884
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,327
HAVE IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT

885
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:46,798
ARE SO BAD, SO DANGEROUS, JUST

886
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,399
RECENTLY IN CALIFORNIA AN

887
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,469
ILLEGAL ALIEN WITH A SEX CRIME

888
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,205
CONVICTION AND OTHER CONVICTIONS

889
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,040
HAD A PRIOR DEPORTATION.

890
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,942
THEY WANTED TO DEPORT THIS

891
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:58,443
PERSON.

892
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,077
THEY NEVER DID.

893
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,146
HE WAS CONVICTED FOR KILLING A

894
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,115
LOCAL FOOTBALL COACH WH LEAVES

895
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,351
BEHIND A WIFE -- WHO LEAVES

896
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,387
BEHIND A WIFE AND SIX BEAUTIFUL

897
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:09,587
KIDS.

898
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,122
A PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY.

899
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,123
THIS IS ALL OVER.

900
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,460
YOU COULD DO THIS FOR DAYS.

901
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,894
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE AMERICA

902
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,764
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR

903
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:27,538
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR

904
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,005
CRIMINAL ALIENS.

905
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,073
AND REPUBLICANS PROUDLY STAND

906
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,741
WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF

907
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:33,478
I.C.E., BORDER PATROL, AND WE

908
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:41,519
STAND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

909
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,288
THIS ELECTION IN NOVEMBER IS

910
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,258
ABOUT SAFETY AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT

911
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,459
PROSPERITY, THE PROSPERITY OF

912
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:48,759
OUR COUNTRY.

913
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,596
WE ARE DOING THINGS NOW THAT

914
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:51,963
NOBODY BELIEVES.

915
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,099
WE ARE HITTING NUMBERS THAT

916
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:55,466
NOBODY BELIEVES.

917
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:59,070
HERE ARE JUST SOME OF OUR

918
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,406

WE'VE CREATED OVER 4 MILLION NEW

921
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:05,443
JOBS.

922
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,578
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS

923
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,346
POSSIBLE.

924
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,815
4 MILLION AND LIFTED ALMOST 4

925
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:18,589

WE'VE ADDED NEARLY 600,000

928
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:24,795
MANUFACTURING JOBS.

929
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:26,929
THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

930
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,833
REMEMBER WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA

931
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,234
SAID?

932
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,503
YOU CAN'T DO MANUFACTURING.

933
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,571
MAGIC WAND, RIGHT?

934
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,174
YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND.

935
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,708
YOU DON'T NEED A MAGIC WAND.

936
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:39,643
YOU NEED PROPER POLICIES.

941
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:52,822
ME SAY THIS A LOT, I'M PROUD OF

942
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:53,391
IT.

943
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:53,991
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT,

944
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,194
THINK OF IT, JUST REACHED THE

945
00:34:56,194 --> 00:35:02,032
LOWEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED.

946
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:02,233
RIGHT?

947
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:02,433
RIGHT?

948
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:02,633
RIGHT?

949
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:06,070
AFTER YEARS OF DEMOCRATS FAILING

950
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,239
AND ABANDONING

951
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,040
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, REPUBLICANS

952
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,708
ARE DELIVERING FOR

953
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,909
AFRICAN-AMERICANS LIKE NEVER

954
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:12,477
BEFORE.

955
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:16,614
WE'RE DOING THE JOB.

956
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,417
AND YOU SAW THAT THE OTHER NIGHT

957
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,452
WITH KANYE WEST.

958
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,056
HOW GOOD WAS KANYE WEST?

959
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,089
AND BIG JIM BROWN.

960
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:28,392
AND SO MANY OTHERS.

961
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,761
WE'RE SUPPORTED BY SO MANY GREAT

962
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:30,994
FOLKS.

963
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:33,397
JIM BROWN, BOY, WE COULD USE HIM

964
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,399
ON SOME OF THOSE TEAMS RIGHT

965
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,902
NOW, COULDN'T WE?

966
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,202
COULDN'T WE?

967
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,470
HISPANIC AMERICAN AND ASIAN

968
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,439
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT ALSO

969
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:48,479
REACHED ALL TIME LOWS.

970
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,714
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RECENTL

971
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,616
REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 65

972
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:51,816
YEARS.

973
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,317
THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT

974
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:53,550
SOON.

975
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,153
I THINK IT WILL BE IN HISTORY.

976
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:59,556
AND LAST WEEK I SIGNED A

977
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:02,160
GROUNDBREAKING NEW TRADE DEAL

978
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,961
WITH SOUTH KOREA THAT

979
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,063
DRAMATICALLY INCREASES AMERICAN

980
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:06,330
EXPORTS.

981
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,565
REMEMBER THAT DEAL?

982
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,766
REMEMBER THAT DEAL?

983
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,668
HILLARY CLINTON, THAT WAS A

984
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,369
HILLARY DEAL, SHE SAID WE MUST

985
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,039
HAVE THIS DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA.

986
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,510
IT WILL CREATE 250,000 JOBS.

987
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,545
AND IT DID, FOR SOUTH KOREA, NOT

988
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:21,711
US.

989
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:23,514
IT CREATED JOBS FOR SOUTH KOREA.

990
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,250
WE NOW HAVE A GOOD THING.

991
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,121
FRIEND OR FOE, FRIEND OR FOE?

992
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:30,354
FRIEND.

993
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:30,554
OKAY.

994
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:31,155
YOU NEVER KNOW.

995
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,123
WHEN YOU HEAR LITTLE NOISES LIKE

996
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:35,259
THAT, YOU SAY FOE, GET THEM OUT.

997
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,627
BUT THEY'RE FRIENDS.

998
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:41,332
WE ONLY HAVE FRIEND IN TENNESSEE

999
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:47,505
I THINK -- FRIENDS IN TENNESSEE

1000
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,439
I THINK.

1001
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,807
WE'RE ALSO ENTERING NEW TRADE

1002
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,542
TALKS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION

1003
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,978
WHICH FRANKLY HAS TREATED US

1004
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:54,244
VERY BALY.

1005
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,712
AND WITH JAPAN.

1006
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:57,348
JAPAN SEND US MILLIONS AND

1007
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,449
MILLIONS OF CARS, AND WE'RE

1008
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,117
WORKING ON A TRADE DEAL.

1009
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,687
WE'RE WORKING ON A TRADE DEAL.

1010
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,054
IT'LL BE COMING.

1011
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,490
AND WE ARE CRACKING DOWN ON

1012
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:11,629
CHINA'S UNFAIR AND ABUSIVE TRADE

1013
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,430
PRACTICES.

1014
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,631
GOT TO DO IT.

1015
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:18,903
WE'VE BEEN LOSING 300, 400, 500

1016
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,507
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO CHINA.

1017
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,575
NO MORE.

1018
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,342
NO MORE.

1019
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:25,542
RIGHT?

1020
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:26,944
NO MORE.

1021
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:27,678
CAN'T DO IT.

1022
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,747
AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER

1023
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,249
NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY

1024
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:38,489
REBUILDING OUR NATION.

1025
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,558
AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH AMERICAN

1026
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,427
ALUMINUM AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH

1027
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:43,794
AMERICAN STEEL.

1028
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:49,100
AND OUR STEEL IS DOING REALLY

1029
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,600
WELL.

1030
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:49,900
REALLY WELL.

1031
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,336
TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS

1032
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,271
OF TENNESSEE FAMILIES WE PASSED

1033
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,906
THE BIGGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS

1034
00:37:55,906 --> 00:38:02,546
AND REFORMS IN THE HISTORY OF

1035
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:02,846
OUR COUNTRY.

1036
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:05,349
AND WE ELIMINATED THE CORE OF

1037
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,616
OBAMACARE.

1038
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,852
WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL

1039
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:08,085
MANDATE.

1040
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:08,552
IT'S GONE.

1041
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:15,559
THE WORST PART OF OBAMA.

1042
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,962
AND AS BAD AS THOSE PREMIUMS

1043
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,431
ARE, WE'VE KEPT THOSE PREMIUMS

1044
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:20,631
DOWN.

1045
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,166
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS, BUT

1046
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,568
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE

1047
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,437
PREMIUMS FOR THE REMNANTS OF

1048
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:26,804
OBAMACARE DOWN.

1049
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,239
IT'LL ALL GET TAKEN CARE OF.

1050
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,708
WE NEED A FEW MORE VOTES.

1051
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,144
>> WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LOWERED

1052
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,545
HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN THE

1053
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,947
STATE 06 TENNESSEE BY 26 --

1054
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,517
STATE OF TENNESSEE BY 26%.

1055
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,118
THAT'S NOT BAD.

1056
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,486
UNDER THE PAST ADMINISTRATION IT

1057
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:47,124
WAS LIKE A ROCKET SHIP GOING UP

1058
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:51,562
-- ROCKETSHIP GOING UP TO HELP

1059
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:54,598
PEOPLE ACCESS LIFE-SAVING

1060
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,901
TREATMENTS WE JUST PASSED

1061
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,068
SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO

1062
00:38:58,068 --> 00:38:59,503
PASS FOR 45 YEARS.

1063
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,571
RIGHT TO TRY.

1064
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,574
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT?

1065
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,142
MEADOWS HELPED WITH THAT ONE.

1066
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:11,415
AND PHIL HELPED WITH THAT ONE,

1067
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:15,419
RIGHT PHIL?

1068
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,455
PHIL ROWWE.

1069
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:17,722
AND GREG.

1070
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,190
WE HAVE MEDICINES THAT HAVE

1071
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,259
GREAT HELP, GREAT FUTURE, THEY

1072
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,694
LOOK GOOD, THEY'RE PROMISING.

1073
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,164
WE HAD NO RIGHT TO GIVE THOSE

1074
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,300
MEDICINES TO SOMEONE WHO'S

1075
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,935
TERMINAL, GOING TO DIE.

1076
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,002
IF THEY HAD MONEY THEY TRAVELLED

1077
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,270
THE WORLD TO FIND A CURE.

1078
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,939
YET WE HAVE THE GREATEST DOCTORS

1079
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:39,510
AND MEDICINE IN THE WORLD HERE.

1080
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,245
BUT IT WOULD BE YEARS.

1081
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,981
IT USED TO BE 14, 15 YEARS.

1082
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,351
I THINK WE HAVE IT DOWN TO 3.5,

1083
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:47,551
4.

1084
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,855
SCOTT IS DOING A GREAT JOB, FDA.

1085
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:54,658
45 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO

1086
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,025
PASS.

1087
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,360
NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS.

1088
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,796
I WILL TELL YOU, NOT THAT EASY.

1089
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:02,165
BUT WE GOT IT PASSED.

1090
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:05,369
SO NOW SOMEBODY IS TERMINALLY

1091
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:05,536
ILL.

1092
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,570
AND IF WE'VE GOT A DRUG THAT

1093
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,772
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO HELP,

1094
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,441
WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE IT TO THOSE

1095
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:10,908
PEOPLE.

1096
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,509
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1097
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,610
ALREADY WE'VE HAD SUCCESS.

1098
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,211
SOME OF THESE DRUGS ARE WORKING.

1099
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:18,182
SOME OF THESE DOCTORINGS ARE

1100
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:18,415
WORKING.

1101
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:19,516
I'M -- DRUGS ARE WORKING.

1102
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:21,719
I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.

1103
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,252
RIGHT TO TRY.

1104
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:24,354
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE

1105
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:24,521
IT.

1106
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,957
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO USE

1107
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:27,123
IT.

1108
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:30,094
BUT IF YOU DO, DOESN'T IT MAKE

1109
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,529
SENSE INSTEAD OF IF YOU DON'T

1110
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,397
HAVE MONEY YOU GO HOME AND LAUZ

1111
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:33,864
HOPE.

1112
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,233
IF YOU HAVE MONEY -- LOSE HOPE.

1113
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,868
IF YOU HAVE MONEY YOU GO ALL

1114
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,603
OVER THE WORLD TRYING TO FIND

1115
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,437
THE CURE.

1116
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,171
RIGHT TO TRY.

1117
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:41,504
REMEMBER THAT.

1118
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:44,308
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

1119
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,810
WE ALSO PASSED VETERAN'S CHOICE.

1120
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,647
ANY VETERANS IN THE CHOICE?

1121
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:51,048
YES.

1122
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,750
YOU, YOUNG VETERAN, YOUNG.

1123
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,851
WE JUST PASSED CHOICE.

1124
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,420
THAT WAS # 4 YEARS.

1125
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,421

00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:03,561
IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE FOR

20, 30 DAYS MONTHS, YOU DON'T DO

1130
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:05,996

1140
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:22,545

00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,633
BUT WE NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO

1172
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,266

00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,245
HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST ELECTION

1310
00:48:02,245 --> 00:48:03,246
OF ALL TIME.

1311
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:10,020
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE

1312
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,220
THIS.

1313
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,489
AND WE HAD TO FIGHT THE

1314
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,657
DEMOCRATS BUT MORE DIFFICULT WAS

1315
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,227
FIGHTING A VERY VERY DISHONEST

1316
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:17,460
MEDIA.

1317
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:23,033
THAT WAS MUCH MORE -- FIGHTING

1318
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,736
THE MEDIA IS TOUGHER THAN

1319
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,803
FIGHTING THE DEMOCRATS.

1320
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,606
BUT THEY'RE EQUAL PARTNERS.

1321
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:32,009
SO YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR FRIENDS,

1322
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,211
GET YOUR FAMILY, GET YOUR

1323
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,580
NEIGHBORS, GET YOUR COWORKERS,

1324
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,516
AND GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.

1325
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,619
AND VOTE FOR MARSHA BLACKBURN

1326
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,488
AND BILL LEIGH AND ALL OF THE

1327
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:50,961
GREAT REPUBLICANS THAT ARE

1328
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:51,194
RUNNING.

1329
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:54,564
BILL LEIGH GOING TO BE A GREAT

1330
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:54,830
GOVERNOR.

1331
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:57,234
A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS SA VOTE

1332
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,604
FOR LOWER -- IS A VOTE FOR LOWER

1333
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,705
TAXES LESS REGULATION.

1334
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,106
THAT'S A BIG FACTOR.

1335
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,374
AND MORE PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT

1336
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:16,920
HERE IN THE GOOD OLD USA

1337
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,621
REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS?

1338
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:20,824
WE HAD SIGNS ON CARS AND LITTLE

1339
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,626
DECALS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1340
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,063
IT SAID MADE IN THE USA.

1341
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:26,363
GUESS WHAT?

1342
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,230
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

1343
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,534
MADE IN THE US A, IT'S COMING

1344
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:30,734
BACK.

1345
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,569
-- USA, IT'S COMING BACK.

1346
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:36,606
IT'S A VOTE TO REDUCE CRIME,

1347
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,910
RESPECT LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND

1348
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,446
RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW.

1349
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:44,648
VERY SIMPLE.

1350
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,850
IT'S A VOTE FOR STRONG VOTERS,

1351
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,351
SAFE COMMUNITIES, AND THRIVING

1352
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:48,618
FAMILIES.

1353
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,555
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A

1354
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:54,658
VOTE TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT

1355
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,128
POLITICS OF ANGER, DESTRUCTION,

1356
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,730
CHAOS, AND TO COME TOGETHER AS

1357
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,900
CITIZENS AS PATRIOTS AND AS

1358
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,166

1359
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:08,271
COME TOGETHER AS AMERICAN.

AND THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF THOSE

1364
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:22,085
CAMERAS ROLLING, UNFORTUNATELY.

1365
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:22,352

THIS IS YOUR TIME TO CHOOSE.

1377
00:50:39,602 --> 00:50:42,539
WHETHER WE TURN BACKWARD TO THE

1378
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,807
FAILURE AND FRUSTRATION OF THE

1379
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:44,007
PAST.

1380
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,243
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN FAR

1381
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:47,377
LESS THAN TWO YEARS.

1382
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,245
NOBODY BELIEVES IT.

1383
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,546
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT.

1384
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,081
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT.

1385
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,583
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO REPORT

1386
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,484
IT.

1387
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,985
SO WE REPORT IT OURSELVES.

1388
00:50:55,985 --> 00:50:57,153
THEY DON'T WANT TO REPORT IT.

1389
00:50:57,153 --> 00:51:03,560
BY THE WAY, 15% OF THEM ARE

1390
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:03,760
OKAY.

1391
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,461
85%, NO GOOD.

1392
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,097
AND IT'S ALSO A CHOICE OF

1393
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,300
WHETHER WE CONTINUE FORWARD INTO

1394
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,635
THE UNLIMITED PROMISE OF OUR

1395
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,404
FUTURE OF THIS GREAT LAND, THIS

1396
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:14,737
GREAT COUNTRY.

1397
00:51:14,737 --> 00:51:16,773
WE WERE LOSING OUR COUNTRY.

1398
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,074
I'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE COME UP

1399
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,910

1402
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,213
PEOPLE.

1403
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,948
AND THEY HAVE TEARS IN THEIR

1404
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,284
EYES SAY MR. PRESIDENT -- I SAW

1405
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,487
ONE TONIGHT, CAME UP TO ME, A

1406
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:30,653
MAN.

1407
00:51:30,653 --> 00:51:31,855
TOUGH COOKIE, WOULDN'T WANT TO

1408
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:32,889
FIGHT HIM, 0 CAY?

1409
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,491
AND HE SAID -- OKAY?

1410
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,626
AND HE SAID MR. PRESIDENT, HE'S

1411
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,128
CRYING, HE SAID THANK YOU FOR

1412
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:38,962
SAVING OUR COUNTRY.

1413
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,864
SO MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT.

1414
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:47,670
SO MANY PEOPLE.

1415
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,973
IT IS NOT UP TO THE MEDIA TO

1416
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:50,373
DECIDE OUR FATE.

1417
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:54,010
IT IS NOT UP TO THE POLLSTERS OR

1418
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,512
THE PUNDITS, ALTHOUGH OUR POLLS

1419
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:56,980
ARE VERY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

1420
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,582
THEY'RE GOING NUTS WITH THAT

1421
00:51:58,582 --> 00:51:58,748
ONE.

1422
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,984
THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN WE HAVE

1423
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,485
GOOD POLLS, SO USUALLY THEY MAKE

1424
00:52:02,485 --> 00:52:04,220
UP PHONY POLLS.

1425
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,623
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

1426
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,525
THEY'RE CALLED REPRESSION.

1427
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,158
IT'S REPRESSION.

1428
00:52:09,158 --> 00:52:11,561
DARLING, YOU KNOW THE STORY.

1429
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,630

1430
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,465
DARLING, I REALLY LIKE DONALD

1431
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,400
TRUMP, BUT YOU KNOW, HE CAN'T

1432
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,602
WIN BECAUSE CNN DID A POLL.

1433
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:21,738
HEY, DID THOSE POLLS TURN OUT TO

1434
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,540
BE WRONG OR WHAT?

1435
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,811
BUT IT'S CALLED REPRESSION.

1436
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,647
IT'S CALLED REPRESSION.

1437
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,714
THEY'RE PHONY POLLS.

1438
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:34,884
JUST LIKE FAKE NEWS, THEY'RE

1439
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:36,052

1440
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,355
BUT THEY SAID, DARLING, I REALLY

1441
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,889
LIKE THAT GUY, BUT THE POLLS SAY

1442
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:42,058
ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE NEWS,

1443
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:44,227
THE MEDIA, BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE

1444
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,428
THINK IT'S LEGIT ALTHOUGH THAT'S

1445
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,430
CHANGED A VERY LOT, THEY SAID

1446
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,065
DARLING, LET'S GO TO A MOVIE,

1447
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,767
AND THEN WE'LL COME HOME AND

1448
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,035
WATCH OUR FRIEND DONALD.

1449
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,670
IT'S SO SAD WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1450
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,505
I MEAN AS AN EXAMPLE I HEARD,

00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,610
I HEARD HE'S GOING TO LOSE UTAH.

1454
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,046
I HEARD HE'S GOING TO LOSE

1455
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:03,513

SO SAD.

1457
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:06,283
SO SAD.

1458
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,450

1503
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,350
DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE STATE

1504
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:47,683

PENNSYLVANIA HADN'T BEEN WON FOR

1514
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,601
MANY YEARS BY A REPUBLICAN.

1515
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:05,568
GREAT STATE, GREAT PEOPLE.

1516
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,370

00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,706
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO,

1519
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:10,239
BUT ALL REPUBLICANS THINK

1520
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:12,375
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WELL IN

1521
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:12,708

THERE WAS 1% OF THE VOTE LEFT.

1527
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,184
IF WE LOST EVERY SINGLE VOTE WE

1528
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:23,153
WIN BY A LOT.

1529
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,120
THEY REFUSED TO ANNOUNCE IT.

1530
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,889
THEY REFUSED.

1531
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,290

1:00 IN THE MORNING.

1534
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:31,327
I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, IF I LOST

1535
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,097
EVERY SINGLE VOTE I WIN BY A

1536
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:34,831
LOT, ANNOUNCE IT.

1537
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,865
THEY WOULDN'T ANNOUNCE IT.

1538
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,234
BUT THEY HAD TO ANNOUNCE

1539
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,136
WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, SO NOTHING

01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,084

01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:56,219
SPEECH ATTEMPT TO LINK THE

1679
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,922

PELOSI AND MAXINE WATERS.

1683
01:01:07,496 --> 01:01:09,632
THE PRESIDENT THERE HITTING

1684
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:14,003

1685
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,470
IMMIGRATION AND OTHER KIND OF

1686
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,438
THAEMS THAT WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE

1687
01:01:16,438 --> 01:01:18,007

1688
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,609
BEFORE IN THESE PARTICULAR

1689
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:19,876
SETTINGS.

1690
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,077
AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH, LET'S

1691
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:24,046
BRING IN JOEL, A REPORTER FROM

1692
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:24,313
TENNESSEE.

1693
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:25,848
HE JOINS US FROM NASHVILLE.

1694
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:26,549
WE HAVE WEIJIA JIANG TRAVELING

1695
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,384
WITH THE PRESIDENT AS WELL

1696
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,586
JOINING US FROM JOHNSON CITY,

1697
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:30,853
TENNESSEE.

1698
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,121
WEIJIA, LET ME START WITH YOU.

1699
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,589
YOU HAVE ATTENDED A NUMBER OF

1700
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,091
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RALLIES, WHAT

1701
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,659
STOOD OUT TO YOU ABOUT HIS

1702
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,627
MESSAGE THERE IN TENNESSEE?

1703
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:41,063
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK, ELAINE, AS

1704
01:01:41,063 --> 01:01:44,600
WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE

1705
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,267
MIDTERM ELECTIONS, IT'S ACTUALLY

1706
01:01:45,267 --> 01:01:48,271
BECOMING MORE CLEAR THAT THE

1707
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,639
PRESIDENT IS EYEING 2020.

1708
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,408
AND AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE

1709
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:54,544
MIDTERMS, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH HE

1710
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,079
IS REALLY LINKING THESE

1711
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:58,214
CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS WITH A

1712
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,315
VOTE FOR HIM.

1713
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,517
AND HE HAS SAID AS MUCH TONIGHT

1714
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,419
IS NO EXCEPTION SAYING THAT A

1715
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,755
VOTE FOR MARSHA BLACKBURN IS A

1716
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:06,656
VOTE FOR ME.

1717
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,958
AND TONIGHT MORE THAN THE

1718
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:09,959
PREVIOUS SEVERAL RALLIES, I HAVE

1719
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,595
TO SAY IT REALLY FELT LIKE HE

1720
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,297
WAS BRINGING UP 2016.

1721
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,464
IN FACT, HE TALKED AT LENGTH

1722
01:02:15,464 --> 01:02:18,100
ABOUT HOW THE POLLS GOT IT

1723
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:18,300
WRONG.

1724
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,302
HE POINTED OUT ALL THE STATES

1725
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:20,737
THAT WENT TO HIM THAT WERE NOT

1726
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,371
EXPECTED 20 GO TO HIM.

1727
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,141
AND TALK -- TO GO TO HIM AND

1728
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:26,108
TALKED ABOUT HOW GREAT IT WAS

1729
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:28,778
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO WIN DESPITE

1730
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,414
WHAT THE NUMBERS HAD PREDICTED.

1731
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,447
REMEMBER, HERE WE ARE ALMOST TWO

1732
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,851
YEARS IN HIS PRESIDENCY AND HE'S

1733
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,552
STILL DWELLING ON THIS, AGAIN,

1734
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,954
BECAUSE HE IS RAMPING UP NOT

1735
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,589
ONLY FOR THE MIDTERMS, BUT I

1736
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,257
BELIEVE FOR 2020.

1737
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,894
HE MENTIONED BY NAME POTENTIAL

1738
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,796
DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS FOR

1739
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:47,496
PRESIDENT IN 2020.

1740
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:49,866
AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS SURPRISED

1741
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:50,433
ABOUT, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

1742
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,201
TIMING OF WHAT A VICTORY HE HAD

1743
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,870
THIS MORNING BECAUSE WE JUST SAW

1744
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,504
HIM IN THE ROSE GARDEN.

1745
01:02:55,504 --> 01:02:57,139
AND EVEN THOUGH TWO MINUTES INTO

1746
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:59,776
THIS RALLY HE DID MENTION THE

1747
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,277
NEW NAFTA DEAL, WHICH HE JUST

1748
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,745
ANNOUNCED TODAY AT THE WHITE

1749
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:04,080
HOUSE, HE REALLY DIDN'T TALK

1750
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:04,880
ABOUT LENGTH ABOUT IT.

1751
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,350
IT WAS JUST SORT OF LIKE AN

1752
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:07,683
ANNOUNCEMENT.

1753
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:08,283
THIS HAPPENED TODAY.

1754
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:11,187
THIS IS WHAT I PROMISED AS PART

1755
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:11,788
OF MY CAMPAIGN.

1756
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,655
HERE WE ARE.

1757
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,690
BUT THEN HE MOVED ON VERY

1758
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:15,925
QUICKLY INSTEAD OF TOUTING IT AS

1759
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:18,027
MUCH AS I EXPECTED.

1760
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:21,464
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT UP JUDGE

1761
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:21,831
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

1762
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,166
BUT OVERALL IT WAS SORT OF JUST

1763
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:26,235
CLIFF NOTES OF ALL THE THINGS HE

1764
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,070
PROMISED HE WOULD DO THAT HE

1765
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,672
BELIEVES ARE BEING ACCOMPLISHED

1766
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,107
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS RACE IN

1767
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,542
THE MIDTERMS IS SO TIGHT AND SO

1768
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:33,742
CLOSE.

1769
01:03:33,742 --> 01:03:36,212
AND HE KNOWS THAT IT DOES HAVE

1770
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,981
HUGE IMPACTS ON HIS PRESIDENCY

1771
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,350
WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW, BEFORE

1772
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,518
OR DURING THE 2020 CAMPAIGN.

1773
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:45,420
>> JOEL, LET'S GET SOME CONTEXT

1774
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,722
FROM YOU AS WELL.

1775
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,157
SO TENNESSEE, OF COURSE, IS A

1776
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:48,757
RED STATE.

1777
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:50,493
THE PRESIDENT WAS CAMPAIGNING

1778
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,660
THERE FOR REPUBLICAN

1779
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,062
CONGRESSWOMAN MARSHA BLACKBURN.

1780
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,464
SHE'S LOOKING TO REPLACE

1781
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,266
RETIRING XOP SENATOR BOB CORKER

1782
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,268
-- GOP SENATOR BOB CORKER.

1783
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:01,704
IT'S A TIGHT CONTEST AGAINST

1784
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,973
FORMER GOVERNOR PHIL BREDISON.

1785
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,307
WHY IS THIS RACE SO COMPETITIVE?

1786
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:07,410
>> I THINK JUST LARGELY BECAUSE

1787
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:10,613
OF THE POPULARITY OF PHIL

1788
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,247
BREDISON.

1789
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,982
A TWO-TIME GOVERNOR, THE LAST

1790
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:14,784
DEMOCRAT TO WIN STATEWIDE.

1791
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:19,655
YOU KNOW, AND THIS HAS REALLY

1792
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:21,991
ENERGIZED FOLKS, HIS CANDIDACY

1793
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,960
GOT PEOPLE EXCITED AGAIN IN

1794
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,226
TENNESSEE.

1795
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:25,628
TENNESSEE HAS BECOME SO

1796
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,396
REPUBLICAN SINCE BREDISON WAS

1797
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,665
LAST IN OFFICE IN 2010 THAT HE

1798
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,267
IS REALLY KIND OF SEEN AS THE

1799
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,703
ONLY PERSON WITH THE PARTY THAT

1800
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,337
WOULD STAND A CHANCE AT GIVING

1801
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:38,407
DEMOCRATS A SHOT AT THIS RACE.

1802
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,242
SO WITHOUT PHIL BREDISON THIS

1803
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:42,044
RACE WOULDN'T BE THIS CLOSE.

1804
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,879
>> SO THEN, JOEL, JUST TO FOLLOW

1805
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:45,748
UP ON THAT NOTION, WHEN THE

1806
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:46,882
PRESIDENT TRIES AS HE DID

1807
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:50,052
TONIGHT TO LINK A PERSON LIKE A

1808
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,888
GOVERNOR BREDISON TO THE SORT OF

1809
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:54,690
MORE LIBERAL MEMBERS OF THE

1810
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,626
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND NATIONAL

1811
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,161
FIGURES LIKE CHUCK SCHUMER, LIKE

1812
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,131
NANCY PELOSI, HOW DOES THAT LAND

1813
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,532
NECESSARILY WITH VOTERS IN

1814
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:03,799
TENNESSEE?

1815
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,168
>> WELL, I THINK THERE'S A LOT

1816
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:06,702
OF SKEPTICS.

1817
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,437
I MEAN, BREDISON HAS ALWAYS BEEN

1818
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,507
SORT OF AN INDEPENDENT MANDED

1819
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:11,741
PERSON.

1820
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,942
HE IS NOT -- MINDED PERSON.

1821
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,378
HE IS NOT SOMEONE WHO SAYS I'M A

1822
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,079
DEMOCRAT SO I'M GOING TO VOTE

1823
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,481
WITH THE DEMOCRATS.

1824
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:19,415
HE'S TRIED TO REPEATEDLY SAY

1825
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,584
THIS THROUGHOUT HIS CAMPAIGN.

1826
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,453
AS FAR AS THE NATIONALIZATION, I

1827
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:25,755
THINK BREDISON TRIED TO UNDERCUT

1828
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,589
THAT LAST WEEK DURING A DEBATE

1829
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:29,558
WITH MARSHA BLACKBURN WHERE HE

1830
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,560
SAID I'M NOT GOING TO SIDE WITH

1831
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,595
CHUCK SCHUMER, AND I'M NOT GOING

1832
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,530
TO VOTE AND SUPPORT HIS

1833
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,598
CONTINUED LEADERSHIP WITH THE

1834
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:35,865
PARTY.

1835
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,900
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS THE

1836
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,502
ISSUE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE

1837
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,671
HOPING IT IS AS FAR AS LINKING

1838
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,506
BREDISON TO NATIONAL DEMOCRATS.

1839
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:46,042
>> WELL, WEIJIA, PRESIDENT TRUMP

1840
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,344
AS YOU MENTIONED DID ADDRESS

1841
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:48,711
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

1842
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,613
HE BLAMED THE DELAY IN THE

1843
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,214
CONFIRMATION VOTE ON DEMOCRATS.

1844
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,917
AND LET'S LISTEN TO SOME OF

1845
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:55,117
THAT.

1846
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,286
>> DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO DO

1847
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,256
ANYTHING AND TO HURT ANYONE TO

1848
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:06,695
GET THEIR WAY LIKE THEY'RE DOING

1849
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:08,964
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

1850
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:11,000
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DESTROY

1851
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,068
HIM SINCE THE VERY FIRST SECOND

1852
01:06:13,068 --> 01:06:15,004
HE WAS ANNOUNCED BECAUSE THEY

1853
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,173
KNOW THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL

1854
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:18,741
FOLLOW THE CONSTITUION AS

1855
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:18,974
WRITTEN.

1856
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:21,710
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

1857
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,078
GREAT STUDENT, GREAT INTELLECT.

1858
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:24,913
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM ALL OF A

1859
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:28,050
SUDDEN, OH, LET'S GO BACK TO

1860
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:28,350
HIGH SCHOOL.

1861
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,052
THEY MAYBE SHOULD GO BEFORE HIGH

1862
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:30,553
SCHOOL.

1863
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:31,287
>> OKAY.

1864
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:32,621
WEIJIA, NOTABLE, THERE WAS NO

1865
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,556
MENTION THAT I DETECTED OF

1866
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:36,092
REPUBLICAN SENATOR JEFF FLAKE

1867
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,493
WHO ACTUALLY DID CALL FOR THAT

1868
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,462
ONE-WEEK PAUSE AND WAS ABLE TO

1869
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,765
OBTAIN IT ALONG WITH HIS FELLOW

1870
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,034
REPUBLICAN SENATORS, SUSAN

1871
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:47,169
COLLINS, AND LISA MURKOWSKI, BUT

1872
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,637
WHAT ELSE DID THE PRESIDENT SAY

1873
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,639
ABOUT HIS SUPREME COURT NOMINEE?

1874
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,007
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, ELAINE, NO

1875
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:54,176
MENTION OF JEFF FLAKE, AND NO

1876
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,010
MENTION OF HIS DECISION.

1877
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:57,213
REMEMBER, HE IS THE ONE THAT

1878
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,515
ORDERED THIS FBI INVESTIGATION

1879
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,282
ON FRIDAY.

1880
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:01,550
ASK THEN TODAY THE WHITE HOUSE

1881
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:02,852
-- AND THEN TODAY THE WHITE

1882
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,254
HOUSE SAID THE FBI IS FREE TO

1883
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,655
INTERVIEW WHOEVER THEY WANT THAT

1884
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,223
INSTEAD OF PUTTING ANY SORT OF

1885
01:07:08,223 --> 01:07:09,925
LIMIT ON THE SCOPE OF THE

1886
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:13,028
INVESTIGATION THAT IT IS NOW UP

1887
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:15,163
TO INVESTIGATORS TO QUESTION

1888
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:17,800
WHOEVER THEY WANT, TO FOCUS ON

1889
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,500
WHATEVER SUBJECTS THEY WANT AS

1890
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,103
LONG AS THE TIME LIMIT REMAINS

1891
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:21,504
IN PLACE.

1892
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:22,238
EVEN THOUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

1893
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,740
THE WITHIN WHO CALLED FOR THEM

1894
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,510
TO BEGIN THIS PROBE TO GET SOME

1895
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,079
ANSWERS TO FIND SOME FACTS

1896
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,413
TONIGHT HE JUST BLAMED THE

1897
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:35,351
DEMOCRATS FOR TRYING TO DESTROY

1898
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,086
A FINE PERSON, MAKING THIS JUST

1899
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,321
A POLITICAL CONVERSATION AGAIN

1900
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,456
INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT HE WOULD

1901
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,058
LIKE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THIS

1902
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:45,261
INVESTIGATION AND HE WILL MAKE

1903
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,630
UP HIS MIND AFTER THE FBI

1904
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,397
RETURNS RESULTS.

1905
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,799
AND I THINK, ELAINE, FROM THE

1906
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,268
VERY BEGINNING THAT'S WHY IT'S

1907
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:53,068
BEEN CONFUSING TO FOLLOW THE

1908
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:55,404
PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE BLAEFS

1909
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,473
ABOUT KAVANAUGH -- BELIEVES

1910
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,275
ABOUT KAVANAUGH BECAUSE IT

1911
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,509
FLIP-FLOPS DAY TO DAY.

1912
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,978
ON THE ONE HAND HE SAID HE

1913
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:03,611
THINKS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE

1914
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:05,447
FBI DOES THEIR WORK AND

1915
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:06,215
INTERVIEWS WHOEVER THEY BELIEVE

1916
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:10,119
IS FIT TO GET SOME ANSWERS, BUT

1917
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,021
JUST HOURS LATER BECAUSE THE

1918
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:12,955
CROWD IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

1919
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:16,091
THIS IS THE CORE OF HIS BASE

1920
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,194
HE'S TURNING IT INTO A POLITICAL

1921
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,562
SITUATION SAYING THAT THIS IS

1922
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,697
JUST BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ARE

1923
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,600
TRYING TO OBSTRUCT THE

1924
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:24,899
NOMINATION.

1925
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:26,469
BUT YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN THAT,

1926
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:27,303
HE MOVED ON.

1927
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,270
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO SPEND

1928
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,006
TOO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT

1929
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:35,444
KAVANAUGH BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A

1930
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,545
POLARIZING ISSUE RIGHT NOW.

1931
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:37,813
AND BHAUZ HE'S AWARE THAT IT'S

1932
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:44,252
-- BECAUSE HE'S AWARE THAT IT'S

1933
01:08:44,252 --> 01:08:48,256
NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, BUT SOME

1934
01:08:48,256 --> 01:08:50,292
CRITICAL REPUBLICANS THAT HE

1935
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,894
NEEDS TO VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH THAT

1936
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:52,861
ARE LISTENING AND WATCHING.

1937
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:54,430
HE KNOWS WHAT THE CROWD HERE

1938
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,564
PROBABLY EXPECT HIM TO SAY.

1939
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,832
>> AND JOEL, IS THERE ANY WAY TO

1940
01:08:57,832 --> 01:08:59,100
TELL MORE BROADLY THERE IN YOUR

1941
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,403
STATE, IN TENNESSEE, HOW MUCH

1942
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,505
THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION IS

1943
01:09:03,505 --> 01:09:05,541
RESONATING AS AN ISSUE WITH

1944
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:05,774
VOTERS?

1945
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:07,609
>> IT REALLY IS KIND OF HARD.

1946
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:09,912
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT MUCH

1947
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,113
POLLING ON THIS.

1948
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,648
MARSHA BLACKBURN SAYS, YOU KNOW,

1949
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,549
THROUGHOUT HER CAMPAIGNS THAT IT

1950
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:23,259
IS ONE OF THE TOP S THAT SHE

1951
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,493
-- TOP ISSUES THAT SHE TALKS

1952
01:09:25,493 --> 01:09:27,229
WITH VOTERS ABOUT.

1953
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,497
BREDISON HAD A FORUM IN

1954
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:29,798
CHATTANOOGA.

1955
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:30,866
APPARENTLY, ACCORDING TO AN AP

1956
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,368
REPORTER WHO WAS THERE, BREDISON

1957
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:35,371
BROUGHT UP HE HADN'T REACHED A

1958
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:37,573
DECISION ON KAVANAUGH YET.

1959
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,441
AND AGAIN, ACCORDING TO THE AP

1960
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,443
REPORTER HE GOT SOME BOOS FOR

1961
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:41,710
THAT.

1962
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,279
AND IF THAT IS THE CASE, THAT

1963
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,682
SHOWS, YOU KNOW, AND THIS IS A

1964
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:47,215
PRETTY BREDISON FRIENDLY

1965
01:09:47,215 --> 01:09:49,585
AUDIENCE AT THE EVENT I. SHOWS

1966
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,118
THAT MAYBE IT'S -- EVENT.

1967
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:52,520
IT SHOWS THAT MAYBE IT'S A

1968
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,089
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE PEOPLE CARE

1969
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:54,288
ABOUT.

1970
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:56,058
I'VE TALKED TO SOME LAWMAKERS

1971
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,327
AND STATE LAWMAKERS WHO SAY IT

1972
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,230
IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR

1973
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:01,664
THIS ELEK.

1974
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,565
>> CERTAINLY -- ELECTION.

1975
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:05,501
>> CERTAINLY EMOTIONALLY

1976
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:05,734
CHARGED.

1977
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,102
JOEL AND WEIJIA JIANG THANKS TO

1978
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:07,368

01:10:07,368 --> 01:10:08,671
APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT.

>> THANKS, ELAINE.

01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,808
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A

1983
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:13,575
QUICK BREAK.

1984

MUCH MORE NEWS AHEAD.

1985
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:15,777
