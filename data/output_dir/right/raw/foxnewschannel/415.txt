1
00:00:01,382 --> 00:00:02,482
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT PULLING

2
00:00:02,483 --> 00:00:04,951
ANY PUNCHES AND BRINGS US TO

3
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:05,719
OUR HEADLINER KELLYANNE CONWAY

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,387
TO THE NORTH LAWN.

5
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:08,955
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

6
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:09,890
>> GOOD MORNING.

7
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,291
>> Bill: TWO THINGS I WANT TO

8
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:11,858
SET UP WITH.

9
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:13,160
THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT IN

10
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:14,494
MISSISSIPPI SAID THE FOLLOWING

11
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:16,363
ABOUT DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY.

12
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,165
JUST A QUICK CLIP FROM THAT.

13
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:18,899
WATCH.

14
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,534
>> President Trump: 36 YEARS

15
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:22,836
AGO THIS HAPPENED.

16
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:24,838
I HAD ONE BEER, RIGHT?

17
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,840
I HAD ONE BEER.

18
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:28,708
WELL, YOU THINK -- NOPE, IT WAS

19
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:29,176
ONE BEER.

20
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:29,476
GOOD.

21
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,278
HOW DID YOU GET HOME?

22
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,779
I DON'T REMEMBER.

23
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,749
HOW DID YOU GET THERE?

24
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,616
I DON'T REMEMBER.

25
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:39,019
HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS IT?

26
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,821
I DON'T KNOW.

27
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:42,989
>> Bill: THAT COMMENT HAS

28
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,157
GOTTEN A LOT OF REACTION.

29
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:46,026
SOME PEOPLE THINK HE WAS

30
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:46,726
MOCKING HER.

31
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:48,828
OTHERS SUGGESTED HE WAS

32
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,230
POINTING OUT INCONSISTENCIES IN

33
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,164
HER STORY.

34
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:52,332
WHATEVER IT IS, SUSAN COLLINS,

35
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,234
A CRITICAL VOTE IN THIS A

36
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:55,635
MOMENT AGO TALKED TO OUR FOX

37
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:56,803
CREW ON CAPITOL HILL AND SAID

38
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:58,205
THE FOLLOWING ABOUT THOSE

39
00:00:58,206 --> 00:00:58,572
COMMENTS.

40
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:01,008
JUST ROLL THIS QUICKLY.

41
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:02,543
>> THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS

42
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:03,844
WERE JUST PLAIN WRONG.

43
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:05,946
>> Bill: IT WAS THAT SIMPLE AND

44
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:06,446
SHORT.

45
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:08,749
YOUR REACTION ON THAT,

46
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,116
KELLYANNE.

47
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:10,384
WERE THEY WRONG, WERE THEY

48
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:10,784
UNNECESSARY?

49
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:14,621
WHAT IS THE POSITION ON THAT?

50
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:16,490
>> BILL, SINCE THE ACCUSER WAS

51
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:18,926
REVEALED IN THE "WASHINGTON

52
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:21,261
POST" STORY SOME 17 DAYS AGO,

53
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:23,163
EVERYBODY INCLUDING THIS WHITE

54
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:25,032
HOUSE, THIS PRESIDENT, THE

55
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:26,433
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THE

56
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,102
MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS BEEN

57
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:31,171
INCREDIBLY ACCOMMODATING TO HER

58
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:33,040
WISH TO TESTIFY, TO GIVING HER

59
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,074
THE SPACE AND DEFERENCE SHE

60
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:35,475
NEEDED TO DO SO.

61
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:37,044
SHE PROVIDED HER TESTIMONY.

62
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:40,080
SHE STILL HAS NO CORROBORATION

63
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,781
FOR HER TESTIMONY.

64
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:42,649
THERE IS STILL NO EVIDENCE, NO

65
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,284
WITNESSES THAT CONFIRMED AS FAR

66
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:45,152
AS WE KNOW.

67
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:46,887
AN EXPANDED F.B.I.

68
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:47,354
INVESTIGATION.

69
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:49,089
WE AREN'T MICROMANAGING THIS

70
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,423
PROCESS.

71
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:51,792
WE HAVE ALLOWED -- WE HAVE SAID

72
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:53,193
SURE, IF THE SENATE JUDICIARY

73
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:55,295
COMMITTEE WANTS TO HAVE THE

74
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:56,396
F.B.I. INVESTIGATE A LITTLE

75
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:57,431
FARTHER, THEN THEY'RE DOING

76
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:57,731
THAT.

77
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,533
WE ARE NOT MANAGING THE SCOPE,

78
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:00,467
THE WITNESSES, ANYTHING LIKE

79
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:00,767
THAT.

80
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:04,404
AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRESIDENT

81
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:07,207
IS POINTING OUT FACTUAL

82
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:07,674
INCONSISTENCIES.

83
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:10,043
BY FORD'S OWN TESTIMONY THERE

84
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:11,912
ARE GAPS IN HER MEMORY, THERE

85
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,780
ARE FACTS THAT SHE CANNOT

86
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:14,147
REMEMBER.

87
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:16,116
HOW SHE GOT HOME, HOW SHE GOT

88
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:16,416
THERE.

89
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:19,219
WHERE THE HOUSE WAS, WHAT THE

90
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,586
DATE WAS.

91
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:22,189
IF THOSE PRETENDING THEY WANT

92
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,057
TO FIND THE TRUTH, DON'T SAY WE

93
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,692
CAN'T FIND THE TRUTH WHEN SHE

94
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:26,894
DOESN'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS.

95
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,495
THAT'S PART OF THE TESTIMONY

96
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,831
SHE PUT IN UNDER SWORN

97
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:31,231
STATEMENTS.

98
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:32,165
LOOK, DELAY HAS NOT BEEN A

99
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,166
FRIEND TO HER, EITHER.

100
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:34,835
YOU HAVE PEOPLE FROM HER LIFE

101
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:35,969
COMING FORWARD WANTING TO SAY

102
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,470
THINGS.

103
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:38,372
YOU HAVE THE REVELATION BY

104
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:39,907
SENATOR HATCH THAT PERHAPS DR.

105
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:41,542
FORD'S OWN ATTORNEYS MAY HAVE

106
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,644
VIOLATED A STANDARD UNDER THE

107
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:45,779
ABA IN NOT PROVIDING HER THE

108
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,881
OPTION THAT THE SENATE

109
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:49,283
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE REPUBLICANS

110
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:50,450
OFFERED HER, TO TESTIFY

111
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:51,151
PRIVATELY IN CALIFORNIA.

112
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:53,854
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO HER.

113
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:55,022
THEN THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

114
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:55,956
CAMERAS AND THE ATTORNEYS

115
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:57,157
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THEIR MOMENT

116
00:02:57,158 --> 00:02:59,326
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

117
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:02,396
SO THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT, I

118
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:03,564
THINK, SATELLITES FLOATING

119
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:05,433
AROUND THE CORE ISSUE HERE,

120
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:06,600
SHOULD BRETT KAVANAUGH BE

121
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:07,768
CONFIRMED TO THE UNITED STATES

122
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,403
SUPREME COURT AS A NOMINEE?

123
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:11,405
SO FAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEER

124
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,907
AND ICE THIS WEEK.

125
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,308
>> Sandra: WILL HE BE CONFIRMED

126
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,177
BUT BEFORE THAT WE NEED TO KNOW

127
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:17,812
WHEN THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION

128
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:18,212
WILL WRAP.

129
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:21,115
HAVE YOU OR THE WHITE HOUSE,

130
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:21,916
THE PRESIDENT, RECEIVED ANY

131
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,217
UPDATES YOU CAN SHARE WITH US

132
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:25,085
ON THE INVESTIGATION.

133
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:29,490
>> YOU SEE WHAT LEADER

134
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:30,424
MCCONNELL SAID PUBLICLY.

135
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:33,227
HE IS SCHEDULING A VOTE THIS

136
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:33,527
WEEK.

137
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:36,030
COULD FILE CLOTURE VERY SOON.

138
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:38,165
AND THAT THE F.B.I.

139
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:38,866
INVESTIGATION THAT WAS

140
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:42,937
REQUESTED BY MEMBERS OF THE

141
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,071
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,

142
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,039
INCLUDING JEFF FLAKE, SAID THAT

143
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,408
HE WANTED IT TO NOT BE LONGER

144
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,375
THAN A WEEK.

145
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:52,079
IF THE F.B.I. FEELS THAT IS

146
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,848
AMPLE TIME FOR THEM TO EXECUTE

147
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,916
ON THE LIMITED SCOPE OF THE

148
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:56,350
INVESTIGATION.

149
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,052
REMEMBER, THIS IS NOT A

150
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:00,054
CRIMINAL OR CIVIL PROCEEDING.

151
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:03,591
IT IS PURSUANT TO THE SENATE

152
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:04,525
CONFIRMATION HEARING OF JUDGE

153
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:05,459
KAVANAUGH TO THE UNITED STATES

154
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,026
SUPREME COURT.

155
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:09,163
WE NOW HAVE A SUPREME COURT

156
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:09,997
WITHOUT ITS NINTH JUSTICE AND

157
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:12,199
YOU SEE A LOT OF THE POLLS

158
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,434
WHERE AMERICANS WANT THIS TO

159
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:14,835
COME TO ITS COMPLETION.

160
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:16,671
SPEAKING OF POLLING, I WANT TO

161
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,306
MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR I HAVEN'T

162
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:21,375
HEARD OTHERS MENTION.

163
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,244
FOR ALL THE SCREAMING THAT THIS

164
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:25,346
IS HELPING THE HARD LEFT, WHICH

165
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:27,682
IS THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC PARTY

166
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,550
AND ENERGIZING ITS BASE AND AN

167
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:31,452
EXTENDED PART OF THE #METOO

168
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:32,053
MOVEMENT, ETC.

169
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:35,556
ONLY IF THE VICTIMS OF THE

170
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:36,624
#METOO MOVEMENT ARE DEMOCRATS.

171
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,427
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S

172
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:41,562
TWEET AFTER JUDGE KAVANAUGH

173
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:42,863
TESTIFIED HE GOT OVER 300,000

174
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,131
LIKES WITHIN 24 HOURS.

175
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,934
THAT'S A LOT OF LIKES FOR A

176
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:48,803
PRESIDENTIAL TWEET AND YOUR OWN

177
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:49,971
PRIME TIMELINE-UP ON THAT SAME

178
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:53,274
NIGHT THURSDAY FOLLOWING THE

179
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,343
HISTORIC TESTIMONY, YOU HAD 5.3

180
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:57,078
MILLION VIEWERS IN YOUR PRIME

181
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,478
TIMELINE-UP.

182
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,714
BUT IT TELLS ME THAT THE

183
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:00,949
PRESIDENT FOCUSING ON THE

184
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,517
SUPREME COURT AND THAT FOLKS

185
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:03,851
WHO CARE ABOUT THE SUPREME

186
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,155
COURT ARE VERY FOCUSED ON WHAT

187
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:07,257
WE WANT TO POP OUT OF THIS AND

188
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:08,692
FINISH UP WITH KELLYANNE CONWAY.

189
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:10,460
YOU ARE LISTENING TO THIS,

190
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:10,828
KELLYANNE.

191
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:11,995
YOU DROPPED A BIT OF A HEADLINE

192
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:13,630
THE OTHER DAY ON SUNDAY WHEN

193
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:14,865
YOU WERE BEING INTERVIEWED

194
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:18,001
SAYING THAT YOU WERE A VICTIM

195
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,169
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT YOURSELF AND

196
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,739
AS YOU LISTEN TO MITCH

197
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,108
MCCONNELL AND FOLLOWED THIS

198
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:27,611
DEBATE OF DR. FORD AND THE

199
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:28,312
CONFIRMATION VOTE OF BRETT

200
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:30,681
KAVANAUGH, WHAT MORE DO YOU

201
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,116
WANT TO ADD ABOUT THE CONTEXT

202
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:35,319
THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR OWN LIFE

203
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,520
ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU

204
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,256
HAVE BROUGHT TO THIS ISSUE?

205
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:41,358
>> NONE, I DON'T INTEND TO BE

206
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,760
THE STORY AND IT WASN'T PLANNED

207
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,194
BUT I WILL REPEAT THE FULL

208
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:45,362
SENTENCE FOR YOU BECAUSE I

209
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:48,198
DIDN'T LEAVE IT AT THAT.

210
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,000
I PUT COMMA, THEREFORE, I DON'T

211
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,268
HOLD ALL MEN RESPONSIBLE FOR

212
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:52,202
THAT.

213
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:53,137
I HOLD THE PERPETRATOR

214
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:53,837
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

215
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,173
AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE

216
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:58,442
JUDGING THE HARM, THE GRIEF,

217
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:01,412
AND THE IMPACT ON THOSE WHO

218
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,347
HAVE SUFFERED SEXUAL

219
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:05,416
HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULT,

220
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:05,916
RAPE.

221
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:06,917
WE SHOULDN'T JUDGE THAT

222
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,252
ACCORDING TO THEIR POLITICS.

223
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:10,421
AND WHETHER YOU WORK FOR

224
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:12,022
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHETHER YOU'RE

225
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:14,358
A LIFE LONG REGISTERED DEMOCRAT

226
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,859
OR HAVE DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEYS.

227
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,794
CERTAINLY WHETHER YOU ARE

228
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,929
NOMINATED TO THE UNITED STATES

229
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,898
SUPREME COURT BY PRESIDENT

230
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:21,298
TRUMP.

231
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:24,301
SO THAT WAS MY ENTIRE POINT

232
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,805
THAT NOW WE'RE BLAMING ALL MEN,

233
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,206
MITCH MCCONNELL BEING CHASED

234
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:31,075
THROUGH AN AIRPORT WITH THE

235
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:32,242
FOUR LETTER WORD RAPE BEING

236
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:33,177
THROWN AT HIM.

237
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,346
IT'S A DISGRACE AND THE COUNTRY

238
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:35,779
SEES IT.

239
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,282
A LOT OF POLLS, A LOT OF VOTERS

240
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:40,751
HUMMING ALONG AGREEING BUT NOT

241
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:41,919
INTENSELY SO, ARE SWINGING BACK

242
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,021
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LATEST POLL.

243
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:46,357
THAT'S NOT A GREAT POLL USUALLY

244
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:47,091
FOR REPUBLICANS AND

245
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:47,992
CONSERVATIVES BECAUSE PEOPLE

246
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:49,427
ARE WATCHING THIS AND THEY DO

247
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:51,061
WORRY ABOUT THE MEN IN THEIR

248
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:51,362
LIFE.

249
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:53,431
THEY DO WORRY ABOUT THE IMPACT

250
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:55,199
GOING FORWARD OF WHAT THIS

251
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,499
MEANS.

252
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,302
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

253
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,337
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO

254
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,440
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

255
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:03,841
BLAMING AN ENTIRE GENDER FOR

256
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:06,177
WHAT INDIVIDUAL MEN HAVE DONE

257
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:09,847
AND THAT WE'RE NOT JUDGING

258
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:11,449
PEOPLE AND THE DEFERENCE THEY

259
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,317
SHOULD BE GIVEN OR BEING

260
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:15,953
TREATED LIKE AN EGG OR BEING

261
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:18,322
TREATED LIKE CRAP BASED ON

262
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,191
THEIR POLITICS AND WHERE THEY

263
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:20,491
WORK.

264
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,427
MAY I SAY ONE THING LEADER

265
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:24,195
MCCONNELL SAID IT PERFECTLY.

266
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,830
THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT MANY

267
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,465
RANK AND FILE VOTERS ARE

268
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:27,932
FEELING.

269
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,567
WE HEAR FROM THEM CONSTANTLY.

270
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:31,669
NOTHING WILL EVER BE GOOD

271
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,072
ENOUGH NOT JUST FOR THE

272
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:37,275
DEMOCRATS ON THE JUDICIARY

273
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:38,910
COMMITTEE BUT ALL THOSE NOT

274
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,077
VOTING FOR KAVANAUGH.

275
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:42,413
IF YOU'RE A RED STATE DEMOCRAT

276
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:44,048
YOU'RE CHOOSING BETWEEN BEING

277
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:47,785
COMPLICIT IN A PROCESS THAT'S

278
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:48,486
BEEN ABOUT DELAY AND

279
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:49,620
DESTRUCTION AND THE WILL OF

280
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,022
YOUR PEOPLE IN THE STATE.

281
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:53,624
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE THREE

282
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,194
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO VOTED

283
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:59,964
FOR GORSUCH MANCHIN, HEITKAMP

284
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,499
AND DONLEY.

285
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,100
WHAT HAS CHANGED?

286
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,368
YOUR VOTERS WANT A SUPREME

287
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,269
COURT NOMINEE TO BE CONFIRMED.

288
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,437
THEY DON'T WANT THIS

289
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:07,605
OBSTRUCTION OR LIKE THE

290
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:08,306
SOCIALIST WAY THE DEMOCRATIC

291
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:09,240
PARTY IS GOING.

292
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:12,276
>> Sandra: A CRITICAL POINT AND

293
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:13,778
MOMENT.

294
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,413
FRONT PAGE "NEW YORK TIMES" BIG

295
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:15,980
STORY FOR THEM.

296
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:17,782
YOUR REACTION FROM THE WHITE

297
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:20,118
HOUSE ON THEIR REPORTING TRUMP

298
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,319
ENGAGED IN SUSPECT TAX SCHEMES

299
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,923
AS HE REAPED RICHES FROM HIS

300
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:25,323
FATHER.

301
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:26,257
THIS REPORT, KELLYANNE, MAKES

302
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:29,394
THE CASE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

303
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,562
NOT A SELF-MADE MAN, THAT HE

304
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:32,931
HAS BEEN GIVEN MONEY FROM HIS

305
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:34,566
FAMILY SINCE HE WAS A CHILD,

306
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:38,937
AND THEY DID IT BY MEANS OF

307
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:39,637
COMPLICATED TAX SCHEMES AND

308
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,540
BEYOND.

309
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,642
>> AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID,

310
00:08:43,643 --> 00:08:46,211
IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE HAS EVER

311
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:48,814
WITNESSED A MAJOR OUTLET TAKING

312
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:51,016
THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND

313
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:52,184
PUSHING IT FORWARD.

314
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:54,019
HIS ATTORNEY, CHARLES HARDER,

315
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,088
MADE CLEAR YESTERDAY THIS IS

316
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:56,855
100% INACCURATE AND THE PEOPLE

317
00:08:56,856 --> 00:09:01,293
HIRED TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES

318
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:02,694
DECADES AGO WERE ALL

319
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:03,528
PROFESSIONALLY LICENSED AND

320
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,131
SWORE THEMSELVES THAT WHAT THEY

321
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:09,401
WERE ATTESTING TO WAS FACT AND

322
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:09,701
LEGAL.

323
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:12,471
SO THESE ARE CPAs, ATTORNEYS,

324
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:14,406
REAL ESTATE EXPERTS.

325
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:15,807
AND THAT HE DENIES THIS

326
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:16,975
COMPLETELY THROUGH HIS ATTORNEY

327
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:20,012
AND ALSO I THINK WHAT OUR PRESS

328
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:21,847
SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS SAID

329
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:23,248
YESTERDAY IS INSTRUCTIVE.

330
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:24,916
DOES THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER

331
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,685
SEE ANYTHING POSITIVE IN A

332
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:27,152
BOOMING ECONOMY?

333
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:30,556
JUST TODAY WE HAVE THE

334
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:31,823
PROJECTION OF 185,000 NEW JOBS

335
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,825
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT IT

336
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:34,526
WAS 230,000.

337
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:35,460
WHERE IS THAT?

338
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,730
WHERE IS THE HIGHEST STOCK

339
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:39,064
MARKET?

340
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:40,465
THE LOWEST EMPLOYMENT RATES.

341
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:41,800
THEY'VE NEVER MET A PIECE OF

342
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:43,201
GOOD NEWS UNDER THE TRUMP

343
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:43,902
ADMINISTRATION AND SAID THE

344
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:45,070
PRESIDENT IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

345
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:47,172
THIS HAS BEEN DENIED BY HIS

346
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:48,574
ATTORNEY, BY HIS PRESS

347
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,943
SECRETARY AND BY HIM AND I

348
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:54,112
THINK THE PLAY HERE IS TWO

349
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:56,014
THINGS, NUMBER ONE, I GUESS

350
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,883
THEY MOVED OFF RUSSIA COLLUSION.

351
00:09:57,884 --> 00:09:59,151
IT OBSESSED THEM FOR TWO YEARS

352
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:02,087
AND HAVEN'T HEARD IT IN A WHILE.

353
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,956
AND NUMBER TWO THEY'RE TRYING

354
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:06,825
TO GOAD THE PRESIDENT INTO

355
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:10,529
SUING THEM TO GET HIGH TAX

356
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:10,863
RETURNS.

357
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:13,332
HAVEN'T THEY LEARNED THAT THE

358
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,867
PRESIDENT ALWAYS GETS THE LAST

359
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:15,200
LAUGH?

360
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:17,536
>> DO YOU HAVE A PREDICTION ON

361
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:18,470
THE KAVANAUGH VOTE.

362
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:19,972
DOES HE GET CONFIRMED AND

363
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:22,241
WHAT'S THE FINAL TALLY?

364
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:24,776
>> THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING

365
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,712
BEHIND HIS NOMINEE AND

366
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:27,613
RECOGNIZE THE RED STATE

367
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:30,916
DEMOCRATS ARE IN A DIFFICULT

368
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:31,650
POSITION.

369
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,052
COMPLICITY IN A DESTRUCTIVE

370
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,219
PROCESS THAT HURT FORD AND

371
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,355
KAVANAUGH AND DOING THE WILL OF

372
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,022
THEIR VOTERS.

373
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:39,291
>> Bill: THE SUPREME COURT

374
00:10:39,292 --> 00:00:00,000
JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT.
