nobody wants to give you an extra five or ten thousand dollars the biggest thing you can do when it comes to negotiation is understand that eighty percent of the work is done before you ever set foot in the room so if you just walk in and say give me money just get the hell out of there they don't want you there but if you say I really want to be a top performer can you help me understand what it takes to be the best and then you jointly come with three key initiatives you get it in writing you get really specific about the numbers and then of course you outperform and you deliver by the time you walk in six months later for your review there's no surprise you've already agreed this is what makes you a top performer you've pulled out your salary calm your glass door comps so you know what the market tells you and right there it's not about arguing with you or me it's about looking at the data and that's how a lot of my students on I will teach you to be rich they end up negotiating twenty-five thirty forty thousand dollar races like that
