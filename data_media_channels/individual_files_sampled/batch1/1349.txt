the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is still watching over his people and you never have to look very far to catch a glimpse of the man at the center of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 still in exile in Paris Khomeini famously ordered every Iranian onto the streets to help overthrow the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi one of the women who answered the call was Sabah Bob ie born in Japan is Kaneko Yamamura she changed her name when she married an Iranian businessman she met in Tokyo they moved to Iran after their first son was born it was the 1960s and Iran was a very different place but ended up it was before the Revolution Society was different than in Iran it wasn't like today no one cared about Islamic baba he said the Shahs government tried to ban women from wearing headscarves and attempt to replace Ron Ian's culture with Western values all part of a plan by foreign governments she says to control Iran and Iran's natural resources so Khomeini's message of independence she says resonated with many people well he said there shouldn't be any poverty in Iran he meant we should take care of poor people there should be justice everyone should be equal well many of the Iranians welcomed this bubbly survived the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War two and lived through the iran-iraq war that started almost immediately after the Revolution when Iraqi forces led by Saddam Hussein invaded Iran Baba's son salman farsi volunteered to fight and was killed he was 19 years old decades later she still struggles to talk about it but says even knowing the pain of losing him she would sacrifice him again to preserve the Islamic Revolution for many Iranians the teachings of the country's first supreme leader are as relevant today as they were in 1979 but for some the Islamic Revolution has not fulfilled all of its promises while they do not necessarily want to tear down their country's government most Iranians we spoke to said they just want their leaders to do a little more to solve their problems as a frontier ma our people are important figures in history many of them died for the revolution but our demand is the current government should care about the nation all different classes of people from the rich to those who don't have a good economic situation behind she's a kid to a Jarman the best thing that could happen in a society is the equality between a man and a woman the more we work for this the better a society will have when making policy Iran's government often looks to the Past for much of its inspiration Iranian people it seems want them to look more to the future Zayn Basra via al Jazeera Tehran
