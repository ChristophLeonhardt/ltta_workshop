OWENS.

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,926
CANDACE WAS WITH KANYE IN D.C.

10
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:19,296
EARLIER TODAY.

11
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:20,964
YOU ACTUALLY FACILITATED A PHONE

ALL HE WANTS IS ANSWERS.

00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:34,311
ALL HE WANTS IS SHUGSS.

17
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,580
ALL HE WANTS IS OPPORTUNITIES,

SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS.

23
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,689
WHAT IS THERE TO DISAGREE WITH?

24
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,423
>> THE FACT THAT HE LIKES OUR

25
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:48,925

26
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:51,061
THE FACT HAH THAT HE'S BRINGING

00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:52,429
FORTH AN OPTIMISTIC MESSAGE.

28
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,496
THE LEFT HAS BECOME THE PARTY OF

29
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:55,165
HATE AND DIVISION.

30
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,000
KANYE IS TALKING ABOUT LOVE AND

31
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,668
UNITY AND SUPPORT FOR OUR

32
00:00:58,669 --> 00:00:59,302
PRESIDENT WHO IS DOING A

00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:01,271
TREMENDOUS JOB.

00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:07,711
JOBS AND STARTING BLACK

38
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:08,411
BUSINESSES.

00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,013
400% INCREASE.

40
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:10,747
BLACK UNAPPOINTMENT AT AN

41
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:11,948
ALL-TIME LOW.

42
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:15,018
PRESIDENT OBAMA BROUGHT AN

43
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,820
ALL-TIME HIGH FOR WELFARE.

44
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:18,421
WE HAD PRESIDENT PALESTINIAN

45
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:20,090
CLINTON BEFORE HIM BROUGHT AN

46
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:20,724

INCARCERATION.

48
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:23,360
WHY ISN'T THE BLACK COMMUNITY

49
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,494
STANDING WITH OUR PRESIDENT

50
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:24,861
RIGHT NOW?

51
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:27,464
>> Sean: DID HE SAY HE WAS A

52
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:27,864
BILLIONAIRE?

00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:28,665
>> YES, TLLY FOX NEWS REPORTED

54
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:34,371
THAT.

55
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:36,439
>> Sean: HOW AWESOME, TALKING

56
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,941
ABOUT JOBS THAT PAY 50, 60,

57
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:39,909
70,000 A YEAR.

58
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,644
PEOPLE WOULD LOVE THOSE JOBS.

59
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:42,078
GET THEM HERE.

60
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,880
JOHN JAMES, I HAD THE

61
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:44,648
OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW ON MY

62
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:46,449
RADIO SHOW.

63
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,320
I HONESTLY, CAN SAY THIS, ON

64
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:51,054
RADIO 30 YEARS, HE TOOK MY

65
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:51,855
BREATH AWAY.

66
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:53,356
BECAUSE OF YOUR PASSION.

67
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:55,325
I HOPE THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN

68
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:56,326
ARE GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

69
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:57,661
I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH STATE TO RUN

70
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:58,828
FOR SENATE.

71
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,064
I HOPE THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN

72
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:03,299
ARING WHAT I THINK IS A GREAT

73
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,034
MESSAGE TO MAKE MICHIGAN GREAT

74
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:04,934
AGAIN.

75
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,002
>> PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

76
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:07,871
MICHIGAN ARE ASTUTE.

77
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:10,340
THIS IS A STATE THAT DONALD

78
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:11,041
TRUMP WON BUT SO DID BERNIE

79
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,442
SANDERS.

80
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:13,276
THEY'RE SICK AND TIRED OF BEING

81
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:14,277
SICK AND TIRED.

82
00:02:14,278 --> 00:02:16,279
WHEN YOU LOOK AT 98% OF BLACK

83
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,781
PEOPLE VOTE IN ONE PARTY THAT'S

84
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:18,715
THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE A SEAT

85
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:20,216
AT BOTH TABLES.

86
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:23,119
I'M AN INDEPENDENT THINKER WHO

87
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,853
PRIORITIZES GOD AND COUNTRY IN

88
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:24,954
THAT ORDER.

89
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:26,389
I WILL ALWAYS SERVE THE STATE OF

90
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,124
MIF AS WELL AS I SERVE THE

91
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,860
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHEN I

92
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:31,561
DEPLOYED TO OPERATION IRAQIE

93
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,129
FREEDOM.

94
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,230
>> Sean: I WENT THROUGH DETROIT

95
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,399
AND I SAW ONE OF AMERICA'S GREAT

96
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,733
CITIES.

97
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:37,867
IT WAS DEVASTATING.

98
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:40,870
IT WAS, I MEAN, SELLING HOMES

99
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,405
FOR A DOLLAR, KNOCKING DOWN

100
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:44,140
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS TO

101
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:45,442
CONSOLIDATE BECAUSE OF THE

102
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:46,142
MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT MOVED

103
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:47,010
OUT.

104
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,080
NOW JOBS ARE MOVING IN TO AREAS

105
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:54,150
LIKE MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, AND

106
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:54,718
OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA.

107
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,519
I THINK WE CAN REVITALIZE A CITY

108
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,688
LIKE DETROIT.

109
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,590
AM I DREAMING HERE OR ROOTED IN

110
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:00,924
REALITY?

111
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:02,092
>> NO, LOOK, YOU'RE EXACTLY ON

112
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,160
TRACK.

113
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:06,329
WE KNOW THAT WE CAN REVITALIZE

114
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:06,696
DETROIT.

115
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:10,667
THE THING IS, UNTIL THESE

116
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:11,634
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IMPROOVMS

117
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:12,435
IMPROVEMENTS COME TO THE PEOPLE

118
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:14,504
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, FORGOTTEN

119
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:16,005
NEIGHBORHOODS AND FARMS, THE

120
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,140
AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED

121
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,476
AND FAILED BY DEMOCRAT POLICIES,

122
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,044
DECADES IN THE PAST, WE HAVE

123
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:22,846
MARCHED FROM SELMA TO DETROIT.

124
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:23,947
WE HAVE RIOTED FROM BALTIMORE TO

125
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:24,948
WATTS.

126
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,583
NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN 50 YEARS.

127
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:30,053
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

128
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:30,987
DON'T JUST --

129
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:31,688
>> Sean: FIRST NEIGHBORHOODS

130
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,056
SHOULD BE SAFE.

131
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:35,825
CHICAGO ISN'T SAFE.

132
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:37,660
I'D LOVE THE PART PRESIDENT TO

133
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:39,662
PARTNER WITH KANYE AND COME UP

134
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:40,396
WITH ANSWERS FOR THE PEOPLE OF

135
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:41,464
CHICAGO.

136
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:43,299
IT IS A SHOOTING ZONE.

137
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,501
IT'S HAPPENING FOR YEARS.

138
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:46,603
NOBODY IS FIXING IT.

139
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:48,505
>> WE NEED MORE SOLUTION, WE

140
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,340
NEED LEADERSHIP AND LESS

141
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:52,041
PARTISANSHIP.

142
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:55,879
YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT MY CANDIDACY

143
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,415

TO MAKE THINGS BETTER, BRINGING

146
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:04,254
EVERYBODY UP.

147
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:06,422
>> Sean: CANDACE, WHY ARE

148
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:09,225
PEOPLE, THAT ARE

149
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:09,826
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND

150
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:13,563
CONSERVATIVE BRUTALIZED BY THE

151
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:13,863
LEFT?

152
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:14,597
>> BECAUSE TLE DON'T WANT US TO

153
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:15,732
BE FREE.

154
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,168
MAKE NO MISTAKE THE LEFT DEPENDS

155
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:19,101
ON THE BLACK VOTE.

156
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,904
THEY HAVE TO EARN MORE THAN 85%

157
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:21,670
OF THE BLACK VOTE TO SUSTAIN

158
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:23,373
THEIR PARTY.

159
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:25,175
WHY THEY SEW DIVISION, WHY THEY

160
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,009
NEED THE THEMES OF RACISM TO

161
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,510
STAY ALIVE.

162
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,645
GUESS WHAT, THE BLACK COMMUNITY

163
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:30,747
IS WAKING UP.

164
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:31,514
THAT'S WHY KANYE WEST TERRIFIES

165
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:32,816
THEM.

166
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:33,583
HE'S NOT SCARED IN THE SAME WAY

167
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:35,118
I'M NOT SCARED.

168
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,286
WE SEE MORE BLACK CONSERVATIVES

169
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:37,654
WAKING UP AND SPEAKING OUT

170
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:39,756
AGAINST DEMOCRAT PARTY.

171
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:40,423
>> Sean: I HAVE A HANNITY

172
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:41,891
CRYSTAL BALL.

173
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,127
WHAT I SEE IN MY FUTURE ARE

174
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:46,329
AMAZING FUTURES FOR BOTH OF YOU,
