00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,469
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so there was a really strong</font>

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,330
response to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs internship advice</font>

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,130
video thing that people really<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to</font>

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,990
identify with<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the fear of phone</font>

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,059
calls so here are ten tips for phone

6
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,830
calls number one let's start with making

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,049
a call assemble all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the details the</font>

8
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,910
phone number the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the person you</font>

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to talk to you just in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case you</font>

10
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,150
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your own phone number at</font>

11
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,590
some point during this cool and you're

12
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,119
someone who forgets their own phone

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,769
number under pressure like me I once

14
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,510
gave an electrician my mother's phone

15
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,039
number by accident then write that down

16
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to if you are calling the electricity</font>

17
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,640
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> or calling to inquire about an</font>

18
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,439
order of slippers or something make sure

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,630
you have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reference order numbers</font>

20
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,070
confirmation numbers all that sort of

21
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,110
stuff handy as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> number two sometimes</font>

22
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,730
it might even help to write out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

23
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,020
script<font color="#E5E5E5"> for yourself this can be</font>

24
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,219
especially helpful if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

25
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone for the first time or if you</font>

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,070
know you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be put through to</font>

27
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,719
an operator don't script out the entire

28
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,370
conversation because obviously you can

29
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,260
only ever know half of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

30
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">hello who you are who you're calling for</font>

31
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,149
and a one-sentence really simple

32
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,039
explanation of why you're calling for

33
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,899
example hi my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen halse rojas</font>

34
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,329
and i'm calling to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak to herbert to</font>

35
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,980
inquire about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cactus that i ordered</font>

36
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,349
last week number<font color="#CCCCCC"> three ok it's time to</font>

37
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">dial can you go somewhere quiet if not</font>

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">doke stressed out about it that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok too</font>

39
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,049
if pacing while you're on the phone

40
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,970
helps you breathe then also try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find</font>

41
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,830
somewhere you can you know peace<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

42
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,299
it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth checking that your phone</font>

43
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">has a decent amount of battery and also</font>

44
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,810
decent<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of signal once you sort</font>

45
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,369
these things out it makes it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

46
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,560
focus on the call number for something

47
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,350
that is quite hard for me speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> slowly</font>

48
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and enunciate where possible when you're</font>

49
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,490
nervous you probably talk quickly a

50
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,930
weird volume because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vomit</font>

51
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,040
out the words and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want have to</font>

52
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,090
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them anymore and you want them</font>

53
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be down the other end of the phone</font>

54
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they want the phone calls but over</font>

55
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,020
newest one ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done but actually</font>

56
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,729
it turns out that speaking slowly helps

57
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,380
you out you spend far less time

58
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,570
clarifying you increase the chances of

59
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,040
the person on the other end of the line

60
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,119
really listening to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying</font>

61
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">and even maybe remembering your name 5</font>

62
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,189
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time comes to end the call let</font>

63
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,990
them know what you expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> from them and</font>

64
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,820
what they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect from you sometimes</font>

65
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,079
this might not be applicable and

66
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,250
sometimes you might have mentioned it in

67
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,659
bulk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conversation can be worth</font>

68
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,460
repeating at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks harbour I'll</font>

69
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,840
wait for your own voice of Wednesday and

70
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll send you the final payment</font>

71
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">also this is going to sound really</font>

72
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,490
cheesy finishing on a note of thank you

73
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">for your help or have a nice day it's</font>

74
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,149
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice way to make everyone</font>

75
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel good about the cool but you know by</font>

76
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,440
works too like never under

77
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,690
timate by number six right afterwards

78
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,220
write down any notes you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

79
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,570
core what you promised to do what you're

80
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,190
expecting from them any<font color="#E5E5E5"> dates that you</font>

81
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,360
didn't drop down while you were on the

82
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">call especially if it's work call what</font>

83
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,690
was agreed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what needs clarification</font>

84
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,580
what you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow up on does that</font>

85
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be a follow-up email about it</font>

86
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,490
this is a great time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about what</font>

87
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could have done better and what you</font>

88
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,790
will do in future to help yourself feel

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,510
more prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 but wait this all</font>

the context and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> little scripts</font>

93
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,790
might be helpful think about what you

94
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,290
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> from them and communicate that on</font>

95
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> little answer phone message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

96

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,960
clearly and mention your number as well

<font color="#E5E5E5">the most important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with answer</font>

else is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

101
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,080
whether that matters are you calling

102
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the shop you work in to say that</font>

103
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,530
something a customer has ordered is in

104
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,880
stock do you know that it's for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

105
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,320
customer or do you know whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

106
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,300
surprise to someone else who may be an

earshot confidential client information

108
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,600
is the sort stuff that shouldn't be left

109
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,190
or voicemails sometimes it can even be

110
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,660
worth following up a voicemail with an

111
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,070
email in the event that the voicemail

112
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,440
