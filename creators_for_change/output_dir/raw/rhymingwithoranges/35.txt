probably not the time to say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> told you</font>

so but I did kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of predict the Trump</font>

quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nails on my head I</font>

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,859
don't want to go into the reasons why

<font color="#CCCCCC">healy we lost the electoral college and</font>

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,359
therefore the presidency because I think

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">that enough people are talking about</font>

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,090
that and speculating about it at the end

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the day their speculations I think</font>

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the most important thing that we</font>

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,600
can do now is do what we Brits had to do

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,040
after brexit and accept the result but

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,340
continue with our values<font color="#CCCCCC"> and resolve and</font>

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,980
be ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the checks and balances</font>

something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were a part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of and a</font>

that people were part

well part of unions um it was hard

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,480
honest work is what is often is the

phrase that's often used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe</font>

got moved aboard and although in the

105
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,120
is really important is that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>
