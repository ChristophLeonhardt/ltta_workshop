1
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,007
Yeah I miss cheeseburgers
not gonna lie.

2
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,443
I feel like this question was
tuned to me.

3
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,421
Probably the internet.

4
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,698
There's definitely been times 
when I felt like 

5
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,201
maybe I should be at home or 
maybe, this isn't the place

6
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,969
that I should be right now.

7
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,305
I know when I email my fiancÃ©,
we often only have a chance 

8
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,074
to email each other once.

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,109
So it can be really hard and
lonely sometimes to feel like

10
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,512
you're never really talking to
anybody you're kind of just 

11
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,048
two ships passing in the night,
sending letters back and forth.

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,250
But, you're never actually
having a conversation.

13
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,694
So in my regular life I 
live in New York.

14
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,963
I have a husband. I commute 
on the subway. 

15
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,899
I work in a cubicle. Pretty 
much every moment of my life, 

16
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,436
I'm surrounded by lots and 
lots of people, lots of noise.

17
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,307
So, yeah I do find it easier
to contemplate here.

18
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,252
We don't let them move on 
very long. If somebody has 

19
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,488
a problem with somebody else, 
we usually try to talk about it 

20
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,957
within an hour or two of 
whatever event set it off.

21
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,525
We're just very open 
with each other.

22
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,972
If you're talking about romance, 
I would say that I'm probably

23
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,609
closest with my EVA 
[extravehicular activity]suit.

24
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,779
We get very close, we get sweaty
at least twice a week.

25
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,449
When we're out on EVA 
it takes my breath away.

26
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,752
That's why we have the big 
fans on the suits.

27
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,454
And that's pretty much it.

28
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,524
You got to remember that we
have six people living

29
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,994
in a confined environment,
a lot of work to get done.

30
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,796
And we're all professionals
from the field so, when you're

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,599
in a situation like this and 
you're trying to get a lot done,

32
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,468
professionalism is really
important.

33
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:53,773
And it's very important for 
keeping good crew relations.

<i><u><font color=#00000000></font></u></i>

34
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,942
Otherwise you'll have 
mission failure.

35
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,877
And that's something that 
none of us want.

36
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:13,426
I mean, yeah absolutely.
I would probably rather that

37
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:18,131
happen than my mother or 
my grandma be in the backseat.

38
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,034
I mean, could you imagine 
just the nagging?

39
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,403
Oh man, I love you guys sorry.

40
00:03:23,403 --> 00:00:00,000
Probably not going to any 
Hanukkah present this year.
