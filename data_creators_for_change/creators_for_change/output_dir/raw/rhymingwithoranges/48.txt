the world um I know you're not overly

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,019
interested in general in what happens

outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your lovely lovely country ah</font>

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,790
but I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sit</font>

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">down and have a talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this man cuz</font>

we're a little worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but quite</font>

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">seriously we're all slightly concerned</font>

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,359
about the whole Trump phenomenon I hope

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,460
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mind suppressing our concerns</font>

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">this isn't actually the first time that</font>

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,960
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little island the UK have</font>

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,420
expressed their thoughts on the Trump

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,600
phenomenon a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months back the UK</font>

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,010
Parliament decided to have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,660
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> debate but whether or not we were</font>

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,700
going to ban Donald Trump from coming

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,340
into the UK and we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to in the</font>

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,780
end we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very generous with our</font>

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,030
conclusion but we ended up saying and

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,059
describing him as stuff like this he is

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,449
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wuss look full bonkers daft and</font>

defensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> dawdled Trump is a buffoon</font>

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,600
stupidity can I tell you a little secret

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,069
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those words actually mean</font>

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,049
anything it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> when a British person</font>

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,490
thinks that an<font color="#CCCCCC"> American is going to be</font>

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,869
listening to them we use deliberately

29
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,939
ridiculous vocabulary so that it makes

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we all talk like we're in</font>

31
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,880
Downton Abbey and makes you more likely

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,159
to buy one direction and little mix cds

extreme language on immigration his

quite public fights with the Fox News

anchor megyn kelly who is so beautiful

policy of him wanting to ban all Muslim

us aren't the only ones concerned by

this the Republican Party who Donald

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,400
Trump is supposedly representing has

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
also started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to panic do you remember</font>

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,019
Mitt Romney as well as being the subject

62
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,879
of this hilarious gift where he has a

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,370
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> face on a big head of it so funny</font>

64
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,709
he was the Republican candidate for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,959
presidency in 2012 eventually losing to

66

Obama a few months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he very publicly</font>

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
laid into Donald Trump lending a voice

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,940
to the Republican Party that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

69
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,989
starting to get their knickers in a

70
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:41,459
twist about the whole thing saying that

71
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,379
he probably isn't as rich and<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful</font>

72
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,750
business wise as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably thought</font>

73
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,599
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that his policies were divisive</font>

74
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,510
and and demeaning to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

75
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,920
not the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Republican Party</font>

want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh MIT I loved</font>

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,870
you in your Netflix documentary you were

78
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,599
really humanized and and please<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

79
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,760
get me to marry one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your hot Mormon</font>

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,690
sons what Mormons are hot I feel like

81
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,970
that's a thing right Donald<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump has</font>

82
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,950
many things<font color="#E5E5E5"> money being the main one</font>

83
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,750
right but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he apparently</font>

84
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,870
lacks is a thick skin and soon after

85
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,389
Romney did that like takedown of Trump

86
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:19,829
and all of his terrible business

87
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:22,380
practices Donald Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to use a</font>

88
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,260
press conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> to promote all of his</font>

89
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,540
products that have his name on it which

90
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,940
included wine steak champagne water and

91
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,530
like it's a bit dodgy to have a

92
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,569
presidential candidate touting their

93
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,519
like business things like you probably

94
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't be doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

95
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,380
made me think who is buying what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

96
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,889
like weird person is buying Trump

97
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,700
champagne like that's why would you want

98
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,450
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get mmm Trump hasn't been</font>

99
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,069
rejected by absently everybody in the

100
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,690
Republican Party though soon after

101
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,579
dropping out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the race the Republican</font>

102

governor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> New Jersey chris Christie</font>

103
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,049
came out and supported him despite<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

104
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,489
fact that they were like hating on each

other quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> into Bates I mean</font>

116
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,280

117
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of his ideals under the bus in order to</font>

118
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,120
further his political career under<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

119
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,509
hypothetical president Trump and I don't

120
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:45,729
know whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel terrible for him I</font>

121
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:48,520
don't know ever to feel elated that this

122
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,530
wasn't kind of rewarded in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that</font>

123
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,330
he thought it would be rewarded but

124
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,139
there's this this vine of Trump kind of

125
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:01,479
bullying Chris I don't agree with chris

126
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:02,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christie on a lot of things I have very</font>

127
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">little sympathy for him but I'd after</font>

128
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,820
that I I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hug</font>

129
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,440
there's the planes over there bugger<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

130
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,699
Oh Chris what kind of has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been worrying</font>

131
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:18,180
about Trump as well is the amount of

132
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,039
shall we say excitement that his

133
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,349
supporters channel in less than friendly

134
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:28,570
ways I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most diplomatic</font>

135
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,340
way I can put it there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a</font>

136
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,530
phenomenon of people protesting at

137
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,720
Donald Trump rallies and then being kind

138
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,810
of like beaten and thrown out and it's

139
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,000
quite terrifying so here's kind of like

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,650
a rundown<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some of the people who were</font>

141
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">thrown out there's this guy who looked</font>

142
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,340
particularly fabulous and kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> on like</font>

143
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,320
flicking his hair I love him<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want him</font>

144
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,210
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my friend there was this lady if</font>

145
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you remember her from a few months ago</font>

146
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,159
who started reading like a book about

147
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,460
like black poetry in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the background of a</font>

148
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,260
Donald Trump rally that was amazing and

149
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sweetest one the lady</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

150
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,260
the muslim lady in the hijab who had

151
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,680
like who wore a shirt that said I I come

152
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,560
in peace and then was escorted out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

153
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,250
I'm just like well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lovely</font>

154
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,010
atmosphere that Trump is cultivating

155
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,180
isn't it there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

156
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,620
speculation<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

157
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,599
voting Trump not<font color="#E5E5E5"> least because the media</font>

158
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">would like Oh nobody will actually vote</font>

159
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,620
for him he's just popular in the polls

160
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,419
because you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to go to</font>

161
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,870
a polling booth and vote um but he's

162
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,529
winning like everything so eggs on your

163
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">face media and this is where I want to</font>

164
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,280
get real for a little bit because this

165
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,460
to be a certain kind of patronizing tone

166
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,139
when people talk about Donald Trump

167
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,620
supporters in saying that they are

168
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">stupid the Donald Trump phenomenon of</font>

169
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,770
like populists anti-immigration rhetoric

170
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,320
maybe something like reasonably new in

171
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,790
u.s. politics but we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

172
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my continent of Europe</font>

173
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,470
quite a lot in Britain<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a party</font>

174
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,600
called the UK Independence Party who are

175
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,120
quite anti-immigration and to Europe um

176
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,910
and very populists and loud and shouty

177
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,100
sometimes and sometimes quite scary

178
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,510
please don't hurt me you keep supporters

179
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,070
in the UK have quite often been

180
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,540
described by mainstream politicians and

181
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,930
media as stupid not really understanding

182
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,960
how the world works<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and you know what</font>

183

188
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,419
election and they were forced to be

189
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,660
reckoned with and now we're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

190
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,440
referendum on whether we're going to be

191
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,720
in the EU because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the populism of you</font>

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,169
kit the worst thing you can do is call

193
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,090
those people stupid and call those

194
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,570
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> uninformed babe perhaps not read</font>

195
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,610
The Guardian or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the</font>

196
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. equivalent is they probably haven't</font>

197
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,930
watched MSNBC but they aren't stupid

198
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,460
what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to say is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

199
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,930
contentious but I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

200
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,850
mainstream politics and even fringe

201
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,160
politics as has left the white

202
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,830
working-class behind I mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all any</font>

203
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,560
any opinions that you have just aren't

204
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
aren't valid because you know you have

205
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,570
this privilege and you have these

206
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,090
opportunities and traditionally you have

207
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,640
had it pretty good especially in America

208
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,490
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know seg</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vacation was</font>

209
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,979
a thing and and white<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are used to</font>

210
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:27,400
being not bottom of not bottom of the

211
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,710
heap which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible way to think</font>

212
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,510
about it but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably exactly</font>

213
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,190
what he's going through their<font color="#E5E5E5"> minds</font>

214
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,530
there was a fantastic article from Emma

<font color="#CCCCCC">Lindsey or medium that I shared on my</font>

216

217
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">think she really accurately explains why</font>

218
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,839
the white working-class vote is so

219
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,280
disenfranchised disenfranchised and why

220
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,990
Donald Trump is doing so incredibly well

221
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,670
let me read you a quote we must<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

222
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,080
ways for the working class too

223

maintain<font color="#CCCCCC"> its dignity we must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find a way</font>

for them to have jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

225
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,480
satisfying to them we must find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font>

226
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,700
for them to contribute to<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture we</font>

which by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way other exact same goals</font>

229
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,850
we need to have for the press traces we

230
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,740
all need the same thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> until we</font>

231
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,780
find a way to give it to more people we

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight each other for it so these</font>

235
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when we look at Donald</font>

236
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,850
Trump voters and we're like oh my god

237
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,850
how could anybody do that it helps

238
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,130
nobody because it dehumanizes these

239
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,410
people that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very real feelings of</font>

family where is my American dream why

242
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,640
are there no more manufacturing jobs and

243
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,090
unless you try to understand and tackle

244
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,960
the issues that are important to them

245
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,670
not by pandering to like immigration

246
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,520
rhetoric and fear and all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

247
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,320
that Donald Trump is managing to pick up

248
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">votes through the longer you ignore them</font>

249
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,750
the more likes more than somebody like

250
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,160
don'd Trump is going to do well so

251
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,670
basically USA as a representative<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with me on this what do you think of</font>

257
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
this whole phenomenon do you think that

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,630
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps being too kind to the Donald</font>
