THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT, IT'S A MORAL MOMENT IN OUR COUNTRY. ULTIMATELY, NOT WHETHER HE IS INNOCENT OR GUILTY, THIS IS NOT A TRIAL, BUT ULTIMATELY HAS ENOUGH QUESTIONS BEING RAISED THAT WE SHOULD NOT MOVE ONTO ANOTHER CANDIDATE. Tucker: THAT WAS SENATOR SPARTACUS IN NEW JERSEY SAYING AS YOU JUST HEARD, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF BRETT KAVANAUGH IS INNOCENT OR GUILTY. DEMOCRATS SPENT SO LONG ATTACKING HIM WITHOUT TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THAT REALLY IS HIS OBLIGATION TO JUST SUBMIT AND LET HIS CAREER AND REPUTATION AND FAMILY BE DESTROYED FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. ALAN DERSHOWITZ IS A RETIRED LAW PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR OF THE BEST-SELLING "THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP." DO YOU THINK, PROFESSOR, THAT THAT'S A FINE STANDARD, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF HE'S INNOCENT OR GUILTY, HE SHOULD JUST SUBMIT. IT SOUNDS VERY FAMILIAR. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT PEOPLE THAT WERE ACCUSED OF BEING COMMUNIST. AND IF YOU ANGRILY RESPONDED AND SAID, YOU ARE NOT, THEN IT'S JUST A JOB INTERVIEW AND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IF YOU ARE INNOCENT OR GUILTY? THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE INQUISITION WHERE THEY WOULD CALL YOU IN FIRST AND MAKE YOU TESTIFY, AND THEN THEY WOULD PRESENT THE EVIDENCE. ONCE YOU ARE ACCUSED OF THE MOST HEINOUS CRIME IMAGINABLE, IT TURNS INTO A TRIAL WHERE YOU HAVE DUE PROCESS. WHERE THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. WHERE THE EVIDENCE HAS TO BE CLEAR AND CONVINCING. IN AMERICA, WE DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO DESTROY OTHER PEOPLES REPUTATIONS AND CAREERS BASED UPON INFERENCE OF GUILT, THE WAY THE ACLU NOW SAYS. THE ACLU SAYS WE SHOULD PRESUME GUILT AND NOT INNOCENCE. SO YOU ARE A LIBERAL AND YOU HAVE LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LIBERAL WORLD. DID ANY OF THEM EVER SAY, I DON'T AGREE WITH KAVANAUGH, I HATE TRUMP, BUT I AGREE WITH YOU. DUE PROCESS IS WORTH PRESERVING. FOR EXAMPLE TODAY 700 LAW PROFESSORS SIGNED A LETTER. AND I REFUSED TO SIGN IT. SAYING HE NOW NO LONGER HAS JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THIS WERE A LIBERAL WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY A LIBERAL PRESIDENT WHO HAD BEEN A KEY AND ACTED SIMILARLY? I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM WERE PROFESSORS. SENATOR BOOKER WHO I LIKE AND KNOW WAS JUST DEAD WRONG, IT WAS ALL ABOUT PARTISANSHIP. IF IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS WHO OPENED UP THAT CANDIDATE, EVERYONE WOULD BE BEHAVING THE OPPOSITE WAY. AND, WE DEFENDED OUT AL FRANKEN ON THE SHOW, WHOM I DON'T LIKE PERSONALLY AND I HATE HIS POLITICS BUT I THINK YOU GOT SHAFTED FOR THE SAME REASON. AND HE WAS DEFENDED, TOO. HE DESERVE TO BE DEFENDED. YOU WERE QUOTED IN A RECENT PIECE SAYING THAT JULIE SWETNICK'S LAWYER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW HIS STATEMENT. THERE ARE ETHICAL AND BAR RULES THAT SAY WHEN YOU SEND AN AFFIDAVIT EVEN TO CONGRESS AND HE LATER LEARNED THAT THERE ARE THINGS IN THE AFFIDAVIT THAT ARE FALSE, YOU HAVE A CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO WITHDRAW THE AFFIDAVIT. YOU CANNOT ALLOW AN AFFIDAVIT TO REMAIN ON THE RECORD, IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION SUGGESTING ITS CAUSE. IN ANY REASONABLE LAWYER, SAYS YOU CAN'T ANY LONGER ACCEPT WHAT'S IN THAT AFFIDAVIT. SHE HAS TO BE INVESTIGATED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE BACKGROUND CHECK, CRIMINALLY INVESTIGATED, TO SEE IF SHE DELIBERATELY AND WILLFULLY, WITH OR WITHOUT THE AID OF ANYONE ELSE MADE A DECISION JUST TO FRAME SOMEBODY FOR SOMETHING HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH. THE EVIDENCE SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT THEY NEVER KNEW EACH OTHER, THEY WERE YEARS APART AND OPERATING IN DIFFERENT CIRCLES AND IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF THE FBI INVESTIGATION AND PROVED THAT THEY NEVER MET EACH OTHER. IF THAT TURNS OUT TO BE FACT, SHE BELONGS IN THE COURT OF LAW, BEING PROSECUTED WITH THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND A DEFENDER. BUT IF THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT SHE COMMITTED PERJURY, PRISON. Tucker: WHILE. YOU KNOW WHY? IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST BEING, BUT ALSO PROTECT THEM FROM BEING WILLFULLY AND FALSELY ACCUSED OF RATE. IT'S A VERY SERIOUS CRIME, AND WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO
