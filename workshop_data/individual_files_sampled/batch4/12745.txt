on Wednesday morning President Trump tweeted out his most important offence to accusations about Donald Trump jr. attempting to collude with the Russian government hey but Hillary he tweeted why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with disgraceful this has become the all-purpose alibi for Republican malfeasance some call it what about ISM what about Hillary Clinton what about the media what about Bill Clinton or Teddy Kennedy there's a raging debate on the write about the nature of this defense is it just excuse making for bad behavior or is it a legitimate reminder that politics is a dirty game and we don't choose the rules of engagement this morning Byron York of the Washington Examiner explained another word for what about ISM is precedent this seems kind of inadequate what about ISM actually takes three basic forms some of them useful some of them counterproductive let's run through them first reminders of leftist dishonesty when Trump tweets out that Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with that behavior he's always partially reminding the media and the Democrats that they were fine with Hillary's bad behavior when conservatives spent much of yesterday reminding the media the Barack Obama pledged flexibility to the Russians in exchange for them backing off their aggression in the final days of the twenty twelve election they were doing so in order to point out the media's obvious leftist bias that's important and it's worthwhile but it should be made explicit second what about ISM can be a reminder of proportionality sometimes what about ISM takes the form of reminding people that something isn't that big a deal seemingly the entire left went ballistic this week when it first heard about a house rule that forbade bear arms in the Capitol the right promptly recommended reminded the left that this rule existed under Nancy Pelosi - it wasn't a big big deal then it's not a big deal now third moral relativism now this is the dangerous form of what about ISM it's also the most common this is the actual message underlying Trump's tweet Hillary got away with it so why shouldn't I be able to get away with it this ignores two crucial facts first Hillary did not get away with it she lost the election it's why she's not in the White House second wrong is wrong the right now engages in a fantasy whereby the left's dishonesty somehow justifies conservative dishonesty hey if Hillary's corrupt what's the big problem with the Trump campaign soliciting information from the Russian government in this case what about ISM is it self dishonesty it's pretending to care about the sins of the left in order to justify the sins of the right it actually throws into sharp relief the hypocrisy of the right we complained endlessly and justifiably about Loretta meeting secretly with Bill Clinton but we're fine with Donald's from jr. meeting secretly with mentality of vessel mates kya and we're supposed to believe everything he says about it we ripped President Obama's flexibility hot mic moment but we're fine with President Trump saying that America is killing people just like Putin we correctly targeted Clinton over China gate but now we're happy to use China gate as an excuse to avoid talking about Russia gate this isn't conservative it's not even moral kindergarten kindergartners learn that that learned that but he did it to isn't an excuse for bad behavior we should know this stuff the right often embraces this form of what about ISM because many people believe that fighting the left requires tossing out morality of means in favor of morality event fight fire with fire since that was the animating principle behind a lot of conservative support for the Trump campaign this form of what about ISM has also become the most common form many on the right say this isn't actually moral relativism relativism implies there's no moral answer to any given question where a situational morality says there is a moral answer but a change is based on a fact pattern therefore it might normally be wrong to collude with Russia for example but it's a moral imperative to do so to stop Hillary Clinton after all we have decided with Stalin to defeat Hitler we made us decide with Putin to stop Isis the problem is that this invites an obvious temptation if you can turn the other side into Hitler you can make excuses for siding with stone in the game of politics you are willing to honestly assess the moral quality of their opposition and the rules of engagement it's far more politically profitable to define all political enemies as Nazis and then suggest it's okay to punch them this is just as true for the left as it is for the right far more for the left actually it's always easier to win if you side with Stalin even if you could win without siding with Stone the temptation therefore is to demonize the other side so you can side with Stalin even if you don't need to we ought to be careful about how we use what about ISM the goal should be to reinforce moral standards not to undermine them but that goal seems to be receding into the distance as we use what about ISM as a club directed a destroying principle rather than a shield for defending it i'm ben shapiro this is the venture Pierrot okay we are going to fully analyze everything having to do with Trump jr. and his threes and then the roof Ian's we're going to get to all of that plus you see this magical cup I've been informed I must show this cup to you as often as possible this unbelievable tumbler okay it's not like that men's tumbler but it is just almost as cool it's an incredible tumbler this incredible tumbler can be yours but I'll explain later on the show why that is okay so I'm going to tell you about everything Trump jr. or later we're gonna go through the tape we're going to talk about Democrats completely losing their minds over this and they have lost their mind over everything so far we will go through all of that but before we do that I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at helix Lea so you are a unique human being you don't walk like everybody else you don't talk like everybody else why should you sleep like everybody else your mattress should be custom-made for you helix sleep comm make sure that happens you answer a few simple questions when you go to helix sleep comm they're on a 3d biomechanical model of your body through an algorithm they've designed with the help of the world's leading organ and biomechanics experts and it is the most comfortable mattress you've ever slept down we had a more expensive mattress actually and then we got our helix sleep mattress we took that other mattress and put it in the other room because our helix sleep mattress is so good and you can even get a helix sleep mattress that has two separate sides to it so if you and your spouse have different preferences in mattress then you can still share one mattress but the two sides sleep a little bit differently they send it to your house you take it out of the box it inflates right away it's a foam mattress and you can just use it it's really really cool everybody from GQ to Forbes are talking about helix sleep and they're in helix customers reported 30% improvement in overall sleep quality you also have a hundred nights to try it out so if you don't like it you can send it back and they will give you a 100% refund so it is a risk-free proposition go to helix sleep calm slash Ben and you get $50 off your order that's helix sleep calm slash then again that helix sleep calm slash Ben and that ensures they get 50 bucks off your order plus they know that we sent you ok so last night Donald Trump jr. appears on Sean Hannity's program and there are five big questions about Donald Trump jr. meeting with the Russian story so as I recall yesterday these blockbuster emails are released by Donald Trump jr. on Twitter and he wasn't doing it out of the goodness of his heart ok Trump said my son is so tricky unbelievable transparency a waverly conceived roomies like a glass of water you can see right through him unbelievable people okay but it turns out the reason that he revealed the emails is because eight minutes later the New York Times ran a story on the email so he knew the New York Times is going to reveal the story so he threw the emails out there the problem is that the email said explicitly that Rob Goldstone who is that weirdo we played on the show yesterday this publicist weirdo who talks about andy's RB or whatever whatever does he that guy brokered a meeting between Trump jr. and a Russian connected lawyer whom he said was a Russian government lawyer and he also said this is part of Russia's effort to support mr. Trump his direct quote from the email quote part of Russia and his government support from mr. Trump so the left immediately jump to this is the collusion the collusion has happened collusion has occurred from two years saw this and he said he loved it and then he brought in metaphor they brought in Kushner and this is where the collusion began the evil planning in the back rooms to decide how to militarize all of Hillary Clinton's seized emails from WikiLeaks and John Podesta seized emails from WikiLeaks okay that is not what actually the emails show what the email showed was attempted collusion okay first of all no collusion is a term of art is not a term of law collusion is not a crime there is no crime called collusion there's a crime called conspiracy to commit a crime but there is no crime called collusion okay not when it comes to this kind of stuff so when people say collusion and you go he'll end up behind bars no no you have to have to commit a crime under statute in order for you to end up behind bars so it can still be bad it can still be wrong it can still be a political problem it can still be an impeachment problem for President Trump if the Democrats ever god forbid got controlled the House of Representatives but it is not actual legal crime okay this is not legal crime so we can put that to the side but what the Democrats were saying that this was the beginning of actual collusion this is where they started coordinating okay well there's no proof that actual coordination actually happened because all of the people in the meeting came out and said that was worthless do the ladies even have any information they're a couple of threats that exist even if the information was worthless threat number one was that this was sort of the opener that the Russian government now knew that the Trump campaign was willing to hear more stuff and so maybe there would be collusion down the road but we haven't found any evidence of that threat number two is that now that there's been this meeting they can hold that over Trump's head right they could the Russians could hold this over Trump's head they could say anytime we want we can drop the information that you are quasi colluding with us or trying to collude with us and destroy your presidency but now the information has been dropped so the threat is a little bit gone unless there are more shoes to drop but there are some outstanding questions that I want to go through about this particular meeting and I think they actually do require answers now because they are things that the Trump is going to be asking the Trump administration are going to be asked to number one did any information actually pass hands so everybody at the meeting as I say Kushner Paul Manafort the then campaign manager the Trump jr. vessel mitts kiya Natasha wood Natalia whatever her name is all of them say no information changed hands the problem is you wouldn't expect them to say differently right who and that meeting is going to say yeah they give us a bunch of information about Hillary Clinton then we used it no one's going to say that right that's one that Skye would have to then admit that she was basically an agent of the Russian government and the other three people in the room would actually be in danger of prosecution if the information was illegally obtained so none of them are actually going to say it and they all have a little bit of a history of dishonesty with this particular matter Manta port has been a Kremlin stooge for years the I mean when going back to 2012 there there's a guy who approached me about working with Manta fort and was basically posing him as a stooge of the Ukrainian government at the time so this is not any sort of great shock at that time the Ukrainian government was in league with with Vladimir Putin Trump jr. had fibs about the meeting he said it didn't take place and he said it didn't take place but we talked adoption and then finally he admitted what the meeting was about Kushner did not put on his forms of this meeting ever took place so maybe I was oversight maybe it was dishonesty but at least calls trust into question and we have no idea who this Veselin that Skye lady is right I mean she says she's not a Russian agent but there's evidence to suggest that she is a Russian what they call a cutout which is to say somebody who works for the Russian government but has plausible deniability so we just don't know if any information was passed in this meeting and the reason that I say this is because you know if you if you look back to here's from jr. this is clip debris Trump jr. talking about what happened in the meeting did you tell your father anything about that it was such a nothing there was nothing to tell me I wouldn't even remembered it until we start scouring through the stuff it was it was literally just a wasted twenty minutes which was a shame okay so it's a wasted 20 minutes now this is believable right I mean like he looks like he's telling the truth here but I will just remind you that Hillary Clinton said this about Loretta Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton they talked about grandkid thank you very much on our minds these days golf said a mutual friend former attorney General Janet Reno it was purely social they did not just a year off of speaking about those kinds of you know very common exchanger okay so I'm not suggesting that Donald Trump jr. is definitely lying because I don't know whether he's lying or not what I will say is that if Hillary Clinton had done the exact same thing would have said there's no way she's telling the truth right Bill Clinton Loretta Lynch don't get together in a room but we in the middle of the campaign to talk about grandkids right we all said that this is complete nonsense and it turns out that it did compromise the investigation in in such a way that James Comey felt the necessity to actually get himself involved in the investigation where he had no place if we're going to hold the standard that we don't know what happens behind closed doors and we have to be suspicious my feeling is that we have to be pretty consistent about this so that's question number one did any information actually change hands because that would actually be successful collusion not just attempted collusion second who approved Donald Trump jr. statements so on Saturday I know listen I'm trying to be the most honest take I can hear so as I say no crime was committed it's not clear to me that Donald Trump jr. did anything you know legally I don't think I did anything wrong legally wrong anyway it's not treason as the leftist proclaiming but to pretend that this is a big nothing burger is being dishonest I think when people say it's nothing burger it's because they're not actually taking an even quasi objective looked at this okay so on Saturday Donald Trump jr. released a statement about this particular meeting and here's what he said he said quote it was a short introductory meeting I asked Jared and Paul to stop by we primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow-up I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand so all of this is technically true right all that's technically true but it misses the two main points which is the meeting was specifically held to pass on cert about Hillary Clinton and second Trump jr. fully expected that he was going to be meeting a Russian government lawyer into her name but it said right in the email that this is going to be a Russian government lawyer so the problem is the New York Times is reporting that the White House pre-approved Trump jr. statement on Saturday which looks more like a cover-up than it does like an attempt to be transparent if Trump jr. had just released the statement that'd be one thing but for the White House to approve a statement that it knew was false and was going to be debunked within 72 hours not a good look for the White House okay and then there's the biggest question of all which is did Trump himself know about the meeting and the everybody at the meeting says no you know Trump jr. says no it's a little hard for me to believe that Trump was completely out of the loop given the fact that again all of his top campaign officials were in a room with this lady for half an hour two days after he had secured the nomination but it's possible it's possible to have this meeting and they didn't tell him it's possible that they wanted to shield him actually they want to have the preliminary meeting and then if it had turned into something maybe they go talk with Trump the left is trotting out this video just so you know they're trotting out this video on June 7th that's when Donald Trump jr. confirmed the meeting with the Russian official source supposedly that was going to pass on this devastating information about Hillary Clinton that night like four hours later here is what Donald Trump said on the campaign trail to put 15 I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons I think you're going to find it very informative and very very okay so there are a lot of people saying he never gave this speech right everybody I remember when she said this everybody was expecting him to give this big barn burner of a speech where he tore down Hillary Clinton he never gave it so people were suggesting that maybe what happened here is the Jared and Trump jr. called them up and said hey pops we're going to get some information and you're going to want to hear this information and Trump got out in front of himself that's definitely a possibility but that's correlation not causation again no proof that Trump knew about what was going on here okay this brings into question this is the fourth question about this and that is why did Trump fire call me so my theory in my working theory it's still my working theory is that Trump fired calling me because he knows that he's innocent and he's ticked off that James Comey wouldn't say that he was innocent even though privately Tim's coming was saying he wasn't under investigation because of this email there's another plausible theory that's now gaining ground because the councilor theory to that was Trump fired to call me because he was getting too close I never believed that because there was no there there it's hard to believe that Trump was going to fire him over a big nothing right maybe he fired him because he was mad but to fire him for getting close to something that doesn't exist seems weird but because of Trump Jr's involvement now it's possible that you know Trump tried to fire economy because maybe he was trying to protect Donald Jr this is the theory the left is trying to put forward now so I believe that theory no I don't think there's enough evidence for that theory at all but I'm just informing you of what the left's theory with regard to Comey would be like why was so innocent why was it so urgent that Trump wanted Comey to announce that he wasn't under FBI investigation except that maybe he was scared that I was going to get close to Donald jr. okay final question and this one is is the most interesting I think is who week the news of this meeting in the first place so this meaning only had four people in it right it had the the Russian and then it had three of trumps campaign officials all of whom are still working for Trump so or Manta Ford isn't but he has no interest in revealing this meeting because it cuts against his attempts to distance himself from his Russian connection so who actually leaked the news of the meeting to the New York Times apparently they've been working on this for months what exactly drove all of this the most obvious source is obviously Corey Lewandowski so Corey Lewandowski was technically still the campaign manager at the time he wasn't fired until June 20th and he hates Manta for because a metaphor took his place he feels like metaphor doused at him he does not like cushion air because he thinks that Ivanka owl stood him and he's not a huge fan of Donald Jr from what I understand because Donald Jr was present at his firing so Lewandowski has a lot of interest in revealing all of this stuff to hurt the other three and then Trump was talking about flirting with Lewandowski bringing him in bringing him back that'd be some pretty hard-nosed ball from from Corey Lewandowski leaking news of this meeting that could definitely damage Trump Lewandowski has of course denied knowing anything about the meeting but he was the campaign manager at that time right this is two weeks before he was fired he was campaign manager at the time so it's quite possible he was even copied on the email here's the bottom line this whole thing opens account of warmth the Trump administration did not want open it's going to be very difficult to close that can of worms particularly when the credibility for Don Jr has been so shot on this particular meaning now do I think that this is all a distraction from Trump's legislative agenda absolutely so I think the media are over selling it yeah I do because instead of treating this as the first step or treating this is a case of we now have motive but no we don't have means or opportunity yet the media is treating this as The Smoking Gun right this is the be-all end-all and it is bad I mean I'm not gonna pretend it's not bad but it is not everything the media is cracking it up to be now I want to go through what Trump jr. actually had to say about this in just a second but before I do that I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the US EPA so you're at home it's late at night and suddenly you hear somebody trying to bust through your front door so you go to your safe you take out your gun and the person busts through when you shoot them what do you do now so everybody's story sort of ends with and that's when I shot the guy coming through my front door but the reality is the police will then come and they will probably arrest you right there we'll take you away to very least they'll question you it will eat up years of your life it'll cost you thousands of dollars any time you're in a shooting situation you're going to spend enormous time and money dealing with it that's why you need to talk to my friends over at the u.s. ECA the u.s. concealed-carry Association right now the u.s. ECA has made part of their mission how to protect you after the shooting so not only do they educate you and train you about guns and how to use them and when to use them to make sure that you are legally and financially protected for after you pull the trigger that's the u.s. ECA and right now they're still doing this deal even post fourth of July they're doing the great American giveaway and want my listeners to know about it in honor of July 4th which just happened last week and they are giving away 1776 dollars worth of guns and ammo of your choice 1776 1776 dollars worth of guns and ammo of your choice and they're picking five winners you can have a chance to be one of those winners one of those five winners that defend my family now calm defend my family now calm and that will give you all the information about the u.s. ETA should join up give them your information and then you're registered to win at 1776 dollars in guns and ammo so go check it out defend my family now dot-com you can check that out right now and again us ECA is just fantastic group you should definitely be involved with them okay so let's go through what Trump jr. actually said so using on Hannity Kennedy is is the friendly press outlet that the Trump administration goes to when they have a problem because they know they're not going to get a lot of hard bulbs which is fine I mean Obama did the same thing with CNN and MSNBC for legitimately years so Trump jr. said that he would have done some things differently which seems like the understatement of the century like I said in retrospect I probably would have done things a little differently again this is before the Russia mania this is before they were building it up in the press for me this was opposition research they had something you know maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I'd been hearing about but they were probably underreported for you know years not just during the campaign so I think I wanted to hear it out but really it went nowhere and it was apparent that that wasn't what the meeting was actually about okay so basically here he is just jobless right jobless from Arrested Development there's a huge mistake hey that's a there are a lot of comparisons being made to between Joe Bluth and John jr. last night you had done some things differently yeah that would been good I mean first of all if you're going to engage in this sort of subterfuge then perhaps you shouldn't put it in open the email that seems like not a good way to do it Trump jr. then says if there'd been anything illegal I would have gone to the authorities right away I said it earlier a hundred percent I would bring it to the proper authorities so there's nothing that I would do to ever endanger this country I think the reason we fought so hard during this campaign whether it was my father and the work that he put into it whether it was the rest of our family and the efforts that we put into it and you know those efforts well because we'd do anything for this country so we're never going to put that in jeopardy everything okay so the other comparison is being made with with John Jr today is of course Fredo Corleone that's if Donald is the Don then then unfortunately done jr. is Fredo so yeah it hasn't been a good 24 hours for John Jr okay so now I want to go to what the Democrats are saying about all of this because the Democrats are saying about all of this is full-scale nutty so as I say I think that there's a little more nuance than Democrats are saying number one it is attempted collusion okay to pretend anything otherwise is stupid it is attempted collusion because clearly there is willingness on the part of the Trump campaign to meet with the Russian government official or what they perceive to be a Russian government official to pass on Hillary's information I'm sorry about whether that's moral or not in a second look that's okay or not in a few minutes because that is the the lurking question underneath all of us is how far is the right willing to go to defeat Hillary Clinton and the Democrats is that okay is it okay to work with the Russian government to take down Tillery Clinton because I'm already starting to see the the shades of Jack Nicholson in a few good men you can write ordered the Code Red you know that's like we're almost there we're almost to the point where they're a bunch of people on the right who are basically saying okay so fine so there was collusion what do I care you want did they we'll talk about that in just a second but the Democrats are of course doing what they always do which is blowing this way out of proportion it's one of the reasons why Americans can't take all of the super seriously because they're not waiting for the evidence so Tim Kaine as you recall the vice presidential candidate one of the most quickly forgotten vice presidential candidates in human history actually knee recall that he ran against Hillary he ran with Hillary Clinton and it was basically Hillary Clinton and in this bag of white paint and so that was the bag boy paint being campaign here is here is Tim Kaine talking about how this is treason treason you think the first reason that the investigation it's not nothing is proven yet but we're now beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's being investigated this is moving into perjury false statements and even in the potentially treason okay a ninja treason here is the constitutional definition of treason article 3 section 4 a treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or on confession in open court no we're okay we're not actually going to send Don Jr to the electric chair over having a meeting in from tower with a lawyer who had no information as far as we know so that's just awesome so so yes the Democrats are of course making mockery of themselves because they cannot take a win they cannot just sit there and take a win they of course have to blow it out of proportion to make asses of themselves we'll talk more about that plus Joe Scarborough saying that he is leaving the Republican Party uh but for that you're going to have to go over to daily wire comm and become a subscriber for $9.99 a month you can

appreciate it we have the largest conservative podcast in the nation so now is of course a perfect time for the right to virtue signal so there are a bunch of people on the right who have decided that now is the time to virtue signal see we told you so about Trump okay listen I'm one of the people who is very to put it mildly I was rather trump skeptical during the election cycle if you recall all the way back then but I don't think this is an i-told-you-so moment I don't think this isn't a you know all these people who voted for Trump you or don't you were so long see what he's doing now no I think everybody who voted for Trump basically knew what they were getting and what they were getting was a guy who was this right I don't think this is a huge enormous shock I think that you know this is this is basically he bought what you paid for and maybe it was better than Hillary Clinton but it comes along with some baggage you have to recognize that one of the great ironies is Joe Scarborough over on MSNBC he says that he has done with the Republican Party he's leaving he and mica they've had it they're leaving mica was never a member of the Republican Party but he's on with Stephen Colbert one of the great Schmucks in Showtime and and here is and here is Joe Scarborough apparently decided to copy the hairstyle of Andrew Garfield from any number of movies and or to simply get out of the shower rub his hair with a towel and or substitute a brillo pad for his hair he's got the do fro going actually here is here is night magicians definitely for going here is Joe Scarborough explaining why he's leaving the Republican Party like any of us truly care desperately what do you think is happening with your own party I think it's I think it's inexplicable I hold on as well as for Donald is it inexplicable Joseph a Scarborough is it truly inexplicable Josefina agh Scarborough is it you spent the entire election cycle pumping up Donald Trump you spent the election cycle talking about how the American people just didn't get the appeal of Donald Trump you had him on your show every morning you had him call in you sat in a room with him during the primary results coming in and you chortled with him and now you turn around and oh he's so mean because he was mean to me cos face oh okay so as I say everyone knew what they were getting there are very few surprises in politics if you're surprised by anything that is currently going on with the Trump White House let me suggest that you were blinding yourself to reality before you didn't this stuff and the same is true for Joe Scarborough but I thought Donald Trump was my best friend he wasn't your best friend dude okay I thought that the Republicans were all going to turn on him really you didn't but here's Joe Scarborough a three-term Congress person who's made a fortune being an iconoclast and here he is talking about how he's going to leave the Republican Party maybe he'll start his own party the Joe and meek a wedding party it'll be awesome Trump was elected president but my party has betrayed their core values time and time and time again they turned the other way and they're doing the same thing now and it's actually discussing and you have to ask yourself what exactly is a Republican Party willing to do how far they willing to go how much of this country and our values are they willing to sell out but aren't you a Republican I am a Republican but I'm not going to be a Republican anymore I've got to become an independent yay and the crowd goes nuts so thank you for that virtue signaling Joe Scarborough not you're not going to stay inside the Republican Party and fight for the soul of it if you really think all these things you're not going to try and correct the mistakes you're not going to try and win people over to your side you're going to leave the Republican Party all together and this is what the left wants right with the left actually won so they're calling for is for everyone who doesn't like the stuff that they are seeing from from right and I don't like the stuff I'm saying from from junior I don't like a lot I mean I think I've been pretty clear about what I think Trump is good when he's bad right we've done good from bad from for nigh on two years at this point so I've been pretty clear about this my goal is to make Trump a better president at this point my goal is to make the conservative movement a better conservative movement at this point it isn't to leave and dump all over the movement because I have to signal to everybody what a swell guy I am the web keeps saying well if you really want to resist from Y don't resist his agenda well what his agenda is wrong I will resist it but if you if you think that I'm going to want to raise taxes and increase Medicaid spending because I think that Trump is sometimes a jerk and I think term maton be sometimes be corrupt if you think that like I just want to know when was last time a Democrat left Bill Clinton's agenda behind because Bill Clinton was a sleazy scumbag like when was when was the last time the Democrats decide you know what I can't take all these lives from Obama I'm becoming a Republican that's not what people do okay so this is just a way to please that crowd over at Stephen Colbert so virtue signalling from people like Joe Scarborough so how is the write responding to all of this there are really four approaches on the right to all of this approach number one is to focus on the legality people saying listen this is not illegal okay no matter what you say this is not illegal so Jeffrey Toobin who's not even on the right he is the lefty legal commentator on CNN he makes the point and he is correct this is not illegal activity by Donald Trump jr. as far as we know how serious is this these emails from a legal perspective it's certainly very very serious but it's also important to say you know there is a long way to go and these emails in and of themselves are not proof of any crimes two things to think about one is it is a crime for campaign officials to solicit anything of value from a foreign government so the question is was anything solicited here of value were that were email solicited was hacking solicited that is the question investigators will want to explore the other issue is the Jared Kushner who is now a very high White House official he's copied on these emails the question is did he disclose these meeting this meeting to when he filled out his form applying for security clearance if he intentionally left it off that's a crime it's not a crime if he simply forgot or made a mistake this meeting though certainly seems pretty dramatic even in the context of a dramatic campaign the idea that he simply forgot about it strikes me as probably a little hard to believe okay fine so he's going after Jared but Donald Trump jr. didn't break any laws as far as we know even Jeffrey Toobin is admitting that so this defense that it's not illegal is correct I point out once again illegal does not mean moral okay so if it's not illegal that doesn't mean that he did something good and it also doesn't mean he didn't do something that could get his dad engaged so Democrats we're going to try to impeach from no matter what but this does not help okay approach number two is the what app what about ISM I talked about at the top of the show and that is the what about Obama right what about Obama and here is Ted Cruz talking about President Obama and why it is maybe I are ignoring all this stuff I think that we have had eight years of Barack Obama showing nothing but appeasement towards Russia okay and that is a hundred percent true the question is the question is what kind of what about is are we going to engage in so I think that it is fair to say to the media you guys are hypocrites right you're over the top coverage of this just demonstrates how leftist you are so the critique is not of Hillary so much as it is of the media coverage right why is the media coverage so over-the-top about Trump but when it comes to when it comes to Hillary Clinton they were willing to brush all this stuff under the table and comes to Obama they're willing to brush all this stuff under the table that is an effective form of what about ISM what is not an effective form is Donald Trump jr. did something bad but Hillary also did stuff that was bad and that wasn't a big deal so why should this be a big deal right that is the kindergarten version that when your kid comes home and it turns out that they but they did something bad they said well Billy did it too and so I don't care what Billy did why does that make any difference you know that's like this is stuff that we learned when we were in kindergarten but I just we now have to relearn it in politics okay so that is approach number two is what about the Democrats okay the Democrats are terrible now is this good right that's still a question that has to be asked and we have to decide that for ourselves is it something good I'm gonna get to that in a second approach number three is can we talk about the real issues right that is this isn't that big a deal right the proportionality argument this isn't that huge a deal okay so they took a meeting what's the big deal Hillary Clinton did it about Ukraine no one complained about that now they're artisan there's one distinction which is the Ukrainian government is not adversarial to the United States with the Russian government is and the Russian government was indeed trying to intervene in the election even in ways the Ukrainian government was not but this is not a bad line so Sebastian Gorica who's a White House foreign policy adviser he says why aren't we talking about like a huge news story that happened yesterday which is the defeat of Isis in Mosul don't you think it's time the American people were served by the media justly and you get to national security issues like Mosul we're going to get to most in one minute mr. Gargan he's right when and the answer is never they're never going to get to Mosul so this I think is a good approach I think Republicans should be saying to the media why don't you cover this stuff they should also be saying Trump do just ignore all of this same Muller's investigating it'll take it's quite like I've been I've been singing the same tune on this for months now okay all Trump past a is sit on it you don't think it's course it's being investigated don't worry about it we'll get to it now look at all this magnificent stuff I'm doing instead what Trump does is he unleashes a tweet storm about the investigation and then at the end he tacks on and why don't we focus on Mosul it doesn't work that way he's the president he gets to help set the agenda if he is hiding in the White House for the past three days he hasn't done any public events instead of out there on the trail talking about Mosel how are we supposed to know about Mosel he is right the media is adversarial to trump they want to destroy Trump Kennedy's destroyed Trump media meme is not wrong okay I think Shawn's wrong on some stuff I don't think he's wrong on this I think the media do want to destroy Trump but it is Trump's responsibility to fight back using the best tools at his disposal and that is not okay I'm going to go out I'm going to argue with Bob Bob Muller it's I'm going to go out and I'm going to talk about Mosel incessantly I'm going to provide a counselor narrative and the counter narrative is we are doing things things are getting done and the media won't talk about them because they prefer to distract you over here right this is I think the best line that Republicans can use on this and also we're going to be as transparent as we can be okay then there is the final approach and this is the most morally perilous approach okay this is an approach taken by my good friend John Nolte now a published Nolte over at Daily wire and one of the reasons I like publishing loyalty even though we have almost polar opposite opinions on these issues is because Nolte is very clear about what he wants right no if he does not try to hide the ball John is an honest guy he's honest enough to acknowledge what his argument is and the ramifications of that argument I want to read to you from know peas piece today on this on this story so he says the worst that Donald's from from your scandal gets the more I know Republican voters chose the right guy to run against Hillary Clinton in 2016 at first it looks as though the meeting in the question was something over to over something touchy-feely like adoption upon hearing that my first thought was wait you've just secured the nomination and the first thing you do is pull the campaign manager and Donald whisper into a meeting about adoption are you insane no kidding I was furious hey when the future of the country is at stake and you are up against the unholy trinity of the Clinton machine the entire mainstream media complex and their butthurt allies and never Trump there is no time to waste but then the truth came out we learned that the meeting was set up in the hopes of receiving information from the Russian government that would ensure Hillary Clinton never ever ever became president and my faith in the epic badassery of team Trump was restored maybe even bolstered okay this is why I love John I loved John because John just says what he thinks right he's not going to try and hide it so a lot of people on the right will deny that this is what they think but what John says is actually indicative of a large percentage of what Republicans think this Trump world is populated with people who will do anything anything to win and as long as it remains legal those are my kind of Republicans Oh grow up seriously y'all grow the hell up I understand there are a lot of people who listen to the show who agree with this perspective the reason I disagree with this perspective is because I think that it does walk into dicey moral territory and I'm sorry I bring up things like principles and morality in the context of this but I thought that politics was about upholding principle now you can say myq principle is beating Hillary Clinton but there are still rules and engagement so for example I assume that John would not be in favor of somebody walking into Hillary Clinton's office and shooting her to stop her from becoming president even if she's the existential threat John thinks she was to the country I'm fairly certain that John is not in favor of the use of violence my guess is that there would be other things that John would not be in favor of like if you were going to set Hillary Clinton up in some sort of sexual peccadilloes sting right you're going to you're going to entice her into something John might find that abhorrent maybe not maybe not but I think that we need to know what the rules of engagement are because otherwise we're gonna get into some pretty dicey territory however evil you say your opponent is however destructive you say your opponent is that helps justify whatever action you take what makes a person immoral is when your means are not geared to your end so someone cuts you off in traffic get out of your car and you beat them to death with a baseball bat this makes you an amoral evil person because the consequence did not meet the bad act right someone cut you off in traffic does not merit being beaten to death with a baseball bat now someone attempts to kill your child that merits you beating them to death with a baseball bat right so the same act can be moral or immoral based on what it is done in response to the problem is that in politics we are now reaching the point where the most political benefit can be gained if you say my political enemy is Hitler my political enemy is the worst person ever but that also means that you're going to be using outsize modes of defeating that person right you're willing to now cooperate with one of the worst people on planet earth Lattimer Putin in order to stop who you perceived to be the worst person on planet or Hillary Clinton right Vladimir Putin is less threatening to you and less threatening to the world Hilary Clinton so Hillary Clinton must be stopped that justifies anything and everything up to and including Russia Russian involvement now let's say for example and this is obviously not true let's say that there was a situation where Isis had some sort of damaging information on Hillary Clinton she knew that they knew that she had shipped guns to them or something and they went to the Trump campaign and they said here's the information on Hillary Clinton would people on the right go along with that well it depends how bad they think Hillary Clinton is because maybe the means are OK in order to stop Hillary Clinton here's my view of Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton was a uniquely damaging figure in American public life Hillary Clinton was a uniquely dangerous character it's why I found her so unpalatable that I would not vote for either her or Donald Trump right I did not there was not a point in the campaign where I talked up Hillary Clinton none I thought Hillary Clinton would be a disaster for the country I did not think Hillary Clinton however was Vladimir Putin which means that the methods I was willing to use were restricted to things like truth and not cooperating with Russia and engaging in certain means that were that were dedicated to or defeating her here's the truth the easiest way to defeat Hillary Clinton was to side with Russia the easiest way to defeat Hillary Clinton might have been a shooter but I wasn't in favor of any of those things because I think that's immoral in politics the easiest way to defeat somebody is to have no rules this is why so many people on the right like Trump but having no rules can be immoral if you are miss calibrating the threat of your opponent a Hillary Clinton is still an American Hillary Clinton may be a bad bad person you may believe bad bad things you may want to do bad bad things but I still don't think that justifies cooperating with an enemy of the United States and Russia in order to take Hillary Clinton's down nor do I think it's necessary nor do I think it's necessary I think Donald's from very well kind of taking down Hillary Clinton without Russia how do I know that because I think that's what he did I think the Donald Trump defeated her without colluding with Russia so this bizarre perception by people that Donald Trump didn't collude with Russia but if you tried to that's awesome because it just shows how far he was willing to go he didn't need to do that okay that's like saying I want to stop people from cutting me off in traffic I beat him to death with a baseball bat I didn't have to beat him to death with a baseball bat I probably just yelled at him and flipped him off or maybe honk my horn but I beat him to death with a baseball bat and you know what what makes me so cool is even if I didn't beat him to death as a baseball that I was willing to beat him to death with a baseball bat no the means have to be calibrated to the ends and you also have to honestly judge this listen me saying that I think Hillary Clinton is not Vladimir Putin is not talking up Hillary Clinton but it shows how ridiculous our political discourse has become that if I say something like that people on my own side will say that this is me being soft on Hillary I don't think that Hillary Clinton has to be Hitler in order to think that Hillary Clinton is a bad human being who never should have been within a thousand feet of the White House and to that's you know I think that we have to be very careful about this because our own mortal Souls are in danger and if you think that that's not at risk if you think that we can be as bad as anybody else if we can just use any means then I ask where you draw the line because you're asking the left to draw some line so I would ask for you to draw some more lines yourself okay time for things I like and then things I hate will do a little bit of Bible talk but before we get

talk so things I like so since we mentioned Joe Bluth I just have to say Arrested Development have I recommend to the restive element on the ship for Arrested Development is the plenty of series that ever was home's Arrested Development is absolutely hilarious you have to have a very quirky sense of humor to get it job is maybe the best character on the show job is the the kind of there there are three brothers there is Michael and is it Michael is that his name and then job and then what Buster that's right and it's been probably a couple years since I've watched the show and there it's just the cast is phenomenal hilarious it's full of references that you end up using with your friends here is a clip for this from the opening episode of Arrested Development when you first meet Joe Bluth job stands for George and then his middle initial was oh and then it so it's gob Bluth but he's called job which of course is a play on the fact that like everything bad in the world happens to job in the course of the show so here is here's govt here's Joe Bluth this is Michael's oldest brother oh poor job this is the magic trick huh lusion Michael trick is something a four-dose for money who's the kid standing right next to me it's okay Joe recently founded the Alliance of magicians an organization that blackballs any performer who reveals a magician secret hello I'm Joe glue as a magician I can make a lot of things disappear there are some things I can't make no not that candy ball machine the aspect to what box box is performing in buildings oh yes well let's get you in the box there's a panel just for there round circle of mind it don't make any noise all right ancient lore has it the Aztec gods put a curse on any man who does he go George Michael was off from school for two weeks and was enjoying spending time with his uncle intercepting some telepathic energy it's telling me the eight of diamonds that's amazingly close gee I got it wrong oh yes you won the shirt on my back okay that's a man queen of diamonds just the queen of diamonds no no no well I had I mean if that had been the actual card I'm pretty sure I'd be almost it's too blown away I was just amazing the hilarious show you should go check it out the Netflix Netflix did a fifth season to their four original seasons and then it was not on three okay so the fourth is the Netflix season the original three seasons are great I can't speak for the fourth season I watched the first two episodes they didn't hold up I'll have to watch the rest of the season until I fit holds up but it is just like it's a hysterically funny show okay time for a thing that I hate so Joan Walsh she used to be the editor over at salon.com she was on the MSNBC s and she said that Ivanka who as you recall took papa Trump's place at the g20 she sat in his seat and people were like wait a second we didn't we didn't elect Trump so we get a vodka in that seat that's a decent criticism but Joan Walsh makes a not so decent criticism here's her criticism of Ivanka Trump which is legitimately the stupidest criticism of all time I thought that was a very sink dress with sig's big bows on the elbows there's something incredibly ornamental that's not a dress that's made for work that's not a dress that's made to go out in the world and make a difference that is a dress that is designed to show off you're growing this and you know god bless her show it off but don't then tell us that you're crusading for an equal place for women at the table because you're not but you can't be a feminist and be girly at the same time it can be a feminist and be girly we all have our girlie days but I think showing up taking your father's seat in a pink dress with big bows on the sleeves is a really an interesting method really okay maybe maybe Joan Walsh should force a fountain Trump to wear I don't like a red cloak and maybe like a bonnet right and then she can like walk around in that and Joan can call her up Joan then she can be known as of Joan that would just be Ivanka Trump's name okay this is how insane the feminist movement has become so a woman so powerful that she sat in for the President of the United States at an international conference she is not powerful because she has bows on her sleeve and this is your lead critique Joan Walsh and then you wonder why we think feminists are a joke we think feminists are a joke because of people like you because that's ridiculous okay that is insane women can look pretty and also be feminist at the same time my wife does it everything day she's super smokin hot and she wears pretty clothes a lot and she is a doctor as I've mentioned 1 bajillion times on this program she is fully capable of being a feminist and dressing like a beautiful woman this idea they have to dress like a hag in order to be a feminist is not going to forward the feminist cause very much boy oh boy Joan Walsh okay finally I am going to do a quick quick Bible talk so this week is the Jewish portion of pin cast from the Torah Thursday as I say every week now there is an Associated portion from the from the prophets and the writings that we read every week as well this one happens to be from the Book of Jeremiah and this of course is one of more famous verses from the Book of Jeremiah and it says it says when I had not yet formed you in the womb I knew you and and when you had not yet emerged from a woman had appointed you a prophet to the nation's I made you this is of course used by the pro-life movement to point out that your existence as a human being predates your emergence from the womb of course that is true the idea is that God provides you value from the very very beginning and God knows you as a human being from the very very beginning and you are predestined to have a certain skill set but as we see all throughout Tanakh because we see all throughout the Torah and the prophets and the writings and the New Testament as well just because God has foreordained a particular a particular job for you doesn't mean that you're necessarily going to fulfill it so there are two points two major one is that God knows you and he knows you well enough to know what he expects of you that's what it means when it says when I had formed you in way not yet formed you in the womb I knew you I knew what to expect of you because I'm the one who created you and I appointed you when you had a responsibility I made you a prophet to the nation's but we still have the choice whether to fulfill that responsibility ourselves this is where that moral choice comes in the fact is that Jeremiah could have decided not to fulfill that plan and he would have been sinning against God in doing so right this is the story of Jonah when Jonah refuses to take God's message for for at face value and he tries to run away from God he's unable to escape it but he does have the choice to attempt to avoid it we all have that choice but that's a choice that we should not make because God knows that's even better than we know ourselves okay so we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show you
