>> Bill: THE RACE IS ON TO FILL
RETIRING SENATOR BOB CORKER'S
SEAT IN TENNESSEE APPEARS TO BE
A CLOSE ONE.
REAL CLEAR POLLING AVERAGE HAS
THE REPUBLICAN BLACKBURN
LEADING BREDESEN BY SIX POINTS.
MARSHA BLACKBURN IS WITH ME NOW.
I SAW A POLL THAT SHOWS YOUR
OPPONENT UP A POINT.
WHAT'S GOING ON IN TENNESSEE ON
THIS RACE?
>> I TELL YOU, THERE WILL BE
ALL SORTS OF POLLS.
THE ONLY ONE THAT COUNTS IS
NOVEMBER 6 ON ELECTION DAY.
WE INTEND TO WIN THIS RACE.
WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS RACE.
>> Bill: SO THE PRESIDENT RIGHT
NOW IS DOING A FOUR-STATE SWING.
HIS STRATEGY IS OBVIOUS.
HE IS PUTTING IMMIGRATION ON
THE FOREFRONT OF A LOT OF MINDS
OF AMERICAN VOTERS ESPECIALLY
WHEN IT COMES TO ARIZONA TODAY
AND TEXAS ON MONDAY.
IS THAT A BIG DEAL IN TENNESSEE?
>> IT IS SUCH A BIG DEAL.
THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF LOOSE
IMMIGRATION POLICIES, EVERY
STATE IS A BORDER STATE AND
EVERY TOWN IS A BORDER TOWN.
AND IN MY RACE IN THE U.S.
SENATE WHEN PHIL BREDESEN WAS
COVER NOR HE ISSUED VALID STATE
ISSUE TAXPAYER FUNDED DRIVING
CERTIFICATES TO 51,000 ILLEGAL
ALIENS.
HE MADE OUR STATE A MAGNET FOR
ILLEGAL ALIENS.
AND PEOPLE IN TENNESSEE
REMEMBER THAT.
THEY DID NOT LIKE THE POLICIES.
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAD TO GO
IN AND CHANGE THAT POLICY, SHUT
IT DOWN.
AND PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN
THAT WE SECURE OUR BORDERS AND
WE END SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES.
>> Bill: HE IS A PRETTY POPULAR
GOVERNOR.
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD RACE.
I MENTION THE ISSUE ABOUT
IMMIGRATION.
THIS IS WHAT OUR FOX POLLING
FOUND OUT A FEW DAYS AGO.
THEY PUT HEALTHCARE AS THE
NUMBER ONE ISSUE FACING
AMERICANS, THE ECONOMY IS
NUMBER TWO, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
NUMBER THREE.
TAKE NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER
THREE FOR A MOMENT HERE.
PERHAPS THE ECONOMY SLIDES TO
NUMBER TWO BECAUSE THINGS ARE
GOING WELL FOR A LOT OF FOLKS
RIGHT NOW.
HOW DOES THE PRESIDENT PLAY IN
TENNESSEE IN THIS VOTE?
>> TENNESSEE APPRECIATES DONALD
TRUMP.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT
WE HAVE KAVANAUGH ON THE
SUPREME COURT, TENNESSEANS
REALLY LIKE THAT.
THEY SUPPORTED BRETT KAVANAUGH
AND THEY WANTED HIM CONFIRMED.
THEY'RE SO GLAD PRESIDENT TRUMP
STOOD WITH HIM AND I TELL YOU
WHAT THEY DO LIKE, TOO, IS
LINDSEY GRAHAM'S COMMENTS.
HOW HE CAME TO THE DEFENSE OF
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND CALLED OUT
THE DEMOCRATS FOR PLAYING
POLITICS WITH THIS.
SO YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES KEEPING
TAX CUTS, JOBS AND THE ECONOMY,
KEEPING THAT GOING, THE
IMMIGRATION ISSUE.
TENNESSEANS WANT TO GET THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OFF THE
BOOKS.
THE REASON IS THAT HAS DRIVEN
UP THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
IN TENNESSEE BY 176%.
>> Bill: YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR
OPPONENT WOULD SAY GET RID OF
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS GOING ON THE
ROAD.
I THINK HE IS GOING TO 12
DIFFERENT STATES.
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR HIS
TRAVEL IS TO REMIND PEOPLE
ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH
CONFIRMATION.
DOES THAT THEN SUGGEST IN A
NEWS CYCLE THE KHURNS EVERY
HOUR OF EVERY DAY THE KAVANAUGH
BUMP MAY BE DISSIPATING FOR
REPUBLICANS?
>> NO, IT IS NOT DISSIPATING.
I STARTED MY MORNING HERE IN
CHATTANOOGA WITH A GROUP OF
VETERANS OVER AT THE VFW.
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY
TALKED ABOUT WAS HAVING GOOD
FEDERAL JUDGES AND HAVING GOOD
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.
AND THE REASON IT IS SO
IMPORTANT TO THEM IS NOT
NECESSARILY ABOUT TODAY, IT IS
ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR
GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR FUTURE
AND PRESERVING THESE FREEDOMS
THAT THEY PUT ON THE UNIFORM
AND THEY FOUGHT FOR.
SO THEY BRING IT UP.
OUR TENNESSEANS BRING THIS UP
IN JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE
CONVERSATION.
AND I AM REALLY DELIGHTED THAT
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS GOING TO BE
REMINDING PEOPLE ABOUT THIS
BATTLE.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SO MANY
PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN
HERE IN TENNESSEE, WATCH WHAT
WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST JUSTICE
KAVANAUGH AND THEY SAID WHAT IF
THAT WERE MY HUSBAND OR MY
BROTHER OR MY SON?
WHAT IF THEY WERE DENIED AN
OPPORTUNITY?
WHY IS HE CONSIDERED GUILTY?
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE INNOCENT
UNTIL WE'RE PROVEN GUILTY.
AND THAT REALLY KIND OF STRUCK
THE CORD OF FAIRNESS WITH
PEOPLE IN TENNESSEE AND THEY
WANT TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND
HAVE DUE PROCESS.
>> Bill: YOU WONDER IF IT CUTS
DIFFERENTLY BETWEEN MEN AND
WOMEN.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN 18
DAYS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WELL TWO
YEARS AGO IN TENNESSEE.
SHOULD THIS RACE RIGHT NOW BE
AT SIX POINTS?
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU, PHIL
BREDESEN -- THIS IS HIS FOURTH
STATEWIDE RACE AND HE HAS THAT
STATEWIDE NAME I.D., AND WE
KNEW IT WOULD BE A TIGHT RACE.
HE HAS ALL THE MEDIA AND MONEY
WORKING WITH HIM.
CHUCK SCHUMER, MIKE BLOOMBURG.
THE DEMOCRAT ORGANIZATION HAVE
PUMPED A LOT OF MONEY INTO
TENNESSEE.
THEY'RE PUMPING IT IN HERE
REALLY AS FAST AS THEY CAN.
>> Bill: WE'RE WATCHING IT
CLOSELY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
