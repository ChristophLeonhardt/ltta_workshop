“You and your co-founders started
a company in your dorm room
that’s grown to be one of
the biggest and most successful
businesses in the entire world.
While Facebook has
certainly grown,
I worry it may not have matured.
I think it’s time to
ask whether Facebook
may have moved too fast
and broken too many things.”
“Who do you think owns an
individual’s presence online?
Who owns their virtual you?
Is it you or is it
them?”
“Congresswoman, I believe that everyone 
owns their own content online.
And that’s the first line
of our terms of service,
if you read it, says that.”
“After this new algorithm was
implemented, that there
was a tremendous bias
against conservative
news and content
and a favorable bias
towards liberal content.
Was there a directive
to put a bias in
and first are you
aware of this bias
that many people have looked
at and analyzed and seen?”
“ Congressman, this is a
really important question.
There is absolutely no
directive in any of the changes
that we make to have
a bias in anything
that we do.“
”Well, you have a long
history of growth and success.
But you also have a
long list of apologies.
In 2003, it started at Harvard.
‘I apologize for any harm
done as a result of my neglect.’
2006: ‘We really
messed this one up.’
2007: ‘We simply did a bad job.
I apologize for it.’
This is proof to me that
self-regulation simply
does not work.”
“Are you aware of other
third-party information mishandlings
that have not been disclosed?”
“Congresswoman, no, although we
are currently going through
the process of investigating
every single app—”
“So you’re not sure?”
—that had access
to a large amount of data.”
”All right, but—
I only have four minutes.
Was your data included
in the data sold to the
malicious third parties?
Your personal data?”
“Yes.”
“If you don't, 
you’re not listening
to us on the phone,
who is, and do you
have specific contracts
with these companies
that will provide
data that is being
acquired verbally
through our phones
or now through things
like Alexa or other products?”
“Congressman, we’re not collecting
any information verbally
on the microphone, and we don’t
have contracts with anyone else
who is.”
“Facebook has
detailed profiles
on people who have never
signed up for Facebook.
Yes or no?”
“Congressman, in general,
we collect data
from people have not signed up for
Facebook for security purposes
to prevent the kind of
scraping that you were just
referring to.”
”As C.E.O., you didn’t know
some key facts.
You didn’t know about major court
cases regarding your privacy
policies against your company.
You didn’t know that the F.T.C.
doesn’t have fining authority
and that Facebook could not
that have received fines
for the 2011 consent order.
You didn’t know what
a shadow profile was.”
