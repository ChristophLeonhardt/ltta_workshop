my name is Pete Souza I was the chief official White House photographer for President Obama to set the scene a little bit it was about a month since he had been reelected to a second term so there was that sort of afterglow that was still being felt I think throughout the White House it was also a Christmas time at the White House so there were these decorations and Christmas trees and a very festive time of the year and word began to come out that there had been the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown and and finally his homeland security advisor John Brennan came up to the Oval Office he'd gathered all the facts had talked to the FBI and told the president that indeed 26 people had been shot in 20 including 20 first grade kids and the in the picture you see just kind of the energy just zapped out of the president I think he was thinking of this not only as a as a president but imagining what it must be like as a parent the horror of sending your six-year-old kid off to school you put him on the school bus and you never see them again because some crazy guy shot them to death point-blank at their school so I think was a very he was very emotional and just thinking about this as a fellow parent almost more so than as the president not long thereafter he had to go make a statement in the White House press briefing room and he it was difficult for him to maintain his emotions as he talked about this and I think that was probably when he cried for the first time they had their entire lives ahead of them birthdays graduations weddings kids of their own among the Fallen were also teachers men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams
