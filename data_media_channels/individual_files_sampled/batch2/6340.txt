Chris Hedges has a great article about how the elites exactly screwed everything up it's entitled the useful idiocy of Donald Trump he says the Trump backed by the most retrograde elements of corporate capitalism including Robert and Rebecca Mercer Sheldon Adelson and Carl Icahn is the fool who prances at the front of our death march as natural resources become scarce and the wealth of the Empire evaporates a shackled population will be forced to work harder for less state revenues will be squandered in grandiose projects and futile wars in an attempt to return the Empire to a mythical Golden Age the decision to slash corporate tax rates for the rich while increasing and already bloated military budget by fifty four billion is typical of decayed civilizations the Russia investigation is unlikely to unseat the president he will not be impeached for mental incompetence over the emollients clause or for obstruction of justice although he's guilty of all these counts he is useful to those who hold real power in the corporate state however much they would like to domesticate him I'm gonna read that again he meaning Trump is useful to those who hold real power in the corporate state however much they would like to domesticate him the inability of the political establishment and the press to moderate or reform Trump's egregious behavior is rooted in their loss of credibility this is key right here the the the establishment media and the establishments loss of credibility is why they can't reform Trump's egregious behavior the press along with political intellectual elites spent decades championing economic and political policies that solidified corporate power and betrayed and impoverished American workers the hypocrisy and mendacity of the elites left them despised and distrusted by the victims of deindustrialization and austerity programs so do you see what he's saying here he's saying that so when the establishment tries to rein Trump into having the act better or be more polite it doesn't work anymore because they have no moral authority anymore because everyone knows what they've been pushing has been the destructive disruption of the working class so they now know that now the attempt to restore civility to public discourse and competency that political office is therefore fleet 'less liberal and establishment institutions including the leadership of the two main political parties academia and the press squandered their moral authority and the dogged refusal by the elites to address the engine of discontent social inequality ensures that they will remain ineffectual they lay down the asphalt for the buffoonery of Trump and the coming tyranny he's accurately addressing the blame on the system that gave us Trump which Trump is a part of and why he's allowed to be part of his because he's serving that system and that system likes Trump and what he's doing and so that's what we're not talking about when Russia when Rachel Maddow talks about Russia for 59 minutes in a 60 minute show that's what we're not talking about is the system that gave us Trump and how the system is now embracing him by the way so let me throw it over to anything did you ever wish you could make something required reading yes for an entire country yeah cuz I'm having one of those moments right now yeah I think he really sums up our contemporary situation and he pretty much covered all the bases and yeah I'm gonna tweet that out later because that that that should just be required reading for everybody if it lives here yeah unfortunately it won't be read by most people yeah I would say 99.99% of the people are not gonna read that why did TruthDig ever get throttled or anything like that yes you're kidding me well right now it's happening that so again this is why when people say if you're not a hate monger if you're not slandering you don't have anything to worry about censorship they're already throttling lefty publications meaning on YouTube they're throttling our shows alternate alternate is being throttled common dreams TruthDig so if your world's a socialist website is being throttled by Google so that there they're redirecting people who normally would go to those websites to other websites so it's already happening that's what you have to just say so this is already happening right and and and places like where you're gonna hear these kind of stories are being throttled anything did you that was it yeah yeah you know just the idea that they're they're going to diminish any dissenting voice and that's a part of the machinery and you can't keep people in lockstep you can't people could keep people controlled if you inform your population and they don't want us to be informed they don't want us to be engaged they like that half the country doesn't vote so when Barack Obama goes to Italy and says oh if you don't vote that's the government you get no because we got that government that's why half the country doesn't vote you jag off and he knows that go ahead well I always say oh like we have two things going on very very like rampant in society right now we have a one end you have Trump derangement syndrome and then the other end is what I like to call Trump denial syndrome and Trump derangement syndrome are the people that you know they make it out like Trump some anomaly like like Oh George W Bush was a gentleman and Dick Cheney and blah blah blah and then you have the Trump denial syndrome who are the people who think he's actually an outsider that wants to buck the establishment I think this puts both of those to rest I think this this kind of unmasks everything for what it is where Trump it's just another player in the game he's not an anomaly policy-wise he is just as repulsive as all the Republicans and he's certainly not some outsider either he's just part of the bigger scheme of things and unless we really attack the system as a whole we're not gonna get anywhere I agree and the whole idea you know when we see people coming together on the streets and they're marching for something I say we start marching to have our voices represented in our government and that we march together unified for a country whose pro-peace wouldn't you go to that I'd go to that and if you're a country that's Pro peace I bet you're also a country that is Pro Medicare for all not only that I bet you Pro College free tuition for people - so that's those are the Marches that we need to bring together because Trump did promise that we would have peace prompt Trump did promise where everyone would have health care health care and you know I'm looking for health care access to college to peace and a living wage oh my god how about a jobs program well we should be marching for not marching against Donald Trump let's March for so much yes something we've come to another end of the aggressive progressives but you haven't heard the end there's a lot more to this show and you can get it earlier when it actually drops so the news is timely what do you got to do to have that happen go to tea white tea network.com /join become a member
