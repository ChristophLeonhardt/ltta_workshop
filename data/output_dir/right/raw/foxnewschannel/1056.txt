SURROUNDING FREEDOM OF THE

PRESS.

3
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:02,993
IT'S TIME FOR TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:02,993 --> 00:00:07,598
BREAKING NEWS OPENING

5
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:08,265
MONOLOGUE.

6
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:09,900
WE ARE EXCITED.

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,601
IT IS OFFICIAL.

8
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:11,969
WE ARE HITTING THE ROAD.

9
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,304
NEXT WEEK WE WILL BE ON THE

10
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,071
GROUND IN SINGAPORE.

11
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:15,639
OF COURSE TO COVER THE LATEST

12
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,675
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

13
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,343
HISTORIC AND CONSEQUENTIAL

14
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:20,711
TALKS WITH THE DICTATOR KIM

15
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,112
JONG UN.

16
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:25,582
TONIGHT WE ARE DAYS AWAY FROM

17
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:26,684
THE DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN THE

18
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:27,685
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND

19
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:29,386
NORTH KOREA.

20
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:32,256
SOMETHING MANY THOUGHT WAS

21
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,656
IMPOSSIBLE.

22
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:35,292
SOMETHING OBAMA, CLINTON AND

23
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:36,360
KERRY AND OTHERS AND THE

24
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,430
FRIENDS ON THE LEFT COULD ONLY

25
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,235
DREAM OF.

26
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:46,403
THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE

27
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,072
SIGNIFICANT SUMMITS OF MODERN

28
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:48,739
HISTORY.

29
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:49,406
>> President Trump: I HAVE

30
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,508
BEEN PREPARING ALL MY LIFE.

31
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:52,176
I BELIEVE IN PREPARATION.

32
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:53,544
I HAVE BEEN PREPARING ALL MY

33
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:53,877
LIFE.

34
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,346
THE ONE-WEEK PREPARATIONS

35
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,013
DON'T WORK.

36
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,181
JUST ASK HILLARY WHAT HAPPENED

37
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:03,520
TO HER IN THE DEBATE.

38
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,988
I HAVE BEEN PREPARING ALL MY

39
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:05,456
LIFE.

40
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,223
>> Sean: WE REMINDED

41
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:07,224
EVERYBODY REMEMBER THE DEBATES

42
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:07,991
WITH HILLARY?

43
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:08,726
AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE

44
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:09,893
MIKE POMPEO WHO HAS BEEN

45
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,061
WORKING VERY HARD ON ALL OF

46
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:11,428
THIS.

47
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:12,329
HE WEIGHED IN.

48
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:14,898
LOOK AT THAT.

49
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:15,899
>> THE FACT THAT THE TWO

50
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:16,934
LEADERS ARE COMING TO THE

51
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:18,268
TABLE SHOWS THAT THE TWO SIDES

52
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:19,470
ARE SERIOUS.

53
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,771
THE DIPLOMATIC MODEL USED

54
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,905
TODAY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE

55
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:22,373
PAST EFFORTS.

56
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,608
OUR EFFORTS GIVE US HOPE WE

57
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:26,877
CAN FIND REAL SUCCESS FOR PAST

58
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:30,114
EFFORTS HAVE FALLEN SHORT.

59
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:32,516
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HOPEFUL.

60
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:34,251
HE IS ALSO GOING IN THE SUMMIT

61
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,786
WITH HIS EYES WIDE OPEN.

62
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:37,287
WE HAVE SEEN HOW MANY

63
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:38,722
INADEQUATE AGREEMENTS HAVE

64
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:39,923
BEEN STRUCK IN THE PAST.

65
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,325
YOU CAN BE SURE THAT PRESIDENT

66
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:43,861
TRUMP WILL NOT STAND FOR A BAD

67
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,294
DEAL.

68
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:44,828
>> Sean: ALL RIGHT.

69
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:47,664
HOW DO WE GET TO THIS POINT?

70
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:48,866
HISTORY LESSON.

71
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:50,033
"HANNITY" HISTORY LESSON.

72
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:53,504
WE START IN THE '90s.

73
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:59,410
BILL CLINTON.

74
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,780
HEB HE MET WITH KIM JONG UN'S

75
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,614
FATHER, KIM JONG IL.

76
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:05,382
HE PROMISED THIS WAS A GOOD

77
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:07,484
DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

78
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:11,522
AND HE PAID BILLIONS IN ENERGY

79
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,190
SUBSIDIARIES AND MADE

80
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,391
CONCESSIONS AS IF THIS WOULD

81
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,392
MAKE FOR WORLD PEACE.

82
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:16,627
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

83
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:17,895
YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS.

84
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:19,630
>> THIS IS A GOOD DEAL FOR THE

85
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,097
UNITED STATES.

86
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,298
NORTH KOREA WILL FREEZE AND

87
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,700
THEN DISMANTLE THE NUCLEAR

88
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,034
PROGRAM.

89
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,369
SOUTH KOREA AND OUR OTHER

90
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:30,374
ALLIES WILL BE BETTER PROTECT

91
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:35,479
ED.

92
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,880
SOUTH KOREA WITH SUPPORT FROM

93
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,248
JAPAN AND OTHER NATIONS WILL

94
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:39,416
BEAR MOST OF THE COST TO

95
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,651
PROVIDE KOREA WITH FUEL TO

96
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,819
MAKE UP FOR THE NUCLEAR ENERGY

97
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,823
IT IS LOSING.

98
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,624
THEY WILL PAY FOR ALTERNATIVE

99
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:48,992
SYSTEM TO ALLOW THEM TO

100
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:50,527
PRODUCE ELECTRICITY TO MAKE IT

101
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:51,495
HARDER TO PRODUCE NUCLEAR

102
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:51,829
WEAPONS.

103
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,596
THE UNITED STATES AND THE

104
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:53,997
INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS WILL

105
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:55,599
CAREFULLY MONITOR NORTH KOREA.

106
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,436
TO MAKE SURE IT KEEPS ITS

107
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:01,238
COMMITMENTS.

108
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:03,507
ONLY AS IT DOES SO WILL THEY

109
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:04,575
FULLY JOIN THE COMMUNITY OF

110
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:05,075
NATIONS.

111
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:06,043
>> Sean: BILL CLINTON WAS

112
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:06,710
DEAD WRONG.

113
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,178
NORTH KOREA SUCCESSFULLY

114
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:10,080
DEVELOPED A NUCLEAR WEAPONS

115
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,447
PROGRAM.

116
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:11,682
UNDER EIGHT YEARS OF THE

117
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,650
FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA, HIS

118
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,053
WEAK AND FECKLESS LEADERSHIP,

119
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:19,857
WHILE KIM JONG UN'S ACTIONS

120
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:20,858
BECAME MORE HOSTILE.

121
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:22,993
PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT TRUMP

122
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:24,194
WITH UNFETTERED INTERNATIONAL

123
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:25,195
DISASTER AFTER DISASTER.

124
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:26,296
THIS IS JUST ONE.

125
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:27,231
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK

126
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:29,666
OFFICE IN 2017, THE SITUATION

127
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,802
IN NORTH KOREA WAS AT A

128
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:32,703
BOILING POINT.

129
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:33,670
REMEMBER, KIM JONG UN SHOOTING

130
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,172
THE LONG-RANGE MISSILES OVER

131
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:35,806
JAPAN.

132
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:42,813
THREATENING TO BLOW UP GUAM.

133
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,949
AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF WEAK,

134
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,150
PATHETIC SPINELESS LEADERSHIP

135
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,485
UNDER OBAMA, THINGS HAVE

136
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:48,852
CHANGED.

137
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:50,053
PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDED.

138
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:53,557
YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS.

139
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:54,191
>> President Trump: NORTH

140
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,292
KOREA BEST NOT MAKE ANY MORE

141
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:58,295
THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES.

142
00:03:58,295 --> 00:03:59,830
THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE,

143
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:07,237
FURY AND FRANKLY POWER.

144
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:10,173
THE LIKES ANY HAVE EVER SEEN

145
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:10,574
BEFORE.

146
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:11,875
PEOPLE QUESTIONING WAS IT TOO

147
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,242
TOUGH?

148
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:13,544
MAYBE IT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH.

149
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,045
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR

150
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,245
THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME.

151
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:17,414
FOR MANY YEARS.

152
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:18,682
IT'S TIME THAT SOMEBODY STUCK

153
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,117
UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS

154
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:21,351
COUNTRY AND FOR THE PEOPLE OF

155
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:28,992
THE OTHER COUNTRIES.

156
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,662
IT'S A TRAGEDY AND IT CAN'T BE

157
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:32,029
ALLOWED.

158
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:34,164
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO GUAM,

159
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:35,065
THERE WILL BE BIG TROUBLE IN

160
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:35,632
NORTH KOREA.

161
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:37,234
IF HE DOES ANYTHING WITH

162
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:38,201
RESPECT TO GUAM OR ANYPLACE

163
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,903
ELSE THAT IS AN EMERGENCY

164
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,538
TERRITORY OR AN AMERICAN ALLY

165
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:45,642
HE WILL TRULY REGRET IT.

166
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:47,744
HE WILL REGRET IT FAST.

167
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:48,946
ROCKET MAN ON A SUICIDE

168
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:51,315
MISSION FOR HIMSELF.

169
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:52,816
AND FOR REGIME.

170
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:53,550
>> Sean: OF COURSE THE

171
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,153
PRESIDENT THEN BACKED UP HIS

172
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,588
TOUGH RHETORIC WITH ACTION.

173
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,357
AND HE SENT MULTIPLE CARRIER

174
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:01,391
AND STRIKE GROUPS TO THE

175
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:01,725
REGION.

176
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,393
HE RAMPED UP DEVASTATING

177
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:04,394
SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREA.

178
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:05,996
AND, OF COURSE, PUT A LOT OF

179
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:07,497
PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA'S

180
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:09,333
BIGGEST ALLY, CHINA.

181
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,234
HE FORGED A GREAT RELATIONSHIP

182
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,336
WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT.

183
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:14,438
WHAT THIS IS CALLED, THESE

184
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,272
WORDS ARE PEACE THROUGH

185
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:15,639
STRENGTH.

186
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,276
BY THE WAY, IT SAID YOUR MAIN

187
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,645
STREAM CORRUPT DESTROY TRUMP

188
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:24,948
MEDIA TO A HYSTERICAL FIT.

189
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:26,049
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP.

190
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:26,817
TAKE A LOOK.

191
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,619
>> THE IDEA OF A NUCLEAR

192
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,753
SHOWDOWN WITH NORTH KOREA

193
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:31,321
KEEPS YOU AT NIGHT?

194
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,457
I WOULD RECOMMEND DELETING

195
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:34,858
YOUR TWITTER APP.

196
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,059
>> HE'S NOT BEING CAVALIER

197
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:38,195
WITH A THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR,

198
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:39,896
IT'S CAVALIER IN A WAY THAT

199
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:41,698
MAKES HIM SEENDY MEANTED.

200
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:42,866
>> THIS IS FROM A PERSON WHO

201
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,101
IS NOT WELL, FROM A LEADER NOT

202
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:45,669
FIT FOR OFFICE.

203
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,937
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOODING

204
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:50,507
KIM JONG

205
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,608
GOODING -- GOADING KIM JONG UN

206
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:55,312
TO TEST THE NUCLEAR FACILITY

207
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,014
AND SHOW HIM WRONG.

208
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:59,349
FUNDAMENTALLY IT COMES ACROSS

209
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:02,919
AS TWO KINDERGARTENERS

210
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,988
JOSTLING EACH OTHER BUT THEY

211
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:06,323
EACH HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

212
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:10,027
>> TOO LATE AFTER 100 MILLION

213
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:10,827
AMERICANS DIE.

214
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:11,628
>> THAT IS WHERE WE ARE.

215
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:13,497
THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION.

216
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,464
>> TRUMP'S COMMENT ABOUT THE

217
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:15,399
NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE THE

218
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,969
EXPERTS WORRIED HE COULD

219
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:20,704
TRIGGER A CATASTROPHE.

220
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:21,738
>> Sean: WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN

221
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:22,773
THAT THE MEDIA IS ABSOLUTELY

222
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:23,140
WRONG.

223
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,807
THEY WERE WRONG.

224
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:28,445
THEY ARE WRONG.

225
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:31,515
ALL ICBM TESTS DONE.

226
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:32,983
THEY RETURN THREE AMERICAN

227
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:33,350
HOSTAGES.

228
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,254
THEY AGREE TO DISCUSS THE

229
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:37,954
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF

230
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,990
THE KOREAN PENINSULA IN

231
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,658
EXCHANGE FOR NO CONCESSIONS.

232
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:44,761
HE CROSSED OVER THE D.M.Z. TO

233
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:46,063
THE ARMS OF THE SOUTH KOREAN

234
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:47,364
PRESIDENT AND DISMANTLED ONE

235
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:48,832
OF THE NUCLEAR TEST SITES.

236
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:50,200
DESPITE THE DIPLOMATIC

237
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,868
PROGRESS YOUR MEDIA IS HATING

238
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:54,971
AND DOUBTING AND SADLY MANY

239
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,306
EVEN ACTIVELY ROOTING FOR

240
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:56,640
FAILURE.

241
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,908
THIS WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE

242
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:58,275
WORLD.

243
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:01,511
OUR KIDS, OUR GRAND KIDS.

244
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:04,948
LOOK AT THE NBC CONSPIRACY

245
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,316
HOST QUESTIONING TRUMP'S

246
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:07,884
PREPAREDNESS FOR THE UPCOMING

247
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:08,251
SUMMIT.

248
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:09,019
WATCH THIS.

249
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,554
>> WE HAVE TO POINT OUT, THE

250
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:12,322
PRESIDENT WAS CRITICAL WHEN WE

251
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:14,624
PLAYED THAT CLIP OF HIM

252
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,727
TALKING OF BEING PREPARED FOR

253
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,861
THE NORTH KOREA SUMMIT WE

254
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:18,895
DIDN'T ADD WHAT HE SAID AT THE

255
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:19,229
END.

256
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,130
HE WAS CRITICAL.

257
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,965
HE SAID, "I'VE BEEN PREPARING

258
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:22,933
ALL MY LIFE."

259
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,301
I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHEN WAS

260
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:25,102
THAT?

261
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:27,637
WHEN YOU APPEARED IN A PLAYBOY

262
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:29,539
SOFT CORN MURPH VIE OR BODY

263
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,808
SLAMMED VINCE McMAHON OR

264
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:32,976
WHEN YOU WERE LEAKING

265
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:35,512
INFORMATION WHEN YOU DISGUISED

266
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:36,947
YOURSELF AZURE OWN P.R. GUY

267
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:38,482
TALKING TO TABLOIDS ABOUT WHAT

268
00:07:38,482 --> 00:07:41,017
A GREAT LOVER YOU WERE.

269
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,919
>> Sean: TAKE A LOOK AT THE

270
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,955
COVER FROM "THE ECONOMIST"

271
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:46,923
SHOWING PRESIDENT IN PLACE OF

272
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:49,960
MILEY CYRUS, THE WRECKING BALL

273
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,629
THAT WAS INFAMOUS.

274
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:54,064
SAYING EVEN IF HE STRIKES A

275
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:54,898
DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA THE

276
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:57,601
FOREIGN POLICY WILL HARM THE

277
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:57,901
WORLD.

278
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,469
THAT IS ROOTING FOR FAILURE.

279
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:00,904
THE MEDIA TRIES TO BASH THE

280
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:01,905
PRESIDENT AT EVERY TURN THEY

281
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:03,073
CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.

282
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:04,608
HE HAS A LOT OF REALLY

283
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:07,310
IMPORTANT DIPLOMACY TO TACKLE.

284
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,545
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE

285
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:10,280
UPCOMING TALKS ON SINGAPORE

286
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,047
THROUGHOUT THE SHOW.

287
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,182
WE'LL BROADCAST THERE NEXT

288
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:12,549
WEEK.

289
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:13,750
FIRST TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP

290
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,253
LANDED IN QUEBEC IN CANADA TO

291
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,554
MEET WORLD LEADERS AT THE

292
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,022
ANNUAL G7 SUMMIT.

293
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:20,157
TENSIONS WERE RUNNING HIGH

294
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:21,391
AHEAD OF THE MEETING AFTER

295
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:22,125
PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED

296
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,427
PLANS TO TACKLE SOME OF THE

297
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:26,530
UNFAIR TRADING INTERNATIONAL

298
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,999
PRACTICES WITH RETALIATORY

299
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:29,432
TARIFFS.

300
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:36,807
HE WANTS FREE AND FAIR TRADE.

301
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,542
HE WROTE PRIME MINISTER

302
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:41,010
TRUDEAU IS BEING INDIGNANT

303
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,711
BRINGING UP THE RELATIONSHIP

304
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:42,813
THAT THE U.S. AND CANADA HAD

305
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,280
OVER THE MANY YEARS AND OTHER

306
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,648
THINGS.

307
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:46,149
HE DOESN'T BRING UP THE FACT

308
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,318
THEY CHARGE UP TO 300% ON

309
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:48,819
DAIRY.

310
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,721
HURTING OUR FARMERS, KILLING

311
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:58,628
OUR AGRICULTURE.

312
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:00,897
HE CALLED IT'SLATED AND THIS

313
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:02,799
IS WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT WHAT

314
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,067
COULD BE A TENSE AND THE

315
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,770
INTERESTING G7 TRUMP SUMMIT.

316
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,405
TAKE A LOOK.

317
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,139
>> President Trump: IF WE

318
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,341
ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A DEAL, WE

319
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:12,709
WILL TERMINATE NAFTA AND HAVE

320
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,310
A BETTER DEAL.

321
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,811
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A

322
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:23,987
DEAL, WE WILL BE BETTER OFF.

323
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:26,156
THE E.U. TREATS US UNFAIRLY.

324
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:27,624
CANADA, UNFAIRLY, MEXICO,

325
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:27,991
UNFAIRLY.

326
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,459
WITH THAT SAID I THINK WE WILL

327
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,128
PROBABLY EASILY MAKE A DEAL.

328
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:32,996
>> Sean: WHILE THE PRESIDENT

329
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:34,164
IS BUSY DOING WHAT HE DOES

330
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,665
BEST, THAT IS NEGOTIATING, I

331
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:37,300
KNOW IF I ASK HIM TO COME ON

332
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,135
THE SHOW, I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE.

333
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:39,469
15.

334
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:40,971
HOW ABOUT SIX?

335
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:41,972
GIVE YOU 14.

336
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:43,073
THAT IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

337
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:43,440
DOES.

338
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,475
THE MEDIA HAS BEEN BEING DOING

339
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:48,945
WHAT THEY DO BEST.

340
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:52,182
SPREADING ANTI-TRUMP IT HAVE

341
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:54,351
HAVE -- VITRIOL.

342
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:55,852
ESPECIALLY AT NBC NEWS.

343
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:57,420
LOOK AT HOW DISGUSTING THE

344
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,389
CLIP IS NBC HOSTS ARE TRASHING

345
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,124
THE WOMEN IN THE PRESIDENT'S

346
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:02,759
LIFE.

347
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,694
THIS IS SO DERANGED AND OFF

348
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:05,395
THE RAILS.

349
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:11,167
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP.

350
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,068
>> YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THE

351
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:13,169
TRUMP WOMEN, THE TRUMP FAMILY

352
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:13,737
THAN ANYONE.

353
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:15,238
WHAT DO THEY DO ON A DAY LIKE

354
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:15,572
TODAY?

355
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:17,407
ARE THEY THE MOST STOIC HUMAN

356
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:17,974
BEINGS?

357
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:19,209
ARE THEY NUMB, DEAD INSIDE,

358
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:19,643
PAID OFF?

359
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:21,311
WHAT IS THE DEAL?

360
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,479
>> YES, YES, AND YES.

361
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,915
I THINK THEY DO NOT SEE

362
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,049
PRESIDENT TRUMP THE WAY THAT

363
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:27,484
ALL OF US SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP.

364
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:29,552
THEY HAVE A DISTORTED IMAGE OF

365
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:33,390
WHO HE IS.

366
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,758
THEY DON'T HAVE THE REACTION

367
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:35,759
WE DO.

368
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,494
>> THEIR MOTHERS KNOW.

369
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:38,929
THEY SEEM TO BE RAISING NICE

370
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,296
KIDS.

371
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:42,532
HOW DO THEY WALL IT OFF?

372
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:43,466
>> DEAD INSIDE?

373
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,135
ARE YOU PROUD OF THIS?

374
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:46,503
THIS IS YOUR NETWORK.

375
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,971
IS THAT NEWS TO YOU?

376
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:49,272
WHAT ABOUT THE CLIP BY THE WAY

377
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:52,642
FROM YOUR MORNING ANCHOR?

378
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:53,343
LIBERAL JOE.

379
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:55,378
AND ANDY LOOK, ARE YOU REALLY

380
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:57,681
PROUD OF THIS BIZARRE

381
00:10:57,681 --> 00:11:00,050
CONSPIRACY THAT SHE IS NOW,

382
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,619
WELL, PAWNING OFF AS NEWS ON

383
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:03,687
YOUR SO-CALLED NEWS NETWORK?

384
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:04,688
HERE YOU GO.

385
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:12,128
I HOPE YOU LOVE IT.

386
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:14,097
>> THE HYPOCRISY IS ASTOUNDING

387
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:15,498
BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEONE WHO

388
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:16,900
SPOKE TO DONALD TRUMP RECENTLY

389
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,968
ABOUT LIFE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

390
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,402
AND DONALD TRUMP'S BIGGEST

391
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:20,937
COMPLAINT IS HE IS NOT ALLOWED

392
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,206
TO WATCH PORN IN THE WHITE

393
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:23,573
HOUSE.

394
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:24,307
SO THERE YOU GO.

395
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:26,009
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF NEWS

396
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:26,376
FOR YOU.

397
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,111
HE IS UPSET HE CAN'T WATCH

398
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:29,946
PORN IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

399
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:32,649
>> I BET THEY HAVE THOSE

400
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,084
ONE-900-NUMBERS BLOCKED, TOO,

401
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,452
WHICH MUST BE A

402
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:36,119
DISAPPOINTMENT.

403
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,021
>> I'M NOT SURE BUT IT FLIES

404
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:38,755
IN FACE OF ALL OF THIS.

405
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:39,956
>> Sean: OF COURSE, NBC NEWS

406
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:41,725
IS FAR FROM BEING THE ONLY

407
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,326
NEWS OUTLET WITH THE EXTREME

408
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,494
BIAS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.

409
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,696
MANY IN THE MEDIA, WELL, THEY

410
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:47,964
HAVE BEEN GOING AFTER YOURS

411
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:49,265
TRULY ALL WEEK BECAUSE OF A

412
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:50,433
MONOLOGUE I DID EARLIER IN THE

413
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:50,800
WEEK.

414
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,203
ALL I DID WAS HIGHLIGHT A SAD

415
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:54,971
EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS A

416
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,006
TWO-TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM IN

417
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:56,439
THIS COUNTRY.

418
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,008
WE DON'T HAVE EQUAL JUSTICE

419
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:58,475
UNDER THE LAW.

420
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:01,311
WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF JUSTICE

421
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,013
FOR THE CLINTONS AND ONE FOR

422
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,880
THE REST OF US.

423
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,548
I WAS OBVIOUSLY BEING

424
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:06,750
SARCASTIC AND MAKING A

425
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,150
COMPARISON.

426
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,653
I SAID WHAT IF I SAID THAT

427
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:11,688
THOSE THAT ROBERT MUELLER

428
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:13,623
REQUESTED THE PHONES FROM,

429
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:16,059
WHAT IF -- I SAID IT'S A BAD

430
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,427
IDEA.

431
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:17,861
KIDDING.

432
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,863
I SAID ALL SORT OF CAVEATS.

433
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,364
WHAT IF THEY FOLLOW HILLARY

434
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,198
CLINTON'S LEAD?

435
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:23,733
WHAT IF IN FACT THEY DECIDED

436
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,202
TO DELETE THE E-MAILS, WIPE

437
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:29,439
AWAY ALL EVIDENCE, ACID WASH

438
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:30,407
AND BLEACH THE HARD DRIVES ON

439
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:32,375
THE PHONES AND SMASH THEM UP

440
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,444
TO ITSY BITSY PIECES WITH

441
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:34,844
HAMMERS.

442
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:36,613
THEY WERE MORE MAD OF THE ME

443
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,214
THAN THEY WERE AT HILLARY FOR

444
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:40,817
ACTUALLY DOING THESE THINGS.

445
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:42,986
THIS IS A TASTE OF HOW THEY

446
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:44,454
DISTORTED THESE COMMENTS.

447
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:45,889
>> SEAN HANNITY IS NOW

448
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,024
LITERALLY TELLING POTENTIAL

449
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,459
WITNESSES AND SUBJECTS IN THE

450
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:54,297
MUELLER PROBE TO DESTROY THE

451
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:56,966
EVIDENCE.

452
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,668
AND HAMMER THE PHONES TO

453
00:12:58,668 --> 00:12:59,436
PIECES.

454
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:00,870
>> HANNITY DEFENDERS MAY CALL

455
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,472
THAT SARCASM AND POETIC

456
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:05,175
LICENSE BUT WORDS ARE WORDS.

457
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,310
SEAN HANNITY LIVES OFF HIS

458
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,611
WORDS AND WE KNOW THEY HAVE A

459
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:12,916
HUGE IMPACT.

460
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,184
IF ANYONE DOES WHAT HE SAYS

461
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,051
THERE, THEY WOULD BE

462
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,186
COMMITTING A CRIME.

463
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,787
>> WHAT SEAN HANNITY ADMITTED

464
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,722
TO AND WAS ENTICING PEOPLE TO

465
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,024
DO AND ASKING THEM TO DO IS

466
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,258
DESTROY EVIDENCE, WHICH IS A

467
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:23,760
VIOLATION OF THE WITNESS

468
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,929
TAMPERING STATUTE.

469
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,164
>> NO RESPONSIBILITY PERSON ON

470
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:29,966
TELEVISION, NO RESPONSIBLE

471
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,367
SO-CALLED JOURNALIST SHOULD BE

472
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,669
ADVOCATING FOR PEOPLE TO

473
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:36,005
DESTROY EVIDENCE IN A SERIOUS

474
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,808
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION.

475
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:40,276
>> I DON'T THINK WE WILL SEE

476
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:41,377
HIM PROSECUTED.

477
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:42,479
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS GIVE

478
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,981
PEOPLE A WIDE BERTH ON

479
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:46,416
FIRST-AMENDMENT RELATED

480
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,119
CONDUCT SO UNLESS THERE IS

481
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:49,953
SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC TO

482
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:51,554
LINK IT UP THIS IS WHAT WE

483
00:13:51,554 --> 00:13:54,057
CATEGORIZE AS AWFUL BUT LAWFUL

484
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:54,524
CONDUCT.

485
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:56,726
>> LISTEN, IF HE IS ADVOCATING

486
00:13:56,726 --> 00:13:58,862
FOR MUELLER'S WITNESSES TO

487
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,530
OBSTRUCT JUSTICE MAYBE MUELLER

488
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,665
SHOULD SPEAK TO HIM AND ASK

489
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:05,101
WHERE THE IDEA HAS COME FROM?

490
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,035
SAY THIS?

491
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,203
>> KNOWING MUELLER HE IS NOT

492
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:08,605
GOING TO LIGHT THAT FIRE UNDER

493
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:11,908
SOMEONE WHO GETS FREE AIR TIME

494
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:19,215
EVERY DAY.

495
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:23,753
HE CAN GO TO A JUDGE AND SAY

496
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:24,721
CEASE AND DESIST WHAT YOU'RE

497
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:27,490
DOING ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

498
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,058
AND DID TRUMP GET THIS IDEA

499
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:30,894
FROM YOU?

500
00:14:30,894 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sean: CEASE AND DESIST?
