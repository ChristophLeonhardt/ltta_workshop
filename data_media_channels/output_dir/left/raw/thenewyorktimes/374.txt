1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,800
"I was brought when I was 11."

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,610
"I came when I was
7 from Brazil."

4
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,630
"I was about 10."

5
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,700
"I was 12 years old."

6
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,850
"I was 7 years old."

7
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,060
"About 8 years old when I
came to the United States

8
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,220
with my mother and my sister."

9
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,410
"We crossed the border,
but we were little."

10
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,220
"My father was the first one
to leave Mexico and come here

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,730
in 2000, and then in
2001 my older siblings."

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,410
"So I've been here 18 years."

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,400
"I'm 29 years old."

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,530
"I am 20."

15
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,770
"I am 19 years old."

16
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,680
"I've been here for 21 years."

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,240
"I am 27 years old now."

18
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,804
"I am 23 years old and I
am originally from Mexico."

19
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:42,760


20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,520
"When DACA was announced,
I remember exactly where

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,560
I was in 2012.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,340
I was at the Museum
of American History."

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,700
"Before DACA, I always felt like
I was in between two worlds.

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,490
I was born in Honduras, but if
I were to go back to Honduras,

25
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,260
it's like I'm foreign to them."

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,550
"It's a tug of war.

27
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,770
When you're undocumented,
you're always

28
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,270
just wary of the situations,
of the locations, who

29
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,250
you are talking to, how
you're interacting with folks,

30
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,610
ensuring that you
don't do anything that

31
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,320
will bring attention
to you, because you

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,180
live a life of shadows."

33
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,260
"You know, I have been able
to accomplish a lot more than

34
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,050
when I was undocumented.

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,800
To get a Social Security
number, loans from the bank,

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,700
buy the car, a better job."

37
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,550
"I would leave behind
a network of friends,

38
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,250
family that are here.

39
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,580
Because a lot of us actually are
part of mixed status families."

40
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,310
"It's scary for me, because
you know, that type of job

41
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,010
that I have, you know,
motivating others and trying

42
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,650
to tell them like it's
O.K when I don't even

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,970
know if it's going to be O.K."

44
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,370
"Every time my parents
call me after 11 p.m.,

45
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,780
it's like my heart is racing.

46
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,240
When you are an immigrant
in this country,

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,880
you wake up every
day with the fear

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,940
that you could be taken away,
right, that your family could

49
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,870
be broken up."

50
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,370
"Well, I have been preparing
my kids of, you know,

51
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,220
these are the risks.

52
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,500
This could happen to
your dad and to me."

53
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,260
"I just can't --

54
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,240
can't imagine, you know,
my nieces and nephews

55
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,390
being separated from their
parents or them going back

56
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,250
to a country that
they don't know,

57
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,320
because this is their home.

58
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,060
They shouldn't
live with that fear

59
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,590
that I had to grow up with.

60
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,730
That's not a normal life.

61
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,170
That's not normal.

62
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,080
And I know that my friends
that are U.S. citizens

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,730
don't go through that.

64
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,830
And nobody should
go through that."

65
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,060
"I'm not leaving my home.

66
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,626
And I think, you know, if Trump
ever wanted to talk to us,

67
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:36,250
if he wanted to talk
to these dreamers,

68
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,780
he would realize that
we love this country,

69
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,530
want to stay here.

70
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,029
And --"

71
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:42,060
"If it's taken away,
I'm losing my job.

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,390
I'm losing the opportunity
of work and school.

73
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,340
People don't understand,
but it's a big thing.

74
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,300
It's a huge thing.

75
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,320
It's privileges that some
people here take for granted."

76
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,640
"Taking DACA away is like taking
a family member away from me.

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,810
That wall that Donald
Trump wants to build

78
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,530
is putting a wall in
front of me where I

79
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,350
won't be able to move forward."

80
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,900
"There are politicians who
are using us like a sport.

81
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,480
You know, they're using
us like punching bags."

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,650
"You are not just taking
something away from us,

83
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,836
but you're taking something
away from this country."

84
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:19,210
"Democrats and Republicans
alike have to stand up for us,

85
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,600
because there are DACA
beneficiaries in every state.

86
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,760
It's not just blue states."

87
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,320
"This land is not
a white America.

88
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,820
It's not.

89
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,580
This is a land of immigrants."

90
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,650
"I mean, I was already
a person before DACA.

91
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,660
A lot of people
say well, you know,

92
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,490
what's going to
happen after DACA?

93
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,210
I'm not going down
without a fight."

94
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,020
"You know, whatever happens
next, I love this country,

95
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,610
and I belong here."

96
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,070
"I'm fighting for my family.

97
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,980
I'm fighting for the friends of
mine that can't even stand up

98
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,000
because they're scared."

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,970
"We just want to stay here and
contribute to this country,

100
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,170
to the economy.

101
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,250
We are good people.

102
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,400
We're not criminals."

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:00:00,000
