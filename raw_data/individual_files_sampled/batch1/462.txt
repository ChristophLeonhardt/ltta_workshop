this is how the British ambassador to the United Nations was greeted at a refugee camp close to the bangladesh myanmar border the 24 member UN Security Council delegation led by Britain Peru and Kuwait came to assess the situation on the ground for more than a million refugees living here 700,000 of whom fled the crackdown by the Myanmar military which began in August they heard stories like these I was raped they killed my husband they burnt my two-year-old son I saw five men rape a twelve-year-old girl and then kill her we want justice from you thousands of refugees lined the roads as the delegation vehicles passed many held signs demanding justice and help in the coup to prolong refugee camp the delegates were split into groups to listen to more stories from victims of violence one man told them the Myanmar government would never tell them the truth do your investigations from your own countries he said Britain's UN Ambassador said it was vital the international community act with one voice we need to go back and evaluate what we've seen on this trip and see if we can come together to build on the unified view that the Security Council had back in November when it called on the government of Myanmar to do certain things to protect their anger and allow them to go back in conditions of safety so I think that's the immediate short-term priority Myanmar has banned any independent investigation into what the UN says is ethnic cleansing of the reh√©n jure Myanmar doesn't recognize them as an ethnic group it calls them Bengali what was then the Burmese government stripped rahim sure of their citizenship in 1982 last November the Security Council passed the resolution demanding Myanmar halt military action against the reinjure but the potential veto power of Myanmar allies China and Russia has stalled anything stronger than that at a news conference China's representative stated his country's position first is to cease violence to cease fire the second is to try to find the solutions of 17th by the courses when a journalist asked the UN delegates which of them used the word reinjure China's representative appeared not to understand but didn't raise his hand later he told me china respects water Ahuja calling ourselves the United Nations Security Council delegation came here to assess the magnitude of this crisis and what they've seen today and some of the stories that they've heard have no doubt given them a fair indication of just how terrible the situation is here it's fair to say they will probably hear a very different story in Myanmar from the government there and that means translating their findings into concrete unified political action at the Security Council could remain a challenge for some time yet Charles trafford al Jazeera coup to pile on the refugee camp on the dish
