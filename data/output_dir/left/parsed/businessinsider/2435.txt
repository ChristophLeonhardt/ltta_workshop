Have you ever been to Target
expecting to buy one or two things,
and then walked out hours later
with much more than you planned?
You're like oh, I didn't
know I needed this,
and then you just pick it off the shelf,
put it in your cart.
I just spend so long there,
it sucks me into a black hole.
Yeah same. It's a pretty
common experience,
and it's become known on the
internet as the Target Effect.
But it's more than just a popular meme.
It turns out Target has
a few ways of making sure
you'll want to take
everything off the shelves.
You've probably noticed
that it's pretty hard
to walk into Target,
grab one thing and leave.
The real genius behind that
is in the store's layout.
When you walk in, you'll likely see
a Starbucks near the entrance.
The coffee shop helps
establish a welcoming vibe,
inviting people to come in and hang out.
Once you walk past Starbucks,
the store flows naturally
from one section to the next,
so you end up browsing through
pretty much every aisle.
Right by the make up,
you'll find hair products.
Next to hair products are the toiletries.
Next to those are cleaning
supplies and so on.
Say you're planning on stopping by
just to pick up something
from the seasonal section
like school supplies in August
or Halloween costumes in October.
For those, you'll have to
head to the back of the store.
So you'll have to follow the store around
and then you know, before you know it
you've ended up filling
up your entire cart with
other stuff you didn't plan to get.
Visually, Target stands out
from other big-box retailers like Walmart
which can sometimes be
disorganized in comparison.
So Target's known for
having good, clear signage.
That's a kind of key way, you know,
if shoppers know where they're going.
They don't wanna get
frustrated in the store.
They can go straight there.
The stores are brightly lit and colorful,
the aisles are wide and the
merchandise is spread out
and well organized. That's
why Target is so enjoyable
to shop at, which is why
people end up spending
more time there than they planned.
And studies have shown
that the more time
customers spend in a store,
the more likely they are to spend money.
Customers also love Target's
exclusive private labels
which offer the latest
trends for affordable prices.
For example, its kids'
apparel line, Cat and Jack,
surpassed two billion in sales
just one year after its launch.
And these are often low cost
and so people might buy a lot
more than if they're going
to another store and it
was just national brands.
Partnerships with celebrities
like Victoria Beckham and Chrissy Teigen
also help drive traffic to the stores.
But Target makes sure to
constantly rotate its merchandise.
One of the most effective ways
to make people spend
money is to make them feel
like this product is only
gonna be available now.
Like, if you come like, next
week it's not gonna be there.
So buy it now.
This feeds into a sort of
treasure-hunt shopping experience
typical of stores like
TJ Maxx and Marshalls.
And if you're having
trouble finding something
Target employees are easily spotted
thanks to their red shirts.
If there's someone there to advise you
are more likely to buy things
cause you can get a bit of
an expert opinion. You're not
just shopping on your own.
Then there's Target's social media game
which is especially strong on Instagram.
It has 3.1 million followers.
That's more than Walmart
and Amazon combined.
Target encourages shoppers to
share photos of what they buy
for a chance to be
featured on its account.
So people are always posting
about their purchases.
Mary: It kinda brings the shopper in
to the experience and
there are loads of Target
kinda fan pages dedicated to the store.
Finally, near the cash registers
there's what Target calls
Bullseye's Playground,
where you'll find seasonal
items for only a few dollars.
I would blame the dollar bins
that are in the front.
Like oh I always have a dollar
to spend on some things.
Like I always get something there.
And it's like something
stupid like a pencil holder.
But NYU Professor Priya Raghubir
says the real key to Target's success
is that you don't actually
regret buying anything.
Those unplanned purchases,
they're often things people do want,
they just haven't thought of putting them
on their shopping list. So
what's something you recently
bought at Target that you
weren't planning on getting?
