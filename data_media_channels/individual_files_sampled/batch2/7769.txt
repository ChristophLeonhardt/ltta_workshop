a program that was aimed at helping reduce the number of teen pregnancies has been cut short by Trump's administration this was known as the teen pregnancy prevention program that was started under the Obama administration back in 2010 and it funds organizations working to reduce and prevent teen pregnancy with a focus on reaching populations with the greatest need now the whole point of this program is to just give teens the information and the sex education necessary to prevent them from getting pregnant but of course since it's not a fully abstinence only based program members of trumps administration have decided we don't like it we're gonna do away with it now they cut the program short so it was supposed to last about five years but they cut it down to three years HHS or the Department of Health and Human Services informed the recipients in their annual grant award letters that programs would end next year rather than in 2020 a cut of about 200 million over two years under Obama HHS approved 44 pregnancy prevention programs to coincide with their grants only three were abstinence education programs and that's probably what really upset some of the more right-wing the members of trumps administration for instance valerie huber a prominent national abstinence education advocate was recently named chief of staff to the assistant secretary for health which oversees the office that manages the teen pregnancy prevention program Valerie absolutely hates comprehensive sex ed she thinks that abstinence only sex ed is the only type of sex education that that students should get but she's wrong and I have numbers for you in just a second but you guys jumping yes so this one's not that much on Trump he's in charge so of course feel free to blame him but this is more standard Republicans conservative Republicans like Mike Pence who want the Stabbin and Tom Price who's a head of this department and so they think that human nature is optional and that when people hit puberty they don't want to have sex all you have to do is tell them no don't have sex or maybe yell atom ourselves belittle stern and they'll go oh all my human drives are gone that worked magically thank you so much it's so dumb and also when you consider the fact that people don't get married until much later in life like it's not the 1950s we're not getting married in 18 we're getting married in a lot of cases in our 30s and so what do you really you expect people to be abstinent until they're 30 yes so let's make a distinction here if we're talking about teenagers that are you know between 13 and 18 you're still wrong into if you don't want them to get pregnant and by the way this will increase the number of abortions so way to be counterproductive so but when you get above the age of 18 and you tell people don't have premarital sex that's like your opinion man I couldn't care less what you think oh but my God my sky God told me this well that's between you and your sky god dude and if you want to be horny the rest of your life actually I don't even want that because then you're gonna get take it out in all the wrong ways but this is America remember that thing called freedom so but out of our lives all these guys who claim they're for small government you know you when Donald Trump runs for president you see he's never gonna win the Evangel calls he's never gonna this is why the evangelicals come home because they know within these Republican administrations you're gonna get this kind of thought because you're gonna the influence of the Mike Pence's you're gonna the influence of the Tom prices that's gonna happen I just okay so they're gonna get policy that they like but your policy is so counterproductive especially here against you know abortion rising healthcare costs look the reason why Obama made birth control more available or easily obtainable was because we spend a lot of money on unwanted pregnancies right we spent 11 billion dollars a year on unwanted pregnancies so Obama didn't you know make that part of the Affordable Care Act in an effort to tell everyone like hey let's all around no he did it to save money no speech that way yeah people think that like women are like you know knocking down bottles of birth control and we're like hey hey hey we just want to be loose and have some but no we're trying to save money people we don't want teenagers to get pregnant anyway look I have actual data okay who cares about opinions let's go to actual facts so look if you want to compare two states that have completely different policies on sex ed you can look at New Hampshire New Hampshire only allows comprehensive sex education where they say the teenagers Hey look it's probably better if you wait but if you don't here's how you can protect yourself okay comprehensive sex ed they have the lowest teen birth rates of any other state in the US okay so it's about ten point eight per 1000 teens aged 15 to 19 okay then you go to Mississippi where they only allow abstinence only education and their their birth rate is much higher teen birth rate thirty four point eight per 1000 teens age 19 so okay there's a huge disparity there right okay then let's also compare administrations so bush comes into office same you know conservative ideology prevails and the teen pregnancy rate increases significantly so 40.2 / t natures okay then you go to the Obama administration where he's like yeah I'm defunding these abstinence only programs because they don't work and focusing more on comprehensive sex ed teen pregnancy rate decreases 21 3 / 1 per 1000 women okay look I just I want us to be smart I don't I don't care about anyone's religion I don't care about anyone's opinions I care about actual numbers and doing something that will decrease the number of abortions here's an example of something that will decrease abortions comprehensive sex ed teams are gonna have sex I know you guys don't like it but it's just a fact of life yeah but I do care about their religion because I want you to understand it and and there's two parts of it if you vote for a Republican you will get this so don't delude yourself and say oh no there I think there are some monitor problems no every Republican president that's come in has done abstinence only education has increased teen pregnancy as you see the numbers under Bush every one of them do this and they kills comprehensive sex education and that works on both ways that's what I was saying it's like if you are a conservative Christian for a Focus on the Family Guy here if you vote for a Republican even if he's not exactly like you are religiously you're gonna get this that's right and by the way your evangelical you will get more abortions in the country so okay if you're like hey but I hate birth control so much that I'm willing to have more abortions right okay all right that's your call but I understand what you're getting with it okay that's your call yeah and and for the and then the other part of it is look I think that the moderate Christians have a responsibility here to reign in their extreme Christians right because these extreme Christians believe that you shouldn't do birth control with ninety nine for some of the country agrees that we should be on birth control like they do it with their actions single women are on birth control and overwhelming numbers overwhelming to forget single women married women all women all adult women are on birth control in overwhelming percentages so it is only a minority extreme Christians that are dictating the policy for the rest of us now Christians are the majority of the country so you got a responsibility moderate Christians it's on you if you like this clip of The
