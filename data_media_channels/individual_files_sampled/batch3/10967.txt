Russia has not adhered to the agreement they should have been done years ago until people come to their senses we have more money than anybody else by far we'll build it up until they come to their senses when they do then we'll all be smart and we'll all stop and we'll and by the way not only stop will reduce the treaty in question the INF or the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty of 1987 it restricts what kind of nuclear weapons can be constructed it essentially outlaws short-range and intermediate range nuclear weapons nuclear missiles from being constructed it was signed back in 1987 it was seen as a key moment in ending the Cold War de-escalating the conflict between the USA and the Soviet Union now we know John Bolton is at this moment in Russia he has already met with the Russian Foreign Minister as well as the Russian National Security Council he is speaking rather vaguely about the possibility of a new treaty being negotiated and he isn't exactly clear on what the United States is going to do he's not using that bold type of language that we were hearing from Trump the United Kingdom has spoken up in support of this action by the United States saying the USA is right to make this move but throughout the European Union we are hearing a disappointment with this statement we hear different you countries represented opposing this action and referring to it as regrettable let's take a listen to some of what's been said we regret the withdrawal announcement by the u.s. we see this treaty is a very important instrument of arms control and one that serves European interests and therefore German interests as well it has also become clear this weekend that NATO will have to address the issue thoroughly including at the upcoming meeting next week Germany will actively contribute to the discussion because we stand in favor of the preservation of this treaty and we stand for a work in design in mechanism in Europe that is our goal we hope the USA will avoid withdrawing believe that the US and Russia need to remain engaged in constructive dialogue to preserve the treaty and to ensure that it's it to ensure its full and verifiable implementation which of course is crucial for Europe's and global security so the fact that a thirty-year-old treaty is now in question a treaty that was key and ending the Cold War and the nuclear arms race this points to a rising level of tension between the United States and Russia dar√≠o revolta a former Italian MP and international relations analyst says Trump won't listen to Europe as he's looking to his own country's midterm elections all the voice are agreeing all of them are on the same way the fact is that mr. Trump looks to be less attentive to what European are thinking about and so I'm not so sure that European a voice or the voice of the different European countries can convince him to to get back we have to add one another thing that most probably the real reason for which Trump made that statement is due to the midterm elections that he are going he is going to have in beginning November and I think that more than a for international reason it was at you two internal reasons that the decision the decision of Americans arrived you
