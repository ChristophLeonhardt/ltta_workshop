well it looks like we might finally be getting to the end of the the Cavanaugh saga the FBI report is done will we ever see it seems not but but we do know that Democrats and Christine Ford's attorneys have already complained that it was it's it's unfair the investigation was unfair yadda yadda yadda they're saying that it's not a legitimate and this is a huge shock by the way no one saw this coming I mean we all thought that they would certainly accept the results right that's what we all thought what one complain like a really stupid complaint is well the FBI didn't interview Christine Ford or Brett Kavanaugh well they we've already heard from them they've given their side of the story in lengthy interviews in front of the Senate so all the FBI would do is just ask them the same exact questions again which actually a you know Ford's attorney should be happy that that that she wasn't interviewed because she's the one with the constantly changing story so she may not hold up well under FBI interrogation but they did interview all the alleged witnesses and everything so that there's no point in them in them hearing yet again the same story from Cavanaugh and Ford instead okay let they're gonna go and listen to the alleged witnesses let's get their stories but they don't like that so I so I think we can ascertain from that that the investigation didn't uncover anything and didn't corroborate Ford's accounts in fact if it uncovered anything it just further uncovered the fact that Christine Ford is lying and I just want to underscore that point quickly I wrote about this yesterday and you know I was among those in the early going who I wanted to be gentle with Christine Ford and I wanted to be generous to her give her the benefit of the doubt as much as possible and that doesn't mean taking her story at face value I never did that you know smart person you never should have done that because there were always holes in the story and so on and so forth but I thought okay maybe and I said this multiple times you know I I said maybe she was maybe she's mistaken maybe she's missed remembering even as the inconsistencies piled up I said like many supporters of Brett Kavanaugh and like Brett Kavanaugh himself I mean he said this himself on multiple occasions that maybe something bad did happen to her and she's just conflating she's she's misconstruing accidentally conflating one thing with another injecting Brett Kavanaugh into it accidentally maybe that's that's what I thought that's that's what I mean by giving her the benefit of the doubt but I think now now that we've seen all this play out and we've seen the evidence or lack thereof or really we've seen the evidence which all comes down in Cavanaugh's favor I think we have to stop being so gentle about it and say what is now very difficult to avoid what I think is a plain reality which is that Christine Ford is a liar she may still have been victimized at some point in some form at some point in her life and and if if that's the case then I feel badly for her for that abuse if she ever did suffer it at some point but it's just not possible anymore for someone for a rational person to say to theorize that this may all be a case of mistaken identity somebody somebody is a liar here somebody is they straight-up liar and to me it seems very clear that that person is Christine Ford
