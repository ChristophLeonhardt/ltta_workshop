from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> streets of YouTube and made it</font>

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,170
I love super crew guys especially mitch

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,560

Twitter watching the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grammys I was in my</font>

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,409
mother's living room all by myself

35
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,790
because my mother did not mistake but

watching with me laughter<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi and I just</font>

37

<font color="#CCCCCC">had someone might whatever I feel it was</font>

38
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,400
appropriate to throw shade at things

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,020
just because there was not your musical

40
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,810
preference so as we all understand the

41
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">Grammys is the night of music and music</font>

42
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,740
spans the world and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us don't</font>

43
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,140
listen to everything as we still like to

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,369
claim when people ask us what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

45
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,290
listen to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> must listen to everything</font>

46
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,210
but country like the favorite black

47
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,700
person responds and it's not true you'd

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,229
like to listen to music by black people

49
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,610
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> own it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we all do it</font>

00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,370
white guys don't run with their names I

53
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,110

54
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,970

<font color="#E5E5E5">she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was cute we all thought she was a</font>

kinda showed up in a quinceanera dress

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,730
that is proving that her cult of brand

110
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,380
is strong because there's so many of the

111
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,010
other two really

112
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">find a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think that that dress</font>

113
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:08,480
is cute it was not blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I be like they</font>

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,799
which is understandable because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Blue Ivy</font>

115
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,430
is like four or three machinery over

116
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,769
where she had toddler either way she

117
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,418
young enough where it makes sense and

118
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,209
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> she had dr on because Rihanna</font>

119
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,500
put up an Instagram picture and

120
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,780
captioned it that blue thought her dress

121
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,240
was pretty and was very well aware the

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,130
fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she IDR on and had no problem</font>

123

00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,940
her very limited singing range and so it

setup for something amazing and what

160
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
we're left is with something to be more

178
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,960
you know one of my biggest issues with a

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,620
lot of the campaigning and protests that

180
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,420
have been going on and what I've been

181
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">made very well aware of in 2014 is the</font>

182
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,490
lack of place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I really have in</font>

183
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,580
society as a black woman and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

184
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Obama spoke about black most</font>

185
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,080
specifically but for the forum to stand

186
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,320
up for women at all especially when

187
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,540
women are so often pushed aside in our

188
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,450
issues are so often told that they don't

189
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold water and then whether these men</font>

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,770

191
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,740
of men are minute large go to such great

192
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,430
lengths are not even men sometimes it is

193
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,600
our own sisters or other women who kind

194
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,300
of pushed back against women's issues in

195
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,760
domestic ish domestic abuse is one of

196
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,200
those issues that I did see a lot of

197
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,170
pushback and a lot of victim shaming and

198
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,680
so for Obama to get up and appear at the

199
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">grammy's and speak for domestic violence</font>

200
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,990
is a very big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal maybe Perry claiming</font>

201
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,670
another one for us even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I guess</font>

effort that misguided effort that

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,260
Pharrell put it in how did I forget

260
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,110
Pharrell Ferrell and his bellhop outfit

261
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,960
and his sub toll way of talking about

262
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,280
the black lives it matter campaign with

263
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,020
his backup dancers performing in black

264
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,740
hoodies I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess an e for effort</font>

265
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,470
ral but then prints came out and showed

266
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,800
you up with one simple sentence and so

267
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,620
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he did his job for me and Beck</font>

268

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,540
even princess face was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm you know</font>

270
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,910
kanye played a cute little joke and so

271
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,210
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> did that interview after and i</font>

272
00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:01,630
listened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the back album I I do not</font>

274
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,510
back since I was in like seventh grade I

275
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,030
do think beyonce deserve this out of the

276
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,750
year award in all matters via production

277
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,589
lyrical content reception just you know

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,880
unknown out well done album front back

279
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,610
side to side in that cattle what I've

280
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,500
always liked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kanye is the fact</font>

281
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,870
that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very human and he's human in</font>

282
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,030
holding in his contradictions I think

283
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,770
you know part of being human is that we

284
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,800
do contradict ourselves meunier lived so

285
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,510
close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that line for so long and</font>

286
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,339
that's what I loved him for him about it

287
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that he was a very thoughtful artist</font>

288
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,930
you know I did briefly work at good

289
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,790
music which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> west label I have</font>

290
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,380
interacted with him he's a very nice

291
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,770
person in real life and you know when it

292
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes with him and his artistry it the</font>

293
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,900
way he's able to explain why he does

294
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,750
things and why you know he put started

295
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,550
you know how we construct his music or

296
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,020
why he's so passionate about certain

297
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,880
things in that credit hole and

298
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,550
graduation era that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is the kanye</font>

299
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,410
that I loved and that's really why I've

300
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,540
been such a big fan of Kanye now this

301
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,550
more recent manifestation of him posts

302
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,080
his mother passing away

303
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,670
he contradicts himself currently I have

304
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,340
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard time on like finding</font>

305
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,230
appreciation and then I know there's all

306
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,120
those people that say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh kind of saying</font>

307
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we don't think or cuttings for real</font>

308
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,600
artistry but it's on the onus of the

309
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">artist to give up their award and</font>

310
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,440
correct the wrongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Academy like</font>

365
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,680
strategic in kind of pushing her are

366
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,930
truly exploiting the full breast of her

367
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,610
talent and where she can go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

368
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,350
industry what it appears to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be is that</font>

369
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">Beyonce approached John Legend and</font>

370
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,440
common about opening for them and it

371
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,940
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even sound like there was any</font>

372
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,209
plans for lettuce he to perform it now

373
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,860
that everyone's talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and</font>

374
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,390
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this controversy around it</font>

375
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,190
her team will act on this opportunity

376
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,470
that has been open because as much as we

377
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,899
want to shade Beyonce before performing

378
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:09,519
the song I think this definitely opened

379
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,620
a very big door for let<font color="#CCCCCC"> us see it has</font>

380
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,450
her<font color="#CCCCCC"> name in a lot of people's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mouths and</font>

381
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,180
I hope you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely have more</font>

382
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,800
award shows throughout this year whether

383
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,779
it's the beachy whether it is black

384
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:21,720
girls rock whether it is some other

385
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">award show that happens later in the</font>

386
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,450
year that somebody takes this

387
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,790
opportunity I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anyone was</font>

388
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,380
really thinking that lettuce his role as

389
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,970
Mahalia Jackson was that big of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deal</font>

390
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,470
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was literally like one scene</font>

391
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,440
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie but let us see other when</font>

392
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,910
she covers other people's songs

especially songs from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> era very</font>

394
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,570
heavy deep soulful salt she just grow

its it had a life

396
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,090
something in her soul that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

397
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,500
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't feel like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

398
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,660
convey I personally do not care for

399
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Beyonce singing gospel religious or even</font>

400
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,670
like holiday songs and I'm very

401
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,920
controlled and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think she allows</font>

402
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,290
us out the imperfections or those

403
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,090
moments of imperfection that really kind

404
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of convey a true spirit and soul in the</font>

405
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,180
song that Ledisi could have done in

406
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,070
performing and I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> she went and</font>

407
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,660
watched the movie she was touched by the

408
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,470
movie and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her way of</font>

409
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,970
showing how touched she was by the movie

410
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,330
was performing this song and you know

411
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,100
that's has that that's as far as her

412
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,450
train of thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on this you</font>

413
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,350
know when she<font color="#CCCCCC"> believes the</font>

behind-the-scenes video the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grammys I did kind of take issue</font>

416
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,810
with that it is disheartening to hear

417
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,110
her talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing precious flora take</font>

418
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,330
my hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mahalia Jackson song a woman who</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very pivotal in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> civil rights</font>

420
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,420
movement and who doesn't often get the

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">credit dude and then take that song that</font>

422
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes from such a strong heritage and</font>

423
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">make it so singularly focused on the</font>

424
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,440
vulnerability of black men because black

425
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,420
men are what you know black men

426
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,610
essentially are the focus of black lives

427
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,860
matter and I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> very sensitive to us</font>

428
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,900
making this discussion simply about

429
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,660
black men I feel like for all kind of

430
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,020
beyonce has done and said without saying

431
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,329
about feminism she should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

432
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,859
bit more cognizant that black lives

433
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,959
matter are black lives of men and<font color="#E5E5E5"> women</font>

434
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that black women have faced similar</font>

435
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,199
struggles against powers that be as

436
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,569
black men our stories are often not as

437
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,240
told or push forward to media I just

438
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,449

440
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,800
