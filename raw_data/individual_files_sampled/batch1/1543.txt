hello on haslam seeker this is counting a cost on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics despite warmer relations with North Korea US president Donald Trump continues to threaten international trade sighs brexit countdown why businesses are warning that parts of UK manufacturing risk becoming extinct plus the growth of the video game industry it's outpacing music and cinema in the money race so US President Donald Trump's relationship with North Korea's Kim jong-un seems to be all smiles but his trade ties with Western allies and China are unraveling the u.s. slapped a 25 percent tariff on imports of steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminium on the European Union Canada and Mexico earlier this month not surprisingly they plan to respond with their own tariffs on US goods and it was reported on Friday that Trump has approved tariffs on 50 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports the decision could spark a trade war between the world's two biggest economies flourish Louis has that ultimately the US wants to reduce its trade deficit with China and it wants to give American companies greater access to the Chinese market the two countries have been holding talks to avoid a possible trade war and after three rounds of talks the Chinese have agreed to increase their purchases of farm and energy products from us by as much as 70 billion dollars but if these tariffs go ahead that deal will be void and China has threatened to further action banks had you tambien de if the United States takes unilateral protectionist measures harming China's interests we will quickly react and take necessary steps to resolutely protect our fair legitimate rights if the tariffs are imposed they could complicate the relationship between China and the US at a time when the US needs China's help in enforcing UN sanctions on North Korea the Tromp administration believes it was these tougher sanctions that played a part in forcing North Korea to the negotiation table but some analysts also say because the talks between North Korea and the US were a success then Trump now has a little bit more leeway to be tougher on China with regards to trade because China is not going to want to derail the process for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula because that is consistent with China's own security interests for joining us now from London to talk more about this is Andrew Cunningham chief global economists at Capital Economics thanks very much for being with us so first off what are the implications then of what is looking right now like a major trade rift between the u.s. and Canada well the implications for Canada itself were potentially fairly large and in Canada exports a lot of Steel to the United States and it's in one of the key members of NAFTA and if the United States walks away from NAFTA as well as imposing the steel tariffs we could see a slightly weaker growth in Canada perhaps by about half a percent of GDP over the next a couple of years so it's a negative not perhaps a huge one but certainly a negative well what are the chances then that the u.s. under Trump could actually walk away from NAFTA I mean there are questions in the US about whether he actually has the authority to do that by himself but putting that aside given that given the current state of of relations is is that a real possibility well it did look rather unlikely a few weeks ago because the two sides seemed to be reaching an agreement on the most controversial issue which is about cars and the local content in the car exports so we thought an agreement might just be reached but it's now looking less likely again and we have elections coming up in Mexico which could result in a more populist president there who would be less likely to reach an agreement with the US so I think it is a possibility I mean it's very hard obviously to read president Trump's mind but it's a possibility but not perhaps the most likely scenario I think more likely we see in negotiations dragged on and then along with all of this we see China stepping into the breach more it seems when it comes to the issue of free trade with their whole 1/1 belt initiative what do you make of that because that's something that would would have been unthinkable just a few years ago I think the china-us situation is potentially more damaging for the world economy and we could well see Trump or the US administration impose significant tariffs on China in the in in the next few days even there those suggestions that could affect maybe up to 150 billion dollars worth of Chinese exports to the United States and and certainly that would have a negative impact both on the Chinese economy and also on business confidence more more generally I think the provided that the measures don't go much wider than what has been threatened so far these will remain issues for particular industries and for particular countries rather than something that threatens the overall situation of the global economy which actually is still looking quite good and it would seem as well that the the much-heralded Trump Kim summit in Singapore is already reaping benefits for China what's your view on that well I think it's very early to jump to that conclusion the markets barely reacted to the summit which was interesting but then of course they barely reacted a year ago when Trump was threatening North Korea with fire and fury so I think the markets are right they think that we need to wait and see and that there's a long way to go before we can be confident that the North Korean regime and Kim himself is willing to denuclearize it will be a very difficult thing for both sides to do does he have it right on tariffs no I think I mean I'm agree with the vast majority of economists that protectionism is very unlikely to be helpful the only way he could work out it could work out well I think is if other countries were to open up and there would be some kind of a trade deal for it with China being more willing to let investment into its banking sector and perhaps reduce tariffs on on car imports so that's the only potential positive outcome but it doesn't look like that's going to happen and the way that the Trump administration's going about things is very odd because they're putting the tariffs on a lot of their key allies as well as on their enemies in terms of the trade war and that's not going to help so be better if they were to work with Europe to put some pressure on China for example rather than creating a sort of atmosphere where it's everybody against the United States good to speak with you Andrew Ken Ham and thanks for being with us you're welcome all right still to come on counting the cost it's being dubbed the NAFTA world cup despite their frosty relations Canada Mexico and the USA will jointly host the event eight years from now but first some of the biggest names in media are teaming up to survive Time Warner owns News Channel CNN and HBO the maker of Game of Thrones and it's being taken over by US telecoms giant AT&T in an 85 billion dollar deal the two companies are joining forces to compete against tech rivals Netflix and Amazon u.s. cable giant Comcast owner of NBC Universal is looking to get bigger too with a merger of its own merger mania could mean more competition and better value for consumers John Hendren has more Comcast is offering 65 billion dollars for the movie and television assets of 21st Century Fox that outbids Disney which had previously offered 52 billion dollars at stake or the global television channels such as National Geographic satellite television networks Sky and Europe star in India and the Hulu streaming service which is number three after Amazon and Netflix why is this all happening now because a day earlier on Tuesday a US judge ruled that AT&T could go ahead with its 85 billion dollar bid for Time Warner the Trump administration had objected on antitrust grounds saying it was too much media in one set of hands but a judge overruled that saying it could go ahead that seems to have begun to set merger mania media companies want to go vertical they want to marry content with distribution that's a model created by Amazon and Netflix which started out doing distribution and then created their own content that's a model everybody is now competing with our anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International says Dubai must clean up its real estate sector after an investigation into dirty money the washington-based Center for Advanced Defense studies found money laundering by people it calls war profiteers and Tara financier is living under US sanctions it identified around 100 million dollars in what it says are suspicious purchases based on leaked data from the Emirati city the government-run Dubai media office hasn't commented on the report or with an expected revenue of nearly 140 billion dollars this year the world of video games is fast becoming one of the most popular forms of entertainment Rob Reynolds has more the e3 expo is always a kaleidoscope of color clamor and crowds eager to experience the newest in cutting-edge electronic entertainment this year everyone is talking about fortnight the massively popular multiplayer battle royale game I'm just madly in love with it all the dances and battle royale is my favorite mode if you're a parent you've probably seen your kids playing Fortnite non-stop if you are a millennial you're probably playing it right now I'd say I spend more time than I should yeah I probably spend a few hundred hours and the time I played it's hard to keep track game industry professionals say fortnight could be if you'll excuse the pun a game-changer right now it's hot like everyone wants to get in on the battle royale genre you know the last player standing genre I think like the the coolest thing about fortnight is the fact that it's cross-platform play you know so when you're playing on mobile you could be going up against someone who's on PC or console this year's e3 features plenty of the game industry's bread-and-butter bullets bombs and blood this is Ubisoft take on Homer's epic The Odyssey a new addition to its Assassin's Creed franchise forget the poetry bring on the gore it's kind of going back to the very gun heavy really like I saw some stuff that's just ultra violent but there are other games that reflect the times we live in there's an amazing game on mobile core bury me my love which is a it's the story of a Syrian refugee you play the Syrian refugee texting his wife how she travels across Europe video games don't get the artistic respect that recorded music and films do the gaming industry has already long surpassed the recorded music and the cinema industry in terms of revenue as a source of entertainment and huge new markets for electronic entertainment are opening up in China and the developing world ahead of Britain's top business lobby group says brexit could wipe out the country's car industry it is now almost two years since the UK voted to leave the European Union and many people remain unclear about the country's direction Laurence Lee visited Sunderland in northern England to meet some of them Sunderland is a place which demonstrates only two all the contradictions of brexit and Emes the UK is currently in this region is one of the poorest parts of northern Europe unhappy it voted to leave the European Union to try something else takes it he's run this business for nearly half a century selling parts of the region's manufacturing industry cities what's known as a hard a brexit er he shrugs off worries that leaving the European Union might endanger his business he wants the UK out completely and is fed up that the government he supports can't get the job done I won't pity stand no I won't know it's just a no for England stand off for the wrong people and you said again push around and they're just no they're just the doughnut they're not doing it do you think they're frightened what is it you think I honestly do or law or they see all the right things and then when it comes to doing hectic I note the fallen on the door no it just up the road nissan employs 7,000 people with tens of thousands more in the supply chain if the UK abandons European trade agreements all those jobs could be at risk Steve is the union representative of the workers its position is that if brexit happens it must be a soft one allowing the UK to trade freely with Europe otherwise the Union fears disaster looms it will be absolute devastation and I also think to conclude on that it would take decades to recover also so there's anything to replace those jobs if there was to go at this morning time nor there isn't the government talks all the time about brexit enabling a global Britain free to trade where it likes this company does that's already it makes tanks for water treatment plants and has plans to expand for the company boss brexit as a source of enormous instability and he wishes it would just go away I'm a strong supporter of the UK in general however I think the the unknown is the thing that were frightened of most and I don't think the government's doing the best it could to give us the information and communication on the next steps and what's likely to happen on an exit from the EU in microcosm this region tells the story of how a brexit has won the referendum but seem not to know what with their victory to mend this divided country as things stand there is no constituency in this country which is happy with the way brexit is being conducted not the hardliners who want to leave the European Union completely not the remainders who want to stay in and not those people in the middle happy to accept some sort of in out fudge but the one thing they would all agree on is that there seems to be an almost total lack of political leadership a sense of where on earth the country is going next it's worth recalling that the points of brexit was to allow the UK greater control of its destiny yet as of now nobody has any idea if brexit will happen whether it might improve all the things places like Sunderland lost or whether it will make a bad situation even worse well joining us now from Glasgow is Gregor Owen chief economist at the global Council thanks very much for being with us so it doesn't look like we're any closer at this point to knowing what brexit is going to look like the longer that goes on what sort of damage is it doing to the UK economy well I mean there's one very simple reason why we're not any closer to understanding what brexit is going to look like which is that the British government still hasn't made up its mind and there's no immediate sign of that being solved there are big divisions within the government the longer that that goes on the more likely we are to see firms investors begin to implement their contingency plans they'll they'll be planning on the basis of worst case scenario which might even be that there's no deals at all by the time yukia leaves the EU and certainly they'll be planning in the basis that there will be some disruption at the end of a transition periods so yes we are we are almost certainly beginning to enter the periods where investors and businesses are adjusting to the delays in the negotiation how does this complicated businesses in in the decisions that they have to make the longer this uncertainty goes on well if you are a manufacturing business that's operating in the UK but relies on supply chains that extends into the rest of the EU or exports into the EU market then certainly you will want to be sure that after brexit customs arrangements will allow you to keep operating in a smooth straight forwards basis if you're unsure about that then you need to begin to plan and make changes to the way in which you operate to take account of the worst possible scenario which might be that there are new customs controls and disruptions at the border and that's what many businesses are focused on just now and talk to us about the mood in in Scotland where you are a lot of frustration being felt by the government in London about the way they're handling things concerns particularly about the fisheries industry there yes fishing is a very sensitive political issue it always has been since the UK joins the EU it's one of those areas where Britain as a whole and especially Scotland gives more than it takes in the relationship with the EU so that there is strong support within much of the fishing industry for leaving the EU but look the the EU in this negotiation has a loss of leverage and it is very unlikely that the fishing industry is going to get what it wants from this negotiation the EU is going to insist that if if the UK has access to you markets then that you will have access to fishing rights around the whole of the UK all of this lack of clarity what what effect is this having well you know there are two different issues one is the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland's and the EU is insisting that there have to be guarantees in the withdrawal agreements that there will be no hard border the UK wants to do that in a way which doesn't create divisions between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that may well end up tying the UK into we use customs union for a period of time in Scotland there's a separate set of issues which is around devolved powers to the Scottish Parliament's the British government wants to take control over some of those powers so that when responsibilities are returned from Brussels they can set uky policy frameworks but the Scottish Parliament objects to the UK government doing that unilaterally at the moment we have a standoff which has been resolved for the time being by the UK government really pushing through the changes that it wants to happen so we have a constitutional crisis of sorts in Scotland good to speak with you Gregor Owen thanks very much for your time you're very welcome all right artificial intelligence is no longer the stuff of science fiction it is used now in smartphones cars and even children's toys exactly how businesses are harnessing its power has been on display at the world's largest AI summit in London Sonia Garro was there when we think of the world of artificial intelligence it's a world that ranges from the mind-blowing to the mundane but essentially it is part of our everyday lives with phones that we use to the vehicles that we drive and in London at this AI summit it is examining the practicalities that go towards making our world a little easier to function so how is AI being used here in this and it's motorbike in the bike show off immediately you can see the temperature in the engine you can see the gas level you can see the pressure here you have the battery if you're like me and you don't know where the engine is this can help you see the engine brain and do some small maintenance work like changing the battery for example remove the left side after unscrewing and and it literally shows you exactly how it shows you how to get to the battery that we need to remove the seat the city's gone terrific yeah it's really useful and imagine of mechanical shop with people having these sunglasses it would really make their life easier of course let's not forget very human need for companionship making a comeback the pet robot perhaps the perfect addition the busy techies lifestyle and finally you might have noticed the 2018 FIFA World Cup kicked off this week placing host Russia in the global spotlight over the next month organisers are predicting the windfall from the tournament could be as high as 30 billion dollars but ratings agency Moody's says Russia won't score that big they say the economic impact from hosting the event is likely to be limited and short-lived well the cost of hosting the World Cup eight years from now will be shared by three countries Canada the USA and Mexico will be looking to put their current trade spats behind them by 2026 Lee Wellings reports from Moscow Canada Mexico and USA have been selected by the FIFA Congress to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup the World Cup will return to the United States of America for the first time in 32 years its bid involving Mexico and Canada the United bid was the heavyweight candidate it was an emphatic and unsurprising triumph with 134 votes to 65 for the other contender Morocco the US were the big players in this all along they will host 60 games Mexico 10 and Canada 10 thank you for entrusting us with this privilege the privilege of hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2026 let us also salute our friends from Morocco at the end of the day we are all united in football that's the spirit of the World Cup snubbed in their 2022 bid losing out to Qatar the Stars and Stripes have blue large / FIFA it was the American investigators attorney general and the FBI who brought down Sepp Blatter's FIFA three years ago new FIFA same issues the politics of keeping America sweet and crucially making money the United bid promised billions of dollars more this host decision was a transparent vote for the first time which caused its own problems 203 national associations with their decision under political scrutiny President Trump had tweeted in April that it would be a shame if countries that we always support that's a lobby against the u.s. bid I'm not worried about anything at the least I'm worried about about the President of the United States or Mexico or Canada prime minister or anti calva I think the question was answers I don't think anyone tries to take over FIFA FIFA belongs to football and to the members of FIFA now the task for Trump and his administration will be to work closely with Mexico and Canada neighbors with whom relations have been distinctly strained in recent months over immigration and trade and that is our show for this week remember you can get in touch with us by tweeting me ATS has MC Kerr and use
