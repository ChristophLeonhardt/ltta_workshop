00:00:03,488 --> 00:00:04,021
.

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:04,922
MARK: HELLO, AMERICA.

3
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:05,889
I'M MARK LEVIN.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,991
THIS IS "LIFE, LIBERTY &

5
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:08,325
LEVIN."

6
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:09,993
WE HAVE TWO GREAT GUESTS.

7
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:11,562
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, HOW ARE YOU?

8
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:12,129
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.

9
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,465
MARK: JOE CONCHA, GOOD TO SEE

10
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:14,732
YOU.

11
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:15,499
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME WANT.

12
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,501
>> TO TALK ABOUT THE MEDIA

13
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:18,635
TODAY.

14
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:19,369
ESPECIALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

15
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,238
THE RECENT MEDIA AND EVENTS

16
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,140
THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE AND

17
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:25,476
HOW THE MEDIA HAS COVERED THEM,

18
00:00:25,477 --> 00:00:29,213
AND NO BETTER TIME TO TALK

19
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:31,148
ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION

20
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:32,416
THAN NOW.

21
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:33,350
THE MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER SAYS

22
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:35,953
THAT 90% OF THE NEWS COVERAGE

23
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:38,655
HAS BEEN NEGATIVE TOWARD

24
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,056
KAVANAUGH.

25
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:39,790
HONESTLY, I'M SURPRISED IT'S

26
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:40,657
THAT LOW.

27
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:43,160
IT LOOKS LIKE 99.9% TO ME.

28
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:44,461
YOU'VE BOTH WRITTEN ABOUT THIS.

29
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,630
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THIS,

30
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:46,997
MOLLIE?

31
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:48,132
>> I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A

32
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,500
TELLING COUPLE OF WEEKS AS WE

33
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:52,202
WATCHED THE MEDIA COVER A VERY

34
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:53,337
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE AND VERY

35
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:54,071
COMPLICATED ISSUE.

36
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:55,539
HAVE YOU ALLEGATIONS OF ASSAULT

37
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,174
AND YOU HAVE A MAN WHO'S

38
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:02,479
DENYING THEM AND THE MEDIA

39
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,213
COVERAGE, I DON'T THINK COULD

40
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:03,814
HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.

41
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:06,049
WHEN YOU SAW THE STANDARDS IN

42
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,518
STORIES, USUALLY AS A

43
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,552
JOURNALIST, HAVE YOU IDEAS WHAT

44
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:10,120
STANDARD MUST BE MET BEFORE YOU

45
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:11,155
PUBLISH A STORY.

46
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:14,024
I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF

47
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:15,192
PUBLICATIONS HAVE NOT HELD TO

48
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:18,929
THE NORMALLY HIGH STANDARDS,

49
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,965
PUBLISHING ALLEGATIONS AS

50
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,100
FARCICAL, RUNNING WITH STORIES

51
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,034
THAT THERE IS NO CORROBORATION

52
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:25,702
AND FORGETTING THIS IS A VERY

53
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:26,670
SERIOUS ISSUE.

54
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,405
THIS IS A REAL MAN ACCUSED OF

55
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:31,508
SOMETHING AND HAS NO EVIDENCE

56
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,110
TO SUPPORT THE ALLEGATION.

57
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:35,846
HAD HIS LIFE AND NAME AND HONOR

58
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,514
AND REPUTATION DRAGGED THROUGH

59
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:38,448
THE MUD.

60
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:39,817
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE

61
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:40,617
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION, IT'S

62
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,786
ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE

63
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:44,488
AND HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE ACCUSED

64
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,789
OF CRIMES.

65
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,990
MARK: SEEMS LIKE BASIC NORMS.

66
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:49,793
DUE PROCESS, YOU KNOW, THESE

67
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:50,360
THINGS THAT WESTERN

68
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,128
CIVILIZATION HAS CREATED OVER

69
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,397
THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

70
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:53,864
YEARS.

71
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:57,801
DUE PROCESS, PRESUMPTION OF

72
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:59,136
INNOCENCE, EVIDENCE, A STANDARD

73
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:00,437
OF PROOF.

74
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:02,272
ALL THESE THINGS WENT OUT OF

75
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:02,606
WINDOW.

76
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:04,007
DID THEY NOT, JOE?

77
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:04,942
>> BRETT KAVANAUGH, BY MANY IN

78
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,144
THE MEDIA WAS DEEMED GUILTY

79
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:08,879
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.

80
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,747
YOU BROUGHT UP THE MEDIA

81
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:11,782
RESEARCH CENTER.

82
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,851
344 MINUTES DEDICATED TO

83
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,219
ACCUSER'S ACCUSATIONS OF

84
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,586
KAVANAUGH.

85
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:17,087
21 MINUTES TO KAVANAUGH'S

86
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:17,421
DENIALS.

87
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:20,090
I BELIEVE THAT'S MORE IN THE

88
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,658
15-1 RATIO AND I COMPARE IT TO

89
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,228
THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS,

90
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,029
EVERYTHING WENT OFF THE CLIFF

91
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,430
FINANCIALLY.

92
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,297
FOR OUR MEDIA EVERYTHING WENT

93
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:28,498
OFF THE CLIFF.

94
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,200
PEOPLE WERE HOLDING OUT HOPE

95
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:32,002
BECAUSE THIS IS A SUPREME COURT

96
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,637
NOMINEE AND THE HEARING THAT AS

97
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:37,741
I GO AROUND, SOME SEMBLANCE OF

98
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:40,377
BALANCE, AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN

99
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:40,777
HERE.

100
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:42,246
I'LL GIVE YOU SEE STORIES.

101
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,982
USA TODAY, A SPORTS COLUMNIST

102
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:46,416
WRITES AN OP-ED SAYING BRETT

103
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,018
KAVANAUGH SHOULD NO LONGER BE

104
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,152
AROUND YOUNG GIRLS AND COACH

105
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:51,488
HIS DAUGHTER'S BASKETBALL TEAM

106
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:52,990
BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE'S SHOWN

107
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:54,558
TO ACT AROUND YOUNG GIRLS.

108
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,159
IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S NOW A

109
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,261
PEDOPHILE.

110
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:59,162
THEY HAD TO RETRACT PART OF

111
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:00,230
THAT STORY.

112
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:05,702
NBC NEWS PUTS JULIE SWETNICK

113
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:07,671
REPRESENTED BY MICHAEL

114
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:08,972
KARDASHIANI -- I'M SORRY,

115
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:11,174
MICHAEL AVENATTI, TO MAKE THE

116
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:13,410
CLAIMS AGAINST KAVANAUGH

117
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:14,678
ACCUSING HIM OF GANG RAPE.

118
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,146
AND APPARENTLY, SHE HAS THREE

119
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:17,648
YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND

120
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:19,917
WENT BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL

121
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:21,351
PARTIES, WHICH IN MY DAY, IF

122
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:22,886
ANYBODY FROM COLLEGE CAME BACK

123
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:25,122
TO A HIGH SCHOOL PARTY ONE YEAR

124
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,156
OUT, THAT WAS WEIRD.

125
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:27,724
TWO YEARS OUT, THREE YEARS OUT,

126
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,693
YOU ARE PROBABLY CALLING THE

127
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:30,060
POLICE.

128
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,328
AND BY THE WAY, THERE IS GANG

129
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,129
RAPES GOING ON.

130
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,598
WHY ARE YOU GOING BACK THERE?

131
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,200
NBC SAYS AS A DISCLAIMER, WE

132
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:38,368
CANNOT CORROBORATE ANYTHING

133
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,203
THAT SWETNICK IS SAYING.

134
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:41,538
INSTEAD OF KILLING THE

135
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,706
INTERVIEW, WHICH DO YOU IN

136
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:43,874
THOSE SITUATIONS, THEY WANT TO

137
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,609
BE FIRST INSTEAD OF ACCURATE

138
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,044
AND GIVE HER A NATIONAL STAGE

139
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:47,377
ANYWAY.

140
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:50,614
NUMBER THREE, "NEW YORK TIMES"

141
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:50,981
STORY.

142
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:51,949
BRETT KAVANAUGH THREW ICE

143
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,450
DURING AN ALTERCATION AT YALE

144
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:57,454
IN 1985 IN A BAR.

145
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:59,456
NO CHARGES WERE ACTUALLY

146
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:00,791
LEVELED IN THIS SITUATION, BUT

147
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,225
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" GOES AHEAD

148
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:03,927
WITH IT ANYWAY, AND BY THE WAY,

149
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,863
ONE OF THE CO WRITERS OF THE

150
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,632
STORY IS AN ANTI-KAVANAUGH

151
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:09,733
CRITIC, IF YOU LOOK AT HER

152
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,802
TWITTER FEED, THE PAPER HAS TO

153
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,804
RETRACT, NOT THE STORY, ADMIT

154
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:16,173
THEY MADE A MISTAKE AND SAID

155
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,540
LITERALLY SHE IS NOT A NEWS

156
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,741
REPORTER, SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

157
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:19,810
ASSIGNED TO IT.

158
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,277
HOW THE HELL DID SHE GET THERE?

159
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,746
YOU LOOK AT THE THREE EXAMPLE

160
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:25,282
US AND SAY TO YOURSELF, MY

161
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:27,050
GOODNESS, OUR MEDIA IS BROKEN,

162
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:29,886
AND MANY, MANY PEOPLE IN THIS

163
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,556
COUNTRY WILL NEVER, EVER TRUST

164
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:33,557
IT AGAIN.

165
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:35,125
MARK: MOLLIE, DO YOU THINK THIS

166
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:37,294
WAS A WATERSHED?

167
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:38,862
DOWNING THE MEDIA HAVE EXPOSED

168
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:42,666
THEMSELVES IN THE AGGREGATE AS

169
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,468
UTTERLY IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN.

170
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:45,569
DO THE MEDIA LEAD THE DEMOCRATS

171
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,170
OR THE DEMOCRATS LEAD THE

172
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:47,504
MEDIA?

173
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:53,310
>> USED TO SEEM THE DEMOCRATS

174
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,045
WERE THE HEAD OF THE PARTY,

175
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:55,879
DIRECTING WHAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD

176
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,546
BE DOING.

177
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,348
THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM

178
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,183
BECAUSE THE MEDIA SHOULD BE AT

179
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:01,485
LEAST TRYING TO ATTAIN SOME

180
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:02,953
STANDARD OF OBJECTIVITY.

181
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,789
AND I THINK THE MEDIA HAS HAD A

182
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,691
LOT OF BENEFIT BASED ON THIS

183
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:08,825
VIEW THAT THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE

184
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:11,161
WHO ARE TRYING TO REPORT THE

185
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:11,962
FACTS.

186
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:14,364
WE'VE GIVEN THEM A LOT OF

187
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:15,966
CREDIBILITY AND HONOR AND, YES,

188
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,367
THIS IS A WATERSHED MOMENT IN

189
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,169
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

190
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,138
APPALLED BY WHAT THEY'VE SEEN.

191
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,305
WE HAD THREE REALLY GOOD

192
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,474
EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS SO BAD.

193
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,610
BUT, IN FACT THE LAST FEW

194
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:27,677
DECADES HAVE BEEN -- INCLUDING

195
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:30,213
A LOT OF THESE MOMENTS.

196
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:31,148
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE TRUMP

197
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:32,816
VICTORY WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE

198
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,584
ABOUT WHY THEY VOTED FOR TRUMP?

199
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,819
A LOT OF PEOPLE MENTIONED THEY

200
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,255
WERE SO FRUSTRATED WITH THE

201
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:39,890
MEDIA COVERAGE.

202
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:41,391
IN APOLITICAL COVERAGE, PEOPLE

203
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:43,160
ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE WAY THE

204
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:44,227
MEDIA COVER A NATURAL DISASTER

205
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:46,263
OR CELEBRITY OR NUMBER OF

206
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:46,596
THINGS.

207
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,198
YES, THIS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT

208
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,032
MOMENT.

209
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,100
PEOPLE COULD NOT -- PEOPLE

210
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:51,802
COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING OTHER

211
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,703
THAN HOW BIASED EVERYBODY WAS

212
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:55,172
BEING, BUT IT'S JUST ACTUALLY

213
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:56,540
THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF

214
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:56,907
PROBLEMS.

215
00:05:56,908 --> 00:06:00,210
MARK: YOU KNOW, JOE, EVEN TED

216
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:02,412
TURNER, THE FOUNDER OF CNN AND

217
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:03,947
TED KOPPEL, THE OTHER DAY, HE

218
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,850
WAS ON A PANEL, THEY WERE

219
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:08,085
CRITICAL OF CNN.

220
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:08,718
TOO POLITICAL.

221
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,686
WHAT WOULD CNN DO?

222
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:12,489
WHAT WOULD THE RATINGS BE IF

223
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,156
DONALD TRUMP WASN'T AROUND?

224
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:14,891
>> KOPPEL SAID THEY WOULD BE IN

225
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:15,325
THE TOILET.

226
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:16,960
MARK: IN THE TOILET.

227
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,261
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THIS, WHAT

228
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:19,763
REALLY IS CNN AT THIS POINT?

229
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:22,466
IS IT A NEWS ORGANIZATION?

230
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:23,133
OPINION ORGANIZATION?

231
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:23,867
IS IT BOTH?

232
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:25,202
IS IT NEITHER?

233
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:26,103
WHAT IS IT?

234
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:28,371
>> I'LL LET JEFF GREENFIELD WHO

235
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,707
IS WITH CNN, ABC, CBS, HE'S

236
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,843
BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR

237
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:36,113
DECADES, PRETTY WELL RESPECTED.

238
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:38,582
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD BRIAN ON

239
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,549
RELIABLE SOURCES LAST SUNDAY.

240
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,785
WHEN I LOOK AT CNN, HOUR AFTER

241
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,186
HOUR AFTER HOUR I SEE PANELS

242
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,287
RATHER THAN REPORTING,

243
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:45,088
EXCHANGING OPINIONS.

244
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,957
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

245
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,925
WHICH ON THIS NETWORK I REGARD

246
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:52,129
AS QUITE CRITICAL OR HOSTILE TO

247
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,462
TRUMP.

248
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:53,263
THIS IS A GUEST IN THE FORMER

249
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:55,799
EMPLOYEE OF THE NETWORK TELLING

250
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,834
A CNN ANCHOR THIS IS WHO YOU

251
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:58,435
ARE NOW.

252
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,337
>> BUT I ACTUALLY THINK --.

253
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,239
>> AS YOU SAID TED TURNER AND

254
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,907
KOPPEL AS WELL CRITICIZED THE

255
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:05,609
NETWORK ALL IN ONE WEEK.

256
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,910
YOU'RE NOT JUST NOTICING THAT.

257
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,111
AND WE'VE SEEN IT FOR A WHILE,

258
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:11,148
I USED TO GO ON THE NETWORK

259
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,616
QUITE OFTEN.

260
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:14,251
IT'S A DIFFERENT NETWORK THAN

261
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:15,085
THREE YEARS AGO, DONALD TRUMP

262
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:17,220
CAME ONTO THE SCENE.

263
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,923
THEY USED TO FILM EMPTY PODIUMS

264
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,825
DURING THE CAMPAIGN INSTEAD OF

265
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,160
HILLARY CLINTON GIVING A SPEECH

266
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:23,894
BECAUSE HE RATED AND THOUGHT HE

267
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:25,295
WOULD NEVER WIN.

268
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:27,797
ONCE HE WON THEY'VE GONE

269
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:28,798
OVERWHELMINGLY ANTI-TRUMP AND

270
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,066
HARVARD CAME OUT WITH A STUDY,

271
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,802
THEY ARE 91% NEGATIVE TOWARDS

272
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:33,470
THE PRESIDENT.

273
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,172
HOW DO YOU SAY YOU'RE OBJECTIVE

274
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,506
WHEN NUMBERS LIKE THAT DON'T

275
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:36,973
SUPPORT IT.

276
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,808
>> IT'S WORSE THAN IF IT WERE

277
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:41,511
JUST OPINIONS, JUST PANELISTS

278
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,078
GIVING ANALYSIS.

279
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,813
IT'S THE NEWS REPORTING THAT IS

280
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:44,781
A SERIOUS PROBLEM, TOO.

281
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:46,383
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES YOU GAVE

282
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:47,884
WAS OF AN OPINION COLUMN BUT A

283
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,653
LOT OF WHAT WE SAW THAT WAS SO

284
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:53,089
BAD WITH THE KAVANAUGH STORY IS

285
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,958
DONE BY PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THEY

286
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,593
ARE STREET REPORTERS.

287
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:59,162
EXAMPLES FROM CNN, YOU HAVE THE

288
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:02,399
EX-BOYFRIEND OF THE INITIAL

289
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,667
ACCUSER AGAINST KAVANAUGH SAID

290
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:05,769
STUFF HE THOUGHT WAS WORTH

291
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,672
SHARING AND THE ACCUSER HAD

292
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:10,373
ONCE COACHED A FRIEND WHEN

293
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,142
LATER SHE TESTIFIED SHE DIDN'T

294
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:13,276
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT POLYGRAPHS

295
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,979
AND A VARIETY OF CLAIMS SHE WAS

296
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,479
MAKING.

297
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,714
THEY DIDN'T REPORT THAT.

298
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:20,150
THEY ONLY REPORTED WHEN SOMEONE

299
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:20,650
DENIED THE CLAIM.

300
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:24,387
>> THAT'S CALLED BIAS OF

301
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:24,788
OMISSION.

302
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,189
YOU CAN BE OUTWARDLY BIAS IF

303
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,025
YOU ARE AN ANCHOR AND CLEARLY

304
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,026
SUPPORTING ONE SIDE.

305
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:32,262
IF YOU WATCH CNN, YOU WOULDN'T

306
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,363
KNOW THAT HAPPENED.

307
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:35,165
ONE OTHER PROBLEM THAT THEY

308
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,633
HAVE IS THEY LABEL ANCHORS WHO

309
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:38,702
ARE NOT ANCHORS.

310
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:39,736
THEY ARE OPINION PEOPLE.

311
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,904
DON LEMON IS STILL CALLED AN

312
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:43,539
ANCHOR AT 10:00 TONIGHT.

313
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,775
CHRIS CUOMO AN ANCHOR AT NIGHT.

314
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,411
ANDERSON COOPER IS AN ANCHOR AT

315
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:48,712
8:00.

316
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,113
THEY ARE CLEARLY GIVING

317
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,514
OPINIONS, AND THAT CONFLATING

318
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:54,284
THE TWO THINGS BUILDS TO MORE

319
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:54,651
MISTRUST.

320
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:56,419
WHEN YOU ARE NOT LABELING

321
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,622
PEOPLE AS THEY SHOULD BE.

322
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,924
NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING AN

323
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,525
OPINION PERSON.

324
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,894
HANNITY, INGRAHAM, CARLSON.

325
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,730
MARK LEVIN, YOU ARE OPINION

326
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:07,063
PEOPLE.

327
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:08,164
EMBRACE IT.

328
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,833
STOP PRETENDING YOU ARE ANCHORS

329
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,167
WHEN YOU DON'T FIT THE LABEL,

330
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:12,469
ASKING QUESTIONS AND GETTING TO

331
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,069
THE FACTS.

332
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,938
MARK: LET ME ASK YOU THIS TOO,

333
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:15,305
THOUGH.

334
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,440
I WATCHED SOME OF THE COVERAGE,

335
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:18,208
A LOT OF THE COVERAGE, MOST OF

336
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,910
THE COVERAGE, OF THE KAVANAUGH

337
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:22,012
HEARINGS, AND I WAS VERY

338
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:24,714
UNIMPRESSED WITH MOST OF THE

339
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:26,383
ANALYSTS, QUOTE, UNQUOTE.

340
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,285
THEY WERE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF

341
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:30,487
RACHEL MITCHELL WHO WAS HIRED

342
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:34,424
BY THE REPUBLICANS, THE

343
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:37,093
MARICOPA COUNTY SEXUAL CRIMES

344
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:39,162
PROSECUTOR, INTERRUPTED BY THE

345
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:40,430
FIVE-MINUTE RULE WHICH WAS VERY

346
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,998
ANNOYING, BUT YOU COULD TELL,

347
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,500
THE AUDIENCE COULD TELL, SHE

348
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,901
WAS GOING THROUGH IT

349
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:47,170
METHODICALLY, POINTING OUT THE

350
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,371
CONTRADICTIONS, POINTING OUT

351
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,240
THE LACK OF CORROBORATION AND

352
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,142
SHE WAS TRASHED.

353
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:53,243
ALMOST UNIFORMLY.

354
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,244
THEY BRING IN PROFESSORS WHO

355
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,378
TRASHED HER, SOME OF THE

356
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,813
ANALYSTS ARE TRASHING HER.

357
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:57,981
I WENT ON THE RADIO AND SAID

358
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,149
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

359
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,184
SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY

360
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,352
LAYING OUT THE CASE AND SOME OF

361
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:04,020
THE PROBLEMS WITH DR. FORD.

362
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:04,888
DID YOU SEE THAT TOO?

363
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:06,756
>> YEAH, IT WAS VERY

364
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:07,590
FRUSTRATING TO WATCH BECAUSE IF

365
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,392
YOU ARE A CASUAL OBSERVER AND

366
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,161
SAW HER GOING THROUGH THE

367
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:12,462
QUESTIONS, WELL, PROFESSOR FORD

368
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,664
WAS ANSWERING AND REVEALING A

369
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:16,099
LOT OF INTERESTING INFORMATION,

370
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,201
SUCH AS THAT IT WAS FALSE SHE

371
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,936
WAS AFRAID TO FLIGHT.

372
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:22,439
SHE'S A GLOBAL FREQUENT FLYER,

373
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,541
AND YET IN PREVIOUS WEEKS WE

374
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,543
HEARD SHE COULDN'T FLY OUT TO

375
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:29,446
THE HEARING BECAUSE SHE HAD A

376
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,615
DEATHLY FEAR OF FLYING.

377
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:33,983
BRINGING OUT INCONSISTENCIES

378
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:35,185
THAT FLOODED THE ZONE OF THE

379
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:37,287
MEDIA THAT YOU BEGIN TO THINK

380
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,122
THROUGH THIS MORE SERIOUSLY.

381
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:41,458
AND YET WHEN YOU SAW PEOPLE

382
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,625
ANALYZE MITCHELL'S QUESTIONING

383
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:46,529
AND PROFESSOR FORD AND EVEN

384
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,064
KAVANAUGH'S STATEMENTS,

385
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:48,865
EVERYBODY RESPONDED SO

386
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:50,667
EMOTIONALLY RATHER THAN

387
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:51,034
LOGICALLY.

388
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,068
I UNDERSTAND EMOTION IS

389
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,404
IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

390
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:55,739
BUT SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF

391
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,107
REASON AND LOGIC AND PRINCIPLES

392
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:58,441
THAT WERE IN PLAY, TOO.

393
00:10:58,442 --> 00:10:59,676
YOU DON'T CONVICT SOMEONE IN

394
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:01,077
ANY COURT BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE

395
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,145
IT.

396
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:03,646
YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE.

397
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:04,748
NOBODY POINTED OUT GOING INTO

398
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,483
THE HEARING LAST WEEK, THERE

399
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:08,184
WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE

400
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:08,585
ALLEGATIONS.

401
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,120
COMING OUT OF THE HEARING,

402
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:10,954
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO

403
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:11,721
SUPPORT THE ALLEGATIONS.

404
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:14,424
THAT WAS NOT A MAJOR THEME.

405
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,192
ANALYSIS, AND IT SHOULD HAVE

406
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,026
BEEN.

407
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:18,561
I DON'T REALLY CARE, SOME

408
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:19,262
PEOPLE MIGHT FIND PROFESSOR

409
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:19,729
FORD CREDIBLE.

410
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,398
A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NOT.

411
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,233
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD PROBLEMS

412
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,402
WITH THE TESTIMONY AND IT HAD A

413
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:26,503
LOT OF GAPS THAT DIDN'T MAKE

414
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:26,803
SENSE.

415
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,138
I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING

416
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,606
THROUGH IN THE NEWS COVERAGE OR

417
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,441
IN THE ANALYSIS EITHER.

418
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:32,842
THERE'S NO REASON THERE

419
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:33,843
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A STRAIGHT

420
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:36,713
NEWS STORY LAYING OUT THE FLAWS

421
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:37,580
AND INCONSISTENCIES WITH

422
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:37,947
TESTIMONY.

423
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,650
>> PEOPLE WANTED A FEW GOOD MEN

424
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:42,952
AND COLONEL JESSOP AND JACK

425
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,654
NICHOLSON AND TOM CRUISE AND

426
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:46,656
CRUISE WONDERING, DID YOU ORDER

427
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:47,857
THE CODE RED?

428
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:49,459
AND OBVIOUSLY NICHOLSON SAYS

429
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,461
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DID.

430
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,629
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED OUT OF

431
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,597
THE PROSECUTOR OR JOHNNIE

432
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:55,698
COCHRAN IN THE O.J. HEARINGS,

433
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,968
IF IT DOESN'T FIT, YOU MUST

434
00:11:58,969 --> 00:11:59,302
ACQUIT.

435
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,670
SOMETHING THAT RHYMES, IF IT'S

436
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,505
METHODICAL AND FACT BASED THAT

437
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:06,543
DOESN'T PLAY WELL IN CABLE FUSE

438
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:07,110
FOR PUNDITS.

439
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:08,311
THEY WANT DRAMA.

440
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,747
MARK: LET ME FOLLOW UP, YOU ARE

441
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:11,648
MAKING AN IMPORTANT POINT.

442
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:12,982
IS THE AUDIENCE SMARTER THAN

443
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,083
THE PEOPLE MAKE THE

444
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,018
PRESENTATIONS IN THE MEDIA?

445
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,553
>> ABSOLUTELY.

446
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:18,288
BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION, THE

447
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:19,556
HILL DOES AN ANALYSIS OF ALL

448
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,624
THE MAJOR NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE

449
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,494
COUNTRY AND THEIR ENDORSEMENTS.

450
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,396
AND WE NARROWED IT DOWN TO 59

451
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:33,102
PAPERS BASED ON, I BELIEVE, SU

452
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:35,138
SUBSCRIPTION LEVELS.

453
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,441
59 ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON, 12

454
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:39,075
ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP.

455
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,443
THAT GOT HER A CONCESSION

456
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:40,777
SPEECH.

457
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,212
WE COULD DO OUR THINKING ON OUR

458
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,246
OWN, THANK YOU.

459
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:46,583
I GO BACK TO THAT STAT AS THE

460
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,184
INFLUENCE OF THE MEDIA IS

461
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,253
ONE-TENTH OF WHAT IT USED TO BE

462
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:51,955
GOING BACK IN ANOTHER TIME I

463
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:52,355
WON'T NAME.

464
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:53,490
>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO

465
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:55,024
HAVE GOOD REPORTERS JUST

466
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,527
REPORTING THE FACTS BUT

467
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,162
ANALYSTS WHO ACTUALLY REPRESENT

468
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:01,331
THAT PORTION OF THE COUNTRY

469
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:02,098
ACTUALLY IGNORED OR DERIDED IN

470
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:03,733
THE MEDIA.

471
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,535
IF YOU ARE WATCHING THE MEDIA

472
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,770
WITH YOUR OWN EYES AND HEAR

473
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:08,505
PEOPLE MAKING ANALYSIS THAT

474
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,039
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND PEOPLE

475
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,407
FOCUSED ON EMOTION AND FOR

476
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:13,743
BEING FOCUSED ON EMOTION BEING

477
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:15,912
BIASED IN HOW THEY'RE FOCUSED

478
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:17,247
ON EMOTION BECAUSE BOTH

479
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:18,748
PROFESSOR FORD AND JUDGE

480
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:20,149
KAVANAUGH GAVE VERY EMOTIONAL

481
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,184
TESTIMONY BUT ONLY ONE SEEMED

482
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:23,286
TO GET THE BENEFIT FROM A LOT

483
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:25,355
OF ANALYSTS.

484
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:26,823
>> JOURNALISTS PRIMARILY LIVE

485
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:29,259
IN NEW YORK, WASHINGTON AND LOS

486
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,592
ANGELES.

487
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:32,762
>> YES.

488
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:35,665
>> AND DON'T REPRESENT THE

489
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,300
MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY.

490
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:40,403
BOB SCHAFER SAID ONE IN FIVE

491
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,170
JOURNALISTS, ONLY THREE CITIES,

492
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:43,706
AND 20% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK

493
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:45,875
IN THE BUSINESS LIVE IN THOSE

494
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:46,209
PLACES.

495
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,143
CALLED THE JOURNALISTIC

496
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,311
CORRIDOR THAT WE'RE ON

497
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:49,913
PARTICULARLY WITH NEW YORK AND

498
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:50,680
WASHINGTON, AND LIVING IN

499
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,582
BUBBLES OR ELITE TOWERS AND NOT

500
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,383
LISTENING TO PEOPLE.

501
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:55,919
WHEN I GO TO PARTIES, I WAS AT

502
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,054
A BLOCK PARTY AND THERE WAS A

503
00:13:58,055 --> 00:13:58,321
KEG.

504
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:00,523
MARK: DID YOU THROW ICE?

505
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:04,994
>> I DID THROW ICE.

506
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:10,133
I THREW A BAG FOR A GAME, AND I

507
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,868
GOT FEEDBACK THAT I WAS NOT

508
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,136
SEEING ON TELEVISION,

509
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:14,771
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT CAME TO

510
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:17,807
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD OR JULIE

511
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:21,511
SWETNICK OR ANYBODY ELSE

512
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:21,878
INVOLVED.

513
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,415
GO TO A BAR, MAYBE YOU WILL GET

514
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,316
ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE.

515
00:14:26,317 --> 00:00:00,000
MARK: ALMOST EVERY WEEK NIGHT
