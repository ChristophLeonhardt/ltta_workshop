00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,179
yesterday's video was a so long and beer

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:04,890
look so tired in it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,509
kind of blabbering on for a while but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

5
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,130
hope some of you enjoyed it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least I'm</font>

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,450

7
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">know why I suspect it's the horrible</font>

8
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,300
weather outside which meant that I

9
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,860
couldn't actually film what today's

10
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,839
challenge was I definitely need to get

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,340
myself one of this little camera

12
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,960
umbrella things are like an umbrella

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,670
poncho today's challenge was to take a

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,769
different route<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool from work uni</font>

15
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,180
school or wherever you're heading or

16
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,439
just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a walk somewhere you've</font>

17
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,119
never been if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got no routine</font>

18
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,220
place to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> today no just everything</font>

19
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,410
makeup explore take the scenic route and

20
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,090
enjoy the difference today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did have to</font>

21
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,770
go to university yeah I also did have to

22
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,180
go to the supermarket and in both cases

23
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,040
I didn't simply take a different route I

24
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,660
took a really long route because it was

25
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,670
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to be out and walk often</font>

26
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,170
at this time of<font color="#CCCCCC"> year it's really easy to</font>

27
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,460
tell yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just because it's</font>

28
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,930
freezing cold and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's raining and it's</font>

29
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,730
miserable outside that means you just

30
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,739
stay inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cooped up all day or in</font>

31
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,360
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> case that I go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> campus and either</font>

32
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,980
stay on campus for ages<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll just come</font>

33
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,539
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stay here for ages either way</font>

34
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,370
you'll stay in one place<font color="#E5E5E5"> I dunno about</font>

35
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,989
you there but every time I start being

36
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,090
acted the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm outside and started</font>

37
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,039
walking or running or doing something

38
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,719
it's amazing how quickly it makes you

39
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,799
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> better and makes you feel more</font>

40
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,659
energized so it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> was nice to have</font>

41
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,460
a very active challenge to be forced<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

42
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">get out and do some walking walking is a</font>

43
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,490
big thing for me as someone who's never

44
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">learnt to drive so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i walk pretty much</font>

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,460
everywhere i'm also not really that

46
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,259
bothered about walking by myself a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

47
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know don't really like</font>

48
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,900
spending time with themselves and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

49
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,880
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best person to spend</font>

50
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,159
time with myself but I do find sometimes

51
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,720
if I'm struggling with an essay with a

52
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,580
story or with just anything at all it is

53
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,320
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to have some time for a walk</font>

54
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,299
and to think and to meijer your ideas

55
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,710
the interesting thing about today's

56
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,820
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't so much</font>

57
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,770
about thinking in your head it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was more</font>

58
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,720
about noticing things outside mainly I

59
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,369
noticed a lot of rain only<font color="#E5E5E5"> love puddles</font>

60
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,110
and it's just some wandering cats I

61
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,790
noticed one guy waiting outside a house

62
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,290
in a car and I assumed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he was a spy</font>

63
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">all there is of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course the chance that</font>

64
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,200
he was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a speedboat</font>

65
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,000
salesmen I once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed how rarely</font>

66
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,990
people like to make eye contact

67
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,939
physically as well you tell which

68
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,799
streets were designed in a group so all

69
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,329
the houses matched and which ones were a

70
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,310
bit more jumbly and mixed up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

71
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,210
wonder whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had always been</font>

72
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">intended for that street to be doubly</font>

73
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">and mixed up or whether a series of</font>

74
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,759
unfortunate events have led<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that sort</font>

75
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,340
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> EE</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> street makeup but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was pretty</font>

76
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,899
much it really to be honest um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

77
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,550
familiar with most of the streets at

78
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,139
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so although I was going a</font>

79
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,849
different route<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a much longer route</font>

80
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,150
it wasn't in

81
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,829
I you unfamiliar to me so there were

82
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,780
bits I that I know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's nice to be</font>

83
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,299
able to know a city that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> London to</font>

84
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,970
Bob a city it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> small city so it's</font>

85
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,260
definitely nice that it feels familiar

86
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,549
today's challenge was the penultimate

87
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,079
challenge and the last challenge will be

88
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,000
up tomorrow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> before I go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write and</font>

89
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,799
post about how it's the 100th episode of

90
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">gossip girl</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tonight let's hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

91
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,980
don't mess this one up for Christmas my

92
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">brother-in-law gave me my sisters and my</font>

93
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,939
mother a voucher to get our feet eaten

94
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">by fish I know it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds very very odd</font>

95
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,870
and very weird and probably not very

96
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,879
safe but<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly I came away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from it</font>

97
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,620
thinking well I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to go and</font>

98
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,090
do that again the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> fascinating fact</font>

99
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,799
that I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from that whole fishy</font>

100
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,510
experience with apart from the fact that

101
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,359
my older sister is a massive worse yes

102
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:59,139
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do was it there's a</font>

103
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,780
commonality between rotten wood and your

104
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,939
feet or specifically the dead skin on

105
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">your feet basically a doctor or a</font>

106
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,060
scientist<font color="#E5E5E5"> of someone who was working to</font>

107
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,739
treat psoriasis figured this out of

108
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,480
commonality between the rotten wood and

109
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,250
the dead skin or skin in general it

110
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,780
became this commercial thing you sit

111
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,680
down you put your feet in the water

112
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,180
after they've been washed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything</font>

113
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly all the fish swarm towards</font>

114
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,540
your feet it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quite amazing I'm</font>

115
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,370
a really ticklish person so that fast

116
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,169
was like oh giggling like nothing else

117
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,760
for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes straight then</font>

118
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,019
eventually get used to it then

119
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:27,879
eventually it feels quite soothing and

120
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,010
nice then you come away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it with you</font>

121
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,579
know smooth skin so yeah that was quite

122
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,409
cool definitely wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

123
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,669
swimming pool<font color="#CCCCCC"> with those fish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

124
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,319
because they are a little bit scary

125
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,329
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow our last day of the new</font>

126
00:03:40,329 --> 00:00:00,000
year revolution guys bye
