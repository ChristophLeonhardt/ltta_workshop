1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,610


2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,980
We condemn in the strongest
possible terms this egregious

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,810
display of hatred bigotry
and violence on many sides,

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,530
on many sides.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:26,160


6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,890
I'm not putting anybody
on a moral plane.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,180
What I'm saying is this.

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,030
You had a group on one side, and
you had a group at the other,

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,767
and they came at each other
with clubs, and it was vicious,

10
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:35,600
and it was horrible.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,460


12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,700
My fellow Americans, this is
the 34th time I'll speak to you

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,340
from the Oval
Office and the last.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,940
I've spoken of the shining
city all my political life.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,300
But I don't know if I ever quite
communicated what I saw when I

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,780
said it.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,800
But in my mind it was
a tall, proud city,

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,420
built on rocks stronger than
oceans, windswept, god-blessed,

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,660
and teeming with people of
all kinds living in harmony

20
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,100
and peace, a city with three
ports that hummed with commerce

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,570
and creativity.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,380
And if there had to be city
walls, the walls had doors.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,380
And the doors were open
to anyone with the will

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,820
and the heart to get here.

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,180
And when someone has
recently endorsed Nazism,

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,830
it is inconceivable that such a
person can legitimately aspire

27
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,470
to leadership.

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,230
So I believe that David Duke
is an insincere charlatan.

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,520
I believe he's attempting
to hoodwink the voters

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,970
of Louisiana.

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,350
And I believe that he should
be rejected for what he is

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,430
and what he stands for.

33
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:57,132


34
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:59,590
I also want to speak tonight
directly to Muslims throughout

35
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,690
the world.

36
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,340
We respect your faith.

37
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,570
It's practiced freely by
many millions of Americans

38
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,060
and by millions more in
countries that America counts

39
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,270
as friends.

40
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,130
Its teachings are
good and peaceful.

41
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,970
And those who commit evil in
the name of Allah blaspheme

42
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,720
the name of Allah.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,610


44
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,500
Justice grows out
of recognition,

45
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,130
of ourselves in each other, then
my liberty depends on you being

46
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,400
free too, that--

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,500
that history can't be a sword
to justify injustice or a shield

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,864
against progress.

49
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:56,100
But It must be a manual for how
to avoid repeating the mistakes

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,500
of the past, how
to break the cycle,

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,350
a roadway toward a better world.

52
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:29,970
Amazing grace, how sweet the
sound that saved a wretch like

53
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,520
me.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:00:00,000
