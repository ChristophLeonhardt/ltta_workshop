the South African country of Zimbabwe is choosing a new president today it's for the first time since former leader Robert Mugabe was ousted here's a quick breakdown of why this election matters this election in Zimbabwe is a huge milestone for what's been a very troubled country with an even more troubling financial crisis and here's why it's the first time since 1980 the name of Robert Mugabe isn't featured on the ballots he was at the helm of the country for almost 40 years and it seemed nothing could price him away maccabe's departure from his presidential throne was as quick as it was unexpected the big coup unfolded after a fight for power between Mugabe's own wife and his right-hand man the first lady also known as Gucci Grace and the vice-president nick named as the crocodile and she accused the other of poisonings and death threats and it seemed Grace had won her way when the 93 year old husband sacked the vice president but suddenly the army stepped in taking control of the capital just as the Parliament was moving to impeach Robert Mugabe he quit to allow a smooth transfer and the crocodile finally got his teeth into running the country all right so let's look at whom Zimbabweans will choose between Emerson and agog Wayne is a member of the ruling party and the incumbent president he was appointed after Mugabe was ousted Umaga gwah is a former ally of the ex-president though Mugabe said he will not support him claiming he actually assumed power illegally now this presidential candidate is expected to get 40% of the vote that's according to the latest polls this is more than his main rival Nelson Chama is expected to get he's are the current leader of the opposition but also worked as a pastor and a lawyer charmita is 40 and if elected would become Zimbabwe's youngest ever president now the two candidates do have opposing political views Umaga guaca reportedly favours good relations with Russia and China what is rifled chow Mesa its pro-western he traveled to the u.s. to meet the State Department and members of Congress at the end of last year an RT spoke to political analyst and author howard Feldman who says the US does have an interest in this election I think it's a fairly dangerous and fairly obvious that the US are going to have some form of influence recent days we have seen the withdrawal of funding from the American from NGOs we also do know that there are still sanctions that the US have applied due managua but there's definitely some form of politicizing of the or interference of the elections by the Americans and I think America is playing a quite a dangerous game with us because if the wrong candidate as far as they're concerned which is been an GOG wave he retains their power if he is able to succeed where and it does look like is going to then America will certainly be left on the outside of it having used their influence financial and political influence during the run-up to the election I don't believe it's going to be beautiful positively once a result has been announced many countries have strict rules on what can be done during political campaigns and Zimbabwe is no exception some of its restrictions though are very special you
