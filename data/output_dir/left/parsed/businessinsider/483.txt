so I'm just gonna hello and welcome to
the great business inside a bake-off
this week I'm gonna be attempted to make
fortune cookies there seems to be a bit
more of a simple recipe I've got less
ingredients less stages in the process
how can it be the first thing I've got
to do is to add a teaspoon vanilla
extract I also have a teaspoon of almond
extract next thing I'm gonna do is add 2
teaspoons of water and 2 egg whites and
put 3 tablespoons of sunflower oil whisk
these in until they're light and fluffy
I'm just gonna guess about 100 grams of
flour in here and 100 grams of caster
sugar pinch of salt now I'm just
whisking this together
what I'm gonna do now is just put a
tablespoon of the mixture on bread that
out until it's about 8 centimeters wide
into the oven for 8 minutes
good write fast now it's not coming off
this isn't going as well as I'd hoped
oh I've got it I've got it yes right
I've now got to quickly fold this in
half now slip my fortune in here squeeze
the edges which are a bit crispy
actually and there you have the perfect
fortune cookie as you can see I think
this is gone astonishingly well for my
second effort so we'll leave those to
cool and then get stuck in and see what
I've bought you this
I've not been very fortunate
pretty horrible get that almond flavor
through but the biscuit is kind of soft
in the middle and crunchy on the outside
okay let's see what my fortune is anyway
oh this is really weird
you
