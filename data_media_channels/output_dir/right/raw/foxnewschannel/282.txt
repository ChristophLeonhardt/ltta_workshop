1
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:06,907
>> Tucker: WE BRING YOU ANOTHER

2
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:08,975
INSTALLMENT IN OUR ONGOING

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,410
DEVELOPMENT OF CALIFORNIA AND

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,546
THE LONG DISSENT FROM A MIDDLE

5
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:15,315
CLASS UTOPIA TO THE KIND OF

6
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:16,616
PLACE THAT DONALD TRUMP WON'T

7
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:17,751
WANT IMMIGRATION FROM.

8
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:18,985
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES ARE KNOWN

9
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,754
FOR ELECTION FRAUD.

10
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,589
CALIFORNIA'S DMV JUST ADMITTED

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,191
TO ACCIDENTALLY REGISTERING MORE

12
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:29,162
THAN 1,500 NONCITIZENS TO VOTE.

13
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,432
LOS ANGELES MEANWHILE,

14
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,802
LOS ANGELES IS GRAPPLING WITH

15
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:36,203
TYPHUS.

16
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:38,939
IN SAN FRANCISCO, AN APP CALLED

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,176
SNAP CRAP JUST HELPED RESIDENTS

18
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,778
REPORT LOCAL WASTE ON THE

19
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,379
SIDEWALK TO THE GOVERNMENT.

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,015
VICTOR HANSON IS A NATIVE

21
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:49,549
CALIFORNIAN.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,017
HIS FAMILY HAS BEEN THERE FOR

23
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,887
SIX GENERATIONS IN THE SAME

24
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:54,187
HOUSE.

25
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,489
HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

26
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,693
AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU ON THE SET.

27
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:02,028
SO I JUST -- LET'S STAND BACK

28
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,597
REALLY QUICKLY AND ASK THE

29
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,932
OBVIOUS QUESTION.

30
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:10,570
HOW DID THE GREATEST STATE GO TO

31
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,037
WHAT IT IS NOW?

32
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:11,671
>> A PERFECT STORM.

33
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:16,376
WE HAD $3 TRILLION CAP IN FOR

34
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,378
CAPITOLIZATION OF FACEBOOK AND

35
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:18,912
GOOGLE.

36
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,815
CONVINCED MILLIONS WHERE THE

37
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:25,051
MONEY WAS CONCENTRATED THAT THEY

38
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,753
WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THEIR OWN

39
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:27,120
IDEOLOGY.

40
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,588
THEY COULD AFFORD THE DREAM AND

41
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,191
HAVE ALL OF THESE RESTRICTIONS,

42
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,493
GREATER REGULATIONS, GREEN

43
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,895
UTOPIAN IDEAS THAT WOULD AFFECT

44
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:36,596
OTHER PEOPLE MOSTLY IN THE

45
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,764
INTERIOR BUT NOT ALWAYS.

46
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,000
HOUSING WENT UP BECAUSE OF THE

47
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:40,400
REGULATIONS.

48
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,369
SMALL BUSINESSES FLED.

49
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:42,669
TAXES.

50
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,539
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST BASKET OF

51
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,606
GASOLINE SALES AND INCOME TAXES

52
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,974
IN THE NINE STATES.

53
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,143
>> THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

54
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,846
THE TAXES IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE

55
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,648
LOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIKE THE

56
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:55,615
BAY AREA --

57
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,417
>> THERE'S OTHER ELEMENTS TO

58
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,451
THIS DISASTER.

59
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,888
WE HAD 10 TO 15 MILLION PEOPLE

60
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,356
THAT CAME ACROSS THE SOUTHERN

61
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,192
BORDER WITHOUT LEGALITY, WITHOUT

62
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,661
ENGLISH OR A DIPLOMA.

63
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:09,763
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN CALIFORNIA

64
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:12,799
BECAME A MEDIEVAL SOCIETY.

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,667
IT'S LIKE A KEEP.

66
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:16,069
THE COASTAL STRIP IS THE CASTLE

67
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,138
KEEP WHERE THE ELITE LIVE AND

68
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:23,009
EVERYBODY ELSE SERVES THEM.

69
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,643
THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS FLED.

70
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,046
WE HAVE A THIRD OF WELFARE

71
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:26,613
RECIPIENTS.

72
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:31,751
20% OF THE STATE IS BELOW THE

73
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,218
POVERTY LINE.

74
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,156
WHEN YOU GET SCHOOLS 46th IN THE

75
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,490
NATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE RAINED

76
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,391
49th.

77
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,860
THANK GOT FOR MISSISSIPPI.

78
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,162
>> Tucker: ARKANSAS USED TO SAY

79
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:42,462
THAT.

80
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,163
NOW IT'S CALIFORNIA.

81
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,765
SO THE REST OF THE VIEWERS THAT

82
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,866
DON'T LIVE IN CALIFORNIA, WHAT

83
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,102
DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH US?

84
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,271
SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS?

85
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,305
>> YES.

86
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,074
CALIFORNIA GAVE US PETE WILSON,

87
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:54,407
REAGAN.

88
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,177
IT FLIPPED TO A ONE-PARTY STATE.

89
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,278
THAT WAS THIS WEIRD NEW

90
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,181
COMBINATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC

91
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:01,481
PARTY.

92
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,284
IT'S A PYRAMIDAL SOCIETY.

93
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,719
AMERICA'S WEALTHY PEOPLE ARE

94
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,486
LEFT WING NOW.

95
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,054
THEY'RE ULTRA WEALTHY AND THEY

96
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,457
HAVE A SUBSIDIZED POOR ON THE

97
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:10,790
BOTTOM.

98
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,525
THAT WAS THE PARADIGM THAT

99
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,693
OVERREGULATED, OVERTAXED AND

100
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,295
SENT PEOPLE OUT OF THE STATE.

101
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,296
>> Tucker: THERE'S A QUESTION

102
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,931
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

103
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,301
LET'S SAY YOU'RE THE 41-YEAR-OLD

104
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,603
MULTIBILLIONAIRE THAT OWNS

105
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:23,937
TWITTER.

106
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,239
TEN MINUTES AWAY PEOPLE ARE

107
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,108
DYING OF ODs ON THE SIDEWALK.

108
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,542
>> BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT

109
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,043
YOUR WEALTH.

110
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,078
SO IN THE ABSTRACT, YOU CAN

111
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,814
AFFORD TO BE LEFT WING AND HELP

112
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:40,220
THE POOR WHILE YOUR GETS GOO  GO

113
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,155
TO SACRED WALL.

114
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:46,292
WALLS DON'T WORK ON THE SOUTHERN

115
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,094
BORDER BUT THEY WORK AND YOUR

116
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:48,428
STATE.

117
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,897
SO YOU CAN NAVIGATE ABOUT THE

118
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,665
ROBERT MUELLERIFICATIONS OF YOUR

119
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,732
OWN IDEOLOGY.

120
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,967
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

121
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,168
>> Tucker: YOU'D THINK THEY WANT

122
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,503
TO HELP THE PEOPLE OUT THEIR

123
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:57,037
DOOR.

124
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,571
>> YES.

125
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,140
GO TO REDWOOD CITY.

126
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,841
AT THIS TIME SERVICE AREA FOR

127
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,678
SILICON VALLEY.

128
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,112
MEXICAN FAMILIES HAVE SIX AND

129
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,580
SEVEN FAMILIES IN A HOUSE.

130
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,783
THEY'RE NOT LIBERAL AT ALL.

131
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,251
>> Tucker: THEY'RE NOT.

132
00:04:11,252 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THEY RUINED THE STATE.
