this thing pulling you back<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys it fear</font>

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,640
the fear of failure is it lazy and I

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,170
think it's I think it's a combination of

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,300
things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a lack of discipline</font>

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,890
I think it's a lack of knowing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,590
going to take a lack of direction fear

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,180
is always involved I mean there's a fear

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not going to be capable enough</font>

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,079
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be adequate once you</font>

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,090
train hard enough and you go and compete

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,010
maybe it's not adequate to be the best

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,719
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fear on that and</font>

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,670
I want to showcase through the book all

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,160
the insecurities that were natural to me

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,340
as a person as an as an athlete all the

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,440
self-doubts all of the the things that I

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,110
could or couldn't do in my head and say

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,460

<font color="#CCCCCC">that made me different from a lot of</font>

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,000
other Olympic athletes is I learned how

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,309
to overcome those things internally and

30
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,710
in return I came out a much stronger

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:00:00,000
person and better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I was yesterday</font>
