75 years ago you had you had another disenfranchised group where nobody was speaking up for them and that was japanese-americans here and so I just feel very strongly that today and 2017 we've gotta speak up there are no boundaries to this order so so unfortunately if there is no check against what the what the president can do in an executive order that's nothing there's nothing that stops him from expanding the order further or extending it and saying you know well it's 120 days we'll do another 120 days and then all of a sudden that's permanent if we're going to have national security and a super important we just can't have it under a framework where people from a certain nationality are excluded that's just something that I don't think any of us on our watch want to be saying that we stood by and we're silent when that was going on
