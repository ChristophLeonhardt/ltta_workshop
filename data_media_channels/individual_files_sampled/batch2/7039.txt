young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcasts of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio the Trump administration will stop allowing those who are seeking asylum because of gang violence and domestic abuse from coming into the country they will no longer grant asylum to these individuals Jeff Sessions issued an order on a case he referred to himself called the matter of a be overturning the Board of Immigration Appeals decision that a Salvadorian woman should receive asylum based on abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband and the police's lack of action to stop it now we know that most of the Central American migrants who try to come into the country do so because of extreme violence in their countries and you know we have been more open-minded toward granting them asylum but Jeff sessions is not in favor of that in fact he has made clear for years that he believes most asylum claims are invalid or straight-up fraudulent and the administration is pushing for legal changes by Congress that would allow the government to turn away or quickly deport more people who claim they fear returning to their native countries so currently there are exceptions made for people who fall under a social class or a social group so if you are being targeted by a government because of your religious beliefs for instance you will be more likely to be granted asylum under how our laws are written and how Jeff Sessions interprets Asylum laws sessions also will return to 2014 precedent from the Board of Immigration Appeals in a separate case that has been cited in numerous Asylum cases of women who suffered from domestic violence so if you are a woman who's suffering from domestic violence and you are desperately seeking safety for yourself and your children Jeff Sessions leaves that the government should turn you away by the way keep in mind that since Jeff sessions is the Attorney General he is the head honcho when it comes to the decision-making pertaining to immigration so even if judges rule on these cases and disagree with him he is essentially the man with the last word he gets to overturn their decisions not overturn but he can go against their decisions because he has that type of power yeah this is one of the more depressing stories of the day because these are people who flee such awful situations it's violence on a scale I mean talking about cultural violence you know where they can abuse these women and I'm being polite when I say abuse and the cops don't care you can't call anyone and these kids come who are often abused with the mothers and they're they and they begin this Trek to America and this was always a place where at least you'd get a hearing on these things by the way I'm leaving out wars and other forms of organized civil violence which threaten these people as well but the idea that you can close the door that we as a country can close the door on these people I feel we're giving up a sort of a moral imperative that we have it's I think it's a very sad day it's just like checking off the box there's like stair steps so people say you know you can't separate okay so okay look if someone's saying you know we agree with your views on illegal immigration but these people are seeking asylum you can't take their kids from him so okay we've got an answer to that so now we're changing the rules on asylum and even like this quote him saying that it was never meant to alleviate problems even serious problems it's saying I acknowledge that you're going through it it's just not my problem yeah I'm here looking for help that's exactly right I love that you mentioned that because previously there was this outright rejection that people coming to the United States seeking refuge or asylum really needed to find a safe place to go right right he made it seem as though and the Trump administration as a whole has made it seem as though anyone who's trying to come in is dangerous anyone who's trying to come in is a criminal which is why they are now prosecuting everyone even if it's an individual who comes to the border and clearly states I'm not trying to cross illegally I I need a refuge I need asylum right they will take the kids away and they will prosecute that individual and that is exactly what's happening right now yeah the stories are heartbreaking they're putting up families and again these are not people who are coming here for economic opportunity these are people who are seeking asylum they are asylees from awful situations around the globe and the idea that we split up their family I mean the it's it's into its insult to injury that we split up their family and then ultimately slam the door on them and prosecute them it's as I say it's just so sad I can't believe my country is doing that hates it wants to talk about ms-13 and so a lot of these people are trying to get away from that and now we're saying listen deal with it with your own people sorry bhauja but this is no longer a safe space and that's it's disappointing well what we're doing to these children and how we're treating these families is cruel and unusual it really it's abusive the physical ripping children out of their parent and sending them to absolutely faraway States and you know and they're not reunited with their kids for months after that if at all I mean we're losing track of these kids it's it's the process of the handling of all of these people that process is clearly way flawed and awful but our policy now is is starting to match that process it's just as awful yeah and the problem was already bad under the Obama administration when you know the the migrant children unaccompanied minors came into the country in 2014 you know immigration officials couldn't really keep track of them because they don't aid they don't have the resources to do it and when they find an adult in the United States to take care of these kids oftentimes that adult is undocumented him or herself and so they'll give a fake number or the or they won't answer the phone especially under this administration Trump's policies will only exacerbate that and we're already seeing the ramifications of it and it's just it's devastating and and it's scary to know that we could be this cruel to children and in the same party that claims they're pro-life that they care about those children they care about those babies that's the party that's either complacent or supportive of these policies too easy wasteful Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're at uoit subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of our videos
