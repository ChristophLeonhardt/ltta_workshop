1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,100
THERE HAS BEEN A TITANIC
EFFORT OVER THE COURSE OF

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,819
SEVERAL DECADES NOW TO GET THE
PUBLIC IN THE U.S. AND AROUND

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:10,830
THE GLOBE TO CARE ABOUT CLIMATE
CHANGE, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,059
CHANGES WE MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE
SOCIALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY BUT

5
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,900
ALSO IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT
POLICY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,390
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT BUT NOW I
WONDER IF ALONG THE WAY THE

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,150
FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE MIGHT
HAVE LED PEOPLE TO PAY A LITTLE

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,910
LESS ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE
OTHER THINGS RESULTING FROM OUR

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,190
EMISSIONS, OTHER THINGS WE ARE
DOING THAT AREN'T JUST STARTING

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,420
TO DEVELOP INTO DISASTERS AND
WILL WRECK OUR CIVILIZATION IN A

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,499
FEW DECADES BUT ARE DOING
TERRIBLE DAMAGE TO US RIGHT NOW.

12
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,540
WE'VE GOT SOME SCARY STATS FOR
YOU WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT, AND

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,289
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE EFFECT
OF POLLUTION.

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,289
NOT CLIMATE CHANGE

15
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:50,390
OFF IN THE FUTURE BUT POLLUTION
RIGHT NOW AND HOW MANY PEOPLE IT

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,649
KILLS AROUND THE GLOBE, THIS
STUDY ESTIMATES THAT EVERY YEAR

17
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,229
IT IS KILLING 9 MILLION PEOPLE,
AND THE BELIEF IS THAT MIGHT BE

18
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,430
AN UNDERESTIMATE --

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:09,100
>>WOW.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:19,840
>>WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR
GOVERNMENT DOES TO TRY TO

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,490
PRESERVE YOUR LIFE, THEY FOCUS
ON SOME OF THOSE A LITTLE MORE

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,330
IN TERMS OF RHETORIC BUT ALSO
DOLLARS.

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,170
IF WE COULD BRING UP

24
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,200
THIS CHART YOU WILL SEE SOME OF
THOSE CONTRIBUTORS IN TERMS OF

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,860
DEATH, YOU SEE HOW MUCH TOTAL
POLLUTION OUTPACES OTHER THINGS

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,860
CAUSING DEATH.

27
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,840
THINGS LIKE
TOBACCO SMOKING, THAT'S TRAGIC

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,340
BECAUSE IT'S ENTIRELY
PREVENTABLE AND SOME OF IT IS

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,720
SECONDHAND, YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE
DISEASE, ALCOHOL AS WELL, THEN

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,660
YOU SEE WAR AND MURDER, HOW LOW
IT IS, AND WE WILL RETURN TO

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,280
POLLUTION IN THE SECOND, BUT IT
STRIKES ME HOW BAD WE ARE AS A

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,110
SPECIES IN UNDERSTANDING AND
PRIORITIZING THINGS THAT ARE

33
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,290
THREATS TO OUR LIVES.

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,010
AND YOU
THINK THAT SUPPOSEDLY EVOLUTION

35
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,980
IS SELECTING BASED ON YOUR
ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,619
RISKS, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
THESE BIG THINGS, NOT THE TIGER

37
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,560
IN THE BUSH BUT THE POLLUTION IN
THE AIR OR THE EMISSIONS FROM A

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,420
POWER PLANT, WE CAN'T SEEM TO
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT ISN'T

39
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,480
COMPARABLE TO TERRORISM BUT THAT
IT BLOWS TERRORISM OUT OF THE

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,370
WATER IN TERMS OF THE LIKELIHOOD
THAT YOU OR SOMEONE YOU CARE

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,730
ABOUT COULD BE INJURED OR DIE,
AND AS A SPECIES WE CAN'T

42
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,409
IDENTIFY IT SO WE DON'T
PRIORITIZE IT WHEN IT COMES TIME

43
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,959
TO FUND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES.

44
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,939
>>THIS IS AN AMAZING STATISTIC,
I'M GLAD YOU SHOWED THIS, BUT

45
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,680
YOU MENTIONED EVOLUTION, LET ME
MENTION THIS FROM AN

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,909
EVOLUTIONARY STANDPOINT, THERE
IS A BOOK CALLED SAPIENS WHICH I

47
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:49,780
RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE, AND ONE OF
THE THINGS IN THERE IS THAT AS A

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,010
SPECIES WE CAN CONCEPTUALLY
GROUP OURSELVES, AND ONE OF THE

49
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,140
THINGS THAT HAS SEPARATED US
FROM OTHERS, EVEN OTHER SAPIENS

50
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,610
AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME, WAS WE
COULD CREATE A CONCEPT WE CAN

51
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,569
RALLY AROUND LIKE THOSE PEOPLE
ARE BAD, LET'S BAND TOGETHER AND

52
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,569
FIGHT THOSE PEOPLE.

53
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,700
OR THAT
THING IS BAD, MAYBE IN THIS CASE

54
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,700
POLLUTION.

55
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,989
SO THE IDEA THAT
WE'VE CREATED A NOTION THAT

56
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,340
MURDER AND TERRORISM AND THE
OTHER THINGS ON THAT LIST ARE

57
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:26,439
THE REAL EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO
US, WHEREAS THE THING AT THE TOP

58
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,060
IS NOT TALKED ABOUT AS MUCH,
THIS POLLUTION, IN FACT WE JUST

59
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,329
ELECTED AN ADMINISTRATION THAT
IS COMMITTED TO REMOVING THE

60
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,159
PROTECTIONS WHICH ARE FLIMSY
ALREADY, BASIC AIR AND WATER

61
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,120
PROTECTIONS, SO WE ARE FEEDING
THIS MACHINE BECAUSE WE'VE SOLD

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,750
THE CONCEPT EFFECTIVELY, WE'VE
SOLD THE CONCEPT TO OURSELVES,

63
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,379
THAT THE REAL THREAT TO US IS
NOT THIS POLLUTION, POLLUTION IS

64
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:56,499
BAD AND WE ALL GET THAT, BUT THE
REAL PROBLEM IS THE TERRORISTS

65
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,329
OR THE BLOWING UP STUFF AND
SHOOTING PEOPLE, THAT IS ALL BAD

66
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,730
TOO BUT THIS IS HAPPENING
ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

67
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,020
TO SEE THE STAT LAID OUT LIKE
THAT IS ALARMING.

68
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,599
>>IT DOVETAILS WITH THE
CORPORATE MEDIA, IN PART THE

69
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,220
REASON THERE IS AN EMPHASIS ON
HYPING THINGS LIKE THE WAR

70
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,900
MACHINE AND YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT
THE POLLUTANTS IS PARTLY BECAUSE

71
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,680
THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO BEING
GAMED BY BOTH SIDES BUT PARTLY

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,900
BECAUSE IT'S BAD BUSINESS IF YOU
MAKE YOUR ADVERTISERS ANGRY.

73
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,900
AND

74
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,560
IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE THE
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE PUTTING A

75
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,419
LOT OF MONEY IN THERE YOU DON'T
MAKE IT A THING, SO WE NEED

76
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,620
MEDIA TO HOLD THESE FORCES
ACCOUNTABLE.

77
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,810
>>IN MY INTRO I TALKED ABOUT HOW
THANKFULLY WE ARE FOCUSING ON

78
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,050
CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT NOW,
THANKFULLY A LOT OF THE THINGS

79
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,550
WE SHOULD DO AND MUST DO TO
MITIGATE THE WORST EFFECTS OF

80
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,629
CLIMATE CHANGE WOULD ACTUALLY
HELP SIGNIFICANTLY WITH

81
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,300
POLLUTION.

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,530
YOU ALLUDED TO THE
CORPORATE MEDIA, I THINK UNTIL

83
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,249
WE GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS,
GET MONEY OUT OF THE MEDIA,

84
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:08,389
LET'S AT LEAST UTILIZE THE
CORRUPTION.

85
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,740
THE PEOPLE MAKING

86
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,030
THE SOLAR PANELS, COULD YOU
PLEASE START ADVERTISING ON CNN?

87
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,039
AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT, LET'S
JUST THROW FOR THE NEXT 10 OR 20

88
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,229
YEARS BILLIONS IN SUBSIDIES TO
PEOPLE MAKING SOLAR CELLS.

89
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,229
IF

90
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,090
YOU'RE GOING TO SELL OUT AND
GIVE ALL OUR MONEY TO

91
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,479
CORPORATIONS, AT LEAST HAVE IT
BE THE ONES TRYING TO SAVE OUR

92
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,479
LIVES.

93
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,280
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT
WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

94
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
AND BY THE

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,669
WAY THERE'S A QUOTE FROM THE
STUDY THAT SAYS THAT POLLUTION

96
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,460
IS SO DANGEROUS THAT THEY SAY IT
THREATENS THE CONTINUING

97
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,949
SURVIVAL OF HUMAN SOCIETIES.

98
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,199
AND
YOU WILL SEE THESE ARTICLES, CNN

99
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,169
WILL HAVE SOMETHING ON IT,
THEY'LL HAVE AN ARTICLE ON THE

100
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,479
WEBSITE, THINK PROGRESS WILL
COVER IT, THAT WILL BE AWESOME,

101
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,289
BUT TODAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
WAS IN THE NEWS, ONE AMERICAN

102
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,440
NEWS NETWORK TOOK THE STATS
ABOUT CRIME IN THE U.K., LIVES

103
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,030
THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH ISLAMIC TERRORISM, WHICH

104
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:09,770
LED TO A TWEET FROM DONALD TRUMP
-- HERE THEY ARE SAYING IT'S A

105
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,789
THREAT TO THE CONTINUING
SURVIVAL OF OUR SPECIES, WE WILL

106
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,979
TALK ABOUT IT AND MOVE ON.

107
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,580
A
LITTLE MORE INFORMATION,

108
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,039
ALTHOUGH THEY SAY THAT NO
COUNTRY IS FREE OF THE DAMAGING

109
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,879
EFFECTS OF POLLUTION IN THE
PRESENT DAY, 92% OF THE DEATHS

110
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,080
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OCCUR IN
LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES.

111
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,360
THERE'S NO EQUALITY IN TERMS OF
THIS, IT AFFECTS PEOPLE WHO HAVE

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,479
LESS OF AN ABILITY TO MITIGATE
IT.

113
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,510
>> THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS
CLINGING TO COME I KNOW

114
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,130
IT'S BAD BUT IT'S OVER THERE IN
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DON'T

115
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,669
HAVE MUCH MONEY -- FAX THEN
LET'S HELP THEM.

116
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:54,969
>>OF COURSE, AND I WOULD ALSO
SAY THIS, IT'S HAPPENING HERE IN

117
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:57,189
THIS COUNTRY, FIRST WORLD.

118
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,940
THE
PROBLEMS OF AIR AND WATER

119
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,750
POLLUTION ARE BEING LIVED OUT
RIGHT HERE IN THIS PLACE, WITH

120
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,229
ALL THE MONEY.

121
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,040
IF YOU LOOK AT
THE STATISTICAL BREAKDOWN THEY

122
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
WILL EVEN SHOW YOU DEATHS FROM
THOSE DISEASES YOU ARE TALKING

123
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,159
ABOUT, EMPHYSEMA AND THE LIKE,
HAPPENING IN THE U.S.,

124
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:15,979
SO WHEN YOU LOOK BEYOND THE
HEADLINES, I KNOW THE

125
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,870
PERCENTAGES ARE LOWER BUT PEOPLE
ARE LOSING THEIR LIVES HERE

126
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,129
BECAUSE OF POLLUTION.

127
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,510
>> AND WHEN YOU OR SOMEONE YOU
KNOW HAS TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL

128
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,730
AND GO INTO BANKRUPTCY TO DEAL
WITH SOME OF THESE DISEASES,

129
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,530
UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY DOLLAR YOU
PUT INTO THAT MEDICAL CARE IS

130
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,349
SUBSIDIZING THE CORPORATIONS
THAT PUT THE EMISSIONS AND

131
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,250
POLLUTION INTO THE AIR IN THE
FIRST PLACE, THAT MONEY IS STILL

132
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,800
BEING SPENT, JUST NOT BY THE
CORPORATIONS, BY YOU AND ME.

133
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,409
LET'S BRING UP ONE MORE GRAPHIC
TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE THINGS

134
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:54,479
LEADING TO THESE DEATHS,
AIRBORNE POLLUTION IS

135
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:03,830
SIGNIFICANT, CARS, SHIPPING
CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH, ALSO TOXIC

136
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:10,389
WATER, WORKPLACE POLLUTION, EVEN
THINGS LIKE HEATING SYSTEMS AND

137
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,139
THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE THIRD
WORLD ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT.

138
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,139
AND

139
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,490
THIS WILL CONTINUE ON WITH MY
LET'S USE THE CORRUPTION THING,

140
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,340
IF PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO CARE
IN THIS COUNTRY AND THIS

141
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,969
GOVERNMENT ABOUT THIS PROBLEM
JUST BASED ON WANTING TO

142
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,210
SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES, IF THAT'S
NOT A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH

143
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,050
DRIVER OF INTEREST, LET'S BRING
UP THIS GRAPHIC --

144
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:37,979
>> 
EVEN IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT

145
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:38,979
IT'S KILLING YOU, THINK ABOUT

146
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,400
THE MONEY YOU CAN MAKE IF YOU
DEALT WITH THIS.

147
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
BY THE WAY AS

148
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,160
WE SAID ALL OF THESE NUMBERS ARE
MORE THAN LIKELY AN

149
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,930
UNDERESTIMATE OF THE ACTUAL
EFFECT, BECAUSE MANY OF THE

150
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,060
DISEASES THAT LEAD TO THE TOP 10
KILLERS IN AMERICA, THINGS LIKE

151
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,160
DIABETES AND LIKE THAT, COULD
HAVE STRONG TIES TO POLLUTION,

152
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,470
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
YET SO THEY AREN'T INCLUDED

153
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,470
IN THESE FIGURES.

154
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,430
>>I POSTED A LINK TO AN ARTICLE
ABOUT THIS TRUMP PENCE

155
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,840
ADMINISTRATION AND THE RELAXING
OF PROTECTIONS FROM THE EPA AND

156
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,519
THE RISE OF ALZHEIMER'S FROM
POLLUTION.

157
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,620
THE HEALTH EFFECTS

158
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,970
REVERBERATE BEYOND THE
FATALITIES TO DIMINISH THE KIND

159
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,510
OF LIFE YOU WILL HAVE IN THIS
COUNTRY.

160
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,510
THIS IS THE STUFF

161
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,720
HAPPENING NOW, THIS NEW
ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY

162
00:09:29,720 --> 00:00:00,000
DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT, SO
I'M GLAD YOU DID THAT STORY.
