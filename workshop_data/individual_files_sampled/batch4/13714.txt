former vice president and lovable loon Al Gore has declared that global warming is the principal cause of the civil war in Syria and of the brexit vote in the UK oh really Weird Al made the comments during an interview in London then he spun the propeller on his striped beanie and predicted that if he got it going fast enough he'd be able to fly around the room and cool the atmosphere at the same time Gore's theory is that droughts in Syria forced people to move into cities where stupid Obama policies had caused the rise of Isis so British voters opted to leave the oppressive EU and therefore everyone should give Al Gore even more money now it's something like that wiping the drool from his chin wiping the drool from his chin while handlers rebut until a the man who was once so help me very nearly President of the United States for crying out loud went on to say quote I predicted all the way back in 1996 that if we did not take drastic measures we would all die by 2006 it's lucky I was able to bring everyone back to life using my magic powers and make them forget the entire incident with the memory ray hidden in my wristwatch but believe you me it was a close call unquote Gore's amazing ability to predict environmental disasters makes him only the latest in a long line of environmental disaster predictors whose uncanny accuracy and exactitude are matched only by the absurdity of their gibberish for instance in 1970 environmental scientists predicted that by 1985 air pollution would reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth by 1/2 I'm not making this up this led environmentalists to predict an ice age by the year 2000 which is why it got so dark and cold 17 years ago though actually that may just be because I passed out in the bathtub and didn't regain consciousness until 2:00 in the morning then of course there was the prediction that the world would experience a population bomb in this scenario scenario advanced back in the 1960s population was going to increase so fast that soon people would swarm through our cities like locusts devouring everything in their path including other human beings unless Brad Pitt could make it to Wales and find the cure this prediction of the exact plot of World War Z more than two years in advance still stands is an awe-inspiring example of environmentalist accuracy in predicting ludicrous fantasies environmentalists have also predicted that our oil would run out and that there would be widespread famine which is amazing because my oil actually did run out just yesterday and by the time I walked through the gas station I was starving one thing is certain though as long as Al Gore's alive the climate will continue to experience huge intermittent gusts of hot air followed by intense periods of side-splitting hilarity trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show here we go we got a lot to talk about today but let us begin with our new sponsor stamps.com the reason I love this new sponsor is because I have this thing about weeding online I don't even know we don't really wait online that much anymore it used to be like movies you had to wait on line to get in the

freeways I'd rather move quickly even if it's longer go back the one place where you still have to wait on line is the post office I mean I love the post offices they do a great job giving props but

stuff alright and when I'm selling things by the way we're gonna be talking a lot about feminism today and we had this sweet no we sent Knowles to see Beauty and the Beast our cultural best-selling cultural account correspondent and super troll Michael Knowles we sent to see Beauty and the Beast my daughter faith Moore has a brilliant piece about Beauty and the Beast and why it is not in fact the new Beauty and the Beast and why it's not in fact feminism she writes on parenting and things that that PJ media and she is a Disney Princess addict and in fact she has a website on Facebook Disney Princess attic so you can go on facebook.com slash Disney Princess attic and you can see my daughter being a Disney princess and I know yeah I know our producer Jonathan hay loves those Disney Princesses yeah I'm worried about you a little bit as I'm not sure where they're not sure whether it's the long flowing blue gown or the fact that you talked to squirrels Oh straight anyway go and see that doesn't he princess attic all right so yesterday and this has been kind of the theme for the week wouldn't we were talking about hysteria and narrative okay and why I think I think because the left does not believe in truth because at the base they have this relativistic worldview they think that the truth is a story that you tell if and whoever has the most power gets to tell the story that's what and remember that book roots Alex Haley it starts with history is written by the winners which isn't actually true but that was a very catchy phrase history is written by the winners and the the left wants to make sure that they are telling the story because they think that gives them power over your mind which to some extent it does because people are swept away in this narrative that they form in an order to get power they have to is very essential tools one is silence and one is crisis okay and they were both those tools are in evidence in the news today and I want to start with silence because this story drove me a little nuts I mean this is the story about Planned Parenthood remember the California prosecutors on Tuesday charged two anti-abortion activists who made undercover videos of themselves trying to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood they charge them with 15 felonies saying they invaded the privacy of medical providers by filming without consent so Planned Parenthood killing babies selling their body parts for cash not a problem but taking pictures of them and catching them you know doing this that's the problem remember that's Clavin the second rule of mainstream mood media news coverage is if the scam is on the right the stories the scandal if the scandal is on the left the story is how did you get that information right so this is a perfect example of that rule in operation than the law I mean this is tyranny its tyranny and all that remember all the press oh that was so shocked by Donald Trump saying the media the news media is the enemy of the people this is horrible where are they today these are journalists they're going in now when this happened I mean the actual meet the actual video which I'll show you in a minute is so shocking it really is people just bartering away the limbs of murdered children basically for money for cash so the press came out with this thing in the way the Prescott these things are heavily edited they're heavily edited so they released the whole I mean you can watch the entire thing of that eventually you could watch the entire thing no editing you know I mean it wasn't there it may have been edited for space for time but it didn't change the narrative one little bit so when I first came to the Daily wire I made a video making fun and we're laughing because I made that this was the first was the first video I ever did was it I made this video because I was I was livid I mean I saw these videos and I was livid at the way the mainstream media was burying this story so we all worked so hard on this video it took us weeks and it to bring home man so so I was I was pretending to be the mainstream media news man and we wouldn't release the the videos of this thing and how they were being covered this thing shocked our bosses so much because we were just getting to know one another I shouldn't have led with it but I did this but it was the story it set me off you know i shouldn'ta led with it and they looked at this and they thought we don't want our names on this and they made us cut the words deadly wire now if I did it today I think now they kind of get it and we got well we all kind of know each other better and they understand where I was coming from let me just play one I don't like to play my old videos because you can look them up but I just got to play one minute of this this is me as this is the mainstream media news anchor introducing these secret videos good evening this is the MSM news desk bringing you all the news that fits a group of conservative right-wing conservatives have been releasing a series of hidden-camera videos taken at Planned Parenthood facilities around the country these far-right icky conservative videos are heavily edited to make it look like Planned Parenthood kills babies and sells their body parts for medical experiments we'll all right Planned Parenthood does do that but these videos try to make it seem like that's not okay this video for instance entraps one of Planned Parenthood's most respected doctors in an admittedly awkward moment loves living at the children's table something about the devil eating babies didn't sit well with new bosses they didn't know me you know I mean this is essentially really what this take a look this is dr. Mary Mary GAC Gadar the president of Planned Parenthood's Medical Director counsel being caught she's negotiating a call it tissue but his body parts what would you expect intact tissue what sort of compensation what sort of the one you start by tell me where you used to be okay I don't think so I'd like to I would like to know what would make you happy what would work for you you know negotiations a person figure first right so you know I don't look at it that way I know you want to play that game I get it but you know no I you know what if you lowball act pleasantly surprised and you'll know it's lowball what I want to know is what would what would work for you don't lowball it tell me what you that's way too low and that's really that's way too low I don't not in it for the money it's a fit yeah but we'll take the money but we're not in it for the money you know that so the thing is remember the formula the formula is to acquire power so that you control the narrative because the narrative is the truth and one of the tools that they're really - it's like a pincer movement on one and there is silence and on the other hand there is crisis and this is silence they are silencing these people they're not gonna get away with this though the Supreme Court has already ruled that you can that a news in a news organization can do this kind of secret video stuff if it's in public California has a law that I can't tape you on the phone in a private conversation but this is not gonna cover that they don't care they're just intimidating journalists they want to make sure you know Planned Parenthood the abortion mill of Planned Parenthood is off-limits and by the way they call their movement pro-choice right they call it pro-choice there is no choice involved they do not want remember when they had that woman's March the women's March I guess it was in January they banned women who were pro-life from sponsoring the March and katha pollitt who is a well never mind katha pollitt who writes for the the liberal journal of the nation then wrote an article can feminists be pro-choice are feminists and she ends she says well she can be anti-abortion for herself and many pro-choice women are but rights and personal ethics are not the same I don't see how restricting and criminalizing abortion bullying women on their way into the clinic and pushing lies that abortion will give you breast cancer make you infertile or lead to a life's worth of misery are compatible with respecting other women's rights to make their own moral decisions in an area where people left out one thing that all that stuff may be untrue but she left out the true one you know the one where it's killing babies that's the problem the problem is not it's always about they're always telling you about women's what do they call it birth you know reproduction rights women's you notice they never use the words they never use the words it's like they never say they don't even say abortion really anymore you know and and this is feminism in a nutshell by the way feminism you know there's that woman and Nita sarkeesian who is always yelling about oh girls and video games or you know sexist objects and all that stuff and they better be because otherwise I'm not playing but you know she she basically tweeted out feminism is about the collective liberation of women as a social class it's not about personal choice you don't have a personal choice to stay home there's a there was a woman in Australia New Zealand I can't remember as a feminist in Australia I think it was who said women should not be allowed to stay home and be homemakers and this by the way this was from the very beginning from the very beginning Simone de Beauvoir who wrote one of the most famous initial original feminist tracks I think it was called the second sex she said the same thing women should not be allowed to be homemakers because too many of them will choose that that's why it's not none of this is about choice it's all about silence so that's silence on the one side and the other side is crisis okay everything has to be a Chrysler I'm going to talk about this come on over we got to say goodbye to Facebook and you too I forgot to say it's the mailbag today yeah I totally forgot to talk about the mailbag if you don't come over to the Daily wire calm to hear the rest of the show you cannot hear the mailbag in which all your problems will be solved how could you miss that if you subscribe you can ask your own personal questions for a lousy eight bucks a month
