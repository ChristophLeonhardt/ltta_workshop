the FBI has released 71 pages of alleged correspondence between the bureau and Christopher's feel the former British spy who authored a dossier alleging collusion between Donald Trump and Russia the records show FBI payments to Steele as a confidential human source over an unknown period they also show that Steele told the FBI he had informed a third party he was acting as a source for the bureau however the document is mostly empty with important information removed so much so that it almost looks like a blanket form and that follows the FBI's release of documents on former Trump adviser Carter page with most of the text heavily redacted in that too let's cross live now to investigative journalist max bloom and file for his take hi max good to have you on the show why is the FBI releasing these documents so heavily redacted what's the point in that yeah I mean it's not these documents aren't heavily redacted they're completely whited out it's a literal whitewash I mean in this 71 page file there's more white than at a Coldplay concert or the Republican National Convention it is all white it's a it's it's shocking really the one the two things they acknowledge the FBI acknowledges is that it was paying Christopher Steele until November 1st 2016 so first of all James Comey who was the director of the FBI at the time has feigned ignorance about who was paying Christopher Steele so that's interesting and number two it acknowledges that Steele's contract was terminated because he had been the source for an article by Michael Isikoff which was specifically designed to get the word out about the Steele dossier so it could be dropped after Trump's election apology so many people of color who are cold player fans of course how do you expect tell me President Trump to react to this release he's been claiming this was a political hit job against his campaign from day one yeah I mean this is well despite the complete redaction it does confirmed part of trumps narrative that the FBI was colluding with the Clinton campaign because we also know that Christopher Steele had been employed through fusion GPS the opposition research firm and the contract was taken out by Perkins Coie which was the law firm of Hillary Clinton's campaign so this shows a clear case of collusion between the FBI directed by James Comey and the Clinton campaign and another thing we know is that Christopher Steele continued supplying information to the FBI after his contract with the FBI was terminated through Bruce or an FBI official who is married to a staffer at fusion GPS it's very embarrassing for people who are trying to prove Trump Ruscha collusion mucks just to pick up on something you said there why does the FBI actually need to hire a third party to investigate whether Trump colluded with Russia or not doesn't have its own specialists I would have thought it seems to me that there were partisan officials inside the FBI who've gone on record saying that they feared Trump's election and that they were trying to establish plausible deniability working through a third party that was also funded by the Clinton campaign you know I'm not a trump supporter I'm not on the record really liking Donald Trump very much but it seems slightly disturbing to me that the FBI was investigating a political campaign and so far seems to have not turned up anything to enforce the collusion narrative and then we also have the fact that a confidential operative Stephan Stephan Halper was planted inside the Trump campaign as well that's been completely forgotten about Mike's thanks for taking us through that as you say a very very much reductive form investigative journalist max Blumenthal on the program you
