oh whoa
like I'm crust Mountain I think this is
Domino's right off the bat tastes like
it's got some garlic infusion
I feel like this cheese is more of like
a bouncy cheese you don't want your
cheese to bounce honestly it doesn't
taste like any cheese that I'm familiar
with
it's just processed garbage it's going a
stinky cheese kind of feel I feel like
the sauce is a little sweet this is like
some new bland pizza I don't know about
I don't smell anything
nothing it's oh my god it's like the
absence of smell I think this is Papa
John's
Papa's definitely in the house
I like this crust I mean I really don't
care for this this tastes like chunky
cheese pizza the sauce is kind of tangy
I don't know if pizza should be tangy
this tastes like Papa John's
Wow what one did sleep it's really good
feeling the crust it's a little spongy a
little doughy for my taste but okay whoa
what's on this um there is so much crust
here Wow
it was too much sauce I'm sure might
forego I was surprised that Pizza Hut
was probably superior I'm not surprised
though because I think Pizza Hut is like
making an effort
my favorite was Papa John's so I think
the Papa John's one which is super
surprising so I guess my favorite was
Domino's I'm not super surprised I
probably picked Domino's Oh Papa John oh
how you Pizza well done mmm tired of
tasty pizza try new slice of bland
