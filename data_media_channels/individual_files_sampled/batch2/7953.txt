a sheriff in Georgia has been suspended after the governor nathan Deal decided to suspend him following the sheriff signing off on the search of 900 high school students while police officers were looking for drug paraphernalia no drug paraphernalia was found however these students were on lockdown for hours their cell phones were taken away from them and the searches were much more invasive than what you would expect and so a grand jury did indict the police officer that I'm talking about the sheriff his name is Jeff hobby and two deputies in connection with the search at Worth County High School Hobby faces two counts of false imprisonment one count of sexual battery a charge of violating his oath of office now according to the lawsuit Hobby arrived at the school with a target list he's looking for students who have drugs on them target list of 13 students that he's suspected of having drugs only three of the listed students were at school that day and Hobbie had them brought to the administrative offices and searched but that wasn't good enough for him he decided no I want to go ahead and search 900 students think about what a gigantic waste of time and resources that is they didn't find any drugs no drug paraphernalia whatsoever besides which really you're gonna focus all your attention on this issue okay the lawsuit says Hobby then put the entire school on lockdown students were confined to classrooms hallways and the gym their cell phones were taken away so they couldn't even call their parents and so this is not looking good because there is a lawsuit filed by the parents of some of these students because they were they had their genitals touched in some cases they had their you know clothes taken off or certain articles of clothing lifted in front of other students and it was humiliating I mean this is a very clear abuse of power so much so that the governor of Georgia had to intervene and suspend this guy yeah I think this is a consequence of our addiction to police Inc and our addiction to the surveillance state I mean and just to even think back to my own high school experience the fact that we had a cop on campus all the time that most schools had a list of clothing that you couldn't wear because it was like gang affiliated right like like like shoelace colors right yeah it's funny and my school we we didn't have like the gang colors or anything but it was more there was way more emphasis on the way female students dressed right and so if we can see your shoulders you are a you're a harlot and you you must be taken to the principal's office that kind of stuff but you're right like we we didn't have a police officer we had like a really like jolly like security guard guy named Jerry that I have fond memories name right it was really nice but we never felt like we were on lockdown we're being watched we didn't we were we weren't treated as criminals and I think when when students are treated this way remember they're young their brains are still developing it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy I think right right right there's ways go ahead no I was just gonna say it we had a officer in uniform with his police car right in front of the entrance to the high school so it's already priming our brains to expect that encounter with the police and that again not only criminalize but you're on your toes because you think that you're you can possibly do something wrong right whether or not it is suspecting them of drugs they don't have but putting them in positions where they're made one herbal and suspected of being a criminal that's I mean when this starts young like you said it's a self-fulfilling prophecy it's also definitely part of a targeted effort to certain schools like public schools this doesn't happen at private schools I don't see this happening at all absolutely and I'm sure I guess it's all started with a complaint from either a set of parents who were concerned about drugs at the school if you've narrowed it down to a list of 13 students you can go talk to them right here right that's what would have been done if the school were a private school and that is you know an assumption but there are ways of doing drug sweeps that are lawful right so this is both like incompetence and an overreach so drug sweeps they bring the dogs in they you know they they don't pull students out of class you don't interrupt students are here to learn that's right yeah so when you interrupt that process it better be for good reason this is not good reason and I just feel like with minors as issues of like consent with their bodies being touched in terms of these they're minors exactly yeah it's just it's wildly inappropriate so I I did a little more digging because I was I wanted to learn more about this sheriff I wanted to know if he had you know a record of complaints you know had he abuse his power in the past and I came across this little kernel of information that I wanted to share with you guys that's gonna be do things good let's go to graphic 29 the sheriff now stands accused by the local prosecutor of interfering with the criminal investigation into his teenage son Zachary Lewis hobby who's 17 the younger hobby was arrested on October 9th and charged with felony possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and criminal trespass Sheriff hobby and his wife who is also an employee of the Worth County Sheriff's Office barged into the room ostensibly to invoke the 17 year olds fifth Amendment rights for him so he got involved like the Republican twist to the story of being again trans rights and then being caught in a bathroom this is that twist yes you needed to be searching your own house for the drugs that's apparently where they were who knows and maybe maybe that's the reason why he was so overzealous with these other students because maybe he looks at his son and he's like oh look at what my son got into it's because of the influence of some other person so I don't I don't know I'm doing pop psychology yeah but that's I hear anything that's not like that's not you don't have to abuse your power and treat other students that way and it's just it's amazing like he'll he'll stick up for son but he'll go ahead and strip-searched other innocent students who should be on campus to learn you're absolutely right a lot of people we're not the Young Turks you're The Young Turks you power this show together we build something amazing we broken stories like the Donna Brazile story the mainstream media wouldn't break we built the studio we built this network it's now number one all thanks to you guys let's come build it even bigger and stronger TYT Network comm /join
