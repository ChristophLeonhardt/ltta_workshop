1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,249
THE ATLANTIC HAS UNEARTHED
SOME EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT

2
00:00:03,249 --> 00:00:04,560
DONALD TRUMP, JR.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,590
WAS IN DIRECT
CONTACT WITH WIKILEAKS DURING

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,560
THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,450
NOW, THERE ARE DIFFERENT

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,030
ELEMENTS THAT MAKE THIS STORY
RELEVANT ESPECIALLY PERTAINING

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,700
TO SOME OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
THAT ARE ONGOING IN REGARD TO

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,220
RUSSIA AND POTENTIAL RUSSIAN
MEDDLING IN THIS PAST ELECTION.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,050
BEFORE WE GET INTO THE DETAILS
OF THE DIRECT MESSAGES THEY

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,640
SHARED WITH ONE ANOTHER, THERE
IS SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,239
SOME OF THE LEAKED INFORMATION
OBTAINED BY WIKILEAKS WAS GIVEN

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,320
TO THEM BY THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,420
NOW, THAT IS BASED

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,839
ON ANALYSIS BY U.S. INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, BUT

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:52,749
THERE ARE SKEPTICS WHEN IT COMES
TO THAT PORTION OF THE STORY.

16
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:55,429
WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO GIVE
YOU GUYS WHAT THEIR

17
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:59,249
COMMUNICATION WAS, AND WHAT KIND
OF ACTIONS THEY TOOK, MEANING

18
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:03,170
MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,
AFTER THEY WERE GIVEN CERTAIN

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,460
LINKS AND CERTAIN INFORMATION
FROM WIKILEAKS.

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,909
BEFORE YOU GET STARTED LET ME
JUST CLARIFY THAT I'M AMONG THE

21
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,600
SKEPTICS.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,460
INCLUDING THE
IMPORTANCE OF THIS STORY.

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,460
ALL

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,750
OVER TV AND ALL OVER THE MEDIA,
ANA WILL GIVE YOU THE DETAILS,

25
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,200
LET'S GIVE YOU THE FACTS FIRST,
AND DISCUSS WHETHER IT IS

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,640
GROUNDBREAKING COLLUSION OR NOT.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,609
FIRST, HOW DO WE HAVE
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS

28
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,609
CORRESPONDENCE?

29
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:59,509
WELL --

30
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,290
THEY WERE TURNED OVER TO
CONGRESS BY DONALD TRUMP, JR.

31
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,159
AND HIS LAWYER, THEY ARE
COOPERATING WITH THE

32
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,220
INVESTIGATION, SO CREDIT WHERE
IT IS DUE, BUT THAT'S WHERE THIS

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,140
INFORMATION IS FROM, AND THE
ATLANTIC OBTAINED THIS

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,520
INFORMATION AND REPORTED ON IT
LATE YESTERDAY.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
HERE IS WHERE IT

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,350
ALL BEGAN -- THE FIRST MESSAGE
SENT TO DONALD TRUMP, JR.

37
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,350
WAS

38
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,300
SEPTEMBER 20 OF 2016, AND IN
THAT MESSAGE SOMEONE FROM

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,060
WIKILEAKS, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHO, ESSENTIALLY LET DONALD

40
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,060
TRUMP, JR.

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,000
KNOW ABOUT AN
ANTI-TRUMP WEBSITE, AND SOMEHOW

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,730
THEY MANAGED TO GET THE PASSWORD
TO THAT WEBSITE AND TOLD DONALD

43
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,300
TRUMP, JR., YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO
WHO IS BEHIND THIS WEBSITE.

44
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,650
DONALD TRUMP, JR.

45
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,010
RESPONDED TO
THAT AND SAID I WILL ASK AROUND,

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,980
AND HE DID ASK AROUND.

47
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,760
SO HE
NOTIFIED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,760
AFFILIATED WITH THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING THE

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,920
SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER, A
NUMBER OF CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS,

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,480
AND THROUGH THAT THEY FORWARDED
THE INFORMATION TO ONE ANOTHER,

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,760
KELLYANNE CONWAY, STEVE BANNON,
AND ALSO JARED KUSHNER, AS

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
I MENTIONED.

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,510
I THINK THERE IS ONE RELEVANT
REVELATION, THIS ONE I THINK IS

54
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,310
COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT.

55
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,200
THERE WAS
A WEBSITE, WE TOLD YOU ABOUT IT

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,950
AND YOU LOOKED INTO IT.

57
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,950
WHOOPDIE
DOO.

58
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,010
HE COULD HAVE FOUND OUT

59
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,070
ABOUT THE WEBSITE IN 1000
DIFFERENT WAYS.

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,070
THE NEW YORK

61
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,810
TIMES COULD HAVE TOLD HIM THERE
WAS A WEBSITE, AND I LOOKED INTO

62
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,810
IT. AND?

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,730
SINCE CENK PREFACED EVERYTHING
WITH HIS OVERALL TAKE, I WILL

64
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,560
GIVE YOU MINE, I DISAGREE WITH
CENK IN REGARD TO THIS NOT BEING

65
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
A BIG DEAL.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,790
THAT PORTION OF WHAT
WE KNOW I DON'T THINK IS A BIG

67
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,810
DEAL, BUT AS WE GET DEEPER INTO
THE COMMUNICATION THEY HAD I

68
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,890
THINK IT BECOMES MORE
SIGNIFICANT AND RELEVANT, NOT

69
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,020
NECESSARILY IN REGARD TO
POTENTIAL RUSSIAN MEDDLING, BUT

70
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,990
FOR ME IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO DO
AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER OR NOT

71
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,779
WIKILEAKS HAS A POLITICAL
MOTIVE, AND I THINK THESE

72
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,108
COMMUNICATIONS MAKE IT CLEAR
THAT THERE WAS A POLITICAL

73
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,488
MOTIVE TO HELP THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN.

74
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:32,980
SO LET ME GO 
ON --

75
00:04:32,980 --> 00:05:01,630
THAT'S FINE, THAT WAS
INCLUDED IN THE REPORT --

76
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,200
SO THEY ARE SETTING THE STAGE
TO SHOW THAT ALREADY IT SEEMED

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,830
AS THOUGH THERE WAS A POLITICAL
MOTIVE, AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK

78
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,650
AT THE PRIVATE MESSAGES THAT
DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND WIKILEAKS

79
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,640
HAD WITH ONE ANOTHER IT FURTHER
REINFORCES THAT NOTION.

80
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,480
GO AHEAD --

81
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,460
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I THINK
WIKILEAKS WAS ON TRUMP'S SIDE,

82
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,880
AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY
PUBLISHED SOME OF THE EMAILS

83
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,110
RIGHT AFTER THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD
TAPES IS DECENT EVIDENCE OF

84
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,720
THAT, AND THERE IS A LOT OF
EVIDENCE OF IT, INCLUDING ONE

85
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,220
DAMNING PART WE WILL GET TO IN A
SECOND.

86
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,570
SO I'M NOT DISPUTING

87
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,570
THAT.

88
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHO IS
TALKING ABOUT THE STOLEN

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,900
HOLLYWOOD EXCESS TAPES?

90
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,220
AND
WHERE THE WASHINGTON POST GOT

91
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
THEM?

92
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,910
AND WHO WANTED TO
INTERFERE WITH OUR ELECTIONS,

93
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,510
AND GAVE THOSE STOLEN TAPES TO
THE WASHINGTON POST?

94
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,120
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER A
QUESTION THAT A FOREIGN

95
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,590
GOVERNMENT OBTAINED THOSE TAPES
AND LEAKS THEM IN AN EFFORT TO

96
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,980
MEDDLE IN THE ELECTIONS, THERE'S
A DIFFERENCE THERE.

97
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,990
LOOK AT THE FRAMING, THE
EMAILS ARE ALWAYS REFERRED TO AS

98
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,950
STOLEN, THE PENTAGON PAPERS
AREN'T BUT YOU CAN MAKE AN

99
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,780
ARGUMENT, THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD
TAPES ARE NEVER REFERRED TO AS

100
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,340
STOLEN BY THE MEDIA, BUT WHERE
DID THEY GET THEM?

101
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
AND WHO GOT

102
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,340
THEM?

103
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,020
DID THEY HAVE PERMISSION
FROM WHOEVER THE OWNER OF ACCESS

104
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,550
HOLLYWOOD IS?

105
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,510
NO, THEY TOOK THEM
WITHOUT PERMISSION, THERE'S

106
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,880
ANOTHER WORD FOR THAT, STOLEN.

107
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,840
IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT

108
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
TO FRAME IT.

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,450
IF YOU GIVE IT TO THE WASHINGTON
POST, THAT'S AWESOME, THEY

110
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,790
ARE A MEDIA ORGANIZATION, IF
YOU GIVE IT TO WIKILEAKS WE

111
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,930
DON'T LIKE THEM, THEY ARE MEAN,
THEY ARE THE BAD GUYS.

112
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,821
THERE IS OBVIOUSLY MAINSTREAM
MEDIA BIAS AGAINST WIKILEAKS, I

113
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,230
THINK THAT'S WELL KNOWN.

114
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,889
BUT I
WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON WHAT

115
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,490
WIKILEAKS IS TRANSPARENT ABOUT
WHEN THEY ARE MESSAGING DONALD

116
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,351
TRUMP, JR., BECAUSE THEY ARE
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEIR

117
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:55,600
INTENTIONS ARE.

118
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,070
SO REGARDLESS OF
MEDIA BIAS, MEDIA BIAS DOES NOT

119
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:06,160
PLAY A ROLE IN THESE DIRECT
MEDICATIONS, KEEP THAT IN MIND.

120
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,090
SO --

121
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:21,900
DONALD TRUMP, JR.

122
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,290
DID RESPOND
TO THAT, HE SAID --

123
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:30,470
LOOK, I CAN'T STAND THE
TRUMPS, I WORKED SUPER HARD TO

124
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,270
MAKE SURE THEY DIDN'T WIN.

125
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,650
I AM
VERY CLEAR WITH MY PERSPECTIVE.

126
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,139
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH WHAT
DONALD TRUMP, JR.

127
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,139
SAID THERE.

128
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:40,139
IN

129
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,050
FACT, IT'S ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS
THAT THE REST OF THE PRESS GAVE

130
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,150
HILLARY CLINTON A PASS FOR
WANTING TO MURDER WHAT COULD BE

131
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,710
CONSIDERED, I THINK SOMEWHAT
CORRECTLY AN ACCURATELY SO BY

132
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,080
ANA AS SHE POINTED OUT EARLIER,
A POLITICAL OPPONENT.

133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
EVEN IF

134
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,520
YOU GRANT WIKILEAKS IS AN
OPPONENT OF HERS, SHE WANTED TO

135
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,350
MURDER A POLITICAL OPPONENT.

136
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,990
IF
TRUMP HAD SET AT THE WORLD WOULD

137
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,700
HAVE EXPLODED AND YOU KNOW IT.

138
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,380
SHE SAID IT, I DON'T KNOW, WAS

139
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
SHE JOKING?

140
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,699
IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE
SHE WAS. AND EVEN IF TRUMP WAS

141
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,460
JOKING IF HE SAID THAT, IT
WOULD'VE BEEN NEWS 24/7, AND IT

142
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,669
SHOULD BE, BECAUSE TRUMP IS
ABHORRENT AND YOU SHOULDN'T SAY

143
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:17,949
THINGS LIKE THAT.

144
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,540
WHAT I'M
ANNOYED WITH IS WHENEVER

145
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,490
ESTABLISHMENT PUBLICANS OR
DEMOCRATS SAY THINGS LIKE THAT

146
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,240
THEY GET A PASS.

147
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,349
HERE IS MY ISSUE WITH THIS,
THE CONNECTION WITH RUSSIA ISN'T

148
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,308
CLEAR ENOUGH FOR ME, MEANING
THAT OKAY, OR INTELLIGENCE

149
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:40,468
ORGANIZATIONS SAY RUSSIA STOLE
OR HACKED INTO THESE EMAILS, I'M

150
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,938
NOT PERSONALLY CONVINCED BY THAT
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T REALLY

151
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:47,680
SHARED THAT EVIDENCE WITH US
YET, JUST SAYING THAT THEY

152
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,889
BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE ISN'T GOOD
ENOUGH FOR ME.

153
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:50,889
BUT THAT BEING

154
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:54,970
SAID, FOR ME WHAT THIS STORY
COMMUNICATED WAS WIKILEAKS IS

155
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,589
NOT SOME JOURNALISTIC
ORGANIZATION, AND BY THE WAY I

156
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,269
WAS SUPPORTIVE OF WIKILEAKS EVEN
AFTER ALL OF THIS HILLARY

157
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,980
CLINTON STUFF CAME OUT, BECAUSE
MY VIEW OF THEM WAS THEY OBTAIN

158
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,240
DAMNING EVIDENCE THAT SPEAKS
TRUTH TO POWER AND THEY LEAK IT.

159
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,540
TO SAY THAT THERE ARE NEVER ANY
POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS OR BIASES

160
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,019
IS NAœVE, BUT I DID NOT HAVE
PROOF OF HOW DEEP THE BIAS WAS

161
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,640
DURING THIS PAST ELECTION, AND I
THINK THAT IS RELEVANT FOR

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,869
PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AT AN
ORGANIZATION LIKE WIKILEAKS

163
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,870
THINKING THIS IS A CREDIBLE
ORGANIZATION WITH NO POLITICAL

164
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,870
BIAS.

165
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,850
CLEARLY THEY DID, AND
THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO

166
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,570
PROVE IT, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WE
HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO YET.

167
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,161
HOLD ON, I AGREE AND DISAGREE
IN PARTS.

168
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:43,369
THE PART I AGREE WITH,

169
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:50,410
EVEN MIKE POMPEO, TRUMP'S CIA
DIRECTOR, SAYS HE THINK THERE'S

170
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,889
A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE KEY
LEAKS AND RUSSIA.

171
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:54,889
TAKE THAT FOR

172
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,600
WHATEVER IT'S WORTH, IT'S A DATA
POINT AND I DO TAKE THAT

173
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
SERIOUSLY.

174
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,410
AT THE SAME TIME,
ALMOST EVERYBODY THAT WORKS IN

175
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,630
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, BOTH
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS AND

176
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,259
DEMOCRATS, HATE WIKILEAKS WITH A
PASSION, SO I WILL TAKE IT WITH

177
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,259
A GRAIN OF SALT.

178
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,869
ON THE ISSUE OF
WHETHER THEY ARE CREDIBLE

179
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:14,939
JOURNALISTS, THAT'S WHERE I
DISAGREE WITH YOU.

180
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:15,959
YES, I THINK

181
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,189
THIS STORY DOES PROVE THAT THEY
WERE CLEARLY ON TRUMP'S SIDE.

182
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:21,770
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T BE
CREDIBLE, IT DOESN'T MEAN THE

183
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,350
STUFF THEY LEAKED ISN'T TRUE.

184
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,540
IT WAS TRUE.

185
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,410
AND THEY ARE STILL A MEDIA
ORGANIZATION.

186
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,529
BUT THERE IS ALSO THE QUESTION
OF WHAT THEY REFUSED TO LEAK OR

187
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,509
TALK ABOUT, LIKE THE RUSSIAN
OLIGARCHS THAT WERE IMPLICATED

188
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:40,540
IN THE PANAMA PAPERS AND HOW
WIKILEAKS REFUSED TO DO ANY TYPE

189
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,580
OF WORK ON THAT ISSUE.

190
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,639
SO I
THINK THAT THIS COMMUNICATION,

191
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,100
THEIR CLEAR SUPPORT OF THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN COUPLED WITH THE FACT

192
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,500
THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS
THEY REFUSED TO LEAK, DRAWS A

193
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,080
PICTURE THAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT
THEIR CREDIBILITY.

194
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
SO I'M

195
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
PUTTING THAT OUT THERE.

196
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,990
I UNDERSTAND, IF YOU WANT TO
TAKE THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT

197
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,500
THAT'S FINE, I WILL GO EVEN
FURTHER AND SAY THEY HURT THEIR

198
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,709
CREDIBILITY MORE WHEN THEY
AREN'T HONEST ABOUT THEIR

199
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,240
PERSPECTIVE.

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,569
FOX NEWS, THAT'S
FINE, THEY ARE CONSERVATIVES, WE

201
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,579
DON'T LIKE THEM AND I THINK THEY
ARE WRONG ON EACH ISSUE AND WE

202
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,279
DEBATE THEM, THE PROBLEM ISN'T
THAT, THE PROBLEM IS THEY CALL

203
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,999
THEMSELVES FAIR AND BALANCED,
AND THEY AREN'T, THAT'S A JOKE

204
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,319
AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

205
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,700
SO I
WOULD HOPE WIKILEAKS WON'T

206
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,360
CONTINUE TO MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE.

207
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
WHATEVER YOUR

208
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,740
PERSPECTIVE IS YOU SHOULD BE
OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT IT, WE ARE

209
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,290
HONEST ABOUT OUR PERSPECTIVE,
AND I DON'T THINK GIVEN THIS

210
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,269
STORY AMONG OTHERS, I AGREE WITH
ANA THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN OPEN

211
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,490
ABOUT WHAT THERE PERSPECTIVE IS.

212
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,660
LET'S GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT
MORE OF THEIR COMMUNICATION, AND

213
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:52,759
ONE-POINT WIKILEAKS SENT TO
DONALD TRUMP, JR.

214
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,759
--

215
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,139
THEN --

216
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:27,739
IN 

217
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:39,019
THAT CASE, DOES IT SHOW
THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS

218
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,129
COMMUNICATING WITH WIKILEAKS?

219
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,610
YES, OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T

220
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,860
RANDOMLY DO IT 15 MINUTES LATER.

221
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,769
BUT THIS STUFF WAS PUBLIC

222
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:53,499
ANYWAY, AND HAVE JOURNALISTS
SENT OUT THEIR ARTICLES TO THE

223
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:57,050
PEOPLE THEY WROTE ABOUT IN HOPES
THAT IT WOULD BE SHARED ON

224
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,329
SOCIAL MEDIA?

225
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:01,519
ALMOST EVERY TIME,
EVERY DAY.

226
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,160
SO IF ANY OTHER

227
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,230
JOURNALISTS SAID HEY, HERE IS AN
ARTICLE I WROTE ABOUT YOU OR

228
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,199
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE AND SENT IT
TO YOU, IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST

229
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:10,850
NO BIG DEAL OF ALL TIME.

230
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,899
WHEN IT
HAPPENS WITH WIKILEAKS, OH MY

231
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,290
GOD, THEY WANTED THEIR LINK
PUBLICIZED.

232
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,329
OF COURSE THEY DID,

233
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:19,329
SO DOES EVERYONE.

234
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:22,370
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE
SURFACE.

235
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,970
IF IT IS PROVEN THAT

236
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,279
THEY DID NOT OBTAIN THEIR
INFORMATION FROM RUSSIA, THEN

237
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,439
YOU ARE RIGHT, WIKILEAKS
SHOULDN'T BE TREATED ANY

238
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:33,779
DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER MEDIA
ORGANIZATION.

239
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,779
BUT THE CONCERN

240
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,110
HERE IS THAT A FOREIGN
GOVERNMENT IS MEDDLING IN

241
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,129
OUR ELECTION PROCESS AND IF
THAT'S PROVEN I THINK THESE

242
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,190
TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE
RELEVANT.

243
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,980
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I KNOW
IT'S A TOUGH DISTINCTION BUT I

244
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,060
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE --
IF RUSSIA SAYS I STOLE THESE

245
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,819
EMAILS, TRUMP, WOULD YOU LIKE
THEM?

246
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:53,819
I THINK THAT'S A GIANT

247
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:57,339
PROBLEM AND I TALKED ABOUT THAT
IN THE PAST, THAT IS A REAL

248
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,179
ISSUE, IT HAS LEGAL
RAMIFICATIONS AND IT SHOULD BE

249
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,040
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND I'M
THRILLED THEY ARE INVESTIGATING

250
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
IT.

251
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,059
BUT RUSSIA OR ANYONE ELSE
GETS ACCESS TO INFORMATION,

252
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,920
PASSES IT ON TO SOMEONE IN THE
MEDIA --

253
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,040
RUSSIA DIDN'T GET ACCESS TO
THE INFORMATION, THEY

254
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,420
HACKED AND STOLE THE
INFORMATION.

255
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,921
WHATEVER, DANIEL ELLSBERG
STOLE THE PENTAGON PAPERS, HE

256
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:23,120
GOT THEM WITHOUT PERMISSION AND
GAVE THEM TO THE NEW YORK TIMES.

257
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,660
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE WEEK IS
WITHOUT PERMISSION GIVEN TO A

258
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,499
MEMBER OF THE MEDIA AND WE NEVER
COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT, YOU WOULD

259
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:33,259
HAVE TO ARREST THREE QUARTERS OF
WASHINGTON IF THEY WERE ALL

260
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:34,259
STOLEN.

261
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,069
YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT AMERICAN WHISTLEBLOWERS OR

262
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:40,699
AMERICAN LEAKERS, WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF A FOREIGN

263
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:44,269
GOVERNMENT POSSIBLY HAVING AN
IMPACT ON OUR ELECTION.

264
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,179
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT.

265
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:50,589
IF CANADA SOMEHOW GOT SOME
INFORMATION, AND IT WAS SUPER

266
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,040
RELEVANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
SHOULD THE NEW YORK TIMES PRINT

267
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
IT?

268
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,939
MY ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY.

269
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:57,040
IF
YOU DON'T AGREE AND YOU SAY

270
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,079
CANADA, RUSSIA -- NEW YORK TIMES
SHOULD SUPPRESS THE INFORMATION

271
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,741
BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A FOREIGN
GOVERNMENT, EITHER ONE THAT IS

272
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:06,910
FRIENDLY TO US LIKE CANADA OR
ONE THAT ISN'T, LIKE RUSSIA --

273
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,600
OKAY, THOSE ARE FINE POINTS OF
DISAGREEMENT, I SAY THEY SHOULD

274
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,769
PUBLISH IT BECAUSE THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW, I

275
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,459
THINK THERE WAS VALUABLE
INFORMATION IN THOSE EMAILS, I

276
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,389
DON'T THINK THE RUSSIANS SHOULD
HAVE STOLEN IT OR THE TRUMP

277
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,500
PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE WORKED WITH
THE RUSSIANS, THOSE ARE LEGAL

278
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,869
ISSUES, BUT WHEN YOU GIVE IT TO
A MEDIA ORGANIZATION, THE MEDIA

279
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:28,310
ORGANIZATION HAS EVERY RIGHT TO
PRINT IT.

280
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,509
LET'S MOVE ON TO, BY THE WAY,
TWO DAYS AFTER THEY SHARED THAT

281
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,110
LINK WITH DONALD TRUMP, JR.

282
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,649
HE
ALSO TWEETED IT OUT, AGAIN THE

283
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,989
LINK PROVIDED TO HIM BY
WIKILEAKS.

284
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:42,160
MOVING FORWARD, LET'S

285
00:15:42,160 --> 00:16:07,189
GO TO GRAPHIC 23, THIS IS WHEN
THINGS GET INTERESTING --

286
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:12,339
SO THAT IS HONESTLY -- IT
RILED ME UP MORE THAN I EXPECTED

287
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,720
IT TO, BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO
LEAD TO COMPLETE CHAOS AND

288
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,059
TURMOIL IN THE UNITED STATES,
AND YOU ARE NOW PUSHING FOR

289
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,059
THAT.

290
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,730
AND YOU ARE NOW
UNDERMINING AND QUESTIONING THE

291
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,749
ELECTION PROCESS.

292
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:28,049
AND BY THE
WAY, RIGGING IS AN INTERESTING

293
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,060
WORD IN THIS CONTEXT.

294
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,730
THE DNC
WAS DIRTY AS HELL, THERE'S NO

295
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:38,089
DENYING THAT WHATSOEVER, WHAT
THEY DID TO UNDERMINE BERNIE IN

296
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,550
THE PRIMARIES WAS CLEAR AND I
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE

297
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,389
AMERICAN PUBLIC WAS AWARE OF
THAT SO I WAS FINE WITH THOSE

298
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:46,119
LEAKS 100%.

299
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:49,529
HOWEVER THERE'S NO
EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT VOTES

300
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,100
WERE CHANGED OR THAT VOTING
MACHINES WERE HACKED INTO OR

301
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,369
THAT VOTES WERE TAMPERED WITH IN
ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM -- TO ME

302
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:59,189
THAT IS RIGGING.

303
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,939
MANIPULATING
AND RIGGING ARE TWO DIFFERENT

304
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:05,569
THINGS, AND JUST THIS CONSTANT
NARRATIVE COMING OUT DURING THE

305
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,270
ELECTION ABOUT RIGGING -- THERE
WAS NO RIGGING, THERE'S NO PROOF

306
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,619
OF RIGGING.

307
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,219
MANIPULATION BY THE
DNC IN ORDER TO UNDERMINE BERNIE

308
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,019
SANDERS, ABSOLUTELY THERE WAS
EVIDENCE OF THAT, BUT RIGGING?

309
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:20,679
LET'S NOT GET SIDETRACKED
BECAUSE NOW YOU WILL GET ME ON A

310
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,148
WARPATH ON THAT.

311
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:24,828
EVERYBODY HAS A
DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF RIGGING,

312
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,280
PEOPLE KEEP ASSUMING THE OTHER
PERSON HAS THE OTHER DEFINITION.

313
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,529
FOR SOME PEOPLE IT MEANS THE DNC
PICKED ONE SIDE AND HELP THAT

314
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:34,529
SIDE.

315
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,249
THAT DEFINITELY HAPPENED,
DEFINITELY.

316
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,249
THE DNC CHAIR

317
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:39,249
ADMITTED IT.

318
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:41,460
OTHER PEOPLE
LEGITIMATELY THINK RIGGING, THAT

319
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,919
WORD, MEANS ACTUALLY CHANGING
VOTES.

320
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,539
THERE, THERE IS NOT

321
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:50,220
NEARLY ENOUGH EVIDENCE, PEOPLE
WILL SAY I GOT THIS SNAPSHOT --

322
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,080
NOBODY HAS EVER PROVEN THAT.

323
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,590
I
DON'T WANT TO GET SIDETRACKED ON

324
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,810
THAT, AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY
WHEN PEOPLE MAKE DECLARATIVE

325
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,429
STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT THE WORD
RIGGING MEANS.

326
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:00,720
ANYWAY, ON THIS

327
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,390
ISSUE, THAT PARTICULAR
COMMUNICATION WITH DONALD TRUMP,

328
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,350
JR., IT IS DAMNING.

329
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,000
WIKILEAKS,
BY SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T CONCEDE

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,010
THE ELECTION IF YOU LOSE AND YOU
SHOULD CHALLENGE IT, NUMBER ONE

331
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,480
IT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE
A PERSPECTIVE, AND IT MIGHT BE

332
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,279
FINE TO HAVE A PERSPECTIVE, BUT
THEY WERE PRO TRUMP.

333
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,279
NOW IT'S

334
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,279
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR.

335
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,390
AND BY THE
WAY, YOU COULD SAY HEY, IF THE

336
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,000
DEMOCRATS WANTED TO IMPRISON
YOU, DO GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE TO

337
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,281
YOU, AND IN THE CASE OF HILLARY
CLINTON MAYBE MURDER YOU, YOU

338
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:34,809
MIGHT BE PRO TRUMP TOO.

339
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,230
OKAY,
BUT THEY WERE PRO TRUMP.

340
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,230
THAT

341
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,320
COMMUNICATION PROVES IT. AND BY
THE WAY, IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A

342
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,399
PERSPECTIVE, SO THEY WERE PRO
TRUMP.

343
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:46,399
BUT THEY SHOULD BE HONEST

344
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,000
ABOUT IT, AND THEY ARE NOT.

345
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,080
THE
SECOND REASON THAT IS DAMNING

346
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,160
IS, WAIT, WHY DO YOU CARE, THE
ELECTION IS ALREADY OVER, THAT

347
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,649
HE NOT CONCEDE?

348
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:58,770
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU WANT A MESS AND YOU DON'T

349
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,919
CARE IF HE WON THE ELECTION OR
NOT.

350
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,120
THEY DIDN'T SAY IF YOU

351
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,490
THINK YOU WON YOU SHOULDN'T
CONCEDE, THEY SAID YOU SHOULDN'T

352
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,360
CONCEDE TO MATTER WHAT.

353
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,450
WHICH TO
ME SAYS GOD DAMMIT, DID YOU WORK

354
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,929
WITH THE RUSSIANS?

355
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,750
IT'S NOT JUST
THAT YOU GOT ACCESS TO EMAILS

356
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,551
EITHER THROUGH THE RUSSIANS OR
SOMEWHERE ELSE, IT'S THAT YOU

357
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:23,190
ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THEM,
BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS WANT TO

358
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,470
CAUSE A MESS HERE.

359
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,549
THAT IS NOW
ABSOLUTELY PROVEN.

360
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:27,549
THEY HAD THE

361
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:32,090
TROLL FARMS, NOT ONLY DID THEY
DO ALL THE STUFF DURING THE

362
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,830
ELECTION, BUT THEY WOULD SET UP
FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS THAT WERE

363
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,390
SEEMINGLY LIBERAL AND SEEMINGLY
CONSERVATIVE, THEY WOULD TRY TO

364
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,930
GET US TO FIGHT AND RIP US
APART.

365
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,930
WHAT IS A GOOD WAY TO RIP

366
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,930
US APART?

367
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,890
DON'T CONCEDE THE
ELECTION, SAY NO MATTER WHAT

368
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,250
HAPPENED ON WHEN TO FIGHT
ANYWAY.

369
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,059
WHY IS WIKILEAKS SAYING

370
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,059
THAT?

371
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:56,490
IF YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP
IS WONDERFUL AND YOU WANT HIM TO

372
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,490
WIN THAT'S ONE THING, YOU WANT
TO RIP THE COUNTRY APART?

373
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,490
FOR

374
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,490
WHAT REASON?

375
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,430
I KNOW THE RUSSIANS
WANT TO RIP US APART BECAUSE

376
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,210
THAT'S ALREADY ON THE RECORD,
AND ALL DIFFERENT WAYS HAVE BEEN

377
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,450
PROVEN THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO
DO THAT.

378
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,450
SO TO ME THAT

379
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,169
PARTICULAR MESSAGE IS REALLY
DAMNING FOR WIKILEAKS, AND IT'S

380
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,850
A SHAME.

381
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,769
BECAUSE THEY PUBLISH
REALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION, AND

382
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,539
I WISH THEY WOULD JUST DO THAT,
AND AGAIN, I DON'T EVEN MIND IF

383
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:27,860
THEY WENT AN EXTRA STEP AND HAD
A PERSPECTIVE.

384
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
BUT TO NOT BE

385
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,470
HONEST ABOUT IT AND TO
POTENTIALLY WORK WITH THE

386
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,639
RUSSIANS TO TRY TO SPLIT US
APART, DAMMIT, WHY DID YOU DO

387
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:36,279
THAT?

388
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,809
BY THE WAY THAT'S NOT
CONCLUSIVE, BUT IT IS AN

389
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:41,750
IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE, AND
DENYING THAT IT IS IMPORTANT IS

390
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,750
RIDICULOUS.

391
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,210
IT IS IMPORTANT.

392
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,710
I ALSO WANT TO QUICKLY NOTE
THAT THEY KEPT URGING TRUMP TO

393
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,370
GIVE HIS TAX RETURNS TO
WIKILEAKS SO THEY COULD

394
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,269
ESSENTIALLY, I'M PARAPHRASING
WHAT THEY SAID, BUT CONTROL THE

395
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,340
MESSAGING AROUND HIS TAX
RETURNS.

396
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,059
BECAUSE WIKILEAKS WAS

397
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,889
UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT
WOULD EVENTUALLY GET LEAKED

398
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:05,650
ANYWAY AND IT WOULD BE BETTER IF
WIKILEAKS HANDLED IT AS OPPOSED

399
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,320
TO A MEDIA ORGANIZATION LIKE
MSNBC OR THE NEW YORK TIMES.

400
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,100
90% OF THAT I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH.

401
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,710
THEY ARE SAYING, GIVE US

402
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,140
HER TAX RETURNS AND WE WILL
PUBLISH THEM.

403
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,140
EVERY MEDIA

404
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,639
ORGANIZATION WOULD HAVE DONE
LIKEWISE.

405
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:20,639
MAYBE THEY WERE EVEN

406
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:21,639
TRICKING TRUMP.

407
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:25,789
JULIAN ASSANGE
IS NOW ARGUING AFTER THE FACT, I

408
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:30,270
WAS TRYING TO TRICK HIM INTO
GIVING ME THE TAX RETURNS.

409
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,270
TWO

410
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,370
OTHER JOURNALISTS DO THAT?

411
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,370
YES.

412
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,510
THE ONLY ISSUE THERE IS THEY

413
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,610
SAID SO WE CAN IMPROVE THE
PERCEPTION OF OUR IMPARTIALITY

414
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,960
AND WE WOULDN'T BE PERCEIVED AS
COMING FROM A PRO TRUMP OR

415
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,750
PRO-RUSSIA SOURCE.

416
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,019
IF YOU ARE
SAYING WE ARE ON YOUR SIDE BUT

417
00:21:52,019 --> 00:22:00,080
WE WANT TO APPEAR NOT TO BE ON
YOUR SIDE, THAT'S A DISHONEST

418
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
ACTOR.

419
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
THAT'S A SHAME.

420
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,789
THERE IS A LOT OF OTHER STUFF,
BUT LET'S SHORTEN THIS A LITTLE

421
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:10,480
BIT -- ONE OF THE FINAL MESSAGES
THAT WAS SENT TO DONALD TRUMP,

422
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
JR.

423
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,940
-- BY THE WAY AT SOME POINT
HE JUST STOPPED RESPONDING, AND

424
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,500
AT THIS POINT HE HAD STOPPED --

425
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:37,679
THIS 

426
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,250
WAS -- LOOK, MY READ OF
IT WAS IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO KIND

427
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,049
OF LET ASSANGE OFF ON SOME OF
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR RAPE

428
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,841
ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE LODGED
AGAINST HIM, MAYBE THIS WAS A

429
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:52,669
WAY TO GET OUT OF IT, I DON'T
KNOW.

430
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:53,669
BUT IT WAS INTERESTING

431
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:57,409
BECAUSE IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY
WANTED SOMETHING IN RETURN

432
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,559
FOR WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

433
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,970
ASSANGE WANTS TO GET THE HELL
OUT OF THE PRISON HE'S BEEN PUT

434
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,929
INTO BY THE WESTERN GOVERNMENTS,
I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT.

435
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,929
IS

436
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,179
THIS A WACKY SCHEME TO DO THAT?

437
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,169
YES, IT'S PARTICULARLY WACKY.

438
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:18,010
AND THEY KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO
WORK, BUT IT'S ABOUT FRAMING.

439
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,179
OKAY, YOU WORK WITH THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN FOR YOUR OWN PURPOSES,

440
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,580
AND I GET IT, BUT I WISH YOU HAD
BEEN WAY MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT

441
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,580
THAT.

442
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,919
THE WHOLE POINT OF
WIKILEAKS IS TRANSPARENCY, AND I

443
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,470
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH
THEM NOT BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT

444
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,380
THEIR MOTIVES AND WHO THEY
SUPPORTED IN THE CAMPAIGN.

445
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,289
HAVING SAID THAT, AS I'VE BEEN
SAYING THROUGHOUT THIS PIECE,

446
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:44,000
8 OUT OF 10 OF THESE ALLEGATIONS
THAT EVERYONE IS TREATING

447
00:23:44,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AS BOMBSHELLS, THE REST OF THE
PRESS DOES ON A DAILY BASIS.
