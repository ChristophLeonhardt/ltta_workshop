1
00:00:01,323 --> 00:00:02,224
WOULD HAVE REMAINED.

2
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:03,058
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:03,959
>> THANK YOU.

4
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,093
>> Tucker: BESIDES CHRISTINE

5
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:06,127
FORD AND KAVANAUGH HIMSELF,

6
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:06,795
THE CHIEF FIGURE IN THE

7
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,097
HEARING TODAY WAS THE ARIZONA

8
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:10,232
PROSECUTOR RACHEL MITCHELL.

9
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:11,366
DID SHE ASK THE RIGHT

10
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:15,036
QUESTIONS OR MISS ANYTHING

11
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:15,804
IMPORTANT?

12
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:17,305
POSSIBLY RHETORICAL QUESTION.

13
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,307
WE HAVE THE NATIONAL

14
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:22,477
COORDINATOR FOR NATIONAL

15
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:23,378
CHILDHOOD INTRADICTION AND SHE

16
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,079
JOINS US TONIGHT.

17
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,313
I WATCHED THE HEARINGS AND I

18
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:28,850
KEPT THINKING HOW ALONE BRETT

19
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,421
KAVANAUGH WAS.

20
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,989
I AM NOT ATTACKING THE

21
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:34,890
PROSECUTOR WHO ASKED IN THE

22
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,058
FIRST HALF BUT KAVANAUGH SEEMS

23
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,926
TO BE THE ONLY ONE MAKING A

24
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:39,194
CASE FOR KAVANAUGH.

25
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:40,629
>> YOU KNOW, TUCKER,

26
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:41,696
UNFORTUNATELY I AGREE WITH

27
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:42,097
YOU.

28
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,832
ALTHOUGH THE WAY I LOOK AT IT

29
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:48,403
IS THAT KAVANAUGH WAS THE ONLY

30
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:49,704
PERSON EVERYONE TRYING TO

31
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:51,039
CHALLENGE THE ALLEGATIONS,

32
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,441
WHICH I THINK IS THE ROLE OF

33
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:52,941
MISS MITCHELL.

34
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:54,977
SHE DID A COUPLE THINGS WELL,

35
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,278
ESTABLISHING POSSIBLE

36
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:57,546
POLITICAL BIAS IN THE SENSE OF

37
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:59,181
THE DELAY OF THE HEARING.

38
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:00,349
THIS RIDICULOUS ALLEGATION

39
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:02,184
THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO FLY.

40
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:03,952
SHE CERTAINLY BLEW THAT OUT OF

41
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:06,188
THE WATER.

42
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:09,992
AND THE ELUCIDATION OF THE

43
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:11,093
ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT

44
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:14,429
DR. FORD DELAYED IN HER OWN

45
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:15,664
WORD COMING FORWARD WITH THE

46
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:16,064
INFORMATION.

47
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,900
SHE SAID THAT SHE KNEW ABOUT

48
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,434
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S POSITION ON

49
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:21,136
THE SHORT LIST AND THAT SHE

50
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:23,672
WAS DETERMINED TO PREVENT HIS

51
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:24,807
NOMINATION.

52
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:27,843
YET, SOMEHOW THIS Ph.D. WAS

53
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:28,844
UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

54
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:30,579
CALL EITHER OF HER TWO

55
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:31,013
SENATORS.

56
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:33,182
BOTH OF WHOM SIT ON THE

57
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:34,416
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

58
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,751
MISS MITCHELL DID A GOOD JOB

59
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:36,952
WITH THAT BUT WHEN IT CAME TO

60
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:39,555
ASKING ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS I

61
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:40,989
WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE TOLD

62
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:42,224
DR. FORD SHE WOULD NOT BE

63
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:44,393
ASKING HER ABOUT THE

64
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,028
ALLEGATIONS AT ALL.

65
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:48,697
AND SHE DIDN'T.

66
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:49,198
>> Tucker: RIGHT.

67
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:50,699
LIKE BUYING A NEW CAR AND NOT

68
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:52,101
MENTIONING A PRICE.

69
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:53,903
ON THE PLANE THING, SHE

70
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:54,603
ESTABLISHED THAT CHRSTINE

71
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:58,274
BLASEY FORD HAS FLOWN AN AWFUL

72
00:01:58,274 --> 00:01:58,707
LOT.

73
00:01:58,707 --> 00:01:59,942
SHE COULD HAVE TEASED OUT IS

74
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:01,310
WHY SHE LIED ABOUT IT IN THIS

75
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,677
CASE.

76
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:03,946
WE CAN'T COME TO WASHINGTON TO

77
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:05,047
TESTIFY BECAUSE SHE CAN'T GET

78
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:05,981
ON AN AIRPLANE.

79
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,183
THIS HAD A POLITICALLY

80
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:08,083
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT.

81
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:13,022
DELAYING THE CONFIRMATION OF

82
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:15,324
KAVANAUGH.

83
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:16,158
THAT IS LIE.

84
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,493
WHY IS NOBODY SAYING THAT?

85
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:18,594
>> I DON'T KNOW.

86
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,162
I THOUGHT JUDGE KAVANAUGH DID

87
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:21,597
A BRILLIANT JOB EXPLAINING

88
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:22,698
WHAT THE DELAY MEANT TO HIM,

89
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:24,200
HIS FAMILY AND HIS REPUTATION

90
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,503
AND THEIR FUTURE.

91
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:28,404
PROSECUTORS LIKE TO SAY DON'T

92
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:29,405
ASK A QUESTION YOU DON'T KNOW

93
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:30,906
THE ANSWER TO.

94
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:33,209
SO DON'T ASK A WHY QUESTION?

95
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,910
ALL TRAINED PROSECUTORS KNOW

96
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,911
THAT IS GARBAGE.

97
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,481
YOU HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS YOU

98
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,116
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO.

99
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,751
IN EVERY TRIAL YOU OFTEN DON'T

100
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:42,618
KNOW THE ANSWER.

101
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:43,919
SHE SHOULD HAVE CHALLENGED

102
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,822
DR. FORD AND SHE DID NOT.

103
00:02:46,822 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: I NOTICED.
