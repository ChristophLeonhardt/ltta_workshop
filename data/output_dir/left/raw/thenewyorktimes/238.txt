1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,190
“Mr. Zuckerberg, would
you be comfortable

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,814
sharing with us the name of the
hotel you stayed in last night?”

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,340
“Um —

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,520
no.”

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,090
“If you’ve messaged
anybody this week,

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,910
would you share with us
the names of the people

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,910
you’ve messaged?”

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,480
“Senator, no,

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,340
I would probably not choose
to do that publicly here.”

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,416
“I think that may be
what this is all about.”

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,020
“In 2015, we heard the report
that this developer

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,750
Aleksandr Kogan had sold data to
Cambridge Analytica.”

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,290
“Did you or senior
leadership do an inquiry

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,800
to find out who at Facebook
had this information

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,580
and did they not have
a discussion about

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,580
whether or not the users
should be informed

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,090
back in December of 2015?”

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,880
“Senator, in retrospect,

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,690
I think we clearly
view it as a mistake

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,560
that we didn’t inform people.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,250
And we did that based
on false information

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,060
that we thought that
the case was closed,

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,518
and that the data
had been deleted.”

24
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:14,410
“So there was a decision
made on that basis

25
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,860
not to inform the
users. Is that correct?”

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,430
“That’s my understanding, yes.”

27
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,860
“I assume Facebook’s
been served with subpoenas

28
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,600
from the special
counsel Mueller’s office.

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,780
Is that correct?”

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,510
“Yes.

31
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,600
Actually, let
me clarify that.

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,270
I actually am not
aware of a subpoena.

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,900
I believe that there may be.

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,660
But I know we’re
working with them.”

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,500
“Thank you.”

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,120
“If I buy a Ford and it
doesn’t work well

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,300
and I don’t like it,
I can buy a Chevy.

38
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,620
If I’m upset
with Facebook,

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,240
what’s the equivalent product
that I can go sign up for?”

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,750
“The average American
uses eight different apps —”

41
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,070
“O.K.”

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,410
“— to communicate
with their friends

43
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,830
and stay in touch with people —”

44
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,240
“O.K.”

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,033
“— ranging from text apps —”

46
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:55,626
“— which is —”

47
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:56,350
— to email.”

48
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,755
“Which is the same
service you provide.”

49
00:01:57,755 --> 00:01:58,820
“Well, we provide
a number of different services.”

50
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,020
“Is Twitter the
same as what you do?”

51
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,800
“It overlaps with a portion of what we do.”

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,100
“You don’t think you have
a monopoly?”

53
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,550
“It certainly doesn’t
feel like that to me.”

54
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,419
“O.K.”

55
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,720
[audience laughs]

56
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,470
“Do you need to look
behind shell corporations

57
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,350
in order to find
out who is really

58
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,740
behind the content
that’s being posted?

59
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,740
And if you may need to look
behind a shell corporation,

60
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,420
how will you go
about doing that?

61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,730
How will you get
back to the true,

62
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,220
what lawyers would
call ‘beneficial owner’

63
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,800
of the site that is putting
out the political material?”

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,090
“So what we’re going to do is require
a valid government identity

65
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,970
and we’re going to
verify the location.

66
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,270
So we’re going to do that,

67
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,140
so that way someone sitting
in Russia, for example,

68
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,710
couldn’t say that
they’re in America

69
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,920
and therefore able
to run an election ad.”

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,470
“But if they were running
through a corporation domiciled

71
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,320
in Delaware, you wouldn’t
know that they were actually

72
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,507
a Russian owner.”

73
00:02:57,507 --> 00:00:00,000
“Senator, that’s— that’s correct.”
