1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:03,385
THE CHARGE CONTRADICTS HER CLAIM

2
00:00:03,386 --> 00:00:04,887
BY THE PEOPLE THAT SHE SUPPLIED.

3
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:08,524
>> SO YOU WERE POINTING OUT,

4
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:09,224
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" HAS

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:09,925
JUST RELEASED AN EDITORIAL BY

6
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:13,028
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

7
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:15,831
HE SAYS, I AM AN INDEPENDENT

8
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:16,865
TOURIST, INDEPENDENT JUDGE.

9
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:20,302
HE SAYS AT THE TOP OF IT IN

10
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:21,070
ITALICS, HE SAID WHEN I SPOKE IN

11
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,172
THAT HEARING, HE'S BEEN

12
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:25,841
CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO EMOTIVE

13
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:29,745
AND TOO ANGRY.

14
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:32,915
>> THE ARTICLE FOR TO BY BRETT

15
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,917
KAVANAUGH IS ON

16
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:35,551
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

17
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:36,785
WEBSITE RIGHT NOW AND IT WILL BE

18
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,088
IN TOMORROW'S PAPER AND IS

19
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,590
ESSENTIALLY AND DEFENSE OF HIS

20
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:43,425
TEMPERAMENT.

21
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,060
HE SAID WHEN I SPOKE OF THE

22
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:45,761
DEMOCRATS I WAS PROTECTING MY

23
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:49,565
FAMILY AND MY NAME AND I

24
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:50,299
PROBABLY SAID A FEW THINGS THAT

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,900
I MAY BE SHOULD NOT HAVE.

26
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,335
BUT I'M MAKING IT CLEAR, I

27
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,337
BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW AND

28
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,272
I'M AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE.

29
00:00:57,273 --> 00:01:00,442
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPARTIAL

30
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:02,778
JUDGE AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO

31
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:04,213
SO.

32
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:12,221
>> HE IS ALREADY, AND THIS IS

33
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:16,225
ALL JUST PAYBACK FOR THE

34
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:23,799
CLINTONS, AND, THIS IS JUST

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,235
PROOF THAT WE JUST WANT TO GET

36
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:29,171
RID OF HIM NO MATTER WHAT.

37
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,306
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO GET RID OF

38
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:39,047
HIM, IT'S UP PERSONAL SMEAR.

39
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:39,748
THAT'S THE TEMPERAMENT THAT'S

40
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:40,048
WRONG.

41
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,784
I THOUGHT THAT ACTUALLY SEEING

42
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:45,287
THAT HUMAN SIDE OF HIM, WAS

43
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,288
COMFORTING TO ME.

44
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,691
IF HE HAD GONE UP THERE AND GONE

45
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,726
VERY ROBOTIC AND UNEMOTIONAL, I

46
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:52,728
THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EVEN

47
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,829
MORE DAMAGING TO HIM THAN WHAT

48
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,498
HE DID.

49
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:57,733
MAYBE YOU COULD SAY HE SHOULDN'T

50
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:02,137
HAVE HAD THE EXCHANGE HE PAD

51
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:03,605
WITH THE SENATOR, WHICH IS

52
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:11,780
PROBABLY TRUE.

53
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,882
AND, AS BILL SAYS, THERE'S

54
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,117
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OF THESE

55
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,318
CHARGES.

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,487
THAT WOULD MAKE ANYONE SERIOUS.

57
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:20,656
>> THIS ISN'T GOING TO END.

58
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:21,890
WE SAW THE PROTESTERS IN

59
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,959
WASHINGTON SO EVEN IF HE DOES

60
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,094
SECURE HIS SEAT ON THE

61
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,095
SUPREME COURT AS A JUSTICE, I'M

62
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:28,897
IMAGINING THAT THE DAY HE HAS

63
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,365
HIS FIRST DAY IN COURT, THOSE

64
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,101
STEPS ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE

65
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:33,902
FLOODED WITH PROTESTERS.

66
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,738
I THINK THIS WILL BE VERY

67
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,306
INVIGORATING IN SOME WAYS TO

68
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:38,673
DEMOCRATS.

69
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:40,909
>> I THINK IT IS BUT I THINK

70
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,912
IT'S BEEN INVIGORATING THROUGH

71
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,946
REPUBLICANS, JUST FROM MY

72
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,681
INFORMAL NONPOLITICAL CONTACTS,

73
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:49,818
FROM WHAT PEOPLE SAY, ESPECIALLY

74
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,418
THE MOMS WHO HAVE SONS.

75
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,988
AND I THINK MARY ASKED A GOOD

76
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:53,521
POINT.

77
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:56,157
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO OWE BRETT

78
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:57,092
KAVANAUGH APOLOGIES FOR THEIR

79
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,093
BEHAVIOR.

80
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,394
THE WAY THEY THROW AROUND UP

81
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:04,466
SUBSTANTIATED CHARGES, AND I'D

82
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:08,503
LIKE TO KNOW, WHEN HE GAVE THAT

83
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:09,871
SPEECH, I WANTED TO STAND UP AND

84
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:10,272
CHEER.

85
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,208
I KNOW HIM, I KNOW HIS WIFE, AND

86
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,478
I KNOW HIS KIDS.

87
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,047
I KNOW THAT'S NOT RIGHT, BUT

88
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,482
WHAT IS THE PROPER COMPORTMENT

89
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:22,851
FOR A MAN ACCUSED OF GAINING

90
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,686
RAPE WITH NO EVIDENCE?

91
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:27,489
I MEAN -- >> IT IS PRETTY TOUGH.

92
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,691
IN TERMS OF WHAT BILL TOUCHES

93
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,893
ON, DAN, HOW THE PRESS HAS

94
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:33,294
HANDLED THIS, BECAUSE THE PRESS

95
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:34,495
HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR HAVING A

96
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,698
PRETTY LOW BAR FOR WHAT COULD BE

97
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,031
PRINTED.

98
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:38,700
YOU KNOW WE HAVE LETTERS FROM

99
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:47,542
FRIENDS AND, I SAW HIM STAND

100
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:48,009
NEAR THE PUNCH.

101
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,476
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

102
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:49,110
>> THE THING IS THEY KEEP

103
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,378
REPEATING EVERY STORY WRITTEN

104
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,113
THAT THE DETAILS OF THE

105
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:53,047
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BRETT

106
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:53,748
KAVANAUGH, WHICH HAS AN EFFECT

107
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:56,717
AFTER A WHILE.

108
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:58,686
PEOPLE THINK THERE IS SOMETHING

109
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:01,255
HERE, AND FOR THAT REASON HE HAD

110
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,490
TO STAND UP AND DEFEND HIMSELF.

111
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:04,358
IF NOBODY IN THE PRESS WAS GOING

112
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:08,629
TO DO IT FOR HIM.

113
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,365
AND IN A LARGE PART, HE FEELS

114
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,166
HE'S GOT TO DEFEND HIMSELF

115
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,534
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO SUPPORT

116
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:21,675
WHATSOEVER IN THE PRESS.

117
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:23,944
WE HAVEN'T SEEN REALLY A MAN WHO

118
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:27,715
SORT OF FOUGHT BACK AND ONE.

119
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:30,251
SO KEEP IN MIND, THESE ARE NOT

120
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:32,186
CORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS, BUT

121
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:33,320
BASICALLY INSINUATION HAS BEEN

122
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:34,889
ACCUSATION, HAS BEEN AN

123
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,891
INDICTMENT IN THESE CASES.

124
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:38,092
QUICK THOUGHTS ON THAT?

125
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,661
>> WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THAT, WE

126
00:04:40,662 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE THE DUKE LACROSSE, THE
