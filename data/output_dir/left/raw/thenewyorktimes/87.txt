1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,300
There’s a lot of talk
that the new Supreme Court,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,680
one with two
Trump justices on it,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,430
might overturn Roe v. Wade.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,910
So the court can’t just
wake up one morning and say,

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,590
we’re overruling
Roe v. Wade.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,390
I think supporters
of abortion rights

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,700
are right to be nervous,
but they’re maybe not

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,620
exactly right about
how to be nervous,

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,280
what to be nervous about.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,060
It’s a shorthand, sure,
to say Roe v. Wade can

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,310
be overruled,
but that’s not the only,

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,090
or even the
most likely, outcome.

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,180
Let me take you through
the possible scenarios.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,440
Let’s call the first
category the nuclear options.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,770
These are the most extreme
and, therefore,

16
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,800
least likely scenarios.

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,400
The first one would
flip Roe on its head.

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,230
Roe says there’s a
constitutional right

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,190
to abortion.

20
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,460
The court could say the
Constitution prohibits

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,880
abortion in the interest
of protecting fetal life.

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,760
That would suggest that fetal
life is like any other life,

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,650
so that taking it
away would be murder.

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,280
So if the court were to go in
that very unlikely direction,

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,010
abortion would be outlawed
across the nation,

26
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,810
and women could
not get abortions

27
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,459
in the United States legally.

28
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,160
A second nuclear option
would be for the court

29
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,250
to do away with the right
to privacy established

30
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,935
in a case called
Griswold in 1965.

31
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:16,545
“The individual is entitled
to some private sector.”

32
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:20,030
That right to privacy is the
foundation for Roe v. Wade.

33
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,860
If the right to
privacy goes,

34
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,410
it would do away with the
basis for Roe v. Wade

35
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,420
and, therefore,
Roe v. Wade itself

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,310
and flip the issue
back to the states

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,040
and allow states to regulate
abortion as they wish.

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,050
The right to privacy
has been, and could be,

39
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,540
the foundation
of many rights,

40
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,640
so I don’t think it’s
likely the court will go

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,690
after the right to privacy.

42
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,540
A second possibility, and the
one everyone’s talking about,

43
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,533
is the court could
overrule Roe v. Wade.

44
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:48,032
Protesters: “Ho, ho,
Roe v. Wade has got to go.

45
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey, hey, ho, ho.”

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,430
So in a post-Roe world,
you still have a right

47
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,490
to privacy.

48
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,130
But that right to
privacy does not

49
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,440
include a constitutional
right to abortion.

50
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,540
States would be free
to do what they wanted.

51
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,720
And some advocacy groups say
perhaps 22 states could make

52
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,730
abortion illegal entirely.

53
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,552
That’s probably not going
to happen anytime soon.

54
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:08,527
Protesters: “Hey, hey,
Roe v. Wade

55
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:09,989
is here to stay.”

56
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,540
Chief Justice John Roberts
is an incrementalist.

57
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,580
He takes things step by step,

58
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,350
and I don’t think
his first impulse

59
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,530
is going to be, let’s overrule
Roe v. Wade when there

60
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,430
are other ways
to get from here

61
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,820
to most of the way there.

62
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,040
The last scenario, and
the most likely one,

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,590
is for the court to chip
away at Roe v. Wade.

64
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,750
The court has already
upheld some restrictions

65
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,500
on abortion.

66
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,960
“The 5 to 4 majority
upheld a ban

67
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,070
on performing abortions
in public facilities.”

68
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,160
“The U.S. Supreme Court today
upheld the nationwide ban

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,382
on partial-birth abortion.”

70
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:42,570
“Medication abortion is
now effectively blocked

71
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,740
in Arkansas.”

72
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,530
Much more severe restrictions
on abortion rights

73
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,380
are a perfectly
imaginable scenario when

74
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,120
we have a new Supreme Court.

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,950
Here’s how that could happen.

76
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,450
States cannot impose
an undue burden

77
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,090
on women’s right to abortion.

78
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,830
That’s a fairly
malleable standard,

79
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,840
and it wouldn’t be hard
for the Supreme Court

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,940
to keep it in place,
but interpret it

81
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,890
slightly differently
and say states

82
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,007
can impose such restrictions.

83
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,340
A couple of years
ago, the court

84
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,480
heard a case from Texas.

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,389
And had the court
sustained the Texas law,

86
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,430
the number of clinics in
Texas would have dropped

87
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,530
from about 40 to about 10.

88
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,710
And that could rapidly
diminish the ability of women

89
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,030
to get abortions because
the nearest abortion clinic,

90
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,450
at a minimum, could
be hundreds of miles away.

91
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,640
It’s a little hard to
answer exactly what life

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,320
will look like
in a given state

93
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,690
because we’ll have
a patchwork of laws.

94
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,990
But what’s for sure is
that women in red states,

95
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,210
and particularly poor
women in red states,

96
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,360
will have a much harder
time getting abortions

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
as each successive abortion
restriction is sustained

98
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,000
by a court that
now has a solidly

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:00:00,000
conservative majority.
