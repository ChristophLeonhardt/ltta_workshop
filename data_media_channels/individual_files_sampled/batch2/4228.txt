Marcia Griffin she is with the american academy of pediatrics focuses on immigrant health you can in these centers tell me what it's like it's horrible so i can tell you that one time I went in with several attorneys that were immigration attorneys but it was in the old processing center which is even worse than this this facility was built in 2014 to house the number of unaccompanied families there because of the crisis and this facility is so much better than the other one we were I bring pediatricians and physicians down here to see immigration on the border so this isn't New Year saying it's always been there's no not this level of separation not the zero tolerance that's brand-new but this facility has been here we toured it in 2016 went through it and what we were shocked at there was that day there was 700 children in the chain-link enclosures and they were definitely quiet when we went in there they were not asleep they were definitely quiet in these cages and we were shocked so these have existed before but now it's being supercharged in zero tolerance and what do you think the impact will be the impact on the children yes has been documented it's going to be horrific and we have loads of literature that document at this level of complex toxic stress will have long lasting and short effects on their health and well-being that their brain structure will change in a very young child their separation anxiety will be hiding their attachment with their parents because they couldn't protect them who will be injured and that takes long time to rebuild we can't rebuild what is being the damage that's being done to their bodies as pink thank you so much hey there are Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
