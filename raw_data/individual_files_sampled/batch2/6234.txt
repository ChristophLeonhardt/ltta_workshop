Microsoft has alerted authorities in regard to a number of websites fake websites that were run by Russian hackers now these were Russian hackers who were traced back to Russian intelligence meaning the Russian government Microsoft detected and seized these websites created by hackers linked to the Russian unit formerly known as the GRU meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials now some of you might be thinking like that's odd so they're now targeting Republicans yes but it's not that odd when you look into what kind of Republicans they're going after they're going after Republicans who have openly criticized Putin openly criticized Russia openly criticized Trump Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate but not specific Senate offices or political campaigns it was noted by Microsoft that as many as eighty four of these websites have been seized and disabled also the Hudson Institute has promoted programs examining the rise of kleptocracy in governments around the world with Russia as the prime target also the International Republican Institute Board of Directors includes several Republican leaders who have been highly critical of Trump's interactions with Putin specifically the interactions that they had at in Helsinki so this is a really important story a serious story and it has very bad implications for Donald Trump but first let's have fun I can't get past the fact that all these serious stories about the Russian hackers go back to a thing called fancy bear yeah the one doing the hacking is fancy bear and he's spearfishing it almost sounds fun hey let's go spearfishing with fancy bear it sounds like something OMG was boy oMG would do and and they went after two Republicans think tanks we have Putin on tape talking about it okay now back to serious stuff I think they messed with the wrong guys and I'll tell you why you could picking on Democrats all day long and they're soft and oftentimes week and you could push them around and then the press you know to be fair been tough on this Russia situation etc but wait you know overall respect the right wing more the press thus right so now when John McCain and other Republicans come out and conservative think tanks which are greatly respected I think horribly wrong in their getting that level of respect in Washington but they are can they come out and go no no no now they're coming after us that's unacceptable then all of the establishment the Democrats and the Republicans agree mmm can't have this now on the International Republican Institute of Sport sits six serving senators Plus Mitt Romney who likely will be a senator soon by the way Plus general McMaster who was in Trump's administration a very important role he's no longer in that role partly because he was so harsh against Russia so now you've made a lot of Republican enemies who do you think votes on impeachment so it's one thing when you're Trump is lambasted Democrats and going after him day in and day out it's another thing when you're going after Democrats and Republicans and all of a sudden you wake up one day and realize you got no allies left so Russia you keep hacking into a Republican think tanks and senators etc because at some point you got no leg to stand on yeah Trump is really you know he's focusing on the fear-mongering necessary to defeat Democrats in the upcoming midterms so one of the things that he is focusing on is hey if the blue wave really happens Democrats are gonna call for open borders they're gonna be in favor of more crime in the country you're gonna you're gonna have to protect yourself against these you know dangerous criminal immigrants and so look to me for some at least that that signals oh it's just normal campaigning right this is what Trump does but he's really beefing it up and and for me it seems as though he's panicking because you're right impeachment is really contingent upon who controls Congress and if you are making enemies with Republicans you're in a bad place but if you have a bunch of Democrats who are willing to vote on impeaching you then you're in a lot of trouble yeah so I want to be clear about this too I now this is fantasy bear doing it it's a it appears to be the Russian government that doesn't mean trumpet ask them to do it no I would be surprised at that level of collusion collaboration whatever you want to call it I'd be really surprised now on the other hand is Trump are covering up for the Russians non-stop an interview this week remember after all that stuff in Helsinki and then he'd backpedal to look like no no no I didn't say the Russians didn't interfere I didn't say that right in an interview where the orders on Monday just yesterday he said molars investigation quote played right into the Russia's if it was Russia they played right into the Russians hands why would they be playing the Russians hands they're investigating right that makes no sense but if you notice in the middle is that if it was Russia I'm not saying it was Russia because that Putin would be mad I'm not saying it was Russia I'm not saying it okay you're so pathetic so but either way Donald Trump attacks Republicans like John McCain and corker and flake and some of those guys might be retiring but he Lindsey Graham from time to time he attacks he attacks his own Attorney General he attacked McMaster when he worked for him he constantly attacks fellow Republicans meanwhile Russia Russia's trying to hack into Republicans they already did all the damage they can to Democrats so that's because look Russia's having fun for them it's operation chaos either way so either Trump works for them great or even if that's not true at least they caused chaos and that's a he that was the original intent of their operation in the first place right and they're succeeding in that yes so even if the all this falls apart for Trump or the Republicans they're still accomplishing at least part of their mission right but for Trump he's too stupid to realize that Republicans vote Beach Minh and if all the Democrats vote one way and even if you just break off a couple of Republican senators well you're in a world of trouble son but today Michael Cohen said you directed him to break laws in regards to campaign finance you think you don't need those Republican senators of course you do you fool so keep on attacking them publicly and your buddies in Russia can try to hack into them and see how that turns out for you did you know the TYT network is now
