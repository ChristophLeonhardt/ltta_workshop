it's in my hair and my hands it's in my
mouth as I talk it's in my feet as I
walk it's in the gap of air between
faces and conversation the urge is a
reaction a retreat it's in the faces of
everyone I meet it's in my pan as I fry
it's in my drip as I die it's in those
beautiful moments of soundless exchange
it was in those registers in those
called names it can hold me hastily mid
hope but it's okay I'll cope because
sometimes all I want is less of it in
those spaces between significance or in
pain
it comes in frames or spans but we never
seem to have it in our hands and you got
the I haven't got the lost track of the
why does nobody seemed to know where it
is
maybe we spent it or saved it
we'll just plain sat on it
you
