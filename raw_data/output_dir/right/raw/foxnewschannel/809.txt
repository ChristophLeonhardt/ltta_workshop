1
00:00:01,096 --> 00:00:02,531
What's in
your wallet?

2
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,173
>> Shannon: THE PRESIDENT

3
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:11,841
DEFENDING HIS ADMINISTRATION

4
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:12,808
ZERO-TOLERANCE IMMIGRATION

5
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:13,843
POLICY, OVERSHADOWING ANOTHER

6
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:14,577
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT UNDER ANY

7
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:16,111
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE

8
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:17,313
MADE MAJOR NEWS.

9
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:19,081
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO CREATE A

10
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,850
SIXTH BRANCH OF THE U.S.

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,785
ARMED FORCES, A SO-CALLED

12
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:25,221
SPACE FORCE.

13
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:27,022
>> IF YOU WOULD CARRY THAT

14
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:28,657
ASSIGNMENT OUT, I WOULD BE VERY

15
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:29,758
GREATLY HONORED.

16
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:34,463
ALSO, WHERE GENERAL DUNFORD?

17
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:35,531
>> Shannon: IT APPEARS HE

18
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:37,132
STILL HAS A WAY TO GO TO SELL

19
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:39,568
THE IDEA, EVEN TO SOME WITHIN

20
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:40,302
HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION.

21
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:42,371
BUT IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE AN

22
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,806
IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR HIM SO WE

23
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:46,308
WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHY.

24
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:49,078
JOINING US NOW, REPUBLICAN

25
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:50,546
CONGRESSMAN DOUG LAMBORN, WHO

26
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:52,548
SITS ON THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES

27
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:56,051
COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING

28
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:56,318
US.

29
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:57,853
>> I'M GLAD TO DO SO.

30
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:59,655
>> Shannon: LISTEN, THERE ARE

31
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:00,789
FOLKS TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL

32
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:01,457
SPACE FOR LOOMING.

33
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:02,892
THEY SAY WE ARE WAY BEHIND WHEN

34
00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:05,461
IT COMES TO CHINA AND RUSSIA.

35
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,429
IT'S NOT A TOPIC WE HEAR A LOT

36
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:08,264
TO HEAR ABOUT.

37
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:09,832
WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW?

38
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:15,804
>> WE NEED TO KNOW THAT IF OUR

39
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:21,010
SPACE WOULD BE AFFECTED IN A

40
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,045
TIME OF WAR, WE WOULD BE DEAF,

41
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:23,846
DUMB, AND BLIND.

42
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:25,047
WE NEED TO SHOW THE OTHER SIDE

43
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:26,849
THAT WE CAN PUT THEIR ASSETS AT

44
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,250
RISK.

45
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:28,918
THIS ALL REQUIRES MAKING

46
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:30,653
MILITARY OR DEFENSIVE SPACE MORE

47
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:32,454
A PRIORITY, EVEN THEN IT IS

48
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:32,855
RIGHT NOW.

49
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:34,056
ARE NOT JUST WHAT THE PRESIDENT

50
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:34,823
IS AFTER.

51
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:38,027
I THINK THAT IS VERY EXCITING,

52
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:38,827
AND TIMELY AND NECESSARY.

53
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:39,662
>> Shannon: MY UNDERSTANDING

54
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:41,130
IS THE AIR FORCE HANDLES ABOUT

55
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,866
80% OF THIS RIGHT NOW.

56
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,734
BY SOME REPORTS, THEY WERE NOT

57
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:46,402
EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

58
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:47,536
HERE'S WITH THE WITH THE

59
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:49,204
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAD TO SAY.

60
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:52,241
A FEW MONTHS BACK.

61
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:54,076
"OPPOSE THE CREATION OF A NEW

62
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:54,810
MILITARY SERVICE AND ADDITIONAL

63
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,945
ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERS AT A TIME

64
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:58,080
WHEN WE ARE FOCUSED ON

65
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,847
REDUCING OVERHEAD AND

66
00:01:58,847 --> 00:01:59,648
INTEGRATING JOINT WAR FIGHTING

67
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:02,251
FUNCTIONS."

68
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:03,652
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT?

69
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:06,789
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL --

70
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:12,227
PART OF THE PHRASE BUT OVER THE

71
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:12,795
DEFENSIVE SECRETARY.

72
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:17,132
WHAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF

73
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:19,068
DESIRES IS WHAT IS GOING TO

74
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:19,568
HAPPEN.

75
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:21,170
THE HOUSE AND SENATE ARE IN

76
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,870
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITIONS.

77
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,872
THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE MORE

78
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,306
REFORM MINDED.

79
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:25,007
THE SENATE IS A LITTLE MORE

80
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:27,042
STATUS QUO MINDED.

81
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,711
BUT WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER THE

82
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:31,146
FINAL VERSION IS, WE HAVE TO

83
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:32,848
MAKE SPACE MORE OF A

84
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:33,215
PRIORITY.

85
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:34,350
THE AIR FORCE IS TAKING SOME

86
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,818
GOOD STEPS, DOING SOME GOOD

87
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:36,652
THINGS, DOING A STUDY RIGHT NOW,

88
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,454
FOR INSTANCE, BUT WE HAVE TO

89
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:43,392
MAKE SURE THAT SPACE IS MORE OF

90
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:45,594
A PRIORITY.

91
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:46,395
IT WON'T CREATE MORE BUREAUCRACY

92
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:46,795
NECESSARILY.

93
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:49,431
THE KEY IS TO MAKE IT BETTER

94
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:51,433
FUNDED, A BETTER PRIORITY, THAT

95
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,435
THE PERSONNEL WITHIN THE SPACE

96
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:55,004
HAVE MORE CLOUT AND PRESTIGE,

97
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:57,973
AND SET THE ACQUISITION -- THIS

98
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:00,042
IS ALL IMPORTANT -- THAT THE

99
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:01,610
ACQUISITION PROCESS IS FASTER

100
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,244
AND MORE EFFECTIVE.

101
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:04,013
RIGHT NOW IT TAKES FIVE TO TEN

102
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,015
YEARS TO PUT A SATELLITE UP INTO

103
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:07,016
SPACE.

104
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,884
THAT IS WAY TOO LONG.

105
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:09,885
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES SO FAST.

106
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,320
>> Shannon: I KNOW THE

107
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,955
PENTAGON HAS BEEN WORKING ON A

108
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:14,356
NUMBER OF STUDIES, ONE MAJOR

109
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:16,458
ONE, INDEPENDENT REVIEW ORDERED

110
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,760
BY CONGRESS, NOT EVEN SUPPOSED

111
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,561
TO BE UNTIL DECEMBER.

112
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:21,730
SOME FOLKS WONDER IF HE IS

113
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,265
JUMPING THE GUN.

114
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:23,966
SENATOR BILL NELSON, DEMOCRAT

115
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,901
WHO HAPPENS TO BE A FORMER

116
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,803
ASTRONAUT, SAYS THE PRESIDENT

117
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:30,606
TOLD A U.S. GENERAL TO CREATE A

118
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:32,174
SPACE FOR US, SIXTH BRANCH OF

119
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:34,043
THE MILITARY TODAY, GENERALS

120
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,244
TELLING ME THEY DON'T WANT

121
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:35,644
TO.

122
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:36,345
THANKFULLY THE PRESIDENT CAN'T

123
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:37,413
DO IT WITHOUT CONGRESS BECAUSE

124
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:39,515
IT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO RIP

125
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:40,549
THE AIR FORCE APART.

126
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:41,550
TOO MANY IMPORTANT MEASURES THAT

127
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,655
I STAYED FOR IT WILL

128
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:47,623
CONGRESS CONGRESS PLAYS A VITAL

129
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,425
ROLE IN DEFINE THE PARAMETERS

130
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:50,859
AND HOW THE PROCESS WILL BE DONE

131
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,861
AND EVEN SOME OF THE FINAL

132
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,096
VERSION WILL LOOK LIKE.

133
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,330
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAS THE

134
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,266
BIGGEST VOICE OF ALL.

135
00:03:57,266 --> 00:04:01,370
I DISAGREE WITH SENATOR NELSON.

136
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:03,172
IT'S NOT THE PRIORITY RIGHT NOW

137
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:05,407
THAT IT NEEDS TO BE.

138
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:06,508
IT'S TUGGED INTO MANY DIFFERENT

139
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:06,909
DIRECTIONS.

140
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,477
THE FUNDING FOR IT SOMETIMES

141
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:10,446
GETS SIPHONED OFF INTO OTHER

142
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:11,847
THINGS, BECAUSE IS NOT THE

143
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:12,648
PRIORITY THAT IT SHOULD BE.

144
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:14,650
WE ALL AGREE ON THE OBJECTIVE,

145
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,652
EVEN IF WE DISAGREE ON HOW TO

146
00:04:16,652 --> 00:00:00,000
GET THERE.
