I sit in these classrooms every day.
So it’s just like, how can
something happen like this?
It was like, about 20 minutes
before school was supposed to end.
I think it’s just kind of crazy
how fast it happened.
It didn't really seem real
as it was going on.
I just have this sick
feeling in my gut
that all that had to happen.
And it's starting to feel
more and more real.
It’s really different when
you see something in the news
and rather than seeing
it happen at your school.
Because it happened somewhere
so close to home
that it became
more of a reality for me.
I’m all for freedom,
but there’s a difference
between freedom
and being safe.
This shouldn't happen to
anyone else.
Like, this has to be the last,
or one of the last,
school shootings
in the United States.
I want everyone to come
together and put differences
aside and realize that we need
to do something about this,
because kids are dying.
I am upset.
But I’m like, using that to
talk about gun control
and to talk about what happened.
We should get the word out,
speak our minds, because that’s
pretty much all we have
at this point is our words and ...
People always say
things after shootings.
They talk about gun
control and they
talk about how things
need to change.
But nothing ever does and
that’s what’s so frustrating.
I want them to stop
saying that they’re
giving us their
prayers because that’s not
going to do anything for us.
We need action.
It’s time to put
petty things aside
about partisanship
and it’s time to think
about humanity.
People are just expecting
to see it on the news.
And we should not expect this.
This should not be normal.
