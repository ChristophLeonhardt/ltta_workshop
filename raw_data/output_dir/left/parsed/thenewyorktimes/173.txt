“Kate Spade's really accessible
and it’s, you know,
sort of has a sense
of humor about itself.
It doesn’t take itself too seriously.”
“She puts forth a sort
of aspirational line,
which I think, ‘Oh, I
want to be like that.
I want to be chic,
and pulled together,
and a New York lady.’
And then I can.”
“You know,
it was time to get back
into the business.”
