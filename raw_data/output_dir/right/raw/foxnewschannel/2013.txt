00:00:01,263 --> 00:00:02,564
BORDER CROSSERS, TODAY

2
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:03,298
ANNOUNCING THAT THE DEPARTMENT

3
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:07,536
OF HOMELAND SECURITY WILL SEND

4
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:10,038
ANYONE CROSSING THE SOUTHERN

5
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:10,639
BORDER FOR PROSECUTION.

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,540
JOINS US LIVE.

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,975
WE HADN'T SET YOU UP OR ASKED

8
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,977
YOU TO COME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT

9
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:16,945
THIS DISPUTE BETWEEN THE DOJ AND

10
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:18,480
THE HOUSE BUT YOU ARE JUST

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,215
CHOMPING AT THE BIT, I CAN SEE,

12
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,017
TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

13
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:22,584
DO YOU THINK THE

14
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:23,385
ATTORNEY GENERAL DID NOT SEE THE

15
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:25,954
LETTER FROM NUNES AND IF NOT,

16
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:26,588
WHY NOT?

17
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:28,490
>> I THINK HE'S BEING A LITTLE

18
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,492
BIT CHARITABLE THERE AND

19
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:31,226
SESSIONS, I RESPECT INCREDIBLY,

20
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:31,960
BUT HIS ANSWER THAT HE JUST

21
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,763
SHOWED ON THE CLIP, THE

22
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:36,598
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE

23
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:37,632
DETERMINED.

24
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,466
THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WORK

25
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,836
UNDERNEATH THE PRESIDENT AND

26
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:41,503
THEY ARE COEQUAL TO THE

27
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:44,773
CONGRESS.

28
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:45,974
CONGRESS' ARTICLE ONE BEFORE

29
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:46,975
ARTICLE TWO, THE PRESIDENT.

30
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:48,243
WHEN WE ASK FOR DOCUMENTS THAT

31
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:49,311
ARE ALL REDACTED AND MARKED UP

32
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:50,979
WITH BLACK LINES IT'S NOT US

33
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,381
ASKING, IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

34
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:53,982
ASKING.

35
00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:55,183
WE ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF

36
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:56,785
THE PEOPLE, SO BASICALLY WHAT

37
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,653
YOU'RE HEARING FROM SESSIONS IS

38
00:00:58,653 --> 00:00:59,588
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE

39
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:00,355
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DON'T WANT

40
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:01,990
TO GIVE DOCUMENTS TO THE

41
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,724
AMERICAN PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN

42
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:04,626
RUN OUR GOVERNMENT OF, BY AND

43
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:06,628
FOR THE PEOPLE.

44
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:08,396
>> Shannon: YOU KNOW THE DOJ

45
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:09,097
SAYS THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDING

46
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:10,165
YOU THE DOCUMENTS.

47
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:12,434
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS

48
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:14,536
GETTING CROSSED, WIRES HERE

49
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:15,804
BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'VE

50
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:16,605
PROVIDED DOCUMENTS.

51
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:18,406
THEY HAVE A CENTER SET UP AT DOJ

52
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:19,140
WERE PEOPLE FROM EITHER SIDE OF

53
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,443
THE AISLE CAN COME AND LOOK AT

54
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:22,177
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES

55
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,212
OF DOCUMENTS.

56
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:25,814
THE MEMO THAT LAUNCHED THE

57
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:27,849
ENTIRE THING, THE RUSSIA

58
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:28,850
INVESTIGATION, HEAVILY REDACTED.

59
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,718
I KNOW THEY SAY THEY CAN'T GIVE

60
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:31,419
YOU THAT BECAUSE THERE'S AN

61
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:32,120
ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

62
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,955
BUT THERE IS A FEDERAL JUDGE

63
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:35,257
THAT HAS GIVEN THEM TWO WEEKS TO

64
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:36,825
COUGH IT UP.

65
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:38,660
>> THERE IS ARTICLE THREE, THE

66
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,027
JUDICIARY.

67
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:40,395
THANK GOD A JUDGE HAS STEPPED IN

68
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:42,197
AND SAID YOU DON'T DETERMINE THE

69
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:43,798
SCOPE, I DO.

70
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:45,033
SO THE JUDICIARY, WHY DO THEY

71
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,167
GET TO SEE THE REDACTED

72
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,503
DOCUMENTS WHEN CONGRESS, WHO HAS

73
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:50,538
OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE,

74
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:50,906
DOESN'T?

75
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:54,009
CONGRESS IS NUMBER ONE BECAUSE

76
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,543
WE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE'S

77
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:55,977
INTEREST.

78
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,078
THE PEOPLE'S INTEREST IS BEING

79
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:59,381
DISMISSED HERE.

80
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:00,448
>> Shannon: WE WILL ALLOW --

81
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:01,950
THERE IS SOME AGREEING TO

82
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,785
DISAGREE BETWEEN THE HOUSE

83
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,387
G.O.P. AND THE DOJ.

84
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:06,988
LET'S TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

85
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:07,722
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL VERY TOUGH

86
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:10,225
ON THIS TODAY, INCLUDING THIS

87
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,559
MESSAGE HE SAID ABOUT THOSE WHO

88
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,260
WOULD TRY TO BRING YOUNGSTERS

89
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,798
INTO THE U.S.

90
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:18,466
>> IF YOU SMUGGLE ILLEGAL ALIENS

91
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:22,804
ACROSS OUR BORDER THEN WE WILL

92
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:23,405
PROSECUTE YOU.

93
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:27,208
IF YOU ARE SMUGGLING A CHILD

94
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,210
THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU.

95
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,980
AND THAT CHILD MAY BE SEPARATED

96
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,648
FROM YOU AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

97
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:34,215
>> Shannon:

98
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:34,950
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" PICKING UP

99
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,017
ON THAT.

100
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:37,786
THEY SAID MORE THAN 700 CHILDREN

101
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:39,421
HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ADULTS

102
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,122
CLAIMING TO BE THEIR PARENTS

103
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:41,990
SINCE OCTOBER.

104
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,992
THEY GO ON TO QUOTE SOMEONE

105
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:45,427
SAYING THE IDEA OF PUNISHING

106
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:47,262
PARENTS FOR TRYING TO SAVE THEIR

107
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:47,996
CHILDREN'S LIVES IS

108
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:49,230
FUNDAMENTALLY CRUEL AND

109
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,831
UN-AMERICAN.

110
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:51,800
THAT'S DIRECTOR OF MIGRANT

111
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,335
RIGHTS AND THE JUSTICE PROGRAM

112
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:54,269
AT THE WOMEN'S REFUGEE

113
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:54,669
COMMISSION.

114
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,805
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

115
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:57,405
YOU LISTEN, THE JUSTICE

116
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:58,139
DEPARTMENT SAYS WE ARE DOING

117
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,643
THAT IN SOME CASES.

118
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:03,611
>> THIS IS EXACTLY WHY YOU NEED

119
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:04,779
TO PASS THE GOODLATTE BILL.

120
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:07,182
IT'S A WELL THOUGHT OUT RATIONAL

121
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:08,416
POLICY THAT IS SYSTEMATIC AND

122
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,117
COVERS ALL OF THESE BASES.

123
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:12,921
THE LEFT, WE WILL GIVE YOU

124
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:13,455
700,000 DACA RELIEF.

125
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:15,590
BRING THE KIDS OUT OF THE

126
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,424
SHADOWS, THAT'S COMPASSIONATE.

127
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:18,159
TRUMP EVEN WENT BEYOND THAT, HE

128
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,127
SAID TO MILLIE.

129
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,029
THE LEFT SAYS NO TO THAT DEAL.

130
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,897
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP FROM

131
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:23,999
HAPPENING AS WE WANT TO BE

132
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,800
COMPASSIONATE TO THE PEOPLE IN

133
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,769
THE SHADOWS, BUT IF WE KEEP

134
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:28,603
SHOWING COMPASSION OVER AND OVER

135
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:29,537
AND OVER WE SEND A SIGNAL AND

136
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:31,740
PUT OUT A GREEN LIGHT, KEEP

137
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,808
COMING FROM HONDURAS, GUATEMALA,

138
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:35,810
SOUTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA

139
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,511
ACROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY,

140
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:37,245
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE RULE OF

141
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:39,614
LAW ANYMORE.

142
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:41,816
AND THAT WE HAVE TO BE STIFF ON.

143
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:44,019
WE NEED TO SEND A VERY CLEAR

144
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:44,886
SIGNAL AND WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

145
00:03:44,886 --> 00:03:46,287
FIRST CAME INTO OFFICE OF THE

146
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:47,922
BORDER CROSSINGS WENT WAY DOWN.

147
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:49,858
IT'S ONLY AFTER WE HAVE GOTTEN

148
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:50,625
LAX.

149
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,693
PAUL RYAN PROMISED US WE WOULD

150
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:52,694
PASS THAT GOODLATTE BILL THIS

151
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,329
YEAR AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS SO

152
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:54,696
IMPORTANT.

153
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:55,997
THAT WILL SEND A SIGNAL TO THE

154
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:57,365
REST OF THE WORLD, THE

155
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,234
UNITED STATES IS A BEACON OF

156
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:00,035
LIBERTY.

157
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:01,403
WE ARE WELCOMING, WE ARE

158
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:02,003
COMPASSIONATE.

159
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:04,272
WE USED TO BRING IN ABOUT

160
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:05,440
500,000 FOLKS LEGALLY, NOW A

161
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,443
MILLION AND A HALF LAST YEAR

162
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:09,411
LEGALLY.

163
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,612
THEY WENT THROUGH THE LINE AND

164
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:12,180
NOW FOLKS ARE COMING AND

165
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,015
CLAIMING REFUGEE STATUS, SOME OF

166
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,383
THEM HAVE BEEN COAXED,

167
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:16,017
ET CETERA.

168
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:16,918
IF THAT PROGRESSIVE GROUPS

169
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:17,918
WORKING WITH THEM.

170
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,019
THAT'S BEEN ON THE NEWS EVERY

171
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,790
NIGHT FOR THE PAST WEEK.

172
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,191
SESSIONS GOT IT RIGHT, WE NEED

173
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:23,958
TO MAKE A FIRM ANNOUNCEMENT THAT

174
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,796
WE WILL FOLLOW THE LAW AND YOU

175
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:29,597
SEE THAT IS A CONTINUING THEME.

176
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:30,899
AFTER THE OBAMA YEARS THE

177
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,634
CERTAINTY IN THE LAW WITH LOCAL

178
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:33,368
LAW ENFORCEMENT, LAW ENFORCEMENT

179
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:37,038
AT THE BORDER AND THE FBI AND

180
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:38,239
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

181
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:40,375
ALL OF THIS IS IN QUESTION RIGHT

182
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,509
NOW SO WE HAVE TO RESTORE

183
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,244
CREDIBILITY TO ALL OF THESE

184
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:45,613
INSTITUTIONS AND WE WILL GET IT

185
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:45,980
STRAIGHT.

186
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,449
IN A FEW YEARS WE WILL HAVE THIS

187
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,116
STRAIGHTENED OUT AND WE CAN

188
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:48,883
CONTINUE TO BE THE COMPASSIONATE

189
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:51,986
COUNTRY WE ARE, BUT COMPASSION,

190
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:54,389
