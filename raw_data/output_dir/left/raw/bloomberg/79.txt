1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,500
When you think about the creation of money,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,460
you think about places like this.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,820
Or This…

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,200
But what if money was created here… in a
Brooklyn loft, by a group of young entrepreneurs

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,770
and data nerds.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,859
The company is called AirSwap.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,260
The founders all met at either Burning Man
or business school, and they envision a peer-to-peer

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,500
cryptocurrency exchange.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,840
Today, they are launching their ICO or Initial Coin Offering.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,960
An ICO is sort of like an IPO, but instead
of buying shares, investors buy tokens.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,980
This process is entirely crypto, so you cannot
use, for example, a fiat currency like a dollar

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,260
to purchase our tokens.

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,860
So we're selling our tokens for ether, which
is effectively a digital currency.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,740
Most people buy tokens in the hopes that they
will increase in value, much like shares of a company.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,480
Because this is a global sale, we need to
be available to people in different time zones.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,360
So the sale's gonna run for 24 hours, and
by the end we will have a approximately $35 million.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,480
What will they do with all that money?

18
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,010
To understand this, you need to know a little
bit about blockchain.

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,260
Now let me keep this really simple.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,930
A Blockchain is a virtual public ledger that
keeps any and every exchange watertight and

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,110
protected from fraud or hacking.

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,220
Experts agree that blockchain is poised to
revolutionize the way we do business.

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,340
Using this groundbreaking technology, Airswap is building an exchange that removes all middlemen.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,100
Lawyers, clearinghouses, banks and even governments
will be bypassed with this new peer-to-peer system.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,290
The same way that the internet and telecomm allowed for peer to peer information transfer, you’re seeing

26
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,660
this now happen to blockchain where you have peer to peer value transfer.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,920
I think one of the reasons why people are
looking at this is, it really started in 2008,

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,680
when people's confidence in the financial
system was really shaken to the core.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,890
And all these intermediaries that people trusted
fell short, and people are looking for an

30
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,240
alternative in which you and I can exchange
value without the need of depending

31
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,720
on these institutions that we used to trust.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,450
Demand for this new kind of value exchange
is high- Something Airswap capitalized on

33
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,980
by using social media to build a worldwide
online community in anticipation of their ICO.

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,180
This is basically a live world map of all the orders we have coming through the system.

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,180
It updates live and in real time.

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,660
This is the AirSwap community.

37
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,640
Yeah, they're very excited.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,600
So they're posting memes.

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,370
We're probably about 23 million right now.

40
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,370
I can actually check.

41
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,760
Yeah, we're at 23 million.

42
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,440
The 24 hour long token sale wasn't without its hitches.

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,360
Several well-designed fake accounts tried
to scam members of the

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,400
AirSwap community out of their ether.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,140
Oh, this is a phishing scam.

46
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,220
Right now, I'm crafting an announcement to alert the community to several, what are actually

47
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,320
very well-done websites that are trying to
convince people that they are us.

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,580
So we need to like actively expose them.

49
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,380
The imposters were eventually shut down, and
sales resumed uninterrupted throughout the

50
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,760
night and into the next morning.

51
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,480
So where are we now?

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,260
Uh, right now we have just around 13 minutes
left until the sale is over.

53
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,060
It's been a very tough 24 hours.

54
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,900
We have sold out our entire allocation.

55
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,660
Alright, we've got 5,000 token holders everybody!

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,300
By the end of their ICO Airswap had raised what is now valued at over

57
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,130
$50M of ether, issuing all of their available tokens worldwide.

58
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,420
By most if not all measures, uh, we can call
it a success.

59
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,020
But the playing field is flooded with ICOs right now.

60
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,200
In 2016, there were fewer than 50 ICOs.

61
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,230
In 2017, that number jumped to over 250.

62
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,760
Now, everyone from Overstock.com to Kodak, yes, Kodak, has jumped onto the Cryptocurrency

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,660
bandwagon and launched their own ICOs.

64
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,700
No one knows who will survive the hype, and
Airswap remains a relative newcomer.

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,720
But they’re optimistic that their global
community of thousands of token holders will

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,440
push them to dominance,

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,720
all from this Brooklyn loft.

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,080
And in this bleary landscape of cryptocurrency,
that’s worth something.

69
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,040
Hell of a morning.

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:00:00,000
Hell of a week.
