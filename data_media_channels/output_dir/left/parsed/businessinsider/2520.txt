this is why I'm the CFO of our marriage
if it was me I mean I save like crazy
I save over a quarter of what I make
basically per month I think that has
been the smartest thing just because for
example we had an emergency where a cat
almost died that was like $12,000 and it
was so much nicer to just be able to
like like okay you know this is really
tight for us but like we can make sure
our cat doesn't die it was it's really
nice to have like we paid for our
wedding almost entirely ourselves like
we that was very smart
um like we've and we still have like a
buffer yeah I mean like please talk
about since we've got this is we got
married or so living together that's
just a fact alike these disasters are
these things like getting rid wasn't as
that's but paying for a wedding
see they paying financially pay for a
wedding is known for being incredibly
difficult and you don't want to start
off your your marriage in debt and then
we have the emergency with the cat like
almost a year later and that was like
that could have financially screwed us
up I mean you don't want to be starting
off your life together then just being
like oh should we open a credit card to
max it out to survive that seems like
see how saving and having that cushion
for those emergencies was probably too
smart this is why I'm the CFO of our if
it was me I actually get on in for it to
like I'm like how much money
you
