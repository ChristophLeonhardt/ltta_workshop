you know I wasn't going to talk about Star Wars but I guess that I guess that I will because it is May the fourth and and never have we seen such a wretched wretched hive of scum and villainy as the US Congress apparently but aside from aside from that you know what you guys have all seen the trailer for the new Star Wars movie right oh he hasn't seen the trailer for the new Star Wars movie so dang it time now okay so I'm not going to talk about this just for Malthus I'm going to skip it just for Malthus I will give you my one word reaction to it which is disappointing disappointing is my one word reaction to the trailer okay I haven't seen the movie movies not out yet Malthus calm yourself down the trailer the trailer is disappointing I also believe that I rewatched rogue one and I reviewed rogue one a few months back and I think I gave it a little bit short trip because I was really tired when I saw it I started like 11 o'clock at night and I was kind of falling asleep at the time and and I rewatched it actually on a plane and it's really good I mean rogue one is really a first-rate movie it's much much better than the force awakens the force awakens does not age well the force awakens is one of those movies where when you see it you're like you all carry like that's pretty good and then the more you think about it like that was really not very good and that's because you realize number one and you notice at the time but you're so overwhelmed by the nostalgia of it that it doesn't matter so much it's exactly the same plot as the original Star Wars and then beyond that they destroy your childhood right okay so I can it do I need to give spoilers for force with everyone on earth is he in force awakens do I need to do that okay so spoiler alert spoiler alert okay now han Solo gets killed right it destroys your childhood hey I grew up where han Solo was the galaxy's biggest badass and everyone wanted to be Han Solo right women wanted him and men wanted to be him every no-one cared about Luke Luke was kind of a whiny geek but Han was awesome and then they turned him in the force awakens into a bickering divorced dad who can't deal with his kid you know he's going to buy it the minute that princess stupid Leia who hasn't done anything to develop her four skills by the way I mean they foreshadow it in in Empire Strikes Back right Yoda there is another and then she does nothing with the force for the rest of her life for the rest of her life she does zero things with the force right the end of Empire Strikes Back Luke talks her with his mind oh happy day that's the entirety of what Princess Leia does with the force for the rest of her entire life except for giving birth to apparently the the next worst person in the universe so she tells Han that it's time for a han to go talk to her kid the minute she says that he should have said her look lady you go do it but I forgot the lesson you know you're his mom you go talk to him why me why do I have to do it she says go talk to him yeah that's going to go real well as she's gonna that's going to be a winner also I do have to ask why it is that in a galaxy where people have achieved like speed no one has a cellphone like well why is it that nobody can just pick up a phone and call kylo Ren and be like dude get your get your bleep together let me Facebook you will have a conversation let's get together for coffee instead I'm going to fly to your death planet and I'm going to infiltrate your death planet with ever with all your friends trying to murder me and then we'll have a conversation on one of Star Wars famous walkways okay here's the rule in Star Wars never have a conversation on a walkway suspended over nothing okay always goes wrong never a good no one has ever had a good conversation on a walkway suspended above nothing it just ends poorly for someone involved it destroys your child's head again Hans whole thing is that he's a badass Harrison Ford in real life is still kind of a badass turning him into you know like a character the parents of one of these kids from the Bad News Bears is really is really nasty so anyway I hope that the new Star Wars is better than that rogue one was really good but unfortunately there can't be sequels really two rogue one this equal to Rho one is the actual first Star Wars film so I guess we're going to have to live with whatever they give us I just hope that the last Jedi is not Jar Jar Binks that's all I hope okay so
