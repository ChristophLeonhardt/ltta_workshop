on Friday the fate of Brett Cavanaugh's nomination as Supreme Court justice will be decided following a string of damaging sex crime allegations since the stories came to light last week senator Cavanaugh has been the target of Trump's opponents some have questioned whether he can be presumed innocent until proven guilty this was attempted rape I believe professor Ford judge Cavanaugh has lied multiple times she doesn't Kevin all have the same presumption of innocence as anyone else in America his credibility is already very questionable in my mind and in the minds of a lot of my fellow judiciary committee members the the Democrats lying though well I believe her let's put it that way there's credibility to her story so far to allegations of sexual misconduct have been made against Cavanaugh the first woman to come forward christine Blasi ford says he sexually assaulted her while they were at high school the second Deborah Ramirez claims Cavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale University party in the 1980s a third is also expected to come forward this week the allegations have led Democrats to call for Kevin R's nomination to the country's highest court to be blocked on Thursday he will give testimony on the claims leveled against him though he does deny all allegations a fair process at a minimum and a bare minimum requires hearing from both sides before rushing to judgment we have it√≠d guests to debate the possible political motives behind the story and what's happened to the idea of innocent until proven guilty we're convincing people who probably had no idea anything about this case or even that there was a Supreme Court nominee to suddenly think that Brett Kavanaugh is a monster based on these these these allegations these paintings of how he's been meanwhile all we have are the wards of two people that's not to say that they are lying but we have absolutely no evidence for that and that is simply the complete opposite of what the United States Constitution and our judicial system was set up to to create so I don't think anybody is assuming that anybody is guilty but that doesn't mean that we don't have a responsibility to take the of sexual assault and sexual harassment very seriously and I think that's what we're doing right now particularly as it applies to the misuse of power by people and in particular men in power in our institutions in this country so I think right now it's perfectly plausible and and important to hear out these women a lot of people believe some very important things in danger of being overturned and and that I think there's a some very serious implications disagreements and the fear that roe v wade is going to be overturned but again these are more media allegations these are more allegations from from liberal stating that if Trump has his people and if conservatives come in then then roe v wade will be overturned in all of this that's simply not due process of the American legal system or of the Supreme Court they can't just come in and overturn laws there have to be cases there have to be precedent that this is politically motivated against Cavanaugh it has nothing to do with any evidence that's actually been brought forth besides about besides allegations from two women all processes that bring about the interpretation the production of law any society is inherently political Trump's appointment of Kavanagh is political there is an agenda at play here this is a field of legal it's actually contingent on political ideologies but in fact actually the code of judicial conduct itself switched all judges and all legal on process people are supposed to adhere to the Kawai do you think our founders actually passed these things presumption of innocence there is no presumption of innocence right now in the media there's no presumption of minute innocence right now in the US media what I'm suggesting and what many people are suggesting is that we take this seriously and put forward a real process that hears out these voices and and puts forward the conversation as to do we want to put this person into this position is that who we want to represent us is that who we want to have decide on certain things like well anyway the point that you're making was it we need to listen to these voices the question is now going to is this going to be is this the person that we want in the highest office of our additional system as the Supreme Court of the United States and and so now we're already talking that he's guilty I think the the fault is more on the media it's more on some of the loudest voices against this by automatically mean that of course those aren't your voices of it those are voices from US media you
