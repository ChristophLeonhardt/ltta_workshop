from the State of the Union President Trump talking about probably the most aerobic person I'm ever gonna meet ji Seong ho we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime his name is mr. ji sung ho in 1996 sung ho was a starving boy in North Korea one day he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food which were very hard to get in the process he passed out on the train tracks exhausted from hunger he woke up as a train ran over his limbs he then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt his brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves permanently stunting their own growth later he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China his tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any Christians he had and he resolved after that to be free some ho travel thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom most of his family followed his father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death today he lives in Seoul where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most the truth today he has a new leg but somehow I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you've come your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all please thank you it's an unbelievable moment obviously the most memorable part of that entire State of the Union I sat down for 40 minutes or an hour with juice on how we're gonna air this interview in two parts I must say - when we were doing the interview I had a live translation going on in my ear only after we redid the translation and re-recorded it later did I realize that I was just hearing a paraphrasing of what was going on the actual details are far more horrifying and you'll see that even the reactions alone are pretty telling but actually what was being said that I couldn't hear is even even that much more horrifying these are this is the real true story first-person account of what goes on in North Korea and in communist governments throughout history and around the world without any more introduction how do you be in an introduction from the president the United States here is my interview with ji-sun ho sung ho thank you so much for being here you are the most heroic person I've ever met you're probably the most heroic person I'll ever meet in my life I want to talk about your personal story in a second but I it first occurs to me the Berlin Wall fell 30 years ago people who were alive today don't have really an experience of communism communism is fading from people's memory you have this very very vivid experience of it how would you describe communism to people who are living in the West in free countries and on Iran listen I think that communism is a horrible idea that brainwashes its citizens they talk about the happiness of living together in harmony by preaching about equality is it hunky Santa hang would ya guys you man in reality however I believe that communism is where the royalty and the higher-ups live in extravagance by exploiting the people it's hard for people to to see now because you have you know prosthetics and everything but you you were grievously injured it went as a young teenager you lost your hand you lost your leg North Korea is not known for its good treatment of people with disabilities how did you get those juries and how did you survive North Korea when you had them women even took tally-hawk oriental son easier as you may know I do not have my left hand for my left leg but I was not born this way I became disabled when I lived in North Korea because in North Korea people could not eat and had to scavenge and do anything in order to feed themselves oh I'm kind of good cuz how long gone this had originally she also say even though I should have been in school I would steal coals from the supply train so that I had money to buy corn or other supplies I continued to do this until I was 14 years old kind of don't chill guys you grow up I'm not joking man who oceans with Adam gushing young and all those shoes on then there one day I fell from a running train while I was stealing coals my left arm and my left leg were crushed under the 60-ton train I later had to cut both off Patti I wondered if I would she not won't go to uni as you go I was forced to go into operation in the hospital without any proper anesthetics in addition I had to endure the immeasurable amount of pain for seven months within that hospital she was going on there coca-cola is yeah groans how long as I can there has to me that I consequently became disabled however in North Korea disabled people are expected to live quietly they do not want to disabled people to go outside and show that they are miserable they did not want the outside world to know that they have problems of the human rights of their citizens they wanted the disabled to die off therefore I was in the center of discrimination where the North Koreans wanted me to die quietly North Korea is known for this they from what I've read they put people with Down syndrome away they don't give treatment to people with disabilities and and you of course sustained your injuries because you were too hungry you you fainted from as you were trying to get little scraps of food for you and for your family was it this injury that convinced you that you had to flee North Korea or was it something else what convinced you that you finally had to get out you and as much as of your family as could get out during I know you grew up during the the famines of the 1990s what motivated you and said I've got to get to freedom Oh hyung any people would pause it I realized that I had to escape after I became disabled I realized that North Korea is not a land of happiness and equality two key eejit song aim that again and again even though the disabled people need societal protection and the special provision from the government North Korea did not provide any of this I'm gonna enjoy a song a song name I realized that living in North Korea as a disabled person is nearly impossible at one point I thought about ending my own life rather than living under such harsh conditions and discrimination law has on remember she did not get that you don't say no with him then there I kept thinking about this until in the year 2000 I went to China to beg for food whatever guys you go will comment on that and there physicans the Chinese police officers assaulted me and said that retards like me should die off and stop embarrassing the nation within that was your home when and how long you know an idea during all the torments and the beatings by the police I was saddened because this is not how humans should treat one another there exist many more free nations out there so I decided I would escape this hell hole I decided I would escape North Korea for good oh I read somewhere because I know that your Christian and I know that you I believe you've said that the Lord's Prayer the Our Father sustained you during some of this torture from the North Korean regime how did you encounter Christianity what what role did it play in your decision to flee in your thousands of miles long journey fleeing on those famous crutches with this disability and in your in the work that you're doing now picanha son if you are Christian in North Korea you are either publicly executed or sent to political internment camps there are no official churches in North Korea and when asked about who is God in North Korea Kim Jong Il's should be the god of North Korea Christianity is absolutely forbidden there ok Hanon there Sega from Google or Tetris when I escaped to China however I was exposed to the existence of Christianity I then realized that there is a higher being other than Kim Jong Il and prayed daily in North Korea in midst of the torment when he was a kid ordered his say oh good the corner down on you at all I prayed that if there is a true God I believe that he would be the one to help for people like me to escape even though it seemed impossible due to me not having one hand and a leg I prayed to God to help me escape this land on six years later I found an opportunity for me to escape however the Tumen River was overflowing and made it impossible to cross the river so I prayed I prayed God please let me cross this river canyon and then on a Monday given me come on don't get even though I nearly drowned I was able to safely cross the Tumen River tamaño won't quote movies only two more hours and whenever I was about to fall and despair while I was crossing China Laos Myanmar and Thailand I prayed to God that if he gives me strength to go to the free nation I will help out other North Koreans to live in free democratic nations and strive for the North Korea were the disabled people like me won't have to escape the nation to escape discrimination God seemed to answer my prayers and I was able to survive my journey and safely get across of course that when you think of Christianity 2,000 years ago it was the last political revolution that offered freedom to people and that's why rulers from 2,000 years back all the way up to the Kim dictatorship has been so fearful of it and attacked it I got to say when I read your life story it's hard not to tear up at parts of your journey and I know that the rest of the country when they saw you at the State of the Union as a guest of President Trump raise your crutches up and heard what he said and recounting your life I don't think there was a dry eye in the house from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean those crutches have become world-famous one how did you do it how did you cross thousands of miles on those crutches where did you get those crutches from why do you keep them around okay take the idea don't put that pole the crutch that I held up during president Trump's State of the Union speech was a commemoration by my father who personally made the crutches for me my father is no longer alive come on Little Joe chin tell you I would you then she gave me Jen he died in 2006 under heavy torment by the North Korean regime how long has long yeah eaten union dues at origin and they all I had to cross the Tumen River while I was on the crutch because the river was overflowing at the time damn woody my name poorest Anika and I did not know much about the holy spirit I knew the miracle of the Red Sea I prayed to God that even though he can't make this River disappear please spare me like you did in the Red Sea in what position so who Yankees would hit them 100 times fighters here hello Keith ordered head jump when I was crossing the river with my younger brother I was nearly drowning but my brother was able to pick me up from the violent currents and saved me just let her go - guys you want I want - Oh sweetie the water on him there then bones hanging up on there I could have easily died in the river but thanks to my brother and because God protected me I was safely able to cross the river something until he's just hung go get that one a little butter was only half when I was traveling him crutches and because I did not have my left hand I had to tie my hand to the crutch john-boy named young-nam on Cooper cunning and that burns head-on Woodall isn't when you are caught by the Chinese police in China you are sent back to North Korea and you were executed as an enemy of the stage I prayed more so that I would not be caught and be killed someone sing a Cuban hit John and I named someone from Salinger's here nigga patterns head I'm sure and when I could no longer walk she fell down so you afraid to God that even though I am NOT as healthy as other people please make me at least another day you know free nation also I was able to cross because there were many health exams Wow it's not as though the the Kim regime didn't give you the crutches or they they I believe they didn't even give you anesthetic when you were being operated on to for your injuries as a young man yeah come on I believe that North Korea is bad or more precisely that communism is bad so I'm thinking that they the reason why is because it lies to the whole world about the nature of the organization even though they have human rights abuses they boast about the flawlessness of their human rights that is why I believe it is bad when I was in North Korea there were anesthetics but they were only reserved for the higher-ups when they go through a medical operation poor people like me however are told we are equal even though we are not and are not given anesthetics during surgeries therefore I was forced to endure tremendous pain for three hours during my operation I was only 14 at the time goes on so why oh ma chief and antonius i just how did it appear there cool what gave me the most pain was that the doctors had to cut away my skin and saw my bone off without any anesthetics the pain was so severe that I lost consciousness here and there when I woke up my wrist was cut off and I remembered how painful my operation was little take okay good I believe that if hell actually exists on earth there is no harsher hell than there and so on Kukui say again that's you mom that pain still lingers as a form of trauma for me even today of course I'm sort of sorry to even have you relive it as you as you tell about this but of course it's such an important thing to show the hell of communism and and you've explained to struggles you've undergone which is really the same struggle there's the physical struggle of this these horrific things you've experienced from a young man all the way through your escape and then the spiritual struggle of being told you should just die you should don't want you you're not worth protecting even the spiritual struggle of living everyday as a sort of robot for this communist regime which is harder and which do you think is harder for people in North Korea broadly done do you kiss a good-look again and yeah in terms of pain physical pain is undoubtedly one of the harsher difficulties has she did you who season once you've got the Hamada and there I said that it is like hell but I believe the fact that you have to live there forever without anyone trying to change the living system and conditions is the real challenge on when I was young the fact that I had to get my legs cut off in the surgery was a painful experience for me but the fact that I had to live in North Korea was more painful for my boys in Mandarin in reality North Korea enslaved its citizens the reason why I say this is because I believe that it is universally agreeable that when you work you should be rewarded for the value of your labor which was young cool yeah in North Korea however citizens were not fed for their labor and when they asked for food they are sent to prison if they cannot find any more options and they go to China or other places they're sent back to North Korea as a prisoner even if you just think differently from the other North Koreans you are sent to a political internment camps or don't want a war harem drone did in a sense North Koreans cannot breathe in those conditions it's a good song and guys I think what poison injection moreover the fact that I was disabled in North Korea was so painful that my only option was to separate myself from these pains by escaping someone hung you dej question to Juliana she put into the London go sir and even though I knew my disability would hinder my chances of escape so that I would have only a 10% chance of escaping I still attempted to escape I just had on goods you don't want knowing that my descendants in the future would be proud of this journey the image that I mean this makes perfect sense because there's this know there's an hope in communism of material betterment or of a political betterment there's just stasis and that the hell that you describe and then the the anti Christianity the anti Christian persecution say there's there cannot even be a spiritual hope it's just despair and hopelessness as you describe in the West we we're told that people in North Korea are brainwashed to love the Kim's and they love the Kim's and we saw when Kim Jong Il died videos and photos from North Korean propaganda of people crying hysterically oh are those tears real are people really brainwashed to love the Kim's or to the North Korean people are they very aware of their own misery and desirous of regime change and freedom mmm Kim Eun sung needed to thin when Kim il-sung died I believe that there were many who actually shed tears during his funeral until that time there were many who believed that North Korea's political system was the right choice however I believe that the tears shed when Kim Jong Il died were only from a small number of people if you do not cry during the funeral you will be executed in North Korea during the filming of the funeral when there are many including the politicians watching the Ted Omaha point you goes hand on one is a thoughtful Kanye's you can move the fact that you are not crying is the sign that you are not loyal enough to the great leader and God you are then either exiled from Pyongyang or sent to internment camps that is why people at least have to act like they are crying in those situations hyung who do you know Joe I think that's Haram buddy in a sense the North Koreans are required by the regime to act against their will like a bunch of fools in a circus freak show that is why many North Koreans have to shed tears during the funeral there are not many people who actually believe that their nation is the best nation and through to them little people come down we know well we get there when they're little kids in the middle her name in wish we all when I lived in North Korea I knew that it was not the best place to live that is why I had to flee from North Korea and many other people to flee from North Korea but they cannot because they will be publicly executed my ninja torso Janica in a sense the level of loyalty in the past and the level of loyalty today north korea has changed and has become an issue for the North Koreans well you're doing God's work it is a singular inspiration to talk to you and to meet you and to hear your story I really wish American Millennials and college professors and armchair socialists and communists could talk to that guy because when you sit down across from Gaeseong ho the gravity and the enormity of communism hits you in the face it's all it's all fun and games until you see the reality that the physical injuries the amputations and the psychological trauma that this cause is not to this guy who got out who made it out somehow with some of his family some of his other family obviously was tortured to death before they could leave or starve to death and an entire country is left behind that wall enslaved by the Kim family so it reminds me when you talk to people in college you know like freshman year you're talking to those little armchair socialists and they say well you know you know socialism it's really never been tried oh real true socialism not that fake socialism true socialism true communism has never been tried it's been tried it's been tried many many times over the last hundred hundred fifty years this is what happens this is the end of the road for socialism and communism and even you know one thing that irks me almost more are those know-nothing moderate types independent types a lot of Millennials who say you know communism it's a good idea in theory it's beautiful in theory it's beautiful on paper it's just terrible in practice it's not beautiful on paper it's terrible on paper it's awful it's unhuman inhuman on paper it's miserable and evil and wicked and antithetical to everything beautiful and true and human and to end divine on paper it's just awful there's no excuse for it and I really wish that those people who defend communism and socialism could look that guy in the eye and tell him how great Muniz and have great socialism is because this is a scary trend in America I opened up that interview by observing that it's been 30 years now since the fall of the Berlin Wall almost 30 years at this point and people forget they don't remember they didn't live during communism my entire generation did not live during communism I basically was born as the Berlin Wall was falling so they don't they don't know they don't remember the horrors of it right now according to some polls more than half of American Millennials support socialism identify as socialists and it's so insidious it's because of this weak light education that they've had where they hear well there's capitalism over here and that's bad because my teacher told me and Hollywood told me that's bad because in all the movies the business guy is really bad okay so that's bad and communism that's probably bad I guess so let's go in the middle socialism that's fine socialism is good isn't it that's what they think they don't remember the stories from the Soviet Union from all the countries that were oppressed by the Soviet Union from all the failures of socialism all around the world they don't even read the news I mean this it isn't being reported very much right now that Venezuela is running out of water Venezuela a country that was doing basically fine as well as any Latin American country you know kind of ebb and flow in matters of prosperity and then they elected Hugo Chavez about 18 years ago open socialist essentially made himself a dictator what did he do he stole private businesses he stole industries that's called nationalizing that's socialist talk you say when you want to steal people's properties they we're in the national Iser we're gonna give this to the nation and what happened just misery endless misery ever since you've got people eating rats if they're lucky in the street to get a little bit of food rampant famines and now they're out of water they've run out of water and this isn't the first time they've run out of water they ran out of water in 2016 too that's socialism well you know more than half of American Millennials saying this that's the scary thing you had a socialist self-described socialist win in that Queens district nomination for that a Democrat nomination for that Congress seat she pretended that she was from the Bronx she pretended that she knew what poverty was she doesn't know what poverty is she grew up a town over from me in the wealthier town than me in Northern Westchester that's where she grow but she's pretending to be otherwise and a lot of these people who talk about how great communism is on paper how great socialism is in practice they grew up in luxury and wealth and prosperity they don't know it's very easy to think about those things when you watch your grandmother's starve like GMO did or you watch your family being killed then it isn't so nice is it and that's why it's so important we've got another part of this interview that we're gonna air either later this week or early next week it's so important that people see the reality of it I really think I don't even blame Millennials for their ignorance because they've been utterly failed by their educational systems and they and you know they think because they have a cell phone that they know everything this is I remember hearing this in high school they'd say you know you know more than Socrates knew you know more than a Aristotle because you have all this information at the tip of your fingers right but you have to read it to know more you have to have a context to know but you don't you just think okay well I've got all the information here I don't have to learn anything do I and so I don't really blame Millennials for their ignorance but you've got to put it in front of them images are very powerful the President Trump knows this good politicians know this that you have to see the image and the image that you have to look at is look in the face of gaeseong oh you'll see what communism does and you'll see why some people run away to freedom you know fourteen percent of American teens as of 2011 thought that Independence Day is when the United States declared independence from France okay you know but huge pluralities of the United States don't know that America declared independence on the 4th of July I bet ji-sung ho knows that I went down to Cuba another communist slave island back when they opened up American relations a year or so ago wanted to see really what it was like people all the time they say and I like smoking cigars but I didn't really want to see what it was like these people say oh it's so quaint oh it's so nice they don't need air conditioning there they just don't need it no they don't they don't need it it's very hot in Cuba it's that they can't have it the government doesn't let them have it they keep them in dire poverty the average income is $25 a month and I got to tell you they don't wear che guevara t-shirts down there I looked around I was there for three days just I just really to see it and they they wear American flags sewn onto their jeans on their bicycles if they can have a bicycle the American flags are all over the place that's the subversion and that's the symbol of what they hope for its American useful idiots who wear those Che Guevara t-shirts here I saw liberals met these a couple of lefty kids at the Havana Airport they said oh wow you know don't believe those Cubans they're really rich they really they have money they're just pretending because they couldn't they couldn't they had this cognitive dissonance they couldn't believe that the ideas that they advocate would leave to such human misery so they had to lie to resolve that cognitive dissonance they can either stop being socialists or pretend that these slave islands or other than they are but the reality is undeniable you can hear it from a guy like Jew song though so we're in have the rest of that any of you next week to round out today I guess I have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube to round out today I want to start out a new segment called this is America and because it but not like that song but but but but this is America you know the one that Donald Glover stole from that other guy you know that one yeah well we're gonna have a segment this is America to talk about these these stories that are quintessentially American that are utterly forgotten and that really tell you a lot about the American character so today I figure gee seong-ho the most heroic freedom lover I've ever met probably will ever meet is a good time to do it and because we have the fourth of July tomorrow so we're gonna talk about Samuel wit Whittemore and a few other of the great American Revolution guys before we get to that I'm sorry if you're on Facebook and YouTube I gotta say goodbye to you you have to go to daily wire comm you pay ten bucks a month hundred dollars for an annual membership you get me at the end or Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag a which get your questions in because I'll be answering them on Thursday none of that matters this is what matters the leftist tears because when you show them that everything that they believe is a lie that leads to human misery they cry they cry usually they'll laugh at you first and then you show them the reality of and then they start to cry because of the wickedness of their ideas so make sure that you can fill up your tumbler because also guys look we all know that for the left every single day is tax day April 15th depends on the year I guess and for the right every single day is the fourth of July you're gonna need this tomorrow folks they're gonna be stickers why we we can't collect taxes from everybody today is today's independent stuff just as good as ever maybe this might be the best day to drink them all year long July 4th so make sure you go to daily wire.com we'll be right back this is America boop-boop-boop dududududududududududu that's what this says we got to get a better intro than that I guess we just like superimpose my face on Donald's blubber like dododo so the fur the first guy were gonna talk about I really wanted to mention this on our daily wire backstage yesterday but it didn't come up because we started talking about hierarchies of values with Jordan Peterson and you know that just God that'll take you two hours so the Samuel Whittemore one of the unsung heroes of the American Revolution one of the biggest badasses of American history pardon my french I know I did a whole show on profanity yesterday this guy born in England in 1695 he comes over to America as a captain to fight the French in 1745 already love him it's fighting the French and American hobby is oldest time he while he's fighting the French in 1745 he captures a French officer's sword now he takes the sword this is now going to be Samuel Whittemore sword when he left in notes they asked how did you get that sword he said oh well the owner of the sword died suddenly how did he die Samuel Whittemore he'd just died suddenly and now I have his sword okay so after the war he doesn't go back to England he stays in America he buys a farm he lives in Massachusetts very nice some years go by 17:58 rolls around this is the French and Indian War is going on he joins up again because he didn't kill enough French the first time now he's 64 years old at this point this is not a young man anymore 64 years old he says now I gotta I gotta go kill some more French I got the bloodlust up in America so he joins up and he destroys he's in the company that destroys for it Louie Berg then after that he says I haven't killed enough French yet so he joins a general james wolf in a successful assault on quebec so he says ok goes up there he says we're gonna invade Canada which we should have done I mean it is you know we tried to convince Jordan Peterson of this yesterday this is America's hat Washington's biggest mistake could have had twice the country right now as he goes up and it is a successful assault on Quebec then 1763 rolls around as at this point what is he pushing 70 he leaves his entire family his wife his children his grandchildren because now he's killed enough French he wants to go kill some more Indians on behalf of America joins to fight the Indian Wars against Ottawa chief Pontiac so he goes over there he's just you know start slaughtering all these Indians and defending his country and he comes back from that war and all of a sudden he doesn't just have a sword he has two dueling pistols his family says Samuel where'd you get those dueling pistols he said oh the owner died suddenly died suddenly huh how'd he die suddenly I just died suddenly so now the American Revolution rolls around this guy is 80 years old he becomes an instant adopter of American independence he said I'm sick of this distant King telling us what to do I'm gonna support the Patriot cause they say Samuel you're a little old on account of you're 80 and you should have died years ago so now I'm gonna sign up anyway the Battle of Lexington and Concord happens he he sees 700 Brits coming down the street he says and this can't be good then he sees 1,400 Brits he says uh-oh not a good sign if the British are calling for a backup if they're calling for reinforcements so the British start burning down people's homes this is when Whittemore goes to war he grabs his musket he grabs his sword that he took from the guy he killed he takes the two dueling pistols that he had from the guy he killed he he he's waiting right he's laying in wait some other people are shooting at the British he waits until they get pretty pretty close he fires a shot from his musket instantly kills a British soldier he then drops the musket pulls out his dueling pistols almost point-blank range shoots one kills him dead shoots another one mortally wounds him leaves him for dead he that now it now is out of bullets and they are coming right up on him so he rips out his sword and starts sword fighting them as they're trying to bayonet him a British soldier loads his gun shoots him directly in the face Samuel Whittemore is now blasted through the face he gets knocked on the head with the butt of a musket and he's bayonetted 13 times left for dead in a pool of his own blood okay the British go away now the some of the Colonials see the Last Stand of Samuel Whittemore they say okay we should go up and get his body they go up to him lying in a pool of his own blood but he isn't lying dead he's lying there to reload his musket to go shoot more British they carry him down on it on a door a makeshift gurney you know and they carry him to Cooper tavern which was acting as a hospital they they say look this guy is so beyond dead he's lost all of his blood his face is totally mangled from getting you know shot in it and the family says please treat his wounds they say there's no point in treating his wounds he's dead he's 80 years old and he's blown up in the face and step banette at 13 times they say please just treat his wounds I'd say okay out of respect for Samuel Whittemore we'll treat his wounds and then he lives another 18 years it's another Amana made a full recovery he still was disfigured in his face and he loved that he relished the wound and said he was proud to show the wounds that he he gave for his country and he lived another 18 years he died of natural causes On February 3rd 1793 what a man what an American we got a few others now a lot of the Revolutionary War stories that we don't hear about we hear about the words that come from them so there are certain famous speeches that come you know my only regret is I have but one life to give for my country or whatever so the men from whom from which those phrases come lived incredible lives the Battle of Bunker Hill occurred after Lexington and Concord a couple months after June 17 1775 here enters John Stark John Stark also not a young man not a 16 year old is a 46 year old farmer from New Hampshire John Stark hears about the Battle of Lexington and Concord you know where Samuel Whittemore is busy getting shot in the face and just slaughtering the British he instantly the day he hears about it he recruits 400 men from New Hampshire to go to Boston and to to stop the British now coincidentally my ancestors John and Simon Knowles were living in New Hampshire I believe New Hampshire Maine and they also went down to the Battle of Bunker Hill after the news of Lexington and Concord John Knowles was killed there or died of his wounds from the battle and Simon Knowles fought there I think he was 16 or something and went on to serve in Washington's army at Valley Forge and rye White Plains went all around Stark is 46 much older than Simon Knowles at this point goes down gets to Bunker Hill and see it as one of the early and important battles in the war see is a gap in the Patriots defense there's a gap there the British can sneak up behind it squash the Patriots possibly end the this early momentum in the war so stark comes in and is widely credited with saving the day storks militia that he just made up himself on a day's notice hearing about Lexington and Concord starts militia then also later stopped the momentum of a British advance that was coming down from Canada at the Battle of Bennington and a great hero of the war in the 1809 reunion for the veterans of that battle he couldn't make it he was too old he felt he couldn't go down there anymore so he sent his regrets in the words he gave to send his regrets live free or die it's what he told his old veteran pals for at the reunion live free or die then 140 or so years later was adopted as the New Hampshire state motto it comes from that guy who helped save the war because he jumped on his country and saw a gap and made a really strategic play to help keep the momentum in the Patriots favor this brings us to Nathan Hale a personal favorite of mine Nate you know Ben went to college at like 16 or something Nathan Hale went to Yale at age 14 of though then these days you would go a little younger he graduated from Yale at 18 with first-class honors and he became a teacher in Connecticut so he's just living a nice life gonna become a teacher a nice you know English boy but George Washington needed a spy Washington personally needed a spy they needed a spy to figure out when the British were going to invade Manhattan the Patriots knew that the British were gonna come down and invade Manhattan they needed someone to go behind British lines and figure out when that was Washington asked for volunteers there was one volunteer Nathan Hale at this point he would have been what 20 years old 21 years old I believe so he goes behind he's gonna spy to figure out when they're gonna invade and quash an American independence and keep oppressing the United States the future United States there are two stories on how Nathan Hill was discovered one story is that major Robert Rogers British major saw Hale in a tavern Hale was wearing some sort of disguise and through his own trickery Roger was able to get Hale to expose himself the other story is that Nathan Hales loyalist cousin Samuel Hale just gave him away because the Revolutionary War split families families would be loyalist they had some port loyalists port Patriot and Hales kales cousin may have given him away so he gets arrested and before he's about to be hanged because hanging was the punishment for spies they believe that that being a spy as being an illegal combatant in war you're hanged immediately for it the night before that he was being held at General William house the British generals mansion the Beekman House one of the British headquarters in New York he's being held at the green house there Nathan Hale the night before he requests a Bible he says all right I'm gonna die can I at least have a Bible British say no denies his request he says can I have a clergyman denies his request absolutely not he's brought to the gallows September 22nd 1776 the kid is 21 years old goes up there and he gives some of the the famous words coincidentally actually the guy who hanged him is this guy Bill Richmond who's a 13 year old former slave who was a loyalist 13 years old and became a famous boxer in Europe later on he was the hangman Nathan Hale goes up and everybody says he gave a good speech he said I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country now some historians have questioned this they said it's too beautiful did you really say that I don't know it's well attested to by a ton of people who were there and historians who give different lines to you didn't just say that one sentence he said other variations on this and acquitted himself and a lot of people say he handled himself wet very well and explained that he would do it again he had no regrets and you know he loved his country that line also comes from Joseph Addison's play Cato the the total line is how beautiful is death when earned by virtue who would be not who would not be that youth what pity is it that we can die but once to serve our country so there's a thought that Nathan Hale was sort of paraphrasing that play but it's a beautiful sentiment a beautiful line very true also you hear the kind of classic maxim adultery at decorum esther pro patria mori it's sweet and seemly to die for your country and you see the reality of it this weren't just lines this just some little poetry this is a 21 year old kid full of promise who gave his life for his country and had no regrets faced it down encouraged if he had faced it down like a coward or tried to trade or cried at the gallows history wouldn't would either would not remember him or would treat him badly but he went there faced his faith straight on and he's an American Hero finally this brings us to John Paul Jones John Paul Jones father of the Navy rarely talked about this guy grew up in Scotland he's a was a sailor and he was a sailor on British merchant ships he comes to Virginia at some point in the 1770s unclear why a little bit of a hothead he may have killed a member of his crew on a British merchant ship it's unclear why he came he certainly likes the Patriot cause most of Virginia in the 1770s he's commissioned to the Continental Navy December 1775 the guy's 28 years old at this point so he is first lieutenant in the Continental Navy and he's the first guy to hoist the Grand Union Flag which I think I have I've got one right here let's say that is this flag this is the the first flag used by the Continental military and he hoisted that so he commanded the Ranger and he was sailing for France France is helping us end the war he's commanding the Ranger in quill Barron Bay in France on Valentine's Day 1778 Jones and Admiral Lamont Pickett exchanged salutes this is important it seems unimportant but it's very important because this is the first time the Stars and Stripes were recognized by a foreign country France is saying you are a country now we're gonna recognize you at sea so in 1779 a French King the French King gave Jones this very old ship the East Indiaman Duke Dubois enjoins named that BONHOMME RICHARD which was after his his patron and pal Benjamin Franklin so like Poor Richard's Almanack he named after Franklin he then immediately sails from France to raid English shipping a lot the British considered this guy a pirate because he didn't just go and start you know shooting boats off the coast of America there's a little smarter than that he said we're just gonna destroy the British ships off the coast of England so he goes from France he captures 17 merchant ships and 500 British prisoners then it comes his finest from one of the great moments of the Revolutionary War September 23rd 1779 he engages the HMS Serapis off the coast of England so this be a beautiful royal ship and immediately Jones gets blasted he you know the cannons hit him he loses a ton of his firepower he loses a lot of his Gunners there are sharpshooters shooting at him you know and the HMS Serapis calls that they say will you surrender we've just blown up your old ship basically and you're sinking hey will you surrender now and Jones and this is a test of two by multiple people calls out he says I have not yet begun to fight I have not yet begun which is true we hadn't begun to fight it's already sinking and you hadn't begun to fight so his ship is sinking down total American just like screw you man I'm not going down right he's being gunned down by sharpshooters and he's still fighting he had a second famous line from this episode he said I'm a sink but I'll be damned if I strike to strike his colors just surrender right so he says I'm a sink but I'll be damned if I strike the the boat is going down the ship is going down he from the beginning he's already losing he says I haven't begun to fight and what happens at the end of that battle the Serapis surrenders the Brits surrender by the way a day later the Richard is totally sunk Jones is then transferred to take control of the Serapis - absolutely shocking no one could have called this friend at the beginning of the fight after that he had a long career as a sailor ends up sailing for the Empress Catherin of Russia he's returned to France afterward and he dies there just to get a dig in at the revolutionary French because the aristocratic French the French monarchy helped us get our independence love those guys those guys were great then a bunch of jerk French came in and chopped off all of their heads the revolutionaries the lefties which is why when we criticize France we're criticizing the guy those guys I liked the aristocrats but those guys were awful they come in and they start selling cemeteries taking over churches knocking them down selling cemeteries so we had no idea where Jones was buried this amazing hero finally we were able to track it down and claim his body but because of those damned left revolutionary French we lost it for a long time that's our show the Michael Nolt show
