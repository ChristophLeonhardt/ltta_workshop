1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,080
When I’m at the start gate and
I’m preparing to visualize,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,040
I’m usually looking
down the course.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,920
Usually I’ve memorized
the course to almost a T.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,750
Pull out of the gate, flat,
roller, roller, roller,

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,400
stay flat, don’t speed
check — you’ve got this.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,830
Pop, tabletop, pop
down, turn one —

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,510
Any time I feel my
heart rate starting

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,170
to go up, whether it’s
good or bad, I reset.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,770
I go to my happy place,
which is usually home.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,450
I have my entire family, my
mom’s cooking, sit with my dad,

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,220
and I can smell Cajun food —

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,920
I’m from Louisiana.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,220
Roller, turn two, absorb hole —

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,500
After having my daughter,
for whatever reason,

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,320
while I was competing,
I heard my mom’s voice

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,620
saying, “Come on, baby."

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,062
Because she used to say that
in all my gymnastics videos.

18
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:49,020
I could hear my mom being
like, “Come on, baby.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,050
Come on, baby."

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,580
Four, drawn out.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,640
Five, super tight.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
Waterfall.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,020
Six, speed check.

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,860
Jump.

25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,660
Seven — tight.

26
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,680
Eight, hold speed, roller,
roller, roller, jump, finish.

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,430
I’m always envisioning
the course and winning.

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,910
I hear “Brenna Huckaby,
U.S.A.," and you’re like, wait.

29
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,740
That’s not right.

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,790
But you go up to the
first place anyway.

31
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,390
There’s a pink background
behind me, there’s a bear,

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,100
there’s little flowers that
they made, and I see the seats.

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,740
And I see myself
standing in first.

34
00:01:29,247 --> 00:01:30,830
The reason I love
snowboarding so much

35
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,750
is because I feel
like everyone else.

36
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,380
I cover my — well, not cover
my leg because I want to,

37
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,150
but it’s cold, so
I put my pants down

38
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,720
and nobody knows that I’m
missing a leg, and I love that.

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,580
It just gives me that
sense of freedom.

40
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,227
Whenever I’m walking
down the street,

41
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,310
someone’s always staring
or someone’s always gotta

42
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,254
bring that up.

43
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:51,170
Being on snow and being
in my snowboard pants,

44
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,400
like, I’m away from that.

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:00:00,000
Just — I’m just Brenna,
and I love that.
