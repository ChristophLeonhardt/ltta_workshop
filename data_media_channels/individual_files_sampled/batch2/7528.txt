GoDaddy has decided to cut loose the daily stormer which it was hosting and those of you who are familiar with the daily stormer know that it is a blog that's run by white nationalists that like to say pretty terrible things about Jewish people and minorities and so after the murder of Heather hire they decided daily stormer decided to publish a pretty disgusting blog post and so just this pause here for a second in case you didn't watch the news at all this weekend Heather hire was the person who was killed in Charlottesville when a domestic terrorist ran into a crowd of peaceful protesters 19 were injured and Heather was killed the guy we now know is a neo-nazi and and sympathize with them and and praised the concentration camps of the Nazis so that's who did it so daily Stormers reaction was to blame heather higher right and so they posted a blog that said the following this is the headline or the title of the blog heather hire woman killed in road rage incident was a fat child list 32 year old slut finally GoDaddy had enough of this and they decided to drop the daily stormer in fact they tweeted they had informed the Daily stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider as they violated the Terms of Service now at that point they decided the daily storm were the people behind it decided to register with Google however Google also was not having any of it on Monday the daily stormer registered its site with Google via an automated process shortly before 11 a.m. Eastern Time about three hours later Google said it had canceled the registration and that it may take up to 48 hours for that to go into effect I guess people keep getting surprised that neo-nazis are Nazis that they that's they favor fascism they favor violence they actually hate people they hate and that is the point of their existence and their ideology so since the president and his chief strategist are catering to the all right there's an attempt and there has been this entire time to try to create some sort of false equivalency as Trump did after the murder of Heather hire by saying many sides do it right no no no there was one clear side who did it and even the press who's been pretty tough on Trump have this gut instinct that well I mean I should I calling somebody a neo-nazis pretty harsh no no the story that the site is named after a Nazi propaganda publication literally and they if you go to the site they tell you how the Jews run things and the Jews are the worst and blacks are the worst and gays are the worst and said they're neo-nazis so I'm a little annoyed that it's taking this long for people to acknowledge the most obvious thing in the world right the daily stormer is a pro-nazi website also also what always strikes me is the amount of emphasis there is in conservative media toward ridiculing criticizing and just straight out you know making things up about black lives matter right so black lives matter there was one instance of a couple people who said a chant or what was the chant are gonna remember surprise like bacon right yeah that's it that's all they would touch like and and by the way that wasn't even an accurate depiction of black lives matter they were kidding around all the cops who were actually escorting them in that protest it's all totally made up to say oh and and Fox News said black lives matter are terrorists that's really chance that's right so so I'm the reason why I'm bringing that up is because the same people who published this kind of garbage online essentially ridiculing someone who was murdered because they were counter protesting are the same people who will turn around and say oh well black people are violent they're culturally defiant they're dangerous no you're dangerous you're dangerous okay people who make excuses for an individual who literally ran into a group of counter protesters those are the dangerous people okay I don't think violence should be used by anyone on any side but to make these false equivalencies between you know neo-nazis and black lives matter is absolutely ridiculous and they know it they know it it's grotesque to even have the conversation but look you can say hey freedom of speech you got a right to be a Nazi congratulations go enjoy your right to be a Nazi but in this case they're condoning the violence Heather hire was murdered and they're saying oh she was a slut what on God's green earth so well it gives you a sense of what they think about women as well I mean let alone everything else and so it you've crossed into a different area where you are clearly obviously condoning the violence so you can argue about what Go Daddy should have done or Google should or should not do have at it Hoss you you want to die on that hill of defending the right of neo-nazis the to condone violence that's your choice help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network calm slash join
