1
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:02,215
IN PROTEST WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

2
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:03,883
TRIES TO PUT WORKING PEOPLE

3
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:04,217
FIRST.

4
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:08,221
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF THE G7

5
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:12,225
ELITE MELTDOWN AT FNC.

00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:14,027
JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS FOX

7
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:16,796
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR LISA BOOTH AND

8
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:18,164
BRUCE HEYMAN.

9
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:19,666
MR. HEYMAN, I WAS INTERESTED

10
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,669
THAT YOU RETWEETED TODAY

11
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:23,336
SOMETHING FROM THE NEW YORK

12
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:23,636
TIMES.

13
00:00:23,636 --> 00:00:25,138
BUT -- THAT I THINK REALLY WELL

14
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:27,907
CAPTURES THE ATTITUDE OF THE

15
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:29,542
ELITE TO WHAT WENT DOWN AT THAT

16
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:32,045
SUMMIT IN CANADA WITH A TWEET

17
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,680
STORM FROM AIR FORCE ONE

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,482
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALL BUT BLEW UP

19
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,250
THE GROUP OF SEVEN NATIONS THAT

20
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,651
THE UNITED STATES LED FOR MORE

21
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:42,188
THAN SEVEN DECADES AND DECLARED

22
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:43,957
POLITICAL WAR ON ITS CLOSEST

23
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:44,324
NEIGHBOR.

24
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:48,027
THIS IS SO OVERTOP.

25
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:48,928
IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT YOU'RE

26
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:49,696
EXPERIENCING, YOU AND YOURS THAT

27
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:52,999
HAVE THAT VIEW, IS JUST SHOCK AT

28
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:53,733
THE DEMOCRATIC PROTEST FINALLY

29
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:54,067
WORKING.

30
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:54,767
THAT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND

31
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,236
YEARS, PEOPLE VOTE IN ELECTION.

32
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:58,338
NOTHING REALLY CHANGES.

33
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:00,840
IN 2016 SOMEONE IS ELECTED WHO

34
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,375
PROMISES TO CHANGE AND YOU CAN'T

35
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,944
QUITE BELIEVE THAT HE'S ACTUALLY

36
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:05,345
DOING IT.

37
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:08,047
>> OH, SO, HERE IS THE REALITY

38
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:08,348
HERE.

39
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:09,516
AND THE THING THAT I KNOW SO

40
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:10,483
WELL, THE UNITED STATES AND

41
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,784
CANADA HAVE NO BETTER

42
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:12,485
RELATIONSHIP THAN ANY TWO

43
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:13,520
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.

44
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,956
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRADE,

45
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,158
$680 BILLION IN GOODS AND

46
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:19,926
SERVICES IN THE U.S. HAS A

47
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:22,629
SURPLUS IN TRADE.

48
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:23,229
THIS IS OUR BEST FRIEND.

49
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:24,063
THIS IS OUR BEST ALLY.

50
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:25,565
AND SO TO TREAT CANADA IN THE

51
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:29,235
WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN TREATING

52
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:29,802
INAPPROPRIATE.

53
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:31,204
THAT BEING SAID, I THINK CALMER

54
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:32,272
VOICES NEED TO COME IN.

55
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:35,008
AND WE NEED TO FIND A PASSIVE

56
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:35,375
SOLUTION.

57
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,743
BUT, DON'T GET ME WRONG, THIS IS

58
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,611
ABOUT JOBS TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.

59
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:40,246
MILLIONS OF U.S. JOBS, MIDDLE

60
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,648
CLASS, GOOD-PAYING JOBS ARE DUE

61
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,616
TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CANADA.

62
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:47,954
AND SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE MISS

63
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:48,354
PLACED THIS.

64
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:48,821
AND I HEAR YOU.

65
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:49,122
LOOK.

66
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:49,789
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

67
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,590
EXCITEMENT AROUND POPULOUS.

68
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,658
AND YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT

69
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:52,926
AROUND THE WORLD IN TERMS OF

70
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:54,561
VOTING AND OUTCOMES.

71
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:55,762
BUT I THINK SOMETIMES WE PUT A

72
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:57,730
GUN TO OUR HEAD AND START

73
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,098
CLICKING THE TRIGGER, ESPECIALLY

74
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:00,133
AS IT COMES TO CANADA.

75
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,534
I THINK WE'RE MAKING A HUGE

76
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:04,671
ERROR HERE, SIR.

77
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:05,705
>> STEVE:  BUT WHY DO YOU THINK

78
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,241
IT'S NOT OKAY FOR THE PRESIDENT

79
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,175
TO JUST SIMPLY MOVE FORWARD ON

80
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:10,977
THE THINGS HE WAS ELECTED TO DO

81
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,845
AND SPECIFICALLY TO PUT THE

82
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:14,214
AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST?

83
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:18,117
ONE PARTICULAR THING EVERYONE IS

84
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:18,785
GOING ON ABOUT HOW AMAZING

85
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:19,152
CANADA IS.

86
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:19,953
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

87
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:20,887
>> STEVE:  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF

88
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:23,223
WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN

89
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:26,693
THE NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE

90
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,062
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT.

91
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:29,862
JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS

92
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:30,196
DISPUTE.

93
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:32,232
>> LOOK, WE NEED TO HAVE A

94
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:35,068
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT OF SOME TYPE.

95
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:38,504
>> STEVE:  BUT LET'S JUST

96
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:39,639
EXPLAIN TO THE AUDIENCE WHAT IS

97
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,773
GOING ON HERE WHICH IS THAT

98
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:41,941
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO

99
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,244
TAKE OUT OF NAFTA A PROVISION

100
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,045
THAT MEANS THAT MULT NATIONAL

101
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:47,547
CORPORATIONS CAN GET ANY

102
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:48,915
DISPUTES WITH THE GOVERNMENT

103
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,416
DEALT WITH BY A BUNCH OF

104
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,185
BUREAUCRATS SO THAT A COMPANY, A

105
00:02:52,185 --> 00:03:00,260
FOREIGN COMPANY THAT OPERATES IN

106
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,994
AMERICA IS SUBJECT TO AMERICAN

107
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:01,294
COURT.

108
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,263
AND IT'S THEM THAT IS NOMINATING

109
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:03,730
AGAINST VOICE.

110
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,132
>> LOOK, I'M NOT GETTING -- I'M

111
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,735
NOT GETTING -- I'M NOT THE TRADE

112
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:09,769
NEGOTIATOR HERE BETWEEN OUR TWO

113
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:10,236
COUNTRIES TODAY.

114
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:11,537
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, THIS

115
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,906
AGREEMENT HAS PRODUCED A LOT OF

116
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:15,608
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS.

117
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:18,044
35 U.S. STATES, THEIR NUMBER ONE

118
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:19,612
EXPORT MARKET IS TO CANADA.

119
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:23,750
AND WE HAVE A VERY BOUND TRICK.

120
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,984
IN AGRICULTURE, U.S. HAS A

121
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,152
SURPLUS OF AGRICULTURE WITH

122
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:26,486
CANADA.

123
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:26,986
>> STEVE:  OKAY.

124
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:28,921
I DON'T WANT TO GET BOGGED DOWN.

125
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,657
I'M SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF.

126
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:32,258
BECAUSE WE WERE HOPEFUL -- I'M

127
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:33,126
MAKING A GENERAL POINT HERE

128
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:36,029
ABOUT THE FACT THAT JUST THE

129
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,665
VERY NOTION OF CHALLENGING THIS

130
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,367
STUFF IS SEEN AS JUST COMPLETELY

131
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:42,502
BEYOND THE PAIR.

132
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:45,605
HOW DARE HE EVEN ARGUE WITH OUR

133
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:45,938
ALLIES.

134
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:49,409
>> WELL, PAYING ATTENTION TO THE

135
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:49,809
2016 ELECT.

136
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:52,512
BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED,

137
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:53,246
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES FEEL LIKE

138
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:53,746
HE HAD A MANDATE.

139
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:54,547
LOOK, HIS ELECTION WAS A DIRECT

140
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:55,715
RESPONSE TO WHAT WE SAW FROM

141
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:56,482
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHERE AMERICANS

142
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:58,117
FELT LIKE WE WERE WEAK ON THE

143
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:58,551
WORLD STAGE.

144
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:00,887
AND THEY ELECTED SOMEONE WHO HAD

145
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:01,788
A POSITION OF STRENGTH WHO SAID

146
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:02,889
THAT I'M GOING TO GO IN.

147
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,760
I'M GOING TO SHAKE THINGS UP.

148
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,494
I'M GOING TO CHANGE SORT OF THE

149
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:09,562
GLOBAL STATUS QUO THAT WE'VE

150
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:10,530
BEEN SEEING THAT AMERICANS WERE

151
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,331
DISSATISFIED WITH.

152
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:14,200
LOOK, IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT TRUMP

153
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,735
AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS THE FACT

154
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:18,338
THAT THE NAFTA DEAL IS WEAK, HOW

155
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,305
ELSE DO YOU EXTRACT EXTRACTIONS.

156
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:20,673
>> RIGHT.

157
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:23,543
>> OR IN CONCESSIONS WITHOUT

158
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,744
UTILIZING SOME SORT OF LEVERAGE.

159
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:28,314
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE

160
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:29,515
ALUMINUM AND STEEL TARIFFS COME

161
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:29,982
INTO PLAY.

162
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:31,451
IS PRESIDENT TRUMP TRYING TO USE

163
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,688
THAT AS LEVERAGE AGAINST CANADA

164
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:36,089
AND MEXICO.

165
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:37,123
ALSO, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

166
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:38,024
ALREADY DONE EVERYTHING HE SAID

167
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:38,958
HE WAS GOING TO DO.

168
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,094
HE PULLED OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL.

169
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,729
THE PARIS ACCORD DEAL.

170
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,598
SENDING A VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO

171
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:46,332
THE REST OF THE WORLD IF YOU'RE

172
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:49,569
NOT WITH US FOR SOME OF THESE

173
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:50,370
ALONE.

174
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:51,537
I AGREE WITH THAT VERY MUCH.

175
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:53,373
AMBASSADOR, I WOULD HATE TO TAKE

176
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:55,241
A SHOT AT YOUR FORMER

177
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:55,641
PROFESSION.

178
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:58,845
BUT ISN'T IT ALSO GOOD NEWS THAT

179
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:00,179
FINALLY THANKS TO PRESIDENT

180
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:03,449
TRUMP WE'RE PULLING THE VEIL

181
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,551
FROM THIS RIDICULOUS GAME OF

182
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:07,120
DIPLOMACY THAT GOES ON THAT THEY

183
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,358
TRY TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE'S

184
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:12,658
VIEW.

185
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,260
THEY COVER UP THE REALITY.

186
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,296
IT'S JUST TRANSPARENT, ISN'T IT?

187
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:19,866
BETTER THAN DIPLOMACY?

188
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:20,049
TNCHTS

189
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:20,633
TNCHT

190
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:20,867
.

191
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:24,003
>> LOOK, I'M A VERY FRANK PERSON

192
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:24,670
AND OUTSPOKEN.

193
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,905
I THINK THE CANADIANS WOULD TELL

194
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,540
YOU THAT.

195
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,209
I BRING UP ISSUES THAT ARE A

196
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,043
CONCERN WITH THE UNITED STATES.

197
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:32,412
WE HAVE NO BETTER FRIEND IN THE

198
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:32,712
WORLD.

199
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:36,416
AND WHEN WE SIT DOWN AND TALK

200
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,083
ABOUT TRADE IN DOLLARS AND

201
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,850
CENTS, YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT

202
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,418
OF HOW IMPORTANT THIS

203
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,152
RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN TO THE

204
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:39,619
UNITED STATES.

205
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,487
THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR US AT

206
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,289
EVERY TWIST AND TURN IN OUR DEEP

207
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,891
HISTORY WITH THEM.

208
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,391
150 YEARS.

209
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:48,628
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO HELPED

210
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,897
FAIR OUR DIPLOMATS OUT OF IRAN

211
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:52,231
WHEN THE AYATOLLAH CAME OVER AND

212
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,534
TOOK OVER.

213
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:55,268
THEY WERE THE ONES WITH US AT

214
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:55,868
9/11.

215
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:56,869
>> STEVE:  HE'S NOT TRYING TO

216
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:59,705
INVADE CANADA.

217
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:00,406
HE'S NOT TRYING IT DO THAT.

218
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:01,707
HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET A FAIR

219
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:02,575
DEAL FOR AMERICA.

220
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:05,711
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

221
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:07,413
PEOPLE WEIGH -- THEY BLOW UP

222
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:08,214
EVERYTHING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

223
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:09,982
THE ECONOMY WAS SUPPOSED TO

224
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:10,683
CRASH UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

225
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:11,918
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED.

226
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,886
WITH FIRE AND FURY, WE'RE ON THE

227
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:16,656
BRINK OF WORLD WAR 3.

228
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:17,223
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.

229
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,191
SO I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

230
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,392
EARNED SOME LATITUDE IN THE

231
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:21,060
SENSE WHERE WE'VE SEEN THESE

232
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,095
OVERREACTIONS AND THEY END UP

233
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:25,465
REALLY NOT MEETING THAT PLACE

234
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:26,899
WHERE EVERYONE IS OVERREACTING.

235
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:29,969
IT ENDS UP NOT BEING BAD AT ALL

236
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,270
AND ULTIMATELY IT ENDS UP

237
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,004
WORKING IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

238
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:32,939
FAV.

239
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,141
SO, WHO KNOWS, MAYBE IT'S TOO

240
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,742
EARN TO SEE WHERE THEY GO BUT I

241
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:38,144
THINK HE'S EARNED SOME LATITUDE.

242
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:38,778
>> STEVE:  EXACTLY.

243
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:40,680
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS WHEN ALL

244
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,048
OF THESE EXPERTS JUST SAY, WELL,

245
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,883
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SAY THESE

246
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:44,217
THINGS.

247
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:48,054
IT'S JUST NOT -- YOU JUST HAVE

248
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:48,788
TO FOLLOW THE SCRIPT THAT'S BEEN

249
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:49,088
THERE.

250
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:49,755
THE SCRIPT HASN'T WORKED.

251
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:50,957
>> WELL, AND TOO, STEVE, I THINK

252
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:54,994
WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT PHOTO OF

253
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:55,628
OTHER WORLD LEADERS AND

254
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:56,362
PRESIDENT TRUMP STARING EACH

255
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:58,231
OTHER DOWN, THEY SEE LEADERSHIP

256
00:06:58,231 --> 00:06:59,665
AND A POSITION OF STRENGTH WHICH

257
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:02,768
WE DIDN'T SEE UNDER PRESIDENT

258
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:03,069
OBAMA.

259
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:03,736
AND, AGAIN, I REALLY THINK

260
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:04,504
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ELECTION WAS A

261
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:05,605
RESPONSE FROM THE WEAKNESS OF

262
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:06,105
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

263
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:08,574
THEY WANTED AMERICA TO BE STRONG

264
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:08,875
AGAIN.

265
00:07:08,875 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANTED AMERICA TO ASSERT
