THAT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION IS NOT WHAT THEY SAID IT WAS. IT IS THAT HAS BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING BEEN A WITCH HUNT. TOM HAS BEEN HAS BEEN TRACKING THE INVESTIGATIONS FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY AND HE'S ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF JUDICIAL WATCH AND HE JOINS US NOW. TOM, IS THAT AN UNFAIR SUMMARY OF WHAT WE LEARNED? HAVE I MISSED SOMETHING? HAVE WE GOTTEN ANY INDICATION OF ACTUAL COLLUSION A YEAR INTO THIS? NO WE HAVEN'T. YOU'VE BEEN MUCH TOO CHARITABLE. IF HONESTLY EVALUATED, THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER. IF THE MEDIA WERE COVERING THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION THE WAY IT WAS COVERING THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE IT HASN'T WORKED. IT'S FAILING. IT WAS CREATED BASED ON AN ILLEGAL LEAK BY JAMES COMEY. MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO INSPIRE THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION WERE FIRED FROM THE GOVERNMENT. SALLY EIGHTS, THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL. ANDREW McCABE, THE DEPUTY AG. JAMES COMEY, THE FBI DIRECTOR. ANDREW McCABE, EXCUSE ME THE DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR. ALL THREE FIRED FOR MISCONDUCT. THEY HELP GET THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION WILL IMPAIRED THE CLINTON EMAIL DOSSIER. WE HAVE THE FLYNN INVESTIGATION UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE OF THE CORRUPT WAY WHICH IT WAS INITIATED AND INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI WERE HIT THEY THAT HE LIED WHEN EVIDENTLY HE DIDN'T. AND ON TOP OF THAT WE GOT A FEDERAL JUDGE QUESTIONING THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OF MR. MUELLER AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS AUTHORITY IS A YEAR OUT BECAUSE HE HAS EVIDENTLY HAD SECRET CONVERSATIONS WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. AND ON TOP OF IT, THE RUSSIA, THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, THE KEY ASPECT OF IT, THE RUSSIA TROLL INDICTMENT, IT'S NOW BEING TURNED INTO WHEN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE TO GO IN AND DEMAND EVIDENCE FOR WHAT THEY HAVE ON INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS, MAINLY INTERVENTION IN ORDER ELECTION. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VICTIMIZED THROUGH ALL OF THIS. EVIDENTLY THERE'S NOTHING TO JUSTIFY AN INVESTIGATION OF HIM REQUIRING JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RESOURCES. Tucker: I THOUGHT CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, THE WHOLE POINT OF THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL IS TO ENSURE THE REST OF US THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS ON THE LEVEL, NOT TAINTED BY POTENTIAL CONFLICTS. GIVEN THAT, WHY DIDN'T MUELLER TRY HARDER TO AT LEAST SEEN BY PART OF BIPARTISAN, MAYBE HIRING ONE REGISTER OF REPUBLICAN AS INVESTIGATOR, HE DIDN'T BOTHER TO DO THAT. THE ARROGANCE OF THE DEEP STATE. THEY THINK THEY CAN DO NO WRONG. MUELLER AND COMEY ARE PART OF THE SAME TEAM ON THAT REGARD. ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE THEM HIRING DEMOCRATS WITH ABANDON AND THEN YOU HAVE THE TEXT MESSAGES. HE KEPT THOSE TWO FBI AGENTS OFF OF HIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE OF BIAS AND HID THAT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR FOUR MONTHS. MR. COMEY, IF YOU ARE A TYPICAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO RESIGN A LONG TIME AGO. Tucker: THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT. TOM FITTON, FOLLOWING THIS FROM DAY ONE, THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. Tucker: IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S FOR LUNCH IS STILL MUCH WHAT WAS FOCUS ON RUSSIA COLLUSION MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE POLITICALLY. AN ARTICLE THIS MORNING IN "THE DAILY BEAST" MAKES A LUDICROUS CLAIM. IT SAYS THAT DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY WANTED TO SPEND THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TALKING ABOUT REAL ISSUES, HEALTH CARE AND THE ECONOMY, BUT THEY COULDN'T SOMEHOW BECAUSE CABLE NEWS STOPS THEM. RACHEL MADDOW TOLD THEM NOT TO APPARENTLY. CABLE INSTEAD FORCED THEM TO TALK ABOUT RUSSIA. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO. LUCKILY WE KEPT COPIES OF THE TAPE AND HERE'S WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SAID ABOUT RUSSIA. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT RUSSIA ATTACKED US. ATTACK ON THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. AN ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY. WE ARE ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE RUSSIANS DID TO AFFECT OUR ELECTIONS. I THINK THERE IS A BROAD RECOGNITION AMONG OUR MEMBERS THAT RUSSIA IS NOT OUR FRIEND. WHY DOES AN OUTWARD DONALD TRUMP THAT THE RUSSIANS ACCORDING TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TRIED TO, AND INDEED DID KIND OF INFILTRATE AND UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY BY WHAT THEY DID? Tucker: RICHARD GOODSTEIN IS A LAWYER, HE ADVISED BOTH OF HILLARY CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT FOR WHAT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH CONVERSATION I FOR HIM I WOULD SAY. I DON'T THINK SO. Tucker: IT'S NOT REALLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CASE YOU CAN ARGUE THAT RUSSIA HACKED OUR ELECTION AS DEMOCRATS HAVE ARGUED FOR THE LAST YEAR. THEY ARE OUR MAIN ENEMY IN THE WORLD AS THEY ALSO ARGUE. MAYBE TIME WILL PROVE YOU'RE RIGHT. I DOUBT IT BUT MAY BE. YOU CAN'T ARGUE IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT THAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS THE ISSUES. IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT RUSSIA, YOU JUST HAPPEN TO TALK ABOUT IT NONSTOP FOR A YEAR. NOBODY'S GOING TO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE IT'S A LIE. IF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, NOT DEMOCRATS, NOT REPUBLICANS. THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS THE GROUP THAT SAID THAT THE RUSSIANS TRY TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY. DON'T LAY THAT OFF ON ME. Tucker: THERE IS NO INTELLIGENCE. THERE ARE A NUMBER A FEDERAL AGENCIES, THERE IS NO INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON ANYTHING. THERE'S A DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. HEAD OF CIA. EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO IS CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING INTELLIGENCE FOR THIS COUNTRY WHEN ASKED AND WHEN THEIR AGENCY WAS ASKS THAT THE RUSSIANS TRY TO INTERFERE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE RUSSIANS APPROACHED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND SAID WE HAVE STOLEN MATERIALS, WOULD YOU LIKE THEM FROM THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN. DONALD TRUMP JR. SAID LOVE IT. PUTTING ASIDE WHAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENED LATER Tucker: I WOULD SAY WE FILED THIS GROUND BEFORE. WHAT I'M ASKING WAS A POLITICAL QUESTION. CLEARLY THIS IS NOT BEARING FRUIT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEIR LEAD IS WITHIN A MARGIN OF ERROR. IT'S JUST NOT WORKING. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RETAKE CONGRESS ON THE STRENGTH OF THE RUSSIA STORY. AND NOW THEY'RE TELLING US WE NEVER WANTED TO ABOUT RUSSIA IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT'S A LIE. DON'T LIE TO ME WHEN I'VE BEEN WATCHING TV FOR THE PAST YEAR AND ALL YOU TALKED ABOUT HIS RUSSIA. DID RACHEL MADDOW MAKE YOU DO THAT? DON'T LIE TO ME. THE FACT IS I THINK THERE'S TWO TRACKS. I THINK THE FACT IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY KNOWS IT'S NOT GOING TO WIN THIS ELECTION. THEY WILL NOT WIN THE 2018 ELECTIONS JUST TALK ABOUT MUELLER OR TRUMP EVEN. THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE AGENDA ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS DONALD TRUMP WE USED TO SAY YOU HAD HISTORICALLY LOW APPROVAL RATINGS. I CHECKED TODAY, JIMMY CARTER ACTUALLY EDGED THEM OUT SO HE'S NOW SECOND MOST UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT THIS FAR INTO IT. Tucker: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. EVERY ELECTION WE JUST HAD THAT SPECIAL ELECTION IN ARIZONA. TRUMP WON BY 21, THE REPUBLICAN WON BY FIVE. EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN WON THE HOUSE LAST YEAR BY 16 POINTS OR UNDER HAS TO BE LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDER SCARED TO DEATH BECAUSE THIS MOMENTUM. Tucker: DEMOCRATS HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY. IT'S A MIDTERM IN THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST TERM. OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO GAIN SEATS. THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN I THINK TO ELECTIONS IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT DEMOCRATS DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY ARE A LOCK TO WIN THAT THE AMERICAN HOUSE. HALF THE COUNTRY IS LIKE HIM. DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE WAY FAR AHEAD OF WHERE THEY ARE TODAY. THE REASON THEY ARE NOT FARTHER AHEAD IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT RUNNING ON EVERYTHING. THEY ARE RUNNING ON THINGS LIKE MORE ABORTION AND MORE ILLEGAL ALIENS. THAT'S INSANE AND IT SCARES PEOPLE, YOU KNOW THAT. WE WILL SEE WHEN THE 2018 MIDTERMS ROLLED AROUND. ALL WE KNOW IS FROM EVERY OTHER SINGLE SPECIAL ELECTION THE DEMOCRATIC WAVE SEEMS TO BE ON THE ORDER OF TEN, 15%. YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT AT THIS POINT, THAT WILL TAKE OUT A LOT OF INCUMBENT REPUBLICANS. WILL IT CONTINUE? THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. Tucker: JUST FOR THE SAKE OF HONESTY, WILL YOU CONCEDE THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T SPEND THE LAST YEAR TELLING US THAT RUSSIA HACKED OUR ELECTIONS, WHATEVER THAT MEANS, IT WAS A LIE. BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE RACHEL MADDOW MADE THEM FOR MORNING JOE SENT THEM A MEMO AND THEY HAD TO OBEY. IT'S BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK AND IT DIDN'T. THEY WERE HORRIFIED THAT THE REPUBLICANS DID THIS AND THAT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS INDIFFERENT OR WORSE WAS COMPLICIT. THAT'S THE THING THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. Tucker: THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COUNTRY. IF THEY CARED ABOUT THE COUNTRY THEY WOULD SECURE THE BORDERS AND FIGHT BACK AGAINST CHINA. THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY CONTROLLING OUR POLICY. NO PUSHBACK FROM THE DEMOCRATS AT ALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE. WE HAD A NET OUTFLOW FROM U.S. TO MEXICO. THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WE HAD A NET OUTFLOW. THAT'S HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT
