I want to show you two images from social media first is the biography that Rachel McKinnon puts on his and I'm you know what I'm sorry I don't want to say her I don't want to go along with the Emperor's New Clothes because because this person is making an issue out of it so on his biography he says strident feminist strident feminist and then show the Instagram picture again because here's the point I want to make so in the in the picture not not these hashtags show the image itself if you please because you have Rachel McKinnon which is what the transgender man standing between two women how long until all three people on the podium our transgender man I'd say not long at all because it won't be long that's a good point that's a good point then and how's that a strident feminist I'm sorry that's not a strident that's that's a wolf in sheep's clothing a Trojan horse of a feminist using the word feminism to destroy women sport when all three people on the podium or transgender man who the hell is gonna watch that who the hell is gonna answer that sports league it's it's it's just absurd it's ridiculous and slowly but surely look you have transgender men women going into women's prisons you know into rape shelters you can't you can't keep pushing this idea of inclusivity and this idea of a social construct you can push it so far but no further this this idea that gender and biology are completely detached it's going to show up in some in in women as a category as a biological category becoming totally erased and you know me Ezra I'm no feminist but I'm on the side of the radical feminists on this one they they feel themselves being erased as a unique category in biological category and they are and that's and and actually you bring up a very good point one day we will see three trans women on the podium and and that will be the end of women's sports that'll be the end unless they do something about it now that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra Levant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel on media / shows you
