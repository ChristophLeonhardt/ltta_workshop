00:00:01,431 --> 00:00:02,632

6
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:10,206

LOOK AT OUR FUTURE RATE

11
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:17,847
RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN.

12
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:20,483
AND NEW QUESTIONS TONIGHT, IF

13
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:21,451
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS URGING THE

14
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:24,887
PEOPLE OF IRAN TO PUSH OUT THE

15
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:25,254
AYATOLLAH.

16
00:00:25,254 --> 00:00:26,255
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO

17
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:28,624
IS NOW THREATENING IRAN WITH

18
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:29,392
NORTH KOREA-STYLE SANCTIONS.

19
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:30,093
I ASKED VICE PRESIDENT PENCE

20
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:33,229
ABOUT THAT.

21
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:35,264
>> Martha: WITH REGARD TO

22
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:37,467

TODAY TWEETED TO THE IRANIAN

24
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:40,837
PEOPLE REALLY, DO YOU WANT YOUR

25
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:43,005
COUNTRY TO BE KNOWN AS

26
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:43,706
COCONSPIRATOR WITH HEZBOLLAH,

27
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:46,008
HAMAS, THE TALIBAN.

28
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:49,011
THE PRESIDENT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO

29
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:49,946
SAID RECLAIM YOUR HERITAGE.

30
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:51,848
IS THIS ADMINISTRATION

31
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:54,417
ENCOURAGING REBELLION ON THE

32
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:55,485
PART OF THE IRANIAN PEOPLE TO

33
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:57,653
PUSH BACK AGAINST THAT REGIME

34
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:58,621
AND THAT LEADERSHIP?

35
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,123
>> I THINK WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

36
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:01,190
HAS MADE CLEAR, AND YOU'RE THE

37
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,126
SECRETARY MAKE CLEAR TODAY IS

38
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:06,763
THAT WE ARE WITH THE PEOPLE OF

39
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:07,964
IRAN.

40
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:09,999
YOU ACTUALLY SAW DEMONSTRATIONS

41
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:14,036
ALL OVER IRAN DURING THE LAST

42
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:14,637
YEARS.

43
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:15,405
YOU REMEMBER THE GREEN

44
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:16,239
REVOLUTION OF JUST A FEW SHORT

45
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,740
YEARS AGO THAT WAS PUT DOWN BY

46
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,810
THE AYATOLLAHS.

47
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,614
THE PEOPLE OF IRAN DESERVE

48
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:27,049
BETTER THAN A REGIME THAT

49
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,418
SPONSORS TERRORISM ACROSS THE

50
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:29,419
REGION.

51
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:30,953
THE PEOPLE OF IRAN DESERVE

52
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:31,587
BETTER THAN A REGIME THAT

53
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:33,256
CONTINUES TO FOCUS --

54
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:34,490
>> Martha: IN WHAT WAY WOULD

55
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,259
WE ATE THAT OR HELP THAT OR

56
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:36,859
ENCOURAGE THAT?

57
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,227
WHAT WOULD WE DO?

58
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:40,430
>> IT WOULD ALL BEGIN BY

59
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,097
WITHDRAWING FROM THE IRAN

60
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:42,165
NUCLEAR DEAL AND MAKING IT CLEAR

61
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,234
THAT WE ARE NO LONGER GOING TO

62
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:50,206
ABIDE AN AGREEMENT THAT THE

63
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:52,742
FOCUS WAS ULTIMATELY TO DELAY

64
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:56,245
IRAN FROM OBTAINING A NUCLEAR

65
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,680
WEAPON FOR A PERIOD OF TEN

66
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,414
YEARS.

67
00:01:58,414 --> 00:02:00,216
THE REALITY IS THE UNDERLYING

68
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:02,084
PROMISE WAS THAT IRAN WOULD

69
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:05,254
ABANDON THEIR SUPPORT OF

70
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:06,255
TERRORISM, THEIR MALIGN

71
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:07,056
ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE REGION

72
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:09,258
WITH GROUPS LIKE HEZBOLLAH,

73
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:10,226
HAMAS, DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES

74
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:11,661
IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA AND YEMEN,

75
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:14,564
AND THAT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE

76
00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:14,997
HAS HAPPENED.

77
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:18,634
IRAN IS DOING MORE TODAY IN THE

78
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:20,036
REGION TO SUPPORT TERRORISM AND

79
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:22,138
TO SUPPORT VIOLENCE THAN THEY

80
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:23,906
DID BEFORE THE JCPOA WAS SIGNED.

81
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:26,209
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE IT

82
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:26,909
CLEAR THAT WE ARE OUT OF THE

83
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,047
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND WE ARE

84
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:31,814
CALLING ON OUR ALLIES ACROSS

85
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:35,218
EUROPE TO JOIN WITH US IN A

86
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:36,986
NEGOTIATION OVER A NEW AGREEMENT

87
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:38,521
THAT WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

88
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:42,625
PERMANENTLY BANNING NUCLEAR

89
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,660
WEAPONS THAT DEALS WITH IRAN'S

90
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,862
INFLUENCE IN PLACES LIKE YEMEN

91
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:46,429
AND OF COURSE SYRIA.

92
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:48,030
DEALS WITH BALLISTIC MISSILES

93
00:02:48,030 --> 00:00:00,000
AND ULTIMATELY WILL PUT
