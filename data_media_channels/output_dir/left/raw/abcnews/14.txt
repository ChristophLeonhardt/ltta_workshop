DEEPEST SECURITY COOPERATION OF 

16

17
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,333
WHETHER IT IS OUR PILOTS 

18
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,401

ENGAGE RUSSIA FROM A POSITION OF

49
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,864
STRENGTH AND UNITY AND THAT WE 

50
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:43,469
SHOULD CONTINUE TO DETER OUR 

51
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:46,839
EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE OUR 

52
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:47,106

TRADE AGREEMENT.

60
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:02,521
THE AGREEMENT REACHED LAST WEEK 

61
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,824
PROVIDES THE PLATFORM FOR DONALD

62
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,892

63
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:08,160

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,928
OUR ECONOMIES.

65
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,997
IT BUILDS ON THE UK'S 

66
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:16,436
INDEPENDENT TRADE POLICY, 

67
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,370

ALL OF THIS WILL FURTHER ENHANCE

73
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,812

TO COME.

77
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,321
THE UK/U.S. RELATIONSHIP IS ALSO

78
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,522
DEFINED BY THE ROLE WE PLAY ON 

79
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:37,657
THE WORLD STAGE.

80
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,492
DOING THIS MEANS MAKING TOUGH 

81
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,593
CALLS AND SOMETIMES BEING 

82
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,627
PREPARED TO SAY THINGS OTHERS 

83
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:42,595
MIGHT RATHER NOT HEAR.

84
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,431
FROM THE OUTSET PRESIDENT TRUMP

MANY WE AGREE.

88
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,037
FOR EXAMPLE, THE NEED TO DEAL 

89
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,640
WITH THE LONGSTANDING NUCLEAR 

90
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,374
THREAT OF DPRK WHERE THE 

91
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:58,544
AGREEMENT IN SINGAPORE HAS SET 

92
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:02,715
IN TRADE THE PROSPECT OF 

93
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,583
DENUCLEARIZATION OR THE NEED TO 

94
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,387
ADDRESS THE DESTABLE STABILIZING

95
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:12,091
THE INFLUENCE OF IRAN IN THE 

96
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,995
MIDDLE EAST IN YEMEN.

97
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,364
OR THE NEED FOR NATO ALLIES TO 

98
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,600
DECREASE SPENDING OR CAPABILITY 

99
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,437
ON WHICH WE SAW INCREASES AT THE

100
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:24,670
SUMMIT.

101
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,806
THIS WEEK I ANNOUNCED A FURTHER

UPLIFT OF 440 UK TROOPS, A 

103

COMMITMENT TO A MISSION THAT 

104
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:31,977
BEGAN AS NATO'S ONLY USE OF 

105
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:34,280
ARTICLE FIVE ACTING IN SUPPORT 

106
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,281

00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,515
FINALLY LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT 

108
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,352
THE WIDER TRANSATLANTIC 

109
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:39,685
RELATIONSHIP.

110
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,554
IT IS ALL OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY 

111
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,857
TO ENSURE THE TRANSATLANTIC UNIT

112
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,458
ENDURES FOR WHICH HAS BEEN 

113
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,094
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PROTECTION 

114
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,161
AND PROJECTION OF OUR INTERESTS 

115
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,531
AND VALUES FOR GENERATIONS.

116
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,467
WITH U.S. LEADERSHIP AT ITS 

117
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,835
FOUNDATION, ITS BEATING HEART 

118
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,736
REMAINS OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES 

119
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,871
AND OUR COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE, 

120
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,039
THOSE VALUES ARE SOMETHING THAT 

121
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,108
WE IN THE UK WILL ALWAYS CHERISH

122
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,244
AS I KNOW THE U.S. WILL TOO.

123
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,578
IT IS THE STRENGTH OF THESE 

124
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,214
VALUES AND THE COMMON INTERESTS 

125
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,915
THEY CREATE THAT WE SEE ACROSS 

126
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,720
THE BREADTH OF OUR SOCIETY IN 

127
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,887
NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE AND 

128
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,654
THAT IS WHY I'M CONFIDENT THAT 

129
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:19,125
THIS TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE WILL

130
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,926

00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,045
SOVEREIGNTY AND THE TRUE RULE OF

177
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,282
LAW WERE OUR SHARED GIFT TO THE 

178
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:49,482

FOR A TOUR OF THE WINSTON 

189
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,209
CHURCHHILL EXHIBIT.

190
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,744
IT WAS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL.

191
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:19,879
IT WAS FROM RIGHT HERE THAT 

192
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,014
PRIME MINISTER CHURCHHILL PHONED

193
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,250
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AFTER PEARL 

194
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,550
HARBOR.

195
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,018
IN THAT HORRIFIC WAR AMERICAN 

196
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,520
AND BRITISH SERVICE MEMBERS 

197
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,121
BRAVELY SHED THEIR BLOOD 

198
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,491
ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER IN DEFENSE

199
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,293
OF HOME AND IN DEFENSE OF 

200
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:34,727
FREEDOM.

201
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:39,431
AND TOGETHER WE ACHIEVED A 

202
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,900
REALLY SPECIAL MAGNIFICENT 

203
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,203
VICTORY AND IT WAS TOTAL 

204
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:44,436
VICTORY.

205
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:45,337
PRIME MINISTER MAY AND I HAVE 

206
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,807
JUST COME FROM A VERY PRODUCTIVE

207
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,476
NATO SUMMIT THAT WAS TRULY A 

208
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,211
PRODUCTIVE SUMMIT WHERE MY TOP 

209
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,612
PRIORITY WAS GETTING OTHER NATO 

210
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:56,815
MEMBERS TO PAY THEIR FULL AND 

211
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:57,816
FAIR SHARE AND THE PRIME 

212
00:06:57,816 --> 00:06:59,718
MINISTER WAS RIGHT THERE WITH 

213
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:00,186
ME.

214
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,322
I WANT TO THANK YOU, PRIME 

215
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,791
MINISTER, FOR THE UNITED 

216
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,692
KINGDOM'S CONTRIBUTION TO OUR 

217
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,460
COMMON DEFENSE.

218
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,095
THE UK IS ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF 

219
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,865
NATIONS, FIVE OUT OF 29, NOT 

220
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,999
GOOD, BUT IT'S GOING TO GET 

221
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,668
BETTER REALLY FAST, IN ADDITION 

222
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:19,739
TO THE UNITED STATES MEETING THE

223
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,908
2% GDP MINIMUM DEFENSE SPENDING 

224
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:22,208
COMMITMENT.

225
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,943
DURING THE SUMMIT I MADE CLEAR 

226
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:28,814
ALL NATO ALLIES MUST HONOR THEIR

227
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:29,448
OBLIGATIONS AND I'M PLEASED TO 

228
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,182
REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED 

229
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,283
SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENTS FROM 

230
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,952
MEMBERS TO INCREASE THEIR 

231
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,054
DEFENSE SPENDING AND TO DO SO IN

232
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,957
A MUCH MORE TIMELY MANNER.

233
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,660
IN OUR MEETINGS TODAY, THE PRIME

234
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,128
MINISTER AND I DISCUSSED A RANGE

235
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,631
OF SHARED PRIORITIES INCLUDING 

236
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,201
STOPPING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION.

237
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:50,236
I THANKED PRIME MINISTER MAY FOR

238
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,138
HER PARTNERSHIP IN OUR PURSUIT 

239
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,207
OF A NUCLEAR FREE NORTH KOREA.

240
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,409
IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS HELP.

241
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,344
THE PRIME MINISTER AND I ALSO 

242
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,111
DISCUSSED IRAN.

243
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,746
WE BOTH AGREE THAT IRAN MUST 

244
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,049
NEVER POSSESS A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

245
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:07,320
AND THAT I MUST HALT AND WE MUST

246
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,988
DO IT AND I'M GOING TO DO IT AND

247
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,289
SHE'S GOING TO DO IT AND WE'RE 

248
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,360
ALL GOING TO DO IT TOGETHER.

249
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,896
WE HAVE TO STOP TERRORISTS.

250
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,263
WE HAVE TO STOP TERRORISM AND WE

251
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,698
HAVE TO GET CERTAIN COUNTRIES 

252
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:22,768
AND THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY, I 

253
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,202
BELIEVE.

254
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,136
THE FUNDING OF TERRORISM HAS TO 

255
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,238
STOP AND IT HAS TO STOP NOW.

256
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,607
I ENCOURAGE THE PRIME MINISTER 

257
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,676
TO SUSTAIN PRESSURE ON THE 

258
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,945
REGIME AND SHE NEEDED ABSOLUTELY

259
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,448
NO ENCOURAGEMENT BECAUSE SHE, IN

260
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,316
FACT, ALSO ENCOURAGES ME AND 

261
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,619
WE'RE DOING THAT AND WE'RE DOING

262
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:39,952
THAT TOGETHER.

263
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,687
VERY CLOSELY COORDINATED.

264
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,355
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE 

265
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:48,560
UNITED STATES ARE ALSO 

266
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,395
STRENGTHENING COOPERATION 

267
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,063
BETWEEN OUR ARMED FORCES WHO 

268
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,931
SERVED TOGETHER IN BATTLEFIELDS 

269
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:54,333
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

270
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,601
TODAY WE VIEWED SEVERAL U.S./UK 

271
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,471
SPECIAL FORCES DEMONSTRATION.

272
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,874
WE SAW SOME DEMONSTRATIONS TODAY

273
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,474
FRANKLY THAT WERE INCREDIBLE.

274
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:07,113
THE TALENT OF THESE YOUNG, 

275
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,615
BRAVE, STRONG PEOPLE.

276
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,217
WE SAW IT AT THE ROYAL MILITARY 

277
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:12,451
ACADEMY.

278
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,986
SEAMLESS COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR

279
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,189
MILITARIES IS REALLY JUST VITAL 

280
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,658
TO ADDRESSING SHARED SECURITY 

281
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:20,993
THREATS.

282
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,229
WE HAVE THREATS FAR DIFFERENT 

283
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,998
THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE.

284
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:26,899
THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN OUT THERE, 

285
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,836
BUT THESE ARE DIFFERENT AND 

286
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,071
THEY'RE SE VVERE AND WE WILL 

287
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,740
HANDLE THEM WELL.

288
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,841
WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF 

289
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,309
BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION 

290
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:37,677
CONTROL.

291
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:41,347
IN ORDER TO PREVENT FOREIGN ACTS

292
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,648
OF TERRORISM, WE MUST PREVENT 

293
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,450
TERRORISTS FROM GAINING 

294
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,885
ADMISSION IN THE FIRST PLACE.

295
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:50,522
BORDER SECURITY IS A NATIONAL 

296
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,391
SECURITY PROBLEM.

297
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,325
IN THE UNITED STATES WE ARE 

298
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:55,427
WORKING VERY HARD TO GET THE 

299
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,163
DEMOCRATS TO GIVE US A COUPLE OF

300
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,665
VOTES SO WE CAN PASS MEANINGFUL 

301
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,600
AND POWERFUL BORDER SECURITY.

302
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,069
I ALSO WANT TO THANK PRIME 

303
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,705
MINISTER MAY FOR PURSUING FAIR 

304
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:09,341
AND RESIP PRO CAL TRADE WITH THE

305
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:09,809
UNITED STATES.

306
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,112
ONCE THE BREXIT PROCESS IS 

307
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,313
CONCLUDED AND PERHAPS THE UK HAS

308
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,482
LEFT THE EU, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 

309
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,616
THEY'RE GOING TO DO, BUT 

310
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,719
WHATEVER YOU DO IS OKAY WITH ME.

311
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,186
THAT'S YOUR DECISION.

312
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:22,121
WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS 

313
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:22,988
OKAY WITH US.

314
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:24,823
JUST MAKE SURE WE CAN TRADE 

315
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:25,257
TOGETHER.

316
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,224
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

317
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,727
THE UNITED STATES LOOKS FORWARD 

318
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,461
TO FINALIZING A GREAT BILATERAL 

319
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,997
TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED 

320
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:32,598
KINGDOM.

321
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:33,733
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE 

322
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,568
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR TWO 

323
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,902
COUNTRIES AND WE WILL SEIZE IT 

324
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:37,236
FULLY.

325
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,670
WE SUPPORT THE DECISION OF THE 

326
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,475
BRITISH PEOPLE TO REALIZE FULL 

327
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,375
SELF-GOVERNMENT AND WE WILL SEE 

328
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,710
HOW THAT GOES.

329
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,512
VERY COMPLICATED NEGOTIATION AND

330
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,316
NOT AN EASY NEGOTIATION.

331
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,119
THAT'S FOR SURE.

332
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,088
A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT UNITED 

333
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,791
KINGDOM IS A BLESSING ON THE 

334
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:58,991
WORLD.

335
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,125
PRIME MINISTER MAY, I WANT TO 

336
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,694
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE HONOR OF

337
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,094
VISITING THE UNITED KINGDOM.

338
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:04,396
A SPECIAL PLACE.

339
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,365
MY MOTHER WAS BORN HERE, SO IT 

340
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,566
MEANS SOMETHING MAYBE JUST A 

341
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,101
LITTLE BIT EXTRA, MAYBE EVEN A 

342
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,470
LOT EXTRA, AND WE HAD AN 

343
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,371
WONDERFUL VISIT.

344
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,639
LAST NIGHT I THINK I GOT TO KNOW

345
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,373
THE PRIME MINISTER BETTER THAN 

346
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,174
AT ANY TIME.

347
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,842
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER 

348
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:23,616
OVER A YEAR AND A HALF, BUT LAST

349
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,450
NIGHT I WAS REALLY EMBARRASSED 

350
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,618
FOR THE REST OF THE TABLE.

351
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,819
WE TALKED ABOUT LOTS OF 

352
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,187
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

353
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,388
TO THOSE PROBLEMS AND IT WAS A 

354
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,222
GREAT EVENING.

355
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,024
AS WE STAND TOGETHER THIS 

356
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,292
AFTERNOON, WE CONTINUE A LONG 

357
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,928
TRADITION OF FRIENDSHIP, 

358
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:36,729
COLLABORATION AND AFFECTION 

359
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,097
BETWEEN OURSELVES AND ALSO 

360
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,666
BETWEEN OUR PEOPLE.

361
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,700
THE ENDURING RELATIONSHIP 

362
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,936
BETWEEN OUR NATIONS HAS NEVER 

363
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,705
BEEN STRONGER THAN IT IS NOW.

364
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,140
SO MADAME PRIME MINISTER, THANK 

365
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,408
YOU VERY MUCH.

366
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:54,213
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR.

367
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,248
>> THANK YOU.

368
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,150
NOW WE WILL -- WE'RE GOING TO 

369
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,418
TAKE FOUR QUESTIONINGS EACH.

370
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,788
I'LL START OFF WITH LAURA.

371
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,489
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PRIME 

372
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:07,292
MINISTER AND MR. PRESIDENT.

373
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,295
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SEEM RATHER 

374
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,529
TO HAVE CHANGED YOUR TUNE FROM 

375
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,231
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK 

376
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,300
WHEN YOU SAID THAT ON THE 

377
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,400
CURRENT BREXIT PLAN THAT WOULD 

378
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,169
PROBABLY KILL THE POSSIBILITY OF

379
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,938
A TRADE DEAL WITH THE UK.

380
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,305
OUR COUNTRIES ARE MEANT TO HAVE 

381
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:21,807
A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, YET YOU 

382
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:25,210
PUBLICLY CRITICIZED THE PRIME 

383
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,946
MINISTER POLICY AND HER 

384
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,846
PERSONALLY FOR NOT LISTENING TO 

385
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:28,581
YOU THIS WEEK.

386
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,249
IS THAT REALLY THE BEHAVIOR OF A

387
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,283
FRIEND AND AND PRIME MINISTER, 

388
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,684
ISN'T THE PROBLEM FOR YOU THAT 

389
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,152
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MR. 

390
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:36,188
TRUMP HAS SAID ABOUT YOUR BREXIT

391
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,189
PLAN ARE RIGHT?

392
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,424
IT WILL LIMIT THE POSSIBILITIES 

393
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,692
OF DOING TRADE DEALS EASILY IN 

394
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:41,359
THE FUTURE.

395
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,995
CAN YOU ALSO TELL US HOW IT FELT

396
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,096
FOR HIM TO CRITICIZE YOU IN THE 

397
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,732
WAY HE DID IN THAT INTERVIEW?

398
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,801
>> MAYBE I'LL GO FIRST BECAUSE I

399
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,368
DIDN'T CRITICIZE THE PRIME 

400
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:49,635
MINISTER.

401
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,970
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE 

402
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,805
PRIME MINISTER.

403
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,773
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WAS A STORY

404
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,709
THAT WAS DONE WHICH WAS, YOU 

405
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:58,444
KNOW, GENERALLY FINE, BUT IT 

406
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,945
DIDN'T PUT IN WHAT I SAID ABOUT 

407
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,779
THE PRIME MINISTER.

408
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,415
AND I SAID TREMENDOUS THINGS.

409
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,251
FORTUNATELY WE TEND TO RECORD 

410
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,753
STORIES NOW, SO WE HAVE IT FOR 

411
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,354
YOUR ENJOYMENT IF YOU'D LIKE IT,

412
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:13,926
BUT WE RECORD WHEN WE DEAL WITH 

413
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:14,460
REPORTERS.

414
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,360
IT'S CALLED FAKE NEWS AND WE 

415
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,430
SOLVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE

416
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,064
GOOD OLD RECORDING INSTRUMENT.

417
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,765
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE PRIME 

418
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,034
MINISTER AS I REALLY JUST SAID, 

419
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,201
SHE'S GOING TO MAKE A DECISION 

420
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,704
AS TO WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO.

421
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,273
THE ONLY THING I ASK OF THERESA 

422
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,476
IS THAT WE MAKE SURE WE CAN 

423
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,544
TRADE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY 

424
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:33,211
RESTRICTIONS, BECAUSE WE WANT TO

425
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,213
TRADE WITH THE UK AND THE UK 

426
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:38,851
WANTS TO TRADE WITH US.

427
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,521
WE'RE BY FAR THEIR BIGGEST 

428
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,021
TRA

429
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,223
TRADING PARTNER AND WE HAVE A 

430
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:47,559
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO 

431
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,062
DOUBLE, TRIPLE, THAT.

432
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,565
SO IF THEY'RE GOING A SLIGHTLY 

433
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,168
DIFFERENT ROUTE AND THEY WANT 

434
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:56,501
INDEPENDENCE.

435
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,035
IT'S JUST THE DEFINITION.

436
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,537
IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO A CERTAIN

437
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,407
ROUTE, I JUST SAID I HOPE YOU'RE

438
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,041
GOING TO BE ABLE TO TRADE WITH 

439
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:02,474
THE UNITED STATES.

440
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,842
I READ REPORTS WHERE THAT WON'T 

441
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,277
BE POSSIBLE, BUT I BELIEVE AFTER

442
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,679
SPEAKING WITH THE PRIME 

443
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,047
MINISTER'S PEOPLE AND 

444
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,114
REPRESENTATIVES AND TRADE 

445
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,650
EXPERTS IT WILL ABSOLUTELY BE 

446
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:11,917
POSITIVE.

447
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:15,654
SO BASED ON THAT, AND BASED ON 

448
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,589
JUST TRADE IN GENERAL, AND OUR 

449
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:18,791
OTHER RELATIONSHIP WHICH WILL BE

450
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,125
FINE, BUT THE TRADE IS A LITTLE 

451
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:20,826
BIT TRICKY.

452
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,194
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRADE AND 

453
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,061
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRADE 

454
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,364
AND I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO 

455
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:25,564
THAT.

456
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:25,764
OKAY?

457
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,299
AND I THINK SHE'S DOING A 

458
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,333
TERRIFIC JOB, BY THE WAY. 

459
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,835
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

460
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,503
JUST TO CONFIRM WHAT THE 

461
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,871
PRESIDENT HAS SAID, LAURA, THERE

462
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,206
WILL BE NO LIMIT TO THE 

463
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,707
POSSIBILITY OF US DOING TRADE 

464
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:36,842
DEALS AROUND THE REST OF THE 

465
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:41,714
WORLD ONCE WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN

466
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,281
UNION ON THE BASIS OF THE 

467
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:47,052
AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE HERE.

468
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,120
JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT IS AN 

469
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,322
AGREEMENT THAT DELIVERS ON THE 

470
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,723
BREXIT VOTE THAT WE HAD IN 2016 

471
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,625
HERE IN THE UK THAT DELIVERS 

472
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,026
WHAT I BELIEVE IS AT THE 

473
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:56,295
FOREFRONT OF THE PEOPLE'S MINDS 

474
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,929
WHEN THEY WERE VOTING TO LEAVE 

475
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,698
THE EUROPE UNION.

476
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,066
SO AT THE END OF THESE 

477
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,733
NEGOTIATIONS, WE WILL ENSURE 

478
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,135
THAT FREE MOVEMENT WILL COME TO 

479
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:03,902
AN END.

480
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,704
THE JURISDICTION OF THE EUROPION

481
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,206
COURT OF JUSTICE HERE IN THE UK 

482
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,841
WILL COME TO AN END.

483
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,877
THE SENDING OF VAST SUMS OF 

484
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,046
MONEY WILL COME TO AN END.

485
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,849
WE WILL COME OUT OF THE POLICY 

486
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:18,717
AND WE WILL ENSURE BY NOT BEING 

487
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,452
IN THE CUSTOMS UNION THAT WE ARE

488
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,520
ABLE TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT 

489
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,921
TRADE POLICY AND DO THOSE TRADE 

490
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,858
DEALS AROUND THE WORLD.

491
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,159
AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE 

492
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:27,959
PRESIDENT, THE UNITED STATES IS 

493
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:28,727
KEEN FOR US.

494
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,396
WE'RE KEEN TO WORK WITH THEM.

495
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:34,099
WE WILL DO A TRADE DEAL WITH 

496
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,699
ZMEM

497
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,735
THEM AND WITH OTHERS AROUND THE 

498
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,169
REST OF THE WORLD. 

499
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:43,675
>> JONATHAN, GO AHEAD.

500
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:44,976
>>> MR. PRESIDENT, TWO 

501
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:45,677
QUESTIONS, IF I MAY.

502
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:48,213
THE FIRST ONE, NOW YOUR BRITISH 

503
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,548
TRIP IS COMING TO A CLOSE.

504
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,183
COULD YOU TELL US THE THREE OR 

505
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,317
FOUR THINGS YOU HOPED TO ACHIEVE

506
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:54,719
IN YOUR MEETING WITH VLADIMIR 

507
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,220
PUTIN.

508
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,522
AND THE SECOND QUESTION, WHAT'S 

509
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,924
THE BENEFIT TO AMERICA OF HAVING

510
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,525
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN 

511
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,227
TROOPS STATIONED IN EUROPE?

512
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,328
THANK YOU.

513
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:06,465
>> SO I'LL BE MEETING WITH 

514
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,867
PRESIDENT PUTIN ON MONDAY.

515
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,369
WE GO INTO THE MEETING WITH A 

516
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:12,504
TREMENDOUS MEETING THAT WE HAD 

517
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,906
WITH NATO.

518
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,975
MOST OF YOU HAVE REPORTED IT 

519
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:17,242
CORRECTLY.

520
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,877
IT WAS CERTAINLY TESTY AT THE 

521
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:19,578
BEGINNING, BUT AT THE END 

522
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,046
EVERYBODY CAME TOGETHER AND THEY

523
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,181
AGREED TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO

524
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,583
AND ACTUALLY WHAT THEY'VE 

525
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,952
COMMITTED TO DO, WHICH YOU FULLY

526
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:27,453
ADHERE TO.

527
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,954
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM, BUT 

528
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,756
SOME PEOPLE DID.

529
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,590
WE LEFT THAT MEETING I THINK 

530
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,094
PROBABLY MORE UNIFIED AND 

531
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,362
WEALTHIER AS A GROUP THAN EVER 

532
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:37,696
BEFORE.

533
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,065
SO WE GO IN STRONG.

534
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,800
WE'LL BE TALKING TO PRESIDENT 

535
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,636
PUTIN ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS.

536
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,304
UKRAINE.

537
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,672
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SYRIA.

538
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,407
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OTHER 

539
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,076
PARTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST.

540
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,212
I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR 

541
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:57,015
PROLIFERATION.

542
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,717
BECAUSE WE ARE MASSIVELY, YOU 

543
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,185
KNOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING, WE 

544
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,621
HAVE BEEN MODERNIZING AND FIXING

545
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,991
AND BUYING AND IT'S JUST A 

546
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,724
DEVASTATING TECHNOLOGY.

547
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:10,762
AND THEY LIKEWISE ARE DOING A 

548
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:11,296
LOT.

549
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:15,434
AND IT'S A VERY, VERY BAD 

550
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,068
POLICY.

551
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,637
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

552
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,806
BUT WE ARE MASSIVELY BIG AND 

553
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:23,308
THEY ARE VERY BIG AND I'LL BE 

554
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,675
TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR 

555
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:25,010
PROLIFERATION.

556
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,344
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT THING IF 

557
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:26,912
WE COULD DO.

558
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,012
IT'S NOT ONLY US.

559
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,214
IT'S NOT ONLY RUSSIA AND THE 

560
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:29,982
UNITED STATES.

561
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,818
IT'S OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO.

562
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,086
BUT WE'RE THE TWO LEADERS.

563
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,554
WE WOULD BE THE LEADER.

564
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,489
THEY WOULD BE SECOND I GUESS 

565
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,390
CHINA WOULD BE THIRD.

566
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,491
I THINK WE'LL ALL BE TALKING 

567
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,792
ABOUT THAT.

568
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:44,062
TO ME, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A 

569
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,496
TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT IF WE 

570
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,200
COULD DO SOMETHING ON NUCLEAR 

571
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,533
PROLIFERATION.

572
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,901
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OTHER 

573
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:50,168
THINGS.

574
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,903
I KNOW YOU'LL ASK WILL WE BE 

575
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,539
TALKING ABOUT MEDDLING AND I 

576
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,373
WILL ABSOLUTELY BRING THAT UP.

577
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:58,677
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE ANY, 

578
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,812
GEE, I DID IT, I DID IT, YOU GOT

579
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:00,978
ME.

580
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:03,649
THERE WON'T BE A PERRY MASON 

581
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,416
HERE I DON'T THINK.

582
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,352
I NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

583
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,254
BUT I WILL ABSOLUTELY FIRMLY ASK

584
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,589
THE QUESTION AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL

585
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,791
HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP 

586
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,291
WITH RUSSIA.

587
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,227
THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD AGREE 

588
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:16,562
.

589
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,763
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH

590
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,763
RUSSIA AND CHINA AND OTHER 

591
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,299
COUNTRIES IS A GOOD THING, NOT A

592
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,433
BAD THING.

593
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:27,272
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HAPPEN.

594
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,107
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

595
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,875
>> THE TROOPS WHERE?

596
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,079
WELL, LOOK, THERE IS A BENEFIT.

597
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,614
THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFIT 

598
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:39,117
AND A MILITARY BENEFIT.

599
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,887
THERE'S ALSO A BENEFIT NOT TO DO

600
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:42,187
IT.

601
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,223
I WAS PREPARED TO DO SOMETHING 

602
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:46,424
SOMEWHAT HARSH BUT PEOPLE CAME 

603
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:48,493
TOGETHER IN THE END.

604
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:53,765
IT WASN'T A THREAT.

605
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:54,265
TFG

606
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,400
IT WAS AN UNFAIR SITUATION.

607
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,602
WE WERE PAYING 90% OF THE COST 

608
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:00,606
OF NATO AND NATO IS REALLY THERE

609
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,308
FOR EUROPE MUCH MORE SO THAN US.

610
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,310
IT HELPS EUROPE NO MATTER WHAT 

611
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,344
OUR MILITARY PEOPLE OR YOUR 

612
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,812
MILITARY SAY, IT HELPS EUROPE 

613
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,081
MORE THAN IT HELPS US.

614
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:13,318
THAT BEING SAID, IT IS A GREAT 

615
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:13,551
UNIFIER.

616
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:18,823
WE HAVE 29 COUNTRIES AND THERE 

617
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:21,093
WAS A LOT OF LOVE IN THAT ROOM.

618
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,661
WHEN YOU SAY 10,000 TROOPS, WE 

619
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:26,765
HAVE A LOT MORE THAN 10,000 

620
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:26,998
TROOPS. 

621
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:27,999
>> TENS OF. 

622
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:33,272
>> OH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID 10,000

623
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,707
IN GERMANY WE HAVE 52,000 

624
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:35,941
TROOPS.

625
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,476
THAT BEING SAID, WE'RE HELPING 

626
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,710
EUROPE, THEY'RE HELPING US, 

627
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,512
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER AND I'M FINE 

628
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:40,879
WITH IT. 

629
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,414
>> AND BY THE WAY VERY 

630
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,715
IMPORTANTLY THEY'RE NOW PAYING 

631
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,118
THEIR WAY IN A MUCH MORE RAPID 

632
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:50,489
FASHION.

633
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,091
>> FRANCIS.

634
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,259
>> PRIME MINISTER, I WONDER 

635
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,260
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THE 

636
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,927
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

637
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:58,430
THAT IMMIGRATION HAS DAMAGED THE

638
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,565
CULTURAL FABRIC OF EUROPE.

639
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,267
AND PRESIDENT, PERHAPS YOU COULD

640
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,268
ELABORATE ON THAT.

641
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,005
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

642
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,873
>> I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY BAD 

643
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,043
FOR EUROPE.

644
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,477
I THINK EUROPE IS A PLACE I KNOW

645
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,079
VERY WELL AND I THINK THAT WHAT 

646
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,849
HAS HAPPENED IS VERY TOUGH.

647
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,084
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION.

648
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,086
YOU SEE THE SAME TERROR ATTACKS 

649
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,054
THAT I DO.

650
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,056
WE SEE THEM A LOT.

651
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,090
WE JUST LEFT SOME INCREDIBLE 

652
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,560
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN AT SANDHURST

653
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,329
AND THEY WERE SHOWING US CELLS 

654
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,231
AND SHOWING US THINGS THAT 

655
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,634
FRANKLY 20 YEARS AGO NOBODY EVEN

656
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,735
THOUGHT ABOUT, PROBABLY A LOT 

657
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,969
MORE RECENTLY THAN THAT.

658
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:41,406
I JUST THINK IT'S CHANGING THE 

659
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:41,673
CULTURE.

660
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,441
I THINK IT'S A VERY NEGATIVE 

661
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,543
THING FOR EUROPE.

662
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,877
I THINK IT'S VERY NEGATIVE.

663
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,612
I THINK HAVING GERMANY AND I 

664
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:50,315
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH 

665
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,717
ANGELA MERKEL.

666
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,453
GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH GERMANY.

667
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,988
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH HER 

668
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:57,221
GERMANY.

669
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,824
I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH HER OTHER

670
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,425
PARTS OF EUROPE.

671
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,994
AND I KNOW IT'S POLITICALLY NOT 

672
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,663
NECESSARILY CORRECT TO SAY THAT,

673
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,332
BUT I'LL SAY IT AND I'LL SAY IT 

674
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:07,532
LOUD.

675
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,901
AND I THINK THEY BETTER WATCH 

676
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,470
THEMSELVES BECAUSE YOU ARE 

677
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:11,937
CHANGING CULTURE.

678
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,605
YOU ARE CHANGING A LOT OF 

679
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,239
THINGS.

680
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:14,906
YOU'RE CHANGING SECURITY.

681
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,107
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

682
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:17,376
YOU TAKE A LOOK.

683
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,476
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO 

684
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:19,644
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT NEVER 

685
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,314
HAD DIFFICULTY, NEVER HAD 

686
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:22,581
PROBLEMS.

687
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,182
IT'S A VERY SAD SITUATION.

688
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,583
IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE.

689
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,185
BUT I DO NOT THINK IT'S GOOD FOR

690
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,452
EUROPE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S 

691
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,455
GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY.

692
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,257
WE'RE AS YOU KNOW FAR SUPERIOR 

693
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,658
TO ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED 

694
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:37,429
BEFORE, BUT WE HAVE VERY BAD 

695
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,064
IMMIGRATION LAWS AND WE'RE -- I 

696
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,131
MEAN, WE'RE DOING INCREDIBLY 

697
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:43,435
WELL CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT 

698
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,437
WE VUIRTUALLY DON'T HAVE 

699
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,170
IMMIGRATION LAWS.

700
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,839
WE HAVE LAWS SO BAD I DON'T EVEN

701
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,040
CALL THEM LAWS.

702
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,909
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU WALK ACROSS 

703
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,044
THE BORDER AND YOU PUT 1 FOOT ON

704
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,646
THE LAND AND NOW YOU'RE TIED UP 

705
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,883
IN A LAWSUIT FOR FIVE YEARS.

706
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,484
IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING ANYONE'S

707
00:21:59,484 --> 00:21:59,884
EVER SEEN.

708
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:01,019
I WOULD JUST MAKE THAT 

709
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,087
RECOMMENDATION TO EUROPE.

710
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,422
I'VE MADE IT VERY LOUD AND 

711
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:03,622
CLEAR.

712
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,458
I MADE IT YESTERDAY.

713
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,359
29 COUNTRIES TOTAL.

714
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,061
AND THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL.

715
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,031
>> THE UK HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF

716
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,434
WELCOMING PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING

717
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,535
PERSECUTION TO OUR COUNTRY.

718
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,669
WE HAVE A PROUD HISTORY OF 

719
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,703
WELCOMING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 

720
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:19,737
COME TO OUR COUNTRY TO 

721
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:21,039
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY AND 

722
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,707
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY.

723
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:24,542
AND OVER THE YEARS, OVERALL 

724
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:25,543
IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN GOOD FOR 

725
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:26,545
THE UK.

726
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,046
IT'S BROUGHT PEOPLE WITH 

727
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,114
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, DIFFERENT

728
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,516
OUTLOOKS HERE TO THE UK.

729
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,285
AND HAS -- WE HAVE SEEN THEM 

730
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:35,320
CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SOCIETY AND 

731
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:35,987
OUR ECONOMY.

732
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,154
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE 

733
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:38,857
HAVE CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS.

734
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,690
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE 

735
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,526
HAVE A SET OF RULES THAT ENABLES

736
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,595
US TO DETERMINE WHO COMES IN TO 

737
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,497
OUR COUNTRY AND OF COURSE THAT 

738
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,731
IS WHAT AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE 

739
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,133
BEEN DOING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

740
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,201
AND WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO 

741
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,937
DO IN THE FUTURE.

742
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:57,509
>> MR. PRESIDENT.

743
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,410
>> YOU SPENT THE WEEK TAKING ON 

744
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,145
NATO ALLIES, CRITICIZING PRIME 

745
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:04,483
MINISTER MAY ON HER OWN SOIL AND

746
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,518
I I WONDER ARE YOU GIVING 

747
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,352
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN

748
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,954
THE UPPER HAND HEADING INTO YOUR

749
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,421
TALKS GIVEN THAT YOU ARE 

750
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,656
CHALLENGING THESE ALLIANCES THAT

751
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,492
HE SEEKS TO BREAK UP AND 

752
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:13,892
DESTROY?

753
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,061
>> THAT'S SUCH DISHONEST 

754
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,695
REPORTING, BECAUSE OF COURSE IT 

755
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,097
HAPPENS TO BE NBC WHICH IS 

756
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,066
POSSIBLY WORSE THAN CNN, 

757
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:22,333
POSSIBLY.

758
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:22,600
POSSIBLY.

759
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,302
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING.

760
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,072
WE HAVE LEFT NATO WITH MORE 

761
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,741
MONEY, WITH MORE UNITY, WITH 

762
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,242
MORE SPIRIT THAN NATO PROBABLY 

763
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,912
HAS EVER HAD.

764
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,250
WE HAVE A STRONG AND POWERFUL 

765
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:38,450
NATO.

766
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,951
WHEN I BECAME PRESIDENT, WE 

767
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:40,184
DIDN'T.

768
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,118
WE HAD PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T 

769
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:41,987
PAYING THEIR BILLS.

770
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,355
WE HAD PEOPLE THAT WERE WAY 

771
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,188
DOWN, THAT WEREN'T FOLLOWING 

772
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:45,223
THEIR COMMITMENTS.

773
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,858
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE BECOME AN

774
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,126
OIL EXPORTER WHICH WOULD NOT 

775
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,360
HAVE HAPPENED UNDER THE PAST 

776
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,264
REGIME OR A NEW REGIME IF IT 

777
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:52,631
WEREN'T US.

778
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,833
WE HAVE BUILT UP OUR MILITARY 

779
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,101
$700 BILLION AND THEN NEXT YEAR 

780
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:05,210
AS YOU KNOW $716 BILLION.

781
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,646
WHEN YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA, WHOEVER

782
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,515
IT IS IN RUSSIA ARE SAYING GEE, 

783
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,718
WE RWISH TRUMP WAS NOT THE 

784
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:13,951
VICTOR.

785
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:18,456
WE HAVE BEEN FAR TOUGHER ON 

786
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,491
RUSSIA THAN ANYBODY.

787
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,693
LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO GO DOWN 

788
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,961
100 YEARS, BUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE

789
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,163
BEEN EXTREMELY TOUGH ON RUSSIA, 

790
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,097
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT WHEN THE

791
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,065
PRIME MINISTER CALLED, WHEN THEY

792
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,967
HAD A HORRIBLE THING HAPPEN 

793
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:33,271
RIGHT HERE VERY CLOSE BY, SHE 

794
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,273
ASKED WOULD I DO SOMETHING AND 

795
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,976
I -- MAYBE I'D LET YOU TELL THE 

796
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,176
NUMBER AND IT WAS FAR GREATER 

797
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:41,780
THAN ANYBODY ELSE, INCLUDING THE

798
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,379
PRIME MINISTER.

799
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:46,451
WE EXPELLED HOW MANY PEOPLE?

800
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,052
AND GERMANY DID THREE AS AN 

801
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:48,286
EXAMPLE.

802
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,088
SO GERMANY, BIG COUNTRY, 

803
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,556
POWERFUL COUNTRY, THEY DID 

804
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:51,756
THREE.

805
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:52,690
THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T WANT TO 

806
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,625
TALK ABOUT IT.

807
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,160
SO IT REALLY IS.

808
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,227
WE HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG ON 

809
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:56,494
RUSSIA.

810
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,864
WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID, IF I 

811
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:01,633
HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN, I

812
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,834
DON'T KNOW HIM.

813
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,836
I MET HIM TWICE, MAYBE THREE 

814
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,904
TIMES, TWO AND A HALF TIMES.

815
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,606
MOST OF YOU WERE THERE WHEN WE 

816
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:07,772
DID.

817
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,242
WE MET HIM AT THE G 20.

818
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:12,777
IF WE COULD DEVELOP A 

819
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,279
RELATIONSHIP, WHICH IS GOOD FOR 

820
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,247
RUSSIA, GOOD FOR US, GOOD FOR 

821
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:18,649
EVERYBODY, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

822
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:19,417
IF I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH 

823
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,019
CHINA, YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A BIG 

824
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,455
TRADE SITUATION WITH CHINA AS AN

825
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,190
EXAMPLE WHERE WE'RE BEHIND EVERY

826
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,291
YEAR FOR MANY YEARS, $500 

827
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:27,525
BILLION.

828
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,260
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 

829
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,527
ANYMORE.

830
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,162
SO IF WE GOT ALONG WITH 

831
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,363
COUNTRIES, THAT'S A GOOD THING.

832
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,165
IF WE GOT ALONG WITH CHINA, 

833
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,533
RUSSIA, THAT'S A GOOD THING, NOT

834
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,303
A BAD THING.

835
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,637
>> I TAKE YOUR POINT ABOUT WHAT 

836
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:41,039
HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE 

837
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,806
NATO -- 

838
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,242
>> THE HEADLINE YOU SEE ISN'T 

839
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,176
THE HEADLINE.

840
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,344
YES, THERE'S FIGHTING.

841
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,513
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT UP MORE MONEY.

842
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,714
WE HAVE TO BE STRONGER.

843
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,815
WE HAVE TO BE HEADLINED.

844
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,817
THE HEADLINE HE SEES ISN'T 

845
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,651
WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING THE 

846
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:54,219
MORNING.

847
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,319
THE HEADLINE HE SEES IS WHAT 

848
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,354
HAPPENED IN THE AFTERNOON WHERE 

849
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,958
WE CAME TOGETHER AS ONE.

850
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,426
THEY'RE PUTTING UP BILLIONS OF 

851
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:01,726
DOLLARINGS.

852
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,794
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

853
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:06,497
YOU KNOW THIS IS A CONFIRMED 

854
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:08,733
NUMBER.

855
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,468
$34 BILLION MORE WAS RAISED 

856
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,837
SINCE I BECAME PRESIDENT IN 

857
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:13,037
NATO.

858
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:15,673
THAT MEANS THAT THE OTHER 28 

859
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:20,278
COUNTRIES HAVE PUT IN $34 

860
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,547
BILLION MORE INTO NATO.

861
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:23,714
DO YOU THINK PUTIN IS HAPPY 

862
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:24,349
ABOUT THAT?

863
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,316
I DON'T THINK SO.

864
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:26,451
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF FALSE 

865
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,619
REPORTING IN THIS COUNTRY.

866
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,354
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE THAT IN 

867
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,423
COUNTRY, DO YOU, PRIME MINISTER?

868
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:31,690
GO AHEAD.

869
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,324
ASK THE PRIME MINISTER.

870
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:35,860
>> THE QUESTION IS WHILE 

871
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,328
PRESIDENT TRUMP IT WILL "THE 

872
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:40,098
SUN" I THINK THE DEAL SHE IS 

873
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,666
STRIKING ON BREXIT IS NOT WHAT 

874
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,268
THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR.

875
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,035
IS HE WRONG?

876
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,237
AND I WONDER IF HE COULD GET 

877
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:49,106
YOUR REACTION TO HIM SAYING 

878
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:50,774
BORIS JOHNSON WOULD BE A GREAT 

879
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:51,141
PRIME MINISTER. 

880
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:51,842
>> THE AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE PUT 

881
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,811
ON THE TABLE, AS I SAID EARLIER 

882
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:55,613
IN RESPONSE TO LAURA'S FIRST 

883
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,814
QUESTION, THIS DOES DELIVER ON 

884
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,483
THE VOTE OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE.

885
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,650
THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTED TO 

886
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,187
LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I 

887
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,488
HEARD THE TURN OF PHRASE THE 

888
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,256
PRESIDENT USED EARLIER, BUT LET 

889
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,791
ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS.

890
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,226
HE WILL BE LEAVING THE EUROPEAN 

891
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,462
UNION AND WE ARE LEAVING ON THE 

892
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,833
29th OF MARCH, 2019.

893
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,568
AS WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION, 

894
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:18,903
WE WILL BE DELIVERING ON WHAT 

895
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,306
PEOPLE VOTED FOR, AN END TO FREE

896
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,873
MOVE PENT, AN END TO SENDING 

897
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:24,475
VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO THE 

898
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,377
EUROPEAN UNION EVERY YEAR AND AN

899
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:28,479
END TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF 

900
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,847
JUSTICE EVERY YEAR COMING OUT OF

901
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:31,783
THE COMMON FISHERY POLICY, 

902
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,551
COMING OUT OF THE COMMON 

903
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,253
ALCULTURE POLICIES AND ENSURING 

904
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,955
BY COMING OUT OF THE CUSTOMS 

905
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:39,790
UNION THAT WE CAN HAVE AN 

906
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,259
INDEPENDENT TRADE POLICY THAT 

907
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,726
ALLOWS US TO NEGOTIATE TRADE 

908
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:43,394
DEALS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND

909
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:44,162
OTHER COUNTRIES.

910
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,730
THAT'S WHAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE 

911
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,597
VOTED FOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE 

912
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:48,032
WILL BE DELIVERING.

913
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:50,067
PEEL DELIVER IT IN A WAY THAT 

914
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:51,569
PROTECTS JOBS AND LIVELIHOODS 

915
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,771
AND MEETS OUR COMMITMENT TO THE 

916
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:55,006
BORDER IN BETWEEN NORTHERN 

917
00:27:55,006 --> 00:28:00,811
IRELAND AND IRELAND.

918
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,148
AND ROBERT?

919
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,649
>> I'LL RESPOND.

920
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:06,517
THEY SAID UNRELATED.

921
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:10,754
WE HAVE THE TAPE YOU CAN GET IT 

922
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:12,157
FROM SARAH.

923
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,559
WE TAPED THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW.

924
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,927
THEY ASKED ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON 

925
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,428
AND I SAID HE WOULD BE A GREAT 

926
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:17,795
PRIME MINISTER.

927
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:18,963
HE'S BEEN SAYING VERY NICE 

928
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,565
THINGS ABOUT ME AS PRESIDENT.

929
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,001
I THINK HE THINKS I'M DOING A 

930
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:23,401
GREAT JOB.

931
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,436
I AM DOING A GREAT JOB I WILL 

932
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,205
TELL YOU IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T 

933
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:27,439
NOTICED.

934
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,405
BORIS JOHNSON WOULD BE A GREAT 

935
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:28,772
PRIME MINISTER.

936
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:34,012
I ALSO SAID THAT THIS INCREDIBLE

937
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,213
WOMAN RIGHT HERE IS DOING A 

938
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,815
FANTASTIC JOB, A GREAT JOB.

939
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,615
AND I MEAN THAT.

940
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,552
AND I MUST SAY THAT I HAVE 

941
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,754
GOTTEN TO KNOW THERESA MAY MUCH 

942
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,389
BETTER OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS 

943
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:47,592
THAN I'VE KNOWN HER OVER THE 

944
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,393
LAST YEAR AND A HALF.

945
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,229
YESTERDAY I HAD BREAKFAST, LUNCH

946
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,296
AND DINNER WITH HER AND I SAID 

947
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:55,265
WHAT ARE WE DOG TOMORROW?

948
00:28:55,265 --> 00:28:56,234
OH, YOU'RE HAVING BREAKFAST AND 

949
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,668
LUNCH WITH THERESA MAY AND I'M 

950
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,938
GOING TO SEE YOU LATER ON AGAIN.

951
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,305
I'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN TO KNOW 

952
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,373
HERBERT THAN EVER.

953
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,474
I THINK SHE'S A TERRIFIC WOMAN 

954
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,176
AND SHE'S DOING A TERRIFIC JOB.

955
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,677
THAT BREXIT IS A VERY TOUGH 

956
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:07,178
SITUATION.

957
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,880
THAT'S A TOUGH DEAL BETWEEN THE 

958
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,448
BORDERS AND THE ENTRIES INTO THE

959
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,151
COUNTRIES AND ALL OF THE THINGS.

960
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,419
SHE'S GOING TO DO THE BEST.

961
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,887
THE ONLY THING I ASK IS THAT SHE

962
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,322
WORK IT OUT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE 

963
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:19,423
VERY EVEN TRADE BECAUSE WE DO 

964
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:21,091
NOT HAVE A FAIR DEAL WITH THE 

965
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,693
EUROPEAN UNION RIGHT NOW ON 

966
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:23,428
TRADE.

967
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,095
THEY TREAT THE UNITED STATES 

968
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:26,931
HORRIBLY AND THAT'S GOING TO 

969
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,164
CHANGE.

970
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:28,299
AND IF IT DOESN'T CHANGE, 

971
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,934
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A 

972
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,102
VERY BIG PRICE AND THEY KNOW 

973
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,002
WHAT THAT PRICE IS.

974
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:34,372
THEY'RE COMING OVER ON JULY 25th

975
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,307
TO SEE ME AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN 

976
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,175
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

977
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,343
THEY HAVE BARRIERS THAT ARE 

978
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:41,045
BEYOND BELIEF, BARRIERS WHERE 

979
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,348
THEY WON'T TAKE OUR FARM 

980
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:43,681
PRODUCTS.

981
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,149
THEY WON'T TAKE MANY OF OUR 

982
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:47,018
THINGS INCLUDING OUR CARS.

983
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,220
THEY CHARGE US TARIFFS ON CARS 

984
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,688
FAR GREATER THAN WE CHARGE THEM.

985
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:51,923
YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS.

986
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:55,693
LAST YEAR, THERESA, WE LOST $151

987
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:56,628
BILLION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION.

988
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,795
SO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

989
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,899
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT ANY

990
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,467
LONGER.

991
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,034
THANK YOU.

992
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:07,038
>> MR. PRESIDENT, HOW WOULD YOU 

993
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,306
CHARACTERIZE YOUR RELATIONSHIP 

994
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,574
WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM?

995
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:12,043
MORE SPECIAL THAN ANY OTHER 

996
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:12,377
COUNTRIES?

997
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,546
BY THE WAY, ON FARM PRODUCTS, I 

998
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,348
THINK ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S 

999
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,384
DEAL, YOU WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO

1000
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,185
EXPORT MANY FARM PRODUCTS TO THE

1001
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:21,351
UK.

1002
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:23,888
WOULD THAT BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU?

1003
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,624
PRIME MINISTER, THE PRESIDENT 

1004
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,192
SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE GAVE YOU 

1005
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:31,362
ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO NEGOTIATE 

1006
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:31,596
BREXIT.

1007
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,331
THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE THAT 

1008
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:33,565
ADVICE.

1009
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:37,402
I WONDERED WHAT THAT ADVICE 

1010
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:37,902
SKWAS 

1011
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,303
AND WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS

1012
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,104
ABOUT NOT TAKING. 

1013
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,839
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE GIVE ME 

1014
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,108
ADVICE ABOUT HOW YOU TO 

1015
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,543
NEGOTIATE WITH THE EUROPEAN 

1016
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:45,743
UNION.

1017
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:49,046
MY JOB IS GETTING OUT THERE AND 

1018
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:51,182
DOING IT AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE 

1019
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:51,382
DONE.

1020
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,917
AS WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH 

1021
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,753
THESE NEGOTIATIONS, THERE BEEN 

1022
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,221
SKEPTICAL VOICES FROM YOU ABOUT 

1023
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,189
WHAT WE WOULD ACHIEVE IN 

1024
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,489
DECEMBER.

1025
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,523
WE'VE GOT THAT JOINT AGREEMENT 

1026
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:01,058
ON CITIZENS RIGHTS AND THOSE 

1027
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,260
OTHER ISSUES.

1028
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,497
WE'VE GOT THE IMPLE MEMENTATION 

1029
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,265
PERIOD IN MARCH.

1030
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:11,169
WE'VE PUT FORWARD THE TWO 

1031
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:11,436
PROPOSALS.

1032
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,971
THE TWO THAT WERE PUT FORWARD 

1033
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,005
WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE.

1034
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,540
WE SAID NO AND THAT'S WHY WE 

1035
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,709
HAVE PUT OUR OWN PROPOSAL ON THE

1036
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,142
TABLE.

1037
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,510
IN ANSWER TO ONE OF THE 

1038
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,345
QUESTIONS, IT DELIVERS ON THE 

1039
00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:22,847
BREXIT DEAL BUT ALSO ENSURES 

1040
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:23,981
THAT WE CAN HAVE SMOOTH TRADE 

1041
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:26,617
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE 

1042
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:26,985
FUTURE.

1043
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:27,951
IN TERMS OF THE UNITED STATES, 

1044
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:30,321
IN TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES,

1045
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,222
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS ON SOME 

1046
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,423
OF THE TRADE ISSUES ABOUT THE 

1047
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,557
STANDARDS WE HAVE HERE FOR 

1048
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:35,059
CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND HOW WE WANT

1049
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,894
TO DEAL WITH THOSE IN THE TRADE 

1050
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:37,094
DEAL.

1051
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:40,031
THAT WILL BE A MATTER FOR THE 

1052
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:40,365
NEGOTIATIONS.

1053
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,633
>> SO I WOULD SAY I GIVE OUR 

1054
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:44,335
RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF GRADE 

1055
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,737
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SPECIAL.

1056
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:50,174
WE START OFF WITH SPECIAL.

1057
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,442
I WOULD GIVE OUR RELATIONSHIP 

1058
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,877
WITH THE UK OKAY.

1059
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,345
NOW ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS TWO 

1060
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,380
DAYS WITH YOUR PRIME MINISTER, I

1061
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,716
WOULD SAY THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF 

1062
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:58,949
SPECIAL.

1063
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,319
AM I ALLOWED TO GO HIGHER THAN 

1064
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:01,519
THAT?

1065
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,153
I'M NOT SURE.

1066
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,588
IT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF 

1067
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:03,888
SPECIAL.

1068
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:04,922
THEY'RE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE.

1069
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,624
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL COUNTRY.

1070
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,826
AS I SAID, I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

1071
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,495
BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN 

1072
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:10,795
SCOTLAND.

1073
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:11,829
SO VERY IMPORTANT.

1074
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,564
AS FAR AS THE ADVICE, I DID GIVE

1075
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,265
HER A SUGGESTION.

1076
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,502
I WOULDN'T SAY ADVICE.

1077
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,803
I THINK SHE FOUND IT TOO BRUTAL.

1078
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:21,406
I CAN SEE THAT.

1079
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,707
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

1080
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,441
WHAT I SAID.

1081
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,078
I DID GIVE HER A CERTAIN AMOUNT 

1082
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,913
OF -- I GAVE HER A SUGGESTION, 

1083
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,381
NOT ADVICE.

1084
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,883
I WOULD GIVE HER A SUGGESTION.

1085
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,351
I COULD FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY SHE

1086
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,353
THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT 

1087
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:36,553
TOUGH.

1088
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:38,156
AND MAYBE SOME DAY SHE'LL DO 

1089
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:38,456
THAT.

1090
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,091
IF THEY DON'T MAKE THE RIGHT 

1091
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,592
DEAL, SHE MAY VERY WELL DO WHAT 

1092
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,261
I SUGGESTED SHE MIGHT WANT TO 

1093
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:43,494
DO.

1094
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,096
IT IS NOT AN EASY THING.

1095
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,131
LOOK AT THE UNITED STATES HOW 

1096
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,232
THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS TAKEN 

1097
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,500
ADVANTAGE SYSTEMATICALLY OF THE 

1098
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,468
UNITED STATES ON TRADE.

1099
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,004
IT'S A DISGRACE.

1100
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:59,510
IT'S NOT AN EASY NEGOTIATION.

1101
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,647
>> JOHN, GO AHEAD, JOHN.

1102
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,081
NO.

1103
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,750
JOHN ROBERT, GO AHEAD.

1104
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,517
CNN'S FAKE NEWS.

1105
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,986
I DON'T TAKE QUESTIONS FROM CNN.

1106
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:09,821
CNN IS FAKE NEWS.

1107
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,857
I DON'T TAKE QUESTIONS FROM CNN.

1108
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,958
JOHN ROBERTS OF FOX.

1109
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,193
LET'S GO TO A REAL NETWORK. 

1110
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:17,795
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

1111
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,864
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THE 

1112
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:20,831
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED 

1113
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:22,467
STATES AND RUSSIA ARE AT THEIR 

1114
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,467
LOWEST POINT SINCE THE END OF 

1115
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:24,969
THE COLD WAR.

1116
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,370
YOU HAVE STATED MANY, MANY TIMES

1117
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,239
THAT YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

1118
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,074
HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH 

1119
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:30,307
RUSSIA.

1120
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:33,511
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR RELATIONS 

1121
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,312
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 

1122
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,248
RUSSIA TO IMPROVE AS LONG AS 

1123
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,750
PUTIN CONTINUES TO OCCUPY 

1124
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,983
CRIMEA?

1125
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:42,820
>> YES, I THINK SO.

1126
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,687
I THINK I HAVE A VERY GOOD 

1127
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:44,522
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 

1128
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,123
PUTIN IF WE SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

1129
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:47,458
I MAY BE WRONG.

1130
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,559
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT DIDN'T

1131
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,461
WORK OUT, BUT I'M DIFFERENT THAN

1132
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,062
OTHER PEOPLE.

1133
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,397
I THINK WE'RE BEING HURT VERY 

1134
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:54,832
BADLY BY I WOULD CALL IT THE 

1135
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,034
WITCH HUNT.

1136
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:57,735
I WOULD CALL IT THE RIGGED WITCH

1137
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,137
HUNT AFTER WATCHING SOME OF THE 

1138
00:33:59,137 --> 00:33:59,704
LITTLE CLIPS.

1139
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,907
I DIDN'T GET TO WATCH TOO MUCH.

1140
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:03,808
I'M HERE.

1141
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,210
IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE.

1142
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,012
AFTER WATCHING THE MAN THAT WAS 

1143
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:08,712
TESTIFYING YESTERDAY, I'D CALL 

1144
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:10,647
IT THE RIGGED WITCH HUNT, I 

1145
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:11,715
THINK THAT REALLY HURTS OUR 

1146
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,217
COUNTRY AND IT REALLY HURTS OUR 

1147
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:13,885
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA.

1148
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,085
I THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE A 

1149
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,954
CHANCE TO HAVE A VERY GOOD 

1150
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,489
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA AND A 

1151
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,158
VERY GOOD CHANCE, A VERY GOOD 

1152
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:22,760
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 

1153
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,327
PUTIN.

1154
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:23,960
I WOULD HOPE SO.

1155
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,763
>> WHAT IS YOUR THINKING ABOUT 

1156
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,297
IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA 

1157
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:29,500
WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO ILLEGALLY

1158
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,134
OCCUPY ANOTHER COUNTRY?

1159
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:34,605
>> YES, THEY DO.

1160
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,942
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CRIMEA, 

1161
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:38,976
AGAIN, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA 

1162
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,846
FAILED VERY BADLY WITH CRIMEA.

1163
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:43,513
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE DONE

1164
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:45,483
THAT IF I WERE PRESIDENT.

1165
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,185
HE TOOK OVER CRIMEA DURING THE 

1166
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:50,021
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION I THINK YOU

1167
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:50,321
WILL ADMIT.

1168
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,056
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1169
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,424
I'M NOT BAD AT DOING THINGS.

1170
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,293
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT I'VE DONE 

1171
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,426
COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE 

1172
00:34:56,426 --> 00:35:00,264
HAVE DONE 160 DAYS IN, THERE'S 

1173
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,232
NOBODY EVEN CLOSE I DON'T 

1174
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:01,499
BELIEVE.

1175
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,367
SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1176
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,470
BUT THIS WAS AN OBAMA DISASTER 

1177
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,372
AND I THINK IF I WERE PRESIDENT 

1178
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,506
THEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN 

1179
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:11,108
OVER CRIMEA.

1180
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,344
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 

1181
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,346
HE ESSENTIALLY TOOK OVER CRIMEA.

1182
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,447
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE DONE

1183
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,617
THAT WITH ME AS PRESIDENT, JOHN.

1184
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,353
>> IF I COULD FOLLOW-UP, YOU 

1185
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:26,457
HAVE TAKEN ON MANY THINGS YOU 

1186
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,858
SAY YOUR LEFT WITH BY THE OBAMA 

1187
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:28,792
ADMINISTRATION THAT YOU SAY YOU 

1188
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:29,860
HAVE FIXED.

1189
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,228
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU INHERITED 

1190
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:32,396
FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, 

1191
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,697
THE OCCUPATION OF CRIMEA.

1192
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:34,832
HOW DO YOU FIX IT?

1193
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,500
>> WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT 

1194
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:36,733
HAPPENS.

1195
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:37,401
IT'S A PROCESS.

1196
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,836
IF I KNEW, I WOULDN'T TELL YOU 

1197
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,272
BECAUSE THAT WOULD PUT US AT A 

1198
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:41,605
DISADVANTAGE.

1199
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:42,272
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1200
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:46,744
WE'LL SEE HOW IT ALL COMES OUT.

1201
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,779
I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

1202
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,215
THAT CRIMEA WAS ANOTHER BAD HAND

1203
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,750
I GOT HANDED NORTH KOREA.

1204
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,253
WE'RE DOING VERY WELL.

1205
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,653
YOU SAW THE LETTER YESTERDAY.

1206
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:57,722
WE'RE DOING VERY WELL.

1207
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,423
WE HAVEN'T HAD NUCLEAR TESTING.

1208
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,659
WE HAVEN'T HAD MISSILE LAUNCHES.

1209
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,694
WE HAVEN'T HAD ROCKET LAUNCHES.

1210
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,831
SOME SITES WERE BLOWN UP.

1211
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,967
WE GOT BACK MORE HOSTAGES, OUR 

1212
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,335
PRISONERS EVEN BEFORE I LEFT.

1213
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,337
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE 

1214
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:13,637
HAPPENING.

1215
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,006
THERE'S SOME GOOD FEELING.

1216
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,273
IT'S PROBABLY A LONGER PROCESS 

1217
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:18,209
THAN ANYBODY WOULD LIKE, BUT I'M

1218
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:22,146
USED TO LONG PROCESSES TOO.

1219
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,582
WE HAVEN'T TAKEN OFF THE 

1220
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:24,849
SANCTIONS.

1221
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,517
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMEA, 

1222
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,586
THAT'S SOMETHING I TOOK OVER, 

1223
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:28,786
JOHN.

1224
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:29,687
THERE'S NOTHING MUCH I HAVE TO 

1225
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,155
SAY ABOUT IT OTHER THAN WE WILL 

1226
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,623
LOOK AT THAT JUST LIKE I'M 

1227
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,091
LOOKING AT MANY OTHER DISASTERS 

1228
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,026
THAT I'VE TAKEN OVER.

1229
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,161
I'VE TAKEN OVER A LOT OF BAD 

1230
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,896
HANDS AND I'M FIXING THEM ONE BY

1231
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:39,062
ONE.

1232
00:36:39,062 --> 00:36:46,303
I KNOW HOW TO FIX THEM.

1233
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:47,471
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THAT HE 

1234
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,273
MADE SUGGESTIONS TO YOU ON WHAT 

1235
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,141
TO DO BREXIT.

1236
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,842
CAN WE ASK IF YOU WOULD MAKE A 

1237
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,777
SUGGESTION ON HIM HOW TO HANDLE 

1238
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:56,414
HIS MEETING WITH PUTIN?

1239
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,082
>> WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

1240
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:03,187
TODAY WHICH

1241
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,321
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE 

1242
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:07,024
PRESIDENT GOES INTO THIS AS HE 

1243
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,826
IS DOING, FROM A POSITION OF 

1244
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:09,360
STRENGTH.

1245
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,962
AND ALSO FROM A POSITION OF 

1246
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,397
UNITY IN NATO.

1247
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,266
I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT.

1248
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,101
OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE

1249
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,269
ACTIVITY OF RUSSIA.

1250
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,471
INCLUDING THE USE OF A NERVE 

1251
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,540
AGENT HERE ON THE STREETS OF THE

1252
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,042
UNITED KINGDOM AND THE IMPACT 

1253
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:25,976
IT'S HAD.

1254
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:27,745
I WELCOME THE STRONG RESPONSE 

1255
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,946
THE UNITED STATES GAVE TO THAT.

1256
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,448
WE HAD RESPONSE FROM AROUND THE 

1257
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,048
WORLD.

1258
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,351
I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING, IN 

1259
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,985
PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE NATO 

1260
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:36,386
SUMMIT, THE PRESIDENT IS GOING 

1261
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:37,955
INTO THIS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT

1262
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,390
PUTIN FROM THE POSITION OF 

1263
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,259
STRENGTH AND UNITY AROUND THE 

1264
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:45,730
NATO TABLE.

1265
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,330
JASON?

1266
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,933
>> THANK YOU, JASON GROSS, THE 

1267
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,433
DAILY MAIL.

1268
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,002
PRIME MINISTER, IN THE COMMENTS 

1269
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:54,671
YESTERDAY, YOUR OWN MPs SORT OF 

1270
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,307
SIDED WITH DONALD TRUMP, REALLY,

1271
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,041
AND SAID THIS DEAL THAT YOU 

1272
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,176
SIGNED HERE AT CLERKS IS GOING 

1273
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,511
TO BE BAD FOR TRADE.

1274
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,847
WHY CAN'T YOU CONVINCE YOUR OWN 

1275
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,982
MPs IT'S A GOOD IDEA?

1276
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,151
AND MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE SAID

1277
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,019
BREXIT IS A TOUGH SITUATION.

1278
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,388
WHAT WOULD YOU DO NOW?

1279
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,822
WOULD YOU BE AT THE POINT TO 

1280
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,024
WALK AWAY FROM TALKS TO SHOW 

1281
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:15,426
THEM THAT YOU MEAN BUSINESS?

1282
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,294
>> FIRST OF ALL, ON THE ISSUE OF

1283
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,897
TRADE DEALS, AS I'VE SAID 

1284
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,899
EARLIER, WHAT WE'RE -- 

1285
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,200
NEGOTIATING AND WHEN WE COME OUT

1286
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,869
OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, I WANT TO 

1287
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:29,273
SEE AND WE WILL HAVE OUR ABILITY

1288
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,608
TO HAVE INDEPENDENT TRADE 

1289
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:30,975
POLICY.

1290
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,077
SET OUR OWN TARIFFS.

1291
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,678
TO BE AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER OF 

1292
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:36,647
THE WTO.

1293
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,682
TO NEGOTIATE AROUND THE WORLD.

1294
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:39,983
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE UNITED 

1295
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:40,984
STATES AND OTHER AREAS.

1296
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:43,787
WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES LIKE, 

1297
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:46,823
THE -- POSSIBILITY OF SOME TRADE

1298
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:48,959
DEALS AROUND THE PACIFIC AREA, 

1299
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:49,894
TOO.

1300
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,930
WE WILL KNOW GAUCHE YAT THOSE 

1301
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,898
TRADE DEALS.

1302
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,268
I WANT TO HAVE A GOOD 

1303
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,468
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN 

1304
00:38:58,468 --> 00:38:58,803
UNION.

1305
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,471
THE UNITED KINGDOM IS LOOKING 

1306
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:08,446
FOR AND CAN KNOW NEGOTIATE A GO 

1307
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:09,046
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED 

1308
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,180
STATES AND AROUND THE REST OF 

1309
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,248
THE WORLD AS WELL.

1310
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,050
THAT IS WHAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR 

1311
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,252
JOBS, PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS, 

1312
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,821
PROSPERITY HERE IN THE UK.

1313
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,523
>> WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER, I WAS 

1314
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,158
OPENING TURNBERRY, THE DAY 

1315
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,493
BEFORE BREXIT.

1316
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,728
WE HAD AN UNBELIEVABLY LARGE 

1317
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:25,963
NUMBER OF REPORTERS THERE.

1318
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,198
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS THERE, I 

1319
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,866
GUESS, BECAUSE OF BREXIT.

1320
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,634
AND THEY ALL SHOWED UP ON THE 

1321
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,269
9th HOLE, OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN.

1322
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,138
AND I SAID, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1323
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,539
ALL THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT 

1324
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,273
WAS BREXIT.

1325
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,608
THEY ASKED MY OPINION.

1326
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,243
I THINK YOU'LL AGREE, I SAID 

1327
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,946
THAT I THINK BREXIT WILL HAPPEN.

1328
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,715
AND IT DID HAPPEN.

1329
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,783
WE CUT THE RIBBON.

1330
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,751
THE REASON I FELT IT WOULD 

1331
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:49,119
HAPPEN IS BECAUSE OF 

1332
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:49,419
IMMIGRATION.

1333
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:52,222
ONE OF THE REASONS I GOT ELECTED

1334
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:54,091
WAS BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION.

1335
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,160
I FELT BREXIT HAD THE UPPER 

1336
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,560
HAND.

1337
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,861
BARACK OBAMA SAID, WELL, YOUR 

1338
00:39:57,861 --> 00:39:59,796
COUNTRY WILL HAVE TO GET ON THE 

1339
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:00,330
BACK OF THE LINE IF THAT 

1340
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,299
HAPPENED.

1341
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,333
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A TERRIBLE 

1342
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,935
THING TO SAY, FRANKLY.

1343
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,403
BUT I SAID I THOUGHT IT WAS 

1344
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:07,505
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1345
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,672
AND IT DID HAPPEN.

1346
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:12,743
AND I ALSO THINK THAT -- AS FAR 

1347
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,611
AS NEGOTIATING THE DEAL, I 

1348
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,380
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT MY

1349
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,482
SUGGESTION WAS TO THE PRIME 

1350
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:18,916
MINISTER.

1351
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,351
BUT SHE CAN ALWAYS DO THAT.

1352
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,619
SHE CAN DO THAT AT SOME POINT.

1353
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,590
SHE CAN DO WHAT I SUGGESTED TO 

1354
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,358
HER.

1355
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,492
>> WOULD YOU WALK AWAY?

1356
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,027
>> YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY.

1357
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,795
IF SHE DOES THAT, SHE'S STUCK.

1358
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:33,097
YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY.

1359
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,800
YOU CAN DO OTHER THINGS.

1360
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,604
SHE CAN DO WHAT MY SUGGESTION 

1361
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:40,771
WAS.

1362
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,606
AND MY SUGGESTION WAS 

1363
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,909
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.

1364
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,111
SHE WILL DO VERY WELL.

1365
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,947
THINK SHE'S A VERY TOUGH NE 

1366
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,716
GAUCHE JYATER.

1367
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:53,216
I'VE BEEN WATCHING HER.

1368
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:55,252
SHE'S A SMART AND DETERMINED 

1369
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:55,485
PERSON.

1370
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:57,054
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE 

1371
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:02,359
LOOKING UP NOW SAYING, GEE, 

1372
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,727
WHIZ, SHE LEFT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

1373
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,529
IN HER WAKE.

1374
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,464
SHE'S A VERY SMART, VERY TOUGH, 

1375
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:08,632
VERY CAPABLE PERSON.

1376
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,334
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE HER AS 

1377
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,169
MY FRIEND THAN AS MY ENEMY.

1378
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,304
THAT, I CAN TELL YOU.

1379
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,939
>> AND WE E ARE FRIENDS.

1380
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,639
>> GO AHEAD.

1381
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,208
>> JEFF MACE FRN REUTERS.

1382
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:22,746
>> I LIKE YOUR HAT.

1383
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,347
>> THANK YOU.

1384
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:27,283
>> YOU WOULD LOOK GOOD WITHOUT 

1385
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:27,651
IT.

1386
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,853
>> THANK YOU, SIR.

1387
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:31,121
GOING INTO YOUR MEETING.

1388
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,823
>> TAKE IT OFF, JEFF.

1389
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,056
PLEASE?

1390
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:34,592
>> OH, BOY.

1391
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,326
OKAY.

1392
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,694
>> I LIKE YOU BETTER WITHOUT THE

1393
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,094
HAT.

1394
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:37,761
>> GO AHEAD.

1395
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,597
>> THERE WE GO.

1396
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,598
GOING INTO YOUR MEETING WITH 

1397
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,500
PRESIDENT PUTIN ON MONDAY, SIR, 

1398
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,735
YOU MENTIONED DENUCLEARIZATION 

1399
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:45,803
AND SYRIA.

1400
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,003
CAN YOU SAY WHAT YOUR MESSAGE 

1401
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:48,772
WILL BE TO HIM ON SYRIA?

1402
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:54,044
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE HIM TO SAY 

1403
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,846
GIVEN ASSAD'S GAINS.

1404
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,016
AND ON DENUCLEARIZATION CAN YOU 

1405
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,585
SPELL OUT HOW YOU EXPECT IT TO 

1406
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:01,818
HAPPEN?

1407
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:03,287
>> IT WILL BE A SLOW PROCESS.

1408
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,122
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT 

1409
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:05,623
HAVE NUKE.

1410
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,459
IT WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS.

1411
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,293
FOR US, OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO 

1412
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:16,000
COME ALONGSIDELE TAN USELY.

1413
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,267
I THINK THAT WHEN THE MEETING 

1414
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:19,370
WAS ARRANGED, AND WE BOTH WANTED

1415
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,904
THE MEETING, WHEN THE MEETING 

1416
00:42:20,904 --> 00:42:23,474
WAS ARRANGED, IT WAS FROM MY 

1417
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,442
STANDPOINT, I DIDN'T GO IN WITH 

1418
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,376
HIGH EXPECTATIONS.

1419
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,445
YOU MAY COME OUT WITH SOMETHING 

1420
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,680
EXCEPTIONAL.

1421
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,249
BUT, THE PRO LIFE VAGS A 

1422
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,183
TREMENDOUS -- I MEAN, TO ME, 

1423
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,785
THEst THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE

1424
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,954
WORLD.

1425
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,822
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

1426
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,557
BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE WORLD.

1427
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,660
I UNDERSTAND NUCLEAR.

1428
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,329
LOOK UP DR. JOHN TRUMP AT M.I.T.

1429
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,830
HE WAS MY UNCLE.

1430
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,767
MANY, MANY YEARS A PROFESSOR.

1431
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,068
I USED TO TALK NUCLEAR WITH HIM 

1432
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,770
MANY H, MANY YEARS AGO.

1433
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,838
IT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN MY 

1434
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,306
OPINION, THIS WORLD HAS.

1435
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:57,174
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

1436
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,643
IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING TO 

1437
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,444
SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THEM?

1438
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,614
I MEAN, IDEALLY GET RID OF THEM.

1439
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,748
MAYBE THAT'S A DREAM.

1440
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,583
BUT CERTAINLY, IT'S A SUBJECT 

1441
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:10,020
I'LL BRING UP WITH HIM.

1442
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,989
AND IT'S ALSO VERY EXPENSIEXPEN.

1443
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,424
THAT'S THE LEAST IMPORTANT.

1444
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,592
SO, IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING.

1445
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:18,095
BUT, I DIDN'T GO IN -- I WAS 

1446
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,029
TELLING THE PRIME MINISTER 

1447
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:19,496
BEFORE.

1448
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,498
I DIDN'T GO IN WITH HIGH 

1449
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:21,831
EXPECTATIONS.

1450
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:23,600
WE DO HAVE A -- A POLITICAL 

1451
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,168
PROBLEM WHERE, YOU KNOW IN THE 

1452
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:26,603
UNITED STATES, WE HAVE THIS 

1453
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,539
STUPIDITY GOING ON.

1454
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,106
PURE STUPIDITY.

1455
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,340
IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO DO 

1456
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,710
SOMETHING WITH RUSSIA.

1457
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,344
ANYTHING YOU DO, IT'S ALWAYS 

1458
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,113
GOING THE TO BE, OH, RUSSIA, HE 

1459
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:36,914
LOVES RUSSIA.

1460
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,048
I LOVE THE UNITED STATES.

1461
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,850
BUT I LOVE GETTING ALONG WITH 

1462
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,083
RUSSIA.

1463
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,085
AND CHINA.

1464
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,519
AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

1465
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,255
AND, IT WILL CERTAINLY BE, JEFF,

1466
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,657
SOMETHING WE BRING UP AND TALK 

1467
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:46,857
ABOUT.

1468
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,826
I THINK, TO ME, IT'S SUCH A BIG 

1469
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,760
PROBLEM.

1470
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,794
SYRIA, OF COURSE, I'LL BRING 

1471
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,229
THAT UP.

1472
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:54,798
AND YUKRAINE.

1473
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,632
AND OTHER SUBJECTS.

1474
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:58,134
>> CAN YOU SPELL OUT WHAT YOU 

1475
00:43:58,134 --> 00:44:00,570
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM HIM ON 

1476
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:00,871
SYRIA?

1477
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:01,972
>> THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE.

1478
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,907
THE RED LINE IN THE SAND WAS A 

1479
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:04,942
PROBLEM FOR US.

1480
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,444
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE PRESIDENT

1481
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,279
PUTIN TO DO NOW UNDER YOUR 

1482
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:09,512
WATCH?

1483
00:44:09,512 --> 00:44:10,914
>> I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM 

1484
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:11,448
ABOUT THAT.

1485
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,350
BEFORE I TALK TO YOU.

1486
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,385
AND, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, IT 

1487
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:16,186
WILL BE GREAT.

1488
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,354
IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

1489
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,623
I'M NOT GOING IN WITH HIGH 

1490
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:19,956
EXPECTATIONS.

1491
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:21,859
WE MAY COME OUT WITH VERY 

1492
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:26,997
SURPRISING THINGS.

1493
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,866
BUT RELATIONSHIP IS IMPORTANT.

1494
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,133
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH 

1495
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,702
RUSSIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES, I'VE

1496
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:32,936
SAID A NUMBER OF TIMES.

1497
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,372
FOR YEARS, I HAVE BEEN SAYING 

1498
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:35,539
IT.

1499
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,074
I SAID IT DURING MY CAMPAIGN.

1500
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:38,642
HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER 

1501
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:39,810
COUNTRIES IS REALLY A GOOD 

1502
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,077
THING.

1503
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,913
I THINK THAT -- I CAN'T -- 

1504
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,682
REALLY OVERESTIMATE HOW BIG THE 

1505
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:49,119
MEETING WAS YESTERDAY WITH NATO.

1506
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,887
WE WENT WITH SOMETHING THAT 

1507
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:53,490
REALLY WAS AN UNFAIR SITUATION 

1508
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,192
TO SOMETHING THAT IS UNIFIED.

1509
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,860
I MEAN, THEY HAD SPIRIT.

1510
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,730
THOSE PEOPLE WERE GETTING UP AND

1511
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,899
WHERE WE ARE COMMITTING.

1512
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,700
THEY CAN'T GO -- NOT LIKE THEY 

1513
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,802
CAN GO IMMEDIATELY BACK.

1514
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,471
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH 

1515
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,473
PARLIAMENTS AND CONGRESSES AND 

1516
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:09,840
REPRESENTATIVES.

1517
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,908
WHATEVER FORUM THEY HAVE.

1518
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,277
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN 

1519
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:13,677
APPROVAL PROCESS.

1520
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,412
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, EVERY SINGLE

1521
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,414
PERSON IN THE ROOM WAS GUNG HO 

1522
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,449
TO GET IT DONE TO GET THE MONEY 

1523
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:19,750
IN.

1524
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,919
AND EVEN BEFORE THAT, AS YOU 

1525
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:22,753
KNOW, $34 BILLION.

1526
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,421
I THINK THE SECRETARY GENERAL 

1527
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,156
WHO IS DOING A TERRIFIC JOB, BY 

1528
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,059
THE WAY, HE SAID YESTERDAY THAT 

1529
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:29,860
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE 

1530
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,763
HAVE TAKEN IN $34 BILLION MORE 

1531
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:34,898
FOR NATO.

1532
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,399
I THINK THE NUMBER IS ACTUALLY 

1533
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:38,702
MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT.

1534
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,403
BUT $34 BILLION MORE, AT LEAST.

1535
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:42,506
AND AGAIN, THAT'S NOTHING THAT 

1536
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,907
MY OPPONENT WOULD HAVE DONE.

1537
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,576
MY OPPONENT WOULD HAVE -- IT 

1538
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,510
WOULD HAVE KEPT GOING DOWN.

1539
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,611
IT WAS GOING DOWN.

1540
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:48,979
YOU SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OVER 

1541
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,080
THE YEARS.

1542
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,014
THE NUMBERS WERE GOING DOWN.

1543
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,016
NOW THE NUMBER'S WAY UP.

1544
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,618
IT'S GOING WAY UP HIGHER.

1545
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,054
AND THAT WAS, HE WILL TELL YOU 

1546
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,489
THAT, THAT WAS BECAUSE OF ME.

1547
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,792
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP -- 

1548
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:04,227
>> PRIME MINISTER MAY, THE 

1549
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:05,929
PRESIDENT IN HIS TIME IN 

1550
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,331
BRUSSELS EXPRESSED A CONCERN 

1551
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,832
ABOUT A PIPELINE BETWEEN RUSSIA 

1552
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:09,733
AND GERMANY.

1553
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,635
DO YOU SHARE THOSE CONCERNS?

1554
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,069
TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTIONING 

1555
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,237
FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THE 

1556
00:46:14,237 --> 00:46:16,807
BRITISH PRESS AND THE AMERICAN 

1557
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,376
SIDE, DID YOU FEEL UNDERMINED BY

1558
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:20,243
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS IN 

1559
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:23,313
THE SUN ABOUT THE BREXIT PLAN 

1560
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,615
AND ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON?

1561
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,617
>> NO, I'M VERY CLEAR THAT OUR 

1562
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:29,152
BREXIT PLAN WILL DELIVER ON WHAT

1563
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:30,753
THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE VOTED 

1564
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:31,054
FOR.

1565
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,256
WE HAVE HAD AN EXCELLENT 

1566
00:46:33,256 --> 00:46:34,258
DISCUSSION HERE.

1567
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,126
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY AND THE 

1568
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,096
INTENT THAT WE BOTH HAVE TO HAVE

1569
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,864
AN AMBITIOUS TRADE DEAL GOING 

1570
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:41,465
FORWARD.

1571
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,233
THAT'S WHERE WE'LL BE GOING.

1572
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,600
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH 

1573
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,403
OF OUR COUNTRIES.

1574
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:46,670
ACTUALLY.

1575
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,738
WE STAND, WE HAVE STOOD SHOULDER

1576
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:49,639
TO SHOULD WE ARE THE UNITED 

1577
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,208
STATES IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

1578
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,444
OVER THE YEARS AS A RESULT OF 

1579
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:54,978
OUR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.

1580
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,246
WE'LL SHOW THAT FURTHER THROUGH 

1581
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,747
THE TRADE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE 

1582
00:46:57,747 --> 00:46:58,281
WOULD PUT IN PLACE IN THE 

1583
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:00,751
FUTURE.

1584
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,786
>> AND I HAVE TO JUST TO FIN IR 

1585
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,722
OFF, JEFF, I HAVE TO SAY, I SAID

1586
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,592
TO THE PAPER, "THE SUN," AND 

1587
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,893
THEY SEEMED LIKE TWO VERY NICE 

1588
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:10,294
PEOPLE.

1589
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:14,064
BUT I SAID THAT -- THERESA 

1590
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:14,464
MAY -- 

1591
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,533
>> ONE OF THEM IS NICE?

1592
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,468
>> ONE OF THEM IS SITTING HERE.

1593
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,204
>> WHERE IS THAT PERSON?

1594
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:25,041
DID I SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT 

1595
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,244
THERESA MAY, PLEASE?

1596
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:27,811
OH, GOOD.

1597
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,513
IF YOU REPORTED THEM.

1598
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,081
WHERE, ON THE INTERNET?

1599
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,082
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.

1600
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,517
NO, I SAID VERY GOOD THINGS 

1601
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:34,784
ABOUT HER.

1602
00:47:34,784 --> 00:47:36,320
I DIDN'T THINK THEY PUT IT IN.

1603
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,955
I WISH THEY PUT THAT IN THE 

1604
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:38,222
HEADLINE.

1605
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,690
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

1606
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,791
AND SHE'S A TOTAL PROFESSIONAL.

1607
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,693
I SAID THIS MORNING, I WANT TO 

1608
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:44,861
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I SAID SUCH 

1609
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:45,963
GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU.

1610
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,631
SHE SAID, DON'T WORRY, IT'S ONLY

1611
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,198
THE PRESS.

1612
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,167
I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY 

1613
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:50,500
PROFESSIONAL.

1614
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,471
I MIGHT ADD, I MIGHT ADD -- IT'S

1615
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,305
CALLED BEING -- THEY'VE BEEN 

1616
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:56,740
DOING IT TO ME.

1617
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,141
I'VE BEEN DOING TO IT THEM.

1618
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,177
I DO SAY THOUGH THE PIPELINE.

1619
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,511
YOU ASKED ABOUT THE PIPELINE.

1620
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,913
TO ME, SIT A TRAGEDY.

1621
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:06,750
I THINK IT'S A HORRIFIC THING 

1622
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,951
THAT'S BEING DONE.

1623
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,920
WHERE YOU'RE FEEDING BILLIONS 

1624
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,456
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM 

1625
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,491
GERMANY, PRIMARILY, AND OTHER 

1626
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,760
COUNTRIES, BUT PRIMARILY FROM 

1627
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,729
GERMANY INTO THE COFFERS OF 

1628
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,029
RUSSIA.

1629
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,932
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO 

1630
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:24,668
SOMETHING SO THAT THERE IS PEACE

1631
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:25,368
IN THE WORLD.

1632
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:26,836
I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE THING 

1633
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:28,004
THAT GERMANY IS DOING.

1634
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:28,938
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

1635
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:32,075
AS MUCH AS I LIKE ANGELA, I WAS 

1636
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,210
VERY OPEN IN SAYING IT.

1637
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,577
I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE THING 

1638
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:36,079
THAT YOU HAVE A PIPELINE COMING 

1639
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:36,713
FROM RUSSIA.

1640
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,181
AND I BELIEVE THAT GERMANY IS 

1641
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,817
GOING TO BE GETTING 50, 60, I 

1642
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,919
HAVE HEARD NUMBERS OF 70% OF 

1643
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,521
THEIR ENERGY COMING IN FROM 

1644
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:44,754
RUSSIA.

1645
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:47,991
AND HOW CAN YOU BE -- WORKING 

1646
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,527
FOR A PEACE AND WORKING FROM 

1647
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,028
STRENGTH WHEN SOMEBODY HAS THAT 

1648
00:48:52,028 --> 00:48:53,930
KIND OF POWER OVER YOUR COUNTRY.

1649
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,198
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD.

1650
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,134
YOU'RE NOT WORKING FROM 

1651
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:57,467
STRENGTH.

1652
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,203
YOU HAVE GIVEN UP ALL OF YOUR 

1653
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:00,470
STRENGTH.

1654
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,640
IT'S BAD FOR GERMANY.

1655
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,375
BAD FOR THE GERMAN PEOPLE.

1656
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,344
IT'S BAD FOR NATO, IF YOU WANT 

1657
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:09,146
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

1658
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,747
>> WE SAID WE WOULD TAKE FOUR 

1659
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:11,381
QUESTIONS EACH.

1660
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,916
WE HAVE TAKEN FOUR QUESTIONS 

1661
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:13,817
EACH.

1662
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,518
JUST ON THE PIPELINE ISSUE ON 

1663
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:16,219
THE NORTH STREAM.

1664
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,687
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE 

1665
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:18,722
GERMANS ABOUT THIS.

1666
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,723
TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITHIN THE 

1667
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:22,025
EUROPEAN UNION ABOUT THIS.

1668
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,293
WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SIT AROUND 

1669
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,295
THE EU TABLE, THIS IS MANAGER 

1670
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,130
THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED AT THE 

1671
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,365
EUROPEAN UNION TABLE.

1672
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,034
WE'LL MAKE OUR VIEWS KNOWN 

1673
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:31,234
THERE.

1674
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,636
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU.

1675
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,905
>> CAN YOU SHARE YOUR VIEWS WITH

1676
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:35,205
US?

1677
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:35,739
YOUR POSITION?

1678
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,973
>> WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS 

1679
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:37,541
WITH GERMANY.

1680
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,810
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR HIS

1681
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,911
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IS 

1682
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:41,311
HAPPENING.

1683
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,046
ANGELA MERKEL MADE HER POSITION 

1684
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:43,246
CLEAR.

1685
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,482
WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, THERE

1686
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,950
ARE DISCUSSIONS TO BE HELD ON 

1687
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,985
THE ISSUE OF NORTH STREAM TWO.

1688
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,654
WE'RE TALKING TO OTHER COUNTRIES

1689
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,021
WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION.

1690
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:53,389
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT SAID 

1691
00:49:53,389 --> 00:49:54,824
EARLIER IN RESPONSE TO A 

1692
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:56,292
QUESTION ABOUT A MEETING HE WAS 

1693
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:58,194
GOING TO HAVE, THAT HE WOULD 

1694
00:49:58,194 --> 00:49:59,429
TELL YOU WHAT WAS HAPPENING 

1695
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,964
AFTER THAT MEETING.

1696
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:02,799
AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT COMES OUT 

1697
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,701
FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION.

1698
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,903
WHILE WE'RE A MEMBER OF THE EU.

1699
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,873
WE STILL ARE UNTIL THE 27th OF 

1700
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:10,807
MARCH, 2019.

1701
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,776
AND THEN WE'RE LEAVING.

1702
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,144
>> AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

1703
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,848
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALONGSIDE 

1704
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,216
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THERESA 

1705
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,383
MAY.

1706
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:23,520
A REMARKABLE 24 HOURS.

1707
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,589
STANDING ALONGSIDE AFTER THE 

1708
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,625
INTERVIEW WITH THE SUN, SAYING 

1709
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,161
THAT THERESA MAY'S STANCE ON 

1710
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,062
BREXIT WAS WRONG.

1711
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,163
SHE WRECKED IT.

1712
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,532
HE GAVE HER ADVICE HE SAYS SHE 

1713
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,600
DID NOT TAKE.

1714
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,201
OFFERED PRAISE FOR HER MAIN 

1715
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,136
RIVAL, BORIS JOHNSON, AND SAID 

1716
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:42,472
HE COULD HAVE HANDLED BREXIT 

1717
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:42,705
BETTER.

1718
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:44,207
THE FIRST QUESTION, MR. 

1719
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,475
PRESIDENT, YOU CHANGED YOUR TUNE

1720
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:46,443
HERE THIS MORNING.

1721
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:51,280
IS THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF A F

1722
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:51,514
FRIEND?

1723
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:53,517
HE SAID, I DIDN'T CRITICIZE HER.

1724
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,685
HE POINTED TO A RECORDING OF THE

1725
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:55,952
INTERVIEW.

1726
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,286
HE SAID TRADE IS TRICKY.

1727
00:50:57,286 --> 00:50:59,789
WHATEVER YOU DO, I SUPPORT IT.

1728
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:02,259
IT'S UP TO YOU WHEN IT CAME TO 

1729
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:02,492
BREXIT.

1730
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,261
HE ALLUDED TO ADVICE.

1731
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,729
THE SUGGESTION HE GAVE TO HER.

1732
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,163
SAYING AT SOME POINT, PERHAPS, 

1733
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:08,131
SHE'LL TAKE IT.

1734
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,566
HE DID SAY THAT WHEN HE SAW HER 

1735
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,601
THIS MORNING, HE SAID, I WANT TO

1736
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,436
APOLOGIZE FOR THE HEADLINES THAT

1737
00:51:13,436 --> 00:51:15,372
GREETED THE FOLKS IN THE UK THIS

1738
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:16,640
MORNING AFTER THAT INTERVIEW.

1739
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,942
HE SAID THAT SHE TOLD HIM DON'T 

1740
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,410
WORRY, IT'S JUST THE PRESS.

1741
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,879
LET'S GET RIGHT TO OUR CHIEF 

1742
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:25,348
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT TERRY 

1743
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:25,782
MORAN.

1744
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,984
THIS WAS SOMETHING TO SEE.

1745
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,886
STANDING SIDE BY SIDE.

1746
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:33,856
THEY MADE IT APPEAR THE 

1747
00:51:33,856 --> 00:51:34,724
RELATIONSHIP IS QUITE STRONG.

1748
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,093
THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH THE 

1749
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,962
JUXTAPOSITION OF THE INTERVIEW 

1750
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:41,631
AND STANDING BESIDE HER TODAY 

1751
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,934
SAYING SHE'S A GREAT LEADER.

1752
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,169
>> Reporter: WELL, IT'S BEEN 

1753
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:46,937
HEAD-SPINNING, DAVID.

1754
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,804
THE ENGLISH PEOPLE GOT A GOOD, 

1755
00:51:48,804 --> 00:51:50,106
LONG LOOK AT THE TRUMP SHOW.

1756
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:54,177
WHERE HE SAYS SOMETHING 

1757
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:54,510
CONTROVERSIAL.

1758
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:55,278
PUTS SOMETHING WAY OUT THERE.

1759
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,280
THIS IS ALL ANYBODY IS TALKING 

1760
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,480
ABOUT.

1761
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,982
MAY WRECKED BREXIT.

1762
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,016
U.S. DEAL IS OFF.

1763
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,884
AND HE DID SAY THOSE THINGS IN 

1764
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:03,687
THAT INTERVIEW.

1765
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,355
TODAY WAS DAMAGE CONTROL.

1766
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,190
TRYING TO GET BACK ON THE SAME 

1767
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:07,390
PAGE.

1768
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,593
AND YOU COULD SEE HOW THEY BOTH 

1769
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:10,260
DECIDED TO HANDLE IT.

1770
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,094
ALL IS GREAT.

1771
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:13,730
IT MAY BE BETWEEN THE LEADERS 

1772
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:14,464
AND THE GOVERNMENTS.

1773
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,333
THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN TODAY ARE 

1774
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,134
GOING TO HEAR THIS AND LOOK AT 

1775
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,703
IT AND SAY, HE'S HUMILIATED OUR 

1776
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:21,504
PRIME MINISTER.

1777
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:23,039
SHE'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO 

1778
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,440
ANSWER HIM BACK IN A WAY THAT 

1779
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,510
BACKS HIM OFF FROM THESE KINDS 

1780
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,280
OF COMMENTS.

1781
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,581
WHILE MANY PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT 

1782
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:35,051
HIS CALL FOR HARSHLY RESTRICTED 

1783
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,453
IMMIGRATION, OTHERS WILL SAY 

1784
00:52:37,453 --> 00:52:38,588
IMMIGRATION HAS MADE BRITAIN 

1785
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:38,855
STRONGER.

1786
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,322
HE LEAVES A COUNTRY THAT THEIR 

1787
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:41,891
HEAD IS SPINNING HERE FROM THE 

1788
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:43,659
KINDS OF COMMENTS THAT HE'S 

1789
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:43,927
MADE.

1790
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,096
THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP HE PUTS

1791
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,998
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SPECIAL.

1792
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,268
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 

1793
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:52,435
SAYING, WITH SPECIAL FRIENDS 

1794
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,104
LIKE THIS -- WELL, YOU KNOW THE 

1795
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:54,471
REST.

1796
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,641
>> I WANT TO BRING?

1797
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,743
JONATHAN KARL.

1798
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,512
I THOUGHT IT WAS FAIRLY 

1799
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:02,779
STUNNING.

1800
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,981
I DON'T RECALL A MOMENT LIKE 

1801
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:05,214
THIS.

1802
00:53:05,214 --> 00:53:06,082
PERHAPS YOU DO.

1803
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,183
WHERE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

1804
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,151
UNITED STATES WOULD STAND NEXT 

1805
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,153
TO THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 

1806
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,421
AND SAY THAT ANOTHER PERSON 

1807
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,323
WOULD MAKE A GREAT PRIME 

1808
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:18,594
MINISTER OF BRITAIN, BORIS J

1809
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:19,529
JOHNSON, HER MAIN RIVAL.

1810
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,498
HE SAID SHE'S A GREAT LEADER.

1811
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:25,335
BORIS JOHNSON WOULD BE, TOO.

1812
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,270
>> Reporter: THIS ENTIRE TRIP IS

1813
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,939
UNLIKE ANYTHING WE WOULD SEE FOR

1814
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:30,739
A U.S. PRESIDENT.

1815
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:34,210
IN NATO, COMES IN, GUNS 

1816
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:34,477
ABLAZING.

1817
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:37,781
SAYING SOME OF THE MOST UP 

1818
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,316
DIPLOMATIC THINGS WE HAVE SEEN A

1819
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,317
U.S. PRESIDENT SAY.

1820
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,418
LEAVING THE SUMMIT, PROCLAIMING 

1821
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:43,886
EVERYBODY IS UNITED AND MORE 

1822
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:44,487
UNITED THAN EVER.

1823
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,790
THE SAME PATTERN HERE.

1824
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,358
THIS EXTRAORDINARY BREACH OF 

1825
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,026
PROTOCOL WITH "THE SUN" 

1826
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,327
INTERVIEW THAT HE DID HOURS 

1827
00:53:51,327 --> 00:53:54,097
BEFORE SITTING DOWN WITH THERESA

1828
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:54,263
MAY.

1829
00:53:54,263 --> 00:53:56,699
NOW COMING OUT AND SAYING OUR 

1830
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:58,702
RELATIONSHIP IS THE MOST SPECIAL

1831
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,937
ORM OF SPECIAL, SPECIAL 

1832
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,005
RELATIONSHIPS.

1833
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,674
AN EXTRAORDINARY VISIT BY A 

1834
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,442
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT.

1835
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:08,044
AS HE WAS LEAVING, HE WAS ASKED 

1836
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,679
DIRECTLY, WILL YOU TELL PUTIN TO
