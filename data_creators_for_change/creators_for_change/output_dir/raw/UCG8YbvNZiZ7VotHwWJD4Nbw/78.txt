00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">your face but to make it more festive or</font>

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,559
to make it more holiday like I thought

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,020
that doing metallic lips would be a

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,059
really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea to the first way which</font>

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">is also the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest way to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,590
metallic lips is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use cream lipstick</font>

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,559
and eyeshadow so for this demo I'm going

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,410
to use this beautiful shade of cream

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,590
lipstick from Mac it's part of i'm not

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,690
sure what che this is but it's part of

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,659
the lady gaga collection and i'm going

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use that with this orange shade from</font>

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,570
my forever 21 eyeshadow palette so the

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,770
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you need to do is to put on</font>

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,780
lipstick like how you normally put on

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,970
lipstick so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my finger</font>

28
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,189
to add the metallic eyeshadow to my lip

29
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,619
so just add as much as you can to your

30
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,229
finger and then just Pat it on so I just

31
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,000
finished my bottom lip so<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see</font>

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,560
there's a big difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
using lipstick and then adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shadow</font>

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,540
on top of the lipstick so I'm gonna do

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,159
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top lip now this is the finished</font>

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,100
look just check out<font color="#CCCCCC"> my metallic lips</font>

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,980
so you can do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> combination of</font>

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,140
lipstick and eyeshadow you want you can

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,300
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> use highlighter there are just so</font>

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,060
many ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with this look so</font>

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,890
the second way to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with metallic</font>

42
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,290
lips as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use cream lipstick and</font>

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,650
glitter this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just any glitter</font>

44
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,310
it's from wet and wild so it's meant to

45
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,070
be used as<font color="#E5E5E5"> makeup so don't us get random</font>

46
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,720
glitter from like<font color="#E5E5E5"> national bookstore or</font>

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,570
something I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's very safe</font>

48
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,420
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this shade of cream</font>

49
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,670
lipstick from Mac along with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wet</font>

50
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">and wild mega sparkle glitter thing I</font>

51
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,010
picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two because they're very</font>

52
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,930
similar in color to the first step<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

53
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">sad lipstick now I'm going to take the</font>

54
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,330
glitter and just put a bit on the cap

55
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,200
then I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use my finger to put it</font>

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,709
on my lips

57
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,300
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> finished look so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just check</font>

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:58,709
it out its way<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you literally then</font>

59
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,050
the first one but I don't know I kind of

60
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,640
like it it's cute so the third way you

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,980
can come up with metallic lips is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

62
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,400
clear lip gloss with powder so you can

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,650
use whatever powder you want but of

64
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">course it has to be metallic powder so</font>

65
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,870
this is metallic powder from Caroline

66
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,140
you can also use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these little beads and</font>

67
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">then just crush it up so this one's from</font>

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,819
forever 21 you can also use<font color="#E5E5E5"> bronzer like</font>

69
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,459

74
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,010

75
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,180
thing I'm gonna do is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,209
the bronzing powder on the tray so this
