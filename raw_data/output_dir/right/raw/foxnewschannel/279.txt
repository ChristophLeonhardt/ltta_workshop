NUNES IS WITH US.

6
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:16,139
ROD ROSENSTEIN, ISN'T THIS THE

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,740
GUY THAT RECOMMENDED THE FIRING

8
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:20,376

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,916
AND THIS IS A GUY THAT LISA

12
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:31,421
PAGE, ANDREW McCABE AND JAMES

13
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:33,623
BAKER ALL TALKED ABOUT WEARING A

14
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:35,558
WIRE AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP IN

15
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,627
HOPES OF INVOKING THE 25th

16
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:37,994
AMENDMENT.

17
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:42,632
HE OWES US ANSWERS TO THAT.

18
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,400
>> HE OWES US ANSWERS.

19
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,102
HE'S NOT COMING TOMORROW, WHICH

20
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,871
SHOULD BE VERY TELLING.

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,039
THE STORY IS THAT HE POSSIBLY

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,009
WANTED TO HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,344
WITH CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE.

24
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,513
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

25
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,214
HE NEEDS TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH.

26
00:00:58,215 --> 00:00:59,983
IF YOU LOOK AS THE STORY TONIGHT

27
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:01,784
BREAKING IN "THE WASHINGTON

28
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:04,053
POST," YOU HAVE McCABE AND

29
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:04,921
ROSENSTEIN FIGHTING OVER WHAT

30
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:06,623
HAPPENS AT THE AT THE TIME OF

31
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:08,424
WHEN HE WANTED TO WEAR A WIRE,

32
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:11,060
WHETHER OR NOT HE WANTED TO WEAR

33
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:12,962
A WIRE AND WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE

34
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:14,163
FOR WHAT.

35
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:17,267
CLEARLY THIS IS THE

36
00:01:17,268 --> 00:01:21,804
INVESTIGATORS THAT HAVE NO ONE

37
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:24,040
WATCHING THEM AND THEY'RE

38
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:24,974
RUNNING AMUCK.

39
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,709
SO MUCH THAT THEY WON'T TOUGH TO

40
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,076
CONGRESS.

41
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:28,678
IT'S PATHETIC.

42
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:29,779
>> Sean: THEY'RE BOTH ARGUING

43
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,714
OVER WHO SHOULD HAVE RECUSED

44
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:32,115
THEMSELVES.

45
00:01:32,116 --> 00:01:33,783
BOTH SHOULD HAVE NOW THAT WE

46
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:37,053
KNOW WHAT WE KNOW.

47
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:39,656
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DECLASSIFY

48
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:42,959
AND SEND OUT THE UNREDACTED FISA

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,060
APPLICATIONS, THE BULK OF WHICH

50
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:46,262
THE INFORMATION CAME FROM THE

51
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:47,564
PHONY DOSSIER THAT HILLARY PAID

52
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,732
FOR AND THE FRAUD ON THE FISA

53
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:50,033
COURT.

54
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:51,301
WHERE ARE THOSE DECLASSIFIED

55
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:52,035
DOCUMENTS THAT THE PRESIDENT

56
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,504
SAID HE WOULD RELEASE?

57
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:58,241
WHERE ARE THE 302s BETWEEN

58
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,008
STEELE AND OHR?

59
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,511
>> THE SAME THING IS TRUE, SEAN.

60
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,713
THE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE ARGUING

61
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:08,585
TONIGHT ON THE PAGES OF "THE

62
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,352
WASHINGTON POST," WHETHER WHICH

63
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,486
ONE SHOULD RECUSE THEMSELVES.

64
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:11,988
THIS IS OVER A YEAR AGO WHEN THE

65
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:13,623
SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS APPOINTED.

66
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:15,224
THEY'RE SUPPOSEDLY ARGUING IN

67
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:17,260
FRONT OF MUELLER WHO SHOULD BE

68
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:17,594
RECUSED.

69
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,662
LIKE YOU SAID, THEY BOTH SHOULD

70
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,230
HAVE BEEN RECUSED.

71
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,565
THOSE SAME PEOPLE, THE DEPUTY

72
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:25,101
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT WILL NOT

73
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,302
COME TO CONGRESS TO TESTIFY

74
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:27,804
UNDER OATH IS THE SAME PERSON

75
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:28,671
THAT IS BLOCKING THE AMERICAN

76
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:30,740
PEOPLE THERE BEING ABLE TO SEE

77
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,108
THIS INFORMATION THAT WE IN THE

78
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,910
CONGRESS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR

79
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:35,979
NOW A COUPLE MONTHS FOR THE

80
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,614
PRESIDENT TO DECLASSIFY THEM.

81
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,083
THE PRESIDENT SAID I WANT THIS

82
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:42,352
IMMEDIATELY DECLASSIFIED WITHOUT

83
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:43,386
REDACTIONS AND THEN SHORTLY

84
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:44,887
AFTER THAT, THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY

85
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,723
GENERAL CONVENES A MEETING TO

86
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:47,824
CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT, WE NEED

87
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,826
TO HAVE THE I.G. LOOK AT, THIS

88
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:51,260
THAT'S WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW

89
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:52,662
WITH DECLASSIFICATION.

90
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:54,831
THIS IS A WHOLE NEW ESCALATION.

91
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:57,500
>> Sean: CAN'T TAKE 18 MORE

92
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,035
MONTHS, CONGRESSMAN.

93
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:01,938
>> IT'S RIDICULOUS, SEAN.

94
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:02,972
>> Sean: I AGREE WITH YOU.

95
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,507
>> I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

96
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:04,941
I.G.

97
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,409
I WANT IT DECLASSIFIED.

98
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,044
>> Sean: I AGREE WHOLE

99
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:08,444
HEARTEDLY.

100
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:10,346
A SECOND -- A REAL SPECIAL

101
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:12,081
COUNSEL OUGHT TO BE APPOINTED.

102
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:13,483
THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYING TODAY HE

103
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,517
WON'T SAY WHETHER OR NOT THE

104
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:17,787
PRESIDENT IS BEING WIRETAPPED

105
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:18,721
TODAY?

106
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:23,026
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

107
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:24,160
>> I MEAN, YEAH.

108
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,262
I DON'T KNOW -- SOME OF THAT

109
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:27,163
QUESTIONING GOES IN LITTLE

110
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,331
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

111
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:30,066
LET'S GO BACK TO THE MAIN POINT

112
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:35,038
HERE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW

113
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,640
AT THE START OF THE SPECIAL

114
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,108
PROSECUTOR, SPECIAL COUNSEL,

115
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,111
WHEN REMEMBER, PEOPLE ARE LOSING

116
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:45,748
SIGHT OF THIS, THAT THE CHIEF

117
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,050
INVESTIGATORS AT THE TIME HAD NO

118
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,085
EVIDENCE OF TRUMP CAMPAIGN

119
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:50,486
COLLUDING WITH RUSSIANS.

120
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,789
AND SO WHY DO WE HAVE A SPECIAL

121
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,891
COUNSEL IN THE FIRST PLACE?

122
00:03:54,892 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sean: LOOKS LIKE LISA PAGE
