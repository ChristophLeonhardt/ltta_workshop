I often think this is the eternal boot right I mean there's no reason why you can't keep a pair forever I got my bean boots when I was a senior in college so I've had them for about three years now I've had my boots for about ten years I've had my bean boots for about four winters now so have my boots for about two years exactly this particular pair at least since the fall of 2008 I didn't get them my mom bought them for me in 1984 while I love the boots they function as advertised they're simple they're effective they keep moisture out they keep you dry I love these boots because I am one of those people who always has cold hands always has cold feet except for when I'm wearing my bean boots and often they make my feet too warm because that's how good they are at keeping the warmth in so probably the biggest reason that I love these boots is that they can get through pretty much any kind of weather snow rain sweet they dealt with monsoon rain in California they dealt with going on skiing trips in Colorado they're completely waterproof like no water is getting in to your foot at all I filmed in a rice field in Japan covered in snow I like went into ankle deep water to get these like mountain Scenic's in the winter and like totally totally dry coming out something about this leather might be magical I'm not totally sure can wear it and you know early fall when you're just wearing like a little denim on denim action like just kind of cuff the pant over here or you can wear them with like a thick ass sock and go trudging through the through the wilderness and you'll be at home in both conditions with the right pair of socks man I could wear them all day like just walk in them all day sit in them all day I love him I never you know felt like oh my god at the end of the day of wearing them I got to get him off and let my feet breathe never happened never happened they're worth every dollar that you're gonna spend on them I mean most sneakers cost around $100 today - no any Nike sneakers or any name-brand like that if you amortize it over time I mean if they're basically free you know there's like I didn't buy another effectively didn't buy another pair of sort of winter bad weather boots for three decades you know and I've even pay for it in the first place my mom bought him for me as a gift
