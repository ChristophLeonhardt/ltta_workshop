all right Owen Benjamin is with a stand-up comedian after podcast host pianist a large be a big penis penis yeah I saw you do a routine it actually wasn't even a comedy routine it was actually a discussion about the n-word yeah is there a limit is there a danger that guys that people on the right when they take the red pill when they see that we're being silenced when they see that silence is in is in service to a political point of view it's not just silencing people to be right right right not to saying don't say that is a dirty word it's in service of a political point so a danger you go too far in the other direction you say yes absolutely yeah and that's why I took a lot of care to never say anything racist and I don't use that word in my life and I'll say n-word on your show because we're friends I respect you mate but when you're going after the multi-eyed it headed Hydra you gotta go for the heart and so that's the most taboo word there is and so I got fascinated by it like why it's such an archaic silly word it almost says more about the speaker of the word than the person it's it makes you sound like an ignorant person right and so I mean that brings me down the road of the rhetorical conspiracy theory of the welfare state and how we have to continuously reinforce the black people by nature our victims therefore we can Rob trillions of dollars from our people right and and I got fascinated by it and so yeah I do I don't want to be defined by the crazy people who hate me and you have a great point about going too far the other direction but that's why I made sure I never use that word in my personal life and I don't say anything racist right it's just like saying n-word I saw this this mean that blew my mind because it said if we take the n-word out of to kill a mockingbird what happens to rap lyrics and the thing that blew my mind was that they said n-word in an anti censorship meme and that was this weird manipulation because my mom teaches To Kill a Mockingbird and and and Huck fan and a lot of these things that are now being censored right they're taking words right now no I know and so I'm like what does that say that people are complying to this even in a meme about censorship so I just went for it cuz his George Collins has a political correctness as fascism disguised as politeness that's right
