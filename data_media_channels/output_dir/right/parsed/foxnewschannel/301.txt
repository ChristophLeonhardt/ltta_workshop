WE'RE UP ON THE THE ON MEZZANINE
LEVEL.
THE DOCTOR MAKING A HOUSE CALL,
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.
HE HAS A BRAND NEW BOOK, WHY WE
FIGHT.
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION AND
CEREMONIAL SWEARING-IN LAST
NIGHT.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE TONE OF
THE PRESIDENT AND MR. KAVANAUGH.
>> I'M GRATEFUL WHAT THE
PRESIDENT HAD DONE.
A GOOD MAN A GODLY MAN, WAS
IMPUNED AND PRESIDENT DECLARED
HIM INNOCENT.
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
AINSLEY: IS IT WORTH THE FIGHT?
WE'RE SEEING HOW REPUBLICANS ARE
BEING TREATED.
YOU CAN'T GO TO A RESTAURANT
ANYMORE.
THEY'RE PUTTING OUT YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOUR
ADDRESSES, SENDING --
BRIAN: DOXXING.
>> ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT.
1776 WAS WORTH IT.
THIS IS WORTH IT.
IN MY BOOK WHY WE FIGHT, I TALK
ABOUT THE FACT THIS ISN'T THE
FIRST TIME THEY HAVE DONE IT.
PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED WHAT THE
DEMOCRATS DID, THE DIRTY TRICKS,
THE LIES, GUESS WHAT THEY HAVE
BEEN DOING THIS FOR DECADES.
A MAN WHITAKER CHAMBERS, 1948,
FIRST TELEVISED CONGRESSIONAL
TESTIMONY, STOOD UP TO TELL THE
TRUTH ABOUT SOVIET PENETRATION
OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
WHAT DID THE LEFT DO?
THEY ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING AN
AFFAIR, BEING A HOME SEXUAL,
BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS
BROTHER'S DEATH.
ALL OF IT LIES.
THAT IS 1948.
THAT IS YEARS BEFORE JUSTICE
KAVANAUGH WAS EVEN BORN.
THIS IS PATTERN.
WE'VE ALWAYS GOT TO RESIST THE
LIES.
BRIAN: HERE IS MOSTEL LAST
NIGHT, LET'S LISTEN.
>> THE THING ABOUT MAKING A DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL THE DEVIL BACKS
UP HIS BARGAIN, ALL RIGHT?
THE DEVIL DOES NOT WELCH.
TRUMP HAS DELIVERED FOR THESE
PEOPLE ON THE THINGS THAT THEY
CARE ABOUT MOST.
HE HAS DELIVERED RACISM FOR
THESE PEOPLE.
HE HAS DELIVERED MISOGYNY FOR
THESE PEOPLE AND NOW HE HAS
DELIVERED THE SUPREME COURT FOR
THESE PEOPLE, WHICH IS SOMETHING
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET FOR
A GENERATION.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF THIS
RATHER THAN THEY HAVE CONTROL
OVER ALL THREE BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT, WE'LL SEE IF THIS
REIGN LASTS FOR 30 DAYS, OR TWO
YEARS, OR 1000 YEAR REICH.
BRIAN: IS THAT THE VIEW YOU HAVE
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION?
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS PERSON
IS.
WE'RE USED TO THE CRAZIES BUT
THE THAT IS AN INSULT.
THAT IS AN INSULT TO PEOPLE OF
MY PARENTS WHO LIVED UNDER NAZI
OCCUPATION, MY PARENTS WITH
CHILDREN, WHERE NAZIS TOOK OVER
HUNGARY.
THAT IS INSULT TO 10 MILLION
PLUS AMERICANS WHO WERE FIs
WHO FOUGHT FACISM, MANY OF WHOM
DIED.
THAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE.
BRIAN: A FASCIST COUNTRY
WOULDN'T LET HIM SAY THAT.
>> IF DONALD TRUMP WERE THE
GREAT DICTATOR THEY PAINT HIM TO
BE THIS PERSON WOULD BE LOCKED
UP.
BRIAN: 90% FOR HIM INSTEAD OF
90% AGAINST HIM.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BRIAN.
AINSLEY: HOW DANGEROUS IS THAT
RHETORIC?
>> ONLY ONE PARTY NORMALIZED
VIOLENCE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS
AND IT IS NOT REPUBLICANS.
JAMES HODGKINS DID NOT WEAR A
MAGA HAT WHEN HE WENT TO THE
BASEBALL FIELD IN ARLINGTON.
HE WAS A BEN BERNANKE SUPPORTER,
WITH A RIFLE AND HIT LIST OF
WHAT, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, HE
ALMOST KILLED ONE OF THEM, STEVE
SCALISE.
LOOK AT VIOLENCE OF ANTIFA, GO
PREPARED FOR BATTLE TO THOSE
DEMONSTRATIONS.
THE RIGHT DOWN DO THAT YOU'RE
NORMALIZING SOMETHING THAT IS
UN-AMERICAN.
STEVE: TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
YOUR BOOK, "WHY WE FIGHT,
DEFEATING AMERICAN ENEMIES WITH
NO APOLOGIES."
YOU START WITH SUN ZHUO.
>> AND KALVITZ.
ON WAR.
IF YOU KNOW THOSE TWO PEOPLE YOU
CAN DEFEAT ANY ENEMY AND
PRESIDENT HAS AN INSTINCT FOR
THIS STUFF.
SO SUN ZHOU, USE POWER, STRENGTH
OF YOUR ENEMY AGAINST THEM.
NOTHING CHANGED IN WARFARE OR
POLITICS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
STEVE: DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS
THE ENEMY?
>> HE UNDERSTANDS.
LOOK WHAT HE HAS DONE.
HE MAKES A STATEMENT, PEOPLE GO
CRAZY, ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT.
WHAT HAPPENS?
A FEW WEEKS LATER A FEW MONTHS
LATER TURNS OUT TO BE WHAT,
TRUE?
THEY WIRETAPPED MY CAMPAIGN.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
WIRETAPPED YOUR CAMPAIGN.
WE FIND OUT.
FISA WARRANT ILLEGALLY ISSUED
WITH EXCULPATORY INFORMATION
KEPT FROM THE DOCKET.
WE HAVE THE WHOLE HOUSE OF CARDS
COLLAPSING.
I HAVE RARELY MET A MAN
INSTINCTUALLY STRATEGIC AS
DONALD TRUMP.
TALKING ABOUT ISIS.
WHO IS TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA
INVADING NEIGHBORS?
NOBODY SINCE DONALD TRUMP BECAME
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
BRIAN: IN THE CROSS-HAIRS CHINA.
>> CHINA IS NUMBER ONE.
IN MY BOOK I TALK ABOUT ALL THE
THREATS AND TALK ABOUT JIHADIS,
TALK ABOUT RUSSIA.
THERE IS ONLY ONE STRATEGIC ONE
AND IT IS BEIJING BECAUSE THEY
WANT TO REPLACE AMERICA AND THEY
