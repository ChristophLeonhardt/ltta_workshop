00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,960
I'm doing what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy doing it's like</font>

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,120
other men like to play golf<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they play</font>

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,369
golf every<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they can see you don't</font>

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">say to him how come you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> playing golf</font>

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> played last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> week was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,020
with me to me it is such fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> creating</font>

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,600
characters writing stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when you</font>

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,630
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fans seem</font>

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,990
to enjoy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gives you such</font>

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">satisfaction you don't want to stop</font>

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe it or not I almost never have</font>

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,558
been stuck on<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything writing comes</font>

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,290
very easily to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else in the</font>

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,500
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but writing I don't have</font>

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,070
any problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't write fast</font>

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough to keep up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with what were the</font>

17
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,540
things I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I know my father</font>

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,059
the poor guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was during the</font>

19
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">Depression and he was out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so his life was shorter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,850
it was because there was nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that could interest</font>

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,209
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think if you do what really</font>

24
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,179
excites you it just keeps you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going as</font>

25
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:08,939
long as possible

26
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

27
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,420
the fans seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives you</font>

28
00:01:16,420 --> 00:00:00,000
such satisfaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to stop</font>
