police brutality stories continue to trickle in and one story that really caught my attention luckily did not lead to the death of anyone but it did feature a police officer who's now being investigated for using excessive force on a man who seemed to be listening to him and complying with all his demands now this story takes place in Pennsylvania apparently a neighbor recorded a Lancaster police officer using a stun gun on a 27 year-old man named Sean Williams Williams had been accused of using a baseball bat to assault someone but the people interviewed at the scene said they never saw the bat and police never recovered 100 in other words he didn't yeah so look those are the details we have of why the cops were there in the first place but regardless of why the cops were there what you're about to see it shouldn t ate you because you're about to witness a man complying with the cops and then you know dealing with the kind of treatment that he did so it's difficult to watch with but with that said take a look that's it like straight out of Italy straight up straight out come on on your stomach warm sound like an airplane okay so I don't know if everyone can hear it clearly but there's a female officer who's not on camera and I keep hearing straight out and crossed she's right she said she the guy said straight out which he clearly meant now in hindsight what he could have said don't bend your knees he meant put them out and then she wanted them out and cross ice that he had them out sort of just on the ground obviously I would say unthreatening and then he crossed them in an answer to her command and that was when the other when the male cop used the Taser but look I'm gonna be honest if I were in his situation I wouldn't know exactly what the cops want and honestly I would also be terrified because you know one wrong move and you could lose your life and from other videos that we've seen so he didn't look I think the most important thing is he wasn't in any type of position that posed a threat to anyone his back was turned to that male cop he was sitting on the curb you can clearly see his arms I I feel like there was really no need to tase him at that point but the police department is standing by and of course there was no need to taste it but obviously there's no need I get it they wanted his legs spread out if your legs I'm gonna I'm guessing now but I'm presume that if your legs are bent and your and the the bottoms of your feet are on the ground you can spring up very quickly if your legs are extended out getting up is gonna take a longer time you were so that's why he was asking but then you have to say hey don't bend your knees legs straight out yell it whatever but he wanted to tase it he the second time that he said legs straight out and the guy just clearly didn't seem to get it he didn't he said aren't you gonna get tased you see him reaching and take out the taser like he was like ready so it meant the next time you don't obey me which came about with the confusing order from the female officer he went ahead and tased him it's ridiculous those guys aren't fit to be cops they should be fired they don't go to jail but they got no business having guns that was confusing I had no idea that they meant stick out your legs and cross them I mean experts at be listening to the cops wonder arrests for having a bat that we didn't have it and what they said in here is that they were using the Taser as a preventative measure yeah that's too much let me give you the statement from the Lancaster PD from Pennsylvania the statement that they gave to the press was this is done as a measure of control to ensure that if someone is going to flee or offer physical resistance they will have to move their legs under them to do so non-compliance is often a precursor to someone that is preparing to flee or fight with officers okay that's up so I'm correct I hadn't even read that yet but so if your legs are out like this you got to go like this first to get up your legs like this you can just spring straight up and that's what they're trying to avoid so make that effing clear before you use your taser yeah okay so I have a harsh review this and you guys have been harsh but not enough in my opinion so the cops now we've seen this in a lot of tapes play Simon Says with these guys and they're toying with people's lives and how the hell is he supposed to know I assume cross your legs man when she said it cross her legs like this like wouldn't you like that he was in right so they can't wait to use the Taser it would appear that I don't know that they we have this evidence we have ice guy seemed eager to use the Taser and and look you could say look there's hundreds of thousands of cops across the country so the dozens and dozens and dozens maybe hundreds of videos we've seen where the cops can't wait to use their weapons is an anomaly but and most of them don't but then all the other cops defend them so but I likey Ana said I was terrified they were gonna murder because it reminded me of the story from Mesa Arizona of the guy crawling in the hallway of the hotel room and they keep giving him confusing instructions and he's in a panic and he's tried to comply and it's super obvious he's trying to comply in that case it was a white guy and then he just murdered him he you know for following his sobbing he has the guys really not a thread not nowhere near a thread and a guy shot him and killed him right and of course got away with it oh they're just bad apples if they're bad apples why aren't they in prison right now because you protect them because you and you encouraged him to use too much violence and that's the problem with the training that I keep talking about in this case anybody watching that video if you're an honest person if you're a douche right winger you're like I get it I get it you're irredeemable right but if you're an honest person did he seem like a threat to you really like you didn't appear that he was trying to not listen to the cops or listen to the cops anybody looking at that tape looks like he's like okay I'm trying to extend my legs then she says crossing me goes to try to cross them and they tasers are hate ace ISM anyway also if that's not a threat it's not a threat and by the way this preventative measure that's that's another quote the one that Kim reference that the cops used that means hey I'm going to assault you before you do anything I'm going to prevent you doing something that you didn't yet do I'm going to taste anything before you do it I think implicit in it also your right is also I didn't shoot you it's prevented I pretended myself shooting you yeah well congratulations I didn't murder you you know look nobody would be seeing this video if that cop had acted like an ass and told him to or even kicked his leg forward right we wouldn't be doing this story like kicked out the heel the like spread it out use the phrase knees straight that's it that would have done it right that's really what you wanted but you didn't have the skills to do it so yeah of course this guy was eager to and of course those directions were confusing that seems blatantly obvious that this guy wasn't a threat and it's by the way then the other thing that is I think always relevant here is okay I suppose the attitude that the cop is gonna portray that the cop is gonna say and with the department's history backing up is that he wasn't totally in it he was being like fine you're gonna make me sit down now and they're gonna make me sit here and spread my legs I don't quite know what you mean he was not yes Tsering it to the utmost extent right he was not a one 50% complier he was at 84% and he was pissed right doesn't matter he's not a threat you don't get to win this your win is he did what you said you make sure he's not violent you if you're gonna arrest him you cuff him you put him in the car and you take him to the station and the process begins and that's it you don't get to tell you somebody because they pissed you off so there was a story that I believe we I believe it made it to the show maybe we didn't get to it because we ran at a time but there was a story about a woman in North Carolina who got arrested at a Publix at a public pool because she was harassing two boys black boys that she didn't want there she kept telling them you don't belong here and so they're kids they're two black boys one of them starts filming as she's forcing them out like following them to the exit and she assaults them on three different occasions you see the phone fall to the ground right and I guess at one point she strikes one of the kids in the face and cops are called when the cops showed up she started physically assaulting the cops apparently bit one of the cops in the ear and the cops you know arrest her she she gets her mugshot taken and everything I want everyone to be treated that way though that way right I get it she was incredibly combative she was incredibly difficult to deal with but I would not want anyone to pull a gun on her I would not want anyone to use excessive force on her arrest her booked her let the justice system deal with her Jared Ramos didn't get tased he was under the desk with a gun yeah that's the guy who did the shooting and in Baltimore just now look now let me be less harsh it's not the particular cop and and a lot of people disagree with me when I say that but they train them to be overwhelming force don't take any risks well if you're in a shootout like in the movie heat with bunch of bank robbers with automatic weapons then use overwhelming force but if a guy is sitting down and trying to comply with the orders don't use overwhelming force but what are they trained them to do unless it's a rich white woman make sure that you beat the crap out of them or take we'll shoot him don't take any chances because your life is more important than their life and also and they're protected you know I mean this needs to be again as always a change in the law because we the issue isn't so much the DA's won't prosecute because we see what happens frequently when DA's prosecute they get acquitted because the laws are written in such a way where if you go my life was threatened and the law says if the cop feels like his life was threatened well then then lethal force is okay so if that law has changed to where that is no longer the only defense well then we'd have a different set of circumstances and I am you know probably I don't know whether I'm different than anybody else on this panel right I am enormous ly sympathetic to police officers in general it is an unbelievably stressful and difficult job and it's why they ought to get paid more and they ought to get trained better and and as a result when good cops of which there are many see this to Jenks point earlier they ought to say that guys a bad police officer that God makes my job harder instead what do they do and so this injustice to this guy has already happened okay but the injustice continues they arrested him well because they want to go investigate the guy swinging the bat and hitting people that's a really serious crime so I'm glad ou know they didn't arrest him on that cuz there was no bad they arrested him for public drunkenness you know what that is cover my ass I hate them he was the wrong guy and he wasn't doing anything wrong but I'll add insult to injury literally in this case by arresting him for public drunkenness so that I'm not embarrassed by the way that to me makes it worse this guy is drunk yeah and you know he's drunk well then he's gonna have a difficult time following his demands and it also means he's less likely to be a threat to me and let me ask you guys no matter who you are again sometimes I talk to the right wing because they I don't know if anything ever gets through their head but have you ever been drunk in public I have um I guess as all of you have drunk right now and and seriously and when you're going to bars you're going to clubs to say you've been drunk in public you think it's okay for a cop to go okay Simon Says this Simon Says that you didn't follow a tase tase tase right no and then you think that they charge them because they were really concerned afterwards that he was intoxicated no you know what everybody knows that they did it to cover their ass yeah what's a bigger crime here chasing that guy are being drunk in public come on I mean a lot of people unfortunately in the country would say being drunk in public well here's why knowing full well that they themselves have been drunk in public numerous times and that's that that's the unfortunate thing it's it's the lack of empathy the the lack of understanding and and I just wish people would put themselves in that person's shoes and understand what it's like to go through something like that and and not know clearly what the cops want you to do and then be met with that kind of you know physical force hey am more training better it's a frustrating story I feel like I could I could use a shot of a little dog trying to give CPR to one yes you do we have a video of a dog that would help I just that's a random thing to ask for there you guys go again with the dog the situation poncho he's not that good that'll never work he's not that good I feel like Jake and I are cat people I'm a person person I'm a well-known humanist I turn my phone of you holding a kitten
