1
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:04,855
Certain things spring to mind when you think
of prison.

2
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:05,855
Barbed wire.

3
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:07,285
Tiny jail cells.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,660
Bars everywhere.

5
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:11,583
Well not in Norway.

6
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:16,897
This is Halden prison, and it's the second-largest
maximum security prison in Norway.

7
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,916
And it looks more like a resort than anything else.

8
00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:24,498
But at 20%, Norway's recidivism rate is
the lowest in Scandinavia, 

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,536
and one of the lowest in the world.

10
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:32,101
This is how Norway changed how we think about
incarceration.

11
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:37,803
While Norway's 2 year recidivism rate is
the lowest in the world, America's is one

12
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,211
of the highest.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:47,116
A 2014 study found 67 percent of American
prisoners released in 30 states were re-arrested

14
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:52,396
for a crime within three years, and 75% were re-arrested
within five years

15
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:57,637
While it is tough to make direct comparisons,
Norway is doing something right when it comes

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,706
to incarceration, and it may come down to
a fundamental difference in philosophy of

17
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:04,167
what a prison should be.

18
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,596
Norway banned capital punishment in 1905.

19
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:11,363
80 years later, they did away with life sentences.

20
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:18,016
And in 2007, a shift in thought: A focus on
"restorative justice", emphasizing rehabilitation

21
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,417
and normality, over punishment.

22
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,959
What this means is when a prisoner is sentenced
in Norway, the only thing they lose--

23
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,337
is their freedom.

24
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:28,938
Which is symbolized by these large prison walls.

25
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:35,516
Norway has two of what have been called "The
Most Humane Prisons In The World":

26
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:41,673
One of them is Halden Prison, where prisoners
can garden, learn to cook, and tend to animals.

27
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:45,887
They can also take vocational classes to prepare
themselves for the outside world after they

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,070
are released.

29
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,850
Halden holds 251 of its worst criminals, which
includes rapists, murderers, and pedophiles.

30
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:58,644
In America, these criminals would be punished
severely, kept in a small cell for most of

31
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:02,534
the day with minimal time outdoors with all
of their rights stripped.

32
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:06,696
The phrase "Don't do the crime if you
can't do the time" applies here.

33
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:13,906
"Retribution must be swift and sure for those who decide to make a 
career of preying on the innocent."

34
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:19,517
America's decades-long war on crime has
resulted in 159,000 people currently serving

35
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:21,091
life prison sentences.

36
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,171
But in Norway, almost all prisoners are released.

37
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,501
The maximum sentence is 21 years.

38
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:32,031
At the end of the term, 5 year increments
can be added indefinitely if it's assessed

39
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,561
that the prisoner has not been rehabilitated.

40
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:41,194
Even the worst offenders, like Anders Brievik,
who murdered 77 people in one of the worst massacres

41
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,412
in history, is currently serving a 21 year
sentence.

42
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:50,388
And Norway supports prisoners after they are
released, they are provided housing, employment,

43
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,457
health care, and addiction treatment.

44
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:55,267
All of this does not come cheap.

45
00:02:55,267 --> 00:03:01,707
Halden prison spends more than $93,000 per
inmate per year, compared with just $31,000

46
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:04,027
on average for prisoners in the United States

47
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:07,979
But Norway incarcerates far fewer of their
population.

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,179
As of 2014, just .08% of Norway's population
was behind bars.

49
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,292
That's 75 per 100,000 people.

50
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:17,753
In the U.S.,

51
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:22,191
it's 707 for every 100,000 people or .7 percent.

52
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:26,368
And if the United States had the same rate
of incarceration as Norway, it could spend

53
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:31,934
as much as Norway does per inmate and still
save more than $45 billion a year.

54
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,137
That's the budget for the Department of
Homeland Security.

55
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:42,256
No matter how many numbers are crunched on
comparing recidivism rates, or thoughts on

56
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,910
punishment versus rehabilitation, it comes
down to how society views its prisoners.

57
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:53,825
Nelson Mandela said "It is said that no
one truly knows a nation until one has been

58
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:55,260
inside its jails.

59
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,051
A nation should not be judged by how it treats
its highest citizens, but its lowest ones."

60
00:04:00,238 --> 00:00:00,000
If that's the case, Norway should be applauded
for its humanity.
