QUICKLY. LELAND: AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT A LONG, LONG WAY TO GO. GILLIAN TURNER ON THIS, THANK YOU. LIZ. A NUCLEAR CAPABLE RUSSIAN BOMBER WAS INTERCEPTED BY U.S. JETS OFF THE COAST OF ALASKA. THIS IS THE FIRST SUCH PROVOCATION SINCE LAST YEAR. GENERAL, THIS CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION NOT BECAUSE WE SAW THIS ALMOST A YEAR AGO TO DAY AND ALMOST COMES ON AN ANNIVERSARY. TO PUT THIS IN A STRATEGIC TIME FRAME. WE'RE COMING TO BIG POWER ONCE AGAIN, BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA AND UNITED STATES AND CHINA AS WE LEARNED FROM THE COLD WAR, THESE ARE TESTS OF WILLS. WHAT THE RUSSIANS ARE DOING, PENETRATING OUR ZONE AND TESTING OUR RESPONSES AND WE GET TO PRACTICE HERE. THE LESS WE MAKE ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF FANFARE, THE BETTER IT IS. IT'S KIND OF ROUTINE, THEY HARASS OUR SHIPS AND AIRPLANES, USUALLY WHERE THEY'RE FORWARD DEPLOYED, MAINLY TO INTIMIDATE OUR ALLIES, BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE A THING THAT IS GOING TO BE ROUTINE, AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO REACT NORMALLY DO IT, AND TRY TO KEEP THE LID ON IT AND DON'T GIVE THEM ANY MORE PUBLICITY THAN WHAT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE. ELIZABETH: SPEAKING OF PUBLICITY, WE SAW HEADLINES INVOLVING IRAN AND ISRAEL, TWO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY KNOW A DIRECT WAR WOULD BE ULTIMATELY DESTRUCTIVE SO THEY OBVIOUSLY TRY TO MAKE IT SORT OF A PROXY WAR WHICH WE'RE SEEING IN SYRIA. WHAT IS IRAN'S END GOAL IN SYRIA? IS IT THE PROXIMITY TO ISRAEL, INTIMIDATE THEM AND GET CLOSER TO THEM? AND HOW SHOULD ISRAEL BE RESPONDING, AS THEY ARE? WHEN IRAN LOOKS AT IT, THEY WANT STRATEGIC DEPTH AND ALL THE DEPTH THEY WANT IS WEST BECAUSE THAT'S LARGELY WHERE THEIR ADVERSARIES ARE, THE SUNNIS, AND THEY WANT A CANVASS THROUGH. AND THEY WANT TO DRIVE THE U.S. OUT OF THE REGION AND TRYING TO KILL US AND BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THAT, BUT WE HAVEN'T LEFT THE REGION. THEY SEE SYRIA AS THEIR STRATEGIC ANCHOR POINT BECAUSE FROM THERE THEY CAN DO SO MANY THINGS. ONE IS ISRAEL AND TWO ALSO THE ARAB STATES. THEY'VE BEEN CONDUCTING A SIGNIFICANT MILITARY BUILDUP IN SOUTHERN SYRIA SINCE THEY PROPPED UP THE REGIME AND MOTIVATED THE RUSHES MOTIVATED THE RUSHE MOTIVATED THE RUSSI MOTIVATED THE RUSSIAN MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS T MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS TO MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS TO C MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS TO COM MOTIVATED THE RUSSIANS TO COME AND JOIN THEM AND THAT'S BEEN ONGOING, AND PRESIDENT NETANYAHU SAYS I'VE GOT A RED LINE HERE. NO IRANIAN TROOPS OR PROXIES CLOSE TO MY BORDER. IF THAT HAPPENS I'M GOING TO ATTACK THEM. MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAY ENDANGER OR ENCOACH ON ISRAEL SOVEREIGNTY. SO SOLNANI, HE DOESN'T REPORT TO THE GUARD CORPS, HE REPORTS TO THE AYATOLLAH, THE SUPREME LEADER. THINK OF HIM LIKE A CIA AND SPECIAL OPS TOGETHER, ALL THE TERRORISM GOES AROUND THE WORLD, HE'S IN CHARGE OF IT. ALL THE PROXIES, WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING, HE DIRECTS IT. HE WAS DIRECTED THE ROCKET IN GOLAN HEIGHTS. THE ISRAELIS RESPONDED WITH A NOT A PROPORTIONED ATTACK LIKE WE DID OVER THE CHEMICAL ATTACK. THEY TOOK CAPABILITY FROM THEM. THEY HIT MOST OF THE IRANIAN THEY HIT MOST OF THE IRANIA THEY HIT MOST OF THE EYANIA THEY HIT MOST OF THE EYE IA THEY HIT MOST OF THE EYE RA THEY HIT MOST OF THE EYE RIN INFRASTRUCTURE IN SYRIA. THAT'S THE MOST SINCE YOM KIPPUR WAR IN 1973. HE SENT A MESSAGE, THERE'S A RED LINE HERE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO TOLERATE THIS. ELIZABETH: AND IRAN, THIS IS THE SAME WEEK WE'RE LEARNING THAT THE U.S. IS PULLING OUT OF THE IRAN AGREEMENT. I'M CURIOUS WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE? THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THEY WANT TO DESTROY THE STATE OF ISRAEL FOR SURE. ELIZABETH: RIGHT. THAT'S A STRATEGIC GOAL VERY DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN. WHAT THEIR MORE IMMEDIATE OPERATIONAL GOAL, THE IRANIANS KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPON SOMETIME AND I THINK IT'S LESS LIKELY NOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN POWER. AND THEY KNOW THE COUNTRY THAT'S GOING TO COME FIRST TO THEM WHEN THEY DEVELOP THAT NUCLEAR WEAPON IS ISRAEL. THEY WANT TO BE RIGHT THERE, AT ISRAEL WITH THOUSANDS OF ROCKETS THAT THEY CAN ENCROACH AND FIRE INTO TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM TO DISCOURAGE THE ISRAELIS FROM EVER DOING THAT ATTACK. THEY'VE GOT 130,000 ROCKETS IN LEBANON RIGHT NOW THAT ALL CAN REACH TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM. THEY WANT TO DO THE SAME KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE 45 MILE BORDER INTO SYRIA, WHICH WOULD OVERWHELM THE OPERATIONAL SYSTEM AND NETANYAHU IS ONTO IT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL LEAD TO WAR WITH IRAN BECAUSE IRAN DOES NOT WANT TO FIGHT A CONVENTIONAL WAR AGAINST ISRAEL WHICH THEY WOULD LOSE. GENERAL JACK KEANE, THANK YOU,
