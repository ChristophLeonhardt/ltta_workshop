I am wearing my Dodgers shirt today because I am dubiously proud of California or at least a little piece of it oh my goodness do I dare get excited I thought California was a lost cause I hear people say all the time turn California red make California great again and I always think to myself you guys have got to be high because they've got some of that legal California herb and there is no chance in heck that that is going to happen but another town in California is giving the big fat middle finger to sanctuary city and state policies by suing the state of California Huntington Beach City Council voted 6 to 1 to sue the state of California over SB 54 the Senate bill that would protect undocumented immigrants by limiting the cooperation between local police and ice agents and I've got a few clips of the city council meeting meeting where congressman Dana Rohrabacher of CA 48 is cheered on by citizens in the council hall so let's check those out now y'all can you imagine if this opened Pandora's box you guys remember my video a few weeks ago about Los Alamitos I called them the little town that could they were the first city in California that voted to exempt themselves from sanctuary state policies and now we have the first City suing the state of California for the same reason maybe that small but mighty Los Alamitos town was the impetus for many other towns in California to buck the trend because I don't know strength in numbers right maybe these cities are finally starting to feel like the environment is right they are not alone and there are many many people in California who are fed up with sanctuary city policies let me just tell you a few of the ways these policies affect us here in this state first of all as everyone knows being a blue state we pay some of the highest taxes in the country and of course one of the main ways it affects us take a trip up to Northern California and see the candles and flowers that are still there as a memorial for Kate Steinle I already gave you some statistics in the last video pertaining to illegal immigration as a whole but I've gathered a few more statistics pertaining to illegal immigrants who are detained and then released that catch and release policy that Trump is trying to get rid of okay so of 8,000 145 undocumented immigrants released from detention requests between January 2014 in August 63% had previous criminal convictions or were marked a public safety concern 36% had felony charges or convictions 23% had misdemeanor convictions or charges related to violence assault sexual abuse weapons or drug distribution and roughly 3% had three or more misdemeanor convictions so I hope that this will be a growing trend here in California we literally can't afford to keep taking care of illegal aliens period but we especially shouldn't be taking care of them instead of things that American citizens and legal immigrants need take care of our veterans that should be the first thing off the bat thanks are freaking roads I just drove to LAX today and dodged a pothole a foot deep I'm not kidding fix our damn Airport lax looks like a homeless encampment and clean up our beaches people don't even want to come here anymore Hollywood looks like a giant dumpster and our beaches you have to worry about your stuff getting stolen or stepping on a freaking needle and getting Hep C or AIDS which just a little side note if you knowingly expose someone to AIDS here in California it's no longer a big deal thanks governor Moonbeam for that yeah it's just a misdemeanor now comparable to say I don't know petty theft or speeding yeah that's the same so many problems here in California but maybe just maybe my fellow Californians are fed up as well I know I am go Dodgers thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebels if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us over here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
