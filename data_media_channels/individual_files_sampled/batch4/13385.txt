just one day after a suspicious package was found at George Soros's Westchester home another suspicious package was intercepted on its way to the clintons Westchester home another suspicious package sent to Barack Obama Eric Holder John Brennan at CNN for some reason even though he doesn't work there lots of suspicious packages we will analyze what it means who it's likely from is it a lunatic or is it a dirty trick this is very close to the midterm elections the timing is curious then Democrats have finally settled on a pre midterm election message this one is really innovative really

knives onto bombs we have to talk about these many suspicious packages sent around it was discovered that they did have explosive material in them pretty rudimentary not very sophisticated nevertheless I think the one that was sent to George Soros's house was detonated nobody was hurt nobody's been hurt which is why I'm allowed to joke about this and I'm very pleased that I can if someone had been hurt it would be such a downer one it would be a very bad thing we don't want to have acts of domestic terrorism in our country well beyond the acts of domestic terror perpetrated by an Tifa and the left you know elected Democrats telling people to go to Republicans homes harass them where their children sleep that kind of thing we don't want anymore acts of civil unrest or political violence in America the timing here is really really weird where what are we 13 days away from the midterm elections for the last two weeks and news cycles have had the headlines Democrats mob violence now all of a sudden all of these attacks come out I'm not take off your tinfoil hats I'm not saying that this is some grand conspiracy I'm not saying George Soros sent bombs to himself or anything like that I'm just saying but timing is pretty weird there are a lot of weird political dirty tricks on both sides of the aisle that happened that happened as we approach elections and so I want to know who this is who this guy is who sent it what the motivations were I don't think we should jump to any conclusions whatsoever this is what happens we did a whole episode the other day on how when people in politics get angry people in politics go mad and when people in politics go mad they get stupid don't get stupid don't get passionate stay cool stay removed I got to tell you President Trump in the White House and vice president Pence or handling this perfectly I'll show you this clip then we can compare it to how the Democrats have reacted to other acts of political violence in the United States take it away President Trump the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources or expense in this effort and I just want to tell you in these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America exactly right this is exactly the right response compare that to what we've heard over the last two weeks from Maxine Waters Maxine Waters a little earlier than that Hillary Clinton Eric Holder who says when Republicans go low kicked them Hillary Clinton who says you can't be civil who called half the country deplorable and irredeemable Maxine Waters who explicitly said go out there harass conservatives where they are in the street where they sleep additionally where they sleep you had Cory Booker saying get up in the faces of congressmen this was the right response from President Trump and it stands in stark contrast to how Democrats have been reacting to political violence that we know is motivated as political and partisan motivations so what do we make of this this is pretty weird I actually lived I grew up right down the road from where George Soros lives and where the Clintons are I didn't know at the time that Hillary was my fourth cousin twice removed so I never had to sit for any Thanksgiving dinners with her niryabi lady too so what what can we make of this we before we try to analyze the motivations let's try to analyze what the effect of this is what this looks like from the outside perspective let's assume that the person sending the bombs is rational which is a bizarre you know that's a tough assumption to make you could just be a total lunatic very likely is but let's say the person is rational what is the effect of sending the bombs you've got a midterm elections that were supposed to be a blue wave where the polls have turned all in the direction of Republicans and conservatives in recent weeks you've got headlines for the last two weeks all about Democrat political violence you're now 13 days away in what way if this were sent by a conservative in what way would this help conservatives all would do is turn the momentum it possibly turned the momentum back against conservatives and Republicans in favor of the left all it would do is undercut what we've seen for weeks and weeks and even longer than that if you go back to the election of Donald Trump of political violence from the left so as a matter of politics this sort of stunt would only benefit Democrats and left wingers and would only harm conservatives and Republicans if this person is rationally motivated why now why would they send these rudimentary bombs now wouldn't they send them I don't know after Hillary Clinton I don't know after Maxine what this is a better example Maxine Waters actually called for political violence that Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder they can kind of walk a line and say oh no we didn't quite do it wouldn't they have sent if they were motivated because of the calls for violence from the left wouldn't they have sent them weeks ago months ago it seems like they would have if they were motivated to advance a political agenda wouldn't they have sent them when there was a an actual political agenda on the line when there actually were the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh for instance when it looked like Kavanaugh was going to get railroaded in his confirmation process wouldn't they send it when it looked like conservatives were losing when it looked like there was something really to gain from it so I they don't gain anything in that regard so Lent then let's examine the other one which is that it's not a dirty trick it's not some rational actor it's a lunatic which seems to make a fair amount of sense we know that one of these packages was sent to John Brennan former CIA director former communist voter he voted for Gus Hall in the 1970s a awful leftist who has been pitiless and absurd and hysterical in his condemnation of President Trump and the Republicans he was a political hack he should never have gotten the job under Barack Obama in the first place now he's made himself into a Twitter celebrity attacking the president okay they sent the package to him care of CNN but John Brennan works at MSNBC he's an MSNBC contributor so I don't understand Ark in favor of the person is a total lunatic the return address with Debbie wasserman-schultz so they're trying to make clear all of these packages going out within a couple days of each other the return address the person who is sending this is clearly trying to make it apparent to everybody that this is aimed at Democrats debbie Wasserman Schultz was the former head of the Democrat National Committee now interestingly Debbie wasserman-schultz was also the head of the DNC when the primary election was unfair to Bernie Sanders and was favorable to Hillary Clinton okay a lot of these are Obama holdovers obviously the Clintons debbie Wasserman Schultz okay I don't see a political motive for a right-winger so I predict if it if it is a right-winger it is a true Looney tune I mean you you will see tinfoil hats and wacky behavior even wackier and less less explainable than engaging in political violence could it be a dirty trick yeah anything's possible anything's possible I'm not saying it is I'm not saying that's likely that it is what I'm saying is reserve your judgment until we find out who this person is that there is clearly a political motivation if this person is rational there is clearly convenient timing here if this person is rational reserve your judgment until we find out what happens president Trump said it very well he said we have got to bring this person to justice we got to find out who it is bring them to justice there's no place for this in American politics that's true regardless of their political motivations that's true regardless of their ideological affiliation just wait and see I we one should always urge caution and these kinds of things because especially right before elections they are they are often designed to elicit an emotional response don't give it to them don't fall into that trap okay regardless of who sent the bombs and what the bombs mean and what the bombs really are president Trump yesterday he extolled the virtues of nationalism over globalism and this is elicited a obviously a violent response from the left but it is elicited a violent rhetoric as well now he said I am a nationalist I think this was the first time he's talked about nationalism a lot but he said it's so explicitly he made a point that this is the thesis I am a nationalist and what does that mean you know we had your impose on you as that great book out the virtue of nationalism and nationalism is pitted against globalism nationalism saying that the world order the Westphalian system the nation-states that we have are the best system to preserve liberty freedom and prosperity maybe it's not this the most peaceful sometimes nations go to war with each other but it preserves Liberty as opposed to globalism in which people and their communities and their states in their countries cede their sovereignty and their freedom to super national institutions that don't have any particular allegiance to them or their families or their communities this is like the European Union we could say or the International Criminal Court that's the difference and Trump says between those two things we're not ceding our freedom we're not ceding our Liberty I am defending the American Founding and what has led us to so much peace and prosperity and liberty and enjoyment for hundreds of years I'm defending the nation how do you think the Democrats responded how do you think Democrats and CNN respond to this here is Democrat congressman Gregory Meeks interpreting the real meaning of this statement in just one second before we get to that I've got to make a little more money honey how's that for a cliffhanger mm-hmm we got to think candid kind what your think you're looking at me you're saying Michael you don't have many virtues you're not a great adonis of a man fair enough I grant that but look at these teeth look at these two you look at he's shot he's pearly white teeth I have got to thank candid Co you do not need to go through the hassle or long-term treatment of wire braces when I was a kid I looked you know awful because I had these metal braces on and they're very awkward you don't have to go through that there are now new services

and awful you're not gonna be doing very well when you try to meet the honey of your life go there right now candid code comm / co if fe co v f EF n straighten out those teeth come on man first impressions are everything okay so how did the democrats and CNN respond that you know in they're typically stayed normal way this is how they responded to Donald Trump saying a very basic thing something that all of our founders and framers would say something that all normal people in the history of the United States would say I support the American nation I don't want to give our freedom away to extra super national organizations here's the reaction my balance is a person that wants to hope to do well frankly not caring about our country so much and you know what we can't have that you know have a word it sort of became old-fashioned it's called a nationalist and I say really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I am I'm an okay alright so what's your reaction to that congressman my first reactant that to that is they said of them to a nationalist is as children and that apparently is what this president is and to say that we are better than or you know it reminds me of the kinds of words that came from people like Hitler who thought that in Germany he was a nationalism so just to begin that isn't true I thought President Trump said it very well in that speech what Gregory Meeks said is not true nationalism and chauvinism are not synonyms so we've heard of chauvinism you hear of male chauvinism or this show it's kind of boastful prideful being braggart about your country or your community when it comes it comes from this probably apocryphal French soldier nicholas java and he's an apocryphal probably apocryphal french soldier in Napoleon's army that isn't nationalism nationalism says we protect the country we defend the interests of a country we extol the virtues of free nation states that we can interact with if we're talking about Chauvin we're actually talking about the opposite of nationalism you're talking about imperialism you're talking about globalism you're talking about armies that try to go out through the rest of the world take over other places conquer other places that isn't nationalism and people bandy these terms about they'd I guarantee you Gregory Meeks has no idea where the word chauvinism comes from but that's what it comes from also show the reason I say this soldier Siobhan was probably apocryphal is that we have no record that he existed and hid tales of his and the use of the word chauvinism was used by critics of Napoleon used by critics of Bonaparte ISM so even that it's it's a term that was invented in derision it's a term that was invented to be used as an attack you know that the left accuses the right of anti-intellectualism all the time the right is so much more intellectual than the left or skeptical of experts were skeptical of into Jules but if you're gonna use a word I do find the people on the right you know what it means of course they do they use language appropriately they use language to mean what it means on the left they use these slogans all the time that's why they have political correctness is to use terms that don't have real meanings or that have perverse meanings or that have meanings that orange what they purport to be I always I want to take the opportunity to point this out whenever I can the right is far more intellectual than the left how many public policy think tanks are there on the left the left has the university is finally able to they have taken over the educational system but how many think tanks dedicated to public policy do they have like to maybe Brookings is kind of left I don't know two or three how many are on the right about a zillion you've got heritage you've got a EEI you've got Cato you've got the Hudson you've got all of these institutions of public policy because the right actually is better about this we just don't go boasting about it all the time we're not chauvinists about it all the time to use their word this reminds me I was talking to John Fugelsang the actor and comedian at Politico and talked about him a little bit yesterday but he we were arguing about the Bible on Twitter and he thought he got a slam dunk he said you haven't read this passage of numbers to prove that abortion is great and God approves of abortion they sent me the passage I looked at it and I realized one of the words was mistranslated the word for miscarry the word that he thought meant abortion was just mistranslated so I just googled all different translations of it every other translation was different it didn't use that where was just one poor translation he this is the left there so intellectually pompous but they don't have a lot backing them up they don't have a lot of support and I think this is why the the right is so much better at trolling them you know comedy requires wit it you have to have a quick wit to do it and a president Trump totally trolled Barack Obama the other day it's because the right is is harder better faster stronger you know to quote Kanye this probably why Kanye likes us that's why he's got all that dragon energy flowing through them they're just a little bit quicker and president Trump use this dragon energy pretty hard on the immigration an issue he tweeted out of video of Barack Obama with the caption that said I agree with President Obama 100% here's the video of Obama we are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country who is that man could somebody tell me who that man is and why he's wearing Barack Obama's face as a mask why he really does a good impression of his voice - how could you man that was Barack Obama I think from 2005 back before Democrats had completely given way to the extreme fringes of their party by whom they are now held hostage so you had obviously illegal immigration is illegal it's not that complicated Democrats realized that they had to veer hard to the left they got angry they got mad they got stupid now they're held hostage by this lawless base and it's true of course I agree with Barack Obama there - Barack Obama agrees with Donald Trump there I was waiting for Barack Obama to go on and say that's why we need to renegotiate NAFTA that's why we got to pull out of the Paris climate Accord that's why we have to make America great again make America great again folks got to do it okay we're getting totally killed over here you know China China's totally killing us I don't know good I could go on for hours illegal immigration is a winning issue and among the vast majority of Americans including Democrats the Democrats made a huge miscalculation when they allowed themselves to be become dependent on and hostage to that extreme lawless fringe of their party this is why President Trump is running so hard on it illegal immigration is a violation it is a violation of our borders is a violation of our laws in our country and our sovereignty and our freedom and our votes it is a total violation it's why people of both parties react so strongly to it it's why Trump is right to run so hard on this and just before the midterms again we were talking about dirty tricks when we were talking about those suspicious bomb packages there is a gigantic caravan of illegal aliens crossing up through Latin America that is a do to arrive on our border I don't know the morning of Election Day I mean the timing is almost perfect what is this care of me what is this Caravan who's behind it this is certainly a ploy by the left we know who helped to organize it it's leftist institutions and leftist politicians but it actually sort of plays to both the extreme fringes of the Democrats who now run that party and to the right plays more to the right because we've got more people who care about it on that side but we know that this caravan which is now up to something like 14 or 15 thousand people started out as just a couple hundred people in Honduras was was begun by this Honduran ex politician and radio host he's the host of this show called Without Borders and the organization that has been pushing these caravans for a long time there was way blow sinfronteras people Without Borders as this radical leftist Honduran politician Bartolo twenties so this guy Bartolo Fuentes is involved in this he's trying to push people up and push illegal aliens into the country then a news report in Latin America said that Bartolo Fuentes was going to pay for all of the provisions to get up to the United States gonna pay for everything so you know to hire one of these Coyotes to hire one of these awful human traffickers to get people into the country that can cost $7,000 $10,000 these people don't have that kind of money so youyou see a lot of both ambitious and desperate people joining into the caravan to try to make it in without having to shell out ten grand and do whatever unspeakable acts they would have to do if they couldn't come up with that money so now you've got fourteen thousand people descending on the border the president has to turn them away and there's an there's an easy way to do this at every single debate from now until Election Day every single campaign event at every meeting at every opportunity Republicans should ask Democrats if they believe that all of those 14,000 people should just enter the country should just be allowed to come in should we open our doors and let them in because it push it but it's a wedge issue the Democrats are gonna there's a wedge between the radical fringe that holds their party hostage and the demographics that they require to vote for them to get elected there is a major wedge here they should hit it every single time because there are a lot of people in this Caravan that we don't want to get here there was a there was a report that terrorists Islamic terrorists are now using the caravan as an opportunity to come in and try to infiltrate the country do we know who these people are do we have hard proof of this of course not that's the problem that's the problem with illegal immigration if we had proof of who these people work they would be arrested or worse but we don't because lawlessness breeds chaos and it breeds a lot of bad outcomes by the way the people who are in this Caravan the people who are around this Caravan are already admitting that there are criminals here here here is one of them saying just that everywhere okay it's criminals in here I mean it is but it's not that many I mean peace is good people here trying to get through through Mexico and then get to the United States but that doesn't mean that everybody is a criminal right well technically everybody is a criminal because they're trying to violate one of the most basic laws of the country which is you can't enter the country illegally you can't enter and stay there and live there illegally and access services and possibly vote you can't do those things that is a crime I mean that is a major crime if a person's first act when they get to the country they're dreaming of the country they want a better life i I don't even mean to mock them I get it if I lived in Honduras I'd want to come to the u.s. too but if their first act as Americans is to violate an essential American law what kind of citizens are they going to be do we we don't want those kind of people you know President Trump launched his presidential campaign he said that Latin America is sending criminals and rapists and murderers and bad people that guy's admitting it I mean that guy there who's in the caravan is admitting yes some of these people are criminals there are a lot of criminals absolutely that's the problem that's why we have to vet people that's why when when there are countries that can't adequately vet those who are coming to the United States we can't let them in you need order Americans lives are on the line and it is the purpose of the American nation it is the basic and primary responsibility to protect American people so the the caravan is chugging along President Trump should pull out all of the stops this is only a winner for him there is no downside there is no downside to this you should use it as an opportunity to build the wall he should take all of that foreign a that used to go to Honduras or Guatemala or to Mexico he should tax those remittances hard he should or cut them off completely intercept them completely use every single penny to build that wall it would be a huge political winner and clearly it's an important problem you know people used to say oh walls don't work that's obviously absurd the Pope said something to that effect the Pope guarded by a very important wall that was built by many other popes for precisely the reason that walls work oh we know that walls work very well in countries that are surrounded by people trying to constantly get in like Israel walls do work but people used to say Oh illegal immigration isn't a big problem they are it isn't happening that much it isn't affecting the economy we know it's happening now we're seeing 14,000 people descend on the country build the wall it's it's both necessary as a matter of practical domestic policy it's also necessary into foreign policy I suppose it's also politically totally advantageous no reason not to do it the other Trump troll that came out on Twitter was so good he's in the same breath he's so good at this is he tweeted out quote Republicans will totally protect people with pre-existing conditions Democrats will not vote Republican love him love that tweet why did you send that out because the one issue that Democrats have thought maybe they can try to run on other than I hate Trump and Trump is Hitler is that health care is going to be taken away if the Republicans hold the Congress and the Senate okay I don't think that's gonna work I don't think that's a big campaign issue but he should run on that heart now some people have pointed out they've said well you know he's missing the premise if we're talking about pre-existing conditions then we're not talking about insurance insurances to protect against risks not against things that we already know that we have so it has to be a separate program which is probably just part of the welfare system and yeah yes you're right you're totally right I totally agree with you the tweet that President Trump sent out is not precise it buys into a definition of insurance that we all have to go along with but which is not correct and not precise you're totally right I don't care I don't care I do not care politics is a practical science sometimes you have to use the circumstances that are at your disposal and you have to take into consideration a lot of other factors like timing like the rhetoric that your opponent is using and like the issues the core issues that people care about people don't want to lose their health insurance they don't want the government to take over their health insurance either you've got to focus on that you're totally right I hope that we can over time change the culture change our vocabulary so that people don't so the people first of all understand what insurance is because this isn't just about pre-existing conditions everybody misuses the word insurance insurance is to protect against risk and dangers insurance is not to pay for things that we know we're going to pay for and yet when you go to your annual physical I don't go to annual physicals but if I did you would use your health insurance to process that payment it's not insurance if you go every year it's not you know you're gonna do it but we misuse that anyway so I think you're totally right but politics is a practical science and speaking of politics as a practical science heidi heitkamp democrat north dakota cannot catch a break and the narrative is breaking so well for conservatives right now which is why I want to find out the story on this bomb thing but it's breaking so well we'll get to all of that but if you want to see it you've got to go to Daley wire calm I'm sorry what do you want me to do we got to make a little money honey we got to keep the lights on even in this awful fluorescent lighting in this hotel that I'm in for my speech tonight as part of the yeah they on campus store at Grand Canyon University go to daily wire.com it's ten bucks a month $100 for annual membership you get me you get the intro flavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag you get to ask questions in conversation you get another Kingdom you get to see the whole thing on Monday nonsubscribers have to wait just for the audio they got to wait until Friday go subscribe right now you got a lot of stuff get your questions and for the mailbag we will be doing that on Friday this week go to daily wire.com we'll be right back with a lot more so speaking of politics as a practical science poor Heidi Heitkamp she can't catch a break she's the one she's the Democrat senator who published a list of alleged sexual assault victims published a full-page ad in a newspaper without getting the consent of the people who suffered sexual assault and and some people who didn't support her and people who say we weren't sexually assaulted in the first place it sent her campaign plunging she'd already been nine or ten points behind she dropped to 12 points behind now I think she's 16 points behind falling apart but she won't suspend the campaign and now James O'Keefe decided to kick her well she's done I guess he took the Eric Holder advice and just dealt this brutal blow to her campaign got her campaign staffers on the record to admit that she's a liar here they are after the election just like stuff I don't like that you know James just does God's work doesn't he just goes in there and I don't know how he gets them it's because you know you get angry you get mad you get stupid and that's what's happened to Democrats here so these campaign people will just admit they'll say oh yeah when she gets in she's gonna be super liberal oh yeah she's thought you know right now I think it's Claire McCaskill Democrat running in Missouri is running a radio ad saying I'm not one of those crazy Democrats direct quote I'm not one of those crazy Democrats they have to run against their own party because they know how unpopular they are so now they obviously we all know that heidi heitkamp would be a left-winger if the democrats had control of the senate everybody knows that of course you would one because the parties have gotten much more ideologically uniform polarized from one another but uniform within the parties and because she's a left winger yeah of course she's a left-wing we all know that there's just something about seeing it though there's something about seeing these staffers come out and say oh yeah oh let me die was stalking her the other day oh she's gonna be big lefty she's going hard after trump if she gets elected right now she's lying to the voters obviously that she's lying to the voters but you know once she gets elected then then she'll be okay she's probably not gonna get elected as it stands right now sixteen points down hard to recoup that in less than two weeks but it's just it underscores how the narrative is so important seeing you know I watched that that I've watched so many awful left-wing movies over the Barack Obama one south side with you the Clarence Thomas movie where he's a monster you know and about a Nita hill who's some Saint I guess I don't know and the movies are really important because you see it now these movies lie they don't tell the truth they misrepresent the historical record that JFK movie by Oliver Stone total historical lies but you see it and the narrative sticks with you so if they can use the narrative and the culture to tell lies why can't we use the narrative in the culture to tell the truth this is what happened with the Gosnell movie you know I was written by Andrew Clavin it was a star Dean Cain Nick Searcy directed it's so Rachel did a great job performing in it and this movie comes out and it opens pretty big release nationally six fifty theaters I think did very well outperformed expectations and but there the theaters are starting to drop it slowly they don't want this movie about an abort you remember who Kermit Gosnell is probably you don't because it was never covered by the media it was and now they're trying to drop the movie from theaters Kermit Gosnell is the biggest serial killer in American history he killed countless babies unborn babies then babies that were born he would deliver babies he would play with them and then he would kill them hiki no I don't even want to get into it watch the movie it is so disgusting and psychopathic the things that this guy did he was revealed because he injured women in his office so they were finally after a while there was an investigation but a lot of people knew about it politicians covered it up and the media would not show up to the trial now they're trying to cover this up so there was this this girl Cathy Zhu who's a young political commentator she's on Twitter and all social media she tweeted this at yesterday she said yesterday I was pro-choice I believe that women should have a say and the government shouldn't be interfering with our lives today I'm pro-life today I'm pro-life after watching Gosnell and doing in-depth research I finally understand the horrors of loopholes in late term abortions please go watch Gosnell that's the point that's the point of making the movie the point is not to make money movies don't make money movies almost never make money all of Hollywood is a scam you probably already knew that but it is but the point is to change the culture and change the narrative and the Gosnell movie is clearly succeeding in that and it's pretty cool that Drew has a hand in that because he wrote the script we have got to do more of this we've got to do more of this and not just on abortion I mean this obviously that is such a basic issue that it motivates a lot of people it's a question of life and a culture of life but there are a lot of other issues too and we should be reclaiming that an era that's so important to see harsh truths we use euphemisms even the word abortion is a euphemism right it's not the abortion used to refer to miscarriages a spontaneous abortion that they say pregnancy would abort that's not really what we're talking about abortion is going in and ending a human life ending a human life that's already begun and you're going and making a decision to end it to kill it this is very important for the millennial generation this is very important for what we call the snowflake generation seeing harsh truths this is why it's so insidious to use politically correct language is it makes you so much more fragile even just you to use the term undocumented dreaming future American whatever their new jargon is instead of illegal alien I don't say illegal alien to be mean to people I say it so that we can deal in reality with what the issues are that we're talking about their illegal aliens they're not future undocumented dreaming whatever whatever's when you use that soft language those soft euphemisms you get very frail you get very easily triggered when someone speaks reality this is what happened in the 2016 election there's a new study out I sometimes worry that we make a caricature out of Millennials and the snowflakes you know that I don't want to make a caricature out of them but now we have a study to back it up out of Arizona State they interviewed a ton of students I think it was seven or eight hundred so I'm at a huge sample size but significant of all all various genders and races and socioeconomic backgrounds they found 25% of college students have been traumatized by the 2016 election they're suffering the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder they're really suffering and that's not that's not that they're just saying they are and they aren't they actually are it is manifesting in clinically high levels of stress because a Republican won the White House because that's what a republic maybe a little boorish Republican maybe a little uncommon Republic and uncommon ly successful Republican too but that's why a politician that they didn't like won a political office and they are breaking down they're having nervous breakdowns PTSD you got to toughen up kids you've got to toughen up I mean this is nobody benefits from this it is not compassionate to be soft and to treat adults like they are children that isn't compassionate at all it hurts them it hurts their ability to interact in the world it hurts their mental health their emotional well-being and certainly it harms Society this is the issue with transgenderism this is why I think it's so awful and exploitative and cynical for the left to try to push their political agenda on the backs of the very small number of people who suffer from gender confusion it's awful it's so cynical they really shouldn't do it because one it's leading to a lot more cultural confusion and it's not helping the people who suffer from this condition there's a major genital reconstructive surgeon professor Miroslav de George's avec you bitch I don't not great at my Eastern European languages but anyway professor Miroslav has pointed out that there is sex change regret on the rise he said quote those wishing the reversal of the surgery have spoken about crippling levels of depression following their transition and in some cases even contemplated suicide we know this from the numbers we really know this from the statistics the levels of anxiety and depression among transgender people people suffering from gender confusion are almost exactly the same after the surgery as they were before and then some people that can change in either direction it isn't helping people to indulge in delusions and to mutilate their bodies for them there's no evidence that it helps anybody it's it's not helpful to live in lies lies are not helpful the truth is helpful the truth can be harsh it can be painful it can hurt but the truth will set you free we've got to start speaking that way too to American Millennials they're not I know it seems sweet and nice and oh they'll grow up and all they'll grow out of it they won't grow out of it the way the way you've got to deal with it is speak harsh language and it's so awkward because just to use the transgender issue that's the hottest topic for the left to talk about 0.4% of the population they don't love it they'd love to make an issue out of it if you're talking to somebody and they use the wrong pronouns so for instance you got a guy who thinks he's a girl or very much wants to be a girl and he says I want to be referred to as she even though he is he your friend on the ledge maybe your friend on the Left calls him she and then you call him he you are it is so awkward I've been there I've been in these conversations it it's so awkward and you just want to give in because it seems nice oh the person suffers from delusions but let's it's so much easier so much it is easier it is easier but it isn't more compassionate it isn't compassionate to live in delusion and to confuse an entire group of people you've now paralyzed an entire generation who's suffering from PTSD for the most trivial of things I sure hope we don't have to storm the beaches of Normandy again because Johnny millennial is going to be quaking in the kameen he'll die he'll literally collapse on the spot if a presidential election is giving him pts he will die on the spot he will just collapse so don't do that don't die on the spot I'm gonna be talking to a lot of Millennials and post Millennials tonight when I'm at Grand Canyon University for this Yap speech it's gonna be a lot of fun we've been talking a lot about simple joys
