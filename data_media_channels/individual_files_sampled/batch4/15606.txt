much to the dismay of liberals and globalists everywhere that caravan of illegal aliens from Central America well it's not coming to the US it's stopping in Mexico City I guess president Trump's hardline on Twitter worked I also think that his ordering troops to the border worked even better the illegal alien Caravan from Central America mostly from Honduras that grew from a thousand to eleven hundred to fifteen hundred strong I was supposed to get here today or tomorrow well they decided to cut their losses and stop in Mexico City this from the Washington Post no you can imagine the Amazon own Washington Post is beside itself this might as well be an obituary I mean it the tone of this article is just so sad and you can see how happy that makes me I'm giddy I'm giddy title the migrant caravan denounced by Trump will end in Mexico City but some people vow to go on alone let's read part of this Matteo's from Aeromexico the caravan of Central American migrants no illegal aliens now migrants illegal aliens that has prompted scathing tweets from President Trump the Trump's war with Amazon and with Jeff Bezos is just glorious because their emotional need your responses in there in the way they write in the editorial style of the Washington Post since this began I mean the Washington has always been far left but the editorial style of the Washington Post since this war began really betrays how hysterical they are about this though that that has prompted scathing tweets from President Trump is expected to end its journey at the Mexican capital rather than pushing north to the US border organizers said Wednesday pushing north like this Admiral Byrd pushing through the Arctic give me a break a bunch of illegal aliens riding pickup trucks and buses pushing north like like explorers you noted sloshing through snow or trekking their way up Everest like climbing ice I mean glorify and romanticize illegal aliens a bit more Washington Post the sheer size of the group more than 1,000 people swollen by Hondurans leaving their country after a contentious presidential election we had a contentious presidential election and liberals promised to leave and go to Canada and to Mexico into Europe they didn't the Hondurans should probably follow their lead I have a better idea let's just give them our liberals they can go to Honduras and make Honduras a better place for these trekking migrants it has made the logistics of travel too difficult no Trump saying he was gonna put troops on the border and send y'all back is what made it ooh difficult this is just great but Newsweek far far left news we couldn't give Trump credit for this one here's their headline Mexico not Trump stopped caravan of immigrants heading to the u.s. I love oh it's the migrant caravan the caravan of immigrants not illegal aliens Mexico is hardly laughing experts told Newsweek research shows the country is the taining and deporting Central American immigrants in roughly the same numbers as the US often even surpassing the US is good one of the keep their own people there why don't they keep their own people there what's more and this is really a joke I mean if you want to praise Mexico Newsweek that's one thing but but don't insult our intelligence what's more Mexico continues to devote resources to breaking up drug cartels and organized crime the furor which drives many immigrants to head north for refuge okay a that's just dumb and I'm gonna explain why in a second Mexico isn't doing anything they break up the cartels it is one of the most dangerous narco states in the world there's very little they can do because the corruption is systemic and comes from the route from the neighborhoods from the villages from the towns with people to join their police forces in politics live and grow up but wait a second Mexico is doing so much the break-up part tells an organized crime Mexico is such a wonderful place now it's doing so much to keep its people from heading north but a bunch of Central Americans decided it was ok to walk through Mexico I mean do they even listen to themselves at this point though is Mexico this wonderful utopia or this horrible place where people have to run north is Mexico this this lawful society that's setting back all these Central Americans or is it this terrible lawless place where its own people want to come to the US because they're afraid of being killed for no reason on Newsweek didn't even try to hide their bias there they'd even try to make themselves sound logical and sensible Mexican officials went to great lengths to try to break up the caravan no they didn't execute officials didn't go to any lengths try to break up this Caravan Mexican officials are the ones who abandon their border checkpoints in let the caravans in Mexican officials are the ones who let it get all the way to Mexico City if Mexican officials wanted to break up this Caravan the caravan wouldn't have gotten 10 feet into Mexico let alone to Mexico City to its capital this is absolutely ridiculous and there's so much more to this story there's so much more to why this really happened so so much more and I'm gonna tell you all about why this Caravan was really stopped in Mexico City right here on the rebel on my longer show off-the-cuff Declassified a bit later today a really important content and this is content I love to bring you because it lets me debunk all the left's false narratives using their own words the police helped me keep doing it by subscribing our premium service at WWWE da /o z
