Not only is the president looking to take away
Brennan's security clearance
He's also looking into the clearances of Comey clapper Hayden rice and McCabe
These are all former top US officials President Trump says he wants their security clearances revoked
That's even though two of the officials including former FBI director James Comey. No longer have clearances
So why did he single out the group? Anyway one clue may be what they've said about him. I
think he has demonstrated time and time again that he lies the American people and that he is not fulfilling the
Responsibilities of the office of the presidency the United States used to be the defender of our European
Allies and to push back against the Russians the fact now that mr. Trump is aligning himself with mr
Putin so it's a concern he is giving aid and comfort to the enemy and it needs to stop
Oh, I have no confidence in a guy like Brett and I think he's a total lowlife
When the president tries to use the department justice is kind of a
private investigator a body that's
Not good for the country or institutions or under assault internally internally from the president exactly. Are you questioning his fitness?
Yes, I do. I have no confidence in clapper
You know clapper wrote me a beautiful letter
When I first went to office and it was really nice and then all of a sudden he's gone haywire
he has a habit of telling lies sometimes big sometimes casual and then insisting that the people around him repeat them and
believe them and that is
That stains any human is Donald Trump unfit to be President
Yes, I think he's morally unfit to be President, I think that James Comey was unfair to the people of this country
I think what he did was a disgrace. I think he goes down as the worst FBI director in history by far
There's nobody close and I think I did the country a tremendous favor by firing him
