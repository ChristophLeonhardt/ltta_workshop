young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcast of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with the in a Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio Donald Trump is facing some backlash for a series of tweets that appear to go against the Constitution and appear to solidify more of his power in the form of turning immigrants away without due process now earlier Trump had gone on a rant about judges and how he doesn't want to hire more judges in order to process undocumented immigrants who are seeking asylum in the United States but now he is further spreading that message through his social media accounts so let's get right to it he says we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country when somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came from our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order most children come without parents so let me just stop to mention how incredibly ironic it is to hear someone like Trump consistently bring up law and order he is someone who has broken the law time and time again he is the one who is facing investigations by the special counsel but that's just the tip of the iceberg I mean he has no room to talk about law and order he is the person who defrauded students with his for-profit University he is the person who has used his own charitable organization to do self-dealing don't talk to me about law and order so let me just get that out of the way but Jon he wants to essentially go against our laws our Constitution and turn immigrants away with no judges no due process no court hearing yeah it's another example of he will say something or propose something or other politicians who are attempting to appeal to the same sort of voter that to their base initially sounds okay based on their I guess some pre-existing views on the group that it's going to affect so if you say immediately send them across no judges no court cases many of his supporters who have no idea what these actual incidents actually look like they all think that it's people filing in a line across the border and somebody stops them and then will just shoo them away or something like that that's not actually how this would be done in practice in practice the Border Patrol but also ice they stop people all over the place yesterday they were asking people for citizenship papers in New England as they were driving on highways that is quite a ways from the border with Mexico but they still stopped people so under what Donald Trump is saying as you're cruising through Bridgeport Connecticut if they stop you and you don't have your papers immediately no judges no court cases Honduras I guess and that doesn't make any sense whatsoever the reason you have the court case the reason you have the judge is to find out what the person's actual legal status is that's why you have those and also it's that immediate because it takes time to determine these things he talked about a mockery of law and order and a mockery of the immigration laws the tweet the proposal that is the mockery of both of those things yeah you make a really great point I mean even in the the best case scenario for the right wing if Trump were able to implement this policy people who are US citizens would essentially deal with a system where there's no due process and and I don't think you're right they don't really think about the consequences of that you know for all the talk that you hear from the right wing about we've got to protect our constitutional rights we got to protect the second Amendment especially because that helps us protect ourselves from a tyrannical government you know for all that talk it's interesting how easily they give you know all this power to the detriment of the American people to the Trump administration and how much in the long run or even in the short run it could negatively impact them right now it's anyway okay well and also if I could try to appeal to but maybe Trump supporters I know a lot of them watch our show or at least comment on it I know that you must look at the process and say well Donald Trump is saying we we can't but hire all these extra judges and the system is too inefficient so we speed it up by getting rid of due process but I don't think that you actually deep down want that I think that you do have respect for the Constitution I don't think you like the precedent of future Democratic presidents getting to choose when we have due process and when we don't when we need judges and when we don't I don't think that you actually want that so there is a different direction that we could go in though if what we have now is a glut where you have too many people going through the criminal justice system because of their misdemeanor illegal entry what we could do is we could go back to the system we had more than three months ago where we didn't criminally prosecute every single person that came across the border instead we would identify them we would tell them they need to come back for a hearing at some point at which case at which time a judge would look at it you didn't prosecute them you didn't hold them in detention for days or weeks or months so you didn't have the strain on the justice system it was a great system it worked very well and the vast vast majority more than 90% did come back for their asylum hearings it worked just fine we could go back to that without giving up our constitutional rights and without allowing Donald Trump a guy who I think most of us suspect at this point can't be trusted with you as you said earlier on accruing more and more personal power to himself I think this is a better compromise I think it's a better compromise as well and and you know just to I guess give those on the right wing a little bit of credit they do bring up a legitimate problem and the legitimate problem is hey there is this huge increase of immigrants trying to come into the country seeking refuge seeking asylum and we simply cannot allow every single person to come to the United States and get the asylum that they're looking for that is a legitimate point but the conversation is always about what can we do to protect our borders as if all these people are immigrants that we need to be afraid criminals that we need to be afraid of in reality the conversation needs to focus on u.s. foreign policy and what we can do to change the situation helped to change the situation in these countries so gang violence doesn't overpower local authorities right and so one proposal could be hey instead of going into the Middle East starting pre-emptive Wars or intervening in other Wars why don't we use some of those resources to help empower legitimate law enforcement in these latin-american countries so they have the resources to fight these gangs now I get it it's not that simple but that is certainly a better policy that would help improve the conditions in these countries so you don't have this influx of migrants trying to enter the United States but we never get to converse say it is a hard sell because the only thing that the American government is good at selling is let's go after the terrorists terrorists in the Middle East which usually includes fighting Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen right wars that we really have no business being involved in yeah that don't benefit us at all in any way shape or form the problem unfortunately is that there's a lot of Republican politicians that I think don't have a lot of respect for conservative voters and they want them to always be in the position of trying to deal with a problem at the last possible second or even after the last possible second the same way that I was talking about in Bill Maher they had that NRA TV guy who's talking about how supportive he is of arming teachers they don't want to do anything to stop the gunman from attacking the school they will seed all of that grounds surrender everything that you could do socially governmental II familywize everything legally until they're in the hallway and then they want to know where a gun is to do something about it and in this same way they don't want to do anything to actually stop the problems that are causing all of these these needs for asylum tears they want to wait until the person crosses the border how about we solve our problems a little bit earlier than that in our personal lives that's what would it look like if you operated your life this way that you only thought about problems when they're literally punching you in the face that's true and I mean look our politicians are not in the business of solving problems they're in the business of selling band-aids and that's what happens with immigration that's what happens with health care that happens with every single issue what is the root of the problem what can we do to solve the root of the problem instead we we seek to somehow aid whatever symptoms that arise from the problem so it is problematic and by the way US domestic policy plays a role in in what happens in these latin-american countries you know the prohibition of drugs certainly empowers drug cartels through you know the funding that they get through selling these drugs in the black market we need to find a way to get the power back to the people and the local law enforcement in these latin-american countries so gangs are not essentially calling the shots causing people to flee their own homes to seek safety all right well let's hear a little bit from some legal scholars on the issue of turning migrants back without due process is it constitutional now I mentioned that it's unconstitutional but what do I know these legal scholars obviously know a lot more than me so let's hear from them Karl Tobias says the following he's a professor of law a congressional legislation and the Constitution mandate due process for the people Trump mentions Congress would need to legislate what Trump says he wants and this seems unlikely even if Congress were to pass legislation federal courts would probably find that it violates the Constitution so we do have this system of checks and balances Trump has managed to do some things unilaterally but luckily federal judges have fought back in some ways this could potentially be another way now another another lawyer with the ACLU says the following any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally also the Council on american-islamic relations says the following this clear call for an end to the constitutionally guaranteed right to due process is symptomatic of an administration that disdains both the Constitution and our judicial system such dismissal of due process would subject those who cross our borders to the whims of unaccountable officials acting on the twisted logic of white supremacy and racism now maybe some on the right wing love that notion ow but as John mentioned do you want to give the executive branch this type of power because you're not always gonna have your favorite president running the country and we want to make sure that we you know we keep our system of checks and balances in tact so you don't you know basically put too much power into one branch of government which is what's happening right now yeah yeah when the deep state finally rigs an election and Malia Obama becomes president do you want her to have this power yeah yeah exactly one of the one of the problems is just a small one that we deal with in trying to communicate about an issue like this is when you talk about the rights of due process under law that is not a thing that is for citizens is for anyone on US soil but unfortunately so much of the white supremacy has been so normalized in our government these days it's just coming out in every tweet in every speech from Republican politicians that I don't know what is left of for many Republican voters their level of respect for the inherent rights of non-white either citizens a documented immigrants undocumented immigrants at this point they're like they would go into this issue assuming that they don't have access to these rights and that makes it very difficult to actually have a serious conversation based on different opinions of how a policy policy should be determined while also respecting the Constitution exactly now just to give you a few other updates on the state of immigration policy in the United States as we all know Trump did sign an executive order ending the separation of children from their parents as they attempt to enter the United States some of those children according to the federal government have been reunited with their parents now again this is messaging directly from the federal government and it's difficult to confirm the real numbers but late Saturday night a DHA DHS statement said 522 children out of the more than 2,500 had already been reunited since the policy began also Congress is unlike to pass any legitimate you know immigration reform but GOP lawmakers are reportedly readying an immigration bill that would allow detain children to stay in detention centers with their parents for more than twenty days so they essentially want to do away with the Flores settlement which we've talked about on the show quite a bit the Flores settlement essentially places standards and restrictions in regard to children who are held in these detention centers they're not supposed to be held for longer than twenty days so that could leads to a conundrum when these children are detained with their parents in essentially prisons these are detention centers so GOP is like oh well let's get rid of that rule and then kids can just be there with their parents indefinitely a simple solution on conundrum is to not hold the families for more than twenty days but I'm not sure that that's actually being considered right now I mean it's it's it's kind of incredible and we have all these devices all these ways of keeping track of those who are deemed to break break the law right I mean Paul Manafort was able to remain in his home with an ankle bracelet as he was awaiting trial so why can't we do that with undocumented immigrants that we believe broke the law but Nitza you see I don't think you need the ankle bracelet just if you want to know everything that they ever where they go everything they do and everything they say does give them a cellphone Facebook will track them for us that's a good point it's a good point joking I don't actually want them to be track that way right but you know again it's a legitimate point that some some people don't show up to their court date it is a legitimate point so instead of keeping them in prisons or detention centers which are funded through our taxpayer dollars why can't we find a better way of monitoring them so they do show up to their court date two easy ways Foley on Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our
