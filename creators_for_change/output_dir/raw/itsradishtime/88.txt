00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,600

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,069
week and to get this out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way I</font>

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,840
have seen at least a dozen unfamiliar

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,170
fishes of ng crabs sea urchins dolphins

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,949

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,470
besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the animals I think the most</font>

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,060
remarkable<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that I've seen here is</font>

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,630
how intent this island seems to be on

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,960
undoing itself look I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting on lava</font>

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,359
so at the end of my eighth grade year we

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,329
had somewhat of a graduation ceremony I

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,010
got to straighten my hair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and wear</font>

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,110
high-heeled shoes and we sing seasons of

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">love from rent and at the end of it all</font>

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,960
I just started sobbing my friends asked

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,789
me what was wrong and I said to these

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,789
girls who were graduating from my tiny

19
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,010
Catholic middle school to all go to my

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,899
same tiny catholic high school in the

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">fall everything is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,000
don't want it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change that summer I</font>

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,160
went to Jews camp discovered emo music

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,710
painted my fingernails black and never

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,739
hung out with any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them ever again and</font>

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,590
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sitting here on the youngest in</font>

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,869
a series of islands that rose up through

28
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,390
hot spots<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Earth's mantle they shoot</font>

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,299
up from the center and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they cool and</font>

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,689
Harden and slowly get worn away by the

31
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,350
sea at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edges it's radish time a</font>

32
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,970
geology channel this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also a place</font>

33
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,939
that seen the co-opting and colonization

34
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,700
of people whose stories I can tell this

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,130
is a place that through eruption or

36
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,880
erosion says listen this time I'd like

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,390
to destroy myself to paint my beaches

38
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,820
black to carve out all the bad parts

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,430
with waves and waterfalls how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to imagine that it's</font>

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
just an upward climb into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> light</font>

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,020
getting better always better to do lists

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,090
and bold risks that end in wild

46
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,369
successes and your same old middle
