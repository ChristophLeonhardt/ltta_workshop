well if you've never solved a crossword before my advice is start with a Monday and the New York Times Monday is the easiest puzzle of the week and it builds up to very hard on Friday and Saturday if you start in a Friday or Saturday you're likely to be smashed and come away frustrated but start on a Monday fill in what you know look through the clues find something that you are positive of and then build out from there and especially use the more unusual letters of the alphabet to help you you know a K or an F or a Z is going to be more useful to you in a crossing answer than an A or an E wherever you are build out from what you know if you get stuck don't be afraid to guess and but also don't be afraid to erase if your guess isn't working out if you really get stuck put the puzzle aside come back later it is amazing how often that trick works I don't know why it works but you'll get one new answer in the grid and you'll be off and running again fill in the blank clues are often the best ones to start with because they're easy to spot in a list of clues and they often have unique answers so if the clue was one blank customer you know the phrase is one to a customer and with three letters you know boom fill it in t√≠o and a if you've been solving crosswords for a while you know crossword ease and crossword e's are those short vowel heavy answers that show up in crosswords way more often than they do in everyday life you know let's take Brian Eno for example the he was one of the founding members of Roxy music but he's an important person in ambient music and you know if you see musician Brian you know it's going to be you know you know fill that in and we'll work out from there
