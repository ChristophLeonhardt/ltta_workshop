hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things were considered I'm Peter LaBelle US president Donald Trump is then a complete reversal on Syria a full 180 what accounts for this why and what's next crosstalking Trump's 180 on Syria I'm joined by my guests here in Moscow mark Sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Dimitri Baba she's a political analyst with Sputnik International and we have Glenn deezen he is a visiting scholar at the higher School of Economics all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump any time you want and I always appreciate it we're gonna develop this entire program to what's going on in Syria primarily Donald Trump's 180 a few months ago he mentioned publicly of getting out of Syria now it looks like the president has changed his mind or has had his mind changed mark yeah I think I'll go with the last after what we've seen this week with the the release of the book by Bob Woodward with the release of this anonymous anonymous editorial in The New York Times this is op-ed in the New York Times I'm sorry with this deep stater in the administration outing himself I'm sorry not deep stater he possesses theater he prefers the term steady state all right okay steady state ER you know saying that he swipes documents off of Donald Trump's desk to prevent him from signing them and that there's a cabal of officials particularly on foreign policy that do whatever they can to prevent Donald Trump's policies from being fulfilled so I think we're looking rather at the deep state at the steady state has full control of the foreign and military policy now with regards to Syria as we've long discussed about and we heard this announcement of this new policy of this indefinite forever US military presence in Syria not by Trump himself but by James Jeffery okay let's say okay what what is the strategy what do they even know at this point no I think it's a good question to ask whether or not there's a clear strategy definitely after yeah Afghanistan Iraq Libya is worth asking whether or not there's a clear strategy behind but I think with Trump it's definitely something to this that the US isn't actually acting at a unity reactor at the moment given that you this infighting even within its own administration but if we assume that Trump's assumptions have been quite genuine that he wants to pull America's security guarantees back a little bit there has been two important exceptions which has been first Iran he's quite hostile in Iran and the second would be America's friendship with Israel and of course Syria is right in the middle of both these two exceptions so I guess he was always somewhat predisposed sounded parenthetical envelope with all of his promises on the back that I've mentioned many times in this program he's not technically starting a new war that was his promise okay so he's flipping it here Dima we had Iran Russia and Turkey meeting in Tehran everyone puts a nice face on it but it was a disaster it was a car wreck well I think why the very fact that Turkey Russia and Iran worked on something together for the first time in I think three centuries you know if you look at the history of conflict we never could you know agree on something in common who's the odd man out I think in this time where it's of course president Erdogan but but it's very unfortunate because basically when I talk to Syrians they will agree that the war is over the war should be over because it should be but it looks like it's gonna be reignited in a really big way the problem is that position has exhausted its potential I mean it's clear that Syrians wants want peace the country is exhausted everything is more or less clear you know and and the Syrians they simply have no guts no desire for for a continued war so they're really irritated by this continued uncertainty about it lip okay okay that's okay that's exactly where we wanted to go you're absolutely right but they're not so exhausted that they're not going to and they are doing it as we speak right now yeah berating the city what we've actually seen so far is just that the claiming of the low-hanging for the real wars are yet to come and they could potentially be much much more significant I with regards to the strategy that the u.s. is deploying in Syria I think the moon of Alabama blog we wouldn't we were just looking what an eloquent here it is here you are all this literally on the same page here US military illegally stays in occupied East Syria dot dot dot underpants dot dot dot Iran leaves Syria and the Syrian government false I mean that that's the even reading the same article here Clinton was that everyone has to all foreigners have to leave Syria except for the United States so wide net Turks yeah okay well that remains to be played out here and but there there seems to be a move to create in effect a partition right now I mean the US wants to create some kind of state lift semi-autonomous semi independent that will be dependent on on the Western powers primarily the United States nobody think in the region once that bar maybe Israel yeah well I think that yeah we're gonna have to appreciate the situation that the United States isn't at the moment in terms of what their initial objectives were cuz of course when they went into Syria first supporting this jihadist yeah rebellion jihadists militants whatever you want to call it however we want to call it but of course the objectives were somewhat clear you get rid of Assad which is an important ally of Iran they're considering noise to to Israel and of course you reestablish a u.s. differently apparently yeah they did and but I'm just saying now we have the opposite Iran has more influence there than had in the past the US has been largely discredited in the region and of course Russia's back as a security provider so you know either of you from Egypt or Jordan if you you know what security in the region from now on you have to also book a flight to Moscow so I think that everything they went for has gone the other way and that's not necessarily a good thing because when you have this winner-takes-all situations that the other side more historically the memorial instead we're setting flames David Ignatius his interview with a high govern White House official about creating Quagmire's in Syria Dima when usually the term strategic patience is applied to the United States and dealing with North Korea but the Russians have been strategically patient in Syria you could tell in Tehran the Vladimir Putin is beginning to lose his patience with his partners and with the situation on the ground again Syrians are oozing their patience with the war and of course Russians including Vladimir Putin are losing their patience with the so-called international community I mean I watched this UN session chaired by victorious movement on Syria and I was just disgusted you know the reason why you mean example the French the French said that Russia's was the main responsibility for the possible humanitarian catastrophe France bombed Syria France was never invited there it is it is a former colonial power the French killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians in the 20th century and now they say this is all our responsibility there was the the Victorian old herself who just recently said Russia was never going to be America's friend you remember and now she says she is calling on Russia in the end of his speech we're calling on Russia work with us walk with the UN you know we're never going to be our friend but walk with us no you know and then let me decode that means listen to us and do what we say here is not just very important very quick the United States has been warned about bad consequences in Syria Nouri al-maliki the former prime minister of iraq said that the Civil War would spread to Iraq they said no and it did spread the African Union in about Libya the African Union warned the united states that after Qaddafi Falls there's going to be a migration disaster is going to be now okay so we didn't face 2003 there was no Isis in Iraq and there was no Isis in Syria mark we hear humanitarian catastrophe but we've heard this many many times before look what happened with Aleppo when it was liberated was there a humanitarian catastrophe no it's completely forgotten okay the same thing the humanitarian forces of al Qaeda are completely driven from the city I mean I mean this coming from the United States is is simply risible all right no one cried about a humanitarian catastrophe when the US was bombing the Iraqi cities of Fallujah of muscle or uninvited the Syrian cities of Raqqa kobani mem Beach when they were driving jihadists in this case Isis out of western Iraq in eastern Syria in fact an interagency UN team and Amnesty International on the ground in in Raqqa after the u.s. offensive says it was the most destroyed city in the Syrian conflict seventy to eighty percent of the buildings destroyed far more than two thousand civilian casualties and this is you know the rhetoric that we hear from the United States basically it's saying when you are conducting counter-terrorist al Qaeda and the remnants of our proxies do what we say not what we did in Syria England if it's interesting how Trump is being played into this here because I think there's a lot of smart military people would think that the military strategy they're in it isn't a military strategy at this point it's a political one it is it's creating I'm putting down a marker here there could be a conflict with Russia and all this has this been thought out or is it a bluff well I think they can definitely stumble into this again when you develop a strategy what distinguishes strategy from policies usually you have to predict what the adversaries will do and then I think it is a situation they've had too many actors with too many interests and they probably hasn't well they might not have planned everything out we often assume that they know exactly what they're doing but I don't think that they do and I think this quagmire strategy reason right here it's happened here is you usually somebody must go then you invade the country but now they've been baited the country and their that then they're deciding what should be done so this is regime change the Reapers Jen well gentlemen gonna jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on Syria staying with RT welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle remind you we're discussing the situation in Syria okay let me go to mark it's kind of broaden this side I like to kind of look at the interests and positions of some of the characters and this beyond Donald Trump go ahead yeah well I think probably the most important from the very beginning has always been Turkey and Aragon I mean without the Turkish border none of the us-saudi Qatari supplies jihadi shipped around the world would get into Syria and their role in that as the the base I mean the US bases in Turkey for illegally arming training and cellaring their jihadi proxies for regime change in Syria were literally euphemistically named the moms centers and these were too gonz mom centers in Turkey in the Astana Agreement this has always been kind of a geopolitical dance if you will imagine Putin and Aragon waltzing across a chessboard with daggers poised at each other's back they both have interests the Russia was trying to exploit the split of you know the disagreements between Aragon and the US and NATO especially over the Kurds and so on you know and paying lip service to Turkish interests in there but what he was really trying to do is cut the other backers of regime change Saudi Arabia Qatar the UAE the US UK France Israel out of it right because we could deal with Turkey he knew that supply lines you know the open border it was always about Turkey in in this latest Astana summit in Tehran we saw the gloves come off and we saw the reality that it's been all along one of the things are Glenn I mean it seems to me that Turkey is ending up isolating itself it is it has kind of a tepid cool relationship with the US look what happened to the Turkish lira the situation with NATO obviously Iran in Russia are at odds with air diwan's plans he doesn't want to see ad-libbed fall he's the odd guy out here and it's probably not a good position to be in for very long no I agree and I think that is alienated everyone now from the Americans Russia of course serious world as well as the Iranians don't trust him fully but I think that yeah this improvement of relations between Russia and Turkey is a the smart pointer can be a bit deceptive I think that this rift between the Americans and the Turks definitely have given Russia some flexibility but at the end of the day as we saw now in this meeting their interests are quite different Russia and Turkey have mutual interests ok I don't call them partners in Syria okay no I think actually that's irony of the whole thing like is serious where their interest would clash the most in other areas their interests are yeah much more aligned so I think that the split with the US and also other interests in terms of Turkey considering leading leaning more to the east I think weapons sales I think there's a lot of areas they can work in and I think that I've begun perhaps was trying to use this knowledge teammates the Kurds okay because the US continues to support them but people on the ground do not want in northern Syria in Northeast Syria they don't want to be ruled by turkeys you know what would you call them they're their assets okay and then at the same time they don't want to be ruled by these Arab tribes don't want to be ruled by the Kurds so I mean it's kind of a hopeless situation there and then the u.s. is in the middle of it all well when the US moved in and when they destabilized the situation in Syria like they stabilize the situation in Iraq before consequences were unpredictable it's like starting a chain reaction you know and I'm not even sure the United States is really guided by interests in this whole situation because if we look at the results the results are abysmal for US interests the United States failed to topple not even an anti-western president at present as it was not anti-western a mildly disagree because reform absolutely yes and the result is that they lost they basically lost a very important ally Turkey which is much more important than than Syria in Libya they moved in okay that into I Qaddafi Qaddafi was killed now they have a civil war in Libya migration crisis in Europe Isis operating in Libya so if we judge the situation from the position of interests Obama should be declared the most disastrous president in US history you know simply because his actions were against against the long-term US market is this just refusing defeat I mean this is double down and we'll keep trying what we've been doing before I mean it explains the rationality is it just the empire is it messianic I mean these days right I mean if it's interest then where are the results I mean the results side of the ledger is pretty thin yeah I mean they of course refuse to see that you know the increased Iranian Russian influences is obvious blowback to what we all saw at the beginning of the conflict they have an inability to see that and they also have an inability to admit defeat to Russia that that would have huge geopolitical impact you know reproductions of Russia Russia Russia around the world right they simply can't allow it so what the neo cons have been doing is all along since Trump took office they've been planning to use this Iran spin to make to convince Trump to become more active in Syria not because of Russia but because of Iran and that has played out in what the US has announces their new strategy ie they are never leaving their illegal military occupation of Syria unless Iran leaves all their troops home which is a matter between Syria and Iran and the Syrian government that is acceptable to the International Commission the work we're not interested in a regime change but we're not leaving until we get a government that is acceptable to the international community which means the Washington Consensus area Glenn I we've talked about this subject for so many times on this program here but really the issue that we have players like Turkey that are unpredictable but one country that is absolutely predictable in all this is Iran and Iran has made it very very clear that will not allow the current government the current political arrangement in Damascus to be forceful overthrown that is their red line and that's what the US cannot accept no I agree with that and I do it would also be reasonable to suspect that they might be next in line once well cut off from Syria so I think it's just healthy self defense as well in addition to looking after an ally but I think their interests are clear because yeah they're clearly defined that they've been following it throughout the whole thing and they were invited there yes which is was slightly ironic that the Americans will set up an occupation so now in Syria are calling for the Iranians to pull back which obviously I'd wanna didn't appreciate us they're actually invited to stabilize the country so I mean if there's gonna be a permanent presence here then it tells me that we will never get to a period of peace I mean this goes back to the quagmire comment which I think it was probably Bolton or Pompeo that said that is it because they don't have a end game that they can achieve just keep stirring it up I mean I've kind of likened it to like a roulette wheel you know you throw the wheel you it starts spinning and then you throw the ball on you don't get the number you want let's spin it again okay that seems to me the strategy here which is very dangerous well I agree I think that quagmire as well as setting up the occupation zone this more indication of an absence of a strategy because what they're saying essential for the position we're not sure what we want it or how we can get it but we'll delay and see what opportunities comes in the future and we can negotiate with this quagmire so it's expensive it creates tensions and Afghanistan by supporting the most point well I mean you compare it to roulette I compare it to history I like comparisons but I compare it to the idea of world revolution that the early Bolshevik state basically you know spread no is not historical this is idea absolutely I mean like we tried in Calgary we failed doesn't matter we'll try again we'll try again in Germany in Germany we failed okay maybe a period after the first when Russia was really geological when Bolshevism was really in its early stage very active and believing in itself so in the same way it all reminds me of these ok we failed in Iraq you know Iraq is allow and now Iranian missile its report and it's reported reported next to the Israeli territory doesn't matter we'll try again in Libya we failed in Libya doesn't matter the ideology cannot be wrong you know people can be wrong individuals can be wrong we picked up a wrong candidate Hillary Clinton she was too divisive we'll have a better one next time but we couldn't fail we couldn't be root of the ideology is incorrect the ideology is correct so in the same way the approach in Syria now this document United Nations directive on let me quote that parameters and principles of un aid to Syria the idea of that document is that there should be no you an eight to reconstruct Syria until there is a political transition to this little maybe to this little stateless they will get eight here you know mark one of the things I find fascinating going back to the internal politics of the United States is that this is throwing the dice but if it fails well it's Trump's fault isn't it it's whose administration well I mean we could have completely ignored that it was Obama who actually launched the proxy war on Syria if we want but I don't really I don't really see it that way because we see broad bipartisan support we you know whether it's Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi doing meet-and-greets with the Mujahideen II calc you know video messages and so on there is broad bipartisan support the the two-party warp on the cadences the McCain consensus is fully behind the you know the us stepping up their aggression against Syria you know if he stepped it down they would blame never success has many fathers but failure is a bastard okay and I think this is no no there's a bipartisan support at the highest levels against President Trump they want to see him fail on everything okay even if it said in spite of me in spite of the interest of the United States in the world I'm getting the last word blanket well I agree with what Mark said in terms to this a bipartisan interest in this in continuing this what is essentially a failed mission but the same time I would point out that a lot of people in Washington are noticing that this the unipolar moment is retracting and there is a vacuum opening few aggressive in its allies yeah but even though it recognizes there's no one who will have a good answer well what now what a transition to next cause yes like they pointed out that they would like to work with Russia as long as Russia does what is told so it's not really quite sure what will come next and I think usually they should transition to building a wall on the southern border that's all the time you have gentlemen many thanks and I guess here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules now for the extended version of our program we have political popery mark you're first up yeah so bringing us back to this Astana roundtable it was actually it was the first Astana meeting where the proceedings were broadcast live there's a lot of objects round glass table with Putin rou-ha-nee and Aragon spread out across it and you know it was quite clear that you know this wasn't going to be you know the the the PR and photo op from the beginning rou-ha-nee opened up real quickly he's saying that you know all the terror you know something that is very hard to disagree with all the terrorists in it lib must be eradicated which is actually what UN Security Council everybody should be nodding everyone should be now undergone started getting all flustered and screaming about humanitarian catastrophe and all the poor civilians that he didn't worry about certainly when he was bombing Afrin because he would lose his houses I mean what you'd get explain why that is so and because Turkey has long supported you know the insurgency across Syria but particularly in it live their goal in it live what they came they came asking for a ceasefire and what their goal is they say what they haven't been able to do for the years and and why every ceasefire from Geneva peace dd peace treaty from Geneva to carry to everything else has always failed is because you can't separate the the good jihadis from the bad jihadis right the moderate rebels from 31 flavors of jihad was given a year to do that he still hopes to get HT s Hyatt to here al sham al Qaeda the the the Chinese workers the Chechens all to put on Turkey proxies uniforms and operate as his militia to control in Lib like he has set up in the direct last quarter this isn't going to happen so yeah how does he walk it back he did see that's that's the human there's huge domestic consequences politically and if he fails to fall through on this he's gonna face terrorism not only you know from the Kurds if you want to call that terrorism but from these remnants of al Qaeda whatever that are going to be driven into jarabulus driven into Turkey after the completion of the idli operation and they're gonna be angry at Aragon for not supporting them enough the looks he he said we can't leave Italy to the mercies of the Assad regime and rouhani and Putin are just looking at the ceasefire and Putin said a ceasefire you know diplomatic ly that would be very nice unfortunately I don't see a representative of Isis of al Qaeda Isis or the other jihadi is at the table do I looking quite pointedly at Otakon he says well then no ceasefire too bad but I sincerely hope they show some sense and lay down their arms but the thing is is that Iran and Russia are proceeding with the Syrian government turkey is already shipping arms and weapons into the jihadis Enid Lib and they're promising to end the airstrikes okay it's it could have happened there's another element we didn't talk about in the first part of the were to in block a and B China's position on all of this because I think a lot of people don't understand that we do have a lot of we Gers from China there are Turkic Peco people jihadi jihadis people have told me that they would even make al-qaeda blush the Chinese don't want the hoots folks back okay no definitely and I think that China also farce been sitting this one out but they're their objectives and I guess sympathies are more closely aligned with Russia on this obviously and much like Russia they're very concerned about as I mentioned this is jihadis returning home and also instability spreading into Eurasia so they have their own interest of course and I think that they might you might see their influence grow more now that the war well hopefully drawing to an end because again we have this issue of reconstruction and in China could possibly play a major role that is demon pointed out here I mean if you look at some of the resolutions in the past Congress I mean they want to make it illegal for anyone around the sanctions again sanction everybody anyone that wants to help the Syrian government to rebuild except for the people that they want to have have helped directed towards I mean again this kind of law fair UN and sanctions have just run amok here yeah but the Chinese I mean don't anyone you know it's all really nice to think but unless if things develop in a major way like a US military invasion of Damascus or something you're not gonna see Chinese troops on the ground them no matter how much they want the week or so much or maybe a few advisers special forces might be quiet money here out yeah money reconstruction is the big thing but let's not forget the important role that China has played supporting Russia and Iran and Syria at the United Nations it has been a solid block voting bloc from the very beginning at the UN Security Council it's most important this is the most tragic thing about that so this document that I just quoted and that was mentioned by foreign minister Lavrov on the 20th of August this document that prohibits UN structures from helping in the reconstruction of Syria it was basically adopted on an initiative of an American citizen working in the UN and it was more or less approved during this meeting chaired by Victoria Nuland by France by the UK by all the major you know representatives of the Western of the Western community of nations they said let me quote it political transition is much more important than reconstruction I mean imagine after the World War to France you know Germany Italy devastated by the war meeting at st. okay we're not going to reconstruct it all the rabo is not important what we need is political transition it's it's just the war was actually in a different way in Syria let's point out that it's not so much money handed from the US no one expects the us to give large sums of money to reconstruct the country that they failed to destroy you know it you know but that cuts you off from International Finance because the US as as turkey as Iran is less Treasury Department even the EU trying to now conceive of a Swift outside the US has all the commanding heights of the International Finance and getting the loans to rebuild and rebuild businesses and buildings and so on that is where the u.s. is gonna weigh its heft and always has but please note that US Treasury Department how did they explain sanctions against the Russian businessman it's just a big company which plays pivotal role in Russian energy and the head of it talked to President Putin is easily arrayed or related to President Putin what kind of crime is that you know he talked to Putin he has a big energy company the same logic was with the two turkish ministers now they applied I think this week they applied Magnitsky Act for the first time to China so this kind of approach you know we the Treasury Department were sanctioning these people not because they committed a crime not even because they said something against them like it was but because they are rich under a bedroom with what they're doing demon are very broadly and I think we could do a whole program on it is that the u.s. is undermining the dollar by using sanctions as a political weapon because the more you sanctioned countries and companies are gonna say why don't we just trade in a different currency when you are the my money is trust Iran no but I mean the alternative Swift systems Russia has won already the u.s. is actually encouraging the D dollarization of the global economy step by step I think that's where China comes in as well because this isn't happening in a vacuum at the moment of course China is pushing her heart its own strategic industries abroad they want to develop their own transportation corridor they want to develop their own investment banks and again their on currency internationalize it and furthermore they're on a payment system of course raveling switch which is already been developed as well so they they are looking to rewire the whole Bretton Woods institutions and I think this is coming at a very interesting time the u.s. indirectly is helping him do that of course Russia Iran now Syria this a lot of countries would like to align closer with a Chinese system that's not you know gunning for their economy so definitely I want to close with the idli because this is this is this important confrontation there and you know the the Russian Air Force has already started you know doing pinpoint strikes against ammunition supplies command and control and you know we're gonna see artillery and there's some softening up before we see any ground operations but whatever Turkey and the US scream about and we can expect to see them some type of chemical weapon false flag you mentioned that almost certainly take place but it's not going to stop them all right this is essential no state would allow al-qaeda and its allies to occupy a huge portion of their own state it's a threat to the world not just the people of Syria and it live and there is no political settlement possible with al Qaeda and their allies or anyone I know wants to incite no real loves to say there's no military yes there isn't a solution it's only a military solution you you know anyone fighting for Sharia law is not compatible with a multi-ethnic multi-confessional secular Syrian Republic and I have a solution though because I want to give daemon 11 I have a solution if the u.s. is so concerned about humanitarian catastrophe and casualties in it live in the other countries every country that illegally armed trained and salaried proxies in in Syria that are now in it'd live that you know so worried about take them home 15 seconds team ago well just recently we saw Theresa May the British prime minister showing us to property terrorists who somehow ended entered the UK and wrong names and I mean Naugatuck Naugatuck know exactly and we see these two people at photographed in places which say nothing about where they are I mean look at these pictures and and they have been searching this hotel where they state since May and there was no look if you know what I thought was insignificant about that only one thing the timing of it with a lot of things that Mark mention if we run out of time here in fact I hope our audience has enjoyed our extended version of our program we'll see you next week and remember crosstalk fools you
