1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,009
Do you want me to turn you so you can be looking
outwards?

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,009
Yes please

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:08,459
 

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,940
How about… there?

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,380
First time we came out with Bee, Jade said:

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,940
“It feels like I’ve been released from prison”

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,560
Do you want these Mrs?

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
Definitely!

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
Definitely?

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
Right
Yeah

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,920
And she could say hello to everybody, people
she hasn’t seen for months

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,480
That’s Jade

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,540
So you can talk to Jade through this

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,320
Hi Katy!

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,060
She’s there

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,800
Hi!

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,530
Every time anyone has seen her, they want
to know why she’s there

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,790
And it’s kind of the opposite when you’re
in a wheelchair and people see you and they

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,920
kind of go “Oh, should I look?

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
I don’t know.

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,110
I don’t know what the right protocol is”

22
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,640
When there is a tiny robot with these bright
little eyes going around just looking happy

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,399
everywhere, it really opens you up for conversation

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,290
You’ve got some friends here, look

25
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,670
Hiya!

26
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,509
When I saw her for the first time, I remember
thinking, this is gonna change things, this

27
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:16,260
is one of those points where if this was a
book, this would be a cliffhanger

28
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,100
I have a condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
which means that I have a lot of dislocations,

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,969
there’s a lot of pain and a lot of seizures
and what not

30
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,280
So I can end up on my own in my room for long
periods of time

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,960
Here my love

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,400
A lot of the time with a condition like my
own of course there is the pain

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,040
And the pain is bad, and the dislocations
are bad, and the seizures and being in paralysis

34
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:16,200
and never knowing whether you’re going to
be able to wake up properly tomorrow,

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
that’s bad

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,209
But what’s worse still is being able to
count the number of people you see a day on

37
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,560
one hand

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,840
Are you ready?

39
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,730
Sure am, I’m just hoping the connection
is gonna stay

40
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,500
Yeah, me too

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,200
Alright, here we go

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,599
When you’re used to just the same little
metre by metre and a half window everyday

43
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,599
and you’ve been there for months,

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,180
being able to just see the sky from somewhere
else, or the tops of trees or a sign is incredible

45
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,360
Or being able to have that kind of chat in
the car that most people

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,760
probably take for granted

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,569
We’re gonna go pass grandma and granddad
so you can give them a wave

48
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:02,560
Now with Jade being particularly “seizury”,
she can still take part

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,200
And that’s brilliant really ‘cause before
she would just be left in the bed or in the

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,040
house with just her carers

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,160
It’s quite a small world that

52
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,090
Right, so there is one of her.

53
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,280
Here, this costume I’m busy making at the
moment.

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:28,390
When I’m not on bed rest and I’m not just
wearing pyjamas all the time, I enjoy being

55
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,599
able to dress as different characters and
go to Comic Cons and that kind of thing

56
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,590
Because it just lets me show different side
of myself and it’s a bit o fun

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,460
If you can’t go out that often, you’ve
gotta enjoy it when you do

58
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,020
<laughter>

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,800
How’s that?

60
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,940
Good

61
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,579
It’s one of those weird things where I want
to not have to use Bee because I want to be

62
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,499
well enough to be able to go to those places
myself

63
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:56,639
Like it really makes a big difference to me
to be able to go into school, but the thing

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,480
is with my condition fluctuating all of the
time, I can’t go into school reliably

65
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,420
He’s written it out bigger on the board,
thank you…

66
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,120
Today is the first day that I’ve been in
school via Bee and so far it’s interesting

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,560
Still there’s few little things that we
need to work out but for the most part I think

68
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,470
it’s going fairly well

69
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,190
And it’s brilliant because I can really
tell the difference between today and yesterday

70
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:45,130
How yesterday I forced myself to go into school
when I wasn't very well and I was really tired

71
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,210
afterwards and ended up having lots of seizures

72
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,510
Whereas today I’ve been able to do all of
the work, I’ve been able to keep a clear

73
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,350
head and not be ill, which means I’m able
to be more focused on my schoolwork

74
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,950
So there is my first step of working, it’s
to simplify root eight

75
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,780
The algebra test is next week

76
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,780
Now I’m trying to make friendships which
I’ll be able to maintain with Bee

77
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,140
Before that I’ve ended letting people down
quite often

78
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,010
Bee gives me hope, yeah

79
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,000
She’s just always there and if I can’t
do something, she can

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,810
And if I need sort of assistance to be able
to make commitments then she’s there

81
00:05:28,810 --> 00:00:00,000
And she means that I feel like a more valuable
person because I’m more reliable
