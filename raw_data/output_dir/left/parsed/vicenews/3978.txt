for years this factory made Christmas
tree lights but now
workers at reyda home take waste
products from electronics manufacturers
all over Asia and extract pure tin from
it in the form of ingots which are later
resold for a profit Cheng Wei Hong is
one of two brothers who own the factory
he showed me around the EOC though it
kind of seems like you're milking ten
cows right now no Chen Kwai UN the other
brother told me about the business of
recycling ten how many ingots do you
make 10 tonnes of tin every single day
everything how much is a single ingot of
tin worth learning chip I'm 18 so
business is doing well the factory is
one of apples suppliers and Apple has
made a point of using recycled tin in
its phones because using metals that are
mined directly from the earth isn't
great for the planet and often for
people the tech company declined to
comment for this story
however the Taiwanese government has
injected massive amounts of money into
building a recycling industry so the
rate of hung business model is one they
can get behind yang Feng Chi runs a
division of the government that's
responsible for sustainability woman say
it's a good say to the shoulder mill zoo
in the Ching Gong cha Chi su
well know your father good on tiny woman
Biggio to the young Jay Sauter name is
Eunice yo she turns out to eat all the
tents now ten seconds in yo
Jen's Allah says on to that Olympia
the government's efforts have been
working today Taiwanese people produce
on average just under two pounds of
waste each everyday that's three times
less than Americans
but Taiwan's success with recycling
hasn't really been recognized by the
international community
largely because they haven't been part
of the United Nations since 1971 and
repeated attempts to rejoin have been
blocked by China which claims Taiwan as
part of its territory Shangguan

caper woman that I wonder
technology yet she turned out she had a
gorgeous - bang - Jin Akagi a to talk so
how that zoom or his so given how much
this is worth
what do you think of the fact that some
countries this stuff just ends up
getting put in landfill just like this
