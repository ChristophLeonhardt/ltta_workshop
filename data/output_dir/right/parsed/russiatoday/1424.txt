with regards to the United States
relation towards you
president Trump has called you quotes
animal Assad do you have a nickname for
the US president yes this is not my
language so I can not use similar
language
this is his language it represents him I
think there's a very known principle
that what you see is what you are they
wanted to present what he is anyway
didn't move anything and it's this kind
of language shouldn't move anything in
for for anyone the only thing that moves
you is what people that you trust people
who are level-headed people who are
thoughtful put people who are moral
ethical that what should move anything
inside you whether positive or negative
somebody like Trump will move nothing
for me
you
