>> Bill: YOU SEE WHAT'S ON THE
LINE FOR THIS CAMPAIGN SWING.
OBVIOUS ON THE BOARD HERE WHEN
YOU TALK ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR
THE U.S. SENATE.
BALANCE OF POWER NOW GOING INTO
A MID-TERM THAT'S 18 DAYS AWAY
IT'S 51 REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS
AT 49.
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOUR STATE
SWING THROUGH MONDAY PUTTING
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FRONT AND
CENTER.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY WITH ME NOW.
WHAT'S THE STRATEGY ON
IMMIGRATION HERE?
>> THE STRATEGY IS TO PUT
IMMIGRATION IN THE FOREFRONT.
WE SAW A DEFINITIVE CHANGE IN
POLLING WHEN DEMOCRATS STARTED
CALLING FOR THE ABOLITION OF
ICE.
IN THAT MOMENT WHEN MAINSTREAM
DEMOCRATS CALLING FOR THE
ABOLITION OF THIS LAW
ENFORCEMENT ENTITY WE SAW IT
RISE TO PROMINENCE IN THE POLLS
MOTIVATING REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
79% OF TRUMP VOTERS SAID
IMMIGRATION WAS AN IMPORTANT
ISSUE IN THEIR VOTE.
THE LAWLESSNESS WE SEE
APPROACHING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER
IS SOMETHING THAT IS SENDING
GOP VOTERS STRAIGHT TO THE
POLLS.
>> Bill: I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING ON THE MAP WE'RE
WATCHING.
NO ACCIDENT YOU WATCH THE
TRAVEL AND THE TRIP OF THE
PRESIDENT AND THE VICE
PRESIDENT, TOO, OVER THE COMING
THREE WEEKS.
IT WAS MONTANA LATE YESTERDAY,
GOOD MATCH-UP BETWEEN ROSENDALE
AND JON TESTER.
YOU SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID
TWO YEARS AGO IN MONTANA.
HE BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY 20
POINTS.
POP HERE AND GO DOWN TO ARIZONA
WHERE THE CAMPAIGN RALLY WILL
HAPPEN A BIT LATER TODAY.
MARTHA McSALLY UP AGAINST THE
DEMOCRAT SINEMA.
YOU SEE WHAT HE DID TWO YEARS
AGO, WON THE STATE BY FOUR
POINTS.
NEVADA DIFFERENT STORY.
DEAN HELLER IS RUNNING FOR
REELECTION.
THE ONLY REPUBLICAN ON THE
BALLOT IN A STATE THAT DONALD
TRUMP DID NOT WIN.
HILLARY CLINTON WON BY 2 1/2
POINTS TWO YEARS AGO.
ON MONDAY IT IS TEXAS, SO YOU
HAVE QUITE CLEARLY ON THE MAP
BEHIND US, KAYLEIGH, YOU HAVE
AT LEAST ARIZONA AND TEXAS, TWO
BIG BORDER STATES.
PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT THE WHITE
HOUSE IS UP TO.
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
THE RACES YOU POINTED TO PUBLIC
POLLING SHOWS THE REPUBLICAN UP.
AFTER THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS
AMID CALLS FROM VIOLENCE FROM
DEMOCRATS AND THE CARAVAN.
WE'VE SEEN POLLING SHIFT IN OUR
DIRECTION AND YOU'RE RIGHT TO
POINT OUT TEXAS AND ARIZONA.
IT IS VERY MOTIVATING FOR THOSE
TWO STATES.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT WILL COME
UP IN TEXAS WITH TED CRUZ AND
ARIZONA WITH MARTHA McSALLY.
>> Bill: LINDSEY GRAHAM IS
HITTING THE TRAIL.
YOU CAN SEE TWO OF THE FOUR
BORDER STATES WERE WON BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS GOING ON THE
TRAIL.
PART OF HIS TRIP IS CLEARLY TO
REMIND VOTERS ABOUT THE
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION.
DO REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY'RE
LOSING THE BUMP IN THE
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION OF TWO
WEEKS AGO?
>> NO, WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT
BECAUSE POST KAVANAUGH BUMP WE
SAW A LOT OF INANE COMMENTS
FROM DEMOCRATS, HILLARY'S
COMMENTS ABOUT THE #METOO
MOVEMENT AND HER HUSBAND NOT
ABUSING POWER.
ELIZABETH WARREN AND THE DNA
TEST.
ERIC HOLDER.
THE LEFT WING GAFFES HAVE
CONTINUED.
WE HAVE TO REMIND VOTERS ABOUT
KAVANAUGH BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE
WE SAW DEFINITIVE TURN IN THE
POLLING.
LIBD
>> WELCOME BIDEN AND OBAMA ONTO
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
THE 2016 WAS A REJECTION OF THE
OBAMA PRESIDENCY AND BRINGING
THE ESTABLISHMENT ELITE ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL HELPS US OUT
QUITE A BIT.
>> Bill: GEORGE BUSH IS GOING
TO INDIANA AS WELL.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND
WE'LL TALK AGAIN NEXT WEEK.
