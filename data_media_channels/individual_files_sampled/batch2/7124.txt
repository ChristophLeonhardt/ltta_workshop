it feels like if you want to win a Republican primary one of the prerequisites is that you do a campaign ad where you point a gun at someone you just have to do it you have to fire some sort of military grade hardware at something usually legislation or a copy of the Constitution I don't know what they're doing but they fire a lot of guns now we have Brian Kemp he wants to be Georgia's next governor he's the current Secretary of State by the way keep that in mind as you watch this ad he takes it in an even weirder turn than the normal Republican I'm Brian Kim this is Jake young man interested in one of my daughters yes sir Jake gas was running for governor I said one cap government spending to take a chainsaw to regulations three make Georgia number one for small business in two things if you go on date one of my daughter's respect and a healthy appreciation for the Second Amendment sir we're gonna get along just fine Brian Kemp for governor I could not hate that out more than I do doesn't it I mean it's almost it's like half a click office being in kitchen el faro could have been like well if at the end those framed images like one of them gets shot off of the desk I don't you've gotten more votes if Jake was black or Latino and you're like why not go all the way and just point a gun at a minority while you sitting there sorry that the white voter would say why are you even having a conversation with letting a minority Tate your daughter no that's why you brought the gun but again like you said this works and earlier when we were talking about the primary remember that key word a viable candidate see this is what's like this is a viable candidate and Georgia this this is a once you leave Atlanta this is a viable candidate a guy who's sitting there with a gun you know just yeah you're right it would be a great sketch if Will Ferrell did it but this is real and this is why Will Ferrell's job is so hard they're like okay well go be funnier than that what what he's worth there how do I pop this one you know you can't you can't you can no longer top our reality with comedy yeah look we we argued about this ad in our production meeting more than almost anything else the world me and uh and brett erlich argued about this and i get that like that's a very savvy ad for republican i bet every republican voter loves that ad because they think it's funny and also they totally agree with every moral and social thing that makes that funny to you like everything about republican and conservative traditions about female ownership and all that is totally like necessary to like that and and they do i do have some problems with it though i mean first of all i mean you know there's school shootings like every two weeks and your one state over from florida on you're pointing a gun at a kid and saying you're gonna shoot him for sleeping with your daughter or whatever i think that's a little bit odd also if you have so much respect for the second amendment that's great it's a right that you have it doesn't let you murder people for dating your daughter that seems like a misunderstanding he said you have to have a healthy understanding the second amendment you don't seem to Brian Kemp it seems I well there are n are a people who protests at the ad because there is a big thing in guns you don't point a gun at somebody unless you intend to use it and you don't you know we've had a plenty accidents with people like that playing with a gun I didn't know it was loaded but but the this kind of thing it does work for them you know it does work and and you again how do you fight that when that works there's no there's no counter ad that's gonna get that you know yeah there it's a shorthand you know and and as alonso says there's a sense of this guy's got the same values that i do and that's all built into that imagery personally of course all those guns stacked up next to him he's got a gun in his hand he's pointed at the kid it's all about guns it's disgusting it gives me the creeps I hate it but I'm not the voter they're going for that's true look I I don't think you're ever gonna convince Brian Kemp that he's wrong I'm hoping to convince that young actor or whatever at least some people around here so he acted his ass off shaky nervous but if kept was an actor you would go dude take it down a little bit I think they should have had just a little streak of urine going down the kids pakis I think that would really sold it and look we don't we don't have a lot of time I can't go through the whole thing but I just have to say and I understand that this is an area where apparently I'm out of step I would say I'm a step ahead but that whole thing it is to me it reeks of pathetic it is so cowardly and scared to live your life like that I know it's a joke but I'm saying the serious version of that that that's meant to appeal to the there are people in that region and in other parts of the world who think they need 20 guns to be safe and here's the thing they're wrong and so if you think you need all this to be safe and you don't that is that's not brave that's not manly that's pathetic okay use your fists if you think you need to discipline this kid I wouldn't even do that let alone the whole thing about the fact the implicit assumption that female sexuality is this thing that needs to be guarded and the worth of your daughter will be lessened in some way like would they do that if it was a girl coming in to date his son of course they wouldn't and I know you're just supposed to allow and it's their culture whatever but it just is so pathetic to me and I think we need to move past it don't buy the safety thing there's machismo wrapped up in this it's really all those guns it's almost a sexualized thing all of that all of that power all of that weaponry it's not about safety anymore that gun culture is awash in guns because it's a certain machismo associated with it I know women have guns too but they've been sucked into that same culture go ahead with your hate on YouTube and all the rest but that's just the fact of it by the way I don't even I don't even hate guns I think that there should be far more regulations than there are but I've my family has owned guns I've shot guns many times I'm not against guns but I am against their fetish the fetishizing exactly well it's also what you said is true I mean the cowardice involved the the I need all these guns to protect myself but they only hang out in safe places you know what I mean like like like the pence thing right where he's going to the NRA convention and they're like oh you can't bring guns in where he's gonna be well shouldn't they all have guns like it has it we judge the numbers safer there is 80,000 good guys with guns in Dallas heat should be the safest person in the world man and when they buy these commercials I said this in a joke a long time ago you know when they show them carrying their guns in like the grocery store or so like they never take their guns to the hood just why don't you open carry down on MLK just open carry you no never no they do it in the safe there they're all cowards there they're all cowards the few people who are badasses and I've done these military gigs and I've met these people that you would never know it the guys who are really and and women or whatever the ones trained who are truly badass who could kill you in a moment never brag about it they don't need to they don't need to you you know I I have a friend and he was like ex-special forces and when his daughter was 16 he said his his line was simple he said listen you're going out with my daughter anything you do to her I'm gonna do to you that's all we had to say didn't need a gun didn't need anything you just kind of like okay sir I understand what you're saying and but you can't this is comical to us and it's sad on some level but you know what it works it speaks to it speaks to his base yeah right it's better I love the acknowledgement that that man you scared takes face Jake should be scared he's sitting across from a psycho from Brian Kemp I would not be able to intimidate this teenager if I didn't have guns yeah two easy ways for young turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube
