okay from the outset I believe these allegations were extremely serious and bear heavily on Cavanaugh's characters is what Feinstein says well if that's the case why didn't you ask him about them why didn't you ask it he was right there in front of you under oath why didn't you ask him about them like legitimately I don't understand the line of reasoning these were so serious that I hid them for months for my Senate Democratic colleagues and then I released them at the last minute without any name attached and now I want a new hearing well just to clear his name we should give Cavanaugh a new hearing just to clear his name and just to get all the details we should have four to come and talk to the committee as well but it's the Democrats are good at this at this game they are very good with the last minute dropping of the smear which I mean frankly it looks like to me yeah again maybe this is all true maybe it is but the way Feinstein handles this makes it look like a smear that's what it that's just from any objective level Feinstein's behavior is the most questionable of anyone in this entire situation she says she says I believe these allegations were extremely serious however as we've seen over the past few days they also come in a price for the victim I hope the attacks and shaming of her will stop and this will be treated with the seriousness it deserves well fine team did not treat it with seriousness she hid it from her Senate colleague she did not report it to the FBI she did not report it to law enforcement she didn't report it to the White House she into any of those things she held it and she held it and she held it and then she really said it last minute and she expects the entire world to turn on the time she says I support mrs. Ford's decision to share her story and now that she has it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation the FBI has already said how the hell are we supposed to conduct an investigation there's no specific allegation about a specific time in place what are we supposed to do okay it may be beyond the statute of limitations and we also don't know what the criminal the federal crime here is this is probably a state crime at best but there was no transportation across state line so I'm not sure how this would be a man Act issue so what exactly is the federal what rises to the level of federal criminality or what statute would be implicated not even sure so this should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee Jeff Flake has come forward he says we can't vote until we hear more and the same thing is being said by a bunch of other politicians already so I am not I'm not sure what the what the story here is Lindsey Graham has issued a statement saying that he will listen to any statement wishes to make he says if Ford wishes to provide information to the committee I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all the other information we've received about Judge Cavanaugh he says if the committee is to hear from Miss Ford it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled and then he says I agree with the concerns expressed in the Judiciary Committee statement about the substance and process regarding the allegations in this latest claim against Judge Cavanaugh and he said it was disturbing that these uncorroborated allegations would surface now and Senator Grassley's office truck grassley on the Judiciary Committee he says the same thing he issued a statement he said it's disturbing these uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago during high school would surface on the eve of a committee vote after Democrats sat on them since July laugh ranking member finds scene and other Democratic Committee Democrats took this claim seriously they should have brought it to the full committee's attention much earlier well yes instead they said nothing during two joint phone calls with the nominee in August for days of lengthy public hearings and a closed session for all committee members with the nominee we're sensitive topics can be discussed and in more than 1300 written questions 65 senators met individually with Judge cabinets during a nearly 2 month period before the hearing began and yet this did this was not brought up right yet Feinstein's didn't try to share this with her colleagues ahead of many of these discussions it raised a lot of questions about Democrats tactics and motives to bring this to the rest of the committee's attention
