HAVE BEEN CHARGEDIN REGARD TO
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL PROBE .
OF THOSE 19 PEOPLE CHARGED,
FOUR OF THEM ARE FORMER TIME
CAMPAIGN ADVISERS.
>>ELIZABETH: ELLISON BARBER
WITH THE VERY LATEST.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>>LELAND: BLUE-COLLAR DEMOCRATS
PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S VICTORY.
ESPECIALLY IN STATES LIKE
PENNSYLVANIA.
THE SAME COAL MINERS AND
STEELWORKERS HEAD TO THE POLLS
FOR THE STATE PRIMARY ON
TUESDAY.
- - PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE
PENNSYLVANIA CHAMBER OF
BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY.
NICE TO SEE YOU SIR.
ARE THESE TARIFFS THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT ON CHINESE
STEEL AND SOME OF THE OTHER
NODS TO THE COAL INDUSTRY
ENOUGH TO KEEP THESE
BLUE-COLLAR DEMOCRATS VOTING
REPUBLICAN?
>> I THINK WE WILL SEE.
WE'VE GOT AN INTERESTING
PRIMARY COMING UP.
WE'VE GOT CONGRESSIONAL SEATS.
SOME SPECIAL ELECTIONS FOR
STATE HOUSE SEAT SO IT WILL BE
INTERESTING.
OF COURSE TARIFFS HAVE CUT BOTH
WAYS.
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, IF WE SEE
THIS DIRECTING MORE ATTENTION
AT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
ISSUES, WE THINK THAT WOULD BE
A BIG SUCCESS.
>>LELAND: WHEN YOU SAY THEY CUT
BOTH WAYS, ARE THERE INDUSTRIES
IN PENNSYLVANIA COMING OUT
AGAINST THESE TARIFFS?
OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE IN PLACES
LIKE IOWA AND ILLINOIS.
>> THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE
EXPRESSED CONCERN BECAUSE IT
HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER COSTS.
YOU SEE THE REACTION FROM THE
AGRICULTURE SIGN.
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE POSITIONING
ON BOTH SIDES.
WE CAN FOCUS ATTENTION ON SOME
OF THE THINGS WE'VE GOT TO PAY
ATTENTION TO.
FOR EXAMPLE, A NUMBER OF
MEMBERS HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT
PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF
INTERACTION WITH THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT FOR INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY.
THAT WOULD BE IN OUR
PERSPECTIVE, A BIG VICTORY.
>>LELAND: HOW ARE EMPLOYERS WHO
ARE - - BY PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
POLICIES.
AND BUSINESS OWNERS EXCITED
ABOUT THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.
HOW DO THEY TRANSLATE THEIR
EXCITEMENT AS EMPLOYERS DOWN TO
THEIR EMPLOYEES?>> GREAT
QUESTION.
AS A RESULT OF THE TAX REFORM
ACT, WE SEE IN PENNSYLVANIA THE
POSITIVE RESULTS OF THAT WITH
DOLLARS COMING IN.
WE SEE MORE INVESTMENT.
OUR JOB HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA IS
TO BRING ABOUT THOSE
DEPRECIATION CHANGES AND MAKE
THEM APPLICABLE AT THE STATE
LEVEL AS WELL.
THERE SIGNIFICANT EXCITEMENT
OVER THAT.
OVERMUCH OF THE DEREGULATION
OVERMUCH OF THE DEREGULATION.
>>LELAND: DO YOU SEE EMPLOYERS
AND REMEMBERS LINKING ALL OF
THAT THAT'S HAPPENING
AND REMEMBERS LINKING ALL OF
THAT THAT'S HAPPENING AND
PERHAPS MORE OVERTIME OR
PRAISES OR WHATEVER IT IS, MORE
INVESTMENT OR HIRING.
DIRECTLY TO THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION AND SAYING TO
THEIR EMPLOYEES, WERE GIVING
YOU THIS BONUS.
THE REASON WE ARE DOING IT IS
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WE HAVE MORE WORK, THE REASON
IS BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
ARE THEY MAKING THAT LINK?
>> I THINK THEY'RE MAKING IT
DIRECTLY TIED TO CERTAIN POLICY
DECISIONS AND LEGISLATIVE
DECISIONS.
TAX REFORM ACT.
DEREGULATION CHANGES HAVE BEEN
VERY POSITIVE.IF THAT BECOMES
A DIRECT LINK TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP.THEY ARE DIRECTLY TYING
IT TO ISSUES MORE SO THAN
ANYTHING ELSE.
>>LELAND: GIVE ME A SENSE OF
WHAT THE CANDIDATES THERE ARE
DOING.
ARE YOU SEEING CANDIDATES LINE
UP BEHIND THE SAME ISSUES AS
THEIR FIGHTING IT OUT IN THE
PRIMARY?
>> YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF
THAT.
HOW THAT BEARS OUT DEPENDS ON
WHETHER IT'S A REPUBLICAN OR
DEMOCRAT PRIMARY.
WE ARE VERY KEEN ON WATCHING
THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS.
THE STATE HOUSE SEAT SPECIAL
ELECTION IN THE AREA AND THE
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL HELD BY
DEMOCRATS FOR OVER HALF A
CENTURY.
IT WILL BE A VERY TOUGH FIGHT
THERE.
THERE'S A STRONG REPUBLICAN
RUNNING.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
IF THE REPUBLICAN CAN TAKE A
SEAT AT THE STATEHOUSE LEVEL
WHAT ABOUT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S
MANSION?
>>LELAND: YOU SEE THEM DUKING
IT OUT WITH INCREDIBLY TOUGH
ADS.
DO YOU WORRY THAT THE
REPUBLICANS WILL BE WEAKENED
AND YOU WILL HAVE A SHOT AT THE
GOVERNOR'S MANSION?
>> CERTAINLY A LOT OF MONEY HAS
BEEN SPENT IN THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY.
TWO OF THEM ARE LARGELY SELF
FUNDING WHERE THE THIRD HAS HAD
TO SCRAP AROUND FOR DOLLARS.
IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN
INTERESTING RACE.
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THE
WINNER OF THE PRIMARY COMES OUT
AFTER TUESDAY.
BUT AGAIN, A LOT OF MONEY HAS
BEEN SPENT OVER THE LAST FEW
MONTHS.
