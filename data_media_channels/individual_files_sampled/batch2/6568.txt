drama unfolded at a coffee bean and tea leaf in Riverside California after one male customer decided to disrespect one of the female employees there who was wearing a niqab now the video that we're about to show you is very difficult to watch especially when it comes to certain individuals who aggressively attack innocent women who are doing nothing but their jobs but nonetheless it's important to see it because there is a silver lining at the very end take a look so that's the first part of the video and he starts it off by asking her if it's Halloween because she's wearing a niqab and he's interface it's incredibly threatening by the way if if you're a young woman working at a coffee shop and you have someone in your face like that it is not a fun situation you're not feeling safe but I do commend her for standing up for herself and others will as well in in just a minute yes so she's a customer there she's in line and to get accosted like that it's weird right I mean like you hear about it in the news but when you see that happen in real life it's got to be deeply unsettling and then the people working there are also unsettle and so are some of the other customers so that brings us to the other part of the room right so will gets on second and you're right jank she was a customer but one of the employees there stood up for her which you're about to see take a look if you're a Christian let's talk about your Bible because you do know that you're viable in your Bible say he said I don't have a conversation with idiots well first of all you're the one who started it right you're the one who insulted her for no reason in the first place and you're the one who said you're I know about Islam you're going to kill me 1.6 billion people not million billion people on the planet and you think they all are not regular human beings they're not grandma's aunts babies men boys no they're all killers but she's the idiot yeah one more video take a look are you not serving him so that was the employee she refused to take his money told him to leave and when he was speaking to somewhere yelling at someone in the store that was actually a regular customer who was standing up for the Muslim customer and told him to leave he spoke to the press later and I'll give you this quote but I just I love the fact that people got involved and and helped defend that woman and get him out of that store so some folks might now be happy with what I'm gonna say next but so I'm agnostic and and I don't believe in religion and and I see that niqab and I think look we all get programmed and we get programming to certain things and we get ourselves to believe that it is the right thing to do and that we are doing it of our own volition if my daughter winds up in a niqab like that I meant from my perspective that would greatly bother me okay but am I gonna go to a random innocent woman who's wearing in a Cobb and it cost her are you crazy no no if I don't want my daughter wearing it then I start to my daughter right but to make assumptions about her and to and to attack her publicly verbally why why are you doing that why are you getting any a face and so whether you agree or don't agree with the religious principles that lead her to wear that or for him to think that all Muslims are dangerous and going to kill him and to be bigoted in that way but it you got to love that people said no you don't get to do that publicly and and stay here and I love that they stood up and said you're the one who started this and we're not gonna have it yeah I feel like especially over the last few years similar stories have come up and you don't see people standing up for their fellow Americans and it's it's disheartening because I think that we have an obligation to protect those who are disenfranchised in situations like that who are being attacked like that and again he was the one who provoked it he was the one who began it with or started it with you know the Halloween costume comment but I do want to just quickly and we've gone over this before but for those of you who haven't seen this conversation before I want to quickly respond to the whole new cop thing look I get it I also don't like the headdresses I don't like the niqab I admit I'm gonna be honest it makes me uncomfortable right but it doesn't make me uncomfortable because I see it as a threat it makes me uncomfortable because my my way of expressing myself is very different right but at the same time I I also don't like the idea that people have been brainwashed into wearing it and and I had a similar experience where a an extremely progressive male that's the way that he described himself kept arguing that I've been brainwashed because I wear heels and he's like you've been brainwashed by the patriarchy to wear heels like no I wear heels because I like heels I love heels I wear every day almost every day and it didn't matter what I said to him he was convinced that I was brainwashed and it was just so incredibly insulting you know what I'm saying I do and so look my overall point is that's why it's so great that we live in a free country you are wearing a cub we're gonna come if you want to believe in in your version of Christianity believe in your version of Christianity just keep it to yourself don't go around costing people over it I agree and and so that's that's the real issue here and that's why Barry Landa who's the regular at that coffee shop said why don't you get the eff out of here okay I love that he stood up for her because look we have very conservative people in the country we have very liberal people in the country we have agnostic slike me in the country we have very religious people in the country we've got to coexist that's exactly right and you know Barry also talked about how the woman in line who was being attacked is a student he thinks she's a medical student because she's there regularly reading medical books and she never causes any problems and so he really felt like it was you know it was his obligation to stand up for her he said it upset me anytime you see people explicitly hating people it's shocking yeah and and you know so many place have gone into trouble now for being discriminatory whether purposely or accidentally or unconsciously I should say it subconsciously but it was nice to see an establishment say no if you're gonna be hateful and disrupt this store we're not going to have it and we can refuse your service and in fact Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf a head office said we have the right to refuse service to any person who makes customers or team members feel endangered in any way and and there was a danger there it wasn't from the Muslim woman it was from the guy who
