>> THE DISGRACE, WHAT THIS
MAN HAS DONE.
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM
TEXAS --
>> I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
MANY TIMES DID YOU LOOK SO
INNOCENT INTO YOUR WIFE'S
EYE AND LIE TO HER ABOUT
LISA PAGE.
>> OH, MR. CHAIRMAN, IT'S
OUTRAGEOUS.
>> SHAME ON YOU,
MR. GOHMERT.
>> THIS SIN TOLERABLE
HARASSMENT OF THE WITNESS.
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
YOU NEED YOUR MEDICATION.
A LITTLE BIT LATER
CONGRESSMAN GOHMERT DID SAY
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THIS.
HE LOST HIS TEMPER WHEN HE
SAW THE LOOK ON HIS FACES A
IF HE WAS PUTTING SOMETHING
OVER ON ALL THE CONGRESSMAN
MEN AND WOMEN.
STEVE: DIAMOND AND SILK
TRUMP SUPPORTERS.
THEY JOIN US EVERY FRIDAY
FROM DIAMOND AND SILK
HEADQUARTERS.
LADIES, WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF
LOUIE GOHMERT'S COMMENT?
WAS HE OVER THE LINE WITH
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID HE
WAS.
WHAT DID YOU THINK GENERALLY
OF YESTERDAY'S 10-HOUR
GRILLING.
>> I THINK HIS COMMENT WAS
APPROPRIATE.
>> YES.
>> LISTEN, WE ARE TRYING TO
GET DOWN TO ANSWERS TO
FACTS.
WE WANT TO KNOW DOES THIS
MAN HAVE BIAS.
WERE YOU TRYING TO TAKE DOWN
A SITTING PRESIDENT OR WERE
PRESIDENT.
THIS RUSSIA COLLUSION STORY
THAT WAS MANUFACTURED BY YOU
WAS A LIE.
YESTERDAY, I THOUGHT THAT
PETER STRZOK SHOULD HAVE
BEEN TAKEN OUT IN HANDCUFFS.
THEY SHOULD HAVE ARRESTED
HIM.
YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS DONE TO
OBAMA OUR SYSTEM WOULD HAVE
BROKE LOOSE.
I WONDER IF DEMOCRATS WOULD
BE SINGING HIS PRAISES IF
PETER STRZOK HAD DONE THIS
ANSWERS NOW.
>> IF THIS WAS SO PERSONAL
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ON
A PERSONAL PHONE AND NOT A
CONSERVATIVES WERE NOT HAPPY
WITH HIM YESTERDAY THAT WAS
CLEAR IN HIS QUESTIONING.
DEMOCRATS, MANY OF THEM WERE
DEFENDING HIM.
ONE EVEN SAID HE DESERVES A
PURPLE HEART.
LISTEN TO.
THIS I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO
YOU FOR THE WAY YOU HAVE
BEEN TREATED BY THIS
COMMITTEE.
THEIR SIDE, THEY RESORT TO
ATTACKING LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THAT'S WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING
NOW.
>> THIS INVESTIGATION IS A
JOKE.
COURT.
IT IS A THREE RING CIRCUS.
>> WE SHOULD BE HONORING YOU
FOR THE WORK HAVE YOU DONE
>> IF I COULD GIVE YOU A
PURPLE HEART, I WOULD.
YOU DESERVE ONE.
AINSLEY: DIAMOND AND SILK,
WHO IS RIGHT IN THIS?
>> FIRST OF ALL, I FIND THE
HYPOCRISY ON THE LEFT IS
UNBELIEVABLE.
>> YEAH.
>> LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, THIS MAN TEXTS
HOW HE WANTED TO TAKE DOWN
DONALD TRUMP.
HAD YOU HE WANTED TO STOP
HIM.
WE ARE SITTING UP IN THERE
TRYING TO PRAISE HIM FOR
THAT I FIND IT APPALLING.
TO SAY ALL OF THE DEMOCRATS,
THOSE LAWMAKERS, ESPECIALLY
THOSE BLACK ONES, I HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH WHAT THEY ARE
SAYING.
YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE INJUSTICE
OF BLACK MEN BEING
RAILROADED, WE HAVE A
SITTING PRESIDENT BEING
RAILROADED BY THIS FBI AGENT
AND BY SOME IN THE FBI AND
THEY ARE SITTING UP HIM I
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AND
I'M SURE MOST AMERICANS HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT PETER
STRZOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN
TAKEN OUT AND STEEL AROUND
HIS WRISTS.
EVIDENCE SHOULD BE GOING TO
JAIL.
IS HE A CRIMINAL.
BRIAN: HE HAD TO DENOUNCE
HIS OWN WORDS AND MAKE
EVERYONE HE DIDN'T BELIEVE
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON IN
CAPITOL HILL.
YES, A CONGRESSMAN POO
YES, A CONGRESSMAN POCAN HAS
A PLAN TO ABOLISH ICE.
PAUL RYAN SAID THAT'S
INTERESTING.
LET DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS VOTE ON
ABOLISHING ICE.
GUESS WHAT THE CONGRESSMAN
GOES OH, THIS IS A TRAP.
YOU PUT THAT FORWARD, I'M
GOING TO VOTE AGAINST MY OWN
PLAN.
I DON'T GET IT.
DO YOU?
>> WE REALLY DON'T GET IT
THE DEMOCRATS DOES THIS A
WHOLE LOT.
THEY SAY A LOT OF THINGS
THEY WANT TO DO.
REALLY THEY DON'T WANT TO DO
IT.
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS PLAY
THE DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT HOW
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH ICE BUT
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ABOLISH
SLAVERY.
DEMOCRATS IS A BIG JOKE AND
IT'S TIME TO VOTE ALL OF
THEM OUT.
>> VOTE THEM OUT.
BRIAN: HAVE A CHANCE TO GET
A VOTE AND TURNING IT DOWN
NOT WANT TO ABOLISH ICE.
STEVE: LADIES, BEFORE DID
YOU GO, WHAT DID YOU THINK
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT -- IS HE
HALFWAY THROUGH HIS WORLD
DESTRUCTION TOUR.
TO GET SOME.
HE HAD HARSH WORDS FOR
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FOR
AMERICA.
WE ARE NOT WANT TO BE USED
AS THE CRUTCH ANYMORE.
AMERICA IS NOT THE WORLD'S
CRUTCH.
THEY HAVE TO STAND UP ON
THEIR FAIR SHARE.
>> OUR FIRST LADY
REPRESENTED AMERICA
BEAUTIFULLY.
SHE LOOKED AMAZING, VERY
STUNNING.
AINSLEY: THE YELLOW DRESS
WAS BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT ABOUT HIS NOMINEE FOR
THE SUPREME COURT ON MONDAY?
>> OH, WE'RE ABSOLUTELY JUST
HAPPY ABOUT IT LISTEN, I
HAVE A FEELING THAT HE IS
GOING TO HAVE TO PICK
ANOTHER ONE BEFORE IT'S OVER
>> LISTEN, WHATEVER THE
DEMOCRATS KEEP IS PERSIST.
IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK
