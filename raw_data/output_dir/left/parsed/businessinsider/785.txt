recently your good friend longtime good
friend Arnold Schwarzenegger Oh Arnold
came out and said he would be really
excited if you decided to run for
president again in 2020 in some capacity
I'm curious what your response what I
thought about that I thought god I don't
know what the heck's Arnold's doing
saying these things know I love Arnold
we've been friends for a very long time
I was very honored by it look in terms
of my political future I really don't
know I'm gonna complete my job as
governor I'm gonna get out of politics
at least for that year and a half and
I'm not sure I'll come back in but you
can't always talk about the future you
want to be a leader in whatever way you
can
I just don't know and that's okay for me
to be there
