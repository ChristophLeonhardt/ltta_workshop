and Affairs Gabe Sherman reports that the McGann news may have motivated the president's increasingly unhinged behavior of late noting a lot of what Trump is doing is based on the fact that mo is going after Don Jr a person close to the Trump family told me they're squeezing Don jr. right now so it's all happening at once right now from where I'm joined by the great Susan page Washington bureau chief for the USA Today Bret Stevens columnist for The New York Times Vivian Salama one else reporter for The Wall Street Journal and Dana Millbank commas for The Washington Post so we've got a heavyweight gang here I've got to start with Brent though Brett and you said something here you just tweeted this out in the modern means of communication I've been skeptical about the wisdom and merit of impeachment Cohen's guilty plea changes that the president's clearly guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors he should resign his office or be impeached and removed from office you want to elaborate on that rather dramatic final statement of yours on the guilt of the president well I don't think I think it's difficult to reach any other conclusion you know for for a long time I have wondered whether the evidence of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia would be so clear so black-letter as it were that it could rise politically to the level of impeachment and it could could convince a critical mass of Republican lawmakers to impeach and then of course convict the president but I think the Cohen story is in a different league altogether this is a clear black letter violation of campaign finance laws we have powerful evidence that the president was aware of these payments that and that later as as president he suppressed information about the payments until the Wall Street Journal to it's great credit broke the story that broke the stormy Daniels story earlier earlier this year now you can make an argument that these campaign finance laws are are vague or badly worded but then again they were used against for the prosecution of a former vice presidential nominee and and Senator John Edwards in a strikingly similar case I think Republicans ought to be asking themselves in a serious way if they believe in the rule of law and the separation of powers which as I remember our core conservative principles they ought to be considering impeachment as the constitutional mechanism to remove an unfit president who is committed or seems to have committed criminal acts of course we didn't get a commitment a conviction in the John Edwards case involving it the contribution from bunny melon and she gave money which I talked to her interviewed about she said she didn't think it was for a campaign purpose but clearly a lot of people in that jury did let me ask you about the interpretation here do you did you find convincing apparently you did the the sworn as testimony that's apparently only be forthcoming from Michael Cohen that the president only approved the payment of the 150 to mr. mcdougal and 130,000 to stormy Daniels says Stephanie Clifford but that he did so as a purposeful deliberate knowing campaign contribution talk about that because that's where it really gets into the law here and the criminality you know the president is known for stiffing all sorts of all sorts of people the fact that this payment took place so close to the election along with the fact that we have a recording which seems to indicate president's knowledge that he was committing he was committing a criminal act therefore the therefore the payments in cash and the elaborate methods to to disguise the payment all suggest to me criminal intent now remember we're not going if in the event of impeachment the standards aren't here are our political ultimately the jury is is the Senate we're not talking about a case that would stand or fall before before a jury but the weight of evidence seems clearly to suggest that the president knew exactly what he was doing by the way it's worth remembering that it back in 2000 2000 Bush nearly lost the election on account of the DUI this is this is essentially behavior really it's a tough question for you this may hit you in the solar plexus but you believe the Republican Party do you believe the Republican Party of 2018 is willing to do with the Republican Party back in 1974 was willing to do with Nick and act on the evidence do you have confidence that the Republican Party the grand old party will look at evidence like this and considered or where they do what they've been doing all along this sort of goose-stepping to trump it's awful what they use it but they've been doing it that the whenever he says they've accepted as an order well they changed from taking orders from Trump in this regimental manner or they actually look at evidence the way at least Republicans did in 74 your thoughts I I doubt it where's our Howard Baker to go to the president where's our George HW Bush who was then head of the RNC thank you well trouble is you've said something really dramatic about you think he ought to be impeached and then you've told me a really dassault Reno it won't do any good hey
