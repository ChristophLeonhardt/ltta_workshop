1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,330
North Korea claims
it’s destroyed

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,620
its only nuclear test site.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,260
Punggye-ri is an underground
facility within Mount Mantap.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,910
It has a tunnel network
with multiple entrances.

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,570
But what exactly did 
North Korea say it blew up?

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,910
Let’s take a closer look.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,769
It destroyed the entrances
to three tunnels:

8
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,410
The north entrance.

9
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,569
The west entrance.

10
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,309
The south entrance.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,900
And administrative
and housing buildings.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,030
It’s unclear if
these explosions

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,470
would prevent the site
from being used again.

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,840
No independent nuclear
monitors were present.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,480
The North Korean government
did invite a select group

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,590
of foreign journalists to watch.

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,270
But authorities strictly
controlled their trip.

18
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:38,895
The testing site borders
a massive prison camp,

19
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:40,550
where it's estimated
that thousands

20
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,520
of political prisoners
are in captivity.

21
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,485
The country has held
six nuclear tests

22
00:01:46,485 --> 00:00:00,000
in Punggye-ri
in the past 12 years.
