on Tuesday president from speaking from Judea and Samaria while standing next to master terrorist supporter Palestinian dictator Mahmoud Abbas tore into the Islamic terrorists responsible for the bombing of an ariana grande concert in Manchester on Monday evenings had so many young beautiful innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life I won't call the monsters because they would like that term they would think that's a great name I will call them from now on losers because that's what they are they're losers and we'll have more of them but they're losers just remember that some on the left predictably thought Trump's language was childish Oona Haj dari said Trump on the Manchester attack so many people killed by evil losers he sound like a high school girl reacting to her hair being pulled Alan Greenspan Trump sounds like a third-grader name-calling terrorist evil losers is this how a president is supposed to act here's the thing Trump is 100% absolutely positively correct every time there is Islamic terrorist attack people immediately jump to trying to understand the mind of the terrorists what drove him to blow himself up in a pizzeria or at a dance club what made him pick up a gun and mow down patrons in a gay bar why would you drive a truck through a Christmas market we all know the answer Islamic extremism but by constantly asking the question and then answering it with various laments about poverty or lack of opportunity we put the onus on ourselves to answer the charge implicit in terrorism that the terrorists are the actual victims that they've somehow been wronged here's the truth they haven't been wronged they are as President Trump says evil losers they deserve no answer they deserve no sympathy they require no explanation from us those who would murder children at a pop concert ought to be killed at the earliest available opportunity and we shouldn't bother trying to decrypt how the monsters were created that's because they're not monsters at all they're human being to believe evil things and they are losers who aren't winning any battles in heaven or on earth their names will disappear from history and their souls burn in hell eternally Trump is also right we must stop using the language of strength to describe those who act out of weakness if you have to blow up thirteen-year-old girls listen continue pop material you're not a powerful monster you're a worm a feeble piece of human refuse we should describe terrorists with contempt not filled them up in their own minds Islamic terrorists feed off the notion that the West lives in fear of them we live in fear of things they will do obviously but we don't live in fear of them because they're ridiculous puny human beings ridiculous and puny human beings can harm people - but handing them an unearned moniker like monster scary by nature is counterproductive and busi goes where no boost is necessary so good for Trump Trump knows well how does it mean people and make them feel smaller and Islamic terrorists should be made to feel small they should be scorned derided mocked treated as small they're not martyrs they're not warriors they're not victims they're evil losers I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so obviously horrific terrorist attack in Manchester UK last night we now know more about the the person who is responsible for this horrific terror attack apparently he was British born known to authorities prior to the attack his name was Abadie I guess in Psalm Inaba t 23 years old and the isis claims isis claims dobby was a Caliphate soldier they've claimed responsibility for the attack CBS News says that another person has been arrested in southern Manchester in connection with the attack officials believe only a single device was planted at the arena they've detonated another in South Manchester so I guess that there was another one that was out there and the it was one of the people who was killed was an eight-year-old girl they're a bunch of an 18 year old woman in 26 year old John Atkinson of the injured 59 were taken to the hospital of which at least 12 were children and we always forget by the way that when there's a bombing like this the people who are injured not just people who are wounded the people are injured sometimes have their lives ruined because if you catch a bolt to the brain it's going to destroy your life if you lose leg if you are if you're grievously wounded in sensitive areas of the body then it can destroy your life whether or not you die we tend to look at the death toll but not at the wounded toll and that's a mistake we'll talk more about all of this but first we want to say thank you to our sponsors over at zip

my phone starts buzzing and it starts buzzing because the attack is happening but CNN isn't covering the attacks CNN is covering the Trump Russia allegations will get to all of that a little bit later but if you look at the media news this morning you can see that while Fox News has been amply covering the Manchester attack a lot of the other networks have already moved on from the Manchester attack and they're talking about John Brennan former head of the CIA speaking with Congress or they're talking from Prussia and you can see the priorities that the media have here regardless of what you think of President Trump regardless of whether you think that he is corrupt or whether he colluded which there's no evidence he did regardless of what you think the big news story yesterday was none of the Trump Russia stuff it was the fact that there was an evil terrorist who blew himself up in the middle of an ariana grande concert and murdered 22 people and another 59 injured that is the big story of yesterday if Barack Obama were president I promise you the media would be covering it while the wall because Trump is president they cover it sporadically so they can say that they did it but they don't cover at Walden Wall in any serious way and Trump does get credit for calling this out in a way that Obama never did I think that Trump is right on point when he says what he says about these people being evil losers here as President Obama making this comment is from Bethlehem news clip 13 so many young beautiful innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life I won't call them monsters because they would like that term they would think that's a great name I will call them from now on losers because that's what they are they're losers and we'll have more of them but they're losers just remember that and I think that he's totally right and this is something worthwhile for Trump's a guy called Mo Bamba for obvious it's Trump and Trump is 100% right when the left starts ripping on him for saying stuff like this this is why Trump is more popular among a certain segment of the population than the Democrats and you can certainly see that because Trump does something that I think the rest of us need to recognize it's not our job to identify why evil people believe evil things it is our job to destroy the evil people you know in the best movie villain of all time is the Joker in Batman and one of the reasons the Joker in Batman is such a great movie villain is because you don't know his background two or three times in the film The Joker starts to tell about how he his face is carved up and tells different stories and the purpose of that is to demonstrate that true evil doesn't need a rationale true evil doesn't need a reason now we know the rationale for Islamic terrorism and it is an interpretation of Islam that justifies jihad we know that that's a widespread interpretation of Islam this is not a minor strain inside Islam there probably tens of millions of people at the least to believe that maybe hundreds of millions who believe it but that said what Trump is doing here by saying listen I'm not interested in doing a psychological study a psychological profile of these losers is he's demeaning them in a way that they ought to be demean the left meanwhile is trying to come up with reasons why the West is actually responsible for this so we can solve all of the problems I think that's because for a lot of folks on the Left they're looking for a solution to terrorism that doesn't involve just killing as many terrorists as humanly possible on the right people seem pretty willing to go - okay let's go as many of these people as possible to humiliate them let's destroy them let's what month basically are on the left it's got to be well if we just were nicer in a certain way if we just if we just focused on income inequality if we just focus on global warming maybe all of that would change so take for example Chelsea Clinton so Chelsea Clinton is being pushed by the left and some newfangled Democrat who's going to come along and save them listen if your last hope is Chelsea Clinton folks you're done as a party if Chelsea Clinton is your great hope for a resurrection as part of your finish she was discussing it some sort of Women's Conference the the inter linkage when she called the interconnections between child marriage right we're talking about the rape of small children and climate change watch watch this is how Democrats tend to think about terrorism does how they tend to think about radical Islam I think it's part of this broader network of thinking and it's just idiotic which is to be able to kind of carry multiple concerns and both our head and our heart I'm just listening kind of to the concerns around education and climate change kind of women's health you know child marriage access to technology all of those are of course interconnected we have to focus on each of them kind of in their interconnectedness and also its of individual outrages occasion Jenny looks but meaningless bullcrap and this is why when Trump said during the campaign bomb the crap out of them except didn't use word crap a lot most Americans I would say resonated to that because what the hell is this supposed to mean if the left's perspective on terrorism is well it's all interconnected you know technological change and climate change and child marriage okay you explain to me how I do not having access to an iPhone is responsible from raping an 11 year old girl you slain that one to me Chelsea Clinton why it is that we shouldn't respond to that guy by locking him up or killing him as opposed to I don't know talking about whether we can expand broadband to Pakistan like but this is why people don't resonate to the left on these issues this is why when people tend to think about threats foreign they immediately resonate to to what people on the right tend to say Chelsea Clinton continued along these lines she she says Islamophobia is not an option I think though that we also have to recognize particularly at this moment that sexism is not an opinion as long as though be is not an opinion racism is not an opinion homophobia is not an opinion jingoism is not an opinion and so I think we in our posture of listening also have to get comfortable with standing up and speaking out be because I also great kind of it for those of us that have been blessed and by definition all of us on this and the stage today has been blessed there is a responsibility with kind of giving voice to the voiceless but also using our voices okay this is insanity I just want to show you this is footage from the explosion last night in Manchester here's what it looked like in Manchester last night are we looking at is this the lobby party yeah so that was that's actually in the station so as we was coming out the arena just before ariana finished along song to try and beat the rush we come out a few minutes early with Queen just out of where the box office is situated in the arena and then you go into the train station as we get to the top of the stet we heard the biggest explosion it was literally about 20 meters from where we stood everyone started panicking with it we initially thought it was a terrorist attack because that's just what what were what you think because of what's going on we heard what we was actually in the building when one-one-one-one went off and then as we left that's when the second explosion was to take a little once we'd already left the building and we just ran to the car like didn't stop running there was lots of parents stood there and I said look at them all waiting for the kids because I've never seen it like that before like so many people so obviously they was waiting for the children to come all the way in the people will be was the people because 20 seconds there and was watching for the steps that's when it that's when it went off and that before video not to make you cry so it's it's the parents waiting for their kids to come out of the concert as parents do with things like this riffing it's just horrific and we're hearing Islamophobia is not an opinion jingoism is not an opinion so basically I'm hearing from Chelsea Clinton in these two clips and obviously we were done right before the terrorist attack what doesn't change the underlying idea in any way because we've had terrorist attacks before and we'll have them again when Chelsea Clinton says all of these things are interconnected right climate change and child marriage and and then she says but you know we really have to crack down and Isla is Islamophobia and jingoism hey when I watched the footage of young girls being blown up Manchester yeah I have a three and a half year old daughter I have a one-year-old son the idea that anyone would target them in terrorist attack makes me so enraged I want a bullet through the brain of these Islamic terrorists it now forever okay these people should be tortured in hell they should never stop burning in Judaism we're not big on everlasting hell whatever we believe about everlasting hell I hope it applies to the fullest extent to the people who did these sorts of things and I'm not interested in your explanations about interconnectedness and technological innovation and Islamic terrorism I'm not interested in your justifications for Islamic terrorism I'm not interested and why you think that my expression about terrorism my opinions of radical Islam should be forbidden but we should worry about interconnectedness and justification when it comes to the people who blow themselves up I'm not blowing myself up I'm trying to stump in favor of killing the people who are going to blow us up but according to Hillary according to Hillary Clinton's daughter according to Chelsea the big problem here is that Islamophobia and jingoism are going to are going to rise they're not even opinions we should restrict those opinions in fact there's a story today there's a woman in Britain who is now being basically prosecuted or investigated by the by the authorities in Britain because she had the temerity to point out that there's a connection to Islam here that there's a connection to Islamic terrorism which of course there is it this is why no one takes a left seriously when it comes to terrorism now with all of that said the rights going to have to do better in providing actual solutions to terrorism now some of the solutions that have been proposed some of the things like president Trump's Muslim ban which he proposed a while back you know that's I still think I don't know that's gonna be effective because I'm not sure how you screen that but the idea of restricting immigration from Islamic countries without being able to vet people absolutely 100% correct the idea that we're going to have to take a militant stance on Isis and wipe them off the face of the earth and we can't wait around let the Saudis do it cuz they're not going to we can't wait around let the Turks do it because they're not going to we can't wait around for Iran to do it cuz they're not going to if you want these sorts of things to stop there's going to have to be some contingent policy and we're going to talk about that in just a second is all going to have to be a change in the mindset of a lot of people on the on on all sides of the political aisle with regard to the civilizational battle that we face Trump was wrong yesterday when he said it's not a clash of civilizations it certainly is a clash of civilizations that doesn't mean everyone in the Muslim world is on the side of the Islamic terrorist civilization but there is a civilization that is rife with Islamic terrorism and that the West pretends doesn't exist but we'll talk about that in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at M VMT so do

left on Islamic terrorism even the right is not willing to acknowledge in many in many cases a basic fact and that is the war by radical Islamic civilization against the West is broader than we like to pretend it is this is what I was complaining about as far as president from speech yesterday in Saudi Arabia he talked about Islamic extremism and then he sort of excused the Saudis and he excused the in the United Arab Emirates and today he was making the statement that he made about how terrorists are evil losers he made that while standing next to Mahmoud Abbas the dictator of the Palestinian Authority Malcolm Abbas is a terrorist Mahmoud Abbas is a guy who financed the 1972 Munich Olympic terror attacks the Munich Massacre Mahmoud Abbas is a fellow who in 2015 like a year and a half ago said that every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem by a Palestinian is worthwhile and they are martyrs to Allah okay Trump was standing next to that guy yesterday he was standing next to him when he said all of this and so when Trump says we'll clip three that Israel and its Arab neighbors they have a common interest in stopping terrorism no that's really not super true many Muslim nations have already taken steps to begin following through on this commitment there is a growing realization among your Arab neighbors that they have common cause with you and the threat posed by Iran and it is indeed a threat there is no question about that I thank both you and Prime Minister Netanyahu for your commitment to achieving peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians I also look forward to discussing the peace process with Palestinian President Abbas okay now this is ridiculous Abbas is not going to take part in a peace process because the minute he signs a deal his own people kill him he is currently in a unity government with the terrorist group Hamas is currently in a unity government with the terrorist group Islamic Jihad now the West likes to pretend they like to pretend that terrorism against Israel yesterday well Trump was in Jerusalem there was an attempted terror attack in Jerusalem but with the left and the right everywhere is this common attempt not not all of the right but some of the right there's this attempt to carve off Israel from the battle against terrorism is that when a Palestinian blows up a bunch of children in a pizzeria or when a Palestinian shoots a kid in a car that's somehow difference in kind from the same thing happening in the UK or France or Germany that's just silly there are a lot of people who like to say well it's a territorial conflict the palestinian-israeli conflict it's a territorial thing no it isn't because of Israel were to give up every slice of territory all of the battle wouldn't end Dave Israel were to give up Jerusalem to the Palestinians you know all of it you know what happened the Palestinians would immediately seek to kill as many Jews as possible using that terrorists territory as a launching point we know that because that's exactly what they did in 1967 and in 1973 so the idea that they are that this is a territorial conflict here's the rule about territorial conflicts if it were a territorial conflict if you have a territorial conflict it can be solved by territorial solution if a territorial conflict cannot be solved by territorial solution it's not actually a territorial conflict it's a religious conflict and yet the right and the left apparently have this common stake in pretending that terror against Jews in Israel is somehow markedly different than terror against British people at a concert in the UK and that is just not true that's why you'll see Chris Matthews over on MSNBC basically suggesting that Israel deserves terrorism even though the rest of the West doesn't but when you go over there to deposit it in territories sure there are terrorists and they should be punished by the people over there that's where I think they've got to act then you have these Palestinian business guys regular guys like us just regular people they're peaceful they are being bothered every day of their life to try to business they have to sit there when some Israeli soldier pointing his gun at them for three or four hours at every checkpoint they're humiliating those people and once I call they're going to blow Jim I don't want any sort so the idea is that if you are forced as a businessperson to go through the rigors of a check by TSA because there are terrorists getting on the flight you're going to go and commit a terrorist attack the idea that Israel is somehow at fault here again I know that the left is a little bit easier from the left because what also blames the West for a lot of terrorism the West but the idea overall that the conflict between Israel and Palestinians is somehow different and that there is common cause between Israel and the Palestinians in fighting terror is just absolute nonsense Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had this to say this morning regarding the Manchester attack it is 100% true even though people don't want to hear it I want to thank you especially today for your and as you said this morning mr. president funding and rewarding terrorism must end standing next to you President Abbas condemned the oolitic attack in Manchester well I hope this heralds a wheelchair change because if the attacker had been Palestinian and the victims had been Israeli children the suicide bombers family would have received a stipend from the Palestinian Authority that's Palestinian law that law must be changed and not only that American taxpayers will be paying for because we get to age the Palestinian Authority then funneled the terrorists the tailor for Sachs which stops all this should immediately be implemented in the United States develop the terror attack in Manchester is not about Israel but terrorist attacks in Israel are about Manchester and the idea that all of this is in part of a broader civilizational battle with radical Islamic terrorism that is mistake and by ignoring that mistake all you end up doing is promulgating the terrorism by pretending away Abbas in Saudi Arabia that they're all allies with us against against things like what happened in Manchester all you end up doing is ignoring one of the sources of the real problem and long term listen we don't have the power to topple every bad regime we don't have the ability or the willingness to throw everybody out of power who we don't like nor should we because the fact is that sometimes what replaces them is worse but if we don't keep in mind who our enemies are we're not going to take cautious policies we're going to make foolish mistakes like signing money over to bad guys and then we're shocked when that comes back to bite us in the ass whether it's on 9/11 or whether it's in Israel or whether it's in Manchester okay well I want to talk a little bit more about all of this house we want to talk about
