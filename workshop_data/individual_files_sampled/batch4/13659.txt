the case against Brett Kavanaugh is is falling apart more and more with each passing hour and the allegations are just unraveling and the smear merchants who concocted this character assassination crusade are looking around it seems for a way to jump off the bandwagon before it's too late they're like that gif and it is gift by the way not jiff of Homer Simpson backing away into the bushes that's kind of like what some of the Democrats are doing I think when you look at everything that's happened when you look when you look at everything that's happened with with with this Brett Kavanaugh thing you see all of the problems with the me2 movement kind of encapsulated in this in this in this one thing now all of those problems and they're very significant problems the mutant movement they didn't just rear their ugly head for the first time this week you they've been there all along but if somehow you never noticed them before I think now anyone with two brain cells can can see because all of those all of the the problems have been sort of illustrated in the last one or two weeks enough that even just this isolated by itself even just the last one or two weeks I think would be enough should be enough to discredit the me2 movement and and maybe hopefully you'll cause us to look away from that and return some some some semblance of rationality and sanity to the conversation about sexual assault and harassment because it is a very important conversation and that's my precisely my problem with the me2 movement is that the mutant movement has ended the conversation about it didn't start the conversation it hasn't enhanced the conversation or facilitated it it has ended the conversation because we're not allowed to have a conversation anymore about it with the me2 movement now there's a narrative and all you're allowed to do is stick to the narrative you're not allowed to actually you know ask any questions or make any points or anything like that so hopefully now we most of us can see that in fact I think not again not just from the last two weeks but but in general I think there are at least there are at least six significant problems with the me2 movement and six good reasons why it should end which isn't to say that our opposition to sexual assault should end because I don't know about you I've always been opposed to it I didn't need the meet to movement to tell me to be opposed to sexual assault I've always been opposed to it but front from the beginning so I'm not saying that should end but this thing called the me2 movement should end and I'll give you six reasons for that number one me too does not allow sexual assault allegations to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis so the first and biggest problem with the me2 movement is that it is a movement and because of me - every alleged instance of sexual impropriety is lumped with every other alleged incident in the instance and they're all kind of mixed together into this - and each separate allegation is then not seen as a separate allegation but as an element or ingredient in this - and that's a pretty big problem if we're gonna get to the truth of any particular case and if we're gonna be fair to the accuser and fair to the accused we cannot look at each case as another plot point in an overall narrative we cannot see you know Brett Kavanaugh we can't see Brett Kavanaugh in the context of this this movement or this narrative you have to look at Brett Kavanaugh as an individual person and Kristine Ford's an individual person and their case is an individual case that's how it has to be evaluated Brett Kavanaugh is not just the man character accused of abusing the woman character as if these are just broad sort of archetypes no he's an individual person and she's an individual person and their situation is an individual situation which has absolutely no relationship to Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby or any other famous pervert got no relationship whatsoever they're not connected even a little bit so when you say me - when you say oh well this is Brett Cavanaugh's me - thing you have just taken him and put him alongside all these other guys when there's they are not this is not some comes conspiracy among all of them okay he's completely separate situation you know this week I've heard several women say in the media in fact one of Christine Ford's friends was interviewed by CNN last night and she has no knowledge whatsoever of this of this situation which actually should tell you something the fact that she's a friend of Christine Ford had never heard about this before but you know she was saying this thing that I've heard other women say other you know women that are supporters of the me2 movement where they've said well you know I I don't know Brett Kavanaugh is guilty but but I do know that those kinds of boys you know growing up I did know those kinds of boys and I was aware of those kinds of situations happening but see that you know I'm sorry that you knew those kinds of but if we're talking about those kinds of boys as in rapists and if you knew about those kinds of situations I'm sorry you know that's that's unfortunate I'm I'm sorry that you grew up around those kinds of boys but but but but see that's not how we can we don't that's the problem we can't look at this situation it through that lens Brett Kavanaugh is not a kind okay he's not a kind of person he's just a person and this thing if it happened which I don't think it did he's not a kind of thing it's just it's a thing we're dealing with specific people and specific circumstances it is impossible to be objective and rational if we're looking at it through a narrative lens if we're looking at it oh well he's just that kind and this is that kind of situation no that's that's not right second thing the second problem me too me too does not acknowledge the possibility that women can lie as we have established it is a problem when we start making movements and narratives out of our up out of out of our opposition to sexual assault like we're all opposed to sexual assault fine but when you make that into a movement when you make it into a narrative it's a problem and it's even more a problem in this case when you consider what the narrative is telling us namely that women don't lie about these kinds of things believe women is what the me to Crusaders shout they say believe women well no I don't believe women I Got News for you I don't believe women I don't believe men either I believe individual people regardless of their gender if there are good and empirical reasons to believe them so no I don't I don't have a blanket policy of believing women anymore than I have a blanket policy of believing men or a blanket policy of believing you know people with brown hair it just doesn't make it make demux no that has no bearing there their you know their biological sex and their you know the their demographic has no bearing on whether or not they're lying so it's just the stupidest thing in the world believe women what do you mean but women lie just like men lie you know men and women all people lie so if you're gonna say well women don't lie well of course they lie everyone lies now whether or not a particular woman has lied about this particular thing well now we got a look at the situation and come to that determination but you can't make it you can't have any blanket assumptions about which gender is more likely to lie it just doesn't make any sense so when you say and I've also been told you know someone I saw someone a Facebook link to an article that the title of the article is women don't lie about rape well you know I may as well say that men don't rape just because most men would never rape doesn't mean that any specific man who was accused of rape didn't rape just like just because most women would lie about rape that doesn't mean that every single woman who says that she was raped isn't lying see it's just this is a very obvious point that the me2 movement has intentionally obscured you know what is its dog this is what it is I'll tell you it's Dogma okay when you have movements when you have ideological movements what you end up with is dogmas you end up with essentially points of doctrine and you just with with something like this you cannot go into it with a Dogma or with a doctrine and so one of the doctrines of of the me2 movement is that women don't lie which is which is insane first of all but obviously when that's your doctrine there's you can't there's no way for you to you're not an Allah you can't analyze the situation you're not analyzing it what you're doing is you're just taking it and you're applying your doctrine to it and you're making a proclamation number three me too equates every kind of sexual misdeed with every other kind and so we've already talked about how you know the me2 movement equates all different men you know equates every kind of man with every other kind to all accused men are lumped together and equated with each other so that happens but then also every kind of accusation every kind of alleged sexual impropriety is lumped and mixed together with every other so that a woman who alleges actual rape is mixed with women alleging inappropriate comments or alleging that a man groped them or alleging that a man came on to them too aggressively or that a man made awkward attempts at flirting you know all of these very very different sorts of things are put together and the me2 movement mixes them all together again there's that stew and this is just another this is me I'm mixing the stew right now if you're not that's what this is this is the me to stew but all of these all of these things are mixed together in the stew and it just so you can't make any sense of it but they don't belong you know rape is one thing so you've got like on the spectrum you've got rape over here it's it's obviously the worst kind of sexual abuse one of the worst things in the world that exists and so you've got that and then way down over there you've got like inappropriate comment or a man clumsily trying to come on to a woman or flirt with her you know so that's all the way over there and there in fact they're not even really part of the same spectrum to say you know to put them on a spectrum at all is to insinuate that well if a man is flirting with a woman he's only a few steps away away from rape as if that will logically lead to that which it doesn't so there actually is no spectrum in between these things there's that and then complement and there's a wide cavern and a gulf and then over there you've got flirting the problem with the mutant movement is that they have created this spectrum and they've put all these things on to it and then they've also kind of bunched them together so that they're almost indistinguishable so that's a problem number two number four I should say I don't know how to count number for the Mewtwo movement is tainted by politics now it's true that they've gone after liberal men in Hollywood so give them credit for that but it is they've also mostly left alone liberal men in politics and so obviously with this Cavanaugh thing this is 100 percent politically motivated and once you know when you claim that you're on a crusade against sexual assault once it becomes apparent that your crusade is politically motivated well then the crusade is completely discredited so we could even leave aside everything else I've said so far this point alone is you have discredit the mutant movement has discredited itself by jumping on the Cavanaugh thing that that alone because because of because of the politics in it because we all know that if this was Merrick garland garland or if this was any you know if this was any Democratic nominee this none of this would have happened we all know that and we also know that and this is not oh this is not a what about thing this is not what about ism but it's just pointing out the political nature of the me2 movement because then you also have Bill Clinton who was very credibly accused of brutally raping a woman and was also very credibly accused of abusing many other women in many different ways and yet he still has not had his me to moment as he because it's politically motivated number five I think this is really important to me to movement infantilizes women now it's true of course that there have been many women who have been raped and and then have come forward and they've been shamed and smeared for coming forward and that's a horrible evil thing horrible and evil absolutely evil and those women are victims and they're survivors and in more than one sense but you notice how now even a woman who's sexually harassed or a woman who has to rebuff advances of a man or will say even a woman who's let's say you know groped or something which is a horrible thing don't get me wrong but but now even those women we call them survivors they're survivors you know Dennis Prager wrote a column he was in the National Review yesterday where he made the point that like it used to be survivor meant that you survived the Holocaust okay survivor meant that you either you survived you know cancer or something but now a woman a woman here's an inappropriate comment from her boss in 1973 and we say she's a survivor you know it's just it's it's ridiculous it's infantilizing number one number two it is it is unfair to the women who are actually survivors the women who have really been abused assaulted raped those women are survivors as I said in more than one way but once again you have this lumping together that happens and so we talk about we say well the me to survivors and we understand that when we say that we could be talking we could be talk about women who are raped we could also be talking about a woman who you know in 1987 had an uncomfortable exchange with with a guy at work we could be talking about that as well and it's just it's ridiculous frankly and also you know the other problem with and this is part of the infantilizing where we're not allowed to expect women to take any responsibility for their own actions and this is just a conversation you're not allowed to have because of the mutant movement but in some of these cases you hear about cases where a woman is in an awkward situation but chooses not to remove herself from it like louis c.k says i'm gonna take my pants off and start touching myself and the woman and the women decide to stay just to sit there rather than just getting up and leaving the room or even though the Aziz Ansari thing where a woman comes up to the to the to his apartment with him chooses to do these dip various sexual things later says that she felt uncomfortable and awkward but she didn't want to leave well but that's you know if we're not infantilizing people then what we need to say is well in that situation you need to just leave you need to take some responsibility for yourself and if you're not if you're awk if you're if you're uncomfortable which I don't blame you for me uncomfortable leave the situation but because of the mutant movement we're not allowed what I'm saying right now I'm not allowed to say it even though we all know it's true because we all think the same things when you hear some of these cases you think well why don't you leave what are you doing why don't you just pick it up and leave it's not to say it's not to blame you it's it's not to say it's your fault the man who's being a pig and being disgusting he deserves 100% of the blame but if we're actually trying to empower people then we need to also say listen if you're in an uncomfortable spot leave and then the sixth thing is me to is just mass hysteria and this just ties back to everything else I've said that you know with the me to movement it's it does not allow for a reasonable discussion doesn't allow for a discussion at all you're not allowed to make any of the points that I just made especially the last one about you know about about taking responsibility and being accountable for your actions you're not allowed to say that you're not allowed to ask very basic questions because it's a stereo and that's what a stereo is all about where you have to jump on the bandwagon and pick up the pitchfork and go in whatever direction the mob is going if you try to say hey well hold on a second if you try to you know introduce a little nuance subtlety to the conversation and say hey I agree that there are some horrible things happening to women we got to talk about that but you know what about this point well you're not allowed to do that so when you take all these factors into consideration and you see what happens when they all come together and land on a guy look what happened to Brett Kavanaugh I think when you consider that it's clear to me that the me to movement just needs to end which again does not mean that our opposition to sexual assault ends I don't need the me to movement for that I don't need them to tell me that it's wrong I don't think you do either but this thing that we call the me to movement I think has way overstate its welcome at this point and it's doing more harm than good thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
