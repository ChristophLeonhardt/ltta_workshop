WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WITH DOZENS

19
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:44,795
OF BUDGET CUTS?

20
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,663
WHAT DOES THE CITY LOOK LIKE

21
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:48,832

00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:50,200

BY BORDER PATROL A FEW DAYS

30
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:03,480
EARLIER.

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,083
THEY WERE PROCESSED, GIVEN A

IN HIS BRAND-NEW BOOK, "S SHOW"

38
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,168
I GUESS IS WHAT WE WILL CALL IT.

39
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,302
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

40
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,272
IT'S A FASCINATING JOURNEY THAT

41
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:30,974
YOU HAVE BEEN ON.

42
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:31,975
CHRONICLE CORRUPTION ALL OVER

00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:36,246
ON ALL OVER THE PLACE.

45
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:40,150
REMEMBER THE NEW ORLEANS

46
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,186
MAYOR WENT TO PRISON FOR PATTING

MONEY.

49
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:46,523
YOU HAVE VISITED PLACES WHERE SO

50
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,992
MANY OF THESE OFFICIALS END UP

51
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:49,393
IN JAIL.

52
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:52,563
>> THE WAY I SEE IT, ALL OF

53
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:53,096
AMERICA IS ANGRY.

54
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,832
ONE OVERRIDING THING THAT THEY

55
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:55,966
ARE ANGRY ABOUT IS THE

56
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:56,366
GOVERNMENT.

57
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,768
PICK YOUR LEVEL.

58
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,503
THE POLICE, THE MAYOR, THE

59
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,972
COUNTY, THE PRESIDENT.

60
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:03,974
THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP

61
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:06,176
ARE NOT THE ONLY FORGOTTEN ONCE.

62
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,779
IF YOU ADD TRUMP PLUS BERNIE,

63
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,747
THAT'S ABOUT 70 OR 75%.

64
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,382
AND IF THEY WERE WOMEN, IT'S

65
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,751
PROBABLY 80 OR 85%.

66
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,887
THINGS AREN'T GOING WELL NO

67
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,790
MATTER WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING,

68
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,692
WE ARE NOT SAVING, THE WAGES ARE

69
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:22,426
NOT GOING OUT.

70
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:24,461
THE NEW JOBS THAT ARE BEING

71
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:28,632
CREATED, THEY ARE MAKING NEW

72
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:30,567
BEDS AND WIPING PEOPLE'S

73
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,969
BOTTOMS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M

74
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,904
SAYING, BUT YOU CAN'T PUT A KID

75
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,773
THROUGH COLLEGE WITH THAT.

76
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,575
THE ONE YOU WENT INTO FERGUSON,

77
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,177
TALKED ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN WHO

78
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:42,713
SAVED THAT GUY'S SHOP.

79
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:43,881
THEN YOU WENT LOOKING FOR THIS

80
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,816
YOUNG MAN NAMED DJ.

81
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:47,951
IN THE MAN SAID, I COULDN'T GIVE

82
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:48,552
HIM A JOB.

83
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:50,387
IT STRIKES ME THAT THERE WAS

84
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:51,655
THAT LACK OF INTEGRITY AND

85
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:53,357
RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER.

86
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:54,191
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS DON'T

87
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:55,993
HAPPEN AS MANY TIMES AS THEY

88
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:57,394
SHOULD, WHERE HE WOULD SAY TO

89
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,996
HIMSELF, I NEED TO DO RIGHT BY

90
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:01,565
THE CICADA, HE REALLY HELPED ME

91
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:01,832
OUT.

92
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:03,400
THOSE MOMENTS SEEM TO DISAPPEAR.

93
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,068
HOW DO WE GET THEM BACK?

94
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,404
NOT TO SAY THERE AREN'T GOOD

95
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:08,605
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

96
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,341
>> WHILE PART OF IT IS THE

97
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:11,642
MEDIA.

98
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:15,245
WHAT WE CAN DO, THAT GUY'S NAME

99
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,146
IS DJ.

100
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:17,581
AND I TRIED TO FIND HIM.

101
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:20,417
IF YOU ARE WATCHING, CALL ME.

102
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,385
I RESPECT YOU.

103
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:24,254
THIS IS A 25-YEAR-OLD GUY, DARK,

104
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:27,591
HANDSOME, DREADLOCKED.

105
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:28,992
INSTEAD OF USING THE TELEPHOTO

106
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:31,161
LENS, WE WENT IN THERE, THERE

107
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:31,995
WERE PEOPLE TRYING TO LOOT THE

108
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,965
STORE AND LIGHT IT ON FIRE AND

109
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,166
HE TRIED TO STOP THEM.

110
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,769
HE SAID, THIS IS NOT RIGHT, THIS

111
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,604
IS NOT WHAT WE DO.

112
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,407
HE DIDN'T PLUG THEM, BUT HE

113
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:43,707
TRIED.

114
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:44,975
POLICE HAVE ABANDONED THE THING

115
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,910
AND HE WENT IN THERE AND TRIED.

116
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,379
I THINK THAT IS WHO WE ARE.

117
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,981
ONCE HE LEFT THAN THE CROWD

118
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:56,587
THROUGH BATTERIES AT US AND HIT

119
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:59,556
US WITH TRAFFIC CONES, AND ME

120
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,991
AND MY PARTNERS MATT PHILLIPS

121
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,626
AND BOB SHUTTLE BAUER, THEY ARE

122
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:04,194
PART OF THIS BOOK.

123
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,796
WE WANTED TO SHOW DJ.

124
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:08,599
THE MORE WE CAN SHOW DJ, AND IN

125
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,234
THOSE HARD TIMES IN AMERICAN

126
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:13,437
OURSELVES AND RESPECT HIM.

127
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:14,271
THAT SHOP OWNER THAT DID NOT

128
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:18,976
GIVE HIM THE JOB AFTER THE FIRST

129
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:19,976
BURNING, THEY BURNED IT TO THE

130
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:23,747
GROUND.

131
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:25,182
>> Martha: WHAT I FIND TALKING

132
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,850
TO PEOPLE IS, THE ONES WHO SEEM

133
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,785
TO HAVE IT, THEY DON'T REALLY

134
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,187
STAY THAT LONG.

135
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:30,954
THEY GO TO WASHINGTON FOR A FEW

136
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,156
YEARS AND THEN THEY SAY, YOU

137
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,391
KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

138
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,827
TO CHANGE THE STATE.

139
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:38,929
IT'S WAY TOO BIG, TOO OUT OF

140
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:39,963
CONTROL.

141
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,798
IT MAKES YOU WONDER, IS AT THE

142
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:42,599
FALL OF ROME?

143
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,202
DO WE EVER FIX IT OR IS THIS

144
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,670
HISTORY 100 YEARS FROM NOW THAT

145
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,005
SAYS, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE

146
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:52,175
AS WE ARE GOING DOWN?

147
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:55,112
>> NOT TO BE TOO BIBLICAL BUT

148
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:58,081
EVERYTHING THE WORLD BUILDS,

149
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:58,415
FALLS.

150
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,983
DEMOCRACY IS A BEAUTIFUL THING,

151
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,451
VERY PATIENT THING.

152
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,786
YOU JUST KEEP TRYING.

153
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,287
I DON'T LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE,

154
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:09,159
RELAX, IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER.

155
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,795
LIFE COMES AND GOES, YOU OWE GOD

156
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,363
THAT LIFE BACK, RIGHT?

157
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,998
I DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE

158
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:15,799
PATIENT.

159
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,668
BUT FOR GOD SAKE, DON'T BRING

160
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:18,802
THINGS DOWN.

161
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,671
DON'T STEAL THINGS, DON'T POINT

162
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:21,571
GUNS AT POLICE.

163
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:26,677
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE A FORMER

164
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:29,413
SOLDIER, HE PROBABLY WAS TWO.

165
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,681
YOU DON'T CALL THE CONGRESS,

166
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:38,655
THEY ARE CALLING BACK.

167
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:43,994
BUT, THE KING SHIPS DIDN'T WORK,

168
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,295
TRIBALISM CAN'T WORK AND

169
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:46,063
SOMETHING THIS LARGE, COMMUNISM

170
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:52,269
DIDN'T WORK.

171
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,172
AND, THAT'S THE WORST FORM OF

172
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:57,007
GOVERNMENT THERE, EXCEPT ALL THE

173
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,175
OTHERS.

174
00:05:58,175 --> 00:05:58,975
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GOOD LUCK

175
00:05:58,975 --> 00:05:59,810
WITH THE BOOK.

176
00:05:59,810 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S FASCINATING.
