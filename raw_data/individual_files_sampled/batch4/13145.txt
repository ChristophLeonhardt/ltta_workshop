joining me now contributor to The Daily wire Alecia Kraus Alicia good to see ya yeah thanks for having me all right Alicia this is crazy I mean the reason the primary reason I care about California isn't even because I live here that's sort of that's sort of a secondary reason the primary reason is because what happens in California is then disseminated to the rest of the nation what happens in California first soon comes to every other state include though including those Midwestern states who right now feel insulated from the radical policies that's happening in California but if you look at the ballot in California there are more socialist candidates this election that I have ever seen before there's so many socialist candidates and also the lots of Peace and Freedom Party which it's interesting that they even included freedom in there considering that socialism tends to take away people's freedoms but you know to another point here Governor Jerry Brown who has served four terms two of them in the 70s and then two of them in this decade as governor of the state has frequently said what you just said and he wears it as a badge of honor that typically the democratic and liberal policies that are implemented here in California are then followed by other states all across the nation and taken as wins for the Democratic Party on the federal level and in the other 49 states in the nation and it's so interesting that you know really Democrats keep winning here despite the fact that we are 39th in the nation when it comes to our public schools despite the fact that in the last five years we've lost ten percent of our population who is fleeing because of our high tax rates and our high own homeownership covered California is a sham there's over one hundred and twenty billion dollars in pension liabilities I don't understand what Democrats have done that positively influence this state and I really think that that Democrats in the state should take note look at what Amazon is saying to the city of Seattle who just decided to tax them more I think Silicon Valley and Hollywood brings us a lot of money but those industries can and probably will be scared off if Democrats keep negatively affecting California's economy and the ways that they want to right well that's a key question that I think a lot of voters ask ourselves when we walk into the ballot box we ask ourselves and this was obviously a key it was a key political talking point in the Ronald Reagan campaign are you better off now than you were before and when for nians look at their quality of life look at how much taxes that we have to pay every day look at you know the terrible quality of our roads the fact that Cal the California state government in Sacramento takes so much of our money and spends it to further their agenda not to make our lives safer and securer more prosperous I don't think Californians can confidently say that we are doing better now after eight years of Jerry Brown than we were before no and I think that Gavin Newsom who's currently polling 21% there's actually 39 percent of California voters voters that say that they're undecided in our June 5th election which is just fascinating we all know that Gavin Newsom has of course former mayor of the city of San Francisco he went against the prop 8 decision and was one of the first mayor's in the country to marry homosexual couples he also he's now lieutenant governor and it looks like he's gonna win it fortunately it looks like we might actually have a Republican on the ballot in November for those of us that are watching that aren't in California hi mom the our state has this weird two-tier system where the top two candidates even if they're from the same party end up on the ballot in November based on the January 5th primary vote so it looks like we might actually have a Republican John Cox that's running against Newsom could end up on the ballot in November but Newsom is just gonna continue the policies of Jerry Brown and he's really trying to make a name for himself much like Senator Kamala Harris's as well because he wants to be the new democratic darling and make way for him to run for president one day right exactly well that was gonna that was gonna be the point sort of the evidence that California is patient zero you know we're the first we do these radical policies first and then we infect the rest of the country with them you can see that just based off of the Democratic leadership in our party right now Nancy Pelosi from California she was the former chair of the California Democratic Party Canela Harris she's now you know she wants to be the up-and-coming social justice warrior in the Democratic Party Xavier Becerra our Attorney General here he was a former congressman these are the people who want to be the power players in the Democratic Party what happens in California goes to other states next Alicia you did a really funny article I thought on The Daily wire about the California voter guide each candidate in the voter guide gets sort of a one-sentence pitch for themselves to introduce themselves to people who may not have been following along some of the things that these candidates said is absolutely insane I don't want to give their names air time because they're so ridiculous here but I also want to know I want people to know who actually said what thing what things because there's a candidate called I think running for US Senate it named Ling Ling she who said that we should nullify the 2016 US presidential election and that the US should quote we hold the 45th US presidential election what what what is this nonsense Alisha does this person think that Hillary Clinton has a chance still to be President this isn't the only person I mean Ling Ling she to her credit was the only one that I guess was bold enough to say that she actually just wanted to completely rescind the 2016 election results but a lot of other candidates from for Sarah to others that you mentioned there talked about the hashtag resistance or talked about how they fought the NRA or talked about how Time magazine has named them as climate change makers whatever that is supposed to mean so I mean people in California like I said the piece the left it's considered conservative here and the left er it's more on the mainstream for California Democrats there are lots of people that seem to think that Trump is the big bad guy and don't forget Liz you're also supposed to mention the candidate that said that trans rights are more important than business rights whatever that means I don't know but we're transphobic if we don't agree with it we're probably transphobic just for mentioning it it is scary to think about you're right the left er is the new left but that's what we saw in 2016 the fact that so many people supported Bernie Sanders you know feeling that burn I mean he he's very open about the fact he's proud of the fact that he is a socialist so that that's sort of the new I think iteration of the Democratic Party was just terrifying there's a candidates I think for Congress his name is John Thompson he is the peace and freedom party that you mentioned basically that's the Socialist Party they just don't call themselves the Socialist Party this is what he says this is his campaign slogan end capitalism don't enable it that's horrifying and that could be why we've seen you know 10% like I mentioned of California's population fleeing the state there's businesses fleeing the state where the state that is the hardest for small businesses to get started let alone succeed and I think that that's a real problem considering how important in small business its are for the whole of the American economy and by the way most small businesses are owned and operated by women so if the Democratic Party in the state of California wants to be Pro women then they should be Pro small business and knock it off with these horrible policies that they're implementing in Sacramento that's right Democrats the Sacramento you listen to Alecia she's got that right you want to support women you support small businesses then this is an interesting strategy question though Alecia California is a very known democratic state I mean obviously and we just laid out exactly why but it hasn't always been like that it's not historically been a blue state here I mean we had even back as far as Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan won as a Republican governor here twice Ronald Reagan is arguably the most conservative modern president in modern times in our country's history Arnold Schwarzenegger you know not exactly your most conservative Republicans still a Republican he won the governorship here that's in recent times what changed to make you know just up and down the coast what changed to make this state so democratic honestly it's because we're sanctuary state and because now we are allowing illegal immigrants and registering illegal immigrants to vote you've seen as there's been a decline in I guess you could say Caucasian American or mixed-race members of our society here in California and the Hispanic population has increased so have the Democratic voter rolls I mean just recently I believe in 2016 it from from 2014 to 2016 the Republican voter registration rolls went from 31% of registered Republicans to I believe 27 or 28 percent just in two years we saw a 3% drop and it's gonna continue to happen I think the only hope that Republicans have in this state is to continue to push that small government is better for everyone that national security is very important and another issue you and I have talked about on this show numerous times school choice because it's an issue that works across all party lines that libertarians Democrats and Republicans can get on board for in addition to that I mean you look at the leading California politicians you name Nancy Pelosi Dianne Feinstein and others they're all 70 plus so maybe if we can get some young Republican blood in there and on the state and local level local level is so important there could be hope for the Republican Party here
