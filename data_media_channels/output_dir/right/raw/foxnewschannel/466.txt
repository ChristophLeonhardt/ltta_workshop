1
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:35,237
KEEP IT RUNNING.

2
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:32,808
>> MY NEXT GUEST KEPT IT GOING.

3
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:27,446
>> IF YOU WANTED AN FBI

4
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:26,180
INVESTIGATION YOU SHOULD HAVE

5
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:25,414
COME TO US.

6
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:23,917
YOU WANTED TO HOLD THIS SEAT.

7
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:19,587
YOU WANT POWER AND I HOPE YOU

8
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:18,488
NEVER GET IT.

9
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:16,457
YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND HELD IT.

10
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:14,726
YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF

11
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:11,028
PROTECTING DR.  FORD.

12
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:01,472
SHE'S AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS YOU

13
00:06:01,472 --> 00:05:59,006
ARE.

14
00:05:59,006 --> 00:05:56,677
>> SENATOR IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU

15
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:54,112
THIS MORNING.

16
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:54,112
>> THANK YOU.

17
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:50,049
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP

18
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:49,884
AND COURAGE.

19
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:44,122
WHAT PROMPTED YOU?

20
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:44,122
>> OUTRAGE.

21
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:43,857
I'VE KNOWN BRETT.

22
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:36,063
HE'S GONE THROUGH SIX FBI

23
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:36,063
INVESTIGATIONS.

24
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:30,103
HE'S APPOINTED MORE WOMEN TO

25
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:29,637
WORK FOR HIM.

26
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:20,747
THEY TRIED TO DESTROY HIS LIFE.

27
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:17,016
THIS IS ABOUT KEEPING THE SEAT

28
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,016
OPEN.

29
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:15,284
THERE ARE NO RULES WHEN IT COMES

30
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:14,452
TO BRETT KAVANAUGH.

31
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:11,155
I HONORED OBAMA'S ELECTION.

32
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:08,191
HE PICKED TWO NOMINATIONS.

33
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:06,961
THEY DON'T WANT TO HONOR TRUMP'S

34
00:05:06,961 --> 00:04:58,835
ABILITY TO PICK A FINE MAN.

35
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:55,405
WHEN THEY ASKED FOR THIS TO

36
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:53,173
CONTINUE IT WAS A BRIDGE TOO

37
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:52,174
FAR.

38
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:49,210
I SPOKE IN A LOT OF WAYS THAT

39
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:47,813
REPUBLICANS COULD RELATE TO.

40
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:44,049
I'M A BIPARTISAN GUY AND

41
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:43,784
CONTINUES TO BE.

42
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:39,220
WHEN IT'S ABOUT JUDICIAL

43
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:37,122
NOMINEES I WILL MAKE SURE THEY

44
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:35,024
ARE TREATED FAIRLY.

45
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:34,292
>>Reporter: WHAT IS YOUR

46
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:30,496
THOUGHT NOW THEY ARE DELAYING

47
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:29,931
FOR ANOTHER WEEK.

48
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:27,266
>> JEFF FLAKE HAS BEEN A FRIEND

49
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:25,969
OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME.

50
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:22,705
SUZANNE COLLINS AND LISA ARE ALL

51
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:20,005
FINE SENATORS.

52
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:18,341
THEY WOULD LIKE A SUPPLEMENTAL

53
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:09,751
FBI BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION.

54
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:07,920
DR.  FORD CAN'T TELL US WHEN OR

55
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:05,855
WHERE IT HAPPENED.

56
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:00,527
THE COMMITTEE SPOKE TO KAISER

57
00:04:00,527 --> 00:03:58,729
AND MS. KAISER TOLD US SHE

58
00:03:58,729 --> 00:03:55,532
DOESN'T REFUTE WHAT DOCTOR FORD

59
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:45,709
SAID BUT SHE WASN'T AT A PARTY.

60
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:43,344
SHE'S CONFUSED.

61
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:41,513
MARK JUDGE SAID IT DIDN'T

62
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:41,513
HAPPEN.

63
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:39,481
P.J. SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

64
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:37,050
ARE TALKING ABOUT.

65
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:35,118
THE FBI WILL INTERVIEW THESE

66
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:33,387
PEOPLE AND ASK MARK JUDGE IF

67
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:28,993
THEY HAVE SEEN BRETT KAVANAUGH

68
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:25,062
DRUG WOMEN AND PARTICIPATE IN

69
00:03:25,062 --> 00:00:05,974
THE CLAIMS.

70
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:06,474
>>> WELCOME BACK.

71
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:12,046
WE ARE HERE WITH SENATOR LINDSEY

72
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:12,447
GRAHAM.

73
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:13,848
WE HEARD FROM THOSE PEOPLE AND

74
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:18,419
MANY SAID I WASN'T AT THE PARTY

75
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,722
AND DON'T HAVE RECKLESS.

76
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:23,591
>> WE TOLD THAT TO THE

77
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:24,092
COMMITTEE.

78
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:27,862
THE SENATORS WOULD LIKE TO

79
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,430
DOUBLE-CHECK.

80
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,999
MS. RAMIREZ HAS REFUSED TO TALK

81
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:31,699
TO US.

82
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,369
HER ALLEGATIONS WOULDN'T BE

83
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:36,738
PRINTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES

84
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:40,375
FOR A GOOD REASON.

85
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,644
WE'LL VOTE THIS COMING WEEK.

86
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:44,412
THE FBI SUPPLEMENTAL

87
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:45,647
INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE DONE

88
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,015
EARLY THIS WEEK.

89
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:48,983
WE'LL HAVE A FINAL PASSAGE VOTE

90
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:53,688
LATER IN THE WEEK.

91
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:55,724
CONIF I

92
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:55,757
CONFF I

93
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:50,752
CONFIRI

94
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:55,791
I'M HIGHLY CONFIDENT HE'LL BE

95
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:56,058
CONFIRMED.

96
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:58,193
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

97
00:00:58,193 --> 00:00:59,728
HE'S THE BEST CHOICE PRESIDENT

98
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:00,996
TRUMP COULD HAVE MADE.

99
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:02,631
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN

100
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:04,833
NEXT IF YOU WILL ALLOW.

101
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,467
>> PLEASE.

102
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:08,003
>> OKAY, THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO

103
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:08,570
HAPPEN.

104
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,572
I'LL ASK SENATOR GRASSILY ABOUT

105
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:16,278
HOW THIS HEARING PROCESS WAS

106
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:19,047
HIJACKED BEYOND ETHICAL ASPECTS.

107
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:22,417
THE SLASH AND BURN ASPECTS OF IT

108
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,987
AND ABUSE DR.  FORD'S TRUST.

109
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:27,589
WE'LL START WITH THE FOLLOWING

110
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:27,923
CONCEPT.

111
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:30,959
DR.  FORD SAID AT THE HEARING

112
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,761
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE COMMITTEE

113
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,529
WOULD COME TO CALIFORNIA AND

114
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,598
TAKE HER TESTIMONY IN A PRIVATE

115
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:36,932
SETTING.

116
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:38,934
THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID.

117
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:43,272
I JUST APPRECIATE YOU DID OFFER

118
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:43,572
THAT.

119
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:45,808
I WASN'T CLEAR ON WHAT THE OFFER

120
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:46,075
WAS.

121
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,010
IF YOU WOULD HAVE COME OUT TO

122
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,446
SEE ME I WOULD HAVE HAPPILY

123
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,081
HOSTED YOU AND SPOKE WITH YOU

124
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:52,514
OUT THERE.

125
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:54,516
IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME THAT THAT

126
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:55,784
WAS THE CASE.

127
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:57,719
HOW COULD THAT NOT BE CLEAR TO

128
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:57,986
HER?

129
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:01,690
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE

130
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,758
COMMITTEE DID.

131
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:08,630
ON SEPTEMBER 19, THE STAFF TOLD

132
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,500
GRASSILY TO HER ATTORNEY.

133
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,268
>> WE'LL SPEAK TO DR.  FORD AT

134
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:16,338
ANY TIME AND PLACE CONVENIENT TO

135
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:16,605
HER.

136
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:19,007
WE ALSO OFFER THE INVESTIGATORS

137
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,810
TO MEET WITH DR.  FORD ANYWHERE

138
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,852
ANY TIME.

139
00:02:29,852 --> 00:02:33,556
THIS IS ANOTHER E-MAIL.

140
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:35,391
GRASSILY TWEETS COME TO US OR

141
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,827
WE'LL COME TO YOU.

142
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:40,429
I'LL HAVE MY STAFF TRAVEL TO

143
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:42,632
CALIFORNIA TO OBTAIN HER

144
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:43,132
TESTIMONY.

145
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,635
A LETTER FROM GRASSILY TO

146
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:46,002
FEINSTEIN.

147
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:48,671
DR.  FORD'S ATTORNEY REPLIES.

148
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,573
DR.  FORD HAS ASKED ME TO LET

149
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:53,175
YOU KNOW SHE APPRECIATES THE

150
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:55,077
OPTIONS YOU HAVE SUGGESTED.

151
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:57,179
CATS E-MAILED BACK.

152
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,181
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHY SHE

153
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:02,118
DIDN'T KNOW HER OPTIONS.

154
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:05,955
I'M GOING TO FINE OUT WHO IN

155
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:07,456
FEINSTEINS STAFF RECOMMENDED

156
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:10,626
CATS TO BE DOCTOR FORD'S LAWYER.

157
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:15,064
IT'S IMPROPER FOR SENATORS TO

158
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:18,100
RECOMMEND LAWYERS TO

159
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,534
CONSTITUENTS.

160
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,269
IF HE THOUGHT SHE NEEDED A

161
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,471
LAWYER WHY DIDN'T YOU COME

162
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,607
FORWARD AND TELL US ABOUT THE

163
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,007
ALLEGATIONS.

164
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:34,650
I'LL TRY TO FIND OUT WHO USED

165
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,618
HER TRUST.

166
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,853
I DON'T BELIEVE FEINSTEIN DID

167
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:41,691
THIS AND DR.  FORD'S LAWYER.

168
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,893
NO FRIEND WOULD DO THIS TO HER.

169
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:47,296
THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS

170
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:48,864
ANONYMOUS LETTER AND DESTROYED

171
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,500
HER TRUST HAD A POLITICAL

172
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,934
AGENDA.

173
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:55,104
I'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

174
00:03:55,104 --> 00:04:00,476
I WILL FIND OUT WHO LEAKED

175
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:01,477
ANONYMOUS LETTER.

176
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:05,681
IT HAD NO POST PARK OR RETURN

177
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:08,217
ADDRESS CLAIMING THAT JUDGE

178
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:13,523
KAVANAUGH DID SOMETHING IN 1988

179
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:14,023
AND 1998.

180
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:16,125
SOMEONE LEAKED THAT AND RAN IT

181
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,793
AS A STORY.

182
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:21,230
I CAN'T IMAGE IF A DEMOCRATIC

183
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:27,904
COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE DONE THIS.

184
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:34,911
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE'LL LOOK

185
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:36,746
INTO A BETRAYAL OF TRUST WITH

186
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:37,613
DR.  FORD.

187
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:40,516
WE'LL LOOK AT COMMITTEE RULES.

188
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:43,419
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN PROVE WHAT'S

189
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:43,753
OBVIOUS.

190
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:46,789
