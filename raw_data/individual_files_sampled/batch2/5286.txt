president of course campaign this past Friday night out in Ohio bragging about his election victory two years ago and with this fall's midterm now just three weeks off president Trump has been hitting the campaign trail for Republicans across the Midwest hoping to stave off embarrassing losses in states that he carried two years ago with the Washington Post reports that Trump's luster may have worn off leaving Republican candidates flat a number of Republicans running for governor senator Wisconsin Michigan Ohio and Pennsylvania including several who hits their wagon to Trump's political movement are behind in polls by double digits in fact the real clear average at polls at each of those states I mentioned shows that Democratic incumbents Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin debbie Stabenow of Michigan sherrod Brown of Ohio and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania all all of these Senate senators surging ahead of their Republican opponents well ahead of them where I'm drawn by Charlie Sykes contributing editor at the weekly status out here I look I have intuited thoughts about this like you did but what can you tell us about the people you talk to Bobby Casey's not going to get beat the president said at that rally for Barletta the other day it's too bad he kicked away a lifelong career in the US House because I urged them to run for Senator he's gone basically said he's gone nobody's gonna beat sherrod Brown and debbie Stabenow we've been talking about that race and Palma's gonna win why is the Midwest which went down for Trump all the way they just liked him at least the point of giving him the election turned them off well I think we're seeing the limits of the transferability of trumpian appeal look these are not red states these are either blue states where they are purple states and this is kind of the reverse when when Trump makes the election about himself it is kind of the reverse of your previous conversation because you know yeah that might motivate voters and in Tennessee in Texas to turnout but in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan and Ohio and Wisconsin the key to those states is our our Democrats going to turn out in big numbers they generally don't inaugural elections look like they are in this year's this year's election and you know is he gonna be able to capture that that trumpian magic and and it certainly does not look like it and look you know this is the backbone as you pointed out this is the backbone of the trumpian electoral college victory you know he's not president without Pennsylvania Michigan Ohio Wisconsin and so whatever happens elsewhere in the country what happens in 2018 you know ought to be watched very very closely for for Oman's for 2020 you know I've been talking no audience is the last couple days and I have to tell you what I think people agree with is this the American voter is not a greedy voter what the American voter once is especially the older people who vote and they vote a lot they when Social Security so they can have a retirement without poverty which is about the greatest anti-poverty program in history is Social Security they paid into it they deserve to get it out a couple thousand a month they deserve Medicare because that was what they paid on from the time they were 15 their first job till they're 65 they've been paying in on their law right their medical care after they're 65 and guys don't live as long as their wives but they live alone they need health care they believe they've paid they deserve it Medicaid let's be honest it's not just for poor people it's for people have long term care situations Alzheimer's especially okay and then they want a job for their children close enough they can drive home once in a while and say hi that's all they want Democrats like Casey like sherrod Brown like debbie Stabenow like beau would understand that they don't took all this avant-garde social stuff they talked the basic basic economics and Trump does too he won't touch entitlements and he produces jobs so it's interesting that that's why you would vote for a Bobby Casey but also vote for a Trump interesting I think your thoughts you know exactly right and of course that was that was the magic of 2016 from the trumpian point of view is that he took some of those themes that Democrats have been running on you know he played against type four you know the Republicans you know it you know had he not you know pledged to defend all those yet I don't think he would have won those states but then again no trumpism as it has evolved I think you know cuts against all of that you know you know his his populist appeal is you know is limited especially with the tax cut bill so again some of the issues that are working so strongly in his favor in the red states are eggs exactly the issues that I think are hurting him in the industrial Midwest if there hadn't been a Cavanaugh episode from the beginning to the end all the way through dr. Ford flies you for it if that hadn't happened would he be better off or worse from today Trump I think he would be worse off today it's hard to say how it's gonna play out in the Midwest but there's no question about it that Republicans you talk to Republicans doctor conservatives they feel that there's new energy the president feels that he's on a roll now whether that's true or not we don't know but again these are mirror images of one another that that an issue that that is going to galvanize Republican conservative turnout is also going to you know galvanize it's going to be a Democratic turnout in the Philadelphia suburbs in the suburbs of Columbus and the momentum doubles that doubles down in both directions I think women in The probe's of papers and keep up with these issues of harassment and assault sexual assault are totally turned off by the messages coming from the White House thank you so much Charlie Sykes hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
