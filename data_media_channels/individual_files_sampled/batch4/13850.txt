CCA does amazing educational work also you can go enter to win that freak on at all ends on Friday defend your family now calm so the big story over the weekend obviously was the death of Senator John McCain Senator McCain served for I believe 35 years in the Senate he became famous not because of that but because he did five years in a North Vietnamese prison from the man truly was an American Hero despite the fact that there are many who would say otherwise for no reason other than petty spite the fact is that anyone who serves in uniform and then does five years in a North Vietnamese prison and then gives up their opportunity to come home in order to maintain a solidarity with the troops who are already there that is an American Hero John McCain did two years in solitary confinement under the North Vietnamese under the Vietcong when he came out he had essentially been physically crippled his hair was completely here's a clip of john mccain talking about his his torture at the hands of the of the north vietnamese historians have said that no american prisoner arrived at the Hanoi Hilton in worse condition than McCain broke my shoulder and hurt my knee again and but look I don't blame them I don't blame them we're in a war I don't didn't like it but at the same time were it when you're in a war and you're captured by the enemy you can't expect you know to to have tea and so when he was he crash-landed on the North Vietnamese denied him medical aid and they stabbed with a bayonet as well then they proceeded to torture him for years and years and years for information and then they tried to leverage and they tried to use him as a propaganda tool they wanted to return him to the United States because his father was an admiral and thereby create the narrative that the United States gave preferential treatment to the children of the privileged McCain turned that down and instead stayed under the gentle mercies of one of the worst regimes in history the Vietcong that is American heroism he then came back and he he answered the Senate I believe in it woulda been 1981 and he was he was there for 36 years he died over the weekend now does this mean that everything that John McCain did was amazing politically no I disagreed with John McCain routinely most recently when John McCain gave the thumbs down to what they called skinny repealed the repeal of large parts of the Obamacare package including the individual mandate and he said he did that because he didn't approve of the way the Senate was running he was a guy who was constantly talking about the rules of the Senate even though the Democrats were constantly breaking those rules but John McCain overall understood that America was an exceptional place and he put his life on the line in order to prove that America was an exceptional place he certainly understood the threat that was posed to America by outside actors he understood the threat that was posed to America by places like Russia there's a reason that Russia today basically ran a bunch of smears against him or ignored him after his death none of that is particularly a shock Sarah Huckabee Sanders actually said that John McCain was an American Hero she was caught up with by TMZ as she left Reagan National Airport she said Kane's death was a great loss for our country and then she was asked if she personally plans to attend the funeral and she said absolutely apparently vice-president pence will attend the funeral Donald Trump will not attend the funeral because he has a long-standing spat with John McCain Barack Obama and George W Bush are both expected to speak at the funeral and I want to talk a little bit in a second about the sort of reason why there are so many people on the trumpian right who are very angry at John McCain there are a lot of people who are trashing his memory the day of his death and I don't think that that is appropriate in any way shape or form President Trump did tweet after senator McCain's death my deepest sympathies in respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain our hearts and prayers are with you but obviously President Trump was not a fan of Senator McCain and that goes all the way back to early in the campaign when he suggested that Senator McCain was not a war hero which was an abominable statement I mean by any standard for Donald Trump to say a guy who avoided the Vietnam draft and then bragged about how his own personal Vietnam had been avoiding STDs during the 1970s while sleeping with various and sundry women for him to say that John McCain was not a war hero because he hadn't been caught is because he because he'd been caught is was an egregious statement obviously and led to a tremendous rift between McCain and Trump from the very beginning according to the Washington Post press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders chief of staff John Kelly and other White House aides advocated for an official statement that gave the decorated Vietnam War powa audits for his military and Senate service and called him a hero according to current and former White House aides who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations the original statement was drafted before McCain died Saturday Sanders and others edited a final version this weekend that was ready for the president the aide said but Trump told aides he wanted to post a brief tweet instead and the statement praising McCain's life was not released so despite the fact that Trump had released official statements on the death of John Glenn former senator he refused to do so for John McCain and Trump has no plans apparently to attend McCain's funeral this is generating all sorts of media headlines it's stupid politics by the president it is just from a political perspective but he's dumb politics by the president because he is reopening a rift in the aftermath of a guy's death that is completely unnecessary showing a little bit of grace would probably be a much better move here and this was exacerbated this morning by the fact that President Trump ordered the flags at the White House to be re hung at the top of the staff so the normal rule but so by federal statute the rule is that when a senator dies that the flag is lowered for about a day but the unofficial rule and this is the one that we've kept too is that when a sitting senator dies what you do is you leave the the flag at half-staff until the senator is actually buried if you look at the pictures of the White House you can see that the flag is back up to top of the staff and I think the most troubling picture obviously was there's a picture of the the White House flag at the top of the staff and there's another picture that showed behind that you can see the Washington Memorial the Washington Monument rather and you can see all the flags are at half staff so while the White House is back up to top of the staff the Washington Monument they're still down at half-staff which makes the president look really petty whether or not you like John McCain whether you like Donald Trump better than John McCain it is irrelevant this is not good politics it makes the president look petty it makes him look silly and there's no reason for him to do any of that now the president's honesty is one of the attributes that people like about him it would have looked dishonest if the President had called McCain a war hero had called him a war hero after not calling him a hero and after ripping him up and down but to issue some sort of gracious statement and take the temporary hit I think would have been well worthwhile I want to talk about McCain's record in just a second and why there's a perception on parts of the right that this sort of kind of slap it and McCain is is a is a decent thing that it's not a huge deal but let's flashback to a couple of things about John McCain that I think are relevant first of all let's talk about his record so there's been a lot of talk today about the things that John McCain's did right and the things that John McCain did wrong I would say that John McCain was right on about 65% of issues and who's wrong and about 35% of issues those 35% loomed very large right campaign finance reform was a case where I was in deep disagreement with John McCain I think that his plans for campaign finance reform were actually quite harmful to the American public debate I think frankly they were unconstitutional but John McCain pushed those through anyway he was as I say instrumental in upholding part of Obamacare just in the last year alone his his tenure was not unmarked on traversée obviously his his henan tenure began an 87 rather I said 81 earlier as January 1987 and he had some problems with scandal he was involved with the so-called Keating 5 Charles Keating was a banker that McCain had met while working at Hensley and company and Keating's associates at the Lincoln Savings and Loan give them money to McCain as well as five other senators Keating supported them in the hopes of preventing the government seizures of his savings and loan McCain participated in meetings there was never any finding of serious corruption there but McCain would later go on to sponsored campaign finance reform obviously McCain Feingold became a real thorn in the side of a lot of politicians and as I say I think a violation of First Amendment principles when McCain was very instrumental in the kind of war movement in the aftermath of 9/11 I think that was right I think McCain's statements with regard to the surge in Iraq or eminently correct I think who's more correct on foreign policy than he was on domestic policy but McCain did win the New Hampshire primaries in January 8 2008 he ran a campaign against Barack Obama that I thought was quite luck well lackluster but the things about McCain that made McCain a class act in certain ways were things like this so people are pointing out this clip this is from the 2008 campaign McCain was at a town hall event and a woman gets up and she calls Obama a Muslim and McCain basically says no no no we're not doing that I can't trust Obama I I have read about him and he's not he's not he's a he's an Arab he is not no no ma'am no ma'am he's a he's a he's a decent family man citizen that I just happened to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that's what this campaign is all about he's not thank you and that was sort of who McCain was McCain had a baseline of good sense to him when it came at least to relationships with other people in politics but it's exactly that that led a lot of people to kind of dismiss him on the right because the reality is in 2008 he did run a lackluster campaign he ran a campaign where he refused to say truths about Barack Obama including about Barack Obama's associations with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers it was a lackluster campaign he shouldn't have lost that campaign he did lose that campaign because I think that his sense of honor and politics overwhelmed his necessity for victory in politics and you can say some good things about that you can also say some bad things about that but it led to the feeling that the Republican Party wasn't fighting hard enough so what we really need is a counter-puncher and so people who favor Trump over McCain in that battle are largely relying on the fact that McCain was seen as sort of milquetoast in the way that he went after other politicians whereas Donald Trump is as a guy who'll go no-holds-barred now I want to talk about the media reaction to John McCain in just a second because in some ways I think that it is quite revealing about who the media are when it comes to Republicans generally but first let's talk about your personal

Trump is disrespectful to John McCain which is true the media are suddenly experiencing a strange new respect for John McCain the media suddenly loved John McCain and I'd like to remind you that in 2008 while John McCain was running an honorable campaign against Barack Obama the media were calling him a racist they were calling him a sexist they were suggesting that he was a crazed old loon who was going to land the United States in the middle of interminable war right that was their campaign against John McCain I remember I was there I helped raise money for the McCain campaign John McCain the heroes AAA this kind of encapsulated Lester Spence was an assistant professor of political science at the Johns Hopkins University he said this about Senator John McCain's campaign rhetoric Senator John McCain's recent attacks on Barack Obama accusing him of being a terrorist which McCain never did combine with GOP columnists and bloggers arguing that Obama supports painting the White House black and racial reparations represents an embrace of the problematic Southern Strategy the GOP has historically used to increase white racial resentments had spends who's african-american but as can be seen in the most recent presidential debate he's employing the strategy selectively only among the GOP faithful and that was the take of the media at the time there are a lot of people in the media who are suggesting that John McCain was just as bad as they suggest Donald Trump is today the media routinely say whoever is the Republican who is running for office now every other Republican before has been decent you wait after Donald Trump is out of office whether it's in four years or whether it's in eight years there will be an the next person who they nominate the next person Republicans pick will be seen as worse than Donald Trump there are you saying right they say there they say about Mike Pence and if Donald Trump were to be somehow depose from office and Mike Pence were to take his slot be careful what you wish for because Mike Pence is more dangerous and even more scary than Donald Trump it is because the left slandered folks like John McCain who was a moderate on politics and John McCain was a moderate Republican at best they slandered him let's let Mitt Romney another moderate on politics and moderate Republican at best they slandered both of them as racist sexist bigoted homophobes and the Republican base responded by saying both of those guys were nice guys who refused to run a bare-knuckles campaign against the Democrat so let's nominate the not nice guy who's happy to go bare knuckles that says it there's a to to underestimate the effect that Democratic attacks on John McCain and Mitt Romney had on the 2016 primaries is to ignore reality there are a lot of Republicans who resonated to the fact that Donald Trump was willing to take a hammer to anyone specifically because they said well we nominated a couple of genteel folks and we had a genteel president george w bush and you guys hammered the living daylights out of those folks so why wouldn't we nominate somebody like Donald Trump now the cost of that is that you end up with somebody like Donald Trump as president in terms of character who will also slander John McCain but none of that is to is to I think to grade the fact that the media's attacks on Republicans like McCain led to the rise of folks like Donald Trump we're gonna talk in a second about what exactly the media said upon John McCain's death because suddenly it was a different to so first of all I have to point this out this was the best gaffe of the weekend it was truly amazing NBC News broke into Saturday Night Live in order to announce John McCain's death and let's just say that there programmer is not all that bright because it went quite poorly here's what it sounded like and again this evening the breaking news NBC News confirming the death of Senator John McCain our live coverage continues on MSNBC if you can't see this they then went back to Saturday Night Live dolphin that love story in which two fat men with dolphin heads are walking around making dolphin songs sounds and then and then proceeding to make out with each other yeah I'm so from John McCain's death to this well done media best gaffe of the weekend just astonishing I mean that so yep good well done NBC okay but when when you look at the media's response to all this take for example Jake Tapper so I like Jake I'm friendly with Jake and I think that Jake tries his best to keep his bias out of the politics what he says here is not completely untrue but it is also indicative of one of the reasons why John McCain lost and one of the reasons why Donald Trump won here's Jake Tapper explaining that a lot of the reverence you're seeing for McCain today is because of anger at President Trump and hatred of President Trump and Amanda for a younger generation of conservatives what does McCain mean and I can't help but think that like part of the reason why there's such reverence for him today is because of who's in the White House right now because they are polar opposites yeah okay so they're that idea that Tapper is spelling out that's correct but it's also relevant to mention that when John McCain was running for the White House there was a lot of talk about John McCain as a nutjob who's going to land us in war with Iran because he was a crazy person with his finger on the trigger and then as soon as Trump is in the White House like oh well you know that John McCain guy act I was great man I missed that John McCain guy of course he missed that John McCain guy because the guy was never president maybe you missed that John McCain guy because that John McCain guy lost to your guy right Barack Obama the media loved Barack Obama and so they were happy with John McCain who lost in the same way that suddenly their romance about Mitt Romney there is even some romance about George HW Bush's no longer in office now is it true the Donald Trump is a difference in kind from John McCain from George W Bush from Mitt Romney of course of course that's true of course he's a difference in kind right he's the kind of person who refuses to keep the staff lower the flag lowered to half-staff at the White House out of personal peek at a dead senator yes he's a difference in kind from those other Republicans and it's not out of bounds to point out that he's a difference in kind it is important however to recall the media malfeasance that surrounded John McCain every time he became a threat to the left suddenly they turned on him and it's something to recall about the way that the press treat any Republican they will find their favorite Republican treat them well until the point when they turn at which point as soon as they figure out that Republicans actually Republican that Republican becomes a bad guy again and you see this with every major Republican of the modern era right now they like Ben Sasse or Ben Sasse the senator from Nebraska to turn out to be a Republican presidential nominee he once again become a racist sexist pig and homophobe that is the way the left works it's what drove people into the arms of President Trump in the first place the media is malfeasance is what allowed President Trump to become president of the United States which is why he campaigns against them on a regular basis and the media don't even recognize this Chuck Todd was defending the media over the weekend and he said that you know all this mistrust in media all of it is is it's based not in fact it's just based on on lies and propaganda I think one of the one of the best things going in Donald Trump's favor we know this is the mainstream media I hate to say it every conservative echo-chamber created that environment it's not it's not no no no I mean yeah it has been a tactic and a tool of the Roger Ailes creative yeah so let's not pretend it's not anything other than that you're saying it was a creative nonsense I'm sorry that's such nonsense that the the belief in left media bias is a creation of the echo chamber its whistling past the graveyard it is just not true what percentage of people in the NBC newsroom actually voted for Donald Trump I would say it verges on zero it verges on zero the country split half in half and the percentage verged on zero and then you tried out folks like Roland Martin and Roland Martin's on CNN all the time and he says what people really want is integrity like Obama well he's on MSNBC here he says that well people really want us integrity like Obama then you wonder why people on the right think that the media is totally full of crap the media have been promoting here's Roland Martin and I'll talk about this what is happening here or you're seeing Americans who are saying integrity matters okay at some point it can't be well that's just that's just Trump being Trump no it's not okay but it's overall and Martin saying integrity matters they want integrity like Obama's one of the memes that's been going around lately is the only scandal Obama had was his tan suit that he wore at the White House and members of the mainstream media been pushing this John Harwood said this over the weekend if you actually believe that then it's no wonder you also believe that people think that the media is biased for no reason right the me and people think the media's biased for a very good reason and McCain's death is the latest example as they swiveled from McCain was a bad guy to McCain was a good guy based on how much damage he can do to the Republican Party and based on who is in the White House currently okay in just a second I want to talk about President Trump's poll numbers and then a massive scandal for the Catholic Church there's a lot coming up and a mass shooting in Jacksonville first let's talk about your stamps okay the reality is that you can go down to the post office post office

McCain and President Trump President Trump had a very bad week last week in the media we're hoping and hoping that this was sort of the end of little Trump that this is going to be the end of Donald Trump's administration well it turns out there's a pullout and shock of shocks the poll numbers haven't moved at all the poll numbers are exactly so according to NBC in the Wall Street Journal after a week that saw president Donald Trump's former campaign chairman convicted on eight counts of fraud and his former lawyer plead guilty to felony campaign finance charges the president's job approval rating remains virtually unchanged new polling from NBC News in the Wall Street Journal shows but the stability and trumps approval rating also comes as more than half of voters say he has not been honest and truthful regarding the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Muller and fewer than three and ten voters are convinced that Trump himself is not implicated in the wrongdoing of six of his associates who have now either been convicted of crimes or have pled guilty Trump's approval rating is 44 percent to prove 52 percent disapprove that is basically the same as it was a week ago when it was 46% to prove 51 percent disapprove the president's approval ratings are extraordinarily stable I have been saying this now for months the president of the United States is the beneficiary of what I call the strong markets efficiency theory everything is priced in there's a theory about the stock market that you can't beat the stock market because all available information is immediately priced into the price of a stock well within comes to Donald Trump everything is priced in except for an economic collapse basically except for an economic collapse or nuclear war the President of the United States has approval ratings will remain absolutely stable and part of the reason for that is because we are so ensconced in our own corners we are now cemented in our own political corners and one of the reasons we are so cemented in our political corners is indeed the bias of the media the feeling that no matter what Trump does the media are out to get him it wouldn't matter if you were innocent or whether he would guilty they would treat him exactly the same way they went after John McCain they went after Mitt Romney them going after Donald Trump it was the boy who cried wolf one too many times he can't do it that many times and then get away with it interminably and even if and the thing is even when the wolf shows up that's the moral of the story of the boy who cried wolf is that even when the wolf shows up nobody believes him maybe Trump is the wolf maybe not nobody's gonna know because the media already shot their hog when it came to John McCain and Mitt Romney they already they already said all they had to say about Republicans for years about george w bush i've been here the whole time so of you this is nothing new they say the same thing about donald trump except louder now does that mean that trumps should justify all of that with bad behavior of course not of course and i'd be great if trump didn't justify all that with bad behavior you know people treating you badly is not an excuse for bad behavior that said to fail to recognize the impact of polarized media environment on president from stable approval ratings is absolutely short-sighted okay meanwhile there's over the weekend the other big news is that there was this terrible shooting at the madden I guess it was Madden tournament in Jacksonville Florida this is a gamer tournament so basically people get together and they play Madden for money Madden football and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has identified the alleged shooter as a white male who had died at the scene he was 24 years old from Baltimore so he was coming obviously from a gun-free zone cuz Baltimore as we know it doesn't have any gun control laws except for has tons of gun control laws he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside Chicago pizza after going on a shooting rampage the left two dead and 11 other people injured it was a gun-free zone with not enough security and then this is the typical story unfortunately of a lot of these sorts of mass shootings when you have a public event a popular event popular public event you have to have people there with guns and my sister's wedding happened I paid personally for security with guns to make sure they nobody could actually get into my sister's wedding and that was a private event this is a major public event that was a gun-free zone where they didn't have enough security and this guy got in with a gun he was a disappointed gamer so he had gone in the first round he lost and then he was upset with his life that he went out and decided to murder a bunch of people which is just evil and sick he used at least one handgun in his attack so a ban on assault rifles would apparently do nothing he'd previously appeared in a photo with a Buffalo Bills player after winning another competition there's been no motive announced for the killings there reports that he snapped after losing an event he stayed at a local hotel the night before the shooting they've impounded his car the investigation is still ongoing EA Sports issued a statement saying we are aware of an incident at a sanctioned Madden Championship Series competition in Jacksonville we are working with authorities to gather facts at this stage this is a horrible incident our deepest sympathies go out to all involved I want to point out the hypocrisy of folks in the media who are immediately jumping to gun control today it's hilarious because literally five days ago they were suggesting that it was impossible you should not politicize the killing of Molly Tibbets in Iowa you should certainly not say that that has anything to do with illegal immigration that'll be politicization of the issue and I discussed at length on Friday what's true about that and what's not true about that the fact that we know more about Molly Tibbets is killing than we know about the average mass shooting in the first few days and that's why you can say with a certain amount certainty that illegal immigration had something to do with the male tip it's killing we're in this case we don't know where he got the gun we barely know what kind of gun the guy used we don't know about his criminal history we don't know his psychological history there are a lot of other issues that conflate and confound the media immediately jump to gun control because it was deeply necessary for them to push their agenda this just shows the hypocrisy of so many in the media who are willing to overlook the there their ban on politicization of major events so long as it pushes their particular agenda the police have ID'd this guy it does raise some questions about the the lack of purpose in American society there a lot of folks today talking about relationship between gaming and all of this that of course is spurious this was first of all not a violent video game so you can't even make that connection it was it was a football video game but the idea that you are a professional video game player at 24 years old and they basically our job consists of sitting in a room alone and playing video games I can't say I think that that's great for society that more and more people are doing that and that's not a rip on people play video games we have tons of people at the office who play video games tons of people who play Madden but it seems to me that part of a well-rounded life should be getting out a little bit more and it appears that this guy was not getting out a little bit more as I have said about mass shootings before we do have a problem of masculinity in our society not that all masculinity is toxic but the opposite if you do not task young men with going out this guy's 24 I was married by the time I was 24 I had a job by the time I was 24 years old I graduated from law school by the time I was 24 the fact that 24 years old in American society now is considered a kid that the level of responsibility that attaches to people in their mid 20s is basically zero they are expected to live at home mooching off your parents not for reasons that you have family solidarity but just because you don't want to pay your bills and that you do this all the way until you're basically 30 and then you start looking to get married and have a family the prolonged adolescence of young men is not good for American society for a variety of reasons now is that leading to an uptick in the number of mass shootings like this it seems like there is some basic connection I don't think that it is the main factor I think that there are a bunch of factors that are that are conflated here but to refuse to acknowledge that young men are not being treated with the level of responsibility necessary from the time there are teenagers to mature into fully blown adult human beings who are capable of handling their lives is a mistake also it'll be interesting to see what this guy's psychological history was and how well it was taken care of okay in just a second I want to talk about what I think is actually the in some ways the worst story of the day but first we're gonna have to go over to Daily wire calm so for $9.99 a month

goodies when you subscribe to the website behind the scenes stuff and discounts and all sorts of fun stuff so go check it out right now we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation hey this is the worst story of the day it really is a terrible story and it speaks to the liberalisation of the Catholic Church and a serious problem with institutional protection so a few weeks ago we talked about probably two weeks ago we talked about the scandal that broke out in the state of Pennsylvania with regard to the archdiocese in Pennsylvania covering up over 30 years a thousand cases of child molestation in the church and we talked about the problems that exist within every institution the tendency to cover for the problems of an institution in order to quote/unquote protect the institution and this exists not only in the Catholic Church it exists in various religious communities around the country and around the world it exists in government's certainly it exists in public schools there's always the human instinct is to feel solidarity with a particular structure you find to be important and then whenever that structure is threatened particularly if it's threatened routinely you tend to circle the wagons and defend anything that's happening in house and this is how you end up with the with the quiet a sense to true evil that happens so often around the planet you wonder how Nazi Germany happened basically there's a population that for bad reasons and wrongly felt threatened by the outside world decided to circulate basically circle the wagons around the Nazi regime and then the Nazi regime decided to kill all of the enemies of the people including the Jews and people went along with that because the in-group was more important than the out group and the out group was threatening them in-group out-group politics is deeply important when it comes to understanding how institutions get perverted from the inside well now there's stories that basically the institutional perversion of the Catholic Church has reached up to the top levels of the Catholic Church this is from the the NC register the National Catholic Register in an extraordinary 11 page written Testament a former apostolate apostille ik nun Co to the United States has accused several senior prelates of complicity in covering up art Bishop Theodore McCarrick allegations of sexual abuse and has claimed that Pope Francis knew about sanctions imposed on then Cardinal McCarrick by pope benedict xvi but chose to repeal them Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano 77 who served as apostolic nuncio in Washington DC from 2011 to 2016 said that in the late 2000s Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis and that Vigano personally told Pope Francis about those sanctions in 23rd so McCarrick has been accused of sexual abuse of young seminarians he's also been accused of engaging in homosexual acts with a bunch of people who are under his auspices which is a violation obviously of church code and Church conduct and he was not turned over to the proper authorities the there are no allegations that the church knew about him molesting underage boys but if the if such allegations had existed in the church didn't turn him over to the secular authorities it's a serious problem the truth is that the the question of church justice just historically speeching speaking stretches back a millennium it stretches back all the way back to when you know Henry the second trying to say that we should actually try priests in secular courts in Great Britain at the very in England in you know the in the 12th and 13th centuries so the sort of battle between secular and and church has been going on for a very long time but one of the premises of the idea the church should handle its own business is that the church will actually handle its own business the church did not handle its own business according to Archbishop Pagano he said in his written statement simultaneously released to the register and other media that Pope Francis continued to cover for McCarrick and not only did he not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him but also made mckarrick his trusted counselor Mikado's story has now been backed by a couple of other sources he said the former Archbishop of Washington advised the Pope to appoint a number of bishops in the United States including Cardinals blade I think it's pronounced blaze ku pitch of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark Archbishop Pagano who said his conscience dictates the truth be known as the corruption has reached the very top of the church's hierarchy ended his testimony by calling on Pope Francis and all those implicated in the cover-up of Archbishop Makarios abuse to resign the accusation basically suggests that McCarrick has abused legitimately dozens of people the media has reported written written reports of victims of abuse spanning decades including a teenage boy three young priests or seminarians and a man now in his 60s who alleges that McCarrick abused him from the age of eleven the Pope later accepted mechanic's resignation from the College of Cardinals but Vigano wrote the Benedick much earlier had imposed sanctions on mckarrick similar to those handed down by Cardinal parolin the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living he was forbidden to celebrate Mass in public to participate in public meetings to give lectures to travel with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and he said the sanctions were applied as far back as 2009 2010 Benedict's measure came years after archbishop Madonna's predecessor at the nunciature had immediately informed the Holy See as soon as they had learned of Archbishop Makarios gravely immoral behavior with seminarians and priests basically the accusation here is that all of these memos were ignored by the top levels of the of the College of Cardinals and the papacy McDonald claims he wrote several memos to a series of Cardinals who repeatedly refused to do anything about this they basically gave in to what he essentially calls a homosexual clique in the Catholic Church Logano says that he personally repeated the sanction to mckarrick and the Cardinal muttering in a barely comprehensible way admitted he perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house but he said this as if it had no importance Vigano says in his testimony apparently Pope Francis knew about all of this he said it was clear that from the time of Pope Francis's election McCarrick now free from all constraints had felt free to travel continuously Seve lectures and interviews he said mckarrick who backed Pope Francis became the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration he says that appointments about their Cardinals were orchestrated by mckarrick it is a massive massive scandal and Catholics are in there there are a lot of traditional Catholics who are looking at this and wondering if Pope Francis can actually survive this whether Pope Francis should step down for having helped to cover all of this up because Pope Francis has been extraordinarily soft on LGBT issues it's something media have taken note of for a very long time and there's a feeling among traditional Catholics that perhaps his softness on those issues led him to basically look the other way with regard to this Archbishop McCarrick who's actually engaged in violations of Catholic code with other seminarians alongside allegations of him molesting underage kids really really troubling stuff but again any institution that refuses to cleanse itself is going to pay the price for all of this do you Pope Francis tweeted out something insane about this he tweeted out something like he prays for the victims he prays to Mary for the victims and it's like dude you're the Pope now it's time for you to actually do something about it right you're seems like you could be in a position to help God out here I mean I'm not I'm not a Catholic but it seems like if you're the Pope you might be in a position to actually you know help cleanse the Catholic Church of this stuff as opposed to just vague references to prayer I I'm not usually person who says that prayer is not an answer but when it comes to you having the power to do something about this at the head of a church to cleanse your own church of this stuff you're gonna need to do more than pray about this one a time God this one's on the church and after and this is true for Jewish communities and Catholic communities and Protestant communities and Muslim communities it is true for every community a community that fails to cleanse itself of evil is a community that that becomes complicit in that evil okay meanwhile a lot of controversy today breaking out over Tiger Woods what did Tiger Woods do that was so awful that was so terrible so apparently he was asked about after his final round of the Northern Trust about his relationship with President Trump and here's what he said he said well I've known Donald for a number of years he said we played golf together we've had dinner together I've known him pre presidency and obviously during his presidency and then he was asked about being threatened by Trump in his policy when would said well he's the president of the United States you have to respect the office matter who's in the office you may like dislike personality or the politics but we must all respect the office and then asked if he had any more to say about the state and discourse of race relations would said no I just finished 72 holes I'm hungry and this of course led to a massive controversy why isn't Tiger Woods such a powerful voice speaking up on issues of race relations Tiger Woods is the reason people are still watching sports gay people had stopped watching golf because Tiger Woods became a relevant Tiger Woods is relevant again and people are watching the last thing Tiger Woods should be doing is talking about politics in sports you want to destroy the last common area we have left in common destroy the sporting world by polarizing it around issues of politics suggest that every celebrity has the necessity to talk about every political issue Under the Sun there's kind of a running joke on Twitter these days about Taylor Swift because Taylor Swift has basically stayed out of politics as well and so anytime there's some sort of issue people will start joking Taylor Swift's silence on this issue is deafening because the the joke is that the media expects all these public figures who have nothing to do they're not famous from politics to start sounding off about politics because celebrity dominates our politics it's really bad president from tweeted out about this is a 17 he tweeted out the fake a news media we're tired to get Tiger Woods to say something he didn't want to say Tiger wouldn't play the game he's very smart more importantly he's playing great golf again okay so President Trump is right about this it's not particularly smart to him to draw attention to it because now Tiger Woods is going to be badgered beyond belief by the media even more than he was before and now it looks as though Tiger is tacitly supporting the president which will force him to come out and say something against the president you can see how this is exactly going to play out right you can see how this is gonna work Trump says something Tigers now forced into a corner to say he doesn't like a lot of Trump's policies from turns on Tiger it turns into a Trump vs. Tiger fight which maybe is what Trump wants out of all of this maybe it's not what he wants maybe he doesn't care and he just tweet stuff out but the bottom line is did Tiger do the right thing yes Tiger did the right thing on our Sunday special this week we had on Clay Travis Clay Travis sports commentator and he has a new book coming out called Republicans by sneakers - which is a line from Michael Jordan because during the 1990s Michael Jordan didn't get political and a lot of the people in the media wanted him to get political he said listen Republicans buy sneakers also why would I a lien ate half of the population there's no reason for me to do that Tiger Woods made the right move here it is none of Tiger Woods's purview to talk politics he's not an expert on the issue but we have this weird tendency in American life now to think that everybody is an expert on everything and the more prominent you are in any field the more you are an expert on something so you'll see people who have become very rich in the hedge fund area and suddenly we think they're experts on politics I mean this is why Trump is president right Trump is not an expert on politics Trump actually doesn't know all that much about politics he has some gut level instincts many of which are good some of which are not good but people think he's an expert because he's very rich we want we all now abide by the line from Fiddler on the Roof there's a there's a line in if I were a rich man where Tevye is singing tight via the the peddler is singing and he and he's talking about what it's like to be rich and he says the the most important men in town will come to call on me they'll come and they'll ask me questions and they'll ask questions that would cross a rabbis eyes and it doesn't matter if I answer right or wrong when you're rich they think you really know and that's exactly right I mean this is the way that our politics works now Tiger Woods is very good at golf so we think he should say something about politics because he must know he mustn't know about the intricacies of race relations because Tiger Woods hits a golf ball for a living now LeBron James must know everything there is to know about politics and have important things to say on politics because he's very famous and because he plays basketball and this is not saying that he should shut up and dribble he can say whatever he wants it's our fault that we polit that we take celebrity seriously not their fault if celebrities want to talk that's their issue but if you want to alienate half the population if you want to drive people up a wall if you want ESPN to continue declining in the ratings please keep asking Tiger Woods what he thinks of President Trump let's do that let's do a lot of that you want to destroy what's left of our common culture all you have to do is keep pushing this idea that our celebrities should be spokespeople for the policies that you particularly like it's ugly stuff and it makes for a worse country which is why ESPN is declining in the ratings that's why people are watching less and less of sports and it's why the media's focus on the politicization of every angle of sports is actually making star secondary I'm a baseball fan you know many baseball fans want to see more of Mike Trout on TV the answer is virtually every baseball fan we can't even see Mike Trout on TV anymore because we're busy battling out kneeling for the national anthem an issue that has really very little bearing on anybody's life when the continuation of this polarization is only gonna make our politics worse I think things are likely to get worse before they get better in American life and that's not a good thing that's that's a that's a very dangerous thing okay it's time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so let's get to some things that I like this is so over the weekend Neil Simon died so it wasn't just John McCain Neil Simon died at the age of 91 he is am obviously one of the kind of great American playwrights and his most famous play was The Odd Couple which was made into a movie with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau it's a hysterically funny movie a particular the first half of the movie is really really funny here's a little bit of the trailer for The Odd Couple starring Jack Lemmon on hypochondria a fussbudget neater the neat cleaner than please no wonder his wife kicked him out hmm that's not bad honey what are you doing I'm trying to clear up my ears and open up fat yeah they think I sprained my throat Walter Matthau another guy whose wife left him and his pad looks like she left it a long time ago who wants food what do you got I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches we're 21 what's the green see the very new cheese or very old meat I'll take the brown eye it is it's a really funny movie and it's it's worth watching he also did the maybe we'll do a Neil Simon this week like a bunch of Neil Simon stuff because there's a bunch of great Neil Simon plays that that he did that are really funny and really good and so we'll check some of that out this week The Odd Couple is his best and you should definitely check Walter Matthau is just fantastic in the part Jacqueline and Walter Matthau have great chemistry which is why they were still doing grumpy old men all the way up till the time when they were in fact grumpy old men okay the the okay other things that let's just do a thing that I hate right here so things that I hate The Daily Mirror is now pushing man bras I am not kidding you man bras okay and here is what they are saying they're saying lacey bras for men are now a thing and you can also buy matching knickers okay k and i ck ers okay it's a British word hey I did not just say racial slur I just want to make that absolutely clear because I would never say a racial slur like that but I want to make absolutely clear so Media Matters doesn't suggest that I would ever say a racial slur because I just pronounced a word for undergarments in in in British okay so I just want because that's the way that this industry works now so here is what the here's what the Daily Mirror says ladies if you've ever looked at your man's underwear and thought it was a bit dull then you're not alone hey I don't know a single lady who has ever looked at men's underwear and thought it was a bit dull they say there's so much choice when it comes to women's underwear from to Brazilian and Bridget Jones style pants not to mention strapless multi-way and water bras most men have only boxers or briefs to choose from you know why because women don't operate with regard to sex the same way that men do they don't okay women aren't like the men we'll check out pretty much any women that is moving because that is evolutionarily but it's it's evolutionarily beneficial for men to check out women and women's don't think about sex in exactly the same way which is why men find the unclothed female body a lot more attractive than women find the unclothed male body as a general rule this is not to say that women aren't into sex but it is to say that you compare men's view of sex to women's view of sex is obviously ridiculous and it's one of the reasons why prostitution is a largely is an industry that almost entirely caters to male and why pornography is an industry then almost entirely caters to males in any case we're now going to try to pretend that women are exactly the same about sex as men are and that women are into men dressing like ladies which is real weird so the Daily Mirror says this is all about to change as one lingerie company has created a unique line of bras and undergarments going to change the word especially for men Hey hum Mystere is selling lacey bras matching underwear and for the male who wants to wear something a little more sexy under his clothes as if that's not enough men can get their own silken ids baby dolls and body suits no no this is according to the website it's not just the men getting a kick out of the soft luxurious underwear the women love it too okay quick survey of the women in the room is this something that you're into just you need to stop vomiting back there why are you vomiting hey into the trashcan please no women are not into this I love that I love that people actually posted reviews of this and we're not embarrassed as a review posted for the turquoise Annabelle bra said so sexy my girlfriend loves me in this and the matching panties then let me suggest that your girlfriend may in fact be into other types of things as well okay like if you're dressing a man as a lady maybe she's just into the ladies because this is not a thing it's not even close to a thing one man reviewing the Tiffany sleepwear set commented the material feels so soft and sensuous to the touch and feels so on and feel so comfortable you could sleep in at all night if it wasn't so sexy okay I got nothing I got nothing daily mail thank you for that I'm glad that you've made the world a significantly worse place today and it was already an unbelievably crappy place after the news of the weekend the equation of men and women with regard to sex is one of the Dumber things on the agenda of feminists and radical leftists this idea that women treat men's bodies the same way that men treat women's bodies is essentially insane it's essentially insane it's just crazy because men and women's brains do not treat sex the same way and to pretend that what women really want out of men is for men to be more feminine is is totally nuts it's totally crazy there's not there's not a straight woman alive who wants men to be who wants men to be more feminine just as there is no straight man alive who's interested in women being really really masculine what I really want my wife to be is more like a man okay that's not a thing so the separation of sexist is one of the great things about life and the attempt to destroy that with stupidities like this the truth is that the Daily Mail is just looking for clickbait and they got it I had to give it attention because it's so insane but it's we need okay we need to stop showing these pictures because it's just too horrifying it's just too terrible all the way all the way around is the audio working again or is it or is it still out of commission it's still okay fine so we all have to break here today we'll save some of our goodies for tomorrow but we will be back then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro
