you got it
I arrived in Sydney five and a half
hours ago my first time ever on the
entire continent of Australia and I'm
being picked up here in my hotel in like
one hour to go do rehearsals for the
YouTube event that I'm here for it was
raining this morning when I got here and
now is like sunny and lovely outside so
that I'm gonna try to get out of this
hotel room superfast
here in Sydney much like London they
drive on I've gotta remember which side
of the road to be on while skateboarding
Sydney Opera House I feel like that was
the only thing on my list of things to
see while here now that it's been
checked off go back to New York
this is incredible I'm in the Botanical
Garden which is right next to the hotel
everything smells nice it's clean
everybody smiles at you
Australia FTW
train
what do I need to know about Australia
it's hot
I'll get blurr friendly have you got two
days two days go to the beach
what is the Australian policy on boosted
boards not policy the pretty chill let's
write them some fine very very fine okay
let's need one starts you think it is
absurd how friendly everyone has been
thus far if you make eye contact with
strangers in New York City you might get
cut but here when you make eye contact
and say hello nothing but smiles
it's 12:55 supposed to be just got one
I'm on time I'm good just have them fine
they'll set to find the hotel yeah ready
we're at the venue right now where the
event is tomorrow we're doing a bit of
rehearsal Jessica here basically
Jessica's job here in Australia is to
babysit me would you say that's a fair
characterization of your
responsibilities while here what to
babysit me yeah so Jessica's your
babysitter this is my night coffee today
I brought smoke to come off of me Ryan
when I walk on stage
it doesn't really stick what kind of
does and this lovely will point cross
here is for you my French and basically
just thing yeah yeah I don't like to use
teleprompters because I find it inhibits
my spontaneity so I'm gonna use the
teleprompter today just for her so I
just talking to my camera but now I'm
talking to I'm used a teleprompter stay
just for the rehearsal but then tomorrow
in front of the audience no teleprompter
we go
that rehearsal that I just did that was
it for my our responsibilities yeah for
today so now we can do it ever we want
the trouble is we don't know what the
hell to do with ourselves bon be when
it's pronounced Bondi do you want to go
plan those rocks over there okay cool
that's good yeah yeah so this this is
the world-famous Bondi Beach the trouble
is it's currently the offseason it's
like spring right spring ish right now
in Australia so it's not a super
opportune time to be here but we're
gonna make the most of it
they make across this chasm OCO you got
it you got it
nice
leaving the tides coming in are you
stuck
why don't you just jump this little
ravine right here did you just fall
you need help
sorry I feel like I abandoned you the
gentleman that drove us here said that
it was a little too cold to swim but
there are people swimming so I think if
it's sunny tomorrow you're down here
this is high tide came in just like you
warned I did word as you didn't listen
you know the triggers are you gonna be
able to get across this so sorry it's
hard to go out there
I was fine I wouldn't go under there
yeah time this one Jeff now they could
have made that every man for himself
we made it out no Falls no injuries no
wet feet minor minor injuries and wet
feet because she felt one besides that
we completely laid
I want to do is just curl in a ball and
fall asleep somewhere jetlag is kicking
my ass I think we're gonna leave the
beach cuz I'm just mumbling and
wandering and torturing for Jessica any
ideas what we should do
go eat more candy my gosh go eat some
candy yeah this is our car who's left
him in there for last couple hours how
you doing
did we miss anything bye bye
I thought the beach with you I'm
struggling I'm struggling
Jessica warned me she warned me about
what this jet lag would be like ah I
don't get jelly I travel all the time I
never get tired and the only way I can
describe what it's like right now is
sheer pain because Australia and New
York are like opposite sides of the
earth so it's a complete 180
I'm on the roof of the hotel thought it
might wake me up a little to come up
here it's pretty incredible of this view
my goal was to make it to seven o'clock
before I went to bed to try to combat
the jetlag
it is currently like 650 which I
consider a win so with that this
concludes day one of my Australia trip
tomorrow
a prompter today just for her so I was
just talking to my camera but now I'm
talking to I'm use a teleprompter okay
you can make me loud now am i loud have
an out now super loud voice of God
