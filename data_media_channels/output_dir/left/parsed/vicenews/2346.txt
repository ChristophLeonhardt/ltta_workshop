I thought I understood how the loans were
gonna work when I started, and
it's talking about the interest that's
accruing every day.
Right.
So, that's a little scary to look at.
At the same time that college has become
more important, it's become so
much more expensive and complicated than
it used to be.
Yeah.
And, it, it, it is just not possible for
the parents to be able to finance you
know, a,
a bunch of kids all at the same time.
And, and that's where, society's just
gotta make an investment.
I have the honor and the pleasure of
introducing, President Barack Obama.
Hello Atlanta.
The reason I want to come here today is
because I believe that higher education,
as you believe is one of the best
investments that anybody can make in their
future.
We're trying to make sure that across the
board, more and
more young people can afford to go to
college, and
then afterwards, aren't so burdened with
debt that you can't do anything else.
We're, we're gonna try something new.
It doesn't involve new spending or
bureaucracy.
It's just a simple organizing principle,
that I want all of us to sign on to.
A declaration of values.
What I'm calling a Student Aid Bills of
Right, a Student Aid Bill of Rights.
And it says, every student deserve access
to a quality affordable education.
Every student should be able to access the
resources to pay for college.
Every borrower has the right to an
affordable repayment plan.
Every borrower, has the right to quality
customer service, reliable information,
and fair treatment even if they struggle
to repay their loans.
It's a simple set of principles, that if
everybody signed onto,
it can focus our attention into one simple
basic idea, which is, make sure
that when you're doing the right thing
that you're society has got your back.
Thank you, everybody.
God bless you.
Thank you.
Hello, everybody.
Hi.
You got your crew here.
We do, we do.
We have our great students right here.
How are you?
Gabriel.
Gabriel?
Nice to see you man.
Good to see you.
Hi how are you.
Hi I'm Meyers.
Good to see you.
Hey how you doing?
What's your name?
Antoine.
Good to see you Antoine.
Good to see you too.
Alright.
Hi I'm Laura.
Hey Laura.
Good to see you.
So how's it goin everybody?
It's goin all right.
So, today, I've, I have been focused on
college affordability,
which is I assume is on everybody's minds.
Yeah
Yeah
Didn't you just
pay off your loans in 2004.
Yes.
2000, basically the year I was elected to
Senate.
The year before I became a US Senator,
was when we when we finished paying off
all of our loans.
Combined, Michelle and mine bill was
higher than our mortgage.
And, right now student debt, is actually
higher than credit card debt.
Over 40 million people currently with
student debt.
Yeah.
So this is a,
a massive generational challenge.
Yeah
There are all kinds of
things that we can do.
But it's gonna require cooperation between
the states, who have to put more money
into it, the federal government, who have
to think about how we can
lower the debt burden and make sure it's
managed better the student.
And the parents who are gonna have to be,
get, be better consumers and so
a lot of what we're trying to do is like,
know before you owe.
And figure out how to, you know, for
example graduate on time.
One of the things students think about is,
oh, I'll take five years,
I'll take fewer credits.
Not thinking about the fact that, if
you're not out in four years, you know,
each, each semester that you're taking,
you know,
that's just more debt so that's important.
And then, working with the schools to
partner with community colleges, and
even partner with high schools,
because you guys have already taken some
college courses, right?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
I read a little bit about your, each of
your backgrounds.
Give me a a sense of sort of how you think
about affording college, maybe we'll start
with the folks who are already in school
now and how you're thinking about debt.
Did you feel like, you had enough
information.
Cuz I, I know from Michelle and
my perspective, we didn't have a lot of
guidance going in.
We had to kinda make it up as we went
along.
How have things gone for you guys
generally?
We were talking, Laura and I, about, about
this earlier.
Yeah, so when I was in high school, I'm
from Sarasota, Florida.
And there really wasn't much guidance as
far as how to prepare for
college besides, you know, take AP
classes.
Right
That kind of thing.
Right.
So, my senior year, I pretty much got like
a game plan down.
Yeah.
I applied for
about 50 scholarships my senior year, and
I wrote about 70 essays.
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.
Yeah, it is.
It was like,
it was hard to keep up good grades while
doing that.
I can only imagine, yeah.
Yeah and.
How did that turn out?
It actually turned out really well for me.
But my little brother is currently going
through the same thing that I went through
as a senior.
He's really struggling.
So, it probably won't be the same for him.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was pretty
enterprising of you to,
to have that ability to go out there and
find it on your own.
So I would say my situation is very
similar to yours, as unfortunately,
I have a few scholarships pay my way
through school right now, so.
That's great
So
yeah
That's why you got a smile
on your face
Yeah
That's outstanding.
I just wanna see like, I guess me
personally wanna see that,
that opportunity like, I guess.
Available for everybody
Right.
Available for everybody
So how about, how about for you?
I'm from Georgia, so I had the
opportunity,
if I stayed in state, to receive the Zell
Miller Hope scholarships.
Exactly.
That's for high school students who keep a
certain grade point average and
it's financed by the Georgia lottery,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.
So,
my first year in college I had a
combination of student loans and
the Zell Miller scholarship.
My parents have been also taking out
private loans from 401K to help pay for
my school so I'm gonna have some debt to
pay off afterwards, for sure.
Are there other issues that you think
would have helped you or
that surprised you when you were going
through this whole process?
I thought I understood how the loans were
gonna work when I started, and
they said, you won't have to start paying
off your loans until after school.
Mm-hm
And
I get email quarterly that update me on
what my loan status is,
and it's talking about the interest that's
accruing every day.
Right.
So, it's a little scary to look at, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, Michelle'd spoken to your school,
right?
Yes.
Was she well behaved?
She, she didn't cause a ruckus?
No.
Okay, I wanna make sure.
And then part of her message was
encouraging folks to know how to
apply to schools, have a, have a,
a broader range of schools that they were
looking at, knowing what's possible.
So you guys are just going, about to go
through this process.
How, how, how are you thinking about it?
And so, honestly, like, I've always been
that top student, so academics is easy.
And I have a Presidential scholarship, but
with the cost of living, room and
board, tuition, and extra fees it's still,
it's almost no putting a dent in the
financial piece of what I need.
And so, it's almost like scholarships
don't matter.
And also, Antoine you were talking about,
you know, you got a great scholarship.
Yeah, yeah.
So I have, I'm an oldest of six children.
Mm-hm.
I have younger siblings like directly
behind me, one year, two year and they
plan on attending college as me, as well.
And I, fortunately I have a scholarship
and I, I will be attending college.
But the question is, like, how would they
able to attend?
Right.
Back to back in a two year span?
Right.
You know, for
families like yours where you've got a
bunch of kids and,
you know, mom who's working, maybe dad's
not in the home.
You know, that's how it was for me, I had
my grandparents who were helping.
It, it is just not possible for the
parents to be able to finance you know,
a bunch of kids all at the same time.
And, and that's where society's just got
make an investment.
At the same time that college has become
more important, it's become so
much more expensive and complicated than
it used to be.
Yeah.
And for most people your parent's age.
Mm-hm.
You know, the cost particularly of an
in-state school was pretty modest.
You might have a little bit of debt but by
the time you came out,
it was the kind of debt that you could pay
off in a year, maybe two years.
And that shifted.
Two things happened.
One was that state legislatures,
significantly cut back on their support
for state universities and colleges.
So all of these things have changed that
make it more challenging for all of you.
And that's part of why what we've done,
is, first of all,
cut out the banks from the student loan
program.
So that the money is going directly to
students.
That left more money for to For Pell
Grants and, and things like that.
Now what we're doing is we're spending a
lot of time working with colleges to have
figure out how you keep costs down.
And how do you make sure students coming
in know what they're going owe?
Because one of the big problems is that
university will recruit.
And say don't worry.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
You'll be fine.
You don't hear anything about it.
But you don't know what, and then in your
excerpt interview, as you're about to
leave, somebody in the financial aid
office says, oh, by the way-.
Here's your bill.
Interest has been accruing, here's how
much debt you got,
here's what your monthly payment looks
like.
Right.
And it's challenging.
One of the things that I proposed this
year was, making community colleges free.
For a lot of students the community
colleges is the pathway even to get into
a four year university.
Right.
And
if you can make that free then they can
transfer credits, and then the fewer
classes you have to take at the four year
institution which is more expensive,
you know, the less that you're gonna have.
It may turn that your siblings, some of
them, if they don't get scholarships,
may have to use this community college
route first.
It's still gonna be a good investment for
them though.
There is a difference of about $28,000 a
year, between
the average salary of somebody who's a
college grad and somebody who's not.
I mean, it's a huge spread.
So even if you're taking on debt, it's
still gonna pay off.
Previous generations, they had no debt.
And as a consequence, earlier on they
could start buying a home, or
they could start a business.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
You know, they were just able to save
money.
And for my generation, even, but
certainly the folks coming behind me, a
lot of folks, you know,
they're in their 40s and they've still got
loans that they're paying on,
which means that, you know, where that
money could have been used for
them to start a, start a life, you know,
might have been different.
I have a question, if I'm allowed.
Of course.
America used to fund,
you were mentioning a well, the states
used to fund education a lot more.
America used to fund education a lot more.
And now, we have a system where the
government actually makes money off of,
of the federal wealth.
How do we get back to funding education
and,
off the money that in many cases has
already been spent.
Well, couple things I'd say.
First of all, at the state legislative
level, governors and
state legislators have to understand that
probably the most important
competitive advantage they now have is the
quality of their workforce.
Mm-hm.
So you are defeating yourself if you're
cutting back on education spending,
and it's important for higher education.
But they used to know that.
What happened?
Well, part of what happened was the, the
no tax mentality locked in.
Once you started capping revenues, at the
same time
as things like three strikes are out,
criminal laws we've got into place.
Now you've got a huge demand for more
prison cells.
That money starts getting siphoned off
into a different place.
Healthcare costs start going and
fairness to a lot of states they had to
figure out how to pay for Medicaid.
So all those dollars start moving away
from higher education.
And you know, the idea of charging tuition
and
putting the burden back on the user, the
student, that became the,
the path of least resistance from a lot of
universities.
Now, you can make that up, by raising
taxes.
But once again it comes down to the
choices that we make as a society.
Do we think this is important enough that
we want to make that investment.
And I think we should.
Not everybody's gonna have to have a
four-year degree.
But everybody's gonna have to have
something about what
they were doing in high school.
Unless, you know, unless you're Lebrun
James, or, you know, or Kanye.
Anyone have a last question for the
President?
Suddenly, we're out of time.
I was just wanting to know what you were
hoping to get from talking to students
in Atlanta.
You know the, I'll be honest with you,
some of it's completely selfish on my part
when I talk to you guys I, I I get
inspired.
You know, I get excited about what the
future holds because, you know, I'm,
I'm now 53.
Malia's starting to look at colleges now.
So I've got a little bit of perspective.
And when I talk to you guys I, I, I get
inspired.
You know, I, I get excited about what the
future holds.
The world's in good hands.
We got, we got a next generation of people
who are gonna do great stuff.
And that makes me encouraged.
You guys, you guys encourage me.
Thank you.
All right?
Thank you, Mr. President for taking the
time.
I enjoyed it.
Thank you.
You guys want to take a picture together?
Yes.
Just, just so you can send it to mom.
Oh, yeah.
Hey mom.
All right, everybody say cheese.
Cheese.
When she selects nuance it's, you know?
Cheese.
We good?
Okay, we got it.
Thank you.
Fantastic.
Thank you for coming into our, our studio.
Good luck to you.
Thank you.
Good to see.
Congratulations your parents must be so
proud of you.
It's funny.
Take care.
All right.
