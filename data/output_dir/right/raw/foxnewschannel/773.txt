1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:00,845
FOR THE AIR FORCE.

2
00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:05,850
THAT EQUALS THE TOTAL FOR

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,052
ALL OF LAST YEAR.

4
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:08,286
TONIGHT WE CONTINUE OUR

5
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:08,987
SERIES LOOKING AT THE

6
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:10,755
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

7
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:11,456
FOR AMERICA'S

8
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:11,923
INFRASTRUCTURE.

9
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:12,924
THIS EVENING CORRESPONDENT

10
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:15,760
DOUGLAS KENNEDY REPORTS ON A

11
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,162
NEW WAY OF GOING A LONG WAY

12
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:19,130
IN A SHORT TIME.

13
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,999
>> THE VERY SIMILAR TO FACE

14
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:21,333
TRAVEL.

15
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,468
>> AS THE LEAD SYSTEM

16
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:28,773
ENGINEER AT NASA ANITA SAN

17
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:30,575
GUPTA NASA GOING SOMEWHERE

18
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:31,876
WE HAVEN'T GONE BEFORE SHE

19
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:33,044
IS TRYING TO GET US THERE

20
00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:33,378
FASTER.

21
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,180
>> TECHNOLOGY REALLY OUT OF

22
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,680
SCIENCE FICTION.

23
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,716
>> TECHNOLOGY INSPIRED BY

24
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:38,550
SCIENCE FICTION ACTUALLY A

25
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,050
SCIENCE FACT.

26
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,554
>> CALLED HYPERLOOP OR TUBE

27
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:43,822
TRAVEL AND ALLOW HUMANS TO

28
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:46,024
GO FASTER THAN THE FASTEST

29
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:47,392
HIGH SPEED TRAIN EVEN FASTER

30
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:48,760
THAN SOME OF THE FASTEST

31
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,098
PLANES IN THE SKY.

32
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:54,733
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO

33
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:56,468
KANSAS CITY TO ST. LOUIS OR

34
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:57,836
NEW YORK TO WASHINGTON IN 30

35
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:58,436
MINUTES OR LESS.

36
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:00,805
>> WE ARE TARGETING A SPEAK

37
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:03,875
SPEED SPEED OF 1,000 ROUGHLY

38
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:04,409
700 MILES PER HOUR.

39
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,977
>> TUBES CREATE A LOW

40
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:07,612
PRESSURE ENVIRONMENT ALMOST

41
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:09,347
COMPLETELY CUTTING OUT DRAG.

42
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:10,815
BUT IT'S THE MOTOR THAT'S

43
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:13,251
GOING TO ALLOW HYPER LOOP TO

44
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,020
COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY WE

45
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,387
TRAVEL.

46
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:16,921
SO YOU ARE BASICALLY

47
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:18,523
DESIGNING A STRAIGHT AND OUT

48
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,358
VERSION OF A CONVENTIONAL

49
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:21,126
REPORTER MOTOR.

50
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:22,160
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

51
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,695
IT'S CALLED LINEAR ELECTRIC

52
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:23,995
MOTOR.

53
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,163
WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU HAVE

54
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:26,331
A REPORTER BUT THEY ARE

55
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:27,899
ACTUALLY STRETCHED OUT.

56
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,567
ONE PORTION ON THE UNDERSIDE

57
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:30,802
OF THE VEHICLE WE CALL THE

58
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:31,736
POD AND THE OTHER SIDE ON

59
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:32,570
THE BOTTOM OF THE TRACK.

60
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,539
>> START UP COST WILL BE IN

61
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,507
THE BILLIONS.

62
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:36,508
NONETHELESS, MISSOURI AND

63
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:39,611
COLORADO BOTH WANT TO BE

64
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:44,249
TEST SITES CAN DATZ IS HYPER

65
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:47,085
LOOP LAY LIAISON ONE OF THE

66
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,286
OBSTACLES IS WRITING

67
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:49,454
REGULATIONS FOR BRAND NEW

68
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:49,854
TECHNOLOGY.

69
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:51,456
>> PRESSURE SYSTEMS LIKE

70
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:52,924
PLANES AND LAND SYSTEMS THAT

71
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:53,858
ARE LIKE TRAINS.

72
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,160
WHO IS GOING TO REGULATE ALL

73
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,427
OF.

74
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:56,194
THIS THE GOVERNMENT THINKS

75
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:57,862
WE ARE A RAILROAD BUT IN

76
00:01:57,862 --> 00:01:59,397
REALITY WE ARE A LOT MORE

77
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:00,131
LIKE AIRPLANES.

78
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:02,667
>> NO MATTER WHAT SAN GUPTA

79
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:03,768
SAYS HYPER LOOP IS THE

80
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:05,470
FUTURE OF ALMOST

81
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,037
INSTANTANEOUS TRAVEL.

82
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:07,439
>> WE HAVE NOT HAD A NEW

83
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,573
MODE OF TRANSPORTATION OVER

84
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:09,808
100 YEARS.

85
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:10,741
SO THIS IS A WAY THAT YOU

86
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,744
CAN GET FROM POINT TO POINT

87
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:13,478
ACROSS LAND MASSES.

88
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:16,548
>> ACROSS LAND MASSES BUT

89
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:19,117
LOCATED WITHIN CITY CENTERS.

90
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,385
SO YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SKIP

91
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:21,586
THAT LONG DRIVE TO THE

92
00:02:21,586 --> 00:00:00,000
AIRPORT OR TRAIN STATION.
