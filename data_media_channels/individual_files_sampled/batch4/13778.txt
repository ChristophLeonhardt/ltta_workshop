the Republican Party seems to be in big trouble after the collapse of their attempt to replace Obamacare recent polls by Democrat organizations that have been reported by Democrat news media show that Donald Trump has a historically low approval rating with Democrats who hate Donald Trump and that Republicans are universally despised by Democrats who despise Republicans but what about the Democrats themselves some prominent voices in the Democrat Party maintained that the party is doing fine including the New York Times editorial board CNN Raul Castro and a lunatic in Times Square who claims Jesus was a black guy but others feel the Democrats are having a hard time deciding what their message should be as they head into the 2018 midterms Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer says quote we must get out the word that Donald Trump is stinky and has cooties and that he is so mean he made the Statue of Liberty cry this is not the America I know and love but in America we're statues cry giant bronze tears because of the president's cooties if I can say this on television again and again while doing absolutely nothing to move the country forward I feel sure Democrats will win the vote of everyone who is against stinky cooties and doesn't want to see ladies statues cry unquote over in the house Democrat leader nancy pelosi issued a statement saying quote it's not true the democrats don't have a message our message is clear president bush must return my car to the place where i'm almost sure I parked it or the public will hold him personally responsible for this lipstick stain that somehow got on my forehead never before in the history of whatever country I'm in have so many words that didn't make sense caused me to accidentally lock myself in the bathroom with this message I know we can win if winning is what we want to do otherwise we cannot win unquote California congresswoman Maxine Waters who has become a hero to the anti-trump resistance by staunchly sticking to her position of blithering insanity say she will continue to hammer her message home until they take her back to the ward clear waters told reporters quote Donald Trump would be Hitler if Hitler owned black slaves and was named Donald Trump and had no slaves and wasn't Hitler his election marks the end of our nation as we know it the death of democracy and a tremendous explosion in which everyone is killed with blood and body parts flying from one end of my brain to the other this is my message to anyone who can hear the sound of my voice through these padded walls unquote another left-wing darling senator Elizabeth Warren added quote message sent by smoke signals across field of Tears to Great Spirit of white father who weeps no more forever unquote the Democrat confusion and division

with the Senate health care bill like just a massive explosion it has been destroyed it was already it was already on the edge right they only had 50 votes because Rand Paul and Susan Collins had already kind of opted out and now who else joined Mike Lee from Utah and Jerry Moran of cancer this is kind of interesting because Rand Paul I'm not in favor of this kind of this kind of look and I call it parading your principles around as if your principles mattered if no one was going to vote for you this is Rand Paul before this happened telling talking about why he wouldn't vote for this thing the real problem we have is you know we won four elections on repealing Obamacare but this bill keeps most of the Obamacare taxes keeps most of the regulations keeps most of the subsidies and create something that Republicans have never been for that's a a giant Insurance bailout Superfund that's not a Republican idea to give taxpayer money to a private industry that already makes fifteen billion dollars in profit so if this bill does not pass what happens well you know what I've suggested to the president and I talked to the president again you know when he was in Paris just this last weekend or I guess on Friday and I've told him I think we can still you know if this comes to an impasse I think if the president come jumps into the fray and says look guys you promised to repeal it let's just repeal what we can agree to and then we can continue to try to fix replace or whatever happened afterwards but the one thing we should do is try to repeal as many of the taxes as many of the regulations and as many of the mandates as we possibly can I still think the entire 52 of us could get together on a more narrow clean repeal and I think it still can be done okay so that's Rand Paul and everybody goes on what principle is gray he's got principle he's a guy stands up for repeal they said they were going to repeal they set it and said it for seven years why didn't they do it come on let's go and do it so that's Rand Paul talking about repeal and Mike leave you know the thing about Mike Lee is Michael II usually is a team player Michael he usually will go along he was working with Ted Cruz to craft an amendment he thought would save this but he put out a statement after conferring with trusted experts regarding the latest version of the consumer freedom Amendment I decided I cannot support the current version of the better care reconciliation Act in addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes it doesn't go far enough in lowering premiums for middle-class families nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations so now Mitch McConnell who at this point must be ready to eat some of these people for dinner Mitch McConnell says sorry we'll have a vote on repeal so what happens and and the president is also Trump is tweeting out about three different things at once he says yes we should repeal it What did he say Republicans should just repeal failing Obamacare now and work on a new health care plan that will start from a clean safe DIMMs will join in as if where that came from I don't know but then he also tweeted we should just let it fail which is what he's kind of been saying from the beginning that was his political instinct from the beginning okay so now moderate Rob Portman from Ohio do we have this cut that we get to work on it great let's let's put on what he says about full repeal so I have to look and see what the so-called repeal bill entails but it is a bill that simply repeals I believe that will add no more uncertainty and the potential for you know Iowans to pay even higher premiums higher deductibles so what to see obviously we would look for a CBO analysis of that to see what it involves in terms of that's not just premiums inductor bills so you know I'll take a look at it but I'm concerned about something that would simply repeal on its impact on costs and choices in health care rut row suddenly these now remember these guys 48 of the sitting senators I believe this is the right number 48 voted for repeal like two years ago so who is this good for it's great for talk radio it's great for right-wing talk radio because right-wing talk radio sells outrage because outrage is like cocaine and they know you're addicted to it and you know feels so good to be already said I'd say like I have to break this to you remember when your mom told you that a fat man comes down your chimney on Christmas she was lying - when we had competitions do this stuff and by the way it's not the politician you're yelling at it's the voter it's the voter that's why you won't do it that's why they won't repeal it they won't repeal it because their voters are throw them out of office they're trying to save their jobs now you say that you sit there and you say well they said this and the principle and we want freedom and they said then they live and all the stuff my question is this where is the so-called realism that that right-wingers are always bragging about right I hear people saying well you know if this were Ted Cruz it's not Ted Cruz if we didn't vote for Donald Trump we did if Donald Trump weren't present he is you know so what i cuz i got the reason is kept to me as i get this letter every single day because what I said and what I still say is they should have given Trump the win they should have given that sautron cares about you know is this Trump's fault in a sense yes of course it is because Trump doesn't care about policy he doesn't care about ideology he told you this when he was running he cares about the wind he wants the win and then he'll move on and he wants the economy to take off me once you'll like him for fixing things which he feels that he's good at doing he said this was going to be easy he didn't realize it's not so easy and when you don't have the thing about Obama Obama was a visionary he had a vision of a weak America buried under socialist regulations where the elites told you what to do and you did them that was his vision crap vision yeah but it was a vision he was willing to sacrifice the majority in Congress to get his vision through he was willing to do dirty deals he was willing to you know do anything just to get that legislation through because he knew once you give people stuff they won't give it back once you give people people we were talking about this yesterday people will sell their freedom for free stuff this is not new this is the law of human nature okay remember remember your Bible right Moses God brought plagues down on Egypt massive miraculous incredible plagues that had never been seen before until Pharaoh let the people go they ran out and the army came after him they hit the Red Sea and Moses parted the water the water of the sea moved apart they went through the sea on dry land the armies followed me armies were destroyed and then they said we're starving more hungry we want to go back to Egypt when we were slaves we had food that's what people do that will give you their freedom for food and they don't even think like well you did all these myrrh don't even think like American freedom made us the richest most powerful freest best country on earth maybe we should just stick to that it's like now you know we're going through an economic slump we want free stuff that's what people will do and that's who these senators and congressmen have to go back and face so they're going to be cynical they're going to be calculating they're going to do what they think will get them reelected every single time and if you're going to be outraged about that if you're going to live in your outrage well that'll feel good but you won't get anything done I just want to know where the realism is I am a rock rib conservative I think this health care bill should be thrown out burned I think the people who passed it should be tarred and feathered I think we should have a free-market health care I think it would work I think there should be some provision for the poor I think there always has been provision for the poor in America but I think there should be provision for the poor but I think normal people should have to pay in a free market for their health care not going to happen not now not now if they had passed something they could have then engineered a new free market that would have sucked the energy away from the Obamacare structure but it ain't going to happen now I mean and this is why this is why the left is gloating here is Chuck Schumer standing on top of the Obamacare bill and exalting okay didn't work out as well as he thought but but look at if we want to really go to the spokesman of the Democrat Party let's go to Joe Scarborough on Morning Joe because it's really the media that runs the Democrat Party now let's look at him gloating over this the greatest risk to Donald Trump the greatest risk to the Republican majority may not be the Russian scandals it may not be the indiscriminate tweeting it may not be the unpresidential behavior it may not be the questing of checks and balances of may not be actually throwing aside every sacred tradition of the United States government over the past 240 years it may be the inability to get things done because Donald Trump's cheap promise above everything else was I can make Washington work it's broken but don't worry I'm a deal maker this is easy we're going to do so much and we're going to win so much that you're going to get tired of winning and what he's actually fighting is if somebody said earlier this morning that easier to stamp your name on buildings on stakes and on online university courses than it is to actually run Washington DC and get significant legislation passed and this was quite the failure Mika and Micah's smirking so much that her facelift started to bleed again okay that don't laugh at that if you just you just encouraged me when I say things like that uh you know we were talking I was talking yesterday to Michel Noel's king of trolls Michel moles and we were talking about the fact that he and I are doing a one of my new novel as a podcaster going to be doing that and you know so much of what I do I was reflecting after this is so much of what I do for a living didn't exist when I started working I mean so much I mean I've invented apps or I've helped invent apps doing podcast there were no podcasts what 10 years ago there was no such thing as a podcast so much of what I do all I ever wanted to do was write novels and I still write novels but they let's face it they've become a little bit archaic a little bit buggy whip you know so that I've gone into new ways of telling stories and new ways of expressing myself as the technology existed and on the way I've had to learn new skills and that is why there's something Skillshare because on Skillshare what skill share is it's an online learning community with over 15,000 classes in just about anything you can think of design business there's stuff on photography on marketing on entrepreneurship and then stuff on like just hobbies you might want to have like music and calligraphy and things like that you can learn just about everything on these tapes they're very short little classes and you can take a whole series of them and you get unlimited access to all of this for a low monthly price it's not one of those things where they have what are they call them in app purchases where you get into the class tapping through that'll be another 10 bucks you pay for on the part of the community and you can take just any class you want I them out I've tried out the ones on writing just to see because I thought I probably know a lot about writing I'll see if they're any good they really are marketing something I'm not as good at but I've had to learn as I've gone along as the Internet has become more of a thing Skillshare comm has stuck on all of this so that as you go forward and as things change under your feet you don't get caught short Skillshare is giving my listeners a month of unlimited access absolutely free I always feel when I'm talking about this stuff you know like you don't have to be that smart to take advantage of free free is like cheap you know it's free so go to WWE share calm slash Andrew and you'll get a free month you can test out all the truss WW Skillshare comm slash Andrew and get a free month of skill share a lot of stuff to learn mailbag is tomorrow that means you got to subscribe if you want to get your questions in answers are guaranteed a thousand percent correct that day over did I overdo that oh yes but if you subscribe and if you subscribe for a year you get the left this tears mug which will keep your leftist ears nice and cold as it keeps my coffee warm so come on over to the daily wire.com we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube we'll see you over there so what I'm trying to say here what I'm trying to say is the lord acton rule okay the lord acton rule is that we who believe in freedom are always in the minority and a way you fight in a minority is different than the way you fight in a majority you say well we have the house we have the senate we have we have this present the white house we don't we don't not the people who believe in freedom what once you start giving look at some point people want or will sell their freedom for free stuff right we know this from the Bible we know this from all of human history that happened basically here during the Great Depression suddenly it was art were there no graves in Egypt you know they was there was a Great Depression they suddenly wanted all these programs they voted in FDR FDR took advantage of it they lost that argument right there we lost the argument about whether there was going to be a welfare state once there's a welfare state there are two parties there's the party that wants to grow the welfare state fast because they want power those are that's the evil party and there's the power that wants to slow them down because they're paying lip service to freedom because they need that contingent to get elected that's the stupid party that's us okay we we who would like to see all of the swept away who would like to see freedom come back we are in a minority and we have to fight like we're in a minority and it entails compromise it entails linking up with other parties other contingencies other contingents in the in the party to get a majority it entails a lot of frustration and a lot of anger but if we just a Petaling outrage because we're not getting what we want we're not living in reality and I think that that is what's happened I think that's why guys like Rand Paul kind of get up my nose you know I watch Rand Paul and I hear people saying oh he has so much principle but what's his principle what does he accomplish what has he done to help Republicans govern when 2018 comes along and they've done nothing or if Obamacare collapses because they're going to get blamed for that - I don't understand how we maintain a majority we probably won't lose the Senate but look listen to Newt Gingrich he's telling the truth he's saying if they don't get stuff done they're going to be voted out we represent prosperity economic both higher take-home pay more jobs or not Trump you said you just said in my the president a minute ago talking about what he wants to do to make America great again I think that he's in the right general direction I personally believe that how to do as much as they can on health care right now but they shouldn't spend the whole rest this year on one issue they have also got to pass I think by Thanksgiving and get signed into law by Thanksgiving a very large tax cut retro actively designed back to January 1 to make sure that we have enough economic growth in 2018 the Republicans can run as the party of prosperity of jobs of higher take-home pay and of economic growth and I would I would say the highest focus ought to be on getting the tax bill through because if we don't have economic growth next year I think we're in real danger of having Speaker Nancy Pelosi on in 2019 if we do get enough economic growth I think frankly we'll probably get reelected I think he's right about that but the problem is that the tax cuts were built into the the taxes were built into the savings of the health care bill because that way you could get through with this reconciliation process as long as Mitch McConnell keeps the filibuster in place he's giving a lot of power to the minority to obstruct and we know they will obstruct so we can't do that and plus I'm not sure the tax cuts will unleash the kind of prosperity they used to I think what we need is tax reform and with this group of cats I don't see their how they're ever going to get themselves together to do real tax reform which is going to be just as hard if not harder than health care so I think they're making a mistake here I really do I know you know everybody's charged up about the the principle of the thing and I know that they want they've promised full repeal they were lying I told you they were lying I told you they were going to continue to be lying there's not stop lying it's politics when you go to sleep and you wake up 25 years from now like Rip Van Winkle they're still going to be lying so I mean you you're going to have to learn to deal with that if you just want to drink your outrage that's that's fine but it's not going to get to anywhere so anyway I think that going forward it's going to be really interesting I hope they do bring full repeal to a vote I doubt they'll even be able to get it up for a vote but I hope they do bring it up for vote so you can see this is not going to happen if they bring up repeal and they peel Obamacare and they actually repeal Obamacare I'll say I was wrong because that would be that would be terrific I'll be really really surprised you know one of the things we're having right now on the right especially is we're having a problem between perception and reality you know this this this is thought going around I've now seen it at least three places I saw David girl enter wrote a piece in The Wall Street Journal I saw David Limbaugh is that Russia's brother's name David Limbaugh yeah I think so I know him I should know but but he wrote a piece for us yeah David wrote a piece for us saying that republic conservatives failed to fight against obama and that is why we needed donald trump evans say it was a good pal of mine he writes a piece in town hall very smart guy right-wing comedian he writes my leftist friends as well as many ardent never Trump errs constantly asked me if I'm not bothered by Donald Trump's lack of decorum they asked me if I don't think his tweets are beneath the dignity of the office here's my answer we right thinking people have tried dignity there could not have been a man a more quiet dignity than george w bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermines his presidency we tried statesmanship could there be another human being on this earth so who so desperately prized collegiality as john mccain we tried propriety has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney and the results were always the same this is because while we were playing by the rules of dignity collegiality and propriety to left has been for the past 60 years engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob the left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the children of the 60s to them it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale it has been a war they fought with violence the threat of violence demagoguery and lies from day one the violent takeover the universities till today the problem is that through these years the left has been the only side fighting this war while the left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way the right has continued to act with dignity collegiality and propriety with Donald Trump this has all come to an end Donald Trump is America's first wartime president in the Ultra War and we've talked about this a lot obviously I'm not against fighting a tough I am against fighting for stuff that isn't conservative I'm against shutting down fries they can shut down free speech and we can't they can shut down free speech and we can't because we are the good guys that's the hard part about being the good guys you can't do what they do because you stand for something you know but let me just point out the never Trump errs who keep telling us they're not never Trump presenting more because they it was just for the election say that this is all untrue that we've actually been winning we stopped Obama from passing any legislation after Obamacare basically and he had to do everything with his pen and his phone and that's why Trump was so it was so easy for Trump to repeal so much of it to get rid of so much of it with his pen and his phone okay we it costs him a thousand seats across the nation we've won states we've won state houses and local governments and we've won the all the majorities and so the never Trump errs are saying no we had it we were winning we're fighting here's here's the problem with that if you've got to explain to people that when you called yourself a never Trump er didn't mean never it didn't mean Trump you've got a problem communicating and if and if you were watching TV every day and watching movies every day and listening to you know college professors every day as all of us are and you're seeing this message this anti-american message coming out and it indecency and Evan is right the indecency with which they treat our candidates because remember they say terrible things about Trump but not just as terrible as they said about George W Bush and Mitt Romney the nicest person in America the single nicest person in America they just completely slandered him there's something wrong with this there's something there's a problem here you can't say well we're winning here and we're winning there if every day we're getting hammered over the head here's here's what evidence talking about and here's why I think he has a semi-decent point even though I disagree that we didn't fight I think we did fight we fought at we fought as who we are we fought as people of principle for principle we fought of people who think about policy for policy but we didn't understand we didn't fully understand that the media is not enough to shrug off the media and say well you just have to get used to the bias then has created this pervasive toxic cloud of anti-americanism we were talking about this yesterday this war for the Planet of the Apes how can they make a major motion picture in which the national anthem is portrayed as a vehicle of evil how can we let them make movies like this it's not let them they can they have the right to do it but why should this be a major summer picture in which the Alpha and Omega of Christ is portrayed as evil it's because we have lost this is the thing we have lost and this is the thing that people like about Donald Trump let me just review this piece this amazing piece from knucklehead Roe over under the New York Don so we really need a music sting for this we really I'm going to do this once a week I think I want something like hey hey hey ho ho ho here we go go go to knuckle head row row row because I'm just making I'm making this up off of the top line so here is a piece these are the stupidest people in America but they're also really wicked here's a piece called when it's speech violence in the New York Times a former newspaper by Lisa Feldman Barrett imagine that a bully threatens to punch you in the face a week oh this is a she's a psychology professor a week later he walks up to you and breaks your nose with his fists which is more harmful the punch or the threat the answer might seem obvious physical violence is physically damaging verbal statements aren't sticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me but scientifically speaking it's not that simple words can have a powerful effect on your nervous system certain types of adversity even those involving no physical contact can make you sick alter your brain even kill neurons and shorten your life if words can cause stress and if prolonged stress can cause physical harm then it seems that speech at least certain types of speech can be a form of violence but which types the answer depends on whether the speech is abusive or merely offensive a culture of constant casual brutality is toxic to the body and we suffer for it that's why it's reasonable scientifically speaking not to allow a provocateur and hate monger like Milo you novelists to speak at your school he is part of something noxious a campaign of abuse now scientifically speaking let me ask you that I found 8 years of Barack Obama stressful as hell I mean it scientifically speaking would it be all right to silence and would it be all right to keep him off our you know I mean this this these are the people we're fighting against and if you don't think they're ready to go all the way let us just take one quick look at what's happening in Venezuela okay remember we had Google Chavez now we've got this guy Maduro he's trying to basically destroy the Constitution that people are coming out there holding plebiscites they're rioting there's over 100 people were killed recently in in riots let us just not forget okay this is socialism this is congresswoman Ileana ros-lehtinen she was on the Bret Baier show last night it was it was sad she was thanking Bret Baier for having her on because no one will listen to her and she's calling for sanctions and she's talking about what happens in Venezuela right in our hemisphere because of socialism listen to this Venezuela you've got to remember all of you viewers was one of the richest most productive most powerful countries freest countries in all of Latin America it was a breadbasket for for Latin America now they don't even have wheat they don't have milk they don't have diapers they don't have medicine it's a basket case so it went from a bread basket to a basket case why because socialism and communism does not work and so the people are saying what what is ahead for us and that's why I respect what they're doing they're demonstrating peacefully in the streets but they're also going to the ballot boxes and they're saying yes so they're doing everything now it's up to us in the United States to sanction those human rights abusers in Venezuela and say I know you'd like to come to Disney World and visit Mickey Mouse well guess what if you trample on people's human rights you're not going to be able to come to the u.s. we're going to freeze your bank accounts we're going to confiscate your luxury condos and your your yachts and you decide treat the people with respect or you will not be able to come to the United States okay now chump is backing this he's saying he's threatening sanctions and all this stuff you're right you know the Democrats were screaming if you pass this if you do this people will die people are dying they are dying in Venezuela because of socialism because of Hugo Chavez and now is you know he's inheritor but Maduro is that yeah material now I just wanted this these are the people in our country that we are fighting against let's start from the outside okay we're going to start meet the outside the radicals and move our way in let's remember what Sean Penn said about Google Chavez's he went over and slapped his back and shook his hand and supported this he is one of the most important forces we've had on this planet a metaphor that my hypotonic attorney most alternative lenita and i will wish him nothing but that great strength he has shown over and over again he doesn't know until now my case that immense of what if I can p.m. ser Montezuma doors open I do it in love anymore and I do it in gratitude you know I'm fanatical so I I just want to say that it from my very American point of view get offa me m'lady gonna pop de arista of my friend as in each other I mean the representor were tired it is only possible to be so inspiring as he is at the two-way street people T do nothing you know going to a handler and he would say that his inspiration is the people oh all right so you can say that's Shawn tan and then they give you know he's basically he is basically standing there worshipping at the shrine of a dictator of the worst the worst kind of oppressive dictator as Sean Penn doesn't stop him from getting an Oscar if that was a right-wing dictator you can bet he would be out of the movie business he's not out of the movie business he's easy to cast he's going to win awards he deserves a war he's a great actor but that is what Hollywood is selling it selling it in the war the Planet of the Apes it's selling every day in their messages but let's move closer to the center let's move here is Bill Maher interviewing Bernie write about socialism and how great it is Wow how well it works my question to you I guess is the word socialist I want to get right to this because I want to help your campaign I want to see you get the nomination I want to see you we have to not get we have to teach American what this is we do and I I don't know if we're doing that yet okay I don't think most Americans realize they're already socialists in certain respects okay let's start off with the blood it is not what we want to change we want to deal with the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in America very few people think that it's acceptable or moral that the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90% that we have seen a pelipper ik but Bernie you always say that and I think even though even the Republicans are not for income inequality they hear that but it doesn't compute that that's going to be solved by socialism socialism is the program's they already like they like Social Security that socialist here they like Medicare they like the VA they like the military that's exactly right it's already a socialist on what we see this is the pernicious argument that once once you have a welfare state this is the pernicious argument you're going to have you like these programs you already sold part of you freedom for these programs for free stuff why not sell all of your freedom for free stuff I here left it left the state of me when I go off about regulations they always say well you want your meat inspected don't you I want my meat inspected but I don't want the lake and back of my house to be regulated as a waterway for the EPA to tell me when I can cut a tree down or when I can you know build something I don't want to get have to get a permit I don't have this the government for permission to live which is basically what they want what socialism is but so that is so that is a mainstream a guy almost one would have one probably the Democratic nomination if they hadn't plotted against and that's a guy that remember all those kids we saw yesterday saying social is great I don't know what it is but it's great but here's the thing Venezuela is about Cuba and this is something that nobody is talking about Venezuela what happened in Venezuela was engineered by Cuba and it's being held in place by Cuba this is they want let me let me read Mac I'll read it from Mary Anastasia O'Grady they've been a lot of articles about this recently but Mario Grady who I hope will have on the show soon is a Wall Street Journal as to what V Wall Street Journal columnist about South America okay and she says Cubans not Venezuelans control the levers of power Havana doesn't care about Venezuelan poverty or famine or whether the regime is in pop unpopular it has spent a half-century sowing its ideological revolution in South America it needs Venezuela as a corridor to run Colombian cocaine to the US and to Africa to supply Europe it also relies heavily on cut-rate Venezuelan petroleum which brings us to and energy ok this is what tyranny runs on this is what the arab pyrenees run on the muslim tyrannies run on it is what putin's tyranny runs on it is what cuba as and venezuela their tyrannies run on oil and the guy who is unleashed fracking who has cut back on on regulations so we can produce more energy and bring our energy levels up and start to export energy is donald trump it's the right that wants to do this on the left on the left these environmental agencies they are these environmental organizations that fight against fracking that fight against oil they're all of them they're funded by putin putin pikna pedals pushes dollars into them George Soros pushes dollars into them and Al Gore is their spokesman and he comes on TV and they worship him and he sells he's got his new movie coming out the inconvenience sequel I think it's called everything I said was untrue is that the new snow maybe that's not it even more Inconvenient Truth ISM so here's play the first al gore cut he's on The Today Show first of all the climate-related extreme weather events have become more destructive and a lot more common here in the US we've had 11 once in a thousand year downpour it's just in the last seven years so there's a we've been eleven once in a thousand year down personal global warming is causing the ring to fall the small ring it down to fall when did we measuring rainfall a thousand years ago years ago is that when we start measuring rainfall in the year 1000 I remember it was a monk the monk al gorgeous who was measuring rainfall a thousand years ago so he doesn't even know what he's taught he says stuff it's a stuff comes out of his mouth here's my point all of this stuff all of this stuff points in one direction it points to slavery it points to socialism it is all they talked about Don Trump jr. taking a stupid meeting with a stupid lawyer who had nothing to say from Putin all of these guys they essentially work for guys like Putin all of these guys want to stop our energy flow they essentially are serving Putin all these guys want to bar free speech who do they work for what are they looking for they're looking for tyranny they're looking for socialism the people want to fight this who saw in this last election that we were having a desperate moment a desperate moment where we were in danger of losing everything they were right they were right is Donald Trump a flawed instrument as we have said repeatedly from the very beginning a flawed instrument of that fight absolutely but he swept everybody else away and that should tell you something about the message of the Republican Party and the way the Republican Party is run and we're seeing that as the health care bill collapses and these guys Lee I'm sorry I you know some of them are people I admire to the hilt but these guys are sit around going I told you Donald Trump was no good they have to answer why why he knocked all those candidates down like ninepins they have to answer why the people look at them and say you're not helping me you're not doing what I need you to do is not enough to be right you have to win you also have to win Trump only cares about winning but the rest of us have to care about winning as well the Republican Party needs to get a lot smarter that we really are the stupid party and they showed it today and I think that the people who are screaming that the opposition is really really bad are absolutely right is so much worse than Donald Trump and anything that he has done or is likely to do which leads me to stuff I like politically incorrect mr. pieces.this you know I think I may have read this book when I was in high school but I thought I saw it and I thought I'm sorry read this I read it again it's a book called darkness at noon by Arthur Kessler Arthur Kessler was a Hungarian British journalist he was born in Budapest and he was educated in Austria and he joined the Communist Party of Germany until Stalin came in and he resigned in 1938 I think he was put in prison at one point in 1940 he published a novel the dark darkness at noon it's called about a communist official being put in prison during the Stalin purges of the 30s during the 30s Stalin just started to kill the old guard randomly essentially kill the old guard he believed in terror and he'd give he give quotas for how many people should be killed and people would be arrested for you know basically for picking their toes in Poughkeepsie because they would say you know oh I think the best thing to do would be to use this kind of equipment to drill for oil and they would say ah well Stalin says you now you're anti the party because Stalin says you want to use this equipment and they kill you they just take you in shoot you in the back of the head this happens to some of the people who had caused the revolution they were just carted off in this random madness and Kessler wrote this novel about a communist in prison basically being charged with being against communism during the thirties purges and it is unbelievable it is an unbelievable unbelievable beautiful piece of work that tells you everything you need to know about the psychology of left-wing tyranny everything you need to know it is just spelled out so beautifully this idea that you know the future because you figured it all out and you are the progressive so you know the future so anything that you do to preserve the future is justified so if I kill you it's fine because I'm preserving the future and you were against the future remember that's what Obama said when Trump left the Paris Accords he's against the future he's against the future or have it you know you don't know what the future is the future may look more like Donald Trump than Barack Obama the future may look more like Thomas Jefferson or George Washington than Barack Obama let us hope so Arthur Kessler was pretty well universally acknowledged to be kind of a jerk and there is some evidence that he was an actual rapist there is some that one of the most recent biographies then claimed that he actually was a serial rapist and when I say that I don't be somebody who grabbed women off the street but I mean if you were like his secretary and he walked into the room and you were he would actually rape you so they've actually been taking down his statues and doing everything they can doesn't matter the guy may have been the biggest jerk in the world this is a beautiful book darkness at noon it's very short it won't take you long to really take you a few days to read it it really is worthwhile and it and just remember just remember the same people that Bill Maher's of the world the Sean Penn's of the world the Bernie Sanders of the world Bernie Sanders spent his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in a slave state he went to a slave state to support it he believed in it these are the same people they are back today they're still supporting tyranny they have always supported it and Arthur Kessler and darkness at noon wrote an answer to them to show them what this was how this God has failed this this is a bad idea that has stayed alive in the hearts of these people and really it really is the fight that we're in it is not a fight about Donald Trump jr. took a meeting it really is not is not even a fight about Donald Trump's tweets it's not a fight a fight about Donald Trump's incompetence is inability to get the Senate and Congress in line it is a fight between freedom and liberty between freedom and slavery and you know we're just going to have to play it a lot smarter than we've been playing it tomorrow the mailbag get your questions in right this minute but you got to subscribe to the daily wired.com and subscribe for a year
