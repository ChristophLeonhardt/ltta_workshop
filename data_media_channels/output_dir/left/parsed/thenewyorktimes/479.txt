The HI-SEAS habitat was
created to simulate
an isolated, confined,
extreme environment.
And that involves isolation
in the form of being far away
from anything that remotely
looks like civilization.
We have really tried to create
an  environment where this is
what their life would be like
once they get to Mars.
when I walked into the
tool shed and they've got out
storage of food
There are about 50 cans of
Spam staring right at me
You know it's not so much that
things are going to be
difficult because we can solve
difficult problems but
not knowing what is going to
happen
creates a lot of fear.
We're all going to have our
anxious days and
down days.
Managing conflict is going to be
really important in the habitat.
But it is inevitable that
we'll have arguments and things.
Part of it is just
approaching this
all professionally.
You could list a whole
different set of reasons as to
why we should colonize Mars.
The strongest argument is still
that if we stay on Earth
the human race has
all its eggs in one basket.
Mars is a really important
planet to study because
the history of Earth
and the history of Mars
may be linked.
We can only really figure
that out by pushing
further into this unknown.
