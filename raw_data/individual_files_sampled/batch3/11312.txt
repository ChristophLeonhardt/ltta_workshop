shooting incident unfolded outside the National Security Agency HQ at Fort Meade at least several people have been taken to hospital according to an NSA statement their injuries not attributable to gunfire authorities say that incident is over and under control they've been sent out for an hour or two now let's get the latest a few Samira Khan can bring us up to speed there with what's happening from Washington hey Samira all right then so as I say this happened local time Russia authorities say it's now over but what actually went on there well the shooting took place just outside the NSA headquarters at one of its secure entry gates now like you said several have been hospitalized and according to local reports a security guard was injured and then taken to the hospital to the hospital immediately following the attack now we don't know the particulars regarding who was responsible but photos came out on social media showing a back van a black van and a handcuffed man sitting on the ground now you can also see bullet holes on the windshield of the van the FBI has sent personnel to respond to the incident but the NSA says that the incident is under control local authorities have warned that highway MD 32 is closed in both directions advising drivers to take alternate routes and expect long delays and a president Trump has reportedly been briefed on the shooting but we haven't heard anything else from the White House now this isn't the first time that there's been an attack at the NSA headquarters back in 2015 two men disguised as women rammed a stolen van into the agency's gates the attack left one person dead and two injured so far we're not sure if today's incident how many deaths are and how many injuries but we're just going to have to wait to hear from authorities yeah no tests we think at the moment unless they gets updated of course but certainly some injuries but at least it's not what he's saying as you say in the mirror no ongoing threat there but it is causing a lot of hassle around that rush hour although it's been a few hours now that that major road blocked off all right we'll come back to you more if you've got some latest let us know okay thank you
