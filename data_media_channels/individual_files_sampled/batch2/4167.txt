got breaking news president Trump on his way to the g7 summit right now he just spoke to reporters outside the White House and we're going to play those comments for you right now take a look seems it is coming out on my birthday maybe that's appropriate let's see this look he's a very dishonest man I've been saying it for a long time I think I did our country a great fire a really great favor when I fired him and we'll see what happens we'll see what the report says but I guess it just got announced it's coming out on June 14th so that'll be maybe a nice birthday present who knows we're going to deal with the unfair trade practices if you look at what Canada Mexico the European Union all of them have been doing to us for many many decades we have to change it and they understand it's going to happen what are you going to do the paper we are going to do very well now if we're unable to make a deal will terminate NAFTA will have a better deal if we are unable to make a deal we will be a better off right now we are not going to live with the deals the way they are European Union treats us very unfairly Canada very unfairly Mexico very unfairly with that being said I think we'll probably very easily make a deal I didn't say that I said I've been preparing all my life I always believed in preparation but I've been preparing all my life you know these one-week preparations they don't work just ask Hilary what happened to her in the debate so I've been preparing for this all my life and frankly it's really just two phases because if you run Peter just a little bit longer than flip you would see I've really been preparing all my life I said that but of course you know the news doesn't pick that up because it's makes you it's very interesting that they caught a leaker and a very important it's a very important liqueur so it's very interesting I'm getting information on it now happened last night it could be a terrific thing I know I usually strongly and freedom of the press I'm a big big believer in freedom of the press but I'm also a believer in classified information has to remain classified and that includes Comey and his band of thieves who leaked classified information all over the place so I'm a very big believer in freedom of the press but I'm also a believer that you cannot leak classified information I think it's very sad in fact I want to extend to his family my heartfelt condolences that was very shocking when I woke up this morning Anthony Bourdain is dead and I enjoyed the show he was quite a character I will say but so I just want to extend my condolences and also to the family of Kate Spade baby you could call it anything you want it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what you call it it used to be the g8 because Russia was in it and now Russia's not in it now I love our country I have been Russia's worst nightmare if Hillary got in I think Putin is probably going man I wish Hillary won because you see what I do but with that being said Russia should be in this meeting why are we having the meeting without Russia being in the meeting I would recommend and it's up to them but Russia should be in the meeting it should be a part of it you know whether you like it or not and it may not be politically correct but we have a world to run and as the g7 which used to be the g8 they through Russia out they should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia at the negotiating table thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
