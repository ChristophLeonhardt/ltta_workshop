00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in today's video I wanted</font>

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,659
to address something had come up quite a

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot in your questions on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and on</font>

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,529
Twitter I just wanted to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,210
ideas of traveling part<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason I</font>

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,130
Piper's program was not simply to have a

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">different kind of mentality when it came</font>

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,240
to teaching the more liberal arts

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,160
curriculum nor for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standards of</font>

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,500
teaching that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I map huh</font>

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,660
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also wanted to see as much as</font>

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,760
possible as I could offer us in picking

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,949
that time apart what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean when</font>

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,480
people still say and we're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,519
out or I winner I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take some</font>

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">time to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go and see the world like</font>

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,210
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that mean is that a loaded</font>

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,579
statement like does that still have

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,559
these like echoes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> chloe's and are we</font>

20
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,750
going to these places to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out how we</font>

21
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,550
can control them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my battery is now</font>

22
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,260
running on reserve power there are we

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,820
really much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that and we're</font>

24
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually getting because we want to have</font>

25
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,930
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an insight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into how other people</font>

26
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,610
have developed so it's to control them

27
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,860
just for the noble goal of more

28
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,690
knowledge if that's a noble goal at all

29
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,879
questions from about the mid sixteen

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,739
hundreds to about the mid eighteen

31
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,750
hundreds of so there was a grand tour

32
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,270
that very rich british men would take

33
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,430
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> europe and the idea was that</font>

34
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,740
you'd go to places like Italy where you

35
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,810
would see the Italian art at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

36
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,610
Coliseum and you would see everything

37
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,670
where the Roman<font color="#E5E5E5"> Empire was kind of the</font>

38
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,130
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> of roots of Western civilization</font>

39
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,680
you go to these places to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of have a</font>

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,530
sense of where you belong in that story

41
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,900
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the myth</font>

42
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,990
behind I guess the UK and how it came to

43
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,210
be and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowledge and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their thinking</font>

44
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,860
in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that's died out but in</font>

45
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,380
another sense we still go to travel like

46
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,240
a lot of my friends went on gap yours

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,460
saw the world so what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I've</font>

48
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,710
been thinking about why I chose to him

49
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,479
to be worse apart from the fact that I

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,310
do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends here I've always enjoy</font>

51
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,990
you to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. i haven't had a</font>

52
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,420
bad trip here why did I you can't drive

53
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,460
choose come to a country<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you need</font>

54
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,020
to drive or even on a more ridiculous

55
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,180
level why did I being someone who

56
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,159
believes in the metric system coming to

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,509
a place where I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even understand</font>

58
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,710
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> temperature's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

59
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,729
when they say what it's going to be on

60
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,200
the television environment but didn't

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,630
come to understand how imperial system

62
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,909
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose in many ways I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

63
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,639
see how a country that was existed in

64
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,560
its current state I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying that</font>

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,959
there was a mistake before Christopher

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,730
Columbus but in its current state has

67
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,590
existed for say five hundred years or so

68
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,020
how the country is developed and how the

69
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,790
people with it and have developed as a

70
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,450
way to control<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us but as a way to</font>

71
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,600
control myself in the UK so that

72
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,580
distance again you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

73
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,630
same when you're working next day you

74
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">just need a distance to understand how</font>

75
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,530
you work within a structure this is kind

76
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,330
of in a rambling video the nose of you

77
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">who did choose to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do gap years or who</font>

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,769
have chosen to do year awards apart from

79
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,780
perhaps some more practical aspects of

80
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">save choosing to go to Italy to improve</font>

81
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">your Italian to make it more fluent like</font>

82
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,209
why is it important for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

83
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,970
that society like what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it give to</font>

84
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,860
you I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really interested in that</font>

85
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,600
question if dude think study abroad is

86
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,810
important but I find it hard to put my

87
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,420
finger<font color="#CCCCCC"> on exactly why I think it's</font>

88
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,519
important I do think seeing the world is

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,200
important but only in a certain way

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,700
because if the world that you're going

91
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see is a world of British nightclubs</font>

92
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,799
just in another country surrounded by

93
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,870
British people and around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country</font>

94
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is it you're going to see the</font>

95
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,920
endurance of colonialism<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pakistan</font>

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,310
floods<font color="#E5E5E5"> have affected countless number of</font>

97
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,440
people the last time I read it was 20

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,500
million but I'm very very sure it's even

99
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,850
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at the moment if you</font>

100
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">could donate in any way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

101
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,420
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a wonderful thing to do because</font>

102
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,100
it hasn't received the attention that it

103
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">should have this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> affected more people</font>

104
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,519
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boxing day tsunami not to say</font>

105
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,320
that the Boxing Day seen our mutual

106
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,239
wasn't terrible but the response to that

107
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it came off the Christmas</font>

108
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,829
or it became before the recession or

109
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,380
whatever you know was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

110
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,049
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of low response that has been</font>

111
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,020
to the Pakistan

112
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,600
I chose to donate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the disasters</font>

113
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,550
Emergency Committee which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of an</font>

114
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,590
umbrella<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lots of different charities</font>

115
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,820
and lots of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations that</font>

116
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">can help so that would be my</font>

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,990
recommendation but have a look and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

118
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,480
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to donate wait where you</font>

119
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">want money to go for those of you who</font>

120
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,140
saw my comment on another video saying

121
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,640
oh yeah I've mentioned it my next video

122
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,950
I didn't and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because I</font>

123
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,760
didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would really be</font>

124
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,430
appropriate there so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go your</font>

125
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,220
thoughts and traveling these comments

126
00:04:21,220 --> 00:00:00,000
video responses all of the above
