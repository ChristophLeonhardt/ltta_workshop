NEWLY-MINTED MIKE POMPEO NORTH

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,775
KOREA WITH PEACE AND PROSPERITY

4
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,877
IF THE COUNTRY QUICKLY GIVES UP

5
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:20,012
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

6
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:22,581
>> IF WE ARE GOING TO GET TO

7
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:24,416
THIS HISTORIC OUTCOME BOTH SIDES

8
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,051
HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO TAKE

9
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:26,885
MEASURES TO ACHIEVE IT.

10
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:30,522
IT IS OUR HOPE THAT KIM WANTS TO

11
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:31,423
MAKE STRATEGIC CHANGE IN

12
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:32,825
DIRECTION OF HIS COUNTRY AND HIS

13
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:33,859
PEOPLE AND IF HE'S PREPARED TO

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:35,094
DO THAT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

15
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:36,128
PREPARED TO ASSURE THAT THIS

16
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,297
COULD BE A SUCCESSFUL

17
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:38,897
TRANSITION.

18
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:40,032
CARLEY: WITH LESS THAN A MONTH

19
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:42,568
UNTIL HISTORIC SUMMIT BETWEEN

20
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:43,969
TWO LEADERS, WHAT TYPES OF

21
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,504
NEGOTIATIONS CAN WE EXPECT TO

22
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:45,971
SEE?

23
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:47,172
JOINING US NOW IS NATIONAL

24
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,642
SECURITY ANALYST REBECCA,

25
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:50,709
REBECCA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

26
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,378
BEING WITH US THIS MORNING.

27
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:55,314
NOW, KIM JONG UN IS SOMEBODY WHO

28
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:56,315
HAS ESSENTIALLY BENEFITED FROM

29
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:57,883
THE FACT THAT HIS COUNTRY POOR

30
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,084
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE POOR YOU

31
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:04,188
CAN'T RISE AND OVERTHROW BRUTAL

32
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,458
DICTATOR, DOES HE HAVE SOME SORT

33
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,761
OF ULTERIOR MOTIVE THAT WE MIGHT

34
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,362
KNOW KNOW ABOUT?

35
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,965
>> HE WANTS TO BE TREATED AS THE

36
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:14,733
DELEGATE MATE POWER, HE WANTS TO

37
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,101
RESPECT FROM WORLD LEADERS, HE

38
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,336
WANTS THE RESPECT FROM THE

39
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:19,505
UNITED STATES, HE WANTS PROMISES

40
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:20,806
OF ASSURANCES THAT THE UNITED

41
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:21,940
STATES ISN'T GOING TO THREATEN

42
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,641
FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT NORTH

43
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:23,008
CAROLINA.

44
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,277
HE DOES WANT ECONOMIC GAINS

45
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:26,812
THERE BUT THIS IS NOT A GUY WHO

46
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:29,415
CARES ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF

47
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:31,717
HIS CITIZENRY, IF HE DOES CARE

48
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,719
NOW THIS WILL BE A CHANGE IN HIS

49
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,019
MIND.

50
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:34,787
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

51
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:36,322
THAT THE POINT THAT SECRETARY OF

52
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:37,723
STATE POMPEO MADE THAT THEY WANT

53
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,159
TO SEE AN ACTUAL STRATEGIC

54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,493
CHANGE ON THE PART OF KIM JONG

55
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:43,362
UN, THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT,

56
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:45,664
THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY AND WHAT

57
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,333
POMPEO HAS LAYED OUT AS

58
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,702
NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE

59
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:51,737
UNITED STATES TO GIVE THEM

60
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,439
ECONOMIC GAINS AND ECONOMIC

61
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,040
PROSPERITY AND GET THEM BACK ON

62
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,108
ECONOMIC FOOTING IS EXACTLY

63
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:56,508
RIGHT.

64
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:59,011
THAT'S THE COMPLETE VERIFIABLE

65
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:01,013
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA,

66
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:02,681
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO PULL

67
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:03,148
OFF.

68
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:05,918
ROB: THIS IS COMING UP ON

69
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,119
JUNE 12TH, AT THIS POINT A LOT

70
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,487
OF SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO ON

71
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:10,021
EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE WILLING TO

72
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:11,690
GIVE AND, I THINK, WHAT THEY

73
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,559
WANT AND SHE MAKES A GREAT POINT

74
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:21,266
ABOUT WHY WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO

75
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,368
COMP AN ECONOMY.

76
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:23,936
EVERYBODY IS SKEPTICAL OF THIS,

77
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,437
IT SEEMS HARD TO THINK THAT

78
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,872
IT'LL WORK OUT.

79
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:27,740
>> YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

80
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,575
GOING TO TRY TO DETERMINE IF KIM

81
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:32,111
JONG UN IS BEING SINCERE AND

82
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,080
THEY ARE GOING TO BE SEVERAL

83
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,749
THINGS TO TELL IF HE IS OR NOT.

84
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:39,852
ONE IF HE DOESN'T AGREE TO FULL

85
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:40,753
DENUCLEARIZATION, I MEAN, IT'S

86
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:41,687
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS

87
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:43,055
COMING ON THE HEELS OF PRESIDENT

88
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,890
TRUMP GETTING OUT OF THE IRAN

89
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,657
DEAL.

90
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:47,192
SO HE'S DETERMINED NOT TO MAKE

91
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,527
THE MISTAKES TO HAVE IRAN DEAL

92
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:50,229
WHICH MEANS THE BAR IS HIGH.

93
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:52,364
IT MEANS TOTALLY DISMANTLING THE

94
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:53,465
NORTH KOREAN PROGRAM.

95
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,703
I MEAN, IN THE IRANIAN THEY WERE

96
00:02:57,703 --> 00:02:59,271
ALLOW TODAY KEEP LOW ENRICHMENT

97
00:02:59,271 --> 00:02:59,872
LEVELS THAT.

98
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,707
WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH NORTH

99
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:02,007
KOREA.

100
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:02,775
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS TEAM

101
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:04,777
WANT TO MAKE SURE MISSILES ARE

102
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:05,210
REMOVED.

103
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,311
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA

104
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,212
ADMINISTRATION KEPT WITH IRAN

105
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,047
AND REMEMBER MISSILES GO HAND IN

106
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,115
GLOVE WITH THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM

107
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:11,483
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY

108
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,185
TO DELIVER THE NUCLEAR WAR HEADS

109
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:14,420
AND SO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

110
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,255
IS EXACTLY RIGHT THAT THAT IS

111
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:17,322
PART OF THE PROGRAM AND WE ARE

112
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,293
NOT GOING TO LEAVE THEM AND GIVE

113
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:22,661
THEM ECONOMIC BENEFIT UNTIL THE

114
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,663
WHOLE THING IS DISMANTLED IN

115
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,266
LEAVING THE COUNTRY.

116
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:30,469
CARLEY: CERTAINLY A TRICKY

117
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:33,238
SITUATION TO NAVIGATE.

118
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:37,176
THE U.S. MOVING EMBASSY, HOW

119
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:37,843
SIGNIFICANT IS THAT TO THE

120
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,511
PEOPLE OF ISRAEL?

121
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,613
>> IT'S INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT.

122
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,248
JERUSALEM HAS BEEN THE CAPITAL

123
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:45,451
OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE FOR 3,000

124
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:46,952
YEARS, IT'S BEEN THE CAPITAL OF

125
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:50,489
THE STATE OF ISRAEL SINCE IT'S

126
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,157
INCEPTION 70 YEARS AGO, IT IS A

127
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,358
HISTORICAL FACT AND THE FACT

128
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,060
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

129
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,428
RECOGNIZING THIS FACT MEANS THE

130
00:03:56,428 --> 00:04:00,432
WORLD TO OUR ALLIES, THE

131
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:03,769
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS OF THE

132
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:04,870
NOTION THAT ANYTHING OTHER THAN

133
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,772
THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.

134
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:08,540
IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

135
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,908
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BASE

136
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:11,109
BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

137
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,412
HE PROMISED HE WOULD DO AS HAND

138
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:15,113
DATE AND ONCE AGAIN DELIVERING

139
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:15,681
ON IT.

140
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:18,116
IT'S BEEN AN AMERICAN LAW SINCE

141
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:19,685
1995 TO MOVE EMBASSY TO

142
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:23,055
JERUSALEM AND EVERY PRESIDENT

143
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,223
SINCE 1995 HAS USED WAIVER

144
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,458
AUTHORITY NOT TO DO IT.

145
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,793
PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE'S LISTENING

146
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:29,294
TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND

147
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:31,797
NOT DIFFERING TO THE UN ON IT.

148
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:34,066
ROB: THEY AVOID IT BECAUSE IT

149
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,168
COULD BE MESSY, ALSO END OF

150
00:04:36,168 --> 00:00:00,000
TWO-STATE SOLUTION, A LOT OF
