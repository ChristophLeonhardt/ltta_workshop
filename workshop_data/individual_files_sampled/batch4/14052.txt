John Gardella still from CPAC 2018 joining me now is one of my favorite young rebels my buddy Rob shrim shocked Rob how are you man hi John thank you very much for having me it's been too long now look I don't want to bring us down we had a terrible tragedy last week in parkland Florida about 30 minutes from our I live I live in Broward County Florida so you've been following and every American has mm-hmm you are still of student age now we're being told that students are oh well you you were approximately yes a little bit what you're covering campus issues mm-hmm you're covering you're still covering that beat I'm told by the left run but the left tells me night and day at 99% of people 25 and younger are vehemently anti-gun vehemently at the Second Amendment they want us to hand all of our guns away throw them in a furnace melt them down and Birnam tell me was it wrong I think the most persuasive factor when looking at gun control is seeing just how violence has been perpetrated in the past like before we had all these very lethal weapons and how does nowadays some people still they have access to guns they choose to use other weapons a lot of the time they choose to use things like trucks which are perhaps even more deadly than guns I'm sure in certain situations and so I think whenever a gun control is discussed something that I often see missing from the conversation is the fact that there are other things that can very easily be weaponized if someone has the motive they're gonna do something you know you raise a really interesting point it's actually a great point because in his speech here today at CPAC President Trump but dressed exactly that he talked about the terrorist attack in lower Manhattan in which a terrorist in a vehicle decided to gun the engine and and plow into people on a running back killing a and seriously wounding 12 to 14 your honor presume right no gun was involved there but it was a terror attack as much as any other and it's a really president also spoke about common sense positions and I think what you're promoting is a common sense position I did a segment on my show last week the FBI does the UC or the Uniform Crime reporting every year the most recent is 2016 we know that in fools and long guns like the one used in parkland accounted for about 500 of the weapons used in homicides in the United States but hands fists feet strangling people no weapon accounted for nearly 650 homicides about a hundred more than long us so you make a very interesting point but do you think because you're a journalist because you cover these issues that you're an exception to the rule or do you think more Millennials are becoming more aware of these numbers you know what I've heard in terms of the generations is that Generation Z is actually probably the most woke and there you do have a swing towards the conservative and libertarian values I hate say you know bash my generation but I think Millennials are somewhat hopeless when it comes to things such as the person madman I cover a lot almost exclusively but then also Second Amendment values I think the universities are partially to blame for that in which you have a culture that's just so one-sided and you look at the professor ratio you have like 12 to 1 liberal to conservative professors and I think really what needs to happen is an institutional change we need to start motivating conservatives libertarians people who are saying somewhat to enter these institutions and really make a difference now I've got a really important question for you and no matter how I answer you will not hurt my feelings mm-hmm and my base didn't woke yes I think so yes I hope I am very red pills your opinion means a lot I'm gonna tell yes conservative is red ok I can leave seat back a happy guy rob chip shot told me on Facebook and red bell rob is always my friend of pleasure you gotta come back on my show so thank you very much sorry story is interesting is the racist sexual predator pelicans that's gonna be a hard one to match but I'm up to the challenge thanks man always great to see you thanks so much you
