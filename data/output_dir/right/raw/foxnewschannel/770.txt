â™ª

2
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:13,443
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT

3
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:14,911
IT IS THAT IT IS SUCH A

4
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,979
REMARKABLE, HISTORICAL

5
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,881
REVERSAL BECAUSE WE IN THE

6
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:20,117
LAST 30 YEARS HAVE BECOME

7
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:21,284
ACCUSTOMED TO BEING ON THE

8
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:22,652
SIDE OF SUPPORTING A

9
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:24,321
GOVERNMENT AGAINST AN

10
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:25,255
INSURGENCY IN VIETNAM AND IN

11
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:26,590
OTHER PLACES.

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,126
IT'S OUR BELIEF IN WARS OF

13
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,460
NATIONAL LIBERATION AND THEY

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,561
HAPPEN TO BE WARS OF

15
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:33,730
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE FIGHTING

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,264
COMMUNIST REGIMES.

17
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,266
IT'S NOT JUST A RANDOM

18
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:38,535
SERIES OF POLICIES

19
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:39,870
SUPPORTING INSURGENCY HERE

20
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,804
AND INSURGENCY THERE.

21
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:43,373
I THINK IT AMOUNTS TO A VERY

22
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:44,608
SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN OUR

23
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:48,044
HISTORY OF CONTAINMENT.

24
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:48,578
>> Bret: DR. CHARLES

25
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:50,614
KRAUTHAMMER IN 1986 TALKING

26
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:52,716
ABOUT THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, A

27
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:53,884
TERM HE COINED.

28
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:54,818
WE'RE BACK WITH OUR PANEL

29
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:59,589
FOR SOME REFLECTIONS,

30
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:00,624
STORIES, PANEL TIME.

31
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:03,193
FRED, MORT, MARA, YOU SPENT

32
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:06,396
A LOT OF TIME WITH CHARLES

33
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:09,232
ON THE PANEL:  BYRON YOU

34
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:09,800
HAVE AS WELL.

35
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,168
>> HE WAS A WONDERFUL GUY.

36
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,936
IT WAS GREAT TO WATCH HIM

37
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:15,205
BECOME A REAL CONSERVATIVE.

38
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:18,608
YOU KNOW, STARTING OUT WITH

39
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:21,678
THE WHOLE REAGAN DOCTRINE,

40
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:23,079
WHICH I'M SURE -- WELL, WE

41
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,381
KNOW THAT REAGAN WAS GLAD TO

42
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:26,349
HEAR ABOUT IT THAT HE HAD

43
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,851
REALLY CARVED OUT THIS

44
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:28,218
DOCTRINE.

45
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:29,586
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK

46
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:31,354
ABOUT REAGAN AND CHARLES

47
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:33,590
TOGETHER, YOU THINK ABOUT

48
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,759
THE MOST CONSERVATIVE

49
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,427
POLITICAL LEADER IN AMERICA,

50
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:38,028
THAT'S REAGAN.

51
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:42,532
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT AND

52
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:44,835
INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL

53
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:45,535
INTELLECTUAL AS WELL.

54
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,704
BOTH OF THEM, FORMER

55
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,506
DEMOCRATS, FORMER LIBERALS

56
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:51,975
BECOMING CONSERVATIVES AND

57
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:53,677
THEY -- IT WAS A POWERFUL

58
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:54,010
FORCE.

59
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,145
BOTH OF THEM.

60
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,446
NOT JUST REAGAN.

61
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,614
BUT CHARLES AS WELL.

62
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,382
AND THEY WERE THE FORCE IN

63
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:00,584
AMERICAN POLITICS FOR 25

64
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:04,654
YEARS.

65
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:05,889
>> Bret: YOU KNOW, MORT, YOU

66
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:07,691
WORKED WITH HIM NOT ONLY AS

67
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:09,158
A PANELIST HERE BUT BEFORE

68
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:11,428
THAT AT THE NEW REPUBLIC.

69
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:11,962
GEORGE WILL WROTE.

70
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:13,330
THIS HE SAID SOME PEOPLE ARE

71
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,367
SUCH A LARGE PRESENCE WHILE

72
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:19,035
LIVING THAT THEY STILL

73
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:20,070
OCCUPY SPACE EVEN WHEN

74
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,004
THEY'RE GONE.

75
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:21,304
MORT?

76
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:23,974
>> WE WERE FRIENDS FOR 40

77
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:24,407
YEARS.

78
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:26,142
AND BESIDES, YOU KNOW,

79
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:28,945
LOSING A DEAR FRIEND OF US

80
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:30,447
ALL, WE HAVE REALLY LOST A

81
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:31,081
NATIONAL TREASURE.

82
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,083
I MEAN, HE WAS THE MOST

83
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,951
BRILLIANT COMMENTATOR OF OUR

84
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:35,252
TIME.

85
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:37,821
I THINK HE IS UP THERE WITH

86
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,990
WALTER LITTMAN AND DOROTHY

87
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,358
THOMPSON AND BILL BUCKLEY

88
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:43,026
AND MAYBE EVEN GEORGE

89
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:43,460
ORWELL.

90
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,562
HE USED TO JOKE THAT HIS

91
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:46,863
TRAINING AS A PSYCHIATRIST

92
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:48,265
WAS GOOD PREPARATION FOR

93
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:49,866
COVERING AMERICAN POLITICS,

94
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,535
WHICH IS GETTING CRAZIER AND

95
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:52,903
MORE TOXIC BY THE DAY.

96
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:54,804
HE IS THE ONE WHO COINSD

97
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:57,040
BUSH DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

98
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,875
YOU KNOW, THE TENDENCY OF

99
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,577
LIBERALS TO NOT GIVE GEORGE

100
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:02,245
W. BUSH CREDIT FOR ANYTHING.

101
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,214
AND I THINK HE GOT DONALD

102
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:05,181
TRUMP JUST RIGHT.

103
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:10,186
YOU KNOW, GOVERNED BY ID.

104
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:10,587
RECKLESS.

105
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:14,524
WORSE THAN NARCISSIST.

106
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:16,026
IN ONE OF HIS LAST COLUMNS,

107
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:18,995
I THINK HE

108
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:19,763
OVEROPTIMISTICALLY SAID THAT

109
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:21,932
THE GUARDRAILS OF AMERICAN

110
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:23,166
DEMOCRACY ARE HOLDING

111
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,569
BECAUSE THE BOYCOTTS AND

112
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,571
POLICE CHIEFS REPUDIATED

113
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:29,839
WHAT TRUMP SAID AND THE

114
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,041
SENATE WOULDN'T CANCEL

115
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,375
OBAMACARE AND WOULDN'T LET

116
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,643
HIM FIRE JEFF SESSIONS.

117
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:35,612
I THINK IT WAS OVERLY

118
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:36,012
OPTIMISTIC.

119
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:41,084
IN FACT, BECAUSE CHARLES WAS

120
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:43,219
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL

121
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,255
CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST, THE

122
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:46,156
ONE CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST

123
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,924
THAT ALL CONSERVATIVES

124
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:49,593
LISTENED TO, I THINK HE WAS

125
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:51,428
ONE OF THE GUARDRAILS OF

126
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:52,629
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND NOW

127
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:53,296
HE IS GONE.

128
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:56,366
I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE

129
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:56,766
WEEPING.

130
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,068
>> Bret: YOU KNOW, MORT, AND

131
00:03:58,068 --> 00:03:59,970
MARA, TO YOU, HE, CHARLES,

132
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,371
OBVIOUSLY WAS VERY CRITICAL

133
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:03,773
OF CANDIDATE TRUMP.

134
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:05,275
BUT AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP

135
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:08,378
WON THE ELECTION, CHARLES

136
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,412
REFLECTED A LOT ABOUT WHAT

137
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,714
HE SAID EARLY ON.

138
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:14,551
AND HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE

139
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:17,087
WAS SEEING AND HOW IT HAD

140
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:17,420
EVOLVED.

141
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,755
HERE IS AN INTERACTION HE

142
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:20,223
HAD WITH TUCKER AFTER A

143
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:21,625
RALLY IN WEST VIRGINIA BY

144
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,325
TRUMP.

145
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,927
>> IS

146
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:23,960
>> TS

147
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,462
>> THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE.

148
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:27,297
FORGET ABOUT THE NUMBERS.

149
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:28,798
FORGET ABOUT THE CHATTER IN

150
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:29,199
WASHINGTON.

151
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,933
FORGET ABOUT THE STORIES

152
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,167
ABOUT RUSSIA WHICH HE SPENT

153
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,837
A LOT OF TIME ON.

154
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:36,706
BUT I REPRESENT A HUGE

155
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:37,641
CONSTITUENCY OF TREMENDOUS

156
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:39,275
SUPPORT AND ENTHUSIASM.

157
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:40,677
HE WASN'T VERY SPECIFIC ON

158
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:41,878
POLICY BUT HE SAID I'M

159
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:43,380
BRINGING YOU GUYS BACK.

160
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,981
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO

161
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:45,415
LISTENED.

162
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,750
YOU WERE ABANDONED.

163
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,684
THAT'S HIS APPEAL.

164
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:48,752
THAT'S HOW HE WON THE

165
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:50,220
ELECTION AND HE IS REMINDING

166
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,656
THE ELITES THAT THAT APPEAL

167
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:56,893
IS STILL THERE.

168
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:57,327
>> Bret: MARA?

169
00:04:57,327 --> 00:05:01,331
>> LOOK, CHARLES WAS A

170
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:01,965
CONSERVATIVE INTELLECTUAL.

171
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:02,799
AND HE LOOKED AT THINGS THE

172
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,433
WAY THEY WERE.

173
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,535
HE WASN'T A KNEE JERK

174
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:05,902
ANYTHING.

175
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:08,471
AND THERE WAS NOTHING

176
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:09,606
POST-TRUTH ABOUT CHARLES.

177
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:10,640
IF TRUMP DID SOMETHING

178
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,008
RIGHT, HE PRAISED HIM FOR IT

179
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:14,444
HE WASN'T A REFLEXIVE, NEVER

180
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:14,778
TRUMPER.

181
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:16,246
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S

182
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:17,414
SO GREAT THAT YOU'RE GOING

183
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:18,581
TO KEEP ON PLAYING THESE

184
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,983
CLIPS OF HIM, EVEN FROM

185
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,151
BEYOND THE GRAVE, BECAUSE HE

186
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:22,752
HAD SO MUCH TO SAY THAT IS

187
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,821
STILL GOING TO BE RELEVANT.

188
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,090
I THINK HIS PASSING IS SUCH

189
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,391
A LOSS FOR CONSERVATISM.

190
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,959
SUCH A LOSS FOR PUBLIC

191
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,227
DISCOURSE WHICH AS MORT JUST

192
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:32,696
SAID IS GETTING MORE TOXIC

193
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:34,097
AND TRIBAL AND UGLY BY THE

194
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:34,431
DAY.

195
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,765
CHARLES IS THE ANTIDOTE TO

196
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:36,533
ALL OF THAT.

197
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,469
I AM SO HONORED THAT I GOT

198
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:40,904
TO SIT NEXT TO HIM FOR ALL

199
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,138
THESE YEARS BECAUSE MY SEAT

200
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:44,040
WAS USUALLY RIGHT NEXT TO

201
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,374
CHARLES.

202
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:47,577
HE ALSO HAD AN INCREDIBLY

203
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:48,378
SWEET, SUNNY DISPOSITION.

204
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:50,113
I DON'T THINK I EVER SAW

205
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:52,515
CHARLES DARK OR ANGRY AT

206
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:52,882
ANYTHING.

207
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:53,917
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY HE

208
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,719
WAS ABLE TO PERSEVERE

209
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:57,220
THROUGH ALL OF THE

210
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,987
INCREDIBLE OBSTACLES THAT

211
00:05:57,987 --> 00:05:59,055
LIFE HANDED OUT TO HIM.

212
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:00,557
WHICH HE DID NOT DWELL ON

213
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:03,593
FOR A SECOND.

214
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:05,095
>> I SPENT A LOT OF TIME

215
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:06,129

INTERVIEWS.

218
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,200
AND WANTED TO TALK TO HIM.

219
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,670
HE WAS RETICENT TO DO IT AT

220
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:14,170
GUESS.

221
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,605
HERE IT IS I'M ASKING HIM

I WANT TO PLAY THE SOUND

AT YOUR HOUSE.

00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:26,783
DO YOU STILL PLAY?

230
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:29,786
>> NO, I GAVE IT UP.

231
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:31,988
IT'S AN ADDICTION.

232
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:32,522
>> Bret: COMPLETELY.

233
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:33,289
>> IT'S A POISON.

234

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,525

YEAH, I HAVE BINGES.

251
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:57,914
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THIS HAS

252
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:59,182
HAPPENED TO ME EVER SINCE I

253
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:00,683
WAS ABOUT 20.

254
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,318
[LAUGHTER]

255
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,353
>> Bret: HE COULD CRACK ME

256
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:03,753
UP, BYRON.

257
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:05,021
IT WAS AMAZING.

258
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,089
>> TALK ABOUT A MIND THAT

259
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,590
WAS WORKING ALL THE TIME.

260
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,758
ONE THING DID I ON ALL OF

261
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:09,826
THESE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

262
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:10,960
SAID ABOUT CHARLES.

263
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,362
I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT

264
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:13,530
THE TRANSCRIPTS OF SOME OF

265
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,597
THE "SPECIAL REPORT" PANELS

266
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:14,898
HERE.

267
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,900

SPEAKING IN PERFECTLY FORMED

269
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:19,335
PARAGRAPH.

270
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,204
ONE PERFECT SENTENCE AFTER

00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:23,206
ANOTHER WHILE THE REST OF US

COULD BE PUBLISHED AS IS

275
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:30,680
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS HE

276
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,817
WAS SO EFFECTIVE AS A

277
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:35,051
