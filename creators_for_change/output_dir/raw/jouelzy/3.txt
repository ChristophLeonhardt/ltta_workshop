1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:01,410
- Hey, guys, it's Jouelzy.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,922
You can't really see my sweatshirt, but,

3
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,042
ooh, can you see it?

4
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:08,121
I now have this and Black is a Culture.

5
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:10,092
In not only sweatshirts, but this is a

6
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:12,058
cropped sweatshirt, and I love it.

7
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:15,020
So let's get into this actual discussion,

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,111
and remember you can always support

9
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:20,373
by shopping Smart Brown
Girl, and if you're new here,

10
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:23,219
definitely subscribe if
you enjoy the conversation,

11
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,340
even if you don't agree.

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,902
It's all about a critical dialogue,

13
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:29,931
so please do comment along
and engage, respectfully.

14
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:32,841
The other day on Twitter,
things took off, okay,

15
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,682
as people discussed, and uncovered,

16
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:37,938
popular influencers on the
'Gram, who were supposedly

17
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,688
changing their features
to appear more black,

18
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,634
I guess it is.

19
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:47,194
Now someone decides to coin
this as "N*ggerfishing",

20
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:49,504
and I don't know why, with
the vastness of the English

21
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:52,474
language, they decided
to go with the hard R,

22
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:55,964
to coin this frame, but
there has to be, girl,

23
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:57,446
there has to be a better
way to describe it.

24
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,593
Ooh, I'm just remiss to even call it that.

25
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,415
At the center of these
allegations is one particular

26
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,236
influencer, Emma Hallberg.

27
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:07,764
She is Swedish and
feeding into an aesthetic

28
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:12,232
that focuses on her wide
hips, and what appears to be

29
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:16,036
a braid out in her hair,
like some loose texture

30
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,154
in her hair, I guess.

31
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:19,540
And some actually see this woman as trying

32
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,933
to portray herself as black.

33
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,372
Now, most of the girls folks
were outing had slightly

34
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:25,854
tan skin, clearly Botoxed
lips, and some sort

35
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:28,194
of flimsy texture to their
hair, and in the world

36
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:32,911
that I live in, that does an
identifiable black woman make.

37
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,102
Like, sis, what, huh?

38
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:36,785
For me, the gag really
is, that they're feeding

39
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:40,452
into a racially ambiguous
image that plenty,

40
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:43,459
not to, I mean, I don't
want to pull that card,

41
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:45,759
but I mean I do think
plenty of black women feed

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,801
into, and have found a
way to profit from, it.

43
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:54,111
Now, Kylie Jenner's
plastic surgeon is so good

44
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:56,439
that the comments whenever
she's posted on a page

45
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,532
like The Shade Room have
plenty of black women

46
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,961
saying it doesn't matter
if she paid for it 'cause

47
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:05,611
she look good, she look good-good.

48
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:08,157
And particularly, a lot
of these black women

49
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:10,709
are influencers, with large followings,

50
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,670
who are promoting this message of,

51
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,571
like Kylie's current aesthetic,

52
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:17,671
looking good and therefore desirable.

53
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,460
And look, on the flip
we are here on YouTube,

54
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,937
where there are plenty of black women,

55
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:22,120
who I mean, I guess you could say,

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,179
they're enhancing or
slimming their features,

57
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,493
and as black women, I've
seen plenty of celebration

58
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:29,533
around BBLs and lib fillers

59
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,202
and the girls who relax their edges,

60
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:35,834
and there are very specific
looks that become popular.

61
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,412
Y'all can not convince me that,

62
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:40,853
actually let me not be
messy and say any names,

63
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:43,217
but it's an epidemic out here with

64
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:44,975
the light skin and wavy girl.

65
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:47,074
Who's very popular on this here platform,

66
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:48,386
especially if she is blogging

67
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:50,876
or vlogging with her
dark skinned boyfriend.

68
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:53,825
Trust you me, I am not camping

69
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:56,446
or defending Emma or any
of these white women,

70
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:59,383
cause this isn't an image
that I ever feed into.

71
00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:01,824
I ain't fixin to touch those
snakey Taylor Swift ways with

72
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:04,285
a 10 foot pole, sis, I'm
never gonna be here for it.

73
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,555
But to begin with, I don't
even follow the I have

74
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:09,263
a black grandmother girls
that look like her, either.

75
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:10,564
And you know what I'm talking about.

76
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:13,054
Not that I want to antagonize
or attack other people,

77
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:15,592
and question their racial identity,

78
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,364
but a lot of this is the same thing

79
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,254
that puts silky hair textures at the top

80
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:20,534
of the natural hair community.

81
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,365
It's the same thing
that has us arguing over

82
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:26,322
who's black so we claim
outliers as empowering,

83
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:28,695
while turning a blind eye to black women

84
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:31,644
who don't walk this world
with light skin privilege.

85
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,344
I don't have anything
for these white women,

86
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:36,034
because if it's that easy for
them to plump up their lips,

87
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:40,896
and braid their hair at night,
for you to see them as black?

88
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:44,452
Well, sis, you were already
fetishing European features.

89
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:45,285
Sorry to tell you.

90
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:46,875
There's plenty of black women,

91
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,496
that have gotten rid of
their Negro nose nostrils.

92
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,715
There's a popular IG
influencer who definitely

93
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,597
is an African women, but over the years,

94
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:57,905
she's erased almost
all her ethnic features

95
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,416
to look like an alien of racial ambiguity.

96
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,706
She's constantly popping
up on my Explorer page

97
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:06,683
because so many people
that I know follow her

98
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:08,895
and support the image
that she is promoting.

99
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,195
I mean, there's a lot more nuances,

100
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:11,306
this a lot deeper discussion that

101
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:12,757
we can delve off from here,

102
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:14,806
because it is not one in
the same for a black woman

103
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:18,216
to rid herself of her features
as it is for a white woman

104
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,472
to benefit by adding on to her features,

105
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:24,175
or alluding that her features are this?

106
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:25,518
White supremacy always going to have us

107
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:26,622
in some sort of cluster fuck,

108
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:28,907
but the white woman gets to commodify

109
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:30,495
while the black woman hates herself,

110
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:31,985
and it's just not the same,

111
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,376
but it is all a function of the spectrum

112
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,556
of European standards of beauty.

113
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:39,235
None of this, none of this of what I see,

114
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,055
when y'all out with
these girls represents me

115
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:42,555
as a black woman.

116
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,206
None of these images, none of these girls,

117
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:45,628
none of the way these women represent,

118
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:47,607
tells me to love and find beauty in

119
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:50,838
the plethora of ways
that black women present.

120
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:54,048
It feeds into a very narrow
scope of desirability

121
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:57,038
that puts European features at the top.

122
00:04:57,038 --> 00:04:58,289
And to keep it real with you,

123
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,872
that is a disservice to us all.

124
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:05,165
I spend less time gagging
over these white girls

125
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:07,719
and spend more time focusing
on the real black girls, okay?

126
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,997
Cause you know, we still have a problem.

127
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:11,800
We still have a problem with accepting

128
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,878
and finding beauty in a specific corner

129
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,808
of the black women community.

130
00:05:15,808 --> 00:00:00,000
So you know, work on that, sis.
