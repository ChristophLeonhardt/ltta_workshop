00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,340
for Jake today and we begin this hour
with breaking news in our politics lead

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,269
president Trump is watch his approval
ratings tick downward since he took

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,580
office until now a new CNN poll
releasing right now shows that number is

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,769
edging back up with 40% of Americans now
saying they approve of the job that the

6
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,939
president is doing now by any normal
historical measurement that is not a

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,180
good number but it is better and largely
because a healthy majority 64% of voters

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,540
approve of how the president responded
to the hurricanes that slammed into the

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,800
southern US coastline this month
meanwhile here in New York at the United

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,340
Nations today the president confronting
another challenge North Korea's nuclear

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,780
program after threatening to destroy the
country today the president tacked back

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,640
towards diplomacy promising to level
increased sanctions CNN senior White

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,600
House correspondent Jeff Zeleny joins me
now live right here in New York and Jeff

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,129
are polling all shows that the country
anxious about the threat from North

15
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,049
Korea
it does indeed John half of all

16
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,430
Americans now say they believe there is
an immediate threat for North Korea that

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,939
has a significant increase from only a
few months ago but as the president

18
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,290
signed that executive order earlier
today it is one sign diplomacy is still

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:24,900
an option despite what many saw as
sabre-rattling earlier this week Trump

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,070
is backing up his brinksmanship toward
North Korea with new economic sanctions

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,630
trying to cripple the regime's nuclear
program a new executive order will cut

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,090
off sources of revenue that fund North
Korea's efforts to develop the deadliest

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,430
weapons known to humankind
two days after threatening to wipe the

24
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,729
isolated nation off the map we will have
no choice but to totally destroy North

25
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,189
Korea the u.s. presented a unified front
with South Korea and Japan by announcing

26
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,270
new sanctions to financially squeeze and
further isolate North Korea from the

27
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,770
outside world foreign banks will face a
clear choice to business with the United

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,730
States or facilitate trade with the
lawless regime in North Korea Chinese

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,330
President Xi Jinping also
reportedly ordering Chinese banks to

30
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,010
stop conducting business with North
Korea a move mr. Trump hailed today I

31
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:29,010
want to just say and thank President Xi
of China for the very bold move he made

32
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,250
today that was a somewhat unexpected
move and we appreciate it while it's

33
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,849
unlikely a new round of sanctions will
persuade Kim jong-un to rethink his

34
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:43,560
nuclear ambitions the moves are a sign
the US and its allies are searching for

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,950
diplomatic and economic solutions not
only military ones a new CNN poll today

36
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,090
shows that half of Americans now say
North Korea poses an immediate threat up

37
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,819
from 37 percent in April that comes
after months of missile launches on the

38
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,209
Korean Peninsula and sabre-rattling here
in the US

39
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:10,109
Rocketman is on a suicide mission for
himself and for his regime the poll also

40
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,730
found that nearly 6 in 10 favor military
action if diplomacy or economic

41
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,440
sanctions don't work overall 41 percent
approve of how mr. Trump is handling

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,389
North Korea while 50 percent do not
essentially unchanged from last month

43
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,709
mr. Trump was all smiles today during a
meeting with the South Korea president

44
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:37,169
who called the North Korea nuclear
program deplorable that word which

45
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,040
Hillary Clinton once used to describe
his supporters became a soundtrack of

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:51,090
his campaign welcome to all of you
deplorable today mr. Trump was happy to

47
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,019
relive those moments

48
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,239
now President Trump has now wrapped up a
week-long series of meetings with world

49
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,879
leaders here at the UN he of course is
taking some pleasure at that 40 percent

50
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,030
approval rating considering what it was
but John there is one other Trump that

51
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,230
has a higher approval rating that's
Melania Trump our poll shows she has a

52
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,380
44% approval we should note again 40%
not good by historical standards but

53
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,650
from standards not that better and he'll
take that Jeff's L&E always great to see

54
00:04:24,650 --> 00:00:00,000
you in person today it's an
extra-special treat more
