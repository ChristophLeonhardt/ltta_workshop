my next guest is Kurama Brown one of the Fab Five hosts on Netflix is queer I I want to mention that you of course have tackled many subjects including police brutality you had this emotional dialogue with an officer who said he was a major Trump supporter all I ever hear usually is cops thinking together saying but what about us and it is true what about you all but it's sort of like what about us we're both dealing with the same pain on two different ends yeah but none of us are like acknowledging riding back from Atlanta with you was probably one of the best parts of all of this I know I really embrace it hey I want to I want to hug like that too you're getting one next time I see you kid I was there you're you're doing something that you're a leader people look to you people feel inspired by you and you're doing something that we hear everybody wants more of which is you don't agree with the guy on camera they're necessarily about everything but you're listening and you're trying to connect walk us through why that's important right now well you know my background is in social worker psychotherapy and for me it's about making sure that we can find a way to build those bridges you know as a country we're so divided right now everyone is defining people by just one vote because we're at such high tension and the time that we try to figure out how many things we have in common instead of how many things we don't have in common so that we could have those hard conversations with other people so we can get to a place where we can work together what does it mean to deal with some of the ideas as well as the cliches that people have about what it means to be gay we're talking about queer I and yet playing past them I mean because you're in the culture in that way you're obviously playing with the idea of connection of makeovers of all that stuff but also not being you know not being narrowed by it yeah well first of all we all every single person not just me as a gay man but we all have different identities that are intersectionalities of our personalities I'm a black man I'm a gay man I'm also a single father and I think it's important to not check those identities at the door so when we're right working with these heroes it's not about me as a gay man it's about me as a human being it's about me as a father it's about me as a black man in that conversation I have a quarry the police officer it's about me as someone who's saying I need you to understand my struggles as a person in this country and help you so that you can support me and be an ally for what I'm trying to do I love you saying that I mean I feel very intersectional myself because I'm a lawyer but I'm also a nerd you know and so those it's two things at once you know I'm not gonna call you a nerd because I follow your tweets and I watch the show you come out with some of the coolest hip-hop and things you're not a nerd buy any milk a very nice year to say I was not fishing I swear I'm not fishing for giving a compliment I love giving compliments I want to clear I makeover like anybody else remember the original show let me play another another great moment that you did on this show for people who don't know some of the different directions you guys go and let's take a look sure I was terrified to go in there alone again so I really think you chromo for going with me I appreciate that I needed that support I don't know wants to be with you don't man Germany people are going to know that they can live and thrive and succeed because of you this was about transgender identity tell us a little bit about that moment sure so Skylar was our first transgender hero as which think we call the people we make better and he had been struggling with getting his gender marker changed on his driver's license a conversation that never comes up especially when talking about the trans community so for me to come into this space I want to make sure that was going to do something that was gonna be impactful for him but also was going to shift the conversation in a way that people in everywhere in middle America can understand the trans experience and when you think about a driver's license it's something that we've all gotten and we're excited to get at 15 but for many people in the trans community that gender marker causes them not to be able get on flights not to feel safe when they get to stop by the police not to go into clubs and that is something where someone has the right to deny them just based on their views and so for me to support scholar and getting that his life has dramatically changed because now he can walk through this world and feel validated when he approaches places and things that we take for granted every day it's it's great it's well put and I'm gonna hold you to the IOU on the hug anytime ok hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
