the NRA spends a considerable amount of its resources in influencing our lawmakers in order to prevent them from passing or even proposing gun legislation anything that would limit the sales of gun manufacturers here in the United States is what the NRA is against and so just how much money do our lawmakers receive from the NRA well we have some specific examples and we'll start with the Senate now these are the top ten recipients of NRA lobbying money and the numbers are insane right so let's start with John McCain from Arizona of course the senator he has received seven million seven hundred forty thousand dollars from the NRA which is incredible then you have Richard Burr he is the second largest recipient from the NRA in the Senate almost 7 million dollars as well then you have Roy Blunt at four point five million dollars Tom Tillis at four point four million dollars the list goes on and on senator Cory Gardner at three point three point eight million dollars almost three point nine and you know just look at that list and consider the fact that John McCain who is the top recipient just recently went on and on about how we need to get money out of politics maybe because he knows from firsthand experience that that money is real sweet when you're a lawmaker and it will prevent you from proposing or voting in favor of common-sense regulation that would ban something like the you know bumps talk that the shooter used in this Las Vegas mass shooting by the way a number of these lawmakers have said they didn't even know that the bump stock exists I don't know I don't know bump stock existed right Dianne Feinstein proposed legislation in January of 2013 asking for a ban of bump stocks there were other measures on in that legislation that would limit you know the sale of some guns and it would also include background checks things like that and it didn't even come up for a vote okay so I don't know maybe they never read the legislation anyway so maybe they're right maybe they didn't actually read and and know about bump stocks but it's just hard for me to believe that if it was important enough it would have been in the lecture and they wouldn't have had to do all the reading you know if they just came to class listen to the arguments it would have been in that I like there's a the New York Times has this breakdown and they go with the number that people are donated mm-hmm and or receive from the NRA and then their tweet responds and what's interesting is there is a correlation if you are getting over about a million dollars you you'll be tweeting about thoughts and prayers you get the thought and prayer package under a million dollars you get thoughts or prayers you might get that's crazy you might just get thoughts you know you know I kick it up a little bit we'll get to the prayer level well you know someone's thoughts will definitely make these victims feel better they're all thoughts that hole over there bang nailed it here's the other thing is the money's going no matter what that's what that's the john mccain thing i don't want to wrap my mind around what his him as a person i can't i can't really reconcile all that's happening into one person but I will say the money is gonna go to somewhere and that's that's how they talked themselves into it if there is at all any moral qualms about it no they talked themselves into it the same way that Hillary Clinton talked herself into it during this past election and this is not an issue that solely impacts Republicans this is an issue that impacts every single member of Congress and honestly I have only found I wouldn't even say a handful like two senators that are not influenced by corporate money and are principled in their beliefs which I respect Bernie Sanders being one of them of course right but look Hillary Clinton and her supporters made the argument over and over again that this I mean you gotta do this to win you gotta do this to win you have no other choice this is just how the system is no but if you see that this system is corrupt and it's problematic you're one of the most powerful people like you you could be a leader in this issue and change it but they like this system they don't want to stir the pot right so easy it goes back to the story we're talking about where it's like the market already has bump stocks it's gonna be too much of a pain in the ass to get rid of them why would I change it but it is that it is that fear that like you everybody's replaceable not to you know turn the gun debate into an episode of Dance Moms but that's what Abby Lee Miller says is that everyone's replaceable so the NRA is going to fund someone if you turn against them it's it is interesting though because I think Americans most Americans feel this need to do something that makes them feel like they have a purpose that fulfills them and so what is how is it fulfilling in any way to be a lawmaker if you don't get to carry out you know your vision of a better country where you know someone else that the wealthiest people in the country have complete power over you and the decisions you make I don't want that well they're just definition of a good country is different from yours that's there they have it they nailed it they're doing it you know so you're you're putting onto them your ideal of America and let's say I am more inclined to agree with you on that but if you're saying like I'm not even by the way to be clear I'm not even talking about my specific progressive ideals I'm just talking about just let's be specific so this whole gun debate right I mean over like the Newtown massacre after that happened all those little kids were murdered right that they just couldn't do it they just couldn't do it and it's because the lobby is so incredibly powerful that's what I'm talking about what the NRA does and you'll notice it after every single one of these as they shelter in place because they know how it works because they've done their lead work to get the Republican politicians and the members of Lake Fox News to go ahead and say anyone who says now's the time to talk about changing things is politicizing this and so the NRA just gets to back off and be like all right whatever because without them having to do any additional work already and our Bishop goes up because already people are afraid because they know that in the wake of all of this people on the on the Democratic side are gonna say you know what what the Democrats say we please do something about this like it's the it's the via what what I mean we're not gonna cover it on today's show but but what Hannity sat down with Tommy Lehren and said is that why are they politicizing this the bodies aren't even cold why do they politicize you know what it's not polite it's not you're right that's what it is it's not politicizing anything how is it political to say how do we make sure that this doesn't happen again versus let's not change let's do the same thing over and over again right and what's so frustrating about the Hannity thing is that he says I'm all for common-sense gun legislation and that's it that's all what that's all any of us are for you know that's all most of the people are for and it's frustrating hear folks say that this is now in a discussion over getting rid of all guns in America period because it never is never was it's not fair to the conversation and that's politicizing it
