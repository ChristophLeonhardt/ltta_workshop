TALL OVER THE LAST 8 MONTHS

27
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:37,920
WHEN SMALL PEOPLE WERE

28
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,871
TRYING TO TEAR DOWN AN

29
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:39,823
INSTITUTION WE ALL DEPEND

30
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:40,122
ON.

31
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:41,623
HE SERVED WITH DISTINCTION

32
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:43,432
FOR TWO DECADES I WISH ANDY

33
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:43,811
WELL.

34
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,027
I WISH CONTINUED STRENGTH

35
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:46,128
FOR THE REST OF THE FBI.

36
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:46,733
AMERICA NEEDS YOU.

37
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:47,336
YOU KNOW THE INSPECTOR

38
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:48,735
GENERAL FOUND THAT MCCABE

39
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:49,736
LIED FOUR TIMES, THREE OF

40
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,333
THEM UNDER OATH.

ADD LOT OF POSSIBLE

44
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,191
QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT HERE'S

45
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:55,571
ONE.

46
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,839
PLEASE DISCUSS ANDREW MCCABE

47
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,340
AND THE IG REPORT THAT FINDS

48
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,842
HE LIED REPEATEDLY, BOTH TO

49
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:00,697
YOU AND ABOUT YOU.

50
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:01,944
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE HE

51
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:03,199
STOOD TALL AS YOU TWEETED IN

52
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,546
JANUARY OR IS HE ONE OF THE

53
00:01:04,546 --> 00:01:05,707
SMALL PEOPLE HELPING TO TEAR

54
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:06,849
DOWN AN INSTITUTION?

55
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:07,249
>> YEAH.

56
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,504
I STILL BELIEVE HE STOOD

57
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:08,806
TALL.

58
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:10,660
HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF AND

59
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,660
THE ORGANIZATION UNDER

60
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,855
TREMENDOUS STRESS DURING

61
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:13,881
THAT PERIOD AFTER I WAS

62
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:14,163
FIRED.

63
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:15,657
BUT I READ THE IG REPORT AS

64
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:16,258
YOU DID.

65
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:17,816
IT CONCLUDED THAT ANDY HAD

66
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,066
NOT BEEN CANDID.

67
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,763
THIS IS WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY

68
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:22,464
LOOKS LIKE IN THE JUSTICE

69
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:22,919
DEPARTMENT.

70
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:23,620
>> Bret: SHOULD HE BE

71
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,022
PROSECUTED?

72
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:25,667
>> THAT'S NOT FOR ME.

73
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,368
>> Bret: YOU SAID IT IN THE

74
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:26,773
CLINTON CASE.

75
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:27,874
>> I WAS THEN THE DIRECTOR

76
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:28,470
OF THE FBI.

77
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,227
I'M A PRIVATE CITIZEN.

78
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:31,028
PRIVATE CITIZENS SHOULD NOT

79
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:31,874
BE CALLING FOR THE

80
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:32,832
PROSECUTION OF PEOPLE IN A

81
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:33,683
CASE THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED

IN.

83
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:36,485
BUT, I DO BELIEVE, AS IT

84
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:37,907
ROUTINELY HAPPENS, THE IG

85
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:38,981
WILL LIKELY REFER OR HAS

86
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,082
REFERRED IT TO A U.S.

87
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:40,883
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO LOOK AT

88
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,690
IT.

89
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,542
>> Bret: SO, DID YOU -- YOU

90
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,144
SEE THE DISPARITY HERE WHERE

91
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:47,489
PEOPLE LOOK AT HOW THE

92
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:48,696
CLINTON CASE WAS HANDLED AND

93
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:50,592
HOW THE TRUMP CASE IS

94
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,198
HANDLED.

95
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:51,950
DID YOU TELL --

96
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,853
>> -- I DON'T SEE DISPARITY

97
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:54,252
THOUGH.

98
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:54,826
>> Bret: DID YOU TELL

99
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:55,581
LAWMAKERS THAT FBI AGENTS

100
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,799
DIDN'T BELIEVE FORMER

INTENTIONALLY TO

104
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:01,030
INVESTIGATORS?

105
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,304
>> NO.

106
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,206
AND I SAW THAT IN THE MEDIA.

107
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,415
MAYBE SOMEONE MISUNDERSTOOD

108
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:06,237
SOMETHING I SAID.

109
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:07,409
I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT AND

110
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:08,710
DIDIDN'T SAY THAT.

111
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,518

00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:12,022

UP ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY.

115
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:14,316
IF YOU KNEW BACK THEN WHEN

116
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:15,873
YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE

117
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:16,718
INVESTIGATION, AND YOU SAW

118
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:18,401
THOSE TEXTS BETWEEN PETER

119
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:19,221

00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:21,723
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP,

122
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:22,532
WHAT WOULD HAVE YOU DONE.

123
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:23,983

00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,838
BEYOND THAT SUCH POOR

133
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:36,338
JUDGMENT.

PRODUCT THEN BE QUESTIONED.

136
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,048
>> SURE.

137
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:39,741
IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION

138
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,048
TO ASK.

139
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:41,349

00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:54,416
WHICH I TRY AND STAY AWAY

196
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,722
FROM, BUT AT SOME POINT I

197
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:56,919
WON'T.

198
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,524
>> Bret: WHAT DO YOU THINK

199
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:58,220
HE MEANT THERE?

200
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,222
>> I DON'T KNOW.

201
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,348
I HOPE HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT

202
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,133
HE IS GOING TO DECIDE BY

203
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,984
EXECUTIVE FIAT TO DIRECT THE

204
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,235
ACTIONS OF WHAT IS SUPPOSED

205
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,186
TO BE AN IMPARTIAL LAW

206
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:10,489
ENFORCEMENT FUNCTION.

207
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,610
LADY JUSTICE HAS A

208
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:11,939
BLINDFOLD.

209
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,536
IT SHOULD STAY ON.

210
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:15,142
>> Bret: DID THE INSPECTOR

211
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:16,291
GENERAL INTERVIEW YOU ABOUT

212
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,396
YOUR HANDLING OF THE MEMOS?

213
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:20,048
>> SURE, YEAH.

214
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:20,524
>> Bret: HAS?

215
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,048
>> HAS ALREADY.

216
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:22,348
I EXPECT A REPORT ON THEM

217
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:23,700
NOT ON THE HANDLING OF

218
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,353
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

219
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:25,447
BECAUSE THAT'S FRIVOLOUS BUT

220
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:27,149
ON DID I COMPLY WITH POLICY?

221
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:28,050
DID I COMPLY WITH MY

222
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,157
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT?

223
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:29,907
>> Bret: YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T

224
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:30,752
LEAK THERE IS A "NEW YORK

225
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:32,061

226
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:33,110

LORETTA LYNCH EMAIL.

228
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,535
YOU DIDN'T WRITE IT B. IT

229
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:36,558
HERE IN THIS BOOK BECAUSE

230
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:37,536
YOU SAID IT'S CLASSIFIED.

231
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:38,215
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" WROTE A

232
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:40,369
LOT ABOUT IT DID THE FBI

233
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:41,368
PUBLIC AFFAIRS COORDINATE

234
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:41,788
THAT STORY.

235
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:42,719
>> NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

236
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:43,873
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON

237
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:45,174
ANY STORIES BECAUSE I'M NOT

238
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:46,568

00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:47,869
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

240
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:48,625
>> Bret: ALL RIGHT IN THE

241
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,372
INFAMOUS OVAL OFFICE MEETING

242
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:51,073
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE

243
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:52,378
ASKED YOU TO STAY BEHIND

244
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:52,808
ONE-ON-ONE.

245
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:54,376
YOU WRITE IN THE BOOK THAT

246
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:55,835
YOU FELT AWKWARD.

247
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:56,985
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT.

248
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,386
>> CORRECT.

249
00:04:58,386 --> 00:04:59,807
>> Bret: YOU HAD BEEN

250
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:00,437
ONE-ON-ONE WITH PRESIDENT

251
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:01,089
OBAMA IN THE OVAL OFFICE?

252
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,091
>> CORRECT.

253
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:02,696
>> Bret: BUT THIS WAS

254
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:03,085
DIFFERENT.

255
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:03,390
>> YEAH.

256
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,686
BECAUSE HE BOOTED OUT THE

257
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:05,492
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE

258
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:06,888
UNITED STATES WHO WAS

259
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:08,490
LINGERING TRYING TO STAY.

260
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,195
>> Bret: AS OPPOSED TO THE

261
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:09,951
PRESIDENTIAL PHOTOGRAPHER

262
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:11,493
WHO PRESIDENT OBAMA BOOTS

263
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:11,750
OUT?

264
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,625
>> SURE.

265
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,495
>> Bret: YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T

266
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:14,800
PUSH BACK WHEN HE SAID HE

267
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,319
HOPED YOU COULD SEE YOUR WAY

268
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:18,800
THAT HE WAS A GOOD GUY.

269
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,507
HOPED YOU COULD LET IT GO.

270
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:22,324
YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T PUSH BACK

271
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:23,211
AND HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

272
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,510
THAT HE COULDN'T DO THAT.

273
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,312
ALL RIGHT.

274
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:26,762
SO LET'S ASSUME THAT'S TRUE

275
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:28,014
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

276
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:28,967
THAT IS IT POSSIBLE THERE

277
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,212
WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU

278
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:31,320
DIDN'T PUSH BACK AND THAT IS

279
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,516
THAT YOU WANTED TO KEEP YOUR

280
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:34,771
JOB?

281
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:36,118
>> IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT'S

282
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,119
NOT THE CASE.

283
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:37,819
AT LEAST I DON'T REMEMBER

284
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:38,977
THINKING ABOUT THAT AT THE

285
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:39,375
TIME.

286
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,222
>> Bret: YOU TOLD CNN LAST

287
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:40,922
NIGHT THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK

288
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,424
YOU WOULD BE FIRED.

289
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,725
THAT YOU KNOW, HAD YOU NOT

290
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,083
BEEN FIRED, YOU WOULD STILL

291
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,729
BE WORKING AS FBI DIRECTOR

292
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:48,036
TONIGHT.

293
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:48,436
>> YEAH.

294
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:49,686
IN FACT, THAT WAS MY

295
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:50,632
INTENTION TO SERVE ANOTHER

296
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:52,240
SIX YEARS.

297
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,116
>> Bret: SO, DESPITE THE

298
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:54,540
FACT THAT NOW YOU SAY THAT

299
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,872
THIS PRESIDENT IS MORALLY

300
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:59,397
UNFIT, THAT YOU SAY

301
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:01,743
IMPEACHMENT IS TOO GOOD OF A

302
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:02,350
REMEDY ON THE BOOK TOUR.

303
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,603
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

304
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:05,047
I SAID IN A WAY I HOPE NOT

305
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:06,105
BECAUSE I THINK THE VOTERS

306
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:06,826
NEED TO SPEAK.

307
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:07,856
BRET BRET EXACTLY ON THE

308
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:08,958
MEDIA TOUR AND THE BLITZ YOU

309
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,452
ARE BASICALLY ENCOURAGING

310
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:11,753
VOTERS TO VOTE TRUMP OUT OF

311
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:12,959
OFFICE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T

312
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,962
LINE UP WITH YOUR VALUES.

313
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:15,312
>> I'M ASKING THEM TO VOTE

314
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:16,462
THEIR VALUES AND WHAT I

315
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:17,314
BELIEVE YOUR VIEWERS WOULD

316
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,366
AGREE ARE AMERICA'S VALUES.

317
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:19,816
>> Bret: OKAY.

318
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:21,163
BUT AS OF TONIGHT, HAD YOU

319
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,964
NOT BEEN FIRED, YOU WOULD

320
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:24,121
STILL BE WORKING FOR THIS

321
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:25,572
GUY THAT YOU SAY IS LIKE A

322
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:27,869
CRIME BOSS WHO IS MORALLY

323
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:30,149
UNFIT, WHO YOU JUST DON'T

324
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,573
AGREE WITH ON PRINCIPLE AND

325
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:31,901
VALUES.

326
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:32,874
YOU WOULD STILL HAVE THAT

327
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:33,375
JOB TONIGHT?

328
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,534
>> ABSOLUTELY.

329
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:36,684
AND MY GOAL WOULD TO BE

330
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:37,679

STATES.

333
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:39,936
>> Bret: WHEN YOU SAY.

334
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:41,883
>> I RESPECT THAT OFFICE

335
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:42,384
TREMENDOUSLY.

336
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:43,018
>> Bret: WHEN YOU SAY TO

337
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:43,690
REPUBLICANS WHY DO YOU WORK

338
00:06:43,690 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH THIS PRESIDENT AND SIT
