AINSLEY: SHE ONCE BLASTED THE
PRESIDENT AS WHITE SUPREMACIST
BUT THE CONTROVERSIAL ESPN HOSTS
DESERVE A BIG AWARD.
STEVE NATIONAL BLACK JOURNALIST
AWARDED JAMILLE HILL WITH
JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR AWARD.
BRIAN: LAWRENCE JONES, SHE'S
COMMENTARY WHETHER YOU AGREE
WITH HER OR NOT, THAT'S A
BRAND-NEW NUANCE TO THE
CATEGORY.
>> THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE
SHOULD BE PROMOTING.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WANT
PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME, PEOPLE
THAT LOOKED UP TO HER TO HAVE
SOMEONE ON TV THAT WILL FIT
FOREVER, SHOW THEM THAT THEY CAN
DO IT.
NOW SHE CAN'T DO IT.
NOW SHE'S UNEMPLOYED.
THAT'S WHAT THE BLACK
ASSOCIATION OF JOURNALISM, WE
WILL APPLAUD UNEMPLOYMENT AND
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I STAND
FOR.
STEVE: WHEN I WAS IN JOURNALISM
SCHOOL IT WAS ABOUT FACTS BUT
NOW APPARENTLY JOURNALISM LOOKS
A LOT LIKE ACTIVISM.
SOMETIMES YOU WATCH THE BRIEFING
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, A LOT OF
ACTIVISTS IN THERE.
>> ACTIVISM IS STARTING TO PAY
MORE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTINUE
TO KEEP THEIR JOB.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU CAN
HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT DONALD
TRUMP, A LOT OF TIMES I AGREE
WITH POLICIES, AT THE END OF THE
DAY, YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR
AUDIENCE, YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHO
YOU REPRESENT.
HALF OF THE COUNTRY IS ON THE
RIGHT, HALF IS ON THE LEFT AND I
THINK SHE MADE A BAD BUSINESS
MOVE.
AINSLEY: WHEN THEY PULLED HER
OFF THE SHOW, THE RATINGS WENT
UP.
>> OF COURSE, BECAUSE YOU ARE
BASHING PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR
THE PRESIDENT, I JUST DON'T
THINK IT'S A SMART MOVE WHEN YOU
GET INTO THIS BUSINESS OF
ENTERTAINMENT.
YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO
DISAPPOINT SOMEONE WHEN YOU
START TALKING ABOUT POLITICIAN.
AINSLEY: SHE USES PLATFORM TO
ADDRESS NATIONAL, SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL ISSUES IN ADDITION TO
SPORTS, NEARLY BROKE THE
INTERNET LAST YEAR WHEN SHE
CRITICIZED PRESIDENT DONALD
TRUMP.
>> THE PLATFORM THAT SHE NO
LONGER HAS?
BRIEN: IF SHE DOES THE RIGHT
THING, BIG STORY AND SHE LOSES
HER JOB, A LOT OF TIMES YOUR
EDITORS DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR
WORK, IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB, MY
QUESTION IS, HER COMMENTARY MADE
THE NETWORK LOOK BAD, IS THAT
YOUR CONTENTION?
>> AT TEND OF THE DAY SHE WASN'T
REPRESENTING HER AUDIENCE.
AT TEND, WE ARE HERE TO PAY
BILLS, THIS IS CAPITALIST,
FREE-MARKET INDUSTRY WHERE YOUR
JOB IS DETERMINED BY HER
RATINGS, IF HER RATINGS WERE
HIGHED SHE WOULD BE ON AIR NO
MATTER WHAT.
YOU'RE THERE TO SERVE AUDIENCE,
GIVE THEM THE CONTENT THAT THEY
NEED AND SHE WOULD HAVE KEPT
JOB.
RATINGS WENT UP AFTER EVER SINCE
SHE LEFT.
STEVE: THIS ORGANIZATION HAS
BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME
AND THAT'S THE WOMAN THAT THEY
WE WANTED TO GIVE THE AWARD TO
AND THEY'RE FREE TO DO THAT.
>> THEY ARE FREE TO GIVE AWARDS,
BUT STANDARD AS BLACK JOURNALIST
THAT YOU WANT TO SET FOR THE
NEXT GENERATION, I THOUGHT WE
BELIEVED IN BLACK BUSINESS
OWNERS, HOW CAN SHE DONATE TO
THOSE BLACK FOLKS IF SHE DOESN'T
HAVE A PLATFORM.
IF I HAD A LITTLE GIRL, IF SHE
WANTED TO GO TO SPORTS, SHE CAN
LOOK UP TO JAMELE, WELL, THERE'S
NO JAMELE ANYMORE.
