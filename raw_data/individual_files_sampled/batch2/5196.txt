Donald Trump's tax records reveal fraud and schemes to duck taxes on a massive long-term scale that is the headline from a massive exhaustive detailed investigative report that the New York Times just drop on the political world tonight we're talking here about the core of Donald Trump's wealth and political appeal because he's always argued above all else before everything else he is he says a successful businessman but these journalists got a hold of over a hundred thousand pages of documents they found dubious tax schemes and quote outright fraud and the White House is already pushing back on this big story at this hour more on that in a few moments but this is significant apart from everything else that is controversial about Trump apart from his lies or his distraction tweets or his constant insults of all sorts of people this is a story the potentially undercuts the thing that Trump supporters say they've always liked about him the idea the belief and maybe the massive con that he is a self-made billionaire let's go over the details before we get to some incredible experts on this reporters examine bank statements audits and over 200 tax returns not just from Trump but also from his father from his companies which are Byzantine and from other Trump entities and what they show in this report which I think you're gonna be hearing about for a while as the Trump was helping his own family his parents dodge taxes through quote a sham corporation that was explicitly designed to hide millions of dollars sometimes in gifts and then take improper tax deductions worth millions more and then put together a scheme to undervalue again going back to mom and dad's money his parents real estate buy hundreds of millions of dollars cumulatively in these returns which would reduce the tax bill that they'd pay then when it passed through the family inheritance the New York Times which has taken a big swing here finds that all told Trump effectively got the bonus equivalent of at least four hundred and thirteen million dollars in today's money through all this and that undercuts the key claim that Donald Trump says he may his own fortune it's not been easy for me it has not been easy for me and you know I started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest had to pay him back for 1 mil well in a new statement Donald Trump's lawyers calling this story a hundred percent false and highly defamatory we begin with John Harwood EC NBC's editor at large and bill kristol found it at a large of the Weekly Standard I want to begin with the big outlines of what this is and then go into what it does so John Harwood what else can you tell us to help us understand what the scheme was well essentially re what the story lays out is the transfer of vast amounts of money from Fred Trump his father to Donald Trump other kids as well but Donald Trump was especially taken care of it includes getting thousands of dollars beginning when he was a kid and a million dollars by the tiny a year by the time he had graduated from college and the most significant things later in life have to do with the ways in which the Trump family evaded estate taxes by messing with the valuations of properties that Donald Fred Trump passed on to his kids always two years later let me hang it there when you say messing with the valuations is that what normal people would call lying about your money well The Times says that in many cases this involved outright fraud I think they don't make that statement likely you had multiple reporters investigating but it had the effect of shrinking the estate tax bill for Fred Trump's estate from more than 500 million dollars to about 50 million dollars the second thing that happened was that there were ways in which he was shoveling money to Donald Trump putting big bets at a Trump casino without placing any bets as a way of getting last-minute cash to Donald Trump that he created a shell company to inflate invoices for the Trump real-estate empire and made his children the beneficiaries of the profits of that shale company so that it was a way of getting money to them without incurring income tax liability it is a wide range of potential fraud there and I want to mentioned two things about it one we believe that there are statute of limitations on potential criminal charges but there are civil liability if New York state tax authorities decide to prosecute an a or to pursue them at a much earlier period remember New York state authorities wanted to treat Donald Trump very well it was a mutually beneficial arrangement they don't feel that way right now so that's potentially significant I appreciate raising we've hit that on the show and we've hit the fact that Bill and I've talked about it a lot of Democratic office holders in New York were cozied up to trump when he was just another businessmen and the question that I think normal people have when you hear this you say well wait a minute was everyone to sleep with the wheel if all this stuff is documented year after year and it's stayed in federal and the answer is yeah a lot of people went along with that corruption which i think is bad and bad for both parties you stay John you stay but I am gonna moderate my way to the other guests and come back to you bill I want to read to you more from the piece for your analysis again on the politics of someone who says hey I did this all myself the president's parents Fred and Mary Trump The Times reports transferred over a billion dollars of wealth to their children which could have produced a tax bill of at least 550 million under the 55% rate but the Trump's actually paid about 5% tax records show before you even get to ducking federal taxes which some people and certainly some Republicans say well hey I don't like taxes anyway how about the notion that this guy ran for office and ran around the primaries saying these are all phony politicians I'm self-made where I got one mil a mildewed a bill seems like a big difference I mean I spent the whole primaries he isn't thinking Trump University try there's so many frauds that are used to term legally but let's just say in a common-sense way that he was involved in interceptions and unsavory business practices that one thought that would have damaged him in the primaries and did a tiny bit but if she should voters didn't seem to care about and I guess the question is you know they might look at this and this sort of gets your point about so many businessman being treated this way by New York state authorities well what does it Balzac says I get and they are at the origin of every great fortune is a crime I mean you sort of wonder if you turned out with a rock on something you know how many of that would be like this seems a little exceptional I would say not to sound like some socialist or something here but I you do this it is a sort of a certain side of American capitalism the one isn't what isn't proud of for me the big story here though is what he you know people might have accumulated their fortunes and unsavory ways what about right today what about what he's doing is President has he severed his ties with the Trump Organization no doesn't quite seem so has he released his current tax returns okay let's not go back twenty years and question his late father and all that what about actual reality right now there I think there remains great vulnerability but I am I want to be clear a and you're a guest and you'll take whatever position you take in my line of questioning I am questioning his late father I am questioning the way that this individual took so much money from his own parents and according to The Times report has been lying about it John Harwood because it's part of either his natural tip because he was like this long before he was a candidate and because he recognized that this was his key point of appeal to folks who said well I may not like this now the other thing but I love that he's a self-made guy who can do for America what he did for Trump org well you know then that would be according to this calculus John that would be I don't know getting Great Britain to give us a bunch of money if he's gonna do for America what he did for himself well what I would say Ari is that the notion of Donald Trump as a self-made billionaire was foundational to his rise in politics but I do think that once he became a presidential candidate bill mentions the Trump University it has been widely known that there was some shady business practices around Donald Trump even during the campaign and since then a lot of cash transactions for real estate people a majority American people have considered Trump dishonest throughout his presidency I I think more recently his political appeal is grounded in his choice of enemies the people he goes after going after immigrants going after african-american athletes protesting racial injustice so it is I'm not saying that this isn't going to have some impact but I'm not sure how great of an impact it will have I will mention one other vulnerability one person who appears in this story at some of the critical events is Alan weiselberger who is the longtime business manager of the Trump Organization he is cooperating with the Southern District of New York and has in the investigation of Michael Cohen if there is going to be any current investigation that reaches back into the origins of the Trump fortune now and why Solberg may know a lot about it and may be in a position to hurt Donald Trump by sharing information key source bill kristol before I turn to Tony Schwartz co-author of the deal who's here to give us more context you mentioned Trump or the Trump University which was a business that made its money giving business advice and went out of business and I wonder whether there's an analogy there to some Republican Trump voters because the people who went to Trump University were huge Trump believers they even put money down and some of them came back around in that lawsuit to say and realize they were caught is there any corollary here bill that's what was so shocking about this was a con executed against precisely the kind of voters Trump was appealing to not so well-educated trying to make their way up you know the glamorous guy he's gonna help you find the secrets and success taking your money and he didn't pay much of a price for it and I guess I worried that the trumpets and we've been through so much now that Trump supporters have internalized though they'll beat this story they'll think hey you know what he calmed them all good for him he's kept money away from the federal government he took some money away from his rivals his father was kind of a cunning guy too you know we need someone like that as president he can cut good deals with our truck trade rivals and he can you know stand up to the Democrats I do worry look I'm not you know this is fantastic reporting and it's really kind of shocking to meet at all but I do worry that it won't have as much political effects people well I appreciate that little note of nihilism here before I let you go always always part of the these days john harwood and bill kristol in all seriousness thank you both for your expertise on a big story now as promised I turned to Tony Schwartz he's co-author of the art of the deal now CEO the energy project and a friend of the beat who has waited on some of these big stories that we want your expertise as someone who has been around Donald Trump so closely when you look at a story of this magnitude what do you think well I think two things one since 2016 I've felt and I've said on your show that there will come a moment where tax fraud and money laundering will be Donald Trump's biggest problem even bigger than collusion and conspiracy and that has come true now the second thing is that it goes far beyond even what I thought had happened this is worse than what you knew - oh my god I knew it was bad but I didn't believe this is a man who took hundreds of millions of dollars or fraudulently took hundreds of millions of dollars and when his father was 85 and near senile tried to write a codicil to his will to take over complete control of his empire why because Fred Trump was in the business of making money and Donald Trump was in the business of losing money and he lost money of Fred's throughout his career it's like the cover has been ripped off this man this whatever myth there was as you said earlier that he was a self-made man or that he was even a legitimate businessman it's gone forever right and that's a mythology that it's important to his public profile but also goes to who he is as someone in his father's shadow I should say as he put it or as you put it one never knows when it comes to quoting the book but I'll read from it I also realize if I ever wanted to be known as more than Fred Trump's son I was eventually going to have to go out and make my own mark that's from the art of the deal how important was that interplay that even before there were other potential benefits to exaggerating his own role in this he always did you find felt he needed to avoid crediting his father for what the time says tonight was basically a billion to him I have felt and said forever as long as I've known Trump which is more than 30 years that this is a man who is a black hole and felt in every feels in every moment like a fraud what comes out tonight is they had good reason to feel like he was a fraud he was a fraud and he was committing fraud fraud fraud fraud uhland he was being fraudulent and here it is in living color were in black and white since it's in the New York Times a brilliant piece of reporting I I think Donald Trump sitting in the White House tonight is probably feeling more enraged by this than by virtually anything that ever happened to him well you mentioned that in the article it says that from the times the president declined repeated requests over several weeks to address anything in this article this is exhaustive piece I want to play for you Donald Trump talking about how self-made he's always been take a look you see I built what I built myself and I did it by working long hours and working hard and working smart more importantly than anything else is by using my own brain this is a man who invented himself that's his claim to fame he literally invented it from whole cloth there's nothing about him that is real now we really see that and it's it's extraordinary I don't agree with Bill Kristol I think this is going to have a very significant long trail no one wants to say anymore that Trump has finally been caught that the Teflon has finally been scratched but I have to say the idea of who Donald Trump was that existed until today is gone forever I think that's significant and I think a piece of this detail and depth which everyone is still going to continue to digest over over the night in the coming days really goes to the heart of not only where he came from but where is he today and is he more in debt than he acknowledges and is that part of why the taxes aren't there all these things that are not again this is not about beating up on family members who are diseased you know or anything of that nature it is about the mystery and what the New York Times reports is the fraud at the heart of a financial empire that is coexisting with a presidency that affects everyone's national security and livelihood Tony Schwartz thank you for giving us perspective on that hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of
