00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,740
when you hear the word retiree you might

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,850
think of someone who's not that active

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,440
or people who are mostly taking it easy

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,719
but that's not we found here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> daytona</font>

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,369
during Bike Week when we caught up with

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:19,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bunch of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bernie supporters</font>

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,600
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of Bike</font>

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,270
Week festivities right<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here Ross fit</font>

00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the moving & shipping business since</font>

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,500
then he's taken his enthusiasm for the

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,880
Sanders campaign to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the streets of</font>

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,830
Daytona Beach where he's launched a

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,690
group called bikers for Bernie just in

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,320
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Daytona's famous Bike Week</font>

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,910
Daytona sits at the end of Florida's i-4

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,800
corridor a highway that stretches across

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state it's home to the bulk of the</font>

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,660
state's registered Republicans but it's

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,090
also seen as a swing area and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross is</font>

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,160
looking to bring those swing or no party

voters to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Bernie campaign this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">election was just something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> special you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with change their mind my gosh Bernie</font>

27
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,060

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,369
was talking everything that I feel

29
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,500
strongly about<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially getting money</font>

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,300
out of politics

31
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,420
we'll take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of half maybe</font>

32
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,980
three-quarters or the other step it'll

33
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,810
just happen because we'll start to have

34
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,870
a responsive government that thinks

35
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,420
about us and not about the big money

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,250
unlike some states Florida's primary

37
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,320
rules say anyone who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote must</font>

38
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">be registered with the political party</font>

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,070
meaning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 2.7 million registered</font>

40
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,780
voters in Florida without party

41

affiliation are locked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

42
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:56,880
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh lift a box up visit Hartley</font>

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,710
so you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some Trump supporters to ya</font>

44
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:05,370
oh look at that I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah</font>

45
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,590
are you generally a democratic voter how

46
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,990
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually leave I'm an independent</font>

47
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,390
I've always felt about I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

48
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,520
open-minded with the candidates that are

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,810
available and

50
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,030
with Obama it took me it was it was a

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,190
month before the election that I

52
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,319
actually decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for him this is</font>

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,370
totally different I'm very passionate

54
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,250
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bernie he's just he represents</font>

55
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,630
everything that's important to me and I

56
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,430
actually had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch from being an</font>

57
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,290
independent to being a Democrat here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

58
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,050
Florida or you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even vote so you</font>

59
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,340
think like his case he is sort of a

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,290
once-in-a-lifetime situation I think so

61
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,470
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very passionate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about by Bernie and</font>

62
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,989
his ability to do a good job be fair for

63
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:47,180
everyone and to make this country that

64
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can really be proud of and even if it</font>

65
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,209
costs more money whatever it is I'm for

66
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:55,239
it
