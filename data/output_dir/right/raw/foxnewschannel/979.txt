1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:03,508
IT'S NO LONGER DOWN WITH TRUMP.

2
00:00:03,508 --> 00:00:06,377
IT'S [BLEEP] TRUMP!

3
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:08,179

BRAD, GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

10
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:18,790
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

11
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,857
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.

12
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:20,925
>> Martha: YOU HEARD WHAT

13
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,794
HILLARY CLINTON WAS SAYING AND

14
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:23,861
TAPE, WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY THAT

15
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:26,431
SHE SAID THAT THEIR DATA WAS NOT

16
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,098
WORKABLE, IT WASN'T WHAT IT

17
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:28,666
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND THAT THE

18
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,768
DATA THAT YOU GUYS WERE USING

19
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:32,570
WAS BASICALLY FAKE NEWS AND DATA

20
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,573
MINING THAT SHE THOUGHT WAS

21
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:36,608
QUESTIONABLE.

22
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,008
>> YES.

23
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:40,178
THE THING IS, ONCE OBAMA WON,

24
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:40,945
THEY BECAME COMPLACENT A LITTLE

25
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:41,212
BIT.

26
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:44,249
SO AFTER THAT THEY FORMED THE

27
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:45,350
OFA AND WHEN THEY DID THAT THEY

28
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,018
REALLY KIND OF SPLIT UP

29
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:47,418
EVERYTHING.

30
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:49,120
IN DOING SO THEY REALLY GOT

31
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,155
THEMSELVES BEHIND.

32
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:51,856
SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND IN THE

33
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:52,557
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE

34
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:53,992
GOT AHEAD.

35
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:55,226
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE

36
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:57,195
CHARGE THAT IT WAS FAKE NEWS AND

37
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:57,762
NEFARIOUS DATA MINING?

38
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:00,565
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S FAKE NEWS.

39
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:02,600
FAKE NEWS AND DATA MINING?

40
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,968
THE DEMOCRATS WERE DEFINITELY

41
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:04,334
BEHIND US.

42
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:08,373
WHAT WE DID IS BUILD UP A

43
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:09,173
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE

44
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:10,508
AND VOTER PROFILE THAT YOU HAD

45
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:11,342
AGGREGATE INFORMATION THAT WE

46
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:12,076
COULD USE THAT INFORMATION CAME

47
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:14,712
FROM THE PARTY.

48
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:17,615
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF

49
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:18,249
HOLLYWOOD, THE DEMOCRATIC

50
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:18,950
NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF

51
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,584
CONGRESS ARE TURNING TO

52
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:20,551
HOLLYWOOD TO HELP THEM WITH

53
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,786
VOTER TURNOUT AND MESSAGING.

54
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:23,721
THEY HAVE CONFERENCE CALLS WORK

55
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:26,658
ON THEIR EMAIL LIST AND ONE

56
00:01:26,658 --> 00:01:28,593
RECENT WEEK MEETING A MIDWESTERN

57
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:32,063
SENATOR THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO

58
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:32,897
ADDRESS GUN-CONTROL WITH

59
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:33,831
CONSERVATIVE LEANING VOTERS IN

60
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:35,800
HER STATE ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE

61
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,234
PARTICIPANTS.

62
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:37,602
THEY ARE TRYING TO TALK TO FOLKS

63
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:39,003
IN HOLLYWOOD, DIRECTORS IN

64
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:39,937
HOLLYWOOD, ACTORS ARE ALSO PART

65
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:40,938
OF THIS GROUP AND SAY HOW CAN WE

66
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:43,174
REACH THESE MIDDLE VOTERS AND

67
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:45,410
GET THEM TO NOT VOTE FOR

68
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,010
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

69
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,378
>> I THINK HOLLYWOOD ELITES ARE

70
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:47,779
JUST BEHIND.

71
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:51,582
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW IN

72
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:52,350
DONALD TRUMP SOMEONE THAT'S WHAT

73
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,885
THEY ARE ABOUT.

74
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:57,822
HE'S THE GUY THAT TAKES SHOWERS

75
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,991
AFTER WORK, BEFORE WORK.

76
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:01,192
THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED.

77
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:01,893
THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE

78
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:04,829
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I THINK

79
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,963
AMERICA MOVES ON.

80
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:06,698
DONALD TRUMP AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

81
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:10,735
HAVE CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE

82
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:14,005
IN A WAY THAT PREVIOUS HAVE NOT

83
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:14,806
DONE.

84
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:15,540
TRY TO CONNECT WITH HOLLYWOOD,

85
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,409
THEY ARE JUST OUT OF TOUCH.

86
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,411
THE PROBLEM IS DONALD TRUMP IS

87
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:21,412
COMMUNICATING, THE PEOPLE HE'S

88
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:23,314
MAKING THESE THINGS FOR, THE TAX

89
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:25,350
CUTS, HE'S MAKING THE AVERAGE

90
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,551
AMERICAN LIFE IN THEIR PERSONAL

91
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:27,585
ECONOMY AND THE PERSONAL

92
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:28,319
SECURITY IS GETTING BETTER.

93
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,221
LOOK AT WHAT HE DID WITH

94
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:30,621
NORTH KOREA.

95
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:31,589
>> Martha: IT SO INTERESTING

96
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,191
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I HAD

97
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:34,425
McCARTHY ON, RUNNING FOR MAYOR

98
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:36,994
IN CHICAGO AND HE'S A DEMOCRAT.

99
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:37,628
HE'S RUNNING AGAINST RAHM

100
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:39,330
EMANUEL, WHO IS ALSO A DEMOCRAT

101
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,066
GARY McCARTHY IS SAYING THERE

102
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,134
ARE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO ARE

103
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:46,003
LIKE ME AND HE IS SOMEONE WHO

104
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:47,705
REALLY FINDS HIMSELF MORE IN THE

105
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:48,773
MIDDLE POLITICALLY BUT THEN

106
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:49,540
YOU'VE GOT ROBERT DE NIRO AS WE

107
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,577
SHOWED YOU THE OTHER NIGHT AT

108
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:54,545
THE TONY'S WITH THE

109
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:55,980
PROFANITY-LACED TIRADE AGAINST

110
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,382
THE PRESIDENT AND THEN HERE'S

111
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:58,783
WHAT HE SAID TODAY, WHICH WAS

112
00:02:58,783 --> 00:02:59,784
SUPPOSED TO BE SOME SORT OF

113
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:01,686
APOLOGY.

114
00:03:01,686 --> 00:03:02,019
WATCH.

115
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,589
>> I WANT TO MAKE A NOTE OF

116
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:05,356
APOLOGY FOR THE IDIOTIC BEHAVIOR

117
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:13,598
OF MY PRESIDENT.

118
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,101
IT'S A DISGRACE AND I APOLOGIZE

119
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:20,772
TO JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND THE OTHER

120
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:21,272
PEOPLE AT THE G7.

121
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:23,775
IT'S DISGUSTING.

122
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,410
>> Martha: YOUR THOUGHTS?

123
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,012
>> AGAIN, THESE GUYS ARE JUST

124
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:29,380
DISCONNECTED.

125
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,148
DONALD TRUMP IS FIGHTING FOR THE

126
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:32,216
AMERICAN WORKER.

127
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:36,587
CANADA HAS RAISED 270% TARIFFS.

128
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:37,722
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

129
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:38,756
THESE COUNTRIES TAKE ADVANTAGE

130
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:39,524
OF US EVERY DAY AND DONALD TRUMP

131
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:41,325
IS FIGHTING FOR THEM.

132
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:42,460
AMERICAN TRADE IS ONE OF THE

133
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,161
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE HAVE

134
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,061
AND WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR OUR

135
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:44,395
WORKERS.

136
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:45,496
OUR JOBS HAVE BEEN MOVED

137
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:47,698
OVERSEAS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

138
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,500
DOING THE THINGS, HE NEEDS TO

139
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,067
FIGHT AGAINST THESE.

140
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,469
HE'S STANDING UP, HE'S STANDING

141
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:52,370
STRONG AND THAT'S WHAT AMERICAN

142
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,639
VOTERS HAVE VOTED FOR, SOMEONE

143
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,406
LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD STAND

144
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:55,940
UP TO THEM.

145
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,175
THE HOLLYWOOD ELITES DON'T LIKE

146
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,009
IT.

147
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,043
THEY DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP

148
00:03:59,043 --> 00:03:59,410
SUCCESS.

149
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,211
THEY DON'T LIKE SEEING WHAT HAS

150
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:03,080
HAPPENED IN THE LAST 500, 510

151
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,615
DAYS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO

152
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,083
ANYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE CRAZY

153
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:06,851
COMMENTS TO GET THE STORY OFF TO

154
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:09,387
SOMETHING ELSE.

155
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:10,922
THEY THINK THEY CAN SHIFT THE

156
00:04:10,922 --> 00:00:00,000
STORY AWAY FROM THE SUCCESSES
