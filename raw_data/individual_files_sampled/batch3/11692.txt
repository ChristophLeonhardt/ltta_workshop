hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report we're in Bitcoin Miami we were here a year ago remember bitcoin is like 900 talked to Brock Pierce he said this was there a year 2017 to go to all kinds of new crazy highs and yeah it sure did now we're experiencing a bit of a pullback Stacy yes there is quite a little bit of a pullback if you want to call 50 percent correction and more you and I are quite used to this we've seen this many times 16 90% Corrections and the market so who knows it could fall even further it could the 200-day moving average by the way is at 8000 it could fall beyond that who knows but you know what has collapsed to nothing that is Karelian the headline reads collapse of construction giant with 43,000 employees globally sparks fear and mayhem so max you know Karelian is a 200 year old infrastructure company which builds hospitals schools prisons the hs2 line in total the firm participated in 450 public service projects in the United Kingdom this is part of the PF ideals Private Finance initiatives this is just one of the companies a 200 year old infrastructure company is collapsed it's been liquidated I saw that shareholders might actually get between less than a penny and 6p back to the pound invested in the company remember the reason why I bring this up is because bitcoin was birth into the world January 3rd 2009 the Genesis block and in that Genesis block it mentioned the collapse of the banks in the UK that were being bailed out 200 year old banks were being bailed out now we see two hundred year old infrastructure companies being bailed out yeah it's great really juxtaposition of Bitcoin and the trillion story and as you point out it's echoes the 2008 Bank collapse that spawned the creation of Bitcoin as a way to fight back against what is hyper financialization trillion is a victim of financialization and just like many companies in the UK and around the world private marketeers buy up lots of stock they low these companies up with debt and while extracting equity and then they let the company collapse under the weight of its own debt the PFI schemes were over there in the UK it's a quasi government private sector deal it was always and always a slush fund we've actually been reporting on this for a number of years saying these deals will collapse it's guaranteed about trillion house collapsed as we predicted exactly as we said it would collapse because you cannot grow trees to the sky like you try to do with trillion well by the way just so you know we're here in Miami where in the Brickell area of Miami and this is you might see some boats and stuff going by in the background and there's a bridge over there just so you might not be alarmed people get scared out there when they hear noises that they don't know what they are because they sometimes think we're on a green screen but the other point about Karelian all these other PFI companies are also getting waxed their shares are tumbling the government is actually looking at their balance sheets and seeing what's going on there one issue that arose with Karelian as the shared company's revenues were crashing they were having to borrow more and more short-term money and what did you say these are private these are public projects the government of the United Kingdom could borrow at all-time 450 year lows can private companies know here's a tweet from Joel Benjamin Karelian was trying to turn itself around while being charged a rate of interest of 8 to 10 percent above LIBOR for its emergency loans this is why private companies should not deliver core services for triple-a rated government able to borrow 0.5% Madness of course you know the taxpayer was always on the hook for that 8 to 10 percent above LIBOR that Karelian was paying alright but let's take a look at this the genesis of this this was a way for the UK government I believe it started under major John Major and to take debt off the government's balance sheet and to put her on the private sector to make the debt do GDP ratio looked healthier thus allowing the government to borrow more and of course this was a recipe for disaster it created a moral hazard on an epic scale and guaranteed to collapse as it has collapsed and yes the entire sector this entire PFI sector is collapsing will the Bank of England bail them out probably and again this is why people kind of rush to Bitcoin and gold because you can't print either of those well whether or not the Bank of England bails now is one thing they obviously have not stepped in the company is in liquidation has collapsed many of the biggest banks in the United Kingdom are owed money over two billion pounds we don't know we're gonna it's you know obviously what was it that Warren Buffett called these derivatives he called it like a spaghetti you never end you never find the end of it well here it'll obviously be in bankruptcy for quite a while and we'll have to figure out what what what they actually owned but one of the things that a lot of these companies do is they get the contracts they got these contracts by basically underpricing them to get it over you know be awarded the contract over the competition they couldn't deliver at the price but they had already flipped it they a lot of these PFI companies flip it to foreign holders in offshore entities and wolf street points out that Karelian was one of four companies the other three being balfour beatty inter serve and cure their pocketed over three hundred million pounds flipping PFI schools and hospitals to the highest bidder in other words many of karelians PFI assets are already in the hands of foreign domiciled investors meaning that while the government will have to take over many of the services Karelian can no longer provide it may still have to pay leasing costs to the foreign owned firms that Karelian sold out to otherwise those firms may sue the government for lost profits yeah this is a remarkable chain of events because you have UK companies are going to be privatized because the private sector is more efficient so they take it out of the hands of the government and then these assets end up in the pension funds and public pension funds of foreign governments to pay an interest income to foreigners supplied by UK citizens so it's a transplant of state assets with reliable income out of the UK to foreign governments you know we you and I have pointed out that these PF ideals have been very expensive to the UK taxpayer I'll end on this bit for this headline then and we're gonna go on to another headline relating to this but for this headline with Wolfe Street calm this is all happening as the true cost of PFI is becoming apparent in April 2017 a bombshell report by the National Audit Office warned that the price tag for paying PFI firms would reach eight point six billion pounds in 2018 alone in total taxpayers Oh a mind watering one hundred and twenty one point four billion pounds on public projects that are worth just fifty two point nine billion pounds and the compound interest continues to grow right I mean it's not a direct bailout in terms of okay the company went bankrupt and it's going under people losing their jobs pensions are being destroyed and the government's not bailing them out at this hour but a lot of that debt will end up on the balance sheet of the Bank of England they buy all toxic debt and then they'll say there's no inflation so to keep interest rates ultra-low which means no income for wages and no income for savers so it is a stealth bailout always in the stealth bailout they'll keep printing printing printing printing printing the value of fiat money continues to crash against Bitcoin so now we're gonna move on to the next headline about this and it's very very British I think it's good to end on this very British headline karelians highly inappropriate pay packets criticized the main lobby group representing UK bosses has savaged the highly inappropriate pay packets awarded to directors running the now collapsed construction giant Karelian the Institute of Directors also accused directors and shareholders of the stricken firm of failing to provide appropriate oversight of the company which is involved in a host of major government projects and vital public services and slumped into compulsory liquidation so Rodger Barker head of corporate governance at this institute of director says it's highly inappropriate that these men were awarded these massive bonuses throughout the basically collapse of this company they also a year ago did basically change their own governance structure whereby their bonuses are not subject to call back specifically they removed if the company collapses well the problem is and I've said this before the brutish character have used that type of fraud as quote unquote clever 99% of the British population they've president them to the facts that they've had their wallet stolen and beaten about the head buying fraudsters and say they're so clever how do I get it as PFI scheme how do I steal money like this right they don't see this as shortcoming they see this as the British character is right up there with barmaid and Bulldogs is theft so there's no outrage against it because there would be an outrage against the Queen and and the flag first of all the second of all they're gonna have an inquiry to decide whether or not to have an inquest whether to form a committee whether to explore the possibility if in fact there needs to be a discussion about possibly prosecuting the alleged crime and that'll go on for seven or eight years the statute of limitation will expire and the clevers robbers will you know run away and I want to say bravo news tonight will be Bravo you're cleverer than the thieves we love you cuz you're so British you want you to put the Marmite up is French Fang is fing like a canary because you're a freaking idiot okay well again I'm gonna read you this the whole quote because it's quite important to understand the you know the scale of what it has been done and how you know mushy the language is and how that get out clauses are already in there so this guy Roger Barker he's the head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors said that the collapse of the company suggests that effective governance was lacking at Karelian he added we must now consider if the board and shareholders have exercised appropriate oversight prior to the collapse I want to make a point about this is that the share price has been falling steadily since 2015 and then it really started to crash in 2016 and plunge the summer so who is short this the whole time who is making money of the whole time yes max tell me who George Osborne no no it was hedge funds hedge far shore ting this they figured it out they knew it despite hedge funds shorting wildly it was the the most the most shorted stock in all of Europe okay so how did the government not know how did in that condition the government continued to give them billions of pounds of new contracts because they're corrupt because it's a constitutional monarchy where there are no citizens there are only subjects of the crown and they want to get this the dell boy economy you know remember that show fools for fools for Harley boys Only Fools and Horses Only Fools and Horses where the hero is a schemer you know this is just done on an epic multi-billion dollar scale that's the national character that's true Chilean Churchill was a schemer you know he's he's a PCS an awful guy and they make these great movies about him but he's a kleptocratic well that's it for this half of the Kaiser report stay tuned for the second half a whole lot more yeah it's T tuned for the second half much more welcome back to the kaisers report I'm Max Keiser initial coin offering you know I don't think we've actually talked about initial coin offerings on this show well let's get into it right now arey you see the chief operating officer of storm token arey welcome thanks for having me what a pleasure to have you on I'm hearing great things about storm X and the storm token so it had a successful initial coin offering in 2017 so tell us about the storm token calm and gamified microtasks what is it yeah so we've been in market for about three years originally under the name bit maker with launched a storm token we rebranded a storm play we're on the Android app store and basically for trying out different products and services like Hulu games of whore final fantasy boomer you get paid in crypto whether it's a cerium Bitcoin and now storm tokens I took down into this little bit more so gamified microtasks yeah and tokens and I'm earning tokens I'm gaming so work through that a little bit more for me and for the audience what does that mean so we're a marketplace so from the user perspective I get paid is there any more Bitcoin or storm for trying out different parts and services so that's the user perspective and we game o fie the experience of that you get you sort of have this like journey so step one download the app stop to you create a profile and each time you get paid say a dollar and then when you hit the final goal of trying out Hulu for 30 days we pay you $15 in each area yay they let me ask them so far - social networking site like the cat names and I'm putting up content all the time I never get paid if I am working with storm tokens and I'm interacting out there I'm getting paid you're getting paid for by interaction micro tasks so you're disrupting are you disrupting social networks first of all we're disrupting the way advertising works so from the other side of the marketplace there's advertisers I pay for clicks and likes and downloads but if you're a store owner you want actually people to come into your try an appetizer and you know give you a real try likes and installs don't really do that and so we thought huh hey now business owner Hulu what if instead of paying Facebook or Google for fifteen dollars of clicks and likes give us the fifteen dollars and we'll give it back to the easier to actually try your product everybody wins alright so you're the ce o that coo yes so the coup now that's a pretty so you're up there on the c-suite so to speak yes i yeah and um so you're not the chief technology officer you're not the chief executive officer here the chief operations officer just for thirty seconds kind of break down what does ce o o does with an i co startup so mice but responsibilities are the day-to-day operations of the company it literally is everything end to end whether it's resourcing systems processes payroll whatever it could be I'm responsible to make sure that day to day we are executing right so this is a very you know this is a heavy gig it's all kind of flows back to you in a lot of ways and I understand this it's rolling out a fantastically successful let's talk about ICS now for those who are uninitiated what is an IC o so IC o stands for initial coin offering from our perspective it's more of a crowd sale so sort of like Kickstarter and crowdfunding the world the masses you support projects that you really believe in you put in a dollar you put a hundred dollars whatever it may be and you get a token that says I'm a believer in the storm token project I believe in everyday micro tasks people being anywhere anytime any device so what's the controversy with initial coin offerings because the it's not equity as such so it's not regulated some would argue by equity regulators but then again it's not there's a threshold in the ICO market where it has to have a utility value and how Congress interview are you to make sure fulfills that role it doesn't fulfill that role in how does it fulfill that role very significantly aware this is something that we think about all day and all night for us we're a utility token and there's two kinds of tokens right there's a security tokens where you actually are an investment vehicle into that company we're a utility token because we already had a product where the token was immediately utilized usable within our system and that those are the basic thresholds okay a utility not to get don't speak out of school or anything but no I'm just saying my following question so the sec yeah clearly they're there on this like you know you know so so how much dialogue if any or do you have it the sec do you are you do you have dialogue with them or how does that work that relationship because they're clearly they're looking at this very closely yes they are looking at this very closely because with anything with this much attention and this much impact globally you want there are gonna be some bad actors right for us we don't have any direct contact with the sec but we do pay for very expensive partners you know the perkins cuy firms and the Deloitte's who actually do have contacts with sec and are working very closely with us to make sure where we're hearing a second we're being very above far above board above board I guess board and how we execute and operate the company yes the sec seems like there are looking to encourage innovation at this stage of the game they don't they seem like they're really trying to sort through all the players in this and trying to warn folks when they see an obvious bad actor and they're like they're trying to encourage folks that are doing doing what they were perceived to be innovative things and the money raised on this you know you're not going through the VC route and who might take equity so this is just cash how much money did you raise for my ask so we raised it in December of 2017 and we sold about thirty two million dollars USD worth of storm tokens okay and so how was a earmarked for the spend over the next couple of years what are you looking to do so right now it's really staffing up the team we went from a humble team three four very scrappy entrepreneurs now we're being you know very expensive chief of staff we have a chief technology officer we're bringing in someone to really lead and define the future robot for our product there's gonna be engineers who can do a lot of the heavy lifting and so we're really raising the bar on our team so that we can execute really fast and then not make the mistakes of a newbie engineer it so bringing in the old with the new all right so bring it in some some senior folks to try so when you wake up in the morning and you head off to the to the pod or the office or the you know wherever the all high we're all right where you located so we're working at a Seattle Washington right and it's basically two rows of desks where we worked side by side in our little laptops all day long so what what do you will motivate to you about this project I mean when I said game affine micro tasks I mean I can see that this is kind of like a glimmer in your eye you really believe in this right so yeah why your what is your passion about this because you know if your passion is what's gonna make this project if you and your your colleagues what is it that really gets you excited it really is the idea of heard anywhere anytime from any device with micro tasks and technology we can actually really uh it's a normalized I don't know if that's a good word to use normalize how we are really a global nation so my story that I often tell is a auntie and Timbuktu maybe she earns 20 cents a day and that's her living but with machine learning tasks where she identifies 100 oranges in photos a day she can earn a dollar day so if we can significantly increase her standard of living she can easily turn around and teach uncle to do 100 photos of oranges a day so now they look double more than double dirty their income for the family they can teach their entire community their churches whatever their that is and so whole communities globally can rise thanks to micro transactions most of our digital transactions today are not built for transactions under five dollars and that's where blockchain and the storm truck in particularly is built for micro transactions so wait hear about the Bitcoin with a lot of fees now the micro transactions there happening to some degree yeah folks are getting it you know - is saying hey come to us we got we're better for payments etc but you're really specializing that five dollars I'm under they're not specializing but you have a sweet spot there I guess you could say so it the folks that are around the world that or this could make a substantial difference to their lives right because people are living on a dollar a day five dollars a day ten dollars they're very low income people yeah and and and if they have access like in nations in Africa for example they have phones and things where do you see growth in this work countries are growing up with this it really is more of the developing nations we're very popular in the Philippines Thailand Indonesia of course Mexico Brazil but we actually have a very strong US population as well so it's it's it's literally global 187 countries right and now slug-like crypto in general so the crypto market you know we got very frothy twenty seventeen twenty thousand on Bitcoin the whole market one hundred eight hundred billion eight hundred twenty billion we've had a serious correction I guess you could call it you know back to fifty percent some of the smaller coins how does that impact your business if at all and it impacts us because our communities really care and it really impacts them but overall as a company we're here for the long game versus the you know the the bumps it's gonna be a bumpy ride there's still a lot to be figured out about crypto and tokens and and blockchains in general our business model was already fixed we're already a growing company aranese actually double from last year so if we continue to focus on the numbers that really do matter versus the the short-term ups and downs of the token and all the I guess angst around that that's the angst around the token yeah thanks token angst centered mostly I think it's you know there's a lot of new people coming into crypto and they're suitable coin market cap and they're like haha yeah it's okay it's okay so yeah yeah yeah advice chill yeah long game versus short game there's still a lot of things that need to be figured out right a theory I'm sort of like dial up and you know 14.4 kill away dial up right now to the internet there's still some things I need to be figured out but it would be would it be fair to say are you millennial I went in the borderline after like coming after I'm one DeCosta I'm 1979 formally so I'm night in millennial nor Gen X I'm smack dab in the bastard so it's we hear that this generation is now accepting crypto as really and they've in there they've growing up back up now and they understand that banks are inferior in many ways and they are adopting crypto and they are living it then just like people have become you know smartphone from youth yeah what about that is that true what do you see that in that wasn't regard it's it's a whole another way of living I mean you go out to lunch and you venmo or you know Jack's wallet somebody you know a payment and you're done that's it it's very fast and simple and and the banks are seeing those dinosaurs and that's not really part of the necessary day-to-day life there being disintermediated there being just yeah you don't have to go drive through the bank to make your deposit or pick up checks anymore like you know we did in the 80s now let's deep deep deep done in with crypto there's an idea that you are owning sound money you are saving money in a way and that's very different than the generations we've just experienced that I've gone deep deep into debt re is your perception of money kind of a big philosophical question but it's your perception of money and is that do you think different with crypto versus let's say fiat money US dollars and that mad rush did use credit cards and go into debt is there any generational thought about that I think the younger generation say the millennial generation cares more about experiences and like the consumer II I need to have stuff so that's a little bit different and then wanting efficiency and valuing time very differently to and how we work and live that's important yeah Harry you chief operating officer of storm token thanks so much thanks well that's gonna do it for this edition of the guy's a report with me max guys are in Stacy ever I'd like to thank our guest re you stop joking if you want to catch us on Twitter its Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
