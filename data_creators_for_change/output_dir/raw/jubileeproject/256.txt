Hello, I’m Benedict and I’m the president of the American
Society for Deaf Children (ASDC).

2
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,970
At ASDC, we want to thank everyone who was involved
in this project.

3
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:25,970
We’d like to thank The Jubilee Project for producing this film and
all of you out there who viewed it.

4
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:33,010
Can you imagine that there are over 168,000 views
of that video?

5
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,890
And we also want to thank all of our sponsors. If not for all of you, we would have no money.

6
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:48,830
So we’ve collected probably over $2,500. We will use that money
for many different things.

7
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,750
Our mission is to spread awareness about American Sign Language.
Our belief is that children have linguistic rights.

8
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,560
Sign language, then, if they want
to add different communication methods, that’s fine.

9
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,560
We also have every two years a conference
for families who have deaf and hard of hearing children

10
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,960
So that’s what we do. Basically, we’re a volunteer organization

11
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,460
so many thanks!
