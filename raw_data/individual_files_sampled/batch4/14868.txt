it doesn't even make news anymore when there's an attack in Turkey or Pakistan or Iraq and Afghanistan and what is the Syrian civil war over the past five years being other than an attempt by Isis which was an offshoot of al Qaeda remember to take over an entire country how many hundreds of thousands dead because of that but weren't Canadian right and as a diplomat once said about us we're a fireproof house far away from matches yeah no no and Isis terrorists murdered a soldier Nathan Cirillo at our war memorial and then actually entered our Parliament itself when it was full of MPs and the government and the Prime Minister were literally barricade inside a meeting room it was amazing that no one else was murdered in the hail of gunfire inside and around the same time another soldier Patrice Vincennes was murdered too let's take a moment to save their names and look at their pictures since no one else will why is there no permanent memorial to them why is there murder not marked by our government they were specifically attacked because they are symbols of our national sovereignty why does our national sovereignty air such as das when I was in London recently and visited the site where a soldier named Lee Rigby was murdered by a Muslim terrorist there is no marker at other than a tiny little brass plate plate on the ground covered in dirt it doesn't mention who he was or why he was killed and how it's covered in dirt as you saw sometimes the forgetfulness happens in real time a Muslim terrorist named Omar Mateen murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando you'd think that would be newsy and it was but it was immediately transformed into an anti NRA moments by the liberal media Nidal Hasan was a Muslim soldier in the US military he actually made his own business cards that said soldier of Allah on them well he murdered his fellow soldiers at Fort Hood and the Pentagon called it a workplace incident just last month the son of a known Muslim terrorist co-conspirator was found in the New Mexico desert with several polygamist wives raising their brood of children in a bizarre compound a training camp to be school shooters not only did a local judge grantham bail but the local prosecutor he dropped the charges and then police bulldoze the crime scene he even though a baby was found dead in there why did they bulldoze the crime scene we are now being made to forget things even as they happen let alone try to remember 9/11 from 17 years ago that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra lavance show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
