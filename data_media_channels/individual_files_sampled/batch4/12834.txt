on Monday a mob of college town commies in North Carolina toppled a 93 year old Confederate soldier statue at the Durham County Courthouse and proceeded to kick the hunk of metal while shouting obscenities we'll analyse Plus Amanda presto Giacomo Jacob Arry and Paul Bois joined the panel of deplorable zhh to discuss the Trump train smashing CNN kumbaya nonsense and the bubonic plague I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show so we're going to get to this the toppling of the statues but first there is a little bit of business to cover I just got some bad news this morning my father called me he texted me first he said call me you get a chance I called and we found out that we are distant relatives of Hillary Clinton I am actually I'm somewhat tickled by it we already know that I am a cousin of Beyonce we haven't proved it yet but I think it's obvious but we are I have a first cousin once removed I think who married a Rodham which makes me and Hillary cousins so Madam Secretary whenever you get the opportunity would love to have you on the show and have a little family reunion now we have to move to smashing smashing statues so the left this has been brewing for a long time the left has wanted to topple these Old Confederate statues any remnant of antebellum South they want to get rid of and luckily we were you know I guess because people have smartphones now they're always recording these things as they happen we have video footage of the social justice warriors toppling the statue last night in Durham can we play it you know actually Marshall I think that was that it wasn't the college kids last night that was the Taliban destroying a 1500 year old statue of Buddha and yeah the way you can tell is the accent on the Allahu Akbar is it's not a southern accent it was more in Afghanistan accent would you we have the actual clip that we can play they are just charming aren't they just screaming like hyenas the little animals they do you see that one guy that kind of doughy guy at the end flipping it off and yelling obscenities so the issue here is did you if you didn't hear what they were chanting they chanted no cops no KKK no fascist USA later they chanted we are the revolution now I can get on board I guess with no KKK or no fascists or no Nazis okay the first one is no cops which they may have just been describing the event in Charlottesville on Saturday that might have been a recap of how little the police did to stop the violence there but I think what they're they're obviously far-left radicals and we do know that the people who came and pulled down this statue were members of the IWW the Democratic socialists of America the workers world party far lie mean actual communists right how did they pull it down Michael so they put a title noose around its neck and ripped it down and there is it's pretty funny that they chose this one because it wasn't a statue of Robert Elia it wasn't a statue of Jefferson Davis it was just a Confederate statue a generic statue dedicated to the boys who wore the grey and it was built a century goes built a hundred years ago and this there a lot of cities are following suit five cities around the country after the events in Charlottesville have said they're gonna pull down all their Confederate monuments officials in Kentucky Maryland's same thing at the time has come after decades we have to pull these things down and so are the Donald a wonderful source for news I check it every day it's the the reddit page for Donald Trump supporters they pulled out a few other examples of monuments that obviously now we have to take down for instance the Taj Mahal quote whoops built by hindu slaves time to tear it down i don't know how it's been allowed to stay up for so long the bill clinton of course we quote cannot glorify rapists tear down this symbol couldn't possibly agree more then FDR we have to remove this one quote internment camps for asians stole their property also communists all true and finally did you know that Martin Luther King Martin Luther King the great social justice activist he was against gay marriage got to pull that down and an adulterer and way come on now don't get off topic Martin Luther King was against gay marriage so obviously we got to pull that one down now I I have no sentimental feelings for the Confederacy i George Cobb Knowles an ancestor of mine was killed as a Yankee a Boyton plank road I'm a Yankee through and through but I really really don't like this move to take down the Confederates statues and statues of any kind for that matter so why not take down the monuments all of the argument it seems is on one side that we have to take them down but why not there are at least 1500 Confederate monuments around this country so I guess this little gang of roving communists is gonna have to go to each and every one of them all around the country and there is a lie that's going around the internet that these Confederate monuments they were really a lot of them were built in the 60s as a response to civil rights it's not really about southern culture at all that isn't true the vast vast majority of these monuments were built before 1925 they were built as the nation was finally healing from its Civil War so that you know for the first time you had Confederate soldiers who were receiving federal benefits for being American veterans you had that generation sort of dying off and and even rich Lowry from National Review which was formerly the definitive conservative publication he says it's time to take them down he wrote quote the monument should go some of them simply should be trashed others transmitted to museums battlefields and cemeteries and rich Lao I couldn't I couldn't disagree more but rich Lowry is invoking robert e lee himself in this he he points out that Robert Lee Ely noted quote I think it's wiser not to keep open the source of war but to follow the examples of donate those nations who endeavor to obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered now I don't know if rich is aware of this but robert e lee was wrong about a number of things particularly with regard to the civil war in particular the civil war he was completely wrong about the civil war why would we defer to him on how to recover from the civil war I'm not so sure one of the responses that they very often make the social justice warriors who want to take down the statues are that you know we took down not see statues after World War two when the Allen 1946 the Allies ordered the destruction of Nazi monuments and Nazi statues I think this is a stretch I think it's a stretch to compare World War two and the way that we treated our enemies with the way that we as a nation decided to heal from our Civil War to deal with our original sin of slavery and an issue that we've been trying to grapple with since the Constitutional Convention since the Declaration of Independence you know President Lincoln summed up how we were going to treat the South he said with malice toward none with charity for all we reunited as a country we've treated those soldiers as veterans we treated those rebels as our fellow countrymen another little point to notice is the Nazi regime lasted for 12 years the south is a political and cultural entity blasted but by the time of the Civil War it had already lasted for 250 years and it's lasted 150 years since then as well now if both people on the left and the right are getting this issue wrong the mayor of Richmond who's had plenty of calls to remove monuments from Monument Avenue there the mayor of Richmond levar Stoney sums it up pretty well statue on a tree-lined street it resides in hearts and minds and the way to change parts Thank you Thank You mayor Stoney for being the only voice of reason it seems in this debate he he went on to say perhaps it was in another place quote at the end of the day those statues were offensive to me very offensive to me I imagine they would be they're offensive to me too since they killed ol grant great-great-grandpappy Knowles but you know what I'm going to focus my time on destroying vestiges of Jim Crow where they live in our city public education you name it so he makes this great point toppling these statues will do absolutely nothing for the people who are living other than obscure their own understanding of history their own understanding of their communities but it won't have any tangible benefits to improve the lives of these people which he could do you could all focus his attention as the mayor on actually improving the lives of his constituents this same thing has been happening at my dear alma mater Yale it's been going on for years they'd wanted to rename the residential college it's sort of like a dorm there from john c calhoun because calhoun was a proponent of slavery so calhoun college has been the center of this debate for years they finally decided they weren't gonna rename it then they decided they were going to rename it because that administration these days has absolutely no backbone but last year it got even worse a yale employee took it upon himself to use a broom handle to smash an old stained glass piece because John Calhoun was on it he he destroyed this property this piece of art and not only did Yale force the sky to lose his job and not only did they not press charges they rehired and they gave him his job back they didn't press any charges and and then they suggested that they form a committee to decide which other pieces of art should go into hiding because they weren't politically correct or they refer to some aspect of our history that we don't like to acknowledge anymore that it's not fashionable to acknowledge the absolutely pathetic it's evidence that not only at Yale as a microcosm of this but now around the country the inmates are running the and I can think of no better example of the inmates running the asylum than bringing on our panel of deplorable as we have them in studio today we have all three in studio first of course first and best Amanda presto Giacomo and then we're also joined by Paul Bois and Jakob Mira this is an all-day Lee Weyer panel today so let's just go really quickly down the line we'll start with Paul what do you think of this should we take down the monuments should we not take down the monuments I think it should be left up to the municipalities and the people of the town I think they should have an honest healthy discussion not somebody at Huffington Post writes an article and then you get a bunch of sjw's down there that tear down the statues I want us healthy discussion if the statue should stay up true absolutely not no way this is this is step one I mean they're gonna keep coming what else is next what are we gonna take down next why are we erasing our history it's important to remember this stuff remember the races remember what we overcame and how we did overcome that and we United and came back from slavery so absolutely 100% no don't give them an inch they'll take a mile we're taking them down on their own stop them Jacob uh I'm think I'm the only southerner actually on this panel thank God no but I like I said I actually I agree with Paul I think it should be left up to the local municipalities as a person of the south I've seen how how hurtful kind of the lost cause which is such a ridiculous thing to talk about the civil war in that perspective in in New Orleans there was actually a statue that was dedicated to racism we were like weird it was a statute we're proud that that we're proud of our white heritage that one deserved to be taken down yeah obviously I would have given money for the bulldozer to knock it down even but as far as the historical statues I think I don't think we should pretend the civil war didn't happen we need to remember that it was a hard time and we fueled from it and should be left up to the locals whether they want to take them down or not so Amanda you seem to have the strongest opinion on this and I tend to agree with you what do you think about this argument they say well we won't destroy them we'll just put them in museums we'll put them in cemeteries put them out of the public square yeah I think again that's that's kind of erasing our history I mean that that's better than this nonsense where they're toppling them themselves that's disgusting but but again I mean I think it just show I mean and it's a slippery slope to as always so who else are we taking down next right are we gonna go you know in colleges they're already going after you know they've they're like just not covering people because there were slaveholders they're like burning books and colleges right now Oxford wanted to get rid of Cecil Rhodes out of yes for college right right so we see this everywhere and I think it's just really dangerous to set this precedent where we do this I mean yeah local news pal he's sure but where does it stop why do we set this precedent I think it's a bad move to do it there might be some good intentions but it could lead to some really bad things were just you know it's ten serene history absolutely Roger Kimball wrote a great piece when all the nonsense was happening at Yale I I suppose that is in a particular time it's been going on for years now yeah but he wrote a piece about how we need to rename Yale itself because obviously Elihu Yale was a slave trader and he was an British imperialist and it's unthinkable George Washington wasn't in favor of gaming business outraged let's start the petition now it you raise a great point which is that the it seems that we're a little less educated about our history right now it seems that the less educated we get about our history the more we want to tear down monuments that refer to our history why is that one I guess why don't Americans study history anymore and and and why does it make us so upset at historical reminders Paul well I think it was we get the talking points about what the history is we just say inveteracy racism and slavery and oh there's a statue over there that represents that so we got to tear it down we don't get the full historical context and understanding of why they exist and so that's why we just have that initial reaction we just get the base we don't get the full there there has been a movement in education to not read primary texts anymore to only read synopses of primary texts or second area third and we and we just you know we all operate off of emotion it's not a sterile but the facts or the context or any of them and it's just whatever you feel like braces them bad tear everything down censorship no like you need to understand the whole context you know and and from there but just this immediate gut reaction just go off of feelings and condemn people in a racist or sexist or bigots that's ever ever in our culture we see you here but I think this is important why do you think a healthy debate needs to be happening in these towns in these cities were these monuments exists and where I speak that speaks to the whole idea of them putting them in museums is that are we having an honest healthy debate where people are sitting what they feel about these things and art do we have a healthy view of the Confederacy because sometimes we necessarily don't I think those that will naturally resolve itself by having those kinds of healthy debates sure rather than the dictatorial tear them down right now left-right-left has pounced on this you know they do this every time they never let a crisis go to waste and of course you make a great point if these towns and these local communities want to take down their statues that's totally up to them I suppose but something tells me those Democratic socialists of America that we saw in that video were not live living in the local areas the IWW getting bused in there's obviously a well-funded effort Sorrells plants bravo certainly and that's another thing too is what they don't realize is these Democrats socialists and Tifa people who come into these towns that Shores up the other person's opinion so so you might have had a town having a debate whether to take down a statue but then when these Outsiders come in and just rip up your public property well of course you're going to go no that's my statue you don't have the authority to do that and so they're they're actually causing they are causing the fights and when when they could have easily just come in say hey listen why don't you have a debate about this this is important but can they can it be a rallying point that is the one counter-argument as they say if we leave up a statue of Hitler the Nazis are gonna use that as a congregation point or if we leave up a statue of Jefferson Davis Richard Spencer is going to show up there is that any sort of legitimate argument is there a real threat of that if there is should we even care no I don't think so I think the rallying point is happening because the the left is just going into these cities and saying tear them down without allowing any kind of debate and that's creating a vacuum that makes the Richard Spencer's and the neo-nazis go up and rally - have you noticed that you've never seen Paul blah and Richard Spencer in the same I'm just gonna leave that out there you know yeah anyway I hope that never happens I suppose that's right is there any there is no real threat here on this well it doesn't like it just doesn't solve any problems of racism by moving a statue or ripping down a statue what does that solve there is no debate as Paul was saying if there's you're you're deemed a racist if you even have a counter-argument to this there is no debate I mean but that's that's the biggest issue well doesn't it doesn't solve anything otherwise if a bunch of a bunch of conservatives rallied around a joseph stalin statue of which there are several in the united states what are the and we're gonna say hey you know joseph stalin tried tried to purge the Jews out of Russia you know just the same way that Hitler did out of Germany they would be done defending oh you don't know what you're talking about Soviet Russia was of all about equality and you know would be all of a sudden they would want to have a debate still we have a Stalinist on the past Amanda you make a great point too though there isn't that I think part of the reason why these views gained currency online is because there's such an oppressive culture where if you bring up any sort of idea I mean I get I did an entire episode yesterday about how awful the Nazis are there will be people online today who call me a racist sexist and all that sort of it happens to every single person who's ever voted Republican and so it allows these fused they're almost subversive they seem cool when in reality there's stupid ideas they don't have any serious philosophic or logical backing and maybe if you would allow them out into the open they would die as they as they ought to yeah this is so dangerous because there is there is no dialogue right now if you you know say anything remotely on the other side you are a racist you're there was um you know this whole all the Confederate stuff was there was an actor who was calling everybody and Nazi if they didn't want to ban free speech for people what sir ideologies I mean that's if you don't want to kill the Jews you're a Nazi it was just you know there's there's just no dialog around this is not some healthy debate and a municipality where they decide okay we'll move this into a museum that's not what's happening what do you think about robert e lee's argument that it would be picking at old sores and it'll keep the scabs alive reminds us evil that are staying i think it reminds us it's actually a reality i mean trying to just so i don't think of you to want to think about anybody you're up first yeah i like and you know maybe we should retreat from all these identity politics that we have right now because you know we don't want that that that evil that racism that we overcame i mean it's important to remember it we're not glorifying it it's it's our history and it's actually what happens acknowledging you can run away maybe just remember that it's because i think something in the public square is not necessarily acknowledgment that's reverence and that's where the the debate needs to come into play you know are we reviewing these or are we just acknowledging our history that's why a museum takes place this one may be keeping on battlefields i mean that's an honest discussion to have I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing that people are talking about sure but you know if you if you throw them into those museums you might as well throw them into drawers and lock them up right I think that's the well it's true you know the old cliche those who don't remember their history are doomed to repeat it right you know so I think it is important that in that context you know some of these statues maybe do need to stay up so we so we don't repeat that history sure well you know we have so much more to talk about including bubonic plague but you cannot see it if you don't go to daily wire comm right now I want you to stick around I need you to be here but you can only do that if you go to daily wire comm right now it's $10 a month $100 a year you get the leftist here's tumblr keeps your leftist here's hot or cold always salty and delicious and if you want to watch that this is not a good example we only have Amanda today but you know very often it's not just Paula and Jacob air here we have a wonderful panel of deplorable so you got to go to daily wire calm right now and sign up president Trump I love him so much he tweeted out and then deleted a photo just within the last two days of a Trump train smashing a person with a CNN logo for ahead and the caption said fake news can't stop the Trump train man first questions to you how much better is Donald Trump than all of the other presidents combined you know how many orders of magnitude I mean okay so I'm not a fan of the memes of the WWE stuff I'm just not a fan of you see my I like that I don't like when my but it doesn't matter because the media is so hysterical and so crazy that anytime Trump says something like this their overreaction he's calling for the murder of journalist by the way I don't think it's a meme I think it's a documentary yeah so I mean anytime they react to it something present Trump's out that I'm not a fan of I'm like okay I love it because they're just so hysterical you know he's not advocating for the murder very calm down he's not I'm not actually conducting a train but Jacob is it too soon I mean this a poor woman got mowed down by a Nazi on Saturday is it a little soon to be posting these images yeah I think maybe just a little bit too soon but I guess in all fairness to the president Jim Acosta was kind of acting like a harpy I'm shocked and shocked to hear that it's kind of funny I I think that meme in particular was too soon but had Trump tweeted out another one I probably would have been okay with it cuz in the process ruined CNN for me completely yeah I actually love him because he is Will Ferrell in anchorman I really enjoy his he does elope there's rumors he might get his own show I hope that's all I won't give him one on the daily wire why he deleted the tweet yes was he right to delete the three eight or should he have left it certainly doesn't help him if there's one thing about trunk that's always been beneficial to Trump is that he's owned appalled do you think you think deleting it doesn't help them yeah I think yeah deleting it doesn't help yeah one thing about Trump is that he's unapologetic and that this makes him look apologetic and to speak to Amanda's point the media always overreact to this I mean the last time he did that WWE tweet they ended up finding some 15 year old writer online Doc's together so leave it up and probably troll them to the point if they can do something else I think even though I hate this stuff I think whatever yeah but but is the meme correct true or false fake news can't stop the train because of people like Jim Acosta I mean they fuel his base so much they don't get it and they just think don't understand they've learned nothing and they keep fueling him I mean every time they have an overreaction for time they you know call me Nazi sympathizer or whatever it just fuels his base and when they lie and they have to retract that fuels his base know their fake news only helps him they are fake news by the way they they may have been pulling just New York Times Washington Post CNN have had to retract major stories fire reporters we're not talked about just getting a couple facts wrong they have been terrible at their jobs right now missing why why is that is it just something about Trump that works them or have their standards fallen for some other reason I honestly think it's they see Trump as a traitor right because he used to be a Democrat one of them he was one of them and all of a sudden he's not and they are trying to punish him for it but they but exactly what what what you said earlier there's just shoring up his base that's that that's all there is to it they are they are oiling that machine and it's gonna keep on going because Trump is so brash and unapologetic typically they really hate that and I hate I think he'll snack come back that was one of the things that I really liked about Trump and I'll smack the media and they just can't stand it I can't say I'm being called fake news in the middle of a press conference and he talks like in New York which is I mean you know this the way New Yorkers sometimes in people who aren't from that wonderful place here in New Yorkers talks why are you so many it's just the way you talk and he'd we haven't seen that in a very long time since FDR I guess was the last New Yorker president and he did not he did not talk like the Donald okay we have to move on speaking of the mainstream media continuing to harp on president Trump they're harping on his condemnation of the Nazis not being emphatic enough and the Nazis seemed to agree actually so Richard Spencer called it quote kumbaya nonsense he said he doesn't take very seriously others echoed those sentiments Jacob or Spencer and the mainstream media correct no the Spencer is just doing this to get attention we didn't even know who Spencer was until the media started reporting on his of course he would have no platform right now but because the mainstream media want to somehow tie this guy to trump this this horrible racist they want to tie him to trump they're just gonna report every single little thing he says and especially if he says Trump by name but he died I mean these guys I'm all for admitting that the Nazis are they have left his premises I'm all for saying that I think these are fundamentally left-wing movements but they're also a little bit right-wing movements to write these guys did vote for President Trump so there is some association there yeah I think he got so the media are gonna say things that aren't true no matter what they're gonna go into matter what but I think Trump got himself in trouble he should have named right off the bat I should have named both groups and Tifa and and the UH Nazis because that's I mean very violent one exam I mean obviously the Nazi flat his car but all of those little attacks you saw the canister with a homemade flamethrower and the rocks and all that that seemed to all be an Tifa or largely antifa right so when this was coming out I mean he should have condemned both sides specifically called out the the man with white stems white supremacist ties murdered that's awful announced at all but because he didn't and it was kind of it almost sound like he was going off script and he was reading that you know many sides many sides trying to not take I think Trump is annoyed that they're being tied to him because he hasn't he hasn't known cuz they would do it anyway I mean they do it to every Republican they say when did you stop beating your wife I think it's that sort of moment so I don't think it was necessary enough Trump I might be naive to not name them specifically I think he's just annoyed that they're being tied to him anyway so we're saying everyone everyone there doesn't want to name them by name because then it's tied to him that's what the media is trying to do but because of that when Trump comes out a second time and then names them you have these white supremacist who are saying I didn't really mean it took and that's the problem that Trump steps into by doing created it for himself yeah right Paul did he is he just playing footsie with fascists here or is he damned if he does and damned if he doesn't I think he's damned if he does damned if he doesn't so you don't you don't think he's winking at these guys at all I know keep their so my honest opinion is it is I think it's just Trump being Trump I think he just wanted to say what he wanted to say and that is say on many sides and he's not necessarily thinking clearly that people are going to want him to tailor his rhetoric towards specifically condemning white supremacists so he just comes out he says it and then huge blowback and everybody's like saying yeah he got a condemned specifically and he's like well I said what I wanted to say and so okay now he goes out and says it and looks like he's just you know caving to press demands at see ads that's I was just gonna add you know I think we also have to be careful on the rights criticism of Trump on this because when Obama would come out and say anything that had to do you know with the Dallas what anytime a police officer shot an unarmed an unarmed suspect Obama would go out immediately reactionary and then we on the right would always go oh wait wait let's let's measure let's let's get all the facts and then I think Trump did that as well he's like why he gave a statement of situation yeah so and then when he got all the facts he came out and condemned them I I do think in this case since we know it was in T Funyun are neo-nazis you should have done it but I also think some of the criticism is being a little harsh on him well yeah they're also just totally me and everyone in America it feels like it's just totally ignoring you know when President Obama would never name black lives matter would never name he would fight or my child would look like Trayvon Martin yeah exactly and for some reason we forgot all this I mean you know black lives matter sympathizer murder five cops in Dallas he didn't condemn black lives matter erased them you know memory holding nobody remembers that and other graves at their funeral right but but president Trump I mean President Obama was wrong to do that and it's I also think present Trump should have named both an tyfa and then he announcing and he should name President Obama I look we did eight years of blame Bush I want a little bit more blame well now those answers were not hysterical enough so we need to Ratchet it up a little bit and talk about bubonic plague in other signs of the Apocalypse the black death appears to have made a return to the United States fleas carrying bubonic plague which killed 50 million people in the 14th century and took out between 25 and 60 percent of the European population have infected three victims in Arizona pawa is our Lord's return to judge the living and the dead eminent well as our Lord said Michael it is not up to us to know season so I'd be a bit even you this would be a bit more concerned of antifoam barging in your show one day and then the black day my rapture exactly Amanda we always talk about our news cycle as if it is the end of the world you know every election is the most important election of my lifetime and everything this is the end the conservative movements over the right wing as are the countries over is it is there anything right now is our time especially dire or is this just typical hysteria to a little bit I thought what we're gonna all die of Ebola and Zika fine but yeah it's to get hysterical stuff I mean if you look at you know everything in context then this kind of stuff happens and we'll be alright what our culture is rotting the heaviness of that that is the plague Jeb we would you make a fair point that the culture might be decaying but we are living through basically the greatest time of peace and prosperity in the history of the world and yet rates of anxiety are on the rise depression or on the rise why are people not happy I think it's the media the mainstream media always churns out anything if it bleeds it leads right so they're always churning out everything that could possibly go wrong I mean if you remember when the Malaysian Airlines plane vanished how could I forget yes CNN harped on that for six freaking months okay it's not we don't know what happened to it it's either since someone to Malaysia investigate or shut up you know it doesn't they run these stories over and over again and it's it's basically it's it's basically pornography for the people for people who have anxiety so there I'm all for blaming the news I blame there is you got to this point of the culture decaying yeah I think that might be part of it there is a we have all the money in the world now we're we are richer than anyone has ever been is there some sense that that's not quite gratifying we've turned away from nobody and I'm alone that's not happiness so yeah but dr. Peter craved Boston College are really kind of said it best all of our technological advances is all a great how but we've made a greater how and for a lesser why we don't necessarily know why why were we have all these signals why we have our houses and which it's always about what we're doing yeah what we're doing it's always about proclaiming the God and that is that collapsed in the 1960s that is a pretty dire way to end but we have to so thank you the panel of deplorable Paul Bois man to press to Giacomo Jacob airy now it is time for the final thought inside every social justice warrior is a tyrant yearning to spring out the left famously never lets a crisis go to waste and our American Taliban has seized on the crimes of a handful of idiots and criminals in Charlottesville to finally topple our Biloxi Buddhas that impulse is revisionist anti historic and unamerican the truth above all things toppling statues achieves nothing other than obscuring our history it's an attack on our ability to understand our country and ourselves and robert e lee is only the beginning the left's rapacious appetite to whitewash our history will grow only more ravenous who's to say where it will turn its fangs next who's to say I don't know I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Knowles show thanks for being here come back tomorrow we'll do it again
