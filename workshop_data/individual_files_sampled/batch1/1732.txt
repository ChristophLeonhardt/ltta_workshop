it's our closest star but in many ways it's still a mystery The Sun has influenced our belief systems our art our travel and of course it's the basis for life on earth this show at London's Science Museum looks back at how we used to think about the Sun and forwards to challenges like really harnessing its energy with things like solar panels for the first time it's actually started become cheaper than fossil fuels but we will still need that push from politics and also from the everyday population as well one idea featured here is how scientists have tried to recreate the nuclear reactions that power the Sun known as nuclear fusion they thought they'd succeeded in the 1950s but they hadn't and even with the latest machines like this recent prototype nobody's managed to get more energy out than what they put in in fusion on a commercial basis is cracked and the results could be game-changing the amount of energy you can get out from fusing the atoms together is absolutely vast millions and millions of times more efficient than the burning of fossil fuels one of the main messages from this exhibition is the huge variety of ways in which we humans use the sun's movement and its energy for our own benefit but there's a warning as well the sun's activities could pose a real threat to our planet a threat very few people know much about the Sun it's called space weather and in particular solar storms when the Sun throws out huge clouds of plasma as this interactive game shows the phenomenon can knock out satellites in space and power grids here on earth there aren't things that people are doing so the Met Office now maintains a 24 hour space weather forecasting Center where they monitor the Sun watching out for the early signs of one of these major storms and if you get more warning that means you can warn the people who run there just agreed warned satellites you can ground flights to avoid people getting high doses of radiation at high altitudes one of these things scientists could get more answers fairly soon a NASA probe set off towards the Sun this summer and in 2020 the European Space Agency launches its solar orbiter from its vantage point 42 million kilometers from the Sun it could provide clues about what drives the sun's magnetic field back here on earth the team at the Science Museum hoping this exhibition will attract a big audience and some stellar reviews nadine barber al jazeera London
