the assault against the Affordable Care Act isn't over they try to get ready the entire thing last year and weren't totally successful and they have been chipping away at it ever since and now that assault is continuing in a new stealthy form both in the Department of Health and Human Services and also in various forms in States and today we're gonna break that down it's coming now in the form of what are called short-term health plans and those are being pushed for traditionally for people who are like between jobs or something like that they can't necessarily get a normal health plan for the long run so they get a temporary one but that's now being used in a multi-pronged attempt to try to destabilize the entirety of the ACA so these short-term policies typically typically have higher out-of-pocket costs and cover fewer services than traditional insurance because they're extremely limited in what they actually do and importantly that kind of coverage is free from the ACA x' insurance regulations that includes the mandate to cover essential health benefits which sound like the sort of thing that health insurance has to cover or else what is the point but they don't they don't have to cover that the prohibition on charging sick people more than healthy people they can get around that they can deny people coverage based on their medical history and they can also impose caps on how much you can spend each year overall or in particular things like physical therapy they just cap out they don't want to pay any more because all of the advancements in the ACA to try to get rid of some of these historic abuses against the American people are allowed in these short-term caps now the Obama administration in an effort to curtail the use of such coverage to sort of circumvent the ACA back in 2016 shortened how long you can have it to three months well the Trump administration is going to reverse that rule once again allowing people to buy this not Obama care coverage for almost an entire year now the benefit and the reason that this is very stealthy is that these plans are in the short-term less expensive so long as you're healthy they can be up to 70% cheaper than ACA plans so long as you don't actually get sick or need any coverage once you do they're incredibly expensive but if you're healthy they might seem appealing at least for a little while jank but the damaging thing there is if you try to get people to sign onto these sorts of plans yes they'll pay a little bit less then but who is it going to appeal to certainly not the very sick the terminally ill anything like that it's going to appeal exclusively to healthy people which means that you then take those healthy people out of the ACA pools which will of course drive up the cost of health insurance for the people remaining in it and that is how long-term they can do another way to try to destabilize the entire thing make it fiscally impossible to sustain and bring down the entire structure okay this is a nearly perfect Republican trick so on the surface if you're not paying any attention and you don't dive into the Annoying details well hopefully Gaiden is gonna bring down my reach that's true it does it does bring down your rates so you've to win excellent okay well they're incomes is the issues first of all it's not actually insurance what do I mean by that so if you're young and healthy and you don't have any problems you pay them now you give them money and since you're healthy you get sometimes nothing in return or some small amount thing for a check-up or something like that right but if you get sick they cap how much you can get in ear so to be fair it's half insurance so if you break your leg you're not gonna hit your cap for the year and they're gonna cover your insurance for you if you break your like you get cancer you're gonna hit your cap and and guess what happened you're dead you just don't have insurance and nobody's gonna pay that money and you hit your cap you don't have it they're not gonna give it to you oops it turns out you didn't really have insurance they took all your money but when you really really needed the insurance they don't cover you yeah so it's a mirage so it's not even good for the people paying the low rates second set of people paying the low rates that are gonna get screwed the ones that then develop a pre-existing condition you didn't have one going in you came in healthy uh this happened to me luckily I had good insurance if I was under this system maybe I would have been screwed at the age of 31 I appear to be perfectly healthy and then I got a really bad illness and then all of a sudden I got a pre-existing condition so if then if I go turn around a by that same insurance once it runs out cuz they're all short-term they're like sorry now your insurance is sky-high if sometimes we won't even let you buy it oops another Mirage so they lure you in with fake promises of it being a low amount you're paying but that's just basically to take your money yeah because if you have a really bad illness they're not going to cover it okay and then for the people who already have pre-existing conditions you're totally screwed well then what is the goddamn point of health care the whole point is we all put our money together that's how insurance works and so if any of us get sick you take it out of the insurance if that's not how it works and the healthy people pay for no reason and the sick people die that's not insurance so they're they're gonna kill the Affordable Care Act by driving up the prices for anyone that isn't already young and healthy and and by the way the third leg of this is on top of everything it actually increases expenses for the federal government and drives up the deficit it's a lose-lose all around and but the one set of people who win from this health insurance companies you know what Blue Cross and Idaho is calling the new plans freedom plans yeah yeah you got the freedom to die if you hit your yearly cap if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday
