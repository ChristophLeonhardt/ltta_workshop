BETSY DEVOS IS IN CHARGE OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.
HERE'S A PHOTO OF HER TO JOG
YOUR MEMORY.
IT WAS
REPORTED ON THE SHOW YESTERDAY
SHE HAD A TOUGH TIME ON 60
MINUTES EXPLAINING AND DEFENDING
HER RECORD WITH MICHIGAN
SCHOOL CHOICE, OPPOSITE LESLIE
STAHL.
HERE'S A REFRESHER.
TAKE A LOOK.
NOW HAS THAT HAPPENED IN
MICHIGAN?
MICHIGAN IS YOUR HOME
STATE.
YES, THERE'S LOTS OF GREAT
OPTIONS AND CHOICES FOR
STUDENTS.
HAVE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN
MICHIGAN GOTTEN BETTER?
I DON'T KNOW.
OVERALL?
I CAN'T SAY OVERALL
THAT THEY HAVE ALL GOTTEN
BETTER.
THE WHOLE STATE IS NOT DOING
WELL.
WELL, THERE CERTAINLY LOTS OF
POCKETS WHERE THE STUDENTS
ARE DOING WELL.
YOUR ARGUMENT THAT IF YOU
TAKE FUNDS AWAY, THAT THE
SCHOOLS WILL GET BETTER IS NOT
WORKING IN MICHIGAN
WHERE YOU HAD A HUGE IMPACT
AND INFLUENCE OVER THE
DIRECTION OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM
HERE.
I HESITATE TO TALK ABOUT ALL
SCHOOLS IN GENERAL BECAUSE
SCHOOLS ARE MADE UP OF
INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS
ATTENDING THEM.
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HERE ARE
DOING WORSE THAN THEY DID.
MICHIGAN SCHOOLS NEED TO DO
BETTER.
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
SHE KNOWS THAT SHE HAS TO
KEEP SMIZING THE WHOLE TIME.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
GOING TO SAY.
SHE HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO
SMILE THROUGH ANGER.
LIKE I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
I RANK HER NUMBER ONE IN THE
COUNTRY OF SMILING
PLEASANTLY WHILE BEING
INTERNALLY FURIOUS.
YOU ARE OWNING ME RIGHT NOW, I
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.
COME AGAIN, I DO NOT
KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
THAT'S IT, IT IS THE NOT
KNOWING WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
AND SO SHE TRIED TO DEFEND
HERSELF ON TWITTER AND THAT
ASPECT OF NOT KNOWING WHAT SHE
IS TALKING ABOUT COMES THROUGH.
HERE'S A TWEET SHE HAD TO DEFEND
HER PERFORMANCE.
SHE WRITES:
SEE ATTACHED TWO CHARTS.
THEY SHOW, THE GRAY LINE, FOR
THOSE AT HOME WHO ARE JUST
LISTENING, THEY HAVE A LINE THAT
REPRESENTS THE NATIONAL PUBLIC
AVERAGE AND THEN THE MICHIGAN
LINE AND KIND OF WHEN BETSY AND
HER FRIENDS GET IN CHARGE OF THE
MICHIGAN EDUCATION SYSTEM, YOU
SEE THAT MICHIGAN'S NUMBERS FALL
BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN
BOTH MATHEMATICS AND READING AND
WHAT BETSY DRAWS FROM THIS IS
THE CONCLUSION THAT EVERYONE
NEEDS TO DO BETTER, SO WE NEED
MORE OF HER POLICIES, EVEN
THOUGH YOU KIND OF HAVE A
GRAPHIC
REPRESENTATION THAT HER SCHOOL
CHOICE POLICY IS FAILING
HER STATE COMPARED TO THE REST
OF THE COUNTRY.
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE
KIDS AT HOME CALL A SELF OWN.
OH YEAH, 60 MINUTES DIDN'T SHOW
YOU HOW STUPID I REALLY AM SO
LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO
SHOW YOU WHAT A MISERABLE
FAILURE MY IDEAS HAVE BEEN IN
MICHIGAN.
HAVE YOUR OPINIONS OF HER
CHANGED AFTER SEEING THIS
RESPONSE AND THE 60 MINUTES
THING?
HAS YOUR OPINION CHANGED OF HER?
WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE 60
MINUTES THING, ANA AND I TALKED
ABOUT IT EARLIER IN THE WEEK,
WHAT CAME ACROSS TO ME WAS
AFFLUENZA.
THAT SHE IS SO WEALTHY THAT NO
ONE HAS EVER ASKED HER TO
DEFEND HER OPINIONS BEFORE.
SHE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE GOING,
BETSY, YOU ARE SO RIGHT AND
WHAT A PLEASANT SMILE.
OF COURSE.
SHE NEVER HAD TO DO HER
HOMEWORK.
SUCCESS WAS NOT TIED TO MERIT IN
BETSY DEVOS'S WORLD OR IN
DONALD TRUMP'S WORLD.
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES DONALD
TRUMP WENT BANKRUPT HIS DAD
WOULD BAIL HIM OUT.
NO MATTER HOW MANY CLASSES HE
FAILED, HIS DAD WOULD BAIL
HIM OUT, SO HE LEARNED, YOU DO
NOT HAVE TO DO HOMEWORK.
SO AS PRESIDENT HE DOESN'T DO
IT, AND BETSY DEVOS DOES NOT DO
IT.
IN THE CASE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS,
THERE IS ALSO VERY MIXED AND
THERE IS NO CONVINCING EVIDENCE
THAT THEY DO BETTER THAN PUBLIC
SCHOOLS AND ON THE ISSUE THAT
SHE VOLUNTARILY BROUGHT UP ABOUT
HOW THEY PULLED PUBLIC SCHOOLS
UP, WHEN YOU TAKE MONEY AWAY
FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THE
CHARTER SCHOOLS, SHE IS FLAT
WRONG
THERE.
NO, IT HURTS PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN
YOU TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM
THEM AND OF COURSE.
BUT AT LEAST MAKE YOUR CASE,
BETSY.
WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE IF YOU
WANTED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY
MISLEADING IS TAKE ONE STATE
THAT ACTUALLY DOES WELL WITH
CHARTER SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY
EXIST AND IN THAT CASE, ARIZONA.
FLORIDA DOES WORSE, MICHIGAN,
THERE ARE A LOT OF STATES
THAT DO WORSE AND CHARTER
SCHOOLS DO WORSE THAN
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN SOME INSTANCES
OR A LOT OF THEM, BUT IN
ARIZONA THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DO
PRETTY WELL, SO YOU COULD OF
JUST
SAID, BUT LESLIE, WHAT ABOUT
ARIZONA?
LET ME READ YOU THE STATS OR
AFTER THE INTERVIEW, DO YOUR
HOMEWORK.
YOU ARE THE SECRETARY OF THE
WHOLE DEPARTMENT.
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
WORKING UNDER YOU.
HAVE ONE OF THEM TO THE HOMEWORK
AND THEN SEND OUT THE TWEET.
FOR ME THIS BEHAVIOR JUST
UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT SHE
IS A LOBBYIST AT HEART BECAUSE A
LOBBYIST DOES NOT EVER QUESTION
THE GOAL, AND THE GOAL FOR HER
IS TO EXPAND CHARTER SCHOOLS.
HER GOAL ISN'T NECESSARILY TO DO
THE BEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT
OF EDUCATION, TO DO THE BEST
FOR SCHOOLS AT LARGE AND
CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS.
HER DECISION HAS BEEN MADE A
LONG TIME AGO BECAUSE OF
THE PEOPLE SHE HANGS AROUND.
THAT IS PART OF AFFLUENZA AND
SHE JUST DECIDES THAT MY
JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I GET
THIS MONEY FROM PUBLIC
SCHOOL SYSTEM TO THE PEOPLE I
KNOW WHO ARE ASKING FOR IT
AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS.
SHE'S BEEN, THERE WAS ONE
AMAZING OP ED THAT SAID SHE
SPENT, THE DEVOS FAMILY
CONTRIBUTED $1.45 MILLION
IN 2016, OVER THE COURSE OF TWO
MONTHS, WHICH MEANS
THEY WERE GIVING $24,000 A DAY
TO TRY TO GET MORE MONEY AWAY
FROM
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND,
THEY BECOME PUBLIC SCHOOLS
BECAUSE THEY ARE PUBLICLY FUNDED
BUT WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER
TO BE A PRIVATE, RELIGIOUS
INSTITUTION AND THE TROUBLE
WITH THAT IS SHE DOESN'T EVEN
OPEN IT UP FOR THE POSSIBILITY
THAT YOU CAN EVALUATE THE
SCHOOLS PROPERLY, BECAUSE ONCE
YOU GET OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
SYSTEM, WHICH YOU CAN AT LEAST
MONITOR AND TEST AND SEE CLEARLY
INTO, ONCE YOU GET INTO THE
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, THEY HAVE
MADE IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT
TO SEE HOW THEY ARE DOING AND
HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT.
AND BY THE WAY, THAT IS A
SECOND PROBLEM.
SHE'S A RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALIST
SO SHE THINKS, EVIDENCE?
I DON'T NEED THE EVIDENCE.
WHATEVER I WAS TOLD BY MY LEADER
IS CORRECT, PERIOD.
END OF THE QUESTION.
DO NOT BOTHER ME WITH YOUR FACTS
AND LOGIC.
IN FACT, LOOK AT THIS ONE
COMMENT SHE MADE IN THE
VIDEO YOU MUST EARLIER.
"I HESITATE TO TALK ABOUT ALL
SCHOOLS IN GENERAL BECAUSE
SCHOOLS ARE MADE UP OF
INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS
ATTENDING THEM."
BY THAT LOGIC YOU CAN NEVER
EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT CHARTER
SCHOOLS OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS DO
WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP OF
THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENS THAT
ATTEND THEM.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE
EDUCATION SECRETARY IF YOU
CANNOT JUDGE THE PERFORMANCES OF
ANY OF 
THE SCHOOLS?
