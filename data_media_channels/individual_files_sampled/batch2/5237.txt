the party of Trump has another crisis on its hand this time thanks to a candid who's declared himself Trump e'er than Trump political reports that there is a growing concern among Republicans that don blankenship a bombastic coal baron who has spent time in prison for irregularities and keeping the bind safe is surging ahead of Tuesday's well at West Virginia Senate primary and a last-minute campaign is underway to try and stop the guy the West Virginia races the highest-profile three critical primaries tomorrow night with other key races in Ohio and Indiana in recent weeks Blankenship has made headlines by launching Trump style personal attacks against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the family of his wife Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao Swamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people while doing so mitch has gotten rich in fact this China family has given him tens of millions of dollars the war to drain the swamp and create jobs for West Virginia people has begun that will beat Joe Manchin and ditch cocaine Mitch well today from this is how bad it's got today Trump weighed in on the race tweeting Don Blankenship currently running for Senate can't win the general election in your state no way remember Alabama well Blankenship fired back at a town hall today it's really sad that the pressure on the president and the misinformation and the untruths that he's been given would cause him to suggest that you vote for two guys that have failed you because I will not fail you if well he also told West Virginia's only he can out Trump Trump let's listen to that while West Virginia really loves trunk it's just policies that they love I'm basically Trump e'er than Trump when it comes to those policies but I'm a much more mild mannered and much more in line in terms of social issues and West Virginia than even president Trump let's bring in the hardball rounds over Eugene Robinson's the comments with Washington Post and an MSNBC contributor Alain Schneider is campaign reporter for Politico and Sahil Kapur is national political reporter for Bloomberg politics what I see there is a like selling Carvel ice cream or the local Ford dealership it really shouldn't be on television but he owns the company so he does the ads I thought that was the strangest that I don't know if he's gonna win in West Virginia look the whole thing is really strange and and if you're to Trumpy for Trump we're who are you what are you clean up China it's it's crazy this is a three-way race and as you know in a three-way break well one guy surging Elena when I always thought trying to pick these limits newspaper needs to try to pick him all the time I always liked the who was where were they stood before the election and who was surging it was real simple and this guy surging and they're close would suggest he might well win the Brahma nation that go against Joe Manchin he's got momentum heading into the dimensional probably beat him with me well he's won statewide five times so he'd be in a great position better position than any of the other candidates so why are the Republicans doing what I think the Democrats are poised to do sometimes commit Harry Caray what did they want to do that well there's a bit of a murder-suicide going on between between Moore's Patrick Morsi and Evan Jenkins who are the two other Republicans who are running they've been beating up on each other for so long that I've ignored him surge up the middle say he'll that they've tried to put him down by ignoring his appropriateness for the office but maybe the people are really enraged at West Virginia once somebody who's inappropriate for the office right I mean they're they're the public polling in this race is really sparse we don't know what's going to happen but Republicans are clearly concerned enough to you know sound the alarm and to urge people starting with the President himself to urge West Virginians to come out and reject Blankenship there is a through-line here if you look at the kind of appeal that this scorched earth almost burn it down attitude has among Republican voters President Trump took advantage of it in 2016 Roy Moore took advantage of in Alabama Don Blankenship is trying to claim that same thing there's no ideological or policy well let's go back to Richard Murdoch in Indiana who knocked off Richard Lugar mmm got beaten by Donnelly Democrat let's seek Oh Todd akin the other rape candidate what do you think the to rape candidates then we had Christina down to which candidate it wasn't which and then not a Sharron Angle the one who wanted second amendment remedies like oh shoot the policy don't like right there's a long rich history of Republicans shooting themselves in the foot by nominating on electable candidates now the problem here is that West Virginians were also told that Donald Trump could never possibly win and they voted for him and he won it's hard to convince them it's hard for the man who defied that exact phenomenon to convince these same voters that no you have to believe me this time well there it is identify with the client with with mine disasters you got convicted for it however if you accept that nationwide Republicans and Democrats Donald Trump's floor is something like 35% yeah it's not out of the realm of possibility that you can get 35% for a Trump e're Trump in West Virginia among Republicans in West Virginia that's not that much of a stretch you know I think of DC what we had barring Barry who is extremely popular with poor people here and the more the government went after him catching them with the dope and everything the more people rallied to them so maybe it's one of those weird parallels where when you're really down and out like the West Virginians always feel is down and out that they feel that they've got to get even with with the boss they're also hearing the most from Blankenship he's outspent both candidates on television and that's also a herbicide copy there were cheating the way he behaved there that monotone he's Trump without the charisma it seems without the color and not the who knows what works I think a nice day hear it but there's an element of Trump to his voters that is fun this guy is not fun hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
