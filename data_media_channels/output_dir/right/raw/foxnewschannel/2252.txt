1
00:00:00,185 --> 00:00:01,787
SECURITY, AN ISSUE OF U.S.

2
00:00:01,787 --> 00:00:02,187
SOVEREIGNTY.

3
00:00:02,187 --> 00:00:04,556
MEXICO NEEDS TO BE HELD

4
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:04,957
ACCOUNTABLE.

5
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:05,757
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT IS TIME FOR

6
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:07,860
THE WALL TO BE BUILT ON OUR

7
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,327
SOUTHERN BORDER.

8
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:10,429
JOINING US NOW, COUNSEL TO THE

9
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:11,063
PRESIDENT TRUMP, KELLYANNE

10
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:11,630
CONWAY.

11
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,232
I WOULD BE NEGLIGENT, I REALLY

12
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:14,700
DON'T WANT TO DIGNIFY THIS

13
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,235
RIDICULOUS DINNER, BUT I THINK I

14
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:17,903
WOULD BE NEGLIGENT IF I DIDN'T

15
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:20,606
ASK YOUR THOUGHTS.

16
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:23,175
I REALLY, TRULY -- IT IS SO

17
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,276
INSULTING AND CRUDE AND I TRY

18
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:27,179
AND ALWAYS SPLIT THE TABLES, IF

19
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,814
IT IS WITH A CONSERVATIVE

20
00:00:28,814 --> 00:00:30,816
COMEDIAN SAYING THIS ABOUT ANY

21
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:33,285
LIBERAL WOMAN, WHAT WITH THE

22
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,554
RESULTS BE?

23
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:38,557
>> SEAN, IN SOME WAYS, IT WAS

24
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:39,391
VERY LITTLE THAT WAS SURPRISING

25
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:42,527
ON SATURDAY NIGHT, THOUGH, SO

26
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:43,595
OUTRAGE FROM SOME PEOPLE WHO

27
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:45,931
LOOKED DOWN AT TWITTER ALL DAY

28
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,133
LONG AND SEE THE LIKES OF SARAH

29
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,568
AND IVANKA, V, INSULTED.

30
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:50,802
THIS JUST HAPPENED RIGHT IN

31
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,137
FRONT OF THEM WHERE THEY WERE

32
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:53,205
ALL GUSSIED UP SO THEY COULDN'T

33
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:53,538
DENY IT.

34
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:54,940
IN SOME WAYS, IT WAS JUST

35
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,942
ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE.

36
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:58,210
THEY KNEW THEY WERE INSULTED

37
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:58,977
HANDILY.

38
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:01,780
IT DOESN'T MAKE SOME PEOPLE AND

39
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,149
BE MISERABLE OR US ANY LESS

40
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,583
POWERFUL.

41
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,984
AND BEAUTIFUL TO THE JOBS THAT

42
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,152
WE HAVE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTRY

43
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,354
THAT WE LOVE.

44
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:11,290
I ACTUALLY THINK BOTH EVENTS

45
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,391
SATURDAY NIGHT REALLY HELPED

46
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:12,858
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

47
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:15,560
FIRST HE GOT TO GO TO MICHIGAN

48
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,529
AND TELL -- HE WAS IN

49
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:18,230
WASHINGTON, MICHIGAN, TOUTING

50
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,333
THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS, THE

51
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,768
HISTORIC NATURE OF WHAT'S GOING

52
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:26,004
ON IN KOREA, AND THEN THE EVENT

53
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,406
HERE IN WASHINGTON, IT HELPED

54
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:28,106
THEM AS WELL, BECAUSE IT FED

55
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:31,710
RIGHT INTO ALL OF THE CYNICISM,

56
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,312
THE SKEPTICISM THAT A LOT OF

57
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:34,346
AMERICANS HAVE ABOUT THE

58
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:36,615
MAINSTREAM MEDIA WRIT LARGE.

59
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:38,517
THEY HAVE A -- LET ME SAY

60
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:38,884
SOMETHING.

61
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,585
I SPENT TONIGHT TRYING TO FIND

62
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:42,421
OUT HOW MUCH MICHELLE WOLF WAS

63
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:42,721
PAID.

64
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,356
NOBODY WILL GIVE ME A STRAIGHT

65
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:45,324
ANSWER.

66
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:46,158
I CALLED THREE PEOPLE WHO WERE

67
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:48,560
ON THE DAIS, WHO ACTUALLY PICKED

68
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,962
UP THE PHONE, AND NO ONE WOULD

69
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:50,862
GIVE ME AN ANSWER.

70
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:53,298
THEY SAID, THEY HAD NO IDEA.

71
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:55,500
>> Sean: I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

72
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,502
ABOUT THE ANCHORS AND REPORTERS

73
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:58,303
FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, TOO,

74
00:01:58,303 --> 00:02:00,539
CONSIDERING EVERY VOTING CARES

75
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:01,239
ABOUT MINE.

76
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,174
>> HOLD ON.

77
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:03,575
THE REASON I AM SAID THIS, WE

78
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:05,344
ARE TOLD THIS IS A SCHOLARSHIP

79
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:06,378
DINNER, AND YOU SHOULD PAY FOR

80
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,347
YOUR ENTERTAINMENT, BUT I FEEL

81
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,983
REALLY BADLY FOR THE STUDENTS.

82
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:11,683
THE PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT

83
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:12,417
MET THEM AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

84
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,119
THEY TAKE PICTURES WITH THEM THE

85
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:17,422
OTHER DAY, I HAD OCCASION TO SEE

86
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:18,757
ME SCHOLARSHIP WINNERS, I FEEL

87
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:20,559
SORRY FOR THEM, BECAUSE THEY

88
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,326
WERE ALMOST AN AFTERTHOUGHT THAT

89
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:21,927
NIGHT.

90
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:24,229
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO SAY THIS

91
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,564
WAS ABOUT THEM, THE

92
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:26,164
FIRST AMENDMENT.

93
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:28,533
WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE

94
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:29,968
ASSOCIATION STOOD UP AND SAID,

95
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:31,169
AN ATTACK ON ONE JOURNALIST IS

96
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,971
AN ATTACK ON ALL JOURNALISTS,

97
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,606
WELL, FOLKS, THINK ABOUT THIS.

98
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,441
AS AN ATTACK ON ONE WOMAN OR TWO

99
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:39,244
WOMEN AN ATTACK ON ALL WOMEN?

100
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,278
>> Sean: I'M GLAD I DIDN'T

101
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:40,879
INTERRUPT YOU.

102
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,383
THAT'S A POWERFUL LINE.

103
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:45,917
NORTH KOREA, HISTORY IN THE

104
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,251
MAKING.

105
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:49,388
NO ONE SAW COMING.

106
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:51,189
IRAN'S INTELLIGENCE,

107
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,157
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS RIGHT.

108
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:54,493
THE UNPRECEDENTED ALLIANCE,

109
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:56,361
ISRAEL, UNITED STATES, THE

110
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,195
SAUDIS, JORDANIANS, EGYPTIANS,

111
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:59,197
THE EMIRATES.

112
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:01,566
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE WHAT PEACE

113
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:05,971
THROUGH STRENGTH CAN DO.

114
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:06,471
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

115
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,573
IT'S INCREDIBLE, SEAN, AND IT IS

116
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:09,241
URGENTLY OWING TO

117
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,342
PRESIDENT TRUMP LEADERSHIP AND

118
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:11,777
HIS VISION.

119
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:12,411
AND ALSO HIS PATIENTS.

120
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,546
THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT HE'S BEEN

121
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:15,247
ABLE TO BUILD WITH LEADERS

122
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:18,550
ACROSS THE WORLD IN THE FIRST 15

123
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,251
MONTHS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION,

124
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:20,452
THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF SINCE

125
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,888
HE WAS ELECTED, HAS LED US TO

126
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:26,124
THIS MOMENT AND FOLKS DON'T

127
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:26,925
UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF

128
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:28,527
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA

129
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:29,895
REALLY COMING TOGETHER HOLDING

130
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:32,697
HANDS AND SAYING THAT DECADES OF

131
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:36,835
WAR WILL -- COULD JUST BE SWEPT

132
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:37,436
AWAY, COULD END, ALSO,

133
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,238
NORTH KOREA HAS AGREED TO STOP

134
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:41,573
DOING ITS NUCLEAR TESTS TO ALLOW

135
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:43,742
INSPECTORS IN, WHICH IS KEY, TO

136
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:45,777
GO BACK TO THE SAME TIME ZONE AS

137
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:47,646
SOUTH KOREA, A LOT OF PROGRESS

138
00:03:47,646 --> 00:03:49,614
THERE, AND ITS DONALD TRUMP

139
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:50,715
LEADERSHIP.

140
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:51,583
MANY CRITICS OF THIS

141
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,284
ADMINISTRATION ARE GIVING HIM

142
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:55,587
THE CREDIT FOR THAT.

143
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:56,221
>> Sean: THESE ARE AMAZING

144
00:03:56,221 --> 00:00:00,000
TIMES.
