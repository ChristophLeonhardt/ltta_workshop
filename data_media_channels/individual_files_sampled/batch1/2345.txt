it tastes like a washed-up version of a burger but it's very bready okay this is harder when you can't see it it tastes decent it doesn't taste bad that is like the unmistakable McDonald's I think there's a McDonald's cheeseburger this is like probably McDonald potential a McDonald's hamburger McDonald I'm gonna guess Dairy Queen mmm this has to be from Wendy's oh so dry it's like there aren't even patties on these burgers but immediately that's McDonald's oh no you know what this is McDonald's I was wrong this is McDonald's is the ketchup can I say McDonald's for all of them very similar to the last one small patty no I think this is another McDonald's again I'm confused I take it back that Burger was not McDonald's this burger is McDonald's I think this one is remote Donald's the other one I have no idea I might be off on this I want to say Burger King hmm okay this is the best burger of all the burners in I've had I bet this is a Burger King burger it already smells smoky right off the bat it's Burger King it's Burger King because you can taste it char grill baby this must be Burger King at a strip flame-broiled I think this is from Burger King you think it's gonna be this like hit up like your childhood and like nostalgia but it really just makes me feel sad number three was definitely my favorite I like the second one the best three the first one definitely number three was my favorite so number one was my favorite burger and I'm pretty sure that one was from Wendy's if for some reason I had to eat a fast-food burger then I would choose number three
