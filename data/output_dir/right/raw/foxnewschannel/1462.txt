1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,836
MATTER AND THE PRESIDENT IS IN A

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,971
POSITION TO SAVE THEM.

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:05,305
MARTHA.

4
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:06,039
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

5
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:10,477
HERE NOW, JASON HILL PROFESSOR

6
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:20,587
OF MRFS

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,489
HERE NOW, JASON HILL PROFESSOR
OF MRFS  -- DEPAUL UNIVERSITY.

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,926
I KNOW THIS ISSUE IS NEAR AND

9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,328
DEAR TO YOUR HEART.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,196
YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT TO SEND

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:30,864
THE FEDS.

12
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,564
HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK?

13
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:36,403
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT COULD

14
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,606
SEND IN THE NATIONAL GUARD.

15
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,976
I THINK THE NAVY OR THE MARINES

16
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,945
COULD BE SENT IN.

17
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,748
I THINK IN 1957 PRESIDENT SIZE

18
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:49,282
I THINK IN 1957 PRESIDENT SIZ

19
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:53,987
SIZE ---IZE

20
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,858
EISENHOWER PROTECTED SCHOOL

21
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,094
IMMIGRATION AND PRESIDENT BUSH

22
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,997
DID IT TO PROTECT THE CITY OF

23
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,632
LOS ANGELES ON THE HEELS OF THE

24
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:10,637
RODNEY KING RIOT AND GEORGE BUSH

25
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,172
DID IT TO SEND TROOPS TO THE

26
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:12,806
MEXICAN BORDER.

27
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,607
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS

28
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,877
SEVERAL OPTIONS AT HIS DISPOSAL

29
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:22,048
HE WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL

30
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,049
GOVERNMENT IN CHICAGO.

31
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:27,687
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE

32
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,289
ELECTIONS GOING ON THERE AND THE

33
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,724
POLICE HAVE BEEN TESTING AGAINST

34
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,025
THE CURRENT MAYOR.

35
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,828
IS HE PART OF THE PROBLEM OR THE

36
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,195
SOLUTION?

37
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,262
>> I THINK HE'S PART OF THE

38
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:36,730
PROBLEM.

39
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,966
I THINK WE'RE UNDER THE MAYORAL

40
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:46,506
GOVERNANCE OF AN IMPOTENT MAYOR

41
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,575
WHO IS COMPLACENT AND THAT IS

42
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,377
SYSTEMATIC OF WHAT IS GOING ON.

43
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:57,050
I THINK THAT WE HAVE POLICE WHO

44
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,355
ARE UNABLE WHO CAN

45
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,490
SYSTEMATICALLY FIGHT THIS KIND

46
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,626
OF GANG WARFARE.

47
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,329
WHERE GANGS ARE RULING TURFS, IT

48
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,866
IS UNCIVILIZED AND UNSPEAKABLE

49
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,701
THAT THE NOT JUST IN CHICAGO AND

50
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,902
BALTIMORE --

51
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,837
>> Martha: PROFESSOR, I'M ALMOST

52
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,739
OUT OF TIME BUT I HAVE TO ASK

53
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,875
YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE NFL

54
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,478
ISSUE AND KNEELING AND POLICE

55
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,212
BRUTALITY CONCERNS, ARE YOU

56
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,314
TRYING TO WAKE UP PEOPLE TO WHAT

57
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:32,018
PERHAPS IS A MORE PRESSING ISSUE

58
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,353
FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS

59
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:33,953
COUNTRY?

60
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,655
>> IT'S THE ABSENCE OF LAW AND

61
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:44,097
ORDER RUNNING AMOK A THUGGISH

62
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,132
THEORY AND THE RULE OF LAW HAS

63
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,834
TO TAKE FORM AND AMERICANS HAVE

64
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,505
TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE A RULE OF

65
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,774
LAW HAS TO BE FOREMOST IN THE

66
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,476
DEFENSE OF OUR GREAT REPUBLIC.

67
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,212
THIS IS THE GREATEST NATION ON

68
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,614
THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND I'M A

69
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,285
GREAT PATRIOT AND WE NEED TO

70
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,252
HAVE EYE CONVERSATION THE FAR

71
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,687
LEFT IS NOT WILLING TO HAVE AND

72
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,091
I THINK THE RULE OF LAW AND LAW

73
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,561
AND ORDER HAVE GOT TO TAKE

74
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:14,961
PRECEDENCE.

75
00:03:14,961 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Martha: PROFESSOR, I COMMEND
