QUESTION.

74
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:46,136
THEY WERE INTERESTED TO FIND OUT

75
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:44,705
WHAT HAPPENED AS ANY ONE ELSE.

76
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:41,441
WHAT THEY WILL ALSO LEARN IS

77
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:39,777
ADAM WANTED TO GO BACK 25 YEARS

78
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:37,512
AND ASK QUESTIONS OF WITNESSES

79
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:33,282
WHILE IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

80
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:30,385
THEN HE GOES AND GET NOTES FROM

81
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:27,322
THE BROTHERS AND DECIDES TO

82
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:24,492
OMINOUS SOUNDING RUSSIAN NAMES

83
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:22,427
THAT NONE OF THE WITNESSES HEARD

84
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:21,027
OF.

85
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:20,429
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE

86
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:19,897
TRANSPORTATIONS TO COME OUT AND

87
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:17,866
DEFEAT THE NARRATIVE THAT HE'S

88
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:12,437
THE ONLY ONE CONCERNED ABOUT

89
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:11,505
COLLUSION.

90
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:09,306
IF THERE WERE EVIDENCE ADAM

91
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:07,675
WOULD HAVE LEAKED IT A LONG TIME

92
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:06,009
AGO.

93
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:05,344
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE

94
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:04,745
TRANSPORTATIONS TO BECOME

95
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:03,212
PUBLIC.

96
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:01,181
>> THEY VOTED ON FRIDAY MORNING

97
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:00,616
TO DECLASSIFY THE

98
00:05:00,616 --> 00:04:58,150
TRANSPORTATIONS OF INTERVIEWS OF

99
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:56,186
MORE THEN 50 WITNESSES.

100
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:50,993
HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE GIVE THE

101
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:47,028
DOJ AND FBI THE BENEFIT OF THE

102
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:47,028
DOUBT.

103
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:45,731
YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR

104
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:39,337
DOCUMENTS FOR OVER A YEAR.

105
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:37,606
>> I'VE SEEN ALMOST EVERY

106
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:35,107
DOCUMENT THEY WILL ALLOW

107
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:35,107
CONGRESS TO SEE.

108
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:31,378
PAUL AND DEVIN HAVE BEEN GOOD

109
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:29,680
ABOUT LETTING ME GO TO THE

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:28,081
DEPARTMENT.

111
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:27,682
I USED TO WORK THERE.

112
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:26,984
I UNDERSTAND THE TENSION BETWEEN

113
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:24,819
THE BRANCHES.

114
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:22,254
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

115
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:19,524
THINK BACK TO THE COMBY MEMOS.

116
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:17,692
ONLY TWO OF US COULD READ THEM

117
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:15,327
AND COULDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM.

118
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:14,896
THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW

119
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:11,031
THEY ARE IN EVERY MAJOR NEWS

120
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:09,400
PAPER AND YOU WONDER, WHY

121
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:07,636
COULDN'T I READ THIS SIX MONTHS

122
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:07,636
AGO.

123
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:04,639
I WONDER IF THIS IS TRUE WITH

124
00:04:04,639 --> 00:03:58,244
THE MCCABE MEMOS.

125
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:55,081
I THINK WHAT MY FELLOW CITIZENS

126
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:53,183
WILL SEE THE DEPARTMENT AND

127
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:50,286
BUREAU HIDE BEHIND AN ONGOING

128
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:49,287
CRIMINAL PROBE BECAUSE THEY

129
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:47,589
DON'T WANT US TO SEE THINGS THAT

130
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:45,658
ARE EMBARRASSING FOR THEM.

131
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:43,226
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

132
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:41,695
THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO

133
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:38,531
WITHSTAND A FEW BAD ACTORS.

134
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:35,435
I'VE WORKED WITH THEM FOR 20

135
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:35,435
YEARS.

136
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:32,204
THERE ARE 1,000 PEOPLE YOU WOULD

137
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:31,339
LOVE.

138
00:03:31,339 --> 00:00:03,754
>> PETER HAD HIS HAND ON THE

139
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:04,322
>>> I'M BACK WITH THE

140
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:04,722
CONGRESSMAN.

141
00:00:04,722 --> 00:00:07,191
I ASKED YOU THIS QUESTION BEFORE

142
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:10,261
WE WENT TO BREAK AND THAT WAS OF

143
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:10,728
ACCOUNTABILITY.

144
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:11,829
WE UNDERSTAND THEIR HAVE BEEN A

145
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:14,031
LOT OF LEAKS TO THE MEDIA AND

146
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,934
THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW, IS IT

147
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:17,501
NOT?

148
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,270
>> I WOULD LIKE YOUR VIEWERS TO

149
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,872
THINK ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT

150
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:22,340
TRACKS.

151
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,943
THEY HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF

152
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,478
PRIVACY.

153
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:30,314
THAT'S NOT CRIMINAL BUT A MORAL

154
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:30,615
ISSUE.

155
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:41,392
THE LEGAL ISSUE IS WHEN YOU

156
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:45,162
DIS -- LEAK INFORMATION.

157
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:47,465
THE OTHER IS WHAT LINDSEY

158
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:48,165
REFERRED TO.

159
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,267
WHEN YOU TELL A WITNESS, LIKE

160
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,637
HOPE HICKS, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT

161
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:55,473
THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED YOU.

162
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,341
WHILE HER INTERVIEW WAS GOING ON

163
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:59,110
THE DEMOCRATS WERE COORDINATING

164
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,645
WITH THE MEDIA.

165
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:03,047
SELECTING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF

166
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,782
HER TESTIMONY AND LEAKING IT.

167
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:07,118
IT'S NOT A CRIMINAL ISSUE BE YOU

168
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:08,119
MORAL ISSUE.

169
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,754
IT DESTROYS TRUST.

170
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:11,589
IT'S WHY CONGRESS IS BROKEN.

171
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:13,057
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD GO

172
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:14,358
TO JAIL FOR.

173
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:19,697
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT LEAKING BY

174
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:20,464
COMBY.

175
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:23,834
I'M TALKING ABOUT SHIFT WHO

176
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,336
LEAKED INFORMS TO THE NEW YORK

177
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,338
TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST.

178
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:31,142
>> IT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED.

179
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:35,713
CONGRESS DOESN'T INVESTIGATE

180
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:36,147
CRIME.

181
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:39,784
LEAKING IS MORAL.

182
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:40,985
DISPENSING CLASSIFIED

183
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,587
INFORMATION IS A CRIME.

184
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:45,323
CONGRESS DOESN'T INVESTIGATE,

185
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:48,392
PROSECUTE SENATES FOR CRIMINAL

186
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:49,093
ACTIVITY.

187
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,628
>> WILL WE SEE ACCOUNTABILITY IN

188
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:51,629
ALL OF THIS.

189
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:56,000
YOU HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THE

190
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,270
INVESTIGATORS FOR A WHILE NOW.

191
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,274
THERE WERE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE

192
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:04,375
THAT DID SOMETHING WRONG.

193
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,945
TELL US WHERE YOU SEE THIS

194
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:08,579
GOING?

195
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:10,281
>> THERE HAS BEEN SOME

196
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:10,747
ACCOUNTABILITY.

197
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:11,783
THERE IS MORE TO COME.

198
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,818
I THINK OF THE TEN PEOPLE

199
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:16,421
INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA PROBE.

200
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:19,123
80% OF THEM ARE NO LONGER WITH

201
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:21,426
THE DEPARTMENT OR BUREAU.

202
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:24,729
YOU MENTION MCCABE, COMBY IS

203
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,566
GONE, JIM BAKER IS GONE.

204
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,636
THERE HAS BEEN SOME

205
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:32,103
ACCOUNTABILITY.

206
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:34,405
I THINK THERE WOULD BE MORE IF

207
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,307
THE DEMOCRATS SPENT MORE TIME

208
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:39,344
WORKING WITH THEIR REPUBLICAN

209
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,212
COLLEAGUES AND MORE TIME WITH

210
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:42,547
MEDIA LEAKS.

211
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:44,549
THAT'S MY FLUSTRATION.

212
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:47,051
THE DEPARTMENT BELONGS TO ALL OF

213
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:47,752
US.

214
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:49,521
DEMOCRATS ALIKE WOULDEN LIKE

215
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:51,690
BIAS FBI AGENTS.

216
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,325
WHO WALLED HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD

217
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:57,629
HAVE TAKEN PETER TO FIND A LAW

218
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,397
ENFORCEMENT AGENT THEY LIKED.

219
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:01,533
ALL OF THE TIMES THEY ARE

220
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,969
CRITICAL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

221
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:06,705
DEFEND ONE OF THE MOST BIAS

222
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:08,707
AGENTS IN PUBLIC SERVICE.

223
00:03:08,707 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AND WHY I
