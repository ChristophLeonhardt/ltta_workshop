00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
hi everyone there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I want</font>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,120
to talk about it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly briefly today</font>

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,700
the first one is big downer so please

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,529
stick with me through that as those of

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:08,970
you who follow me on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter may know</font>

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,740
I've been extremely concerned especially

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,599
today with the lack of awareness there

8
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,920
seems to be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the severity of the</font>

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,109
situation in Libya Libya is located in

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,150
North Africa to its east as Egypt to its

11
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,720
West Algeria and Tunisia so it's part of

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,010
that region of North Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

13
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,480
Middle East<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been hit very heavily</font>

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,300
by protests and uprisings and

15
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,109
revolutions and all those sorts of

16
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,640
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd really like to make a full</font>

recent developments kind of informative

19
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,800
including the really horrible reports

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,719
that the Libyan military started firing

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,910
on protesters from planes and also our

supporting Colonel Gaddafi 99.999% all

26
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,070
because of oil interests unfortunately

27
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,480
right now I'm right in the middle of

28
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,070
writing midterm papers and haven't yet

29
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,480
had the chance to properly do all the

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,039
research that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do before I feel</font>

31
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable making and uploading a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">can't do that unless I have all my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facts</font>

accounts all that sort of thing about

39
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,909
the situation so you can find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in your free time please know</font>

41
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,509
that all these sources will have a bias

42
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,920
but that doesn't of course mean that we

43
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,540
should discount the sources of what they

44
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,280
have to say because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sources have a</font>

45
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,930
bias if someone found me an unbiased

46
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,310
source I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them hundreds of</font>

thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of books as a galaxy chocolate</font>

48
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,790
at the highest honor there literally is

49
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,740
no source that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not have some bias</font>

of some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah this whole this is</font>
