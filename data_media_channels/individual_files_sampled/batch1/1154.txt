now electric carmaker Tesla has a value of between 60 and 70 billion dollars it's been trading as a public company for eight years but it has never made an annual profit Elon Musk's vision of integrating clean energy with transport and home power some might say is the perfect marriage but it's Tesla on the cusp of profitability or is this a bubble or joining us now from London is Irish masu Deanna she is the corporate finance and deals editor at the Financial Times in London thanks very much for being with us so first off what is the latest that you're hearing on the company possibly going private obviously mr. musk has been tweeting about this and then it's caused quite a ripple in in the financial community but what exactly is going on well so I think we should probably start at the beginning which was a story that I broke with the Financial Times that the Saudi sovereign wealth fund had secretly kind of quietly built a about a 4.5 4.6 percent stake in Tesla we broke that story roughly two weeks ago and it sparked a chain of events which has led us to where we are now 30 minutes after our story broke Elon Musk took to Twitter and said he was considering taking Tesla private at a 20% premium or so to where the stock was trading saying he had the quote-unquote funding secured and that basically Unleashed this chain of events which is roughly as far as I can tell unprecedented in terms of corporate finance and and takeover battles in history where a CEO takes the social media and amplifies another organisation story and basically uses it to really change the narrative around this company so where we are at the end of these two weeks is really not much further than what we started because musk may have taken some actions which violated SEC policy Securities and Exchange Commission policies which have sparked a series of investigations into his actions and as a result also left him scrambling to put together this plan and make it look like there was actually more meat than there was on the boat and so at the moment banks are all running around trying to figure out whether they want to even work with him on this because it's such a while wild idea and proposal and seems seemingly unrealistic and at the same time not wanting to miss out on potentially the largest leveraged buyout in history and on the all-important question of profitability which in which we mentioned at the top there when do you think it might turn a profit I mean there's no indication that Tesla will turn a profit anytime soon it's burning cash at a phenomenal rate it can barely produce a couple thousand cars a year it can't keep up with demand from consumers and so there's no sign of profitability in the foreseeable future and then you hear read constant stories about problems with the cars problems with deliveries it's sort of endless stream of negative news but what keeps this company going and what keeps the belief of investors there is the sort of cultish icon of Elon Musk where he can captivate the market and to seeing his vision and he just dreams big we're in a world where you know as one person wrote Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are creating these really micro startups that really have no real no real direction but will create sort of very profitable companies for their enterprise and some sort of back office software well you know must doesn't do that Elon Musk sets up sets visionary ideas out and says I'm gonna change the way transportation works I'm gonna change the way energy works and then he lays out these really attractive narratives which obviously in a world where there's a bunch of small ideas we all want big ideas and so that can captivate the market and investors who are willing to back an entrepreneur but the the facts and the details when you dig into them present a much murkier picture and that's why so many people have bet against Tesla's stock it's the most bet it one of the most bet against stocks in the US market and there's a lot of people who expect this company to come crashing down and a bet a lot of money against him yeah well that gets my next question then is this really sustainable I mean if you talk there a lot about the negative side of this the money they're spending there's problems with supply lines and all is this a bubble that's gonna burst well I mean it's it's sort of a Tesla story as part of our story of where we are in the world right now there's so many different bubbles that were in we're in a real estate bubble were in a technology bubble and Tesla sort of in caps and capsule AIT's one of these bubbles now the way that they can get through this is if they actually just focus on building cars and delivering and meeting their demand and that is clearly the best way to run this company if he can meet the thousands of supply orders that he's already registered and could deliver those cars to consume then you can see if a foreseeable run rate for Tesla to survive but this is a company that produces a fraction of what Ford GM etc.etc produce on an annual basis and yet has a higher market value and at some point reality will catch up if must can't deliver why would Elan musk want to bring the company into into private hands like what would be his motivation for that well again that that feeds into one of the themes of our time which is that the markets are extremely short-term oriented right investors want returns they want profits if you think about all the activist investors who are squeezing pennies out of companies and torturing CEOs for for more capital returned a more aggressive action that we're sort of in this rampant environment where hedge funds and portfolio managers are demanding maximum amounts of stuff from big companies and oftentimes is very hard to deliver and you couple that with someone with the ego of Elon Musk which must be among the top top five biggest in the business world based on his behavior on Twitter that's only rational calculation one can make you can see how that would be deeply offensive to someone and you can see through his actions that it's almost a personal vendetta that he wants to burn the short sellers and prove them wrong and so this this has created an incredible distraction around him his company in himself where he's not focusing on the execution so I think part of his argument is if I can get this company private then I don't have to deal with these massive distractions and I can focus on doing that problem is that it's really cute to want that but also you relied on the public markets to get to where you are you didn't magically become a 60 billion dollar company without having sold things to our investors and sold things to the public and so to then say actually public be damned is a bit of a hypocrisy in its own sense so there's a lot of lot of questions here that are still remain unanswered one other major topic that is is relevant here as the corporate governance around Tesla the board includes his brother his it's quote-unquote lead independent director is someone who's been named in court filings as his close friend this is basically a mockery to corporate governance the Tesla Board and therefore that's another big issue that's under examination now how can the US company have such a captured board that is close to the CEO and the board is very much on trial right now so the last two weeks have really been a story about the board and the special committee of the board desperately to maintain some semblance of independence so they don't get sued to death what would the implications be for Tesla shareholders if there's a private buyout both institutional and individual shareholders took us through what's involved for them there well so in a traditional sense if you don't want to take a public company private the easiest way to do that is a quote unquote leveraged buyout where you take a slice of equity and a bunch of borrowings you saddle the company up you offer a premium to the share price and then everyone gets the premium and sells our shares and then you take the company private with your new ownership team unfortunately that only works when you have a cash flow positive company because creditors don't want to lend you money if you're burning through money and you have no capacity to pay back the money so to basically launch the world's biggest leveraged buyout in history is impossible here and therefore none of the world's major banks will participate in such a plan because Tesla doesn't have the capacity to repay its debts it's burning through cash as we've established so then you have to find another way and so the idea that they're discussing this quote-unquote going dark philosophy where a small group of shareholders will buy out other shareholders and take the company private with minimal equity checks which is why everyone got excited about the way musk spun the Saudi line that we broke but unfortunately my reporting suggests that the Saudis have no intention of sort of funding an extra you know five ten fifteen billion dollars to take the company private and if they had discussions it was very very informal and not of the nature and development that musk might have suggested through his tweets and his subsequent communications to the market just to pick up on the on the Saudi connection why why would the Saudis want to finance Tesla's exit from from the stock market then well what's in it for them well no discussion about Saudi Arabia can take place these days without discussion of the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the sort of garius 32 year old who's leading the country trying to transform its economy and the vehicle through which he's doing that and to take the company's reliance off of oil is the Saudi sovereign wealth fund which is called the public investment fund it has about two hundred fifty billion dollars in assets he wants to grow it to 400 billion over by 2020 he wants 25 percent of those assets to be in overseas holdings and that's why and he's clearly a guy who was attracted by people who have big ideas who are trying to really change industries that's why they went and invested 3.5 billion dollars in uber that's why they gave forty five billion dollars to Japan Softbank and Masayoshi Son to have this incredibly large tech investment fund which everyone has been talking about for the last two years it's why he's put a billion dollars in Virgin Galactic with Richard Branson it's why he's put up to twenty billion dollars with Steve Schwarzman and Blackstone and this is very much in line with those bets a big entrepreneur trying to change an industry potentially even a hedge to Saudi Arabia's oil based economy and by investing in electric cars and with Elon Musk and the way I reported the story was to say that when Mohammed bin Salman went to the US in March and April of this year he in Tesla soon after a bus he in the Saudi sovereign wealth fund soon after approached Tesla and said we'd be interested in buying new newly issued shares to both help support your company but also we'd like to be an investor and musk for whatever reason did not accept that offer and so the Saudis with the help of JP Morgan Chase built the stake in the Tesla stock in the subsequent weeks and months and it was private until I broke the story Irish Masoud II good to speak with you thanks
