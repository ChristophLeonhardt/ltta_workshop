Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland joins me now senator it's good to see you I want to start out by playing a little bit of an inner of your interview your colleague senator Cantwell did with Chuck Todd over the weekend about just how important this votes gonna be for Democrats take a look and we'll talk about it I think that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that this vote could be a one of the key votes of their entire career and they know that no matter what spin comes out of the White House if they vote for somebody who's going to change precedent it could be a career-ending move senator Cardin do you agree with that assessment if you're a Democrat and you vote no on whoever this pick is do you risk ending your career in the Democratic Party I think senator Cantwell is absolutely right as to the consequences of this nomination the president's looking at a list prepared by outside groups with the intention of changing the precedent of the court particularly as it relates to women's right and right of choice roe v wade so I think this is an extremely important vote but for each United States Senator we need to understand that we're talking about changing the direction of the Supreme Court the next generation so yes I am concerned that the list the president's working on it's been prepared by an outside group with an intended result senator can you take us behind the scenes of the Democratic policy lunches this has clearly been a difficult issue to grapple with how to fight this nomination you run the gamut from liberals like Cory Booker Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris many people who a lot of us assume we're gonna run for president in 2022 Joe Manchin Heidi Heitkamp Joe Donnelly all people who are at risk and up for re-election coming up in November that have a very different set of a very different focus how much anger do you think would be directed at your red state colleagues were they to vote Yes to confirm this nominee well first let me point out that let's see who the president nominates but if he follows the path that he is looks like he is going it's a predetermined course here and I would think that all senators would be concerned about having someone appointed to the Supreme Court that basically has already made up his or her mind to reverse the precedent of the Supreme Court particularly as it relates to roe v wade and women's right of choice but in many other issues we were concerned about it we have the the protection under the affordable care act on pre-existing conditions we're very concerned that this nominee may be selected with the intent of reversing the Affordable Care Act protections so it looks like the president is trying to appoint someone with an agenda on the court and I would hope that all my senators all my colleagues would be very concerned about that course not just the senators who come from so-called red states but I would hope that all senators be concerned about this senator dick durbin the Democratic number two in the Senate he said acknowledged really that Democrats are powerless in the Senate to stop this from going forward because you simply don't have the votes there are some in the liberal base who reacted very angrily to that essentially saying that that was throwing in the towel how far should Democrats go to fight this I expect that we'll use every tool at our disposal to first be able to highlight what the nominee stands for use our opportunities to interview use our opportunities to make sure that the American people understand what this nominee is all about will do do that there's things that we can do but clearly the 51 votes is going to be the key number on the confirmation of this nominee yes Senator McConnell is hypocritical he said of course under President Obama that 11 months was not long enough for an election to take up a nominee now the Republicans are going to do this in just a few months that's wrong it's hypocritical but we need to use every opportunity we can so the Americans know what's at stake and what's at stake are their constitutional rights the protection against the abuses of power by the president by Congress by by corporate America and reversing the long-standing precedents of the Supreme Court to that point about the delay one of your colleagues senator Cory Booker has argued that part of the reason why this this should be delayed is because of Robert Muller's ongoing investigation do you think that that's an argument Democrats should be making loudly as this process unfolds I think our first point is going to be the consequences of this nominee for your rights that to me that's the most important thing is is is the rights that are going to be jeopardized by a pointing or a person has an agenda to reverse the precedents of the court but there's clearly an issue here of Senator McConnell being very hypocritical in the manner in which he is proceeding when he denied President Obama his selection on the Supreme Court I think senator Booker's points about all the other issues are certainly points that need to be considered senator I mean I take your point on on Mitch McConnell but Democrats were the ones who started chipping away at the process that used to require 60 votes for Circuit Court judges and for Supreme Court nominees do you regret what Democrats did under Harry Reid when they removed that circuit court filibuster threshold it was part of a process by Senator McConnell to deny President Obama the opportunity for his judges to be voted on fairly before the United States Senate the Republicans were holding up any nomination to the circuit court for the district that was wrong they were abusing their power we got to get back to comedy in this country we need to point judges who will follow the law that will be mainstream judges that's what we need to have not just on the Supreme Court but on our Court of Appeals and on our district court and clearly a president Trump is moving away from that so we've got to use every opportunity we can to make the American people understand this is about their rights this is about a president trying to get a court that will just ratify everything that he does whether it's immigration policies health care policies or consumer jeopardizing consumer rights jeopardizing labor rights he wants a court that will just rubber stamp his agenda that's not what the courts are abouts an independent branch of government that follows the precedent of previous decisions and Ben on the constitutional rights of the American citizens president Trump's trying to reverse that and that's why this particular nominee to the Supreme Court is so critically important hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked
