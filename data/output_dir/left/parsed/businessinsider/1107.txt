this was the largest audience to ever
witness an inauguration period both in
person and around the globe even the New
York Times printed a photographer de
Graaff showing the that a
misrepresentation of the crowd and the

existed these attempts to lessen the
enthusiasm of the inauguration are
shameful and wrong
