00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
hi friends so everyone loves a good

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,770
Martin Luther King jr. quote right you

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,270
know how he said that hate cannot drive

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,900
out hate only love can do that well I'd

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,960
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> propose a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> small revision that</font>

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,289
hate cannot drive out hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> only lock and</font>

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,600
do that see while it's important that we

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,250
each work every day to create a more

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,970
loving tolerant and equitable world

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,740
sometimes it just takes justice that

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,470
rolls down like water and a justice

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,439
system that drags us into equality

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,540
kicking and screaming though we may be

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,730
and that's where the Southern Poverty

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,010
Law Center comes in one part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the work</font>

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,629
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defend victims of discrimination</font>

17
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,570
and hate in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal system in the past</font>

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,420
they've filed lawsuits like in 1977 case

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,460
that allowed women to serve as law

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,280
enforcement officers and receive the

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,680
same benefits as mail service members or

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,620
the 1987 case that shut down the chapter

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,660
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Ku Klux Klan that was responsible</font>

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the sixteenth street baptist church</font>

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,710
bombing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the one that killed</font>

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">those four little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> girls in 1963 or more</font>

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,990
recently they fought for criminal

28
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">justice reform to keep children and</font>

29
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,850
teens with minor<font color="#E5E5E5"> offenses out of adult</font>

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,310
prisons they've worked to end conversion

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,549
therapy on LGBT students they've stood

32
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,650
up to predatory payday<font color="#E5E5E5"> lenders who</font>

33
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,570
target low-income communities and

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,159
they've fought against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the abuse and</font>

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,140
exploitation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> immigrants and guest</font>

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,380
workers just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to name a few so many of</font>

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,119
the civil<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights and protections that we</font>

38
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,329
enjoy today exists because of landmark

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,490
court cases that organizations like the

40
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">SPLC bring up but here's the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
they understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> takes more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">equality in the eyes of the law to</font>

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
create equality in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world so</font>

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,100
in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to representing people</font>

45
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,270
who've been discriminated against

46
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,030
they're also actively working to cut off

47
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,420
hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and bigotry before it starts for</font>

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,180
one they monitor over 1,600 hate and

49
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,759
extremist groups in the u.s. providing

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,860
intelligence and training to law

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,170
enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and media</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep hate</font>

52
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,150
motivated violence in check

53
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,590
I think my favorite thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they do</font>

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,869
is provide educational resources to

55
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,700
schools so that we can teach the next

56
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,410
generation to be more tolerant and

57
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,660
inclusive and challenge those

58
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,670
unconscious biases before they're fully

59
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,220
formed now my guess is that you know at

60
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,000
least one person who's LGBT a person of

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">color an immigrant or a child of an</font>

62
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,710
immigrant or has lived paycheck to

63
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,840
paycheck or any combination of those

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and as we are all painfully aware</font>

65
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,030
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these groups face more</font>

66
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,890
discrimination than other people and

67
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,709
it's more important than<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever for us to</font>

68
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,630
stand up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that's not who we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

69
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,120
we don't accept that the Southern

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,070
Poverty Law Center is working for love

71
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,740
and kindness every day and so should we
