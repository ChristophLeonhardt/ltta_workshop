okay let's bring out the editor-at-large of daily mail calm and also presented on good morning Britain Piers Morgan appears I want to talk to you about your interview with the president United States about his meeting with Vladimir Putin also about all the the great dynamics right now that actually you're going to impact the United States Britain Russia and the world but first let's talk about important things I know you are extraordinarily grumping when it comes to following your favorite football teams Arsenal loses a game in August and you say this season is over I know all Brits are incredibly grumpy about England but I've got bad news for you this young England team if you look at what they did at the World Cup if you look at their u-20 team u-17 team I'm predicting you guys are gonna be in the top four next time and may even win the whole thing how do you out grump that by the way no I think it's a very good World Cup falling the bigges expectation levels were so low you know we haven't won the World Cup since I was 10 months old so to actually have a team that got to the semi-finals that actually played I think with great spirit with great quality and actually behaved themselves on and off the pitch that was the most remarkable thing we also have a manager who appears to actually know what he's doing so all in all my grunt levels are quite low mr. Scarborough we're very good now you can really focus on Arsenal and how the season's over before it even begins but let's talk about your interview with a president and we'll skip over first of all the fact that the president was absolutely fascinated that there's so many different names for the realm what was your take away in your interview with Donald Trump you know it seems to me because he came in like a bull in a china shop as he does and he threw things up in the air but actually despite all the protests and despite all the you know was he rude and so on debate about him doing this to Theresa May with the big interview that he gave when I got to mine she felt that he wasn't entirely wrong in saying it was a successful trip and I'll tell you why this country makes you guys at the moment like a a calm oasis or beautiful serenity we are in complete political meltdown over brixon over our decision to leave the European Union and one of the key parts of this debate right now here is whether at the end of this process when we actually leave the Union we will be free to trade with allies like America and the American deal could be the biggest deal that we do and tourism has come out our prime minister with his big plan the grandiose plan that she says allows that most of her critics here even some supporters say it doesn't Boris Johnson quit the brig's exchange secretary quit and so Trump comes in he throws it all up he says look I'm told she can't leave business with us so the deal may be off cue complete mayhem then she gets together with him for two days and out of that I then interviewed more Air Force One and he says to me look she's given me reassurances that she can do a deal with the United States after breaks it happens now I don't happen to think that she's telling him the truth I don't think that we are free under her current plan to do that and it's so fundamentally important Joe because ultimately the future and success of brakes it may depend entirely on that ability to trade freely with countries outside of the European Union right it's um hi piers it's Kathy here and and as you know we've already had a couple of Conservative MPs who have said look since what Donald Trump said about that US UK trade relationship maybe they're going to rethink whether they can support the government's plan on brexit I think one of the things that was interesting about your interview we've been speaking a lot about his relationship with President Putin and the importance that Donald Trump attaches to personal relationships as opposed to perhaps strategy or policy he almost said the same thing about meeting the Queen that there was a very good feeling and they had a really really good relationship during the course of that meeting to what extent do you think he goes into these meetings and obviously not with the Queen but with President Putin with a clear strategy in policy in mind or is it all about feeling and personal relationships with him I think it's predominantly about feeling in personal relationships I think he's done it his entire life and career you know in real estate he did business by getting in the room of people often that he couldn't he could stand but he thought it was good for business to just try and get on with people you know he said to me I said to me is there a kind of Trump doctrine developing on the world stage which is you getting into the rooms with bad guys whether it's Kim jong-un Vladimir Putin America's traditional enemies and actually trying to do business with them are you in the new Churchill philosophy of George or is better than war war is that what you now believe in and he said mister you think it said look when I when I won he said everyone assumed I'd be at war pretty quickly with somebody and let's be honest I think most people have that concern the fact that Trump is actually getting in the room with people like Kim jong-un and building a relationship the fact he's gone to see Putin and feels the same way that if they get in a room they can sort stuff out you know I had to say from the wider global point of view I'm just happy if America and Russia and America North Korea and not a war so let's start from that position of a good position which is then not at war you know in the end the proof will be in the pudding as we say over here can he achieve a lasting peaceful and mutually beneficial relationship between the United States and some of their more conventional historic enemies and I think in the end that will be it'll be down to trump down to Putin down to Kim jong-un but at the moment I I'm happier they're talking and not shooting missiles at each other here's at Richard Haass you're you describe British politics and something of a meltdown well this morning's news suggests exactly that and it's not clear that what the Prime Minister wants to do with brexit she's got the support for so we talked a little bit about it and whether essentially this government now comes undone and that even brags it gets revisited because it's it's at least as an outsider across the ocean I don't take it any longer as a given that were the only question is the details but whether it begs it itself now is up for grabs well here's the fundamental problem with brexit so seventeen point four million people in Britain voted to leave European Union but the person in charge of driving the train to destination post European Union is to resume the prime minister who voted to remain in the Union she does not believe in this she doesn't what brings it to happen so predictably because she doesn't want it to happen she is trying to please everybody by making it as watered-down and present as is humanly possible and of course all that's achieving is deeply distressing the brig's of Tears we want a clean hard briggsie which means we've actually left completely and all the remains like her who actually want us to try and stay part of the same Club we've been a member of without actually having full membership I don't think she's pleasing anybody for that reason I think that her position is becoming extremely perilous and I've always thought about this I voted remain myself cards on the table I don't want us to leave European Union but the majority of people in this country did in a free and democratic referendum called by the prime minister of the time David Cameron and we have to respect the democratic process a bit like I say in America with Trump you may be absolutely enraged that he won and beat Hillary Clinton but he won and he beat Hillary Clinton and you know like in football as we discussed earlier Joe you don't just replay a game you know because you lost you know Croatia can't replay the World Cup file because France one of them and so we have to get to a place now where we try and somehow get through this on pass where nobody in Parliament actually thinks that any vote at all is possible that will approve any form of brexit I personally think the only way this ever gets worked out is that you put the brig's of tiers in charge of the Train you put the people in the driver's room who actually ideologically want this to happen the Boris Johnson's the Michel goes the David Davis's the Jacob Riis mogs all these people actually believe in it they believe Britain will be fundamentally a better country and more prosperous country if we are out of the EU so let's put them in charge and stop pretending that somebody who doesn't believe in it actually can drive this through all right Piers
