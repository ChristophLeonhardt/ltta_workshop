00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,600
has been very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> height it's not out</font>

already started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appear in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,660
kind of book sections of magazines such

10
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,369
as glamour and like the one to look out

11
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,750
for and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know a lot of people are</font>

12
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,189
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> advance review copies as well</font>

13
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,779
like they've really push<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early</font>

14
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,789
influence side of marketing the force is

15
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,560
strong on this one I have to say my

16
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,060
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the force is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not strong we</font>

17
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,680
have a somewhat different opinion of the

18
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,510
book from all the reviewers and people

19
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,159
who are pushing it this early<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but</font>

20
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,899
I'll get into that in a second the boy

21
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,280
sees in a set in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relatively near</font>

22
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,890
future in London it offers an alternate

23
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,629
history over the last 200 years or so

24
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,190
leading<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to the present day where we</font>

25
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,200
meet Paige clairvoyance<font color="#CCCCCC"> see has been</font>

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,789
outlawed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that basically means that</font>

27
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone who has a relationship with the</font>

28
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,930
ether or the supernatural and anyway

29
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,700
whether that's card reading will be able

30
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell the future that sort of thing be</font>

31
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind outlaw a person obviously these</font>

32
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,190
people aren't all going to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font>

33
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">away from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their home so what's happened</font>

34
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,190
is that all these syndicates all these

35
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,960
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crime gangs have formed instead</font>

36
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
and Paige is part of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those it's</font>

37
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,379
hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say too much without spoiling</font>

38
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,119
some of the early surprises of the book

39
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,680
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> less to say that page is extremely</font>

40
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,540
capable very selfish short which is

41
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,939
refreshing i have to say from is a super

42
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,229
natural talent which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't really</font>

43
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,479
understand at first I guess cost her a

44
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,420
lot of her like general vitality she

45
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">always wakes up and has to be on oxygen</font>

46
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,869
on life support afterwards so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

47
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all quite promising</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like having</font>

48
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">disturbing book set in London</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

49
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,340
it's familiar to me and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just cool</font>

50
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,990
to see people's interpretations of it in

51
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,310
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> so first I was really</font>

52
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,659
laughing it up but then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

53
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,890
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a point at which the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

54
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,540
establishment stopped and we sort of

55
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,520
hurtled forward with the story which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

56
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,960
fine like that doesn't doesn't have to

57
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,970
be all about the wild one thing i will

58
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,470
say that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout the sort of</font>

59
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,759
world establishment side of it was

60
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,799
definitely much more fatel than a show<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

61
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">do feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like there are opportunities for</font>

62
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,670
me the reader to experience the world

63
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,920
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> page as she's discovering it but</font>

64
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,210
there's opportunities were missed and

65
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,009
instead favored for like a sort of

66
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,920
historical<font color="#CCCCCC"> run down or or very like</font>

67
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,560
technical explanation and which was like

68
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,100
less good in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> view that's good yeah</font>

69
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,490
that's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> English degree view a bit less</font>

70
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,758
good anyway to page a situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some</font>

71
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,459
point quite early on changes to say the

72
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,620
least it becomes a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

73
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,080
a beauty in the beast story as this on

74
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beast a whole new politics to learn</font>

75
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,319
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

76
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,959
whether her life in this new community

77
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,239
is different from her life in her old

78
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">community again something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that should</font>

79
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,040
have been shown rather than told I mean

80
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,620
as a couple of suggestions of it towards

81
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end where it's like was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

82
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,519
different should have really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me</font>

83
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,200
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that conclusion I think maybe</font>

84
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,340
I'm putting too much faith in the reader

85
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,599
but I like putting faith in the reader

86
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,610
so I think subtle tea was kind of lucky

87
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,260
but i did also feel actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain new</font>

88
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,239
skills will discovered her use of her

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,099
own skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly it didn't really</font>

90
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,769
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of failure before being</font>

91
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,780
successful nothing happened on a much

92
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,280
smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> timescale then there was a point</font>

93
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,450
where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> leapt forward a few months</font>

94
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why it's the</font>

95
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,040
like book to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look out for but whatever</font>

96
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,109
like it's a fun it's a fun George get

97
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:01,849
into the side effect of when things are

98
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,799
hyped the question why they thought it

99
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,540
was sensible to latch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto this other</font>

100
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,280
book so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> while you're reading it as</font>

101
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,379
a person<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's reviewing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and as</font>

102
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,730
someone who's like looked all the

103
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,140
publicity materials to this but why'd

104
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,370
you have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> other book in your mind</font>

105
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,510
because there's so many things that

106
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,920
books like The Hunger<font color="#E5E5E5"> Games is just as</font>

107
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">smart as I was with the sequels saving</font>

108
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,150
things that that book does for the way

109
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,000
you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> society in communities</font>

110
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,220
and your personal role in it but I felt

111
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this didn't do it all and not doing</font>

112
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,459
it how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

113
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">you kind of align it with the Hunger</font>

114
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,970
Games and you were saying that it does a

115
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,250
similar thing and it immediately doesn't

116
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,930
do that immediately falls flat at that

117
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,340
hurdle and then there's apartment they

118
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,109
did get bit twilit and I did get annoyed

119
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,329
it like the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much older and</font>

120
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:44,269
very much younger dynamic I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

121
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:45,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> book that everyone was talking</font>

122
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,599
about but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't I don't often give</font>

123
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,739
bad reviews here because I prefer

124
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,329
talking about books that I liked but

125
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,910
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one is so hyped I felt like</font>

126
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,859
I should talk about another aspect of it

127
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the whole thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

128
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,169
seventh book series and obviously

129
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,699
because that's published by blue three

130
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,930
who thought which harry potter you kind

131
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,069
of can't help but feel they're trying to

132
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,480
find their next big thing which of

133
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,739
course the naturally tried to do because

134
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,150
how i push did the best thing for their

135
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,879
money that ever has but it's also made

136
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,970
been kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit lazier I dare</font>

137
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,280
to say in their kind of curation of the

138
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,199
young adult space anyway so not to make

139
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,849
this about how reported versus any other

140
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,168
book the thing I like about Harry Potter

141
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:19,608
is that even though it's a seven book

142
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,380
series each book is very much its own

143
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,630
complete story and you could read it in

144
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">isolation of this ends in a sort of</font>

145
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,560
cliffhanger but also doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel very</font>

146
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,660
complete I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

147
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,370
that could have been done better I feel

148
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">very strongly and I could be entirely</font>

149
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,180
wrong that good series books have to be

150
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,250
their own book in isolation like The

151
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,960
Hunger Games or Northern Lights of those

152
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,610
sorts of things maybe that's my favorite

153
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,530
probably is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> fave anyway I was sweet</font>

154
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,610
