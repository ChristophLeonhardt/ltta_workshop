00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,374
[music]

2
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,330
This is Zhang Zhejun.

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,299
Today, he’s making drugs.

4
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,300
He isn’t a chemist
or a dealer.

5
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,770
He’s making medicine
for his mother.

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,120
She has stage 3
lung cancer.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,300
Zhejun earns $300 a month,
but the medicine

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,600
needed to treat his
sick mother costs $2,000.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,550
Looking for options,
he turned online.

10
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:10,690
Today, he’s making WZ4002.

11
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,730
It hasn’t been approved
by Chinese or American

12
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,730
regulators, and it doesn’t
have a commercial name yet.

13
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,710
But he can still order
the raw ingredients

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,969
for drugs like this
online at a fraction

15
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,010
of their official prices.

16
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,640
The Communist Party
of China says

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,730
it provides close to universal
health care coverage.

18
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,580
Nearly 95 percent of people
are insured here,

19
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,950
including Zhejun’s mother.

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,710
So why is he making drugs on
the floor of his apartment

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,080
when his mother has insurance?

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,895
It’s a symptom of a
health care system in crisis.

23
00:01:58,232 --> 00:02:01,474
To understand this crisis,
we need to rewind a bit.

24
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,530
Under Mao Zedong,
the Communist state

25
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,790
provided free
health care for all.

26
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,300
Decades later, China adopted
a unique brand of capitalism

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,120
that transformed the country
from a poor farming nation

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,022
into an economic superpower.

29
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:27,900
Life expectancy soared.

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,950
But the introduction
of capitalism

31
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,260
and the retreat of the state
meant that health care

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,607
was no longer free.

33
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,515
Hospitals became
profit-driven.

34
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:36,946
And with limited
accountability,

35
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:40,290
they were widely accused
of predatory behavior.

36
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,300
A culture of mistrust
and inequality

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,960
now plagued the system.

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,190
Here’s what that looks like
today for ordinary Chinese.

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,590
It’s 5 a.m., and
about 100 people

40
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,070
have gathered in a line
in downtown Shanghai.

41
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,000
This isn’t the line to the
movies or a holiday sale.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,890
It’s the entrance to
the Shanghai Cancer Center

43
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,602
at Fudan University.

44
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,810
Those who were willing to
lose a night’s sleep trying

45
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,500
to get a spot in line now have
one question in their mind:

46
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,560
“Will I be able to
see a doctor today?”

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,950
The scalpers are
out, and they’re

48
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,560
selling spots in line.

49
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,980
China’s line scalpers
symbolize a

50
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,440
greater dysfunction.

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
The chance of seeing a doctor
here is directly related

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
to how big your wallet is.

53
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,210
Corruption is inherently
part of the system.

54
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,620
And in rural areas, it’s worse.

55
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,870
But leaving your home
in the countryside

56
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,120
could have a profound
impact on what type of care

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,010
you can get in the city.

58
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,959
Despite its rapid
modernization,

59
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,370
China still uses what is
known as the Hukou system.

60
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,500
Your Hukou is defined
by your birthplace,

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,390
and you’re only entitled
to social services

62
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,520
within that region.

63
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,870
Everything from the schools
your kids can go to,

64
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,230
to what your
health insurance will cover

65
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,380
is determined the
moment you are born.

66
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,200
So if you get cancer
and live in an area

67
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,880
without an oncologist,
you could be in trouble.

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,170
Some here compare it
to a caste system.

69
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,350
By 7 a.m., it’s one hour
before opening time.

70
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,750
The line has tripled in size,
and then the news hits.

71
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,690
Those are not good odds.

72
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,540
But even worse,
they aren’t unusual.

73
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,500
There are nearly 7,000 people
per general practitioner

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,480
in China.

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,169
To put this number
in perspective,

76
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,460
the World Health Organization’s

77
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,790
international standard is
one doctor for every 1,500

78
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,620
to 2,000 people.

79
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,930
General practitioners
we talked to in China

80
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,080
typically see 70 to 80
patients per day.

81
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,180
Specialists said
they see up to 200,

82
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,610
each just for
minutes at a time.

83
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,260
The doctors we
talked to in the U.S.

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,440
said they see fewer
than 30 patients a day.

85
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,820
While rich Chinese will
pay for individual care

86
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,690
or leave the country
altogether for it,

87
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,420
the rest of the population,
those dependent on

88
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,850
health insurance, end up
paying roughly 30 percent

89
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,350
of their health care costs.

90
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,880
Americans pay about 10.

91
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,820
Numbers like these have added
up to a culture of conflict.

92
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,630
With more and more patients
and underpaid doctors,

93
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,580
violence has
become commonplace

94
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,957
in hospitals across China.

95
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,390
And with the state insurance
system not meeting

96
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,070
the rising costs of
treatments and drugs,

97
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,410
medical disputes
often play out

98
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,388
in public on the
hospital floor.

99
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,300
Violence in hospitals has
become so common in China,

100
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,420
there’s a word
for it — yi nao.

101
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,693
Roughly translated, it’s
medical disturbance.

102
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,710
Back at the Shanghai hospital,
it’s opening time.

103
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,190
Scalpers are making
a last effort

104
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,523
to sell off
doctors appointments

105
00:07:08,523 --> 00:07:10,990
they secured in advance.

106
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,740
Some that wouldn’t
wait, or couldn’t afford

107
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,720
the scalpers’ tickets,
try to cut in line

108
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
and are thrown out
by security guards.

109
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,670
Once in the hospital, patients
will stand in another line.

110
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,180
It’s the second, and
there are more to come.

111
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,550
They scan the board of
available specialists,

112
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,120
selecting one based on
their best self-diagnosis.

113
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,400
If they’re lucky,
the one they choose

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
will have time to see them.

115
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,420
For those who
choose wrong, the cycle

116
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,450
will begin again tomorrow.

117
00:07:46,450 --> 00:00:00,000
Others prefer to solve
their problems at home.
