AINSLEY: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN BOLTON JOINS US LIFE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE GOOD MORNING TO YOU. CONGRATULATIONS ON NEW POST. THANK YOU. AINSLEY: ASIDE FROM THEY WILL BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG AND YELLING DEATH TO AMERICA, WHY WAS THIS DECISION SO IMPORTANT. LOOK, IT'S NO SURPRISE IRAN DOESN'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE EXISTING IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WHY SHOULD THEY? THEY GOT A WONDERFUL DEAL FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. IN FACT, THEIR ONLY REGRET, I DON'T THINK THEY DIDN'T ASK OBAMA AND KERRY FOR MORE BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT. THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT FOCUSED ON WHY THE DEAL WAS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN HIS REMARKS YESTERDAY. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, IT WAS NOT IN AMERICA'S STRATEGIC INTEREST TO ENTER THE DEAL AND NOT IN OUR STRATEGIC INTEREST TO STAY IN THE DEAL. WE'RE OUT OF IT. WE ARE GOING TO REIMPOSE SANCTIONS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE. WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES. WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER OTHER OBJECTIONABLE ASPECTS OF IRAN'S BEHAVIOR AND TRY TO REDUCE THIS THREAT IN THE REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD. PETE: SIR, HAVE PETE: SIR, PAVE PETE: SIR, PROE PETE: SIR, PROBABLY SAW SOME OF THE REACTION FROM DEMOCRATS WHO THINK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT THE DEAL THE DEAL USED TO REPRESENT AND WHAT THIS MOVE MEANS NOW HERE IS WHAT A FEW DEMOCRATS SAID YESTERDAY. WE ARE GOING TO PUT IT UP ON SCREEN. BARACK OBAMA FORMER PRESIDENT SAID IT RISKS ERODING AMERICA'S CREDIBILITY. NANCY PELOSI SAID IT ENDANGERS GLOBAL SECURITY AND DEFIES COMPREHENSION. JOHN KERRY'S GOING BEHIND THIS ADMINISTRATION'S BACK AND TALKING TORE COUNTRIES SAYS IT BREAKS AMERICA'S WORD. MAKES A NUCLEAR IRAN MORE LIKELY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THESE CRITICS? 180 DEGREES WRONG. THIS DEAL WAS GIVING IRAN COVER TO GET TO THE OBJECTIVE FOR DECADES WHICH WAS MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IT WAS CONCEIVED WITH THE WRONG VIEW OF CONSEQUENCES FOR THE UNITED STATES AND IRAN. I MEAN, REALLY, IT RESTED ON THE NOTION IF WE COULD JUST RESOLVE THE NUCLEAR PROBLEM, IRAN'S BEHAVIOR WOULD CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE HAS TAKEN PLACE. IRAN'S BEHAVIOR HAS GOTTEN WORSE. IT'S BEEN MORE BELLIGERENT, MORE SUPPORTIVE OF TERRORISM AS WE CAN SEE FROM WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOW IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. STEVE: RIGHT NOW WE HAVE HEARD AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO COMMENT ON IT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT, BUT MIKE POMPEO IS IN NORTH KOREA AND IT IS EXPECTED HE IS GOING TO BE TRAVELING BACK VERY SHORTLY. COULD HAVE SOME SURPRISES BUT, SIR, A NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID THE MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA IS YOU CAN'T TRUST THE UNITED STATES. WE HAD A DEAL WITH IRAN AND THEY CAN'T TRUST US AND NEITHER SHOULD THE NORTH KOREANS. WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO THE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE SAYING THAT? THEY ARE COMPLETELY WRONG. WE HAD A ROTTEN DEAL WITH IRAN. AND JUST AS GEORGE W. BUSH WITHDREW FROM THE 1972 ABM TREATY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN AMERICA'S STRATEGIC INTEREST. THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE HERE. I THINK IT SENDS A VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA. WE'RE NOT IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM JUST TO GET A DEAL. WE'RE GOING TO GET THE RIGHT DEAL. AND WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA, WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT THEY DO WHAT THEY AGREED TO DO OVER 25 YEARS AGO. WHICH IS NOT ONLY NOT PURSUE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT GIVE UP URANIUM ENRICHMENT AND POLLUTE REPROCESSING. THE BACK END AND THE FRONT END OF THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE. THAT WAS THE EUROPEAN POSITION WITH RESPECT TO IRAN BACK IN THE DAY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT. SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE TO THESE NATIONS. THE SAMTIONS TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. THERE IS NO NEW BUSINESS ALLOWED UNDER THE TERMS PRESCRIBED FOR EXISTING CONTRACTS THEY THERE ARE WIND DOWN PROVISIONS THAT COME INTO EFFECT AND TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS WILL BE LAYING THOSE OUT IN MORE DETAIL. OBVIOUSLY OUR SANCTIONS HAVE ENORMOUS EFFECTED ON LICENSES ALREADY. IF F. AMERICAN COMPANIES CAN'T USE THOSE LICENSES TO SELL TO IRAN. NEITHER IS ANYBODY ELSE. WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING TO THE EUROPEANS. IN FACT, WHEN I LEAF HERE, I'M -M LEAVE HERE I'M GOING TO BE DOING A CONFERENCE WITH BRITAIN, FRANCE AND GERMANY TO WORK FORWARD ON. SO IDEAS PRESIDENT MACRON OF FRANCE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT. WE HAVE A LOT TO DO. WE SHARE THE COMMON OBJECTIVE. WE DON'T WANT IRAN WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. PETE: AS SECURITY ADVISOR HAVE YOU FRONT ROW SEAT. THE SCRAPPING IRAN DEAL TO THE PROSPECTS OF A SIT DOWN IN NORTH KOREA AND THEN THE MOVING OF THE EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM. WHAT IS IT ABOUT, AS HAVE YOU WATCHED THIS PRESIDENT, WHAT IS THE TRUMP DOCTRINE? WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS APPROACH THAT HAS CREATED THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHANGES? WELL, I THINK THE PRESIDENT FOLLOWS THE ADVICE OF HARRY TRUMAN AND DEAN APPEARENSON THAT HE NEGOTIATES FROM POSITIONS OF STRENGTH AND NOT POSITIONS OF WEAKNESS. HE BELIEVES IN PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING, HE CARRIES THROUGH ON IT I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE REAL CREDIBILITY COMES FROM. NOT FROM EXECUTING DEALS THAT DON'T ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY'RE DESIGNED TO. SO, I THINK THAT'S ONE REASON HE IS VERY OPTIMISTIC LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN. STEVE: MR. BOLTON, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DEMOCRATS THAT ARE UPSET THAT THE PRESIDENT PULLED THE PLUG ON THIS, EVEN THOUGH A NUMBER OF THEM, INCLUDING CHUCK SCHUMER BACK A COUPLE YEARS AGO VOTED AGAINST BARACK OBAMA'S IRAN NUKE PACKET. THEY WERE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. IT WAS A MISTAKE WHEN IT WAS FIRST AGREED TO AND IT
