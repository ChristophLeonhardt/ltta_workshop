GET RID OF THE NORTH KOREA NUKES IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. GREG IS LIVE IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. ALL RIGHT, TRACE. ALL RIGHT, TRACE. CHBLS OH HARD-HEADED THINKING ABOUT THE STATEMENTS MADE. FOR EXAMPLE, DENUCLEARIZATION, THAT HAS BEEN POINTED ABOUT AND PROMISED BY NORTH KOREA IN THE PAST AND NORTH KOREA HAS GONE BACK ON IT. ALSO, THE STATEMENT MADE ON FRIDAY, WAS PAINFULLY SHORT ON DETAILS. THE TIME FRAME, HOW THEY WOULD GET RID OF THE NUKES AND MISSILES AND WHAT COULD BE VERIFIED. TO THAT POINT A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING ABOUT THAT, INCLUDING THE OPPOSITION PARTY HERE TO PRESIDENT MOON WHO THINKS HE'S GETTING TOO CLOSE TO NORTH KOREA. EVEN AMONG THE SKEPTICS AND AFTER-GLOW OF THE SUMMIT THERE'S THE BROAD MAJORITY OPINION IS LET'S WAIT AND SEE AND HOPE. TRACE? Trace: YES, IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO, GREG, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, THERE WAS THE NAME CALLING AND NORTH KOREA WAS THREATENING THE U.S. AND TESTING MISSILES. THAT WAS JUST, WHAT, BACK IN THE LATTER PART OF LAST YEAR. ABSOLUTELY. THE IRONY OF THE SETTING, FOR EXAMPLE, ISN'T LOST ON ANYONE. THE PEACE HOUSE, THE PEACE TALKS IN PAN MOON JANG, THE JOINT SECURITY AREA, DMZ, LAST DECEMBER WAS A NASTY SHOOTOUT WITH THE NORTH KOREAN SOLDIER FLEEING HIS OWN ARMY, WE'VE SEEN THE BULLET HOLE WHERE HE WENT DOWN. THAT'S WHERE TWO LEADERS WERE WALKING AND TALKING TODAY. AS YOU KNOW, JUST LAST YEAR, WE WITNESSED MULTIPLE MISSILE LAUNCHES FROM NORTH KOREA, ALSO, THAT NUCLEAR TEST. CERTAINLY, A LOT OF TOUGH LANGUAGE ON THE U.S. SIDE, TOO. TRACE, IT IS EARLY SATURDAY MORNING HERE. I THINK WITH THE HEAD SPINNING AND ALL OF THE TALK AND ALL OF THE ACTION, I THINK SOUTH KOREA MAYBE IN THE REGION MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A WEEKEND OFF AND CHEW ON THIS THING AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. BACK TO YOU. Trace: AND, GREG, WE'LL HEAR COMMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENT ON NORTH KOREA IN ABOUT 45 SECONDS, I MIGHT CUT YOU OFF. WHILE I HAVE YOU STILL, I WANT TO GET A FEEL. THIS STILL HAS TO BE VERY HOPEFUL FOR THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH KREE, A IT HAS TO BUOY THEM. IT COULD FALL APART IN 10 MINUTES. BUT THEY HAVE TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. QUICKLY, GREG. ABSOLUTELY. THEY ARE THINKING THAT IT IS A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THEY WANT IT TO WORK. THEY A ARE HOPING FOR THE BEST. THEY LIVE IN SHADOW, NOT JUST OF THE NUCLEAR THREAT, THE MISSILES, BUT ALSO ARTILLERIES PLACED JUST ABOUT 30 MILES AWAY
