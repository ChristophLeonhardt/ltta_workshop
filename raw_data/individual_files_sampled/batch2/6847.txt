what North Korea keeps saying over and over again is that I mean they they do say publicly they will not negotiate away their nuclear weapons they say they want to be recognized as a nuclear state however they also say in every statement they make they want to us to end its hostile policy they use this term over and over again so in other words the United States if it wants to de-escalate the situation and end this crisis it needs to address North Korea's security concerns they're concerned that the u.s. you know is ready to invade them is ready to bomb them is ready to attack them and that's what all these you know military exercises are aimed at so you know I would say you know Sen sent Ellison or some high-level person to actually start talking to them but you have to start you have to begin with talks about what you are going to negotiate about but just come in there and like you know so at least there's some contact you know going back to this issue of not having a US ambassador in South Korea it's also it's also unfortunate that we don't I mean there's no reason not to have diplomatic relations with North Korea I mean you know we had diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union from 1933 on under under a you know a leader Stalin who was you know very oppressive leader I mean there's no reason not to have diplomatic relationships with countries that you you know you're fundamentally at odds with so it's a just so there's no contact between the u.s. I mean apparently there's been you know some minimal contact between the there's a there's a certain US ambassador at large was responsible Joseph Yuen who's responsible for talks with North Korea on the issue of human rights but he is actually you know he's this year he's met with North Korean officials several times in your couple times in Europe and then in New York where the North Koreans of a UN UN mission to the United Nations so so that would be my advice is you know I got six start talking to them I mean the longer this goes on the worse it gets and you know so you need to you need to know what what they're the United States need to hear directly from North Korea well what their concerns are what they want from the US in vice-versa
