1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,099
TODAY THE ATTY.

2
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:02,099
GEN.

3
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:03,099
JEFF

4
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:06,209
SESSIONS TESTIFIED, AND HE DID
HIS DAMNEDEST TO SAY AS LITTLE

5
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,419
AS POSSIBLE.

6
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:12,010
ALONG THE WAY HE
CRAFTED THIS VERY INTERESTING BS

7
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,290
LEGAL ARGUMENT FOR WHY HE DIDN'T
NEED TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS,

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,830
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT
ASSERTING OR HAVING DONALD TRUMP

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,320
ASSERT EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,070
THIS
HAPPENED OVER AND OVER

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,310
THROUGHOUT THE TESTIMONY, BUT WE

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,980
WILL START OFF WITH SESSIONS.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,980
WHAT

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,720
IS THE BASIS OF YOUR REFUSAL TO
ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS?

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,720
SEN.

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,980
CAN, THE PRESIDENT HAS
A CONSTITUTIONAL ñ

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,719
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT
ASSERTED IT.

18
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,510
YOU SAID YOU HAVE

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,940
THE POWER TO ASSERT POWER OF
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, SO WHAT IS

20
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,429
THE LEGAL BASIS FOR YOUR REFUSAL
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS?

21
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,479
I AM PROTECTING THE RIGHT OF
THE PRESIDENT TO ASSERT IT.

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,479
I

23
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,840
WILL ASSERT IF HE CHOOSES.

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,309
THERE
MAY BE OTHER PRIVILEGES THAT

25
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,559
COULD APPLY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE.

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,219
IT'S BOTH INFURIATING AND
FUNNY.

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,869
HE IS SAYING THAT HE IS

28
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:08,119
PROTECTING HIS RIGHT TO SOMEDAY

29
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,220
EVER ASSERTED.

30
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,829
WE ARE LED TO
BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T

31
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:13,509
KNOW THAT JUST SESSIONS WOULD BE

32
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:17,031
TESTIFYING TODAY, AND DIDN'T
KNOW THAT HE COULD EXIST ASSERT

33
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:19,320
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IF HE WANTED

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,939
TO. IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING?

35
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,720
I DON'T THINK SO.

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,729
AGAIN BEFORE THEY EVEN CAME
THEY WERE PREPARING FOR THIS.

37
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,719
KELLYANNE CONWAY BEFORE HE EVEN
CAME ON SAID SESSIONS IS WILLING

38
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,650
TO COOPERATE AND SHARE WHAT HE

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,650
KNOWS.

40
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,810
SO OF COURSE ARE YOU SURE
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW?

41
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,079
SO HE WILL

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,179
SAY WHAT WE CAN SAY AND NOT SAY.

43
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:52,640
THERE WERE REASONS BEHIND THIS

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,899
WHOLE TESTIMONY IN THE FIRST

45
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:54,979
PLACE.

46
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,990
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY

47
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,890
SAID ABOUT HIS WORRIES AND
ISSUES WITH JEFF SESSIONS

48
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,200
RECUSAL FROM THE RUSSIAN

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,940
INVESTIGATION, ALSO IF HE IS
RECUSED HOW MUCH OF A HAND HE

50
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,550
HAD IN THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY
BECAUSE AS THE PRESIDENT SAID HE

51
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,010
WAS FIRED BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION, THAT HE WASN'T,

52
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:33,270
AND THAT HE WAS, BUT THEN HE
WASN'T, BUT THEN AFTER HE WAS.

53
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,920
SO AS WE GO THROUGH THIS

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,370
REMEMBER THERE WAS A LOT OF
ANGLES.

55
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,580
LAST WEEK WHEN KAMALA

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,530
HARRIS WAS ASKING ABOUT HIS

57
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,910
ANGLES AND POTENTIAL ALLOWANCE
OF LETTING THE RUSSIAN

58
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,390
INVESTIGATION GO, THAT IS THE
REASON WHY THIS IS CULMINATED

59
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,390
TO WHERE WE ARE?

60
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,370
WE WILL TOUCH ON A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT ANGLES.

61
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,370
I WISH WE HAD

62
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,350
MORE WE COULD REVEAL.

63
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,330
WHEN YOU
COMBINE THE FACT THAT HE

64
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,850
APPARENTLY DOESN'T REMEMBER

65
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,740
ANYTHING ABOUT HIS LIFE WITH THE
FEW THINGS THAT HE DOES REMEMBER

66
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,920
HE IS SAYING HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT.

67
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
YOU GET ALMOST NO

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
INFORMATION.

69
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,450
I WANT YOU TO
CONSIDER WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

70
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,280
IF EVERYONE TESTIFYING BEFORE

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,960
CONGRESS OR BEFORE A SPECIAL
COUNSEL USED THIS ARGUMENT.

72
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
THAT

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,790
WE DON'T HAVE TO ASSERT
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE

74
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,050
SOMEDAY PERHAPS THE PRESIDENT

75
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,100
MIGHT WANT TO.

76
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,490
THAT IS COOL
BECAUSE THEN YOU GET ALL OF THE

77
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,560
BENEFITS OF EXERTING EXECUTIVE
PRIVILEGE WITHOUT HAVING THE

78
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,550
OBVIOUS SUSPICIOUS NATURE OF

79
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,550
THAT.

80
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,490
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING
TO WORK, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS

81
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,340
THAT IT IS WEIRD THAT HE REFUSES
TO REVEAL ANYTHING ABOUT HIS

82
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:52,600
CONVERSATIONS WITH DONALD TRUMP.

83
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,970
ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLY RELEVANT

84
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,970
QUESTIONS.

85
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,320
I WOULD SAY THE
REASONS SESSIONS WAS BROUGHT IN

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,270
IN THE FIRST PLACE ñ HE CAN'T
TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SOMEDAY

87
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,200
DONALD TRUMP MIGHT WANT TO USE
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.

88
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
THAT IS

89
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
ABSOLUTE BS, NONE OF THE

90
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,000
SENATORS WERE BUYING IT.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,480
I
LOOKED AT THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF

92
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,880
THIS AND INTERESTINGLY FOX NEWS,
BREITBART, NO MENTION OF THIS

93
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,200
WEIRD LEGAL STRATEGY IN THEIR

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
COVERAGE.

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,870
YOU NEED TO KNOW GOING
IN THAT IS THE MAIN IMPEDIMENT

96
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,910
TO US KNOWING MORE ABOUT WHAT IS
GOING ON.

97
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,910
THEY DON'T WANT TO

98
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,280
REVEAL ANYTHING, BUT THEY ALSO

99
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,010
KNOW HOW BAD IT WILL LOOK IF
THEY CHOOSE NOT TO UNDER THEIR

100
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,370
ACTUAL CONSTITUTIONAL ABILITIES.

101
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,660
I DID SEE HIS OPENING
STATEMENT.

102
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,030
JEFF SESSIONS ñ HE

103
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,380
ADMITTED THAT HE WAS IN A WAY
INVOLVED WITH THE RECOMMENDATION

104
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,040
TO FIRE JAMES COMEY.

105
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,910
HE SAID I
ADMIT IT, BUT JUST BECAUSE I

106
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,510
RECUSE MYSELF FROM A RUSSIAN
INVESTIGATION BECAUSE I WAS PART

107
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,460
OF THE CAMPAIGN, DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I AM NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE

108
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,850
INPUT ON THE FBI DIRECTOR
BECAUSE THERE ARE TONS OF

109
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,850
INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON.

110
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,020
AT
LEAST HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD A

111
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,590
PART IN THAT, BUT THEN HE HAD A

112
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:14,139
JUSTIFICATION 
FOR IT.

113
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,690
EXACTLY.

114
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,240
THE ISSUE OF WHETHER
JUST SESSIONS AND HIS RECUSAL IS

115
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,410
WORTH A DAMN WAS A BIG PART OF
AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF THE

116
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,740
TESTIMONY.

117
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,920
HE HAS A GREAT QUOTE.

118
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,330
HE ATTEMPTS TO DISTRACT, THIS

119
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,889
WEIRD EMOTIONAL TANGENT.

120
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,740
RESPECTFULLY, NOT ANSWERING
THE QUESTION ñ

121
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,480
WHAT IS THE QUESTION?

122
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,610
JAMES COMEY SAID THAT THERE
WERE MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO THE

123
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,490
RECUSAL THAT WERE PROBLEMATIC
AND HE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM.

124
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,630
WHAT ARE THEY?

125
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,550
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

126
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,260
THEY
ARE NONE SEN.

127
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,889
THEY ARE NONE.

128
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:04,889
I

129
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,630
CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR ABSOLUTE ñ

130
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,150
CERTAINTY.

131
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,640
AND HE ALSO WENT ON TO SAY
THIS EVENTUALLY.

132
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:22,090
NO ONE IS

133
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,720
ACCUSING YOU OF THAT, THAT
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

134
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
I'D HAVE

135
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE TALKING

136
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
ABOUT.

137
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,210
THEY ARE ACCUSING YOU OF
SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE.

138
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,210
YOU ARE

139
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,410
INVOLVED IN THE SIGN LETTER THAT
RECOMMENDED THE JAMES COMEY GET

140
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,410
FIRED.

141
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,140
AS JAYAR JACKSON POINTED
OUT, HIS DEFENSE IS SAYING I

142
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,270
DIDN'T RECUSE MYSELF FROM
EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE

143
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,680
FBI, WHICH IS TRUE.

144
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
BUT YOU
KNOW DAMN WELL THE SITUATION

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,210
WHERE YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP

146
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,770
SAYING WHAT WAS ON HIS MIND, WAS
THAT THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION

147
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,560
IS A HOAX AND HE NEEDS TO BE
SHUT DOWN.

148
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
THE IDEA THAT YOU

149
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,650
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT THAT YOU
DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE

150
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,440
PRINCIPAL THING THAT JAMES COMEY
IS WORKING ON AT THAT PARTICULAR

151
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,990
MOMENT, WE KNOW FROM NEWS
REPORTS OF THE TIME THAT HE HAD

152
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,240
JUST REQUESTED ADDITIONAL
RESOURCES FOR THAT

153
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
INVESTIGATION.

154
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,450
HE IS FIRED
INSIDE OF 48 HOURS OF THAT

155
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,450
REQUEST.

156
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,090
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME
SORT OF CASE THAT THIS DOESN'T

157
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,430
VIOLATE RECUSAL IF WE FORGET
EVERYTHING ELSE WE KNOW ABOUT

158
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,650
WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THIS

159
00:07:23,650 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY.
