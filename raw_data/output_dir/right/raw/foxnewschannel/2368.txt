1
00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:02,446
EXAMINE THIS NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.

2
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:04,381
THE SACRIFICE OF A SMALL CHILD

3
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:08,318
ON THE ALTER OF SOCIALIZED

4
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:08,785
MEDICINE.

5
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:10,487
FIRST, THE NEW COUNTER CULTURE,

6
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:18,762
THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE.

7
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:20,197
ENTERTAINMENT ELITES ARE IN

8
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:21,098
FREAK-OUT MODE.

9
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:21,365
WHY?

10
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:23,967
ONE OF THEIR MEGASTARS, KANYE

11
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:26,303
WEST, ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S

12
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:27,204
THINKING FOR HIMSELF.

13
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:29,306
FELT LIKE A CULTURAL EARTHQUAKE

14
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:31,675
OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN WEST

15
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:34,945
TWEETED THAT HE LIKED THE WAY A

16
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:37,714
CONSERVATIVE BLACK ACTIVIST

17
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:40,050
THOUGHT.

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,386
HE FOLLOWED IT UP WITH PRO TRUMP

19
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:44,087
TWEETS THAT HAS THE INTERNET

20
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:44,454
EXPLODING.

21
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:46,923
HE DECLARED HIS LOVE FOR TRUMP

22
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,425
AND EX-STOLED THE DRAGON ENERGY

23
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:48,892
THEY SHARE.

24
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:49,860
WHAT IS THAT?

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,763
HE REFUSED TO LET THE MOB SHAKE

26
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:54,564
HIS LOVE FOR THE PRESIDENT.

27
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,366
NOW LOOK, THIS ISN'T ABOUT

28
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,402
CELEBRATING ONE SUPERSTAR'S

29
00:00:58,402 --> 00:00:59,436
ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP.

30
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,004
WHAT I'M GOING TO BE TALKING

31
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:03,006
ABOUT IS SHINING A LIGHT ON THE

32
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,775
MORE INTOLLERANT CROWD OUT

33
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:05,075
THERE.

34
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:06,743
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE THAT CLAIM

35
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:09,479
THAT THEY HAVE A MONOPOLY ON

36
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,714
TOLERANCE AND INCLUSION?

37
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:12,449
THINK ABOUT THIS.

38
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:15,118
OTHER THAN ACADEMIA, THERE'S FEW

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,686
INDUSTRIES THAT AMERICA, THE

40
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:19,022
AMERICAN LEFT DOMINATES LIKE IT

41
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:23,493
DOES ENTERTAINMENT.

42
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:26,196
FOR KANYE'S SIN OF SPEAKING HIS

43
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:29,766
MIND, MUSICAL ICONS LIKE NICKI

44
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,701
MINAJ AND DRAKE AND RIHANNA

45
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:33,804
UNFOLLOWED HIM ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

46
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:36,239
WHAT A PUNISHMENT.

47
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,741
THE REACTION FROM THE LEFT WAS

48
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,944
JUST AS PRONOUNCED.

49
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:41,545
>> DIFFERENT CELEBRITY

50
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:41,578
>> DIFFERENT CELEBRIIE

51
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:43,647
>> DIFFERENT CELEBRIIES

52
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:44,848
DESPERATE FOR ATTENTION.

53
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:46,650
>> NOW HIS WIFE IS TWEETING BACK

54
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,186
AT PEOPLE SAYING DON'T BE TOO

55
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:50,454
HARD ON MY HUSBAND.

56
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:51,988
DON'T MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE'S

57
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,290
GOING THROUGH A MENTAL BREAK

58
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,858
DOWN, WHICH WE KNOW HE'S HAD.

59
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:56,326
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

60
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:56,827
HERE.

61
00:01:56,827 --> 00:01:58,195
I THINK KANYE WEST JUST REALIZED

62
00:01:58,195 --> 00:01:59,463
HE'S TOO RICH TO NOT BE

63
00:01:59,463 --> 00:01:59,863
REPUBLICAN.

64
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:00,530
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

65
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,065
>> WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO

66
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:02,966
INDEPENDENT THOUGHTS AND I

67
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,669
INDEPENDENTLY THINK THAT KANYE

68
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:08,405
HAS LOST HIS MIND.

69
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:12,509
>> IS STEPHEN STILL?

70
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:12,876
CHARACTER?

71
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:13,543
I FORGET.

72
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,345
ORIGINAL THOUGHT WILL NOT BE

73
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,146
TOLERATED.

74
00:02:16,146 --> 00:02:19,983
ANYONE THAT BREAKS FROM THE BORG

75
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,685
MINDSET MUST BE SHUNNED OR

76
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:24,788
BULLIED BACK INTO THE FOLD.

77
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,890
KANYE SHARED A TEXT EXCHANGE

78
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,491
WITH JOHN LEGEND.

79
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:31,094
LOVE HIS MUSIC.

80
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:35,632
BUT THIS ILLUSTRATES THE POINTS.

81
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:37,868
JOHN LEGEND SAID YOU'RE WAY TOO

82
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,069
POWERFUL TO ENDORSE WHAT HE IS

83
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:40,470
AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR.

84
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,105
SO MANY PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU

85
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:43,907
FEEL BETRAYED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

86
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:45,942
THEY KNOW THE HARM THAT TRUMP'S

87
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:47,544
POLICIES CAUSE.

88
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:48,912
ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR.

89
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:52,382
DON'T LET THIS BE PART OF YOUR

90
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:53,149
LEGACY.

91
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,484
KANYE WEST WASN'T IMPRESSED.

92
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:56,386
HE SAID I LOVE YOU, JOHN, BUT

93
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,221
BRINGING UP MY FANS AND MY

94
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:01,725
LEGACY IS A TACTIC BASED ON FEAR

95
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:03,293
USED TO MANIPULATE MY FREE

96
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:03,627
THOUGHT.

97
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:04,160
HE'S RIGHT.

98
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,228
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT

99
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,830
ON MY SHOW, KANYE WEST IS RIGHT.

100
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,598
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

101
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:11,067
ANYONE THAT DARES TO QUESTION

102
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,869
THE IDEALOGICAL ORTHODOXSY OF

103
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:16,206
THE LEFT, PARTICULARLY A BLACK

104
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,742
ARTIST, MUST BE BROUGHT BACK

105
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,777
INTO LINE.

106
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:24,347
NOW, LET'S TALK TURKEY HERE.

107
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:27,250
WHERE KANYE WEST IS PUNKING THE

108
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,421
ELITES OR WHETHER HE'S SINCERELY

109
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:35,825
EXPRESSING A BELIEF AND THE

110
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:36,826
PRESIDENT IS IMMATERIAL.

111
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:38,428
HE'S OPENED THE DOOR OF THE

112
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:41,064
GLARING HYPOCRISY OF THE LEFT.

113
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:44,067
THEY CLAIM TO DEFEND MINORITY

114
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:46,169
RIGHTS UNTIL A MINORITY

115
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,170
DISAGREES WITH THEM.

116
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,906
THEY CLAIM TO BE FOR DIVERSITY

117
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:52,943
UNTIL A TRULY DIVERSE VIEWPOINT

118
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:53,410
IS HEARD.

119
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,513
WHAT WEST MIGHT HAVE UNWITTINGLY

120
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:58,848
DONE IS MADE IT A LITTLE EASIER

121
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,617
FOR OTHERS TO STAND UP AGAINST

122
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,851
THIS HERD MENTALITY.

123
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:04,588
HE DID RECEIVE SOME SUPPORT FOR

124
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:05,689
HIS INDEPENDENCE.

125
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:08,792
CHANCE, THE RAPPER, HARDLY A

126
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:10,560
CONSERVATIVE VOICE, TWEETED

127
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:10,961
THIS.

128
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,363
BLACK PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO BE

129
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:13,730
DEMOCRATS.

130
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,099
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

131
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:19,903
SO SCANDALOUS.

132
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:21,338
I DON'T THINK THAT KANYE WEST IS

133
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,006
THE NEW MLK.

134
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:23,373
ALL RIGHT?

135
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:26,009
I HAVE VIVID MEMORIES OF HIM AT

136
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,847
SOME TELEVISED FUND RAISER IN

137
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,015
THE WAKE OF HURRICANE.

138
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:33,883
>> GEORGE BUSH DOESN'T CARE

139
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:35,018
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.

140
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:36,019
>> THAT WASN'T NICE.

141
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,988
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN HE RUDELY

142
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,322
RUSHED THE STAGE TO TRY TO TAKE

143
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,625
A MUSIC AWARD FROM TAYLOR SWIFT.

144
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,493
THAT ALSO WASN'T NIGHT.

145
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:45,829
15 YEARS AGO, YES, I CAN HARDLY

146
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:48,531
BELIEVE IT, I WROTE A BOOK

147
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:51,067
CALLED "SHUT UP AND SING" WAS A

148
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,170
CRITIQUE OF THE POLITICAL

149
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,805
ACTIVISM OF THESE PEOPLE LIKE

150
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,173
THE DIXIE CHICKS AND JACKSON

151
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,141
BROWN AND ON AND ON.

152
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:00,310
THE UPSHOT IS, WE PAY THEM TO

153
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,677
ENTERTAIN.

154
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:03,747
WE DON'T WANT TO BE CAPTIVE TO

155
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:06,750
THEIR POLITICAL PONDERING.

156
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,352
SOMEONE WHO FOR SOME UN-GODLY

157
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:11,087
REASON DOES GET PAID TO

158
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:13,289
PONTIFICATE ON POLITICS, HER

159
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,328
NAME IS MISS ANNA NAVARRO

160
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:18,962
TWEETED AT ME.

161
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:21,231
HAS SHE TOLD KANYE TO SHUT UP

162
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:23,033
AND SING YET OR DOES THAT ONLY

163
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,968
APPLY TO ANTI-TRUMP BLACK

164
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:25,368
CELEBRITIES?

165
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,570
I'LL MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU, ANNA,

166
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,674
IT APPLIES TO ANYONE PEDALLING

167
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,809
POLITICAL NONSENSE WHILE LACKING

168
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:36,780
THE CREDENTIALS OR EXPERIENCE TO

169
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,450
DO SO, ANA.

170
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,053
I'M NOT ABOUT TO CHEER ON KANYE

171
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,154
WEST BECAUSE HE SAID SOMETHING

172
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:45,288
NICE ABOUT TRUMP.

173
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:50,160
THE POLITICAL MUSINGS OF

174
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,227
UNINFIRMED CELEBRITIES IS NOT

175
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,028
INTERESTING TO ME AT ALL.

176
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:54,464
WHAT IS INTERESTING, THE OVERTHE

177
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:56,633
TOP REACTION TO A BIG STAR

178
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,768
SAYING SOMETHING TRULY COUNTER

179
00:05:58,768 --> 00:05:59,869
CULTURAL TODAY.

180
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:01,771
THAT'S OF GREAT INTEREST TO ME.

181
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:03,373
WASHING THE LEFT ATTACK HIM FOR

182
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:05,575
DARING TO BREAK RANKS WITH THEM.

183
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,510
EVEN IN THE VAGUEST OF TERMS

184
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,712
TALKING ABOUT LOVE AND LOVING

185
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:12,015
PEOPLE THAT IS TRULY REVEALING.

186
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:14,451
WHAT KANYE WEST SAYS OR DOES IN

187
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,186
THE DAYS AHEAD IS LESS IMPORTANT

188
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:20,190
THAN THE CONVERSATION HE

189
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,523
