ABLE TO BE HOSTED HERE THAT I'M

193
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,640
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

194
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,310
STATES AT THE WHITE HOUSE AT

195
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,711
WASHINGTON.

196
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,678
AND ALSO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE

197
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,547
FOR THE RESPECTIVE OF THE

198
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:59,785
CENTENNIAL OF POLAND GAINING ITS

199
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:01,988
INDEPENDENCE THIS FACT IS FOR

200
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,356
POLES LIVING IN POLAND AND

201
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:03,990
ESPECIALLY THE 10 MILLION POLES

202
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,359
LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES THIS

203
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:10,629
IS A HUGE SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE.

204
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,567
ONE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE

205
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,902
METER OF POLISH INDEPENDENCE WAS

206
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:22,308
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT POINTS OF

207
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,844
THE POLICY OF U.S. PRESIDENT

208
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,478
WILSON.

209
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,111
IT WAS PRECISELY PRESIDENT

210
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,247
WILSON BEFORE 1918, HE WAS THE

211
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,783
ONE WHO PUT POLISH INDEPENDENCE

212
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,352
ON HIS AGENDA, ON THE AGENDA OF

213
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:33,752
HIS POLICY.

214
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,989
THAT HAPPENED AMONG OTHERS

215
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:41,694
THANKS TO A GREAT POLISH

216
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,195
POLITICIAN AND COMPOSER.

217
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,931
IT IS EFFECT THAT POLES

218
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,331
EXPERIENCED BACK THEN A LOT OF

219
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:47,399
GOOD FROM THE UNITED STATES AND

220
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,271
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

221
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:52,504
STATES.

222
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:53,806
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER WORDS TO

223
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,242
DESCRIBE THE FACT THAT THAT

224
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,977
GREAT STATE INDICATED TO POLAND

225
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,112
AND FIND POLAND AS THE COUNTRY

226
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,747
WHO SHOULD BE REINSTATED ON THE

227
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,216
MAP OF EUROPE AND OTHER MAP OF

228
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:04,883
THE WORLD.

229
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:10,089
AND IT WASN'T REINSTATED THERE

230
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:10,756
IN 1918, 100 YEARS AGO.

231
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,425
AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE IN

232
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,759

238
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,937
I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT THE

239
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,006

00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,240

248
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,886
CHANGED OVER THE TEN YEARS.

249
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,755
THIS RENEWED VERSION OF THE

250
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,188

00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,180

INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ENERGY

288
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,738
INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH CONCERNING

00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,841
ELECTRICITY AND THE TRANSMISSION

290
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,508

291
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,812
REFERRING HERE TO THE AREA

00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,613

00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,099
DEVELOP AND OUR COOPERATION WITH

301
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:35,968
IN THIS.

302
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,569
ALSO AS FAR AS PROVIDING ENERGY

303
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:38,571
AND SECURITY IS CONCERNED TODAY

304
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,172
WE HAVE TALKED WITH LENGTH ABOUT

305
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,509
THIS WITH MR. PRESIDENT, WE ALSO

306
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,510
DISCUSSED THREATS TO ENERGY

307
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,848
SECURITY IN EUROPE TO THE

308
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,850
POSSIBLE DEVERSIFICATION OF

309
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,817
SUPPLIES.

310
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,652
WITHOUT ANY DOUBT THE BIGGEST

311
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,621
THREAT RIGHT NOW IS PROPOSED BY

312
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,423
THE CONSTRUCTION OF NORTH STREAM

313
00:10:58,423 --> 00:10:58,924
TWO PIPELINE.

314
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,592
WE DISCUSSED THIS AT LENGTH WITH

315
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:00,992
MR. PRESIDENT.

316
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,093
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO BE

317
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:03,496
CLEAR AND SAY BOTH FROM THE

318
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,598
GERMAN AND RUSSIAN SIDE THIS

319
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,333
CONSTRUCTION HAS ALREADY BEEN

320
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,134
STARTED.

321
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,203
THERE IS STILL SOME FORMALITIES

322
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,004
GOING ON CONNECTED WITH THE

323
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,106
LENGTH OF THE PIPES AT THE

324
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,609
BOTTOM OF THE BALTIC SEA.

325
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,442
HOWEVER THIS INVESTMENT WITHOUT

326
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,211
ANY DOUBT THREATENS ENERGY

327
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,046
STABILITY OF EUROPE.

328
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,515
AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT IT

329
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,716
THREATENS POLISH ENERGY

330
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,250
SECURITY.

331
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,452
BECAUSE THERE IS A THREAT OF

332
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,353
RATION ENERGY DOMINATION

333
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,553
ESPECIALLY WHEN RUSSIA MENTIONS

334
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:30,890
THAT IT'S GOING TO BUILD MORE

335
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,259
PIPELINES, NORTH STREAM THREE,

336
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,627
NORTH STREAM FOUR.

337
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,628
THIS THREAT OF ABSOLUTE RUSSIAN

338
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:39,664
DOMINATION IN EUROPE IS OBVIOUS.

339
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:40,332
WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?

340
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,734
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WERE

341
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:46,304
ABLE TO SEE THAT OURSELVES IN

342
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:46,538
UKRAINE.

343
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:47,172
SUDDEN INTERACTION OF SUPPLIES,

344
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:48,674
OF COURSE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO

345
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,877
WITH ECONOMIC FACTORS, IT WAS

346
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,280
CONNECTED ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY

347
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,080
WITH POLITICAL BLACKMAIL.

348
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,315
IT WAS A FACT.

349
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,849
AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT TODAY WE

350
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,552
ARE MAKING EFFORTS AND WE ARE

351
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,986
GOING TO GO TO ANY LENGTHS TO

352
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,488
PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THAT.

353
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,024
THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO

354
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,458
CONSTRUCT AN LNG TERMINAL.

355
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:12,431
THAT IS WHY WE ALSO DECIDED TO

356
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,533
RECEIVE THE LNG GAS FROM THE

357
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,000
UNITED STATES.

358
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,269
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE HAVE

359
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,003
CONCLUDED SUCH CONTRACTS.

360
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,005
I AM GLAD THAT AMERICAN

361
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,008
COMPANIES ARE RIGHT NOW

362
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:28,180
DELIVERING LNG TO POLAND.

363
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,849
AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THANKS

364
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:34,019
TO THE LNG GAS TERMINAL, THANKS

365
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:41,293
TO EXPANDING ITS CAPACITY WE ARE

366
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,229
NOT ONLY GOING TO REALIZE AND

367
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,997
SAFEGUARD OUR OWN ENERGY NEEDS

368
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,900
BUT I ALSO HELP WE WILL BE ABLE

369
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,901
TO TRANSMIT GAS FURTHER TO OUR

370
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:55,808
NEIGHBORS THROUGH THE

371
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,543
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION

372
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,177
OF INTERCONNECTERS.

373
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,079
THESE CONDITIONS WERE ALREADY

374
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,381
WELL RAISED IN OUR TALKS WITH

375
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:02,748
MR. PRESIDENT.

376
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,217
AND LASTLY WE LIKE TO INVITE

377
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,052
AMERICAN BUSINESS TO POLAND.

378
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,121
THERE ARE BETTER AND BETTER

379
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,788
INVESTMENT POSSIBILITIES.

380
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,388
OF COURSE THERE ARE COMPANIES

381

00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:36,749

POLAND IS A BIG EUROPEAN

400
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,929

00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,836
WE WOULD LIKE TO INVITE AMERICAN

425
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,370

431
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,049
THE ISSUE OF MILITARY SECURITY.

432
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:48,821
I'M DELIGHTED WITH THE PRESIDENT

433
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,654

I'M DELIGHTED WITH THE ACTIONS

436
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,660
TAKEN IN WARSAW SUMMIT IN 2018

437
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,329

439
00:14:59,331 --> 00:14:59,865

I'M ALSO HAPPY THAT WE HAVE IN

441
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,170

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENCE OF

447
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:29,595
THE UNITED STATES IS A GAURANTOR

448
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:29,895
OF SECURITY.

449
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,063

THE POLISH FORCES ARE CONCERNED

456
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,143

I'M CONVINCED THIS COOPERATION

461
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,123
BETWEEN POLAND AND THE UNITED

462
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,490
STATES WILL GO ON SMOOTHLY.

463
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,661
I HOPE THAT MR. PRESIDENT WILL

464
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,998

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,515
TRUMP AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT

474
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,016
THIS IS POSSIBE.

475
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,518
I AM CONVINCED THAT SUCH A

476
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,453
DECISION LIES BOTH IN THE POLISH

477
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,488

478
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,355

POLAND IS AN ATTRACTIVE COUNTRY

480
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,859

LOCATION IN EUROPE.

483
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,329
AND I'M CONVINCED THAT FOR THE

484
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,831

00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,731
ALSO PERTAINING TO THE SECURITY

00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:41,633
OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF THE

00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,769
PRESENCE OF THE U.S. FORCES IN

503
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,637

NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA,

509
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:33,018
VIRGINIA, AND THE AREA THAT WAS

510
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,154
SO HORRIBLY HIT BY HURRICANE

511
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:35,421
FLORENCE.

512
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,389
I JUST GOT SOME CLIPS OF SOME OF

513
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,825
THE THINGS THAT THE COAST GUARD

514
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,629
IS DOING AND GETTING PEOPLE TO

515
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,630
SAFETY AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE

516
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,930
CONDITIONS.

517
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,132
I WANT TO JUST SALUTE ALL OF THE

518
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,102

ENFORCEMENT, THE MILITARY, FEMA.

521
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,876
THE JOB THEY'RE DOING IS

522
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,176
INCREDIBLE.

523
00:17:58,176 --> 00:17:58,543
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

524
00:17:58,543 --> 00:17:59,478
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK THEM

525
00:17:59,478 --> 00:17:59,778

526
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,814
AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS

527
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,951
WE'LL TAKE OUR FIRST QUESTION

528
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:15,961
FROM EMERALD ROBINSON OF ONE

529
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:16,461
AMERICA NEWS.

530
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,697
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

531
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:23,769
SO NEWS TODAY OF A A RUSSIAN

532
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,670
PLANE SHOT DOWN OVER SYRIA.

533
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,606
RUSSIA IS ASSIGNING THE BLAME TO

534
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,074
ISRAEL EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

535
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,943
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT DOWN BY SYRIAN

536
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,176
FORCES.

537
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:31,677
THERE'S CONCERNS BY MANY

538
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,644
AMERICANS THAT WE MIGHT BE

539
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,047
INVOLVED IN A WAR IN SYRIA SOON.

540
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,782
YOU HAD HOPED TO BRING TROOPS

541
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:41,253
HOME BUT CLEARLY THINGS ARE

542
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:41,520
CHANGING.

543
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,321
WHAT DO YOU TELL AMERICAN PEOPLE

544
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,289
TODAY ABOUT A POSSIBILITY OF A

545
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,457
WAR IN SYRIA?

546
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,894
>> I JUST HEARD ABOUT THE

547
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,996
INCIDENT YOU HAVE MENTIONED,

548
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:51,229
EMERALD.

549
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,764
AND IT SOUNDS TO ME AND IT SEEMS

550
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,167
TO ME JUST LIKE BASED ON A

551
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,370
REVIEW OF THE FACTS THAT SYRIA

552
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,804
SHOT DOWN A RUSSIAN PLANE.

553
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,508
AND I UNDERSTAND ABOUT 14 PEOPLE

554
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,145
WERE KILLED AT LEAST AND THAT'S

555
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,281
A VERY SAD THING.

556
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,148
BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

557
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,718
BUT SYRIA, ACCORDING TO EARLY

558
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:13,718
REPORTS, THAT'S SUBJECT TO

559
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:13,952
CHANGE.

560
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,555
BUT THAT SYRIA SHOT DOWN A

561
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:16,888
RUSSIAN PLANE.

562
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:18,824
SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION.

563
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,728
WE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB IN

564
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,196
SYRIA AND IN THAT REGION

565
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,031
ERADICATING ISIS WHICH IS WHY

566
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:26,331
WE'RE THERE.

567
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,966
AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO BEING

568
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,000
FINISHED WITH THAT JOB.

569
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,402
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A

570
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,838
DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT WE'RE

571
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,839
GOING TO DO.

572
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,141
BUT WE HAVE ERADICATED ISIS IN A

573
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,642
VERY LARGE AREA OF THE MIDDLE

574
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:38,043
EAST.

575
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,311
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT

576
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,513
BE COMING HERE BECAUSE THEY'RE

577
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,714
NOT AROUND ANY LONGER.

578
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,750
SO WE HAVE DONE IN A VERY SHORT

579
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,252
PERIOD OF TIME OUR VICE

580
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,655
PRESIDENT IS HERE, MIKE PENCE.

581
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,589
OUR GREAT SECRETARY OF STATE

582
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:53,859
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

583
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,926
GREAT JOB YOU'RE DOING, MIKE

584
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:55,160
POMPEO.

585
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,129
AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY

586
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:57,796
HARD ON THIS.

587
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,431
AND THEY HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE

588
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,131
JOB OVER THERE.

589
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,266
BUT WE'LL MAKE A DECISION FAIRLY

590
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:02,533
QUICKLY.

591
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:03,302
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

592
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:08,206
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE

593
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:08,607
PRESIDENT?

594
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:08,940
>> CERTAINLY.

595
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,508
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT DUDA.

596
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,609
CLEARLY YOU SAID YOU ASKED

597
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,077
PRESIDENT TRUMP IF HE WOULD

598
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,079
CONSIDER A PERMANENT BASE IN

599
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,548
POLAND AND THAT ALSO REALITIES

600
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,015
TO RUSSIA.

601
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,284
HOW DID THE PRESIDENT RESPOND TO

602
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,421
YOUR POSITION TO HAVE A

603
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,889
PERMANENT BASE FROM AMERICA IN

604
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,256
POLAND.

605
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,794
AND THEN ALSO DO YOU CURRENTLY

606
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:37,769
HAVE CONCERNS OVER THE U.S.

607
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,202
RUSSIA RELATIONSHIP?

608
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:41,073
>> WELL OF COURSE I TOLD MR.

609
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,542
PRESIDENT ABOUT ALL OF THE

610
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,710
ASPECTS CONNECTED WITH THE

611
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,445
PERMANENT PRESENCE OF THE U.S.

612
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,779
ARMED FORCES IN POLAND.

613
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,048
BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST I ASSURED

614
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,249
MR. PRESIDENT OF ONE THING.

615
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:52,451
FIRST AND FOREMOST, LADIES AND

616
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,086
GENTLEMEN, WE CANNOT SAY THAT IF

617
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,155
THERE ARE PERMANENT BASES OF THE

618
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,891
U.S. ARMED FORCES IN POLAND WE

619
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,926
WILL SEE A DETERIORATION OF

620
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,762
SECURITY BECAUSE THAT WILL LEAD

621
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:09,234
TO AN INCREASED RUSSIAN ACTIVITY

622
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,969
AND INCREASED MILITARIZATION OF

623
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,271
THIS PART OF EUROPE BY RUSSIA.

624
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:20,011
I WANT TO SAY IT CLEARLY, LADIES

625
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:20,679
AND GENTLEMEN.

626
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,446
A VERY STRONG MILITARIZATION HAS

627
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,582
TAKEN PLACE FOR MORE THAN TEN

628
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:23,882
YEARS NOW.

629
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,084
IT IS THE REALITY THAT WE LIVE

630
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:26,451
IN TODAY.

631
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,153
AS FAR AS AN AGGRESSIVE RUSSIAN

632
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:36,561
BEHAVIOR IS CONCERNED, AS FAR AS

633
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,496
INCREASED RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES

634
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,297
RUSSIA HAS BEEN CONDUCTING SUCH

635
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:40,365
ACTIVITIES IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY

636
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,800
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE

637
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,668
ABLE TO SEE THAT IN A

638
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,704
MATERIALIZED WAY IN GEORGIA

639
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,107
IN 2008 WHEN THE THEN PRESIDENT

640
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,009
OF POLAND TOOK OTHER EUROPEAN

641
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,512
LEADERS AND WENT TO STOP RUSSIAN

642
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,580
TANKS WHICH WERE ABOUT TO ATTACK

643
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,449
THE CAPITAL OF GEORGIA AND FROM

644
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:01,219
THAT MOMENT THAT MILITARY

645
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,520
EXPANSION HAS BEEN DEVELOPING.

646
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,823
IT'S OTHER LEG WAS THE ATTACK ON

647
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:11,963
UKRAINE AND TODAY WE CAN SEE AN

648
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:12,563
ILLEGAL ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA.

649
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:15,133
SO THESE ARE TODAY POLITICAL AND

650
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,068
MILITARY FACTS OF EUROPE.

651
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,637
AND THE PRESENCE OF THE UNITED

652
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:21,306
STATES IS ONLY PROVIDING A

653
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,142
GUARANTEE OF SECURITY AND A

654
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,043
POSSIBILITY TO DEFEND BECAUSE

655
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,411
LET ME REITERATE AGAIN IT IS

656
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,779
ONLY ABOUT THE GUARANTEE OF

657
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,014
SECURITY AND DEFENSE OF OUR PART

658
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,682
OF EUROPE THAT IS THE FREE

659
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:30,915
WORLD.

660
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:33,552
THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUE

661
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,520
RIGHT NOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE,

662
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,821
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CENTRAL

663
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,023
AND EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND WE

664
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:43,929
ARE SPEAKING IN ONE VOICE ON

665
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,196
THIS ONE GENERALLY.

666
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:51,169
THAT IS WHY WE WANTED TO INSURE

667
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,871
THE PRESENCE OF THE U.S. ARMED

668
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,104
FORCES.

669
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:55,140
AND OF COURSE MR. PRESIDENT AND

670
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,542
HIS STAFF, HIS ADVISERS AND ALSO

671
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,810
THE PENTAGON STAFF HAVE TO

672
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,946
CONSIDER ALL OF THESE ISSUES BUT

673
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,582
THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF

674
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,949
ARGUMENTS WHICH ARE IN FAVOR OF

675
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:06,384
THE FACT THAT THE PRESENCE OF

676
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,921
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES IN THIS

677
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:10,655
AREA IS ABSOLUTELY JUSTIFIED

678
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,423
TODAY.

679
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,124
THAT IS DUE TO THE PROTECTION OF

680
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:16,328
THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED

681
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:16,695
STATES AS WELL.

682
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,197
SO I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF

683
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:19,564
THIS ONE.

684
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,801
BECAUSE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY WE

685
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,503
ARE SEEING INTERNATIONAL LAW

686
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,536
BEING VIOLATED.

687
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:26,838
TODAY WE ARE SEEING AGGRESSIVE

688
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,673
BEHAVIORS, AND I'M CONVINCED

689
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,175
THAT THERE IS NO MORE EFFECTIVE

690
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,644
METHOD THAN PREVENTING A WAR

691
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,678
THAN A DECISIVE STANCE

692
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,947
DEMONSTRATING THAT WE ARE READY

693
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:43,722
ANY MOMENT TO REPEL A POSSIBLE

694
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:43,955
ATTACK.

695
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:44,556
AND THAT PRESENCE ALSO MEANS

696
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:44,856
DETERRENCE.

697
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:45,857
AT THE SAME TIME I AM CONVINCE

698
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,126
THAT HAD WHEN WE HAVE A STRONG

699
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,195
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THIS PART

700
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,264
OF EUROPE WHETHER AS A POTENTIAL

701
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,399
THREAT THEN THERE WILL BE NO WAR

702
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:54,766
HAPPENING EVER.

703
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,234
>> IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT

704
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,802
THE PRESIDENT SAID AND HE SAID

705
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:59,804
IT PUBLICLY THAT HE WOULD PAY

706
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:00,471
THE UNITED STATES, MEANING

707
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,606
POLAND WOULD BE PAYING BILLIONS

708
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,574
OF DOLLARS FOR A BASE.

709
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,509
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT MORE

710
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,814
AND MORE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF

711
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,681
DEFENDING REALLY WEALTHY

712
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,016
COUNTRIES AND NOT BEING

713
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,083
REIMBURSED, PAID, IT'S ONE THING

714
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,285
WHEN WE DEFEND COUNTRIES THAT

715
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,119
CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES AND

716
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,054
THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE AND WE

717
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:16,788
SHOULD HELP THEM.

718
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,925
WE DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING FOR

719
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:20,125
THAT.

720
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,226
BUT WHEN WE'RE DEFENDING

721
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,161
IMMENSELY WEALTHY COUNTRIES AND

722
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,229
THEY'RE NOT PAYING FOR THE

723
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,231
DEFENSE TO THE UNITED STATES

724
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:30,969
THEY'RE ONLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

725
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,503
US.

726
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,605
AND WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH

727
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,074
NUMEROUS COUNTRIES ALL OF WHOM

728
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,242
YOU KNOW ABOUT PAYMENT AND WE

729
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,778
GET ALONG WITH THEM VERY WELL.

730
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:40,679
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR.

731
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,113
THAT INCLUDES NATO.

732
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,716
AS YOU KNOW I GOT $44 BILLION

733
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,017
ADDITIONAL LAST YEAR.

734
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:52,123
WHERE THEY PAID AN ADDITIONAL,

735
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,125
YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE SECRETARY

736
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,660
GENERAL THE HEAD OF NATO.

737
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,696
HE SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

738
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,262
LIKE IT.

739
00:24:58,262 --> 00:24:59,931
AND THIS YEAR WE DID EVEN

740
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:00,465
BETTER.

741
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,533
WHEN A COUNTRY IS VERY WEALTHY

742
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,602
AND WHEN THE UNITED STATES HAS

743
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,104
BEEN PROTECTING THEM FOR MANY

744
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,607
YEARS AT TREMENDOUS COST, COSTS

745
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:12,510
LIKE NOBODY IN THIS ROOM WOULD

746
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,980
BELIEVE IT'S TIME THAT THEY HELP

747
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,616
WITH WE CALL IT BURDEN SHARING

748
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,684
AND THEY WILL DO THAT.

749
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,918
BUT THE PRESIDENT OFFERED US

750
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:22,287
MUCH MORE THAN $2 BILLION TO DO

751
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,755
THIS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT.

752
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:27,425
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE

753
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,093
STANDPOINT OF NUMBER ONE

754
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:33,732
MILITARY PROTECTION FOR BOTH

755
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,834
COUNTRIES AND ALSO COST.

756
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:41,473
A TERM YOU DON'T HEAR TOO OFTEN

757
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,174
BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOT TO

758
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:43,708
BE.

759
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,141
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

760
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:50,215
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A

761
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:55,554
QUESTION PLEASE.

762
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:55,887
.

763
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,690
>> I HAVE A QUESTION TO

764
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,257
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

765
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,393
DO YOU SHARE THE CONVICTION

766
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,062
WHICH WE HAVE JUST HEARD A

767
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,530
MINUTE AGO EXPRESSED BY

768
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,835
PRESIDENT DUDA CONCERNING THE

769
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,304
THREAT WHICH IS POSED TO THE

770
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:16,307
REGION BY RUSSIA AND DO YOU ALSO

771
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:18,309
SHARE THE VIEW THAT PERMANENT

772
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:19,577
AMERICAN BASES IN POLAND ARE

773
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,812
JUSTIFIED NOT ONLY DUE TO THE

774
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,247
SECURITY OF THE COUNTRIES IN OUR

775
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,084
REGION BUT ALSO DUE TO THE

776
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,585
SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES?

777
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:32,057
>> I THINK IT'S A VERY

778
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:32,691
AGGRESSIVE SITUATION.

779
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,626
I THINK RUSSIA HAS ACTED

780
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:34,959
AGGRESSIVELY.

781
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:38,029
THEY RESPECT FORCE, THEY RESPECT

782
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:38,997
STRENGTH AS ANYONE DOES.

783
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,032
AND WE HAVE THE THE GREATEST

784
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,567
STRENGTH IN THE WORLD ESPECIALLY

785
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:42,734
NOW.

786
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,168
WE WERE BEING DEPLETED UNDER THE

787
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:44,703
LAST ADMINISTRATION.

788
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:48,139
WE HAD PLANES THAT WERE OLD AND

789
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,042
TIRED AND DIDN'T FLY IN SOME

790
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:51,242
CASES.

791
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,811
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES, THAT

792
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,045
DOESN'T HAPPEN, WE MAKE THE

793
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:59,651
GREATEST PLANES IN THE WORLD AND

794
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,152
MISSILES IN THE WORLD.

795
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,289
WE HAVE ENHANCED TO PUT IT

796
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,089
MILDLY OUR MILITARY.

797
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:08,760
IT'S LITERALLY BEING REBUILT AS

798
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,894
WE SPEAK WITH LITERALLY HUNDREDS

799
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,229
AND HUNDREDS OF PLANES AND

800
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,397
MISSILES AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU

801
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,163
CAN IMAGINE.

802
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:15,433
THEY NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD.

803
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:19,237
BECAUSE I GOT IN CONGRESS

804
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,972
$700 BILLION THIS YEAR.

805
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,040
$716 BILLION LAST YEAR.

806
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,743
THAT'S FAR MORE THAN THEY EVER

807
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,076
ANTICIPATED.

808
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:25,810
I VIEWED IT TWO WAYS.

809
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,845
NUMBER ONE, MILITARY BECAUSE

810
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,413
IT'S ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

811
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,747
ANYTHING ELSE INCLUDING JOBS.

812
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:32,016
BUT NUMBER TWO IS JOBS.

813
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,017
WE MAKE EVERYTHING HERE.

814
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:34,986
SO IT'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

815
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:41,526
JOBS TO MAKE FOR US THE BEST

816
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,828
MILITARY IN THE WORLD.

817
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,829
AND RUSSIA RESPECTS THAT.

818
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,066
SO I AM WITH THE PRESIDENT.

819
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:48,866
I FEEL THAT HE'S RIGHT.

820
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:52,403
AND I FEEL THAT YOU LOOK AT THE

821
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:54,438
HISTORY OF POLAND AND RUSSIA.

822
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:56,041
I'D SAY LONG AND VERY

823
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:56,474
COMPLICATED HISTORY.

824
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,076
SO CERTAINLY IT HAS THE RIGHT TO

825
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:12,824
FEEL THAT WAY.

826
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:18,797
DO YOU HAVE THE FEELING THAT -- 

827
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:19,764
ARE THEY CLOSER TO BEING 

828
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:20,097
IMPLEMENTED? 

829
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:23,368
ARE THEY GOING TO BE A FACT? 

830
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,636
>> I DO. 

831
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,505
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MYSELF 

832
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:34,212
AND MR. PRESIDENT HAD A MEETING.

833
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,046
A PRIVATE MEETING. 

834
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:41,519
WE MET WITH OUR STAFF. 

835
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,654
WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION, 

836
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,288
VERY HONEST DISCUSSIONS, AND 

837
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,823
VERY STRONG AT CERTAIN POINTS 

838
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,859
AS WELL. 

839
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:48,993
IN TERMS OF DIAGNOSIS OF THE 

840
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,596
SITUATION IN THE AREA OF 

841
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,064
MILITARY AND ENERGY SECURITY. 

842
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:58,569
I AM CONVINCED THAT ALL OF US 

843
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:04,976
ARE GOING TO DRAW APPROPRIATE 

844
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:05,610
CONCLUSIONS FROM THESE 

845
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,711
DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE, AS I SAID, 

846
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,181
BOTH SIDES PRESENTED THEIR 

847
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:16,588
POSITIONS AND MANY, ABSOLUTELY 

848
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:16,955
MANY, ELEMENTS. 

849
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,122
THEY ARE CONCURRENT AS FAR AS 

850
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:19,290
THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION 

851
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:19,623
CURRENTLY IS. 

852
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:20,992
WHAT KIND OF STEPS NEED TO BE 

853
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,094
TAKEN IN ORDER TO PROTECT BOTH 

854
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,395
THE ISSUE OF SECURITY AND THE 

855
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:24,895
ISSUE OF INTERESTS? 

856
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:25,830
THESE ARE BUSINESS RELATED 

857
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,097
ISSUES. 

858
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,666
I AM CONVINCED THAT, LADIES AND 

859
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,134
GENTLEMEN, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE 

860
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:31,569
THE RESULTS OF BOTH OUR 

861
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,570
MEETINGS TODAY AND OF THE 

862
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,771
DECLARATION THAT WE HAVE SIGNED 

863
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,640
TOGETHER WITH MR. PRESIDENT. 

864
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,745
OF COURSE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

865
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:41,679
LONG-TERM PROCESSES SO I'M SURE 

866
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,314
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HOW 

867
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,682
THIS IS GOING TO BE FILLED WITH 

868
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:44,948
CONTENT. 

869
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:48,453
YOU WILL SEE CONCRETE FACTS 

870
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,854
THAT WILL APPEAR ON THE MAPS 

871
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,089
AND ALSO IN AGREEMENT AND IN 

872
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,257
PURCHASES THAT ARE GOING TO BE 

873
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:52,524
REALIZED. 

874
00:29:52,524 --> 00:30:08,539
>> JOHN DECKER, FOX. 

875
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:09,607
>> Reporter: THANK YOU, MR. 

876
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:09,907
PRESIDENT. 

877
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:10,441
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU. 

878
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,476
ONE ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

879
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:11,809
ONE ENTRCE. 

880
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,844
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YESTERDAY 

881
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,112
YOU SAID, WE WANT TO GO THROUGH 

882
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:14,579
A FULL PROCESS. 

883
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,014
YOU SAID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 

884
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,348
THAT EVERYTHING IS PERFECT,  

885
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:17,915
EVERYTHING IS JUST RIGHT. 

886
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:19,250
TO THAT END, WHAT WOULD BE THE 

887
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,351
PROBLEM WITH THE FBI REOPENING 

888
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,519
THEIR BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION 

889
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,556
INTO JUDGE KAVANAUGH? 

890
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:26,958
WOULD YOU SUPPORT SUCH A THING? 

891
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:27,892
>> IT WOULD NOT BOTHER ME, 

892
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,394
OTHER THAN THE FBI, JOHN SAID, 

893
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,495
THAT THEY REALLY DO NOT DO 

894
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:30,695
THAT. 

895
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,363
THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY DO. 

896
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,233
THEY HAVE DONE SUPPOSEDLY SIX 

897
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS OVER THE 

898
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,968
YEARS AS JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS 

899
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,270
GONE BEAUTIFULLY UP A LADDER. 

900
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,204
HE IS AN INCREDIBLE INDIVIDUAL, 

901
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:41,472
GREAT INTELLECT, GREAT JUDGE, 

902
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,441
IMPECCABLE HISTORY IN EVERY WAY

903
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:49,447
. IN EVERY WAY. 

904
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,915
I FEEL SO BADLY FOR HIM, THAT 

905
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,417
HE IS GOING THROUGH THIS, TO BE 

906
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:52,917
HONEST WITH YOU. 

907
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,987
I FEEL SO BADLY FOR HIM. 

908
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,089
THIS IS NOT A MAN THAT DESERVES 

909
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:58,289
THIS. 

910
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,223
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT 

911
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:07,432
TO THE FORE. IT SHOULD HAVE 

912
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,433
BEEN BROUGHT UP LONG AGO. 

913
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,667
THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE HEARINGS 

914
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:09,867
FOR. 

915
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,302
YOU DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE 

916
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,537
HEARING IS OVER AND THEN ALL OF 

917
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,705
A SUDDEN BRING IT UP WHEN 

918
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,839
DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAT WITH JUDGE 

919
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,940
KAVANAUGH FOR A LONG PERIOD OF 

920
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,609
TIME, A LONG, LONG, MEETING. 

921
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:19,377
SHE HAD THIS LETTER. 

922
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,646
WHY DID SHE NOT BRING IT UP? 

923
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,647
WHY DIDN'T SHE BRING IT UP 

924
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,448
THEN? 

925
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:29,387
WHY DIDN'T THE DEMOCRATS BRING 

926
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,188
IT UP THEN? 

927
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,255
BECAUSE THEY ABSTRACT AND THEY 

928
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:31,488
RESIST. 

929
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:32,457
THAT IS THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST 

930
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:32,623
ME. 

931
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:33,825
THEY JUST RESIST AND THEY JUST 

932
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,091
ABSTRACT. 

933
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:40,298
AND FRANKLY, I THINK THAT THEY 

934
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,432
ARE LOUSY ON POLICY AND, IN 

935
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,467
MANY WAYS, THEY ARE LOUSY 

936
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,701
POLITICIANS, BUT THEY ARE VERY 

937
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:44,234
GOOD ON OBSTRUCTION. 

938
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,137
IT IS A SHAME. 

939
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,338
BECAUSE THIS IS A GREAT 

940
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:47,638
GENTLEMAN. 

941
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:57,315
WITH ALL OF THAT, I FEEL THAT 

942
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,149
THE REPUBLICANS, AND I CAN 

943
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,317
SPEAK FOR MYSELF -- WE SHOULD 

944
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,585
GO THROUGH A PROCESS, BECAUSE 

945
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,653
THERE SHOULD NOT EVEN BE A 

946
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,422
LITTLE DOUBT, NOT A DOUBT, AND 

947
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,623
AGAIN, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE 

948
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:05,856
DOING. 

949
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:06,891
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS A 

950
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,625
LONG TIME AGO. 

951
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,259
THREE MONTHS AGO. 

952
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:08,760
NOT NOW. 

953
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,527
BUT THEY DID IT NOW. 

954
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,962
SO I DON'T WANT TO PLAY INTO 

955
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,096
THEIR HANDS. 

956
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,198
HOPEFULLY THE WOMAN WILL COME 

957
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,201
FORWARD, STATE HER CASE. 

958
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,671
HE WILL STATE HIS CASE. 

959
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:21,506
BEFORE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 

960
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:25,476
UNITED STATES SENATE. AND THEN 

961
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,210
THEY WILL VOTE. 

962
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,046
THEY WILL LOOK AT HIS CAREER. 

963
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,614
THEY WILL LOOK AT WHAT SHE HAD 

964
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,081
TO SAY. 

965
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,418
FROM 36 YEARS AGO. 

966
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:38,089
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 

967
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,691
BUT I JUST THINK THAT HE IS AT 

968
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:43,461
A LEVEL THAT WE RARELY SEEM, 

969
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,395
NOT ONLY IN GOVERNMENT, BUT 

970
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,598
ANYWHERE IN LIFE. 

971
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,767
HONESTLY, I FEEL TERRIBLY FOR 

972
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:50,234
HIM. 

973
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,203
FOR HIS WIFE. 

974
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:59,177
WHO IS AN INCREDIBLE, LOVELY 

975
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,011
WOMAN, AND FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL, 

976
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:00,778
YOUNG DAUGHTERS. 

977
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:14,692
I FEEL TERRIBLY FOR THEM. 

978
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,960
>> ON TRADE, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 

979
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,694
ANNOUNCED NEW TRADE TARIFFS 

980
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:17,528
AGAINST CHINA, AND TRADE 

981
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,563
TARIFFS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT 

982
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,931
PART OF YOUR TRADE AND ECONOMIC 

983
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:20,164
POLICY. 

984
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,265
IN YOUR FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE 

985
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,066
THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 

986
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:22,667
INCREASED BY 12%. 

987
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,968
LAST MONTH, WE SAW THE TRADE 

988
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,069
DEFICIT INCREASE TO I BELIEVE 

989
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:25,670
IT WAS $72 BILLION. 

990
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:36,180
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IS YOUR 

991
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,547
POLICY WORKING? 

992
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,248
>> WE JUST STARTED. 

993
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,649
WE DID NOT DO ANYTHING WITH 

994
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:39,517
RESPECT TO CHINA BECAUSE WE 

995
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,918
WANTED TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF 

996
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:41,919
CHINA HAVING TO DO WITH NORTH 

997
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,152
KOREA. 

998
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:46,524
THEY HAVE BEEN HELPFUL. 

999
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,658
I HOPE THEY ARE STILL HELPFUL. 

1000
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:48,860
THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 

1001
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,228
IT GOT TO A POINT WHERE THE 

1002
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,129
NUMBERS ARE TOO BIG. 

1003
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,397
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FOR 

1004
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,164
THE LAST 20 YEARS. 

1005
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:58,436
IF YOU LOOK AT THE WTO, WORLD 

1006
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,437
TRADE ORGANIZATION, THAT IS 

1007
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,438
WHEN CHINA HAPPENED LIKE A 

1008
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,405
ROCKET SHIP, BECAUSE THEY TOOK 

1009
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:02,440
ADVANTAGE OF THE RULES OF THE 

1010
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,707
WTO. 

1011
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,808
WHOEVER WAS STANDING AT THIS 

1012
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:04,909
PODIUM IN THIS INCREDIBLE WHITE 

1013
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,144
HOUSE IN THE OVAL OFFICE -- 

1014
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:06,944
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING 

1015
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:12,416
ABOUT THIS LONG AGO. 

1016
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:13,417
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS, 

1017
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,886
CHINA HAS TAKEN OUT OF THIS 

1018
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:19,290
COUNTRY $500 BILLION AND MORE. 

1019
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:19,857
 

1020
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:20,257
$500 BILLION. 

1021
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:21,592
THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY FOR 

1022
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:22,193
POLAND, WOULDN'T IT? 

1023
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,463
REBUILD YOUR WHOLE COUNTRY. 

1024
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,664
THAT IS WHAT CHINA DID. 

1025
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,167
THEY REBUILT THEIR COUNTRY WITH 

1026
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,168
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY 

1027
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,502
POURING OUT OF THE UNITED 

1028
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,402
STATES. 

1029
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:34,804
I HAVE CHANGED THAT AROUND. 

1030
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:45,283
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON.

1031
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,851
OUR MARKET IS GOING UP LIKE A 

1032
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,452
ROCKET SHIP AND I DO NOT WANT 

1033
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:49,654
THEIR MARKET TO GO DOWN BUT 

1034
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,755
THEIR MARKET IS DOWN 32% IN 

1035
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,789
THREE MONTHS BECAUSE WE CANNOT 

1036
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,123
LET THEM DO ANYMORE WHAT THEY 

1037
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:53,591
HAVE DONE. 

1038
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,158
I WATCHED TRADE DEFICITS, 

1039
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,359
BECAUSE TO ME, DEFICITS ARE 

1040
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:55,659
IMPORTANT. 

1041
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,427
THEY ARE NOT EVERYTHING AND 

1042
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,428
THEY ARE NOT EXACT. 

1043
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,429
SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE A 

1044
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,030
DEFICIT THAT IS NOT SUCH A BAD 

1045
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,731
THING. 

1046
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:01,899
WHEN YOU HAVE $375 BILLION IN 

1047
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,602
TRADE DEFICITS AND THEN MANY 

1048
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,839
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND OTHER 

1049
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:09,740
LIABILITIES OF ALL DIFFERENT 

1050
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,875
TYPES, YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 

1051
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:11,375
ABOUT IT. 

1052
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,178
WE ARE THE PIGGY BANK TO THE 

1053
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:14,612
WORLD. 

1054
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:19,817
WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY CHINA

1055
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,085
. WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY, 

1056
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,120
EXCUSE ME, MR. PRESIDENT, THE 

1057
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,055
EUROPEAN UNION, OF WHICH YOU 

1058
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:24,755
ARE A PART OF. 

1059
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,190
>> [ LAUGHTER ] 

1060
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,560
>> WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY 

1061
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,198
EVERYBODY. 

1062
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,533
I WANT TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN 

1063
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,200
WORKER, THE AMERICAN FARMER, 

1064
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,134
THE RANCHERS, THE COMPANIES, 

1065
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:47,445
AND WE ARE NOT BEING RIPPED 

1066
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:47,645
OFF. 

1067
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,013
YOU WILL SEE IN A LITTLE WHILE. 

1068
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,114
SPEAKING OF THAT, WE HAVE COME 

1069
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,449
TO A CONCLUSION WITH MEXICO BUT 

1070
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,650
WE HAVE A WONDERFUL DEAL FOR 

1071
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,017
BOTH PARTIES. 

1072
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,185
IT WAS A VERY ONE-SIDED DEAL. 

1073
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,953
NOW IT IS A GOOD DEAL FOR BOTH 

1074
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:56,219
PARTIES. 

1075
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:57,255
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT. 

1076
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,657
THE NEW PRESIDENT HAD 

1077
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:11,535
CONVERSATION, AND IT WAS 

1078
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:11,802
TERRIFIC. 

1079
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:12,970
I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO 

1080
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,971
HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 

1081
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:14,538
WE WILL SEE. 

1082
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:15,373
WE WILL SEE. 

1083
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,641
WE WANT HELP ON THE BORDER 

1084
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,508
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE WORST 

1085
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,543
IMMIGRATION LAWS IN THE HISTORY 

1086
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,443
OF MAN OR WOMEN KIND. 

1087
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,411
WE HAVE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 

1088
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:20,844
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 

1089
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:21,512
WE WANT HELP. 

1090
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,680
WE HAVE COME TO A CONCLUSION 

1091
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,147
WITH MEXICO. 

1092
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,015
CANADA HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 

1093
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,283
HER COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME. 

1094
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:25,782
WE LOVE CANADA. 

1095
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:26,584
WE LOVE IT. 

1096
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,719
WE LOVE THE PEOPLE OF CANADA. 

1097
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,054
BUT THEY ARE IN A POSITION THAT 

1098
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,455
IS NOT A GOOD POSITION FOR 

1099
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:31,688
CANADA. 

1100
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:32,490
THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO CHARGE 

1101
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,958
US 300% TARIFF ON DAIRY 

1102
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:34,525
PRODUCTS. 

1103
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:46,137
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. 

1104
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:46,804
THERE IS A PROCESS. 

1105
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:47,738
IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME. 

1106
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,939
THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD NOT 

1107
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:49,607
TALK TO US. 

1108
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,574
THEY WOULD NOT TALK TO 

1109
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:50,974
PRESIDENT OBAMA. 

1110
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:52,243
THEY WOULD NOT EVEN TALK TO 

1111
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:52,843
HIM. 

1112
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,846
THEN I SAID, THAT IS OKAY. 

1113
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,315
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TALK TO ME. 

1114
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,516
JEAN-CLAUDE IS A TOUGH MAN. 

1115
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,517
IS A VERY GOOD MAN. 

1116
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,851
I LIKE HIM, BUT HE IS TOUGH. 

1117
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,586
HE IS NASTY IS THE KIND OF GUY 

1118
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:03,921
THAT I WANT NEGOTIATING FOR ME, 

1119
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,289
BUT HE IS A TOUGH, TOUGH, 

1120
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:13,998
COOKIE. 

1121
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,633
AND I SAID TO HIM, WE HAVE TO 

1122
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,434
RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL. 

1123
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,301
HE SAID, BUT MR. PRESIDENT, WE 

1124
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,603
ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE DEAL. 

1125
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,904
WE DO NOT WANT TO RENEGOTIATE. 

1126
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,405
I SAID, YOU MIGHT BE HAPPY WITH 

1127
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,606
THE DEAL BUT I AM NOT HAPPY 

1128
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:23,174
WITH THE DEAL. 

1129
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:29,413
HE DID NOT WANT TO RENEGOTIATE. 

1130
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,514
AFTER THREE TIMES, HE STILL DID 

1131
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,449
NOT WANT TO RENEGOTIATE. 

1132
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,516
I SAID, THAT IS OKAY. 

1133
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,784
WE DO NOT HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE 

1134
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:34,084
ANY LONGER. 

1135
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:35,653
WE ARE GOING TO PUT A TARIFF ON 

1136
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:36,954
ALL OF THE MILLIONS OF CARS 

1137
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,322
THAT YOU SEND INTO THAN I DID 

1138
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:38,555
STATES. 

1139
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:39,657
HONESTLY, HE WAS IN MY OFFICE 

1140
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,891
SO QUICKLY FROM EUROPE THAT I 

1141
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,928
DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY HAD 

1142
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,196
AIRPLANES THAT FLEW SO FAST. 

1143
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,364
I SAID, WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS 

1144
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:46,697
AIRPLANE? 

1145
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,399
WE HAVE THE SEMBLANCE OF A 

1146
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,201
DEAL. 

1147
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,737
BECAUSE IT IS, TO A LARGE 

1148
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,437
EXTENT, ECONOMICALLY ALL ABOUT 

1149
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:53,637
CARS. 

1150
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:57,875
CARS ARE A VERY BIG FACTOR. 

1151
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:58,976
THEY SENT MILLIONS OF BMWS AND 

1152
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:06,550
MERCEDES INTO OUR COUNTRY. 

1153
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,752
WE ARE WORKING ON TRADE VERY 

1154
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:07,952
HARD. 

1155
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,186
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. 

1156
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,588
HAS BEEN FOR 30 YEARS BUT I 

1157
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,489
HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR THREE 

1158
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,356
YEARS, STARTING WITH JAPAN. 

1159
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,691
I TALKED ABOUT JAPAN. 

1160
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,560
I WAS RIGHT. 

1161
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,194
I TALKED ABOUT CHINA. 

1162
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:17,795
I WAS RIGHT. 

1163
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,929
THAT IS WHAT I DO. 

1164
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,197
I LIKE DOING IT, BUT I LIKE 

1165
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,365
DOING IT FOR THE PEOPLE. 

1166
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,366
BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN 

1167
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,734
ABUSED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 

1168
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:31,442
BY VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY THAT 

1169
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,710
IT DOES BUSINESS WITH AND WE 

1170
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,644
ARE JUST NOT LETTING THAT 

1171
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,678
HAPPEN ANYMORE, AND THAT 

1172
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:35,513
INCLUDES WHAT I SAID PREVIOUSLY 

1173
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:36,046
ABOUT THE MILITARY. 

1174
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:36,914
PLEASE. 

1175
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:41,952
>> Reporter:  PRESIDENT, 

1176
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:42,920
WELCOME BACK TO THE USA. 

1177
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,155
AS IT RELATES TO THE U.S. AND 

1178
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,289
EU RELATIONS, AS THE PRESIDENT 

1179
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,490
MENTIONED, YOU ARE -- POLAND IS 

1180
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,657
A PROUD MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN 

1181
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:48,058
UNION. 

1182
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:53,864
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE U.S. AND 

1183
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:54,498
EU RELATIONS RIGHT NOW? 

1184
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,700
úDID YO 

1185
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,133
THAT RELATIONSHIP? 

1186
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,234
DID YOU CARRY A SPECIAL MESSAGE 

1187
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,670
TO THE PRESIDENT? 

1188
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:16,820
>> SIR, I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY, 

1189
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,222
IF IT WAS POLAND IT WHICH WOULD 

1190
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,423
DISRUPTED THAT TRADE BALANCE OF 

1191
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:19,856
THE UNITED STATES. 

1192
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:21,359
I REALLY WOULD BE HAPPY IF THAT 

1193
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:21,926
WAS THE CASE. 

1194
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:22,860
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING AS FAR 

1195
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,961
AS POLAND POLITICS IS CONCERNED 

1196
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,296
AND CARING FOR THE MATTERS OF 

1197
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,297
YOUR COUNTRY, IS SIMILAR TO THE 

1198
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,665
VIEW OF PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT IS 

1199
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,933
SAYING AMERICA FIRST AND I AM 

1200
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:29,800
SAYING POLAND FIRST SO WE 

1201
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,601
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER VERY 

1202
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,035
WELL. 

1203
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,236
IT IS HARD FOR ME TO BE 

1204
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,604
SURPRISED OF THE FACT THAT MR. 

1205
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,939
PRESIDENT, BEING A VERY 

1206
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:54,058
EXPERIENCED MAN, A MAN OF 

1207
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,259
SUCCESS, AS FAR AS BUSINESS IS 

1208
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:55,826
CONCERNED, KNOWS HOW TO 

1209
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:56,927
CALCULATE HE KNOWS HOW TO 

1210
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:57,227
CALCULATE. 

1211
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:58,529
I THINK THAT NOBODY PUTS OUT 

1212
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:59,897
INTO QUESTION IN THE U.S. OR IN 

1213
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,731
ANOTHER PLACE, AND HE TAKES 

1214
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,132
CARE OF THE UNITED STATES AND 

1215
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:03,601
IT LIES IN THE INTEREST OF THE 

1216
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,735
COUNTRY TO HAVE A BALANCED 

1217
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,603
TRADE EXCHANGE AND THIS IS 

1218
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:06,604
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE 

1219
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:07,071
CARE OF. 

1220
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,639
OF COURSE THERE IS A CLASH OF 

1221
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:08,905
INTEREST. 

1222
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:09,840
HOWEVER, OBJECT LEE LOOKING, IT 

1223
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,174
IS HARD NOT TO UNDERSTAND IT. 

1224
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:12,176
THERE IS ALWAYS COMPETITION UP 

1225
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,177
INTEREST, AND EVERY BUSINESS IS 

1226
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:13,944
A COMPETITION OF INTEREST. 

1227
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:14,577
I REPRESENT POLISH INTEREST 

1228
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:15,880
WHEREAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1229
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,580
REPRESENTS AMERICAN INTEREST. 

1230
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,915
ON IMPORTANT MATTERS YOU HAVE 

1231
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,916
TO STRIKE AN AGREEMENT TO MAKE 

1232
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,017
SURE THAT BOTH COUNTRIES WIN 

1233
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,151
AND LOSE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE 

1234
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:22,119
AND THEN WE HAVE AN 

1235
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:22,920
UNDERSTANDING, AGREEMENT, AND 

1236
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,154
THAT WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE 

1237
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:25,956
COOPERATING WITH EACH OTHER ON 

1238
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:26,790
EQUAL LEVEL. 

1239
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,425
I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE KIND 

1240
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:29,059
OF COOPERATION THAT MR. 

1241
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,394
PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 

1242
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:30,927
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 

1243
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:32,263
IT WOULD BE HARD TO BE 

1244
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:32,963
SURPRISED WITH THAT. 

1245
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,131
I AM LISTENING CALMLY TO THAT 

1246
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,566
AND I WOULD LIKE POLAND TO BE 

1247
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:39,003
SUCH A COUNTRY, SUCH AN 

1248
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:39,870
ECONOMIC SUPERPOWER THAT IT 

1249
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,838
WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT PART 

1250
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,206
INTO THE UNITED STATES. 

1251
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:49,813
I SAID JOKINGLY IN THE 

1252
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:51,048
BEGINNING THAT I WISH THAT IT 

1253
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,116
WAS POLAND WHICH DISTURBED THE 

1254
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,284
TRADE BOUNDS OF THE UNITED 

1255
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,418
STATES AND THE EXPORTS OF THE 

1256
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:55,319
UNITED STATES BUT I BELIEVE 

1257
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,153
THAT OUR COOPERATION WILL 

1258
00:40:56,153 --> 00:41:00,824
DEVELOP WELL ON PARTNERS AND 

1259
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:01,124
PRINCIPALS. 

1260
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:02,126
>> THE TRADE DEAL WITH SOUTH 

1261
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,060
KOREA HAS BEEN FULLY 

1262
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,827
RENEGOTIATED AND IT IS READY 

1263
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:04,662
FOR THE SIGNATURE. 

1264
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,696
WE MAY SIGN IT AT UNITED 

1265
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:09,633
NATIONS OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER. 

1266
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,201
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DEAL FOR THE 

1267
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:11,634
UNITED STATES. 

1268
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:12,669
NOW IT IS A FAIR DEAL. 

1269
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:13,637
THAT HAS BEEN FULLY 

1270
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,237
RENEGOTIATED IN ADDITION TO 

1271
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:15,573
MEXICO AND SOME OF THE OTHERS 

1272
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,840
THAT ARE VERY CLOSE BUT THANK 

1273
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,508
YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 

1274
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,142
WE APPRECIATE YOU. 

1275
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:18,709
THANK YOU. 

1276
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:26,484
>> THANK YOU.

1277
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,189
>> Reporter: DO YOU BELIEVE 

1278
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:43,500
HER, SIR?  

1279
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,035
>>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

1280
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:45,870
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING A JOINT 

1281
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,870
NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE 

1282
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,337
PRESIDENT OF POLAND. 

1283
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:48,038
HE MENTIONED BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

1284
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,540
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT BY A 

1285
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,074
FOX NEWS REPORTER. 

1286
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:55,880
AFTER ALL OF THAT, HE, IN FACT, 

1287
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,281
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE CABIN OR, 

1288
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,148
IF THE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD BE 

1289
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,283
HEARD, HE SAID THAT IT WOULD 

1290
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,818
BOTHER ME BUT THE FBI SAID THAT 

1291
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:01,685
THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT. 

1292
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,853
THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT ABOUT 

1293
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:18,302
LAUNCHING THE FBI INVESTIGATION.

1294
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,703
HE DID SAY, WHY DID THE 

1295
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,571
DEMOCRATS BRING IT UP? 

1296
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,405
THEY RESIST AND OBSTRUCT. 

1297
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,606
HE SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE 

1298
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,507
EVEN LITTLE DOUBT, NOT EVEN 

1299
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,475
DOUBT, TALKING ABOUT MOVING 

1300
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,175
FORWARD ON THE NOMINATION. 

1301
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,544
WITH THIS JUDGE BUT I WANT TO 

1302
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,444
BRING IN THE WASHINGTON 

1303
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,512
CORRESPONDENT PAULA REID WHO IS 

1304
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,246
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 

1305
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,781
I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON 

1306
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,116
THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION TO THE 

1307
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,051
BRETT KAVANAUGH ACCUSATIONS. 

1308
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,319
>> HE IS SUBDUED AND HE IS 

1309
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,286
EMBRACING THE PROCESS AND 

1310
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:36,619
TRANSPARENCY. 

1311
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:37,821
HE WAS ASKED IF THE FBI SHOULD 

1312
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:38,756
DO INVESTIGATION INTO THE 

1313
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:38,989
CLAIM. 

1314
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,124
AT THIS POINT THAT I PUT THIS 

1315
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:55,039
IN HIS BACKGROUND CHECK FOLDER. 

1316
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,440
AS THE PRESIDENT NOTED, THIS IS 

1317
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,441
NOT WHAT THE FBI DOES. 

1318
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,542
THIS IS NOT A FEDERAL CRIME. 

1319
00:42:58,542 --> 00:42:59,710
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE 

1320
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,078
HANDLED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO 

1321
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,312
IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE THE FBI 

1322
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:03,580
IS GOING TO OPEN A FORMAL 

1323
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,548
INVESTIGATION OF THE PRESIDENT, 

1324
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:05,048
ONCE AGAIN, CRITICIZING 

1325
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:06,150
DEMOCRATS FOR NOT BRINGING THE 

1326
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,650
ISSUE UP SOONER. 

1327
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,851
HE ALSO SAID THAT HE SUPPORTS 

1328
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:08,919
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND THINKS THAT 

1329
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:09,553
HE IS EXTRAORDINARY. 

1330
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,055
HE SAID THAT IF HE -- HE FEELS 

1331
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:12,456
 

1332
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,323
CONTINUED TO VERY CALMLY 

1333
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:13,991
SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY AND A 

1334
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:14,792
PROCESS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR 

1335
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:15,959
THIS WOMAN TO BE HEARD, WHICH 

1336
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:16,427
IS INTERESTING. 

1337
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,895
HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY OVER A 

1338
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:18,595
DOZEN WOMEN OF SEXUAL 

1339
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:19,430
MISCONDUCT AND HAS NEVER 

1340
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,597
SUPPORTED THE SAME KIND OF OPEN 

1341
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:21,498
PROCESS FOR THAT. 

1342
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,533
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE 

1343
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:33,243
REPUBLICAN SENATORS SAYING THAT 

1344
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,178
DR. FORD CAN TESTIFY PUBLICLY 

1345
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:34,578
OR PRIVATELY. 

1346
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:35,846
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT 

1347
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:36,046
THAT? 

1348
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,281
TRY WHAT I DID NOT LEARN 

1349
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,015
ANYTHING FROM THIS PRESS 

1350
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:38,315
CONFERENCE. 

1351
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,183
BEFORE THIS STARTED, IT SEEMED 

1352
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,184
TO BE AN OPEN QUESTION. 

1353
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,985
HER ATTORNEY WAS TRYING TO PUT 

1354
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:43,053
SOME LIMITATION ON THE EXTENT 

1355
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,021
TO WHICH SHE WOULD BE ASKED 

1356
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:44,555
ABOUT THIS. 

1357
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,456
I KNOW THAT YESTERDAY, 

1358
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,356
KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID ON BEHALF 

1359
00:43:46,356 --> 00:43:47,458
OF THE WHITE HOUSE THAT SHE 

1360
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,093
BELIEVES THE ACCUSER SHOULD BE 

1361
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,828
HEARD PUBLIC. SHE ALSO SAID 

1362
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:51,862
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE 

1363
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,363
ABLE TO TESTIFY BUT WAS NOT A 

1364
00:43:53,363 --> 00:43:54,298
SPECIFIC ABOUT IF THE WHITE 

1365
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,232
HOUSE WAS ENCOURAGING HIS 

1366
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,066
TESTIMONY TO BE PUBLIC. 

1367
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,468
AT THIS POINT WE EXPECT BOTH OF 

1368
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,969
THEM TO TESTIFY PUBLICLY IN 

1369
00:43:58,969 --> 00:43:59,937
ORDER TO SUPPORT WHAT THE 

1370
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,105
PRESIDENT WANTS, WHICH IS NOT 

1371
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,206
TO LEAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE 

1372
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:02,539
ACCUSATIONS. 

1373
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:34,705
CONNECT THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT 

1374
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,073
IF THIS MATTER IS NOT SOMETHING 

1375
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,174
THAT THE FBI LOOKS INTO. 

1376
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:37,607
IS THAT CORRECT? 

1377
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:38,575
TRY ONE THAT IS TRUE. 

1378
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,309
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, SEXUAL 

1379
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,277
CRIMES, ALLEGATIONS OF ANY SUCH 

1380
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,612
THING IS USUALLY HANDLED AT THE 

1381
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,412
STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. 

1382
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:43,313
THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS WHEN 

1383
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,348
IT COMES TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING 

1384
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,716
BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE FBI 

1385
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:46,516
WOULD NOT INVESTIGATE SOMETHING 

1386
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:47,117
LIKE THIS. 

1387
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,018
HOWEVER, THEY HANDLE IT IN 

1388
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:48,986
TERMS OF HIS BACKGROUND CHECK. 

1389
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,187
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH HALF A 

1390
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:50,921
DOZEN OF THOSE. 

1391
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,289
WHAT THE FBI SAID IS WHEN THEY 

1392
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,457
LEARNED OF THIS, THEY PUT THE 

1393
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,925
INFORMATION IN HIS FILE FOR HIS 

1394
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:55,325
BACKGROUND CHECK. 

1395
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,527
THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT THEY'RE 

1396
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,127
GOING TO INVESTIGATE BECAUSE 

1397
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,328
THERE IS NO ALLEGATION OF A 

1398
00:44:58,328 --> 00:44:58,728
FEDERAL CRIME. 

1399
00:44:58,728 --> 00:44:59,763
SOMETHING THAT IS HANDLED AT 

1400
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:00,397
THE STATE LEVEL. 

1401
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,899
>> EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT LOOK 

1402
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,433
LIKE THE FBI WILL TAKE THIS UP 

1403
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:04,401
AT THIS HOUR, THIS PUBLIC 

1404
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:05,368
HEARING OR PRIVATE, HOWEVER IT 

1405
00:45:05,368 --> 00:45:06,570
MIGHT BE ON MONDAY -- SENATOR 

1406
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,438
FEINSTEIN CAME FORWARD THING 

1407
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,739
THAT THERE MUST BE MORE THAN 

1408
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,040
JUST A JUDGE AND THE DR. FORD. 

1409
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,542
DO YOU THINK THAT OPENING UP TO 

1410
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,776
PERHAPS THE JUDGE THAT DR. FORD 

1411
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,077
SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE 

1412
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:15,512
IN THE ROOM AT THE MOMENT OR 

1413
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:26,990
EVEN HER OWN PSYCHOLOGIST? 

1414
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,358
TRY WHEN I THINK THAT THE MORE 

1415
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,660
PEOPLE THAT YOU BRING IN, THE 

1416
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,194
MORE CIRCUS LIKE IT WILL BE A. 

1417
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:32,195
IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT THE CALL 

1418
00:45:32,195 --> 00:45:33,764
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN FROM 

1419
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,965
A LOT OF PEOPLE IS HOW THESE 

1420
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:35,899
TWO PEOPLE,, SHARE PUBLICLY 

1421
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,767
THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY. 

1422
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:37,935
THIS IS NOT A TRIAL. 

1423
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,036
NO ONE WILL BE CHARGED. 

1424
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,504
THIS IS IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC 

1425
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,705
OPINION AND PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR 

1426
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:42,673
THE STORY AND HIS DEFENSE. 

1427
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,707
ONCE YOU START BRINGING PEOPLE 

1428
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,274
PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS AND 

1429
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,375
PSYCHIATRISTS IN, THINGS GET A 

1430
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:45,808
LITTLE COMPLICATED. 

1431
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:46,777
AS YOU KNOW FROM COVERING LOTS 

1432
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:47,811
OF HEARINGS, THE HEARINGS ARE 

1433
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:48,479
ALREADY COMPLICATED AND 

1434
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,346
CONSISTENT AS IT IS. 

1435
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,647
>> ANY SENSE OF WHERE THE 

1436
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:51,882
ACCUSATION IS GOING AT THIS 

1437
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:57,754
POINT? 

1438
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,156
CAN WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT IS 

1439
00:45:59,156 --> 00:45:59,957
HAPPENING WITH THE HEARING. 

1440
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,258
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY WE 

1441
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,426
THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE TAKEN 

1442
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,194
CARE OF IN THE HEARING AND WE 

1443
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:04,962
WOULD HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES 

1444
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,430
ANOTHER WOULD BE A VOTE IN THE 

1445
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:06,763
WEEK. 

1446
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:07,931
AT THIS POINT, WE DO NOT KNOW. 

1447
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,066
IT IS STILL IN QUESTION. 

1448
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,200
IF IT WILL BE PUBLIC OR 

1449
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,601
PRIVATE. 

1450
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:25,048
THE EXTENT TO WHICH SHE WILL BE 

1451
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,183
OR THAT HER LAWYER WILL PREVAIL 

1452
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,084
AND PUT RESTRICTIONS ON THE 

1453
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,118
KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT SHE 

1454
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:28,385
ASKED'S. 

1455
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,620
AT THIS POINT IF SHE BECOMES 

1456
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,854
THE ONLY ACCUSER TO COME 

1457
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:31,722
HOWARD, THIS IS AN ACCUSATION, 

1458
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:32,789
ALTHOUGH SERIOUS, FROM ABOUT 35 

1459
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,190
YEARS AGO. 

1460
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,590
HE DENIES IT. 

1461
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,791
IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE 

1462
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,959
SOMETHING AT THIS POINT THAT 

1463
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:36,927
WOULD PUT HIS CONFIRMATION IN 

1464
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:37,194
JEOPARDY. 

1465
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,662
THAT IS PART OF WHY THE WHITE 

1466
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,696
HOUSE HAS BEEN EMBRACING THEIR 

1467
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,397
TRANSPARENCY PROCESS AND THEY 

1468
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,165
SEEM CONFIDENT THAT HE WILL BE 

1469
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:42,799
CONFIRMED BUT THEY DO NOT WANT 

1470
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:43,967
TO LEAVE ANY SORT OF INDICATION 

1471
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,235
THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO TAMP 

1472
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,370
THINGS DOWN OR HIDE ANYTHING. 

1473
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,638
THEY DO NOT WANT PEOPLE IN THE 

1474
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,539
PUBLIC TO HAVE DOUBTS. 

1475
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,973
AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE TO SEE 

1476
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:50,374
WHAT HAPPENS. 

1477
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:51,742
I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO MAKE 

1478
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,342
PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT WILL 

1479
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,210
HAPPEN IN THIS TOWN. 

1480
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:53,777
>> WELL SAID. 

1481
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:54,945
PAULA REID, COMING TO US FROM 

1482
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:55,645
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1483
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:56,213
THANK YOU. 

1484
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,514
