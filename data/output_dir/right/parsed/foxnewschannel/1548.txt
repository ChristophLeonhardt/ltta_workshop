DISASTER.
THIS IS "SPECIAL REPORT" ."
GOOD EVENING.
I'M BRET BAIER.
WE ARE COMING TO YOU TONIGHT
FROM THE RICHARD NIXON
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN
YORBA LINDA CALIFORNIA.
PART OF A TWO WEEK TOUR.
WHAT COULD BE A MAJOR STEP
BACKWARD IN THE EFFORT TO
ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF
NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS
PROGRAM.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THERE'S A
GOOD CHANCE NEXT MONTH'S PLANNED
SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN WILL NOT
HAPPEN ON SCHEDULE.
THE PRESIDENT INDICATING TODAY
THE MEETING WILL EITHER BE ON
HIS TERMS OR IT WON'T HAPPEN AT
ALL.
AND IT COULD VERY WELL BE
DELAYED AS A POSSIBILITY.
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT
JOHN ROBERTS STARTS US OFF FROM
THE NORTH LAWN TONIGHT WITH
WHERE THE SUMMITS PROSPECTS ARE.
GOOD EVENING.
>> GOOD EVENING.
IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY,
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THE CHANCES
OF A SUMMIT BETWEEN HIM AND
NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN
IS BASICALLY A COIN FLIP.
50/50, THE PRESIDENT SAID.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS STILL MAKING
PLANS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY
STATED THAT THE SUMMIT WITH
KIM JONG UN MAY HAPPEN.
IT MAY NOT HAPPEN.
WE WILL SEE.
IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY WITH
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON
JAE-IN, THE PRESIDENT WENT
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO
PESSIMISM THAT HE HAS THUS FAR.
>> VERY SUBSTANTIAL CHANCE THAT
IT WON'T WORK OUT AND THAT'S
OKAY.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T WORK
OUT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME BUT IT
MAY NOT WORK OUT FOR JUNE 12.
SPEAK WITH THE PRESIDENT'S
REMARKS FLEW IN THE FACE OF THE
SOUTH KOREAN NATIONAL SECURITY
ADVISOR WHO SAID JUST HOURS
EARLIER THERE WAS A 99% CHANCE
THE MEETING WILL HAPPEN.
LATER THIS AFTERNOON, SECRETARY
OF STATE MIKE POMPEO SAID THE
STATE DEPARTMENT IS STILL
WORKING FOR THE JUNE 12 DATE AND
THAT THE U.S. IS IN DEEP
DISCUSSIONS WITH NORTH KOREA
OVER SUBSTANCE.
>> WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE
THERE IS A COMMON UNDERSTANDING
OF THE CONTENTS DISCUSSED BUT I
AM OPTIMISTIC.
AGAIN, THIS COULD BE SOMETHING
THAT COMES RIGHT TO THE END.
>> TODAY NORTH KOREA INVITED
JOURNALISTS TO ITS NUCLEAR TEST
SITE WHICH NORTH KOREA SAYS IS
BEING DECOMMISSIONED.
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE SITE
WAS EVEN USABLE AFTER THE LAST
NUCLEAR TEST REPORTEDLY
COLLAPSED TUNNELS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP REPEATED TODAY
THAT KIM WILL RECEIVE
PROTECTIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR
DISMANTLING HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
>> WE WILL GUARANTEE SAFETY AND
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT FROM
THE BEGINNING.
HE WILL BE SAFE.
HE WILL BE HAPPY.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPRESSED
FRUSTRATION THAT NORTH KOREA'S
RECENT SQUISHING US ABOUT A
SUMMIT SEEMED TO COINCIDE WITH A
SECOND MEETING KIM HAD WITH
CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING ON
MAY 8.
>> THE SECOND MEETING, I THINK
THERE WAS A LITTLE CHANGE IN
ATTITUDE FROM KIM JONG UN.
SO I DON'T LIKE THAT.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID
HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH HOW TRADE
TALKS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA
HAVE BEEN GOING.
DESPITE TWEETING THAT CHINA HAS
AGREED TO BUY MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF
ADDITIONAL FARM AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST
THINGS TO HAPPEN TO OUR FARMERS
AND MANY YEARS.
THE PRESIDENT INSISTS HE HAS NOT
CUT A DEAL TO SAVE CHINESE
TELECOM GIANT ZTE, THOUGH HE HAS
SOME IDEAS TO KEEP THEM IN
BUSINESS.
>> I ENVISION A VERY LARGE FIND
OF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS.
COULD BE A BILLION .3.
I ENVISION NEW MANAGEMENT, NEW
BOARD, VERY STRICT SECURITY
RULES AND I ENVISION THEY HAVE
TO BUY A BIG PERCENTAGE OF THEIR
PARTS AND EQUIPMENT FROM
AMERICAN COMPANIES.
>> TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN
MNUCHIN WAS PUMMELED WITH
QUESTIONS ABOUT ZTE ON
CAPITOL HILL TODAY.
AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE SENATE
MINORITY LEADER CAME AWAY
WORRYING THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL
GO SOFT ON ZTE TO KEEP
XI JINPING HAPPY.
>> WE ARE PRESSING THE PRESIDENT
TO STAND FIRM, NOT TO LET ZTE
WRIGGLE OUT FROM UNDER THE TOUGH
SANCTIONS WE LEVELED ON THEM.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD SOME
IDEAS TODAY OF HOW HE SEES THE
LONG GAME WITH NORTH KOREA.
IN THE SHORT TERM, THE PRESIDENT
ENVISIONS TWO KOREA'S PROSPEROUS
AND LIVING IN PEACEFUL
COEXISTENCE.
HE DID SAY HE WOULD ULTIMATELY
LIKE TO SEE A REUNIFIED KOREAN
PENINSULA BUT ONLY IF THE TWO
COUNTRIES WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN.
NO IMPOSITION OF SUCH AN IDEA
FROM THE UNITED STATES.
