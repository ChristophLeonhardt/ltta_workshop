People meet me and
they think, “Oh, my God.
Like, I — I had no idea.
I thought you were from
a different country.”
If it comes up, someone
asks, “Where are you from?”
And I say, “New York.”
They say, “No, no.
"But where are
you really from?”
I usually let them talk
and figure me out first.
And figure them out first.
And also, I just think
it’s very awkward to be,
“Hi, my name is
Becca, I’m deaf.”
This is the cochlear implant
that I use to hear with.
It’s got a magnet.
It’s got the part that
goes behind my ear.
And here’s the microphone.
Here are the volumes.
The sound is transferred
through the wire
here and then into this coil.
And then it goes through
the skin on my head.
And then into the computer
chip that is inside my head.
And then through
the electrode array
that is wired
into the cochlear.
And then the sound, once it
gets through the cochlear,
it sends a signal
to the brain.
And then, I guess, to
the side is generally
what it looks like.
And here’s my right side.
And then, generally,
when I do my hairstyles,
I try to keep my coils,
my magnets hidden.
So, what you’ll find is
that when I take it off,
the longer I keep it off for,
the more my deaf disability
comes out.
My voice becomes
more monotone.
And it becomes more
difficult to think
about what I’m saying.
The only reason that
I know what I’m saying
is because I feel the
vibrations of my voice
speaking to the camera.
When I take my
cochlear implants off,
I cannot hear a single sound.
Not even the loudest sound.
It’s a complete 100% silence.
When I have it off,
I am a little insecure
about what I’m saying
and how I sound.
Because I know it
sounds different.
And — but the second I put it on, 
I find that my voice
goes back to normal.
Hiding it means that we
can present ourselves
for ourselves,
rather than putting
our disability first.
But we aren’t hearing-impaired people.
We just have hearing loss.
Well, we’re deaf.
No.
We have hearing loss.
No, I really do —
I really do want to
say that I’m deaf
and that I’m not
hearing impaired.
Because I think
it gives people
a different perception.
And I want to give people a
different perception of what
being deaf really means.
When I first started,
it wasn’t the same.
I remember having a
box on my chest that
was under my shirt.
And each different device
and how much it changed.
Kids started
noticing that I had
something different about me.
I still had a body aid.
It was about this big
and it went directly
across my chest.
There was no way to
hide any of this.
So I had almost
like suspenders on me
with the giant ear molds
going into my ears.
I mean, there was
no way around it.
I was different.
I don’t actually
remember doing this.
But apparently,
my mom told me I
used to act as
though it were a radio.
Even though there was
no music coming in.
So that was my first piece
of equipment in school.
I don’t remember it
ever being a problem,
other than I can’t be in
a water balloon fight,
was pretty much
the extent of it.
Which was disappointing,
but, you know, I managed.
When I was little, I hated
the hearing tests a lot.
I hated them because it was
having to sit in a room
and be forced to
acknowledge that there’s
something I’m not good at.
And that there’s something
that’s … harder for me.
And it sucks to spend an
hour or two hours, however
much time, to be,
over and over and over,
every beep, every word, reminded
that you’re not doing well.
I am not somebody
who fails tests.
Things got difficult for
me when I started to excel.
And the mainstream kids
who weren’t excelling
couldn’t understand why
they weren’t and I was.
And that’s when things
started to shift.
That yes, I’m different.
Yes, I have trouble hearing.
So therefore, I’m not
supposed to do as well.
I tried so hard to be,
quote, unquote, “normal.”
I just didn’t want people to
know I had a hearing loss.
It’s been something
I’ve dealt with pretty
much my whole life.
Trying to get people to not
know I have a hearing loss.
And I would say
only recently, maybe
within the last year
or two,
have I really come out
and owned it.
The difficulty,
the real difficulty,
was when I transitioned
into the clinical years
of my medical
school education.
Because they had never
had anybody with this type
of hearing loss.
And everybody was
just kind of —
“Well, what do you
want us to do?”
Because I was so
high-functioning.
I am so high-functioning.
Most people look
at me and they
don’t see me as
needing anything extra,
see me as being any different.
So it was almost
harder for them
to have to do a double
take and say, “Wait, what?
"You need help?
"You need something different?”
When it comes time to
being intimate with someone,
it becomes a big deal.
There are certain nuances.
There are certain
things that are said.
And there are
certain instances
where I would be
completely in the dark
and completely in the unknown
if I don’t have my hearing
aid on, if I don’t
have my implant on.
And it’s a very scary
feeling for someone.
So I’m engaged now.
I’ve been engaged for
maybe a month now.
And she’s a hearing person.
When we met, I didn’t tell her
upfront that I was hearing impaired.
She tried to call me,
and I would always
have some kind of excuse.
I would say I’m
in the bathroom,
or I’m at work, or something.
I’d make up an excuse.
When we were ready
to actually become
boyfriend and
girlfriend, that’s
when I actually told her
that I’m hearing impaired.
And she was like, “Wow, that
makes a lot of sense.”
Oftentimes, other
people are more
uncomfortable with my
hearing impairment than I am.
And I understand that.
People — we live in a
society in which, you know,
you don’t look at somebody
who’s in a wheelchair.
Just because you don’t want to
make them feel uncomfortable.
You don’t say anything,
you don’t ask questions.
There are people who don’t
want to talk about it.
And I think that we’re
so afraid of being
rude that sometimes I think we
make these people invisible.
And we create a barrier
between ourselves and them.
And I wish that more
people would just ask.
There was a definitely
a period of time
that I had trouble
finding a job.
I was really unhappy.
Every once in a while, I
would get the question,
“How are you on the phone?”
And then I — employers
are not supposed
to ask you specific
questions about how
you’re able to do something.
Because that’s
discrimination if they
choose not to hire you.
And I definitely got
that question, like,
hundreds of times.
But the risk is that
they don’t know —
I don’t know when
I don’t hear.
And I can’t always
tell them that.
And the risk is — is she
going to be able to keep up?
I didn’t have to use —
oh no, my battery is dying.
— Do you have another
spare battery?
Yeah, of course I do.
Yeah.
I have a spare battery …
I keep every day.
I always have a spare
battery pack in my wallet.
I have a cochlear
implant up here.
So now I can’t hear,
the battery is out.
That’s it.
And we’re back.
I mean it’s …
technology — you
know, your phone breaks,
my hearing aid breaks, my
cochlear implant is broken —
You adapt.
A couple of weeks ago,
my cochlear implant
actually broke.
And I had texted my mom
being like, “My unit broke.”
And my mom was
like, “Your A/C broke?”
And I’m like, “No, Mom.
"My implant broke.”
And she was like,
“Your dental implant?”
And I was like, “Mom!
"My hearing aid!
"My implant.
"My cochlear implant.”
And she was like,
“Oh, I forgot.
"Sorry.”
People ask me
questions all the time,
like “Do you hear music?
"Do you hear sound?
"What do you hear?
"What does it sound like?”
I don’t think anybody
really understands
unless you live with it.
Because you can’t
replicate it.
You can’t … explain.
That first mapping
experience, it’s
a completely bewildering one.
The audiologist turned
it on, so to speak.
And I’m like, “I don’t —
"all I hear is
cracks and beeps.
"And this is not working.
"Hello?”
She’s like, “Wait a
minute, wait a minute.”
And even within the
span of 10 minutes,
something clicked into place.
It was surreal.
And I had that
weird sort of spasm
in my body when
they turned it on.
Because it’s just,
you know, life’s
being shot back into you.
I think getting my cochlear
implant was probably
one of the most emotionally
difficult times.
It was really hard.
I had just graduated
from college
and had just moved
back from L.A.
I needed to do something.
And my audiologist had made
a really good point for me.
She’d been trying to get
me to do it for years.
And she said to me —
a couple years before
that, she said,
“You’ll do it when
you feel like
"you’re missing something.
"When you feel like you’re
not getting everything
you should be getting
out of everything.”
You just have to
learn to embrace it.
I mean, I think it
took me until college
to really embrace
how cool this is,
that I can hear, and
still take it off and
be deaf at the same time.
You know, it’s something
that I’m used to.
If I do reflect on it,
I never reflect on it
in a negative way.
It’s always, you know,
"Wow, look where I am."
You know, "Look
what I’ve overcome.
"If I did this, anything
else is possible.”
