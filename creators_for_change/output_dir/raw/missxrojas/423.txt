00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,540
really nice fairways to play like dance

56
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,850
routine games and we like pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hearsay in fact my friend had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

58
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,270
themed party and we tried to do a dance

59
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,560
routine and we would play all sorts of

60
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,299
games with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite game by far as</font>

61
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,579
game put adverts which you had to pick a

<font color="#E5E5E5">that begins with that letter of the</font>

65
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,659
alphabet that was a wonderful game I

66
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,070
think we were actually quite savvy about

67
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,630
the adverts that we had in our face we

68
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,610
