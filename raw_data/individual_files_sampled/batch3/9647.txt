THESE ARE CALLED MUSICAL Kimberly: WE HAVE HEARD ENOUGH EXCUSES FROM HILLARY CLINTON AS TO WHY SHE DD HILLARY CLINTON AS TO WHY SHE D' HILLARY CLINTON AS TO WHY SHE DT WON THE WHITE HOUSE. I DIDN'T THINK THERE WERE ANY MORE LEFT. BEHOLD. THERE IS ANOTHER. HERE IS THE LATEST. YOU MAY BE THE ONLY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SINCE WORLD WAR II WOULD STAND UP AND SAY I'M A CAPITAL S, AND YOU DID. DID IT HURT YOU? PROBABLY. IT'S HARD TO KNOW. BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE IOWA CAUCUSES AND 41% OF DEMOCRATS ARE SOCIALISTS OR SELF-DESCRIBED SOCIALISTS AND I AM ASKED, ARE YOU A CAPITALIST, AND I SAY YES BUT WITH APPROPRIATE REGULATION AND WITH APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY, THAT PROBABLY GETS LOST. OH, MY GOSH SHE'S A CAPITALIST. YES, ANOTHER, ADDING THEM UP. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, GREG? I KNOW YOU GET DELIGHTED EVERY TIME HILLARY MAKES AN APPEARANCE. Greg: THIS IS ESPECIALLY HILARIOUS BECAUSE SHE'S RIGHT. A LARGE PORTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE SNIVELING SOCIALISTS. THEY ARE FOR UNIVERSAL BASED INCOME, HIGHER TAXES, GUARANTEED JOBS. IDENTITY OVER THE INDIVIDUAL. THEY WEREN'T VOTING FOR TRUMP. SHE WAS THEIR ONLY CHOICE. PARTY WOULD DISAGREE WITH HER. THEY ARE CHASING A FAILED SYSTEM. WE HAVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLITICAL ECONOMICAL SYSTEM IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE LIKE SIDESHOW BOB. THEY KEEP WALKING INTO RAKES. Kimberly: THAT WAS A GOOD SYNOPSIS. THE ANALOGY WAS GOOD. I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE THIS EXCUSE TO NUMBER ONE. IT HAS SOME CREDENCE. WELL DONE. Greg: BUT IT IS A LIE TOO. Dana: INSTRUCTIVE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2020 BECAUSE THE GROUND SHIFTED UNDER HILLARY CLINTON'S FEET FROM WHEN SHE RAN INTO THOUSAND EIGHT TO 2016. IN 2008, BERNIE SANDERS COULD NOT HAVE RUN AS AN AVOWED SOCIALIST AND WON. YOU THINK ABOUT THE POLITICS OF JFK, BILL CLINTON, EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA. EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED. I DON'T WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IN 2020 BECAUSE IF THE ECONOMY IS GOING IT'S GOING SUPER WELL NOW, CONTINUING TO 2020 PROBABLY FOR LITTLE WHILE, HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT? THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT. IF YOU LOOK AT A PLACE LIKE OHIO RIGHT NOW, IT'S A HEATED GUBERNATORIAL RACE. THE BERNIE SANDE BR THE BERNIE SANDE BI THE BERNIE SANDE B THE BERNIE SANDE BA THE BERNIE SANDE BD THE BERNIE SANDE BR THE BERNIE SANDE BS THE BERNIE SANDE BP THE BERNIE SANDE BO THE BERNIE SANDE BT THE BERNIE SANDE BR THE BERNIE SANDE B, YOU HAVE A STATE TURNING RED IN ITS MORE A REPUBLICAN WILL WIN. Kimberly: SERIOUSLY SCRIBBLING AT HOME TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER IDEA. THIS TACTIC IS NOT GOING TO WORK. YOU SAW THE GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT FOR BERNIE SANDERS, PROGRESSIVE, FORCING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO TACK FURTHER TO THE LEFT. Jesse: DEMOCRATS LIKE BERNET BECAUSE HE FIGHTS FOR THE POOR AND HE LOOKED POOR. THAT REALLY HELPED HIM. THE HAIR AND EVERYTHING. DEMOCRATS DON'T DO WELL WHEN THEY RUN REALLY WELL. GORE, JOHN KERRY, HILLARY. YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO IS A LITTLE BIT DISHEVELED AND CAN FIGHT FOR THE LITTLE GUY. CAPITALISM IS A DIRTY WORD FOR DEMOCRATS. THEY LOVE SOCIALISM BUT THEY CAN'T DEFINE IT. YOU ASK A DEMOCRAT, WHERE HAS SOCIALISM WORKED? THEY THEY CAN'T SAY. THEY WILL POINT TO SWEDEN. SWEDEN IS FINE IF YOU WANT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, IF YOU WANT TO LIVE A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. IF YOU START WITH NOTHING IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU CAN HAVE A YACHT. IN SWEDEN, THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. IN AMERICA, THERE IS UPWARD MOBILITY AND GRIT AND IT'S REWARDED. THE DEMOCRATS GET THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS OFFERING HANDOUTS INSTEAD OF HAND OPS. Kimberly: THAT WAS LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL. Greg: THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD-LOOKING POOR PEOPLE. I WAS POOR FOR A LONG TIME. Jesse: I AM STILL MORE POORER THAN YOU. AND BETTER LOOKING. Greg: YOU JUST PROVED YOUR POINT. Kimberly: JUST A REALLY DOESN'T MEAN THAT. THERE IS A MOM TEXT COMING. Jesse: SHE ALREADY HIT ME UP FOR A POLL. Juan: YOU ARE RECITING RASMUSSEN WHICH IS CONSERVATIVE LEANING. THEY HAVE ALMOST HALF OF GUARANTEED JOBS IN THE COUNTRY. I GUESS THEY ARE SOCIALISTS. WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS MOMENT IN TERMS OF INCOME INEQUALITY IS A HEIGHTENED SENSE OF CONCERN. PEOPLE FEELING "I GOT LEFT BEHIND. I AM NEVER GOING TO CATCH UP. I CAN'T GET A HOUSE AS GOOD AS MY PARENTS." I REMEMBER YOU GUYS GOING AFTER HER LIKE CLINTON DURING THE CAMPAIGN, WHY DOESN'T SHE RELEASE HER SPEECHES TO WALL STREET. OH, SO THIS PART OF THE SAME ATTACK INITIATED BY BERNIE SANDERS. WHO CAME WITHIN ONE PERCENTAGE POINT OF TYING HILLARY CLINTON IN IOWA, A STATE WHERE ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THERE, THEY ARE SELF-DESCRIBED AS SOCIALISTS. THOSE NUMBERS ARE NATIONAL. IF YOU LOOK AT YOUNG DEMOCRATS. I THINK THEY ARE CONFUSING SOCIALISM WITH POPULISM OF THE TRUMP, BERNIE SANDERS STYLE WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT SPEAKING TO AN ECONOMIC NEED IN A NATION WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
