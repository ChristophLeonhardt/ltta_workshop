German tabloid Bild has published what it thought was leaked evidence of the activities of a Russian troll forum but the lead turned out to be far from concrete rot Cassy have joined me earlier with the details build rushed into this one they thought they had a real bombshell and they thought that they would incite a national scandal a huge political scandal basically what happened is they got these allegedly leaked emails which involved the Socialists the SPD there precisely specifically their youth wing leader Kevin kunam who was allegedly talking to a Russian bought factory to an agent a Russian agent who introduced himself as Yuri what they were talking about according to the email exchange is the SPD Kevin Cunha is running a campaign against forming a coalition government with Angela Merkel's own party it's called the googoo ko campaign and the Russian Yuri allegedly offered to use the use of his BOTS he'd sell the SPD his BOTS to sway public opinion in Germany and derail this effort to build the coalition it would be you know this would be a huge story the first direct evidence of Russia meddling in Germany's in Germany's in politics we've got the we've got the exchange itself and honestly it's something out of a spy movie and tacky one at that but here are some bits from it dear Kevin I'm Yuri I'd like to talk to you about supporting your no grow go campaign thanks for your mail J already told me to expect a mail from you but just to be sure could you name me J's favorite beverage as you can certainly understand this as a delicate matter meeow meeow ma t ginger dear Yuri perfect that's a relief so what can you offer me basically we can offer you everything pi√±on campaign with bots against schultz social bots on Twitter and Facebook or even a targeted Facebook advertising campaign I think a targeted advertising campaign on Facebook would be appreciated by the Naga raka movements how much money would you invest in these ads we've already roughly calculated the campaign and expect to pay around 4000 to 5000 euros we've included the social BOTS don't worry we'll pay from Frankfurt the payment will not be traceable hi eerie sounds good I'll collect the data for the Facebook audience and send all the informations he's seen so you can launch the campaign immediately as long as it looks like Jesus paid for the ads I'm not worried looking forward went into this swinging they had a huge picture in the front page of the title new dirt on the SPD builders very anti SPD so it's no surprise you know they dived into the story that was on Friday that was on Friday by Wednesday satirist sfrom from the Titanic satirical magazine revealed that they were behind the entire email exchange they faked the entire thing and they left bill gray red-faced because many news outlets had seen this exchange German news outlets they had thought well you know this is this is little bit suspicious a little bit suspect checked exactly billed had no such reservations it emerged that the email address that they that this email exchange attributed to Kevin Cunha the leader of the SPD's youth wing was fake you can't send emails from this email address and his real email address ends with SPDT so you know you know they they failed to carry out basic checks and checks and verifications and so build was left red-faced and now there's they're saying themselves they issued a statement on Facebook on their website they they're saying that this just goes to show builds agenda an anonymous email two or three calls and build prints everything that fits its agenda well Titanic has also been online on Twitter they're milking this for all it's worth on twitter the hashtag mio mio gate mio mio Mota a ginger of course being the drink the password drink mentioned in the email exchange so you know they're having a good laugh on Twitter at built these days and what's more build while admitting that the email exchange was fake they're still trying to defend themselves they're saying that you know they trying to grasp in its true saying that this email exchange originated from the SPD's servers and whatnot but the good laughs had been all around well for more on the story I'm very happy to say that we're joined live on the program by Moretz Christian editor at italic magazine who as we just heard came up with the idea for the prank you're very welcome and did you ever imagine that the prank would work you know this is one of the most read if not the most read newspaper in Germany yet they run your story without a lot of fact-checking yes like you said built as a tabloid magazine and we at Titanic a satirical magazine we work with the same methods as built so we knew how to think like an built editor and what we did was we came up with a story that was tacky and like a spy movie as you just said and we had a good feeling that this would work especially with build as they already ran a campaign against the SPD the Social Democratic Party which Kevin keynote is a part of what was your intent in carrying out the prank in the first place our intent was to spin this story more further you know there seems to be no election in the past years where there wasn't talk of Russian Mettling or interference but this SPD voting which is now evident in Germany about whether they go into the coalition with Merkel or not there were no rumors about Russia meddling and we thought this this cannot be we have to make make an alliance with the built tabloid and push a story about Russian meddling and as we see now it works perfectly just on that point what was your purpose in choosing Russian Truls is there a thirst Ferranti Russian stories fueling this it is it so that it's there in society that people want to read about this whether or not it's true is perhaps a secondary thing yes I think there's people want this story to be true at least the editors have built because Russian trolls are interesting just like in James Bond movies which are very successful in Germany as well so we just thought it was a good story and yeah I think it worked out perfectly there are other newspapers of course who saw the v links and this particularly the email thing but build did not do that untouched ahead with what they thought was going to be an exclusive story is that why you think they did that because they the thirst for exclusive to get there first you know encompasses is much more important than the actual details the facts in other words yes I think so we knew what we had to put in this story to make it interesting for built and when there's a story like that for for built they don't care about details it's only interesting if the story is good and it was a good story indeed and it was yeah like a good movie I hope it will be made into a movie sometime yeah you said you thought like build editors would think and do you think that they're prone to things like this happening in in the future become perhaps a newspaper like this and perhaps other tabloids or other media in the country perhaps take things at face value that need a little bit more checking in the future I think I don't think this will happen again because built already did it and I think other newspapers and media will do better fact-checking but I'm very glad about the story because I think we can all learn from this and I'm very happy now to speak to a Russian TV station because I think if people in Russia are at the Kremlin want information about how to deal with German newspapers they can contact us we are very cheap just a few bitcoins and we give everything away yeah it's particular with the value of bitcoins going up and down you might be very good value and just there finally defense German people are actually are they getting a little bit more savvy to things that are perhaps fake news are not fake news and things like this / happily particularly the full life from this because bill has been criticized for doing for doing this for just going ahead without the correct fact-checking do you think a German people are happy without that they've now been caught out I think no I think the readers of built just like the editors have built in their hopeless cases so you can't help them I don't think anyone will learn anything new we at Titanic nor the people at built or German politicians or the German people but it was a good laugh now and and I think that's worth something yeah and thanks for coming in the program and sharing your view on this it certainly was a good for a headline or two yet Moretz Hurtgen editor a titanic magazine the satirical newspaper who came up with the idea for the prank thank you
