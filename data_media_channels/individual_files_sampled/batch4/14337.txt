with much pomp and circumstance the federal government recently unveiled a new anti violence initiative for Toronto but upon analyzing the details turns out this announcement is surprise nothing more than a virtue signaling nothing burger so there was this press conference last week in Troy um involving the federal parliamentary secretary for infrastructure along with the mayor and the police chief all of which suggested that something big was coming down the pike here's the lead in a cp24 report quote the federal government will give true on 2 1 million dollars over the next three years to strengthen an intervention program for people believed to be at high risk of committing crimes or becoming the victims of crime end quote hmm interesting so what kind of crime are we talking about here guns and gangs domestic abuse impaired driving well later we're told the focus is actually quote radicalization and extremism end quote ok what kind of radicalization and extremism oh come on folks were not supposed to ask such impolite culturally insensitive questions like that now the money angle the feds are offering up 1 million dollars these funds will be earmarked for something called focus Toronto a program that operates in four areas of Hogtown that uses a quote collaborative approach involving police social workers public health counselors community groups and educators to identify people and families that elevate a risk of victimization or offending end quote alrighty then the feds are spending 1 million dollars or less than 10% of what they gave the convicted terrorist Omar Khadr over three years to presumably fight the kind of mayhem little Omar and his ilk like to partaken that's a real knee-slapper isn't it the idea that the powers that be are going to defeat radicalization and extremism by spending three hundred and thirty three thousand dollars a year and what does 1/3 of a million dollars spread over a calendar year get you these days when it comes to the war on terror you asked my guess not a hell of a lot indeed as far as I can tell the line share of this dough will go towards paying some social workers public health counselors community groups and educators to set up a few kumbaya sessions with individuals who might pose as a potential menace to society hey maybe we can dovetail this initiative with those poetry reading sessions for the returning Isis fighters to Canada I think that's called synergy as for whatever cash is left over I imagine that will go toward renting some meeting rooms for those aforementioned kumbaya sessions say are you feeling safer right now folks or would you like some fries with that nothing burger supreme as for Mayor John Tory he had this to say about this grandiose initiative quote it's something to behold end quote oh you're right mr. bear it's something to behold alright for the rebel dawn media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies hey folks rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
