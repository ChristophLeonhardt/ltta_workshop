politics of aid the US has just cut millions of dollars in military assistance to Pakistan it says Islamabad is not doing enough to find armed groups so is Washington using aid as a foreign policy tool and what are the consequences this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Elizabeth puranam the United States has Pakistan is failing to take action against armed groups including the Taliban Washington says some of them operate within Pakistani borders and it wants the government of new prime minister Imran Khan to do more it also says it will end a planned 300 million dollar military assistance it's part of a broader cut in US aid to Pakistan which was announced earlier this year Pakistan's foreign minister says 300 million figure is money the u.s. over the country for its help in fighting armed groups Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to visit Islamabad on Wednesday and the issue is likely to top the agenda President Donald Trump has previously accused Pakistan of deceiving the u.s. while receiving billions of dollars in aid Pakistan denies it gives safe haven to any armed group we'll bring in our guests in a moment but first let's have a closer look at the figures Pakistan is estimated to have received more than 33 billion dollars in financial support from the US since 2002 Washington substantially increased its assistance to Islamabad in the wake of the 9/11 attacks then went up again in 2009 when Congress approved a package that authorized an estimated 7.5 billion dollars in aid over five years but that lucrative financial support has drastically fallen in recent years especially since Donald Trump came to office well let's bring in our panel now joining us from Islamabad is cymbal Khan a security analyst in Washington DC Aparna Pandey director of the initiative on the future of India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute and also in Islamabad is Machado Zadie a political analyst and development practitioner a very warm welcome to the program miss Karl let me start with you in Islamabad just how damaging are these cuts to the powerful military's capabilities to their operation against armed groups I think more than the cuts been damaging to the military's capacity to carry out anti militant operations that they have been in Pakistan's tribal areas I think more damaging than the is the damage to the relationship the diplomatic damage to the relationship and kind of bringing rancor and an unpleasant touch to the first very important visit because we've just had elections in Pakistan we have a new government we have a brand new prime minister who's elected to the office for the first time and we were you know hoping that this would be a moment to kind of reset relations we've seen that pakistan-us relations have been on a downturn last year especially and this was there was a hope that these could be things could be put to a right track but even before the you know secretary pompiers visit and second amatus his visit to Pakistan happened this this has created a little unpleasantness and bad blood the military is carrying on operations and I think within Pakistan there is a certainly there is a understanding and a clarity here that these operations arm only being conducted for Pakistan's own benefit for Pakistan's own kind of ideas about what we need for our defence of our border areas with Afghanistan what we need long-term what we need internally and how how we look at external security so I think these will be continued and we have the military has its own long-term plans on that I don't think this 300 million cut is going to substantially change those plans okay those plans are going to continue and I know it is a difficult position but they would continue mr. Pandey what do you make of that miss Kahn is talking about a sort of you know there was hope for a resetting of relations but is that what this US administration is actually doing or trying to do reset the relations by withholding money in monetary terms the amount is not much and the money was actually suspended as of January of this year what is important however is the message that the u.s. is trying to send the bottom line is the American side believes that Pakistan has not been keeping its promises Pakistan has acted only against those terror groups that operate inside Pakistan it has consistently refused to act against those terror groups that operate against Americans and Afghans in Afghanistan or against India inside the country and so with all due respect to my friend from Pakistan they don't seem to understand that you that in the u.s. it is not a question of you know the old arguments it's not an issue of litigating history but a matter of trust it is one thing to say that I cannot do this because it is against my national interest it is another thing to say that I will do it which Pakistan was saying all these years and now to protest that you are not getting paid for not doing something you are not doing mr. Zaidi what do you make of that and is it productive or counterproductive to get a country to do what you want by cutting financial assistance well if you hear the Americans friends like a barn and many others in Washington and and in India and indeed in Afghanistan if you hear them tell the story they've never been able to get Pakistan to do anything whether they've provided the billions and billions of dollars at the tap of US dollars that was open as a free for all for military dictators in this country over three generations the 1960s the 1980s and the 2000s or when you shut down the aid like in the 1990s or what appears to be what's happening now with this symbolic sort of announcement right before the right before the arrival of secretary Pompeo whether you provide Pakistan with all kinds of money or you provide Pakistan with nothing whether you hold Pakistan's hand and tell it how great it is which the Americans have done intermittently throughout their history or you chide Pakistan and and and put out sort of you know newspaper stories in The New York Times and particularly in the Washington Post saying how bad Pakistan is ultimately bok-sun ends up doing what Pakistan wants to so I think what probably a lot of folks around the world need to look at is the relationships that Pakistan is in where other countries are able to get Pakistan to do what they want Pakistan to do and most of the time the way that happens like with any other country is when other countries align their strategic interests and their security interests with the interests of the party they're interested in if people are interested in getting Pakistan to act in other people's interests in Afghanistan then they have to give some attention and consideration to Pakistan's interests in Afghanistan as well miss Kahn what do you make of that I mean the defining issue of the u.s. relationship with Pakistan is Afghanistan what is all of this you know the withholding of military assistance the souring of relations going to mean for the Pakistan for Pakistan's relationship would the Afghan Taliban and is the u.s. losing the leverage that it has through Pakistan would the Afghan Taliban by cutting this funding I think the relationship us-pakistan relationship over the issue of support to Taliban or the sanctuaries of Taliban at least that's what the US and others have accused Pakistan of having sanctuaries of Taliban and Pakistan side has always been a sticking point in this relationship loss last 17 years since after 9/11 and the US intervention that has always been the case and it has put the relationship under strain at various various points this is not the first time but I think what is changing and which is interesting this time around is usually what u.s. leverage that u.s. had tried to use all the tools that US had tried to use to kind of pressure Pakistan for more security related impacts I mean they used to be far more drone strikes suddenly they used to be far more border heating up border skirmishes before that and various other kinds of pressure was put more like security centric pressure was put around but I think globally we are seeing a change that it since since president Trump's last year security policy has come out there is a more of a desire to kind of use economic means and measures which are considerable US has considerable economic might also we keep forgetting that US has looked like a as a great unilateral military power in the world but it Hall has a huge economic clout also globally and we see us using that economic cloud now as far as sanctions with Iran is concerned Russia is concerned even in the trade bilateral discussion with China so I think Pakistan also this is the kind of a trend that we are see going forward we've seen secretary secretary pomp is kind of not very on very unwelcome comments on the IMF Pakistan going at the IMF and that how that they America being a big contributor to IMF is going to have a veto or say in it and then now suddenly kind of coming out with this 300 million aid as Mashhad ever said before nobody was really expecting this CSF funding to come out at this moment but there is this kind of a symbolic symbolism of putting economic pressure on Pakistan because at right as you may know the new government has come in Pakistan is in a bit of a economic crunch as far as balance of payments are concerned economy is not doing too bad Pakistan has been growing 5.4 percent last few years it which has been tremendous you know because we've gone through a whole period of internal insecurity and terrorism so coming out of that Pakistan has been growing 5.4 percent yearly GDP is good in the internal market is very good but there is an economic crunch and I think the u.s. is kind of emphasizing the economic relationship and how that globally counts not just with Pakistan so it's interesting towards that there's a different tonal impact of how US is dealing with Pakistan I do want to put that same question to miss panda and hear what you think do I mean how much leverage does Pakistan have would the Afghan Taliban again you know Afghanistan is the key issue in this relationship and what will you know again what will the sort of cutting of funding mean for how much Pakistan cooperates with the u.s. when it comes to the Afghan Taliban actually I sort of I have three pointed on so one it's a question of interests and goals I mean if you look at it what does the United States and what does Afghanistan or any of the regional countries seek in Afghanistan a stable Afghanistan which does not which is not influenced by by by groups like the Afghan Taliban or the Haqqani network on the other hand what is the Pakistani military intelligence establishment support the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network so they are no shade go there there are no shared interests and this has been a repeated pattern in us-pakistan relations going back decades that the two sides have never shared goals have never shared interests they have temporarily just been together for certain practical reasons second the question of leverage the United States has provided over thirty three billion dollars in aid and reimbursement to Pakistan and assistance and has helped Pakistan in its almost 17 times that Pakistan has gone to the IMF for a program all of those programs actually only one program was actually implemented fully by Pakistan the third point which is that how much of influence does Pakistan have over the Afghan Taliban I am one of those who believes it has tremendous influence but the question is does it want to use it Pakistan has preferred not to use it or claims it does not have it because form Pakistan's point of view and Afghan Taliban or lead Afghanistan just like a Mujahideen legaly Afghanistan is helps its regional interests which are trying to contain or put-down India so we have to look at point agree that waters of the waters Pakistan want and how divergent is Pakistan's interest from the interest of Afghanistan they interest a United States and India okay I do want to broaden the discussion out now because US President Donald Trump has cut aid to a number of countries in recent months he's ended all funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency that provides schooling in health care to five million people it denied Egypt almost a hundred million dollars in aid and is holding back another 195 million until it sees what it calls improvements in Cairo's record on human rights and democracy and Washington withdrew military assistance from Myanmar over that country's crackdown on a Muslim revenger in Rakhine State so we're seeing you know mr. Sayle do you think that we are seeing the u.s. or this US administration use funding whether it's military funding or humanitarian as a political tool in a way that previous US administrations might not have well if you don't mind I mean I'd like to zoom out and broaden this even further I think the first thing to understand I'd appreciate is that foreign assistance whilst almost overwhelmingly ends up benefiting people that deserve it and tends to be at least from the view of the taxpayer that's providing that funding is genuinely a benevolent act you know an act of compassion and humanity but the way in which foreign assistance and international aid is often programmed and and the way it's directed and funneled is often informed by political objectives and there's nothing wrong with that the countries that provide aid to other countries are looking to achieve strategic and/or tactical objectives so there's nothing wrong with the u.s. choosing to use its money in whatever way deems necessary I think the question for a country like Pakistan or any other country that is a net recipient of aid is whether or not that country knows what it wants and whether or not that country then can can channel the aid in the direction that it feels is best for its interests so I having worked in international assistance and international aid myself for for many many years I've never found either donor country or the recipient country at odds because in at least the work that I've done most recently for example with the ally felon campaign which we just closed last week we always found that both the UK DFID which was providing the funding and the Pakistani government which was in many ways the target of that funding there was never any sort of you know lack of coherence or or a lot of it right but if you're talking about say the example of the US administration cutting aid to the UN agency that's responsible for Palestinian refugees there is a complete difference and in what the US administration is asking for and what the power Estonian see as being fit miss calm the Palestinian leadership have said that the US administration is actually using its humanitarian aid as blackmail and that it's not going to force them to the negotiating table if we look at this case how do you see the u.s. cutting funding to the agencies that are in charge of looking after Palestinian refugees and the response to it I think there's a big difference as we were we were talking about military CSF it was coalition Support Fund which was more military aid for military to carry on its operations I think comparing it to humanitarian aid it's an absolutely different thing humanitarian aid goes to people to sustain themselves who have been you know where whose livelihood shelter food nutrition water all that access is denied it's basically a matter of life and death so we're not saying that they're the same thing but we aren't exactly we're talking about the u.s. you daily aid whether it's gonna be absolutely condemned Noble no I think it's completely condemnable and I think it's it's showing a very kind of heartless way of doing foreign policy and it's surprising because the US has stood for for for actually for rights and freedoms and and support for oppressed people around the world I mean that that's how we've looked at the US and its it's actually a huge negative to their own image and to their own international multilateral image to do this but you know the I don't think there's a parallel with the visual create that we are talking here but I I don't know anything any other words but to condemn it and miss panda what do you you know what do you think of what the US is doing say with the case of you know cutting aid to Palestinian refugees do you think that they're actually serious about wanting to negotiate with the Palestinians because it's not having that impact are they trying to use aid as a political tool in this case I actually do not work on the middle based on israel-palestine so i will not be able to answer that part of the question I would much rather touch on what you had mentioned about the aid being cut to Egypt so countries that had that have been military or security allies of the United States whether it is Egypt or Pakistan where or in the case of Burma where they are trying to cut aid I'm sorry Myanmar the reason I mean one may disagree with how it is done but one will try but if you try and look from the American point of view the aim is to send the message that we cannot keep providing you aid security aid and military assistance on the grounds that you promised that you would do something but you are not doing it and so maybe maybe cutting off aid is the way to either see whether or not we share any interest still or to make you do something that you said you would do but you have not done up till now but in the cases of Egypt you know cutting funding because they say they have concerns over their human rights democracy in Myanmar over their government's attacks on the revenger would you say that that's made any difference at all if you look at Egypt sort of human rights and democracy record now or the fact that Myanmar is completely you know denying all of the allegations against its government for its treatment of the revenger I mean all I would say is that sometimes instead of giving money it may be a good way to check whether or not you have any leverage if I don't have leverage why should I give good money after bad and if I do have leverage maybe my cutting off money will lead you to rethink okay I want to put the Palestine question to mr. Zaidi as well because you do work in development you know there are so many people that have said for a long time that this aid actually excuses the Israeli authorities as an occupying power to provide for Palestinians and that aid money is keeping the sort of status quo of occupation in place so could cutting aid actually have unintended positive consequences in the long run I think there's been a lot of sort of analysis and research that looks at sort of the potential downsides of AIDS and the way in which not just in the Palestinian example which is obviously more stark and I think it evokes much deeper and stronger emotions particularly for people that that care about how how other human beings are treated but I think in terms of aid itself there's a lot of arguments that suggest that aid is largely an instrument to sustain the elite capture that so many of these developing countries are susceptible to and victims of because instead of forcing governments and and states to make difficult choices aid basically papers over those dysfunctions and those imbalances in the economy and in the fiscal realities of a country I think Pakistan might serve as a really interesting case study because as Aparna mentioned Pakistan has repeatedly gone to the IMF Pakistan has been an aid recipient for most of its existence and yet what's really interesting is that everybody keeps coming back and you know the rates of of the loans keep decreasing it never seems to end so clearly in terms of leverage there is something about Pakistan that the United States says and I disagree with Aparna she mentioned earlier that it's only been a tactical relationship but when the Mujahideen were being supported by the United States were being feeded and celebrated at the White House Pakistan was it was a key partner so was Israel so was Egypt you know India was obviously left out in the cold back then but you know at that time the US and Pakistan were very much strategic partners and they sought and achieved strategic games including the defeat of the Soviet Union and it's and its various allies so I think aid is is obviously always has a political dimension to it and I think it's up to the countries that are receiving as much as it is to the countries giving to determine how it's best used okay missus ad we don't have long left in the program and I would like to give put those points those very important points to both miss Kahn and miss Pandey Muskaan let me start with you do you think that this sort of new u.s. strategy is going to work in the long run in its important relationship with Pakistan um I I don't think so I think they're going to be resets and changes it's in this strategy for me as a temporary negative downturn okay the relationship has been on Iran and downturn but I think this economic strategy of trying to use aid as a lever all right it's more of a office Shore on in trying to show that all right Lee something something has been done okay miss Chi I mean I apologize but I only have about a minute left and I would like to give miss Pandey the last word you have about 30 seconds on this I do believe that we should give this policy a chance we've tried everything else from massive amounts of economic aid military aid to sort of cutting off aid maybe cutting off aid will achieve something on both sides maybe Pakistan will rethink its interests maybe the u.s. will rethink what it is what it wants from Pakistan so why not give it a try all right mr.
