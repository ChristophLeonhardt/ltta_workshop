despite the growing tensions between the UK and Russia when it comes to hard facts about the poisoning of sergey skripnikov Solsbury we are none the wiser for all the talk of toxic chemical nova choc the motives and intentions of the Kremlin and the history of poisoned Russian spies in the UK there's still no compelling evidence no proof presented to close the loop on this story when the news broke British media had just enough detail to package a compelling tale replete with geopolitical mystery and intrigue I think he lost the mini coverage in in this country in response to the poisoning of mr. scribble has tended to be like James Bond scripts or film in a twist worthy of a Cold War spy movie this was the moment he was handed over by the Russians to mi6 and I think to her setting something that reflects the lack of information that is available or has been made available there's a lot of guesswork there's always say obviously a lot of anticipation or for what what will come next and there is a normal amount of speculation and frankly there's been some really good analysis as well the rush to judgment on the part of the UK establishment press has been overwhelming and this is obviously had the effect of making it impossible for the investigation to proceed in a way that meets all the standards that you would require maintenance occasion of this magnitude at this time of speaking there is stone or concrete evidence that Russia was responsible for this it may well have been responsible I don't say they were not responsible but we need evidence because it's such a serious issue you have both an old script and an or geopolitical climate in which two reports this story in 2006 a Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London with a dose of radioactive polonium he died and Russian UK relations took a hit 12 years on Russia has become the designated suspects when it comes to political interference and media meddling stretching from the US through to Germany and Italy tensions are high and for tabloids in Britain the go to cold war narrative has been hard to resist reporting maybe more restrains in the broadsheets and the broadcasters but the tone of that coverage has had an air of establishment groupthink British media for the most part does buy into this off its own volition and I think it is suspicious of some of the motives of Russia internationally and indeed domestically I don't think there is a sense among most media commentators that they are failing sufficiently to examine what they're being told by by law enforcement agencies and so on it's so far we know nothing about what happened to them if they were poisoned or if they were by whom well there's been very few dissenting voices to the mainstream narrative on this particular story so being establishment voices who have all piled in with their attacks on Russia that Putin is a dictator in 2006 Russia adopted a law that allows the president and the president alone to order the killing of its enemies abroad by the way crown prince bin Salman of Saudi Arabia's given the red carpet recently one of our closest allies he's young popular and promising more change than his country's ever seen the whole coverage has been very subjective in this regard to be honest I think it would be refreshing to hear here in the UK at least some sort of alternative version of events that it seems like the story here has been so a one track I've only been looking at the media landscape here and it has been very monotone I would say homogeneous Union to Russian media and the same thing could be said for their coverage from the outset the Kremlin has issued unequivocal denials of its involvement on the Russian airwaves those denials have provided a segue into stories hinting at all sorts of theories including that British intelligence was behind the attack GRU they gotta breathe handsome but that's leading the effort I think the kind of overarching tone of it from the big stars of the Russian media such as kiss aloft it's typical there is nothing surprising about it this is exactly what if they do every time Russia is under scrutiny it's this kind of mockery and skepticism is push necks creepily miss wizard evaporation malla in tourism no Kaka travel on a palace on the ocean more crazy first of all of the West and the way that the West is dealing with the problem and this skepticism about about the West well Russian media is playing through its own people and the anti-western sentiment which is growing in Russia there has been extremes on both sides and this is what I mean when we come out with these speculative attacks on Russia Vladimir Putin ordered the assassination of this traitor embarrass or then the Russians are gonna react lucario lucario new Parliament a tourism mooie Zara I'm committee policy in this flurry this miasma of claim and counterclaim people are wept up to accept this kind of enmity is a new normal away from the newsrooms and TV studios the Russian embassy in the UK has provided its own commentary complete with media critique via its Twitter feed the UK government hasn't engaged with those provocations its focused instead on RT the Kremlin backs channel that broadcasts around the world and has offices in London Ofcom Britain's broadcast regulator issued a statement on the 12th of March announcing that RT was on its radar to be threatened with having our broadcasting license revoked as a result of this diplomatic standoff as a result of this political Rao I think is incredibly shocking I find it incredibly ominous the likely response if that were to happen would be reciprocal measures as they are called from Moscow I just think it's leading us down a path that can't be any good both for freedom the freedom of the press in Russia as well I want the BBC to work there and I want RT to be able to work here on the 14th of March Prime Minister Theresa May ordered 23 Russian officials out of the UK for a government facing a daily onslaught from the British media over its prevarication over brexit this is a story that projects leadership and clarity the Prime Minister has announced a series of measures to retaliate against Russia for the perfu news cycles at least in Russia with a presidential election underway the saga has provided useful material to pit the country against the West in the din of atul possibly because of it rhetoric has intensified tensions have escalated we've missed the the call for diplomacy within the mainstream media leading journalists and columnist be missed with the same thing voices the action ask the hard questions and TV ask about this case and about our relations with Russia where are they we are are these keynesian voices refused to be dragged along by the tide of prevailing orthodoxy if you're asking me is the Russian media adding to the debate no I think the Russian media is poisoning the debate by developing the truth by making facts questionable and by saying that everything can be questioned speculation spin and increasing suspicions on both sides that's the climate in which this diplomatic standoff is being reported and as the consensus solidifies the space the time for questions and alternative perspectives gets pushed to the margins
