first tonight in this news update then Donald Trump says his much-anticipated summit with North Korea on the 12th of next month might be delayed his comment came during a meeting with the South Korean president in Washington that's literally just wrapped up both sides had also previously floated the possibility of walking away from the talks to across there says follow our Washington correspondent Samira Khan hey smear it looks like the official talks free mr. moon and mr. Trump now over think we think too that a working lunch that's over interestingly no scheduled news media conference plan so some bits and pieces did come out from it is the summit now hanging in the balance or knots a big question right Trump seems to be sending yet another mixed message saying that the summit may or may not happen and that's on top of all the mixed messages that we've been hearing the second meeting with President Xi what what is your feeling you may have an opinion we commend myself but all in one would be a lot better working on something and you know there's a chance that it'll work out there's a chance it's a very substantial chance that it won't work out that doesn't mean it won't work out over a period of time but it may not work out for June 12th I think it'll be very successful but as I always say who knows who does what's going to happen you know I often say who knows who knows a lot of good things can happen a lot of bad things can happen we'll see how it all works out maybe a lot of things change everything can be scuttled everything can be scuttled speaking of mixed messages on one hand we have a special coin being produced just ahead of the meeting depicting the two leaders all smiles and meeting and we also have Trump guaranteeing Kim's safety promising that North Korea will be a rich country and then on the other hand we heard Trump threatening the Libya scenario I will guarantee his safety yes we will guarantee your safety and we've talked about that from the beginning he will be safe he will be happy his country will be rich the model if you look at that model with Gaddafi that was a total decimation we went in there to beat him now that model would take place if we don't make a deal most likely let's quickly remind you of what happened in Libya Gaddafi renounced his nuclear program in 2003 but he was overthrown in a NATO military campaign despite that in 2011 but it's not just this there's also the joint military drills between the u.s. and South Korea and then there's this also comes at a time just as the u.s. pulled out of the Iran deal so this all may be on North Korea's mind when they decide what to do yeah certainly very confusing messages saying but we'll see whether this 12th date works or not we'll keep following the story tonight from Washington DC Samira Khan thanks for now now we talked to two a former US air void to the United Nations who's negotiated with North Korea before he says it's highly damaging to make threats especially when it's so close to that summit between the two leaders the administration speaks with too many voices on North Korea you've got National Security Advisor bolton bringing up the Qaddafi issue with North Korea they get very nervous because Qaddafi gave up his weapons and then was killed that's not a good thing to talk about before the summit and I think Secretary Pompeo the Secretary of State has handled the issue well he's dealt with North Korea's met with twice he established an intelligence channel with the North Koreans I think the president needs to prepare substantively he needs to have a strategy but he needs to leave the details and the message to Pompeo to many in the administration including the president are speaking i believe the administration made a colossal mistake in getting out of the Iran deal because Iran was complying they were gonna for several years not develop nuclear weapons they were enriched uranium was being shipped out yes I wish the Iran deal under President Obama had included other provisions like Iran's support for terrorism what they've done in Syria American prisoners etc but I think the administration has now put some very unrealistic demands on both Iran and and our European allies I think it's a bad mistake especially on the eve of negotiations with North Korea's the North Koreans are going to say how can you make a deal with the u.s. if they break agreements you
