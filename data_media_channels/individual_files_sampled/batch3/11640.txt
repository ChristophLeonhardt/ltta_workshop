when these videos emerged pundits and politicians took them as gospel the truth conclusive indisputable and irrefutable proof of Assad's chemical sins the chemical weapon that killed dozens of civilians here canisters that the Assad regime has previously used in chemical attacks the Assad regime has used the same yellow gas canisters the NSC telling Fox News they have a high degree of confidence that it was used they must have had solid evidence you don't just launch a hundred cruise missiles in an act of war without convincing proof beyond any doubt right right wrong we were in the basement and then heard someone outside scream go to hospital we were scared they started to pour water on me I don't know why they did this pundits and politicians who've never been to Syria swear it happened witnesses locals who were there in the hospital in question say they didn't see a thing all they saw was white helmets dousing confused civilians with water neither did the doctors see anything on the 7th of April I was in the emergency room treating patients injured during the fighting the same day around 7:00 p.m. we started receiving patients with breathing problems about 15 cases this happened because people were inhaling smoke and dust the only showed symptoms of choking and nothing more it all happened because one missile hit a building nearby and a lot of dust got into the hospital rooms the screams chemical weapons chemical weapons were used to create panic this lasted for about an hour we were treating the patients and then sending them home we had no fatalities or instances of people suffering from poisonous substances this isn't helping Western journalists their leaders insisted happened Syria Russia and locals insist it didn't dead end open your minds in our manual if you don't understand normal language let's try a different way if you are impervious to our arguments let us bring you the witnesses then so Russia bought more than a dozen witnesses to the west to the UPC W and invited Western press perfect opportunity for journalists to get to the bottom of this right right how low do you have to go to bring a little child all the way here and threaten them right off the bat there nyle but here's the answer we came here willingly we demanded the Red Cross allow us to come here wrong answer in truth there isn't a right answer no matter what you say to some people no matter what you show them they'll never ever come around who change their views how threatened do you have to feel to change your story and deny a chemical weapons attack stubborn doesn't do this fellow justice he's really the reason that boy had to fly over yes Hasan is young and it's been difficult for him to make it here a flight here is no easy thing little Hasan has told you the truth something you did not want to hear it was a necessary measure we needed to show that there was a lie in a very dangerous anyone who hoped there'd be a breakthrough was in for a disappointment hours of testimony and evidence all for naught though you mentioned in a Russian press release that somebody here was going to be present who was a witness of producing the video of the white helmets and I was wondering where this witness is and if he can tell his testimony mr. no pom way more it's my view all these witnesses we heard from today are the evidence the white helmets film is fake I don't know maybe I missed something in one year out the other with no pause in between Britain France and the US boycotted the chemical watchdogs hearing with the witnesses calling it a stunt experts from the OPCW are currently still in Syria to investigate the alleged chlorine or sarin gas attack on duma we discussed the latest developments with the former UK ambassador to syria Peter Ford and Middle East expert Amara waka well it will be either either ignored or attempts will be made to downplay it and undermine it but I think when ordinary people see the footage the testimony they are bound to be impressed what the British media are also failing to point out is that it was Russia and Syria which requested the OPCW Mission Britain America and France is still not to this day confirmed that they wanted the mission to go ahead they refuse to see this as evidence obviously pending what the OPCW team is going to come up with from duma it's highly unlikely that they would say first of all that there was a chemical attack well these three actors were quick to do what they did to bomb the place because they knew they didn't have a solid case they wanted to bomb without with disregard to whatever was happening over there so it shows actually that they knew that there was no chemical attack but they were willing to do whatever it takes to assert their authority or so they think and say we're still on the table
