1
00:00:02,464 --> 00:00:04,199
-- BAD.

2
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:05,134
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

3
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,769
SECURITY ANNOUNCING THAT BORDER

4
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,505
RESTS EXCEEDED 50,000 FOR THE

5
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:13,175
THIRD MONTH IN A ROW.

6
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:16,445
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA WITH US THE

7
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:21,083
AUTHOR OF THE BEST SELLER AND

8
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,651
FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT GERALDO

9
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:22,985
RIVERA.

10
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:24,520
THIS IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,487
THEY WANT TO RAISE TAX.

12
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:31,727
THEY ARE SAYING DON'T TELL

13
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:33,228
ANYBODY, WE WANT TO IMPEACH THE

14
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:33,762
PLAYER.

15
00:00:33,762 --> 00:00:36,865
BUT DON'T SAY IT.

16
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:38,434
MAXINE WATERS STOP.

17
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:39,835
YOU HEARD WHAT NANCY PELOSI SAID

18
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:42,404
ABOUT MS-13 AND THEY WANT TO

19
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:43,539
KEEP OBAMACARE.

20
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,174
DON'T YOU THINK THOSE WILL BE

21
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:46,642
BIG ISSUES IN THE NOVEMBER?

22
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,544
>> I THINK THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE

23
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:50,646
IS THE HOT BUTTON ISSUE IN

24
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:51,013
NOVEMBER.

25
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:53,148
THAT WILL BE THE ONE THAT

26
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,050
RESONATES AND SEPARATES THE

27
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,384
PARTIES.

28
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:57,486
I HAVE A CAUTIONARY NOTE.

29
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:59,021
I AM A REPUBLICAN AND I DON'T

30
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:00,923
WANT A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY.

31
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:03,425
I THINK THEY WILL ENDEAVOR TO

32
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:04,525
IMPEACH THIS PRESIDENT, OUR

33
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:06,895
FRIEND WHO IS DOING A TERRIFIC

34
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:07,429
JOB.

35
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,431
HERE'S MY CAUTIONARY NOTE.

36
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:11,166
WHEN YOU USE WORDS LIKE ANIMAL

37
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,468
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL YOU ARE

38
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:15,571
REFERRING TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

39
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:18,107
THESE GANG MEMBERS AND NOT PAINT

40
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:19,608
THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY WITH A

41
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:20,075
BROAD BRUSH.

42
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:23,245
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROTECT OUR

43
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:27,049
BORDERS AND THE RIGHT TO HARD

44
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,184
POLICEWORK IN ANY KIND OF EFFORT

45
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,053
THAT IS LEGAL.

46
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:33,622
BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THE MORAL

47
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:35,891
RIGHT TO SEPARATE MIGRATING

48
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:36,859
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS.

49
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,727
I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE THIS

50
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:42,164
ISSUE BY DOING SOMETHING THAT IS

51
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:43,365
SO --

52
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:45,067
>> Sean: OKAY, A WALL WITH A

53
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:45,467
DOOR.

54
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:46,735
YOU ARE OKAY WITH THAT?

55
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:48,504
>> I AM OKAY WITH THAT.

56
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:52,708
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE WALL ON

57
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,243
THE ONE SIDE AND THE DREAMERS

58
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:56,512
GIVEN A PASS, A GREEN LIGHT.

59
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,246
>> Sean: THE PRESIDENT OFFERED

60
00:01:57,246 --> 00:01:59,648
THAT AND THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT

61
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:00,949
TAKE THAT.

62
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:02,751
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.

63
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:05,554
>> Sean: DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, AM

64
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:07,990
I RIGHT ON THE 4 BIG ISSUES OF

65
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,289
2018?

66
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,293
>> OH, I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY

67
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:11,593
CLEAR.

68
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:13,529
NOTHING HAS REALLY CHANGED

69
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:14,596
EXCEPT THE PRESIDENT DELIVERED

70
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:15,864
ON THESE KEY ISSUES.

71
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,232
HE STARTED TO BUILD THE WALL.

72
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:23,639
THE FIGURES FROM THE DHS ARE

73
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,673
STUNNING.

74
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:27,743
IT'S THE ECONOMY AND THE

75
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:28,610
NATIONAL SECURITY AGAIN.

76
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,978
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE DEMS

77
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:31,313
DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE.

78
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:35,784
THEY ARE WHISPERING IN THE

79
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:37,152
BACKGROUND ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.

80
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:41,156
WHO IS THEIR REAL LEADER?

81
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:44,493
>> Sean: THEY WANT HIGHER TACKS

82
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:46,562
AND IMPEACH PRERMENT.

83
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:48,297
>> MORE JOBS FOR MS-13.

84
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:52,968
IT'S A MESSAGE THAT IS INSANITY.

85
00:02:52,968 --> 00:03:01,476
IT'S TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

86
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:03,412
WHEN NANCY PELOSI SAYS NATIONAL

87
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:07,149
JOB FIGURES MEAN LITTLE.

88
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:15,324
THE FIRST TIME EVER WE HAVE FULL

89
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:15,724
EMPLOYMENT.

90
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:16,725
YOU HAVE MORE JOBS AVAILABLE

91
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,827
THAN PEOPLE LOOKING FOR JOBS.

92
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:20,495
NANCY PELOSI, DO YOU WANT MORE

93
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:20,996
UNEMPLOYMENT?

94
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:22,331
>> Sean: SHE WANTS TO TAKE THE

95
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:23,665
CRUMBS BACK.

96
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:25,033
NO THANK YOU.

97
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,168
>> RIGHT.

98
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:27,269
>> Sean: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

99
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,172
OUR HISTORY, WE HAVE MORE JOBS

100
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:33,775
THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED.

101
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,310
FIRST LOW UNEMPLOYMENT FOR

102
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,213
HISPANIC AMERICANS,

103
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:38,947
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND WOMEN.

104
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:40,115
>> DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA HITS A

105
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,750
GOOD POINT, SEAN.

106
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,019
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS DIVIDED

107
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,688
SOCIETY IS THAT WE ARE NOT ON

108
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,156
THE SAME TEAM.

109
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:52,094
WE CHEER AGAINST OUR PRESIDENT'S

110
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:52,461
SUCCESSES.

111
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:53,228
>> Sean: THE DEMOCRATS DO.

112
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:54,363
>> DEMOCRATS ARE CHEERING FOR

113
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,398
AMERICA TO FAIL.

114
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:57,799
THEY CAN'T STAND HIS SUCCESS

115
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,534
BECAUSE IT HURTS THEIR

116
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,804
OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN POWER.

117
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:04,640
THAT'S A FACT.

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,709
>> WHEN IT COMES TO, FOR

119
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,044
EXAMPLE, THE NORTH KOREA

120
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:09,811
NEGOTIATIONS, I WANT EVERYBODY

121
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:12,214
TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM.

122
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:15,784
CHEERING FOR SUCCESS FOR THE

123
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:19,454
PRESIDENT.

124
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:22,089
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

125
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,759
>> LOOK, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,926
WANT AMERICA TO SUCCEED.

127
00:04:24,926 --> 00:04:26,595
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE AND

128
00:04:26,595 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHY THEY WANT TO SABOTAGE
