meanwhile as Trump tries to weather a political storm at home his presidency will face a test later this year in the guise of midterm elections that he's a widely seen as a vote of confidence in the sitting president and his party the nazar T's Caleb Maupin explains whether it's Republicans or Democrats u.s. politicians seem to know in advance who's to blame if indeed the results are under par with so much division on Capitol Hill the Democrats and Republicans have finally found something that they can agree on both parties now agree that the Russians are coming more specifically they're coming to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections this is president Trump I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact in the upcoming election based on the fact that no president has been tougher on Russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats they definitely don't want Trump and this is his old arch-nemesis there are some tax experts in Silicon Valley Valley with whom I have met who say that you know maybe what they'll do this next time is to really disrupt the actual election shut down the servers that you send results to interfere with the operation of voting machines because still too many of them are linked to the Internet so there we are still very vulnerable Russia's meddling in the midterm elections may just be a hypothesis at this point but the Trump administration from the Department of Homeland Security to the Secretary of State are ready to fight the 2018 midterm elections remain a potential target for Russian cyber and influence operations I think we should be absolutely prepared to assume that they will try to interfere in all 50 states we will not tolerate Russian interference in our 2018 elections we are planning and preparing as if they'll try again this fall and beyond now it hasn't happened yet but the retaliatory sanctions to be imposed on Russia are all set up by Congress we're going to pursue Russia's energy and financial sectors it's oleg arks its parastatal entity it is my go along with Senator Graham to make sure that we're protecting the United States defending the United States folks in Washington DC are Manning their battle stations all prepared to face an oncoming onslaught but what are they worried about well it could be the 2016 presidential elections let's not forget that James clapper the former Director of National Intelligence said that in the 2016 supposed intervention none of the vote tallies were in any way affected they did not change any vote tallies or any anything of that sort yeah I'm just we have no we have no way of gauging the impact that certainly intelligence community can't gauge the impact it had on choices of the electorate made furthermore it's not exactly clear who Russia is supposedly going to be supporting now the Democrats say that Russia is going to be supporting Donald Trump but Trump says that the pending Kremlin subversion will be in support of the Democrats why would he say that well because it makes just as much sense is what the Democrats have is a composite row everybody wants to blame another country for the problem you know the reason why 30 million Americans don't have health care has nothing to do with Russia that has everything to do with the enemies of America which by the way are in America Exxon the military-industrial complex these are the enemies of America our entire government is bought it's a legal bribery and they steal and cheat right out in the open Americans are gobbling this up it's amazing you know we used to be afraid of Russia because they had a communist ideology they're just kind of pressing that button on Americans because we've been conditioned to be afraid of Russia and their communism even though they're not communists anymore this will all be cleared up after the election whichever side loses can blame Russia for it and after all it worked in the 2016 presidential election for Hillary Clinton there's no reason that donald trump can't use it to his advantage caleb Maupin RT washington DC you
