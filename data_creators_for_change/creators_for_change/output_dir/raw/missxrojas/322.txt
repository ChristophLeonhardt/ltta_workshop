00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as many of you know I</font>

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,080
worked in bookselling for the last five

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">years of my life and now I've shifted</font>

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,799
along the history and moved into fashion

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,809
retail as with<font color="#E5E5E5"> any job I have I very</font>

6
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,099
quickly become very obsessed with the

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,570
need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything about what I'm</font>

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,190
selling<font color="#CCCCCC"> their does appeal to the fashion</font>

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,299
aside of me that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

10
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,680
suppressed over the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely something I have a massive</font>

12
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,320
interest in even though I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,880
separate channel for it like all the

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,900
other girls<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live with for example</font>

15
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,640
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really comprehensive fashion</font>

16
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,470
shower you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should called the stylish and</font>

17
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,730
they send a clip to a bunch of youtubers

18
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,170
so apologies if you see there's more

19
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">than once I think they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really</font>

20
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">good balance between using homegrown</font>

21
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,850
youtubers and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> having and using</font>

22
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,260
their connection to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

23
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,180
Betsey Johnson who designed my progress

24
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,280
but when I was 17 so just show you that

25
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,550
now

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I put milk click and subscribe link to</font>

27
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,699
the stylish because I know they're just

28
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,289
growing right now but it's interesting

29
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,519
because obviously there's a stigma

30
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,680
against fashion and beauty<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,449
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lex often talks about it's</font>

32
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:04,890
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to me because it's seen</font>

33
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,270
as something that's you dominantly

34
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,220
female regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many men</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

35
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,600
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> industry and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also just</font>

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,640
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many men buy clothes are not caring</font>

37
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,200
more about the way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> look but of</font>

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">course if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's feminine it must be</font>

39
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,229
superficial it can't be legitimate form

40
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,270
of expression blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sorts</font>

41
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,100
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things make me air anyway i've been</font>

42
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,540
using many ways in which to think about

43
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,920
the relationship between creator

44
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,110
creation and audience and fashion has

45
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,789
been one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways into that and books</font>

46
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,050
have been another way into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and they</font>

47
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,420
also defense this model of you creating

48
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,119
something so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> an individual has an</font>

49
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,280
individual relationship with it and it

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,170
also has a set of group relationship

51
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,340
with theirs and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share up</font>

52
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,720
with people or you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

53
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,759
keep it to themselves but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally for</font>

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,500
your creation to kind of make its way

55
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">around you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to share it with</font>

56
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,830
people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you want a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

57
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,289
to have that individual relation to it

58
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:53,310
without feeling necessarily like it's no

59
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,050
longer individual because everyone has

60
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,789
that relationship to it but then also

61
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,740
when you have things like fashion you

62
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,360
have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like trends and and so you</font>

63
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,030
want a sense of communal but you don't

64
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,799
want to lose that individual so it

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,570
becomes this huge like battle between

66
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,360
individual and communal and creation and

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,709
what are you creating for are you

68
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,060
creating for the person to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

69
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,680
individuals are you creating<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

70
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,269
that audience in mind which i think is

71
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,980
ever true at least not if you're in the

72
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,200
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more commercial side of fashion</font>

73
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,420
or creation in general and that's kind

74
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,609
of a big necessary part of creation

75
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:25,680
nowadays because people have to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> rent</font>

76
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
and maybe one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> this equation is</font>

77
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,340
actually an illusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that</font>

78
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,410
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the creating something so that</font>

79
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">its individual but when I make a video</font>

80
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,519
for example I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> as aware that i'm</font>

81
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,350
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lots of people as I am that</font>

82
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,329
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am talking to one person</font>

83
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,980
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the facts that makes us</font>

84
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,720
difficult is that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in massive</font>

85
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
generalizations everyone has different

86
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,620
motivations for creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think</font>

87
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are some similarities that can be</font>

88
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,739
drawn between them and that also can be

89
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,540
drawn between the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> field of fashion</font>

90
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,920
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole field of books in the whole</font>

91
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">field of anything ever sold ever and I</font>

92
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">just find it really interesting I don't</font>

93
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,680
know why maybe because on some level I

94
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">was trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain to myself why took</font>

95
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,220
me so long<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wean myself off magazines</font>

96
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,170
I then bought my first issue of vogue in

97
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,420
a really really really long time only to

98
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,069
buy a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dress that looks vaguely similar</font>

99
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,720
to Jennifer Lawrence's on the cover of

<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi Jennifer Lawrence Jennifer</font>

104
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,909
throwing at you how do you create for an

105
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,860
individual and a group at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time</font>

106
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,440
without negating one or the other and is

107
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,709
the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> delusion yeah</font>
