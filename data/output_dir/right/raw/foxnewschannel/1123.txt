INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT THAT

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:04,597
THAT DATE COULD FLIP.

3
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:05,331
>> Shannon: WILL WAIT AND SEE.

4
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:08,835
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:09,569
RUDY GIULIANI SAYS THE SPECIAL

6
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,005
PROSECUTOR'S TEAM IS TRYING TO

7
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:13,640
FRAME THE PRESIDENT.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,841
GIULIANI MADE THE COMMENT ABOUT

9
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:15,608
ROBERT MUELLER DURING AN

10
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:17,610
INTERVIEW IN ISRAEL.

11
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,213
>> A GROUP OF 13 HIGHLY PARTISAN

12
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:22,215
DEMOCRATS THAT MAKE UP THE

13
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:23,817
MUELLER TEAM, EXCLUDING HIM, ARE

14
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:27,020
TRYING VERY, VERY HARD TO FRAME

15
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,287
HIM.

16
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:29,189
TO GET HIM IN TROUBLE WHEN HE

17
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,291
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

18
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,926
>> Shannon: GIULIANI SAYS THE

19
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:33,893
MUELLER TEAM CANNOT COME TO

20
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:34,561
GRIPS WITH THE FACT THAT

21
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:37,230
COLLUSION DID NOT HAPPEN.

22
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,631
MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE CAN GO

23
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:40,600
AHEAD WITH THEIR SUMMER VACATION

24
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:40,900
PLANS.

25
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,235
THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER SAYS

26
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:45,205
THE AUGUST RECESS IS STILL ON.

27
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,407
EVEN AS SENATORS PLAN TO WORK

28
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:48,408
THROUGH MOST OF IT.

29
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:50,343
EXACTLY WHAT THOSE SENATORS WILL

30
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,811
BE WORKING ON, THAT IS STILL

31
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,012
UNDECIDED.

32
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,048
HERE IS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL

33
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:55,715
CORRESPONDENT MIKE EMANUEL.

34
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,450
>> MAJORITY LEADER.

35
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,284
>> MITCH MCCONNELL MAY HAVE

36
00:00:58,284 --> 00:00:59,686
BOUGHT HIMSELF MORE TIME TO

37
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,888
CHECK SOME ITEMS OFF HIS LIST OF

38
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:02,288
PRIORITIES.

39
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:05,558
>> WE NEED TO CONFIRM MORE OF

40
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:06,326
THE PRESIDENTS TEAM AND JUDICIAL

41
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:07,026
NOMINEES.

42
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,428
WE NEED TO TAKE UP REGULAR

43
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:09,629
APPROPRIATION BILLS.

44
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:10,864
WE NEED TO TACKLE LEGISLATIVE

45
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,031
PRIORITIES LIKE THE WATER AND

46
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,833
FOR STRUCTURE BILL, THE FARM

47
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:14,634
BILL, DEFENSE BILL AND MANY

48
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:15,468
OTHERS.

49
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:17,070
THE SENATE WILL REMAIN IN

50
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,837
SESSION.

51
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:19,672
>> ONE G.O.P. SENATOR HAS A

52
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:21,274
PRIORITY OF HIS OWN.

53
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:22,008
KEEPING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TRADE

54
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,010
POLICIES IN CHECK.

55
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,879
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE UTILIZING IT

56
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,482
IN THIS UNPRECEDENTED WAY, WE

57
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:32,585
HAVE ASKED, HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE

58
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:33,052
THE THINGS.

59
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,187
ONCE YOU COMPLETE THE WORK, YOU

60
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:37,023
HAVE TO SUBMIT A TEST FOR

61
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:38,291
APPROVAL BECAUSE TARIFFS AND

62
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,225
REVENUES ARE THE

63
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,393
RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONGRESS,

64
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:41,094
NOT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

65
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:43,096
>> DEMOCRATIC LEADER TIPPED HIS

66
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:44,631
HAT ON HOW HE WANTS TO SPEND

67
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:47,267
AUGUST NOW THAT THE SENATE IS IN

68
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:47,667
SESSION.

69
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:50,036
>> WHY DON'T WE GET SOMETHING

70
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:51,271
DONE ON THE ISSUE THAT NUMEROUS

71
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:55,408
POLLS SAY IS THE NUMBER ONE

72
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:57,477
PRIORITY OF AMERICANS?

73
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:57,877
HEALTH CARE.

74
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:00,413
WE DEMOCRATS, OUR ENTIRE CAUCUS,

75
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:01,748
BELIEVES THIS PREVIOUSLY ON

76
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:02,448
SCHEDULED SESSION TIME CAN BE

77
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:05,218
PUT TO GOOD USE.

78
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:07,854
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP APPLAUDED

79
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:08,822
McCONNELL'S CALL, SAYING

80
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:09,155
"GREAT.

81
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:10,423
MAYBE THE DEMOCRATS WILL FINALLY

82
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:11,925
GET SOMETHING DONE OTHER THAN

83
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:12,892
THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF HIGH CRIME

84
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:15,628
AND HIGH TAXES."

85
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:17,931
HIS PRAISE MAY HAVE FALLEN ON

86
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:18,898
DEAF EARS WITH KEVIN McCARTHY

87
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:21,067
WHO SAID HE HAS NO PLANS TO KEEP

88
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,669
THE HOUSE OPEN, TELLING

89
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:23,636
REPORTERS I UNDERSTAND WHY THE

90
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:25,305
SENATE NEEDS TO FINISH THEIR

91
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:25,839
WORK.

92
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,842
WE HAVE BEEN DOING OUR WORK.

93
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:30,310
THE MAN WHOSE JOB McCARTHY IS

94
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,444
EYEING WANTS TO THREAD THE

95
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:32,679
NEEDLE ON THE ISSUE THAT

96
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:33,847
THREATENS TO DERAIL THE G.O.P.

97
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:35,882
>> I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE KIND OF

98
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:37,383
CONVERSATIONS WE ARE HAVING.

99
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:38,251
OUR MEMBERS ARE EARNEST AND

100
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,386
SINCERE IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

101
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,020
EACH OTHER'S PERSPECTIVES.

102
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,590
WE HAVE A BIG, BIG SWAP OF VIEWS

103
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,090
IN THE CONFERENCE.

104
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,260
I DO BELIEVE THERE'S A SWEET

105
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,560
SPOT.

106
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,029
>> TO BE CLEAR, McCARTHY IS

107
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:50,663
NOT ATTACKING McCONNELL.

108
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,131
HE'S NOTING THAT THE HOUSE THIS

109
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,400
PAST HUNDREDS MORE BILLS, AND HE

110
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,336
BLAMES SENATE DEMOCRATS FOR

111
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:57,036
OBSTRUCTION.

112
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:58,204
WITH SOME ITEMS ON THE TO-DO

113
00:02:58,204 --> 00:00:00,000
LIST CONTROVERSIAL, IT MIGHT
