>> Jon: MIKE, THANKS.
>> Sandra: LET'S GO TO OUR
HEADLINER THIS MORNING, ALAN
DERSHOWITZ JOINS US.
HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR.
NOW IMPEACHING KAVANAUGH?
DOES IT LOOK LIKE DEMOCRATS ARE
PLANNING A STRATEGY TO DO SO?
>> THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY
FOOLISH, INCONSISTENT AND
HYPOCRITICAL.
THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT BILL
CLINTON SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
IMPEACHED FOR ALLEGEDLY LYING
ABOUT HIS SEX LIFE ARE NOW
GOING TO LEAD THE CAMPAIGN TO
IMPEACH KAVANAUGH FOR ALLEGEDLY
LYING ABOUT HIS SEXUAL AND
DRINKING ACTIVITIES BACK WHEN
HE WAS A 17-YEAR-OLD?
IT'S HYPOCRISY  RUN RAMPANT.
NOR WOULD IT PERMIT USING THE
LAWS OF PERJURY WHICH ARE TOUGH.
THEY HAVE TO BE ABOUT A
MATERIAL FACT THAT HAS TO HAVE
BEEN A DELIBERATE LIE, NOT
FORGETFULNESS OR BOAST OR
EXAGGERATION BUT A MATERIAL LIE.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE SHOOTING
THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT.
WE OUGHT TO BE MOVING FORWARD.
LET'S JUDGE JUSTICE KAVANAUGH
ON HIS PERFORMANCE AS A JUSTICE
OF THE SUPREME COURT.
I'M PARTICULARLY OUTRAGED AT MY
COLLEAGUES AND STUDENTS AT
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, THOSE OF
THEM WHO HAVE MADE IT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR KAVANAUGH TO
CONTINUE TO TEACH THERE.
IT IS RAMPANT MCCARTHYISM AT
ITS WORST REMINISCENT OF WHAT I
EXPERIENCED AS A STUDENT IN THE
50s WHERE PROFESSORS WERE FIRED
BECAUSE THEY WHEN 17 OR 20
YEARS OLD THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY.
WE HAVE TO PUT AN END TO THIS
AND THESE KIND OF VENGEANCE
INQUISITIONS HAVE TO STOP.
>> Sandra: WE'VE COME TO THIS
POINT.
DOES IT GET WORSE OR BETTER?
WHAT CHANGES?
>> I THINK THE LEADERSHIP OF
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TO
TAKE CONTROL OVER THE ROGUE
MEMBERS AND TELL INDIVIDUALS
LIKE MAXINE WATERS WHO SAYS SHE
WANTS TO IMPEACH VIRTUALLY
EVERYBODY FOR EVERYTHING
INCLUDING MIKE PENCE, THAT
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY IS ALL ABOUT.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TO
BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM, HAS TO
LOOK TO THE FUTURE.
LOOK, THE DEMOCRATS LOST THIS
ELECTION.
THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO
APPOINT A CONSERVATIVE.
IF IT WASN'T KAVANAUGH IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY MAYBE EVEN
TO THE RIGHT OF KAVANAUGH.
THE IDEA OF SEARCHING FOR
REASONS NOT TO CONFIRM AND
VIOLATING ALL KINDS OF DUE
PROCESS.
NOW COMES THE ACLU WHICH PUTS
MONEY BEFORE PRINCIPLE AND MY
QUESTION TO THE ACLU, HOW WILL
YOU APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE
SUPREME COURT NOW?
YOU'VE ALIENATED ONE OF THE
JUSTICES, MAYBE EVEN MORE.
I THINK THE ACLU HAS LOST ITS
CREDIBILITY AS A LITIGATION ARM
OF THE PROGRESSIVE CAUSE.
AND THEY MAY HAVE TO RECUSE
THEMSELVES WHEN THEY COME IN
FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT.
THIS HAS BECOME A TOTAL MESS
AND WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO MOVE
FORWARD AND NOT TAKE REVENGE
FOR PAST LOSSES.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE WRITTEN A
FASCINATING OP-ED ON FOX
NEWS.COM.
I WOULD URGE OUR VIEWERS TO
READ IT SAYING YOU'RE A LIBERAL
DEMOCRAT AND LIKE TO SEE
DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK CONTROL OF
THE HOUSE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: IF THAT HAPPENS JERROLD
NADLER WOULD BE THE SPEAKER.
>> THIS HAS TO BE THOROUGHLY
INVESTIGATED.
I HOPE THE SENATE WILL DO SO.
IF HE IS ON THE SUPREME COURT
AND THE SENATE HASN'T
INVESTIGATED, THEN I THINK THE
HOUSE WILL HAVE TO.
>> Jon: WHAT WOULD BE YOUR
ADVICE TO REPRESENTATIVE NADLER?
>> FIRST OF ALL, DO NOT -- DO
NOT MOVE TOWARD IMPEACHMENT.
HE HASN'T MENTIONED THE I WORD
IMPEACHMENT YET.
AS FAR AS AN INVESTIGATION IS
CONCERNED, WOULD IT BE ABOUT
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS?
LET'S HAVE A BIPARTISAN
INVESTIGATION AND SEE IF WE CAN
IMPROVE THE PROCESS.
MAYBE HAVE MORE CHECKS, F.B.I.
CHECKS PRIOR TO A NOMINEE BEING
NOMINATED SO WE DON'T HAVE
THESE KINDS OF SURPRISES.
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS.
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO.
MAYBE HAVE A COMMISSION THAT
NOMINATES TO THE PRESIDENT THE
10 MOST DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE
WHO COULD SERVE ON THE SUPREME
COURT AND LET THE PRESIDENT
AGREE TO PICK FROM THAT INSTEAD
OF PICKING FROM THE FEDERALIST
SOCIETY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT
CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE
PROCESS.
INVESTIGATING KAVANAUGH IS NOT
ONE OF THEM.
IMPEACHING KAVANAUGH IS
CERTAINLY NOT ANOTHER OF THEM.
>> Sandra: DESPITE WHAT WE TALK
ABOUT TODAY, ALAN DERSHOWITZ,
THERE ARE STILL MANY DEMOCRATS
VOWING A FIGHT INCLUDING HIRONO
FROM HAWAII.
HER LATEST THINKING.
>> SHOULD BRETT KAVANAUGH BE
IMPEACHED IF DEMOCRATS TAKE
CONTROL?
>> I'M MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE
HERE AND NOW WHICH IS WE HAVE
AN ELECTION COMING UP AND I'VE
SAID TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE
JUSTIFIABLY ANGRY BUT
DETERMINED.
I SAID THEY SHOULD BE JUST
FOCUSED LIKE A LASER BEAM.
>> Sandra: WE'RE LEFT WONDERING
WHAT THAT MEANS, ALAN.
SHE DID NOT SAY NO TO A FIGHT
FOR IMPEACHMENT.
>> I THINK SHE IS RIGHT.
I THINK DEMOCRATS SHOULD FOCUS
AND TRY TO TAKE OVER THE HOUSE.
THAT BECOMES AN IMPORTANT PART
OF OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND
BALANCES.
IF THE DEMOCRATS CAN TAKE OVER
THE SENATE THEY'LL HAVE
ENORMOUS INFLUENCE ON THE NEXT
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE.
THAT OUGHT TO BE THE FOCUS.
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS NOT MY
CHOICE.
I'M A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT.
I WOULD HAVE APPOINTED MERRICK
GARLAND AGAIN BUT THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE TO BE WISE AND SENSIBLE
AND JUST AND MORAL AND NOT
VIOLATE DUE PROCESS AND CIVIL
LIBERTIES IN AN INTEREST OF
WRECKING REVENGE ON A LOSS THAT
WAS IN LARGE PART
SELF-INFLICTED BY EXTREMISTS
WITHIN THE PARTY.
>> Jon: I WANT TO READ PART OF
THAT FOX OP-ED YOU WROTE.
YOU SAY DEMOCRATS MAY TRY TO
MOVE IT FORWARD BY ALLEGING THE
GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT INCLUDE
PERJURY COMMITTED BY NOMINEE
KAVANAUGH BUT THAT WOULD -- IN
HIS TESTIMONY AT THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
CONFIRMATION HEARING BUT THAT
WOULD BE A PLOY.
YOU THINK THERE ARE COMPARISONS
BETWEEN HIM AND CLINTON.
>> THE IRONY IS THE VERY SAME
PEOPLE -- THE VERY SAME PEOPLE
WHO JUSTLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE
USE OF PERJURY AGAINST BILL
CLINTON ARE NOW DEMANDING THE
USE OF PERJURY AGAINST
KAVANAUGH.
DO THEY HAVE NO SHAME?
DO THEY HAVE NO MEMORY?
DO THEY HAVE NO CONCERN ABOUT
BEING CALLED HYPOCRITES?
IS IT REALLY THE CASE THAT IF
THE SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT
THE PRINCIPLE GOES OUT THE
WINDOW?
SHAME ON DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD
APPLY THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT
THEY OPPOSED WHEN BILL CLINTON
WAS IMPEACHED TO IMPEACH A
SITTING JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
COURT.
SHAME ON THEM.
>> Sandra: I THINK IT WAS
HIRONO WHO WE HEARD FROM ALSO
SAID LOOKING FORWARD BRETT
KAVANAUGH'S TIME ON THE SUPREME
COURT WILL BE TAINTED WAS THE
WORD SHE USED.
SHE SAID THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
AN ASTERISK NEXT TO HIS NAME.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HIS TIME ON
THE SUPREME COURT TO LOOK LIKE
CONSIDERING THIS INTENSE FIGHT
HE WENT THROUGH FOR
CONFIRMATION?
>> HE WILL BE LIKE OTHER
JUSTICES, A CONSERVATIVE.
HE WILL MOVE THE COURT SLIGHTLY
TO THE RIGHT.
MY HOPE -- MY HOPE IS HAVING
BEEN THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE
EXPERIENCE MAYBE HIS
SENSITIVITIES WILL INCREASE
TOWARD DUE PROCESS, CIVIL
LIBERTIES, THE RIGHT OF FREE
SPEECH.
BUT THE ASTERISK NEXT TO HIS
NAME IS RIDICULOUS.
HE WAS CONFIRMED.
HE WILL SERVE ON THE SUPREME
COURT.
THERE WILL BE NO ASTERISK, HE
WILL BE JUDGED LIKE EVERY OTHER
JUSTICE.
I WILL AGREE WITH SOME OF HIS
OPINIONS AND OPPOSE OTHERS, I
WILL WRITE OP YESTERDAY ON THE
OPINIONS I DISAGREE WITH.
THAT'S HOW OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS
AND BALANCES SHOULD OPERATE
>> Sandra: YOU SAID AN
INVESTIGATION INTO 36-YEAR-OLD
