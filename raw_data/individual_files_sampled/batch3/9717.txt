W"WH THE * W"WATTHE * W"WATTEE * W"WATTERS * W"WATTERS'* W"WATTERS' WORLD" STARTS RIGHT NOW. JESSE: A TALE OF TWO TOURS. BEFORE BARACK OBAMA WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT HE FLEW TO EUROPE AND THE SOCIALIST CROWDS LOVED HIM. HE SAID THIS. A CITIZEN. A PROUD CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES AND A FELLOW CITIZEN OF THE WORLD. JESSE: YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER AFTER HIS ELECTION HE EMBARKED ON THE APOLOGY TOUR. IN AMERICA THERE IS A FAILURE TO APPRECIATE EUROPE'S LEADING ROLE IN THE WORLD. DISMISSIVE AND DER DISMISSIVE AND -ER DISMISSIVE AND R DISMISSIVE AND AND DER HAS SHOWN ARROGANCE AND BEEN DISMISSIVE AND AND DERISIVE. JESSE: THE MEDIA ATE THIS UP. OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY WAS A DISASTER, THE VOTERS REJECTED LEADING FROM BEHIND. ENTER DONALD TRUMP. HERE HE IS IN EUROPE ON HIS AMERICA FIRST TOUR URGING NATO TO PAY THEIR BILLS. PRESIDENT TRUMP: MANY COUNTRIES ARE NOT BUYING THEY SHOULD AND THEY OWE US A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT COUNTRIES AND THEY MAKE A FIVE LINE DEAL WITH RUSSIA WHERE THEY PUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE COFFERS OF RUSSIA. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOU FROM RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE PUTTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO RUSSIA. GERMANY WILL HAVE 70% OF THEIR COUNTRY CONTROLLED BY RUSSIA 1%. AMERICA IN ACTUAL NUMBERS IS PAYING 4.2%, AND I THINK THAT'S ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD IT OR THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVES. JESSE: TRUMP WANTS GERMANY BUYING ENERGY WHY AMERICA, NOT RUSSIA. THE PRESIDENT DEPLOYING I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT WHAT AM I. INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE I CAN IMAGINE. ANOTHER ONLY BEEN FISH AIRY OF TRUMP TEMPERATURES HAVOC IS VLADIMIR PUTIN. JESSE: I REMEMBER WHEN ASKING WEALTHY PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR FAIR EVERYONE TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. JESSE: TRUMP IS TRYING TO STRENGTHEN NADINE PEEL GERMANY REMEMBER HE WAS CAUGHT TAPPING ANGELA MERKEL'S CELL PHONE. HE WAS CAUGHT TRASHING NETANYAHU. HE LEFT IRAQ TO ISIS AND IRAN. FROM INVADING UKRAINE. AND AFTER ALL THE FAKE NEWS CHAOS HE MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP: IT WAS A PRODUCT IDEA SUMMIT WHERE MY JOB PRIORITY WAS GETTING OTHER NATO MEMBERS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE HAVE GOTTEN COMMITMENTS FROM THEM TO PAY FEAR THEIR DEFENSE
