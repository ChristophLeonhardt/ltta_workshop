1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,890
Astronaut ice cream...is not something we
eat because it tastes good.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,730
“Oh, I think I broke a tooth!”
“Very chalky.”

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,929
“Some kind of flavored medicine.”
“It’s the marshmallow bits in Lucky Charms.”

4
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,140
We do it because “it’s what the astronauts
eat.”

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,080
But here’s the problem.
“Is that what this video’s about? Do they

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,480
not actually eat space ice cream in space?”
Astronaut ice cream is a lie. A crumbly, chalky

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,010
lie.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,750
This is the National Air and Space Museum’s
Storage Facility. It really looks like something

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,850
from Indiana Jones. And they have
a lot of space food.

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,210
Stuff like John Glenn’s feeding tube,
Apollo era chocolate cubes

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,850
and the solar system’s greatest cookie feeder.
“The dispenser on the tube here is very

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,460
much like what you would think of as a Pez
dispenser.”

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,789
But when you ask to see the astronaut ice
cream:

14
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,649
“We don’t have any.”
It’s surprisingly hard to track down the

15
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:03,969
truth about the stuff.
The only original info we have is a press

16
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:09,770
release from NASA and a newspaper clipping
from 1968 suggesting that vanilla ice cream

17
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,389
might have gone up on Apollo 7.
The people who make astronaut ice cream can’t

18
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,359
confirm it either.
“Right now I’m going to be calling the

19
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,119
people who make this.”
“I can not verify one way or the other.

20
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,179
I wasn’t with the company then.”
So I called an astronaut who was actually

21
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:30,889
there.
“I’m Walter Cunningham, I flew on Apollo

22
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:38,779
7, October 11th through 22nd, 1968.”
It was the first manned mission after a deadly

23
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:44,349
cabin fire on Apollo 1, and Cunningham, Wally
Schirra, and Donn Eisele had big worries.

24
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:50,310
“Meals were scheduled and we put up with
them — we put up with them because we were

25
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,359
really there to test the spacecraft and we
were busy all the time.”

26
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,809
But I asked about astronaut ice cream anyway.
“The only citation I’ve found is people

27
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:04,270
saying it flew on Apollo 7. Is that true?”
“No, they don’t know their ass, obviously.

28
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,889
We never had that.”
Cunningham says it was one of many myths that

29
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:13,659
just got repeated by the press. Like the legendary
cold that all the crew members had?

30
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:19,849
“Pure bullshit. I never had a cold, I think
Donn thought he might be getting one, but

31
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:26,290
Wally’s the one that had a cold.”
And the transcripts don’t show ice cream

32
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,760
either — there was a lot of chatter about
other foods like the many puddings on board.

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,170
The Apollo list was primarily rehydratable
foods — like salmon salad, not ice cream.

34
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,150
And for the most part, astronauts hated sweet
foods. They traded a lot of food on board,

35
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,069
and sweet stuff was awful. They tried to get
rid of their puddings. Donn Eisele said:

36
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,620
“Wally and I want to give away our butterscotch
pudding, but nobody will take it.”

37
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,640
But even out of the hated sweet foods, Cunningham
says astronaut ice cream was not one of the

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,290
options.
“After it came out, and I was long gone

39
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,170
from NASA, I remember thinking, gee, wouldn’t
it have been nice if we had that.”

40
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,150
And it makes sense if you know about space
travel, too.

41
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,950
“Plus it’s super crumbly, so I just imagine
all these particles floating through…”

42
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,329
“Flying into the controls...”
“These bite-sized objects were designed

43
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,560
to remove the problem of having so many crumbs
floating around the cabin.”

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,060
Look at Neil Armstrong’s fruitcake. See
how it has a gelatin layer on it? That helped

45
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,530
reduce crumbling in early missions.
And food just got better anyway. By Skylab’s

46
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,480
launching in 1973, they had a freezer on board.
Today, astronaut ice cream is...normal ice

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,170
cream.
But that didn’t stop NASA, museums, and

48
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,430
space camps from selling the imaginary “space
food” to generations of kids.

49
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,359
There is a better way. Sell kids astronaut
peach ambrosia, astronaut shrimp cocktail,

50
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:01,670
or astronaut crawfish etouffee.
Or sell the thing that Walt Cunningham loved

51
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,739
so much he smuggled it in his suit in case
Apollo 7 was marooned.

52
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,480
“Before launch, we put a few things in our
pockets in case we aborted during launch and

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,029
would be out at sea some place. We wanted
to have a little food with us in case we needed

54
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,179
it.

55
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,690
“And I had those bacon squares down in the
pocket down in the bottom of my suit.”

56
00:04:23,690 --> 00:00:00,000
Teach the children about astronaut bacon.
But let the ice cream go.
