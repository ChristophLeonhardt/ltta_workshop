RESISTANCE. THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S "ANGLE" ." TODAY THE WORLD WATCHED AS DONALD TRUMP MADE GOOD ON HIS PROMISE TO MOVE THE U.S. EMBASSY IN ISRAEL TO JERUSALEM. THREE PREVIOUS AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAD PROMISED TO DO THIS. JERUSALEM IS STILL THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND MUST REMAIN AN UNDIVIDED CITY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. AS SOON AS I TAKE OFFICE I WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE CITY OF ISRAEL HAS CHOSEN THE CITY OF ISRAEL HAS CHOSEI THE CITY OF ISRAEL HAS CHOSES CAPITAL. JERUSALEM WILL REMAIN THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND IT MUST REMAIN UNDIVIDED. Laura: BUT ONE FROM PROMISED, HE ACTUALLY DELIVERED. REMEMBER, CONGRESS PASSED A LAW AUTHORIZING THE EMBASSY TO MOVE BACK IN 1995, BUT EVERY PRESIDENT HAS DELAYED IT UNTIL NOW. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL, CELEBRATED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MOMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAME THE FIRST WORLD LEADER TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS OUR CAPITAL AND TODAY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS OPENING ITS EMBASSY RIGHT HERE IN JERUSALEM. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO KEEP YOUR PROMISES. IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR OUR FANTASTIC PARTNERSHIP, BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ALSO A GREAT DAY FOR PEACE. Laura: OF COURSE IF ISRAEL IS JUBILANT AND TRUMP CHALKS UP ANOTHER ACHIEVEMENT, WELL WELL WELL THE MEDIA REFLEXIVELY WHALE AND FAILED POLITICIANS AND DIPLOMATS OF YESTERYEAR GROUSE. IT DOESN'T HELP. TO SOME EXTENT IT HURTS, BUT IT EXPOSES A LACK OF A DIPLOMATIC STRATEGY. I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEING IT AND UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE GOING TO BE IF THEY DO ACTUALLY WANT TO RESTART THE PEACE PROCESS. THIS DECISION WAS ON BOARD AND ON TETHERED. PEACE PROCESS IS COMATOSE. IN THE LONG RUN IT WILL NOT ADVANCE PEACE PROCESS. IT WILL MAKE HIS OWN POLICY MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE AND IMPLEMENT. THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE, AND IT GREATLY INFLAMES AN ALREADY VERY Laura: AS OPPOSED TO WHAT? GEORGE MITCHELL, WHAT YOU NEGOTIATED? LOOK, IF THE OLD GUARD, THE SO-CALLED WISEMAN OF DIPLOMACY KNEW SO MUCH, SUCH SMART GUYS, WHY ARE WE STILL STRUGGLING IN 2018 TO BRING PEACE TO THE REGION? YOU HAD YOUR SHOT AND IT DIDN'T WORK. AND LET'S FACE IT. NOW IT'S TRUMP'S TURN. SO WHAT THE CRITICS FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENGAGED IN AN INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY THAT IS ALREADY PAYING SOME DIVIDENDS. HE'S REMAKING ALLIANCES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND TAKING THE OLD BARGAINING CHIPS OFF THE TABLE. HE'S CHANGING THE OLD AND FRANKLY THE STALE DYNAMIC THAT WAS IN PLACE. TRUMP IS A REORDERING THE STATUS QUO AND HE'S FORCING OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS INTO NEW WAYS OF THINKING AND ACTING, EVEN IF IT SEEMS UNCOMFORTABLE. SAY WHAT YOU WANT, AND A LOT OF YOU DO, ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S APPROACH, BUT HE HAS REINVIGORATED THE PROSPECTS OF PEACE IN PLACES WE NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT CHANGE WHATEVER HAPPENED. AND HE'S CREATED NEW POSSIBILITIES. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ONLY A YEAR AGO THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD BE WILLING TO MELT DOWN ITS NUCLEAR TESTING FACILITIES OR EVEN COME TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE? NO ONE THOUGHT THAT, EXCEPT MAYBE PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF. AT HOME, THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING AND THE PRESIDENT IS DEMONSTRATING THAT BOLD, INNOVATIVE LEADERSHIP CAN GET REAL RESULTS ABROAD AND AT HOME. HE'S APPOINTING TOPS ARE NOT LEGAL MINDS TO THE FEDERAL BENCH, WE KNOW THAT. HE IS UNTANGLING REGULATIONS THAT CHOKE, STIFLE AMERICAN BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. AND NOW HE'S EVEN TACKLING PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. HE DID THAT LAST WEEK AND IS GOING TO BE WORKING ON THAT. SO EVEN AS THE MEDIA ARE LOATH TO COVER ANY OF THIS, AT LEAST FAIRLY, THE PUBLIC I THINK GETS IT. SO TRUMP'S NUMBERS ARE CLIMBING. BUT THE ONLY GROUP OF COURSE THAT HASN'T GOTTEN THE MEMO IS THE RESISTANCE MEDIA AND THEIR PALS IN POLITICS. THEY CONSISTENTLY IGNORE THE PRESIDENT'S ACHIEVEMENTS WHILE GRASPING AT ANY STRAW TO ASSAIL HIM. TODAY'S STRAW WAS A SIDE COMMENT MADE LAST WEEK BY A WHITE HOUSE AIDE DURING A PRIVATE MEETING ABOUT AILING SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. A WHITE HOUSE AIDE MARKS HIM AND THEY INTERJECT THAT THEY STAND WITH THE PERSON MOCKING JOHN McCAIN FOR HAVING BRAIN CANCER. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN APOLOGIES AND IT'S EASY TO ASSUME THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS OKAY WITH THIS BEING SAID. SHE HAS STILL NOT PUBLICLY APOLOGIZED AND SHE IS STILL AN EMPLOYEE HERE AT THE THIS SHOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE CULTURE OF THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS, LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE, REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. THAT THERE HAS BEEN A KIND OF INDECENCY THAT HAS BEEN PERMITTED. Laura: I'M SORRY. I HAD TO BE AWAKEN FROM THAT MONTAGE. COME ON. THE STAFF CALLED McCAIN'S FAMILY PERSONALLY AND APOLOGIZED. THEY WANT A PUBLIC APOLOGY FOR WHAT WAS A PRIVATE, LEAKED COMMENT. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS THIS AFTERNOON. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT TEAM OBAMA SET ABOUT TRUMP AND HIS STAFF, HIS TEAM OR ANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS? I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THEY SAID. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT. TRYING TO REVIVE THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ABOUT McCAIN MADE DURING THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT HIM BEING A P.O.W., WHICH WERE UNFORTUNATE COMMENTS, BUT TO DO THAT IN AN EFFORT TO SOMEHOW HURT TRUMP NOW. IT DIDN'T WORK THEN AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK NOW. WHILE THE MEDIA AND THEIR FRIENDS IN POLITICS OBSESS ABOUT THOUGHTLESS COMMENTS AND NONESSENTIALS, A FEW MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA SEEM INTERESTED IN DOING THEIR ACTUAL JOBS. PURSUING THE STORIES THAT ACTUALLY TOUCH AND AFFECT OUR LIVES. WHAT ABOUT HOLDING OUR INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT PAY THE BILL. WHY ARE THE MEDIA SO IN CURIOUS ABOUT FBI'S INVESTIGATION OF HILLARY CLINTON AND COMEY'S DECISION NOT TO INDICT HER? WHAT ABOUT THE REPORTS OF PARTISANSHIP IN THE FBI? POSSIBLE CORRUPTION WITHIN THE MUELLER PRO. WHERE IS THE REPORTING ON DEVIN NUNES ATTEMPT TO GET THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO HAND OVER DOCUMENTS EXPLAINING HOW THE FBI'S RUSSIAN COLLUSION PROBE STARTED AND WHO ACTUALLY STARTED AT? HE HAD TO THREATEN ROD ROSENSTEIN WITH IMPEACHMENT BASICALLY TO GET A RESPONSE. AND HE STILL HASN'T SEEN ALL THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION. ISN'T THAT WORTH INVESTIGATING? PUT TRUMP ASIDE AND WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT HIM ASIDE. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI STONEWALLING THOSE WITH ACTUAL OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY. OR HAVE PORN STARS AND RUSSIAN COLLUSION CONSPIRACY THEORIES SAPPED ALL THE MEDIA'S MANPOWER AND ALL OF THEIR ENERGY AND RESOURCES? IF THE PRESS, THINK ABOUT THIS, SPENT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TIME COVERING SOME OF THOSE STORIES, IT MAY BE MORE AMERICANS MIGHT LISTEN WHEN THEY REPORTED CRITICALLY ON THE PRESIDENT. BUT SO LONG AS THE PRESS IS JUST A WING OF THE RESISTANCE, THEIR AUDIENCE WILL SCATTER, IT WILL DWINDLE AND SOON MOST OF AMERICA WILL JUST TUNE THEM OUT. SO GO AHEAD AND COVER CRITICISM OF THE PRESIDENT BUT ONCE IN A WHILE JUST TRY BALANCING OUT WHAT SOME HONEST COVERAGE OF SOME OF THE GROUNDBREAKING SUCCESSES IN THE REAL ACHIEVEMENTS. WE ALL NEED THE PRESS TO HOLD EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE. TRUMP SURELY, BUT ALSO THE OTHER
