welcome back everybody joining us from Washington with a look at Axios am editor-in-chief for Axios Nicholas Johnson Nicola it's good morning to you talk to us about access is one big thing today yeah our one big thing today is looking at a collection of data points to try and put this year's midterms in the context of other big wave elections where the minority party swept into power in the house and our conclusion is that it's looking good for Democrats looking at a handful of these numbers particularly presidential approval rating congressional approval rating and the breakdown of approval ratings between each of the parties it matches up very well for Democrats with other elections when the minority party swept into control in the house Berkeley 2006 and 2010 when Republicans and Democrats and Republicans respectively conquered the house is another data point for us showing that November is looking pretty good for House Democrats so to that point how are you guys able to explain that or is there any data points that explain why this trend is it because the Democrats have a clear political vision that people are rallying about getting excited about or is this kind of a problem with the Republican platform from the President on down that's alienating people and triggering this potential blue wave yeah the big numbers that match up the prior wave elections are both people not happy with the president people not happy with the party in power and people not happy with the direction of the country this is very much an election I think that'll hinge upon President Trump a lot of his backers of course will come out and support Republican candidates we've got polling that shows when he endorses a candidate they do a little bit better in subsequent races and so it'll very much be Democrats running against Republicans and certainly against President Trump if they're gonna win the house action are we still very much seeing this as local races that's very much dependent on the candidate yeah what I think both sides are trying to do if they don't have a strong local candidate is to nationalize the election Democrats very much want to run against Trump when places where he's unpopular and then of course those states those red states where there are blue senators in particular that's where Republicans definitely want to make Trump the issue because he has more support there let's talk about what is different about the political climate in this country this year compared to where it has been in previous years right there's one outlier in this chart and that is democratic I mean voter enthusiasm Democrats certainly come across as more enthusiastic about voting in this year's midterms than Republicans but compared to some of the big sweeping wave elections earlier this century it's not quite as high so that's a little bit of a red flag for Democrats they have to get their people out to vote if they're gonna get this win yeah we're a few months away but obviously a lot of tension already building up around these midterms Nicholas Johnson thank you very much of freshman we're reading axiom in just a bit and you too can sign up for the newsletter by going to sign up Axios dot-com hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
