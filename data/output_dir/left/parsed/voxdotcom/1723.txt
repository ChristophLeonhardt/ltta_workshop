Hi, hello what's up!
Hey
It's so cold :(
We've got a big
announcement for you today.
If you're a subscriber you've probably noticed that
we've been asking for your help a lot
more in the past year in the community
tab.
Now we're going to make that
experiment bigger.
Way bigger.
Wo we're
starting this huge new show with YouTube Originals
where we'll look at some of
today's most important issues and we
want to start with your questions.
What is the most important question in your
world that desperately needs to be
examined, answered, or explained in 2019?
It can be anything, from health and
science and money to tech, relationships
the government and beyond.
Could we engineer a technological
solution for climate change?
Why are more
women all over the world giving birth by
c-section?
Why is it so important? Why
does it affect your daily life? We're
gonna choose 12 questions and if your
question is selected, you'll be invited
to be part of the show.
All you need to
do is send us a cell phone video like this.
The resulting show is gonna debut
in 2019 right here on Vox's YouTube
channel.
Yeah.
So click on the link in the
comments below and tell us a bit about
you and why this question matters in your life.
Thank you!
