according to the New York Times someone close to the president wants the world to know they think he is unfit to hold the highest office anonymously writing this op-ed describing the president as amoral and his leadership style as impetuous adversarial petty and ineffective they also say the cabinet considered invoking the 25th amendment which could have removed him from office but say they chose not to provoke a constitutional crisis this is an extraordinary step and the label of senior official means it was likely written by someone close to the president he was quick to lash out so when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons now and the New York Times is failing if I weren't here I believe the New York Times probably wouldn't even exist the White House spokesperson issued a statement calling on the author to quit labeling them a coward meanwhile some Republicans were quick to try and downplay this unprecedented editorial I didn't think that anything was relayed in that op-ed that was new I mean I think this is what all of us have understood to be the situation from day one so again it's not very it didn't reveal much to me I understand this is the case the president took to Twitter casting doubt on the existence of the source but then said if they do exist they must be turned over to the government for national security tweeting a simple word treason this is a president in many ways under siege under pressure for multiple investigations and now undermined by a member of his own staff in a most public way patty call haines al jazeera washington
