1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:02,530
Ask your Hep C Specialist
about Harvoni.

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,138
>> Shannon: LAST CHECK.

3
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:12,206
BABY EVANS IS STILL CLINGING TO

4
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:12,506
LIFE.

5
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:14,075
DOCTORS REPORTEDLY DID NOT

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:15,042
EXPECT TO HAPPEN.

7
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:17,078
HERE'S A 23-MONTH-OLD TODDLER

8
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:18,412
WHO CAPTIVATED THE WORLD.

9
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:19,614
HOSPITAL AUTHORITIES SAID HE HAD

10
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:21,315
NO CHANCE FOR A LIFE MOVING

11
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:22,750
FORWARD SO, THEY HAVE TAKEN OFF

12
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,451
HIS LIFE SUPPORT.

13
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:25,386
SO HE'S NOT GETTING FOOD, BUT

14
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:27,421
WATTORE AND REPORTEDLY SOME

15
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:27,755
OXYGEN.

16
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:29,657
HIS DISTRESSED PARENTS BY HIS

17
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:29,957
SIDE.

18
00:00:29,957 --> 00:00:31,692
THEY WANT TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THE

19
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:33,227
COUNTRY FOR ALTERNATIVE CARE,

20
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,629
BUT HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY THE

21
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:39,267
BRITISH GOVERNMENT.

22
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:40,034
DR. SEGAL JOINS US TO TALK ABOUT

23
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:41,068
THE TOUGH CASE.

24
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:42,503
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US WHAT DO

25
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:44,238
YOU MAKE OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE

26
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:44,605
CASE?

27
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:46,574
>> IT IS REALLY A SHOCKING CASE,

28
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:46,908
SHANNON.

29
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:48,576
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CONFLICTED.

30
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:50,011
THERE'S SO MUCH DEBATE.

31
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,946
WHAT IS SHOCKING IT IS NOT JUST

32
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:52,647
THE RATIONING CASE.

33
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,382
IT IS NOT JUST THE CASE WHERE

34
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:55,883
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE,

35
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:58,753
WHICH IS NOT SURPRISINGLY VERY,

36
00:00:58,753 --> 00:00:59,820
VERY UNPOPULAR IN GREAT BRITAIN

37
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,255
COMING OUT OF THE RECESSION WITH

38
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:02,990
ALL KINDS OF RATIONING GOING ON.

39
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,325
THAT THEY WOULD DECIDE TO SAVE

40
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,325
MONEY BY CUTTING BACK.

41
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,328
AND SAYING WHAT ABOUT THE

42
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,229
QUALITY OF LIFE.

43
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,064
THE CHILD HAD SO MANY INFECTIONS

44
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:13,200
AND SEIZURES IS BRAIN DAMAGE.

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,235
WE'LL PULL BACK.

46
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:15,636
THAT'S THE RATIONING PART.

47
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:16,837
THE PARENTS ARE SAYING WE WANT

48
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:18,572
TO TAKE THE CHILD OUT OF THE

49
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:18,940
HOSPITAL.

50
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,107
KEEP HIM ON LIFE-SUPPORT AND

51
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:21,309
TAKE HIM TO ANOTHER COUNTRY,

52
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:22,944
WHICH IS READY TO ACCEPT HIM.

53
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,279
THEN IT BECOMES A MORALE ISSUE.

54
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:27,281
WHERE LITERALLY THE GOVERNMENT

55
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:29,650
IS SUPERIMPOSING THEIR JUDGEMENT

56
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,252
ON THE PARENTS, ON THE CHILD,

57
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:35,389
AND USING A 1989 CHILD ABUSE ACT

58
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:37,925
THAT WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT

59
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:41,462
PARENTS FROM-- ABUSING CHILDREN.

60
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:42,997
WHICH CLEARLY NOT THE CASE HERE.

61
00:01:42,997 --> 00:01:44,532
I THINK THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF

62
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:46,167
THIS ARE FOULED UP AND CLEARLY

63
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,768
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS.

64
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:49,804
IN MY ENTIRE CAREER, I HAVE

65
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,205
NEVER HAD THE GOVERNMENT

66
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:52,707
ORDERING ME TO STOP TAKING CARE

67
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,642
OF A PATIENT, NOT ONCE.

68
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:55,209
>> YEAH, THERE'S SOME

69
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:57,845
INTERESTING CASES IN THE PAST.

70
00:01:57,845 --> 00:01:59,747
>> ISIAH KING WAS A LITTLE BOY,

71
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:01,315
YEARS AGO IN THE U.K.

72
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:02,950
THE TREATING HIM FOR SOME BRAIN

73
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,250
CANCER

74
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,885
AND HE WASN'T GETTING THE CARE

75
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:06,387
HIS PARENTS THOUGHT HE SHOULD

76
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:06,654
GET.

77
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:08,089
THEY TOOK HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY

78
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:08,723
WITHOUT PERMISSION

79
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,524
THEY WERE EVENTUALLY ARRESTED IN

80
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:10,824
SPAIN.

81
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:12,560
THEY HAD TAKEN HIM TO PRAGUE FOR

82
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,860
CARE.

83
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,562
THEY NOW CELEBRATED THREE YEARS

84
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:15,863
CANCER FREE FOR HIM.

85
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:17,198
SO THERE WAS ANOTHER TREATMENT

86
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:17,932
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

87
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:19,333
ANOTHER COUNTRY AND PLACE

88
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:19,867
WILLING IN

89
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,068
THEIR CASE IT WORKED.

90
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:22,136
THESE ARE U.K. PARENTS.

91
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:24,105
IN TEXAS WHAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

92
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,639
IS HOSPITAL ADMINISTERS THERE

93
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,074
ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO TO

94
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:29,377
THE COURT, AND PETITION, WHEN IT

95
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:30,811
IS TIME THEY BELIEVE TO TAKE OFF

96
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,279
LIFE SUPPORT.

97
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,848
A FATHER YEARS AGO GOT IN

98
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,149
TROUBLE, BECAUSE HIS SON WAS

99
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:36,550
THERE, AFTER SUFFERING A STROKE.

100
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,985
THE DOCTORS WANTED TO TAKE HIM

101
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:39,220
OFF LIFE SUPPORT.

102
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,521
THIS GUY TOOK A GUN TO THE

103
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,123
HOSPITAL AND SAID HE WOULD BUY

104
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,557
WHATEVER TIME HE COULD WITH HIS

105
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:43,991
SON THERE.

106
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:45,192
WAS A STANDOFF.

107
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:46,594
EVENTUALLY HE SERVED TIME IN

108
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:48,629
JAIL, BUT HIS SON HAS FULLY

109
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:48,996
RECOVERED.

110
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,799
IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT DOCTORS

111
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,300
DON'T ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S

112
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,069
GOING TO HAPPEN IN EVERY CASE?

113
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,037
>> YES, SHANNON.

114
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:57,738
BY THE WAY IN ADDITION TO TEXAS

115
00:02:57,738 --> 00:02:59,707
WITH THOSE LAWS IN EXISTENCE IN

116
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:00,608
TENNESSEE AND CONNECTICUT IN THE

117
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:01,208
UNITED STATES.

118
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,343
IT IS A FAIR POINT.

119
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:04,345
IT IS NOT JUST THE U.K., BUT TO

120
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:05,846
YOUR OTHER POINT, OF COURSE WE

121
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:06,881
DON'T ALWAYS KNOW.

122
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:10,418
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME

123
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:13,621
ABOUT ALIFY EVANS.

124
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:15,256
WE DON'T HAVE A DIAGNOSIS.

125
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:16,190
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE PATIENT.

126
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,491
THE DOCTORS CAN'T TELL US WHAT

127
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:20,327
HE'S SUFFERING FROM.

128
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,862
OF COURSING WE WANT ANOTHER SET

129
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:23,964
OF EYES AND ANOTHER PHYSICIANS

130
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,199
INVOLVED AND OTHER HOSPITALS

131
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,566
INVOLVED.

132
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:28,302
HOW CAN YOU TURN DOWN ANOTHER

133
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:30,037
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS CHILD?

134
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,372
WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE CHILD

135
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:32,373
SUFFERING FROM.

136
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:35,276
WITH CHARLIE GUARD AT LEAST IT

137
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:40,214
IS A GOINGS DIAGNOSIS AND THE

138
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:40,948
EXPERT SAID I DON'T THINK AWAY

139
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:41,515
CAN HELP THIS CHILD.

140
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,084
IN THIS CASE WE DON'T HAVE AN

141
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:43,617
ANSWER.

142
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,819
I DON'T WITHDRAW CARE.

143
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,954
MY ROLE AS PHYSICIAN IS TO

144
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:48,456
PROLONG LIFE AND DECREASE

145
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:48,823
SUFFERING.

146
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:50,591
WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE THIS BABY

147
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:51,392
IS SUFFERING.

148
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:52,426
WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE

149
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:53,961
GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO SHORTEN

150
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:54,995
THE CHILD'S LIFE.

151
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:57,198
I THINK IT IS A SPIRITUAL

152
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:58,866
LACKING IN THIS SITUATION.

153
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,201
>> WELL, YOU'VE ALWAYS GIVEN ME

154
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:01,235
GOOD MEDICAL ADVICE.

155
00:04:01,235 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR THAT I AM THANKFUL.
