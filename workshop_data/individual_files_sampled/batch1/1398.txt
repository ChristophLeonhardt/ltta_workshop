Human Rights Watch has called for States and citizens to resist the challenges of what it calls populist demagogues in its annual report the group described US President Donald Trump's policies as racially divisive but it welcomed the part played by the popular movements and legal challenges in countries including the u.s. Hungary and Poland and resisting government threats to human rights the report warns that some countries have stepped back from championing human rights the UK because of its preoccupation with brexit for example and some European countries influenced by xenophobic parties it says that's left a vacuum allowing mass atrocities to go unchecked in countries including Syria Yemen Myanmar and South Sudan but it says a number of other countries have stepped in highlighting the role of Canada Belgium Ireland and Luxembourg and holding Saudi Arabia for example to account over its conduct in the war in Yemen we can now speak to Kenneth Roth he's the executive director of Human Rights Watch itself joining us live from Paris thanks for speaking to us you just launched this report a few hours ago and what you said is the past year shows that rights can be protected from the popular surge the challenge now is to strengthen that defence how do you strengthen the defence well I mean I think as you pointed out a year ago it seemed like the populace were unstoppable you know Donald Trump had just entered the White House and it seemed like there was this growing number of political leaders who were finding advantage in demonizing minorities and attacking human rights principles and in undermining democratic institutions and frankly the big news of the last year is the outpouring of resistance that we have seen so you know we've chosen to release the report in Paris because Emmanuel macron epitomizes that resistance in the way that he led his electoral campaign by not trying to mimic the far-right but by openly confronting it and embracing democratic principles we've seen this in the United States where there's been an outpouring of a popular rebellion really against Trump's excesses and in some cases it's been possible to to mitigate them so you know we don't have a Muslim travel ban Trump was not able to destroy Obamacare Trump was not able to prevent transgender people from serving in the US military and we've seen similar resistance against Prime Minister or bonds so-called a liberal democracy and hungry against Poland's efforts to undermine the independence day sherry they're against Nicolas maduro's efforts to undermine democracy in Venezuela so it is possible to fight back on the other hand you know in places where there was no resistance either because the domestic resistance was suppressed or because the international community didn't care enough the populist have really flourished and we've seen that through you know air diwan's decimation of turkeys democracy we've seen it in president CeCe's destruction and crushing of civil society in Egypt we've seen it frankly in the way the saudi-led coalition has committed mass war crimes in Yemen creating the largest humanitarian crisis in the world so you see so you've singled out for example Trump's rhetoric you've singled out authoritarianism in countries like Turkey and in Egypt what is the biggest danger today to human rights according to Human Rights Watch well I mean obviously the populace themselves represent a danger because they feel that they can convince people that the rights of minorities don't matter you know even though once you let government speak and shoes rights all of our rights are insecure because it may be the vulnerable minority today whose rights are attacked but tomorrow is going to be the majority the other real danger is that you know in this void of leadership we've seen some governments just you know feel they have a green light to commit atrocities you know that's in a sense what happened with the Burmese government's ethnic cleansing of 650,000 row Hindu Muslims that's in a sense what the Saudi Crown Prince has been able to do in Yemen where seven million people face starvation and a million and have suffered cholera that's what we've seen you know in Syria where we're putting and Assad continue to attack civilians and and are besieging at this very moment three hundred ninety thousand people in eastern Goethe just ten kilometers away from Damascus where they're desperate for food and medical care so it's important to close this leadership void and for governments to to you know to grab the baton when they can and to step in and stop it we've seen that it doesn't always take the super power even in the absence of Donald Trump even in the absence of the UK government's as small as the Netherlands or Liechtenstein or Iceland have taken important initiatives that have made a difference in places like Syria or or the Philippines or Yemen and and just briefly and finally can you tell us how you would describe the state of human rights today I mean this is obviously a dangerous moment because there is a real lack of leadership on human rights but I think we've seen over the last year that you know when people do stand up and defend human rights and democratic principles it's possible to curtail the advance of the populist so in this dangerous moment it's important not to despair but to engage because that kind of engagement can play an important role in defending the human rights principles that ultimately all of us need to flourish in our societies all right Kenneth Roth we thank you for speaking to us from Paris
