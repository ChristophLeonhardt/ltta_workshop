so if you know anybody that need any help they may act like nosy neighbors we need to talk to these kids about the bullying Gladys Brooks and her team are part of a concerted effort to reduce shootings in one of New York's toughest neighborhoods farmers on what 65th Street the team of so-called violence interrupters consists of local residents many have had their own run-ins with guns in the police like Eric farmer whose brother was shot and killed by a police officer or James Rivera who oversees the team and was once an active gang member the reason we get it from reason is because we're from the same community the people know us they know that they're sharing information to people that are just the disorders that we want to make this safer there's not about incarcerated anybody or about so no punitive stuff it's about making the community safer interrupters monitors social media and check in with anyone they think might be contemplating pulling the trigger the team canvasses the neighborhood three to four hours a shift just talking to people last week a shooting took place here and the suspect hasn't been caught so they're focused on the victim and his friends and making sure that they don't retaliate Gladys who began this work in an effort to keep her own son from becoming a victim says it's getting people to think about the consequences of their actions they trust that we're not going to tell the police that this one did that this one did that because that's not our goal the goal is told people wolf that ledge and a recent study shows they are making a difference not only in terms of fewer shootings but also in improving community relations with police New York's police commissioner has given the city funded program credit for helping reduce the crime rate to its lowest in 70 years we're proving that when the public and police work side-by-side we could make positive lasting change in our society shootings are down citywide but even more so in neighborhoods canvassed by violence interrupters resulting in safer streets and a program that is being replicated nationwide Kristen salumi al Jazeera South Bronx
