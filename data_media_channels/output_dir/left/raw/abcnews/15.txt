DAY FOR THESE PEOPLE, DAN AND 

57
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:33,226
PAULA.

58
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,460
WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS 

59
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,662
TRYING TO REGROUP.

60
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,663
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE SOME 

61
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,463
TRAFFIC BEHIND ME.

62
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,698
THEY'RE SENDING MORE OXYGEN 

63
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,900
TANKS BACK INTO THAT CAVE AREA.

64
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,604
THEY'VE GOT TO REPLENISH THE 

65
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:44,871
SUPPLIES.

66
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,139
THEY'RE ALSO PUMPING ADDITIONAL 

67
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,139
OXYGEN IN THERE.

68
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:48,174
THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT THE 

69
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,376
OXYGEN LEVELS HAVE DIPPED.

70
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,944
WE DON'T EXPECT THEM TO BEGIN 

71
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,079
EXTRACTING ADDITIONAL BOYS, 

72
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,014
THOSE EIGHT BOYS LEFT PLUS THE 

73
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:55,815
COACH PROBABLY FOR ANOTHER SIX 

74
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,283
OR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS.

75
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,350
NOT UNTIL MORNING.

76
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,120
THEY'RE GOING TO REGROUP AND TRY

77
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,888
TO GO AT THIS AGAIN.

78
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,656
THE WAY THEY DID IT AS YOU 

79
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,191
DESCRIBED IS COMPLEX.

80
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:11,264
IT'S THIS CHORE GRAEFD DANCE.

81
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,565
EACH ONE OF THE BOYS HAD TWO 

82
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:12,965
DIVERS WITH THEM.

83
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,734
THEY WERE CONVEYED ALONG THIS 

84
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,770
SERPENTINE ROUTE YOUND GROUND, 

85
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,173
SOME OF IT UNDERWATER FOR MILES.

86
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,141
THEY STAUD AT CERTAIN CHAMBERS 

87
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,010
WHERE THERE WAS MUCH MORE AIR TO

88
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,878
REGROUP AND ASETS BOY'S HEALTH 

89
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:26,278
AND THEY MOVED ON.

90
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:29,282
THE FIRST ONE CAME OUT AT ABOUT 

91
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,349
5:40 P.M. LOCAL TIME, THE NEXT 

92
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,018
ONE ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER.

93
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,987
THEN AN HOUR AND A HALF OR SO 

94
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,454
LATER THE OTHER BOYS CAME OUT 

95
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:38,123
SEPARATED BY ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

96
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:39,659
I CAN TELL YOU AT THIS 

97
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,127
INTERSECTION WHERE WE'VE SEEN SO

98
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,998
MUCH ACTIVITY, THERE'S A LINE OF

99
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,565
SOLDIERS HERE WHO SALUTED THE 

100
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:47,633
RESCUE WORKERS HAD THEY CAME 

101
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:47,800
OUT.

102
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,268
IT WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT.

103
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:55,741
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY TORT,  

104
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,576
YOU'RE RUSS AND DIFFERENT THING 

105
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:57,777
TO DO.

106
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,878
NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL 

107
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,714
HOURS ON END, BUT THE CEILING 

108
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,583
HAS JAGGED COURSE ROCK, THEY 

109
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,817
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE WATER AND 

110
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,419
THE POSSIBLE FEAR OF THESE BOYS 

111
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,753
PANICKING WHILE THEY HAVE THESE 

112
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:09,088
FULL FACE MASKS ON THEIR FACE.

113
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,357
BUT IT SEEMS THAT EVERYBODY DID 

114
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,225
SPLENDIDLY WELL AND OBVIOUSLY 

115
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,027
THOSE BOYS ARE NOW RECOVERING AT

116
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,062
A HOSPITAL LIKELY SUFFERING FROM

117
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,730
SOME SORT OF EXHAUSTION OR 

118
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,068
SOMETHING, BUT CLEARLY A VERY 

119
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,403
DIFFICULT ORDEAL FOR THEM. 

120
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,238
>> SO FAR IT HAS BEEN A BEST 

121
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:29,308
CASE SCENARIO BUT THEY NOR THE 

122
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:29,976
OUT OF THE WOODS YET HAD THE GO 

123
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,477
OVER TO JAMES LONGMAN WHO'S ALSO

124
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,645
ON THE GROUND.

125
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,879
JAMES, THIS CONTINUES TO BE A 

126
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,814
RACE AGAINST TIME.

127
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,351
WE KNOW THEY'VE TAKE INA LITTLE 

128
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:38,718
BIT OF TIME OFF.

129
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,385
EIGHT BOYS REMAYBE IN THE CAVE 

130
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,053
AS WELL AS THEIR COACH AND IT 

131
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,456
LOOKS LIKE THE RAINS ARE COMING.

132
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,423
>> Reporter: YEAH, THAT'S BEEN 

133
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,793
THE WHOLE ISSUE FROM THE VERY 

134
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,193
BEGINNING, PAULA.

135
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:47,960
TO BEAT THE RAIN.

136
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,063
AND THE WHOLE ISSUE IS THE WATER

137
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,464
LEVEL IN THAT CAVE.

138
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,065
FROM THE VERY START AT LEAST 

139
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,667
WHEN WE KNEW THAT THESE BOYS 

140
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,602
WERE IN THE CAVE, BECAUSE 

141
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:57,703
REMEMBER TO BEGIN WITH FOR THE 

142
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,205
FIRST FEW DAYS OF THIS THEY WERE

143
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,175
LOST AND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF 

144
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:02,375
THEM.

145
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,276
BUT THE RESCUERS DISCOVERED THEY

146
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:06,713
WERE THERE, THERE WAS REAL 

147
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:11,751
JUBILATION IN THE CAMP WHICH 

148
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,088
EVERYONE WAS BASED AND THEN THE 

149
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,089
REELEDZA

150
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,755
REALIZATION THAT THEY HAD TO BE 

151
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:17,055
GOTTEN OUT.

152
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,524
AND THEN THEY TRIED TO BRING 

153
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,026
DOWN THE WATER FOR THE PAST FEW 

154
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,360
DAYS AND EVEN THOUGH THE CAMP 

155
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,962
WAS DRY IT SEEMED THEY WERE NOT 

156
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,063
ABLE TO BRING IT DOWN AS MUCH AS

157
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,097
THEY WOULD LIKE.

158
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,099
WAS BROUGHT DOWN BY ONE OR TWO 

159
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:27,967
CENTIMETERS A DAY.

160
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,435
THEY HAD SOMETHING LIKE 60 

161
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,536
PUMPS, THEY HAD ONE PUMP THAT 

162
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,705
HAD SOMETHING LIKE 400 

163
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,075
HORSEPOWER WORKING AROUND THE 

164
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:36,275
CLOCK.

165
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,577
THEY PUT DALMS IN TO TRY TO GET 

166
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:40,713
THE WATER DIVERTED FROM THE 

167
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,047
CAVE.

168
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,948
IT SEEMS THAT WATER WAS BROUGHT 

169
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,149
OUT FROM SOME OF THE MORE 

170
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,418
DIFFICULT PORTIONS OF THE CAVE 

171
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,719
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY GOT 

172
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,754
RID OF SOME OF THE ROCK WHICH 

173
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,088
WAS PREVENTING THE BOYS FROM 

174
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,856
BEING ABLE TO COME OUT WITHOUT 

175
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:52,525
HAVING TO DIP THEIR HEAD INTO 

176
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,426
THE WATER.

177
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,727
THE RESCUERS SAID THEY DID NOT 

178
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,195
WANT THEM TO HAVE TO FULLY 

179
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,131
SUBMERGE THEMSELVES FOR EXTENDED

180
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,566
PERIODS OF TIME, THEY WANTED TO 

181
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,001
BRING THEM ALONG THE TOP THE 

182
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:02,201
WATER.

183
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,003
THEY USED THESE UNDERWATER JACK 

184
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:04,937
HAMMERS TO BREAK DOWN THE ROCK.

185
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,073
NOW THE RAIN HAS RETURNED AND 

186
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,574
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THAT'S GOING 

187
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,043
TO DO TO THE SITUATION INSIDE 

188
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:11,644
THE CAVE.

189
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,179
IF THEY'VE BUILT ENOUGH DAMS TO 

190
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,981
MAKE SURE THIS RAIN WON'T MAKE A

191
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,314
DIFFERENCE.

192
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,982
BUT THESE CAVES SIT UNDER AN 

193
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,651
ENORMOUS MOUNTAIN RANGE.

194
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,152
IT IS BASICALLY A NATURAL 

195
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,088
DRAINAGE SYSTEM FOR A JUNGLE AND

196
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,256
ALL THAT WATER IS SEEPING DOWN 

197
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,225
INTO WHAT IS A LIMESTONE CAVE 

198
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,460
AND WATER COMES IN FROM ALL OVER

199
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,562
THE PLACE, IT SEEPS INSIDE.

200
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,830
TONIGHT I THINK THERE WILL BE 

201
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,097
PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN 

202
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:33,933
THAT THIS RAIN COULD MAKE A 

203
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,568
DIFFERENCE.

204
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,235
HOPEFULLY IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH

205
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,838
TO REALLY DELAY THE RESCUE 

206
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,405
OPERATION.

207
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,640
BUT RESCUERS HAVE BEEN SAYING 

208
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,741
AND AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING 

209
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,308
THEY'RE FULLY COMMITTED TO 

210
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,375
GETTING THE REST OF THESE BOYS 

211
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:43,943
OUT.

212
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,411
THIS, IF ANYTHING, IS JUST GOING

213
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,279
TO PUSH THEM DO IT MORE QUICK. 

214
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,447
>> I IT'S A GREAT DAY BUT 

215
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:49,782
UNDERLYING YOUR POINT, THERE'S 

216
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,350
STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE, 

217
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,251
REASON FOR SKERN.

218
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,386
NINE FAMILIES WORRIED ABOUT 

219
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,021
THEIR CHILDREN AND ALSO THE 

220
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,522
FAMILY, OF COURSE, OF THE COACH,

221
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,891
THE 25-YEAR-OLD COACH WHO LED 

222
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,394
THEM INTO THAT CAVE AND HAS 

223
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:03,362
SUBSEQUENTLY APOLOGIZED FOR IF 

224
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,064
THE BUT ONE REASON FOR HOPE IS 

225
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,232
THEY BEGAN THEY TOLD US WITH THE

226
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,332
FOUR WEAKEST BOYS.

227
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:08,634
THEY WANTED TO GET THEM OUT 

228
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:08,834
FIRST.

229
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,503
THE FACT THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE 

230
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,904
THE WEAKEST BOYS AND MOVE AHEAD 

231
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,839
OF SCHEDULE, THAT HAS TO BE A 

232
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,640
SOURCE OF OPTIMISM.

233
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,308
AND I WONDER IF WE CAN GET YOU 

234
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:17,810
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT, JAMES, 

235
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,978
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SCENE 

236
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,212
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS 

237
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:23,382
STORY ABOUT HOW THE MOOD HAS 

238
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,817
SHIFTED OVER THESE -- IN VARIOUS

239
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,720
WAYS OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. 

240
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,122
>> DAN, IT'S BEEN A REAL RIDE.

241
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,590
YOU KNOW, WE ARRIVED HERE VERY 

242
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:37,996
EARLY ON TO A STORY TWLO WHERE 

243
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:38,831
MOST OF THE INTERNATIONAL TYPES 

244
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,232
LIKE US COULD THEY FIND THESE 

245
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:41,801
BOYS IN THIS ENORMOUS CAVE?

246
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,769
WE'RE TOLD HOW BIG IT IS HERE IN

247
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,905
NORTHERN THAILAND INTO MYANMAR, 

248
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,272
ANOTHER COUNTRY.

249
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,740
THIS CAVE SYSTEM IS ENORMOUS.

250
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,841
THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD EVEN 

251
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,209
FIND THEM AT THE VERY BEGINNING 

252
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,911
WAS KIND OF LUDICROUS.

253
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,013
BUT LOW AND BEHOLD, THEY DID AND

254
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,014
THEY EVEN FOUND THEM FURTHER 

255
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,850
INSIDE THE CAVE THAN THEY HAD 

256
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,350
ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED.

257
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,521
SO THAT WAS GREAT EUPHORIA.

258
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,855
BUT THEN DID DAWN ON EVERYONE IN

259
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,023
THE CAMP HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS 

260
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,658
GOING TO BE 0 TO GET THEM OUT.

261
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,359
THERE WAS A REALLY STRONG 

262
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:07,593
CURRENT.

263
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,062
WE AWE IMAGES OF RESCUE DIVERS 

264
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:10,996
PULLING THEMSELVES HAND OVER 

265
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,065
FIST ALONG ROPES TO TRY TO GET 

266
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,400
THEMSELVES UP THAT CAVE, FIVE, 

267
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,769
SIX HOURS OF DIVING FOR VERY 

268
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,004
FIT, STRONG NAVY SEALS.

269
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,305
AND THEN OF COURSE A FEW DAYS 

270
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,706
AGO THE SAD DEATH OF ONE OF 

271
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,342
THOSE FORMER THAI NAVY SEAL 

272
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,344
RESCUE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD SPENT 

273
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,779
HIS TIME DELIVERING OXYGEN TANKS

274
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,547
AND AIR TANKS INTO THAT CAVE TO 

275
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,882
ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET FURTHER 

276
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,717
DOWN, HE ENDED UP DYING OF A 

277
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,885
LACK OF AX AGAIN.

278
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,687
SO I THINK AT THAT POINT, THAT 

279
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,655
WAS PROBABLY THE LOWEST IT'S 

280
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,357
BEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS

281
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:38,991
WHOLE SITUATION.

282
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,959
IT'S A REMINDER REALLY OF HOW 

283
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,495
DIFFICULT THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS

284
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,931
BEEN, HIS DEATH, AND, YES, AS 

285
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,365
YOU SAY, A REAL RIDE.

286
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,733
BUT HOPEFULLY WE'RE SEEING THE 

287
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,036
END OF IT.

288
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,303
BUT, AGAIN, THIS RAIN, I THINK 

289
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,205
THIS IS REALLY A WORRY NOW. 

290
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,306
>> JUST THE RANGE OF EMOTIONS 

291
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,508
THAT SO MANY HAVE ENDURED AND 

292
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,410
THEY HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK, 

293
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,610
JAMES, TO PUMP MORE OXYGEN INTO 

294
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,412
THE CAVES AND THEN THEY WILL 

295
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:01,814
RESUME AND TRY EXTRACT THE 

296
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,215
REMAIN BEING EIGHT BOYS AND THE 

297
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:03,849
SOCCER COACH.

298
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,051
BUT I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT 

299
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,685
THOSE FAMILIES, JAMES, THANK 

300
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:07,186
YOU.

301
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,087
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THOSE 

302
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,455
FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT

303
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:09,722
NOW.

304
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,758
WE WANT TO JOIN ADRIAN BANK ARD 

305
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,793
WHO'S JUST OUTSIDE ONE OF THE 

306
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,094
LOCAL HOSPITALS.

307
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,261
FOUR BOYS ARE AT THE HOSPITAL.

308
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,097
ADRIENNE, WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT

309
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,332
WILL THEY UNDERGO ONCE THEY'RE 

310
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:20,799
AT THE HOSPITAL?

311
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,034
>> Reporter: WELL, THE FOUR BOYS

312
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,969
WHO ARE HERE ON SCENE, WE KNOW 

313
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,170
THEY'RE ON THAT EIGHTH FLOOR 

314
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,605
THAT WE WERE TOLD BY OFFICIALS 

315
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,040
HAS BEEN RESERVED FOR ALL 13 WHO

316
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,709
ARE COMING OUT OF THAT CAVE.

317
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,543
THEY WILL BE REUNITED WITH 

318
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:31,844
FAMILY.

319
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,047
ONES HERE WE SUSPECT ALREADY AND

320
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,982
THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND 

321
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,384
ANTES AND UNCLE'S ARMS.

322
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,052
WE DO KNOW THEY'LL BE UNDERGOING

323
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,320
COMPLETE MEDICAL EVALUATIONS 

324
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,587
BESIDES WHAT WAS DONE ALREADY 

325
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,155
FOR THEM IN THE STAGING AREA 

326
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,057
INSIDE THAT CAVE.

327
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,358
I MEAN, ALL ALONG THE WAY 

328
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,426
THEY'VE HAD DOCTORS AND NURSES 

329
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,229
AND PARAMEDICS ALONG SIDE OF 

330
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:50,429
THEM.

331
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,730
WE SAW FROM WHAT OFFICIALS HAVE 

332
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,333
TOLD US THAT THEY HAD A FIELD 

333
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,036
HOSPITAL THERE AT THE CAVE SITE.

334
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,237
JAMES AND MATT HAVE BEEN REPORT 

335
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:58,471
THOONG.

336
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,138
AND THEN THEY WERE TRANSPORTED 

337
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:01,307
TO AN AMBULANCE WHICH TOOK THEM 

338
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,274
TO THE HELICOPTER WHICH TOOK 

339
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:03,675
THEM TO ANOTHER AMBULANCE WHICH 

340
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:05,378
BROUGHT THEM RIGHT HERE TO THIS 

341
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,412
HOSPITAL'S DOORSTEP.

342
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,680
NOW WE DO KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE 

343
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,415
CHECKED FOR INFECTIONS.

344
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:14,820
THERE IS A CAVE DISEASE, AS IT'S

345
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,521
CALLED REASON, AN AIRBORNE LUNG 

346
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,589
INFECTION THAT'S OF CONCERN JUST

347
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,223
FROM THEM BEING INSIDE THE CAVE 

348
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,658
AND THOSE CONDITIONS THERE, THE 

349
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,293
DAMPNESS OF THE CAVE, BEING 

350
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:23,495
AROUND WATER SO LONG AND BEING 

351
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:24,563
IN THE WATER.

352
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,767
THEY MAY NEED TO BE TREATED FOR 

353
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,434
ANY TYPE OF BACTERIAL INFECTION 

354
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,938
AS A RESULT OF THAT.

355
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,806
AND BEING IN THE DARK THAT LONG,

356
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:34,873
BEING AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES 

357
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:37,076
AND FRIENDS, BEING AWAY FROM A 

358
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,045
NORMAL ROUTINE OR EXERCISE, I 

359
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,579
MEAN, THESE ARE YOUNG SOCCER 

360
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,748
PLAYERS AGES 11 TO 16.

361
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,949
IMAGINE THE ENERGY THAT YOUR SON

362
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,185
OR ANY OF FEW OR COUSIN HAS AND 

363
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,753
THAT THEY'RE TRAPPED INSIDE THIS

364
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,355
VERY ENCLOSED SPACE FOR TWO 

365
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:50,923
WEEKS SEPARATE.

366
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,591
IT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED THAT 

367
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,493
THIS COACH REALLY HAS BEEN 

368
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,196
ADDING TO THE COMRADERY AND THE 

369
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,063

00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,740
POSSIBLE WHERE THEY'LL HAVE 

377
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,809
NIGHTMARES OR BE CONCERNED ABOUT

378
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,343
BEING IN CLOSED SPACES OR 

379
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:12,444
FEARFUL OF THE DARK.

380
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:13,479
BUT, AGAIN, THEY'LL BE ALL 

381
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,380
TREATED HERE ON THAT EIGHTH 

382
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,815

>> ABSOLUTELY.

387
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,687
BUT WE CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH, 

388
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,522
THERE ARE EIGHT MORE CHILDREN IN

WE APPRECIATE IT.

393
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:32,398
THIS IMAGE REALLY UNDERSCORES 

394
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,767
THE.IENCY AND THE TEAM NATURE OF

395
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,868

PHYSICALLY ESCORTED OR 13 

416
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:19,744
FOREIGNERS WHO PHYSICALLY 

417
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:21,914
ESCORTED THOSE BOYS OUT OF THE 

418
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,548

421
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,720
SBOI MANY OTHERS.

422
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,820
THERE WERE 90 TOTAL DIVERS 

423
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,055
INVOLVED IN TODAY'S RESCUE 

424
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:30,422
ALONE.

425
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:31,557
50 OF THEM FOREIGNERS.

426
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,390
THAT'S A LARGE NUMBER.

427
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,926
BUT ALSO WE'VE HAD PEOPLE FROM 

428
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,828
ALL OVER THE WORLD JUST 

429
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,096
PHYSICALLY HAUL GAS TANKS, AIR 

430
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,531
TANKS ALL THE WAY INTO THE CAVE.

431
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,933
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LAID 

432
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:41,400
ROPE ACROSS.

433
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,402
THERE ARE COMMUNICATIONS SET UP 

434
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,470
FROM PLACES LIKE ISRAEL.

435
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,339
THERE ARE DIVERS FROM FINLAND 

436
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,707
AND BELGIUM AND HOLLAND AND 

437
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,642
ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES.

438
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,544
SO IT IS REALLY TRULY BEEN AN 

439
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:53,011
INTERNATIONAL EFFORT.

440
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,847
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE 

441
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,248
TO COMMEND THE THAI AUTHORITIES 

442
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,016
FOR, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ASHAMED 

443
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:58,684
ABOUT ASKING FOR HELP.

444
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,187
THEY HAVE TAKEN EVERYBODY IN, 

445
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,924
THEY VIN HAVE INVITED US IN.

446
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,259
THE ATMOSPHERE HERE HAS JUST 

447
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,663
BEEN INCREDIBLE, SO 

448
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,330
PARTICIPATORY AND ACCEPTING THAT

449
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,030
THEY HAVE REALLY -- OBVIOUSLY 

450
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,532
IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 

451
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,367
WORK FOR THEM BUT THEY HAVE FELT

452
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,602
LIKE THEY ARE PART OF THIS THAI 

453
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,502
FAMILY AND JUST TO BE ABLE TO 

454
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,171
CAP IT OFF AT LEAST WITH THOSE 

455
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,706
FIRST FOUR RESCUES HAS BEEN 

456
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,808
TREMENDOUS FOR SO MANY OF THOSE 

457
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:23,175
INVOLVED HERE. 

458
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:23,842
>> THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 

459
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:25,344
IS CERTAINLY REJOICING.

460
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,746
THIS HAS BEEN AN INSPIRING AND 

461
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,647
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT.

462
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,416
BUT, MATT, IT'S DARKY YOU ARE.

463
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,318
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT IN THAILAND

464
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:34,720
AND THAI OFFICIALS SAID THAT 

465
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,155
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK, 

466
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,356
ABOUT A TEN TO 20-HOUR BREAK 

467
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:39,458
FROM EXTRACTING THE REMAINING 

468
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,893
BOYS AND THEIR SOCCER COACH.

469
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,127
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO EVERYONE AT 

470
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:46,164
HOME WHY THAT'S NECESSARY?

471
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:47,700
>> Reporter: I THINK BECAUSE 

472
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,268
THEY HAD SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED

473
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,170
IN THIS RESCUE, IT LITERALLY WAS

474
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,071
THE FINAL PUSH.

475
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,272
THEY THREW EVERYTHING AT THIS 

476
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:53,839
THEY HAD.

477
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,407
BUT THEY ALSO EXPENDED A 

478
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,042
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES.

479
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,645
SO AS JAMES MENTIONED, THERE ARE

480
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,146
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PUMPS PUSHING

481
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:02,580
WATER OUT, MILLIONS OF GALLONS 

482
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,016
AT A TIME.

483
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,185
THERE ARE DIVERS WHO ARE SPENT.

484
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,287
THEY'RE TIRED, AND THEY HAVE 

485
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,521
LITERALLY POSTED HUNDREDS OF AIR

486
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,690
TANKS ALONG THE ROUTE FOR THE 

487
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,158
DIVERS AND THEIR TEAMS AROUND 

488
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,559
THEM, MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE PEOPLE 

489
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,362
TO USE AS THEY GO THROUGH.

490
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,464
AND ONE DIVER DESCRIBED IT TO ME

491
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,934
AS LIKE CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST.

492
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,001
IT'S SO PHYSICALLY EXPERTING.

493
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,070
TODAY WE SPENT AN OUR IN A CAVE 

494
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,872
THAT WAS EXEMPLAR TO IT MINUS 

495
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:27,706
THE WATER.

496
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,707
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES I WAS 

497
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,675
HUFFING AND PUFFING.

498
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,043
SO THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AIR AT 

499
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,011
A TREMENDOUS PACE.

500
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,946
THEY'VE GOT TO BUILD BACK THEIR 

501
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,314
STOCKPILE OF THOSE AIR TANKS.

502
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,115
THEY'RE PUMPING IN GAS AS WELL, 

503
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,517
OXYGEN, TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

504
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,186
THE OTHER BOYS AND THEIR COACH 

505
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:42,254
ARE READY FOR THIS JOURNEY AND 

506
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,356
THEY PROBABLY WANT TO DO IT 

507
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,191
WITHOUT THE RAIN AND WITHOUT ALL

508
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,760
THIS MUD AND THE DARKNESS.

509
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,994
SO EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 

510
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,696
SUPPORT ROLES OUTSIDE THE CAVE 

511
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,263
DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH 

512
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:53,632
THESE CONDITIONS AS WELL.

513
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,300
SO THE KEY GOAL RIGHT NOW WAS 

514
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,902
NOT ONLY TO GET THE BOYS OUT, 

515
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,904
BUT TO GET THEM OUT SAFELY.

516
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,240
THERE ARE SO MANY PIT FALLS IN 

517
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,842
THAT CAVE AND I THINK AFTER 

518
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,210
TODAY'S SUCCESS THEY WANT TO 

519
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:05,678
TAKE IT SLOWLY.

520
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,548
BUT FROM THE START THEY TOLD US 

521
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,217
THIS KWO TAKECOULD TAKE THREE T 

522
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:12,417
DAYS.

523
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,552
THEY'RE HOPING IT DOESN'T BUT 

524
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,186
THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE THAT 

525
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,988
TIME IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY 

526
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,188
NEED. 

527
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,791
>> IT'S A HERCULEAN TASK AND THE

528
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,627

00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,561
