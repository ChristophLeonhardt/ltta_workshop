2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,810
today you say that the US economy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,490
steroids what exactly do you mean by

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a look at the look at the US</font>

5
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">economy as an athlete athlete fell broke</font>

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,570
her ribs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but he still had the</font>

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,500
marathon to run so what happens you

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,850
basically pumped in normal amount of

9
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">service into the athlete athlete got up</font>

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,570
and he's riding<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they look at them it</font>

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,910
seems to be doing alright but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know what they don't see is that</font>

13
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,359
this performance is completely driven by

14
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,880
the steroids at work<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,040
case of the economy we have this giant

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,930
ma the enormous amount of stimulus

17
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,910
pumped into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the economy and that's what</font>

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,110
keeps us going you know that's what is

19
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,430
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the economic numbers</font>

20
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,129
that you see you know you know its gdp

21
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,219
growth you know cash for clunkers

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,190
financial injections exactly um so what

23
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,930
is the longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel adjust or</font>

24
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,809
damage of so much stimulus well souls so

25
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:55,059
goodness the<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have Nia we have all the</font>

26
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:56,379
stimulus like using<font color="#E5E5E5"> your cash for</font>

27
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,840
clunkers we have the the mortgage the

28
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,059
mortgage market is completely you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

29
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,859
it's you know they may trade America

30
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,599
responsible for language alone etc and

31
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,210
interest is extremely low<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

32
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,340
problem is at some point no you know

33
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're gonna have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have banks generate</font>

34
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,640
walls some at some point you won't be

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,229
able to keep interest rates at this

36
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:17,770
level so when interest rates rise that's

37
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,450
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a tremendous headwind</font>

38
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,040
cumulative to the economy this kind of

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,020
addicted this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> low it not to this low</font>

40
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,810
interest rates so the bottom line is

41
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,150
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in something in it in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> future</font>

42
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,869
we're going to have a probably a high

43
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:34,180
debt burden high taxes and high interest

44
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,920
rates and means we're going to have a

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,259
lower economic roles and that's not what

46
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,450
is priced into the stock market today so

47
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,030
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the detoxification process gonna</font>

48
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,470
entail that's what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

49
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,200
forward to is this is gonna be painful

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,369
that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i guess you're gonna</font>

51
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,549
have to check into rehab ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the</font>

52
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,560
it's going to be probably painful

53
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,840
because you know economic growth is

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,399
going to be slower if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a lot</font>

55
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,799
of stocks today<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're basically they</font>

56
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">are looking at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recovery as a we had</font>

57
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,759
excelled in one recovery as if it was a

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,310
normal

59
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,990
session recovering from a normal session

60
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,850
and the cyclical stocks are basically

61
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,770
price for perfection another<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an</font>

62
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,530
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anika</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple last earnings</font>

63
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,910
call or maybe they want gone before the

64
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,860
caterpillar they said you know they

65
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,330
expect the revenue to start to grow in

66
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,200
you know you know later 9 2010 because

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,180
they will benefit from 3.7 trillion

68
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,670
dollar global stimulus the question is

69
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,680
what is after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right I'm going to</font>

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">have another three point seven eleven</font>

71
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,790
stimulus so the bottom line is a lot of

72
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,410
this stimulating<font color="#CCCCCC"> as stimulus this future</font>

73
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,900
is basically it's still in future me of

74
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,970
future demand and that's what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

75
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,450
look forward to no lo accrual<font color="#E5E5E5"> no then</font>

76
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,980
many people today so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think the</font>

77
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,530
market has<font color="#E5E5E5"> got away ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of itself you</font>

78
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,239
know I have a wish list of stocks which

79
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,310
can have 300 stocks I look at and<font color="#CCCCCC"> push</font>

80
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,660
that have a bike hold and cell-based

81
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,330
innovation truth only a handful of

82
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,099
stocks are advised right now so the

83
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,599
market in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> market is a very Molly</font>

84
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,610
and a lot of stocks pricing this

85
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,880
incredibly v-shaped recovery this very

86
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,819
likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen now you're saying that</font>

87
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,260
the market is pretty much range bound

88
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,090
for some time obviously investors Brian

89
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supports selling at resistance that's</font>

90
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:10,640
where they're going to make their money

91
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,820
what what stocks and what sectors are

92
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,739
you interested in let me clarify one

93
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,420
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the arrangement market you</font>

94
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,620
know that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of realize what you just</font>

95
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,530
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> right well when this week after I</font>

96
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,609
wrote the book I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

97
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,230
actually use the word sideways because

98
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,609
then people don't assume that i know

99
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,790
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ranges ok but so the in this</font>

100
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,380
environment it's really buying the

101
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,239
market and holding for a long time will

102
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,500
give you what happened was the case

103
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,569
basically a lot of volatility in your

104
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,130
portfolio will be the same old work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

105
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,440
where you started so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a time to</font>

106
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,019
pick individual stocks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is time</font>

107
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,760
to be buy and sell investor<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually buy</font>

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,049
stocks when they are undervalued

109
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:47,389
individual stocks yet try not trying to

110
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,310
time the market by trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to value</font>

111
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,230
individual stocks buying one day

112
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,670
undervalued we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get to the</font>

113
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,340
fair about level you sell and you look

114
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,410
father stacks to buy so don't be afraid

115
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,840
to hold large cash positions if you

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,290
don't

117
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,760
thanks to buy what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking for</font>

118
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,469
you know what is one of your favorite

119
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:05,060
undervalued stocks you believe right now

120
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,790
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scepter overall distance all</font>

121
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,099
de mostest pharmaceuticals<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this dog</font>

122
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:12,109
like an example price Pfizer is a

123
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:15,680
perfect example today's price he know

124
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is though there was an</font>

125
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,829
investor's hate visor because it hasn't

126
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,988
got anywhere in 10 years stock is down

127
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">from 50 to 20 it has a huge drug at New</font>

128
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">York's drug expressions like a lipitor</font>

129
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">group okay but if you look at Pfizer and</font>

130
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,220
you basically discount and basically

131
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,570
figure out what the cash flows are going

132
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,860
to be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward assuming all the</font>

133
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,300
drugs that expired will expire<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

134
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,099
revenues to welcome you ninety percent

135
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">for those drugs that's what the dr the</font>

136
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,539
stack working out prices in today<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

137
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:44,090
other words this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a stock that price</font>

138
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,530
is an absolutely no growth going forward

139
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,570
and this is the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> spends 11</font>

140
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,340
billion dollars a year on R&D ray and

141
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,590
has a hundred drugs in the pipeline so I

142
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,509
have a bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that at some point</font>

143
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,740
they're going to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> new drugs</font>

144
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,690
okay in the meantime you collect four

145
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,370
percent dividend so it's almost like

146
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">this very little downside the upside is</font>

147
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,690
i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where Adam not they either</font>

148
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,880
going to come out with new drugs and you

149
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,770
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get focus on your dividend to</font>

150
00:05:06,770 --> 00:00:00,000
wait
