00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,860
it would be naive of us to assume there

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,540
isn't much hate going on around the

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,670
internet but with people safe behind

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,859
cyber screen able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type with no</font>

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,930
consequences of what they're actually

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,020
saying there is a lot of haze out there

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,730
and it's something we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal</font>

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,619
with if we wish to broadcast ourselves

9
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,450
whether it's creating a profile

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,370
broadcasting a video or even taking part

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,320
in one of these websites where people

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,600
can ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and make comments</font>

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,710
anonymously we are exposed now with me

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,020
being very honest in my videos I'm an

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,870
open book I throw everything out there I

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,480
make myself vulnerable and it took me

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over a year to get over the</font>

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,469
onslaught of criticism and hate that i

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,600
received online sometimes it came from

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,699
anonymous people and sometimes it came

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,949
from people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are named maybe people I</font>

22
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">even knew but that doesn't matter</font>

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,600
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate is hate so hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,460
telling you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've learnt it will</font>

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,650
give you a shortcut<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help you deal</font>

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,110
with any hate that comes your way in

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,990
future I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off with one my</font>

such<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in life as failure just</font>

30

experiences and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your reactions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,869
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may wonder how this is relevant</font>

32
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:27,930
well if we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of hate how</font>

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,270
that height affects you the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

34
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,509
power that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lawyers within those words is</font>

35
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,579
all an illusion technically they're only

36
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,740
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage you as much as you let</font>

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so you have your experience and you</font>

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,280
have your reaction it's all down to you

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with this even if you</font>

40
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,380
doubt yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I truly have faith that</font>

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,240
everyone has strengths within themselves

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,280
to combat such situations

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,080
just have some faith now there was a

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,630
play that I read in secondary school

45
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,880
high school called the homecoming by

46
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,979
harold pinter the homecoming was very

47
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,080
much dialogue driven and was about a

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,209
family that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> power struggle</font>

49
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">within one of the clearest portrayals of</font>

50
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,560
power struggle was of the granddad who

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,940
would be sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there puffing away on</font>

52
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,239
his cigarette while shouting such vulgar

53
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,520
remarks that his son he<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be sitting</font>

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,470
there reading a newspaper calmly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

55
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,700
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again how else you gonna read a</font>

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
newspaper this caused the granddad to

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,950
get more and more angry<font color="#CCCCCC"> and frustrated</font>

58
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,600
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is where is the power</font>

59
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,340
and of course it was with the Sun

60
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,470
because no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much hate was</font>

61
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,420
thrown his way he would shrug it off and

62
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,330
calmly reply so how does the homecoming

63
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,580
relate to real life events well I have

64
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">another story to tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many months</font>

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago I was in my local town at a</font>

66
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,150
nightclub and at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the night I</font>

67
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">came across so on who I have met several</font>

68
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,860
times and he said he watched a lot of my

69
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">videos but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he hung around in a group of</font>

70
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that I assume didn't like me he</font>

71
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,720
wanted a cigarette and he asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

72
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,260
a lighter no I did have one so I handed

73
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">it over to him and as he lit up he then</font>

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,829
looked to me and said you're a faggot

75
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,579
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> there going to be able to keep a</font>

76
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,320
straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks for saying that and this</font>

77
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,660
leads me to my final main piece of a

78
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,360
device which is surely you should be

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,370
taking comfort from anyone who throws

80
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,970
negative to your way because when you've

81
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,100
gone around doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own thing you've</font>

82
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,590
somehow made a significant impact on

83
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,769
someone's life so significant that they

84
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,810
have felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> the need to let you know that</font>

85
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">they exist</font>

00:03:37,460 --> 00:00:00,000
