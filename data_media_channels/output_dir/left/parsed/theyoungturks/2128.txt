EARLIER THIS WEEK VLADIMIR
PUTIN WAS REELECTED, HE WILL
LEAVE RUSSIA UNTIL 2024, I
BELIEVE, HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE
LEADER FOR QUITE A WHILE AT THIS
POINT BUT HE WON, GOT SOMETHING
LIKE 74% OF THE VOTE WHICH I
THINK WAS A NICE SUBTLE WAY TO
RUN THINGS, I THINK DRIVING IT
TO 90 OR 95% WOULD BE CRAZY.
YOU
CAN'T DO 99, YOU ARE TO SADDAM
HUSSEIN, SO HE KEPT AROUND 74%.
SO IN THE WAKE OF THAT ELECTION
WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAD SIGNIFICANT
CONCERNS IN TERMS OF HOW IT WAS
RUN, THE FACT THAT THE CHIEF
OPPOSITION TO HIM WAS LEGALLY
BARRED FROM RUNNING MADE IT A
LITTLE RIDICULOUS, THE QUESTION
THEN BECAME WHAT VARIOUS WORLD
LEADERS CALL HIM AND
CONGRATULATE HIM, WHICH IS THE
SORT OF THING THAT HAPPENS
TYPICALLY.
AND A NUMBER OF WORLD
LEADERS DID.
WOULD DONALD TRUMP?
HERE IS TO TALK ABOUT IT.
>>I HAD A CALL WITH PRESIDENT
PUTIN AND CONGRATULATED HIM ON
THE VICTORY TO HIS ELECTORAL
VICTORY.
THE CALL HAD TO DO ALSO
WITH THE FACT THAT WE WILL
PROBABLY GET TOGETHER IN THE
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE SO THAT
WE CAN DISCUSS ARMS, WE CAN
DISCUSS THE ARMS RACE.
>>I WANT TO RETURN TO THAT ARMS
RACE THING BECAUSE I WASN'T
AWARE WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF
AN ARMS RACE RIGHT NOW BUT
APPARENTLY WE ARE.
SO HE DID
CALL HIM, WE FOUND OUT THAT HE
WAS TOLD SPECIFICALLY NOT TO,
BUT SOME REPUBLICANS HAD AN
ISSUE WITH HIM CALLING THIS
AUTHORITARIAN LEADER TO
CONGRATULATE HIM FOR WHAT
IS A SHAM ELECTION.
JOHN MCCAIN SAID --
>>AND CHUCK GRASSLEY, HEAD OF
THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, SAID --
>>SARAH B SANDERS WAS ASKED
ABOUT THIS AT A PRESS
CONFERENCE AND SHE SAID --
>>WHICH IS BOTH A BIG CHANGE OF
STANCE FOR AMERICA HISTORICALLY,
BUT EVEN RECENTLY HADN'T
ACTUALLY KNOWN THIS BUT --
>>THAT'S PROBABLY JUSTIFIED --
>>WHICH ARE 
LIKELY ACTS WORTHY
OF PRAISE FROM THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.
BUT THERE ARE
LIMITS ON HOW THEY WILL
INTERFERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>>WE HAVE A COUPLE OF
LATEBREAKING THINGS ON WHAT
HAPPENED, A COUPLE OF THE
SIBERIAN COUNTIES CAME IN AND
IT'S UP TO 77%.
IN ALL
SERIOUSNESS THE FINAL RESULTS, A
PREPOSTEROUS 77%, PARTLY BECAUSE
HE DID NOT ALLOW HIS MAIN
OPPOSITION TO RUN AGAINST HIM,
WHICH IS CONVENIENT BUT NOT
QUITE WHAT YOU DO IN A
DEMOCRACY, I WILL GET BACK TO
THAT IN A SECOND.
AND SENATOR
CLASSY BEN SASSE JUST SPOKE OUT
BEFORE THE SHOW, I KNOW IT'S
"SASS" THAT IT'S MORE FUN THE
OTHER WAY, AND HE WAS REHEARSED,
HE GAVE SIX MINUTES OF REMARKS
ON THE SENATE FLOOR SPEECH AND
HE SAID TRUMP WAS, QUOTE, VERY
FOOLHARDY TO HAVE DONE THIS.
HE
SAID PUTIN IS NOT A FRIEND, HE'S
A DESPERATE, THE PRESIDENT WAS
WRONG TO CONGRATULATE HIM, WE
WERE WEAKENED AS A NATION AND A
TYRANT WAS STRENGTHENED AND THE
CALL WAS ILL ADVISED.
SOME VERY
STRONG WORDS FROM OTHER
REPUBLICANS THAT ARE IN OFFICE.
NOW, WHERE DO WE COME OUT ON
THIS?
FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T
BELIEVE I'M ABOUT TO SAY THIS
AND I KNOW JOHN YOU HAVE A FIRM
STANCE NOT TO BE FAIR TO TRUMP,
BUT TO BE FAIR TO TRUMP, AS YOU
POINTED OUT, OTHER LEADERS ALSO
CALLED PUTIN, GERMANY, JAPAN,
ISRAEL, CALLED TO CONGRATULATE
HIM.
ISRAEL IS MASSIVELY RIGHT
WING BUT JAPAN AND GERMANY,
OKAY, AND BY THE WAY ANOTHER
WORLD LEADER THAT CALLED PUTIN
AFTER HIS LAST ELECTION WAS
BARACK OBAMA, IN 2012.
THIS
ELECTION WAS PARTICULARLY
LOATHSOME BUT I SAID AT THE TIME
THAT THE 2012 ELECTION WAS A
SHAM.
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SHAM.
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE STUFF
AROUND THE EDGES IT DRIVES ME
CRAZY SO IN THIS CASE THERE WAS
BALLOT BOX STUFFING ACCORDING TO
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, POLL
WATCHERS WERE BLOCKED FROM
CARRYING OUT THEIR DUTIES, BUT
TO ME THAT'S JUST THE APPETIZER,
THE MAIN EVENT IS HE WON'T LET
PEOPLE RUN AGAINST HIM.
THE
LEADING OPPOSITION FIGURE,
NAVALNY, SORRY FOR THE TERRIBLE
PRONUNCIATION -- AND HE HAD HIM
ARRESTED ON NONSENSE CHARGES AND
SAID NOW YOU ARE A CRIMINAL AND
I GUESS YOU CAN'T RUN AGAINST
ME, WHAT A LUCKY BREAK I JUST
CAUGHT.
I DON'T WANT TO
ENTERTAIN ANY TALK OF, WELL, DID
ALL OF PUTIN'S TOP POLITICAL
OPPONENTS THROUGHOUT ALL THESE
DECADES, WHERE THEY ALL
CRIMINALS?
THEY ALL HAPPEN TO BE
ARRESTED BEFORE THE ELECTIONS SO
THEY WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM
THE ELECTIONS?
>>THAT'S NOT FAIR, SOME
MYSTERIOUSLY DIE.
>>RIGHT.
DUDE, 77%, THAT'S NOT
A REAL ELECTION.
NONE OF THIS IS
REAL.
IT'S SADDAM HUSSEIN-LIKE.
I'M NOT ENTERTAINING ANY OF
THIS.
I DON'T THINK TRUMP
CALLING IS THAT BIG A DEAL.
>>I DON'T REALLY CARE.
>>SHAM ELECTIONS UNFORTUNATELY
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD -- ANYWAY I
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO OURS --
BUT I WILL IN A SECOND.
BUT WE
HAVE TO DO DIPLOMACY, SO IF HE
CALLS PEOPLE I GET IT.
BUT HE
DIDN'T NEED TO GO OVER THE TOP
AND CONGRATULATE HIM.
LIKE, OH,
I DO DECLARE, MR.
VLADIMIR, VERY
GOOD, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
ELECTION.
YOU CAN JUST CALL AND
BE LIKE OKAY, I GUESS YOU'RE
STILL THE PRESIDENT FOR THE 18TH
TIME IN A ROW, LUCKY BREAK FOR
YOU.
ANYWAY IF WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE A SUMMIT LET'S HAVE ONE AND
GO ON WITH OUR LIVES.
BUT THERE
IS SOMETHING CURIOUS, AND THAT
LEADS FINALLY TO THE SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS LINE, WE DON'T
LIKE TO MEDDLE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S
ELECTIONS.
YOU CAN BREAK THIS
APART IN A COUPLE OF WAYS, ONE,
THEY SEEM TO LIKE TO MEDDLE IN
OURS, AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE
MEDDLED IN THEIR ELECTION, BUT
IT'S OKAY TO SAY NEXT TIME CAN
YOU HAVE A REAL ONE?
THAT GOES
TO THE IMPORTANT POINT, WE TELL
PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, WE JUST DID
IT IN VENEZUELA AND CAMBODIA, WE
ARE THINKING OF ARGUING FOR
SANCTIONS, I THINK IT'S THIS
WEEK THAT MIKE PENCE IS ARGUING
FOR SANCTIONS FOR VENEZUELA
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE THEIR
ELECTIONS.
WHAT HAPPENED TO WE
DON'T MEDDLE IN ELECTIONS?
THAT'S DEMONSTRABLY,
PREPOSTEROUSLY FALSE, LET ALONE
ALL THE COUPS, ETC., THAT WE DID
IN THE PAST, BUT RIGHT NOW WE
TELL PEOPLE THAT'S AN
UNACCEPTABLE ELECTION, WE WILL
DO ECONOMIC SECTIONS ON YOU FOR
THAT.
AND THEN PUTIN PUTS ON A
CLOWN SHOW AND TRUMP IS LIKE A
CIRCUS?
GREAT! AND CALLS TO
CONGRATULATE HIM ON HIS THREE
RING CIRCUS.
>>IN TERMS OF CARING ABOUT HOW
OTHER ELECTIONS WORK, I THINK
IT'S A TRAGEDY THAT RUSSIANS
DON'T GET TO HAVE AN ACTUAL
DEMOCRACY, I THINK ANYONE, EVEN
THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR SYSTEM
IS MANIPULATIVE, IS A TRAGEDY.
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THEIR
DESIRES TRANSLATED INTO
GOVERNMENT ACTION.
I BELIEVE IN
STANDING UP FOR PROGRESSIVE
ACTION EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
IN TERMS OF THE CALL I DON'T
CARE, MAYBE I'VE BEEN SO BEATEN
DOWN BY THE NEWS THAT I DON'T
HAVE ANY MORE CARE LEFT IN ME.
IF THE GENERAL TOPIC IS
SOMETHING TRUMP IS DOING AND IT
HAS TO DO WITH RUSSIA THIS IS
FAR DOWN ON MY LIST OF THINGS I
CARE ABOUT, THE ONLY THING THAT
MAKES ME VAGUELY INTERESTED
RIGHT NOW IS THE TIMING, I GUESS
IT DOES HAVE TO COME AFTER THE
ELECTION SO THAT MAKES SENSE,
BUT, I MEAN, THEY DID JUST
ASSASSINATE SOMEONE WITH A NERVE
AGENT THEY RELEASED INSIDE OF
THE U.K. LIKE A WEEK AGO, THAT
SEEMS KIND OF RELEVANT.
AND WE
JUST FOUND OUT LAST WEEK THAT
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HACKERS
HACKED INTO OUR POWER GRID, OUR
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, OUR NUCLEAR
POWER SYSTEMS, AND ALL OF THIS
SO THEY COULD INSTALL THE
CAPABILITY TO THEORETICALLY TURN
IT OFF AND ON WHENEVER THEY
WANT.
THAT SEEMS IMPORTANT.
I
DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE
ENERGY SECTOR NECESSARILY BUT
THEY JUST DID THAT.
IN THE WAKE
OF THOSE TWO THINGS -- 90 AND
2018 YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO CARE
ABOUT THOSE THINGS BECAUSE IT
HAS TO DO WITH RUSSIA SO YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO ATTEND THAT NONE OF
IT MATTERS AND IF YOU DO CARE
ABOUT IT YOU PROBABLY WANT
NUCLEAR WAR WITH RUSSIA EVEN
THOUGH YOU DON'T AND YOU ARE
EXPLICITLY ANTIWAR, BUT THOSE
THINGS THAT JUST HAPPENS OR
TIMING WISE MAYBE HE COULD HAVE
HELD OFF.
MAYBE HE COULD'VE SLID
INTO HIS DMs OR SOMETHING SO IT
WASN'T AS EXPLICIT BUT THE CALL,
I'M NOT GOING TO GET DOWN ON
TRUMP JUST BECAUSE HE HAD A
CALL.
>>WE ARE ALLOWED TO BE
RATIONAL, AND THE RATIONAL
REACTION IS NOT WHAT SOME OF THE
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN
SENATORS ARE SAYING, WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL PUTIN AND PUNCH HIM IN
THE FACE AND SLIT HIS THROAT ON
THE PHONE WITH HIM?
>>WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?
>>RIGHT.
OR, OH NO, IT'S OKAY,
YOU HUG IT OUT.
HEY, WAY TO
MURDER THAT PERSON WITH A NERVE
AGENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE U.K.,
CONGRATULATIONS, BIG GUY.
I
THINK IT'S FAIR TO ASK FOR
SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE.
WE CAN
DO DIPLOMACY WILL NOT
CONGRATULATING AN OBVIOUS TYRANT
WHO RUNS THIS COUNTRY.
YOU KNOW
WHO IS MOST HURT BY THE RUSSIAN
NON-ELECTIONS?
THE RUSSIAN
PEOPLE, THEY HAVE BEEN ROBBED OF
THEIR DEMOCRACY.
WE SHOULD BE
FURIOUS ABOUT THAT, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD BE STUPID
AND DEMAND WAR OR ACTIONS THAT
LEAD TO FURTHER CONFLICT.
I
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL TRUMP
IS TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS
SUMMIT TO STOP THE ARMS RACE --
WHAT ARMS RACE?
AND MY GUESS IS
WHAT HE'S DOING IS, OH NO, I'M
BEING NICE TO PUTIN NOT BECAUSE
I'M HIS BACK POCKET, NOT AT ALL,
IT'S BECAUSE I WANT TO DO
DIPLOMACY.
THAT'S IT, DIPLOMACY.
YOU KNOW ME, I'M VERY
DIPLOMATIC.
AND SOME PEOPLE
BELIEVE IT, SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE
TRUMP WANTS PEACE AND DIPLOMACY.
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME GUY,
RIGHT?
NO, HE'S NOT BELLIGERENT,
TRUMP BEING BELLIGERENT?
HE'S
BELLIGERENT AGAINST EVERYONE.
JAKE TAPPER TODAY MADE A GREAT
POINT, TRUMP HAS BEEN MORE
BELLIGERENT TOWARDS JAKE TAPPER
AND DON LEMON THAN HE HAS
VLADIMIR PUTIN.
>>LET ALONE CHUCK TODD.
>>I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE
BELLIGERENT TO PUTIN, ALTHOUGH
IF WE ARE GOING TO LOWER NUCLEAR
WEAPONS THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.
BUT TRUMP HAS SAID HE WANTS TO
DO 10 TIMES THE WEAPONS WE HAVE.
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S
OBVIOUS THAT HE IS NEVER GOING
TO CRITICIZE PUTIN AND THERE'S A
REASON FOR THAT, HE CRITICIZES
EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET
INCLUDING HIS CLOSEST ALLIES, HE
WILL VICIOUSLY ATTACK ANYONE
THAT CROSSES HIM FOR A SECOND,
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO VLAD, HE'S
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.
SO WHY THE
BETA ACT?
YOU KNOW WHY.
BUT IF
YOU ARE STILL PRETENDING THAT,
NO, TRUMP IS TREATING PUTIN LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE, YOU ARE ON A
DIFFERENT PLANET DUDE.
JUST WAKE
UP AND REALIZE IT, RAISE YOUR
HAND AND GO OKAY, I CAN'T SEE
STRAIGHT.
TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE
HE'S TREATING PUTIN JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE.
OKAY, YOU LIVE
WITH THAT BUT THAT'S NOWHERE
NEAR TRUE.
