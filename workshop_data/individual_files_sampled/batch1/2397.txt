hey killing over from a heart attack is a dramatic way to die in the movies but it's very different in reality this misperception could prove deadly especially for women heart disease is the number one killer of women in the u.s. yet many women can't recognize when their disease takes a turn for the worse the signs of an oncoming heart attack are often different in women than men chest pain that radiates down one arm isn't as common in women and the pressure or pain can pop up in bizarre places like the jaw upper abdomen and back other symptoms include shortness of breath extreme fatigue dizziness lightheadedness nausea fainting pressure or pain in the neck and lower chest and squeezing sensations around the abdomen it's not clear why women experience heart attacks differently part of the reason could have to do with why women are more prone to heart disease than men for example diabetes increases the risk of heart disease more in women so does smoking lack of physical activity and low levels of estrogen after menopause despite their risks women are less likely to get checked for heart disease and each year more women die of the disease than men so make sure you know the signs and risks because heart attacks are not just for Hollywood and Men
