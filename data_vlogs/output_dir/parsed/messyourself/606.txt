Trevor
like he's not fabulous man that sucks in
all seriousness though Trevor is a
beautiful man but I've been thinking
that some people just don't treat him
right you know don't treat him like
enough respect so I've been thinking
Trevor needs a job now what is the most
manliest job you can think of a second
well I'm my saying fuck the police I am
the police so this is Trevor's new
uniform
doesn't he look beautiful don't ask me
where I got it from though
give me your uniform bitch so Trevor has
the outfit but he doesn't have
everything to become a police officer
police officer needs dough you guessed
it a police car now how the fuck are we
gonna get one of those I know what we
can do guys have you ever rang up the
police just as a prank all I have
