1
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:15,083
IN THE CARAVAN, I WILL SEAL

2
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:16,117
OFF THE BORDER BEFORE THEY

3
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,418
COME INTO THIS COUNTRY.

4
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:18,820
AND I WILL BRING OUT OUR

5
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:19,187
MILITARY.

6
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:19,687
NOT OUR RESERVES.

7
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:21,189
I WILL BRING OUT OUR

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,622
MILITARY.

9
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:22,290
STEVE: THAT'S THE PRESIDENT

10
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,158
MAKING HIS MESSAGE CLEAR AS

11
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:25,693
THAT CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS

12
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:28,029
GROWS TO AN ESTIMATED 7200

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,230
AT THIS HOUR.

14
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:29,931
AINSLEY: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:30,832
IS IT TIME FOR THE MILITARY

16
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:31,999
TO GET INVOLVED?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,035
LET'S ASK OUR U.S. ARMY

18
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:36,003
VETERAN AND "FOX & FRIENDS"

19
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,639
CO-HOST PETE HEGSETH.

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,607
PETE: I SERVED OUR COUNTRY

21
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:40,208
NEVER AT THE BORDER.

22
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:41,609
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT

23
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,677
WILL BE TIME TO DEPLOY THE

24
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:43,044
MILITARY.

25
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:43,444
I BELIEVE.

26
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,779
SO WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR

27
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,413
IMMIGRATION POLICIES.

28
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:46,881
WE DON'T HAVE A WALL.

29
00:00:46,882 --> 00:00:49,283
CATCH AND RELEASE STILL IN

30
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:50,318
EFFECT.

31
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,619
WE'RE NOT STOPPING THEM

32
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,587
BEFORE THEY COME TO THE

33
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:52,920
BORDER.

34
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,388
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

35
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:55,790
REALLY DEAL WITH THIS -- AND

36
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,558
WE WERE TALKING TO FOLKS ON

37
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,127
THE BORDER ON THE WEEKEND

38
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:00,294
SHOW.

39
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:01,129
UTTERLY UNPREPARED FOR THIS.

40
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,497
DOING THE BEST WE CAN WITH

41
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:03,965
WHAT WE HAVE.

42
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:04,899
CROSSINGS ARE STILL UP AND

43
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,200
WITH THIS CARAVAN COMING

44
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,401
WE'RE NOT READY.

45
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,736
BRIAN: NOT READY BY LAW, IF

46
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:10,004
THEY CROSS, CERTAIN THINGS

47
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:11,339
THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO.

48
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,340
THEY ARE GOING TO GET THEIR

49
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:13,674
TIME IN FRONT OF A JUDGE.

50
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,243
GOING TO BE HELD ABOUT 20

51
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:15,543
DAYS.

52
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:16,244
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE

53
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:17,512
ARMY IS THERE SOMEHOW WE

54
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:18,713
HAVE TO GET ON THE OTHER

55
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:20,715
SIDE OF THE BORDER TO STOP

56
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:21,048
IT.

57
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,016
PETE: BECAUSE THE LAWS ARE

58
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:23,518
AS THE PRESIDENT CALLS THEM

59
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:23,818
DUMB.

60
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:25,186
THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE.

61
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:26,020
THEY DON'T PROTECT OUR

62
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:26,420
SOVEREIGNTY.

63
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,622
THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO

64
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:28,556
BACK TO CONGRESS AND SAY

65
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:29,690
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE ACTUALLY

66
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,791
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT A WALL

67
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:32,193
IS PART OF SAYING YOU DON'T

68
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:33,728
GET TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY

69
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:34,629
UNLESS YOU PROVE THAT YOU

70
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,329
ARE A REFUGEE.

71
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,665
GO TO A PORT OF ENTRY.

72
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,099
CLAIM ASYLUM.

73
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,600
YOU WILL GET YOUR DAY IN

74
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:39,901
COURT.

75
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:40,902
WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER

76
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:42,003
IT'S VALID OR NOT.

77
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:43,371
YOU GOT THE PRESIDENT OF

78
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,505
GUATEMALA SAYING TO A LOCAL

79
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:45,940
NEWSPAPER DOWN THERE JUST

80
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,608
LAST WEEK THEY CAUGHT OVER

81
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,846
100 ISIS FIGHTERS IN

82
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:54,081
GUATEMALA TRYING TO USE THIS

83
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:54,415
CARAVAN.

84
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,349
TALKED TO THEIR LOCAL

85
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,716
NEWSPAPER.

86
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,185
WE DON'T KNOW IT T. HASN'T

87
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:58,352
BEEN VERIFIED.

88
00:01:58,353 --> 00:01:59,754
EVEN ONE POISON PILL IS TOO

89
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,923
MANY IN A CARAVAN LIKE THAT.

90
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:02,823
STEVE: WHAT ABOUT THE FACT

91
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:03,391
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF

92
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,425
MENTION CO-SAID WE ARE GOING

93
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:05,393
TO STOP THEM AND PROCESS

94
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:07,161
THEM AND THEY CAN APPLY FOR

95
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:08,429
ASYLUM IN OUR COUNTRY AND

96
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,131
THEY HAVE HAD COPS IN RIOT

97
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:13,301
GEAR IN MEXICO STOPPING

98
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:15,269
PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME, YOU

99
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,040
KNOW, THEY JUST WALK AROUND

100
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:19,407
THEM.

101
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:20,508
PETE: THE CARAVAN KEEPS

102
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:20,841

103
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:21,943
FROM YOU EVER TRIED TO MAKE

104
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:22,410
A RAFT?

105
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:22,777
YOU CAN'T.

106
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:24,178
THERE IS A CONCERTED EFFORT

107
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,447
TO HELP THESE PEOPLE AND

108
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:28,849
CARAVAN GROWN FROM 5,000 TO

109
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,150
7,000.

110
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:30,051
THEY WILL MAKE THEIR WAY TO

111
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,085
THE BORDER.

112
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:31,919
THESE COUNTRIES WANT THAT

113
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,222
POLITICAL STATEMENT AND SHOW

114
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:34,956
DOWN.

115
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:36,357
BRIAN: JOHN BOLTON IN MOSCOW

116
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,593
GOING TO BE SPEAKING WITH

117
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:39,994
LAVROV OVER THE FOREIGN

118
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:40,661
SECRETARY ABOUT GETTING OUT

119
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,163
OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL SIGNED

120
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:43,564
IN THE 1980s, THEY HAVE

121
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:44,398
BEEN VIOLATING IT.

122
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,399
DO YOU THINK THERE IS SOME

123
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,467
PLAY THERE IN THESE

124
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:47,735
NEGOTIATIONS OR IS IT JUST

125
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:49,403
AN ANNOUNCEMENT?

126
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:51,005
>> WE'LL SEE HOW IT UNFOLDS.

127
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,707
BUT I THINK TREATIES WERE

128
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,208
ONLY AS GOOD AS COMPLIANCE

129
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:54,675
AND CONTEXT.

130
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,244
AND IF THE RUSSIANS AREN'T

131
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:57,545
COMPLYING AND WE ARE, THEN

132
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:58,613
WE ARE LOSING.

133
00:02:58,614 --> 00:02:59,747
THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE

134
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:01,616
SIGNED THAT TREATY WAS THE

135
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:02,049
COLD WAR.

136
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,518
U.S. AND THE USSR THE TWO

137
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,586
NUCLEAR SUPER POWERS.

138
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:08,055
SINCE THEN WHO HAS EMERGED?

139
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:08,356
CHINA.

140
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:10,191
CHINA NOW HAS TECHNOLOGY AND

141
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:12,927
THEY ARE THE SEEN AND WE

142
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:13,361
DON'T.

143
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:14,195
AINSLEY: ARE WE BEING TOUGH

144
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:15,696
ENOUGH IN THE CRITICS SAYING

145
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:16,430
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T BEEN

146
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:17,365
TOUGH ENOUGH ON RUSSIA.

147
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:18,566
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

148
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:19,700
>> TOTAL OPPOSITE OF THE

149
00:03:19,701 --> 00:00:00,000
REALITY ON GROUND.
