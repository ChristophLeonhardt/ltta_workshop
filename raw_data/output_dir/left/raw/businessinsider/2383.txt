1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,170
is the new AOL going to be the content

2
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,660
publishing platform for the 21st<font color="#CCCCCC"> century</font>

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,180
that is the question Patrick you run

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,189
associated content you're way ahead of

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,680
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim Armstrong is doing at AOL but</font>

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,750
Tim<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually founded associated content</font>

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,119
Owens twenty percent of it is what's

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,859
coming out of AOL is that alarming to

9
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:32,910
you do you think they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">something close to what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,100
well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say it's</font>

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,960
alarming I mean Tim's a friend and is an

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,879
investor in the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can't say</font>

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,260
that I'm privy to exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,329
strategy is a day well but I can say for

16
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,760
sure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked to lots of companies</font>

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost effective content creation is</font>

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,020
on the minds of everybody on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web</font>

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,789
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do I build content that's</font>

20
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,800
discoverable that's monetizable and

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,840
that's unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how do you do that at</font>

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,270
massive scale and it does sound a lot

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,620
like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been talking about</font>

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they're talking about at AOL in</font>

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,219
terms of content again I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,840
exactly what his strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I can only</font>

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,150
see what's been said publicly but that's

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,830
not unique to Tim I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at</font>

29
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yahoo Yahoo if you look at Microsoft if</font>

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,640
you look at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of traditional</font>

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,590
publishers of content not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mention</font>

32
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like demand and others</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,439
in our space I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is</font>

34
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,240
realizing the power of search and

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,280
discovery of content the power of this

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,990
kind of content to be able to monetize

37
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,119
for an advertiser's perspective and just

38
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of the cost-effective creation of</font>

39
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,170
this kind of content and right now as I

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,119
understand it the core<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what AOL is</font>

41
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,770
talking about is basically web blogs

42
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,630
which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason Calacanis his company</font>

43
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,030
and gadget<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the lead site obviously a</font>

44
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,159
huge leader in this new<font color="#E5E5E5"> style of</font>

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,020
publishing that you have taken where

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,060
you're not actually employing everybody

47
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,890
directly yourself but you're just

48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,200
spreading it around you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3,000 people</font>

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,110
can trigger it doesn't add to zero<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

50
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,119
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> remarkable number of people</font>

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually contributing to it right now</font>

52
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,680
AOL is still actually managing the

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,229
production much smaller number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

54
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,729

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,079
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and do something like what you're</font>

59
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,068
for about four years now and every

60
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,179
important metric to us has grown well

61
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:10,810
north of one hundred percent

62
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,819
year-over-year including<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,590
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at quantcast and we're</font>

of user prosumer generated content and

71
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,709
really discoverable information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

72
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,290
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of big publishers on the web or</font>

73
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,819
realizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a really</font>

74
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,709
effective model for creating content and

how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that content will step away</font>

77
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:46,750
content versus content as a long shelf

78
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,939
life and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> canta yeah no</font>

79
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a great question i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean we accept</font>

80
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,419
there's a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> democracy to how we</font>

81
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:53,919
accept content will accept content from

82
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,889
anyone on virtually any topic making

83
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that again it's protected and has</font>

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,980
the right right surround it and we do

85
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,930
take news content news to be frank is

86
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,730
very challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> to monetize you know</font>

87
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,040
you have basically three days of value

88
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,049
with that product often generates a lot

89
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,489
of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally it's a lot of page</font>

90
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,530
views in traffic but what works<font color="#E5E5E5"> best for</font>

91
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,659
us is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this long shelf life long tail</font>

92
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,609
content any piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of content that was</font>

93
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">created in say 2005 on a homemade</font>

94
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,930
halloween costume is as useful today's

95
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,030
the day was created so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

96
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,949
content that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that it's really</font>

97
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily found through search it's easy to</font>

98
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,479
monetize and its unique news content

99
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,189
will take that and we generate a lot of

100
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,199
a lot of user interest in traffic in

101
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,879
news but again I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's really</font>

102
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,709
hard to monetize that content so back to

103
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,260
AOL big question for AOL leaving aside

104
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,030
associated contact you know Tim very

105
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,769
well very well is he<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to remake</font>

106
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,239
this company into something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

107
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,739
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collapse and go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero well I</font>

108
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,599
would never bet against him<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean tim</font>

109
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,459
is you know the greatest leader I've

110
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,189
ever worked for and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he has</font>

111
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,310
the kind of smarts to monetize virtually

112
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,689
any platform there is a word I keep

113
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:56,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">using but I think it's going to be</font>

114
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,479
important for them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think they</font>

115
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,859
do have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges on the product</font>

116
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,629
side of the business but you know it's

117
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,669
it's not my DNA to ever bet against<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

118
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,409
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's surrounded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> himself with</font>

119
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,750
a great team I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he's has his work</font>

120
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,220
cut out for him it's a product and

121
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,220
platform and advertising opportunity

122
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people need to</font>

123
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,340
look at again but he's got he's

124
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,659
definitely got his work cut out for him

125
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> given that it sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're</font>

126
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,500
both doing something quite similar and

127
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,060
he personally already owns twenty

128
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,860
percent of you

129
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,300
shouldn't we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put the companies</font>

130
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,009
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and call it a day you'll have</font>

131
00:04:26,009 --> 00:00:00,000
to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> him that okay thanks Pat</font>
