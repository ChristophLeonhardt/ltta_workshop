1
00:00:00,675 --> 00:00:03,644
CHINA, BRITAIN, FRANCE AND

2
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:04,712
GERMANY, WHO ARE DISAPPOINTED IN

3
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:05,847
THE PRESIDENT FOR THIS AND MAY

4
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:06,581
NOT GO ALONG WITH WHAT HE WANTS

5
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:08,349
TO DO.

6
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:10,418
THEN WHAT?

7
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:12,453
LET'S ASK GENERAL JERRY BOYKIN.

8
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:18,860
THEY ARE CLAIMING, THE

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,261
COSIGNATORIES ON THIS AGREEMENT,

10
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:21,028
THEY ARE UPSET, AND THEY ARE NOT

11
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:22,196
GOING ALONG.

12
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:24,165
DO YOU BELIEVE THEM?

13
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:27,468
>> I THINK I BELIEVE THEM IN THE

14
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:29,237
SHORT TERM BUT THIS IS A

15
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:29,770
STERLING EXAMPLE OF

16
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,340
INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP.

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,442
I'M PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT FOR

18
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:35,843
WHAT HE HAS DONE AND I THINK

19
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:39,547
WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THE SAME

20
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,582
THING AS WHEN HE SAID HE WILL

21
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:44,085
MOVE THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.

22
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,654
EVERYONE CAME BACK WITH A VERY

23
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:47,154
NEGATIVE REACTION.

24
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:48,489
BUT NOW YOU ARE SEEING

25
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:50,658
INCREMENTALLY WON BY ONE OTHER

26
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:51,525
COUNTRIES MAKING THE SAME

27
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:51,893
DECISIONS.

28
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:52,827
I THINK WE WILL SEE A SIMILAR

29
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:56,264
THING IN THIS.

30
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:56,964
>> Neil: ANOTHER THING THAT I

31
00:00:56,964 --> 00:01:00,067
SEE, AND THIS GOES BACK TO MY

32
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,637
LITTLE DIRTY WORLD, IS A

33
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:03,137
PRAGMATIC PATTERN.

34
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:05,438
MORE PRAGMATIC THAN I THINK THE

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,173
CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENTS HAVE

36
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:07,608
GIVEN HIM.

37
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:10,044
I THINK THAT IS THAT HE HAS A 90

38
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:11,445
DAY SORT OF COOLING.

39
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:12,380
BEFORE IT WOULD REVERT BACK TO

40
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,650
SOME OF THE SANCTIONS.

41
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,451
THEN I WOULD ASSUME A NEW DEAL

42
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,886
COULD BE HAD OR CONSTRUCTS OF

43
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:21,956
ONE COULD BE HOW TO COME UP WHAT

44
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,657
THINK?

45
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:24,659
>> General Boykin: IT'S A

46
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,460
90-180 DAYS, WHICH I THINK IS A

47
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,929
POSITIVE THING BECAUSE IT GIVES

48
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:29,764
THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN

49
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:32,767
PARTICULAR -- CHINA AND RUSSIA

50
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:35,136
WILL DO THEIR OWN THINGS BUT I

51
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:35,870
THINK THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE

52
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,871
THE KEY HERE.

53
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,439
I THINK THIS GIVES THEM TIME

54
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,741
ENOUGH TO SAVE FACE AND TO

55
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:44,445
NEGOTIATE IN SOME WAY, NOT ONLY

56
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:45,680
WITH EACH OTHER BUT CERTAINLY

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,480
WITH IRAN, TO COME UP WITH

58
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,650
SOMETHING THAT EITHER WOULD MAKE

59
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,586
THIS DEAL MORE PALATABLE, OR, TO

60
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:53,554
GET OUT OF IT ALTOGETHER

61
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:55,489
THEMSELVES.

62
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:56,290
>> Neil: GENERAL, I WONDER

63
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,260
ABOUT THAT.

64
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,394
SOME OF THE THINGS IRAN WANTED

65
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:02,263
OUT OF THE DEAL, IT GOT.

66
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,665
I GOT MONEY, PALLETS OF CASH

67
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,467
SHIPPED TO THEM ON PRIVATE JETS.

68
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,301
SAY NOTHING OF THE BILLIONS THAT

69
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,669
WERE UNFROZEN AND HANDED BACK.

70
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,038
SO YOU COULD MAKE THE CYNICAL

71
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,574
POINT HERE THAT THEY ARE A

72
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:16,043
LITTLE IN TO WANT THE IRANIANS

73
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:17,979
TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE PRESIDENT,

74
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,881
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

75
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,049
>> General Boykin: I THINK

76
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,217
THERE CERTAINLY IS AN INCENTIVE

77
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:24,652
FOR THE IRANIANS IN THAT, WHAT

78
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:25,853
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IS THEY

79
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:28,489
DON'T WANT TO SEE THE EUROPEANS.

80
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:29,557
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT THEY

81
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:31,292
AMERICAN SLAPPED THE SANCTIONS

82
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,660
ON THEM BUT THEY CERTAINLY DON'T

83
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,463
WANT TO SEE THE EUROPEANS DO IT.

84
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:36,497
EUROPEANS HAVE MADE HUGE

85
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:37,932
INVESTMENTS SINCE THE DEAL WAS

86
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:39,667
MADE IN 2015 AND THEY DON'T WANT

87
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,669
TO LOSE THOSE INVESTMENTS, THOSE

88
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,204
BUSINESSES OR CORPORATIONS THAT

89
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,739
HAVE ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WITH

90
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:45,172
THE IRANIANS.

91
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:48,075
I WOULD BE A SEVERE BLOW TO

92
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:48,509
THEIR ECONOMY.

93
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:51,479
>> Neil: WHILE I HAVE YOU,

94
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,546
JOHN KERRY WAS APOPLECTIC ABOUT

95
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:54,281
THIS, SPEAKING IN ITALY.

96
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,450
MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE WAS

97
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,385
WORKING AND THE SCENES,

98
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,919
SOMETIMES NOT EVEN BEHIND THE

99
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,855
SCENES, TO PUSH BACK AT THIS.

100
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:03,124
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

101
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:04,258
>> General Boykin: THIS WAS

102
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:06,060
SUPPOSED TO BE HIS LEGACY, AND

103
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,028
HIS LEGACY WAS JUST DESTROYED

104
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:08,863
WITH ONE DECISION BY OUR

105
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:09,263
PRESIDENT.

106
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:11,866
BUT STOP AND THINK ABOUT THIS.

107
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,501
YOU NOW HAVE MIKE POMPEO ON THE

108
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,269
WAY TO NORTH KOREA.

109
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,070
DO YOU THINK MIKE POMPEO MIGHT

110
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,205
BE GOING IN IN A BIG STRONGER

111
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,874
POSITION THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN

112
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:21,675
IF WE HAD STAYED IN THIS DEAL?

113
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,444
I THINK SO.

114
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:24,779
CARRIE WENT IN WITH NOTHING AND

115
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:29,083
HE GOT NOTHING OUT OF IT.

116
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,418
>> Shepard: THERE ARE SOME

117
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,455
SAYING, SPEAKING OF THOSE

118
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:35,089
NORTH KOREAN NEGOTIATIONS,

119
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,258
AMERICANS CAN WILLY-NILLY TURN

120
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,692
THEIR BACK ON DEALS HERE.

121
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:40,061
AND I KNOW THIS WAS NOT A TREATY

122
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,663
AND YOU AND I HAVE GOTTEN INTO

123
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:43,464
THIS IN THE PAST.

124
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:44,732
BUT MAYBE THE NORTH KOREANS WILL

125
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:48,035
THINK, WHAT IF THEY ALL OF A

126
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,804
SUDDEN CHANGE THEIR MIND WITH

127
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:52,473
US?

128
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:53,874
>> General Boykin: I DON'T SEE

129
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:54,608
THAT BEING THE CASE.

130
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:57,878
I SEE THAT AS KIM JONG

131
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:58,679
RECOGNIZING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS

132
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,281
A SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT GUY

133
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,116
WITH A DIFFERENT AGENDA THAN OUR

134
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,417
PREVIOUS PRESIDENT, AND I SEE

135
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,453
HIM LOOKING AT THIS AS AN ISSUE

136
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,854
AS STRENGTH AND LEADERSHIP ON

137
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:08,422
OUR PART, OR AT LEAST ON THE

138
00:04:08,422 --> 00:00:00,000
PART OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
