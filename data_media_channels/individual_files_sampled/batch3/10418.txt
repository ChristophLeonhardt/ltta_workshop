former Russian spy circus cripple who was poisoned by a nerve agent in the UK has been discharged from hospital he and his daughter were admitted on March the 4th after being exposed to a substance known as Navi chalk in this city of Salisbury scooter pal was once a Russian intelligence officer but was stripped of his rank after it was revealed he was spying for the UK in 2006 he was sentenced to 13 years in jail however he was released four years later in a high-profile spy swap and he moved to the UK the Russian ambassador to the UK says that Russia is still being denied consular access to him in violation of international law unfortunately we don't have access to these people - Sergey and Yulia 3-part who are the Russian citizens if they don't want our system that's fine but we want to see them because for the foot today nobody saw the pictures nobody heard their voice nobody saw whether they arrived or not we don't know okay let's get more information now with Polly Boyko she joins us from our UK office good afternoon again Polly good news as we said that Sergei script pal has been discharged but still not an awful lot known about the case and more facts coming forward seems to be pretty scant yeah and I don't think we're gonna get many more facts Sergei script I'll have been discharged from hospital we know that the medical team have said that he's going to be continuing his recovery outside of Salisbury District Hospital in terms of his location well that's a closely guarded secret we can assume that he has been whisked off to a safe house much like his daughter daughter Yulia scribble was back when she was discharged from the same hospital last month and at the time you'll escape I'll put out a statement via the police saying that she was appealing for privacy and that despite being a Russian citizen she was refusing all consular assistance from Russia she's been kept well away from the public eye and out of the glare of the media and I think we can expect something very similar with a sergey skripnikov I don't expect we're going to hear much more about him or his daughter from the British authorities at least and that in itself is very interesting given the massive scandal that the they're poisoning sparked and the diplomatic fallout that we've had as a result between Russia and the UK take a look at how the four the poisoning of the former double agent and his daughter has unfolded over the past two months the government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergei and Juliana's gripper there can be no suggestion of business as usual in relation to our our interaction with Russia mr. speaker this action has happened against a backdrop of a well-established pattern of Russian state aggression and that sort of rhetoric continues and it's really been adopted sort of as the established narrative in regards to this case here in the UK just a few days ago the head of mi5 Andrew Parker said that Russia was guilty of the reckless poisoning of the scrip house so politically this is a case where Moscow has very much been singled out as sort of the unequivocal culprit even though the head scientist at the government laboratory Porton down where the sample of the nerve agent was identified as Naveed shock the head scientists there has said that scientists can't ascertain the origin of the Nova chock used to poison the scrip house in regards to where the Nova chock may have come from well the Russian ambassador has said in in his press conference that he was giving a little bit earlier on but the UK government's continued assertion that it could have only been Russia behind this attack well that is becoming increasingly under question take a listen to what the Russian ambassador Alexander Yakov anco had to say visas of Prime Minister to resume that Russia is the only country that was capable of doing things I was wrong the certain amount of Navy job was produced in in Czech Republic small amounts of Navi truck were produced and tested in the Czech Republic we know when and we know where it would be hypocritical to pretend that such a thing never happened so sergey skripnikov hospital and it's safe to assume that the police are going to want to have a few more conversations with him as well Scotland Yard has released a statement today saying that the counterterrorism investigation into the attack continues and there gonna be that keeping the progress of the investigation under wraps as well as the presumably now extensive and complicated security arrangements surrounding sergey skripnikov that is confidential as well but I think the most important thing to keep in mind with this case is that despite the huge scandal that it's created the political fallout that it's caused the diplomatic expulsion z' and the war of words between London and Moscow it appears that investigators are still none the wiser as to who the assassin was that smeared this toxic nerve agent on the door handle of the script Powell's house in Salisbury sure ok thanks a poly that was a artis poli Boyko reporting there from London
