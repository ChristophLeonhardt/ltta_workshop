00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
so whenever there's a big thing being

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,750
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on youtube I like to put in</font>

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,759
my two cents and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I'm going to</font>

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,429
be commenting on the becoming youtube

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,460
Ben cooks video about women on YouTube

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,020
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can click here and you can</font>

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,670
watch it i would recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to be citing specific things</font>

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he says the first thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,480
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is ben's assumption that</font>

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,210
there are fewer women on YouTube than

14
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,369
men this assumption is based on the

15
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,529
opinions of the people that then chose

16
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,210
to interview as part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font>

17

of uber successful main email youtubers

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,260
and I think the quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,090
opinions expressed in the series are

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,730
guilty of being quite anecdotal

22
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,370
sometimes and I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,350

so doing end up featuring some female

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,150
youtubers primarily because they're

completely the opposite way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen</font>

ignores a huge amount of incredibly

the fabric<font color="#E5E5E5"> of youtube and so our makeup</font>

finally I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

about extensively

112
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,520
in academia and it's been proven that

113
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is at least a perception that</font>

114
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,200
women receive more hate when they

115

participate in online forums this has

116
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,560
been put down to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that</font>

are traditionally seen as male-dominated

119
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,050

traditional gender roles and entering

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this perception now i know that i</font>

personally earlier accused been of being

a little bit too anecdotal but i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

126
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,830
draw from my own experiences in order to

127
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,770
contest the idea that women receive more

along the lines of a rich posh communist

to bend me over in public it's not fun

141
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,710
it's sometimes makes you feel a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

bit shitty but it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>
