1
00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:00,889
INVESTIGATION.

2
00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:03,425
FOR YEARS HE HAS BEEN SAYING

3
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:04,859
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND I'M

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,095
GOING TO PROVE IT TO YOU.

5
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:08,597
THINGS COMING OUT I WANT YOU

6
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:10,298
TO FOCUS ON THAT.

7
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,233
THINK ABOUT MEASURED THINK

8
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,701
ABOUT WHAT HE HAS DONE.

9
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:13,635
THINGS ARE STARTING TO GO

10
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:14,936
OFF RAILS A LITTLE BIT BUT

11
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:16,071
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T.

12
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:17,005
THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

13
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:17,405
AGGRESSIVE.

14
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:18,273
OTHERS HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE

15
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:19,107
HE HAS NOT.

16
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:20,508
SO I ASKED HIM WHAT ABOUT

17
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:21,142
THIS SUMMIT?

18
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:22,410
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE IT'S ON

19
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:22,877
TRACK?

20
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:24,379
NOW, I HAVE TO BE HONEST,

21
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,314
AFTERWARDS I FOUND OUT FROM

22
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:27,616
READING THE CHINESE

23
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:28,650
NEWSPAPERS WHERE NORTH KOREA

24
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,884
THINKS OF MIKE PENCE'S

25
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:30,919
COMMENTS DID I NOT HAVE THAT

26
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:31,786
INFORMATION GOING IN.

27
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:36,691
BUT, WATCH.

28
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:37,392
JUNE 12TH, HAVE YOU GOING TO

29
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:38,293
BE IN SINGAPORE.

30
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:41,096
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

31
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:42,430
RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT

32
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,498
IT TALKING ABOUT IT WE HAVE

33
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:44,099
CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

34
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:44,866
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

35
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:45,700
THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE.

36
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,868
AND IT WOULD BE A GREAT

37
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:48,036
THING FOR NORTH KOREA.

38
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:49,237
IF THAT HAPPENS, IT WILL BE

39
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:50,405
A GREAT THING FOR NORTH

40
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:50,705
KOREA.

41
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:51,506
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT WOULD

42
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:52,874
BE A GREAT THING FOR THE

43
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:53,174
WORLD.

44
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:54,476
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

45
00:00:54,476 --> 00:00:55,377
BRIAN: ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE

46
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:57,812
PHASE IN OF A I DO

47
00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:58,313
NUCLEARIZATION.

48
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:00,048
IF CONFIDENCE MEASURES ARE

49
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:00,415
REQUIRED?

50
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:01,516
>> WE ARE GOING TO SEE.

51
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:04,019
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT DONE

52
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,753
IMMEDIATELY.

53
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:07,289
PHYSICALLY, A PHASE-IN MAY

54
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:08,490
BE NECESSARY.

55
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,091
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT DONE

56
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:11,092
AT ONE TIME.

57
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:12,027
STEVE: THAT'S THE KEY POINT

58
00:01:12,027 --> 00:01:12,460
RIGHT THERE.

59
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,461
THAT'S THE SOUND BITE.

60
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:15,363
RATHER THAN JUST NORTH KOREA

61
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:16,531
PULLING THE PLUG COMPLETELY,

62
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:18,900
THEY WOULD DO IT OVER

63
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,301
STAGES.

64
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:19,968
AINSLEY: THEY ARE NOT GOING

65
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,102
TO GIVE UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

66
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:22,337
THEY SAID THAT.

67
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:23,204
STEVE: THEY WANT LEVERAGE.

68
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:25,774
TO BRIAN'S POINT, ONE OF THE

69
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:27,242
FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM NORTH

70
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:28,543
KOREA SAID REGARDING MIKE

71
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:29,444
PENCE, CALLED HIM A

72
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:30,879
POLITICAL DUMMY BECAUSE MIKE

73
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,348
PENCE CAME OUT AND SAID, YOU

74
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:35,650
KNOW, UNLESS NORTH KOREA

75
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,319
DENUKES, GOING TO WIND UP

76
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,186
LIKE LIBYA.

77
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:39,387
GOING TO WIND UP LIKE

78
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:39,721
QADDAFI.

79
00:01:39,721 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WAS NOT GOOD FOR
