very positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> development for our</font>

key issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> queued up at the FCC that</font>

were being shoved through literally and

then they included you know privacy how

those will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be picked up again so just</font>

each of them would probably be wide wind

up in court at some point they're gone

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's pouring capital in and all sudden</font>

33
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,030
you find yourself pausing and saying

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,490
should we invest there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

35
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,080
implications are big and I in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,270
would suggest that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

37
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,220
economists that have been commenting

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,140
about the impact of regulation are

39
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,890
missing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point there is no decision</font>

40
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,229
whether it's doing a big acquisition

41
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,360
like time warner or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's saying</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going to put a service like DirecTV</font>

now in the marketplace and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,450
price it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero rated data all of</font>

45
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,000
those require extensive deliberation and

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,890
calibration or what is the regulatory

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,950
implication of this it causes a stifling

48
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,200
in in corporate America to pause and

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,509
evaluate every move you make under this

50
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,670
guy's and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

have an impact on how fast innovation

52
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,540
happens I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's going to have an</font>

53
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,729
impact on how fast investment decisions

54
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,079
are made and capital allocation

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,700
decisions are made I think we're

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,140
understating what the implications are

57
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,209
if we truly do get to a more rational

00:02:09,209 --> 00:00:00,000
regulatory environment
