1
00:00:01,445 --> 00:00:02,144
SOME UNDECIDED.

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:04,080
AFTER THIS DEBATE WE'LL SEE.

3
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:05,715
>> Bill: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON

4
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:10,586
THE ROAD FOR THE MID-TERMS.

5
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:13,155
HE IS ACCUMULATING A MASSIVE

6
00:00:13,156 --> 00:00:17,927
WAR CHEST FOR 2020 ALREADY

7
00:00:17,928 --> 00:00:19,328
RAISING $100 MILLION.

8
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:25,234
JOSH HOLMES ON THE A-TEAM.

9
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:27,870
MATT BENNETT AND BRIAN BRENBERG.

10
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:30,606
GENTLEMEN, NICE TO SEE YOU ALL.

11
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:31,373
ARIZONA, NEVADA, MONTANA AT THE

12
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:33,309
END OF THE WEEK.

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,644
$100 MILLION IN A WAR CHEST.

14
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:38,314
SOMEONE IS BOOKING DOWN THE

15
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,482
ROAD, HUH?

16
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:45,521
>> ORDINARILY A PRESIDENT WOULD

17
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:46,689
RAISE HEAT WHILE RAISING $100

18
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,022
MILLION.

19
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:49,258
THERE IS NO PRT IN MODERN

20
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,294
HISTORY WHO HAS DONE MORE IN A

21
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,596
MID-TERM IN TERMS OF DOWN

22
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:54,864
TICKET AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS

23
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:56,065
BUT THE POLITICAL TRAVEL.

24
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:58,968
AS YOU SAID HE IS EVERYWHERE.

25
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,836
>> Bill: ALWAYS ON THE ROAD.

26
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:02,938
>> ALWAYS ON THE ROAD.

27
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:03,672
TONS OF ENERGY AND EVERYBODY

28
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:04,573
WANTS HIM.

29
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:06,709
>> Sandra: IS THAT A GOOD THING.

30
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,643
DOES IT SCARE DEMOCRATS?

31
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:09,478
>> I HAVE TO AGREE WITH JOSH,

32
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,615
HE HAS DONE A LOT FOR DOWN

33
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:13,449
BALLOT CANDIDATES, DEMOCRATIC

34
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:13,849
CANDIDATES.

35
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,151
WHEN HE GOES ON THE ROAD HE

36
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:17,453
HELPS US AND WE LOVE TO SEE IT.

37
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:19,088
>> Sandra: HOW SO?

38
00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:22,925
>> LOOK, HE IS UNBELIEVABLY

39
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:23,859
UNPOPULAR, AS MANY MID-TERM

40
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,326
PRESIDENTS ARE.

41
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:26,796
THE HOUSE IS VERY LIKELY TO

42
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:28,197
FLIP BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS

43
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,065
STRUGGLING SO BADLY IN THE

44
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,233
MIDWEST AND NORTHEAST AND

45
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:33,102
CALIFORNIA AND LOTS OF PLACES.

46
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:35,204
WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE SENATE

47
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,605
RACE IN TEXAS.

48
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:39,441
MUCH OF THAT IS --

49
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:42,244
>> THE FACT THAT HE RAISED $100

50
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:43,212
MILLION BECAUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE

51
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:45,548
HANDED IT TO HIM WITH THE

52
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:46,248
HYSTERIA WE'VE SEEN.

53
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:47,416
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK FOR

54
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:47,716
THIS.

55
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:49,752
PEOPLE LOOK AT THE POLITICAL

56
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:51,387
LANDSCAPE AND SEE THE KINDS OF

57
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:52,788
THINGS BEING SAID, THE

58
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,423
KAVANAUGH DEBACLE AND SAY WHO

59
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:56,425
CAN WE GIVE MONEY TO HELP REACH

60
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:56,992
OUR INTERESTS?

61
00:01:56,993 --> 00:02:00,162
GIVE IT TO THE PRESIDENT.

62
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:04,133
>> THE REALITY IS YOU GET SOME

63
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:07,870
STATES OFF THE CYCLE WITH NORTH

64
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:08,637
DAKOTA, MONTANA, WEST VIRGINIA,

65
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:09,738
ARIZONA, THESE ARE ALL PLACES

66
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,373
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING JUST

67
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:12,107
FINE.

68
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,275
THERE IS CONCENTRATION OF

69
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:14,443
SUBURBAN AREAS THAT DEMOCRATS

70
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,345
AND MATT ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE

71
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:17,479
WHERE THE PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL

72
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,516
RATING IS NOT WHERE REPUBLICANS

73
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:21,016
WOULD WANT.

74
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,785
WHAT MATTERS IN 2018 IS WHERE

75
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,086
REPUBLICANS WANT IT AND LOOKS

76
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:25,020
PRETTY GOOD.

77
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,422
>> LET'S KEEP IN MIND $100

78
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:29,558
MILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY.

79
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:36,131
BETA  O'ROURKE IN ONE MONTH

80
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:37,066
RAISED $31 MILLION.

81
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,435
>> Bill: WE'LL GET TO THAT.

82
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:40,536
DOESN'T WANT TO SHARE IT,

83
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:44,640
EITHER.

84
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,141
ELIZABETH WARREN MADE A LOT OF

85
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:46,775
WAVES YESTERDAY.

86
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,277
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS STORY

87
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:48,644
GOES.

88
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,279
I THINK IT WENT IN WAYS THAT

89
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,447
EVEN SHE DID NOT EXPECT.

90
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:53,349
HERE IS THE TWEET FROM THE

91
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,716
PRESIDENT.

92
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,684
NOW THAT HER CLAIMS OF INDIAN

93
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:57,987
HERITAGE TURNED OUT TO BE A

94
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,589
SCAM AND LIE ELIZABETH WARREN

95
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,156
SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR

96
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:02,925
PERPETUATING THE FRAUD AGAINST

97
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:03,492
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.

98
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:05,494
HARVARD CALLED HER A PERSON OF

99
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:06,795
COLOR, AMAZING CON AND WOULD

100
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:07,863
NOT HAVE TAKEN HER OTHERWISE.

101
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:10,499
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS DOES TO

102
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,401
HER CHANCES IN 2020?

103
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,271
DID IT CLOUD IT MORE THAN SHE

104
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:17,039
THOUGHT IT WOULD CLARIFY?

105
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,807
>> THE BEST THING FOR HER IS

106
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:20,309
LET THE ISSUE DIE.

107
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,810
INSTEAD SHE LIFTS IT UP AND

108
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:23,379
GIVES IT NEW LIFE.

109
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,280
NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT.

110
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,714
>> Sandra: SHE HAD TO DO

111
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:26,181
SOMETHING.

112
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:28,150
>> THIS IS NOT THE TOPIC YOU

113
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:29,752
WANT TO DO IT.

114
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:31,687
>> Sandra: HER NAME IS UP IN

115
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:35,057
THE FIELD WITH 2020.

116
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:40,029
THE FIELD, JOE BIDEN IS UP 33%,

117
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,164
BERNIE SANDERS 13%, KAMALA

118
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,033
HARRIS AND ELIZABETH WARREN

119
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,901
GETTING 8% ON THAT PARTICULAR

120
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:46,368
POLL.

121
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:48,837
SO SHE SEES HER CHANCES

122
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:49,238
INCREASING.

123
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:50,572
PERHAPS SHE FELT SHE NEEDED TO

124
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:51,507
DO SOMETHING.

125
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:54,610
>> THE PRESIDENT WOUND  --

126
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:58,047
WOULDN'T LET IT DROP.

127
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:59,548
HE HAS A NICKNAME THAT'S

128
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:00,749
OUTRAGEOUS FOR HER AND SHE

129
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,384
WANTED TO CALL HIS BLUFF.

130
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:04,753
SHE HAS SAID PRETTY CLEARLY

131
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:07,089
THAT SHE IS NOT -- DOESN'T HAVE

132
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,692
A DIRECT AND CLOSE RELATIONSHIP

133
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:11,660
TO NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD BUT

134
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:12,995
SHE SHOWED --

135
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:14,396
>> Sandra: SHE OFFENDED THE

136
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:15,364
TRIBE AND THEY'VE RESPONDED

137
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,700
SAYING THEY DID NOT LIKE HER

138
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,568
HANDLING OF THIS DNA TEST.

139
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,704
>> FULLY WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS TO

140
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:22,070
DO THAT.

141
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,572
SHE WAS RESPONDING NOT TO THEM

142
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,709
BUT TO TRUMP.

143
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,876
>> Bill: TRUMP SMOKES YOU OUT

144
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:29,244
OF YOUR HOLE.

145
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,379
>> ABSOLUTELY.

146
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,580
THE FUN LITTLE BEHIND THE

147
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:33,182
SCENES STORY IS THAT DEMOCRATS

148
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:35,284
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020

149
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:36,452
ARE IN THIS BATTLE WITH

150
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:41,657
THEMSELVES TO SEE WHO CAN MAKE

151
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:44,293
A BIGGER FOOL OUT OF THEIR

152
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:44,994
HANDS.

153
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,862
WARREN TOOK THE BATTLE FROM

154
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:47,229
SPARTACUS.

155
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,764
THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING.

156
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,265
>> IT IS A BIG FIELD AND PART

157
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,567
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE.

158
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:53,002
THE REASON THEY'RE DOING THESE

159
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:54,169
THINGS THAT ARE COMPLETELY

160
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,307
FOOLISH IS THEY'RE TRYING TO

161
00:04:58,308 --> 00:04:59,208
DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES.

162
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,543
>> Bill: WE AGREE STHE IS

163
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:01,877
RUNNING.

164
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:04,346
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS HAVE A LOT

165
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,015
OF -- YOU'RE 22 DAYS AS OF

166
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:07,416
YESTERDAY FROM THE MID-TERM

167
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:07,783
ELECTION.

168
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:08,717
YOU CHANNEL THE ENERGY IN THE

169
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:10,219
DIRECTION IN THAT WAY.

170
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,087
I THINK JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING.

171
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:14,623
>> Sandra: DO YOU THINK?

172
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:15,357
>> Bill: YEAH.

173
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:19,061
WHAT KIND OF CANDIDATE DOES HE

174
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:22,131
MAKE 75, 76?

175
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:23,532
>> RELATIVE TO THE FIELD WE'RE

176
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:26,402
LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW HE

177
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:28,003
ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THE SANE

178
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:28,504
CANDIDATE.

179
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:31,073
HE LOOKS LIKE THE SAFE

180
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:31,440
CANDIDATE.

181
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:32,474
THE CANDIDATE THAT'S CARING FOR

182
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,610
THE BEST OF THE DEMOCRATIC

183
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:35,144
PARTY HISTORICALLY.

184
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:36,311
THAT'S ODD FOR ME TO SAY.

185
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:38,113
BUT IN THIS FIELD WHICH IS

186
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:39,748
GOING TO TEAR ITSELF APART, BY

187
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:41,617
THE WAY, ALL THE WAY TO THE

188
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:43,252
CONVENTION, I THINK BIDEN WILL

189
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:46,055
