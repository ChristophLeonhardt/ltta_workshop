1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,930
This is what liquefaction
looks like.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,613
It’s one of the most
devastating effects

3
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:08,501
of an earthquake.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,350
Soil breaks down
and flows like water.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,580
It happens when a quake
strikes an area

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,590
with loose, moist soil
that’s been shaken violently.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,783
The soil behaves like a liquid,
with frightening results.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,500
Indonesian officials say
more than 2,000 homes

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,330
have been destroyed after
a 7.5-magnitude earthquake

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,128
triggered liquefaction
in some areas.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,530
Here’s the village
where this video was filmed.

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,320
It’s located 8.5 miles
from the coast.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,320
This is what it looked
like before the earthquake.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,090
And this is what
it looks like now.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,850
Here, we see where
the houses once stood.

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,670
Now, there’s nothing left.

17
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,810
This other video shows
the same phenomenon

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,880
in a neighborhood
in the city of Palu.

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,520
It has also been
largely destroyed.

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,029
And here is another
neighborhood

21
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:22,780
that has been devastated.

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,460
But liquefaction was
responsible for only part

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,670
of the destruction
after the earthquake.

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,280
On the coast, a tsunami ripped
apart the infrastructure:

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,260
like this bridge

26
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,520
and this beachfront.

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,910
More than 1,200 people
have died

28
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,150
and officials fear 
the death toll could rise

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:00:00,000
as rescue teams continue
their search for survivors.
