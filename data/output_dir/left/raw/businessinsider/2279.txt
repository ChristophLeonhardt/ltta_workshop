after the recovery recovery seems much

too precipitous much<font color="#CCCCCC"> too ill-considered</font>

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,550
and there's no bull market like a

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,980
it seems it seems somehow wrong that

they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

as if they did not pay suitable penance

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,399
for their sins of the early and mid

the risk there well the risk is interest

can print it at negligible<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost right</font>

36
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,590
here at home air for why we ever default

37
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,689
and do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a reasonable</font>

41
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,509
the question is what will those dollars

42
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,899
by and who will accept them and it is

43
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,729
simply historically wrong to contend

44
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,110
that so many do that we've never default

45
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,220
it if you read the papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 1933 you</font>
