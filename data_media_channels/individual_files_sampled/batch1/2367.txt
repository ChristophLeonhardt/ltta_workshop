the last time we did that was the Vietnam era there's an argument to be made that mandatory service it kind of shares the burden it shares the load the downside to that is if you look at the impact that a mandatory draft had in Vietnam for example you certainly didn't have the unit cohesion that you see today there was a one-and-done kind of thing they would report for duty by themselves they would go home by themselves I think it creates a greater degree of isolationism when veterans transition looking at what our Vietnam veterans have gone through I get the merits of it I just don't know if America is ready for a draft again and frankly I don't necessarily think for this war that we're fighting that we need it I think what we need to do is put more specialized forces in these places rather than just conventional forces I think more SpecOps more advisors doing that kind of work
