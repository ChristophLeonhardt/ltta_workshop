♫ ♫

3
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:08,121
>> Juan: IF YOU’RE LOOKING TO

4
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:09,523
GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL TO

5
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:10,724
BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON, YOU

6
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:11,358
ARE IN LUCK.

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,793
THEY ARE ANNOUNCING THEY ARE

8
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:15,295
GOING ON A NORTH AMERICAN TOUR.

9
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:18,198
THEY WILL VISIT FOUR CITIES AND

10
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,101
NINE MORE IN 2019.

11
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:25,172
IT’S DUBBED AN EVENING WITH

12
00:00:25,173 --> 00:00:26,373
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND

13
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,007
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE

14
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:27,608
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.

15
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,109
DANA, ARE YOU BUYING A TICKET?

16
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,578
>> Dana: GOT TO GO TO BED

17
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,080
EARLY THAT NIGHT.

18
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,214
I THINK THESE WILL SELL OUT.

19
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:36,216
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO SEE

20
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:36,950
THEM.

21
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:39,586
SHE DID WIN THE POPULAR VOTE AND

22
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:41,121
HE IS POPULAR AMONGST PEOPLE.

23
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:43,357
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR BUBBLE AND GO

24
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:44,558
OUT IN THE COUNTRY, I’M ALL FOR

25
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,193
IT, IT’S A GREAT WAY FOR THEM TO

26
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:48,696
BE OUT AND ABOUT TOGETHER.

27
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:51,332
GREAT THING TO DO AS A COUPLE.

28
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,299
PETER AND I WILL BE COMING TO A

29
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,570
CITY NEAR YOU WITH THE DOG.

30
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:57,972
>> Juan: I THINK BILL CLINTON

31
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:02,176
HAS NOT BEEN HAVING A GOOD TIME.

32
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:03,411
THE ANTI-KAVANAUGH ADS, THEY’VE

33
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:04,712
GOT CLINTON IN THEM.

34
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:16,023
>> Jesse: IT’S A ME TOO

35
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:16,391
BOOMERANG.

36
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:17,125
HILLARY IS BRANDED AS A LOSER.

37
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:17,625
SHE LOST BIG TIME.

38
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:18,359
DEMOCRATS ARE KIND OF ANGRY AT

39
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,726
HER.

40
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:20,128
SHE WAS A TERRIBLE CANDIDATE.

41
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,297
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CLINTONS AND

42
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:26,801
THE OBAMAS, THE YOU HAD TO GO

43
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:27,468
FORMER PRESIDENTS AND FIRST

44
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,572
LADIES WHO ARE EXTREMELY

45
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:33,741
POLITICALLY ACTIVE.

46
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:34,342
EXTREMELY PARTISAN.

47
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,743
THEY ARE IN THE TRENCHES

48
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,979
THROWING HAND GRENADES AND IT

49
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,748
SUCKS UP A LOT OF OXYGEN.

50
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,283
IT MAKES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

51
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:46,121
LOOK LIKE THE PARTY OF THE PAST.

52
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:48,790
IT’S NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR THEM.

53
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,526
>> Juan: THERE IS A BROADWAY

54
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:54,596
PLAY COMING NEXT YEAR ABOUT THE

55
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:54,963
CLINTONS.

56
00:01:54,964 --> 00:02:00,135
>> Dagen: GOODY, GOODY.

57
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:02,471
I THINK BILL AND HILLARY’S

58
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:03,205
WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES THURSDAY.

59
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,907
THEY WILL HAVE BEEN MARRIED 43

60
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:05,207
YEARS.

61
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,642
I THINK SHE SHOULD GO ON THE

62
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:08,443
ROAD AND AT ONE OF THESE EVENTS

63
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:11,547
LET HIM HAVE IT.

64
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,882
LOSE HER MIND AND GO AFTER HIM

65
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,417
FOR EVERYTHING THAT HE DID.

66
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:18,120
>> Jesse: I WOULD BUY A TICKET

67
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:18,487
FOR THAT.

68
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:19,288
>> Dagen: THEY SHOULD PAY FOR

69
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:24,426
YOU TO DO THAT.

70
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:24,860
PAY-PER-VIEW.

71
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:28,130
GO AFTER HIM.

72
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,466
I PUT UP WITH ALL OF THIS, ALL

73
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,468
OF THE PHILANDERING ALL THESE

74
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:34,770
YEARS, AND I LOST TO THAT MAN?

75
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,539
PLEASE.

76
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,107
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

77
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:41,344
>> Juan: THAT MAN?

78
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:42,511
WHAT’S THAT LANGUAGE?

79
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:44,380
>> Greg: I HAVEN’T CHECKED BUT

80
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,482
I THINK THE CLINTON TOUR IS NOT

81
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,918
GOING TO WISCONSIN.

82
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,285
[LAUGHTER]

83
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,553
SHE IS THINKING AS SHE IS DURING

84
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:53,723
THE TOUR, IT WILL PAY FOR THE

85
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:54,457
RENOVATION AND THE SECOND HOUSE

86
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,325
AND HE IS THINKING HOW AM I

87
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:59,328
GOING TO SCORE GROUPIES WITH HER

88
00:02:59,329 --> 00:02:59,662
AROUND?

89
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,597
>> Jesse: HOW MUCH MONEY DO

90
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,565
THEY REALLY NEED?

91
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,667
>> Greg: HE IS ONLY GOING TO

92
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:07,804
THE STATES WHERE THERE IS A

93
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,272
HOOTERS AND A LOCAL BUT HAVE

94
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:13,710
REALLY FREQUENTED REST OUT.

95
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:14,844
>> Juan: MICHELLE OBAMA IS

96
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,446
ALSO GOING OUT ON HER TICKET

97
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,914
PRICES ARE EVEN HIGHER.

98
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,616
>> Dana: ONE ABOUT MOST

99
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,483
POPULAR PEOPLE IN AMERICA.

100
00:03:20,484 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Dagen: MUCH BIGGER VENUES.
