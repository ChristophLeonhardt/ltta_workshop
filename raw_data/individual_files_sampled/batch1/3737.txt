in the early 90s anthropologist Robin Dunbar proposed a human being has the capacity to have up to 150 meaningful relationships recently done by today's study of human interaction on Facebook and found that the number was way lower we only have like four real friends and 14 that care about us at all say what I'm not sure what losers Dunbar was studying but for the sake of this video I'll post something said on my wall fake of course because my life is great to see how many of my actual friends comment to see how I'm doing really sad got some terrible news today post yeah I'll check on that in a minute Dunbar surveyed over three thousand Facebook users with an average of you guessed it 150 friends on average they said they have only four people in their support clip those are people they depend on for emotional support and 14 in their sympathy group aka close friends all right well nothing yet but it is a workday and I don't think people really go on Facebook while they're at work so we'll give it some more time Dunbar said our support clique and emotional support groups don't get larger when we add more friends ok still nothing geez let me let me think here super sad really needs some comfort right now exclamation points that should that should do it so what does adding more Facebook friends yield Dunbar says only more loosely defined acquaintances he concluded that just like in real life Facebook won't increase your ability to maintain better relationships online social networks remain subject to the same cognitive demands of maintaining relationships that limit offline friendships yeah just take a look at my facebook while real quick yeah just take a look at me I don't tend to talk okay but Dunbar also said Facebook can slow down the decay of friendships if we don't actually see friends on the Reg they'll eventually fade away into that big sea of loosely defined acquaintances still nothing if I don't get attention on Facebook do I exist at all the takeaway here is simple technology can't give you more friends that you have to nurture offline something I'm gonna do from now on you
