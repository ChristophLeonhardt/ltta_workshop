1
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,233
You get into those situations
where you can't necessarily

2
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,272
use deadly force and you need
some kind of alternative.

3
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:38,528
And the dog plays that role and
he does it very well.

4
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,311
We can deploy that dog and
apprehend a suspect and give

5
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,515
that individual time to
surrender and it keeps

6
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,116
our team safe at the same time.

7
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,557
This exercise here is called the
crash intercept. All this is

8
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:57,590
This exercise here is called the
crash intercept all this is

9
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,759
intended to do is stop the
forward progression of a

10
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,661
possible assailant.
You can see some of

11
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,129
the recruits are standing in
front of badges or stars.

12
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:04,164
the recruits are standing in
front of badges or stars.

13
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,200
What they're trying to do is
prevent a person,

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,203
a possible attacker, from
touching that badge or star.

15
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,305
Just being that human
speed bump.

16
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,621
We're trying to teach the
recruits that you actually have

17
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:17,637
to address a problem, as
opposed to escape or evade

18
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:19,979
from a problem. You want
to engage that problem.

19
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,255
In order for them to graduate
they do have to pass our

20
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:41,451
physical standards.

21
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:50,620
The test is a combination of pushups, sit
ups, chin ups and a mile and a half run.

22
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,228
And it's just based on gender and
age how they need to perform.

23
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:57,008
And it's a point system
so they need to

24
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,046
achieve enough points
in order to graduate.

25
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,920
There's a bunch of things
we're looking for here.

26
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,860
Can they deliver that accurate
shot from a distance?

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,357
Are they aware of their backdrop?

28
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,627
Whether they're on a protective
assignment in L.A. with the

29
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:18,830
president or whether they work
in the White House, we want

30
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,621
to be cautious about our backdrops.

31
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:23,729
Once they get into a good position,
are they taking up cover?

32
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,511
Can they get to a position,

33
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:30,561
know what they have downrange and
then work around certain obstacles?

34
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,964
They're shooting. They're moving.
So there's a very dynamic course here.

35
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,877
What we're trying to teach
today is maneuvering,

36
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:44,931
precision and maneuvering curves.

37
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:50,532
Those individuals going through
that process are learning the techniques

38
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:54,749
that we want for our limo
drivers for the president

39
00:02:54,749 --> 00:00:00,000
and the vice president and
those operational details.
