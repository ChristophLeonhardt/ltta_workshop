1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:03,801
WASHINGTON, I AM LAURA INGRAHAM,

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:04,802
THIS IS "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE."

3
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:08,172
ORGANIZED HATRED IS THE FOCUS OF

4
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:11,542
TONIGHT'S ANGLE.

5
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:13,744
REMEMBER IN 2009 WHEN

6
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:14,545
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS SPEAKING AT

7
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:16,146
NOTRE DAME AND HE SAID THIS

8
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,749
ABOUT THE NEED FOR CIVIL

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,151
DISCOURSE?

10
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:22,986
>> AS CITIZENS OF A VIBRANT AND

11
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:26,256
VERY DEMOCRACY, HOW DO WE ENGAGE

12
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:29,760
IN VIGOROUS DEBATE?

13
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:31,595
HOW DOES EACH OF US REMAIN FIRM

14
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:39,970
WITHOUT, AS FATHER JOHN SAID IT,

15
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:42,773
DEMONIZING THOSE WITH JUST AS

16
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:44,141
STRONGLY HELD CONVICTIONS ON THE

17
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:44,741
OTHER SIDE.

18
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:46,143
>> Laura: WHAT A NICE

19
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:46,510
SENTIMENT.

20
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:48,545
BUT WHERE IS HE TONIGHT.

21
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:51,748
WHAT DOES HE SAY ABOUT THE

22
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:53,250
THREATS ABOUT AGAINST THE TRUMP

23
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:53,951
ADMINISTRATION?

24
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:54,885
SOMEHOW THE DEMOCRATS WENT FROM

25
00:00:54,886 --> 00:01:00,357
HOPE AND A CHANGE TO, NOPE, AND

26
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:00,724
DERANGED.

27
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:03,360
OVER THE WEEKEND TO COME UP THE

28
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:04,761
OWNER OF THE LEXINGTON VIRGINIA

29
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:07,764
EATERY, YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT

30
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:09,433
IT, CALLED THE RED HEN DID

31
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:11,368
SOMETHING PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

32
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,104
SHE ASKED HOW SPOKESPERSON SARAH

33
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:15,138
SANDERS TO LEAVE THE RESTAURANT

34
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,342
SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE WORKED FOR

35
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:19,343
TRUMP.

36
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:21,945
THE OWNER OF THE RED HEN TOLD

37
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:22,679
"THE WASHINGTON POST," I HAVE A

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,881
BUSINESS AND I WANT THE BUSINESS

39
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:24,715
TO THRIVE.

40
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:26,984
THIS FEELS LIKE THE MOMENT IN

41
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:28,652
OUR DEMOCRACY WHERE PEOPLE HAVE

42
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:29,353
TO MAKE UNCOMFORTABLE ACTIONS

43
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:31,622
AND DECISIONS TO UPHOLD THEIR

44
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:33,957
MORALS.

45
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,359
SO, MISS MORALITY AND WALKED

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,128
SARAH HUCKABEE OUTSIDE AND TOLD

47
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,366
HER THAT THE RED HEN HAS

48
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:43,100
"CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT I FEEL I

49
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:46,770
HAVE TO HOLD."

50
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,272
AND SHE INVITED HUCKABEE TO

51
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:50,407
LEAVE WHICH THE WHITE HOUSE

52
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:51,341
PRESS SECRETARY DID.

53
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:52,509
HUCKABEE RETURNED HOME WITH HER

54
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,977
HUSBAND FOR THE REST OF THE

55
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:55,379
FAMILY WENT TO ANOTHER

56
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,881
RESTAURANT ACROSS THE STREET.

57
00:01:57,882 --> 00:01:59,983
THAT DIDN'T STOP WILKINSON OR

58
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,952
HER CRUSADE TO DRIVE

59
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:03,153
CONSERVATIVES.

60
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:04,988
APPARENTLY FROM ESTABLISHMENTS,

61
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,990
EVEN ONES SHE DOESN'T RUN, IN

62
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,396
WAS ON MY RADIO SHOW TODAY.

63
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:13,864
>> THAT'S PART OF THAT STORY

64
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:14,631
THAT HASN'T BEEN TOLD AND YOU

65
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:17,401
WILL BE THE FIRST TO HEAR IT.

66
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:19,937
SARAH AND HER HUSBAND JUST WENT

67
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,338
HOME, THEY HAD SORT OF HAD

68
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:21,672
ENOUGH.

69
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:22,806
BUT THE REST OF HER FAMILY WENT

70
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,542
ACROSS THE STREET TO A DIFFERENT

71
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:25,943
RESTAURANT.

72
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:28,345
THE OWNER OF THE RED HEN,

73
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:30,747
BECAUSE NOBODY HAS TOLD THIS,

74
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,349
THEN FOLLOWED THEM ACROSS THE

75
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,951
STREET, CALLED PEOPLE AND

76
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:34,818
ORGANIZE A PROTEST, YELLING AND

77
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:38,855
SCREAMING OUTSIDE FROM OUTSIDE

78
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:40,557
OF THE OTHER RESTAURANT.

79
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:41,558
>> Laura: PUBLICLY SHAMING

80
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,492
CONSERVATIVES INTO TARGETING

81
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:43,560
THEM IN PUBLIC.

82
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,162
THAT'S BECOME THE NEW TACTIC OF

83
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:45,762
THE LEFT.

84
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:48,565
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MALIGN THEM

85
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:50,968
FOR THEIR BELIEF AND POSITION,

86
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,804
NOW THEY HAVE TO BE PUBLICLY

87
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:54,471
HUMILIATED, INCLUDING THEIR

88
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:58,208
FAMILIES AND, YOU BET, THEY ARE

89
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:04,381
ARE LIBERALS AND DON'T EVEN LIKE

90
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:04,681
TRUMP.

91
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:06,984
HOLLYWOOD IS GETTING IN ON THE

92
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:07,818
ACTION, TOO.

93
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,586
ACTOR SETH ROGEN BRAGGED ON TV

94
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:10,287
HOW HE RECENTLY EMBARRASSED

95
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:13,190
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN FRONT OF HIS

96
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:13,557
CHILDREN.

97
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:16,360
>> AND HE SAID TO COME, I HAVE A

98
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,566
STANDING RIGHT THERE,

99
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:23,967
EXPECTANTLY, CLEARLY FANS OF

100
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:28,572
MINE, AND I SAID, NO WAY, MAN!

101
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,607
AND I COULDN'T STOP.

102
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:31,441
AND I SAID FURTHERMORE, I HATE

103
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:35,612
COUNT THE DAYS UNTIL YOU KNOW

104
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:36,847
LONGER HAVE ONE IOTA OF THE

105
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,383
POWER THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE.

106
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,184
AND I LOOK OVER AND HIS KIDS ARE

107
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:45,589
STILL STANDING RIGHT THERE.

108
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,123
>> Laura: NICE GUY.

109
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:47,958
I ALWAYS GET THEM MIXED UP WITH

110
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,359
JONAH HILL FOR SOME REASON.

111
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,794
BUT IF I WERE SETH ROGEN, I

112
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,829
WOULD BE TRYING TO KEEP

113
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,965
EVERYTHING AND I COULD.

114
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:07,411
BONDI ATTENDED A SHOWING OF

115
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,612
MR. ROGERS, A DOCUMENTARY WHICH

116
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:10,814
IRONICALLY IS ALL ABOUT CIVILITY

117
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:11,948
AND KINDNESS.

118
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,484
APPARENTLY THE LEFT-WING MOB WHO

119
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:15,452
CONFRONTED AND AFFLICTED SPIT ON

120
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:16,820
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA

121
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:22,492
ABOUT YOU?

122
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:28,799
TAKING AWAY HEALTH INSURANCE?

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,737
SHAME ON YOU!

124
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:36,239
>> Laura: SO THAT'S THE VIDEO

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,608
OF BONDI LEAVING THE THEATER, SO

126
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:39,409
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED.

127
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,812
BUT AS SHE CAME IN, SHE AND HER

128
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:43,113
BOYFRIEND WERE VERBALLY

129
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:45,449
ASSAULTED AND PHYSICALLY

130
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,751
THREATENED IN THE CONCESSIONS

131
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:51,555
EVERY CURSE WORD IN THE BOOK AND

132
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:54,458
THEY SAID TO HIM, HEY BLUE EYES,

133
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,259
AREN'T YOU GOING TO PROTECT HER?

134
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,695
AND USING LOTS OF OTHER WORDS,

135
00:04:58,696 --> 00:04:58,962
TOO.

136
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,598
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

137
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,667
THEY ARE THIS FAR FROM MY FACE,

138
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,369
ONE SPIT ON MY HEAD, THEY WERE

139
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,504
TRYING TO CREATE A FIGHT.

140
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:10,207
>> Laura: YOU THAT THEY WERE.

141
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,942
IF THIS CONTINUES, SOMEONE IS

142
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:15,412
GOING TO GET HURT.

143
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,615
IMAGINE A A FEW YEARS AGO, OBAMA

144
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:20,350
OFFICIALS WHO WERE HARASSED AND

145
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:21,985
VERBALLY ASSAULTED IN THAT WAY?

146
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:23,754
THERE WOULD BE CAUSE FOR THE

147
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,456
NATIONAL GUARD TO STEP IN.

148
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:28,759
BUT SINCE CONSERVATIVES ARE

149
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,594
TARGETED, ALL BETS ARE OFF AND

150
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,596
ALL STANDARDS OUT THE WINDOW.

151
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,231
THIS IS ALL EVOLVING INTO A TYPE

152
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:35,632
OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND IT'S

153
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,935
ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

154
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:43,540
RESTAURANT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

155
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:48,178
LAST WEEK BY ANGRY PROTESTERS.

156
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,551
PROTESTERS ARE STAKED OUTSIDE OF

157
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,186
HIS APARTMENT BUILDING.

158
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:58,388
THEY EVEN STAGED A PROTEST

159
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,790
OUTSIDE OF NIELSEN'S HOME,

160
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,958
BLARING AUDIO OF THIS CHILD

161
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,928
SEPARATION AT A BORDER FACILITY.

162
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,631
THESE ARE ANARCHIC, ORGANIZED

163
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,371
EACH FLASH PROTEST IS PLANNED

164
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,173
OUT AND CHOREOGRAPHED.

165
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,208
ITS PLANNED ONLINE FIRST, AGAIN,

166
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,377
AND IT'S MEANT TO SHAME THE

167
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:21,711
POLITICAL OPPONENT TO STOKE

168
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:24,614
VIOLENCE AND HATRED.

169
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:26,683
AND MAYBE EVEN INTIMIDATE PEOPLE

170
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:28,752
IN THE FUTURE FROM GETTING

171
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:29,386
INVOLVED IN THE TRUMP

172
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:29,986
ADMINISTRATION AT ALL.

173
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:34,157
THEN AT A WEEKEND RALLY, THIS IS

174
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:34,958
THE BEST.

175
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,992
CONGRESSMAN MAXINE WATERS ISSUED

176
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:39,162
HER OWN VERY SOFT CALL TO ACTION

177
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:39,763
HER OWN VERY SOFT CALL TO ACTIO

178
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:42,232
ACTION.

179
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,200
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE PUT

180
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,601
UP WITH THIS PRESIDENT LONG

181
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,838
ENOUGH.

182
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,973
WHAT MORE LIES DO WE NEED TO

183
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:50,473
HEAR?

184
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:53,810
DO YOU SEE ANYBODY FROM THAT

185
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,378
CABINET IN A RESTAURANT, IN A

186
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,582
DEPARTMENT STORE, IN A GASOLINE

187
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,783
STATION, YOU GET OUT AND YOU

188
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:03,553
GATHER A CROWD.

189
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:05,355
AND YOU PUSH BACK ON THEM.

190
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:07,757
>> Laura: WILL TALK ABOUT THAT

191
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:10,360
PHRASE, PUSH BACK ON THEM, AND

192
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,162
JUST A MOMENT.

193
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:13,797
WE INVITED MS. WATERS AND A

194
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:15,632
NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS TO APPEAR

195
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:18,368
TONIGHT, NO SURPRISE, THEY ALL

196
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:18,768
REFUSED.

197
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,137
SHE DID FIND TIME TO GO ON MSNBC

198
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:22,639
TONIGHT AND SUNDAY TO SHARE THIS

199
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,975
UNIFYING MESSAGE.

200
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:33,550
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

201
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:36,853
STOP AT A GAS STATION.

202
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:39,389
IT WON'T BE ABLE TO SHOP AT A

203
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,890
DEPARTMENT STORE.

204
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,791
THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TURN ON

205
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,994
THEM, THEY ARE GOING TO PROTEST.

206
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:46,196
THEY WILL ABSOLUTELY HARASS THEM

207
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:46,997
UNTIL THEY DECIDE THAT THEY ARE

208
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:50,467
GOING TO TELL THE PRESIDENT,

209
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,242
APPROACH THEM, DRIVE THEM OUT,

210
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:02,979
PUSH THEM BACK.

211
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,882
SO IS MAXINE WATERS PUSHING

212
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:07,751
VIOLENCE USING HER POSITION?

213
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:09,252
PAUL RYAN STOOD AT THE VERY

214
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:14,791
THINK THEY SHOULD MOVE TO

215
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:15,959
CENSURE HER.

216
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,763
SHE SEEMS TO BE USING HER OFFICE

217
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:21,564
TO JUSTIFY ACTS OF HARASSMENT,

218
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,366
INTIMIDATION, THAT COULD VERY

219
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:27,971
THE WHITE HOUSE TO SEE PELOSI

220
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:30,373
FORCED WATERS TO THE MICROPHONE

221
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,948
NONAPOLOGY DOUBLE-TALK 48 HOURS

222
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:38,547
AFTER HER INCENDIARY AND

223
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,218
OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS THAT SHE

224
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:42,986
REPEATED YESTERDAY ARE

225
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:46,957
SUFFICIENT TO CALL WHILE THE

226
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,691
FIRESTORM, SHE HAS ANOTHER THING

227
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:53,129
STATEMENT, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE,

228
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:59,569
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

229
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,205
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CIVILITY

230
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:04,341
BUT PROTEST IS STABILITY.

231
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,376
>> Laura: DRY THEM OUT, HARASS

232
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:09,646
ALL THINGS THAT PEOPLE TOOK AWAY

233
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:12,215
FROM WHAT SHE SAID IN HER VERY

234
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:12,782
WORDS.

235
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:13,984
SO THREATENING WOMEN AND

236
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:17,687
CHILDREN AT A DINNER, AT THE

237
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:18,455
MOVIES, IS CIVIL?

238
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:19,956
NO WONDER SHE'S TOO AFRAID TO

239
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:20,457
COME ON.

240
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,994
SHE WILL ONLY GO TO THE SOFTBALL

241
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:24,794
INTERVIEWS ON MSNBC.

242
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:27,797
MAYBE SHE SHOULD COME ON A SHOW

243
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:28,798
SHE CAN'T INTIMIDATE.

244
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,737
NOT APOLOGIZE FOR HER COMMENTS

245
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,405
IN THE LEAST.

246
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,707
THE WOMAN HAS BEEN SAYING CRAZY

247
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,276
HATEFUL IN INCENDIARY THINGS FOR

248
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:40,643
YEARS.

249
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:43,847
THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS THE ENTIRE

250
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:47,317
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS DRIFTED

251
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:48,685
INTO MAXINE LAND.

252
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,253
>> AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE

253
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:51,421
TEA PARTY CAN GO STRAIGHT TO

254
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:52,355
HELL.

255
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:53,556
I DON'T HONOR HIM, I DON'T

256
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:55,392
RESPECT HIM AND I DON'T WANT TO

257
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:56,393
BE INVOLVED.

258
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:57,627
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAD BETTER

259
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,796
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.

260
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:03,500
THIS IS A BUNCH OF SCUMBAGS.

261
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:13,510
LET'S IMPEACH 45!

262
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:14,244
IMPEACH 45!

263
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:17,580
>> Laura: THE LEFT WANTS TO

264
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:19,749
CRY TARGETING PEOPLE, AND

265
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,151
BECAUSE CONSERVATIVES ARE THE

266
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,624
SINCE THEY BELIEVED TRUMP'S

267
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:33,596
POLICIES ARE DETESTABLE, OR

268
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:43,840
SORRY,-LIKE, THEY BLAME TRUMP OF

269
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:44,841
COURSE.

270
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:49,479
>> SHOULD SOMEONE BE OPENLY

271
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,381
WELCOMED IN SOCIETY WHEREVER

272
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:52,348
THEY PLEASE?

273
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:53,716
I WOULD SAY THE POLITE DISCOURSE

274
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,985
IS INAPPROPRIATE WHEN THERE ARE

275
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:56,453
BABIES IN CAGES.

276
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:57,620
DOES THAT MEAN WE WILL BE

277
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:59,189
VIOLENT, NO.

278
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:03,560
DINNER WITH HER FAMILY WHEN

279
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:06,362
SHE'S TAKING OUR TAX DOLLARS TO

280
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:08,198
IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY?

281
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:08,998
I DON'T THINK SO.

282
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,800
>> IT WASN'T UNTIL WE HAD

283
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:13,369
3-YEAR-OLDS IN CAGES THAT THESE

284
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,874
PEOPLE COULDN'T GO INTO PUBLIC.

285
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,375
>> OF COURSE IT'S FORCED ON

286
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,578
EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE AND IS

287
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,847
MUCH WORSE AND MUCH HARDER TO DO

288
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,949
ANYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY.

289
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,984
>> Laura: SPARE MEAN.

290
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,586
FOR DECADES, HOLLYWOOD AND THE

291
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,321
LEFT HAVE DRIVEN ANY SEMBLANCE

292
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,389
OF DECENCY AND CIVILITY FROM THE

293
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,190
MOVIE HOUSE AS WELL AS THE

294
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:35,458
LECTURE HALL.

295
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:36,793
THEY HAVE CHEAPENED EVERYTHING

296
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:37,994
FROM MUSIC TO FASHIONS, BUT

297
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:40,597
TRUMP IS TO BLAME FOR THE

298
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:42,198
VULGARITY OF THE CULTURE?

299
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:42,999
NICE TRY.

300
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,170
CONVERSATION, DEBATE, IDEAS.

301
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:49,339
THE LEFT HAS CREATED A POLITICAL

302
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,343
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION

303
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:53,376
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     D

304
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:53,409
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     M

305
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:53,443
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     N

306
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:53,476
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     Z

307
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:53,510
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     T

308
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:53,543
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     O

00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:53,610
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     N

00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:53,643
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     O

311
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:53,943
CULTURE WHERE DENOMINATION     F

312
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,245
OPPONENTS AND BOYCOTTS ARE

313
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:55,612
ROUTINE.

314
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:57,347
IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM IN A

315
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,582
DEBATE, TRY TO SHUT THEM DOWN

316
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,750
ALTOGETHER.

317
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:01,384
ORGANIZED CHAOS IS THEIR

318
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,987
FAVORITE TOOL.

319
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:06,222
BUT THE IDEA IS NOT TO COME TO

320
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:07,824
SOME COMMON UNDERSTANDING OR

321
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:10,326
EVEN WIN AN ARGUMENT OF COURSE,

322
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:10,960
BUT TO DESTROY POLITICAL

323
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,997
OPPONENTS.

324
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:16,766
AND YOU BET, AND ATTEMPT TO

325
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,600
SILENCE THEM.

326
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:19,202
WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE URGING

327
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,771
UPRISINGS ONLINE TO DENY

328
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,840
REPUBLICAN WOMEN SAFE HAVENS,

329
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,910
PEAS, JUST HAVING DINNER IN

330
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:30,680
FAMILY?

331
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:34,717
THEY WON'T ALLOW THAT, SOMETHING

332
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:35,185
IS DEEPLY WRONG.

333
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:38,888
NOW IS THE MOMENT FOR ALL PEOPLE

334
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,857
RIGHT AND LEFT TO CONDEMN THAT

335
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:43,693
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND THOSE

336
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:44,594
ADVOCATING IT.

337
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:45,361
THREATENING, YELLOW AND DELICATE

338
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:47,997
YELLING AND HARANGUING OFFICIALS

339
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:49,399
AND PUBLIC WON'T CREATE POSITIVE

340
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,833
OUTCOMES OR A BETTER POLICY.

341
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,770
EVEN CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THAT

342
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:54,304
TODAY, GOOD FOR HIM.

343
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:55,505
IT WILL ONLY HARDEN THE

344
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,840
POLITICAL DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY

345
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,809
AND PERHAPS LEAD TO VIOLENCE.

346
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,878
AND ANY BLOOD SPILLED, WHAT

347
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,613
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED A YEAR

348
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:05,782
AGO TO STEVE SCULLY'S, ANY BLOOD

349
00:13:12,823 --> 00:00:00,000
NEVER TRUMP FIRST, CONDONING.
