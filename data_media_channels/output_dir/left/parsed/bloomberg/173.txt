 WHEN YOU
ARE TRYING TO CREATE SOMETHING
NEW?
>> IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO
ENVISION THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY
THAN IT IS TODAY.
YOU HAVE THIS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE
OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
HALLUCINATION AND A VISION IS
THE OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE THE
VISION.
YOU FIND YOURSELF OUT THERE WITH
THE HALLUCINATION.
YOU GET A CHANCE WITH A CLEAN
SHEET OF A VIRTUE IMAGINE THE
WORLD IN A DIFFERENT STATE.
WHAT A LOT OF THE GREAT ROUNDERS
HAVE IN COMMON IS THEY HAVE
DEVELOPED WHAT THE WORLD TO BE
LIKE AND I GET SO INTENSE ABOUT
THAT THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
EVERYBODY DOESN'T GET IT.
THEY DEVELOP A VIEW OF WHAT THE
WORLD SHOULD BE LIKE AND IF THEY
SEE IT, THEY SEE IT
COMPREHENSIVELY.
THE GOOD ONES BUILD UP A BATTLE
PLAN TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A
COMPANY AROUND THAT IDEA AND
THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF THE
VALLEY HASN'T CHANGED.
WHAT'S THE GREAT EXECUTIVES AND
ENGINEERS AND BE ABLE TO
CATALYZE SOMETHING.
IT IS ALMOST NEVER ONE PERSON
AND IT'S ALMOST NEVER THE
FOUNDERS.
IT'S THE FIRST 20 PEOPLE AND
THEN THE FIRST THOUSAND PEOPLE
WHO BUILT IT.
THE TEAM EITHER GELS OR IT
DOESN'T.
BUT WHEN IT DOES, MAGICAL THINGS
HAPPEN.
EMILY: TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED OR
MEDICALLY.
HAVE YOU MATURED AND CHANGED
WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR APPROACH?
MARK: I THINK THE LEVEL OF
EFFORT REQUIRED TO KEEP AN OPEN
MIND EPES GETTING HIGHER AND
HIGHER.
THERE IS THIS THING CALLED THE
EVENT HORIZON.
THAT'S THE POINT OF A BLACK HOLE
WHERE YOU CAN'T GET OUT AGAIN
FOR TOP WE ALL HAVE A PERSONAL
EVENT HORIZON AND BECOME
REACTIONARY AND REACH A POINT
WHERE IT'S LIKE YOU HAD ME WITH
THE PC, I GOT THE SMARTPHONE, I
GOT THE ICE OWN, I GOT A'S BOOK,
BUT THE SNAP CHAT THING IS JUST
TOO FAR.
I DON'T GET IT COME I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT AND THOSE CRAZY
KIDS AND IT'S STUPID AND WHAT
ARE PEOPLE THINKING?
SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS
NEW.
AND, BY THE WAY, ALL OF US --
THIS IS A VERY OPEN CONVERSATION
BECAUSE WE ALL DO IT.
YOU CAN SEE IT AND YOU CAN SEE
IT IN THE BODY LANGUAGE.
IT'S LIKE YOU ARE GOING DOWN.
YOU HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELF.
YOU HAVE TO METHODICALLY FORCE
YOURSELF NOT TO CLOSE DOWN AND
IT IS SO HARD, ESPECIALLY HARD
WHEN YOU THINK VCS DON'T HAVE
THESE PROBLEMS.
BUT THE THING IS, WE FUND ONE IN
100 OF THE NEW IDEAS THAT WE SEE
THAT ARE LEGITIMATE QUALIFIED
THINGS WILL STOP 99 OUT OF 100
TIMES, WE SAY NO.
THE LEVEL OF CYNICISM YOU CAN
BUILD UP WHEN YOU SAY NO ALL THE
TIME CREATES A MENTAL FOG OF
NEGATIVITY AND WHEN ONE DOES
WALK IN, YOU HAVE TO SAY OK,
THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE
THING.
AND THEY COME OUT OF LEFT FIELD.
EVERYONE AFTER-THE-FACT NEW
AIRBNB WAS GOING TO BE HUGE, BUT
AT THE TIME, FOR EVERY BIG
THING, MANY EXPERTS ARE ON
RECORD SAYING THAT STUPID, SO
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY UP AGAINST
THIS WALL AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP
TRYING TO PUNCH THROUGH IT.
EMILY: YOU SCALED UP THE FIRM.
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE WALLY
BARR OF YOUR INVESTMENT?
MARK: ONE IS ABSOLUTE -- YOU
SPEND ALL DAY LONG TRYING TO
WORK INTERNALLY WITH THE FIRM
AND THE FOUNDERS TRYING TO BACK
THE HIGHEST QUALITY TEAMS THAT
YOU CAN GET BETTER.
PROBABLY THE THING THAT HELPS IS
YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON A RELATIVE
BASIS.
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES YOU HAVE
IS YOU GET TO SEE MANY TEAMS
GOING AFTER THE SAME THING AND
YOU GET TO DO THIS CROSS
COMPARISON AND WORLD CLASS IS
ALMOST NEVER EVERYTHING IN ONE
COMPANY.
THIS COMPANY IS GREAT AT SALES,
THIS COMPANY IS GREAT AT
MARKETING AND THEN YOU SPEND
TIME CONVINCING EACH OF THEM
THEY CAN LEARN FROM THE OTHERS.
AND THERE IS A THING WHERE THE
STRONGEST FOUNDERS ARE LEAST
INTERESTED IN INPUT, SO WHEN YOU
TELL THEM YOU ARE TERRIBLE AT
MARKETING AND THERE'S ANOTHER
COMPANY YOU SHOULD LEARN FROM
AND THEN THEY SAY THAT OTHER
COMPANIES. X SUCK AND YOU SAY
YES, THAT'S WHY THEY ARE GOOD AT
MARKETING.
IT IS JUST CAJOLING PEOPLE INTO
LEARNING.
THE ROLE MODELS ARE THERE.
THIS INDUSTRY HAS A HUGE NUMBER
OF SPECTACULAR PEOPLE.
YOU GET VERY SPREAD OUT BUT THEY
ARE OUT THERE AND YOU CAN LEARN
FROM WHAT THEY DO.
EMILY: WHAT ARE SOME INVESTORS
YOU HAVE MADE THAT WILL PROVE
OTHER VCS WRONG?
MARK: SILENT AS THE ONE I CAN'T
STOP TALKING ABOUT STOP EMILY:
WE HAVE THEM REPRESENTED AT OUR
EVENING EVENT AND THERE WAS SOME
GET THIS IS HIM.
MARK: SILENT DRIVES PEOPLE
CRAZY.
YOU CAN GET UPSET ABOUT THEM --
IT'S LIKE THE RORSCHACH TECH --
RORSCHACH TEST FOR GETTING
UPSET.
YOU CAN SAY WHY DOES IT HAVE
DIFFERENT FLAVORS, WHY OR LIKE
THE NEW YORK TIMES DID, YOU CAN
ASK THE SOMALIA AT THE FRENCH
RESTAURANT -- IT WAS A BARELY A
HARD ONE TO PREDICT.
IS YOU COME FACE TO FACE AND
HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM,
IT'S AN AMAZING AND MAGICAL
THING AND THE SCOPE AND VISION
IS GIGANTIC.
IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
COMPANY DOING FUNDAMENTAL WORK,
SO THAT'S REALLY FUN.
EMILY: WHEN IT COMES TO AI, VR,
DRONES, WHICH SECTOR IS THE MOST
POTENTIAL FOR TRULY DISRUPTIVE
INNOVATION?
MARK: THE TWO THAT ARE MOVING
THE FASTEST WITH THE SURE
VELOCITY ARE A ALIVE AND BIOTECH
.
THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING AT THE
INTERSECTION OF AI AND BIOTECH.
THERE'S JUST BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL
TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN
THE LAST YEARS WITH DEEP
LEARNING AND THE RISE OF
SUPERFAST, SUPER CHEAP SHIPS AND
THESE DATA SETS.
PRODUCTS ARE BECOMING POSSIBLE
THAT WERE JUST NOT POSSIBLE FIVE
YEARS AGO.
THE SCIENCE THERE IS MOVING VERY
FAST AND THERE IS THIS
INCREDIBLE FEEDBACK LOOP BETWEEN
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND ITS
MOVING INCREDIBLY FAST AND IS
VERY EXCITING STOP THE OTHER IS
BIOTECH, IT'S LESS A SINGLE
THING.
IT'S MORE A RESULT OF THE
CONVERGENCE OF BIOLOGICAL
SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.
THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPING FOR A
DECADE BUT IS REALLY STARTING TO
PAY OFF NOW.
YOU HAVE A NEW GENERATION OF
NEWLY MINTED PHD GRADUATES WHO
ARE ALSO COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND
YOU HAVE NEW SCIENCES LIKE
GENOMICS AND THE STUDIES OF THE
BIOME AND ALL OF THESE BIG DATA
SETS YOU ARE ABLE TO GATHER.
THE INTERSECTION OF GIANT -- OF
BIOLOGY AND COMPUTER SCIENCE IS
A MAGICAL PLACE.
WE HAVE THIS BIO 2.0 FUND AND
ALL OF OUR FIRST FOUR
INVESTMENTS HAVE DEEP LEARNING
AND AI AT THE CORE OF WHAT THEY
DO AND IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER
AT THE SAME TIME.
EMILY: HOW IS APPLE DOING ON AI
WITH RESPECT TO AMAZON AND
GOOGLE.
MARK: I HAVE TO TAKE FACEBOOK
OFF THE TABLE.
BUT I THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT OF
THE BIG COMPANIES, AMAZON HAS
LAPPED EVERYBODY AT LEAST THIS
YEAR AND THIS ACT OF AND ALEXA
ARE FUNDAMENTAL BREAKTHROUGHS.
IT IS FAIRLY SHOCKING EVEN FOR
PEOPLE IN THE FIELD HOW WELL
THEY ARE DOING AND THE CONSUMER
RESPONSE TO GO FROM PEOPLE WHO
ARE NOT US IS REALLY
SPECTACULAR.
I THINK AMAZON HAS SET A NEW
BENCHMARK FOR WHAT IT MEANS TO
HAVE AN INNER ACTIVE AI STOP THE
OTHER BIG COMPANIES REALIZE THAT
IN THERE'S GOING TO BE A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF CATCH UP HAPPENING
STOP THE BIG THING IN THE AI
WORLD PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
IS OF THE BIG COMPANIES, APPLE
IS THE ONE WHO HAS DECLARED THIS
IDEOLOGICAL DECISION OF NOT
COLLECTING CENTRALIZED DATA, SO
THE OTHER BIG COMPANIES ARE
BUILDING THESE GIANT DATABASES
AND APPLE HAS DECLARED THEY
WON'T DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE
THIS PRIVACY POSITION THEY HAVE
TAKEN.
THEY HAVE THIS NEW APPROACH THAT
THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS WEEK AND
IT LOOKS PROMISING, BUT THE
QUESTION THE INDUSTRY'S WILL
THAT BE ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH
THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT GOOGLE
OR AMAZON IS MAKING WITH THE
LEVEL OF DATA ACCESS THEY HAVE.
AMONG THE GUERRILLAS, THAT'S THE
BIG QUESTION.
ONE OF THE REASONS I'M EXCITED
ABOUT IS IF YOU HAD ASKED ME A
YEAR AGO IS AI GOING TO BE
SOMETHING BIG COMPANIES ARE
STARTUPS DO, I WOULD PROBABLY
SAY BIG COMPANIES BECAUSE THEIR
VIEW WAS THERE WAS ONLY A SMALL
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND
AI SYSTEMS AND THEN YOU NEED
THESE GIANT DATA SETS THAT ONLY
THE BIG COMPANIES HAVE ACCESS
TO.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST
SIX MONTHS IS A LUNCH OF NEW
STARTUPS WHERE IT IS ONE WHERE
TWO OR THREE EXPERTS, MANY OF
WHOM ARE COMING OUT OF THE BIG
COMPANIES AND MAY HAVE EITHER
FIGURED OUT A WAY TO GET ACCESS
TO DATA OR FIGURED OUT A WAY TO
DO ADVANCED AI ON THE DATA SETS.
EMILY: YOU MENTION THERE'S GOING
TO BE A LOT MORE AND A DAY.
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING COMPANIES
ACED ON THE OVERALL ENVIRONMENT?
THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT YOU
ARE COUNSELING COMPANIES NOT TO
GO PUBLIC STOP MARK: IT'S HARDER
TO BE A PUBLIC COMPANY TODAY
THAN IT USED TO BE.
I HAVE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT
THIS.
IT'S HARDER TO BE PUBLIC AND IT
IS HARDER TO GO PUBLIC AND
OBSERVATIONALLY, THERE'S A LOT
MORE THAN THERE USED TO BE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE BELIEVE
THE PENDULUM HAS PROBABLY SWUNG
TOO FAR IN AGAINST GOING PUBLIC
AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AND SO
WE'VE CREATED A TEAM IN OUR FIRM
FOCUSED ON IPO PREPAREDNESS.
WHAT IS THE PROCESS TO GET READY
TO GO PUBLIC?
WHAT IS REQUIRED TO GO PUBLIC?
IT'S BUILDING A BOARD OF
DIRECTORS, YOUR EXECUTIVE TEAM
AND ALL THESE THINGS YOU HAVE TO
DO TO GO PUBLIC WILL STOP EMILY:
YOU ARE COUNSELING THEM ON IPO
READINESS?
MARK: THEN THEY HAVE THE
DECISION.
IF YOU GET READY TO GO PUBLIC,
IT BECOMES AN OBVIOUS THING IF
YOU WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
IT.
BUT THE COMPANIES THAT DO THIS
AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BECOME
BETTER EVEN IF THEY DON'T GO
PUBLIC AND BECOME BETTER AS
STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES AND
BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE AS
ACQUISITIONS.
THAT'S A PROCESS OF MATURATION A
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE GOING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.
AND -- 
SCARLET: YOU ARE WATCHING
"WHAT'D YOU MISS?"
FOR EQUITY INVESTORS COME A BIG
DECISION IS COMING DOWN IN THE
NEXT HOUR.
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY HERE AT
STAKE.
HSB SAYS $30 BILLION OF INFLOWS
COULD COME IN.
JOE: CHINA HAS IN TRYING TO GET
EQUITIES INVOLVED IN THIS.
THERE IS A HUGE DECISION COMING
UP.
SCARLET: IT'S DOWN TO 154
BILLION, DOWN 84% FROM THE PEAK
OF LAST YEAR.
A GREAT BALL OF MONEY MOVING
FROM IRON ORE TO HOUSING.
JOE: I'M LOOKING AT A CHART THAT
LOOKS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO YOUR
CHART, BUT THIS IS A CHART OF
OUTSTANDING MARGIN DEBT AND YOU
CAN SEE HOW SIMILAR IT IS.
THAT SPEAKS TO THIS BIG BALL OF
MONEY IDEA AND TO HOW MUCH THIS
MARKET DEPENDS ON PEOPLE
LEVERAGING INTO AND SPECULATING
ON IT WILL STOP LAST WEEK, THERE
WAS THIS WEEK IN THE MARGIN DEBT
AND THAT HAS COME DOWN A LOT.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO THEY DO
TODAY AND HOW MUCH MONEY DOES
THAT INSTANTLY BRING INTO THE
MARKET THANKS TO PASSIVE
INVESTORS FORCED TO TRACK THE
INDEX?
SCARLET: COMING UP, AMERICAN
CONSUMERS WENT ON A SHOPPING
SPREE WITH RETAIL SALES CLOSING
WITH THEIR BEST BACK-TO-BACK
GAIN SINCE 2014.
WE DISCUSS WHAT THAT MEANS TO
THE FED.
AND JUST A REMINDER THAT IF YOU
WANT TO WATCH THE REST OF EMILY
CHANG'S CONVERSATION WITH MARK
ANDREESSEN, YOU CAN GO TO LIVE
GO.
