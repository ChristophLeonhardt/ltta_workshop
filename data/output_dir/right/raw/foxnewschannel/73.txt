OF THE REGISTERED VOTERS

00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:18,273

THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS

MORNING.

15
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:31,286
WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE RISE

16
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:33,187
IN THE PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL

17
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:33,488
RATING

18
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:35,790
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

19
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,759
LOOKING WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,260
OUR ECONOMY.

21
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:39,761
3.7 UNEMPLOYMENT.

22
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:41,162
THE LOWEST SINCE WE PUT A MAN

23
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,096
ON THE MOON.

24
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,264
MORE JOBS OPEN THAN PEOPLE TO

25
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:43,965
FILL THEM.

26
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:44,666
WAGES ARE UP.

27
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,401
PEOPLE ARE DOING BETTER UNDER

28
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:47,468
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT'S

29
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,370
SHOWING IN THESE POLL NUMBERS.

30
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:50,638
HIS APPROVAL IS GOING UP

31
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,907
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR LIVES

32
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:53,875
ARE BETTER AND THEY ARE PROUD

33
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:55,643
OF THE JOB HE IS DOING.

34
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:57,679
>> Sandra: AS FAR AS THE

35
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,681
ENTHUSIASM GOES, THAT SEEMS TO

36
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:01,316
BE THE POPULAR WORD RIGHT NOW.

37
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:02,517
WE'RE TRYING TO SEE WHAT RIGHT

38
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:04,352
NOW ARE GOING TO BE THE BIG

39
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:07,021
ISSUES TO DRIVE VOTERS OUT TO

40
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:07,488
THE POLLS.

41
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,891
ARE YOU THINKING THAT AS WE

42
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:11,292
WATCH THIS CARAVAN MAKE ITS WAY

43
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:12,927
THROUGH MEXICO, WILL IT BE A

44
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:15,029
WINNING ISSUE FOR YOUR PARTY?

45
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,664
>> I DO THINK IT'S A WINNING

46
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,333
ISSUE AND THE PRESIDENT IS

47
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:20,168
HANDLING IT PERFECTLY TO SAY TO

48
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:21,836
THESE COUNTRIES PLEASE DON'T

49
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,237
SEND YOUR MIGRANTS HERE.

50
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:24,872
WE'RE GIVING YOU FOREIGN AID.

51
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:26,741
IF YOU'LL DO THIS WE'LL CUT

52
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:27,208
FOREIGN AID.

53
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,876
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS INFLUX OF

54
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:30,979
5,000 PEOPLE INTO OUR COUNTRY.

55
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,980
WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY BUT WE

56
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:33,715
HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE

57
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:35,616
WHO PAY TAXES, WE HAVE TO DO

58
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:38,252
THIS IN A SAFE WAY FOR AMERICAN

59
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:40,521
CITIZENS AND I THINK THE

60
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:41,389
PRESIDENT IS BEING TOUGH ON

61
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,491
THIS AND I THINK IT ALSO

62
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:45,393
HIGHLIGHTS DEMOCRATS AND SOME

63
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:47,962
OF THEIR VERY EXTREME STANCES

64
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:49,130
RIGHT NOW, ABOLISH ICE, OPEN

65
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:49,464
BORDERS.

66
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:50,765
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR OUR

67
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:51,232
COUNTRY?

68
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,800
WE NEED TO HAVE BORDERS.

69
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,268
WE'RE A SOVEREIGN NATION.

70
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,170
THIS IN THE LONG TERM I THINK

71
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,805
HELP US IN THESE ELECTIONS.

72
00:01:57,806 --> 00:02:00,408
>> Sandra: ALSO THE LATEST IN

73
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,609
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL

74
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,211
TALKING ABOUT CONTROL OF

75
00:02:03,212 --> 00:02:03,711
CONGRESS.

76
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:06,748
THOSE THAT PREFER DEMOCRATS IN

77
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:08,116
CONTROL 50%.

78
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:09,049
AND REPUBLICANS 41%.

79
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,787
I SAY THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF

80
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:13,688
THE PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL

81
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:14,922
RATING RISING BUT WHAT DO YOU

82
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:17,058
MAKE OF THAT?

83
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:18,026
>> WELL, HISTORICALLY THE PARTY

84
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:20,595
THAT HOLDS THE WHITE HOUSE

85
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:21,529
USUALLY LOSES SEATS IN CONGRESS

86
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,698
AND THE HOUSE SPECIFICALLY THAT

87
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:24,432
FIRST MID-TERM.

88
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,067
ALSO IN THE SENATE AS WELL.

89
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:27,468
THE SENATE WE'RE LOOKING AT

90
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:28,669
PICKING UP SEATS.

91
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,071
THE NUMBERS ARE LOOKING BETTER

92
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:30,471
AND BETTER.

93
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,607
AS WE PUT THE PRESIDENT ON THE

94
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,475
CAMPAIGN TRAIL WE'RE RAMPING UP

95
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:37,045
OUR ENTHUSIASM AND HE IS MAKING

96
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:38,246
THE CASE TO REPUBLICAN VOTERS.

97
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:39,647
ALL THE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING

98
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:41,282
IN YOUR LIVES, THE HIGHER WAGES

99
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:42,784
AND JOBS COMING BACK WON'T BE

100
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:44,318
HERE IF DEMOCRATS TAKE THE

101
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:44,619
HOUSE.

102
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,953
THEY'LL SHUT IT ALL DOWN.

103
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:48,556
THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES AND

104
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:49,957
ABOLISH ICE AND OPEN BORDERS.

105
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,592
THE CONTRAST HE IS MAKING IS

106
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:51,959
CRITICAL.

107
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,961
IT HELPS RAMP UP OUR ENTHUSIASM

108
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:55,196
AND TURN OUT OUR VOTES WHICH IS

109
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:59,901
WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO WIN.

110
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:01,969
>> Sandra: NEARLY 2/3 OF

111
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,804
REGISTERED VOTERS SHOW AN

112
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:04,806
INTEREST IN THE ELECTION.

113
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:07,875
THE HIGHEST EVER REPORTED IN A

114
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:09,043
MID-TERM ELECTION SINCE THE

115
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,478
POLL ASKED THE QUESTION IN 2006.

116
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,346
HOW DO YOU WIN ON THAT?

117
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:14,449
>> WE SAW IN THE SPECIALS THAT

118
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,319
THE DEMOCRATS HAD A HUGE

119
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,321
ENTHUSIASM EDGE AS WE HAD THE

120
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:20,822
SPECIAL ELECTIONS.

121
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:22,690
REPUBLICANS ARE MATCHING THAT

122
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,558
WITH THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS,

123
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,960
SEEING WHAT'S AT STAKE.

124
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,595
RECOGNIZING IF PELOSI TAKES THE

125
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:29,230
LEADERSHIP WHAT IT WOULD MEAN

126
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:29,831
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

127
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,532
WE'RE MATCHING THE DEMOCRATS.

128
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,901
IT WILL BE CLOSE TO A

129
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,069
PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL TURNOUT IN

130
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,503
SOME STATES.

131
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:41,142
IT  IS INTERESTING SEEING THE

132
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,543
COMPARISONS TO 2014.

133
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:44,879
WE'RE LOOKING AT A HYBRID OF

134
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,580
2014 AND 2016.

135
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:46,747
WE EXPECT A VERY HIGH TURNOUT.

136
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:50,284
WE HAVE TO TURN OUT OUR VOTE TO

137
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,919
WIN AND WHY THE RNC HAS BEEN ON

138
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,423
THE GROUND FOR TWO YEARS AND

139
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,525
TRAINED 25,000 FIELD ORGANIZER

140
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:59,393
AND ORGANIZED OVER 200,000

141
00:03:59,394 --> 00:03:59,794
VOLUNTEERS.

142
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:00,795
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT WILL

143
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,063
TAKE TO TURN OUT OUR VOTE AND

144
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:03,131
WIN IN THE MID-TERMS.

145
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:05,967
>> Sandra: WE HAVE YOU ON THE

146
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:06,467
PROGRAM REGULARLY.

147
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:07,835
CONSIDERING WE'RE JUST 15 DAYS

148
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:11,672
OUT NOW, HOW DOES THE WAY YOU

149
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:13,074
SEE THE MID-TERMS PLAYING OUT,

150
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:14,609
HOW DOES IT LOOK TODAY VERSUS

151
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,044
SAY A MONTH AGO?

152
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:20,748
>> IT LOOKS BETTER FOR US.

153
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:24,285
THE HOUSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR

154
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:24,619
CONCERN.

155
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,219
DEFY HISTORY.

156
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,321
I WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

157
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,190
LAST WEEK IN CALIFORNIA, IN

158
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:31,792
ORANGE COUNTY IN ARIZONA, AND

159
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,194
NEVADA AND SEEING THE

160
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:34,262
ENTHUSIASM RAMP UP AND LOOKING

161
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:36,697
AT THE EARLY VOTES IN THE

162
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:37,398
ABSENTEE VOTES.

163
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,033
WE GET THE TURNOUT NUMBERS

164
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:39,534
EVERY NIGHT.

165
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:41,869
I FEEL GOOD WHERE WE ARE.

166
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,738
I THINK WE'LL MAINTAIN CONTROL

167
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:44,438
IN THE SENATE.

168
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,307
PICK UP ONE OR TWO SEATS OF

169
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:47,475
MORE AND POSSIBILITY TO KEEP

170
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:49,110
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE WHICH

171
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:50,244
WOULD BE HISTORICALLY SOMETHING

172
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:51,479
THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN THAT

173
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,747
FIRST TERM OF A PRESIDENT IN

174
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:55,716
THE PAST 100 YEARS.

175
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,618
BUT IT WILL DEPEND ON OUR

176
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,152
VOTERS TURNING OUT.

177
00:04:58,153 --> 00:05:02,123
THEY HAVE TO GO TO VOTE GOP.COM.

178
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:02,623
ENGAGE, VOLUNTEER.

179
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:04,492
WE HAVE TO TURN OUT THE BASE.

180
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:06,127
>> Sandra: FINALLY IF YOU WANT

181
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:07,128
THE PRESIDENT TO FOCUS ONE

182
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:09,864
PLACE, WHERE IS IT?

183
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,032
>> WELL, ALL THESE STATES THAT

184
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,767
HE IS GOING I WANT HIM

185
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:13,167
EVERYWHERE.

186
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:14,669
IF I COULD I WOULD CLONE HIM

187
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,270
AND PUT HIM EVERYTHING.

188
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,505
NORTH DAKOTA, WEST VIRGINIA.

189
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,006
