1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:02,986
- I have got bubbles where I
didn't think bubbles could go.

2
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:04,305
- That sounds horrid, doesn't it?

3
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,548
Guys, this has been pretty crazy.

4
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:06,769

- Yo, this daily vlog life

10
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:18,417
got me with bags under my eyes, bro.

11
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,874
Hello guys, and welcome
back to another daily vlog.

12
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:23,265
6:00 p.m. every day.

13
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:24,410
Let's do this.

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,879
6:00 p.m. every day. Let's do this.

15
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:28,153
I'm kind of liking that as a new intro.

16
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,031
Tell me what you think.

17
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,205
Anyway, I've just woke up,

18
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,267
just got a bath, just got out the bath.

19
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:34,517
Today I'm off to Jake's
house, or Jake Mitchell.

20
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,383
You should know him as a
YouTuber similar to me.

21
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,067
We're gonna film some stuff, chill.

22
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,160
It's gonna be really fun.

23
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,185
I'm literally setting off to
his house in about an hour

24
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:42,446
and I need to get more ready,

25
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:44,152
but yeah, you got a vlog bro.

26
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:45,736
The vlog comes first.

27
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:47,459
But anyway, yeah. He
lives down in Hereford,

28
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:49,087
and I live around Sheffield,

29
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:51,273
so that is a three hour train journey.

30
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:54,277
I'm sacrificing three hours
to come down there to Jake's,

31
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,824
so he better be happy,
you know what I'm saying?

32
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,178
Well guys, if you're excited

33
00:00:58,178 --> 00:00:59,332
for the videos I'm gonna do with Jake,

34
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:01,212
remember to leave a like on the video

35
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:03,472
and subscribe to my channel if you're new.

36
00:01:03,472 --> 00:01:05,215
I'm trying to get to two
million before my birthday,

37
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,664
which is the sixth of August,

38
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:08,209
so I need you guys to subscribe.

39
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,505
But anyway, this has become
a vlogging tradition.

40
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,195
Gotta come down and see how mum's going.

41
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:14,344
Is there a wild mama down here?

42
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,289
I see the wild mama.

43
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:17,122
- Hiya.

44
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:18,374
- [Morgan] How is your day going?

45
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:19,207
- Good.

46
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:20,222
- [Morgan] Looking
good, mum. Looking good.

47
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:21,404
I like the outfit.

48
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:22,508
- It's casual today.

49
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:23,780
Got tired, you know.

50
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,810
Mended the hoover 'cause
a piece fell off it.

51
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,835
- How interesting. Vlog footage. Mended a hoover.

52
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:31,890
So mum, when am I leaving?

53
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,947
How long have I actually got?

54
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:34,837
- [Mum] You've got to go
at half past one really.

55
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:36,102
Forty minutes something.

56
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,028
- I haven't done my hair.

57
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:37,861
I'm not dressed.

58
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:38,694
I'm not packed.

59
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:41,645
This is literally the
most Morgan thing ever.

60
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,073
Technically, it's dinner time,

61
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:44,381
so that's my only excuse,

62
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,476
but yeah, this is the first
meal I'm having today.

63
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:48,320
This is my breakfast.

64
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,860
Noodles and a Diet Coke.

65
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,265
What a lovely breakfast.

66
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:53,976
Okay guys, I'm just midway
through getting ready right now.

67
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:56,676
I'm gonna have to take
two separate rucksacks.

68
00:01:56,676 --> 00:01:58,121
But yeah guys, mum's gonna give me a lift

69
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,032
to the train station.

70
00:01:59,032 --> 00:01:59,865
We're setting off now,

71
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,505
so I'll see you in about five minutes.

72
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:04,878
So we're in the car right now with mum.

73
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:06,392
Don't crash, if you crash then...

74
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,275
- [Mum] No, I'm focused.

75
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,222
- Focused, that's good.

76
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:09,532
Guys, we're on the way.

77
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,732
Just on the way to the
train station right now,

78
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,034
then we got a three hour train.

79
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,908
It's gonna be terrible, but whatever.

80
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,012
- I'm looking forward to it.

81
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,542
- [Morgan] What the hell
are you looking forward to?

82
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:20,527
- Just having a couple of
days with Jake in Hereford.

83
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:21,515
I'm looking forward to it.

84
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,567
- [Morgan] Will you enjoy it without me?

85
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,512
- Why, you not going to Hereford with me?

86
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,701
Are you not coming?

87
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,427
- [Morgan] Mum, stop.

88
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:31,315
Mum, the train's here.

89
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:32,823
- I know, I'm so excited.

90
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,919
- [Morgan] I gotta break it to you.

91
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,359
You can't come.

92
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:37,497
- What?

93
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,424
- [Morgan] You're just,
you've not been invited.

94
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:40,974
- You said I was coming with you!

95
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:42,279
And I've got my things.

96
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,938
- Yeah, mum.
- Seriously?

97
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:45,771
- [Morgan] Bye.

98
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:46,604
See ya.

99
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:47,437
- Love you loads.

100
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:48,270
- Bye.

101
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,853
(hip hop beat)

102
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,858
Alright, we've arrived in Hereford.

103
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,649
I've just seen Jake's car.

104
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:13,590
Approaching it now.

105
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,113
Here he is.

106
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,570
It is such a nice day today.

107
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,403
Blue sky.

108
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:20,097
Jake, seriously.

109
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:21,336
This is mental.

110
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:22,607
I could live in that.

111
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:25,255
That is a perfectly acceptable house.

112
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,455
That is mental, oh my God.

113
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:28,564
I just got my studio done.

114
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:30,300
My studio's just a little room.

115
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,868
He's got a full-on house, bro.

116
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:32,916
That's mental.

117
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,020
I think my studio definitely tops this.

118
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,701
- [Jake] We did it last night.

119
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,534
We didn't film it though

120
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,019
because we didn't know
if it was gonna work,

121
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,447
and it works.

122
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:42,758
It seriously works.
- Oh no way, no way, no way.

123
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:44,470
Right, we're heading out already guys.

124
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,759
Basically, I've came here.

125
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,769
I've just changed into my
swimming trunks, and yeah.

126
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,202
We're doing a huge Slip 'N
Slide video on his channel

127
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:51,256
so we're gonna go out now.

128
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:52,928
I'm actually really pumped for this.

129
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,612
I wasn't expecting this, but yeah.

130
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:55,676
Anyway, yeah guys.

131
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:58,741
It's time to do a massive Slip 'N Slide.

132
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:02,599
Here we see some lovely
trees and a lovely blue sky.

133
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,775
And here is a big mat in
the middle of the field.

134
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:08,209
This is some intense action right here.

135
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,154
It's slimy, it's greasy.

136
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:10,987
What, is the water cold?

137
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:12,155
I haven't even thought about this.

138
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:13,277
- You don't want too much more

139
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,940
'cause it'll just get you wet.
- It better not be cold.

140
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,860
Wait, what you pouring?

141
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:26,913
- I should be getting paid for this.

142
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:29,365
This is manual labour.

143
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:30,536
- [Jake] YouTuber's
aren't meant to do this.

144
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,286
(cheerful music)

145
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:38,699
- Well guys, 30 minutes
later, one injured knee.

146
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,410
Guys, I've picked up a knock
and I need a substitution

147
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,372
so I've been filled in for.

148
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:45,269
Look at this. Look at this.

149
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,609
We've been taken over,
we have been taken over.

150
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:49,744
For real, though, guys.

151
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:51,690
I am ... just look at this.

152
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,064
The soap's actually
gone through to my belly

153
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,531
without even taking my top off.

154
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,170
This is just crazy.

155
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,419
- I have got bubbles where I
didn't think bubbles could go.

156
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,299
- That sounds horrid, doesn't it?

157
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:03,834
Guys, this has been pretty crazy.

158
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,516
Guys, I've just been down ten more times.

159
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,682
I'm not even joking.

160
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,887
I'll show you all the
bruises I've got later

161
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:13,300
when it's more clear but I swear, my leg.

162
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,652
I've landed on the same
place about 20 times.

163
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:18,265
My leg absolutely kills me, yeah.

164
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:21,643
Honestly, this has been fun
but then kind of not fun.

165
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:22,938
Dangerous, let's just say that.

166
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:25,568
The full video will be out
soon on Jake's channel.

167
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,565
I'll leave a link to his
channel in the description.

168
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:28,836
So get ready for that,

169
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,218
you'll want to watch
this full video, guys,

170
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:31,123
that's all I'm saying.

171
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,760
But, yeah, at the moment it's just kind of

172
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,354
coming to an end and the
kids are enjoying it still.

173
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:37,579
It is a very nice day.

174
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:41,880
It's been pretty good
except for my, my leg.

175
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,855
It's kind of hard to see, guys,

176
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:45,009
but this is my natural tone

177
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,562
and then this is kind of
on my bum, I do warn you.

178
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:50,669
It is literally just a big red mark.

179
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,182
I don't know if you can see it too well,

180
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,362
but that's one of them.

181
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:54,227
There's loads more.

182
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:55,990
My knee's literally bright red.

183
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,443
I think you can see that.

184
00:05:57,443 --> 00:05:58,276
It's kind of hard.

185
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,988
Overall, it's just not looking
too good down on the legs.

186
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:01,838
- [Morgan] Hey Lee, how was that?

187
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:03,382
- I'm dying. Help me.

188
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:04,885
- That was crazy, wasn't it?

189
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:05,718
Did you enjoy it?

190
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:06,551
- [Morgan] It was pretty crazy, yeah.

191
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:09,012
What's a nice way to say this: bum cheeks?

192
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:09,845
- Bum cheeks.

193
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,533
- [Morgan] They got fully
ground in the grass.

194
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:13,645
Right, so we've just got to Jake's house.

195
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:15,742
We've got some subscribers
who're just at the gate

196
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,147
and they say they want to be in the vlog

197
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:18,645
so gotta put them in the vlog.

198
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,806
Guys, how's it going?

199
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,198
Introduce yourselves.

200
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,445
- Hi, my name's Harry.

201
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:23,278
- Josh.

202
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:24,111
- And Harry as well.

203
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:26,131
- [Morgan] Well guys, thanks a lot

204
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:27,353
for all the support, there ya go.

205
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,347
Sweet. See you later.

206
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,578
- [Everyone] Cheers, thank you.

207
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:30,411
- Yo, what's up guys.

208
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,070
Basically, I've just got changed.

209
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,893
I'm in just some joggers
and then this top.

210
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:35,894
This may look like the same top

211
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:38,172
but this is a fresh top
with the same design.

212
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:39,744
I've got my swimming trunks in here.

213
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,782
Basically, what we're doing
now, we're going to the spa.

214
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:43,118
These lot go all the time.

215
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:43,951
- Let's go.

216
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:46,738
- I've never been to it.

217
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:50,414
I don't think I've ever actually
been to a spa in the UK.

218
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,041
It's just not what I ...

219
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,692
Guys, I'm excited, we're going now.

220
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:58,255
Outdoor pool, outdoor ... what is it?

221
00:06:58,255 --> 00:06:59,249
Hot tub, jacuzzi?

222
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,782
Amazing, I can't wait, guys.

223
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:01,615
I'm very excited.

224
00:07:01,615 --> 00:07:02,975
I feel like I'm too excited for this.

225
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:05,781
I feel like a few swimming
pools, but I'm ready, guys.

226
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:06,614
I'm ready.

227
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:10,219
First time in a spa, it's
so exciting, oh my god.

228
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:12,368
- [Morgan] I can't tell
if this is a fight or not.

229
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,282
- No, we're just hugging.

230
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:14,264
- [Morgan] It's flirting.

231
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:15,414
I think that's just flirting.

232
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:16,341
I think that's what it is.

233
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,804
- You come to his house,
Lee, and then you're

234
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,431
aggressively, flirtatiously hugging him.

235
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:22,181
I'm getting a bit of a vibe here.

236
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:24,622
Aahh.

237
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:33,032
I'm in this entire room
and the first thing

238
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,620
that caught my eye, apart
from Lee, was this Swegway.

239
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,720
I just love these, they're just too fun.

240
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:42,459
They're just too fun,
just spinning on them.

241
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,764
This is the life, this
is the life right here.

242
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,617
I think we're ready.

243
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:47,364
- Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready!

244
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,698
- [Morgan] Oh my god, Jake, seriously.

245
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,726
You get so much pussy.

246
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:54,168
You get so much pussy.

247
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:55,817
I get no pussy.

248
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,599
- They ran away, I have no pussy.

249
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,528
- [Morgan] Oh, yeah, okay.

250
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,619
I bet you're holding the door.

251
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,709
Oh, did you take it out?

252
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,126
Let's go, wa-hey!

253
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh my bag, what the hell!

254
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,600
You've got my swimming
shorts and all that.

255
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,076
- [Morgan's Friend] Is
it in the studio, Morgz?

256
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,628
- [Morgan] Yeah, cheers.

257
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:17,935
Guys, I think I got that on camera

258
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,758
because my camera was recording.

259
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,644
Came all the way to the
car, locked the studio

260
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:25,162
and left my bag with my
swimming trunks in the studio.

261
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:26,162
Great start.

262
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:29,597
(hip hop beat)

263
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,225
- Right guys, we've just
pulled up at the spa.

264
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,520
The Leisure Centre.

265
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,541
The thing is, you're not
allowed to film in here

266
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,203
and I've got a huge camera.

267
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,451
- I've done it before and
I'm on my last strike.

268
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,174
- He's done it before and
he's on his last strike

269
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:44,174
so I would, just to screw them over,

270
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,101
but this is a pretty big camera
and I've gotta be careful.

271
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:50,025
So guys, I'll tell you how it is.

272
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,119
I think they've just locked me ...

273
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,961
I'm not happy, I'm not happy about this.

274
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:58,158
I have been locked in, against my will.

275
00:08:58,158 --> 00:09:00,245
Guys, I'll update you
after we've been in there.

276
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:02,613
So I'll see you guys in an hour?

277
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:05,005
Two hours? An hour?

278
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:06,773
Whatever guys, I'll see you soon.

279
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:09,375
Just come back to the car with Jake's keys

280
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,726
because I forgot my towel
and my swimming trunks

281
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:13,541
and we got through to the changing rooms.

282
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,197
Well done, Morgan, I'm just really good.

283
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:17,532
I'm just good at life.

284
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:18,592
Guys, I'm going back in.

285
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:19,678
I'll see you later.

286
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,636
Right, guys, it's little bit dark

287
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:24,693
so I don't know if you can
see me but two hours has gone.

288
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:27,093
70% charge on my phone has gone.

289
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:30,512
Guys, that was pretty ... oh, okay.

290
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:31,383
That was pretty good guys.

291
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:32,468
Had a good time.

292
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,541
Now we're going back to Jake's
but check this out, right.

293
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,702
I deliberately left my phone on 1% so ...

294
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,173
Why is it disabled?

295
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:40,553
Five minutes!

296
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:41,483
Are you joking?

297
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:43,544
I'm on 1%, no!

298
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:45,278
Oh my god, guys.

299
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:47,653
I left my phone on 1% so
I could follow some people

300
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,061
and start a follow-some-dude-on-Twitter
follow spree

301
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,942
and it's gonna take five
minutes and it's on 1%

302
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:54,189
so it's gonna die.

303
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,610
That's a nightmare, I'm not
happy about that one but ...

304
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,461
Anyway, I guess I'll do the follow spree

305
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,419
when we're back at Jake's.

306
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,002
(hip hop beat)

307
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:06,597
- Yo, guys.

308
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:07,430
Wait, is my mic on?

309
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,263
Yep, it is.

310
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:09,483
Yo, guys. We're back now.

311
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm just gonna leave that in.

312
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,770
We're back now in the studio.

313
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,349
To be honest, it's been a really good day.

314
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,410
Though, the aftermath
from the Slip 'N' Slide,

315
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,480
my bum, my boom, is very red

316
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,878
because what happened was I
went off the Slip 'N' Slide

317
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:25,168
and because I was still
sliding, my shorts pulled up.

318
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,414
Wedgie, basically.

319
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:30,753
So I slid across the grass
and I did that five times

320
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:33,107
so it really hurts,
guys, I'm not gonna lie.

321
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:34,300
And my leg, obviously.

322
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,234
But yeah, we're just chilling now.

323
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,259
We're gonna watch a film, I think.

324
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:37,092
Jake, what's it called?

325
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:39,009
- [Jake] Haunted House.

326
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:41,776
- Oh, wow.

327
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,255
We're gonna watch Haunted House.

328
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:45,265
So on my Twitter, which is @MorgzHudson,

329
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:47,030
I love following you guys back.

330
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,400
I follow loads of you back.

331
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,152
I do follow sprees all the time

332
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,552
and I started doing a follow spree

333
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:53,758
while I was in the hot tub in the spa.

334
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:56,409
So retweet and turn on my
notifications for a follow.

335
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:59,076
So guys, since I didn't get
to follow too many of ya

336
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,328
while I was in the spa, because my phone,

337
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,495
Imma follow, Imma follow,
Imma follow, Imma follow

338
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,129
How many are we doing?

339
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:10,712
Follow, follow, follow, follow.

340
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:12,984
You don't get a follow.

341
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:16,157
He can get a follow, but
yeah, you can't get a follow.

342
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:18,043
Do you know who can get a follow?

343
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,607
Kevin, Kevin Carney, he can get a follow.

344
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:21,440
- [Morgan's Friend] Oh, Kev.

345
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,506
- [Morgan] Big Daniel Paterson,

346
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,723
he definitely can get a follow.

347
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:27,098
And this person can get a ...

348
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:28,187
Oh, I just unfollowed, okay.

349
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,270
Oh no, I'm their request.

350
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:34,054
Oh my god, I'm sorry whoever that is.

351
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:36,765
They're gonna have to
send me a follow request.

352
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:38,605
Yeah, let me get four more.

353
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,548
Five, six, seven.

354
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:41,438
Boys, there we go.

355
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:44,525
Add my Twitter, I do these
follow sprees all the time.

356
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:48,880
Morgan @MorgzHudson, guys,
give it a follow right now.

357
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,205
And yeah, you never know,
maybe I'll follow you back.

358
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:54,836
Still not gonna follow you back, though.

359
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:55,669
Are you vlogging?

360
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:56,885
Are you Snapchatting me?

361
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:58,166
I'm not happy about this.

362
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,416
(TV noise)

363
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,807
They're now in, 24/7.

364
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,639
Morgz merch, get yours.

365
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,033
Description down below.

366
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,652
Use code Morgz10, 10% off.

367
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:24,662
I've got my headphones on,

368
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,774
I've no clue how loud I'm talking.

369
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,880
But yeah, that's my merch.

370
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,260
It's time to Sweg walk.

371
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,621
Can I get on it first time?

372
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,845
Is this thing, it's not even on.

373
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:39,262
Is this one dead?

374
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:45,200
Oh my god, only one side works.

375
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,033
Woah.

376
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,937
Don't go on Netflix for films
because they're all bad.

377
00:12:57,071 --> 00:13:00,304
Just casually going on the
Swegway in front of the movie

378
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,881
but really, I don't think
anyone cares, to be honest.

379
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,184

are gonna end the video.
