SCOOP. I WILL. THANK YOU AND GREAT TALKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU. Sean: SEAN SPICER AUTHOR OF THE GERALDO SHE. GERALDO RIVERA AND SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR HENRY McMASTER IS WITH US. AND LET ME START WITH YOU. THIS IS INTERESTING, IF YOU LOOK IN THE CASE IN PARTICULAR, IT WAS A FIRST OFFENSE, AND LIFETIME SENTENCE FOR A WOMAN WHO HAD A LOT OF PERMANENT PROBLEM AND NEEDED MONEY AND GOT INVOLVED IN DRUGS AND I THINK THAT THE CASE THAT KIM KARDASHIAN PUSHED IS A POWERFUL ONE AND WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. I THINK THERE IS IT NO DOUBT THAT KIM KARDASHIAN'S APPEARANCE WAS APPROPRIATE. SURE SEAN SPICER COULD ANSWER THAT BETTER. SHE WAS BRINGING ATTENTION TO A NECESSARY ISSUE AND ONE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS GRAPPLING WITH THANKS TO THE NEW LEGISLATION ON SENTENCING REFORM. AND A LIFETIME SENTENCE AND NO PAROLE, SHE DIDN'T MURDER ANYBODY AND I THINK THAT KIM KARDASHIAN'S VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE. SAMANTHA BEE, YOU KNOW THE I HYPOCRISY. WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS HAVE THE THE VICTIMS OF THE INSULT TELL US WHAT TO DO. VALERIE JARRET RE71EDED GRACIOUSLY TO ROSEANNE BARR AND IVANKA WAS BEYOND GRACIOUS. WHEN THEY BEG FORGIVENESS. MAYBE WE GIVE IT. THAT IS A CHRISTIAN VIEW. Sean: WHAT IS YOUR TAKE. MY SHOCK FAKE. THERE IS NOTHING IN BOTH OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOCK ME. JIM ACOSTA TO DECIDE WHAT IS IMPORTANT ISSUE TO HEAR WHAT IS DISCUSSED AT WHITE HOUSE? AND BUT IT IS NOT UP TO THE MEDIA NEVER MIND JIM ACOSTA TO DECIDE WHAT IS A VALID ISSUE OR NOT. IT IS UP TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER ELECTED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DECIDE WHAT IS SDRAESZED. AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT TO ADVOCATE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THEM ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. ON THE OTHER ONE SAMANTHA BEE, I BELIEVE, I MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT I ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS FOR AND PEOPLE WERE VERY GRACIOUS TO ME. YOU DID NOT MAKE THAT MANY MISTAKES. THANK YOU, BUT MY POINT IS THIS. WHEN PEOPLE SCREW UP AND APOLOGIZE GIVE THEM FORGIVENESS. BULLPEN THE DOUBLE STANDARD THAT EXISTS WHETHER SAMANTHA BEE OR JOY REED. AND WHEN THEY MAKE A MISTAKE, THE LEFT ABSOLVES THEM AND EXCUSES AND EXPLAINS THEY ARE NOT THAT BAD AND NO CONSEQUENCES. IVANKA IS SO GRACEFUL ABOUT THIS. THIS IS IT NOT THE FIRST TIME. REMEMBER THE FORMER POLITICO REPORTER IN THE ATLANTIC SAID A SIMILAR THING. WHAT WAS THE THING? SHE DIDN'T MEAN? ? THE ATTACKS BY THE JOURNALIST AND PEOPLE ON THE LEFT GET EXCUSED AND WASHED AWAY EVERY TIME. Sean: GOOD LUCK FOR YOUR RUN FOR GOVERNOR IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL STATE AND I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS DOWN THERE. AND I LOOK AT THIS. I AM LIKE THIS IS NOW AN ENVIRONMENT. I READ EVERYBODY'S APOLOGIYS. AND ROSEANNE APOLOGIZED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND I SENSE THAT THERE IS REAL SINCERITY. 2:45 A.M. TWEET AND NOT A GOOD THING AND I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS GERALDO KNOWS A THING ABOUT THAT. IN KNOW VERY WELL. NO TWEETING AFTER MIDNIGHT. Sean: EVERYBODY WANTS TO SILENCE VOICES THEY NEVER AGREE WITH. I NEVER CALLED FOR CANCELLING OF A SHOW AND FIRING OF A HOST AND BILL MAR WANT AND SEAN HANNITY AND RUSH LIMBAUGH. WE SAID DON'T FIRE THEM. THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST GONE CRAZY. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IT ENOMMOUSLY POP PROSPECT HERE. IF HE RUN TODAY HE WOULD GET MORE VOTES AND HAD HIS TWEET WAS RIGHT. HE IS SAYING WHAT EVERYBODY IN SOUTH CAROLINA IS THINKING. HE'S 100 PERCENT RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS HATRED OF THE PRESIDENT OR WHAT HE STANDS FOR. THEY ARE MAKING FOOMS OF THEMSELVES. THEY ARE SO DEEP IN THE TANK THEY DON'T REALIZE IT AND SHOOT. THEY WILL APOLOGIZE UNTIL THE NEXT TIME AND THEN THE NEXT TIME AND I THINK PEOPLE HAVE JUST HAD ENOUGH OF IT. Sean: GERALDO, AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE EVERYBODY TO WATCHMENT SHOW,IN HAVE TO HAVE THEM INVIT ME IN THIS HOME AND THAT'S HOW YOU GAIN THE AUDIENCE. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SMART. WE FEEL WE HAVE TO SILENCE. IN THAT REGARD, REFERENCING SOMETHING IN THE BEGINNING. PROGRAM THIS EVENING ABOUT THE DEEP STATE COMING FOR YOU. ME. I WILL BE THERE FIGHTING OFF THESE PEOPLE. Sean: I HAVE GERALDO IN MY BUNKER, I AM SAFE. I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEVEL OF CIVILITY? IT IS LOW DOWN AND DIRTY NOW. AND THE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR IN THE GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA ALLUDED TO IT. THERE IS REALLY, THE COUNTRY IS SO DWIELDED AND THE PEOPLE WHO HATE THE PRESIDENT HATE HIM WITH SUCH VE HEMINENCE. AND WHERE DO THEY GET THIS Sean: YOU WANT HIM SUCCEED. IF HE'S SUCCESSFUL WITH THE ECONOMY. LOOK AT NORTH KOREA AND KEEPING HIS PROMISE AND BECOMING ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND THAT DACKS CUT. THAT IS BAD NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS FOR THEM TO WIN HE HAS TO FALL. THAT IS MELANCOLLIE THAT THEY ROOT AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRY FOR PARTISAN PERSON. HAWN Sean: LAST WORD. ONE THING ABOUT THE SAMANTHA BEE IS IT WAS PRETAPED AND THEY SCRIPTED IT AND STILL WENT AHEAD OF IT. THAT IS VASTLY MAKING A STEPPING IN IT WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT. AND I REALLY THINK THE CASE IS DIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER ONES.
