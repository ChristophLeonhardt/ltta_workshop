1
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,399
I was told to go downstairs and then as
if sort of on signal those doors opened.

2
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:23,049
And then in their midst was
this precious little child.

3
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:26,950
And as I went over to greet her,
her brown eyes you know just

4
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,760
rose up to meet mine and, oh mercy,
it was just love at first sight.

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,320
Two days before, on a Friday
evening, I received a call from

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,900
the superintendent of schools asking
me if I would like to take a first grade.

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,359
And then to my surprise it
evolved quite differently.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,909
To drive up to the school that
morning and witness this crowd,

9
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,190
people yelling, and there
were a lot of placards

10
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,010
with all kinds of sayings,
some even from the Bible.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,240
I was so stunned by the reaction
to what was happening.

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,370
I could not believe people would treat
anyone like that, particularly a child.

13
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,139
By Nov.15, there were no
children left in the school.

14
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:16,180
They were all gone.

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,919
We joined hands and went
up to our lonely classroom

16
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:29,330
where we began our
solitary adventure.

17
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,640
We'd sit side by side because,
you know, I could fit into the

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,530
desks then, I was skinny.

19
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,319
And I often chuckle at the
fact that I had snowflakes

20
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,100
to emphasize different ways
you could make the number four,

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,069
you know, three and one, two and two.

22
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,610
There was never a hand
offered the entire

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,739
year to do a single thing
for Ruby and me.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,380
But that first day, I was, in 
a way, being just a friend to

25
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,750
her and she was taken home
by the federal marshals.

26
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,279
But I think I told her I said
while there weren't any children

27
00:02:09,279 --> 00:00:00,000
here now, there would be.
Some would join us later on.
