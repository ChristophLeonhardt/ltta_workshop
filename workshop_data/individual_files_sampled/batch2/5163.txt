he's great he is great he's our pastor they say he's the closest thing to General George Patton that we have and it's about time Donald Trump loves nicknames he tends to use meek names to diminish his enemies and rewards the people he likes with muscular nicknames like Mad Dog it's been reported Trump loved the nickname Mad Dog the first time he heard it it's been theorized it played a part in the selection of General James maddest to be defense secretary but exclusive reporting out of out today from NBC News finds that these days the man known as secretary mattis is often out of the loop when it comes to key policy decisions he was apparently blindsided by Trump's decision to pause those military exercises with South Korea after that meeting with Kim jong-un mattis was said to be surprised at Trump's announcement to form a new branch of the US military the space force current and former administration officials tell NBC News quote the president has cooled on mattis in part because he's come to believe his defense secretary looks down on him and slow walks his policy directives well here with us to talk about it tonight Carol Lee our NBC News national political reporter whose byline appears on this NBC news report and retired US Army colonel Jack Jacobs a decorated veteran of combat in Vietnam one of 72 living recipients of the Medal of Honor also happens to be for good reason our MSNBC military analyst welcome to you both Carol how did we get here visa vie the president and his defense secretary well I think it's there's a number of ways in which we got to this point you know when secretary mattis came in he was part of this group of generals that was you know supposed to kind of by in terms of if you talk to people on Capitol Hill or others who felt like they were you know stabilizing force on the Pres and that they were going to keep him from doing and taking steps that could plunge the country into some sort of chaos or might take part u.s. foreign policy in a direction that they felt like it shouldn't go and so he was you know it was secretary mattis it was then former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then John Kelly who's now the chief of staff and so the three of them kind of worked in tandem together and and would push the president to go in directions that they wanted his policies to go particularly on Iran for instance on the nuclear deal and the president over time got frustrated with that we saw Rex Tillerson eventually be fired we've seen John Kelly lose some of his clout and his power and the president meanwhile you know towards the end of last year became more emboldened and more inclined to listen to his own instincts and want to take big strides on on the world stage and so he was less inclined to listen to somebody like James Madison and more inclined to turn to some of the new folks coming into his administration like his national security adviser John Bolton or when Mike Pompeo moved over to become Secretary of State and so all of those factors kind of played a role in what's now according to our reporting a dynamic where the president doesn't really take hit mattis's advice they don't really agree on very many policy issues and even more so that he doesn't really concede uhz n't notify him in some instances that he's going to take certain significant foreign policy or national security steps Jack knowing a little something about guys like you and secretary mattis I'll lump in our mutual friend Barry McCaffrey your Patriots driven by duty you've all been shot at for your country you all believe in chain of command having said all that it is hard to envision a secretary mattis saying that's it I'm out of here you'll have to find somebody else yeah I think he's going to stand his post until he's dragged off but a raised auditioning question of why he stays there other than the fact that he will stand on his post until he's relieved reminds me of a conversation I had with a very good friend of mine who roasts the top ranks in the military establishment some years ago and he was involved in executing our plan to to go into Iraq which was very poorly managed certainly at the time we took over Baghdad and so on didn't work out very well India and you could argue strenuously was a rotten idea to start with all that notwithstanding I asked him how come he didn't put his foot down and keep us from doing the kinds of things that we shouldn't have been doing and he said because if I did that I'd be fired and I said what's wrong with that he said I I'm more effective inside than outside and I told him I said if you're ineffective inside you might as well be outside James Madison effective inside and overtime is going to become more ineffective and it's just a matter of time I think before he leaves it won't be by his own volition by John Kelly for example it'll be because he's he's shipped out hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you
