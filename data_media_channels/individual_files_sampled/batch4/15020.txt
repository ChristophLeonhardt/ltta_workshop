if I had a crystal ball and could witness a different scenario surrounding the confirmation process for Gina Haskell with her being a Democrat appointee I could tell you exactly what that would look like I don't have a crystal ball but I think I can still pretty accurately surmise how that process would go down if Hillary Clinton had been elected president god help us first of all we'd have pretty much all of her positions filled by now because the confirmation process would be much shorter with less obstruction Democrats are dragging this out for b-roll sound bites for their midterm campaigns but if Hillary was president and she had appointed Gina Haskell for director of the CIA it would be a celebratory time in America similar to that of the Bicentennial Clinton would be praised for nominating the first woman for the position and Haspel would be praised deservedly so as she should be now for being the most qualified nominee to ever be appointed to the position she is the woman behind many of our biggest recent successes with regard to counterterrorism she has experienced in practically every single discipline of the agency she worked her way up from the bottom she's been referred to by her colleagues as a spymaster how freaking badass is that she's made tough decisions that no one else had the intestinal fortitude to she put in the hard dirty ugly work that is required and she should be rewarded for her decades of service but not just for her own sake for the sake of the American people and for our safety but because she was nominated to the position of Director of the CIA by Donald Trump she's not qualified okay as I watched her confirmation hearing by the Senate Intel committee a witness Democrat after Democrat berated her criticized her performance and questioned her moral compass these men and women who lived their secure comfortable lives with their Logan Circle condos and their private drivers and their seven-figure lifestyles they're under the table perks their Secret Service detail they have the audacity to question this woman based on what their own integrity laughable their opinion of Gina Haskell carries as much weight as 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who apparently has six paragraphs worth of information then he would like to share with the Senate I'm sorry but why do we care what he has to say 3,000 Americans are dead because of this malevolent sociopath I'm going to say something controversial here and this is my opinion and my opinion only it does not reflect the opinions of anyone else here at the rebel but I am absolutely in favor of waterboarding if you are a terrorist and you have information that can either save American lives or lead us to other terrorists you better believe I'm in favor of enhanced interrogation whatever that entails I do it for myself if I could and I'd probably be as sadistic as possible maybe that maybe this the answer to all of this okay fine we'll make it state policy that we don't torture but let's have some private citizens take one for the team and we'll do it ourselves buy me a plane ticket and pack me a bag with some meat cleaver scalpels and a hammer and I'll go to town on a terrorist if you enjoyed my commentary in opinions we've got an unlimited supply of them over here at the rebel so subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com and ahead for the rebel
