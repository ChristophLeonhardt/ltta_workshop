my Ashley Parker White House reporter for the Washington Post and Eugene Robinson a calm with the comments with the post both or MSNBC contributors gee and I saw you're laughing at his sort of explanation there I mean it is it depends what your definition of is it was back the well and I was checking I had somebody checked but I could do myself anytime I wanted to it was a two-year set of discussions between Kim jong-un's grandfather and us right in the big so-called ending of the Korean War which took two years until I got elected hee hee so this is that what they're talking about dragging us into a two sides of the table at Pyongyang somewhere it is very noble to mum and John it is unimaginable to me that North Korea would agree to do anything without some sort of protracted negotiation process whatever it is also unimaginable to me that they will give up all of their nuclear weapons because why would they they have decades they like the Libya they don't like the Libyan model they know what happened to Muammar Qaddafi they don't like that model and so you know after after all this money all this research all this effort to make nuclear weapons and to be treated like a nuclear power even though they're not acknowledged to be one are they gonna give that up although you know all the way I don't think so I just don't think so no I do think it's good if Kim and president prep talk because I think talking is better than shooting but I don't think they're gonna give up all their nukes same question you when you look at then you're looking at reporting on maybe you can't report this I'd you got to think it through and projected but the history is right the history is they don't do anything in an hour or a day and Trump's over there he thinks in minutes that's exactly right and when you talk to White House officials initially they sort of said perhaps optimistically or quite frankly optimistically this isn't gonna be like other times this isn't gonna be we start talking and there's concessions and there's easy enough sanctions this is gonna be our maximum pressure campaign until we get what we want now you talked to them this week in light of recent news and they've basically become you could say pessimistic could say skeptical or you could say realists which is they understand that Kim has reverted to his usual playbook and it may not be that different than his father grandfather well there's the president no president Chopp know that he's sitting on a dunking chair basically once he sits in that seat with that guy that guy can play every game he wants to and I don't know how Trump knows I could be humiliated rather quickly I'm you know I think this is because what President Trump did was raise expectations to really a ridiculous level I mean it was like we're I'm just gonna go over there we're gonna talk they're gonna get rid of all their nukes and it's gonna be and then we're gonna make them rich and it's gonna and so now the tone is that because he has to what negotiating leverage does he have if Kim knows that he's so desperate for deal I'm hearing one word unilateral I'm hearing no unilateral so what do they want from us Ashley what are the North Korean what do they want from us in South South Korea they want to get take our umbrella away from South Korea take our troops away which are basically the tripwire it's a cold war style we have our troops there so they attack our troops we bring in the big lot bombs we always know that's how it works is that what they want us to clear out of the the DMZ xxx our own parallel well sad word he's gonna pull on us the first day the thing that is unclear is there's what they actually want from us and then what they're sort of currently demanding and some of that what they're demanding is stuff for a show of force in their own country or for leverage or to have an excuse when this falls apart but it seems like a lot of the demands at least as the White House views them are whether they want or not they're absolutely unrealistic and simply not going to happen I just look at that rigid leader if you if you wink the wrong way if you don't laugh in unison if you do anything that country it isn't regimental you're dead he gets some kind of poison in your face he kills uncle's he kills everybody and the ID he's gonna go in and go a rock-and-roll session let's see what happens with Trump is insane he's not a rock and roller he's not down where Sadat he's not a guy who would even even you know look Bagan would actually think there I don't think he's going to change his mind we know and and frankly we know less than we'd like to know about North Korea but but everybody I know who knows about that place says that's not how North Korea works there is a whole apparatus of officials and Hepper attics around akin the generals the you know these these high-ranking people who live pretty good lives and who have power and who are who are bought into this crazy system and who are not gonna give it up with you know and just put the flag and see if that works what's happening I tried to give it up I'm not sure he would be a while I go back to he Trump thinks in seconds many seconds nanoseconds tweets this these people Asians do as a general cultural think much more long-term that we do a long-term they're thinking about where they're gonna be in 20-30 years this guy's 30 something Trump just wants the deal he just wants the win that's what he always wants hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want
