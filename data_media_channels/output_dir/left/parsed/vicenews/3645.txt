all right who's this have we met Jimmy
Jimerson ready to burn this yeah yeah
this is for all the people who enslaved
from 1619 to 1865 guys say the
Confederates if the clam and white
masses these anti-fascist activists are
riding high after a string of victories
they're camping in the deep woods of
Tennessee the night before a white
nationalist conference hoping to shut it
down so hey everyone
comedian gather around a little bit how
are you guys haven't seen you on it's
been a week right am I talking to who
I'm thinking I'm talking to yeah okay we
all know each other I want to say thank
you guys all of you I've not met some of
you but you guys who you're here and it
makes me really proud to be fighting by
your side we're a family
we're not blood but
for family tomorrow when you're doing
that choice do I take the next step
what could take it many of these guys
are veterans of past events they've been
in fights together failed each other out
of jail they travel around the South and
Midwest of protest white nationalists
since Charlottesville white power events
have gotten smaller but aunt Eva wants
them to stop entirely chief employs
different tactics and strategies 2d
platformer white nationalists Nazis and
what are those strategies a lot of times
it includes actual violence but are you
ever concerned that like even if these
methods work they might be unethical I'm
okay with that I don't feel bad for
ruining their weekend do you
ever feel like fighting Nazis gives you
purpose and so like in a way it gives
you your life meaning no it's so much
rather be doing other things making
science fiction movies and you know
spending time with my daughter I feel
like I have to do it
because so few people realize that
phrase lest we forget
most people are forgotten
in March and Tifa scored its biggest
victory at Michigan State they fought
off Richard Spencer supporters and the
night before found out where they were
staying and got in a car chase Spencer
canceled his college tour a few days
later an tyfa is winning to the extent
that they are willing to go further than
anyone else some of these tactics are a
bit less brutal than punching people it
was from some kind of fake email but I
was able to trace it back to him
they've doxxed white nationalists
posting their real names and locations
so neighbors and employers know who they
are and they've engaged in creative
counterintelligence it's real easy to
catfish them and that is always leads to
solid Intel so explain what catfishing
means pretending to be a girl we create
a profile very typical very
stereotypical woman who is approaching
these guys who are insecure you throw a
little love Adam
what kind of love like you're so sexy
yeah you're a badass you're so good at
what you do how do I be a part no no I
go that's how we find out what they're
planning where they're gonna be and how
to do it
using their misogyny against them yeah
yes they can't just they couldn't fathom
that they could ever be duped by a
female this is the American Renaissance
conference an annual meeting of white
power figures who work to give an
intellectual oisin to racism jackets and
ties are
a few dozen anti-fascists were there to
get in their faces and to stop their
conference but that's gotten harder to
pull off police are better prepared with
a massive display of force
didn't say half day the police have
completely fenced off the area that they
want us to be this is the only area that
they're letting us be protests were
limited to a demonstration area
surrounded by fences and a motive police
all I could do was yeah be
accountable for your actions if you
weren't in that uniform
then would kill you just
as quickly as they will kill me or any
better black man what the are you
doing what the are you doing this
was too much for some allies when I come
through the police I tell them I said
thank you for taking care of us to keep
us from these Nazis who are truly
dangerous and terrible people
it sort of puts them a little
off-balance because they're expecting
people to call him and all
that kind of thing
this was the only major conflict of the
day police jumped in to remove one
protester who they said pulled his
bandanna over some of his face he was
not arrested before the conference you
guys are talking about shutting the
whole thing down making them have a
really bad day you weren't able to do
that their conference seemed to go about
his plan so do you still consider this a
success yeah you know I mean I
considered that the fact that we get
people out there and there's a show you
don't win every battle and I don't
expect you
you
