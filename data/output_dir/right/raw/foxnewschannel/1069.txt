1
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:11,994
HOUSE MINORITY LEADER

2
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:12,694
NANCY PELOSI CATCHING HEAT FOR

3
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:14,062
THESE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ECONOMY

4
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:16,297
UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

5
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:17,599
>> UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN, WHAT

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:18,867
DOES THAT MEAN TO ME IN MY LIFE?

7
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:23,105
THAT MEANS I NEED A BIGGER

8
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:23,472
PAYCHECK.

9
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:24,673
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE

10
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:26,908
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, IT'S ABOUT

11
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:30,779
WAGES RISING IN OUR COUNTRY SO

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,649
THAT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS

13
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,118
RESTORED.

14
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:39,921
>> TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND YOU SAID,

15
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:40,522
YOU REMEMBER THIS.

16
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:42,924
I WILL NOT TOUCH

17
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:43,725
SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND

18
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:44,092
MEDICAID.

19
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:46,194
BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT PAUL RYAN.

20
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:50,799
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

21
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,234
$500 BILLION IN MEDICARE,

22
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:54,336
MASSIVE CUTS IN EDUCATION AND

23
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:54,870
NUTRITION PROGRAMS.

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,640
HE'S GOING TO WAR AGAINST

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,107
WORKING PEOPLE.

26
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:01,209
>> SAW A NEW FOX NEWS PULLOUT

27
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:01,977
SHOWS PRESIDENT TRUMP AT 44

28
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:05,580
WHICH MIGHT BE AT THE HIGHEST.

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,784
AND THE KEY DRIVER FOR THE

30
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:10,852
PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THE

31
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,120
ECONOMY.

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,289
THERE YOU SEE IT ON THE SCREEN,

33
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,892
I THINK IT WAS 52%.

34
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:18,894
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FACT

35
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:22,564
THAT LEADING DEMOCRATS FOR

36
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:24,866
PELOSI, SANDERS AND OTHERS, ARE

37
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:35,510
WILL LIKE, WHAT ABOUT WAGES.

38
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,479
THAT'S THE FASTEST WILL RISE IN

39
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,515
WHICH A SINCE 2009.

40
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:42,718
AND IT'S MY PLEASURE TO

41
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:43,185
FACT-CHECK YOU.

42
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,387
>> IT IS.

43
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:49,391
>> 0.3 IS THE LAST, SINCE HE HAS

44
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:52,728
BEEN PRESIDENT, WAGES HAVE BEEN

45
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:54,897
UP CLOSE TO 3% AND THAT'S A

46
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:55,197
FACT.

47
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:57,533
ALSO, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS AT

48
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:58,534
AN 18 YEAR HIGH.

49
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,502
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT PELOSI IS

50
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:01,270
TALKING ABOUT, WHEN YOU COMBINE

51
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,507
THAT WITH, THE JOB WAS NUMBERS

52
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:09,777
ARE DOWN, AND DIGNITY 13, THOSE

53
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,346
ARE JUST MADE TO ORDER

54
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:12,114
REPUBLICAN ADS.

55
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:13,782
WE WERE LAUGHING DURING THE

56
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:16,351
BREAK ABOUT IT, SHE COULD NOT

57
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,720
CUT A BETTER AD FOR THE

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,154
REPUBLICANS.

59
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,923
NANCY, WE LOVE YOU.

60
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:22,758
>> SO KIMBERLY, BERNIE SANDERS

61
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,827
SAYS THIS IS A WAR ON WORKING

62
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:26,562
PEOPLE BEING WAGED BY THE

63
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:28,897
PRESIDENT WHO WANTS -- HE SAID

64
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,933
HE WOULD NEVER CUT MEDICARE,

65
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:31,800
MEDICAID OR SOCIAL SECURITY

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,970
INCOME BUT IN FACT HIS BUDGETS

67
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,673
LOOK INTENT ON DOING JUST THAT.

68
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:39,074
>> Kimberly: I THINK

69
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:40,476
BERNIE SANDERS HAS BEEN HAVING

70
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:42,144
TOO MANY CAFETERIA LUNCHES WITH

71
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:43,545
NANCY PELOSI BECAUSE THEY BOTH

72
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:44,713
SEEMED CONFUSED.

73
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:48,116
THEIR COMMENTS ARE ONLY HELPING

74
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,117
TO MOTIVATE THE PRESIDENTS

75
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:49,418
SPACE.

76
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:51,787
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, IT

77
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,322
FLIES IN THE FACE OF THEIR

78
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:53,922
ILLOGICAL COMMENTS AND

79
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:54,356
STATEMENTS.

80
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:56,358
WHEN YOU SEE AN ECONOMY BOOMING

81
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:59,127
LIKE THIS, YOU SEE WOMEN,

82
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:01,530
MINORITIES AND BLACKS ALL

83
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,664
ENGAGED IN THE ECONOMY, RECORD

84
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,132
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, THIS IS

85
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:05,334
SOMETHING THAT AMERICA WANTED.

86
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:07,769
THIS IS WHY HE WAS ELECTED.

87
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,172
YOU SEE HERE IS SOMEBODY LIKE

88
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,139
NANCY PELOSI WHO IS COMPLETELY

89
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,375
OUT OF TOUCH, DOESN'T MAKE ANY

90
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:13,976
SENSE.

91
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,177
ONE GAP AFTER THE NEXT.

92
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:16,845
IF THAT'S THE FUTURE OF THE

93
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:18,247
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY ARE IN

94
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:21,149
BIG TROUBLE GOING INTO THE

95
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:22,951
MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND GOING INTO

96
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:23,519
2020.

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,019
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

98
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,321
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS RIGHT NOW,

99
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,123
THAT SOMETHING SUSTAINABLE IN

100
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:28,824
TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH.

101
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:30,726
THE DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF TALKING

102
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:35,431
POINTS BUT THEY ARE NOT OUT OF

103
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:36,532
GAS.

104
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:38,700
>> Juan: DANA, GOING BACK TO

105
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,335
THE POLLING, WHEEZING COMING

106
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:41,937
FROM PELOSI IS AN ARGUMENT THAT,

107
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:42,805
WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE WAGES,

108
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,940
THEY CAN'T PAY FOR HEALTH CARE.

109
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,307
THEY CAN.

110
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:47,342
FOR THE HIGH COST OF

111
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:47,876
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

112
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:49,278
THEY CAN'T PAY FOR THE KIDS TO

113
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:50,345
GO TO COLLEGE.

114
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:53,348
ARE WE SEEING THE EVOLUTION OF

115
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:56,919
DEMOCRATS MESSAGING FOR THAT?

116
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,221
>> Dana: IT'S NOT LIKE SHE IS

117
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,355
MAKING GAS, SHE IS ACTUALLY

118
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:03,125
SPENDING MONEY ON ADS.

119
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,793
SO IF SOMEONE IS TELLING THEM

120
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,261
THAT THIS MESSAGE WORKS FOR

121
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:07,930
THEIR PARTICULAR VOTERS.

122
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,931
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THIS

123
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,132
THAT THE REPUBLICANS JUST NEED

124
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,967
TO BE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED

125
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,502
ABOUT IS, THE PRESIDENT'S

126
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,537
NUMBERS ARE BETTER, THE GENERIC

127
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:17,005
BALLOT IS BETTER.

128
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,141
BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE HIGHLY

129
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,209
MOTIVATED TO REGISTER NEW

130
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:20,541
VOTERS.

131
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,177
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS UNTIL THE

132
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,378
OTHER DAY.

133
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:25,347
IN THE VIRGINIA ELECTION FOR THE

134
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:27,783
GUBERNATORIAL RACE LAST

135
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:28,417
NOVEMBER, MORE REPUBLICANS

136
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,986
TURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR THE

137
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:34,289
ELECTION THEN THE HISTORY OF THE

138
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:34,623
COUNTRY.

139
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,325
AND STILL ED GILLESPIE LOST.

140
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:38,026
12% OF THE VOTERS IN THAT

141
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,795
ELECTION HAD NEVER VOTED IN A

142
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:40,596
GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION BEFORE US

143
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,030
OF THE DEMOCRATS ARE VERY GOOD

144
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,599
AT FIGURING OUT WHERE TO GO AND

145
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,467
REGISTER NEW VOTERS AND GETTING

146
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:46,768
THEM TO THE POLLS.

147
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:47,936
NO MATTER WHAT THE ECONOMIC

148
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:49,571
RESULTS ARE, THEY CAN GET THEIR

149
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:52,841
PEOPLE TO THE POLLS MORE THAN

150
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:53,909
REPUBLICANS.

151
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:57,746
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE VOTER FRAUD.

152
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,948
[LAUGHTER]

153
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:02,351
>> Juan: BY THE WAY, EXPECT TO

154
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:04,720
PLUS NINE IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATS

155
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,721
FOR A GENERIC PREFERENCE.

156
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:08,524
GREG, I WAS LOOKING AT THE POLLS

157
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:09,725
AND, OF COURSE PEOPLE WHO LIKE

158
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:10,726
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY THAT ECONOMY

159
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:13,395
IS THEIR NUMBER ONE REASON FOR

160
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,530
LIKING PRESIDENT TRUMP.

161
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,132
SO I SAID, WHAT DO PEOPLE --

162
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:19,101
BECAUSE HE'S STILL UNDERWATER,

163
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,137
44 OR 45% APPROVE.

164
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:22,604
51% DISAPPROVE.

165
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:26,742
SO I SAID WHY DO PEOPLE

166
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:28,010
DISAPPROVE OF A PRESIDENT THAT

167
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,381
GREG AND JESSE AND KIMBERLY LOVE

168
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:32,815
SO MUCH?

169
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,216
>> AND DANA.

170
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:36,418
>> Juan: THE NUMBER ONE REASON

171
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,519
THAT PEOPLE DISAPPROVE IS HE

172
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,088
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.

173
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,123
NUMBER TWO, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

174
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,925
TEMPERAMENT FOR THE JOB, NUMBER

175
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,693
THREE, HE'S DIVISIVE AND RACIST.

176
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:45,694
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

177
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:48,330
>> I THINK YOU JUST POST A

178
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,366
QUESTION THAT YOU WANTED TO

179
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,333
EXPRESS YOUR OWN OPINIONS

180
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:51,934
WITHIN.

181
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,535
YOU KNOW YOU ARE LOSING,

182
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,371
DEMOCRATS ARE LOSING WHEN YOU

183
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,705
ARE MARKING LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

184
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,941
SO THIS WEEK YOU ARE MOCKING LOW

185
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,211
AND EMPLOYMENT, LAST WEEK YOU

186
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,345
WERE DEFENDING MS-13.

187
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,947
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT,

188
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,549
COME OUT IN FAVOR OF MEASLES?

189
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,518
