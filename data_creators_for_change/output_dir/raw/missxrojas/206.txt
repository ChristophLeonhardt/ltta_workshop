1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
when I was in secondary school towards

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,639
the end I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a severe case of</font>

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,410
arachnophobia due to some traumatic

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,420
spider related incidents that left me

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,639
unable to even say the word spider or

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,260
hear the word spider and soon my

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,730
household who called them Daleks just

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,049
cuz I couldn't I couldn't deal with the

9
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,759
word I couldn't deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> aranea which i</font>

10
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,529
think is even worse a flashy but before

11
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:17,940
that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was very very little the</font>

12
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,230
thing I feared the most with people

13
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,150
breaking into the house people with guns

14
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,580
people chasing the kidnapping me wanting

15
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kill me that sort of stuff is very</font>

16
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,550
big and dark and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I discussed</font>

17
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,140
that in a video before in both these

18
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases and both these fears and with so</font>

19
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,009
many others throughout my life like when

20
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,480
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very worried about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not getting the</font>

21
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,489
right grades or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into any</font>

22
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,950
universities at all etc etc etc I really

23
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,420
fixated on them got really obsessed with

24
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and thought played out all these</font>

25
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,390
different thought experiments and

26
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,640
scenarios related to them that was my

27
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,590
minds way of coping but it also trapped

28
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,270
me within it and that wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pleasant</font>

29
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,980
at all I mean it's a pattern<font color="#CCCCCC"> that still</font>

30
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,230
happens but not in the same way and not

31
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,180
necessarily around the same things I

32
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,530
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation with one of</font>

33
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,820
my friends from school which we were

34
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,079
talking about what would you get rid of

35
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,670
if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some me out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

36
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,350
wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight away just for your</font>

37
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,719
personal happiness and comfort and put

38
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,670
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a distant planet or would</font>

39
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,560
that be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for me the answer was</font>

40
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,240
spiders and that was my go-to answer

41
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,619
every time we had this<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation but</font>

42
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,659
one day I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> woke up I had this</font>

43
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,720
thought if we follow the spiders on one

44
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,130
planet then that would mean that there's

45
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,110
a planet of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spiders and that's even</font>

46
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,939
more terrifying and that could be like

47
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,920
it's more like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bubble where</font>

48
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,170
even if they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

49
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,330
communicate which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they develop</font>

50
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,150
and evolve there would be some sets of

51
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,460
things any worse than just saw this

52
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,200
infestation it would just be horrible

53
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,640
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> flashing back and forward</font>

54
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,070
in this video so bear with me so I don't

55
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,299
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you guys are probably</font>

56
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,860
seen an evolution in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that I</font>

57
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,680
reacted to things I was unhappy about in

58
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,619
terms of like the bigger discussions

59
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,630
about racism and sexism and all that

60
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,180
stuff I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

61
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,619
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> younger I definitely lashed out a</font>

62
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,960
lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> straightaway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just got very</font>

63
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">angry and cottage to other downwards now</font>

64
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,009
I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take them a bit more reasoned</font>

65
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,020
about these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a bit more open</font>

66
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,189
to the idea that may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

67
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,780
solution isn't showing someone out and

68
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">shake them down first thinking about</font>

69
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of the plant spiders thing</font>

70
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,970
because I came to the realization

71
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,740
that if you keep like shutting people

72
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,050
out you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with you not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just in</font>

73
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,880
terms of like shutting them out straight

74
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,680
away but more like trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reason with</font>

75
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,030
them trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a conversation with</font>

76
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,770
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> plays frustrating conversations</font>

77
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,330
when the other person just isn't open to

78
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,890
anything you're saying if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

79
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,720
these conversations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you shut</font>

80
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,750
them out you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of often end up with a</font>

81
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,060
plan up despite a scenario where you

82
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,900
have this big divide and you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

83
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> echo chamber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and maybe within the</font>

84
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,900
echo chamber the conversation so

85
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,700
incredible and you're learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot for</font>

86
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,760
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around you but it's so</font>

87
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,020
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something stagnant about that I</font>

88
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's something that doesn't</font>

89
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,959
quite work which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why now using this</font>

90
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">space is can be really safe and</font>

91
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful when you feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit kind of</font>

92
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,630
vulnerable and I'm happy or<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when</font>

93
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,950
you don't feel honorable having the

94
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,990
support of other people often do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

95
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">think like you is actually quite a nice</font>

96
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,010
thing there's a mainly just thought

97
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,140
spaces and I'm open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to having four</font>

98
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,450
outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these spaces I see my role</font>

99
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,280
more generally is elevating the things

100
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,160
that work rather than dismissing or

101
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,720
shutting down the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't I</font>

102
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,160
find more than not especially now

103
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,350
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how easy it is to see</font>

104
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything that everyone said and kind</font>

105
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,830
of had this like running transcript of

106
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,620
every mistake anyone's made or

107
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,060
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone said leader it seems a</font>

108
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,360
mistake yeah I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

109
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,739
completely shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone down and dismiss</font>

110
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,360
some of that if we keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a ton</font>

111
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,340
tality we do create a plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the spider</font>

112
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,350
scenario because a lot of what we're

113
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,570
seeing isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mall for critical thought</font>

114
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,489
all about critical thought but I feel

115
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we're seeing is in</font>

116
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,670
critical thought because we're focusing

117
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,430
on individuals rather than how all the

118
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,830
bits and pieces came together within our

119
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,250
society to make that situation real as a

120
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,769
mayor one we're using smaller things

121
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,870
which are problems but some more things

122
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,480
distract us from the bigger problems

123
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,739
because there's bigger problems feel so

124
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,410
overwhelming<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you thought you can't</font>

125
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,970
make any changes within them another

126
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,190
time when I was lashing out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people</font>

127
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,200
it was because there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

128
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,730
myself that<font color="#E5E5E5"> either I didn't quite</font>

129
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,430
understand or I really regretted saying

130
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,500
or behaving like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past I think you</font>

131
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,760
really have to experience that process

132
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,519
of moving out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that or moving through</font>

133
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,488
it more accurately to get um I don't

134
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">know somewhere else as much</font>

135
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,949
it's horrifying I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to share</font>

136
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,349
the plan up the spiders weave thought

137
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,599
because for me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been incredibly</font>

138
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,659
helpful and it also just makes me stop

139
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,490
and think for a second I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> no video</font>

140
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,930
not too long ago that I also don't

141
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,909
really take crap anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's true</font>

142
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,159
but I feel like not taking crap isn't

143
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,590
equivalent to<font color="#CCCCCC"> way with words like</font>

144
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,180
knee-jerk reactions it's not quite the

145
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,159
same thing the adulthood adventures

146
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,590
continue I will see you guys on

147
00:04:46,590 --> 00:00:00,000
Wednesday bye damn right
