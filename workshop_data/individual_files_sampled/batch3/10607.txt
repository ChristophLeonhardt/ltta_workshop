the world gearing up for New Year's Eve Germany has come up with a new way to ensure security safe zones for women are being set up at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate party it comes in response to a mass of sexual assaults at celebrations two years ago in Cologne Artie's Maria for national gauging reaction in the German capital just like it New Year celebrations the world over hundreds of thousands of people are expected to flock to this place here in Berlin to see at the old and ringing the new you can see preparations are currently undergoing but keeping everyone safe without spoiling the atmosphere is a huge challenge for the authorities and this here organisers I go in one step further aside from usual safety barriers and alcohol bans and so-called women's safety area is being set up it's a zone where female guests who feel sexually harassed and just uncomfortable can get special help it's been meant by members of German Red Cross and comes in response to events two years ago back then hundreds of women were sexually assaulted at new year carnivals they were groped robbed intimidated and separated from their friends according to leaked police documents there were more than one thousand cases reported in Cologne in Hamburg alone more than two thousand men were ported ly involved most of them asylum seekers the new idea of the women's safety area has received a mixed reaction that's a good idea many people feel like need help but they don't know who to ask - and having this service is kind of nice I think sexual harassment was people were in groups and you were so how or do you get from here to the safe place I mean it seems a bit far-fetched I don't think it's such a good idea it's to me it sounds it's a bit like an alley be set up like a woman I feel afraid but this is assistive it's good to think because it's needed unfortunately it's kind of interesting that they do it in the new years as an event because I think it would be better if it's like a long longitude like Tudor like the thing not just like one thing that you do versus pressure because I don't know it sounds a little commercial in a way Berlin Police has also issued recommendations for those who are planning to come here for New Year celebrations including avoiding aggressive groups paying attention when someone gets too close and in case of any danger reporting to police marine ocean RT from Berlin aft party member in the Berlin Parliament Frank Hansel believes instead of safe zones for women its migration policies that need rethinking we feel that there is a new step of danger coming into our country we've seen it since we have to already build walls against our Christmas markets this is a development we do not want to see really policy should change we should not continue to have this mass migration of illegal mass migration we do have we have to count and see who the people are who came to our country we have to register them this is a process which has not been come to an end and we must close the borders in in order to have a stable society you can go much further than the security forces or the politicians in Germany go so that's a problem and that I think this is not a good sign for the new year to come
