ON
TUESDAY NORTH KOREA CLAIMED TO
HAVE CARRIED OUT ONE OF ITS MOST
SUCCESSFUL MISSILE TESTS BACK IN
THE 1990S.
IN THIS CASE IT WAS
THE FIRST TEST OF A MISSILE
CAPABLE OF STRIKING IN THEIR
WORDS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
THAT PART IS STILL UP FOR
DEBATE.WHAT THEY 
MEAN THERE IS
IT WAS PURPOSEFULLY FIRED AT AN
ELEVATED ALTITUDE SO THERE
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A CHANCE THAT
MANY COUNTRIES WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED.
BUT
THEORETICALLY IT COULD HAVE.
IF
THAT RANGE COULD BE REACHED, IT
IS AN INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC
MISSILE.
IF IT HAD THAT RANGE IT
COULD NOT ACTUALLY HIT THE VAST
MAJORITY OF AMERICAN STATES.
THIS IDEA THAT IT COULD STRIKE
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IS
RIDICULOUS.
IT COULD STRIKE A
NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE
REGION, OBVIOUSLY SOUTH KOREA,
JAPAN, WHICH IT CAN ALREADY
REACH.
SOME US BASES COULD BE
STRUCK BY THIS NEW TYPE OF
MISSILE.
WHAT COULD IT ACTUALLY
PUT ON ONE OF THESE MISSILES?
NORTH KOREA HAS CLAIMED IT CAN
PUT A HEAVY WARHEAD ON THE
MISSILE THAT COULD SURVIVE THE
EXTREME TEMPERATURE OF REENTRY
WHICH IS OVER 16,000°.
SO THEY
SAY THEY CAN, BUT IT IS BELIEVED
THAT THEY ARE LYING.
IT WOULD BE
TOO HEAVY AND THEY DON'T HAVE
THE MINIATURIZATION TECHNOLOGY
CAPABLE OF PUTTING A SMALLER
NUKE ONTO THIS MISSILE.
MANY
ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT WITHIN
FIVE YEARS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
DO THAT.
FOR ALL OF THE
LIMITATIONS AND GRANDSTANDING,
THIS IS SCARY AND IS A NEW
THRESHOLD THEY HAVE NOT
PASSED BEFORE.
>> BEFORE WE GET ONTO TRUMP'S
REACTION – FIRST WHEN THEY SAID
IT COULD HIT ANYWHERE IN THE
WORLD I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME
CHANCE NORTH KOREANS BELIEVED
THE WORLD WAS ABOUT 5000 MILES.
SO THAT IS WHY IT IS HARD TO
TRUST NORTH KOREANS BECAUSE THEY
PUT ON INSANE PROPAGANDA.
SO IT
IS HARD TO TAKE THEM AT FACE
VALUE.
I THINK THEY CAN PUT A
NUKE ON IT NOW.
BUT IT IS DEEPLY
CONCERNING THAT THEY ARE NOW
HAVING ICBMS.
>> THIS IS A SCARY TOPIC, BUT
ALSO INCREDIBLY INTERESTING.
ONE
OF MY FAVORITE STATS ABOUT ICBMS
IS THAT DURING REENTRY AS IT IS
THE SORT THAT THE US USES, IT
CAN BE TRAVELING UPWARDS OF MACH
21 WHICH IS 4 1/2 MILES A
SECOND.
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
IMAGINE IF WE WERE NOT PUTTING
ALL OF OUR BEST MINDS INTO
DESTROYING EACH OTHER?
WHAT
COULD BE ACCOMPLISH.
IT IS NOT
BELIEVE THAT NORTH KOREA HAS THE
CAPABILITY TO DO THIS SORT OF
MISSILE WITH SOLID FUEL.
IT CAN
BE A COMPONENT OF THE MISSILE,
JUST LEAVE IT AND THAT MEANS
THAT IF SOME SORT OF CONFLICT
DEVELOPS A NUCLEAR WAR ERUPTS
YOU CAN LAUNCH MISSILES.
WE
HAVE THAT CAPABILITY.
A LIQUID
FUEL MISSILE HAS TO BE FUELED
RIGHT BEFORE FIRE, WHICH MEANS
IT TAKES TIME.
YOU CAN'T RESPOND
AS QUICKLY TO MILITARY CONFLICT
THAT IT ALSO MEANS DURING THE
PROCESS USED TO PROTECT THE
MISSILE BY SEEING BY BEING SEEN
BY SATELLITES.
A FEW MORE
REASONS TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS
SCARED, BUT THOSE HURDLES CAN
EVENTUALLY BE OVERCOME.
>>I'M REALLY NOT CONVINCED THEY
COULD HIT ALASKA.
THIS GUY
FAMOUSLY SAYS HE SOMETIMES HAS
TROUBLE MAKING THE TOILETS
FLUSHING.
THE MISSILE THEY FIRED
TO BLOWUP ALASKA WILL PROBABLY
BLOWUP IN THE MIDDLE AND HIT
HELSINKI.
SEE MY POINT?
YOU CAN
DO UNTOLD DAMAGE.
LET'S
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT APPARENTLY
NORTH KOREANS ALSO WATCH TYT.
>> WE HAD SOME MISSILE TESTS
EARLIER ON THIS YEAR AND DONALD
TRUMP SAID THAT IF NORTH KOREA
TESTS AND ICBM, THERE WILL BE
HELL TO PAY.
SO THEY HAVE DONE
IT, OUR MILITARY ACKNOWLEDGES
IT.
HERE IS HIS RESPONSE – ON
TWITTER OF COURSE.
>>COME ON, FIRST OF ALL EVEN
THOUGH I DON'T LIKE TO GIVE
CREDIT BUT I DID NOTICE
YOUR RETWEET OF HIM.
YOU ARE ON TWITTER AND WATCH
CABLE NEWS 24 SEVEN.
GLASSHOUSE HERE.
>>DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT
AND MODERN PRESIDENTIAL IS YOU
APPARENTLY ACT AS THOUGH YOU ARE
A STEREOTYPICAL TV SOPHOMORE IN
HIGH SCHOOL.
>> I THINK IT IS A REALLY BAD
IDEA BUT IF YOU ARE A DICTATOR
THAT RUNS GULAGS, PROBABLY A
GREAT IDEA.
>> I JUST HAVE TO REMIND YOU,
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT THAT
PEOPLE SUPPORT BECAUSE HE IS
STRONG.
IF THEY DO MOVE ON NORTH
KOREA, DON'T MOVE ON HER LIKE A
BITCH.
THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY.
>>MAYBE CHINA WILL BUY NORTH
KOREA SOME FURNITURE.
>>YOU CAN GET A LOT DONE WITH
SOME FURNITURE.
>>AND THE TAPES HE SAID HE MOVED
ON HER LIKE A BITCH BY BUYING
HER FURNITURE – THIS WAS THE
ANCHOR.
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK, SHE
WAS MARRIED AND WASN'T
INTERESTED IN THE FURNITURE.
BUT
I DO AGREE WITH THEM THAT CHINA
IS PLAYING US.
I SAID THAT FROM
THE DAY TRUMP MET CHINA.
>>WHAT HE IS REFERENCING THERE
IS THAT APPARENTLY HE HAS SOME
SORT OF INFORMATION ABOUT TRADE
GOING UP BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND
CHINA AND SAYS THAT IS HIM
PLAYING US.
THEORETICALLY
DIPLOMATICALLY HAVING INCREASED
DIPLOMATIC TIES BETWEEN TWO
COUNTRIES CAN BE A GOOD THING
BECAUSE IT LOWERS THE CHANCE OF
WAR.
I DOUBT WE WILL BE ABLE TO
ESTABLISH THAT WITH NORTH KOREA.
BUT IT IS NOT A BAD THING IN
TERMS OF DIPLOMACY.
SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS IS THE ONLY
INFORMATION WE HAVE FROM DONALD
TRUMP – FROM HIS TWITTER.
WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF
NUCLEAR WAR.
AT SOME POINT WE
HAVE TO USE THE INFORMATION WE
HAVE.
HE'S NOT THE ONLY PERSON
FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT
RESPONDED TO THE MISSILE TEST.
THE GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THAT
REGION, US FORCES OF THAT
REGION, SAID THIS.
SAYING THAT
SELF-RESTRAINT IS THE ONLY THING
STOPPING US FROM ATTACKING NORTH
KOREA AT THIS POINT.
THAT IS
STRONG AND ALSO SCARY.
IT CAME
AFTER MILITARY EXERCISE BETWEEN
THE US AND SOUTH KOREA WITHIN 10
MILES OF THE DMZ.
WHERE WE ALSO
FIRED MISSILES INTO THE OCEAN.
APPARENTLY IT IS A RACE TO SEE
WHO CAN FILL UP THE OCEAN WITH
MORE MISSILES.
THERE IS REASON
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT NORTH
KOREA IS DOING AND WHETHER THEY
CAN FIRE A NUKE AT US TODAY, OR
IN FIVE YEARS.
I WOULD SAY FIVE
YEARS IS STILL WITHIN A POSSIBLE
SECOND TERM OF DONALD TRUMP.
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER DURING THE
NEXT ELECTION.
>> IF HE IS AROUND FOR THAT.
I AGREE WITH HIM THAT THE
CORRECT PATH IS TO PRESSURE
CHINA.
I'M NOT SURE IT SHOULD BE IN THE
FORM OF TWEETS.
>>OR IN THE FORM OF DONALD
TRUMP.
>> I WOULD MUCH RATHER THEY DO
THAT THEN GO TO THE MILITARY
OPTION.
YES, FIND A BETTER WAY
TO PRESSURE CHINA BECAUSE
APPARENTLY THE FIRST TIME WHEN
YOU JUST TOOK THEIR WORD FOR IT
WAS NOT MUCH OF A " DEAL."
YOU ARE JUST AN IDIOT THAT
BELIEVED THE CHINESE LEADER.
>> HE SAID THEY WOULD GIVE US A
GOOD DEAL.
>> THERE IS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE
HE THOUGHT TWEETING TO CHINA WAS
DOING SOMETHING.
>>THE LAST PART THAT IS SCARY IS
THAT SELF-RESTRAINT IS THE ONLY
THING STOPPING US FROM THIS WAR.
THE GUY IN CHARGE OF OUR
COUNTRY, NOT WELL KNOWN FOR
SELF-RESTRAINT.
THAT IS WHAT
SCARES ME ABOUT TRUMP AND I HAVE
SET IT FROM DAY ONE.
THE ISSUE I
AM MOST CONCERNED ABOUT TRUMP
BEING IN CHARGE IS NORTH KOREA.
MIKE PENCE WOULD DO TAX CUTS FOR
THE RICH AND WOULD REPEAL OBAMA
CARE AND WHAT DO ALL THOSE
THINGS JUST AS MUCH AS TRUMP
WORD BUT HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T
GET US INTO AN ASININE WAR WITH
NORTH KOREA.
HE WOULD GET US
INTO A WAR WHERE HIS FRIENDS
WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY.
NOBODY IS
MAKING MONEY FROM NORTH KOREA,
EVERYBODY IS DYING.
BUT THE GUY
IN CHARGE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF
SELF-RESTRAINT AND DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT.
HE HAD TO HAVE THE CHINESE
LEADER EXPLAIN IT TO HIM IN
OFFICE.
