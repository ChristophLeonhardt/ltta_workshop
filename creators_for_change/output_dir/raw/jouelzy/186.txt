00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,360
and light a match or shut a few

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,980
insecurities and picked up some new ones

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the way I took risks and build</font>

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,260
character I lived in a circle of

00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,270
inspiration because I believe that smart

brown girl could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a thing I allowed</font>

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,720
myself the space to embrace my

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,970
vulnerabilities and hurt like hell I was

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,160
so worth it I like the wrong guy gave a

00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,960
buck way too much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my emotional space</font>

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,150
but walked away proud without looking

realize they weren't worth losing and

21
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,750
found their love again I met plenty of

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,940
the wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> people reminded that if I</font>

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,159
dwell on negativity it would manifest in

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,530
real life exposing me to the opposite of

25
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,320
the joy I deserve I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not take</font>

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,200
of cancer and Capricorn to make it to

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,060
South Africa sat on the Prime Meridian

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,490

grew I made decisions through

34
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,259
insecurities I learned I lived without

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,420
explaining because plenty discarded I

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,700
cried because I deserve<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>
