THE CHOICE IS CLEAR, FLORIDA, GILLUM WILL RUIN YOUR STATE. YOUR SAFETY, YOUR SECURITY, YOUR ECONOMY, ARE ON THE LINE IN 14 DAYS, TO GO WEEKS FROM, YOU DECIDE MAXINE WATERS, ADAM SCHIFF, AND ALL CHAIR COMMITTEES, IF YOU WANT THOSE PEOPLE HOLDING THE TRUMP AGENDA HOSTAGE, VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT IS A VOTE FOR ANY OF THE PEOPLE YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN PIER JOINING US NOW, RNC CHAIRWOMAN RONNA McDANIEL'S WITH US, THE AUTHOR OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLER, THE DEEP STATE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR JASON CHAFFETZ. WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY WIN? THOSE PEOPLE BECOME CHAIRMAN. YOU HAVE TO REFER TO MAXINE WATERS AS CHAIRMAN. AND ADAM SHIFT WILL DISPLACED DEVIN NUNES. AND ALL OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THAT YOU SEE JIM JORDAN AND MARK MEADOWS AND RADCLIFFE AND GAUDI, THOSE GO AWAY, BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO DISMISS THOSE AND YOU WILL GET ELIJAH CUMMINGS AND YOU WILL GET JERRY NADLER, THE POWER OF SUBPOENA TO GO AFTER THIS ADMINISTRATION DAY AFTER DAY. Sean: RONNA McDANIEL'S, I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE SENATE. I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL, AS I DO ABOUT THE HOUSE. 82 PERCENT CHANCE THE REPUBLICANS KEEP THE SENATE, 86 PERCENT CHANCE THEY LOSE THE HOUSE BUT HE WAS LONG AND 2016, IS IRAN TONIGHT? I THINK HE IS WRONG, SEAN. THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS BLUE WAVE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE ARE NOT SEEING IT. WE ARE NOT SEEING IT IN THE EARLY VOTING IN FLORIDA, NEVADA, STATES THAT WE ARE ALREADY SEEING RESULTS COME IN, AND CERTAINLY ON THE SENATE SIDE, WE ARE SEEING LEADS OPEN UP IN NORTH DAKOTA AND MISSOURI AND INDIANA, SO THERE IS GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO PICK UP SEATS, BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, WE HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. WHAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE LOSE THE HOUSE, I KNOW IT IS NOT HALLOWEEN YET, BUT A SHIVER JUST WENT DOWN MY SPINE. WE HAVE TWO GET ALL OF OUR VOTERS OUT THERE. IT IS NOT A DONE DEAL, THE DEMOCRATS ARE ENERGIZED, THE ONLY WAY WE KEEP THE HOUSE IS IF WE GET OUR VOTERS OUT PAIRED TALK TO YOUR FAMILY, TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS. GET EVERYONE OUT TO THE POLLS. WE ARE FIGHTING FOR OUR FUTURE. WE KNOW WHAT NANCY PELOSI MEANS PAY HIGHER TAXES, ABOLISH I.C.E., OPEN BORDERS, ADMIRING OUR COUNTRY DOWN AN INVESTIGATION AFTER INVESTIGATION. Sean: KEEP OBAMACARE, THAT IS NOT A RADICAL AGENDA, JASON CHAFFETZ BIT NO, IT IS THERE THAT WANT TO RAISE TAXES, ABOLISH I.C.E., THEY WANT THE OPEN BORDERS, THEY DON'T ANNOUNCE ANY OF THE VIOLENCE, THEY STAND FOR THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT, THEY WANT SCORCHED EARTH. THEY ARE GOING TO DELIVER WHAT THEY ARE PROMISING. WE SHOULD BELIEVE THEM. Sean: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, THEY ARE NOT TELLING THEIR AGENDA. MAXINE, SCIOSCIA, EVEN JOHN PODESTA, DON'T TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION. NOT ONE DEMOCRAT TALKS ABOUT THE CARE OF AND HEADING TO THE SOLAR BORDER BECAUSE THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS, SUPPORT AMNESTY, CENTURY CITIES AND STATES. THAT IS WHAT THEY REALLY WANT, BUT THEY ARE NOT SAYING IT. PHIL BREDESEN GOT CAUGHT CALLING THE PEOPLE OF TENNESSEE IGNORANT, WE KNOW THAT McCASKILL GOT CAUGHT SAYING, I'M ANTIGUN, ALL PRO EVERYTHING OBAMA BELIEF. HEIDI HEITKAMP'S STAFF THINK SHE WILL BE A SUPER LIBERAL. THANK GOD ProjectVeritas.com GOT THE STATE. THEY ARE THE LIARS. PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVERED ON PROMISES FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, BE OF DEMOCRAT OR DEMOCRAT CAUGHT IN A LINE. RUNNING ON ONE THING, SAYING ELECT ME, AND THEN I GET THERE, I'LL GOVERN WITH CHUCK SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI. NANCY PELOSI HAS SAID VERY CLEARLY, YOU HAVE A FREE PASS, RUN AGAINST ME, SAY YOU WON'T VOTE FOR ME FOR SPEAKER, BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN YOU COME HOME, YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR NANCY PELOSI, WHICH WOULD BE A DISASTER.
