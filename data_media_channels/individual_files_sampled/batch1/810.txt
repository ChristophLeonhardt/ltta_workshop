making his debut in the United States the Saudi Crown Prince promotes a vision of reform for his country but his foreign policies have left the Gulf divided and Yemen on the brink of famine what impression is Mohammed bin Salman making in the international stage this is inside story hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle Sandy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is on a charm offensive in the United States as he meets US leaders and signs major business deals bin Salman is promoting himself as a social and economic reformer reinventing his kingdom for the modern era it's part of his first major foreign trip having just wrapped up a visit to the UK but since his rise to power the Crown Prince has been a controversial figure a Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen has contributed to one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and reports have also emerged of a plan to reshape the political map of the Middle East and fracture the Gulf Cooperation Council Allen Fisher has more on a secret meeting of Arab leaders on a yacht in the Red Sea organised by Lebanese American businessman it's claimed George NIDA organized the power summit late in 2015 five middle-east leaders were on the guest list there was Mohammed bin Salman then deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Zayed the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-sisi the crown prince of Bahrain Prince Salman new King Abdullah of Jordan Middle East I says leader urged them to create a new power bloc in the Middle East to combat Turkey and Iran and he would lobby for them in Washington Libya was to join the group later its alleged nadir a convicted pedophile was told they liked the idea but was at the meeting were concerned that as the u.s. presidential election was moving into high gear Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would protect the Iran nuclear deal and would be less keen to abandon old alliances but the meeting thought that Republican candidate Donald Trump might be more likely to support their initiative we have seen for the last nine months that there has been a new alliance that has emerged between the United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia Egypt and with Bahrain as a junior party as a junior partner and what or not that alliance can't sustain itself in a long run that is unclear but there are certainly efforts to boost that alliance at the expense of the Gulf Cooperation Council it was reported that King Abdullah of Jordan brief congressional leaders in the US the turkey was the main regional factor stability but he later allegedly fell foul of the group for not fully supporting the blockade against Qatar which is no 10 months old and Jordan voted against Donald Trump's controversial move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel this block that has so to speak emerges is not a block that can implement and carry out actual policy and what we have seen us that the u.s. prefers bilateral relationships with each of the six GCC countries and therefore unity is essential neither is being investigated as a possible key link between Donald Trump and the Emiratis and to see if there was an attempt to buy influence by indirectly sending money to the Trump presidential campaign leader also arranged the meeting in Trump Tower in December 2016 that brought together trump's son-in-law and key advisor Jared Kushner then chief strategist Steve Bannon and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi he was also at a second meeting in the Seychelles which brought together significant Trump donor Eric Prince and this man Carol Demetria a Russian banker with close links to President Vladimir Putin several embassies were approached for comment on the Middle East eyes allegations no one provided any reaction Alan Fisher al Jazeera so Mohammed bin Salman is now on the international stage it became Saudi Crown Prince last year as in line to succeed his father as king bin Salman has promoted a range of reforms at home including easing restrictions on women's rights and a more open policy on entertainment and public performances and he's behind a major anti-corruption Drive targeting the Saudi elite critics say the campaign also removes domestic rivals the crown prince is also a vocal opponent of Iran in a recent interview he compared the country's supreme leader Adolf Hitler let's bring in our guests now and in Washington we have Joe McCarron policy analyst at the Arab Center Washington DC in Beirut Rami Khouri senior public policy fellow and adjunct professor of journalism at the American University of Beirut and in London Sami Hamdi editor-in-chief of international in Chester a warm welcome to all of you Joe Mohammed bin Salman he's spending nearly three weeks in the US an extremely long trip what's he doing there I mean he's trying to forge the relation with me with the White House this is the third meeting was with strong we have big changes in the Trampas position now he strike basically to make the case for the priority of Iran the priority of the changes is making at home why the early what the initial invitation was to focus on the GCC and the United to unite basically the front against Iran we have a new dynamic in that sense I think this the Saudis learned the lesson with Obama after the Arab Spring the Iran deal so they they pushed for to forge in relation with this rapid pressure to be more in their interest and now they are succeeding you have a trough he has a personal relation with with kushner and you have the US establishment basically trying to resist the cozy us-saudi relations where you have the larger US interests in the region so I'm not sure I mean even on the charm offensive here as you said in your introduction and but I'm not sure to what extent they can achieve together on the on the international stage and in the relation to the bilateral relation but this trying basically to forge versus first goal is to cement his legitimacy as a new ruler now he was u.s. recognition of this and second he wants to basically promote his idea of regional policy for all the US for a policy how it wants to align with the Saudis sure there's a lot of challenges in there in that sense absolutely we'll look at this at rummy the Saudi foreign minister says that relations with the US are at an all-time high but an interesting report in The Guardian newspaper that bin Salman has been warned by regional advisors to distance himself from Trump because he's a volatile leader do you think the crown prince is heeding that warning probably not he is embarking on an extraordinary trip that represents really the second phase of what started with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan which was the global triumph of entertainment and free market economies and now we're having this relationship expanded between the Saudis and the United States at least with Trump and the Saudi leadership into free markets entertainment and and the war industries which both countries are very focused on and he he doesn't particularly care about you know the political standing of Trump right now they assume and Saudi Arabia Trump is going to hang around in fact it's a sign of the vulnerability in the Saudi American relationship that it is Trump and Kushner who are the two critical elements in the relationship and but this is a sign of the fact that they're Saudis are are still quite amateurish in foreign policy they proved it in the region they're not proving it internationally but the triumph of public relations for them now is the key factor in this process that they've spent millions tens tens of millions on public relations advertising barring think-tanks barring journalists taking people on trips and this probably won't work but it gives them some breathing space people are intrigued by this there he's done some amazing things inside Saudi Arabia in terms of rapid change so it's too early to have a real picked on him but what we can see is the process that he's leading is a process that's largely based on autocratic change from the top war-making in the region threats and blockades and public relations internationally linked heavily to sales of arms sorry the Krampus has just been in the UK just following on from what Rami was saying that how successful has this charm offensive of the West been so far I think with regards to his visit to the UK I think it was a well-planned trip from the perspective that he took advantage of Teresa Mays desire to show the British public that she can bring in investment as a result of following her negotiations with the European Union I think also with regards to the trip to the UK I think it was more directed to a domestic audience within Saudi Arabia as opposed to winning anything really from the UK government remember that the perception of the UK in Saudi Arabia is still a country that is great still a country that has significant influence even if it is on the wane following the vote for Briggs it so I think when he sees Theresa May rolling at when the piece Saudi people see Theresa May rolling out the red carpet for Mohammed bin Salman that gives him a huge boost with inside you Rabia itself so I think the UK trip was mainly directed at the domestic audience with inside Arabia but the Washington trip is mainly directed to the US audience and not just to Donald Trump I heard the previous speaker talking about Trump and Kushner being the main pieces of the jigsaw which currently is true but I think part of this trip is to rectify that he's meeting James mattis who was a critic of the blockade on Qatar he's meeting security officials he's lobbying buying think tanks buying journalists only wish to cement himself and response Ali's influence on the institutions in the US and not just relying on Trump in other words it seems he's listened to the advice that was given in the Guardian that he should distance himself from Trump not necessarily distancing himself but in the sense that he is buying he's restoring the relations between Saudi Arabia and the u.s. that were there before Obama came into power which is very warm very close very on board with the Pentagon with the State Department and also with the presidency at I presume he be interested also in meeting Mike Pompeo of course he's nominated to be the next Secretary of State with Rex Tillerson out what difference Mike Pompeo bring to the relations because Tillison was very Pro Qatar when Saudi launched its blockade pushing Trump not to support bow Saudi in that yes just first out to the to the guest in London I think the difference now there's a little bit of reservation various establishment because most of the us-saudi communication is going through Kushner there's no basically record minutes of those cause nobody is knowing what's happening so there's a bit of frustration so they have to basically reach out not to make it a more private communication channel between bin Salman and Kushner have more the establishment evolve because when Trump leaves or when Kushner leaves at some point they have to deal again with the establishment which have a lot of reservation on Yemen on other points now to the port of Pompeyo I think the push to resolve the GCC issue gotta be weakened after Tillerson leave they will try I think Trump is gonna try to make bridges but eventually the Saudi made the signal this week they said it's not a priority for us and we can live with that of the long term and we prefer to have Kuwait continuous mediation instead of Trump so I think it's going to try to push but because not is not gonna force the Saudis to make a reconciliation okay so basically they try basically into two basic these appease things to but I don't see a big significant shift and becoming in the coming weeks just to pick up on what you were saying before about Krishna so being to the number one channel of communication with the Saudi Crown Prince is that still the case even when he's been downgraded in his standing in the White House it is because the president can't give him an exception to receive he prepared the strip he's is the key person now during this trip he's having three dinners was Kushner and he's not telling everybody on the in the administration what's happening he might make make big decision he might give some concessions or hints of concessions so nobody is really clear he's acting as a de facto secretary of state Tillerson has been much we have to see Pompeo now if you're gonna make more imbalance between their loyalty to trump and his is basically representing the interests of the State Department and the atomization overseas so after after further notice the downgrading of significance didn't affect he went to Mexico he went he met with the president without the US ambassador in Mexico so his continuing his trend of basically controlling a specific file related to the Arab the palestinian-israeli the Mexico file and the China he's still acting as if he is the number one charge without a real oversight from the National Security Council okay I mean that's a rummy if as J says Kushner is acting in sort of a de-facto Secretary of State should we still be on the lookout then for his deal so-called deal of the century between the Israelis in the past isn't gettin veiled well everybody is expecting something to come out of Washington soon but it's actually coming out of Tel Aviv Tel Aviv is driving this process and they've got Kushner and Trump to buy into an idea this outside in where you this Israelis make peace with many Arab countries especially in the Gulf and then that they all put pressure on the Palestinians and force on them a deal that could not possibly be accepted by by any reasonable diplomat or jurist or an international lawyer or anybody in the UN so that probably will happen and the Saudis will push for it a little bit but probably not very much because it said the deal as we know what we know about it now would never fly anywhere except maybe in Tel Aviv possibly in Riyadh possibly in Washington and you have leadership's in the Arab world that are desperate for foreign military support and economic support and therefore will go along with whatever the u.s. asks but public opinion they are a world is very very critical of what's going on including critical of the Palestinian leadership to a large extent so I wouldn't put any emphasis on the Palestinian Israel Israeli so-called deal of the century that the Americans are coming out with it's another sign the nature of American pro-israeli diplomacy which is now linked to Saudi and Emirati and a few other people in the region siding with the Americans and the Israelis and this is a sign of the terrible imbalance of power we have in the region and it won't last for very long but we have to put up with it for a while I mean how long do you think it will last for I think to be honest I think that we're talking a lot about Mohammed missile man's relationship with cush and his relationship with Donald Trump but let's also remember that it's not necessarily set in stone in the way that we're perhaps envisaging it I think we have to remember that Donald Trump has already called up the Emir of Qatar and invited him to Washington in April a sign of changing his mind over the blockade in Qatar this is seismic if we're talking if we are if we were assuming that the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump and Krishna in particular was very tight the reality is Trump is starting to change his mind and I think this is why Mohammed bin said man this visit is so fundamental for him you asked why is there for three weeks because Mohammed myths and men realizes that relying on Trump alone is not enough he needs to win over the u.s. institutions let's remember that in the beginning of the 2017 the CIA awarded the first ever prize for to a Saudi prince in recognition of combating terrorism but they gave it to Muhammad bin Nayef not Mohammed bin Salman and this was at a time when Mohammed bin Salman was maneuvering against Mohammed bin Nayef the Americans were saying to bin Salman we don't want you we won't Bonet if to be the crown prince we want him to become the future king so we have to remember that bin Salman is going to Washington on a PR offensive not just to establish a policy based on Trump and Jared Kushner but he needs to convince the Pentagon he needs to convince the CIA he needs to use pompiers influence in the CIA to this cause as well he needs to get the oil companies all of them on board and convince them that he is a better alternative than Muhammad bin Nayef and he is the best Prince there possible remember Mohammed bin Salman scuppered these American plans for bin Nayef so he needs to convince them that all of their calculations that they made that they can put them to one side and they can now rely on him so this is why if we talk about the israel-palestine deal going back just to answer that particular question question of yours about the israel-palestine and whether we can live with these circumstances I think when Kushner Muhammad mins and men made their agreement whereby bin Salman would pressure the Palestinians I don't think announcing Jerusalem was necessarily part of the deal because that's a deal breaker Saudi could have brought my mother best to the table with Israel on unfavorable terms if Trump had not announced Jerusalem as the capital of Israel now it's untenable for Saudi Arabia and it's untenable for bin Salman to come out publicly and support this initiative and I think because he is not established himself entirely in Saudi Arabia remember he's not King yet because he's not established in Saudi Arabia it's not a gamble worth taking and this is why this trip is so difficult for bin Sandman how do you appease Trump and appease the Pentagon and the peace the CIA and the peace Kushner and the peace the oil companies and still maintain your popular support within Saudi Arabia it seems an impossible task okay this is why we see this very lavish PR campaign hmm all that we Mohammed bin Salman he's got one very strong card to play hasn't it and that's this Iran public enemy number one line I mean in the CBS interview he pushed that strongly and that plays in very well with the White House's worldview of the Middle East it did but I just do to make it a small observation I mean the issue with Mohammed bin Salman and the Pentagon establishes mud that if he's gonna take power or not the issue is his policy he tried to turn around US policy in the region you saw what happened in Lebanon in Yemen and other places so the issue is more not with the character I'm not sure they have a problem with him ascending to power it's a fact now but but the problems was more his policy here has to readjust to realign more his policy to the to the u.s. policy now on your question yes he says this pain point Trump has this idea or heavy alliance between some of the GCC countries and Israel against Iran so he fits well in this but I'm not sure how much he can he can help because the Saudis cannot basically fight Iran and Syria they cannot fight it in Lebanon or in Iraq they have and they don't have the same money they had a decade or two decades ago to basically invest Trump we saw in the Washington Post he offered you know Saudi Arabia to have four billion in Syria I'm not sure they are willing to invest this money in a country that they don't own at this point so there are a lot of challenges but he the Saudi foreign minister mentioned the Iran nuclear deal which is you know for the hawkish part of the administration it's a very good progress for them but again the pentacle is very worried about cancelling the deal it has implications on US forces in Iraq and Syria so the point is the US and Saudi interests are not as much aligned as two or three decades ago it changed so Trump and and bin Salman now are going against the trend against the current of how the us-saudi relations have evolved in the last decade or more after the Arab Spring after the Iran nuclear deal after the S presence in the region so they are going against against this so we will see I think in the coming weeks a pushback from the Pentagon and the CIA on casting the Iran nuclear deal and its implication and now we saw the Saudis are more endorsing the Trump view so it's gonna be a very good we will see a bureaucratic war I think in the coming weeks after May 12 regarding the nuclear deal Ronnie how is a behind bin Salman viewed within Saudi Arabia is he seen and welcomed as a reformer or is he seen as a war monger for his foreign policies well the reports that we keep hearing and many of which are filtered through media that are paid or owned by the Saudis the reports are saying that a lot of young people most of them are happy with what he's doing and that's probably correct to liberalize their daily life their cultural life their woman driving cinemas things of that nature most probably young Saudis would would like that the problem that he's gonna run into is with the business establishment and parts of the religious establishment and parts of the royal family all of whom are very hesitant about the heavy-handed top-down rather brutal manner in which he put several hundred business people in jail and in the hotel in custody he hijacked the Lebanese Prime Minister for a few days he made a war in Yemen he blockaded Qatar he threatened the Palestinian Jordanian economies a lot of people in the establishment and in Saudi society are not very happy with the failures and the rather brutish nature of Saudi diplomacy in the region but internally a lot of the changes that he's doing are appealing to younger people but in the establishment the business community and and among some religious conservative people tribal people he's definitely going to have our position the problem is that our position cannot be expressed in any public way because he personally now oversees all the media he's so you know what he's done is controlled every single lever of power in Saudi Arabia the military political economic religious cultural everything media everything is in his control like it is with CC in Egypt and like it used to be with Saddam Hussein so he's got this new form of one-person government which we don't know what the Saudi people's verdict and that is and we won't know for a couple of years okay I saw me just in the last minute we've got much of this trip is the crown prince looking for deals with American companies he's got his eye on Saudi post-oil he desperately needs to diversify he does need to diversify but I think Saudi Arabia maintains its reputation I mean he's launched some ambitious projects he's got some renowned businessman to back him Masayoshi son of Japan and on all of these other various different business I don't think Saudi will have a problem in terms of getting that particular investment I think the problem that many people have is with Mohammed bin Sandman's arbitrary nature of governance I don't necessarily we're describing his policy of getting involved in Yemen in Lebanon I wouldn't necessarily call it policy as much as a knee-jerk reaction Yemen the Houthis were about to take over and Hezbollah and Mishelle Iran were about to form an alliance that would have meant Hezbollah would take complete control of Lebanon so I think these were knee-jerk reactions more than Patek policy but I think with regards to investment Saudi Arabia remains lucrative and as much as we talk about human rights and chaos and disaster Rockefeller said when there's blood on the streets there's money to be made and I think this is the mantra that many of these businessmen follow Mohammed bin Salman is opening up monopolies in the country for people he's announcing these ambitious projects he's promised that if the Americans won't come he'll get the Japanese he'll get the French he'll get the British he'll get whoever so I think he's making all these different walls fight each other for the Saudi Arabian economy he has the Aramco IPO which he's teasing New York with saying I might do New York I might do Singapore I might do Tokyo all of wish to see who will be the biggest bidder who will put the most money in Saudi Arabia from a very crude very cruel perspective it's quite clever whether he'll succeed or not as urami said earlier we need a few years before we can really gauge whether he's been successful or not absolutely is a very ambitious man in deal may thanks today for all our guests for joining us Joe McCarron Rami Khouri and Sami
