Donald Trump has a religious advisor if you can recall her name is Paula white and she is one of these people who has gotten incredibly wealthy through the prosperity gospel she essentially lies to a bunch of people and scams them into giving her a lot of money and 2018 is no exception she is now pushing for something known as firstfruits toys sounds really weird more wanted but I'll will explain what it is I'm trying not to let's not go off the rails here ok let's talk about what firstfruits really are so Paula White is urging her followers to donate a firstfruits offering of up to their entire salary for the month of January to enjoy blessings for the rest of the year or suffer the consequences of failing to follow God's command so here's what she told her parishioners each January I put God first and honor him with the first of our substance by sewing a firstfruits offering of one month's pay that is a big sacrifice but it is a seed for the harvest I am believing for in the coming year and God always provides what you better provide after you get a 12th of your salary the difference between and so she also differentiates between those who tithe and those who contribute for the first fruit also it's January right after the Christmas month when everybody spent more than they could probably afford I mean Wow okay so the difference between tithe this is her speaking the difference between tithe and first-fruit first fruit is all of it all of what well if you want to bring God all of one day salary one week salary or one month salary that's between you and God I try to bring a month's salary but at the very least every year I give God a week salary like she's trying to convince people to give her a significant portion of their pay and we're not talking about rich people like she's not hanging the Koch brothers and you know asking for you know maybe a thousand bucks at the beginning no she's yeah like these parishioners are not wealthy people and she's totally taking advantage of them she also says God claims the first of all things it rightfully belongs to him so why are you telling your parishioners to give you money because you're not God I know you think of yourself as God I mean she is just openly taking advantage of them they should all get together and decide to give their first route to another Church say alright we'll do it you got either way yeah she wouldn't love it that she's not after getting this other churches richer churches are tax exempt and as a result are supposed to be apolitical but she is obviously political she is in Donald Trump's camp and she's simultaneously scamming all these people out of money yeah see I think we need to be aware of her biases we're we're on the left so secular okay so it's easy to look at the prosperity gospel churches and say this stuff is just a scam it doesn't actually work and yet you've covered a lot of these prosperity gospel people the people who run these a lot of them have private jets obviously it's working this is how do you argue with the results and look I know that there are some members of the audience who think well if these people are not smart enough to avoid getting scammed then they're getting scammed that's on them but you got to remember religion for a lot of people is something that they turn to when they need hope and to know that they get exploited like this Minoo we should do what we can to help them not not criticize them or ridicule them or insult them like I like my mom she doesn't believe in prosperity preaching or anything like that but you know religion for her is hope it's it's you know that faith kind of keeps her going and in her darkest times that's what comforts her and I think a lot of religious people believe what they believe because of that and I feel terrible for anyone who falls victim to Paula White and her scammy ways yeah and also especially I not not to go over but because it subverts or coops like an actual a good impulse where you know some some of humanity not enough but some wants to help people and to give you know let's say with tithing to give 10% of your earnings to try to make people's lives better would be a good thing but if it's instead going to a church and if it's a church that doesn't actually use it for the community if it's just for the enrichment of the the religious leader then that's even worse because it doesn't doesn't just deprive people of their money it deprives people who need that money as charity from ever getting it right I mean you can be a total atheist in doing something like tithing going to an organization that deserves it that would be a great thing right but these are just these are sharks basically right it's it's money that goes towards someone who wants to live a lavish lifestyle and do yeah nothing positive or productive for Humanity and that's terrible what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole
