1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,639
THIS IS AN AMUSING STORY,
BECAUSE SOMEONE THOUGHT DONALD

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,570
TRUMP WASN'T LYING TO THEM.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,390
[LAUGHTER] IN THIS CASE IT

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,590
HAPPENS TO BE THE AUSTRALIAN
GOVERNMENT, A WHILE AGO HE MADE

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,099
A PROMISE TO THEM AND NOW COME
TO FIND OUT HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,119
NO, REALLY?

7
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,709
BUT THEY ARE
GENUINELY SURPRISED, WHICH

8
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:16,740
AMUSES ME.

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,530
HUFF POST
REPORTING HERE --

10
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:29,770
THEY ARE ACCUSING HIM OF THAT
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE, LET'S

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:45,460
GIVE YOU 
THE 

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,460
DETAILS --

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:55,940
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
TIMES I HAVE TO SAY THIS --

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,300
TRUMP DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING HE
SAYS.

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,920
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
FOR THIS.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,780
ONE IS HE'S A
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR, HE WILL TELL

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,600
YOU ONE THING IN ONE MINUTE,
FORGET A YEAR LATER, A MINUTE

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,040
LATER HE WILL TELL YOU THE
OPPOSITE.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,540
JUST YESTERDAY I DID A

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,390
STORY ON THE SHOW ABOUT HOW HE
CONTRADICTED HIMSELF WITHIN THE

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,960
SAME TWEET.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,110
SECOND OF ALL, HE
DOESN'T HAVE ANY PHILOSOPHY OR

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,190
PRINCIPLES.

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:26,100
SO WHAT IS HIS
GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY ON ALUMINUM

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,280
TARIFFS?

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,560
HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,240
SO
WHEN HE PROMISED TO THEM THAT HE

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,770
WOULD EXEMPT AUSTRALIA, WHAT WAS
THAT BASED ON?

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,770
WASN'T BASED ON A

31
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,260
PRINCIPLE OF WE WILL EXAMINE
ALLIES BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S

32
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,280
BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY OR BETTER
FOR FOREIGN POLICY, AND AMONG

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,759
THE ALLIES WILL BE AUSTRALIA,
THE U.K., ETC.?

34
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,759
NO, HE DIDN'T

35
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO IT.

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
YOU
KNOW WHY?

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,270
BECAUSE HE'S DUMB.

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,270
HE

39
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,560
DIDN'T THINK IF I GIVE AUSTRALIA
AN EXEMPTION I MIGHT HAVE TO

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,740
GIVE NEW ZEALAND ONE, IS THAT
GOING TO BE BASED ON REGIONS OR

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,020
ON ALLIES, HOW WILL I MAKE THOSE
DECISIONS?

42
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,420
NO, TURNBULL PROBABLY

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,479
GAVE HIM A COMPLIMENT, SAID HEY
MR.

44
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,659
PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE AWFULLY

45
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,430
LARGE HANDS, AND HE SAID THAT'S
IT, YOU ARE EXEMPT FROM THE

46
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,430
TARIFFS.

47
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,520
AND A YEAR LATER YOU
THINK IS GOING TO LISTEN TO

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
THAT?

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,569
NO, SOMEONE ELSE WILL COME
IN THE ROOM AND TELL HIM HE HAS

50
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,700
LARGE HANDS SO AUSTRALIA IS OUT.

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,120
NO ONE IS GETTING AN EXEMPT AND.

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,790
COMPANIES MIGHT, WHICH WILL LEAD
TO TERRIBLE CORRUPTION AS THEY

53
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,450
TRY TO CONVINCE THE GOVERNMENT
TO GIVE THEM EXEMPTIONS ONE BY

54
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,680
ONE IN A SYSTEM OF
INSTITUTIONALIZED CRONY

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,980
CAPITALISM, BUT THERE ARE NO
COUNTRYWIDE EXEMPTIONS, TRUMP IS

56
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,010
ALWAYS DIDN'T MEAN IT, WAS LYING
TO YOU, DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

57
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,010
THE HELL HE WAS SAYING.

58
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,230
SO TOM
MCILROY SAYS ON TWITTER HERE --

59
00:02:44,230 --> 00:03:06,599
YES, AND FACT AUSTRALIA, YOU
HAVE BEEN DUDDED, AS HAVE ALL OF

60
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,340
US.

61
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,629
THE AUSTRALIAN TRADE
MINISTER SAYS --

62
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,120
MMM.

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:23,980
I DO DECLARE, THAT ONE
STUNG.

64
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,010
IS DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

65
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,319
ADMINISTRATION TRUSTWORTHY?

66
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,550
OF
COURSE NOT, DON'T BE

67
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,140
PREPOSTEROUS.

68
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,860
AND I LIKE HOW
THEY GOT THEIR FEELINGS HURT.

69
00:03:31,860 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT FROM
DAY ONE.
