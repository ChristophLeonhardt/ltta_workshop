on Monday morning New York Daily News race centric columnist Shaun King posited a new change to the Constitution to oust Donald Trump he tweeted quote a few serious but wild questions one could the people of the United States somehow hold the vote now or in the next year to oust Donald Trump like a recall of some sort and then he also tweeted what other ways exist for the American people to legally oust an unethical president impeachment only we have long since crossed a point where real Donald Trump is so dishonest so unethical that it is truly dangerous for our democracy in layman's terms what would it take for the USA to pass a constitutional amendment for a president recall like California has for governor uh-huh apparently Shawn King was too busy tweeting to read the Constitution you know the document that answers this exact question many many times impeachment is the only constitutional way of ousting a sitting president of course unless Trump is declared mentally unfit for office under the 25th amendment by the VP and a majority of cabinet officers or of such other body as Congress provides by law but our constitutional system was designed to avoid the instabilities of parliamentary democracy with its constant votes of no confidence it's constant selections and shifting governmental powers as for revisions of the Constitution the Constitution also sets out how amendments work but that would require you know actually reading things it would also require Donald Trump to do something so bizarre that VP pence or House Republicans had no choice but to initiate Trump's elster he hasn't the left's hysteria right now is so over-the-top they can't even wait for Trump to implode for him to become unfit in their eyes he was unfit the day he won here is the truth Trump's Twitter feed is not a threat to the Republic his rhetoric may not be good for civil discourse but that's nothing new President Obama spent the last eight years undermining civic discourse and a far more sophisticated way than Trump does with his 140 character blasts and Obama undermine faith in the government far more than Trump has which is how Trump was able to sweep into the White House on the back of popular discontent the left can keep dreaming that Trump will just disappear or they can deal with reality so long as they do the former Trump will keep winning it looks like Trump's winning streak will probably continue on that basis but just as importantly the left's lack of care about basic civics is one of the reasons politics breaks down our system is actually pretty durable the founders created it that way but the left doesn't care about the system which is why the executive branch continues to accrue power civic ignorance leads to populism that favors powerful magog's if the left ever once read the Constitution and respected it there might be an actual shot at a government of by and for the people rather than an elected Oleg Archy every four years or so I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so tons to get to obviously Donald Donald Trump tweeted something and that set the world on fire and will talk about whether what he tweeted was accurate or inaccurate or whether it matters or if the media have completely lost their mind a lot to get to on that score but first let's say thank you to our sponsors over at Mack Weldon

nuts over the weekend why did everything go nuts over the weekend because unfortunately we now live in a world where when Donald Trump tweets things everybody takes it seriously and this is a silly world okay Donald Trump tweets LA to stuff and the stuff that he tweets is usually coming straight out of his butt okay Donald Trump just see stuff on TV and then he tweets it and that's not the end of the world that doesn't mean he's a bad president doesn't mean he will be a bad president means that he uses Twitter as some sort of diarrhea for Matt for him to just spew out his sauce and sometimes that's actually really useful because his thoughts are useful and sometimes his thoughts are not but to pretend that every tweet and is what the media is doing to pretend that every tweet that Donald Trump sent is some sort of reflection of internal Donald Trump administration policy or reflects the best available intelligence no no so here's what happens I don't Trump sends a series of tweets on Saturday morning he's all mad because he saw a story in Breitbart that was basically a synopsis of all of the various actions taken by the Obama administration and the DOJ in the run-up to the election and after the election with regards sort of the deep state going after Donald Trump and here's what he tweeted he tweeted terrible just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory nothing found this is McCarthyism is it legal for a sitting president to be wiretapping the president prior to an election turned down right in the mini and the new tweets let me let me find the exact text because hard to see here a little bit he says turn down the the turned down by court is new low right and then he tweeted also I bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October just prior to election he said how low has President Obama gone to tap to Peas my phone during the very sacred election process this is Nixon Watergate bad or sick guy sweet all this out and everybody loses their mind right and then like an hour and a half later he tweets out Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving The Apprentice he was fired by his bad pathetic ratings not by me sad end to great show I the reason I add that last tweet is because this is how Donald Trump tweets gang okay just get used to it Donald Trump is not tweeting the best available Intel available from his Intel community he's not tweeting government secrets he's tweeting whatever comes into his head which I kind of like in some ways because it means we know what he's thinking and in some ways I think while he's the president he probably shouldn't be doing that but this raises a bunch of questions everybody loses their mind so we'll answer the first question first the first question is is Donald Trump correct is in fact did Obama order him to be surveilled did Obama order his wires to be tapped so that specific charge is wildly overblown he had specific charges wildly overblown Marco Rubio was on one of the TV shows and he says that he's not sure exactly what Trump is talking about the Trump made this very serious allegation you're on the Senate Intelligence Committee do you have any evidence at all to suggest that President Trump is stating something factual here by that you mean the tweet yesterday about the President Obama yes yeah so obviously I have no I'm not sure what it is he is talking about perhaps the president has information that is not yet available to us or to the public and if it's true obviously we're going to find out very quickly and if it isn't and obviously he'll have to explain what he meant by it so I don't I'm not sure what the genesis of that is a ringing defence from Senator Marco Rubio then Martha Raddatz has on Sarah Huckabee Sanders is another one of these spokespeople for the president she is not good at her job here's Martha Raddatz grilling her over over Trump's tweets sounds like the White House is really doubling down on what President Trump as we should happen if this happened once again this would be the greatest abuse of power and overreach that's probably ever occurred in the executive branch what's that certainly deserves you just came down yes if if the President of the United States said it was a fact he didn't say I read a story in bright bark or the New York Times or wherever else he said just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower that's not an if look III will let the president speak for himself but in terms of where we are in the White House our ask your a spokesperson and I'm speaking about it right now but but you're backing off of it you're backing on how am i backing off of it while I'm saying that I think they happen and I think that the American people have a right to know and I think that we should get definitive answers I think we need to put out hard facts that show that this happened I think we need to we'll then do it then this is the problem okay so James Comey who's now the left loves James called me so basically James Comey just bounces around between being loved by various political parties when he says that Hillary didn't commit a crime then he's the best FBI director ever according to the left then he says that we've reopened the investigation into Hillary's email and he is the worst person ever and then a week later he says well we closed that and then he oh well I guess he's okay and now he's ripping on Trump saying that there's this never happened that Obama never ordered the Geo DOJ to wiretap Trump and suddenly he's everybody's friend again everybody loves James call me right he's just the best everybody loves James Comey and then you know and then you have people responding to James Comey saying so here's Kellyanne he won't hear here's a White House spokeswoman is again Sarah Huckabee Sanders this morning saying that Trump doesn't believe Comey when Comey says that Obama didn't wiretap him that's by Sarah Huckabee Sanders spokesperson for the president Sarah thank you for joining us this morning is so we now know that the FBI director has told the Justice Department that president Trump's explosive claims are inaccurate because President Trump except the FBI directors denial you know I don't think he does George I think he firmly believes that this is a storyline that has been reported pretty widely by quite a few outlets the wiretapping has been discussed in the New York Times BBC Fox News and we believe that the houses I have got to stop you right there every single article you just mentioned does not back up the president's claim that President Obama had him wiretap not a single one of those articles backs that up so what is the president's evidence it does backup the fact that the administration was wiretapping American citizens there are wide reporting suggesting that his administration whether it was directly ordered by this president specifically his administration could have done there okay so there's there's a lot of wiggle room here now I'm gonna get to the wiggle room in a second and the fact of what actually happened here but but here's here's the reality of what basically happened Donald Trump read some reports he then did a very summarized version of those reports that was not quite accurate and then the media blew up with it and so every scandal basically follows this pattern every scandal basically follows this pattern for the left okay Donald Trump tweet something it is not accurate but it has a connection to reality right this is how Trump operates he says something that's not quite accurate but it has a connection to reality the left goes that's false and it has no connection to reality and then the right says no but it does have a connection into reality and then the left says you're all liars it's fake news in the records but it's not fake news because you know what Obama wasn't involved his administration was involved in asking FISA courts for wiretaps on people related to the Trump campaign and then we just repeat the cycle so basically you end up with one side saying everything Trump ever said is a lie and the other side saying everything Trump ever said was true when the truth is the Trump says really silly things on Twitter all the time that are summaries of a reality that is a little exaggerated and then the left says nothing he ever says is true which is also really silly and really stupid okay so basically it's a bunch of stupid people hitting each other with clubs that's basically the news today and is this the end of the Republic is this crazy no it's not but the media are treating it like it's the end of the Republic look at Mika Brzezinski just losing her ever-loving mind over this it's really it's really pathetic and you are out speaking for President Trump I would urge you not laugh at yourself cuz this is not funny this is really bad just for the record we're all really nervous so if people out there feel nervous we do too we don't think this is funny Oh give me a freakin break oh my god what are we gonna do Mika and Joe sat in Trump Tower with Trump the entire campaign basically kissing his ass and now oh my god he tweeted something and it was mean to Obama and it's not accurate who did you think you were talking to all these time did you think that you are talking to the king of accuracy Donald Trump who did you think you were yucking it up with this entire time Mika unbelievable okay so now we're actually gonna get to the facts so when I say that what from tweeted is not true but it has a tenuous relation to reality that is accurate there is no evidence that Barack Obama directly ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower and Donald Trump particularly okay that is not true here is what is true okay National Review to summarize is Andrew McCarthy to summarize reporting indicates that prior to 2016 the Obama Justice Department and FBI considered a criminal investigation of Trump associates and perhaps Trump himself based on concerns about connections to Russian financial institutions preliminary poking around indicated that there was nothing criminal involved but rather than shut the case down the Obama Justice Department converted it into a national security investigation under the FISA Act k FISA allows the government if it gets court permission to conduct electronic surveillance which could include wiretapping monitoring of email and the like against those it alleges our agents a foreign power FISA applications and the evidence garnered from them are classified we would not know about any of this unless someone had leaked classified information to the media which is a felony James Barrett over at Daily wire he says according to multiple reports during the 2016 campaign the Obama administration allegedly submitted two requests with the FISA Court targeting Trump or those associated with him the first submitted in June 2016 was reportedly a request to monitor several of trump's associate the request was denied the obama administration then allegedly submitted a second pfizer request in october focused on the computer server in Trump Tower which they suspected had some connections to Russian banks that request was granted but nothing was found and then there are some reports that the wiretaps of that computer continued nonetheless heat street reported something similar on the issue so we really don't know the extent of the wiretap we know that the that the FISA Court refused one application and granted another or at least that's the report we also don't know whether those wiretaps were trained at Trump's associates they weren't trained to Trump himself by any of these reports none of these reports say Trump himself was tapped so we also don't know if the information is being gathered because we were wiretapping Russian sources and we caught like Mike Flynn on the line talking with the Russian so in other words there's a lot of information that the intelligence community was concerned with the connections between Trump and Russia right but the idea that Obama himself was dictating from top down that this is the case that you have to follow Trump and you have to have to dig all this up not any evidence of that but by the same token can you trust any of the people who are saying that this is my biggest problem okay my biggest problem with all of this is that the left keeps saying stuff like what's the big crisis here let's just stop there for a second what is the big crisis here I'll tell you what the big crisis is after we say thank you to our sponsor which is today which is the u.s.

so what is the big issue the media are focused on here what's the big issue if it's just not true let's say that it's just not true then what's the big deal so Trump tweeted something out that's not true would this be any grave shock to anyone hmm yeah this guy who tweeted for three years the Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States so like no it's not like no I'm sorry I'm not gonna get all exorcised about Donald Trump tweeted crap but what they're saying is this undermines the foundations of democracy it undermines what democracy is all about democracy was already undermined folks democracy was already undermined okay all of the people who are currently denying that anything happened from Obama all of those people can't be trusted so it for example James clapper was the Director of National Intelligence under President Obama and here is James clapper talking about how he ordered no wiretap of the Trump campaign this idea that maybe President Obama ordered an illegal wiretap of his office's if something like that happened would this be something you would be aware of I would certainly hope so I can't say obviously I'm not I can't speak officially anymore but I will say that for the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president the president-elect at the time or as a candidate or against his campaign I can't speak for other title three authorized entities in the government or a state or local and if the FBI for instance had it fights a court order of some sort first surveillance would that be information you would know or not yes you would be told that I would know that if there was a fight a court on something don't this he's saying none of this ever happened this is all nonsense okay I would believe him except for the fact that here's what James clapper had to say in 2013 in front of Congress under oath so what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans no sir it does not not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly okay that is called perjury what you just saw there and that guy is out there on TV telling you that you ought to believe him now James Comey is saying you ought to believe him now really did which which version of Comey did we believe during the election the pro-hillary version or the anti-hillary version nobody knew okay here's the reality a lot of this is based Trump what Trump is basing this on is Mark Levin did a good job on Friday of laying out all of the various attempts by the Obama administration to to basically surveil members of the Trump campaign here's Mark Levin doing the same thing yesterday on Fox News and explaining the case and it's a pretty solid case what Levin says here the evidence was overwhelming this is not about president Trump's tweet this is about the Obama administration's spying and the question isn't whether it's spied we know they went to the FISA Court twice the question is who did they spy on the extent of the spying that is the Trump campaign the truant Transition Trump surrogates and I want to walk you through this the American people exhibit one exhibit one this is all public head Street two separate sources with links to the counterintelligence community confirmed that the FBI sought and was granted a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court this is spying in October given counterintelligence permission to examine the activity of quote US persons in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia let me go on says it me they say the first Pfizer request sources say named Trump was denied back in June denied by the court mm-hmm but the second out earlier all these facts are publicly reported publicly available we don't excuse-me know what's true and what's not true at this point so again let me lay out the chain of events here Donald Trump tweets something that isn't true but has a connection to reality the left says it has no connection with reality the right says wait no it has some connection with reality plus he's making a bigger point and the bigger point is true and left those the bigger point isn't true and has no connection to reality mm-hmm okay many things can be true at once the Obama administration could not be trusted okay the Obama administration clearly had had information on Trump and Russia or wanted to gather information on Trump and Russia and now they're saying they can't even find any real connection they were pushing this story I mean was being leaked out at the time almost and and so the fact that you know that they're saying now that nothing ever one time that was illicit is not trusting this and when people say Trump is the one who's quashing the public trust no no one can be trusted no one can be trusted here and I'll
