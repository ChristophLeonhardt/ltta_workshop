1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,600
A
MINNESOTA LAWMAKER REFUSED TO

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,960
MEET WITH A GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,450
DEMOCRATS FROM HER DISTRICT
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO HER STORY

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,089
SHE WAS AFRAID IT WOULD END UP
WITH A SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIM.

5
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:15,360
THIS IS A STRANGE TALE THAT

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,080
WOULD TAKE YOU TO THE BEGINNING.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,710
SHE IS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,680
MINNESOTA STATE LEGISLATURE.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,970
THE
HIGH SCHOOL ASKED TO MEET WITH

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,450
HER ONE-ON-ONE IN HER
LEGISLATIVE OFFICE.

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,950
THIS IS HOW

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:48,130
SHE REPLIED.

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:53,390
AND THE DEMOCRATIC
GROUP WAS LIKE ISN'T IT OUR JOB

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,340
TO MEET AND DISCOURSE BACK AND
FORTH AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:12,680
BOTH SIDES DAX SHE TWEETS BACK
AT THEM SAYING THIS.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
THEY COME

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,400
BACK AND SAY IS THAT YOUR DUTY
TO MEET WITH CONSTITUENTS TO

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,740
WHICH SHE REPLIES THIS.

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,740
AND THIS

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,549
IS BEFORE ALL THE WEIRD I DON'T
WANT

21
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,080
TO BE ROY MOORE THING.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:41,260
>>THIS IS AN ODD STORY.

23
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,290
FROM
TIME TO TIME WE COVER

24
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,990
REPUBLICANS AT THE STATE LEVEL
THAT ARE JUST CUCKOO FOR COCOA

25
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,759
PUFFS.

26
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,759
SHE APPEARS TO BE ONE OF

27
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,950
THEM AS YOU WILL SEE LATER.

28
00:01:51,950 --> 00:02:02,600
BUT
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS DO TAKE

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,880
MEETINGS WITH CONSTITUENTS, BUT
ALL OF OUR VOLUNTEERS ARE IN

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
STATE.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,650
AND SOMETIMES THEY EVEN
CHANGE THEIR MINDS.

32
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,650
WHEN YOU

33
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,520
ACTUALLY SEE DEMOCRACY, IT IS A

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,120
WONDERFUL THING TO BEHOLD.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,920
SHE
DOES IT REPRESENT ALL

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
REPUBLICANS.

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,690
IF IT IS A HIGH
SCHOOL GROUP, YOU SHOULD BE

38
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,690
MEETING WITH THEM.

39
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,890
ON THE OTHER
HAND IF IT WAS JUST THIS I DON'T

40
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,890
THINK WE WOULD'VE DONE THE

41
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,890
STORY.

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,260
BUT THEY ARE HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENTS, YOU SHOULD MEET WITH

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,230
THEM BUT IT IS NOT THE END OF

44
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,560
THE WORLD.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,040
>> IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING BUT
POSITIVE OPTICS.

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,030
BUT SHE REFUSED

47
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,260
TO GO ONE-ON-ONE WITH THEM.

48
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,360
SHE
GOT INVITED TO A VOLUNTEER EVENT

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,030
AND SHE SAID I DON'T WANT TO

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,160
MEET WITH YOU. AND THEN THINK
PROGRESS GOT THEIR HANDS ON A

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,610
PRIVATE FACEBOOK POST SHE MADE

52
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,610
SAYING THIS.

53
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:17,250
WHY DOES SHE TAKE IT THERE?

54
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:44,930
>> YOU REMEMBER MICHELLE
BACHMANN USED TO HIDE IN THE

55
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,769
BUSHES AT THE LGBT EVENTS TO TRY

56
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,950
TO SURPRISE LESBIANS.

57
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,060
LIKE SHE
WOULD JUMP OUT OF THE BUSHES AND

58
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,319
BE LIKE I CAUGHT YOU. AND THEY
WOULD SAY IT IS AN LGBT EVENT,

59
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,240
YOU DON'T CATCH US WITH

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,659
ANYTHING.

61
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,760
>> SO WEIRD.

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,989
>> UNDER HER LOGIC YOU COULD
NEVER MEET WITH ANYONE ALONE AND

63
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:16,219
DEMAND CAN'T, A WOMAN CAN'T. IF
SHE SAID I DON'T WANT TO JOKE

64
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:19,819
AROUND ANYMORE ABOUT SEX AT WORK

65
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:23,749
ANYMORE USED TO BE ABLE TO BUT
WE CAN'T, YOU WOULD SAY I HEAR

66
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:24,960
YOU.

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,369
BUT IF YOU ARE OUT OF
NOWHERE ARE LIKE HIGH SCHOOL

68
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:35,169
KIDS Ã± ROY MOORE WAS ACCUSED OF
RIPPING ONE GIRLS CLOTHES OFF

69
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,750
AND TRY TO FORCE HER HEAD DOWN

70
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,860
TO HIS GENITALS.

71
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
YOU WEREN'T
PLANNING TO DO THAT WITH A HIGH

72
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,610
SCHOOL STUDENT WERE YOU?

73
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:51,520
>> JUST SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND
HAVE SOMEONE ELSE THERE.

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
AND

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
ALSO IN ADDITION TO BLOCKING THE

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,159
LEADER OF THIS GROUP ON FACEBOOK
IT WAS INCIDENTALLY A

77
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:02,280
17-YEAR-OLD KID, THAT LEADER OF
THE GROUP WHOSE NAME IS JACK

78
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:11,639
BALLOU WAS REALLY CONFUSED BY
ALL 

79
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,389
OF THIS.

80
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:22,870
AND THAT IS WHAT

81
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,710
GETS ME MAYBE SHE IS A

82
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,240
REPUBLICAN OUT IN A STATE
REPRESENTATIVE SOMEWHERE IN

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,119
MINNESOTA, SHE IS KIND OF
ADOPTING THIS TRUMP LET'S TWEETS

84
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,960
COLLOQUIALLY.

85
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,909
INSTEAD OF SAD SHE
CUTS AND PASTE THIS EMOJI WHICH

86
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,990
INVOLVES A JAPANESE CHARACTER.

87
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,580
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST MAKE

88
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,659
THAT.

89
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,869
AND THEN TO INVOKE ROY
MOORE WHICH IS THE FLAVOR OF THE

90
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,210
DAY, MAYBE SHE IS A LITTLE

91
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,339
BEHIND AND HASN'T REALLY MET IT.

92
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,289
IT IS JUST THE STRANGE KNEE-JERK

93
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:02,819
REACTION COMMUNICATION OVER

94
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,020
SOCIAL MEDIA THAT IS VERY
STRANGE TO ME.

95
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,300
>>SHE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO
HERSELF ANY FAVORS BY COMPARING

96
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,020
HERSELF TO ROY MOORE, NOT A
SAVVY POLITICAL MOVE AT A BARE

97
00:06:14,020 --> 00:00:00,000
MINIMUM.
