1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,609
IT'S MEANT TO REDUCE HOSTILITIES

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:03,643
ON THE PENINSULA.

3
00:00:03,643 --> 00:00:05,845
OBVIOUSLY WE'LL FOLLOW THIS ALL

4
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:08,248
NIGHT.

5
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:10,951
IN RECENT YEARS, THE DIGITAL

6
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:12,819
VIDEO MONOPOLY YOUTUBE WHICH IS

7
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:14,154
PART OF THE DIGITAL SEARCH

8
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:16,756
MONOPOLY GOOGLE HAS BEEN ACCUSED

9
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:17,324
OF TRYING TO SILENCE

10
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:23,029
CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINTS.

11
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:24,030
CONTENT PROVIDERS HAVE FOUND

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,831
THEMSELVES CENSORED.

13
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,833
YOUTUBE DENIES DOING ANY OF THIS

14
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,234
ON PURPOSE.

15
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:28,435
IT WAS ACCIDENTAL.

16
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:31,238
THEY SAY WE HAVE NO POLITICAL

17
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:31,571
AGENDA.

18
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:32,939
IT TURNS OUT THAT'S A LIE.

19
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,075
THIS SHOW HAS EXCLUSIVELY

20
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:38,211
OBTAINED A YOUTUBE MEMO FROM

21
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:41,982
APRIL 2017 THAT LAYS OUT IN

22
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:42,315
DETAIL.

23
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:47,220
ONE OF THE REASONS THIS IS AN

24
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,421
OBVIOUS TO MOST PEOPLE IS

25
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,823
BECAUSE THE COMPANY ISN'T SMART

26
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:51,124
ENOUGH NOT TO SCRUB EVERY VIDEO

27
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:55,161
IT WANTS TO SENSOR.

28
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,063
THE VIDEO DESCRIBES IT AS A

29
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:58,431
LIMITED STATE.

30
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:01,067
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF

31
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:01,635
SCIENTOLOGY.

32
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:02,602
VIDEOS IN A LIMITED STATE ARE

33
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:03,403
INTENTIONALLY PUSHED DOWN ON THE

34
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:05,839
SITE SO THEY'RE HARDER TO FIND.

35
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:06,573
THEY'RE ALSO DEMONETIZED MANY

36
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:07,741
PEOPLE WHO POST THEM CAN'T MAKE

37
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,643
MONEY FROM THEM NO MATTER HOW

38
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:10,844
OFTEN THEY ARE VIEWED.

39
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:12,679
THINK THAT ISN'T A BIG DEAL?

40
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,080
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU

41
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,481
COULDN'T BUY

42
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,181
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ON A

00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:15,548
NEWSSTAND.

44
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:16,783
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ITS

45
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:17,984
PUBLISHERS WHEN ALLOWED TO MAKE

46
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:20,253
MONEY FROM SELLING IT?

47
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:21,655
DOES THAT QUALIFY AS A

48
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:22,822
CENSORSHIP QUESTION MIKE

49
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:24,057
OBVIOUSLY, OF COURSE IT WOULD.

50
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:25,825
WHAT IS THE CRITERIA FOR

51
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:26,926
CENSORING VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE?

52
00:01:26,926 --> 00:01:30,630
ACCORDING TO THE MEMO

53
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,298
"CONTROVERSIAL RELIGIOUS OR

54
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:34,901
SUPREMACIST CONTENT QUALIFIES.

55
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,437
SODAS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL --

56
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:38,538
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

57
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:40,540
NONE OF IT IS DEFINED AND IT'S

58
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,841
TOTALLY SUBJECTIVE.

59
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:44,244
YOUTUBE MAKES THE CALL AND DOES

60
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:45,278
SO WITH MAXIMUM POLITICAL

61
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:45,879
INTENT.

62
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,113
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUTUBE DECIDED IT

63
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:50,884
WAS INFLAMMATORY TO QUESTION THE

64
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:51,818
NOTION THAT ALL COPS ARE RACIST.

65
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:54,120
IF YOU DON'T THINK THEY ARE,

66
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,323
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE ACCORDING TO

67
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:59,025
YOUTUBE, SO HIS VIDEO WAS

68
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:01,227
DEMONETIZED YET VIDEOS THAT

69
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:03,029
SUGGEST THAT WHITE PEOPLE ARE

70
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:04,664
INHERENTLY EVIL WILL REMAIN ON

71
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:05,832
YOUTUBE WITHOUT ANY

72
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:06,433
RESTRICTIONS.

73
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,233
THAT'S CLEARLY POLITICAL.

74
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,301
THE MEMO MAKES IT VERY CLEAR

75
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,338
WHERE YOUTUBE SENSORS ARE COMING

76
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:13,039
FROM AND EXPLAIN THAT THE

77
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,041
COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO THE

78
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,743
FREEDOM TO BELONG INCLUDING THE

79
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:18,845
RESULTING BENEFITS OF DIVERSITY

80
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:20,447
AND INCLUSION.

81
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:21,081
OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD.

82
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:23,583
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN?

83
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,653
AGAIN, IT'S ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE.

84
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:28,988
AT ONE POINT, THE MEMO DECLARES

85
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,024
THAT ANY DEMEANING LANGUAGE

86
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:32,225
AGAINST A DETECTIVE GROUP MAY

87
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,426
RESULT IN A VIDEO BEING REMOVED

88
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:34,661
FROM A SITE.

89
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:37,630
WHO ARE THESE PROTECTED GROUPS?

90
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,432
ACCORDING TO YOUTUBE, REFUGEES

91
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:40,467
ARE A PROTECTED GROUP.

92
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,901
LET'S SAY YOU DON'T LIKE THE

93
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:44,037
FACT THAT REFUGEES ARE BEING

94
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:46,373
SETTLED IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR

95
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:46,706
EXAMPLE.

96
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:47,807
YOU ASSUME IT WAS YOUR RIGHT AS

97
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:48,541
A CITIZEN TO DISAGREE WITH

98
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,845
GOVERNMENT POLICY.

99
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:52,645
NOT ACCORDING TO YOUTUBE.

100
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:54,047
THERE WILL SENSOR YOUR

101
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:55,448
COMPLAINTS ABOUT WHAT YOUR

102
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:56,216
GOVERNMENT IS DOING AND CALL YOU

103
00:02:56,216 --> 00:03:02,222
A BIGOT IN THE PROCESS.

104
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:03,690
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT ONE OF

105
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,028
THE TRUSTED FLAGGERS YOUTUBE HAS

106
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:09,763
CENSORED IS A SOUTHERN POVERTY

107
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:13,433
LAW CENTER WHICH IS AN EXTREMIST

108
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:18,271
GROUP.

109
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,273
IT WAS THE SPLC THAT SLANDERED

110
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:22,041
THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL AS A

111
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,843
HATE GROUP AND LABELED THE PULSE

112
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,645
NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING A RIGHT-WING

113
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:28,047
ATTACK WHICH AS YOU KNOW, IT WAS

114
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:29,249
NOT.

115
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,050
THE SPLC IS TOTALLY DISCREDITED

116
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,452
AND ANYONE WHO SPENDS 5 MINUTES

117
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:34,120
READING ABOUT IT COMES TO THAT

118
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,521
CONCLUSION.

119
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:37,323
YET YOUTUBE TRUSTS THE

120
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:38,258
SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER TO

121
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:39,426
CENSOR YOUR VIDEOS.

122
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,461
THAT TELLS YOU A LOT.

123
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:42,061
WE CONTACTED YOUTUBE FOR

124
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,730
STATEMENT ON ALL OF THIS AND WE

125
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,965
ASKED IF THE COMPANY HAD REVISED

126
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:46,766
ITS POLICIES SINCE THE MEMO WAS

127
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:47,367
WRITTEN LAST YEAR.

128
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:49,669
THE COMPANY BARELY RESPONDED.

129
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,972
WE RELATE TO A BLOG POST WRITTEN

130
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,641
BY A GOOGLE LAWYER LAST JUNE IN

131
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:55,475
WHICH HE AVAILED THE COMPANY

132
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:56,810
WOULD BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN

133
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,012
CENSORING VIDEOS IT DOESN'T LIKE

134
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:00,447
CENSORING VIDEOS IT DOESN'T LIK

135
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:00,747
LIKE.

136
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:03,149
ALMOST NOBODY AND POWER IS

137
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,050
FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THIS

138
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,451
CENSORSHIP.

139
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:06,820
HERE YOU HAVE AN AMERICAN

140
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,222
COMPANY INCUBATED IN AMERICA BY

141
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:10,623
AMERICANS UNDER THE PROTECTION

142
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:12,425
OF AMERICAN LAW AND COURTS WHICH

143
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:14,027
IS NOW WORKING TO UNDERMINE THE

144
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:15,361
MOST SACRED OF AMERICAN RIGHTS

145
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:16,728
WHICH IS THE FREEDOM OF

146
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:17,130
EXPRESSION.

147
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,632
YET THE CONGRESS WHICH IS RUN BY

148
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,469
REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW IS DOING

149
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:23,470
PRECISELY NOTHING ABOUT THIS.

150
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,872
WHEN YOU ASK THEM, THEY MUMBLED

151
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:26,940
SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE ABOUT

152
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,842
FREE MARKETS AND GET BACK TO THE

153
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:30,577
TAX CUTS FOR COMPANIES LIKE

154
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:30,910
YOUTUBE.

155
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,046
MEANWHILE, THE REST OF US WHO

156
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,647
LIVE HERE AND CARE ABOUT FREE

157
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:37,250
SPEECH ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR

158
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,820
OURSELVES.

159
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,089
THEY SHUT US DOWN WHEN WE DO

160
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:47,494
SEND.

161
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:50,430
IT IS TIME TO COMPLAIN WHILE WE

162
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,797
STILL CAN.

163
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:52,665
YOUTUBE ISN'T THE ONLY

164
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:58,037
POLITICIZED PART OF GOOGLE.

165
00:04:58,037 --> 00:04:59,038
IN A MEMO, MANAGERS ARE TOLD TO

166
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,608
REWARD PEOPLE FOR FOLLOWING

167
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,643
THEIR WHITE MALE CULTURE OF

168
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:11,851
AMERICA.

169
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:12,552
NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS RACIST

170
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:15,455
UNTIL NOW.

171
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:16,489
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THIS IS

172
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:17,156
EVEN REAL.

173
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:18,725
TELL US WHAT THE MEMO SAYS.

174
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:24,030
SPEAK OF MEMO BASICALLY SAYS

175
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,764
EDITS INCLUSIVE PERFORMANCE AND

176
00:05:24,764 --> 00:05:26,933
THEY ARE COACHED AND SOMEHOW

177
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:29,636
FORCED TO EVALUATE PEOPLE ON

178
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:30,837
MANAGERS ON THE FEEDBACK THEY

179
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:31,771
GIVE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES.

180
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:34,507
THIS MEMO IS ABOUT WHEN YOU GIVE

181
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:37,010
FEEDBACK TO YOUR EMPLOYEES, THE

182
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,545
CAREFUL ABOUT TO POSITIVE

183
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:44,851
FEEDBACK TO WHITE PEOPLE SUCH AS

184
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:45,485
MARIST BAY PERFORMANCE AND

185
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:47,520
INDIVIDUAL EXCELLENCE AND SO

186
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,054
FORTH.

187
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:49,122
WHEN YOU'RE GIVING FEEDBACK TO

188
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:52,058
PEOPLE OF COLOR, YOU SHOULD BE

189
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:52,792
SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT THEY

190
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:56,763
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IN FAVOR

191
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:57,463
OF GROUP ACHIEVEMENT AND

192
00:05:57,463 --> 00:06:02,468
COLLECTIVE VALUES.

00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:03,603
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT

194
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:08,408
YOU INSTEAD OF TO YOU.

195
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,410
THIS GROSS RACIAL STEREOTYPES ON

196
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:16,416
BOTH SIDES THAT ARE OFFENSIVE.

197
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:22,255
THIS IS CLEARLY ABSURD.

198
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,990
JAMES MOORE WAS LET GO BECAUSE

199
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,659

200
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,261
GROUP PERPETUATES RACIAL

201
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:28,861

THEIR PROGRAMMING STAFF TO THE

204
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,101
SAME STANDARDS.

205
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:37,103
OF COURSE, THEY DEMAND

206
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:40,206
EXCELLENCE AT THE BASIS OF THEIR

207
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:43,409
BUSINESS.

208
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:50,249
WHAT'S THEIR RESPONSE BEEN?

209
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:51,351
ARE THEY CONCEDING THIS IS REAL?

210
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:54,654
>> I DON'T THINK THEY GET IT.

211
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,255
GOOGLE IS TOO POWERFUL TO BE

212
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,823
QUESTIONED.

213
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,092
THEY'VE BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH

214
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:02,829
THIS.

215
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:03,563
THEY DESCRIBE ALL CRITICISM OF

216
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:07,800

GERRYMANDERING AS ALL GREAT

218
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:11,437
CRITICISM.

219
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:13,706
>> Tucker: WE HAD THE SAME JOB

220
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:14,474
25 YEARS AGO.

221
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,342
YOU'VE BEEN A CONSERVATIVE ALL

222
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:17,443

223
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:19,445
WHY ARE CONSERVATIVES AND

224
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,446
REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON

225
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:20,947

226
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,048
DEFENDING GOOGLE?

227
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,082
WHY ARE THEY DOING SOMETHING

00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:25,184
ABOUT IT?

229
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:27,387
>> I'M AFRAID ONE CRASS REASON

230
00:07:27,387 --> 00:07:28,454
IS GOOGLE SPENDS THE MONEY

231
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:30,623
AROUND TO BOTH SIDES.

232
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:31,324
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DO SOME

233
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:43,136

234
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:44,804

00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,673
THEY ARE REALLY UBIQUITOUS

236
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:47,206
EVERYWHERE.

237
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:50,643
AS A RESULT, PEOPLE KNOW WHICH

238
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:56,082
SIDE IS THEIR BREAD AND BUTTER.

239
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:58,451
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE RUNNING UP

240
00:07:58,451 --> 00:07:58,885
AGAINST.

241
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:00,486
THERE ARE A LOT OF PATRIOTS WHO

242
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:01,888

243
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,690

245
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:08,194
LAWSUITS.

246
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:10,663
THEY CALLED IT THE COURT AND

247
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,665
SAID EMPLOYEES ARE BEING

248
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:13,866
HARASSED.

249
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,601
THE COURT HAS A SEALED IT FOR

250
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,602
TWO MONTHS.

251
