1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,238
THESE SHOOTINGS ARE NOT RANDOM. 

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:08,708
THEY ARE FUELED BY GANG 

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:09,008
CONFLICTS. 

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,544
WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. 

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:12,745
WE CONTINUE TO SEND A MESSAGE 

6
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:14,447
THAT IS OKAY TO COMMIT THESE 

7
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,283
CRIMES. 

8
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,185
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE 

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,453
SAME TEAM. 

10
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,688
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT I 

11
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,822
MENTIONED BEFORE, NEED TO WORK 

12
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:27,260
TOGETHER AGAINST THE VIOLENCE SO

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,361
THE COMMUNITIES CAN REBUILD. 

14
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,696
AND DESPITE WHAT WE SAW THIS 

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,863
WEEKEND, I'M STILL PLEASED THAT 

16
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:35,134
BETWEEN ALL OF THE WORK, WE 

17
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:38,071
STILL SEE REDUCTIONS IN GUN 

18
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,439
VIOLENCE THIS YEAR. 

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,074
BUT WE REALLY HAVE A LOT MORE 

20
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,908
WORK TO DO IT WE NEED EVERYONE, 

21
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,446
EVERYONE TO COME TO THE TABLE. 

22
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,515
I'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. 

23
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,990
>> BOTH OF THEM HAD BEEN 

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,659
REPORTED MISSING. 

25
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,194
ONE FOR 24 HOURS AND THE OTHER 

26
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,529
FOR ABOUT 48 HOURS. 

27
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,696
ONE HAS NO CRIMINAL HISTORY OR 

28
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:04,763
ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE'S. 

29
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:11,004
ONE IS ACTUALLY KNOWN TO CPD. 

30
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,541
>> THEY WERE REPORTED MISSING 

31
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,343
BY THEIR MOTHER'S. 

32
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,611
ONE AFTER 24 HOURS AND THE 

33
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:22,448
OTHER AFTER 24 -- 48 HOURS. 

34
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:25,718
THE MOTHER ACTUALLY RECEIVED AN 

35
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,720
ANONYMOUS MESSAGE SAYING THAT 

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,558
THIS PARTY BELIEVED THAT SHE 

37
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,459
COULD FIND HER SON IN A WOODED 

38
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:42,569
AREA OVER AT 1/30 -- 130TH. 

39
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,673
DETECTIVES WENT TO THAT AREA 

40
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,007
AND SOME FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL 

41
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,709
AND LOCATED BOTH OF THE VICTIMS 

42
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,247
WHO WERE DECEASED. 

43
00:01:54,247 --> 00:02:00,587
>> DETECTIVES FOUND THE BODY. 

44
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,621
WHEN SHE RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE, 

45
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,957
SHE WAS ACTUALLY WITH DETECTIVES

46
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,791
AT THE TIME. 

47
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,527
SHE WAS TALKING TO DETECTIVES. 

48
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,864
WE STARTED A MISSING PERSONS 

49
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,231
INVESTIGATION. 

50
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,765
AND THE DETECTIVES WERE 

51
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,067
FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT LEADS THEY 

52
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:14,300
COULD. 

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,071
THEY WERE ACTUALLY WITH THE 

54
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,305
MOTHER OF ONE OF THESE YOUNG 

55
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,040
MEN WHEN THE MOTHER RECEIVED A 

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,941
MESSAGE AND SAID I JUST 

57
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,375
RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE THAT MY 

58
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,079
SON CAN BE FOUND OVER HERE. 

59
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,813
THEY WENT THERE TOGETHER BEGIN 

60
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,213
SEARCHING. 

61
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:30,617
THE DETECTIVES PHONED THEM. 

62
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,651
YES. 

63
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:36,089
I'M SORRY? 

64
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,590
THE MOTIVE? 

65
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,892
THERE ARE COUPLE OF DIFFERENT 

66
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,092
ONCE. 

67
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,826
WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO PERSONS OF 

68
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:43,263
INTEREST THAT WE ARE TALKING TO 

69
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:43,863
RIGHT NOW. 

70
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,132
THERE ARE COUPLE OF THINGS 

71
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:46,632
GOING AROUND. 

72
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,000
WE HAVEN'T RULED OUT THE 

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,971
POTENTIAL FOR ROBBERY IS ONE OF 

74
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,341
THE MOTIVES. 

75
00:02:55,341 --> 00:03:02,348
-- AS ONE OF THE MOTIVES. 

76
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,923
>> IT IS JUST A MATTER OF BEING 

77
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,258
ACCOUNTABLE. 

78
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:12,925
YOU KNOW? 

79
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:15,929
EVERYONE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. 

80
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,064
MYSELF, THE FIRST DEPUTY, THE 

81
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,033
MAYOR AND HIS STAFF, JUDICIAL 

82
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:26,339
ú 

83
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:26,939
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE 

84
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:27,272
ACCOUNTABLE. 

85
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:27,974
ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE THAT 

86
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:28,975
DECIDE TO PULL THESE TRIGGERS. 

87
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,543
THEY DON'T GET A PASS FROM US. 

88
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,011
THE SIMPLE FACT OF IT IS, THE 

89
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,481
POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN'T DO IT 

90
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:35,782
ALONE. 

91
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,216
I KNOW WE HAVE STRAINED 

92
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,118
RELATIONSHIPS IN CERTAIN PARTS 

93
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:39,519
OF THE CITY. 

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,154
I RECOGNIZE THAT. 

95
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,622
I'M A BLACK MAN THAT HAS LIVED 

96
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,157
IN CHICAGO HIS ENTIRE LIFE. 

97
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:48,261
I KNOW THE TENSION BETWEEN THE 

98
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,295
PLEASE DEPARTMENT AND THE BLACK 

99
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:49,595
COMMUNITY. 

100
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,330
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THESE 

101
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,900
INDIVIDUALS JUST FEEL LIKE THEY 

102
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,303
CAN CONTINUE TO DO IT BECAUSE 

103
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,538
THEY AREGETTING AWAY WITH IT. 

104
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,874
IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET 

105
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,110
SCIENTIST TO FIGURE THAT OUT. 

106
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,045
THIS IS SIMPLY PEOPLE THAT 

107
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:14,487
DECIDE TO COMMIT THESE CRIMES. 

108
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,288
WOULD YOU STOP? 

109
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,289
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED TO 

110
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,055
DO? 

111
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:20,660
IT'S RIDICULOUS. 

112
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,961
PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF 

113
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:22,127
IT. 

114
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,196
AND THEY SHOULD BE. 

115
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,530
BY SHOULD BE. 

116
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,499
WE JUST HAVE A CULTURE IN 

117
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:30,069
CHICAGO WHERE INDIVIDUALS -- 

118
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,274
FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TOO MANY 

119
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:34,974
GUNS IN THE CITY. 

120
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,342
WAY TOO MANY GUNS. 

121
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,245
THAT'S OBVIOUS. 

122
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,715
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ILLEGAL GUN 

123
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,083
PROBLEM IN OTHER CITIES. 

124
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,853
WE KEEP FAILING TO HOLD PEOPLE 

125
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:48,220
ACCOUNTABLE. 

126
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,023
UNTIL WE DO THAT, WE ARE GOING 

127
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:56,629
TO CONTINUE SEEING THAT. 

128
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,630
THEY ARE SHOWING US EVERYDAY 

129
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,032
THAT THEY ARE NOT AFRAID TO DO 

130
00:04:59,032 --> 00:04:59,365
IT. 

131
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,967
AND WE HAVE TO ASK WHY? 

132
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,167
WHY? 

133
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:01,834
WHY AREN'T THEY AFRAID? 

134
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,971
THE CONSEQUENCE OF IT JUST 

135
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,907
ISN'T THERE. 

136
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:16,516
>> LISTEN, CRIME ISN'T JUST úAB 

137
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,650
CRIME IS ABOUT WHAT THE 

138
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:17,983
CRIMINALS DO. 

139
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:21,154
LET'S NOT FORGET THE POLICE 

140
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:21,921
AREN'T THE ONES OUT THERE DOING 

141
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,121
IT. 

142
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,322
WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. 

143
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:27,193
CAN WE DO BETTER? 

144
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:27,894
OF COURSE WE CAN. 

145
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,429
BUT IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THAT. 

146
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,530
CRIME IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. 

147
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,933
WHEN YOU LOOK AT RESOURCES, 

148
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:34,967
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, 

149
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,003
HEALTHCARE, ALL OF THOSE THINGS 

150
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,438
PLAY A PART. 

151
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,540
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WE LOOK 

152
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,779
AT CRIME EVERY DAY, EVERY HOUR. 

153
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,013
AND WE READJUST, READJUST, 

154
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:48,915
READJUST. 

155
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,483
THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH THE 

156
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,317
POLICE CAN DO. 

157
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,385
WE CANNOT BE ON EVERY STREET 

158
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,821
COMBER, EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY 

159
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,655
DAY. 

160
00:05:55,655 --> 00:06:00,393
WE JUST CANNOT. 

161
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,326
THERE IS NO POLICE DEPARTMENT 

162
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:02,828
IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CAN DO 

163
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:03,028
THAT. 

164
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:03,963
IT TAKES ALL OF US. 

165
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,531
THE POLICE, THE OFFICIALS, THE 

166
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,132
CLERGY, THE COMMUNITY. 

167
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,734
AND I HAVE TO GIVE CERTAIN 

168
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:11,871
PEOPLE ALL THE KUDOS IN THE 

169
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,104
WORLD. 

170
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:13,105
THEY REALLY ARE STEPPING UP TO 

171
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,775
TRY TO HELP THIS. 

172
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,110
THE FACT IS WE NEED EVERYBODY 

173
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,978
TO DO IT. 

174
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:24,683
YES. 

175
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:24,984
WE DID. 

176
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,919
LIKE A SAID, WE DISPERSED QUITE 

177
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,156
A FEW GATHERINGS THAT COULD 

178
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,257
POTENTIALLY TURN VIOLENT. 

179
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,026
YOU KNOW, WE WILL BE KEEP DOING 

180
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:34,226
THAT. 

181
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,662
WE'LL KEEP DOING THAT UNTIL WE 

182
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,298
SEE THINGS STABILIZE A BIT MORE.

183
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:50,676
I DON'T THINK THIS COMBINATION 

184
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,711
PLAYS ANY PART OF IT. 

185
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,712
IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES, WE HAVE 

186
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,513
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT 

187
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,513
TO CONTINUE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 

188
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:55,548
AND TERRORIZE THOSE 

189
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:55,881
COMMUNITIES. 

190
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,719
THAT'S WHAT I THINK. 

191
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,120
I'M TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF 

192
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,255
THE STRAINED RELATIONSHIP WITH 

193
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,125
THE POLICE AND THAT COMMUNITY 

194
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,126
IN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION 

195
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,362
THAT WE NEED. 

196
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,596
LET'S NOT NEGATE THE FACT THAT 

197
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,799
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID IN CERTAIN 

198
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:26,012
INSTANCES TOO. 

199
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:26,913
MY HEART GOES OUT. 

200
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:27,446
THAT WAS TRAGIC. 

201
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:30,082
AND I TELL YOU, ANYTIME YOU 

202
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,819
HAVE A LOSS OF LIFE IN THE CITY,

203
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,487
IT IS DIFFICULT. 

204
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,189
I UNDERSTAND THEIR ENGLISH. 

205
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:38,824
THAT'S NOT EASY. 

206
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:41,794
LOSING A LOVED ONE UNDER ANY 

207
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,030
CIRCUMSTANCES DIFFICULT. 

208
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,932
IT IS. 

209
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,200
AS SOON AS WE CAN PROVIDE THEM 

210
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,769
SOME RELIEF, WE'LL CERTAINLY DO 

211
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,570
THAT. 

212
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,405
BECAUSE JUST TO ASSURE THEM AND 

213
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,106
TO LET THEM KNOW CERTAIN THINGS 

214
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,208
ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT 

215
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:00,146
OCCURRED -- 

216
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,217
THE YOUNG MAN? 

217
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:09,221
AT SOME POINT. 

218
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:12,925
NO. 

219
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,459
ANYTIME YOU HAVE A JUVENILE 

220
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,631
INVOLVED IN RELEASING VIDEO, IT 

221
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,466
IS DIFFERENT. 

222
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,901
YOU KNOW, SO WE'LL LOOK AT 

223
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:22,201
EVERYTHING. 

224
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,336
WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO BUT OF 

225
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:30,242
COURSE, BEFORE RELEASE -- WE 

226
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:31,210
RELEASE ANYTHING TO THE PUBLIC, 

227
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,279
I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE THE 

228
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,282
FAMILY TO SEE IT FIRST. 

229
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,695
YES. 

230
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,596
ALL RIGHT. 

231
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:56,235
THANK YOU, ALL. 

232
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:08,347
THANK YOU, ALL PITCH -- ALL. 

233
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:12,652
>>> WE JUST HEARD FROM THE 

234
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,185
POLICE SUPERINTENDENT IN 

235
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:13,452
CHICAGO. 

236
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,620
WE'VE SEEN THIS PRESS 

237
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,057
CONFERENCE BEFORE. 61 PEOPLE 

238
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,358
WERE SHOT AND EIGHT OF THEM 

239
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:19,691
WERE KILLED. 

240
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,460
IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS 

241
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,430
AND WE WERE REPORTING THE 

242
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,332
LARGEST NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS AND 

243
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:31,203
CLEARLY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

244
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,972
ARE EXASPERATED. 

245
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,407
THEY ARE DESPERATE TO FIND WAYS 

246
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,143
TO SLOW DOWN THIS PACE. 

247
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,446
BUT THE TRUTH IS -- AND ONE OF 

248
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,415
THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP 

249
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,750
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IT IS IN 

250
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,619
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUE BUT 

251
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,387
IT IS MUCH LARGER THAN THAT. 

252
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,121
IT IS SOCIETAL ISSUES. 

253
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:53,092
POLICE CANNOT DO THIS ON THEIR 

254
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,492
OWN. 

255
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,294
>> AND THEY ARE FACING 

256
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:55,928
INCREASING NUMBERS OF 

257
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,964
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INVOLVED. 

258
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:01,733
AND THAT IS ANOTHER LARGER 

259
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,234
ISSUE. 

260
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,403
WHY PEOPLE JOIN GANGS AND WHAT 

261
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,572
THAT MEANS. 

262
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,940
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT IT SOUNDS 

263
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,843
LIKE IS THAT THEY WILL NOT BE 

264
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,813
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS -- 

265
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,781
WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE TRYING 

266
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:21,587
TO ACCOMPLISH, UNLESS THERE ARE 

267
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,222
OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED IN 

268
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,256
HELPING THEM DO SO. 

269
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,357
PEOPLE RANGING FROM THE 

270
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:28,827
PRESIDENT TO HIS OWN ATTORNEY, 

271
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:30,262
RUDY GIULIANI HAVE COMMENTED 

272
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:34,533
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO. 

273
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,167
THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED ANY 

274
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:35,467
SOLUTIONS. 

275
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,671
THAT'S WHAT THE SUPERINTENDENT 

276
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,205
IS SAYING THEY NEED. 

277
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,273
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED WE 

278
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:41,807
JUST POLICE OFFICERS. 

279
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,310
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS AS IF THIS 

280
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,313
VIOLENCE IS -- THEIR OUTMANNED 

281
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,380
AND OUT GUN. 

282
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,616
>> ONE POINT HE BRINGS UP IS 

283
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:54,820
THAT WE ARE TALKING OUT -- 

284
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,555
ABOUT A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE 

285
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,055
WHO WERE VIOLENT. 

286
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:59,992
AND THEY ARE THE ONES 

287
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,326
RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE 

288
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:05,798
MAYHEM BUT ALSO TO REMIND 

289
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:06,865
EVERYBODY, CHICAGO HAS SOME OF 

290
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:07,867
THE MOST RESTRICTIVE GUN LAWS 

291
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,403
IN THIS COUNTRY. 

292
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,670
BUT A LOT OF THE SURROUNDING 

293
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,405
AREAS AND STATES DON'T. 

294
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,606
AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM 

295
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:13,806
TOO. 

296
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:19,812
THE NUMBER OF GUNS. 

297
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,247
>> WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING 

298
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,382
TO DEAN REYNOLDS IN CHICAGO. 

299
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,483
AND HE HAS BEEN LISTENING TO 

300
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,118
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE. 

301
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,452
DEAN, AS ANNE-MARIE  POINTED 

302
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:29,255
OUT, WE HAVE HAD CONFERENCES 

303
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:35,828
LIKE THIS IN THE PAST. WHAT IS 

304
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,764
YOUR SENSE IF THEY PLAN ON 

305
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,667
DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN 

306
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,802
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 

307
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,370
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS? 

308
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,240
>> Reporter: SADLY, NOTHING. 

309
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,009
THEY HAVE INTRODUCED 

310
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,312
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN CRIME-

311
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,214
FIGHTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT 

312
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,585
BUT THE APPEAL ALMOST WEEKLY IS 

313
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,288
FOR COOPERATION FROM THE 

314
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,788
COMMUNITIES WHERE THIS VIOLENCE 

315
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:07,559
OCCURS AS WELL AS A PLEA FOR 

316
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,396
TOUGHER CONSEQUENCES FOR THE 

317
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,399
PEOPLE FOR DOING THE SHOOTING. 

318
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,434
EDDIE JOHNSON, THE 

319
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,603
SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE WAS 

320
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,271
TALKING ABOUT HOW THESE ARE THE 

321
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,374
SAME PEOPLE WEEK IN AND WEEK 

322
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,009
OUT WHO DO NOT FEAR THE 

323
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,247
CONSEQUENCES OF SHOOTING PEOPLE.

324
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,481
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN GET 

325
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,417
OFF IF THEY ARE CAUGHT. 

326
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,751
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL NOT 

327
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:37,856
BE QUOTE, RATTED OUT BY THEIR 

328
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,225
NEIGHBORS. 

329
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,861
THERE ARE VERY FEW CONSEQUENCES 

330
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,330
AGAINST THEM BECAUSE OF LAWS 

331
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,368
HERE OR JUDICIAL LENIENCY IN 

332
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,303
THE CITY. 

333
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,438
SO WHAT COMES THROUGH WEEK 

334
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,572
AFTER WEEK IS ABUNDANT 

335
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:58,010
FRUSTRATION BY THE POLICE AND 

336
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,145
BY CITY OFFICIALS. 

337
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:03,215
>> YES, I REMEMBER THE LAST 

338
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,583
TIME THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE 

339
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,452
THIS, THE MAYOR WAS THERE AS 

340
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,788
WELL. 

341
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,922
IT ALMOST CAME ACROSS LIKE THEY 

342
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,123
WERE SCOLDING MEMBERS OF THE 

343
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,059
COMMUNITY FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH. 

344
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,594
I WONDER HOW THAT IS GOING OVER 

345
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,430
IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE 

346
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,568
AFFLICTED WITH THIS VIOLENCE. 

347
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,069
>> YOU KNOW, THE NEIGHBORHOODS 

348
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,137
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE 

349
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,038
USUALLY THE POOREST 

350
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,508
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE IS NOT

351
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,311
A TRIED AND TRUE PATH OUT OF 

352
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,148
POVERTY. AND SO DRUG DEALING 

353
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,450
AND PROSTITUTION ARE WAYS TO 

354
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,188
MAKE A LIVING. YOU KNOW, I HAVE 

355
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:46,225
BEEN TOLD WHEN I'VE 

356
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,826
INVESTIGATED THESE THINGS, IF 

357
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,662
YOUR GRANDMOTHER DEPENDS ON YOU 

358
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,699
TO PROVIDE THE RENT FOR HER 

359
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,801
APARTMENT, AND YOU ARE GETTING 

360
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,305
THE MONEY FROM DRUG DEALING, 

361
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,107
SHE IS UNLIKELY TO TURN YOU IN 

362
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,176
IF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN A 

363
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,811
SHOOTING AGAINST ANOTHER GANG 

364
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,612
MEMBER. 

365
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,080
AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. 

366
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,984
THESE ARE OFTEN GANG MEMBERS 

367
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,419
WHO ARE BLOCK BY BLOCK INVOLVED 

368
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,121
IN TURF WARS. 

369
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:20,025
YOU CAN GO TWO BLOCKS THIS WAY, 

370
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,793
IT'S ANOTHER GANG. 

371
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,629
TWO BLOCKS THIS WEEK, IT'S A 

372
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,062
DIFFERENT GETTING.
