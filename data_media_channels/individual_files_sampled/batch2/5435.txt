tonight I can report for you on never-before-seen messages from Michael Cohen because they just leaked in a brand-new lawsuit filed by Michael avenatti in Los Angeles this alleges that Cohen secretly plotted with avenatti zone predecessor that stormy Daniels first lawyer to work against her and help Trump lie about their relationship now that's one new case then there's another development in a case from another woman former apprentice contestant summers er voz with the judge now setting a schedule that could force Donald Trump to be deposed there all this is Muller continues to pursue Paul Manafort for alleged witness tampering and press the White House for a trump interview of his own now this new lawsuit tonight comes from Michael avenatti the president's tormentor in chief if you will and it's not just an allegation that Michael Cohen got stormy Daniels lawyer to illicitly coordinate with him for Trump which we'll get into there's also new material here new leaked evidence that shows Cohen and Daniel's lawyer at the time Keith Davidson worked together this is Wahl allegedly wall he was stormy Daniels lawyer Keith Davidson instead of representing stormy Daniels was more interested in colluding with his quote Powell close quote Keith Davidson was supposed to be representing stormy Daniels at all time is not supposed to be interested in helping out Michael Cohen and Donald Trump now the main charge here is pretty simple it's that this man Davidson was a double agent for Donald Trump the textual him and Cohen talking in January of this year and saying that that would make Davidson a quote puppet for Trump that's how avenatti sees it and they basically described something very interesting the idea that these two lawyers who were supposedly against each other actually worked together to do Trump's bidding arranging a Sean Hannity appearance that stormy would have used to deny any relationship with Trump and yes that is the same Sean Hannity who was a client of guess who Michael Cohen the lawsuit also alleges Cohen did this with Trump's knowledge arguing the Trump is one of the men referenced by Cohen in a newly leaked text from Stormies lawyer that says quote the wise men all the story's dying and thus they should shut down any interviews now Davidson is denying all this we just got a new statement from him and he says this outrageously frivolous lawsuits another desperate attempt by avenatti to continue a quote publicity tour now that whole debate it'll continue to play out in court but the evidence the evidence is playing out tonight in public and some of Michael Cohen's own words are striking the texts show that he says he was quote with FLOTUS the first lady at mar-a-lago on March 2nd which is a very interesting thing avenatti says that trip was specifically for Cohen to meet with Melania Trump to prepare her for news of this very lawsuit now here is why all of this matters these texts that are brand new that we're reading for the first time which clearly the parties never wanted to see the light of day these are Michael Cohen's own words they suggest a plan to lie about Daniel's then maybe went all the way to the top an allegation the Trump and the first lady were in the loop on all of this now I like to be fair as you know if you watch this show if you take all this as true which is an if and if this is the one and only time it happened then the Trump folks could argue it's not that big a deal legally and the Daniell civil case has limited impact and the 60 Minutes interview already air but if this forms a pattern if what we're seeing here in these secret newly leaked texts is a pattern of how Michael Cohen fix things and how he kept Trump in the loop then what will his other texts and files show about any other problems he was quote fixing I can't give you the answer to that tonight I don't know that but I do know tonight that federal investigators are poring over nearly all of those files because Cohen lost his bid to protect most of them and what they find in the Southern District of New York well it won't stay in the Southern District of New York with me now I'm joined by Jacob Weisberg editor-in-chief of slate.com he talked to stormy Daniels during the 2016 election and was at this story from the start criminal defense attorney Brian Weiss a friend of the beat and Matt Miller a former chief spokesman for the Justice Department I begin with you sir we are a long ways from when you initially did outrunning this story because you couldn't nail it down what do you see as important in the new suit well a lot changed re when stormy Daniels went from having one of the worst lawyers in America Keith Davidson - I think one of the best certainly one of the most aggressive Michael avenatti has he been on the show yet tonight or he's taking the evening off well we're four minutes in not been here he's got things got till 7 o'clock but you know it I think he's be a beef he's had from the beginning it's a Keith Davidson was not representing his his clients were me Daniels when he was representing her and you know it's interesting Davidson's business as a lawyer was a very sleazy business he was essentially shaking down celebrities a lot of b-list celebrities which is why he was on a collision course Robbie right well I was trying to get Trump in there it's in the Celebrity Apprentice era but you know he would sort of find something on them and extract these payments but ultimately it was the celebrities who were kind of the customers right and it's very interesting I think what he did with Michael Cohen with probably somewhat characteristic of his legal practice which was he wasn't so interested in the person whose claim he was representing because there was more business to be done with the celebrity ie Donald Trump over time that's exactly what happened with Michael Cohen he realized that if he could represent multiple people with claims against Donald Trump and there were multiple people and he did represent them that it was a nice little continuing source of business but he wasn't representing his clients in the way a lawyer like you would ordinarily do he was running this sort of a little bit of a extortion concession and we're gonna get more into that because we have some very interesting reporting on that in a few moments but on the that point Brian if you're representing someone Brian as a lawyer and you suddenly see that there might be a better opportunity business or otherwise on the other side of the case are you allowed to then just start actively representing the other side of the case absolutely not full-stop the first thing that we learned the first day in law school what we need to tattoo on our foreheads as lawyers is that your sense of loyalty to your client is paramount period and the problem what I've seen with this lawsuit that's how you feel why don't you have a face tattoo well because it's an Orthodox Jew that would that wouldn't be cool look at the end of the day the problem is that Keith Davidson is another one of these Michael Corleone II wannabes who at least in terms of the allegations in this lawsuit when it comes to a sense of loyalty to his client is a lot more like Fredo and this is a guy who if in fact these allegations are true Michael avenatti needs to take him fishing on Lake Tahoe because this business doesn't have any use for a knucklehead like that well and it's clear that Keith Davidson really ought to be working at Dave and Buster's if any of these allegations come within a coat of paint being true re not Miller never go against the family yeah that's exactly right look I think if you look at these lawsuits it's clear that Keith date Keith Davidson has a lot of issues it's it's obvious that he wasn't representing really his client anymore but a party adverse to his client you think the tank is already show enough yeah I think so I suspect he's gonna have bar problems in California bar disciplinary problems and more than that it's hard to see who would choose Keith Davidson to represent them going forward if you look at how he represented this client in terms of the bigger picture I'm not sure this is going to get us closer to answering the big underlying question here which is did the president violate campaign finance law because I suspect what will happen is the same thing that happened in the previous civil suit that stormy Daniels filed and that it'll it'll be delayed probably at Michael Cohen's request and Keith Davidson's requests because Michael Cohen's taking the fifth because it is separate ongoing criminal problems in the Southern District of New York so you know there are a lot of interesting questions off it's clear that Michael avenatti wants to get Michael Cohen you know in a room and be able to take his deposition I suspect we're no closer today to that moment happening than we were yesterday and Bryan this is not the normal course of events in other words if people are watching and going it seems like Michael avenatti is always out with a new thing a new punch a new leak and a new suit that's not how it usually goes down clearly there is stuff here including the text that they got ahold of that gives them a claim they argue a non frivolous claim to go after these people in a new way and this is not isolated in other words whatever one thinks of Cohen Davidson and avenatti this entire pack pattern was also raised in the Karen McDougal suit she prevailed there she got the national choir parent company to back off it was the same set of allegations we did speak to her lawyer about this and it's it's really pretty fascinating given what's now coming barreling at Michael Cohen tonight so take a look at this moment why was Michael Cohen involved I mean it's it's the 64 million dollar question we don't know and you think it's various of course it's an apparent Brian in your view what is the link here and if it's nefarious and there's a pattern of Davidson doing this and it goes to the top and Cohen and Trump know about it what other problems does that create well you talk about problems I know that you're a huge jay-z fan this is a man with more than 99 problems this is a man going well into the triple digits why because the c-word issue is not collusion I've never liked that word never will it's conspiracy it is an agreement to engage in unlawful conduct by lawful means or lawful conduct by unlawful means and look if this goes merely beyond Keith Davidson and Michael cones relationship as it relates to stormy Daniels even if it goes beyond Karen McDougal then not only is Keith Davidson going to have trouble with the California Bar as long as Michael cone is a target-rich environment from Michael avenatti his life is he knows it he's only going to continue to get worse on multiple levels I appreciate the 99 problems reference I don't know why you didn't continue it and say are you a lawyer something somebody important or something but we'll get your bonus the problem no the problem I think frankly is that Michael avenatti wants to make sure in the words of jay-z that Keith that Michael comes casket is closed and I think he's well known as a way to do on that legal casket I assume you're speaking legally not literally gali of course well there's a lot of there's a lot of metaphors in in rap and in law you said it absolutely Brian Weiss thanks for playing as we we say a Jacob Weisberg and that Miller I want you to do O'Brien stay with me I should say the other folks I want to release you because I want to get to this other point here and this is super important Keith Davidson is someone Keith Davidson is someone you may not have heard of he basically had this job that Mike 11 Adi had we were just talking about whether or not he's really good at his job well he initially represented stormy Daniels the difference is Ivan Adi has become as you may know if you're watching kind of a one-man resistance operation Davidson now tonight is facing these allegations in court that he was doing something very different selling stormy Daniels out to the Trump team so Keith Davidson who's not a household name but there are some important pieces of context here he was involved as we were discussing in this Karen McDougal suit she's the former Playboy Playmate who had alleged an affair with Trump and she separate from all of this fire Davidson forgets what for allegedly working with Michael Cohen against her now we've reported on Davidson's past cases before including the Hulk Hogan case allegations that mr. Cohen basically worked with this other lawyer you're referring to Mr Davidson your predecessor in a manner that might have been adverse to his client interests in order to help Donald Trump you're now saying you believe there's smoking gun tape evidence of that absolutely that was we now know a preview of what's happening now Hogan had testified in a trial in 2016 which he won had led to the demise of a website called Gawker there was an issue about a sex tape and the big thing here that's important is there was a personality named Bubba the Love Sponge and there's a question about all these tapes and what happened to them when the video was released my whole world changed put my world upside down just been this overriding haunting of this sac state that God had put out there through this crazy sex tape being released by Gawker you know that I didn't know and be who I was before now Davidson then became the subject of two different investigations for releasing that tape that Hogan was just talking about a federal one a local one that was accusations of extortion now attorneys ultimately declined to prosecute or file charges but there were reports that that was because he was cooperating and right now their reports he's also cooperating with the feds so a lot to get to for this context I want to bring in New York Times investigative reporter Meghan tui to the conversation Brian Weiss stays as I mentioned anyone watching would at least start with the feeling of Wow a lot of shade balls around this story what do you jumps that is important with this new development of the case now against Davidson we just showed some of why he's in so much hot water traditionally well it's interesting I mean Davidson is certainly somebody who more in scrutiny and when in the winter I actually flew out to LA and was trying to track him down I went to his office in Beverly Hills which was like a ghost office nobody you know there was nobody there you went to his office I went to his home he refused to come out and answer questions and some of my colleagues have been able to talk to him but he I think has recognized that that he it is not in his interest to be in the spotlight and undergo this type of scrutiny and I think that his past you know these the the fact that there were these previous investigations is significant but it is also important to note that they didn't you know he wasn't charged as of right now the only thing on his on his record is a brief suspension of his license and I think it was 2010 for like 90 days so he has come under scrutiny by various bodies out there in California and has retained his license and has been able to continue practicing I think you're right but it's interesting it's an it's also important to note that they that what has come out today about his communication with Michael Cohen involving stormy Daniels was not isolated communicate that he had in fact communicated with Michael Cohen around the settlement that Karen McDougal will not a settlement but basically arrangement an arrangement that she made with American media let's write from those texts because as you get into them and as people didn't get an understanding of why he's if anything kind of the anti avenatti this is what he's doing with Cohen quote Cohen says look let her do her thing but no interviews at all with anyone Davidson says a hundred percent Cohen thanks pal just no interviews or statements unless through you Davidson got it does this read to you like to adversaries the way Conan avenatti are or does it read like Davidson's taking orders from Michael Cohen well it's I mean there's there's no doubt that avenatti and Cohen are our adversaries I mean that's the way that he has you know avenatti came out swinging the moment that he started took took over the stormy Daniels representation but when two lawyers have basically struck a settlement on behalf of their clients I don't think that that necessarily has to be adversarial by nature and so I you know I think that there are still questions about the significance of that communication I think that what's interesting in the Karen McDougal case Michael Cohen wasn't a party to that arrangement that she struct with American media so why was Michael Wright why mobbed-up like Forrest Gump exactly so why was why does Keith Davidson messaging calling and messaging Michael Cohen the day that that agreement was struck Brian I'd like I'd like your analysis on the same question Megan striking the measured note that we would expect of a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter that these these quotes in or out of context could go different directions they're not smoking gun the larger context though as she mentions and that I've reported and we've reported previously on this show is that Michael Cohen is popping up all over the place and seems to be allegedly corrupting the representation of these women and I think you're absolutely right look it's the adversarial system it doesn't mean we have to be adversarial but it doesn't mean that you sell out your client if I'm involved in litigation with an assistant district attorney or an AUSA we can be civil but we're not going to be boys we're not going to have cocktails and I'm going to do everything I can to have my clients back and while I think that there is some nuance in these text messages I think the bigger picture seems to suggest that mr. Davidson somehow lost sight of the fact that rule 1 in the advocacy PlayBook is that you have your clients best interests at heart and you have to be willing and the words have noted legal sage Michael Kohn to take a bullet for your client I mean as long as it doesn't hurt hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
