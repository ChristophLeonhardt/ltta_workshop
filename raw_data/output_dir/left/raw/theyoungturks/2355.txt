1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,920
DONALD TRUMP'S REELECTION
CAMPAIGN MADE A QUESTIONABLE

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,880
DECISION IN SOLICITING
DONATIONS FOR HIS 2020 RUN.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,920
CNN REPORTS HERE FOR US --

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:44,379
>>THE EMAIL READS --

5
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:51,820
>>WOW.

6
00:00:51,820 --> 00:01:02,339
A 

7
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:03,420
COUPLE THINGS ABOUT
THIS.

8
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,860
NUMBER ONE, USING A

9
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,990
PICTURE THAT YOU TOOK WHEN YOU
WERE PRETENDING TO CARE ABOUT

10
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,130
THE VICTIMS TO RAISE MONEY IS
PARTICULARLY LOW.

11
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,130
POLITICIANS DO

12
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,799
PHOTO OPS AND IT'S GENERALLY
ANNOYING TO BEGIN WITH, AND

13
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,780
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS DO IT.

14
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,311
WHEN YOU DO IT WITH VICTIMS, I

15
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:24,470
FIND IT MORE ANNOYING, BUT ON
THE OTHER HAND TO BE FAIR TO

16
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,340
TRUMP IF HE DIDN'T GO EVERYONE
WOULD CRITICIZE HIM FOR NOT

17
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,340
GOING.

18
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,230
SO YOU GO AND TAKE A
PICTURE, I TOTALLY GET IT.

19
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,230
THEN

20
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:38,310
FOR YOUR FUNDRAISING, YOUR
CAMPAIGN -- MOST PRESIDENTS

21
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,570
DON'T EVEN HAVE A CAMPAIGN
ORGANIZATION YET TO BEGIN WITH,

22
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,780
HE STARTED IT RIGHT AFTER THE
ELECTION, SO FOR THEM TO THAN

23
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,950
TAKE THE PICTURE -- AND THEN THE
LAST PIECE OF INSULT TO INJURY,

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,500
IN THIS CASE QUITE LITERALLY, IS
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WORKING HARD

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,220
TO MAKE SURE HE PROTECTS YOU AND
IS GOING TO DO SOME SORT OF GUN

26
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,729
CONTROL.

27
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,240
BUMP STOCKS THAT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH PARKLAND,

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,689
FLORIDA, I'M HAPPY, LIFTING THE
AGE BY TWO YEARS -- THESE ARE

29
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,970
MINUSCULE EFFORTS, AND THEN
USING THE VICTIMS TO FURTHER

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,290
FINANCE YOUR PROPAGANDA IS
LOATHSOME.

31
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,700
>>I'M GOING TO THROW A
CURVEBALL AT YOU HERE.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
I'M KIND

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,610
OF OKAY WITH THIS BECAUSE HE
BOUGHT INTO THE LOGIC OF GUN

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,000
CONTROL RIGHT THERE.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,590
BECAUSE
HE'S SAYING -- YOU'RE RIGHT

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,930
ABOUT THE PICTURE TERRIBLE
TASTE, SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT,

37
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,780
BUT AT LEAST HE SANG I BANNED
BUMP STOCKS, AND I'M THINKING OF

38
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,120
RAISING THE AGE TO 21 FOR YOU TO
BUY A GUN, BUT I THINK WE CAN

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,600
SAY THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A
WIN BECAUSE THE ARGUMENTS THEY

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,060
WERE MAKING WAS UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCE IS GONNA REFORM A

41
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,600
GOOD IDEA, NEVER.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,110
AND NOW HE'S
LIKE, I GUESS BANNING BUMP

43
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,590
STOCKS IS A GOOD IDEA AND THE
OTHER LITTLE BIT IS A GOOD IDEA,

44
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,270
I THINK THAT SHOWS WE ARE KIND
OF WINNING.

45
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,320
>>THOSE ARE TINY WINS BUT I HEAR
YOU AND THAT'S A FAIR POINT.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
THE

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,840
ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT LOGIC IS
TRUMP OFTEN LIES AND PRETENDS TO

48
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,400
BE PROGRESSIVE WHEN IT COMES TO
CAMPAIGNING.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I WON'T LET THEM

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,500
CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICAID
AT ALL.

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,000
>>I WON'T OUTSOURCE YOUR JOB.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,150
OF
COURSE.

53
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,040
>>I CAN'T BELIEVE THE
GLOBALISTS, GOLDMAN SACHS,

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
CONTROL TED CRUZ.

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,170
>>AND THEN HE HAS GOLDMAN SACHS
ALL IN HIS CABINET.

56
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,700
>>HE UNDERSTANDS THE COUNTRY IS
PROGRESSIVE, SO THEY GO

57
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,930
WITH A PROGRESSIVE MESSAGE TO
TRY TO GET MORE MONEY AND

58
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,340
THEY TUG ON YOUR HEARTSTRINGS
WITH THAT PICTURE.

59
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,710
>>JUST FOR THE RECORD, AND I
DO THIS ALL THE TIME BUT IT

60
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,760
SHOULD BE NOTED, IF OBAMA HAD
DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,650
THEY WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY
SHREDDED HIM.

62
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,790
>>AT LEAST ONE WEEK ON FOX NEWS.

63
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,500
>>THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE COMMITTEE
HEARINGS ON IT.

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,880
>>HERE IS WHAT'S INTERESTING --
TRUMP KIND OF BUYING INTO THE

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,650
LOGIC OF GUN REFORM EVEN THOUGH
WE AGREE HE'S KIND OF LYING

66
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,590
ABOUT IT, BUT WAYNE LAPIERRE,
THE HEAD OF THE NRA, NOT THAT

67
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,570
LONG AGO, HE ALSO HAD A
DIFFERENT OPINION.

68
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,400
TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIDEO.

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,819
>>WE BELIEVE IN ABSOLUTELY GUN
FREE, ZERO-TOLERANCE, TOTALLY

70
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:19,738
SAFE SCHOOLS.

71
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,870
>>THAT MEANS NO GUNS IN
AMERICA'S SCHOOLS, PERIOD.

72
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,870
WITH

73
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,050
THE RARE EXCEPTION OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OR

74
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,639
TRAINED SECURITY PERSONNEL.

75
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,370
>>I DON'T -- WHAT GOT IN THE
WATER?

76
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,370
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,930
>>I KNOW WHAT GOT IN THE WATER.

78
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,020
AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER

79
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,310
IN THE SHOW, IN THE OLD DAYS,
NOT IN 1999, BUT THE OLD OLD

80
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,510
DAYS, THE NRA WAS STRICTLY FOR
THE MEMBERS.

81
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,510
THEN THEY STARTED

82
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,990
TAKING MONEY FROM THE GUN
MANUFACTURERS.

83
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,800
>>THIS WAS PRE-THAT I GUESS.

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,830
>>IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THE
TRANSITION, THEY STARTED TAKING

85
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,700
MONEY, BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A
COMPLETE WHOLESALE TAKEOVER BY

86
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,050
THE MANUFACTURERS.

87
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,790
NOW, IT'S A
TOTAL TAKEOVER OF THE NRA, AND

88
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,009
THEN THE NRA HELPS TO TAKE OVER
THE BODY POLITIC.

89
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,819
NOW THE SAME

90
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:18,889
WAYNE LAPIERRE GOES OUT AND
GIVES A SPEECH ALMOST 20 YEARS

91
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,949
LATER AND SAYS WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

92
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,169
SCHOOLS SHOULD BE FILLED TO THE

93
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,169
BRIM WITH GUNS.

94
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,009
THE TEACHERS
SHOULD HAVE GUNS, EVERYONE

95
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:28,790
SHOULD HAVE GUNS, THE ONLY THING
THAT CAN STOP A BAD GUY WITH A

96
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,030
GUN IS A GOOD GUY WITH A GUN,
INCLUDING A TEACHER, AND THEY

97
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,650
SHOULD ALL BE THE OK CORRAL.

98
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,650
WHY?

99
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,650
BECAUSE HE'S NOT EVEN

100
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,689
REPRESENTING THE GUN OWNERS OR
THE MEMBERS OF THE NRA,

101
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,690
THEY DON'T EVEN WANT THAT, HE
IS REPRESENTING THE GUN

102
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,069
MANUFACTURERS WHO PAY HIS
OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH SALARY.

103
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:48,909
>>THEIR ARGUMENT TODAY IS MORE
GUNS EQUALS MORE PEACE, BECAUSE

104
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:51,840
THERE ARE MORE GOOD GUYS AND BAD
GUYS, SO IF YOU ARM EVERYBODY

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,289
THEM THE GOOD GUYS WITH GUNS
OUTNUMBER THE BAD GUYS.

106
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,289
IF THAT

107
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,199
WERE TRUE THE UNITED STATES
WOULD BE THE MOST PEACEFUL OF

108
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,319
NATIONS.

109
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,539
THEY ARE UNDERCUTTING
THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT THERE.

110
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,539
I

111
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,189
KNOW IT'S A VIDEO FROM A WHILE
AGO BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED

112
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:12,189
THAT THAT EXISTED.

113
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,469
I ALSO WANT
TO SHOW THIS AMAZING CHART,

114
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:20,629
THERE IS A REAL SEA CHANGE
HAPPENING, CENK, BECAUSE LOOK

115
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:24,759
MANY COMPANIES ARE CUTTING TIES
WITH THE NRA AFTER THE FLORIDA

116
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,810
HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING.

117
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,750
I THINK EVERYONE WAS SAYING WE
THINK SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT

118
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,539
THIS TIME AROUND, IT REALLY
LOOKS LIKE IT, DOESN'T IT?

119
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,729
>>THE RIGHT WING HAS AN
INSTITUTIONAL DISADVANTAGE WITH

120
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,590
CORPORATIONS.

121
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,699
THAT MIGHT SOUND
REALLY FUNNY --

122
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,699
>>ON THIS ISSUE?

123
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,189
>>ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES.

124
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,139
BECAUSE
WE ARE THE ONES TRYING TO GET

125
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,139
CORPORATE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS,
AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARGUE

126
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,250
FOR CORPORATE MONEY IN POLITICS,
MOST ALL THE TIMES, AT LEAST THE

127
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,150
ELECTED REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS AT
THE NATIONAL LEVEL DO. AND YES,

128
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,879
THOSE CORPORATIONS WANT TAX CUTS
AND DEREGULATION AND THE

129
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,050
REPUBLICAN PARTY DELIVERS THAT
FOR THEM.

130
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,020
BUT THERE DISADVANTAGE

131
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,650
WITH CORPORATIONS IS THAT
CORPORATIONS NEED CUSTOMERS.

132
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,650
SO

133
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,379
ALIENATING THE CUSTOMERS, OR
KILLING THEM, IS NOT GOOD FOR

134
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,509
BUSINESS.

135
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,139
IN THIS CASE, IT
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD TO BE GIVING

136
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,970
MONEY THAT'S BEING DESCRIBED AS
BLOOD MONEY IN ANY WAY, SHAPE,

137
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,199
OR FORM, WHETHER IT'S IN THE
FORM OF THESE DISCOUNTS, ETC.,

138
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,889
FOR NRA MEMBERS, TO THE NRA.

139
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,479
THAT TURNS OFF -- WHY?

140
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,479
97% OF

141
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,160
THE COUNTRY WANTS FEDERAL
BACKGROUND CHECKS, UNIVERSAL

142
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,610
BACKGROUND CHECKS, THE NRA IS
OPPOSED TO IT.

143
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,379
TWO THIRDS OF THE

144
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,990
COUNTRY WANTS A STRONGER GUN
CONTROL ACROSS THE BOARD, MORE

145
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:46,539
OF THE CUSTOMERS ARE AGAINST THE
NRA THAN FOR IT.

146
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,539
BY THE WAY, THE

147
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,000
ISSUE THAT THE RIGHT-WING IS
MOST AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH, THE

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,900
EXTREME RIGHT WING, IS
CORPORATIONS DON'T LIKE

149
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,949
RACISM AND DON'T LIKE BIGOTRY
AND DON'T LIKE HOMOPHOBIA

150
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,139
BECAUSE THOSE ARE ALL CUSTOMERS.

151
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,100
>>GAY MARRIAGE TOO WAS ONE.

152
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,220
CORPORATIONS YOU SEE THIS, THEY
WILL GIVE GROUND ON SOCIAL

153
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,070
ISSUES BECAUSE THEY TEND TO NOT
AFFECT THEIR BOTTOM LINE.

154
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,139
>>IT DOESN'T AFFECT THEIR TAXES,
ETC., IN FACT IT COSTS THEM

155
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,289
MONEY IF THEY ALIENATE GAY
CUSTOMERS OR BLACK CUSTOMERS.

156
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:19,150
THERE'S A STORY I TELL OFTEN, I
SAW AN INTERNATIONAL AD THAT

157
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,110
COKE HAD, AND IT WAS FILLED WITH
MUSLIMS.

158
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,770
YOU DON'T SEE THAT MUCH

159
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,930
IN AMERICA, BUT LIKE ONE THIRD
OF THE AD FEATURED MUSLIMS.

160
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,930
AND

161
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,020
I WAS LIKE, OF COURSE, THERE ARE
1.6 BILLION MUSLIMS IN THE WORLD

162
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,210
AND THEY WANT TO SELL
COKE TO THEM.

163
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,570
SO FOR THE STEVE BANNONS OF THE
WORLD THAT IS BAD NEWS.

164
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,010
>>YES, BUT GO TO RAISE THE
MINIMUM WAGE AND THE FANGS

165
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,460
COME OUT, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
ARE WE DOING THAT.

166
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,680
>>THAT IS JUST ACROSS ALL
CORPORATIONS GENERALLY SPEAKING.

167
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,090
THAT EVERYONE OF THEM.

168
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,750
THERE ARE
GOOD CORPORATIONS -- SOME YOU

169
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,700
CAN PUT YOUR MONEY IN -- AND WE
TRY TO FIND THEM, ETC., BUT

170
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,640
OVERALL OF COURSE THEY ARE
FOR LOWER TAXES AND

171
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,440
DEREGULATION, BUT THIS IS THE
ONE AREA WHERE THEY WIND UP

172
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
BEING AGAINST CONSERVATIVES.

173
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,520
>>BUT DO YOU THINK SOMETHING
WILL CHANGE THIS TIME?

174
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
THERE

175
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,080
WASN'T A RUN ON THE NRA AFTER
ANY OF THE LAST SHOOTINGS, NOW

176
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,820
THERE IS, IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE
AT A TIPPING POINT BUT AT SAME

177
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,530
TIME -- THERE WAS A STORY LAST
WEEK, A GOP BILLIONAIRE WAS

178
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,810
SAYING THAT'S IT, I'M NOT
DONATING TO ANY REPUBLICANS

179
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:34,380
UNTIL THE ACT ON THIS ISSUE, YOU
THINK IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

180
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,310
>>I DO, AND FOR WHATEVER
REASON, AND IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE

181
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,490
HOW ACTIVE THE VICTIMS IN THIS
CASE ARE, THE ONES WHO SUFFERED

182
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,150
THROUGH THE SHOOTING, HOW
RELATABLE THEY ARE, HOW

183
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,970
PASSIONATE THEY ARE, AND I THINK
IT WAS JUST ONE SCHOOL SHOOTING

184
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,520
TOO MANY.

185
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,960
AND IN THE POLLING,
NOT ONLY HAS MOST OF THE COUNTRY

186
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,600
NOW SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY
TOWARDS MORE GUN CONTROL, BUT

187
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,580
THE ONES THAT RANK THE HIGHEST
IN THAT CATEGORY ARE PARENTS.

188
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,570
BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IT WASN'T A
ONE OFF.

189
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,570
WHEN IT WAS COLUMBINE

190
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,590
IT SEEMED LIKE WOW, WHAT A CRAZY
THING, AND IN MANY OTHER SCHOOL

191
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,880
SHOOTINGS, AND THEN YOU HAD
NEWTOWN, AND THEY WERE LIKE,

192
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,110
WHOA, HORRIFIED, BUT THE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS WEREN'T

193
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,120
GOING TO COME OUT AND LEAD A
CHARGE.

194
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,290
>>THESE KIDS ARE AMAZING.

195
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,290
I'M
FLOORED.

196
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,990
>>NOW THERE HAVE BEEN SO ANY
MASSACRES BACK TO BACK TO BACK,

197
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,511
ORLANDO AND LAS VEGAS AND
SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS, THAT

198
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,920
PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT,
GOING TO A CHURCH, KILLING

199
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,700
DOZENS OF PEOPLE -- I THINK IT'S
GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE FINALLY

200
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,770
WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS
NOW HAS GOTTEN THROUGH TO

201
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,770
PEOPLE.

202
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,650
OH, IT COULD HAPPEN
ANYWHERE.

203
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,670
IT REALLY COULD HAPPEN

204
00:10:51,670 --> 00:00:00,000
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD OR AT MY
KID'S SCHOOL.
