STEVE: WELCOME BACK EVERYONE.
THAT TRACK, YOU MAY BE A I
BELIEVE TO DECIPHER IT.
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
US V THEM.
IT'S A SAMPLE OF IAN'S BOOK.
LET'S ASK HIM ABOUT IT.
IAN, I THINK OF YOU AS ONE OF
THE ULTIMATE GLOBALISTS.
HANGING AROUND WITH THOSE GLOBAL
ELITES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT ALL OF
THE TIME.
AND NOW YOU'RE TILLING US IT'S A
DISASTER.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> WELL, LOOK, I GREW UP IN THE
PROJECTS AND I CERTAINLY HAVE
BENEFITED ENORMOUSLY FROM THE
ETIOLOGY OF ELITES AROUND THE
WORLD SAYING IF WE JUST OPEN
BORDERS, IF WE HAVE FREE TRADE,
FREE MIGRATION, IF WE SEND OUR
TROOPS ALL OVER THE WORLD TO
CREATE STABILITY, THAT'S GOING
TO BE GOOD FOR ALL OF US
IT'S GREAT FOR THE GLOBALISTS
SITTING AROUND THE TABLE.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN OR THE AVERAGE
EUROPEAN.
AND FOR 40 YEARS NOW THEY'RE
SAYING THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT IS
LYING TO US, THE LEFT AND THE
RIGHT.
WHETHER IT'S THE CORPORATE
CEOs OR THE BANKERS OR
POLITICAL LEADERS, THAT IS WHY
YOU GOT DONALD TRUMP, IT'S WHY
YO GOT
YOUGOT
YOU GT
YOU GOT BREXIT.
THE ONLY COUNTRY WHERE YOU DON'T
SEE THIS AMONG THE WEALTHY
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IS JAPAN,
NO IMMIGRATION, THE POPULATION
IS SHRINKING, THE WORKING CLASS
IS DOING BETTER AND WHERE THEIR
MILITARY IS CONSTITUTIONALLY
FORBIDDEN FROM FIGHTING
ANYWHERE.
THAT'S
THEY'S
THEY'RE THE ONE COUNTRY THAT
REJECTED GLOBALISM.
AS MUCH AS I CAN SAY SITTING
HERE IN MANHATTAN THAT I'VE
BENEFITED, IT'S NOT OKAY FOR ME
TO SAY THAT GLOBALISM HAS
SUCCEEDED.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S
HAPPENING AROUND THE DEVELOPED
WORLD AND RECOGNIZE THIS ISN'T
WORKING.
STEVE: JUST TELL US WHAT ARE THE
KEY ELEMENTS.
WE THROW THESE PHRASINGS AROUND
ALL OF THE TIME.
WHAT ARE THE SIMPLE ELEMENTS OF
GLOBALISM.
>> THERE'S FOUR.
ONE IS THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE
FREE TRADE AND THAT'S GREAT FOR
EVERYONE.
WHEN IN REALITY WE KNOW IF THE
GOVERNMENTS DON'T TAKE CARE OF
THE PEOPLE THAT LOSE THEIR JOBS,
EVEN IF THE GOODS ARE CHEAPER,
THEY FEEL THEY GET SCREWED.
SECONDLY, OPEN BORDERS AND
PEOPLE GET IN AND WE'RE GOING TO
DO BETTER AS AN ECONOMY.
YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE AT
HOME, THEY'RE GOING THE SAY, WHY
HAVE ARE YOU LETTING PEOPLE IN
WHEN I'VE BEEN IGNORED.
THIRD, WE HAVE A BIG MILITARY,
ALLIES SUPPORT US.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHETHER
IT'S AFGHANISTAN, SYRIA, IRAQ,
VIETNAM, WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE
STABILITY.
THEY FIGHT OVER THEIR FAILED
WARS, WITH
WARS, TITH
WARS, THEH
WARS, THEY COME BACK, VETERANS
ADMINISTRATION IS BROKEN.
WHY ARE WE DOING IT.
AND THEN FINALLY THE TECHNOLOGY
IS GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR
EVERYONE.
WE'RE DISPLACING JOBS FASTER
THAN WE HAVE THE GLOBALIZATION.
AND TECHNOLOGY IS RIPPING UP THE
FABRIC OF, YOU KNOW, ESTABLISHED
DEMOCRACIES, MAKING MONEY ON THE
BACK OF ADVERTISING COMPANIES
LIKE FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE.
SO ALL OF THESE FOUR DRIVERS
THAT HAVE LED US TO BELIEVE THAT
WE WERE GOING TO BE CLOSER AND
THAT OUR SOCIETIES WOULD ALL
SUPPORT A GLOBALIST PHILOSOPHY,
ONE WORLD, OPEN BORDERS, FREE
TRADE, ACTUALLY WORKS REALLY
WELL FOR A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF
PEOPLE IN THESE COUNTRIES.
AND THE AVERAGE PERSON SAYS, I'M
SICK OF IT.
I'M EITHER SO ANGRY THAT THE
SYSTEM IS SO RIGGED I'M NOT
GOING TO VOTE AT ALL BECAUSE NO
ONE I VOTE FOR IS GOING TO
MATTER
OR I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR PEOPLE
THAT PROMISES TO BREAK STUFF
STEVE: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
>> I KNOW IAN.
I READ HIS WORK EVERY MONDAY
WHEN HE PUTS OUT A NEWSLETTER
AND IT'S HELPED INFORM ME ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUT
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOU-
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUI
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUM
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUU
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUE
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUD
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUT
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUO
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUA
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUK
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUN
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUG
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUT
INTERESTING WITH, YOU TALK ABOUE
QUESTIONS NOW.
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
GLOBALIZATION AND GLOBALISM.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE?
>> GLOBALIZATION WORKS, YOU OPEN
THE BORDERS WITH, FREE TRADE,
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE GOODS ARE
ABLE TO MOVE EFFICIENTLY, THE
PRICE OF THE GOODS IS CHEAPER
AND THE LABOR MOVES TO THE
PLACES THAT ARE LESS EXPENSIVE.
THAT ABSOLUTELY WORKS.
FOR THE WORLD.
IT'S THE BEST ECONOMIC SYSTEM.
BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF
THE PEOPLE AT HOME, BECAUSE
THERE ARE A LOT OF LOSERS FROM
GLOBALIZATION, EVEN IF IT'S THE
SYSTEM THAT LEADS TO THE MOST
GLOBAL GROWTH, EVEN IF OUR
SHAREHOLDER DO WELL, AMERICA
GROWTH AT THE TOP LEVEL IS GOOD,
THEN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, WE'VE
HAD FLAT WAGES FOR WORKING CLASS
AMERICANS FOR 40 YEARS NOW.
WE HAVE 3.9% EMPLOYMENT.
