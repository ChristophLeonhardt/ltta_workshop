this LAN occupies where the White House is today they're aware of their past pride of their history but keen to protect the future and those six Native American tribes in the US state of Virginia have been granted federal recognition it's an important step in securing funding for schools housing and health care for two decades the Chickahominy Eastern Chickahominy a Parramatta Pawnee Rappahannock Nansemond and Monacan campaigned and Lobby success was never guaranteed but was finally achieved a crag I even get emotional talking about it because I you know something we fought so hard for I've always said anything that helps one tribe in this country will help them all eventually I don't know if it will make it easier for us but they can take what we do and look at it and you know the big thing I hope they learn from it it takes persistence opponents told the tribes not to seek direct federal recognition but apply through the Bureau of Indian Affairs in this case that would have been difficult I know that historically there there were documents that were either lost or destroyed or missing and for whatever reason these delays were were unfairly placed upon the tribes and so as you mentioned these are ancient tribes these are tribes that predated the United States of America in some cases in fact some of the tribes made peace with England before the US was even imagined and so they never signed a formal treaty with America this new deal opens up huge opportunities for the tribes because of direct access to federal budgets they're immediately eligible for those types of assistance which is enormous when you look at medical assistance health care assistance housing education all of those things so it's it's just an immediate boost for them other tribes are looking to see if they should directly seek federal recognition as well but have been warned the fight could be difficult something they've experienced before in their long history Allen Fisher al Jazeera Virginia
