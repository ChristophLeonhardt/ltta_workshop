that you're shocked and wake up so

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,500
amazed then in another dream I saw the

59
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,349
Prophet yet again this time in a

60
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,560
heavenly field and he sent to clear

<font color="#E5E5E5">man's my way who called me over with a</font>

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,720
so serene wasn't meant to happen to me

66
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,310
to me I don't blame anyone who questions

67
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,560
me about any of the dreams I've

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,459
mentioned but they're real I<font color="#CCCCCC"> swear and</font>

69
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:04,859
if sleep is the cousin of death and you

70
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,810
dream what I dream then death is a

71
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,000
beautiful thing

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,870
I hope I die in the scenes I've shared

73
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,930
why because my<font color="#E5E5E5"> dreams are real no need</font>
