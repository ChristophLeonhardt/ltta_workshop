the United States Navy is reviving its second fleet to patrol the North Atlantic Ocean Washington says is to counter growing threats from Russia but what does this cold war rhetoric mean and how will Moscow respond this is inside story hello and welcome to the program mahadeva hamid the US has announced it is reestablishing its naval presence in the North Atlantic as Russia increases its patrol in the area too it's part of a military buildup from both sides that hasn't been seen in decades the second feat was disbanded back in 2011 after more than 60 years of service the reason it was part of a restructuring program to save money at the time we will discuss the real motives behind its revival with our guests in a moment but first they an Estabrook has this report the US Navy says its second fleet will be back in commission this summer operating out of Norfolk Virginia the fleet which was eliminated in a cost-cutting move seven years ago is being re-established to counter what the Pentagon calls a rising threat from Russia at a ceremony in Norfolk on Friday Admiral John Richardson Chief of Naval Operations said our national defense makes it clear that we are back in an era of great power competition as the security environment continues to grow more challenging and complex Russia's Navy has stepped up patrols in the Atlantic and both Russia and NATO have been building up forces in Eastern Europe at levels not seen in decades while Russia has fewer ships than it did during the height of the Cold War US officials are especially concerned about its expanded submarine fleet and increased presence in the Atlantic Ocean but one military expert sees this more as saber rattling than an outright threat of war I think what the Russians will do is probably over time react with more submarines operating in the Atlantic more messages to us that beware but I think that this will be kept at a relatively low level and I really don't see a huge escalation or any escalation proceeding from these actions the u.s. 2nd fleet will be responsible for an area extending halfway across the Atlantic and will include a staff of more than 200 Dyan Estabrook al Jazeera the US says its second fleet will counter what it calls Russian aggression but Moscow sees the situation very differently in 1990 the Soviet Union was given assurances by Western countries that NATO would not be enlarged beyond the reunited Germany but those promises were quickly forgotten and between then and now the North Atlantic Treaty Organization continued expanding eastward adding 13 more members as it carried out major military interventions in the Balkans Afghanistan Libya and beyond no wonder then that US plans to deliver a Patriot missile shield to Poland have been interpreted in Moscow as part of a plot to surround Russia let's now bring in our guests joining us from London Olivier Gaeta managing director of global strat a geopolitical risk and security consultancy firm in Moscow Dmitry Babbage a political analyst at Russia profile magazine and in Washington DC Lawrence Korb former us Assistant Secretary of Defense gentlemen welcome to the program mister Corp let me start with you so are we to assume now that the thinking in Washington is that the fight against ISIL and to national terrorism is not a priority anymore and rather that Russia is a real threat well basically as Admiral Richardson the Chief of Naval Operations said we're back in the year of great power competition it doesn't mean that dealing with threats like Isis in the Middle East have gone away but what it means is they're not gonna get as higher priority as we begin our build on remember this year our defense budget basically went from 600 billion to 700 billion dollars and what they're saying is this extra money is going to go to deal with great power competition particularly Russia and China it's not that we'll do less in the Middle East just revoke these new forces we're adding will focus more on that area okay Dimitri barbecue and received in Moscow of course very negatively because you know we read the strategic national defense strategy written by James majors the new defense secretary which says that the emphasis will be carried from counterterrorism operations to what he called strategic competitions with Russia in China I don't know what Russian patrols in the North Atlantic the American side is talking about right now quite officially there is an ongoing military naval exercise in the Black Sea conducted by the United States it's other NATO allies such as Spain and even Bulgaria with more than 2,000 troops present from various countries and they're exercising in about you know a few hundreds of miles from the Russian territory so basically the the United States and their allies are conducting official exercises in the Black Sea in the Baltic Sea look where the United States is located and where the Black Sea is located so Russia of course views it as an attempt by the United States to achieve absolute superiority over Russia let me remind you that Russia according to the data of Stockholm Institute for Peace Research Russia spends on its own its defense 27% of what NATO's European allies are spending on their defense and of course the United States spends much more so it's simply laughable to talk about any Russian aggression against the west against the EU or against the United States it's clear that the United States wants to be so strong that they would be able to carry out the first strike against Russia with impunity or to be able to threaten Russia with this third strike that's why President Putin in his latest speech to the National Assembly he unveiled these new weapons there are very few of them and the aim of them is dissuasion you know Russia doesn't want to dominate the United States we just want to be able to strike it with I don't know three or four missiles that would stop the United States from threatening Russia or from starting a war which would be a disaster for the whole world well Nature has been complaining for a while that Russian submarines were trying to detect the telecommunication cables between you Europe and the u.s. now let me bring in Olivier Guetta um there's a lot of talk a lot of hype that we're going back to the Cold War at least in rhetoric it sounds like it but what's the reality I think it's it's much better in terms of what you can see as a peaceful environment because I think it's muscle flexing from from two men with large egos that will basically put their foot down and and try to to make do with with the situation but if you look at the larger picture let's look at NATO for instance when President Trump came to power NATO was clearly relevant it had a lot of budget issues and now with threats of making NATO irrelevant President Trump is getting little by little some of the member countries to fund this and more importantly I think that's the second fleet the message that is being sent is that look if they don't and you guys in Europe are gonna start spending money then we'll put our weight behind it and that's what I think is is really the the message in the larger picture I'm not pessimistic in terms of you know a large tract conflict but what we can see is contrary to what pundits said when President Trump was elected is not in Putin's pocket and that is basically one of the aspects when it comes to today is that the US and Russia are on many topics especially in the Middle East on both sides of the aisle if you will well Lawrence called why now well I think the rate and first of all it's important to keep in mind when we say to second fleets not anymore ships they're just putting a headquarters staff there the number of ships will not increase until like 2021 or so and then they're talking about a long term buildup so what this basically says is we're gonna put a group of staffers a couple of hundred people there that will focus on that area of the world which we have not focused on since really since the end of the Cold War and then we in sometimes when we deploy ships rather than sending to the sixth fleet in the Mediterranean the Fifth Fleet and Bahrain that will send more patrols up to the up to the northern Atlantic and the reason we are doing it as secretary mat has been pointed out secretary mattis say that we focus so much on counterterrorism we forgot about great power competition the Russians are increasing their their military they took over Crimea for example they basically are harassing American planes they buzzed the our p8 Poseidon planes that were flying up in the up and up in the northern Atlantic and we're doing the same with China we're basically saying as we increase our defense capabilities which had gone down when the Congress put the Budget Control Act that prevented the Pentagon from buying what it wanted that from now on we're going to give the priority to dealing with great power competition and if you pointed out the the the Russians are also you know threatening to you know break up the cables under the the Atlantic they're getting their ships closer and closer to you to the US mainland so basically now we have a staff there that's gonna be able to direct the ships but I wouldn't overreact like the United States just gotta you know a couple hundred new ships that is going to be sending their the number of ships is at an all-time low it's not even at 300 when we're trying to get it over 300 as I mentioned by the next by the next decade but that's basically it it's to say Joe as we have with the seventh fleet with China now this is where we're going to place our priorities because the danger of great power competition is much less than then to our security then what for example happens with Isis in northern Iraq okay Dmitry Barbic the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sort of pointed the finger at the u.s. saying it was using a confrontational approach but if we also look at Moscow the annexation of Crimea its deep involvement in Syria over flights in certain parts of Western Europe don't you also think that Moscow played a role maybe in creating this sort of atmosphere of suspicion well let me get some facts straight here you know Russia never threatened to disrupt the communication cables between NATO member countries it was the UK defence secretary Kevin Williamson who said he suspected Russia over-over been willing to temper with these cables I think it's a it's a 100 percent provocation just like you know what O'Leary has said you know when just about all of their Western press and the world of Western politicians kept saying a year ago that President Trump was in Putin's pocket that was obviously a lie not even an overstatement but a why because Trump has since done a lot of things which are definitely not pleasant to Russians so there are many you know there are many inventions here you know the West creates phantoms to phantom threats to its own defense and then says that Russia is actually making these phantoms real that Russia is a real threat talking about Crimea let me remind you that Crimea went back to Russia after there was a violent coup in Kiev which made Ukraine a hostile state to rush you know there was a completely new regime that came to power in Kiev for Russia it is a tragedy it is like Canada suddenly a hostile state to the United States the NATO troops are now they have been able to to get as close as 300 miles away from Moscow thanks to Ukraine you know now being willing to join NATO and inviting NATO troops to its territory so from the purely military point of view of course Russia's situation has got a lot worse since the times of the Cold War and I don't quite agree with all of you when he says that it's just two men with huge egos no certainly it's not two men the problem is that the problem is not with men but with ideology I think the situation now is a lot worse than in the worst times of the Cold War in the early 60s when the Soviet Union and China to nuclear super super powers when they were communists and they they threatened the status quo powers saying that their ideology was so much better they wanted to change the regime in the West now Russia and China status quo powers but they're in the minority they were in the minority in the 60s and they're the minority militarily and economically even now now the richest and the most powerful militarily countries in the world the United States the UK France they openly say that they want to change the regime in Russia they want to improve the regime in China and they openly speak about military confrontation Russia and China avoid this kind of rhetoric economically China can outpace even the United States now why would it be interested in a military confrontation Russia is the same Russian elite for many years was willing to join the Western elite it made a lot of concessions like surrendering our positions in Eastern Europe in order to become a part of the West now there is a feeling of great disappointment in Russia and the feeling of great threat from the West that's why we have these what you called overflights of NATO ships in the Baltics look what the United States says and what Russia is vortex is basically a sea which borders on Russia the British troops are now in Estonia a few dozens of I was from Russia at the second capital st. Petersburg we never had such a situation not even before the World War two so that's why Russia feels insecure Olivier Gaeta is Russia right to feel insecure US Secretary of Defense Jim mattis says it's all about deterrence but is that really the main motive behind all of this and also how is the rest of the world going to look at this sort of or perceived military expansion a couple of things I mean we have to go back to the Obama presidency were basically President Putin so rightly so Obama as a paper tiger and Obama with is failing Middle East policy left a void open for Russia to come in remember eight years ago we didn't speak about Russia's involvement in the Middle East so now we're going back to the drawing board and what we've seen with president Trump's character and a way of doing business is much more asserting America's role in the world as much as possible in terms of the different threats so I think that in terms of the perception many might see that you know it's an escalation I think it's just a rebalancing because the u.s. under Obama was totally absent from the world stage in that fashion and remember the EU and especially the Nordic countries are extremely concerned about potential Russians involvement in in their countries and that's why we've seen this revival of narrow and we've seen that the u.s. is coming at least on paper to the help of of the EU in the larger scheme of things what we've seen Syria is one of the examples where we have not seen extremist collation while there are a lot of threats a lot of things have gone bad so what we can see is that there is some kind of modus vivendi that is happening in Syria and I suspect this modus vivendi will happen across the world I am far from being pessimistic on on this whole issue that as I said I think it's just Sabol rattling and it basically has to stick with the geopolitics and the u.s. coming back to being the main force on the geopolitical chess so Lawrence Korb can we look at this as part of making America great again well I think what it really is is rebuilding our defense capability which as I mentioned was hurt when the Congress was more worried about the debt and passed what we call sequestration or the Budget Control Act and also using the extra money not to fight terrorism but to go back to traditional deterrence and the idea is not to attack Russia but the idea is to have a presence there to deter Russia or those in Russia who might want to become aggressive than if they do they'll deal with the United States and remember NATO is building up they're the ones who adopted the idea that they should spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense the United States obviously is happy with this because Americans don't want to think that they're the only ones who are spending an awful lot of money on defense but even if you look at our defense budget it's it's less than 4% of our gross domestic product so the idea that this is a big rearmament know and as I mentioned earlier this second fleet is just a staff and what it means is that sometimes ships that might have gone to the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain are going to go now to the to the to the north and to the northern Atlantic and again the fact of the matter is that the Ukrainian people got rid of their dictator who fled to Russia by the way it wasn't the US that was incorrigible wants to join NATO that's really up to them we are not saying you have to join or you shouldn't join it's really those people in those countries who have made that decision to join because they are concerned about what Russia is up to and Putin doesn't help the speech he gave on March first sounded like hey you know Khrushchev during the Cold War when he said we will bury always talking about hypersonic you know a ballistic missiles he showed a picture of Florida where Trump has his summer White House to say you know that might attack so Putin is his own worst enemy not to mention the fact that the Russians interfered in our election the real questions did it help Trump or not but the fact of the matter is they not only interfered in our election they interfered in elections in in in other countries in Europe so the Russians have become much more aggressive than they were before Putin took over as his second term as a president but one could all see it from the Russian point of view they were guarantees given back in 1990 1991 during the negotiations over the reunification of Germany that NATO wouldn't expand eastwards that was that from those promises were not kept I mean public confidential documents of the time now made public reveal that so the Russians position when they say well you know NATO didn't respect their promises their word why should we also have to sort of protect ourselves we also have to take bold moves well again if you go back and you take a look there is a lot of debate about that where the Secretary of then Secretary of State Jim Baker said to Russian Foreign Minister Sharon Lansing whether in fact you know that really happened there's some debate about that but the fact of the matter is we did not force those countries to join NATO they asked to join NATO and they are freely elected governments who made that decision just as they asked the joint the European Union and just as Georgia and Ukraine asked about joining NATO and the Europe we didn't tell them to do and country should have the right to make their own decisions because Russia is not happy you know um that is I'm sorry today but I'm just gonna put this to Dimitri babbles I see that you have something just say there but briefly because I also want to speak to Olivia Gator if we have some times yeah I understand well just very quickly a point-by-point you know first Lauren said that Russia was not active in the Middle East ten years ago and it became active when Obama was the president it was not Russia who promoted the revolutions in the Middle Eastern countries which led to this renewed Russian involvement it was the United States and the European Union who supported the insurgency in Syria in 2011 presumably peaceful in the beginning but very quickly turning into a civil war and Russia was invited to Syria by the government when the so-called Islamic state was making progress there was expanding despite 11 months of airstrikes from the Western powers which were obviously not very enthusiastic because the ISIS kept expanding in 2015 when Russia came on stage talking about Russia's aggression and the Ukraine and Crimea well I'm sorry
