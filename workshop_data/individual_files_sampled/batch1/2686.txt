welcome back this is you ask we answer I'm Nicolas Carlson thanks for tuning in so we're gonna dive right into the questions our first question is from Logan Edom which is as media mogul backwards we noticed okay so what's your personal opinion on Twitter do you think Twitter will really be as widely used as Facebook I don't think so and I think the reason that is is because Twitter is a great tool for people who love to talk about the talk about themselves talk about the world and just want to get as much content as possible but I think Facebook is a place for everyone really I think as soon as you're in high school or college you have to be on Facebook so all your friends can find you talk to you flirt with you and I think in the business world a lot of people want to be on Facebook so they can network so I just think there's a lot more reasons for a lot more people to be on Facebook than Twitter but I think Twitter will continue to grow even though it's been flat for the past couple months this question is from cam it's a series of questions and it starts with how long can the social gaming bubble last ala Zynga now first let me say it's lovely to hear someone call something in the space a bubble again it's pretty exciting I don't know if it's a bubble though I think that maybe just maybe these companies have found a way and a new revenue model a new thing to charge people for so what happens is people get addicted to a game and it's a turn-based game you play it over and over and you want to like move more quickly in the game so you put a little tiny bit of money into the game to accelerate your progress I think that people have been getting addicted to video games for 20-25 years now and I don't see any reason why they would stop now instead of buying a video game you play it for free and get addicted and pay much less money to move more quickly I don't I don't think there's a bubble and the idea of that happening maybe there's a bubble in evaluations but you know with people buying and with EA buying Playfish for four hundred million dollars it seems like exits are there so I think expect more money to come into this mm so the answer is not soon why don't you guys run more survey polls we we should you're right it we're too lazy says Henry Blodgett okay we're gonna fix that we gonna run more chem ass also asked is Erin your wife out I think he's referring to Erin Carlson who is a media report of his business insider no Erin is not my wife but she does have my last name we also have another Nick and we also have another Aaron so we have four people with Erin Erin Carlson and Carlson it's very confusing okay this question is from Brian and he asks any business relationship with AOL that readers should know about anything like the whole Yahoo relationship that clearly influenced clearly influenced your post during the Microsoft struggle and that's I'm not so sure about how clear there is an influence there but Henry blige does tell me that since the 90s has been dragging a bag of Time Warner stock around rocks he says this question is from the dude I don't know in any AOL stock I have some mutual funds this question is from the dude who asked when did the profession of being a business journalist become all about aggregating other's content I don't think that's fair I don't think it's all about aggregating other's content I think we do plenty of original reporting I get in fights with commenters about this sometimes but here's the thing if you would rather not have us bring stories to your attention you don't have to come here you can just go to like bookmark 25 different sites and go there every morning if that's what you'd rather do it then that's the way to rather do this question is from syria's a series of questions from Sangam gold Bricker what magazines if any do you subscribe to well I I get wired for free from their PR team I read I paid 10 bucks I think to subscribe to Vanity Fair because they had a big subscription push going about a year ago and I also have inscribed and subscribe to The New Yorker for a while I think my wife gets runner magazine it's hard to find time to read all of them mostly they just sort of stack up in my house and was a little bit less lazy the kind of person who put more poles in the site I also might be a person who unsubscribed a few these magazines and just read their articles for free on the internet but and what magazines do you expect will publish their last issues in 2010 tough question I think that a lot of the aspirational magazines that are overlapping like it's if you can see Gourmet magazine going down you might see a lot of overlapping Conde titles they have like several cooking magazines on the same space they have a couple wedding magazines things that overlap at major publishers Sam Goldberg asks also who find this our final question he also asks in the movie version of Business Insider who should play play it we went to my heritage calm and came up with two answers the first was Philip Seymour Hoffman but the second one was Kate Beckinsale and I found that very very interesting creative idea well anyway thanks for tuning in don't forget to submit questions for next week's you asked we answer I'm Nicolas Carlson thanks so much
