IN AMERICA AND THIS IS THE OF THEIR ACTIONS. WATCH. THE SHOOTER IS IN OUR CUSTODY AND BEING INTERROGATED AS WE SPEAK. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TREMENDOUS WORK OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PROFESSIONALS TODAY. THEY WERE ON THE SCENE IN ABOUT 60 SECONDS. BEYOND THAT, THEY WENT IMMEDIATELY INTO THAT BUILDING WITHOUT A MOMENTS HESITATION AND DEMONSTRATED INCREDIBLE COURAGE. Martha: PATRICE GALLAGHER HAS BEEN REPORTING ON THIS SINCE IT HAPPENED AND HE JOINS US LIVE FROM OUR WEST COAST NEWSROOM. OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS NOW REPORTING THAT POLICE HAVE FINALLY IDENTIFIED THE SHOOTER, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT RELEASING HIS NAME AND THERE ARE CONFLICTING REPORTS ABOUT HIS AGE. SOME SAY HE'S A MID-20s AND NBC IS REPORTING HE'S 39 AND WAS IDD USING FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE. IT TOOK A WHILE BECAUSE HE POLICE AND HAD DAMAGED HIS FINGERS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO GET PRINTS. BUT HAVING HIS NAME NOW GIVES POLICE ACCESS TO HIS RECORDS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FOOTPRINT, POTENTIALLY OPENING THE DOOR TO A POSSIBLE MOTIVE. POLICE SAY THE MAN WALKED INTO THE CAPITAL GAZETTE, SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR AND BEGAN SHOOTING AT EMPLOYEES. MORE TERRIFYING THAN HEARING MULTIPLE PEOPLE GET SHOT WHILE YOU ARE UNDER YOUR DESK, THEN HEAR THE GUNMEN RELOAD." DAVIS WENT ON TO GIVE AN INTERVIEW TO THE BALTIMORE SUN, THE PARENT COMPANY OF THE BALTIMORE GAZETTE WHERE HE SAID, "I'M A POLICE REPORTER, I WRITE ABOUT THE STUFF. NOT NECESSARILY THIS EXTENT BUT SHOOTINGS AND DEATH ALL THE TIME. AS MUCH AS I'M GOING TO TRY TO ARTICULATE HOW TERRIFYING IT IS TO BE HIDING UNDER YOUR DESK, YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU ARE THERE AND YOU FEEL HELPLESS." ENDING WITH "I DON'T KNOW WHY, I POLICE ARRIVED WITHIN 60 SECONDS AND THERE WAS NO EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE WITH THE SUSPECT, BUT THE SUSPECT WAS REPORTEDLY CARRYING FAKE GRENADES, SMOKE BOMBS AND FLASH BANG DEVICES. AND HERE'S WHAT POLICE SAID ABOUT AN EXPLOSIVE FOUND ON SITE. WE DID RECOVER WHAT WE THOUGHT MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE BOMB SQUAD ON SCENE. WE DON'T ANTICIPATE HAVING ANY MORE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. UNCLEAR IF THE FAKE GRENADE OR FLASH BANG IS WHAT POLICE WERE REFERRING TO WHEN A STATE DEVICE. THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IS ONE OF THE NATION'S OLDEST NEWSPAPER DATING BACK TO THE 1800s. THAT READS IN PART "WE KEEP DOING MORE WITH LESS. WE FIND WAYS TO COVER HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS, BREAKING NEWS, TAX HIKES, SCHOOL BUDGETS AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT. WE ARE THERE IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY AND WE DO OUR BEST TO SHARE STORIES OF PEOPLE, THOSE WHO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY BETTER. PLEASE UNDERSTAND WE DO ALL THIS TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY." HE ALSO REQUESTED NO INTERVIEWS. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN KEPT ABREAST OF THE NEWS TWEETING "MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE IN THE MEANTIME THREE PEOPLE REMAIN IN LOCAL HOSPITALS IN THE COUNTY CORNER AND INVESTIGATORS REMAIN ON SCENE WE HAVE HEARD VERY LITTLE FROM IT WAS AN INTERN THAT INITIALLY
