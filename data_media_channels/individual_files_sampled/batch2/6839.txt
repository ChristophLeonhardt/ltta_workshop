there's a newly released report by the Institute for social policy and understanding that says that Muslims are internalizing Islamophobia and that the media is to blame the study found that Muslims are more likely than members of other faiths to agree with the sentiment that their community is more quote Rohn to negative behavior than other people let's take a look at one of these graphics so there you can see the isp use third annual American Muslim poll surveyed Muslims Jews Catholics Protestants white Evangelic voles and those who are non affiliated and compared attitudes across the groups what you're looking at now was in response to I believe my faith community is more prone to negative behavior than other faith communities so you can see an overwhelming 30% coming from the Muslim respondents to the survey if you need a little bit of a brush up on what is internalized racism here you go internalizing racism involves ingesting often subconsciously acceptance of the dominant society stereotypes of one's ethnic group what is the takeaway from this study the isp director of research says quote it's the combination of disproportionate media coverage and Muslims being much more focused on that kind of media coverage that explains the fact that Muslims themselves have internalized this very stereotype of being prone to violence the report also found that those who scored higher on the Islamophobia index were associated with greater support for President Donald Trump's travel bans and increased surveillance of American mosques so a pretty pretty startling research were either of you surprised that this was coming out so I actually have a report on this that I am in the middle of writing right for pop culture collaborative it looks at over a hundred years of representation of Muslims on TV and film and it lines up exactly with the findings of the study which is that there aren't available quote/unquote positive or authentic full images of Muslims on television things are shifting now but what we have we have had to ingest through political campaign ads through primetime news through movies like American sniper or Argo was the degradation of our faith and of our communities so it's hard not to and I'll give you an anecdote or there I have many anecdotes but I run a lot of workshops nationally around the representation of Arabs and Muslims on television and film and I do a quick little activity in the beginning where I asked people to think about the images that they see or the things that come to mind when they hear the word terrorist the things that come to mind when they hear the word Muslim and the things that come to mind when they hear Arab and usually what's consistent is that all the same adjectives are used for all three categories and so I've had Muslims tell me afterwards is it weird that I couldn't think of anything that wasn't terrorist like for Muslim mm-hmm and I was like it's not because think about the images that you're constantly being exposed to and yes you might have family structures and communities that are counter to what you're seeing but it's so hard to displace the imagery around you and the thing that also was really striking is the intercepted the story and shout out to Murtaza who is an amazing reporter there and they found that there was disproportionate coverage of violence perpetrated by Muslim seven times on television seven times more and that Muslims received four times longer sentencing for the same crimes as non-muslims so that's I mean it's not sadly it's not surprising that they would view themselves in this way and unfortunately it's double the amount of every other religious communities understanding of themselves in a negative light yeah it's Islam's turn as it happens with religion with regard to history in this country in this world I listen I went to Israel two years ago and I remember having dinner and one of my friends who was a she's a writer was sitting next to me and she laughed at me because I was like I'm getting up and I'm leaving this Palestinian man was sitting here telling me how bad Palestinians were and how horrible they've been to Israel who's been so good to them and that um you know they need to learn and I was just watching this personification of self-hate to a degree that I couldn't even eat my food and I was she was she's Colombian and she was like why does this affect you so much and I'm like my ex-husband is Muslim my children were raised and I'm with some friendly home and not that I was like as a person of color self-hate is something that you know resonates with me because it's so prevalent and all people of color because the the pictures of us are so bad that are constantly being depicted that we are all walking around trying to dispel the myths of our own people because we feel a responsibility to that while white people get to glide about around the planet just being white because they don't have to carry the weight of all white people right they don't have to carry the burden of representation and to see what the consequences are for that as well so I just quickly add there was this interesting roundtable conversation with producers and showrunners with the New York Times after Trump selection and the showrunner for Quantico said that he wanted to stop doing terrorist terrorism plots after the election and the New York Times reporter pointedly asked Howard Gordon from 24 and homeland if he felt like his show was contributed to the negative sentiments about Muslims anti-muslim rhetoric and sentiments and he said yes and he was he also had kind of a coming to Jesus moment as well but those folks are not just doing that for Trump's pace but as we were saying people in in my community are also feeling that way and I'll just lastly add that it's hard because we carry that burden and at the same time we are horrified by the violence perpetrator too mostly our community by groups like dodge I saw or any group purporting to lead a Muslim quote/unquote Caliphate or whatnot but then we're also made to speak to it and they're killing us in Syria and Iraq and Yemen and and in parts of West Africa and so we're I think we're just in such a rock and a hard place it's hard to even think straight two easy ways for Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button
