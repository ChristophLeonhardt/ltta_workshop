8
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:12,690
mode of conversation quite a lot

9
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently you can actually see this i</font>

10

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,170
television as being my first growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

13
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,820
battle purchase or whatever it keeps

14
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,140
cropping up everywhere Lex and I

15
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably can't go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leakycon drink 14</font>

16
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,230
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year because of other commitments</font>

17
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,199
but also just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's in peak time</font>

18
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,269
for the UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just the travel was</font>

19
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,130
pretty difficult but gonna see what we

20
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,809
didn't do I gave her a call I said well

21
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,880
we should go on a grown-up holiday to

22
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,320
Greece or something just that

23
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,649
terminology time time again get it get a

24
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,989
grown-up flat get a grown-up rental be

25
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">grownups</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's still a mode of I</font>

26
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,100
guess like let's pretend and I don't

27
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,079
know whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just because it is</font>

28
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,149
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do when your kid like I at</font>

29
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,399
least would play shops and teachers all

30
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,960
the time when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was very young and I</font>

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,780
loved it I loved the idea of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> older</font>

32
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,129
especially cuz I have two older sisters

33
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,770
like there was a certain like I don't

34
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a club that I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

35
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't part of that I wanted to be proud</font>

36
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,500
of I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really push in like</font>

37
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,530
Western culture especially this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

38
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">like infantilized view of the world</font>

39
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,189
music about high school films about it a

40
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,350
TV shows about it as well the high

41
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">school years and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sometime three and</font>

42
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,090
then we dump we kind of jump to the next

43
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,560
level missing out the weird transition

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,450
stage into an<font color="#CCCCCC"> adult you get a lot of the</font>

45
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,180
bits after in the bits before but you

46
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,770
don't actually get that transition maybe

47
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,570
because it's such a slow transition I

48
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,130
don't know there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I've</font>

49
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,240
been thinking about quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

50
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,009
I find it rather you find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

51
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,950
representation of properly becoming an

52
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,350
adult not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the bildungsroman</font>

53
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,420
story that doesn't quite take you there

54
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,950
maybe it's cuz that never happens i

55
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,840
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know so think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that a lot</font>

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just kind of the terms in which i've</font>

57
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,840
thought about the changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have made</font>

58
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life over the past year and how like</font>

59
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,820
this flat for example feels like a very

60
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">grown-up flat because we have stairs and</font>

61
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,149
it's just that it's that weird thing

62
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">like having stairs and having two floors</font>

63
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,990
somehow makes it feel a bit more grown

64
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,490
up despite the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that i had a</font>

65
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,680
university house and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had like the</font>

66
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,020
bunch of stairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> there like three flights</font>

67
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,399
of stairs or something ridiculous it's

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,449
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this that makes it feel</font>

69
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,209
like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> a proper grown-up flat more</font>

70
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:12,900
than I

71
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
last place and about buying flowers

72
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,409
which I know I do pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much every week</font>

73
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,060
whether it's at a liberal local

74
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,799
supermarket or at the actual market and

75
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:20,909
I go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market and buy the flowers</font>

76
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's lovely i love doing that but</font>

77
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,209
that again also<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

78
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,000
grown-up exercise and like paying

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,310
council tax like contributing in that

80
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,049
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and paying national insurance and so</font>

81
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,569
on contributing again like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels</font>

82
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,700
really valuable it's a pain in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

83
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,260
ways like it I'm not gonna pretend I

84
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,079
love for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any outs of sex but it's it's</font>

85
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,760
kind of a nice feeling in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways</font>

86
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,290
as well you kind of like own own

87
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself of it I've spoken about this</font>

88
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,950
before in another video but you do feel

89
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,129
like it is all more settled and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

90
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,870
a little more power<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> waist and we do</font>

91
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">under eight adulthood I think</font>

92
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,099
everything's become in terms of being

93
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">grown-up or playing playing grown-up so</font>

94
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,370
I just kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get your thoughts</font>

95

where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you can see the some of</font>

101
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:17,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ones that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had up to this point</font>

102
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,319
