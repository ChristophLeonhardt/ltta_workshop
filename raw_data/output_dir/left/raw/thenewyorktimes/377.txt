1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,000
Forty years ago, in August and September of 1977,

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,020
a band of humans launched a pair of robots

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,340
to explore the solar system and probe the infinite darkness beyond.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:23,380
"3, 2, 1. We have ignition and we have liftoff!"

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,200
Taking advantage of a rare planetary alignment,

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,400
the twin Voyager spacecraft raced outward toward Jupiter,

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,940
then used the giant planet's gravity to slingshot on to Saturn.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,660
At Saturn they parted company.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,220
Voyager 1 turned upward, leaving the plane of the planets

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,040
and heading toward interstellar space.

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,160
But Voyager 2 kept trekking,

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,760
spiraling outward on a grand tour of the outer planets,

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,100
toward distant Uranus and Neptune.

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,120
At each planetfall, fuzzy dots bloomed into worlds.

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,060
Every image sent back to Earth

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,720
was another lesson on nature's ability to surprise.

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,160
Voyager saw swirls within swirls in Jupiter's banded jet streams.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,220
Volcanoes spouting sulphur on Jupiter's moon Io,

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,140
a tormented world twisted and pulled by gravity.

20
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,960
And eggshell-smooth Europa,

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,060
an icy shell around a hidden ocean.

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,940
Two years after Jupiter,

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,840
the Voyagers approached Saturn, jewel of the solar system.

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,340
Its broad rings dissolved into thousands of grooves, 

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,880
like a phonograph record.

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,320
Braided, kinked and patrolled by tiny moonlets.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,380
Voyager probed the methane skies of Titan.

28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,400
It slid past two-faced Iapetus, with light and dark sides.

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
Giovanni Cassini's disappearing moon.

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,880
And Enceladus. Trapped under its crust of ice

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,680
is another dark ocean, and perhaps living creatures.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,740
After Saturn, Voyager 1 turned away from the planets

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,400
but Voyager 2 sailed on.

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,400
Voyager found ghostly Uranus tipped on its side,

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,980
its south pole facing the sun.

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,380
A blue-green bulls eye with faint rings.

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,100
Voyager slipped passed methane-blue Neptune,

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,840
a pacific-looking world bruised with dark, violent hurricanes.

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,680
Antennas on Earth strained to hear the trickle of data

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,580
from almost 3 billion miles out.

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,960
Voyager 2's last port of call was Triton, Neptune's biggest moon.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,100
A mottled ball of exotic ices,

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,120
plumed with dark geysers of nitrogen.

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,060
One final world added to Voyager's tally.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,960
But the Voyager mission was not only to observe.

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,600
Each spacecraft carried a message.

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,320
A gold record, with a needle and instructions on how to play it.

48
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,360
A time capsule from the 1970s, 

49
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,620
grooved with the sights and sounds of Earth.

50
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,680
"I send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet.

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,280
"We step out of our solar system, into the universe,

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,540
"seeking only peace and friendship,

53
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,000
"to teach if we are called upon, to be taught if we are fortunate."

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,760
Of all the voices ever recorded, of all the photographs ever taken,

55
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,780
these few will survive the end of our planet.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,420
Scratches on gold, adrift in the void.

57
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,560
As Voyager 1 climbed away from the planets, 

58
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,800
it turned its cameras backward.

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,300
To snap a family portrait of the worlds it was leaving behind forever.

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,760
The Earth appears as a bright pixel in a wash of scattered sunlight.

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,820
A "Pale Blue Dot" in the words of astronomer and cosmic sage, Carl Sagan:

62
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,500
"Consider again at that dot.

63
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,280
"That's here. That's home. That's us.

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,740
"On it everyone you love, everyone you know,

65
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,880
"everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was,

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,380
"lived out their lives. ...

67
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,660
"The Earth is a very small stage

68
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,740
"in a vast cosmic arena."

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,020
No other spacecraft have gone so far,

70
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,720
or explored so many new worlds.

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,740
In the fullness of galactic time the Voyagers might yet be found,

72
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,920
but by then the human race could be long extinct.

73
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,580
Long after they have ceased speaking to us,

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,380
the twins will forever drift among the stars.

75
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,480
Mute, but carrying sounds and greetings from home.

76
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,380
"Hello from the children of Planet Earth"

77
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,040
The last lonely evidence that we too once lived in this starry realm,

78
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,200
on an island of ice and rock. 

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:00:00,000
As Carl Sagan put it: "A dust mote in a sunbeam."
