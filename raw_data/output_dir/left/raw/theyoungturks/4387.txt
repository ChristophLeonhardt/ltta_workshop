1
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,019
>> NFL PLAYERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO SUFFER FROM BRAIN DAMAGE AS A

2
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,710
RESULT OF THE SPORT THEY PLAY.

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,699
INVOLVED A NUMBER OF NFL PLAYERS

4
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,659
THAT SUFFERED FROM SEVERE
DEPRESSION AND SOME WHO EVEN

5
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,370
COMMITTED SUICIDE AS A RESULT.

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,050
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS FOUND

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,600
BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT HEAD
TRAUMA THAT NFL PLAYERS HAVE TO

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,879
EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT THEY ARE
LIKELY TO DEVELOP A CONDITION

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,630
KNOWN AS CTE.

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,750
IT COULD LEAD TO
THINGS LIKE MEMORY LOSS, MOOD

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,010
SWINGS, IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AND
ALSO DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL

12
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,219
THOUGHTS.

13
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,340
RESEARCHERS OF BEEN
DELVING INTO THIS ISSUE EVEN

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:23,159
FURTHER AND RECENTLY Ã± THAT
NUMBER IS PRETTY HIGH BUT WHAT

15
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,960
HAPPENS WHEN YOU STUDY THE
BRAINS OF NFL PLAYERS

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:43,520
SPECIFICALLY?

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,509
THESE BRAINS THAT
WERE STUDIED BY THESE

18
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:52,740
RESEARCHERS WERE DONATED BY
FAMILY MEMBERS OF DECEASED

19
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,390
FOOTBALL PLAYERS YOU HAVE
SUSPICIONS THAT THE PLAYERS HAD

20
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,729
CTE.

21
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:04,600
THE SAMPLE IS SOMEWHAT SKEWED
AND THE ACTUAL NUMBERS

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,899
MIGHT BE LOWER.

23
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:17,000
>> THE NUMBERS ARE SO HIGH THAT
IT STILL GIVES YOU A SHOCKING

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:32,370
PERSPECTIVE INTO HOW DEEP THIS
PROBLEM IS. 99%, THAT 

25
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,370
IS

26
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,739
UNBELIEVABLE.

27
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:50,959
IT IS 
ENORMOUSLY

28
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,890
DISHEARTENING BECAUSE I LOVE

29
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:10,280
FOOTBALL.

30
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,769
I AM JUST BEING
TOTALLY HONEST ON MY HYPOCRISY

31
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:29,630
ON 

32
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,329
THIS ISSUE.

33
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:44,429
>> AMONG COLLEGE PLAYERS IT'S
91%.

34
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:47,790
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR
YEARS OF BANGING MY HEAD.

35
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,790
I

36
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,120
THOUGHT ABOUT PLAYING IN
COLLEGE.

37
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,579
THERE ARE TWO FACTORS,

38
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,980
THERE'S AN EXCELLENT CHANCE I
WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

39
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,980
THE SCHOOL I

40
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,139
WENT TO IS NOT KNOWN FOR
FOOTBALL.

41
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,800
THE OTHER THING IS IT

42
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,549
TAKES TOO LONG.

43
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,489
IF I PLAY
FOOTBALL AND THEY HAVE ME

44
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:13,380
PRACTICE EIGHT HOURS A DAY I'M
WORRIED ABOUT MY GRADES.

45
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,380
SO I

46
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,500
PLAYED A MUCH LESS VIOLENT
SPORT, RUGBY.

47
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,990
BUT YOU ARE NOT

48
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,430
CONSTANTLY BANGING HEADS.

49
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,710
THE
HELMET MIGHT BE THE MOST

50
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,080
IRONICALLY DANGEROUS INVENTION
WE HAVE HAD TO PROTECT ATHLETES

51
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,699
EVER.

52
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,639
>>I WANT TO QUICKLY GO BACK TO
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT

53
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,340
SOMEONE IS HYPOCRITICAL IF THEY
CONTINUE TO WATCH FOOTBALL

54
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:50,370
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW.

55
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,889
AT
LEAST NOW THE INFORMATION IS OUT

56
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,150
THERE AND THE NFL IS NOT
ATTEMPTING TO COVER IT UP.

57
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,150
ONE

58
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,240
OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE STORY
WAS THE SCANDAL INVOLVING THE

59
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,620
NFL TRYING TO BRUSH THIS UNDER
THE RUG.

60
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,610
ADULTS COULD NOT MAKE A

61
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,259
DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
THEY WANTED TO PLAY FOOTBALL OR

62
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,020
WANTED TO ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO
PLAY IT.

63
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,250
I SAW THAT AS A

64
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,250
PROBLEM.

65
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,740
IF THE INFORMATION IS
OUT THERE AND IT IS WELL-KNOWN

66
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,490
THAT THIS IS A POTENTIAL RISK OF
PLAYING THE SPORT, THEN PEOPLE

67
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,300
GET TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

68
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,940
>>I KNOW.

69
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,740
I FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT MMA AND I DON'T WATCH IT.

70
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:46,180
IT IS 
MODERN-DAY 

71
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,319
MANDINGO
FIGHTS.

72
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,270
IT IS MISSING THE RACIAL

73
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,270
COMPONENT.

74
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,909
BUT WE ARE BASICALLY
THROWING THEM IN THE RING AND

75
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,750
SAYING RIP EACH OTHER APART.

76
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:03,759
BUT
STILL THERE IS SOMETHING

77
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:13,240
UNSETTLING 
ABOUT IT.

78
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,910
>> YES.

79
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,999
>> ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE TO
WATCH FOOTBALL KNOWING THAT 99%

80
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:28,439
OF NFL PLAYERS WILL GET THIS
DEGENERATIVE BRAIN DISEASE?

81
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,439
IT

82
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,969
IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION AND I
DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY YOU ARE

83
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:39,619
GOING TO COME OUT ON IT.

84
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:42,729
>> I WILL ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO
VOTE IN OUR POLL IF YOU DON'T

85
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,760
WATCH FOOTBALL ANYWAY.

86
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,419
FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO WATCH FOOTBALL WILL

87
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:54,499
YOU CONTINUE TO WATCH IT KNOWING
HOW MUCH IT DOES DAMAGE TO

88
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,249
ATHLETES?

89
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,370
JUMPING FROM 21%
CHANCE OF WHEN YOU PLAYED IN

90
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,090
HIGH SCHOOL TO 91% IF HE PLAYED
IN COLLEGE THAT IS A GIANT

91
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,810
DIFFERENCE.

92
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,379
IF YOUR KIDS ARE
THINKING OF GOING TO COLLEGE

93
00:07:09,379 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T THINK IT IS JUST THE NFL.
