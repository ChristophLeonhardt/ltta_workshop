1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,140
If you don't look carefully

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,340
though, you might miss what it's
advertising.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,830
It's this little thing and

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,180
it's called:

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,000
Juul, Juul, Juul

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,019
looks more like a
flash drive or computer device but it is

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,340
really another kind of e-cigarette.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,529
Since it launched in 2015

9
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,510
Juul has taken over about 70% of the
e-cigarette retail market share. It's now

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,949
worth about 16 billion dollars. And that
success is often attributed to its sleek

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,539
design, but the same features that make
Juul a well-engineered product also

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,200
make it attractive to young people, many
of whom have never smoked before and

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,010
that has people worried because devices
like Juul might be designed to help

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,969
smokers get off cigarettes, but they're
also addicting a new generation to

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:42,860
nicotine.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,600
So what makes this one 
e-cigarette so different from the rest?

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,280
Answering that question starts with what
you see on the outside. Juul is an

18
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,070
e-cigarette, but it really doesn't look
like one. It looks like a tech product

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,690
and it's tiny. That allows smokers to get
a nicotine fix without having to worry

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,560
about social stigma, but also allows
young users to consume nicotine

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,800
inconspicuously without having to worry
about who sees them.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,610
Going to school

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,990
having this in your pocket is a lot
better than having like something this

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,350
big, that looks kind of like a lightsaber,
you know? You could kind of Juul

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,780
anywhere in discreteness.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,420
That discreteness is a big shift for

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,740
e-cigarettes. Since the first patent in
1930 designs haven't been very subtle.

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,000
The first generation of e-cigarettes
mimicked the shape size and colors of

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,619
traditional cigarettes, sometimes even
with a fake light-up tip. The second and

30
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,850
third generations focused on larger and
more customizable devices, with longer

31
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,180
battery life and big plumes of vapor.

32
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,079
Then came the Juul, a stripped-down

33
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,909
version with no buttons, no big plumes of
vapor, and no complex refilling or

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,840
recharging and it comes in a variety of
bright colors that set it apart from

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,409
other e-cigarettes. Which made it look
like a tech product that young people

36
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,060
were already familiar with.

37
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,850
That is why
people called Juul the "iPhone of e-cigs."

38
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,229
And that similarity makes sense.
Juul's founders met at Stanford design

39
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,039
school and one worked as a design
engineer at Apple.

40
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,880
They created the first 
e-cigarette that looked more like a cool

41
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,600
gadget and less like a drug delivery
device.

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,050
This wasn't smoking or vaping, it

43
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,300
was Juuling.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,020
Yeah like how grandma's have
iPhones now, it's kind of like normal.

45
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,540
Kids have Juuls now, because it looks
so modern. We kind of trust modern

46
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,450
stuff a little bit more, so we're like we
can use it we're not gonna have any

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,400
trouble with it, because you can trust it.

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,010
The tech aspect definitely helps

49
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,580
people get introduced to it and then
once they're introduced to it

50
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,890
they're staying, because they're
conditioned to like all these different

51
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,630
products and then this is another
product and it's just another product

52
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,120
until you're addicted to nicotine.

53
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,820
And that is where it gets tricky. A 2017

54
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,830
study found that 25% of 15-24
year-olds recognize the Juul in a photo,

55
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,450
but the majority of them didn't know
that it always contains nicotine. It's

56
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,500
easy to trace that information gap. You
just have to look at the ads. When you

57
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,760
look at Juul's marketing today you find
video testimonials from adult ex-smokers.

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,550
My name is Lauren. My name is Brandy. My name is Carolyn.

59
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,540
My name is Iman, I'm 38. But when Juul
first launched, their marketing looked a

60
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,760
lot different.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,170
When you put those ads
alongside old cigarette ads, the

62
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,000
similarities are pretty striking.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,390
Both marketed relaxation, sharing, travel,

64
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,440
freedom, and sex appeal.

65
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,070
It's now illegal
for cigarette brands to use these kinds

66
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,020
of suggestive advertising themes,

67
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,880
but for e-cigarette manufacturers

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,230
who had products on the market

69
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,120
before 2016, those strategies are still
unregulated. That's why a brand like

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,140
Kandypens can be promoted in DJ Khaled
music videos, just like tobacco

71
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,840
corporations used to pay stars to smoke
their cigarettes on screen.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,880
But compared

73
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,800
to cigarettes, Juuls are a lot easier to
start using. Typical e-cigarettes have

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,760
between six and thirty milligrams of
nicotine per milliliter of vape liquid.

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,530
One Juul pod packs in 59 milligrams.
That's three times the nicotine levels

76
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,730
permitted in the European Union, which is
why Juul isn't sold there. But here in

77
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,600
the US, e-cigarettes don't have the
same restrictions even though we know

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,290
that nicotine dependency can prime
developing brains for future substance

79
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,380
abuse disorders.

80
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,370
The company says that
Juul's nicotine content is about as much

81
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,180
as a pack of cigarettes, though tobacco
experts say it's likely more than that.

82
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,220
And Juuls have a patented system for
delivering that nicotine. Most e-cigarettes

83
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,120
use a potent version of nicotine called
freebase that gives users a strong hit,

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,480
but Juuls vaporize a liquid made from
nicotine salts.

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,740
Those salts allow

86
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,250
nicotine to be absorbed into the body at
about the same speed as regular

87
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,220
cigarettes, much faster than most e-cigarettes.

88
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,600
But unlike freebase nicotine

89
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,160
which can be irritating, nicotine salt
goes down smoothly.

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,430
So Juul packs a

91
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,030
bigger nicotine dose into a much more
pleasant hit than most devices on the

92
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,150
market and that has public health
officials worried because the US

93
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,920
almost beat nicotine addiction among
kids.

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,340
As cigarette smoking among those

95
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,720
under 18 has fallen, the use of other
nicotine products and especially e-cigarettes

96
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,520
has taken a drastic leap.

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,340
In April, the FDA demanded that Juul submit

98
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,620
documents on its marketing and research.

99
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,490
A group of senators sent a letter asking

100
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,090
Juul to stop using flavors and designs
that appeal to children and there are now

101
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,420
three lawsuits alleging that Juul
contains too much nicotine.

102
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,259
In response,

103
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,710
to the concerns the makers of Juul
have pledged thirty million dollars to

104
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,140
combat underage use.

105
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,550
Merchandise and
marketing materials now have big warning

106
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,330
labels on them and the company is
developing lower nicotine pods. The

107
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,570
trouble is there's still a lot we don't
know about the long-term health impacts

108
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,620
of e-cigarettes.

109
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,349
Juul, like other
e-cigarettes might have set out to

110
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:42,070
design a solution to a public health
problem, but in a lot of ways their

111
00:05:42,070 --> 00:00:00,000
product has created a new one.
