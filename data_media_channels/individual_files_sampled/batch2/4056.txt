and thanks to at home for joining us this our super happy to have you here happy Thursday today's news has been full of all sorts of surprises we've got NBC investigative reporter Carol Lee joining us tonight she's got a big scoop tonight we've also got the single best reporter in the country on Veterans issues joining us tonight so big show tonight it's a lot going on one year ago when President Trump fired all the US attorneys all the federal prosecutors across the country that got a bunch of attention for two reasons first was that he did it suddenly and with no warning and over the years lots of presidents have decided to replace all the previous US attorneys but nobody has ever done it this way with the demand that they all get out of office that day hand in your keys get out no handover planned no time to wind up any cases or even set up any ongoing management arrangements so it made a lot of news one because it was very sudden it seems to be maybe an impulsive decision it did not seem to be a well planned out thing which is a serious thing when you're talking about federal law enforcement that move also made news because some of the US attorneys who got fired were very high-profile people for example Preet Bharara the US Attorney for the Southern District in New York he was somebody who was very high-profile and furthermore he had been publicly a short of the right to keep his job the president in the Attorney General that said that he'd be able to stay on in the Trump administration as US attorney in the Southern District of New York so when Preet Bharara was fired that was a real point of focus so it was a year ago that shock decision came down to the suddenness of it it's the high-profile US Attorney's being pushed out that's what made all the news in the year since those firings happened though while those things are also still interesting what's turned out to be super interesting in the long run is that even though it really was a mass firing out of the blue last March there ended up being a tiny handful of US attorneys the president decided he would hold on to none of them was famous at all at the time they've all become a little bit famous since they include Rod Rosenstein at the time was US Attorney in Maryland they didn't get rid of him he ended up becoming the number two official in the Justice Department Deputy Attorney General in that role he is the direct supervisor of the Robert Miller Special Counsel investigation and so therefore rod Rosen Stein has been publicly attacked by the President of the United States there was also Dana Bente who was a US attorney in Virginia he was brought on to be acting Attorney General after the president fired Sally Yates he then became Acting Deputy Attorney General until rod Rosen Stein was sworn in he then became a head of the National Security Division at the Justice Department and then mysteriously Dana Bente was fired or at least he was ousted from the Justice Department with no warning and no explanation that still remains a mysterious turn of events so let me actually just let me take this moment to make it publicly if you have any information that can explain what happened to Dana Bente in terms of his sudden removal from the Justice Department after they put him in that series of all those highfalutin jobs that remains an unsolved mystery of the Trump era if you know anything about that we would love to hear from you ww send it to Rachel comm that affords you a number of ways where you can confidentially get in touch thank you public service announcement over so there's rod Rosenstein household name now there's dana bent a intriguing mystery man and you should also know that there's this man his name is John W Huber one of these handful one of this handful of US attorneys who wasn't fired he was US Attorney in Utah when Trump took office and unlike almost every other federal prosecutor in the country he still has that job to this day US Attorney for Utah like Dana Benton rod Rosenstein he is basically a respected fairly non-controversial definitely non high-profile career prosecutor but now John Huber is about to have his time in the spotlight as well Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year made a very high-profile ultimately very consequential announcement about recusal not long after he was confirmed as Attorney General it was discovered by investigative reporting that he had not told the truth during his confirmation hearings about his own conduct with the Russian government during the time that he worked on the Trump campaign after initially issuing a bunch of fierce blanket denials jeff sessions ultimately had to concede that yes he had had those contacts and basically he had lied about them and a lot of people expected at that point that he would have to step down as attorney general but instead what he did was he announced a broad recusal he announced he would stay as attorney general but he would recuse himself he would pledge to not involve himself with anything at the Justice Department or the FBI that related to the 2016 campaign including anything related to the Trump campaign and also the Clinton campaign I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign the exact language of that refusal is in the press release that we we will give to you I've said this quote I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States that was Attorney General Jeff Sessions a year ago after he got found out lying about his own contacts with Russian government officials during the campaign and that announcement if his recusal is the reason why not jeff Sessions but rod Rosenstein oversees the Russia investigation related to the Trump campaign but it should be noted that that recusal should have taken him out of involvement in anything involving either of the campaigns and that's on top of the commitment he made during his confirmation hearing that he would stay away and not involve himself in any investigations that involved Hillary Clinton that were raised as a campaign issue mr. chairman it was a highly contentious campaign like a lot of people made comments about the issues in that campaign with regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I mean I do believe that that could place my objectivity in question I've given that thought I believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations and that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign Lauren could be otherwise connected to it any questions involving those kinds of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton that were raised during the campaign or could otherwise be connected to it okay Attorney General Jeff Sessions is supposed to be recused from anything at the Justice Department of the FBI that involves either presidential campaign during the last election and any of the Hillary Clinton investigations that the Trump campaign made hay out of during that contest broad refusal the fact that he is supposed to be recused from any of those matters of course raises questions about his involvement in the firing of the FBI director and the deputy FBI director remember both James Comey and Andrew McCabe were ostensibly fired because of their actions related to Hillary Clinton investigations during the campaign so what's Jeff Sessions doing being involved with either one of those firings on top of that there have been these calls from Republican members of Congress fueled by conservative media demanding that the FBI's handling of any investigations related to Hillary Clinton the FBI's handling of those matters should itself be reviewed Republicans in Congress have insisted that the FBI was was wrong in the way that it pursued those investigations because Secretary Clinton was somehow let off the hook so they want to investigate the FBI for not locking up Hillary Clinton and they want to investigate the FBI because the FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election they want to investigate the FBI for investigating that they want to investigate the FBI for them getting a court to approve multiple search warrants to surveil a Trump campaign adviser who for years was believed by the FBI to be a Russian foreign agent Republicans in Congress thinks they think that that's the real scandal that's the real problem that the FBI ever looked into that or pursued that and so they want the FBI itself investigated on those matters well Attorney General Jeff Sessions today announced that he has asked Utah u.s. attorney John Huber to lead that investigation of the FBI again John Huber one of just a handful of US attorneys who was not hosted by President Trump a year ago when he issued that blanket firing of all federal prosecutors now apparently this is not a new probe that is being led by John Huber u.s. attorney John Huber has according to Jeff sessions already been conducting this investigation of the FBI for some time but for some reason Attorney General Jeff Sessions just decided that he would make it public today and again John Huber is a respected prosecutor he has worked under Democratic and Republican administrations nobody's quite sure why I turned to General Jeff Sessions decided to make this public today nobody's quite sure what to make of it overall because this is weird when we're in new territory we've never really seen anything like this before and this announcement today comes just one day after the Justice Department's inspector general announced that he will review that application for that surveillance warrant on Trump foreign policy advisor Carter page and the Inspector General announced that he will also conduct a review of the FBI and Justice Department relationship with Christopher Steele the former mi6 agent who wrote the so-called Trump Russia dossier which has become a point of obsession in the republican-controlled Congress so why is this happening now and why are we learning about this now yeah in the course of two days we have learned about both of these inquiries and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has gone out of his way to say publicly that he's the one who requested both of these enquiries both the inspector general review and this other review led by this Utah prosecutor they're both now public sessions says he's the one who set them both in motion and we now know that they're both happening at the same time and I think there's a there's a couple of important things to know about that from today's news one of them is about Jeff Sessions one of them is actually about Christopher Steele but let's let's do the Jeff Sessions one first this morning this letter was made public from public and Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein say letter to the Trump campaign and look it's bipartisan I mean that's a Republican and Democratic senator signing the same thing peanut butter and chocolate reunited cats and dogs right in the same goat I mean we never see anything bipartisan anymore this is like a circus trick at this point but here it is today they together sent this letter to the Trump campaign reaping a bipartisan demand that the Trump campaign hand over to the Senate Judiciary Committee documents and communications from the campaign related to Russia and there are a few elements of wonder here one is that this is a bipartisan request - they're alive a congressional inquiry into the Russia scandal what the request is also quite literally wonderful it is a cause of wonder because of its one footnote it has one footnote in the letter and it acknowledges a spelling difficulty which has caused a lot of people a lot of heartache for for the last five months since a man named George papadopolis was charged in a special counsels investigation look at the very bottom of this letter from Grassley and Feinstein today this again the whole point of this letter is their reopen a document request to the Trump campaign about Russia hand us documents that contain these key notes related to the Russia investigation footnote while your search terms previously included the word Papadopoulos we now ask you to include puppet asterisk pa pa D and then anything after that in additional searches quote in an effort to account for possible misspellings I think about it right if you if you only ask for emails from the Trump campaign that correctly spelled the word Papadopoulos you might imagine you wouldn't get very many documents handed over so number one they want the search done again including common misspellings of george papadapolis is last name more substantively though they are also asking specifically for communications from two people Rick Dearborn who went on to be deputy White House chief of staff in fact he just left as White House deputy chief of staff and a man named John Mashburn Rick Dearborn and John Mashburn I know they both sound like fake names you would invent for a burner hotmail account but these are real guys John Mashburn was the policy director for the Trump campaign at least for a time his name is obviously unfamiliar but I think that's in part because he has rarely if ever surfaced as a relevant name in the high profile scandals that are variously afflicting the Trump campaign and the Trump administration the one place mr. Mashburn does turn up is as a point of contact for the campaign on a murky incident that took place at the Republican National Convention in 2016 we're still to this day nobody really admits who exactly insisted that the Republican Party's national platform needed to be changed to go softer on Russia that mystery is where both John Mashburn and Rick Dearborn make an appearance in the in the narrative of this scandal because they were policy advisors from the campaign who were reportedly consulted on the changes to that platform while it was being negotiated so why today are Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein for the first time inquiring about those two guys I don't know but a couple of hours after they released that letter bingo a scoop from investigative reporter Mark hosen ball at Reuters and you can see the headline there quote Moeller probing molar probing Russia contacts at Republican convention quote investigators probing whether Donald Trump's presidential campaign colluded with Russia have been questioning witnesses about the events of their 2016 Republican National Convention one issue molars team has been asking witnesses about is how and why Republican party platform language hostile to Russia was deleted from a section of the party platform so maybe Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein dynamic bipartisan duo believe that Dearborn and Mashburn can shed some light on that for the Senate investigation as well that's the place where they both turn up in the Russia scandal as best as we can tell but here's the thing mark hosen ball today also goes on to report that molars investigators have been asking witnesses about several matters that specifically relate to Jeff Sessions quote molar steam has been asking a convention relating about a convention related event attended by both Russia's US ambassador and Jeff Sessions quote investigators have asked detailed questions about conversations that sessions then a campaign adviser had at a campaign event attended by Russia's ambassador to the United States Moeller's team has also been asking whether Jeff sessions had private discussions with the same ambassador on the sidelines of a campaign speech which Trump gave at Washington's Mayflower Hotel in April 2016 okay so if Marcos involves reporting today this new reporting from Reuters is correct this means a couple of things first and most importantly it means that in current inquiries by the special counsels office when they what they're asking witnesses about now is about the central matter under investigation it's not just obstruction of justice they're asking about the question of contacts with and potentially collusion with Russia that's what they're asking witnesses about and that is supported by the court filings we got earlier this week from molars prosecutors where they described having evidence that Trump's campaign chair and deputy campaign chair repeatedly had contact with someone with known active ties to Russian intelligence during their work on the campaign so part of what is important about Marcos involves me reporting is that collusion is clearly still in the mix in terms of what Muller is looking at anybody who was hoping that collusion was a dead-letter within the Moller investigation will likely be alarmed by these reports about what Muller is asking witnesses about inhale other thing that's important about Marcos involves reporting is hey that's the Attorney General you're talking about there be currently serving Attorney General of the United States is the subject of active inquiries in the Moller investigation on multiple fronts while he's still serving his Attorney General which we now know involves him setting up multiple new inquiries into the behavior of the FBI and whether or not the FBI should have been investigating the Russia matter at all and whether they've been too biased in favor of Hillary Clinton he's the subject of inquiries by the molar investigation meanwhile he's siccing these other two investigators on the Russia investigation this is a rat's nest and void is that purported recusal of his seem to be sagging under its own weight these days so serious new questions about the attorney-general but I mentioned there were important new developments that relate to this in the news today about Attorney General Jeff Sessions and also about Christopher Steele well the one about Christopher Steele comes in the form of a sort of alarming brand new scoop tonight from NBC's Richard Engel and that's next hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
