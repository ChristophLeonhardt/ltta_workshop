Trump snap back at them and now he has

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">done it with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the press with the news</font>

162
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,620
media obviously yesterday CNN published

163
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,539
this story saying there was an addendum

164
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,020
when the intelligence agencies were

165
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,729
briefing Obama and Trump there was an

166
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,770
addendum saying that the Russians might

167
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,930
have some stuff on Trump including stuff

168
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,190
about what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was doing with Russian</font>

169
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,560
prostitutes all of it unconfirmed all of

170
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,259
it the press already had it and weren't

171
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:51,520
running it because they couldn't get any

172
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,370
confirmation on it and finally and then

173
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,529
BuzzFeed put the documents the two

174
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:00,460
documents out there so yesterday Trump

175
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,289
went off at his press columnist Trump

176
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,669
went off on these guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Jim Acosta</font>

177
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,610
from CNN tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get dance ask them a</font>

178
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,919
question and here is the exchange that

179
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:11,250
now has the news media going up in smoke

180
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,560
information that was false and fake and

181
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,900
never happened got released to the

182
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,110
public as far as BuzzFeed which is a

183
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,009
failing pile of garbage writing it I

184
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they're going to suffer the</font>

185
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,060
consequences they already are and as far

186
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,000
as CNN going out of their way to build

187
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,550
it up and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just felt that I</font>

188
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,469

189
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,699

00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,509
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just reported that it wasn't this</font>

192
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:42,399

217
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,190
of them right and of course now the

218
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,080
press is fluttering around because

219
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,990
because even as I said yesterday even

220
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,130
the New York Times which is only a

221
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,200
former newspaper wouldn't run with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

222
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,300
story because they knew it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was nothing</font>

223
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,680
you know it was they didn't have any

224
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,230
confirmation now there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can be</font>

225
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,760
suspicious about trump he's been awfully

226
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,200
nice to Putin he says awfully nice

227
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,630
things to Putin it's perfectly fine to

228
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,790
say he's being too soft on Russia it's

229
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,680
perfectly fine to say he's being sucked

230
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,360
in by Putin or whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

231
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">but until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got the goods you don't go</font>

232
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,590
after the president-elect by sending

233
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,760
this stuff out now of course there was a

234
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,500
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between what CNN did which</font>

235
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,570
was report a true story that this was in

236
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefing and what BuzzFeed did which</font>

237
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,760
was put<font color="#E5E5E5"> out this garbage so now the</font>

238
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,860
press itself has started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

239
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,420
each other because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean Spicer but</font>

240
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,390
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that exchange Sean Spicer got up</font>

241
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,680
and linked the two of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> together just</font>

242
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,210
condemned them both as frankly

243
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,060
outrageous and highly irresponsible for

244
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,710
a left-wing blog there was openly

245
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,660
hostile to the president<font color="#CCCCCC"> elects campaign</font>

246
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,960
to drop highly salacious and flat-out

247
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,930
false information on the internet just

248
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">days before he takes the oath of office</font>

249
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,750
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> BuzzFeed own editor there</font>

250
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,700
are some serious reasons to doubt the

251
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,640
allegations in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the report the executive</font>

252
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">editor of the New York Times also</font>

253
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,630
dismissed the report by saying it was

254
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,529
quote totally

255
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,779
unsubstantiated echoing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concerns</font>

256
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,730
that many other reporters expressed on

257
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet the fact that BuzzFeed and</font>

258
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,560
CNN made the decision to run with this

259
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,410
unsubstantiated claim is a sad and

260
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">pathetic attempt to get clicks okay so</font>

261
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,740
now CNN<font color="#CCCCCC"> is invested in separating and</font>

262
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,120
stuff from BuzzFeed because what buzz we

263
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,610
did was not journalism you don't put up

264
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,949
this document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has a salacious</font>

265
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:24,259
attacks on somebody that you have no

266
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,629
backing for no confirmation of now just

267
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember this before we go into this</font>

268
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,160
deeper remember that during the

269
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,559
primaries each and<font color="#E5E5E5"> every Republican</font>

270
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,839
candidate destroyed himself in his

271
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,819
reaction to trump trump didn't destroy

272
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:40,459
them Trump never did anything on stage

273
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,309
maybe with Bush maybe Jeb Bush by just

274
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,930
making him look like a weakling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

275
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,790
making him look but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush</font>

276
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">who played into that who kept looking</font>

277
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,249
like what what Trump said he was Marco

278
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:55,160
Rubio destroyed himself by trying to

279
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">play Trump by fighting back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same way</font>

280
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,170
that Trump was fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with his</font>

281
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,879
bullying techniques or the insults

282
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his small hands and we all know</font>

283
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,660
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means in all this and Cruz an</font>

284
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,970
incredibly smart man<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the</font>

285
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,279
smartest guy on the stage he<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroyed</font>

286
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,509
himself by being too smart by

287
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,040
strategizing I'm going to I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

288
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,600
ride Trump for a wise going to be my

289
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,579
good friend Donald and then at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

290
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,050
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to break apart and all</font>

291
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,430
this stuff Snickers office they<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

292
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,620
destroyed themselves in the way they

293
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,149
reacted to something they hadn't seen

294
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">before and that is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is happening</font>

295
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">today to the news media here is first</font>

296
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,040
let's look at Anderson Cooper with

297
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,800
Kellyanne trying to separate himself

298
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,350
separate his network CNN from BuzzFeed

299
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,350
do you acknowledge here and now that CNN

300
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,879
did not release the 35-page

301
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,589
unsubstantiated claims against Donald

302
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,600
Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was misleading and untrue</font>

303
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,600
for Sean Spicer to suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise no</font>

304
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,220
our incoming press secretary Sean Spicer

305
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,990
was exactly right as was the

306
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,019
president-elect Anderson CNN went first

307
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">yesterday and BuzzFeed one second we</font>

308
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,439
didn't reveal any bugs be reported I

309
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,660
didn't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did but you linked</font>

310
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,610
from Spartanburg ritory let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

311
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,160
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Anderson let's back up I know</font>

312
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,199
CNN must be feeling the heat today of

313
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:08,600
having a headline yesterday at around

314
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,089
630pm that said quote Intel

315
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chiefs presented Trump with information</font>

316
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,089
that rough could compromise Russia had

317
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,569
information to compromise him that is

318
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,240

345
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,350
line into disrespect but there was a

346
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,499
show on the PBS channel in Boston called

347
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:29,240
beat depressed listen to this discussion

348
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,819
after major Garrett asked that question

349
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,559
question was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just performance art it was</font>

350
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">about major Garrett it wasn't about</font>

President Obama it wasn't about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

352
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,360
issue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just to say that why are</font>

353
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,449
you you know your content to attend with

354
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,699
them it all and these questions are

355

357
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,929
inappropriate it was exactly the case

358
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it ties back to the last</font>

359
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,079
subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were discussing there is</font>

360
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,209
particularly in the Obama administration

361
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,550
a very an undercurrent in the American

362
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,589
political discussion that believes that

363
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:06,829
that Obama is out to sell the country is

364
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,569
a secret muslim whatever it may be and

365
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:10,279
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion of this around deal has</font>

366
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,980
has had that tinge to it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in</font>

371
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,450
prisons that I think added an extra edge

372
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,780
of awfulness to the question so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

373
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,880
