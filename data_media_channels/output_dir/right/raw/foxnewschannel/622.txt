APPROPRIATION BILLS AND WE DON'T

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,654
OF THE DAY AND PASS

79
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:08,455
APPROPRIATION BILLS AND PLAN TO

00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:10,123
DO THAT AND ALL THE

81
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,825
INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS THAT WE ARE

82
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,160
WORKING, THE PRESIDENT'S

83
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:13,860
INFRASTRUCTURE AGENDA THAT WE

84
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,961
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND WE

85
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:18,965
ARE EXCITED ABOUT GETTING THE

86
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,500
INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS AS WELL.

87
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,468
STEVE: THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR

88
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:22,869
THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO FUND

89
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,671
ANOTHER ONE LIKE THAT.

90
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,405
>> THAT'S WHY WE ARE TRYING TO

91
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,274
BREAK IT UP IN OLD PIECES.

92
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,176
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

93
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:31,945
THE HOUSE HAS ALWAYS DONE THIS.

94
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,814
YOU HAVE A NEW CHAIRMAN OVER

95
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:35,482
THERE, SHELBY, THEY ARE ACTUALLY

96
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:36,583
PASSING APPROPRIATION BILLS,

97
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:37,417
THIS YEAR HOPEFULLY WILL BE

98
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,251
DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

99
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,686
SENATE ACTUALLY DOING

100
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,121
APPROPRIATIONS THIS YEAR.

101
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,422
BRIAN: YOU WILL VISIT WITH THE

102
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:47,127
IS THAT CORRECT?

103
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:47,994
>> WELL, LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO

104
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,696
TALK TO HIM ABOUT A WHOLE SWLUI

105
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,532
OF ISSUES AND HOW TO GET THE

106
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,266
APPROPRIATION PROCESS BACK ON

107
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,434
TRACK SO AT THE END OF THE YEAR

108
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,938
WE DON'T HAVE ONE GIANT OMNIBUS

109
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,172
APPROPRIATION BILL.

110
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,507
NOBODY WANTS THAT, THE SENATE IS

111
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,775
ENGAGED SO WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER

112
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,543
PLAN WITH THE SENATE TO GET

113
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,544
APPROPRIATIONS DONE SEPARATELY

114
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,115
BUDGET, ON SCHEDULE THIS YEAR

115
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:13,220
AND THAT'S THE PRIMARY CONCERN.

116
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:14,287
BRIAN: 5 BILLION ACCURATE?

117
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:16,857
THAT.

118
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:17,691
THEY'VE CHANGED ORIGINAL

119
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,163
GOTTEN SO FAR?

120
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,298
THE PRESIDENT WANTED 25 BILLION?

121
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,536
ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST, THE

122
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:30,971
ADMINISTRATION IN THIS CURRENT

123
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:32,739
FISCAL YEAR ASKED FOR

124
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,807
1.6 BILLION, THAT HAS BEEN

125
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:34,674
FUNDED AND THOSE DOLLARS ARE

126
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:35,642
BEING SPENT.

127
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:36,843
THAT CONSTRUCTION IS NOW

128
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,445
OCCURRING.

129
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,146
SO THERE IS -- THERE'S BEING

130
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,983
MONEY SPENT ON THE WALL ON THE

131
00:04:42,984 --> 00:00:00,000
BORDER.
