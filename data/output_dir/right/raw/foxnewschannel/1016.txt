00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:40,080
EVER BEEN OUTSIDE OF PYONGYANG

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,715
AS THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA.

AND HOTELS AND SOMETHING SPREAD

86
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:54,861
ACROSS THE TOP OF IT THAT LOOKS

87
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:57,064
LIKE A CARGO SHIP THAT LANDED UP

88
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:58,632
