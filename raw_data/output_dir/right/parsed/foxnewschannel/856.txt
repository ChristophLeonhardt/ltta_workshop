TWO.
IT WAS THE MOVIE IT MADE FOR
HIM, A FILM TO CAPTURE HIM.
A FACE MELTING SALES TOOL FOR
FREEDOM WHICH MR. TRUMP PLAYED
WITH THE NEW ULTRA NORTH KOREAN
LEADER.
>> DESTINY PICTURES THAT'S A
STORY OF OPPORTUNITY, A NEW
STORY, A NEW BEGINNING.
TWO MEN, TWO LEADERS, ONE
DESTINY.
A STORY ABOUT A SPECIAL MOMENT
IN TIME WHEN A MAN IS PRESENTED
WITH ONE CHANCE THAT MAY NEVER
BE REFUTED.
WILL HE CHOOSE?
TO SHOW VISION AND LEADERSHIP OR
NOT.
A NEW WORLD TO BEGIN TODAY.
ONE OF FRIENDSHIP, RESPECT AND
GOODWILL.
BE A PART OF THAT WORLD WHERE
THE DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY ARE
READY TO BE OPENED.
GREG: WHERE DO I SIGN UP?
HERE IS THE QUESTION -- WHY?
WHO WOULD DO THIS IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S NOT.
THE FILM SHOWS THE TYRANT WHAT
COULD BE IF HE STOPPED BEING A
.
>> IT WAS A CHILD'S PRESENTATION
TO ANOTHER CHILD TO CONVINCE HIM
TO COME TO THE PARTY.
>> THERE WERE REPORTERS IN THE
ROOM WHO THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
SOMETHING WITH THE NORTH KOREAN
HAVE PUT TOGETHER.
>> IT WAS STRANGE AND I THINK
THE POWER OF PROPAGANDA VIDEO
LIKE THAT IS EXTREMELY OVERRATED
LIKE THAT IS EXTREMELY OVERRATE
OVERRATED.
GREG: WHAT IDIOTS.
LOOK, IF YOU LIVE IN AMERICA
WITH AN IPHONE, IPAD, THAT VIDEO
WASN'T FOR YOU.
IT WAS FOR THE NORTH KOREANS.
DO YOU JACKASSES LOOK AT A AFTER
BABY FOOD AND SAY THAT
COMMERCIAL IS SO STUPID I'M NOT
A BABY?
WHAT IS THIS BUS STOP DOING FOR
MY HOUSE?
I DON'T NEED A BUS, I LIVE HERE.
LET ME SAY THIS SLOWLY.
THE VIDEO IS NOT FOR YOU.
IT'S AN INTERVENTION MADE TO
PERSUADE TO SHOW OTHER OPTIONS
BESIDES ANNIHILATION.
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU SHOWED IT TO
ME, DONALD?
THAT IS THE FUTURE.
>> I SHOWED IT TO YOU BECAUSE
THAT IS A FUTURE.
THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE
FUTURE AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE
IS NOT A GOOD ALTERNATIVE.
GREG: YEAH, IT'S NOT VERY GOOD.
IT IS THIS OR DIE.
THAT'S NOT THE
THAT'S NOT AHE
THAT'S NOT APPEASEMENT BUT
SALESMANSHIP.
THAT IS TRUMPS TOOL AND HE GETS
YOU INTO THE CAR.
ONCE THE DEALER GETS YOU TO
TESTDRIVE THE COURT THAT YOU
HAVE TWO OPTIONS.
NOT IN THE CORVETTE, IN THE
CORVETTE.
A LIFE OF SHINY FUN VERSUS A
PREVIOUS THAT STINKS UP TACO
BELL WRAPPERS.
THAT VIDEO LET KIM TESTDRIVE
PROSPERITY.
IT MAY FAIL BUT CRITICS, WHAT
YOU HAVE BESIDE MOCKERY?
YOU ARE MAD BECAUSE TRUMP DID IT
FIRST.
HE BEGAN WITH THE THREAT OF
NUKES, ADDED SANCTIONS AND THEN
THE PERSUASION.
HE SWUNG THE STICK AND THEN GAVE
THE CARROT.
IT IS SO ODD.
WASN'T THE LEFT A PIECE OF PARTY
IN THE RIGHT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE WAR PIGS.
OBAMA WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING
WORLD PEACE, NOT TRUMP.
MY GOD, NOW WE HAVE AN ORANGE
GANDHI.
NO WONDER THE LEFT IS A MESS.
TRUMP STOLE THE LIBERAL PLAYBOOK
AND BEAT HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH
IT.
YOU WOULD THINK THE LEFT WOULD
EMBRACES BUT NOT TRUMP IS BEHIND
IT.
THEN THEY TELL ALL OF US TO BE
SKEPTICAL.
THE LEFT IS THE LEAST SKEPTICAL
BUNCH ON EARTH.
THESE ARE THE SAME PIECE BLINDLY
EMBRACE BOGUS CLIMATE
STATISTICS, GUN-CONTROL LIES,
NEW AGE MEDICINE, DIETS AND ANY
POSTMODERN DRIP ABOUT RACE OR
GENDER AND THE SAME PEOPLE WHO
DEMAND SKEPTICISM WOULD APPLAUD
A SIX-YEAR-OLD MAN TO SELF
IDENTIFY AS A HAIRLESS CAT.
THAT WAS A SHOUT OUT TO BRIAN
STELTER.
A CHEAP SHOT.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO STILL SAY
THE SUMMIT GAVE KIM A PHOTO OP,
THIS IS NORTH KOREA.
CREATE ONE.
YOU THINK HE DOESN'T HAVE
PHOTOSHOP BACK IN HIS CASTLE?
IF THE SUMMIT IS A CONFESSION
THEN YOUR SOLUTION ULTIMATELY IS
WAR BECAUSE THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE
WITHOUT DIALOGUE.
I AM BEGINNING TO SOUND LIKE A
LIBERAL.
HERE IS TRUMP ON HIS MESSAGE.
>> HE SPOKEN SO PASSIONATELY
ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED
TO THE DEATH OF AUTO WARM FIRE.
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE A NUCLEAR
WEAPON DESTROY YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY.
>> BY THE WAY --
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE A NUCLEAR
WEAPON DESTROY YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY.
I WANT TO HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA.
I WANT TO HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH MANY OTHER
COUNTRIES AND WHAT I HAVE DONE,
IF YOU REMEMBER AND IF YOU ARE
FAIR, WHICH MOST OF YOU ARE,
WHEN I CAME IN PEOPLE THOUGHT WE
WERE PROBABLY GOING TO WAR WITH
NORTH KOREA AND IF WE DID --
QUIET.
GREG: I LOVE IT WHEN YOU SHUSH
IS THEM.
THE HAND GESTURE -- THEIR KIDS
AT THE ICE CREAM TRUCK AND HE'S
THE GOOD HUMOR MAN.
SHUT UP AND I WILL GET YOU NEXT.
THEY DON'T LISTEN TO HIS
ANSWERS.
HE'S MY SECOND FAVORITE PART.
>> GO AHEAD.
>> WHAT DID YOU MEAN JUST NOW
WHEN YOU SAID ?
>> I'M KIDDING, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND SARCASM.
WHO ARE YOU WITH?
>> CNN.
>> YOU ARE THE WORST.
GREG: IT NEVER GETS OLD.
HE IS PREVENTING WAR AND THEY
ARE CHASING JOE.
THE MEDIA COULD BE WRONG BUT AND
MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.
>> NORTH KOREA, WHAT IS THE
THIRD COUNTRY WITH WHICH NORTH
KOREA HAS A BORDER?
NORTH KOREA HAS A TINY LITTLE
BORDER WITH A THIRD COUNTRY.
IF YOU TAKE THAT BRIDGE AND THEY
LET YOU CROSS THE BORDER WHERE
YOU END UP IS RUSSIA.
GREG: RUSSIA.
THAT IS THE TICKET.
THAT IS ALWAYS THE TICKET.
NOT AVERTING NUCLEAR WAR.
CRAZY.
ANYWAY, I'M OPTIMISTIC AND
HERE'S WHY.
COMPARE OUR TEAM, POMPEO,
BOLTON, TRUMP TO THE PREVIOUS
SQUAD.
HILLARY, BEN RHODES, CARRIE.
OUR TEAM IS THE THREE MUSKETEERS
AND THEIRS IS THE THREE STOOGES.
DEMOCRATS COULD DO BETTER WITH
THE QUARTERS OF THE VIEW.
THERE COMBINATION OF WEAK
HANDSHAKES AND BAD THINGS.
THE STINK OF SCENTED CANDLES IN
FAILURE.
BEN RHODES IS LIKE SOMEONE GLUED
100 BEANIE BABIES TOGETHER.
HILLARY CANNOT BLOW HER NOSE
WITHOUT A CONSULTANT.
JOHN KERRY IS SO WOODEN THAT
TERMITES CONSIDER HIM AN
ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BUFFET.
I AM RELIEVED.
PEACE IS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN
MORE.
YET SOME OF THE LEFT WOULD FEEL
WORSE IF THERE WAS A DRUG.
>> FIRST, TONIGHT HEADLINE,
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THERE IS NO
LONGER A NUCLEAR THREAT FROM
NORTH KOREA.
>> I MISS THE FEAR.
>> WHAT NOW?
>> THE FEAR OF IMMINENT NUCLEAR
WAR.
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN EVERYONE
WAS TELLING US OUR LIVES WERE IN
DANGER?
IT GAVE ME A RUSH.
>> THAT IS PRETTY  UPPED,
DUDE.
>> ARE YOU BUMMED THAT YOU CAN'T
BE AFRAID ANYMORE?
>> I THINK I WAS FEEDING OF THE
PARANOIA.
>> YOU NEED CATASTROPHIC.
>> WILL MAKE AMERICA AFRAID
AGAIN?
>> NO, JUST YOU, SOURPUSS.
IT'S A STIMULANT THAT
REACTIVATES YOUR BRAIN FEAR
RECEPTORS GIVING YOU THAT
HYSTERIA YOU CRAVE.
USE IT ON THE GO.
>> I DON'T FEEL IT WORKING YET.
>> HELLO, TOM.
>> WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
>> NO, YOU ARE SNEAKING UP ON
ME.
>> IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU OUTSIDE
AGAIN.
WHAT?
WE ARE OUTSIDE?
THAT IS WHERE NUCLEAR WAR
HAPPENS.
>> CATASTROPHIC MINOR BE FOR
EVERYONE BUT BE SURE TO CONSULT
YOUR DOCTOR.
>> HAVE YOU SEEN TOM?
>> HE IS TAKING SHELTER AGAIN.
>> TOM?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE?
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO BE OKAY.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE OKAY.
>> THE BRILL IS BACK WITH
CATASTROPHIC.
GREG: LET'S WELCOME TONIGHT'S
GUESTS.
HE IS SO SHARP HE COULD USE HIS
POT TO CARVE A PUMPKIN.
WALTER KERN.
SHE IS SO BRIGHT GLOW WORMS FIND
HER INTIMIDATING.
HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED # DO NOT
DISTURB, ORDER IT NOW.
JEDEDIAH.
SHE IS  NATIONAL
REVIEW REPORTER, CAPTAINS.

KATEERING AND

>> MY MASSIVE SIDEKICK, TYRUS.
WALTER, THIS VIDEO HAS NEVER
BEEN DONE BEFORE AND NO ONE HAS
DONE A FAILED VIDEO OR A
MARKETING TOOL FOR FREEDOM AND
IT IS HILARIOUS TO ME.
IT'S WONDERFUL AT THE SAME
TIME --
>> IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS PRODUCED
BY SCIENTOLOGISTS.
WHAT IT REALLY WAS AN
ADVERTISEMENT FOR WHAT IT WOULD
BE LIKE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY.
I NOTICED THERE WERE A LOT OF
SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES THAT CUT IN
WEIRD IMAGES.
I THINK IT WAS ULTIMATELY A MIND
CONTROL TOOL THAT WE PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE THE KEY TO.
GREG: AFTER WATCHING IT I WANTED
TO GO TO NORTH KOREA.
>> EXACTLY.
GREG: I WANTED TO RIDE A HORSE
ACROSS THE OCEAN.
DID YOU SEE THAT HORSE GOING
ACROSS THE OCEAN?
IT MAY NO SENSE.
JEDEDIAH, I THINK THIS APPROACH
IS INNOVATIVE BUT TYPICAL.
>> IT'S TRUE BECAUSE HE PUT ALL
THE STUFF IN THERE THAT KIM
JONG-UN LIKES LIKE BASKETBALL
AND HE BASICALLY CHARACTER
STUDIED HIM AND HE'S A GUY WHO
LOVED AMERICAN POP CULTURE AND
FIGURED OUT ALL THE THINGS THAT
HE LIKED AND SAID LET ME PUT
THIS IN HERE TO CONVINCE HIM TO
BE A BETTER MAN.
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THE
FEAR THAT IN ANY WAY IT WAS
ELEVATING HIM.
THIS IS A GUY WHO IS A MASS
MURDERER.
HE HAS PRISON CAMPS IN NORTH
KOREA AND GROSS VIOLATIONS OF
HUMAN RIGHTS SO YOU DON'T WANT
HIM ELEVATED OR TO BE ON PAR
WITH AMERICAN PRESIDENT BUT WITH
THAT BEING SAID I THINK THAT IT
WAS VERY, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
TRUMP COULD GET HIMSELF IN
ADVERTISING
TRUMP COULD GET HIMSELF IN
ADVERTISING IF PRESIDENT DOESN'T
WORK OUT.
GREG: WHICH ROB IS DOING IS
LOOKING AT THE SKY AS A HOSTAGE
TAKER IN ORDER TO GET THE
HOSTAGE TAKER TO RELEASE THE
HOSTAGES YOU USE EVERYTHING YOU
HAVE PERSUASIVELY TO GET HIM TO
PUT DOWN THE GUN AND I THINK
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A LONG
PROCESS OF GETTING THIS GUY TO
PUT DOWN THE GUN.
WHAT YOU THINK, CAT?
KAT: I WATCH THIS VIDEO WITHOUT
EVEN LOOKING AT MY PHONE ONE
TIME.
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE 2008
I THINK IT WAS AN INTERESTING
VIDEO WITH A BIZARRE VIDEO.
I DON'T LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE
ROOTING AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP
BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WORKING
THINGS OUT WITH NORTH KOREA
BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
WRONG.
THINGS ARE WORKING OUT WITH
NORTH KOREA MEANS WAR A LOT OF
DEAD PEOPLE.
I DON'T LIKE TO BE WRONG BUT IF
MAYBE RIGHT MEANS A LOT OF
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE I
ACTUALLY WOULD AIR ON THE SIDE
OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO LIVE.
GREG: NICE OF YOU.
KAT: APPARENTLY THAT IS A RARE
THING.
GREG: ESPECIALLY IN THE MEDIA I
THINK.
TYRUS, DEPICTIONS ON THIS?
TYRUS: I LIKE THE BEST.
AND THAT WAS GREAT.
I WOULD PAY MONEY TO SEE -- NO,
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I'M GLAD
BROTHERS WERE GETTING MORE WORK.
WE ARE EVERYWHERE.
I'M ON FOX NEWS, WERE IN NORTH
KOREA.
IT'S GREAT.
I LOOKED AT IT A DIFFERENT WAY.
IF YOU SHOW THAT VIDEO TO HIS
COUNTRY AND THEN KIM DOES NOT
COME THROUGH.
HE WILL HAVE A PROBLEM.
GREG: THAT'S TRUE.
TYRUS: THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD
JOB OF KEEPING THEM SHELTERED
AND SEALED IN THE ORIGINAL
VERSION OF THE VIDEO THEY SHOWED
AMERICA WE WERE EATING THEIR
CHILDREN.
GREG: THAT'S TRUE.
TYRUS:
.YRUS:
.TYUS:
.TYRU:
.TYRUS: NOW THEY ARE LIKE THEY
RIDE THEIR HORSES IN AMERICA?
>> EXACTLY.
TYRUS: THE ONLY THING THAT WAS
MISSING WAS A VEGAS SHOT OR A
COUPLE MCDONALD'S BUT HE IS
SHOWING THEM THE LIGHT.
>> WHAT IS FUNNY IS DEMOCRATS
GET APPLAUDED FOR THE STUFF ALL
THE TIME.
WHEN THEY DO STUFF THAT THE
MEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS
RUNNING AND
IT WAS A SCENE FROM A MOVIE AND
IT WAS BUILT UP THEY GET
APPLAUDED FOR ALIGNING
THEMSELVES WITH WHAT HOLLYWOOD
BUT WHEN TRUMP DOES SOMETHING
THAT'S OUTSIDE THE BOX TO
CONVINCE A TYRANT TO MAYBE FIND
A BETTER WAY HE GETS DEMONIZED
FOR IT.
YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE FOR EITHER
IT'S A GOOD IDEA OR YOU HAVE TO
BE PICKING ON BOTH INDIVIDUALS
WERE DOING IT.
THE SELECTIVE OUTRAGE IS
HUMOROUS TO ME.
GREG: WALTER, DO YOU THINK THAT
HE'S BEING TOO DEFERENTIAL OR IS
THIS AN OBVIOUS THAT WE ALL KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING?
>> HE'S GOT SUCH A BIG EGO
EVERYONE PRINTS IT.
HE GAVE THE SPOTLIGHT TO KIM.
GREG: TRUE.
WITH THAT SAID, SCOTT SAYS HE
USED HIS EGO AS A THERMOSTAT
THAT HE TURNS UP AND DOWN.
