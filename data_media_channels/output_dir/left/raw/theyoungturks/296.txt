the consequences will extend long past

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,520
surprising<font color="#E5E5E5"> but people like Judge</font>

no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> which way that it it went</font>

36
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,390
including saying that she<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. Blasi for</font>

37
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">100% credible then completed this</font>

38
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,790
thought by saying the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that the</font>

39
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,920
Republicans rescue this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if Cavanaugh</font>

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,430
puts aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> his veneer of I'm a judge</font>

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,079
who's above it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I will repeat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lis</font>

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,320
legal talking points and comes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

43
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,799

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,170
so now part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it I thought was very</font>

45
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,250
effective we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little</font>

46
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,239

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,800
parts you just saw might have been the

least effective parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when he</font>

a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just saw in the morning dr.</font>

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">Blasio Ford showed that there's no</font>

assistance and anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prosecutor</font>

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,380
asked and asked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and came up</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that judicial crisis network a</font>

right-wing group is spending five

million dollars supporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cavanaugh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">running ads all across the country some</font>

61

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which they had to pull back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

62
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of his supporters said look I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he didn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

64
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and retracted her statements on it so</font>

65
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,250
and then saying this<font color="#E5E5E5"> payback against</font>

66
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,070
Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean look you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can say it's</font>

67
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,470
deeply political from the Democrats<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

68
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,240
bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into it seems like now</font>

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,010
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing political strategy to try</font>

70
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,810
to get Trump riled up which worked and

71
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,030
to get him to be solidly on your side

72
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">but not his best case really quick one</font>

73
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,600
of the things that was emphasized

74
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,250
throughout this<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing was the fact</font>

75
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,890
that Blasi Ford came forward with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

76
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">allegations before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cavanaugh was</font>

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
selected as a Supreme Court nominee<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,180
he was on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list remember Trump has</font>

79
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> list of the conservative approved</font>

80
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Supreme Court potential Supreme Court</font>

81
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,220
nominees<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it wasn't until</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Blasi Ford</font>

82
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,830
saw that he was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list that she</font>

83
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,040
decided to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> action right so it's</font>

84
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,320
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for those who think that this</font>

85
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent politically</font>

86
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,209
motivated<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why didn't she bring</font>

87
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">up those allegations against all those</font>

88
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,500
other potential nominees if they're

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,300
false allegations and this is only done

90
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">for political knows living let me add to</font>

91
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,989
that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was very clear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

92
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,910
actually tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this in front</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

93
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,680
the Republicans as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting it</font>

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,450
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the papers so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they would</font>

95
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,300
pick a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different Republican so that and</font>

96
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,519
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> presumably that Republican would</font>

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,930
have an easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance of getting</font>

98
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,220
confirmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

99
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,989
politics she's just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't pick this</font>

100
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,029
guy because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what he did to me I know</font>

101
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,269
he's a bad guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that makes her super</font>

102
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,800
credible okay two words<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mitch McConnell</font>

103
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,479
what did he know

104
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,870
because he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> lobbying hard to convince</font>

105
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Trump to not choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kavanagh yeah why</font>

106
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">yep</font>

107
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,080
so now nonetheless look there's three

108
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he did right in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

109
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,930
testimony<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's keep watching and</font>

110
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,120
then I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and I don't even</font>

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily think it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> strategy I III</font>

112
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,740
thought it was at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some degree</font>

113
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,350
real so anyway let's go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

114
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,039
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> testimony</font>

115
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,820
why aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also asking the FBI to</font>

116
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,060
investigate these claims<font color="#CCCCCC"> senator I'll do</font>

117
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever the committee wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted a</font>

118
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,349
hearing the day after the allegation

119
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:04,009
came up I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here that day</font>

120
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">instead ten days passed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where all this</font>

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,210
nonsense<font color="#E5E5E5"> is coming out you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

122
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,550
in gangs I'm on boats<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Rhode Island</font>

123
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,970
I'm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colorado you know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cited all</font>

124
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the place and these things are</font>

125
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:22,500
printed and run breathlessly by cable

126
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,830
news<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hearing the</font>

127
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,430
next day my family's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been destroyed by</font>

128
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,650
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> senator so he said repeatedly</font>

129
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,300
throughout both his opening statement

130
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in the questioning as you see there</font>

131
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his family has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> destroyed by</font>

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in in a lot of ways his name I</font>

133
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know about his family but his name</font>

134
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,650
has been destroyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by it either justly</font>

135
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,090
so or unjustly so so now the three parts

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,900
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not of a sexual nature we were</font>

173
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,280
just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were all good</font>

175
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about hooking up but I</font>

176
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,330
was pleasantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that like that's where he got almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

179
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,870
most emotional like we he's like I

180
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,060
called my friends and said why did we do

181
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that we shouldn't you know</font>

182
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,060
basically we shouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done that</font>

183
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stories that</font>

184
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">bothered me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most that it and the</font>

185
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">fact that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

186
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">contrition on that I thought was was was</font>

187
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,180
a point on his side no in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind no</font>

188
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,620
question about it boy do you think yeah

189
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have significant disagreement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

190
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,520
think that he let first let's let me

191
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,870
mention what we do agree on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the emotion</font>

192
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,550
did seem genuine<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree with you on</font>

193
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do believe that everything he</font>

194
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,070
said with the exception of the clear

195
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,220
lies<font color="#CCCCCC"> was politically motivated well</font>

196
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,970
politically savvy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think that it's</font>

197
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,700
naive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think that his statements</font>

198
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,590
weren't specifically politically

199
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,770
motivated<font color="#E5E5E5"> now with that said I am so</font>

200
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,500
sick and<font color="#CCCCCC"> tired</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this goody two-shoes</font>

222
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,390
lies in there and he's under oath<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

223
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,760
that is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant to me than the</font>

tears and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> non-stop water drinking</font>

investigation but he's unwilling<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

229
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,260
that so let me be clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the Renata</font>

230
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,120
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree with you Anna</font>

that it's maddening that to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and</font>

232
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,770
clearly perjuring himself there he's

pretending that it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> about hooking</font>

234

<font color="#E5E5E5">up no 14 guys on the football team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font>

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,459
genuinely broken up that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had</font>

242
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,130
screwed up and and said that about<font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font>

243
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it is possible that their friends</font>

245
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,029
and he genuinely is remorseful<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

246
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,190
that it's also possible that that is

247

evidence that works against him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

of the
