following the shooting in parkland Florida which resulted in the death of 17 students the superintendent of Broward County Schools Robert rusi has decided to take measures to keep the students safe but these measures are not making the students very happy now students are being asked to wear clear backpacks there will also be airport style metal detectors and school visitors will be funneled through special gates students will also be issued ID badges which will be required which they will be required to wear at all times while in school staff members have badges as well and keep in mind that there is a new Florida law that will set aside millions of dollars 8.5 million to be exact for the school district to pay for at least one armed police officer at each school starting in the fall so going into school will be like going through the TSA when you're traveling you will have to go through similar metal detectors you will have to wear clear backpacks and essentially give away any and all privacy you have as a student because the country doesn't want to do anything about guns this is all distractions look I get it if you're a superintendent a principal anyone in charge in in that particular high school you got to be incredibly worried and you take as many precautions as you can and your hands have been tied because you can't do the one thing that makes sense which is do gun control so instead we'll they're like okay at least maybe we can see the gun in your backpack if you have a clear backpack and then we'll have a guard or a teacher train them to shoot you're dead if we see something in your backpack that looks dangerous I mean what's okay so what if somebody hides a gun in their pants or something like that okay so is the next measure to make all students wear skin tight leotards when they go to class I mean how much of our privacy do we have to give away because our country is full of politicians that are you know getting funded by weapons manufacturers and the NRA it's pathetic it's pathetic yes we have a second Amendment that protects the right to bear arms okay but we also have you know a right to unreasonable against unreasonable searches and seizures clear backpacks is not going to solve the problem they've turned this school into a prison and they all have numbers now they got to go through metal detectors and by the way when you set up a police state I guarantee you more of those kids are gonna start getting arrested for incredibly minor infractions because when there's cops what do they do they arrest people the real way to make people saved is to do gun control but our politicians are corrupt that's where we are if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
