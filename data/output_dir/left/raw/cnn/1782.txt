1
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:10,099
that significantly expands our
authorities to target individuals

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:18,240
companies financial institutions that
finance and facilitate trade with North

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:27,359
Korea as I outlined at my address to the
United Nations General Assembly North

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,399
Korea's nuclear weapons and missile
development is a grave threat to peace

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,879
and security in our world and it is
unacceptable that others financially

6
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:46,739
support this criminal rogue regime the
brutal North Korean regime does not

7
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:54,000
respect its own citizens or the
sovereignty of other nations a new

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,430
executive order will cut off sources of
revenue that fund North Korea's efforts

9
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:06,479
to develop the deadliest weapons known
to humankind the order enhances the

10
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,280
Treasury Department's authorities to
target any individual or entity that

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,159
conducts significant trade in goods
services or technology with North Korea

12
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,720
and I'm very proud to tell you that as
you may have just heard moments ago

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:32,220
China their central bank has told their
other banks that's a massive banking

14
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,880
system to immediately stop doing
business with North Korea this just

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,619
happened just reported in addition to
everything else what we will do is

16
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,350
identify new industries including
textiles fishing information technology

17
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,700
and manufacturing that the Treasury
Department can target with strong

18
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:05,399
sanctions and secretary minuchin is
representing the Treasury Department

19
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,610
he's here today to prevent sanctions
evasion the order also includes measures

20
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,459
designed to disrupt critic
North Korean shipping and trade networks

21
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,150
for much too long North Korea has been
allowed to abuse the international

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,430
financial system to facilitate funding
for its nuclear weapons and missile

23
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,530
programs the United States has had
representatives working on this problem

24
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,150
for over 25 years they have done nothing
that's why we're in the problem that

25
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,650
we're in today in addition to frankly
other countries not doing what they

26
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:48,870
should have done tolerance for this
disgraceful practice must end now a new

27
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,310
order will give the Treasury Department
the discretion to sanction any foreign

28
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,260
bank that knowingly conducts or
facilitates significant transactions

29
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:07,950
tied to trade with North Korea and again
I want to just say and thank President

30
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,000
Xi of China for the very bold move he
made today that was a somewhat

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,430
unexpected move and we appreciate it new
authority in this area applies to any

32
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,530
activity that occurs following my
signature on the executive order which I

33
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,329
have actually just signed foreign banks
will face a clear choice to business

34
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:37,049
with the United States or facilitate
trade with the lawless regime in North

35
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,510
Korea and they won't have so much trade
this new order provides us with powerful

36
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,720
new tools but I want to be clear the
order targets only one country and that

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,780
country is North Korea the regime can no
longer count on others to facilitate its

38
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,909
trade and banking activities many
countries are working with us to

39
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:04,560
increase economic and diplomatic
pressure on North Korea but I continue

40
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,109
to call on all those responsible nations
to enforce and implement UN sanctions

41
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:18,089
and impose their own measures like the
ones I'm announcing today I must tell

42
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:24,719
you that this is a a complete
denuclearization of North Korea that we

43
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:31,020
seek
cannot have this as a world body any

44
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,150
longer in just a few minutes Prime
Minister Abbey president moon and I are

45
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,620
going to discuss what more we can do
working together we've had a very very

46
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,830
close relationship I think our nations
have become closer because of this I

47
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,819
know it's going to be a great meeting
our alliance with South Korea and Japan

48
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:56,159
has never been stronger than it is today
we share a commitment to creating a

49
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:01,650
world where strong and independent
nations honor their people respect their

50
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:09,180
sovereignty respect the sovereignty also
of other nations and promote peace thank

51
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,550
you very much and I'd like to ask to
start off president moon to say a few

52
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,330
words please

53
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:30,779
the Chihuahua car no I recently we have
seen the provocation coming from the

54
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:37,199
Japanese our people must have gone
through a huge a big shock and I really

55
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,289
need to understand that the big concerns
a huge concerns of Japanese that people

56
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:46,249
may have because of this provocations so
I'd like to express the that I really

57
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:51,960
feel for the compassion for the Japanese
people in this regard the three leaders

58
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,199
have met at the g20 summit meeting in
July in Germany and we issued a joint

59
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,110
statement and through this joint
statement we also set a firm foundation

60
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,029
for close coordination among the three
countries based on which we are

61
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:12,180
cooperating closely with the
international community which imposes

62
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,969
sanctions and the pressure on the North
Korea and through the UN General

63
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:24,240
Assembly that the three leaders have
come together we had made speeches at

64
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,919
the General Assembly and the researcher
we met with leaders of the major

65
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,120
countries at the palate wrote and we
were able to enhance understanding about

66
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,069
the dis the sanctions and we was able to
urge to the international community

67
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:44,249
about this situation I think this is a
outcome that means welcome that the

68
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:48,149
three countries have made president
Truong just talked about the executive

69
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:55,919
order through which the u.s. is going to
be implementing sanctions on against the

70
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,620
DPRK and also there is a major
announcement made by the China to take

71
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,819
actions on DPRK I am very confident that
the such moves will contribute to

72
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,229
completed denuclearization of the DPRK
in desolate extend my appreciation to

73
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:19,199
the president Trump and I like to say
that Korea would closely coordinated

74
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,419
with the United States on this matter
through today's meeting I sincerely hope

75
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:30,930
that there will be a display of strong
solid leadership in coordinating our

76
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,189
responses for the North Korean issue and
I also look forward to engaging and in

77
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:42,999
that discussion sir for the solution
to North Korea nuclear and missile Prime

78
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:57,429
Minister Robi in the last three weeks
two times North Korea launched ballistic

79
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:05,049
missiles are two times going over Japan
and they conducted six nuclear tests and

80
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:10,809
the scale of the test was beyond the
scale of a Hiroshima bombs more than ten

81
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:16,809
times the scale of the ten nuclear test
it was ten times more this is

82
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:21,189
intolerable
outrageous actor thanks to Donald a

83
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:26,860

87
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:54,579
including very strict sanctions and I'd
like to thank the efforts of the u.s. UN

88
00:08:54,579 --> 00:09:00,519
ambassadors from the United States and
the father efforts are needed and in

89
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,290
this context Donald just referred to
signing of the executive order new

90
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:11,379
executive order so we are going into the
new stage of a pressure from the

91
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:17,110
viewpoint of exercising stronger
pressure new pressures the I welcome the

in mind those measures between the three

nuclear program by in North Korea and

96
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,250

98
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,250
transactions and trade deals with
Japan and with South Korea and that'll

99
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,710

that obviously will take precedent so
