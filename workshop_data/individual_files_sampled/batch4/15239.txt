it's frustrating to watch the violent alt left destroy the rule of law in Canada it bothers me that it's an attack on the oil and gas industry most of the time which is such an ethical industry so economically important in this country but it would bother me no matter what the alt left was attacking because really it's attacking a pillar of our democracy that is we don't break the laws if we don't get our way in an election now this has been going on for years and you can't even blame it all on Justin Trudeau and his extremist principal secretary Gerald BOTS these images I'm showing now of an environmentalist riot on Burnaby Mountain in BC against the Kinder Morgan transparent pipe line expansion they were from a few years back when Stephen Harper was the prime minister and he had a majority government and Christy Clark was the premier of BC with a majority government there so you can't blame Matt on Justin Trudeau or John Horgan the NDP premier can you I mean you can a bit their party's their political allies are part of these illegal attacks the CBC itself not only acts as the PR agency for these eco terrorists but they send in their last recognizable on-air personality David Suzuki to stand shoulder to shoulder with the criminals as you can see here I say criminals because they are breaking the law even the foreign-funded activists have a weird gross shantytown in Burnaby they call it camp cloud which sounds peaceful and and like it would smell fresh like a cloud in fact it's squalid and heaped with garbage just like the Occupy Wall Street slums were and in fact it's pretty much the same people behind it and they're they're criminals I'm sorry they are again and again they assault the police in some cases injuring the police but as you heard Lee Humphrey tell us the other day politicized prosecutors are laying the lowest possible charges against these criminals even when police are assaulted but there are some charges I was pleased to see that Elizabeth May the leader of the Green Party was charged with contempt of court for violating a court order by protesting on Kinder Morgan property and it's appropriate that she was charged you can't be a lawmaker and a lawbreaker I mean that goes to my point before the rule of law you know the rules a democracy say that it you not going to always get your way in democracy and you have to accept that you have to within the system you can't do it the way Elizabeth main wants to do be a part of democracy that's an honorable member of parliament as they're called with all the privileges and powers that come with it but then if things don't go your way if you don't get a vote just plain old break the law like a criminal no you can't you can't do that anyways to the news of the day I want to talk about this story in the Vancouver Sun earlier this week Kinder Morgan protester argues the defense of necessity excused Court defiance let me read a few lines for you I'm actually good and we read quite a bit and I'm not going to omit a single word and the reason is want to show you how the Vancouver's some son has become a stenographer for these law breakers just giving them a free platform without any pushback or rebuttal so bear with me I'm gonna read for about a full minute here okay one of the protesters arrested at Kinder Morgan's trans mountain pipeline expansion project argued Wednesday that it was necessary for him to act to prevent what he called a bigger crime from being committed tom Sandborn who was taken into custody after allegedly violating a court-ordered injunction at the company's Burnaby work site and faces a criminal contempt of court charge said he wants to be able to use the defense of necessity at his upcoming trial he told BC Supreme Court justice kenneth affleck that the project amounted to what he called serious crimes against First Nations treaty rights the environment and the safety of nearby residents quote the crime that was being conducted by the Canadian state and by Kinder Morgan was a major crime and we were justified in - in intervening to try to stop them said Sanborn you know goes on for quite a bit like that that's that's junk law that's junk politics it's crazy talk but the Vancouver Sun just sort of copies and pastes his speech right in the newspaper eventually the story gets around at quoting the prosecutor for a few sentences of the other side and then the story ends this way the judge pointed out to Sanborn that none of the available legal avenues including appealing the court injunction had been taken before some people decided to disobey the court order unquote yeah that's the thing that's the point if you think a court order is wrong appeal it to a higher court or the underlying law through the system through legislation don't just say you're going to break the law okay so that's the story but there's a bit more to this story because who is that Sandborn I mean if you relied on the Vancouver Sun to you know tell you you think he was just some guy some random Vancouver guy in today's Vancouver Sun he's mentioned again and he's described only as a professional writer really sadhu Tom Sanborn is no that is not who Tom Sanborn is Tom Sanborn is a professional lifelong protester and activist who works for foreign-funded anti-oil lobby groups how do I know this well I have access to this amazing research machine called Google unlike the Vancouver Sun apparently so I typed in the words comm Sandborn I know I managed to think of doing that without even going to journalism school or getting a government grant and nine out of the top ten hits on the very first page of Google results show that he is a professional anti aural activist I mean is he a professional writer well sure he writes down his activism it's true but to call him a professional writer does not illuminate the truth it actually obscures it so I clicked on the very first link that came up on Google the very first one and and it takes you to the website of the taiyi a vancouver-based left-wing environmentalist website that is explicitly funded by the anti oil lobby group called the tides foundation it's actually the very first time I heard the word tides foundation is they were giving money to the Tyee let me the very first paragraph to you so this is literally the first thing that comes up on Google and this is the first thing that's on that first page Tom Sanborn was born in Alaska and raised in the wilderness by wolves later Jesuits at the University of San Francisco and radical feminists in Vancouver generously gave time and energy to the difficult task of educating and humanizing him tom has a formal education to a BA from UBC he has been practicing the dark arts of journalism off and on ever since University and now also has about five decades of justice peace and environmental campaigning under his belt now there's a bit of self-deprecating humor there he wasn't actually raised by wolves no one is but that's not the only liberties taken what follows on that webpage is his professional writing by which any normal reader who would immediately say holy cow this guy is a full-time Marxist activist the second hit on Google when you type in Tom Sanborn is the national observer another extremist outfit literally founded by Linda Solomon the sister of Joel Solomon the founder of the tides foundation just a reminder the tides foundation is a 150 million dollar a year San francisco-based Marxist lobby group that funnels money to literally dozens of anti-science activists in Canada here's their IRS disclosure called form 990 there is virtually no left-wing group in Canada they do not fund but they have a special focus on extremist environmentalist groups now I'm not going to go through the rest of Tom Tom sanborns bio but you see my point here is a kook in the BC Court saying he is the legal right to break the law because this legally approved fully vetted and regulated pipeline company is committing a larger crime and the Vancouver Sun just writes that down boil e and they do not disclose that this Tom Sanborn is a journalist activist paid for by foreign antio a lobbyist they hid that from you and while we're on this same Vancouver Sun story look at that main picture again like that man this was the story who's that there's that man being arrested there he's not named in the photo caption they just say police arrest protesters really they don't say who he is but if you follow anti or else ends politics even casually in this country you know who he is that man's name is Clayton Thomas Muller he's not from Burnaby he's not even from British Columbia he's from Manitoba three provinces over he's a professional protester he is paid by various us-funded lobby groups - he literally jetted to Vancouver to be part of that protest he got arrested on purpose but he wouldn't know that from the or would you you'd think it's just you know just British Columbians here is the seminal 2008 tar sands campaign document from the Rockefeller Brothers fund in New York I've shown this too many times before this is the first draft of the battle plan to attack oil sands and pipelines and look at the front groups that agreed to take foreign money to attack the oil sands I've shown this to you before there's the WWF in the top right corner do you see that that's Gerald BOTS old organization he's working for Trudeau now but it used to be the president but you see that one sort of in the middle there it says the indigenous environmental network that's Clayton Thomas Muller he's with a lot of these groups actually he's basically a Hollywood actor hired to give an Aboriginal look and feel to events so it's not all just white liberals from the US like Tom Sanborn there has never been an opinion poll in British Columbia that I've ever seen that has shown that the popular support is against pipelines if the pipelines are done in compliance with environmental standards which of course they are the Kinder Morgan Transplant expansion pipeline has been pumping away for nearly 70 years by the way without incident and it has actually been filling up tanker ships in the Port of Vancouver for decades without a single navigational incident ever this whole trans mountain thing is just a modernization and expansion of an existing pipeline so be Sears know in their bones it's normal it's fine it's safe and there's so many regulators scrutinizing it but if you only pay attention to the CBC or the Vancouver Sun you'd think everyone is against oil and gas and pipelines your neighbors your friends and normal just folks like Tom Sanborn who's at most disclosed as a professional writer oh and that handsome young Aboriginal man on the cover of the vancouver story no no Tom Sanborn is a professional activist clayton-thomas Muller is a professional activist who flew in just to make an appearance it's bad enough that our country is overrun with foreign funded extremists looking to shut down ethical oil to the benefit of OPEC conflict oil our competition but what about the mainstream media the Vancouver Sun for God's sakes that's either too lazy or too complicit to tell there even the basic facts that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
