who has the biggest challenge you've faced in your career been and what did you do to overcome it I think the biggest challenge that I've had in my career was when the second of my uncle's stepped off the board and I stepped into being chairman the difficulty in that is that you're moving from a dynamic where you had two individuals who had run the business for over 40 years and really fundamentally were playing the role of both a governance role as well as an operational role into a management role in terms of running and and so all of a sudden it was a it was a it was a significant shift in the dynamics of the board and in the dynamics of the family and in terms of really generational transition and so shepherding that which thankfully I had a huge amount of help from my cousins and my sisters and and and mother and father etc but it was a significant shift and and to be in that role as chairman was was um was challenging and in that sense to ensure that we did it smoothly and I think we did I think we did and we can successfully say we've come out the other side what I think made it work is is is being open about it and building having having the conversation about it and building a collective vision for what we were trying to do and how to do it sort of along those same lines like that taking on new leadership responsibilities is always a little at least for me I'm nerve-wracking right I mean how do you get past that how when you're coming into a leader leadership position how do you grow into it gracefully would you say and what's a piece of advice you can give there the biggest things that I've learned is to one fundamentally not think that you do or need to have all the answers I find it to be more powerful to approach a situation if I can get my ego out of the way and in fact engage people with questions and an open mind and without a preconceived notion that really helps it's not to say that you shouldn't have an opinion and and and at a certain point need to for sure make a judgment and make call but to really approach it with an open mind and not thinking that you you you need to or that you do have all the answers in advance
