1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,440
"There is Kanye West."

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,570
"I don't know if he wanted 
this type of attention."

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,430
"He's at the center of a hashtag."

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:07,853
Kanye West made

5
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:08,656
what might have been

6
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:09,590
his most controversial

7
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,960
statement to date

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,780
during an interview with TMZ.

9
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,990
“When you hear about slavery for 400 years

10
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,300
— for 400 years?

11
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,930
That sounds like a choice.”

12
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,010
But historians reject this argument.

13
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,140
Here’s why.

14
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,030
Kanye's idea is rooted in misconceptions

15
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,760
about slaves being complacent.

16
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,530
It also ignores the
history of slave resistance.

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,660
“The enslaved Africans

18
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,430
resisted persistently

19
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,130
in a number of different ways.

20
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,060
Whether not working as hard as they could

21
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,920
to something as widespread

22
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,030
as a slave revolt.

23
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,150
And so the biggest

24
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,720
misunderstanding of slavery is this

25
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,630
dominant idea, during slavery

26
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,380
and after slavery,

27
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,286
of the docile enslaved African.”

28
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:51,850
And while he has tried to portray

29
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,850
his latest comment

30
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,730
as revolutionary free thought —

31
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,640
“Do you feel that I'm being free 
and I’m thinking free?"

32
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,880
— far from being new

33
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,590
or revolutionary,

34
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,590
the idea that slaves were

35
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,260
complicit in keeping up

36
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,170
with slavery is age old.

37
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,270
Prof. Kendi: "The ideas that he is sharing

38
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,720
are actually quite old.

39
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,630
There was a very prominent

40
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,780
post-slavery theory

41
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,000
that black people were

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,900
not resisting enslavement

43
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,410
because they recognized

44
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,590
that enslavement was better

45
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,740
for them.

46
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,010
That really lasted,

47
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,900
even among scholars

48
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,700
who wrote about slavery,

49
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,500
well into the 1940s and 1950s."

50
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,260
By repeating the narrative

51
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,980
that enslaved people were docile

52
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,000
Kanye works to

53
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,420
blame the oppressed

54
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,610
for what happened to them.

55
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,610
It puts all the responsibility

56
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,370
on the individual

57
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,370
and ignores systemic inequality.

58
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,880
Today, the conservative ideology

59
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,100
of individualism

60
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,080
and "pull yourself up by the bootstraps"

61
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,340
follows a similar pattern.

62
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,330
"People want to call it systemic racism.

63
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:47,920
No!"

64
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,640
"It wasn’t what they were doing to me,

65
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,640
it's what I wasn't doing."

66
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
"You do not have to sit around

67
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,600
and wait for somebody else

68
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,260
to do things for you."

69
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,720
Prof. Kendi: "According to this
body of thought

70
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,070
racial disparities exist and persist

71
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,650
because black people

72
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,710
haven’t taken personal responsibility

73
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,132
for their lives,

74
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:10,840
because there’s something wrong with them,

75
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
because they’re enslaved

76
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
to the welfare state,

77
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,220
and they refuse to resist

78
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,150
in the way they refuse

79
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,890
to resist to the slaveholder."

80
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,730
This thinking allows Kanye

81
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,270
to claim his own success.

82
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,950
But by using his platform

83
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,610
to share historically inaccurate

84
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,930
information, he makes people

85
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,550
believe that things in the past

86
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,110
would have played out differently

87
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,650
had they been there.

88
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,270
It glosses over the real violence

89
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,870
and suffering of slavery,

90
00:02:33,870 --> 00:00:00,000
and it muddles accountability.
