Switzerland may not be in the EU but it could still be facing its own version of brexit the Swiss People's Party has received permission to collect signatures in support of a referendum to end Switzerland's free movement agreement with the EU the move would hand back to the country full control over immigration at the moment the current policy allows EU citizens to live and work freely in Switzerland and vice versa the SVP has until July next year to collect 100,000 signatures if successful the proposal will be considered by the government and Parliament in Bern before being put to a vote the co-president of the youth wing of the SVP is convinced the public would vote in favour of stopping free movement we are the biggest party in Switzerland we are the strongest party and we have made a lots of initiatives and in 2014 the Swiss People's Party aim has launched that initiative against mass emigration so why shouldn't it work a second time and I'm sure the Swiss people will won't vote for that initiative that we can stop that free movement deal with the European Union although the results of the 2014 referendum aim to limit immigration from the EU quotas were never imposed by Parliament instead MP is agreed on a solution to give unemployed domestic workers preference over EU nationals seeking jobs in Switzerland and niels factor again believed the amount of new arrivals is simply unsustainable we have got massive problems with mass migration and we want to stop that we had a migration additionally to Switzerland for with about 800,000 persons that's really a threat to our democracy Twitter land always wants to remain remain independent neutral and free and then the Parliament and the government of Switzerland had time to implement that initiative but they didn't implement that initiative from 2014 because they maybe are scared of the reaction of European Union so I think it is really a big problem because we have got all those left-wing politicians in our Parliament and the government and that's the reason why that initiative against mass immigration couldn't be implemented
