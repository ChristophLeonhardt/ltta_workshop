00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:15,022
There’s different ways to celebrate moms.

2
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:29,748
I guess the social construct of Mother’s
Day is this gender role of domestic work,

3
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:34,024
women’s work traditionally, oh, give Mom a
day off because she does all these

4
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:36,980
domestic things for the household.
But things are different,

5
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,774
and some families don’t have moms at all,
they have either two dads or

6
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,654
different people who play that
role for them and it’s important

7
00:00:44,654 --> 00:00:49,146
to experience you know different
gender and what that looks like.

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,362
My drag name is also my mother’s name so
it kind of hits home for me today.

9
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:32,094
My mother has come around and supported me
in my adult years, but seeing these young

10
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:36,784
children, you know, tugging at my dress,
looking at my jewelry, interested in me

11
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:40,356
Parents, mothers wanting to
take pictures with me,

12
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:46,560
it would have been really life-changing to
have a role model, celebrating femininity,

13
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,612
not being a traditional woman,
with my mother around.

14
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,044
Happy Mother’s Day, Mom.
You’re the original gangster Ona,

15
00:01:59,044 --> 00:00:00,000
and I hope I’m making you proud.
