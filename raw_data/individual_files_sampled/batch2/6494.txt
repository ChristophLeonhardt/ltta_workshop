- opposition leaders in Venezuela had their homes raided and those individuals were arrested by the Intelligence Agency in the country family members posted videos of these opposition leaders their names are Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma being detained and claimed that Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro should be held responsible for whatever happened to them now the family members are not certain where they were taken or what their fate will be but they are concerned about their family members safety these are two individuals who have been extremely vocal in their opposition to Maduro and these raids did take place in the middle of the night in fact at 12:27 a.m. according to the wife of one of the opposition leaders the time when the dictatorship kidnaps Leopoldo at my house she also said they just took Leopoldo from the house we don't know where he is or where he's being taken and we have a video of the situation family members did film it it's really difficult to watch especially when you consider the context of this story but we want to show it to you so let's take a quick look at that that was the sound of the jury coming in on Maduro so now we know what Maduro is all about yesterday we had a long discussion about how look in the past there's been a lot of propaganda done against Latin American countries especially if they were supporting their the poor in the middle class in those countries and not working on behalf of usually multinational corporations based in the US but we presented some significant evidence as to why Maduro was being dictatorial and it was not just the victim of propaganda and when he immediately arrests his political opponents after a so-called election he's making it completely obvious what what he's up to it's not that you can't ever arrest someone that is in politics sometimes crimes are committed in there are issues Governor McDonnell and Virginia was arrested the Supreme Court then let him go under preposterous circumstances here in the US but you know I would have pushed for investigations of the torture and the illegal wiretapping that the Bush administration did but there is a process that you go through exactly and you don't just kidnap people in the middle of the night and not tell people where they are and you take your time you build a case you do an investigation if it's real you go through an important and unbiased process that is that certainly does not appear to be what happened here that's exactly right and and so look yesterday when we covered what was going on in Venezuela we talked about that you know incredibly fraudulent election that took place essentially Nicolas Maduro wanted to do away with the remaining legislative body that checks you know his power and he wanted to replace it with a new assembly what which would have the power to rewrite the 1999 Constitution so on Sunday the government did hold that controversial vote and it resulted in the creation of this new legislative body that Maduro has called for to redraft the Constitution there Prohm Maduro individuals who will essentially do his bidding and so any and all form of democracy in the country has now been wiped away and the Trump administration has responded to that in the form of sanctions and so look I I think sanctions in some cases work in this case you know it's it's a mixed bag while there will be consequences that Maduro will face as a result of these sanctions the reality is the people who will suffer the most are you know the innocent people of Venezuela who are already going hungry so our reaction to this is no is a difficult one to solve yeah and and there's no easy answers there but we should have some response because this is clearly not right and it's an affront and perhaps even the abolition of democracy in destruction of democracy in in Venezuela so look if you're judging Maduro on these actions you should and we just did but at the same time there's going to be people who are you know look at Venezuela in this cases like as if we're high and mighty and and have a sanctimonious opinion of them but the reality is here in the US we had a presidential campaign that was chanting about their political opponents lock her up lock her up right and when Trump did not lock up Hillary Clinton in a similar fashion after the election and to his credit he did not hit a lot of his supporters including Ann Coulter were outraged and said he had betrayed the campaign promise presumably they would have loved this the guys that were chanting lock him up lock her up and so we got to be careful not to throw too many stones well you know when our house is partially made of glass don't get me wrong we should condemn it we should also fix our own mess and and not fall into these kind of situations and finally of course the right-wingers who are like ah see this is what socialism is no there's socialist democracies all over Europe they work perfectly well in fact most of them rank at the very top of the happiness scale right in terms of how well their economy is doing us standard of living all those things this is not socialism ironically it's fascism when you say ok no I'm grabbing all the power I now control the entire legislative body and I arrest my political opponents that is not connected to socialist ideology at all that's just dictatorial yeah there were there were a lot of mistakes made in the way that they structured their economy and you know overspending was certainly one of the components I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like oh no that like the social programs were but wanting to take care of the poor is a good thing you should want to take care of the poor but I think that you know unfortunately they didn't foresee the future especially when it came to oil prices and how they fluctuate they relied way too much on oil and they were like way too much on importing things rather than manufacturing things in their own country there were so many different factors that played a role into why Venezuela is the way it is now but I just want to be clear I mean there's no criticism toward the people of Venezuela this is all about you know a government that was irresponsible and then proceeded to compound their problems yeah in fact 70% of Venezuelans are against the government so it's certainly not on them for what their government is doing to them finally I just want to animates a good point there are three components to what went wrong in Venezuela one is actually how they applied socialism in this case where they did price controls now Richard Nixon did price controls here in America and he was a Republican it was a bad idea when he did it's a bad idea when Medora did it if and there are varying degrees of socialism and they do not do price controls in other socialist countries so it is not by definition but that does lean socialist I understand that want to acknowledge that and I disagree with that that is not certainly my vision or the European vision for socialism so but it's a criticism of that is fair though then there is the incompetent mismanagement well cap no do what incompetent mismanagement look at our White House right so Maduro and Chavez to some degree definitely bungled how they handle oil in the economy yes and then the third component is the dictatorial part which has nothing to do with the system of government because right-wing government sometimes turn dictatorial and left-wing governments turn dictatorial in fact this is a playbook right out of Putin an arrow on and they were both right-wingers so that part has again nothing to do with their economic system help us build independent media together TYT Network calm /join
