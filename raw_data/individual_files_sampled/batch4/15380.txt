so why care about movies and entertainment because these debates we're currently having involving politics from gender roles to free speech oppression are all symptoms of an idea embedded and or nurse to fruition by these archetypal heroes and stories that we watched movies politics are and always will be downstream from culture because art pushes boundaries and these new ideas help shape the way we view the world around us think about it from bashing the traditional American family in the 60s and 70s to destroying traditional healthy relationships in the 90s - now villainizing Western civilization entirely where do you think this new push will lead movies are something to pay attention to they will predict the lifestyles and laws our children will be surrounded with so where are these new movies leading us let's find out I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood the sake of time let's just jump into the hero's journey and how it's changed in recent years let's look at the original Star Wars for instance it follows perfectly the hero's journey laid out by Joseph Campbell in his book the hero with a thousand faces you follow a central character through a coming-of-age tale to maximise and challenge his potential and become something greater than themselves and struggle and clash against evil does that sound very Jordan Peterson esque well it should so let's take a look at the new Star Wars the last Jedi who is the hero what do they learn what did we learn and more importantly what were they struggling against the difference if you grew up on the first this hero's path can apply to whatever you want that journey will suit you for whatever field you decide to go into and whoever you actually are the reason is it doesn't answer any questions for you it's a story without explanation other than a fight against tyranny it's true meaning and characters are up for your interpretation the new leftist propaganda last Jedi lays it out clearly and blankly for you there is no central character there's nothing we learn except for the fact that we need to take orders so what's the point rebel against what these successful these capitalists why because they're greedy and evil we must also repel against any societal norms and stereotypes the patriarchal system is embedded in our culture we must rise against it and we need female leaders and people need to not be Mavericks like Poe Dameron don't be a hero men should follow and our heroes like Luke Skywalker actually huge disappointments our traditions are outdated and we must destroy the past oh and all white men are villains it's a story for one specific set of ideas there's a specific villain there's a specific example of a hero it answers every question which means it's telling you who is and specifically how a hero is supposed to act honestly just re-watch both of these and you will know exactly what I'm talking about and you see this playing out more and more in different movies it's not just an objective hero's journey that we can all take a piece from no it's a walking out of a specific ideology that is deemed as the best way to live now where is this going well a few years ago I said don't worry about it because the other day all the studios want is green they want a movie and stories that make the most money but now it seems that that has shifted one of the things I guarantee is gonna be the big shift in his next series of movies is gender roles not by creating interesting and dynamic complex female characters but by beating things over the head here's an example so what's the push now men saving women is bad because it enforces a negative stereotype not taking account that we all need to be saved sometimes but take Black Panther for example he never really saves anyone in particular absolutely no female characters need help his love interest is captured by warlords and in the process of trying to rescue her she breaks out saves herself and then chastises him for even thinking that he needed to help her and the same theme is carried out throughout the movie and I believe this is going to be a common theme of weakening here is not just male here as females alike because you can't really save anyone because they all should be able to save themselves more like a stance against the patriarchy as a hall these stories used to be interpreted and up for debate and helpful in life but now these stories have been hijacked very specific agenda and what is fictionalized in films becomes normalized and policies of the future it frightens me to think that my daughter may feel like she has to act like a man to get respect or that my son's first instinct should be to take a back seat not be a leader and not save anyone now I'm not saying we should just not watch these certain movies I can love movies that completely disagree with the way I view the world and what I think a true hero's journey should be however I think we should all be aware to what we're being shown what it will do and what can happen to society and when movies that do have a great story and a great message I hope we can all go out there and support it just a few things to pay attention to as this next list of summer blockbusters come rolling out I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood if you haven't done it already you can now download the rebel media app that way you have access to the entire rebel lineup and can take it with you wherever you go you
