at sound skin tattoo shop there are plenty of people getting their skin inked business is good and the expectation of people here is that it's about to get even better thanks to President Donald Trump the president promised his tax cut legislation will mean more money in the hands of millions of Americans and that is one of the many reasons the owner of the shop has no doubt about this president I fully support president Trump and I will continue to support President Trump unless president Trump just goes off the wall and does something crazy but I mean I don't see that happening I think he's a very smart man that's a common sentiment in this small quiet town of Mount Sterling Kentucky or nearly 70% of the residents voted for Trump most say they would do it again on the outskirts of town signs of the manufacturing plants that provide jobs to almost 35% of the local employment base after one major plant closed down last year Trump's America first call to keep manufacturing jobs in the u.s. resonated even more we'd like to retain those jobs here and keep the wages and the money here in our country here Trump is still seen as the best hope to do just that well clearly many people here in Mount Sterling still support President Trump not everybody does particularly african-americans a group that Trump has directly challenged during the campaign you're living in poverty your schools are no good you have no jobs 58% of your youth is unemployed what the hell do you have to lose what we had to live with lose her self-respect what we had to lose was dignity Roy Reed is a local city councilman who says it's often forgotten that one-fifth of the population in rural America are minorities who he says have been let down by Trump he made a lot of promises he hasn't kept of one not a one that benefits this community but back at the tattoo shop Trump has seen much differently their support remains permanent just like the ink under the skin Gabriel Sandow al Jazeera now Sterling Kentucky
