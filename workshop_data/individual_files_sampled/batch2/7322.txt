supporters specifically Trump supporters who were sporting queuing on Murch had a Trump event and they wanted to ask them about what queuing on is what are these conspiracy theories why do they believe in them without further ado let's take a look are you holding a big red white and blue cube what happen it's a movement man to the ship I can feel it coming something call it the Great Awakening you're wearing a shirt that says qw w g1w GA what does that mean it means where we go one we go walk q and on is the people that believe in what Trump's trying to do to change our country okay so for those who might have missed this story this week q and on is essentially a group of individuals who believe all sorts of wacky conspiracy theories some incredibly dangerous conspiracy theories that accuse certain members of our government of running child sex rings and things like that it'll remind you a lot of what we heard in the whole pizza gate conspiracy theory and this all started on Infinity Chan or 8chan so it's a little different from 4chan it's actually a little worse than 4chan if you can believe that and the individual who kind of started this or maybe a small group of individuals argue that he was actually a high-level member of government with security clearance and that he knows what the deep state is trying to do against trump and he's actually working from the inside to help protect Trump all sorts of nonsense but anyway there's lots more video but I want you guys to jump in first yeah crazy there so they think that Robert Miller is which makes no sense this Trump is attacking mole or non-stop do you think Robert Muller is a good guy that he's a white hat and that he is actually going to uncover at the end Obama Hillary Clinton George Soros child sex ring and and the COO that they were gonna do against Trump who could who in their right mind would but they use every one of being a pedophile and running child sex rooms including randomly Steven Spielberg Tom Hanks why it's so weird their obsession with pedophilia is insane but to me what was interesting about this is seeing not just young guys who are like in it for the laughs or have lost their minds or whatever but middle-aged women who were like oh yeah yeah of course I don't know that they know that it started on hm I don't know if they know that people are messing with them I mean the guy who started is obviously having the time of his life laughing laughing although he's a terrible guy because he's now set loose upon the world these dangerous people that are mentally unstable and a lot of them aren't so I want to skip ahead to video 11 because what this video will show you is exactly what jank had mentioned this is not a group of teenage boys who are just having fun there are real adults who genuinely believe in these conspiracy theories you believe there is a deep state yes and what do you think that deep states doing you think they're running this country I think they were and they're petrified now thank you they're losing their control but Donald Trump's the president he's running the country yeah but he's having to fight against I mean he said he could do it all himself everything would be so easy when it came in office and he you think he's fighting with a deep state a year and a half into his term I think he's been fighting since before he was elected and who was in this deep state who are the people in it oh I definitely believe that like the Clintons of the bushes the Obamas so you think the Clintons the bushes in the Obamas are running this country as we stand here in the rain no they're trying no I would have loved to know her day job what does she do like as if it turns out she's some kind of like I don't know health care provider or she works in a hospital or something I would be very concerned about the people you know that she works with and the lives that she's charged with you know taking care of this is like some branch davidian kind of sex stuff it's one you know bad situation away from something really terrible and it's scared and it's it shows what our administration right now is doing playing on the fears of people and then playing into this conspiracy junk I mean I don't know what else to call this but it's it's it's sad that they would play into that and create the sphere and create the dangerous situation where people may act and do something crazy well I mean actually it already happened with the the guy going into the restaurant and shooting it up we've got to stop those kinds of things people need to actually do a little research those two online applications of things like the incredible thing is it no one asked to see any evidence no one I mean because there is no evidence first of all and all you need is just some random anonymous person online claiming to be a high-level CIA operative with security clearance and that's it like people will trust in you to the point well where they will believe the most defamatory things about people I we need to fund education like we need to focus on critical thinking in our schools we really do because this is a symptom of a much bigger problem the fact that Americans are this gullible that they would fall for this kind of stuff but let me go to an underlying issue that I think that the rest of the press is not picking up on I think the reason why the and the deep state theory is a little different than Q so the Q and I'm saying it takes a deep state and goes deeper right and and does all the insanity that we just talked about but the reason that I think people will believe in the deep state is because they feel like they're not in control of their own lives and they have a sense that my and you're gonna say I'm reading too much into it but I mean the whole country is upset at the establishment that's why they voted against Hillary Clinton more than they voted for Donald Trump and and they think there's these powerful people of my wages are lone I got no hope I got no the American Dream is dead and they took it from me and I can't tell who it is so if you tell me it's the Latino immigrant that crossed the border I'm gonna believe you if you tell me it's a dangerous Muslim guy I'm gonna believe you if you tell me it's a deep state doing things I don't understand it can't see I'm gonna believe you I think that's the larger story here and then they took that vulnerability they'll all right the H AM guys etc and they exploited it to to bring madness into the world very much so I think it's also kind of a show game I mean it's don't well don't look at what's actually going over here with all the money that's being paid to these politicians okay look at this over here we mad at the immigrant or me mad at the person that's a different color than you rather than actually focusing on the people that are trying to divide us yeah so I was on a show earlier this morning on bull TV and they said you know I called Trump what he is which is incredibly stupid and they said are you trying to call Trump voter stupid and I said yeah okay now what are you allowed to do that I don't know if I'm allowed to do I just did it okay and so but I want you to understand that because what I followed up with is the thing that Hillary Clinton said that was the most correct is the one she had the most criticism for which is the half of trumps voters are the deplorable I believe that in the ER and that's a I don't care that if you cry over that okay but the other half are frustrated and they don't know what's going wrong and they're being exploited by Trump and by these guys and the realities that we can help them if we actually reach out and increase our wages and give them economic dignity and give them health care and actually provide for them instead of the donors you guys want to know what the conspiracy is it's right in front of you we privately financed our elections so all of our politicians work for private interests it's the corporate donors it's the rich donors so it's it's very simple what do they want they want lower taxes they want deregulation and yes unfortunately they control a lot of your lives it's not the deep state it's the donors now James Thompson is running donor free no corporate PACs only small donors so you also work for your donors it's just that they're regular Americans giving you small donations right there's and there's thousands and thousands of them you know I had 29,000 individual donors in the special election my opponent had 400 individual donors and we raised the same amount of money there you go both james thompson com2 easy wasteful young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is
