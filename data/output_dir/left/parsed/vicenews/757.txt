I'm not very very political but what I
hear and see I kind of base it off of
that right it's right wrong and wrong
you have to set a standard at some point
because we as adults are role models and
politicians are really a role model I
don't feel like they should be our role
models but at the same time they're out
there in the light but I will be voting
for Doug Jones because I just felt like
he's a better Kennedy and I feel like
he's going to fight on our behalf
that's what I believe and not even just
for blacks but as a people nothing right
just just let my people right you know
you have to look at the bigger picture
and overall okay so you know why would I
vote for somebody who said I couldn't
get married I can't be happy because you
don't want me to I don't feel that I
have yet to see them say what they gonna
do we would 47th in education with
number five and incarceration shutting
down two schools that don't make sense
then you fail oh we're not racist oh
we're not such-and-such
oh we're not this but you don't want to
sit by you don't want to live by you
don't want us in your school but you
trying to block to put us all together
what do you call that and we should up
here and be the same complacent Alabama
where people don't get out here and make
that voices heard then we're gonna get
what we get we're gonna get a bunch of
more rewards because they're coming here
as long as they're allowed to do it then
of course we got no choice what to sit
back and pray and hope they don't come
in here right my kids tonight
Oh Lord don't make me enslave we can't
just sit and wait and think that
somebody's gonna say what's cause the
rest of the America don't give a
about us and they think it's funny
then we got pedophiles and running
for the Senate you know I'm saying it's
okay with them as long as they get a
vote they don't give a about us
that's what it is
