the left is also now pushing extreme viewpoints with regard to masculinity so the latest iteration of this comes courtesy of Sarah rich over at the Atlantic so Sarah rich has a long piece over the Atlantic called today's masculinity is stifling and let me just point out today's masculinity is less stifling than at any time in the recent past because the fact is that today's masculinity has almost nothing to do with masculinity masculinity used to be tied to the idea of obligations who protect now and I teach my son to be a gentleman what I'm going to teach him is that it is necessary to protect those who are weaker than you are you know if you ever seen the movie American sniper there's a long monologue where the main character talks about how basically people are either sheep wolves or sheepdogs either is going to be aggressors or they are going to be followers or they're going to be sheepdogs protecting the sheep against the wolves it is the job of men to be sheepdogs essentially that is what being a gentleman is it's upholding a moral standard a standard of values taking the slings and arrows in order to protect others right that's what being a man is all about but we have sort of gotten rid of that and instead we've gone with sort of the affectation of manhoods the affectation of manhood is I work out a lot and I drink lots of beer and this is what makes me a man I smoke cigars and that's what makes me me okay what makes you a man is whether you are willing to protect people who are weaker than you and whether you're willing to instill a system of values that protects the liberties of others who are not you right that is what makes you a good human being and more importantly it's what makes you a good man in terms of masculinity that's why it's more important for men right and when you rip away men's mission men tend to become destructive but if the idea is the masculinity now is too is too restrictive what's so restrictive about it well it turns out that when you identify masculinity with the affectation they're a bunch of people who don't like the affectation so first the feminist came for the idea that men should not protect women because that was sexist and then they came for the idea that men should not even engage in the affectation of manhood they should not dress like men they should instead dress like women or if they do dress like women that doesn't make you less of a man okay they've done this routine where masculinity was reduced to the appearance of masculinity and then that itself was attacked so that's exactly the case that's being made by Sarah rich except she is attacking shows in hindsight our son was gearing up to wear a dress to school for quite some time for months he wore dresses or his purple and green mermaid costume on weekends and after school then him again wearing them to sleep in lieu of pajamas changing out of them after breakfast finally one morning I brought him his clean and shirt and he looked at me and said I'm already dressed he was seated on the couch in a great cotton sundress covered in doe-eyed unicorns with rainbow Mane's he'd slept in it and in his dreaming hours I imagined stood at a podium giving inspirational speeches to an audience composed only of himself when he'd woken up he was ready he walked a half block to school with a bounce in his step chest proud my friends are gonna say dresses aren't for boys he told me casually over his shoulder they might I agreed you can just tell them you're comfortable with yourself and that's all that matters I thought of all the other things he could tell them I began to list them but he was off running across the blacktop I scanned the entrance to see whether any parents noticed us as they came and went I hadn't expected my stomach to churn I felt proud of him for his self-assuredness for the way he prepared for this quietly and at his own pace but I worried about what judgements and conclusions parents and teachers might make and of course I was worried that somebody would shame him well they shouldn't shame him they should shame you you're a bad parent okay I'm just gonna put this out there you are a bad parent you should not be allowing your young boy who is not old enough to figure out the ways of life because the kid was not hit puberty yet this is not a kid who is old enough to have figured out masculinity and femininity for you to have sent him to school and address said it can be made fun of by all the other kids is a nasty thing for you to do as a parent there is something to the idea that you should be inculcating yes even the appearance of masculinity and femininity in your own children distinctions between the sexes are important and it is you who are confusing your child your child is not going to be happier because your child is confused as a general rule there are exceptions but as a general rule being gender confused and being confused about the these sort of appearances of gender it is not a worthwhile thing hey you're pleased with his self-assuredness the kids seven the whole self-esteem movement the idea that you can subjectively define the reality around you and everybody is expected to adapt that is not going to work out well ok now that doesn't mean the kid should be bullied the kid should not be bullied bullying is bad in all cases you shouldn't bully the kids but parents have an obligation to protect their kids from bullying and they also have an obligation not to confuse their kids about basic concepts of sex and gender the idea that that boys and girls dressed differently is true in every society in the history of mankind now you may say that there are societies where boys were killed sore boys wear skirts or whatever it is that's not true in American society and is true that in Scottish society men and women do not dress the same men and women do not dress the same because men and women are in fact not the same and it is important to read inculcate those those gender differences those gender differences are a beautiful part of life those gender difference make your child's less confused hey you're telling me when the kid was three and put on a dress you couldn't said you know what sweetheart that's not really appropriate let's go put on some boy clothes but even that statement is apparently too radical for the entire left and.and listen I'll get a lot of flack for saying this obviously from the left because the idea is that we're supposed to pretend that all choices you make for your child's are equivalent they are not equivalent
