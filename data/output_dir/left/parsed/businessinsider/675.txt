in order to fulfill my solemn duty to
protect America and its citizens the
United States will withdraw from the
Paris climate Accord but begin
negotiations to re-enter either the
Paris Accord or in really entirely new
transaction when terms that are fair to
the United States its businesses its
workers its people its taxpayers so
we're getting out but we will start to
negotiate and we will see if we can make
a deal that's fair and if we can that's
great
and if we can't that's fine
