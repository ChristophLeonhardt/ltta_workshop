1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:07,720
There are A LOT of fitness gadgets out there.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,900
In my quest to get fit, I tested 17 of them
over the last few months.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,840
At least one personal trainer I know was a
little bit skeptical.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,050
Yeah, I've been watching these new technologies
come to the market for almost as long as I've

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,580
been a personal trainer, they're just tricks
and tropes.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,140
They're not much different than the Bowflex machines
or, to be honest

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,500
the original Jane Fonda workout video.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,320
But some of these gadgets that are just coming
to the market do so much more than they used

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,900
to do just tracking your activities.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,580
Out of all them, this chest strap was my favorite.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,340
It comes with a robot coach that points the
future -- one where you might not need a human

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,039
trainer at all.

13
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,500
And it works like this.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,610
You wear the chest strap so that it can read
your heart rate, and that connects to Moov's

15
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,890
free app that talks to you.

16
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,280
Welcome to Moov heartrate HIIT outdoor running.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,540
Let’s get moving and warm up in Zone 2.

18
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,240
Moov’s computerized coach tells you what
to do at that exact moment, whether you're

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,909
running outside, or doing bodyweight exercises
indoors.

20
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,490
Swing your arms faster to get your legs moving
quicker.

21
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,500
Let’s crush this round!

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,659
And by reading your heart rate, she knows
how hard you're working - She keeps you honest.

23
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,920
Way to go, you are in the target zone!

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,120
Keep pushing!

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,220
You’re almost at the end of the round – Don’t
give up!

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,250
I've been running for seven years now and
my biggest problem is that I never push myself

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,250
hard enough.

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,950
I end up going on the same, slow, comfortable
30-minute jog, but he Moov HR Burn blasted

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,310
me out of that rut.

30
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:58,060
By the end of these half-hour exercises, I
was drenched in sweat in a way that I never

31
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,220
am when I work-out alone.

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,960
Training with a real person is great, whether
that’s your group instructor,

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,980
your coach or your personal trainer.

34
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,680
But humans?  They’re expensive.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:00:00,000
For the rest of us, this $60 gadget is all
you need.
