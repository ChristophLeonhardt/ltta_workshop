00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
hi everyone say the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other week I think</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,270
was last week I went to New York to hear

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Malcolm Gladwell speak to the author of</font>

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,960
a book i really loved called originals

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,460
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned it once</font>

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,250
or twice or three times in the UK in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

7
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,139
book is published by wh allen in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,030
it's still a penguin company but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,590
exactly sure which one I'm sorry I

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,420
didn't do my research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a bookshop</font>

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,859
you'd probably find this in the business

12
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,230
section or the social<font color="#E5E5E5"> sciences section</font>

13
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,150
or general nonfiction but it was

14
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,740
absolutely fascinating to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of</font>

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that specific genre when it comes to</font>

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,830
nonfiction I tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for Brooks</font>

17
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written well and is interesting</font>

18
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,009
even if it's completely outside my realm

19
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,719
of expertise I don't let know I'd love

20
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,890
to hit any recommendations<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

21
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,180
nonfiction that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have found</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find more directly helpful with</font>

24
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,670
my work I don't know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

25
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,290
it's me because I'm loving like I'm

<font color="#CCCCCC">like this is going to be a book about</font>

45
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,610
individual geniuses and do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

46
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,110
need another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those generally</font>

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">speaking i do you have a big problem</font>

48
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,750
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of individual genius</font>

49
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,430
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's true i</font>

50
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,170
think that that comes from collaboration

51
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,909
and in as much as you have those great

52
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,159
minds<font color="#E5E5E5"> it always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes from something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

report that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is not in fact about</font>

55
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,860
individual genius to me at least

56
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">originals was about how we approach</font>

57
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,670
creative production idea generation and

58
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,710
also how we like present and interact

59
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,960
with original ideas and creative ideas

60
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ideas in rural go back to the</font>

individuals point there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

62
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,579
individuals mentioned there's Lucy Stone

63
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,110
as Martin Luther King Nurse Jackie

64
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,479
Robinson there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> carmen medina there's</font>

14 came<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he came up with the idea of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the segway and that's kind of picked</font>

67
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,490
apart why that doesn't work and why that

68
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,340
isn't the massive revolutionary success

69
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,290
that it was sort of a pitch to be but in

70
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">my opinion one of the most effective</font>

71
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,899
case studies was actually one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

72
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:04,690
earliest it was

73
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,730
the team behind the glasses brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> Warby</font>

74
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Parker not least because for me it</font>

75
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,570
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively unpicked the whole</font>

76
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,690
myth of creative geniuses and pioneers

77
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,210
business pioneers of massive risk takers

78
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,950
in fact I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was a lot</font>

79
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,900
about controlling<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> planning and</font>

80
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,090
preparing and that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

81
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,770
resonated so much more with me because I

82
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,530
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hate risk takers in business you</font>

83
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,180
just take risks that the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> the myth</font>

of like taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> risks on every single</font>

85
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,550
front I think is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> flawed and it</font>

86
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,770
really affects<font color="#E5E5E5"> the approach we have to</font>

business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and entrepreneurship especially</font>

88

within like startup culture one thing

89
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,950
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really liked about the writing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

90
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though it was presenting all</font>

these case studies of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these successes</font>

and sometimes not so much success in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

96
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,340
what these amazing people over here

we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in their distance from you</font>

approaches both mental and sort of

104

methodical felt very possible and

105
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,930
implementable to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> without using any</font>

grant discusses the scale of idea

happens for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these genius minds these</font>

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,680
people that we put aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> as special</font>

118
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,090
cases because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the many</font>

the room people used to brand yourself

127
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,350
with and the way that they express their

128
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,060
opinions as well that is really really

129
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,070
really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's very tempting</font>

130
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,630
when you create<font color="#CCCCCC"> something when you have</font>

131
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,580
an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mainly surround yourself with</font>

people saying good things about it

133
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's a feeling that</font>

negativity can affect your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

135
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,140
create things because it just goes so

136
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,740
deep and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just become demoralized but</font>

137
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,590
actually the freedom to share an opinion

138
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,110
a dissenting opinion is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

139
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,570
even if that opinion isn't correct

140
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,180
because it just it can highlight certain

141
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,950
flaws in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but it can also</font>

142
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,680
bolster the creation of your idea as

143
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it can just it is such an</font>

important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the process to have</font>

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,520
what you're doing another fascinating

147
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,350
case study in the book is about a firm

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">you risk being fired and that starts</font>

153
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the interview</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process are you going</font>

154
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,170
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> into me and you have a really</font>

155
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,850
tough time and you walk out and you say

156
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the receptionist or whoever like wow</font>

157
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,020
I just kind of like completely beaten up

158
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,430
that was really difficult then they'll

159
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,990
bring you back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the interview room</font>

160
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,910
and how do you say what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just said to</font>

161
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,080
the people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> front of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so you can</font>

162
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,730
discuss it it's very like open culture

163
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,050
and while that method won't necessarily

164
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,790
work for everyone that has worked for

165
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,170
that particular company because if you

166
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,880
have an idea people will honestly tell

167
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,440
you what they think in the room rather

168
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,030
than waiting whispering to each other

169
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,860
behind the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> about why they don't</font>

170
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with what you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

171
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,290
approach recently I've noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

172
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,280
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my favorite creatures</font>

173
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,140
particularly writers but just across the

174
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,150
board<font color="#E5E5E5"> really will share a lot of their</font>

175
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,920
process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> rock what they're making</font>

176
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,660
when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not finished like they'll</font>

177
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,160
share it along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way and get feedback</font>

178
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,900
and get ideas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

179
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,400
I really hide from doing with a lot of

180
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,410
why make<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes sounds</font>

181
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,090
like a fear of rejection or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fear that</font>

182
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,130
I've just complete forward everything I

183
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,500
create is terrible and just panic the

184
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,150
internal panic that's so much of your

185
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">identity or and it's my identity is</font>

186
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,590
linked to what I create and it's some

187
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,630
form of expression and that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

188
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,160
reject it and therefore they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> reject</font>

189
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
me very deep stuff I'm learning to put

190
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">things out when they're not quite</font>

191
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,040
finished so that I'm in better finish

192
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,750
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so that I may better make</font>

193
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,550
progress with them I get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fiction</font>

194
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,840
too but I particularly love<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonfiction</font>

195
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,700
for the way in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which it helps me notice</font>

196
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,890
my approaches to work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also make</font>

197
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,540
social interactions it kind of suggests

198
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,220
placed as where I might try<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

199
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">different it doesn't push anything on</font>

200
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,730
you or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to accept it if</font>

201
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,560
it does push something on you it just

202
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives you</font>

203
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,830
for an approach that you can try and

204
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,840
sort of almost test out like a social

205
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">studies experiment I was also really</font>

206
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,890
really really really really really to

207
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,690
see that originals included some case

208
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,790
studies many case studies with women and

209
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,320
particularly women of color because

210
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,060
there's an extent to which speaking up

211
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,310
is completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different when you take in</font>

212
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,050
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other factors speaking up in a</font>

213
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,910
boardroom or challenging an idea in a

214
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,200
conversation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your work environment</font>

215
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,990
can cost you your status or even your

216
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,030
job or if you do go contrary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

217
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,650
bitchy you're bossy you're aggressive

218
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,980
and you were an angry black woman that

219
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,600
kind of language but it was poking about

220
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,190
very frankly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

221
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,050
wish Malcolm Gladwell had brought up I'm

222
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,450
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the event but you know life is long</font>

223
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,800
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of conversations to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

224
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,270
heard about the event in New York

225
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,950
Malcolm Gladwell<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked Adam grant a lot</font>

226
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,420
of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wouldn't have and</font>

227
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,800
it's fascinating either you can tell a

228
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,360
lot about people from the questions they

229
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask Gladwell's questions started with</font>

230
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,050
personal background and then went on to

231
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,550
a lot of kind of hypothetical case

232
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,500
studies at one point Gladwell gave grant

233
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,420
the task of coming up with some sort of

234
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,980
student recruitment form for the

235
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">University at which Adam grant works</font>

236
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,560
what I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I found really</font>

237
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,290
fascinating was<font color="#E5E5E5"> facades recruitment in</font>

238
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,530
pairs like having one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and asking</font>

239
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,510
them about their values<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're all</font>

240
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,610
finding a way really to assess their

241
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,230
values and their priorities and so on

242
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,900
and then in addition to having that

243
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,100
recruiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person they're</font>

244
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,630
recruiting their complete alter ego

245
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,040
someone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has completely different</font>

246
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,120
values and completely different

247
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,410
priorities so obviously when I was

248
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,490
listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that was thinking a</font>

249
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,050
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and the different</font>

250
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,970
places that we all congregate and the

251
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,370
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which we sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of exclude sorts</font>

252
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,870
of people certain thinking from those

253
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,820
spaces and hello kitten that how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

254
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,530
can sometimes be damaging but how that

255
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,900
can sometimes be protective in a way I

256
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,920
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want also talked a lot about</font>

257
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,690
criticism how in the class that he

258
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,040
teachers<font color="#E5E5E5"> he asked people to submit</font>

259
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,200
evaluations I think was via email and

260
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,510
then he held a class in which he read

261
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,460
out those evaluations openly with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

262
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,900
class and like they discussed them I

263
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,550
hadn't really open discussion about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

264
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,170
and in that discussion it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

265
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,050
evaluation<font color="#CCCCCC"> on you know how he was in the</font>

266
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,240
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how who was like on stage in</font>

267
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,040
that conversation but also how he took

268
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,750
the feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

269
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,460
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> that direct feedback there's also</font>

270
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,290
McLaren of 2a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Malcolm Gladwell asked</font>

271
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,120
Adam grant how he meditates a wedding he

272
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,280
meditates I don't work said we does it

273
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">when he responds to emails and Madame</font>

274
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was quiet I think it taken</font>

275
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,620
aback and I would almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> say appalled by</font>

276
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,600
that concept like the fact that there is

277
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that moment of like online connection</font>

278
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,860
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably isn't laying it true</font>

279
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,289
reflection true meditation true quiet

280
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,640
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I'm grant expertly</font>

281
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,260
connection between his thoughts and

282
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,419
other ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the world is where sparks</font>

283
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,580
fly and that really maybe more than

284
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,710
anything he said that evening really

285
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,510
resonated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because that's how I</font>

286
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,710
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I'm reading your comments</font>

287
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,300
that's how I feel when I'm watching

288
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,130
other people talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube videos</font>

289
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,840
that's how I feel even<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes when</font>

290
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,160
I'm reading books and when I'm listening

291
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to things on the radio it is in those</font>

292
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,660
moments where ideas happen for me and

293
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,700
connections happen for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's the</font>

294
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,980
most exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I fight I really</font>

295
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,450
struggle with silence as I've said

296
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,520
before I struggle with creating anything

297
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,400
in silence or reflecting productively in

298
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,230
silence or even with guided meditations

299
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,880
in silence I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal you find</font>

300
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,520
those moments of connection of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

301
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,740
connection within myself in silence and

302
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,210
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that's a flaw or</font>

303
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,280
something but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the idea of</font>

304
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,810
wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in conversation with</font>

305
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">people on wanting those sparks to fly</font>

306
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:24,560
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beautiful Taylor Swift song that</font>

307
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,050
