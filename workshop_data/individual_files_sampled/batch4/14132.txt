Mark Ruffalo better known as the Hulk in THE AVENGERS helped put on the people state-of-the-union resist and this did kind of happen one day before the actual State of the Union which is one of the most-watched in history and was the most tweeted about ever and they did resist super super hard by complaining about stuff and being absolutely unbearable to listen to for half the country where they complained super super hard about losing an election forgetting the fact that there will be another election in three years welcome to a free country where you don't always get what you want I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood Bruce Banner opened up by saying quote tweeting facebooking educating and caring for our country I know you haven't been at a country club for half a year huffing down cheeseburgers sitting on a golden toilet waiting for someone to bring you a chocolate cake I'm assuming that was aimed at Trump you know the guy who doesn't drink and who seems to never sleep because he's constantly working and who be down all the Democratic Party members that I single campaign donor yeah I got not sure if you saw the last Ruffalo movie but maybe mr. angry himself should slow down on the chocolate cake is making the romance between he and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow characters seem even more unbelievable than Hillary Clinton's standing up for women you remember her calling all the women bimbos who said that her husband raped them and had to recently come out and explain why she kept on a staffer who was accused of sexual harassment multiple times and you might be thinking Ben you're coming down way too hard on Mark Ruffalo but keep in mind this is the same guy that called for NBC and MSNBC to stop hiring all white conservatives and this is the same guy that went to Twitter to start a GoFundMe page to kill Rush Limbaugh by flying him into a hurricane then the beloved mayor of New York Bill DeBlasio took the stage saying quote for too many years good people all over the country have talked themselves out of their own power unquote maybe you should start by empowering his own community particularly as police forts in minority communities I mean they're incredibly loyal and almost exclusively vote Democrat which is why New York has been a blue state since became time however in his own City according to the NYPD 96% of all shooting victims are black or Hispanic and in 97 percent of all shootings the trigger is pulled by a black or Hispanic person yes keep lecturing us on tolerance and how the real to these african-american Hispanic communities our white supremacists know then catching enemy took the stage who is the organizer of the women's March I think it's really great to use your right to free speech and assembly so what what are you what are you watching for anyone right that men have them women don't have no oh wait there isn't any oh so this is just another abortion March for women's health is the left flights to college because we are so far behind in America as far as being progressive and accepting of abortions right let's just compare that to the rest of the civilized world South Korea illegal Poland illegal Ireland illegal literally zero places in Europe allowing any abortions past week 17 as far as I can tell and only after those points our abortion is allowed if the life the mother is literally in danger also everyone wanting abortion basically across Europe has to go through mandatory counseling to let them know that this is not the only way the rest of Europe that we all try to look up to is way way way more strict than abortion laws than in America in fact we just had a bill struck down to say that even when the life is viable past 20 weeks that is still okay somehow like after 20 weeks the baby can live outside of the womb and yet that's still not enough we're still so progressive that thing can be just coming out of the womb and you could be allowed to kill it that's right these brave women are fighting for the right to kill other unborn women past 20 weeks good for you but then there's a lot of women have a great reason for wanting to kill these babies after 20 weeks well let's look at some of them in the state of Florida you are required by law to state why the abortion is happening to these the most accurate statistics rape incest and the life of the mother at count 4 0.15 percent of all abortions while 98% say I just don't want this maybe they're marching because men in general had it so much better than women you know not fortune 500 companies just life in general well then they must be celebrating the fact that the majority of all homelessness are men men almost exclusively take up all workplace deaths they also topped the charts in suicide and depression all these men they've got it so easy thank God they marched John Leguizamo took the stage next to say that colors is what America is all about like race was the only thing that our forefathers cared about when creating America America is about having a bunch of different races not establishing a country that stood on values character and community sounds more like merit to me Christina Jimenez of United We Dream met a passionate plea for the DREAM Act and an undocumented people saying quote we are families we are documented unafraid and here to stay she declared so let me get this straight you have the right to break our sovereign laws demand and promote financial support from the people living here all while marching around calling everyone else racist so basically just not holding illegal immigrants the same standards that we all hear as citizens are required to live by and most importantly demanding citizenship ahead of the illegal immigrants here in America who are following our sovereign laws and going through the process legally then Michael Moore waddled up the stage and then said that everyone running for office must have a priority of impeaching Trump that we should not worry about Mike Pence anymore Wow that really sounds like the people State of the Union doesn't it that really just speaks to all of America right maybe it just seems like it to them because these millionaires all live in the entitled lap of luxury until we find purpose and feeling that they're so how virtuous because of their struggle to feel like they are morally superior or it could be wrong I've been Davies disappear Hollywood if you like this video and others like it please consider becoming a Premium Member to the rebel that way you'll have first access to
