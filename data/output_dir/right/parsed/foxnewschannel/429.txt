>> Martha: BRIT, THANK YOU.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
SOURCES TELLING FOX NEWS THAT
THE NEW FBI REPORT COULD BE
FINISHED AS SOON AS TOMORROW.
>> A LOT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON
WHAT COMES BACK FROM THE FBI IN
TERMS OF THEIR ADDITIONAL
NUMBERS HAVE INVESTIGATION.
I THINK THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS
DOING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW.
>> Martha: JOINING ME NOW AN
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW IS SOMEONE
WHO WORKED ON ONE OF THOSE
BEDDINGS ARE JUDGE KAVANAUGH,
PERSONALLY.
KRISTI REMINGTON HAS KNOWN JUDGE
KAVANAUGH FOR OVER 20 YEARS, WAS
INVOLVED IN HIS FIFTH BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATION WHEN HE WAS
APPOINTED TO THE D.C. CIRCUIT
COURT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE TONIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS
TIME FRAME IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY
HAD TO DO?
WE KNOW THEY SPOKE TO DEBORAH
RAMIREZ AT LENGTH AND MARK JUDGE
AT LIKE THREE AS IT MAKES IS
THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY WRAP UP
AS SOON AS TOMORROW?
>> CERTAINLY, AS MANY PEOPLE
HAVE SAID, HE'S BEEN THROUGH SIX
FULL-FIELD BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATIONS.
SO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS
GENERALLY BUILD ON THE PREVIOUS
ONES, AND AS A SENATE HAS ASKED,
IT WAS THIS ONE WOULD BE VERY
LIMITED SCOPE.
I WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY IT
WOULDN'T TAKE VERY LONG, AND THE
FBI HAS MANY INVESTIGATORS THEY
GET SENT OUT.
>> Martha: A QUOTE FROM
DR. FORD'S LEGAL TEAM TO THE FBI
TODAY BECAUSE THEY ARE UPSET
THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN
CONTACTED IN THE COURSE OF THIS
SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION.
THEY SAY IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT
THE FBI COULD CONDUCT A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION OF DR. FORD'S
ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT INTERVIEWING
HER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, OR THE
WITNESSES THAT WE HAVE
IDENTIFIES
IDENTIFIED IN OUR LETTERS TO
YOU."
>> BOTH JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TESTIFIED UNDER
OATH.
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE FBI
WOULDN'T FEEL THE NEED TO GO
BACK OUT TO THEM, THEY HAD
ACCESS TO THAT TESTIMONY
PRESUMABLY.
>> Martha: A LOT OF WHAT WE
ARE SEEING IN THE INTERIM IN
TERMS OF NEW INFORMATION THAT IS
KIND OF FLOODING THE MARKET HERE
INCLUDES A LOT OF REALLY WILD
CHARGES FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE
THAT HE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL OR
COLLEGE WITH, WE ARE ALSO
GETTING HANDWRITTEN INFORMATION
ABOUT BEACH WEEK, BACK TO BEACH
WEEK IN 1983.
I JUST WANT TO PUT THIS UP ON
THE SCREEN.
THIS IS A NOTE THAT PURPORTEDLY
HE WROTE, BRETT KAVANAUGH ROAD,
IT IS SIGNED BY "BARRED," I
DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A
NICKNAME, IT SAYS IT WAS --
INFORMING ALL OF HIS FRIENDS
ABOUT THE PLAN FOR BEACH WEEKEND
HE IS IS OUTLINING WHAT EVERYONE
NEEDS TO BRING, AND HE SAID
WE NEED
TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE WE
DON'T WANT TO GET KICKED OUT.
PS, IT WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD
IDEA ON SATURDAY THE 18TH TO
WARN THE NEIGHBORS THAT WE ARE
LOUD, OBNOXIOUS DRUNKS WITH
PROLIFIC PUKERS AMONG US."
IS THIS RELEVANT IN ANY WAY TO?
>> NORMALLY WE DRAW A LINE THESE
FBI INVESTIGATIONS AT THEIR 18TH
BIRTHDAY.
I THINK AT LEAST IN JUDICIAL
SELECTION, WHAT IS MOST RELEVAN
RELEVANT, AT LEAST IN THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, AND THE PEOPLE
WHO WERE REVIEWING THE
BACKGROUNDS OF CANDIDATES, WHAT
THEY DID AS AN ADULT AND HOW
THEY ACTED AS AN ADULT, WHAT
THEY HAVE GROWN AS A LAWYER, AND
IN THIS CASE, WHAT THEY HAVE
DONE AS    AS A JUDGE.
>> Martha: THERE IS A LOT OF
FOCUS OF PROVING HE IS A SLOPPY
DRUNK IS WHAT WE HAVE HEARD OF
THE LAST 24 HOURS.
IS THAT PART OF THE ORIGINAL
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WERE DONE
ON HIM, LOOKING INTO ALCOHOL
BEHAVIOR?
>> CERTAINLY, THAT IS A STANDARD
QUESTION AND EVERY BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATION.
