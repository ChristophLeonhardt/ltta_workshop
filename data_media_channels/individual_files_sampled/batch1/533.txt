after they put out their bins of recyclable rubbish most Australians think no more about it but this is just the start of a process which is facing a crisis in Australia trucks bring the mixed plastics paper glass and metal to a facility like this one to be separated until recently about half of the plastic and paper was then shipped to China Chinese companies were importing and processing nearly half the world's plastics and paper recycling but in January China's government in effect banned the import of recyclable waste it had allowed in bundles that were up to 10% contaminated meaning up to 1/10 of a bale of one type of recyclable plastic could in fact be non recyclable material Australian centers like this one had to do only a rough sift of the initial material plastic sight in itself is contamination you can see there's a bottle of water there it's made out of a PE tea material there and the cap is made out of a different material and you've got the label which is made out of a different material again so the label the cap from the neck would be regarded as contamination China now says only naught point 5 percent of each imported bundle can beat so-called contamination there isn't a plant in Australia that can produce the bundle that can pass that test even the operators of this new one in Townsville can't promise less than 8 percent contamination the business model is broken the supplies are constant but the demands have been wiped out by about half and yeah there is a real challenge to find a market for those recyclables in both the short term and the longer term some of the oversupply is being taken by Australian processors paying under half what they were for plastics are now taking away the bundles of paper waste for free but they can't take it all no one is admitting to stockpiling big mountains of plastic and paper or a fire risk creating them breaks laws but the excess has to go somewhere about 10% and everything that comes into this facility is waste that can't be recycled and it's bound up put in bales like those and that will go to landfill the concern now is that a lot more may end up in landfill those bales are 90% plastic that words have gone to China can't anymore those in the industry say long term this could be an opportunity for more sophisticated processing of recyclables within Australia but in the short term they say they need in effect a subsidy from government that means higher taxes to keep the bin collections going Andrew Thomas al Jazeera Sydney
