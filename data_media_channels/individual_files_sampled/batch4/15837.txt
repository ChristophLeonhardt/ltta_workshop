hi guys welcome to Declassified live oh we got a lot to talk about today we've got so much to go over most notable a lot of guys logging in guys people men and women how dare I assume your gender terrible of me terrible of me to do that all right got a lot to talk about that he most notably why the Special Counsel robert muller does not need an interview with President Donald Trump hmm any takers anybody want to guess why Muller doesn't need an interview with the president want to guess want to guess John Zeeland good morning my friend I know law of one my pronouns I shouldn't have said him I should say geez you're here Jim oh yeah oh yeah all right here's why Muller does not need an interview with President Trump we learned through leaks don't know who leaked it don't know if it was the White House trying to get in front of this thing don't know if it was Muller's team don't know if it was Don McGann the White House Counsel but it really doesn't matter cuz it bodes well for the president outer boroughs or burrows Knoll says because he has everything he needs from other sources exactly but I'm gonna go even deeper as to why he specifically doesn't need an interview with President Trump Don McGann the White House Council we now know sat with Muller as investigators for over 30 hours all right now a lot of people are saying well a lot of morons I don't know how this works are saying all the presidents cook these Donnie's tank McGann was in there he flipped 30 hours 30 hours is nothing for a debrief time again as the White House Counsel in the White House there's a crisis a second it's not a crisis an hour a crisis a minute there are hundreds of staffers all doing different things every second for the White House Counsel who's the chief attorney in the White House clearly obviously the guy who's tasked with making sure that every one of those decisions is legal is in compliance with the US federal law he knows a lot so thirty hours is really nothing for the special counsel to come in and get a full debrief from the White House Counsel but here's why it's even more important here's why it's even more important the White House Council is not Donald Trump's attorney he's not the president's attorney his job his mission is to make sure that the White House as an entity as a governmental operating entity operates legally and in a manner compliant with the United States Code in the Constitution so if the president acts in a manner that's illegal it's the White House counsel's job to advise the president not to do it and neither to then resign or blow the whistle if the president chooses to act illegally and Don McGann across the board the White House Counsel is considered a guy of utmost integrity he's not a trump guy he was a it was a bush guy it was actually an establishment Republican guy for a long time but Don Magan is still there he's integrally involved in selecting Supreme Court justices he works very closely with the President on on the appointments of gorsek worked on the appointments of gorsek and Kavanagh and so the the White House Counsel has seen no reason to leave the White House because he's seen nothing illegal that's not my opinion those are his words because we now know from the leaks and people in DC in the White House tell me these are pretty accurate that the White House Counsel repeatedly told the special counsels office that yeah the president rants and raves and he Huff's and puffs and it's an emotional place and a lots going on and that's common but he is never he being the president has never exceeded his legal authority and that's it the White House counsel's testimony is far more valuable than the president the White House counsel's job is very simple and also very very difficult and complex but in its simplest terms the president is presented with four options on how to do something whether it be a farm subsidy bill in Iowa or it be a drone strike in Afghanistan and the president's presented with some options and the White House counsel's job is to essentially say mr. president of those four options you could just option B that's illegal that one doesn't comport with the United States code the Constitution the Geneva Convention so that one is off the table that one's off the table of the other three they all appear to be legal in constitutional so give us your wish list that we're gonna vet them a little deeper and make sure it's all ironclad letter illegal in constitutional that's essentially the White House counsel's job right and so for the White House Council to go in and speak to Muller he has no allegiance except to the truth except to the law and so 30 hours with the White House Counsel repeatedly telling Muller's investigators the president never made any of these decisions without me present I was always there for the big decisions I was there for the firing of Comey mmm I was there for conversations about Jeff Sessions I was there for conversations about General Michael Flynn I was there when attorney general sessions was in the room and the president might have been angry president might have been emotional but the president never exceeded his legal authority that's it it's over even Andy McCarthy and National Review wrote a piece Andy McCarthy has been critical of the president when necessary but Andy McCarthy came right out and said it there is no reason no reason whatsoever Robert Muller his tie his articles entitled robert muller shouldn't even ask trump for an interview and he says that argument is bolstered by this weekend's new york times report that with the president's consent is what I was getting to so I wanted to read Andy's piece Don McGann didn't go in on his own the president told him to go speak to Muller the president waived all executive privilege the president waived all attorney-client privilege president said the McGann Don I've got nothing to hide go speak to mother and his team tell him everything hmm tell him everything Andy McCarthy one of the smartest attorneys out there on this road that argument is bolstered by this weekend's New York Times report that with the president's consent Muller's team has conducted 30 hours of interviews with white House Counsel Don began the second having secured testimony from the president's top lawyer the special counsel is in no position to claim that he needs the president's own testimony presidents consent to make began available the prosecutors is extraordinary as it involves less I just noted waiving both executive and attorney-client privileged and he says to the latter attorney guy employee client privilege there's really no waiver because McGann represents the presidency not the president but still but still McGann sees his role as protector of the presidency all right now the New York Times pushes the line claiming McGann viewed his role as protector of the presidency not and mr. Trump McCarthy right Corby's is that nonsense though because the president is really the client the office of the president the office of the president now we can go through the legal intricacies of this all day long we don't need to though the the meaning of it all the explanation is really really clear there is no reason for Muller to continue when the White House Counsel really answers turning to the Constitution the American people he represents the president he represents the president see he represents the White House but it really answers to the American people and to the Constitution when he's telling a special counsel no no laws are broken that's it it's time for Muller to do the right thing the right thing now of course all the naysayers then we're going into the matter for trial in a second because it's the same line of nonsense all the naysayers are saying well Donald Trump only you've made him again available because he wanted to get in front of this and appear transparent but he's really a criminal and he really is is done illegal things and he told him again what to say and Magan went in there and said it's all nonsense it's all nonsense it's stupid and it's ridiculous it's ridiculous and you know I'm what I'm gonna do guys is if you want to put up dumb trollee comments we have a new rule but I'm imposing right now dumb trollee comments or comments meant to disrupt I'm just banning you from the chat you can watch the show but I'm gonna ban you from the chat we don't feed trolls here never have never will so anyway you've got social mulher now has no legal ethical or moral authority no legal ethical or moral authority to ask Trump for anything the White House Council has spoken the president is under no obligation president is not suspected of a crime not charged with a crime collusion isn't a crime in the US code never happened I don't believe anybody colluded with Russia but even if so it's not a crime in the u.s. code not a crime in the u.s. code Muller is now investigating nothing Muller shouldn't even be prosecuting man afford I'm not saying not a fortunate man prosecuted if there was evidence to support the charges but it shouldn't have been by Muller I should not have been by robert muller robert Muller's job was to look into conspiracy collusion with russia so why isn't he looking into it where we know it exists Hillary Clinton paying fusion GPS hiding the money through her law firm Perkins koey so it didn't have to be disclosed with the Federal Election Commission fusion GPS paying Christopher Steele to them went in colluded with Russians to get damning information on Donald Trump that the FBI then lied about alongside the DOJ to secure a FISA warrant on quarter-page to spy on the Trump campaign we've got a clear trail of collusion that Robert Muller won't follow so Muller is not an ethical honest actor because he's not investigating the true Russia collusion and Cobra Commander says about Robert Muller millions of taxpayer dollars wasted on a fake investigation when richer has been uranium one deal make or whoa I don't know about it Richard Muller Muller could have made a lot more outside on a private sector but yeah we're up to about 25 million dollars now and a year and change wasted on this nonsense on this nonsense and so now with Meghan's testimony Muller needs to shut it all you want to go prosecute Russians that'll never see be inside of a courtroom have at it but no more taxpayer money hand those cases off to the respect of the United States attorneys whether they be in DC or New York or Virginia wherever hand it off hand it off and be done with this nonsense because the president's right it's a rigged witch-hunt the president's also right robert muller newt gingrich wrote a good piece on this as well yesterday i'm just not gonna take the time to dig it up where gingrich essentially says muller hurt himself muller could have appointed people to his team who donated to both Trump and Hillary Muller could have appointed people to his team who voted for both Trump and Hillary who exhibited bias for both Trump and Hillary but he didn't but he didn't robert muller limited he limited his biases to only be for hillary clinton robert muller made sure that the people on his team were only biased toward a democrat that reeks all right that is filthy nothing good about that nothing good about that Muller has been biased from day one in my opinion Muller's mandate has always been take down the sitting president take him out your the insurance policy Bob take them out and that's why guys like John Brennan are hysterical over their security clearances Oh give me a break Brennan's not gonna sue anybody cuz it's well within the authority of the President to pose security clearance regular rank and file people with security clearances don't get him for life so now with the Dan McGann testimony it puts Muller in a quandary now do I think that Mulder's investigation is gonna wrap up like Rudy Giuliani wants by September 1st no absolutely not absolutely not but the wind is out of Muller sales his credibility is shot I mean shocked and rightfully so Muller's credibility should have been shot Muller's credibility was was destroyed that really upon hiring and Peter struck now I don't believe for a second that Muller didn't know strikes bias I don't believe that for a New York minute all right I believe that Muller got rid of struck when Scott got caught I don't believe the Muller got rid of struck when because a man of integrity when he found out was try not I think he went to the people that he knew were gonna be loyal to him that he knew we're gonna be never Trump that he knew we're gonna hate this president and he and he sought them out and he used the ones and hired the ones that he knew would be most bias and it's so ridiculous it's so ridiculous for Peters truck to have said well my bias never played a role in this and I give you give me a break of course it did give me a break and so now you've got this matter for trial all right now look I don't know if Madoff or did what he did thousands and thousands of pages and 20 some-odd witnesses 50 14 days a testimony juries in day for 14 or 15 whatever it was juries in day four right now actually was like eleven days of testimony or twelve days of testimony juries in day four so I think we're at the 16 of the whole trial so it was like almost two weeks of testimony the what the jury is not coming back the way the prosecution wanted they're not coming back with this quick verdict now Panchito makes an interesting point very possible metaphor it's a hung jury and mistrial well here's the thing a lot of people are rushing there that assumption but I've sat through trials right I was a witness as a cop it seems that way however however let's be careful it could also be because the jury is being very thorough and deliberate in their deliberations so their call right so they're supposed to be deliberate and it could be that they're literally going page by page and thoroughly line by line through every document provided by the prosecution to every witness statement to the transcripts of the witness testimony that's one possibility the other possibility is you got a juror to just Muller's guts who doesn't believe Rick Gates who thinks Manta Ford is the victim of political persecution or or you could have 11 jurors that want to acquit mana for it and one who hates Matta Ford's guts and loves Hillary Clinton and and hates Donald Trump we really don't know is my point we really don't know now I will say this experience-wise haven't been that cop testified before juries grand juries juries pretrial hearings been through the process I I think I feel experience tells me it bodes better for the defense for manna for then for the prosecution that on Friday jurors came as late late Thursday early Friday jurors asked the judge to clarify the meaning of beyond a reasonable doubt again I say this with the caveat that we don't know but it seems to me seem Czech nationalists how are you man thanks for coming back today it seems to me that that bodes better for the defense than it does for the prosecution he also got to remember their hearing 18 counts against manna for the government has a prosecution rate on these crimes like ninety eight point nine percent and so a lot of stars would have to align for them to acquit manna for it fully I don't think that's gonna happen look anything can happen Allen he gets acquitted fully government presented a lot of evidence on 18 counts hung jury bunch of stars have to align unfortunately for manna for or if he's guilty fortunately for the government it seems the math works in favor of them finding him guilty on something in these 18 counts but then again there might be one juror that just feels this deck was stacked from the beginning and they're gonna hold out no matter what and hang the jury it's not an acquittal the government can reprosecution very well do that they probably will or the president could step in at that point and say I'm pardoning man afford on everything this is a nonsense it's a waste of taxpayer money Muller you didn't prove your case it's over go away go away now Ouroboros says Muller is nothing he's peddling processed crimes I agree trying to get Trump on perjury I agree I agree with you 100% I think Muller that's a different issue we agree 100% I'm talking up the amount of forgery let's go back to that's good point I believe Muller is nothing nothing and that's exactly why he jammed up general Flynn who's a friend of mine full disclosure gotta know the general he's a wonderful man his son Mike jr. has become a very good friend of mine we speak all the time I have dinner when I'm in DC these are good people he's a really good people the Flynn's what was done to the general is a disgrace and every time I speak to general Flynn he never once talks about himself he's never complained he's never played the victim the only thing general Flynn has ever said to me about the case I don't ask him about the case I don't overstep it's an open case I don't go there it's how are you general how you doing how's the family how's everything we talked about the state of the country and all he ever says is I just hate what this is doing to the nation all he ever says that's it it's all he cares about and I care about himself cares about his family and what this Muller investigation this witch-hunt is doing to the nation he's a good guy he's a really good guy and Muller I think now has really unless you're a far far left partisan goodwill is against him goodwill of the American people is against him now back to mana for so it matter for do these things I don't know there's a lot of evidence but wait what also might work in his favor is that the government looked at Mount affords case several times over the last 12 years and decided there was nothing to prosecute you don't think that's gonna weigh on the minds of the jury the jury is gonna say wait a second wait a second the DOJ and the FBI including when you were director of the FBI robert muller knew about all this and did nothing about it now you get appointed now you get appointed to do what a lot of people feel is takedown Trump and all of a sudden ten years later now these are prosecutable crimes you didn't go after him when you were director of the FBI but now you're going after Manta fort I'll tell you this if I were sitting on that jury that would put doubt in my mind that would put a lot of doubt in my mind I don't know if I'd be able to weigh the evidence against that doubt you know I mean that creates a lot of doubt a lot a lot of doubt so here in fact I don't have a triumph now I used to have one I don't have a triumph I get rid of all my bike excited trying about a Harley I had a BMW and my friends I was riding with stop riding I wasn't riding so I'm looking for a new bike looking at those three brands again don't know which one I'm gonna go for always had bikes a couple of years have been without one I've really missed it so uh you never know I might be on a triumph again or a BMW or a Harley I don't know but I'll let you know when I know but uh let's see what Zack is saying Zack is one of my favorites he comes on here he's young he's in school he gets beaten up for being a conservative but he fights the good fight there in Australia funny story my school at a student leader come up and talk today in an assembly and she went up and discussed the one in five rape stat the wage gap in the rest of the rape culture issues and I'm guessing you push back on her Zack and the Liberals lost their minds on you yeah I'm guessing that's what happened my friend well anyway back to matter for it then we'll go to your questions comments your questions your comments your show ideas no listen it's uh it I I would not be shocked to play this was any other defendant two courtrooms two different districts 25 counts I'd say he's toast he's done now I will say this he's not gonna get the fair shake in judge Amy Berkman Jack Jackson's courtroom in DC that he's going to get in Virginia he's certainly not gonna get that fair shake it's not gonna happen alright at all he's not judge Ellis is much more fair let's talk about the judge let's talk about what CNN wanted to do CNN went nuts because they couldn't get the names of the jurors made public the judge was receiving death threats now why would CNN want to do that why would they want to do that well I'm not gonna ready to make the leap and say that CNN wanted to see jurors intimidated alright but a little weird for CNN and want the names of jurors in the middle of deliberations during an ongoing trial it's a little odd the judge said no the judge is under his own US Marshal Service protective detail now that happens that typically happens in drug cartel cases or organized crime cases or terror cases when the judge is at risk not non-violent twelve-year-old tax evasion cases with a guy who's got no ties I think it's not only metaphor it was laundering money for the Sinaloa cartel alright it's a guy who liked to buy expensive ostrich skin Gucci jackets I mean he's hardly a thug you know what I mean so sequestration of the jury wouldn't have typically been necessary CNN wanted their names why one of Montgomery says Matta Ford is in solitary confinement yeah because he tried they claimed to tamper with witnesses but that was from the DC judge Jackson she put him in solitary she is a very public far-left partisan he's screwed in her courtroom he is absolutely screwed in her courtroom so in many respects it's good this trial happen first because if this is a hung jury or long long shot and acquittal it on that's gonna happen a hung jury president might just step in and say he's never gonna get a fair shake in that courtroom pardon him now I don't think Trump is gonna pardon him before the midterms I think that would raise too much of a political fight it would be actually politically imprudent really politically stupid for Trump Department before the midterms it's a fight you don't want mm-hmm to fight you don't want but uh I think I I think that if he if there's a hung jury on this on this one pardon becomes much more likely much more likely observer dude donate aid five pounds thanks observer dude do I think there's any truth to the gender pay gap even if it's true it's a pay gap between how many genders men and women so there's two genders your second point yeah there are two genders do I think there's a gender pay gap honestly I do I know that's not the popular conservative opinion I know it's not what I think in many companies there is it still exists is it getting better yes but is there yeah I see it in a lot of industries I've worked in I do see that that a guy with the same resume as a woman coming in does tend to command a little more money all right it's not this massive widespread problem I don't think it requires activism but there's a lot of reasons for that and it could very well be that men just I'm gonna get flamed for this negotiate harder a guy comes in and he says nope you want offer me that I'm not taking it I'm here I'm on my fourth interview I'm valuable to you I know it you know it and he gets in the face and he says this is what I want I'm sticking to this number somebody out there willing to pay me and that's what I've seen so I think there's a gap I do do I think it's because of innate bigotry and bias no in my experience men have pushed much harder for the money although I've seen some women who are sharks who have pushed very hard for money as well but I'm talking about across the board my experience I've watched guys come in and harass companies for that money that's all I'm saying it's all I'm saying it's situational though I had a salesperson when I was in the private sector who worked for us a woman who was relentlessly she was relentless so it's unique to the individual as well it's it's um you know but somebody made a good point sound makes you said the pay gap mostly exists in Hollywood we have both a little liberal Hollywood they're the ones screw in women out of money the most right but I think there are a lot of factors none of these things exist in this abstract vacuum of yeah there's a pay gap yet it's not you got to look at each micro situation let's go to some of your comments here all right we need a special counsel when this fake investigation ends but I don't care about Muller and uranium one I'll tell you why if Obama the president has time to set him over there then he set him over there old news we're never gonna win that nobody cares about uranium 1 anymore maybe they should they don't they don't it's old news not gonna waste political and prosecutorial capital on that Muller needs to be investigated for what he's doing today for this witch hunt today can't go back to 2010-2011 the public will roll their eyes be infuriated and it'll cost Trump a second term that's what will happen that's what will happen so you got to go to what's going on today and what's going on today I knew my pay gap speculation I knew my pay gap comments would drive people nuts but look it is what it is you also got to remember something and again you might blame me for this I do a TV show in the afternoon and I think we take live coal as much like this and I hear comments from all sides and we talked about this issue and if you're an employer you've got a male employee and a female employee and a female employee says yeah I'm planning on having a family you're gonna lose me for two months are you gonna be willing to pay her as much as the male employee it's not an affront to women but if I'm gonna lose a key executive for two months while she has a baby is she entitled to the same amount of money as the male employee who I'm not gonna lose for two months to me that's just a free market that's just capitalism I don't know now I know the Liberals are oh it's terrible it's terrible it's terrible it's sexist it's sexist misogynistic is it I'm losing two months of productivity I'm losing two months of customer service I'm losing two months of client relations I'm losing two months of sales so would it be inconceivable for an employer to take that into account when deciding salary saying there's a lot of factors that but a lot of factors that go into these decisions now DJ foster makes a good point problem there is if women didn't have children where would future workers come from great point really good point excellent point like I said a lot of debate on this issue but I do think from personal experience and I'm stepping into a hornet's nest here I know it I've just watched men push harder for the money to get that extra extra couple of bucks out of a potential employer check nationalist thank you very much let's see what else we got what else do we what have you got here Wow a lot of comments lot of comments lot on Muller hmm lot on Muller lot on capitalism is racist somebody said with a smiley face have you guys seen those images of what things cost in Venezuela it's like a billion Venezuelan whatever they're called for a chicken I mean it is in sane it is insane let's say wow I really start I really start up a hornet's nest with that gender pay gap stuff huh Louie people are not gonna be happy with Cardillo today they are not mmm Sean Whitfield I'm not Ezra so Ezra pronounces his name LaVon I am NOT Ezra though so I'm John Gardella Ezra is the founder of the rebels CEO he's got another show here on YouTube a book my glasses though both of dark hair so yeah El Dorado says we don't like liberal talking points lmao neither do i president canning is wrong saying everything that mainstream media is telling you about Venezuela is a lie the u.s. wants to go in there for the oil that's absolutely wrong I'm in South Florida have a lot of it as well and friends their families were well-off they were doing very well I had one friend his family was doing incredibly well parents had to now come here and live with him they lost everything they worked 40 years they were very successful financial professionals had a very successful import-export business they lost everything Venezuela is Hell right now your comment is absolutely absolutely wrong animals are suffering people are eating their pets it is a terrible terrible situation Hugo Chavez's daughter though is a billionaire she's the wealthiest woman in Venezuela because they pillaged the oil resources pillaged it Venezuela is a mess look Trump isn't trying to nation-build I think that as well as one place we shouldn't send in troops stabilize the situation and take the oil yeah Jean as we love you you can have your own ideas well thank you jean-marie Hey look I'm just trying to make it in your world I'm just a squirrel looking for a nut listen everybody should be able to have their own ideas without without being jammed up robert muldoon says i'm a liar venezuela is a CIA operation created by the US for the oil well that's just silly since the u.s. is going to be the largest net exporter of oil by 2023 using our own resources we're not even going after Venezuela soil we don't even have troops in Venezuela mmm you guys got to stop listening to loony conspiracy theorists don't listen to him they lie to you by the way cue is about to be outed and debunked somebody I know somebody you all follow on Twitter I won't say who good friend of mine somebody alike tells me they have Q's identity and it's all a scam all right Oh burrows know some good comments from over us today they know what they're talking about they're doing the homework Strock dr2 302s committed perjury said he had no input on the Pfizer request he conspired to corrupt Lee influence FISA Court judge Contreras obstructed Hillary investigation let me say this we don't have proof of any of that but I strongly suspect you're correct about much if not all of it I really strongly suspect you're correct in fact we know that the Inspector General is running an investigation as to whether or not he doctored those 302s I believe they gave a little snippet of what they had over to christopher ray and dave Bowditch Bowditch the new number two at the FBI hmm and that's what led to stocks firing I don't believe it was solely about the text messages Wow everybody believes these conspiracies that Venezuela is a beautiful country in great shape yeah no no it's really not and smirk but we did Brennen security clearance it should have been pulled generally it's not general Raven it's Admiral McRaven look he's entitled to his opinion he's an American Hero I really disagree with him Adam abnormal cravings and Obama guy's a friend of Brennan I totally disagree with him and the other ones they want their clearances pulled it's on them Brennan's a bad bad guy a partisan political hack he's a bad guy he was terrible at CIA q is fake my friend is not a rhino in fact when you all see who is debunking Q it's somebody you are all a very big fan of somebody you all follow and trust you're going to be very surprised you are going to be very very surprised when you see who's debunking this guy trust me when I tell you you're gonna be very very surprised something else that happened I don't have you saw this but Donald Trump mm and uh ambassador Rick Rennell our ambassador to Germany Ric happens to be a good friend of mine really really good guy he's openly gay Rick he's the highest-ranking gay official in the US government well they debunked every narrative of the left Donald Trump and Rick Grinnell together worked to having Nazi war criminal a guarded concentration camps to port it to Germany for prosecution and the best part was there were federal agents of color doing the apprehension and escort so Donald Trump a guy called a racist anti-gay Nazi Donald Trump and is openly gay ambassador to Germany having Nazi deported to be criminally prosecuted and used federal agents of color to grab the guy up and put him on the plane thereby debunking every left-wing attack line on Donald Trump it's really glorious it's absolutely glorious the left can't get out of their own way the left cannot get out of their own way yeah a lot of people hear that a lot of people here are believing what I'm saying about Venezuela look all you got to do is come down Florida talked some people situation is bad is bad I'm meeting the people that come back over or are lucky enough people to get out of it as well and come here because they had some money in the states with their relatives it is dire you are watching a country Venezuela was prosperous it was rich when I first moved down to South Florida in 2000 for Venezuelans coming over here we're loaded they were buying Ferraris by the pair a hardtop and a convertible what has happened in Venezuela is is just devastating and everybody everybody should learn a lesson from it in terms of socialism everybody let's see uh Gus foreseen talking about Julian Assange and set rich being the DNC leak I believe Seth rich was the DNC leak I believe there's evidence that he might have been killed for it I don't believe it was an orchestrated conspiracy of federal agents killing said the rat nything was something much more common in crime another staffer might have been upset that he did it they got into a fight and rich got shot it let me tell you professional assassins don't leave a trail like this okay alright i arrested murderers they don't leave a trail like this i think at the end of the day it's going to be much more that murders ever solve it's going to be much less conspiratorial intriguing and exciting it's gonna be more of a more about you know just a heated argument gone wrong and that's really a lot of murders go down people are asking me what are on the planes from Little Rock I have no idea what you're talking about I don't know the Clintons people the point ins don't want to talk I don't know mmm yeah either this cue thing has really gotten has really gotten ridiculous really really gotten silly and I'm so glad that reputable conservatives are now finally moving debunked this stupidity this idiocy it really it really did a tremendous tremendous disservice to everything we were trying to do to get the truth out there it really did and you know I I've always despised these conspiracy theories and I've been flamed for it as a conservative media guy I've been told oh you're blue-billed and you're not Woking you're this oh my god you're a RINO you're a shill you're a shill of the establishment you're owned by the Rothschilds and Bilderberg at me a break give me a break I followed the evidentiary trail I'd follow the facts I don't some random anonymous thing pops up on the Internet no I don't read it as as in fact all right I want evidence I want hard facts and evidence hard facts Shaun Wingfield says something that's very true social is government's despite how they present themselves are always dictatorships yeah they are right because they control the means of production even if partially they control your healthcare they control your media when they can ration things they can control things when they can censor things they can control things Oh God planes from DOJ going a little run give me a break planes from DOJ how do they know they're planes from the oj that the Department of Justice doesn't have a runway out front you guys got to start doing a little homework on this stuff there are our issues that happen around the country if a plane is registered to the Department of Justice and it lands in a Little Rock Arkansas it doesn't mean that they're going to get hide docks for the Clintons no no it could simply mean that that a DOJ prosecutor was needed on a drug case down there or in a bank robbery case down there you guys got to stop believing the conspiracy theory the Clintons haven't lived in Little Rock Arkansas for decades I'm gonna be ties there anymore they got out of there in the minute they hit the White House in 93 yeah I mean Sean Wingfield goes to those DOJ planes also ten trailing do it exactly exactly yeah I mean you know they're a major drug cases out that's right there are not 40,000 sealed indictments about the Muellers gonna drop on him now many of those things aren't even see aren't even indictments one day I'll teach you guys how to use pacer which is the federal court system search those of us who have worked at investigations who understand all that stuff works we laugh at this we laugh at this many of those things are like sealed transcripts and drug kit they don't even know what they're looking at it's kind of sad actually it's kind of sad it really is forty thousand sealed indictment and you would think by listening to these people that there's no other crime in the u.s. is over the crack forty thousand seals it's so stupid nobody even thinks that maybe some of those crimes are drug cases anti-terror cases other federal crimes white collar cases weapons trafficking cases La Cosa Nostra biker gangs Asian get me we have other federal crime so if there are forty thousand sealed anything on the federal docket it's because we're prosecuting other crimes I mean nobody thinks to like look past one conspiracy theory on the web none let's say cobra commander yeah the forty thousand sealed indictments ridiculous look I looked into that many of those things aren't even indictments they're just filings with the court under seal testimony of maybe things like an undercover agent testifies that's under seal or a protected witness testifies the filing is under seal people don't know what they're looking at that's why I laugh at this cue nonsense the morons behind that account don't even understand how it all works they don't understand it's just it's just silly silly like really really ridiculous let's see why would two government airline or any other airliners and not little Lear Jets I mean what I'm trying to say do your own homework do your own homework a tail number on a jet can tell you what kind of jet it is if you go input will you type in the end number on the back of the jet it'll tell you what if every little citation or a Lear or a smaller Gulfstream one of those let's see uh yeah fortune frontin games exactly let's see what else what do i what do

whole bunch Sean Wingfield says I know you don't talk about Tommy but could you give us an insight on what solace air he does to him in I don't I don't uh now talk about Tommy Robinson only because Ezra's doing a really great job with it he has far more info than I do on it real-time info he's very friendly with Tommy they speak look it depends on the person with solitary confinement I had a couple of defendants that were placed there some people are real tough they handle it well others are breaks them it really depends on the individual you know I don't know let's see Preston canning says I really like the rebel when I hear you talk it kind of frustrated me with the nonsense I'm spewing well if you like conspiracy theories without any truth behind them or facts to back them up then yeah I'm gonna frustrate them up then yeah I'm gonna frustrate you you're not gonna like me you're probably not gonna want to watch me you're probably not Douglas Gillespie says Trump is spelled wrong on my shirt yeah I spell it like Al Sharpton spells respect did you guys see this al Sharpton was trying to make fun of Trump saying he should respect Omarosa and Al Sharpton you know it tying him to read the Franklin and her death and Al Sharpton's felt respect RESP ICT on MSNBC guys you asked me for news on info war they have no idea I don't watch Alex Jones I listen I will vehemently defend Alex Jones his right to speak and to spew his nonsense I don't watch him i don't watch him after his Sandy Hook and 9/11 conspiracy theories I don't pay attention to the guy I lost friends in 9/11 I don't listen to anybody who comes up with that Alex Jones is for you too much nonsense over the years for a buck not a fan so I I he's you know as far as I know they've still got him banned I would fight night and day night and day to have his accounts restored as I believe in free speech night and day that said I just don't pay the guy any attention does the new satanic statue at Little Rock Capitol deserve to be there more than the previous Ten Commandments monument that the Arkansas Satan is destroyed adversary American says no look neither one does or both do problem is that Satanism is a recognized religion we could debate all day whether it should be or not but it is and it does have First Amendment protections all right and if you claim to be a civil libertarian then you got to take the reprehensible with the good now that statue is disturbing and it's chilling and it's reprehensible and I don't like it but they are invoking First Amendment protections and they've got them as reprehensible as it may be as reprehensible as it may be President canning ms-13 bloods Crips as other gangs and just motorcycle yeah of course there are yeah yeah I mean nobody's denying that there there are hundreds of them the Gangster Disciples in Chicago the Latin Kings the anti we can go day long with this you know I was just making a point let's see what else we got here where are the feminists I don't know hopefully being quiet he's a Reetha franklin dead you never were a disc no read the Franklin was the Queen of Soul yes she passed away 76 years old she read the Franklin wasn't disc oh my god that's blasphemy no no no no no no no no a tank says music on the radio is brainwashing I don't know about that I don't know about that captain's Burke says any thoughts about the 17 year old shut electronic ballot boxes recently hacked kid was actually 11 there were 17 competitors um yeah I'm not too worried about that the environment they claimed mirrored Florida when you dig into it really didn't mirror Florida's electronic voting environment there were significant differences so I'm not too worried that this is gonna impact anything cobra commander says Satanism has never been recognized nor hasn't ever been tax-exempt that's absolutely untrue in fact if you go to the Department of Defense guidelines on burials they recognize Satanism as a religion and a service member who practices Satanism is entitled to be buried in accordance with their guidelines so you're factually sorry Kohlberg you're dead wrong on that one it actually is recognized whether it should be or not all another debate but it is what it is adversary American says you make a great point Satanist ironically call it a separation between church and state though the Church of Satan is a religion by definition well exactly exactly there should be removed as well exactly it should be out of there sound mixer the devil is evil and everything to do with it is evil yeah that's that's the understatement of the year sound mixer yeah are they Abraham Lincoln's Ronnie Ronnie yes how the hells angels our religion to them they are Oh Preston Kenny says I'm a transparent puppet for the left man it's obvious yes you got my number I'm a big lefty I'm a big lefty look they're gonna be out of here in about nine minutes again you have a late breakfast with my uncle George Soros uncle George

believe it and the Church of Satan you guys keep saying they're not tax-exempt and I keep telling you you're wrong so here I'm putting up a link for you that shows that the IRS did in fact grant them tax-exempt status it's right there I just posted it they're a recognized religion with tax-exempt status reprehensible chilling but First Amendment protected so there you go Cobra Commander they are a tax-exempt uh I love it I'm a show for the left this is awesome I didn't know that I did not know that I did not get my check from uncle George Soros Hillary hasn't paid me can't believe it but listen I I want to bring you guys my goal is to bring you guys facts and data and stats I don't I'm not gonna deal with conspiracy theories I just don't deal with that stuff I'd never have I never will it's not my thing I yeah they're they're fun and they're you know I get it there sensational keep dropping my pen want to stay in my hand today it's really annoying you guys had me so fired up with all this stuff alright UFOs do more shows about UFOs I might just do that do you see we have a candidate we have a candidate for Congress down here in Florida's 27th congressional district on the Republican side so the Republican primary primaries in Florida are Tuesday week from today right and we have a a candidate here running as a Republican replacing Ileana Ross late and a Republican congresswoman down in Miami and let me see if I can find this it's really funny this particular woman who was endorsed by the Miami Herald I'm gonna read you her story right now Miami Herald endorsed her her name is Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera now I know a lot of people who were back in her because she has some conservative positions well she claims aliens took her aboard a spaceship she really does here's her quote quote I went in there was some round seats that were there and some quartz rocks that control the ship not like airplanes she said she was visited by three large blond beings yeah so we have a bona fide congressional candidate she's probably gonna win the GOP nomination for Congress in Florida's 27th congressional district and she believes she was abducted by aliens let's see the Church of Satan sponsored that Club Cobra Commander the Church of Satan also put out a statement that they were granted tax-exempt status but rejected it because they didn't want the entanglements that come with being a 501c3 you got to do your research on this do your research on this all right Oh magpie I don't I don't change who I am Alice there has me what I eat for breakfast yeah it depends it depends mr. Dhanbad says I'm one chill she'll listen I might do high weights as big fan of the channel thanks man Doug Gillespie says she was a back so this candidate Matina whatever name is says she was visited by large blonde beings and who said the ex I want to give proper credit Doug Gillespie said she was abducted by Fabio yes yes yes that is actually pretty funny shooter the Fox says the question that relates to the satanism thing is Islam recognized in the same way as long as a religion in the u.s. legitimate religion but I suggest you guys look into the church Satan it's and the way the government is treated them they've been treated as a religion now whether or not they have given up their tax-exempt status is on them because a lot of bells and whistle of strings come with 501 C 3 tax exempt status but they were they were offered it and they rejected it they the government sees them as a church no show you know I this woman says she was visited by three blond beings I think she was abducted by Hansen that group from the 80s all right all right guys if this hour flew by it flew by a lot of fun I would be back here with you tomorrow morning 7:30 a.m. thank you so much for watching I'll see you guys tomorrow
