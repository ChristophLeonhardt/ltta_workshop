AGREEMENT WE HAD BEFORE, NAFTA, 
HOW THIS WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT 
AMERICANS?
>> THIS IS A BIG WIN FOR THE 
PRESIDENT, ONE OF HIS SIGNATURE 
CAMPAIGN PROMISES, EASILY ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST APPLAUSE LINES 
IS WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT NAFTA, 
AND THAT IT IS QUOTE, ONE OF 
THE WORST DEALS ARE MADE. 
THERE WILL BE TOUTING THIS IS 
GREAT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND 
CREATE SOLID MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS, 
BUT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THIS WILL 
DIRECTLY IMPACT AMERICANS, MANY 
PROVISIONS DON'T GO INTO EFFECT 
UNTIL 2020, LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
AT TWO ASPECTS, HOW IT DEALS 
WITH CARS AND DAILY PRODUCTS, 
WHEN IT COMES TO AUTOMOBILE 
MANUFACTURING, THE GOAL IS TO 
HAVE MORE TRUCK AND CAR PARTS 
MANUFACTURED IN NORTH AMERICA, 
IN FACT THIS NEW DEAL SAYS THAT 
IN ORDER TO AVOID A TARIFF, THE 
CAR OR TRUCK MUST HAVE 75% OF 
THE COMPONENTS MANUFACTURED IN 
CANADA, MEXICO OR U.S., THAT IS 
OVER AND IT -- AN 10% INCREASE. 
AND THE SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE 
OF THE WORK MUST BE DONE WITH A 
MINIMUM WAGE OF $16 PER HOUR. 
SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT 
WHILE THIS MAY HELP NORTH 
COMERICA -- NORTH AMERICA, FOR 
SMALLER AUTOMOBILES, THEY MAY 
BE HARDER TO MANUFACTURE THAN 
HERE, SOME OF THAT WORK COULD 
GO TO CHINA, OTHER PARTS ARE 
DAIRY PRODUCTS, THE PRESIDENT 
HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW HE 
BELIEVES THAT CANADA'S DAIRY 
MARKET IS UNFAIR TO U.S. DAIRY 
PRODUCERS, AND NOW THEY WILL 
HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO CANADA'S 
DAIRY MARKET.
>> WE KNOW THE US-MEXICO 
REACHED A DEAL WEEKS AGO, WHAT 
FINALLY MADE CANADA JUMP ON 
BOARD?
>> THERE WAS A SELF-IMPOSED 
DEADLINE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT 
IS A SELF-IMPOSED DEADLINE, AS 
I SAID, THIS WAS ONE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN 
PROMISES, THE THREE COUNTRIES 
STARTED NEGOTIATING OVER YEAR 
AGO, BUT AND MADE IT SORT OF 
HIT A SNAG BETWEEN THE U.S. AND 
CANADA, CANADA KIND OF STEPPED 
TO THE SIDE, WHILE THE MEXICO 
AND U.S. CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE 
AND WERE ABLE TO COME TO A 
TENTATIVE DEAL, THE PRESIDENT 
MADE IT CLEAR, HE WAS WILLING 
TO MOVE FORWARD EVEN WITHOUT 
CANADA, THE REMAINING STICKING 
POINT WAS THE DAIRY TERMS, THE 
DAIRY MARKET, IN ORDER TO 
COMPETE WITH CANADA ON THAT 
ISSUE, SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 
MENTIONS ALMOST EVERY WEEK. 
THEY WERE ABLE TO COME TO A 
TENTATIVE DEAL, BUT SOME MARKET 
ANALYSTS HAVE QUESTIONED IF IT 
IS ALL WORTH IT, CANADA IS ONE 
OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, AND THEY 
QUESTION WHETHER HIS HARDBALL 
TACTICS HAVE WORKED TO DELIVER 
ON A SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN PROMISE,
OR IF THIS HAS DAMAGED OUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF OUR 
CLOSEST ALLIES, AS THIS MARKET 
ANALYST PUT IT, FOR A FEW 
GALLONS OF MILK. 
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK 
ABOUT WHETHER NAFTA COULD BE 
RIPPED UP OR IGNORED, THAT YOU 
COULDN'T JUST PRISON -- PRETEND 
IT DIDN'T EXIST, IT WAS A LEGAL 
DOCUMENT, WITH THIS NEW TRADE 
DEAL, WHAT SORT OF HURDLES WILL 
BE FACING? 
>> ALL THREE COUNTRIES HAVE TO 
RATIFY IT, AND SIGN IT, AND IN 
THE U.S., THAT'S NOT EVEN GOING 
TO HAPPEN UNTIL LATE NOVEMBER, 
AND THIS WILL GO TO CONGRESS, 
BUT IF THE DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK 
THE HOUSE, IT COULD BE 
DIFFICULT POTENTIALLY TO GET 
THIS VERSION RATIFIED, THE 
DEMOCRATS COULD RALLY AND 
DEMAND ADDITIONAL CHANGES, AND 
CANADA AND MEXICO COULD FACE 
CHALLENGES AS WELL. 
A LONG WAY FOR THIS TO BE 
FINALIZED, AND RATIFIED, BUT 
JUST IN TERMS OF GETTING ALL 
THREE COUNTRIES TO THE TABLE TO 
AGREE ON SOMETHING, I BELIEVE 
THAT IS A WIN FOR THE PRESIDENT,
GO TO THE RALLIES, THE 
SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE WHO VOTED 
FOR HIM, OF ALL THE ISSUES HE 
RAISES, NAFTA IS ONE OF THE ONES
THAT SEEMS TO BE MOST IMPORTANT 
FOR PEOPLE, AND ABOUT WHICH 
THEY ARE MOST PASSIONATE. 
>> INDEED,PAULA, THOSE 
RALLIES, EVEN TODAY, THE 
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT HOW 
NAFTA WAS THE WORST DEAL THAT 
THE WAS EVER SIGNED, BUT THE 
CHALLENGES, THE DEMOCRATS TAKE 
CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, ALSO THIS 
IS BEING DONE AS MEXICO'S 
PRESIDENT IS LEAVING OFFICE, 
AND THE CANADIAN PARLIAMENT HAS 
TO RATIFY THIS, A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED, A BIG 
DAY FOR THE PRESIDENT. 
THANK YOU.>>> THE FBI IS NOW 
INVESTIGATING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
CLAIMS AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
WHICH HAS STALLED HIS 
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT.
HOW ARE VOTERS DECIDED -- 
DIVIDED? 
35% OF PEOPLE SUPPORT HIS 
NOMINATION, WHILE 37% ONE 
SENATORS TO VOTE AGAINST THEM, 
28% BELIEVE IT IS TOO SOON TO 
SAY.>> RACHEL MITRA, -- RACHEL 
MITCHELL, THE WOMAN THAT WAS 
ASKED BY REPUBLICAN SENATORS, 
CITY HE SAID AND SHE SAID IS 
DIFFICULT. 
WITH THIS CASE IS WEAKER THAN 
THAT.
>> Reporter: AMY KLOBUCHAR SAID 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS DECIDED TO 
PROTECT BRETT KAVANAUGH BY 
ORDERING A NARROW 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> THEY CAN'T SAY OH HEY, ONLY 
INTERVIEW THE PEOPLE IN THEIR 
NEIGHBORHOOD ON ONE SIDE OF THE 
STREET.
>> Reporter: THEY WILL NOT 
INVESTIGATE JULIE SWETT NICK, 
WHERE SHE CLAIMED THAT WOMEN 
WERE GIVEN ALCOHOL AND SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED THE PARTIES. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH CALLED HER 
ALLEGATIONS TOTAL BS, SHE IS 
LYING, HE SAID.
>> IS A JOKE, A FARCE.
>> Reporter: THEY ASKED ABOUT 
HIS DRINKING HABITS IN COLLEGE. 
THE FBI MIGHT INVESTIGATE THAT.
>> I DID NOT DRINK BEER TO THE 
POINT OF BLACKING OUT. 
>> Reporter: A FRIEND SAID THAT 
KAVANAUGH TRIED TO DECEIVE THE 
SENATE BY DOWNPLAYING HIS 
DRINKING HABITS, ON MULTIPLE 
OCCASIONS HE SAW HIM STAGGERING 
FROM ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, WHEN 
BRETT GOT DRUNK HE WAS OFTEN 
AGGRESSIVE, AND HE ADDED THAT 
HE WOULD TAKE THE FBI -- THE 
INFORMATION TO THE FBI. 
>> THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY 
HAVE TO DO.>> Reporter: LAWYERS 
FOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD SAID 
SHE HAS NOT HEARD FROM THE FBI, 
BUT THEY DIDN'T INVESTIGATE 
ANOTHER FRIEND WHO SAID THAT 
DURING THE 80s, -- ANOTHER 
ACCUSER, SAYING THAT HE THRUST 
HIS PIANIST IN HER FACE WITHOUT 
HER CONSENT.>>> FORMER 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE FBI, 
WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU, RON, 
THE FBI IS IN THE MIDST OF THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
ALLEGATIONS, AGAINST JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF THE 
AGENCY, WILL THEY BE LOOKING 
FOR? 
>> FIRST, IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
KNOW THAT THIS IS NEITHER AN 
FBI LED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, 
THAT TAKES ITS NATURAL PATH, OR 
A NATIONAL SECURITY 
INVESTIGATION THAT WOULD DO THE 
SAME, THIS IS REALLY THE FBI 
WORKING IN A SUPPORT ROLE FOR 
THE WHITE HOUSE, ALMOST AS A 
CONTRACTOR FOR A CLIENT. 
THE CLIENT GETS TO DEFINE THE 
OVERALL TERMS OF THE 
ENGAGEMENT, SO WE DON'T KNOW 
TODAY EXACTLY WHAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE TESTING LOOKS LIKE, HOW 
MUCH LATITUDE THEY HAVE TO 
PURSUE ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS 
BASED ON THE LIST OF INTERVIEWS 
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN, BUT 
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS TRY 
TO ENGAGE IN KNOWN WITNESSES, 
AND POTENTIALLY WITNESSES THAT 
ARE UNKNOWN TO US, AND ASK 
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT 
RELATE TO HIS SUITABILITY FOR 
HIS -- THIS IMPORTANT POSITION, 
ALCOHOL ABUSE, WHETHER OTHER 
PEOPLE WERE WITNESSES TO A 
PARTICULAR ALLEGED ENCOUNTER, 
ALL OF THAT I THINK IS ON THE 
TABLE. 
IT IS CIRCUMSCRIBED BY WHAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE IS ASKING OF THE 
FBI. 
>> RON, AS YOU KNOW, THE WHITE 
HOUSE INSISTS IT IS NOT 
MICROMANAGING THE 
INVESTIGATION, SOME LAWMAKERS 
CLAIMS THAT THEY ARE KEEPING 
THEM FROM INTERVIEWING SOME 
WITNESSES, I WANT TO READ AN OP-
ED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES FROM 
JAMES COMEY, ALTHOUGH THE 
PROCESS IS DEEPLY FLAWED, AND 
DESIGNED TO THWART THE FACT 
GATHERING PROCESS, THE FBI IS 
UP FOR THIS, IT IS NOT AS HARD 
AS SOME SENATORS HOPE IT WILL 
BE, FBI AGENTS KNOW THAT TIME 
HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH MEMORY, 
EVERY MARRIED PERSON REMEMBERS 
THE WEATHER ON THEIR WEDDING 
DAY, NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO, 
AND LITTLE LIES POINT TO BIGGER 
LIES, OBVIOUS LIES ABOUT THE 
NOMINEE ABOUT THE MEANING OF 
WORDS IN A YEARBOOK OR A 
FLASHING SIGNAL TO DIG DEEPER. 
IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF 
HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?>> THE 
INVESTIGATORS ARE ABLE TO TEST 
WITNESS COMMENTS, WITNESS 
STATEMENTS, WITNESS 
RECOLLECTIONS, IDEALLY WITH 
CONTRARY OR OTHER EVIDENCE THAT 
THEY MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO. 
SO THEY'RE LOOKING TO PUT 
TOGETHER A COMPOSITE PICTURE TO 
SEE WHOSE INFORMATION ADDS TO 
SOMETHING OF AN ENCOUNTER, OR 
TAKES AWAY FROM IT, BUT AT THE 
END, THE FBI IS NOT HERE TO 
REACH CONCLUSIONS, THEY ARE 
HERE TO AS THOSE HARD QUESTIONS 
OF COOPERATIVE WITNESSES, THEY 
DON'T HAVE COMPULSORY PROCESS, 
THE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ISSUING 
SUBPOENAS -- THEY ARE NOT GOING 
TO BE ISSUING SUBPOENAS, IF 
ÃºTH 
WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU 
ABOUT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, 
IT'S EASY FOR A POTENTIAL 
WITNESS TO SAY I HAVE NOTHING 
TO SAY, I'VE SEEN HOW THIS IS 
PLAYING OUT ON TV, I DON'T WANT 
TO BE PART OF IT, AND THE FBI 
WILL WALK AWAY ABSENT SOME 
OTHER CALL BECAUSE PRESSURE WAS 
BROUGHT IN SOME OTHER WAY. 
THEY WILL APPEAR AS A FACTFINDER
TO PRESENT THAT BACK TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE, WHO WOULD 
PRESUMABLY PRESENTED TO THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND 
LET THEM DETERMINE HOW DOES 
THIS MOVE THE NEEDLE IN ANY 
PARTICULAR WAY. 
THE FBI IS CERTAINLY UP TO THE 
TASK. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SPENT LITTLE 
TIME PUSHING BACK AGAINST THOSE 
CRITICIZING THE INVESTIGATION, 
JUST STARTING TO HEAR THE 
DEMOCRATS, ONLY THINKING 
OBSTRUCT AND DELAY, AND PUTTING 
OUT THE WORD THAT THE TIME AND 
SCOPE OF FBI LOOKING INTO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND WITNESSES IS NOT 
ENOUGH. 
HELLO, FOR THEM, IT WILL NEVER 
BE ENOUGH. 
AND VLADIMIR DUTHIERS POINTED 
OUT, JAMES COMEY SAID IN THE OP-
ED, BEFORE  HE TALKED ABOUT HOW 
SKILLED FBI AGENTS ARE, HE SAYS 
IF TRUTH WERE THE ONLY GOAL, 
THERE WOULD BE NO CLOCK, AND 
THE INVESTIGATION WOULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN SOUGHT AFTER THEY ARE 
INDOORS THE NOMINEE. 
THE QUESTION IS, WITH ONLY A 
WEEK TO CONDUCT THIS 
INVESTIGATION, CAN A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION ACTUALLY BE 
CONDUCTED?
>> IF YOU HAVE TOTALLY 
COOPERATIVE WITNESSES PRE-
IDENTIFIED, AND THE SCOPE IS 
WIDE ENOUGH, I THINK THE FBI IS 
CAPABLE OF ADDING SIGNIFICANT 
VALUE TO THE BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION THAT HAS ALREADY 
OCCURRED HERE. 
THIS IS UNMISTAKABLY A THREE-
DIMENSIONAL CHESS GAME, WHERE 
YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF LAYERS OF 
POLITICS, WHETHER IT IS TO 
LAYCOCK -- 
>> WHETHER IT IS DELAY, STALL, 
GO AND BE AN INDEPENDENT 
FACTFINDER, IF PEOPLE CAN BE 
CONVINCED BY ADDITIONAL 
EVIDENCE, EITHER THAT THE 
PROCESS HAS NOW BEEN MADE RIGHT,
OR THAT THE PROCESS WAS NEVER 
RIGHT, AND THE POLITICS ARE 
WRONG, I SUSPECT AS MAJOR 
GARRETT REFLECTED, YOU PROBABLY 
HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE 
UP THEIR MINDS ONE WAY OR THE 
OTHER, AND THE FBI'S JOB IS TO 
ADD CLARITY FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT 
HAVE AN OPEN MIND ON THIS. 
>> COULD THE CLARITY BE AS 
SIMPLE AS -- SO THE NOMINEE WAS 
ASKED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT 
REFERENCES IN HIS YEARBOOK, 
SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS 
DRINKING HABITS, THERE ARE 
SOME, WITHOUT EVIDENCE, WHO 
FEEL THAT HE PERHAPS MISLED THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS 
INITIALLY CAME UP BECAUSE OF 
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT, BUT EVEN IF THE FBI 
IS ABLE TO SAY WILL LOOK, HE 
DID DRINK A LOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, 
HE DID DRINK A LOT IN COLLEGE, 
HE EVADED THOSE QUESTIONS OR 
MISCHARACTERIZED THEM, WHETHER 
IT IS LIMITED OR NOT, THE 
INVESTIGATION, JUST ANSWERING 
THOSE SIMPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHAT THE NOMINEE SAID WHEN HE 
WAS BEING INTERROGATED BY THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, 
WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO SAY 
THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS FLAWS IN 
THIS CANDIDATE?
>> THAT CONCLUSION IS UP TO 
EACH INDIVIDUAL SENATOR, MY 
UNBELIEF AND EXPERIENCES, 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE PROCESS 
ALCOHOL IN DIFFERENT WAYS, 2 
DRINKS TO ONE PERSON MAY BE 
WHAT LOOKS LIKE A DOZEN DRINKS 
TO SOMEONE ELSE, OR COUPLE OF 
CASES, SO I DON'T SEE THE 
CANDIDATE CHANGING HIS VERSION 
OF EVENTS HERE, BUT I DO THINK 
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY, THE 
WINDOW IS OPEN, FOR ADDITIONAL 
WITNESSES TO SELF IDENTIFY, TO 
CONTACT THOSE FBI FIELD 
OFFICERS, OR THE MAIN FBI 
NUMBER, AND SAY I HAVE VALUABLE 
INFORMATION, I WANT TO WEIGH IN 
ON THIS, AND IF THOSE LEADS ARE 
PURSUED, THAT MAY SHED 
ADDITIONAL LIGHT, OR WE MAY -- 
END UP AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
NOT MOVING THE BALL AND INCH. 
>> BEFORE I GO, SOMETHING I 
DIDN'T THINK OF, YOU JUST SAID, 
CAN SOMEONEWHO HAS CREDIBLE 
EVIDENCE, THE FBI AND SAY I 
WANT TO ADD TO THE 
INVESTIGATION, DOES THE FBI SAY 
WE ARE NOT TALKING TO YOU, WE 
ARE ONLY TALKING TO THE 
SPECIFIC PEOPLE, BECAUSE 
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE SAID HE 
WANTED IT TO BE LIMITED IN TIME 
AND SCOPE, OR DOES THE FBI HAVE 
AN OBLIGATION TO LISTEN TO 
PEOPLE, IT CAN'T JUST OPEN THE 
FLOODGATES TO EVERYONE WHO 
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, 
BUT IF THEY FIND IT TO BE 
CREDIBLE, CAN THEY INVESTIGATED 
OR CAN THEY SAY NO? 
>> I THINK FIRST, THE PUBLIC 
CAN CERTAINLY CALL THE FBI, IF 
YOU CALL YOUR LOCAL FBI OFFICE 
NOW, THEY ARE ALL ROUTED TO A 
CALL CENTER IN WEST VIRGINIA, 
I'M SURE THOSE FOLKS AT THE 
CALL CENTER ARE ON ALERT TO 
INFORMATION COMING ABOUT THIS 
VERY IMPORTANT EVENT, THIS 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS, AND THE 
FBI'S ROLE IN IT, HOPEFULLY IT 
IS PRETTY SMOOTH, FROM A 
COMPLAINT, OR INFORMATION TO 
THE SECURITY DIVISION THAT 
OVERSEES THESE, GETTING THE 
INFORMATION THEY ARE, PEOPLE 
MAKING AN ASSESSMENT AS TO 
WHETHER WE ARE UNDER THE WHITE 
HOUSE RULES, CAN WE PURSUE 
THIS, ON HER OWN, AND THEY WILL 
RELAY SOME OF THE INFORMATION 
BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAY 
LOOK, THIS IS THE VOLUME OF 
WHAT IS COMING IN, AND THE FEEL 
OF WHAT IS COMING IN, WHERE YOU 
WANT TO GO WITH THIS, BECAUSE 
WE CAN EXPECT THAT IF THEY 
DON'T PURSUE IT FULLY, THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THIS GROUP 
IS GOING TO BE RAISING A RUCKUS 
ABOUT THE FBI BEING UNDULY 
CONSTRAINED. 
>> IT GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION 
ALL ALONG, IS THAT NORMAL FOR 
THE FBI TO SAY, HEY WHITE 
HOUSE, HERE'S AN ALLEGATION 
THAT'S COME IN, WHAT SHOULD WE 
DO ABOUT IT, OR DO THEY JUST GO 
TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND SAY 
WE HAVE THESE ALLEGATIONS, 
UNDER THE AUTHORITY WE HAVE, WE 
ARE BOUND TO PURSUE THEM, IT 
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE SAYS CLICK 
>> THIS PROCESS IS VERY 
UNUSUAL, I SUSPECT THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE IN CONCERT WITH THE 
REPUBLICANS ON THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, HAVE LAID OUT THE 
TERMS OF WHAT ADDITIONAL WORK 
THEY WANT THE FBI TO DO, AND IF 
SOMETHING IS WITHIN THAT LANE, 
GO AHEAD AND PURSUE IT, BUT IF 
IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS MATERIALLY 
OUTSIDE THE LANE, LET US KNOW 
BEFORE YOU PURSUE IT. 
I THINK THE FBI IS CONSTRAINED 
HERE, CLEARLY WITHIN TIME 
CONSTRAINTS, AND VERY LIKELY 
VERY CLOSELY WATCHED SUBSET OF 
CONSTRAINTS AS WELL.
>> RON, ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE 
YOUR ANALYSIS.>> MY PLEASURE. 
>>> WE ARE BREAKING IN TO SHOW 
YOU THE ROSE GARDEN, JUST 
MOMENTS FROM NOW WE ARE HOPING 
TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT, 
TALKING ABOUT THIS NEW DEAL 
THAT HE HAMMERED OUT BETWEEN 
MEICO, THE U.S. AND CANADA TO 
REPLACE NAFTA, HE CALLED NAFTA 
ULCERS OF THINGS, INCLUDING ONE 
OF THE WORST DEALS EVER 
HAMMERED OUT, AND REPEATEDLY 
SAID THERE WAS AN IMBALANCE IN 
TRADE, AND SO THIS IS A KEY 
CAMPAIGN PROMISE, THAT REALLY, 
IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE IT WASN'T 
GOING TO HAPPEN, THERE WAS A 
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE, CANADA HAD 
NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT, AND 
AT THE 11th HOUR CAME INTO THE 
AGREEMENT.
>> AND HERE IS THE PRESIDENT.
>>  
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PLEASE SIT 
DOWN. 
IT IS REALLY GREAT TO SEE 
EVERYBODY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL, 
BEAUTIFUL DAY IN WASHINGTON, 
WASHINGTON DC. 
SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS ONE, BUT I 
WILL NOT SAY THAT TODAY, I 
REFUSE, THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT, 
WHAT WE ARE DOING, ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT DEALS, AND THE 
MOST IMPORTANT TRADE DEAL WE'VE 
EVER MADE BY FAR, I WANT TO 
THINK SENATOR JONI ERNST FROM 
IOWA, WE WILL BE DOING 
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT IN 
IOWA, BUT THIS IS MAYBE MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN EVERYTHING PUT 
TOGETHER, I WOULD THINK YOU FOR 
BEING HERE. 
CONGRESSMAN HOLDING, ROWE, 
NEWHOUSE AND MEADOWS, THANK YOU 
FOR BEING HERE, YOU'VE BEEN 
INTRUMENTAL, THANK YOU. 
I AM THRILLED TO SPEAK TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SHARE TRULY 
HISTORIC NEWS FOR OUR NATION. 
AND INDEED, FOR THE WORLD, I 
WANT TO THINK VICE PRESIDENT 
MIKE PENCE -- THANK VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, WE HAVE 
COMPLETED NEGOTIATIONS ON A 
BRAND-NEW DEAL TO TERMINATE AND 
REPLACE NAFTA, AND THE NAFTA 
TRADE AGREEMENTS, WITH AN 
INCREDIBLE NEW U.S., MEXICO, 
CANADA AGREEMENT, CALLED USMCA.
>> 
>> THAT WILL BE THE NAME THAT 99
PERCENT OF THE TIME WE WILL BE 
HEARING, USMCA,  A GOOD RING TO 
IT, I HAVE SAID THAT NAFTA WAS 
PERHAPS THE WORST TRADE DEAL 
EVER MADE, SINCE NAFTA'S 
ADOPTION, THE U.S. RECEP TAYYIP 
ERDOGAN TRADE DEFICITS TOTALING 
$2 TRILLION, AND IT IS MUCH 
HIGHER, WITH CANADA AND MEXICO, 
IT LOST VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY, 
AND FOUR-POINT 1 MILLION 
MANUFACTURING JOBS, AND 1 IN 4 
OTHER JOBS, EVEN MORE THAN 
THAT. 
THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN, I 
PROMISED TO RENEGOTIATE NAFTA, 
AND WE HAVE KEPT THAT PROMISE 
TODAY, BUT FOR 25 YEARS AS A 
CIVILIAN, A BUSINESSMAN, I USED 
TO SAY HOW COULD ANYONE HAVE 
SIGNED A DEAL LIKE NAFTA, AND I 
WATCHED NEW ENGLAND, SO ME 
PLACES WHERE I WAS, THE 
FACTORIES WERE LEAVING, THE 
JOBS WERE LEAVING, PEOPLE WERE 
BEING FIRED, AND WE CAN'T HAVE 
THAT. 
SO WE HAVE NEGOTIATED THIS NEW 
AGREEMENT BASED ON THE 
PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS AND 
RECIPROCITY. 
TO ME, IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
WORD IN TRADE, BECAUSE WE HAVE 
BEEN TREATED SO UNFAIRLY BY SO 
MANY NATIONS ALL OVER THE 
WORLD, AND WE ARE CHANGING THAT.
WE JUST SIGNED A MUCH BETTER 
DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA, WE HAD A 
HORRIBLE DEAL, AND WE SIGNED IT 
AT THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THAT 
HAS WORKED OUT WELL, THEY ARE 
HAPPY, WE ARE HAPPY, GOOD FOR 
JOBS, GOOD FOR A LOT OF THINGS, 
THEY SAID THAT 250,000 JOBS 
WILL BE GIVEN BY SIGNING THE 
TRANSACTION, THEY WERE RIGHT, 
250,000 JOBS TO SOUTH KOREA, 
NOT TO THE UNITED STATES, THAT 
HS CHANGED, FOR THE BETTER, 
THIS IS A BRAND-NEW DEAL. 
THE AGREEMENT WILL GOVERN NEARLY
ONE $.2 TRILLION IN TRADE, 
WHICH MAKES IT THE BIGGEST 
TRADE DEAL IN U.S. HISTORY, I 
WANT TO CONGRATULATE U.S. TRADE 
REPRESENTATIVE BOB LIGHTHEISER, 
WHO HAS WORKED, NOBODY 
UNDERSTANDS HOW HARD IS 
WORKED.>> 
>> NO MATTER WHO YOU CALLED 
HIM, HE WAS IN THE OFFICE, OR 
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S OFFICE, HE 
IS GREAT. 
I SAID IF I EVER WANT TO DO 
THIS, I WILL GET HIM TO 
REPRESENT US, HE FELT THE WAY I 
DID. 
THE ENTIRE TEAM AT THE USTR, 
STANDING BEHIND ME, AND IN THE 
AUDIENCE, THANK YOU ALL, PETER 
NAVARRO, AND EVERYBODY, I THINK 
YOU ALL. 
A FANTASTIC GROUP OF PEOPLE, 
THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
I WANT TO THINK SECRETARY 
MNUCHIN, ROSS, NIELSEN, JARED 
KUSHNER, AND THE UNITED STATES 
AMBASSADOR, KELLY CROFT, I WANT 
TO THINK PRESIDENT PENA NIETO 
OF MEXICO, WE HAVE SOME 
DISAGREEMENTS, I LIKE HIM A LOT 
THOUGH, I THINK HE LIKES ME, HE 
WILL BE LEAVING SOON, HE HAS 
DONE A GOOD JOB, A WONDERFUL 
PERSON. 
AND THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT ELECT,
LOPEZ OBRADOR, WHO HAS GIVEN 
HIS BLESSING FOR THIS AGREEMENT,
I THINK WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING 
GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY AND 
MEXICO, THEY WORKED TOGETHER ON 
THIS, THIS WAS DONE BY BOTH, I 
SAID I DON'T WANT TO SIGN THE 
AGREEMENT, AND A NEW ONE COMES 
IN, THEY DON'T LIKE IT, IT IS 
DIFFICULT, THEY WORKED ON IT, 
AND WE APPRECIATE THE HELP FROM 
BOTH, AND JUSTIN TRUDEAU, I 
WANT TO GIVE MY REGARDS TO 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, A LOT OF NEWS 
CAME OUT ABOUT US, BUT I TURN 
-- I TELL YOU IS AS -- IT HAS 
TURNED OUT TO BE IN A GREAT 
DEAL FOR ALL THREE OF US, IT IS 
GOOD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD 
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE 
WORLD IS DOING, THE UNFAIR 
TRADE PRACTICES THE COUNTRIES 
USING AGAINST THE U.S., THIS IS 
A TERRIFIC DEAL FOR ALL OF US. 
ONCE APPROVED BY CONGRESS, THE 
NEW DEAL WILL BE THE MOST 
MODERN, UP-TO-DATE AND BALANCED 
TRADE AGREEMENT IN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY, WITH THE MOST 
ADVANCED PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS
THEY WERE DEVELOPED, IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE REVIEWS, PEOPLE 
THAT WOULD NORMALLY NOT UNDER 
ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OR SAY GOOD 
THINGS, BECAUSE AUTOMATICALLY 
THEY HAVE TO SAY BAD, SOME 
DEMOCRATS SAY THAT'S AMAZING, 
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN THE 
SOUNDBITES YET, I GUESS MY, BUT 
YOU ACTUALLY HAD DEMOCRATS
SAYING THIS WAS REALLY AMAZING 
IF YOU REALLY GOT ALL OF THAT. 
BUT BY TOMORROW, I SUSPECT THAT 
WILL CHANGE, THEY WILL CHANGE 
THEIR TUNE, THAT'S OKAY, IT'S 
AN AMAZING DEAL FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE. 
LIKEWISE, THE MOST ADVANCED 
TRADE DEAL IN THE WORLD WITH 
AMBITIOUS PROVISIONS ON THE 
DIGITAL ECONOMY, PATENTS, VERY 
IMPORTANT, FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
AND OTHER AREAS WHERE THE 
UNITED STATES HAS A STRONG, 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. 
MEXICO AND CANADA HAVE AGREED 
TO STRONG NEW LABOR PROTECTIONS,
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS, AND 
NEW PROTECTIONS FOR 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 
SO IMPORTANT. 
THIS NEW DEAL IS AN ESPECIALLY 
GREAT DEAL FOR OUR FARMERS, OUR 
FARMERS HAVE GONE OVER -- GONE 
THROUGH A LOT OVER THE PAST FEW 
YEARS, TAKING ADVANTAGE BY 
EVERYBODY, PRICES HAVE GONE WAY 
DOWN, AND WE ARE WORKING ON 
SOME OTHER DEALS THAT WILL MAKE 
THEM HAPPY ALSO, BUT THIS IS A 
VERY BIG DEAL FOR OUR FARMERS, 
AND MEXICO AND CANADA WILL BE 
OPENED UP A LOT MORE THAN THEY 
ARE NOW. 
AND I THINK THERE WILL BE A 
BETTER SPIRIT BETWEEN THE THREE 
COUNTRIES, WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
FOR OUR FARMERS. 
THE AGREEMENT WILL GIVE FARMERS 
AND RANCHERS FAR GREATER ACCESS 
TO SELF AMERICAN GROWN PRODUCE 
MEXICO AND CANADA, THE DEAL 
INCLUDES A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE 
IN OUR FARMERS OPPORTUNITIES TO 
EXPORT AMERICAN WHEAT, POULTRY, 
EGGS AND DAIRY, INCLUDING, 
MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, YOGURT 
AND ICE CREAM, TO NAME A FEW. 
I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC.
>> 
>> I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC, 
RIGHT? 
AND MANY OTHER PRODUCTS, BUT 
THOSE PRODUCTS WERE NOT REALLY 
BEING TREATED FAIRLY AS FAR AS 
THOSE WHO WORK SO HARD TO 
PRODUCE THEM, AND NOW THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. 
THESE MEASURES WILL SUPPORT 
MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
AMERICAN JOBS, THIS IS ALSO A 
HISTORIC WIN FOR AMERICAN 
MANUFACTURERS, AND AMERICAN 
AUTOWORKERS, TREATED SO BADLY, 
WE'VE LOST 70 JOBS OVER THE 
YEARS UNDER NAFTA, UNDER THE 
CURRENT NEW DEAL, AND IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE CURRENT NAFTA DEAL, 
THE NEW DEAL IS TAKING CARE OF 
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS, BECAUSE 
NAFTA, FOREIGN COMPANIES HAVE 
BEEN ALLOWED TO MANUFACTURE 
MANY OF THEIR PARTS OVERSEAS, 
SHIP THEM TO MEXICO AND CANADA 
FOR ASSEMBLY, AND SEND THEIR 
FOREIGN-MADE CARS INTO THE 
UNITED STATES WITH NO TAX. 
SO WE LET ALL OF OUR PEOPLE GO, 
WE FIRE EVERYBODY, THEY MAKE 
CARS, THEY MAKE PRODUCTS, THEY 
MAKE EVERYTHING, IN ANOTHER 
COUNTRY, THEY SEND THEM TO THE 
UNITED STATES, NO TAX. 
AND THE COST IS VERY LITTLE 
DIFFERENCE, SOMETIMES IT'S MORE 
FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO 
TALK ABOUT COST, WITH THIS 
AGREEMENT, WE ARE CLOSING ALL 
OF THESE TERRIBLE LOOPHOLES, 
THEIR CLOSE, GONE, A DISASTER, 
WE ARE REQUIRING A LARGE 
PORTION OF EVERY CAR TO BE MADE 
BY HIGH WAGE WORKERS, WHICH 
WILL REDUCE OUTSOURCING, A 
TREMENDOUS PROBLEM, AND IT 
MEANS MORE AUTO-PARTS AND 
AUTOMOBILES WILL BE 
MANUFACTURED INSIDE THE UNITED 
DATES, WE WILL BE MANUFACTURING 
MANY MORE CARS, AND OUR 
COMPANIES WILL NOT BE LEAVING 
THE UNITED STATES -- INSIDE THE 
UNITED STATES. THEY WILL NOT BE 
BUILDING CARS ELSEWHERE, THERE 
IS NO LONGER THAT INCENTIVE, 
UNDER THE NAFTA DEAL, THEY HAD 
THAT INCENTIVE, THEY HAVE THE 
OPPOSITE ONE NOW, THEY WILL BE 
LEAVING OUR COUNTRY. 
I DO NOT WANT TO SEE OUR 
COMPANIES LEAVE AND FIRE OUR 
WORKERS, AND OUR WORKERS NEVER 
GET JOBS TO REPLACE THOSE JOBS, 
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 
THIS DEAL WILL ALSO IMPOSE NEW 
STANDARDS REQUIRING AT LEAST 
75% OF EVERY AUTOMOBILE TO BE 
MADE IN NORTH AMERICA, IN ORDER 
TO QUALIFY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF 
FREE AXIS TO OUR MARKETS, AND 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, IT'S A 
PRIVILEGE, WE DON'T TAKE IT AS 
A PRIVILEGE, IT IS A PRIVILEGE 
FOR THEM TO DO BUSINESS WITH US.
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT 
MEXICO OR CANADA, I'M TALKING 
ABOUT EVERYBODY. 
EVERYBODY. 
IT IS A PRIVILEGE FOR CHINA TO 
DO BUSINESS WITH US, IT IS A 
PRIVILEGE FOR THE EUROPEAN 
UNION, WHO HAS TREATED US VERY 
BADLY, BUT THAT'S COMING ALONG, 
TO DO BUSINESS WITH US, JAPAN, 
EVERY COUNTRY, A PRIVILEGE FOR 
THEM TO COME IN AND ATTACK THE 
PIGGY BANK. 
IN THIS, WE WILL HAVE A RESULT 
OF MUCH MORE HAPPENING IN THE 
UNITED STATES, IT MEANS MORE 
THAN ANYTHING ELSE, FAR MORE 
AMERICAN JOBS, THESE ARE HIGH-
QUALITY JOBS, STRONG PROVISIONS 
TO ENFORCE WHAT IS CALLED THE 
RULES OF ORIGIN REQUIREMENTS, 
THIS WILL INCENTIVIZE BILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS IN NEW PURCHASES OF 
U.S. MADE AUTOMOBILES. 
ONCE APPROVED, THIS WILL BE A 
NEW DAWN FOR THE AMERICAN AUTO 
INDUSTRY, AND FOR THE AMERICAN 
AUTO WORKER, THEY WILL SEE, 
THEY UNDERSTAND, THEY VOTED FOR 
US IN LARGE NUMBERS, EVEN 
THOUGH THEIR LEADERSHIP ALWAYS 
GOES DEMOCRAT. 
A COUPLE OF THEM SAID TO ME, I 
DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN DO IT 
AGAIN, MANY OF THEM, THE 
LEADERS WOULD BACK DEMOCRATS 
AND TELL ME, YOU ARE GOING TO 
GET MOST OF THE VOTES FROM 
UNION WORKERS, AND WE GOT MOST 
OF THE VOTES FROM WORKERS,.. 
-- FROM WORKERS, PERIOD. THEY 
WERE VERY MUCH BEHIND WHAT WE 
WERE DOING IS ONE PRIMARY 
ASPECT, IT WILL TRANSFORM NORTH 
AMERICA BACK INTO A 
MANUFACTURING POWERHOUSE, IF 
YOU REMEMBER THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS, THEY SAID WE 
ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE 
MANUFACTURING JOBS ESSENTIALLY, 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THINGS 
ANYMORE? 
NO, JUST THE OPPOSITE, IT'S 
GOING T BE A MANUFACTURING 
POWERHOUSE, ALLOWING US TO 
RECLAIM A SUPPLY-CHAIN THAT HAS 
BEEN OFF SHORED TO THE WORLD 
BECAUSE OF UNFAIR TRADE ISSUES. 
WE ALSO PROVIDE BRAND-NEW 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
PROTECTIONS FOR BIOLOGIC DRUGS, 
WHICH WILL MAKE NORTH AMERICA A 
HAVEN FOR MEDICAL INNOVATION 
AND DEVELOPMENT, WE WANT DRUGS 
TO BE MADE HERE, WHEN YOU TALK 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, WE DON'T 
LIKE GETTING THEM FROM FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
THEY -- WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH 
THOSE, HOW THEY ARE BEING MADE, 
TOO IMPORTANT. 
BRINGING CASH AND JOBS INTO THE 
UNITED STATES AND GOOD FOR 
CANADA, GOOD FOR MEXICO, 
INSTEAD OF JOBS LEAVING FOR 
OVERSEAS. 
THEY WILL BE RETURNING BACK 
HOME, WE HAVE MANY CAR 
COMPANIES, I WAS WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER OF JAPAN, HE SAID WE 
HAVE SENT MANY CAR COMPANIES TO 
THE UNITED STATES OVER THE LAST 
YEAR AND A HALF, IT'S TRUE, BIG 
EXPANSIONS, AND VERY 
IMPORTANTLY, HE SAID MANY MORE 
COMING, BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN 
INCENTIVE TO BE HERE, PEOPLE 
WANT TO BE BACK IN THE U.S. 
AGAIN, AS I SAY, THE U.S. IS 
RESPECTED AGAIN, BUT IT IS ALSO 
RESPECTED AS TO TRADE AND 
INDUSTRY. 
THIS IS A TRULY EXTRAORDINARY 
AGREEMENT FOR THE U.S., CANADA 
AND MEXICO. 
PRESIDENT PENA NIETO, IT'S SO 
IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESIDENT 
AND I HAVE DEVELOPED THIS SORT 
OF A BOND, A BOND ON TRADE. 
PENA NIETO HAS DONE A VERY GOOD 
JOB FOR MEXICO, IN TERMS OF 
TRADE, AND PRIME MINISTER 
TRUDEAU, I JUST SPOKE TO THEM A 
LITTLE WHILE AGO, THEY LOVE 
THEIR COUNTRIES, THEY WANT TO 
DO RIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRIES, 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS 
AGREEMENT, WE FORMED A GREAT 
PARTNERSHIP WITH MEXICO, AND 
WITH CANADA. 
AND I PLAN TO SIGN THE 
AGREEMENT BY THE END OF 
NOVEMBER, I THEN WILL SUBMITTED 
FOR APPROVAL TO CONGRESS, WHERE 
IN THEORY THERE SHOULD BE NO 
TROUBLE, BUT ANYTHING YOU 
SUBMIT TO CONGRESS IS TROUBLE 
TO MATTER WHAT, THE SINGLE 
GREATEST AGREEMENT EVER SIGNED, 
THEY WILL SAY WELL, YOU KNOW, 
TRUMP LIKES IT, THEREFORE WE 
ARE NOT GOING TO PROVE IT, THAT 
WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS, SO WE CAN'T 
APPROVE IT, IT WILL BE SENT TO 
CONGRESS PURSUANT TO THE TRADE 
PROMOTION AUTHORITY ACT, IT 
FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS OF OUR 
SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF A NEW 
AND BALANCED TRADE DEAL WITH 
SOUTH KOREA, A TREMENDOUS 
DIFFERENCE IN THE DEAL FROM 
WHAT IT WAS, IT WAS A DISASTER, 
AS I SAID. 
TO APPROVE THE OLD DEAL THAT 
KILLED SO MANY JOBS, IT FOLLOWS 
ON OUR ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW 
TRADE NEGOTIATION WITH JAPAN, 
JAPAN WOULD NEVER NEGOTIATE 
WITH THE U.S., THEY SAID WE ARE 
NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE, THEY 
TOLD THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION WE ARE NOT GOING 
TO NEGOTIATE, AND I SAID YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO NEGOTIATE, BUT WE 
ARE GOING TO PUT A VERY 
SUBSTANTIAL TAX UNDER CAR IF 
YOU DON'T. 
AND WITHOUT TARIFFS, WE 
WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT A 
DEAL, JUST FOR THOSE BABIES OUT 
THERE WHO KEEP TALKING ABOUT 
TARIFFS, OH PLEASE DON'T CHARGE 
TARIFFS, THAT INCLUDES CONGRESS,
WITHOUT TARIFFS, WE WOULDN'T BE 
STANDING HERE, BOB AND ALL OF 
THESE FOLKS, WE WOULD NOT BE 
STANDING HERE, WE ARE TOTALLY 
PREPARED TO DO THAT IF THEY 
DON'T NEGOTIATE, BUT JAPAN IS 
WANTING TO NEGOTIATE, THE CALL 
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO, AND HE 
IS A TERRIFIC MAN, JUST HAD A 
TREMENDOUS VICTORY, AND THEY 
SAID WE WOULD LIKE TO START 
NEGOTIATIONS IMMEDIATELY.>>> 
INDIA, WHICH IS THE TERROR OF 
KING, THEY CALLED US AND SAID 
WE WANT TO START NEGOTIATIONS 
IMMEDIATELY, WHEN BOB LIKE 
KAISER -- 
>> WHEN BOB LIGHTHEISER TALK TO 
THEM, THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO 
KEEP US HAPPY, THEY ARE WISE TO 
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING, INDIA 
CHARGES 100% TARIFFS, THAT IS 
NOT FREE TRADE, AND I WOULD SAY 
WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE COME 
FROM, SO BECAUSE OF THE POWER 
OF TARIFFS, AND THE POWER WE 
HAVE WITH TARIFFS, IN MANY 
CASES WE WON'T EVEN HAVE TO USE 
THEM. 
THAT IS HOW POWERFUL THEY ARE 
AND HOW GOOD THEY ARE, BUT IN 
MANY CASES, WE ARE NOT GOING TO 
HAVE TO USE THEM. 
IN MANY CASES, COUNTRIES THAT 
ARE CHARGING MASSIVE TARIFFS 
ARE ELIMINATING THOSE TARIFFS. 
AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE $250 
BILLION AT 25% INTEREST, WITH 
CHINA RIGHT NOW, AND WE COULD GO
$267 BILLION MORE, AND CHINA 
WANTS TO TALK VERY BADLY, AND I 
SAID FRANKLY, IT'S TOO EARLY TO 
TALK, WE CAN'T TALK NOW, THEY 
ARE NOT READY, THEY'VE BEEN 
RIPPING US FOR SO MANY YEARS, 
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN QUICKLY, AND 
IF POLITICALLY, PEOPLE FORCE IT 
TO QUICKLY, YOU ARE NOT GOING 
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL FOR 
WORKERS IN OUR COUNTRY, CHINA 
WANTS TO TALK, WE WANT TO TALK 
TO THEM, WE WANT THEM TO HELP 
US WITH NORTH KOREA, TO 
CONTINUE TO DO THAT, VERY 
IMPORTANT.
>>> THE EUROPEAN UNION, VERY 
TOUGH ON THE UNITED STATES, 
LAST YEAR AND FOR MANY YEARS, 
THEY LOST IN THE VICINITY OF 
$150 BILLION A YEAR, MASSIVE 
TRADE BARRIERS, AND THEY DID 
NOT WANT TO COME. 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK. 
JEAN-CLAUDE, A GREAT 
BUSINESSPERSON, HEAD OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION, MY FRIEND, I 
SAY JOHN CLAUDE, WE WANT TO 
MAKE A DEAL. 
HE SAYS NO, WE ARE VERY HAPPY, 
AND I SAY I'M NOT HAPPY, WE 
HAVE ONE OF THE WORST DEALS OF 
ANY GROUP, WITH THE EUROPEAN 
UNION, AND THEY JUST DIDN'T 
WANT TO COME, BECAUSE THEY WERE 
HAPPY WITH THE DEAL, AND I SAID 
WE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE DEAL, 
AND FINALLY AFTER GOING THROUGH 
THE WHOLE PROCESS, I SAID WE 
WILL PUT A TAX OF 20% ON 
MERCEDES, BMWS, MILLIONS OF 
CARS THAT THEY SELL HERE, THAT 
THEY WILL TAKE OVER THERE. 
FARM PRODUCT THAT THEY WON'T 
TAKE OVER THERE, THERE ARE 
BARRIERS, OUR FARMERS AREN'T 
ALLOWED TO SELL OVER THERE, 
MANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS, MOST OF 
THEM, SO I ANNOUNCED THAT WE 
WILL PUT A 20% TARIFF, HE COULD 
BE 25%, ON THEIR CARS COMING IN,
THEY IMMEDIATELY CALLED AND 
SAID WE WOULD LIKE TO START 
NEGOTIATING, AND WE ARE HAVING 
SUCCESS, WE WILL SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS, ALWAYS SAY WHO KNOWS, 
BUT WE WILL SEE, I HAVE A 
FEELING WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.
>>> A PILLAR OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY IS ECONOMIC SECURITY 
AND TRADE, IT'S NOT WHERE WE 
LOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR,
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, WE 
HAVE AVERAGED OVER $800 BILLION 
A YEAR LOST ON TRADE, HOW DUMB 
IS THAT? 
$800 BILLION, THIS GROUP DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS, 
I DON'T EVEN WITH HIM TO HEAR 
ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS, THE U.S. 
IN ITS TRADE DEALS HAS LOST ON 
AVERAGE ALMOST $800 BILLION A 
YEAR, DEALING WITH CHINA, 
EUROPEAN UNION, EVERYBODY, 
JAPAN, MEXICO, CANADA, 
EVERYBODY. 
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW 
THAT TO HAPPEN.
>>> OUR MANUFACTURING BASE, AND 
MANUFACTURING SECTOR. 
THOSE ARE ALL REALLY ESSENTIAL 
INGREDIENTS TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
WE CAN'T ALLOW WHAT HAS BEEN 
HAPPENING OVER THE LAST 25 
YEARS TO HAPPEN. 
WE ARE BUILDING OUR MILITARY 
LIKE NEVER BEFORE, IT WILL BE 
THE STRONGEST THE RIVER WAS -- 
IT EVER WAS, THE ROCKETS, 
SHIPS, IN THE UNITED STATES, 
JOBS.
>>> OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING LIKE 
NEVER BEFORE, JOBLESS CLAIMS 
ARE AT A 50 YEAR LOW, THE STOCK 
MARKET IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH, 
THINK OF THAT, OVER 50%, SINCE 
MY LECTION, -- MY ELECTION, THE 
401(K), THEY WERE DYING WITH 
THEM FOR YEARS, NOW THEY ARE SO 
HAPPY, I WAS TELLING THE STORY, 
I TELL ABOUT A POLICEMAN NEW 
YORK WHO CAME UP, HIS WIFE WAS 
ALWAYS IN -- UPSET WITH HIM AS 
AN INVESTOR, BECAUSE HE WASN'T 
DOING WELL WITH 401(K)S, BUT 
SHE SAYS HE'S A GENIUS NOW. 
WE ARE UP 50% SINCE THE 
ELECTION, YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY 
THIS MANY TIME, THUS MANY TIMES,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN, 
HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT, IS AT 
RECORD LOWS IN HISTORY, NOT FOR 
THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY, AFRICAN-
AMERICAN, ASIAN, HISPANIC, 
YOUNG PEOPLE WITHOUT HIGH 
SCHOOL DIPLOMAS, ALL AT HIS 
STORE, -- HISTORIC LOWS, A VERY 
IMPORTANT SECTOR. 
THE LOWEST IN HISTORY, IT IS 
GREAT. 
THIS IS HELPING SO MUCH WITH 
PEOPLE THAT GET OUT OF PRISON, 
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM, 
PEOPLE GET OUT OF PRISON, THEY 
CAN'T GET A JOB, EMPLOYERS 
DON'T WANT TO HIRE THEM, THE 
ECONOMY IS SO GOOD, THEY ARE 
HIRING THEM, AND THEY ARE 
TURNING OUT TO BE INCREDIBLE 
WORKERS, THEY ARE GIVEN A 
CHANCE, THEY'RE GIVEN A SECOND 
CHANCE, A THIRD CHANCE IN SOME 
CASES, BUT I'VE HAD NUMEROUS 
EMPLOYERS SAY I TELL YOU WHAT, 
I'VE TAKEN PEOPLE WHO WERE IN 
PRISON, AND WE HAVE HIRED THEM, 
HE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS IN 
A NORMAL OR BAD ECONOMY, ONLY 
IN THIS KIND OF ECONOMY, AND 
NOW HE IS THE BIGGEST FAN, ONE 
MAN IN PARTICULAR, TAKING 
NUMEROUS PEOPLE, HE SAYS MOST 
OF THEM HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLE, 
AND THAT IS A GREAT THING, A 
REALLY GREAT THING. 
IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE.
>>> SO BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS,
I WANT TO EXTEND OUR WARMEST 
CONDOLENCES TO THE COUNTRY OF 
INDONESIA, FRIEND OF MINE, WE 
ARE GOING TO BE CALLING UP THE 
LEADER, WHO WAS A GREAT LEADER, 
INDEED, BUT THEY GOT HIT BY A 
GIANT TSUNAMI, LIKE PEOPLE HAVE 
NOT SEEN, IN THIS PART OF THE 
WORLD, THEY HAVE NOT SEEN IT SO 
MUCH, FORTUNATELY, THE WORST OF 
ALL, THE TORNADOES, HURRICANES, 
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT NATURAL 
DISASTERS, A FRIEND OF MINE WHO 
STUDIES NATURAL DISASTERS, I 
DON'T KNOW WHY HE DOES THAT, 
BUT HE DOES, HE SAYS THAT THE 
TSUNAMI IS THE WORST OF ALL, 
AND THEY GOT HIT VERY HARD, AND 
PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
KILLED, WE HAVE ALREADY SENT A 
LOT OF FIRST RESPONDERS AND 
MILITARY AND OTHERS TO HELP, BUT
IT IS A REALLY BAD SITUATION.
>>> FINALLY, BEFORE CLOSING, I 
WANT TO SEND OUR THOUGHTS AND 
PRAYERS TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 
LAS VEGAS SHOOTING, THAT WAS A 
HORRIBLE TIME IN THE LIFE OF 
OUR COUNTRY, IT TOOK PLACE 
EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO TODAY, ALL 
OF AMERICA IS GRIEVING FOR THE 
LIVES LOST AND FOR THE FAMILIES 
THEY LEFT BEHIND, SO TO ALL OF 
THOSE FAMILIES AND TO THE 
PEOPLE LAS VEGAS, WE LOVE YOU, 
WE ARE WITH YOU, WE ARE WORKING 
WITH YOU VERY HARD. 
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE 
EVENT. 
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.
>>> I WANT TO ASK BOB 
LIGHTHIZER,  WHO WAS JUST A 
TERRIFIC INDIVIDUAL, AS WELL AS 
A MAN WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE 
SUBJECT, TO COME UP AND SAY A 
WORD ABOUT THE U.S. AGREEMENT, 
THE USMCA,  AND IF YOU HAVE 
QUESTIONS, WE WILL TAKE 
QUESTIONS AFTER THAT, BOB?>> [ 
APPLAUSE ]
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. 
PRESIDENT, I WANT TO GIVE YOU A 
VIGNETTE, IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT 
WORKING FOR THE PRESIDENT, 
AUGUST 16 LAST YEAR WE STARTED 
THIS PROCESS, AND I AM AT A 
HOTEL, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
WAITING TO HAVE THE 
INTRODUCTION OF MYSELF AND MY 2 
COUNTERPARTS, ONE FROM CANADA 
AND THE UNITED STATES, AND 
MEXICO, I GO ON A CELL PHONE, 
THE PRESIDENT STARTS TALKING, 
EVERYBODY IS WAITING, TALKING, 
GOING THROUGH WHAT HE WAS TO 
GET DONE ON NAFTA, ALL OF THE 
PROBLEMS, WHICH SHE IS QUITE 
FAMILIAR WITH, AND HE FINALLY 
SAYS TWO THINGS THAT WERE 
TELLING, ONE, HE SAID BOB, I 
WILL BACK YOU UP LIKE NO OTHER 
USTR HAS BEEN BACKED UP IN 
HISTORY, HE DID THAT, AND HE 
SAID NOT GO OUT THERE AND HAVE 
FUN. 
AND I SAID, IT'S PROBABLY NOT 
GOING TO BE AS MUCH FUN FOR MY 
SIDE AS IT IS ON YOUR SIDE, BUT 
I'M PROUD TO BE ON YOUR TEAM, 
I'M PROUD TO FOLLOW YOU THROUGH 
THIS AND THE OTHER TRADE 
CHANGES, AS YOU HAVE SAID, THIS 
AGREEMENT IS HISTORIC IN MANY 
WAYS, COVERING ONE $.2 
TRILLION, EASILY MAKING IT THE 
BIGGEST AGREEMENT IN HISTORY. 
WE HAVE DONE THIS IN 14 MONTHS, 
AND BELIEVE ME, AND TRADE 
NEGOTIATING TERMS, THAT IS LIKE 
WARP SPEED, WHEN WE BEGAN THE 
Ãº 
PRESIDENT'S INSTRUCTIONS TO ME 
WERE PRECISE AND 
STRAIGHTFORWARD, PROTECT 
AMERICAN WORKERS, FIGHT FOR OUR 
FARMERS AND RANCHERS, PRESERVE 
AMERICA'S COMPETITIVE 
INNOVATION EDGE, SECURE GREATER 
ACCESS FOR BUSINESSES, AND 
ABOVE ALL, BRING BACK JOBS TO 
AMERICA. 
I THINK WE HAVE SUCCEEDED WITH 
THIS AGREEMENT. 
THE USMCA  WILL ACCELERATE THE 
MANUFACTURING RENAISSANCE THAT 
OUR COUNTRY HAS ENJOYED UNDER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, BRING OUR 
TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO 
AND CANADA INTO THE 21st 
CENTURY, AND PROTECT AMERICA'S 
COMPETITIVE EDGE IN DIGITAL 
INNOVATION ACROSS THE ECONOMY. 
IT WILL ALSO SERVE AS A 
TEMPLATE FOR OUR TRADE 
AGREEMENTS UNDER THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION IN THE FUTURE. 
THIS PARADIGM SHIFTING MODEL 
RESTS ON THREE PILLARS, THE 
FIRST PILLAR IS FAIRNESS, WE 
HAVE NEGOTIATED STRONGER RULES 
OF ORIGIN FOR AUTOMOBILES, 
BRINGING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF 
MANUFACTURING BATCH AMERICA, WE 
HAVE SECURED GREATER MARKET 
ACCESS FOR OUR FARMERS AND 
RANCHERS, WE HAVE AGREED TO 
UNPRECEDENTED LABOR STANDARDS 
THAT WILL HELP LEVEL THE 
PLAYING FIELD FOR OUR WORKERS, 
WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO A FIRST 
OF ITS KIND REVIEW AND 
TERMINATION PROVISION. 
WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT THE 
USMCA, UNLIKE NAFTA,  WILL NOT 
BECOME UNBALANCED AND OUT OF 
DATE. 
THE SECOND PILLAR WILL CONSIST 
OF A HOST OF AMBITIOUS 
PROVISIONS ON INTELLECTUAL 
TRADE, PROPERTY, SERVICES, 
INCLUDING FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR 
COMPETITIVE EDGE. 
>>> THE THIRD PILLAR CONSISTS OF
ELIMINATING UNFAIR TRADE 
PRACTICES, STRONG DISCIPLINES 
ON STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES, 
CURRENCY MANIPULATION, 
RELATIONS WITH NONMARKET 
ECONOMIES AND MUCH MORE. 
WE WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY IF 
IT WERE NOT FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE 
WHO CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO THIS 
ENDEAVOR. 
FIRST, THE PRESIDENT'S KEY 
ADVISOR AND MY GOOD FRIEND, 
JARED KUSHNER, WAS MY PARTNER 
IN LEADING THE U.S. NEGOTIATING 
TEAM. 
I HAVE SAID BEFORE, AND I WILL 
SAY AGAIN, THIS AGREEMENT WOULD 
NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT JARED 
KUSHNER. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> I WOULD LIKE TO THINK MY 
COUNTERPARTS, AND THE MEXICAN 
AND CANADIAN GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE 
SECRETARY, THE AMBASSADORS, 
FROM CANADA AND SO MANY MORE, 
AND SO MANY MORE, AND THINK THE 
WONDERFUL STAFF AT USTR, MANY 
OF WHOM ARE ON HERE, I LIKE TO 
THINK OF IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE 
WE ARE THE MARINE CORPS, I LIKE 
THE NAME OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
USTR IS ABOUT 250 PEOPLE, 
DEVOTED, EXCEPTIONAL, WORKING 
ROUND-THE-CLOCK, MANY OF THE 
PEOPLE YOU'RE LOOKING AT SPENT 
MORE THAN ONE NIGHT IN THE 
OFFICE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
LAST FEW WEEKS. 
THEY HAVE ENORMOUS ABILITY, AND 
THE PRESIDENT HAS UNLEASHED 
THEM.
>>> FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO 
THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOUR 
LEADERSHIP, FRIENDSHIP AND GRIT 
MADE THIS POSSIBLE, NO OTHER 
PERSON COULD HAVE DONE IT. 
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL 
BENEFIT FOR YEARS TO COME 
BECAUSE OF THIS VISION, AND 
PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT, THIS 
GRIT, THANK YOU SIR.>> [ 
APPLAUSE ]
>>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BOB. 
SOME QUESTIONS? 
STEVE?
>> THANK YOU, SIR. 
YOU HAVE HAD TENSIONS WITH 
PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU, HOW DID 
THAT AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO GET 
THIS DEAL DONE? 
>> I DON'T THINK IT DID, HE'S A 
PROFESSIONAL, I'M A 
PROFESSIONAL, WE HAD VERY 
STRONG TENSIONS, BUT IT WAS A 
UNFAIR DEAL, IT IS A FAIR DEAL 
FOR EVERYBODY, A MUCH DIFFERENT 
DEAL, IT IS NOT NAFTA REDONE, A 
BRAND-NEW DEAL. 
I JUST SPOKE WITH THEM, WE HAVE 
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, WE WILL 
WORK AS A PARTNER, DON'T 
FORGET, THE REST OF THE WORLD 
IS LOOKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
US, AND AS A REGION, YOU MIGHT 
SAY, AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK 
VERY CLOSELY WITH CANADA AND 
MEXICO, BECAUSE WE WILL BE ABLE 
TO COMPETE WITH ANYBODY, WE 
HAVE THINGS THAT NOBODY ELSE 
HAS, WE HAVE ENERGY THAT NOBODY 
ELSE HAS, TIMBER, THINGS THAT 
NO OTHER PART OF THE WORLD HAS 
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE. 
WE ARE GOING TO DO VERY WELL 
TOGETHER, AND THERE WAS A LOT 
OF TENSION, I WILL SAY, BETWEEN 
HE AND I MORE SPECIFICALLY, AND 
IT IS ALL WORKED OUT, IT ENDED 
ABOUT 12:00 LAST NIGHT. 
HE'S A GOOD MAN, HE'S DONE A 
GOOD JOB, HE LOVES THE PEOPLE 
OF CANADA.>> YOU MENTIONED $267 
BILLION MORE TARIFFS AGAINST 
CHINA, WHAT DOES CHINA NEED TO 
DO TO AVOID THAT? 
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, WE 
HAVE LOST $375 BILLION IN TRADE 
DEFICITS, WITH A B, WITH UNITED 
STATES, IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR 
YEARS AND YEARS, WE REBUILD 
CHINA, THEY TOOK THAT MONEY AND 
THEY BUILT FIGHTER JETS, 
BRIDGES, MORE BRIDGES THAN 
WE'VE BUILT IN THE LAST HUNDRED 
YEARS PROBABLY, BIG ONES, LIKE 
THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE, 
BIG BRIDGES, AND LOOK, I DON'T 
BLAME CHINA, I BLAME OUR 
LEADERSHIP, THEY SHOULD NEVER 
HAVE LET THAT HAPPEN, AND I 
TOLD THAT TO PRESIDENT XI, I 
WAS SITTING CHINA HARD, AND I 
WAS IN CHINA, I SAID I DON'T 
BLAME YOU, I BLAME OUR 
LEADERSHIP FOR ALLOWING THIS TO 
HAPPEN, HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I 
MEANT, WE HAD NO DEAL WITH 
CHINA, I ASKED ONE OF THE TOP 
PEOPLE IN CHINA, A 
REPRESENTATIVE AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVEL CAME TO THE OVAL OFFICE, 
AND I ASKED HIM, HOW DID THIS 
HAPPEN, HE'S A PRO, HE DOESN'T 
HAVE TO BE CUTE, HE SAID NOBODY 
EVER DID ANYTHING FROM THE 
UNITED STATES, WHEN WE PUT ON A 
25% TARIFF ON EVERY CAR THAT 
COMES FROM THE UNITED STATES 
INTO CHINA, WE THOUGHT WE WOULD 
BE REBUKED, IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE
, NOBODY DID ANYTHING, THAT WAS 
YEARS AGO. 
WE CHARGE NOTHING, TO .5%, WE 
DON'T COLLECT IT, WE DO NOW BY 
THE WAY, SO THEY CHARGED 25%, 
WE CHARGED ESSENTIALLY NOTHING, 
I SAID HOW DID THAT HAPPEN, HE 
SAID NOBODY EVER CALLED, WE 
DON'T HAVE A DEAL WITH CHINA, 
THERE'S NO DEAL, THEY DO 
WHATEVER THEY WANT, SO WE HAVE 
A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM WITH THEFT 
OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITH 
CHINA, A LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS 
WITH CHINA, PRIMARILY TRADE 
PROBLEMS, AND AS YOU KNOW, THEY 
ARE HAVING A MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT TIME NO, I DON'T WANT 
THEM TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME, 
AND WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN 
WE'VE EVER DONE, EVERYBODY 
TALKED ABOUT THE TARIFFS, 
TARIFFS ENDED IN 1913. 
AND THEY THEN WENT TO A 
DIFFERENT SYSTEM IN 1919, 
TOTALLY UNRELATED, IN 1928, YOU 
HAD THE GREAT DEPRESSION, FOR A 
LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS, NOT 
NECESSARILY OUR COUNTRIES WELL, 
BUT A LITTLE BIT OUR COUNTRY'S 
FAULT, AND THEN IN THE 1930S, 
THEY SAID WE BETTER START 
CHARGING TARIFFS, WE NEED MONEY 
TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY AGAIN, 
OKAY? 
SO I'M NOT ADVOCATING TARIFFS, 
I WILL TELL YOU THIS, OUR 
STEELE INDUSTRY IS STRONGER 
THAN IT HAS BEEN IN 25 YEARS, 
TAKING SIX MONTHS, BECAUSE I 
CHARGED THE DUMPERS, THEY WERE 
DUMPING STEELE AND ALUMINUM 
INTO OUR COUNTRY, I CHARGED 
25%, IT'S A LOT, IT COULD BE 
MORE, BUT IT'S A LOT, AND IF 
YOU LOOK AT U.S. DEAL, AND NUCOR
JUST ANNOUNCED A $1 BILLION 
PLAN, U.S. DEAL IS BUILDING 
EIGHT OR NINE PLANTS, EXPANDING 
THEM, I DON'T THINK THERE IS 
ANY INDUSTRY WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
TO STEELE IN THE LAST NINE 
MONTHS, 10 MONTHS, SINCE I 
REALLY STARTED DOING WHAT I'M 
DOING. 
IT HAS BEEN PRETTY AMAZING. 
ALUMINUM, ALSO. 
WE NEED STEELE, FOR DEFENSE, GO 
AND GET IT FROM ANOTHER 
COUNTRY? 
CAN'T DO THAT. 
SO WE NEED STEELE, AND WE NEEDED
BADLY FOR DEFENSE, I AM PROUD 
WILL HAS HAPPENED WITH THE 
STEELE INDUSTRY. 
GO AHEAD. 
SHE IS SHOCKED THAT I PICKED 
HER. 
IN A STATE OF SHOCK.>> I'M NOT, 
THANK YOU.
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> IN A TWEET THIS WEEKEND, YOU 
SAID IT IS INCORRECT TO SAY YOU 
ARE LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION.>> WHAT DOES 
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH TRADE?
>> IT HAS TO DO WITH THE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION.
>> I DON'T ANSWER THAT RIGHT 
NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER 
QUESTION? 
>> DO YOU THINK IT WILL GET 
THROUGH CONGRESS? 
>> IT IS FAIR ON BOTH SIDES, 
INDUSTRY LOVES IT, BUT 
REPUBLICANS LOVE IT, IF IT IS 
FAIR, IT WILL PASS, I THINK IT 
WILL PASS REALLY EASILY, IT'S A 
GREAT DEAL, NAFTA PASSED, ONE 
OF THE WORST DEALS I'VE EVER 
SEEN, INCONCEIVABLE THAT IT WAS 
MADE. 
I WILL GET BACK TO YOU YOU ON 
THE KAVANAUGH THING. 
I WILL CALL YOU A SECOND TIME, 
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
>> YOU HAVE DESCRIBED INDIA AS 
A TIER OF KING, CAN YOU 
EXPLAIN? 
>> INDIA CHARGES TREMENDOUS 
TARIFFS, IF WE SEND HARLEY-
DAVIDSON'S, MOTORCYCLES, OTHER 
THINGS TO INDIA, THEY CHARGE 
VERY HIGH TARIFFS, I'VE TALKED 
TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND HE 
WILL REDUCE THEM TREMENDOUSLY, 
HE SAID NOBODY EVER SPOKE TO ME.
IN OTHER WORDS, WE'VE HAD 
LEADERS HERE, I'M NOT TRYING TO 
BE OVERLY DRAMATIC, WE'VE HAD 
PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND TRADE REPRESENTATIVES, THEY 
NEVER SPOKE TO INDIA, BRAZIL'S 
ANOTHER ONE, THAT'S A BEAUTY, 
THEY CHARGES WHATEVER THEY WANT.
IF YOU ASK SOME OF THE 
COMPANIES, THEY SAY BRAZIL IS 
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST IN THE 
WORLD, WE DON'T CALL THEM AND 
SAY HEY, YOU ARE TREATING ARE 
COMPANIES UNFAIRLY, OUR COUNTRY 
UNFAIRLY, INDIA IS A VERY HIGH 
TARIFF COUNTRY. 
ON MOTORCYCLES, IT WAS 100%. 
IF YOU SEND A MOTORCYCLE TO 
INDIA, THERE IS A 100% TARIFF, 
THAT IS SO HIGH, IT'S LIKE A 
BARRIER, IN OTHER WORDS, WHOSE 
GOING TO BUY IT. 
THEY HAVE REDUCED IT 
SUBSTANTIALLY, BUT STILL TOO 
HIGH. 
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA IS 
GREAT, WITH PRIME MINISTER -- 
THE PRIME MINISTER. THEY CALLED 
US TO MAKE A DEAL, SHOCKING TO 
PEOPLE. 
GO AHEAD.
>> I DO HAVE A SECOND QUESTION 
ON THE KAVANAUGH THING WHEN YOU 
GET BACK TO IT. 
YOU WILL TAKE THAT NOW? 
>> NO, LET'S STAY ON TRADE.
>> DOES THIS MEAN THE END OF 
TARIFFS, IF YOU CAN SPELL THAT 
OUT FOR CANADA? 
DO YOU THINK IT WILL PASS?
>> NO, THE STEAL IS STAYING 
WHERE IT IS, AND ALUMINUM, BUT 
IT MEANS WE PROBABLY FOR THE 
MOST PART WON'T BE NEEDING TO 
USE TARIFFS, IF WE CAN'T MAKE A 
DEAL WITH THE EU, WE WILL 
RESPECTFULLY PUT TARIFFS ON THE 
CARS, THE UNITED STATES WILL 
TAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO 
ITS COFFERS, YOU DON'T HEAR 
THAT.
>> ONLY FROM CARL SAVING -- 
CARL SAGAN.
>> YES, HIM, THEY WON'T HAVE TO 
PAY THE 20% OR 25% TAX. 
THERE WILL BE CASES WORRY OF 
COUNTRIES THAT WILL BE NOT 
WILLING TO DO WHAT IS FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL, AND IN THAT CASE 
THEY WILL PAY TARIFFS, AND THE 
U.S. WILL DO VERY WELL, EITHER 
WAY.
>> DO YOU THINK IT WILL PASS IN 
CANADA AND MEXICO, AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY HERE IN THE UNITED 
STATES?>> I DON'T KNOW, WE MADE 
A GOOD DEAL, THE PRIME MINISTER,
THEY ARE SATISFIED WITH THE 
DEAL, GOOD FOR CANADA, MEXICO, 
GOOD FOR ALL THREE. 
THIS IS GOOD FOR ALL THREE, AND 
JUST THAT FACT MAKES IT GOOD 
FOR US, BUT THIS IS GOOD FOR 
ALL THREE, THIS IS A MUCH 
DIFFERENT DEAL THAN NAFTA, MUCH 
MORE OF A RECIPROCAL DEAL FOR 
THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS 
GOOD. 
GO AHEAD, PETER.
>> WILL YOU TAKE ANY KAVANAUGH 
QUESTIONS? 
>> YOU TALK ABOUT BEING TREATED 
HARSHLY, WE WILL DO THAT IN A 
COUPLE OF MINUTES. 
LET'S FINISH UP TRADE, WE'VE 
GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 
RUN TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
AND START WRITING.>> CAN YOU 
TAKE ONE FROM A MEXICAN 
JOURNALIST?
>> YES. 
>> YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP THE 
TARIFFS ON STEELE ON MEXICO AND 
CANADA? 
>> UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT WE CAN 
DO SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 
DIFFERENT, LIKE QUARTERS, SO 
THAT OUR INDUSTRY IS PROTECTED, 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW OUR 
STEELE INDUSTRY DOES DISAPPEAR, 
IT WAS ALMOST GONE, I TELL YOU 
WHAT, IF OUR COUNTRY KEPT GOING 
THE WAY IT WAS GOING, WITHIN 
TWO YEARS YOU WOULDN'T OF HAD A 
STEELE INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO 
HAVE THAT, SOME INDUSTRIES ARE 
IMPORTANT, WE ARE WORKING ON 
THAT NOW, THAT WAS NOT PART OF 
THIS, IN FACT BOB, YOU MIGHT 
WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF WORDS 
ABOUT THAT, LITERALLY WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THAT ONE HOUR 
AGO? 
>> THANK YOU, FIRST OF ALL, TWO 
SEPARATE THINGS AS FAR AS WE 
ARE CONCERNED, WE KNOW THERE 
ARE OF GREAT INTEREST TO BOTH 
COUNTRIES, WE ARE ENGAGING IN 
TALKS WITH AN EFFORT TO 
PRESERVE THE EFFECT OF OUR 
PROGRAM AND STILL TAKE CARE OF 
THEIR NEEDS, AND HOPEFULLY WE 
WILL BE ABLE TO WORK THAT OUT, 
WE ARE IN COMMUNICATION.
>> AND TAKE CARE OF THE NEEDS 
OF OUR STEELE COMPANIES, I 
DON'T WANT PLANTS CLOSING, THEY 
ARE HIRING THOUSANDS OF WORKERS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
>> THE ASSURANCES WERE GIVEN TO 
LOPEZ OBRADOR. 
>> WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD 
UNDERSTANDING. 
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
>> JUST HOPING YOU CAN 
REITERATE ON THE TARIFFS, WHAT 
SPECIFICALLY WOULD IT TAKE FOR 
CANADA OR MEXICO TO BE EXEMPT 
FROM THESE TARIFFS? 
AND SECONDLY, DID YOU CONSIDER 
DAIRY AS THE DEALBREAKER? 
>> YES, FOR OUR FARMERS, IT HAS 
OPENED UP MUCH MORE. 
I KNOW THEY CAN'T OPEN IT 
COMPLETELY, THEY HAVE FARMERS, 
ALSO, THEY CAN'T BE OVERRUN, I 
DO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE LIMITS, 
BUT THEY COULD DO BETTER, WE 
HAVE OPENED IT UP FOR OUR 
FARMERS, SO THE FOLKS UP IN 
WISCONSIN, I WENT TO WISCONSIN, 
IOWA, JONI KNOWS BETTER THAN 
ANYBODY, AND SCOTT WALKER, I 
THINK IS A FANTASTIC GOVERNOR, 
TALKS ABOUT IS ALL THE TIME, 
THAT OUR FARMERS WERE NOT 
TREATED WELL, THEY WILL BE 
TREATED WITH RESPECT AND FAIRLY.
AS I SAY, IN THAT RECIPROCAL 
WAY, VERY IMPORTANT. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> THANK YOU, SEEING THAT THERE 
WAS GIVE-AND-TAKE ON BOTH 
SIDES, I WONDER WHAT WOULD BE 
YOUR BIGGEST CONCESSION TO 
CANADA, AND WHY YOU DECIDED TO 
MAKE THAT CONCESSION? 
IF YOU COULD DIVE A BIT MORE 
INTO YOUR THOUGHTS ON JUSTIN 
TRUDEAU, THE TENSIONS, 
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, WHAT 
YOU HAVE LEARNED ABOUT HIM, AND 
WHAT THE STATE OF THE 
RELATIONSHIP IS WITH HIM TODAY 
AND GOING FORWARD?
>> MY BIGGEST CONCESSION WOULD 
BE MAKING THE DEAL. 
BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONE THAT 
PEOPLE COME AND WANT TO TAKE 
FROM. 
I AM TALKING ABOUT EVERY 
COUNTRY. 
THAT GIVES US A TREMENDOUS 
ADVANTAGE IN NEGOTIATING THAT 
WE NEVER USED BEFORE WITH PAST 
ADMINISTRATIONS. 
WE NEVER USED IT, EVERY DEAL WE 
HAVE IS A LOSER, YOU CAN LOOK 
AT ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN THE 
WORLD, WE HAVE TRADE DEFICITS, 
WE LOSE WITH EVERYBODY. 
I THINK MY BIGGEST CONCESSION 
WAS MAKING THE DEAL. 
BECAUSE WE COULD'VE DONE IT A 
DIFFERENT WAY, BUT IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN NASTY AND NOT NICE, I 
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT, WE 
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, I 
THINK IT WILL BE BETTER THAN 
EVER NOW, THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH 
JUSTIN, HE LOVES HIS PEOPLE, 
HE'S FIGHTING HARD WITH THIS -- 
FOR HIS PEOPLE, WE HAVE HAD A 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP, IT GOT A 
LITTLE BIT TESTING THE LAST 
COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT THAT WAS 
OVER THIS AGREEMENT. 
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. 
I THINK JUSTIN IS A GOOD PERSON 
WHO IS DOING A GOOD JOB. 
HE FELT VERY COMMITTED TO HIS 
PEOPLE, THAT'S WHAT HE DID. 
AGAIN, THIS IS GOOD FOR 
EVERYBODY, GOOD FOR CANADA AND 
MEXICO ALSO. 
YES, PLEASE. 
GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU, AS YOU MENTIONED, 
YOU WILL BE SIGNING THE 
AGREEMENT, AND COUNTERPARTS 
WILL BE SIGNING IT IN THE NEXT 
60 DAYS, THEN IT IS UP TO 
CONGRESS, YOU ARE VERY 
CONFIDENT, I GET THAT.
>> I AM NOT AT ALL CONGERS -- I 
AM NOT AT ALL CONFIDENT. 
CONGRESS, ARE YOU WILLING TO DO 
IT?
>> THE CONGRESS COULD BE 
CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS. 
>> THEY MAY BE WILLING TO DO 
THAT FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES, FOR
THAT, FRANKLY, THEY WILL HAVE 
2020 IN MIND, THE DREAM FOR 
2020, THEY WANT TO DO AS WELL 
AS THEY CAN, SO TRYING TO 
REJECT EVEN GREAT DEALS, A 
GREAT DEAL FOR A COUNTRY IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES, AND OUR 
WORKERS, I CAN TELL YOU WHETHER 
OR NOT THEY WILL OBSTRUCT OR 
RESIST, THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS 
RESIST, I SEE THE SIGNS, THEY 
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 
RESISTING, YOU ASKED THEM WHAT 
ARE THEY RESISTING, THEY SAY I 
DON'T KNOW, THEY SAID WHAT ARE 
YOU RESISTING, AND THEY WERE 
UNABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
SO I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT 
DELAY, OBSTRUCT, RESIST, AFTER 
THE SELECTION, AND I THINK WE 
WILL DO WELL, ALTHOUGH HISTORY 
S NOT ON OUR SIDE, AND 
HISTORY, GENERALLY WHOEVER HAS 
THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T DO WELL 
IN MIDTERMS, BUT THE ONE 
DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE HAVE THE 
GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY, THAT IS A BIG 
DIFFERENCE. 
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS, 
AND PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR ME, 
I'M NOT ON THE TICKET, BUT 
CONGRESS IS ON THE TICKET, I 
TRY TO TELL MY PEOPLE THAT IS 
THE SAME THING AS ME, IN A 
SENSE, THINK OF IT AS THE SAME 
THING AS ME. 
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL,
WE HAVE SENATE RACES THAT WERE 
NOT EVEN IN PLAY SIX MONTHS AGO,
WHEN I STARTED LOOKING AT IT 
CLOSELY, I WON'T MENTION NAMES, 
BUT SENATORS THAT WERE NOT IN 
PLAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT, NUMEROUS ONES, THEY WERE 
NOT IN PLAY, IN OTHER WORDS, 
LET'S NOT GO HERE, THIS DAY, 
FOR FIVE STATES, THERE LIKE 
EVEN RACES, IN ONE CASE OF TWO 
POINTS, BUT WHO KNOWS, AS YOU 
KNOW, A LOT OF REPRESSION 
POLES, OR ONES THAT ARE NOT 
VERY ACCURATE, -- POLLS. WE HAD 
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS, TOO. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING 
ON, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE 
BROADCAST THAT WAY, BUT I HAD 
THAT WITH MY ELECTION. 
THEY WERE TELLING ME I WAS IN 
TROUBLE IN CERTAIN STATES, AND 
I END UP WINNING IN A LANDSLIDE.
AND I KNEW I WAS GOING TO, BUT 
THEY WOULD NOT REPORT IT THAT 
WAY, DO YOU KNOW WHY? 
FAKE NEWS. 
RIGHT BEHIND YOU. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THE TRADE 
AGREEMENT WILL BE A MAJOR ISSUE 
IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS?>> IT 
SHOULD BE, IT IS A GOOD 
AGREEMENT. 
SOME PEOPLE SAID EXTEND NAFTA, 
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A DISASTER, 
WE ARE LOSING $100 BILLION A 
YEAR IN DEFICITS, AT LEAST, TO 
MEXICO, UNDER NAFTA, BUT JUST 
LOOK AT THE RESULTS, AND A 
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT TO CANADA, 
ALTHOUGH PEOPLE SAY IT'S EVEN, 
IT'S NOT EVEN, WE LOSE A 
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT. 
IT IS A HARD THING TO DEFEND. 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND 
THE WORLD OF POLITICS I THINK 
AS WELL AS ANYBODY, I HAVEN'T 
BEEN DOING IT THAT LONG, BUT 
ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN, I'VE BEEN 
DOING IT ON THE OTHER SIDE, I 
DO UNDERSTAND, THEY CAN TAKE 
THE GREATEST THING EVER DONE, 
AND TRY TO MAKE IT SOUND AS BAD 
AS POSSIBLE. 
THIS ONE IS TOUGH, PEOPLE ARE 
COMING OUT FOR THIS ONE AND 
SAYING THAT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT 
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. 
YES, BEHIND YOU? 
>> THANK YOU, NOW THAT YOU HAVE 
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ON 
TRADE, I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
>> WE WILL DO ONE MORE QUESTION 
ON TRADE. 
SOMEBODY IS BEFORE YOU, EXCUSE 
ME, DON'T DO THAT, DO YOU HAVE 
A QUESTION ON TRADE?
>> MY QUESTION IS ON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, YOU SAID THE FBI 
SHOULD INTERVIEW ANYBODY WHO IS 
APPROPRIATE, DOES THAT INCLUDE 
JULIE SWETNICK? 
>> CAN YOU DO A QUESTION, ON 
TRADE? 
>> AND THE WALL, OUT DOES IT 
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE 
TRADE AGREEMENT QUICK 
>> WE'VE GOTTEN ONE $.6 
BILLION, WE'VE DONE A LOT OF 
WORK, I CAN BUILD IT QUICKLY AT 
ONE TIME, WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING 
IT OVER THE LAST ONE HALF YEARS,
WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE $.6 
BILLION, I'VE GOT A BIG 
DECISION TO MAKE AFTER THE 
ELECTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT 
WE GO FORWARD, BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
WHAT, BORDER SECURITY TO THE 
PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, VERY 
IMPORTANT, THE WALL IS A BIG 
FACTOR. 
I BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF 
OUR COUNTRY, THEY DON'T WANT 
CRIME POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY, 
THEY DON'T ONE MS-13 POURING 
INTO HER COUNTRY, THEY DON'T 
WANT THAT, AND I THINK I HAVE A 
BIG DECISION TO MAKE SOME TIME 
AFTER THE ELECTION, VERY 
QUICKLY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT 
COMES DUE AFTER THE ELECTION, 
DO I WANT TO DO IT BEFORE THE 
ELECTION? 
PERSONALLY, YES, BUT I DON'T 
WANT TO DO IT FOR ANOTHER 
REASON, I HAVE VERY FINE PEOPLE 
RUNNING IN CLOSE ELECTIONS, IT 
MAY AFFECT THEM, I HAPPEN TO 
THINK IT WILL BE GOOD FOR THEM. 
OUR PEOPLE ONE SECURITY, THE 
WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY ONE 
SECURITY. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE POURING 
ACROSS THE BORDER. 
AND I TELL YOU WHAT, THEY WANT 
TO HAVE EYES, BECAUSE THEY WALK 
INTO THESE GANGS, AND THEY 
TREAT THEM LIKE IS JUST ANOTHER 
DAY IN THE OFFICE. 
THEY ARE ROUGH AND TOUGH, THEY 
LOVE OUR COUNTRY, I'M TREATING 
ICE GOOD, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
GOOD, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT 
TO TAKE CARE OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, OR THE MILITARY, 
SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A 
DECISION TO MAKE, VERY CLOSE TO 
AFTER THE ELECTION IS OVER, AND 
THAT WILL BE ON BORDER SECURITY 
AND THE WALL, BUT BORDER 
SECURITY, THE WAS A BIG FACTOR.
>> WAS THAT PART OF THE 
CONVERSATION AND THE 
NEGOTIATION QUICK 
>> YES IT WAS, WE TALKED ABOUT 
IT WITH MEXICO, A BIG PART, 
CERTAIN THINGS AND 
UNDERSTANDINGS WERE HAD, WE 
DON'T WANT TO MIX IT UP TOO 
MUCH, THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL 
AND A GOOD DEAL FOR EVERYBODY, 
BUT BORDER SECURITY, AND 
SECURITY GENERALLY IS A BIG 
FACTOR, AND ALSO WE HAVE DRUGS, 
SOMETIMES, SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S 
A VERY SIMILAR THING, TALKED 
ABOUT DRUGS WITH MEXICO, A VERY 
BIG FACTOR. 
VERY BIG, A LOT OF GOOD 
UNDERSTANDINGS, WE WILL BE 
DISCUSSING THAT WITH THEM. 
IT WAS A FACTOR, ABSOLUTELY, IN 
THE DEAL.
>>> OKAY, LET'S GO, PEOPLE ARE 
FALLING ASLEEP WITH TRADE I 
GUESS, TO MEETS THE MOST 
EXCITING THING YOU CAN TALK 
ABOUT, RIGHT? 
JONI?
>> YOU SAID THAT IS CORRECT TO 
SAY THAT YOU ARE LIMITING THE 
FBI RELATIONSHIP -- 
INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS IT, 
LIMITED IN SCOPE?
>> I SAID LET THE SENATE 
DECIDE, WHATEVER THEY WANT TO 
DO IS OKAY WITH ME, AND ALSO 
THE FBI, THEY SHOULD DO WHAT 
THEY HAVE TO DO, TO GET TO THE 
ANSWER. 
AT THE SAME TIME, JUST SO WE 
UNDERSTAND, THIS IS OUR SEVENTH 
INVESTIGATION OF A MAN WHO HAS 
REALLY -- YOU LOOK AT HIS LIFE, 
UNTIL THIS HAPPENED, WHAT A 
CHANGE HAS GONE THROUGH, WHAT 
HIS FAMILY HAS GONE THROUGH, 
THE TRAUMA, FOR A MAN THAT HAS 
NEVER HAD ANY ACCUSATION, HE'S 
NEVER HAD A BAD STATEMENT ABOUT 
THEM, I THINK HE WAS NUMBER 1 
IN HIS CLASS AT YALE, NUMBER 1 
IN HIS LAW SCHOOL AT YALE, AND 
THEN WHAT HE HAS GONE THROUGH 
OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS, IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
SO I WANT THE FBI, THIS IS NOW 
THE SEVENTH INVESTIGATION, IT'S 
NOT LIKE THEY'RE JUST STARTING, 
I WANT THEM TO DO A VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION, 
WHATEVER THAT MEANS ACCORDING TO
THE SENATORS AND THE 
REPUBLICANS, AND THE REPUBLICAN 
MAJORITY, I WANT THEM TO DO 
THAT, I WANTED TO BE 
COMPREHENSIVE, I THINK IT'S A 
GOOD THING FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
NOT A BAD THING, A GOOD THING, 
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WOULD 
LIKE IT TO GO QUICKLY, AND THE 
REASON IS VERY SIMPLE, SO 
SIMPLE, BECAUSE IT IS UNFAIR TO 
HIM AT THIS POINT. 
WHAT HIS WIFE IS GOING THROUGH, 
WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN ARE 
GOING THROUGH, IS NOT 
DESCRIBABLE. 
IT IS NOT DESCRIBABLE. 
IT IS NOT FAIR. 
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO DO TO ME, 
I'VE BEEN GOING FROM DAY ONE, 
LONG BEFORE I GOT TO OFFICE, 
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT, I THINK 
FOR ME IT'S LIKE A PART OF MY 
JOB DESCRIPTION, TO HANDLE THIS 
CRAP, BUT AS FAR AS -- THIS IS 
A MAN, IT IS NOT FROM HIS 
WORLD, IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO 
WANT HIM, AND I THINK THAT 
WOULD BE A SHAME, I'M WITH THEM 
ALL THE WAY, THE CHARGE MADE, 
OR SAID TO HAVE OCCURRED, 36 
YEARS AGO, AND NOTHING HAPPENED 
SINCE, AND I FEEL BADLY FOR ALL 
PARTIES. 
I FEEL BADLY FOR EVERYBODY, I 
FEEL BADLY FOR COUNTRY, SO BAD 
FOR OUR COUNTRY, BUT I WILL 
TELL YOU, I WATCHED THOSE 
SENATORS ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE, 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A 
DISGRACE, AND PARTIALLY BECAUSE 
I KNOW THEM, I KNOW THEM TOO 
WELL, AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY 
ARE NOT ANGELS.
>> ARE YOU'RE SAYING YOUR WHITE 
HOUSE IS PUT NO LIMITATIONS? 
>> WE ARE DOING WHATEVER THE 
CENTER IS ONE. 
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M 
SAYING, YOU DO UNDERSTAND, YOU 
JUST DON'T WANT TO REPORT IT 
THAT WAY, MY WHITE HOUSE WILL 
DO WHATEVER THE SENATORS ONCE. 
I AM OPEN TO WHATEVER THEY WANT,
THE ONE THING I WANT TO SAY, 
THIS STARTED ON FRIDAY, THEY 
HAVE WORKED ROUND-THE-CLOCK ON 
SATURDAY, SUNDAY, THEY ARE 
WORKING RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE 
COVERING A LOT OF TERRITORY. 
THIS IS THE SEVENTH 
INVESTIGATION OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
THEY STARTED ON FRIDAY, THE GUN 
LATE INTO THE EVENINGS, THE FBI 
IS REALLY WORKING HARD, PUTTING 
IN A LOT OF HOURS, SO HOPEFULLY 
THEY CAN COME UP WITH WHAT 
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR. 
BUT I AM GUIDED BY THE SENATE, 
I WANT TO MAKE THE SENATE HAPPY,
THEY ARE ULTIMATELY MAKING THE 
JUDGMENT, I HAVE ALREADY MADE 
MY JUDGMENT, THE SENATE IS 
MAKING A JUDGMENT ON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, THAT IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT THING TO DO. 
GO AHEAD PETER.
>> JUST FOR CLARITY, SO IN FACT 
IT IS UP TO YOU TO INSTRUCT THE 
FBI TO INSTRUCT THEM?>> IT IS 
UP TO ME, BUT I'M INSTRUCTING 
THEM AS PER WHAT I THINK THE 
SENATE ONCE. 
THE SENATE IS MAKING THE 
DECISION, AND I'M INSTRUCTING 
THEM AS TO WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING 
FOR. 
>> WILL YOU INSTRUCT THE WHITE 
HOUSE COUNSEL DON McGANN TO 
GIVE THE FBI FREE REIGN TO 
INTERVIEW WHOEVER THEY FEEL IS 
NECESSARY QUICK 
>> I HAVE SO INSTRUCTED HIM, I 
DID IT OVER THE WEEKEND, I 
DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD 
MISLEADING, IT IS A MUCH MORE 
COMPLEX SUBJECT THAN MOST 
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND, ESSENTIALLY 
I HAVE DONE THAT, BUT I DID 
ALSO SAY WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF 
WHAT THE SENATE ONCE. 
TO USE AN EXPRESSION OFTEN USED 
BY ME, WE DON'T WANT TO GO ON A 
WITCH HUNT, DO WE?>> JUST TO BE 
CLEAR, SHOULD THE UNIT -- THE 
FBI INTERVIEW ALL THREE OF 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSERS? 
>> IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ME AT 
ALL, I DON'T KNOW ALL THREE OF 
THEM, CERTAINLY THEY ARE 
INTERVIEWING 2, THE THIRD I 
DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT, IT 
WOULDN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL, I 
HAVE HEARD THAT THE THIRD ONE 
HAS, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS 
TRUE, I HAVE NO IDEA, VERY 
LITTLE CREDIBILITY, IF THERE IS 
CREDIBILITY, INTERVIEW THE 
THIRD ONE, BUT I WANTED TO BE 
DONE QUICKLY, BECAUSE IT IS 
UNFAIR TO THE FAMILY INTO THE 
JUDGE, IT IS SO UNFAIR TO HIS 
KIDS AND HIS WIFE, AS WELL.
>> HOW ABOUT FOR THE ACCUSERS, 
HAS THE PROCESS BEEN FAIR TO 
THEM? 
>> CERTAINLY WE GAVE THE DOCTOR 
TREMENDOUS TIME, WHICH IS GREAT,
SHE SPOKE WELL, BUT THERE ARE 
SOME QUESTIONS THAT HAVE NOT 
BEEN ANSWERED, LIKE WHAT YEAR 
WAS IT, WHAT DAY, WHERE, THE 
LOCATION, THE HOUSE, A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT THINGS, PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING WHAT'S GOING ON? 
WITH ALL OF THAT, YOU CANNOT 
SAY THAT WE'VE DONE ANYTHING 
BUT BE RESPECTFUL. 
AND I DO, I RESPECT HER 
POSITION VERY MUCH, I RESPECT 
YOUR POSITION VERY MUCH, I 
BELIEVE -- AND AGAIN, 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN THE 
SENATE, I BELIEVE THEY HAVE 
BEEN VERY RESPECTFUL TO THE 
DOCTOR, DR. FORD. 
>> ISN'T THAT WHY THEY SHOULD 
INTERVIEW ANYBODY TO CLEAR HIS 
NAME? 
>> ANYBODY THEY WANT, WITHIN 
REASON, THEY SHOULD INTERVIEW, 
BUT BE GUIDED, AND I AM GUIDED 
BY WHAT THE SENATORS ARE 
LOOKING FOR, THEY HAVE TO MAKE 
THE CHOICE. 
>> SHOULD BRETT KAVANAUGH BE 
INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI QUICK 
>> I THINK SO, I THINK IT'S 
FINE IF THEY DO, I DON'T KNOW, 
IT'S UP TO THEM, I THINK HE 
SPOKE VERY CONCLUSIVELY AND 
VERY WELL, IT HAS BEEN A VERY 
ROUGH PERIOD OF TIME, I 
GUARANTEE HE HASN'T HAD A 
PERIOD LIKE THIS, WHEN HE WAS 
NOMINATED, PEOPLE THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE QUICK. 
10 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE THOUGHT HE 
WOULD BE A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE, HIS INTELLECT, CAREER, 
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO 
GAMES, THEY TALK ABOUT ALCOHOL, 
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU 
HEAR, AND FRANKLY, YOU TAKE A 
LOOK AT -- WE WOULD NOT KNOW 
ABOUT THIS OVER THE LAST 20 
YEARS, OVER THE LAST PARTS OF 
HIS CAREER, WE WOULD KNOW ABOUT 
IT, HIGH SCHOOL, THEY SAID HE 
DRINK A LOT ONE EVENING AND 
HIGH SCHOOL. 
I TELL YOU WHAT, I HAPPEN TO 
KNOW SOME UNITED STATES 
SENATORS, ONE WHO IS ON THE 
OTHER SIDE, WHO IS PRETTY 
AGGRESSIVE, I HAVE SEEN THAT 
PERSON IN VERY BAD SITUATIONS, 
OKAY? 
I'VE SEEN THAT PERSON IN VERY 
BAD SITUATIONS, SOMEWHAT 
COMPROMISING, AND YOU KNOW, I 
THINK IT IS VERY UNFAIR TO 
BRING UP THINGS LIKE THIS. 
HOWEVER, WHATEVER THE SENATORS 
WANT, IS OKAY WITH ME. 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A 
DECISION, WHATEVER THEY WANT IS 
OKAY. 
GO AHEAD.
>> YOU SAID I HAVE BEEN DEALING 
WITH THIS CRAP FOR YEARS, WHAT 
DID YOU MEAN?>> I THINK THE 
PRESS HAS TREATED ME 
UNBELIEVABLY FAIRLY, WHEN I WON,
THE PRESS FINALLY GETS IT I 
THOUGHT, THEY WILL FINALLY 
TREAT ME FAIRLY, THEY GOT 
WORSE. 
THEY ARE WORSE NOW THAN EVER. 
THEY ARE LOCO, BUT THAT'S OKAY, 
I USE THAT WORD, BECAUSE OF THE 
FACT THAT WE MADE A DEAL WITH 
MEXICO. 
PLEASE, SIT DOWN. 
YOU ARE GOING TO BE NEXT.
>> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THERE ARE 
CONCERNS THAT HE MAY HAVE LIED 
OR MISCHARACTERIZED HIS 
DRINKING WHILE TESTIFYING, IF 
THEY FIND THAT HE DID, DOES 
THAT BAR HIM FROM BEING YOUR 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE? 
>> I WATCHED HIM, I WAS 
SURPRISED AT HOW VOCAL HE WAS 
ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE LIKES 
BEER, AND HE'S HAD A LITTLE BIT 
OF DIFFICULTY, I MEAN HE TALKED 
ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHEN 
HE DRINK, THIS IS NOT A MAN 
THAT SAID THAT ALCOHOL -- THAT 
HE WAS PERFECT WITH RESPECT TO 
ALCOHOL, ACTUALLY, GOING BACK 
SO MANY YEARS, I THOUGHT HE WAS 
EXCELLENT. 
THE INTERESTING THING IS, 
NOBODY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE LAST 
25 OR 30 YEARS DURING HIS 
PROFESSIONAL CAREER, THERE WERE 
NO BAD REPORTS, THERE ARE BAD 
REPORTS ON EVERYBODY IN HERE. 
MOST OF THE PEOPLE SITTING DOWN,
EXCEPT FOR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 
PENCE, BY THE WAY.
>>  
>> IF WE FIND ONE ON HIM, THAT 
WILL BE THE GREATEST SHOCK OF 
ALL TIME. 
THERE ARE BAD REPORTS ON 
EVERYBODY, I'M LOOKING AT 
PEOPLE, LOOK AT SOME OF THESE 
PEOPLE ASKING THE QUESTIONS, 
OKAY? 
LOOK AT BLUMENTHAL, HE LIED 
ABOUT VIETNAM, HE SAID FOR 15 
YEARS HE WAS A WAR HERO, HE 
FOUGHT IN DA NANG PROVINCE, HE 
NEVER WENT TO VIETNAM. 
HE IS UP THERE SAYING, WE NEED 
HONESTY AND WE NEED INTEGRITY. 
THIS GUY LIED WHEN HE WAS THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 
CONNECTICUT. 
HE LIED. 
I DON'T MEAN A LITTLE BIT. 
AND THEN WHEN HE GOT OUT, HE 
DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE AND HE 
WON ANYWAY, BECAUSE DEMOCRATS 
ALWAYS WIN IN CONNECTICUT, VERY 
CLOSE, THE CLOSEST EVER, HE 
LIED, HE'S UP THERE TALKING 
LIKE HE'S HOLIER THAN THOU. 
YOU KNOW WHAT, TAKE A LOOK AT 
HIS RECORD, WHEN HE GOT OUT, 
WHEN HE APOLOGIZED, HE WAS 
CRYING, THE TEARS WERE ALL OVER 
THE PLACE, AND NOW HE ACTS LIKE 
HOW DARE YOU. 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE JUDGE WHO 
HAS LED AN EXEMPLARY LIFE, 
GOING BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL, 
BECAUSE HE HAD BEER? 
I THINK THE JUDGE HAS BEEN 
PRETTY AMAZING ABOUT DESCRIBING 
HIS SITUATION WITH ALCOHOL AND 
BEER. 
TAKE A LOOK AT CORY BOOKER, HE 
RAN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY INTO THE 
GROUND, A HORRIBLE MAYOR, AND 
HE MADE STATEMENTS, WHEN HE WAS 
IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, WHAT 
HE WAS DOING, HE MADE THE 
STATEMENTS, NOW HE'S TALKING 
ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AND I 
COULD GO THROUGH A WHOLE LIST 
OF THEM. 
LOOK AT DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 
TELLING ME ABOUT TIME, DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN KNEW ABOUT THIS TWO 
MONTHS EARLIER, IF SHE WANTED A 
REALLY THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, 
WE HAD ALL THE TIME IN THE 
WORLD. 
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 
AFTER THE HEARING WAS CLOSED, 
ESSENTIALLY, SHE SHOULD OF SAID 
LISTEN, I HAVE A PROBLEM. 
I HAVE THIS REPORT. 
I WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO LOOK AT 
IT WHILE REDOING THE HEARINGS, 
WE HAD TWO MONTHS. 
NO, SHE DIDN'T DO THAT, SHE 
WAITED UNTIL WE WERE CLOSED, 
AND THEN SHE PROBABLY LEAKED IT,
BUT YOU KNOW, WHO AM I TO SAY? 
BUT SHE PROBABLY LEAKED IT, 
BASED ON HER VERY BAD BODY 
LANGUAGE YESTERDAY, BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY IN A SENSE, FOR HER 
TO HAVE WAITED THAT PERIOD OF 
TIME, AND AFTER YOU DEMOCRATS, 
AND I'M INCLUDING YOU, TOO, I 
CONSIDER YOU PART OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS, TO BE TALKING ABOUT 
WE ONE MORE TIME FOR THE FBI, 
IF YOU WANTED MORE TIME FOR THE 
FBI, WHY DIDN'T DIANNE FEINSTEIN
BRING THIS UP? 
YOU KNOW THAT SHE SHOWED THIS 
TO OTHER DEMOCRATS, SHE'S NOT 
THE ONLY ONE. 
SHE SHOWED THIS TO OTHER 
DEMOCRATS. 
THERE WERE MORE THAN JUST HER 
THAT KNEW ABOUT THIS BIG 
CONFIDENTIAL THING, IT WAS 
CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL THE HEARING 
WAS OVER, AFTER IT WAS OVER, 
THEY WENT PUBLIC. 
WHY DID THEY DO IT DURING THE 
HEARING, WE COULD'VE HAD ALL 
THE TIME IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW 
WHY? 
THEY ARE DISHONEST PEOPLE.>> 
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION, 
MR. PRESIDENT. 
SO IF HE DID LIE ABOUT HIS 
DRINKING, DOES THAT MEAN YOU 
WILL PULL HIS NOMINATION? 
>> I DON'T THINK HE DID, I'M 
JUST SAYING, I'M NOT A DRINKER, 
I CAN HONESTLY SAY I'VE NEVER 
HAD A BEER IN MY LIFE. 
ONE OF MY ONLY GOOD TRAITS. 
I DON'T DRINK. 
WHENEVER THEY ARE LOOKING FOR 
SOMETHING GOOD, I NEVER HAD A 
GLASS OF ALCOHOL, FOR WHATEVER 
REASON. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I HAD, WHAT 
A MESS I BE? 
I'D BE THE WORLD'S WORST. 
I NEVER DRINK. 
I CAN TELL YOU, I WATCHED THAT 
HEARING, AND I WATCHED A MAN 
SAYING THAT HE DID HAVE 
DIFFICULTY AS A YOUNG MAN WITH 
DRINK, THE ONE QUESTION I DID 
NOT ASK, HOW ABOUT THE LAST 20 
YEARS, HAVE YOU HAD DIFFICULTY 
IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, NOBODY 
SAID BUT -- ANYTHING BAD ABOUT 
HIM, THEY GO BACK TO HIGH 
SCHOOL, I GRADUATED FROM HIGH 
SCHOOL, WHILE I DID NOT DRINK, 
I SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE DRINKING, 
THEY WOULD DRINK BEER, GO 
CRAZY, HIGH SCHOOL, 16, 17 
YEARS OLD, AND I SAW A LOT OF 
IT. 
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T 
DO SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO 
DO WITH YOUR LIFE? 
IT IS A TOUGH THING. 
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HE WAS 
VERY STRONG ON THE FACT THAT HE 
DRINK A LOT, SO I DON'T KNOW IF 
THERE IS A BIG DISCREPANCY. 
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
>> CAN YOU PROMISE THAT -- 
>> YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH, GO AHEAD, 
PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, 
JUDGE TARTT -- JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
SAID HE WAS TARGETED BY 
DEMOCRATS, HAS HE MADE THIS 
POLITICAL? 
HOW CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT HE 
WILL HAVE IMPARTIAL DECISIONS? 
>> HE IS A GOOD MAN WITH A 
GREAT FAMILY, HE HAS BEEN 
TREATED HORRIBLY. 
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS, I THOUGHT 
TERRIFIC, THE OTHER DAY, HE 
BROUGHT UP ONE POINT THAT IS 
NOW BEING DISCUSSED BY A LOT OF 
PEOPLE, AND THAT IS, WHO IS 
GOING TO WANT TO RUN FOR 
OFFICE, BE IN OFFICE, TAKEN 
APPOINTMENT, NOT JUST SUPREME 
COURT, BUT MANY POSITIONS. 
I HAVE 360 PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT 
BEING APPROVED, VERY QUALIFIED, 
NO ONE SAYING THEY'RE NOT 
QUALIFIED, BUT SENATOR SCHUMER 
IS NOT PASSING THEM BECAUSE OF 
OBSTRUCTION. 
IT IS FAR MORE PEOPLE THAN 
ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY, MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE 
ARE ROUTINE APPROVALS, THEY 
GAVE UP JOBS, THEY GAVE UP 
THEIR LIFE TO COME AND SERVE 
OUR COUNTRY, AND CHUCK SCHUMER 
AND HIS GROUP WON'T APPROVE 
THEM, THEY ARE SLOW WALKING 
THEM, A 30 HOURS MEETING, A 
PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE 
APPROVED, IT'S A DISGRACE. 
SO WHEN THE JUDGE BRINGS UP -- 
WHETHER IT IS POLITICS OR NOT, 
I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE HAS BEEN 
TREATED REALLY HORRIBLY.
>> BUT ARE YOU CONCERNED? 
>> NO CUP YOU KNOW WHAT I'M 
CONCERNED ABOUT, THAT WE GET 
GREAT PEOPLE ON THE U.S. 
SUPREME COURT, I WANT TO HAVE 
GREAT PEOPLE, AND I WILL -- I 
DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO CALL 
PEOPLE FOR ANY COURT AND HAVE 
THEM SAY IT'S A GREAT HONOR, 
BUT NO THANK YOU, I CAN'T DO 
IT. 
THAT WOULD BE A SAD DAY FOR 
COUNTRY. 
AND WE ARE GOING TO COME CLOSE 
TO THAT, I KNOW PEOPLE NOW, I 
DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES A, 
NOBODY KNEW A THING LIKE THIS 
COULD'VE HAPPENED. 
WHEN JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH SHOULD
-- GOT APPROVED, SHE DIDN'T 
HAVE THIS, YOU KNOW THAT MANY 
STORIES WERE PULLED BACK, 
CERTAIN STORIES WERE PULLED 
BACK THAT WERE HORRIBLE, WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING TO THIS MAN AND 
HIS FAMILY IS SAD AND BAD FOR A 
NATION. 
>> YOU SAID SOME SENATORS ARE 
NOT ANGELS, AND USE ALL MANY OF 
THEM IN COMPROMISING SITUATIONS,
CAN YOU TELL US WHO EXACTLY 
WHAT SITUATIONS? 
>> I THINK I WILL SAVE IT FOR A 
BOOK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, AND I 
WILL WRITE IT, I'M NOT GIVING 
IT TO YOU.
>> IF THE FBI FINDS OTHER 
WITNESSES WHO CAN CORROBORATE 
THE ACCOUNTS OF ANY ACCUSERS, 
WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH? 
>> I WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT 
THAT, I AM OPEN. 
I THINK HE IS A FINE MAN, I 
THINK HE IS A GREAT SCHOLAR, I 
STILL BELIEVED HIM, WHEN HE 
SAID WHAT HE DID, HE FOCUSED ON 
BEING NUMBER 1 AT YALE, NUMBER 
1 HIGH SCHOOL, AT LAW, HE 
FOCUSED, I CAN SO UNDERSTAND 
THAT. 
THE WAY HE SAID THAT, IT MADE 
AN IMPACT ON ME, SO FOCUSED ON 
BEING NUMBER 1 AT YALE, AND I 
BELIEVE HE WAS NUMBER 1 AT YALE,
UNDERSTOOD THAT VERY WELL.
>> I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT 
SOMETHING ELSE YOU BROUGHT UP 
TODAY, THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING, 
THERE'S SOME FRUSTRATION THAT 
MORE HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT BUMP 
STOCKS.
>> YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT THAT, IN 
ORDER TO ELIMINATE, TERMINATE, 
BUMP STOCKS, WE HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH A PROCEDURE, WE ARE AT 
THE FINAL STAGES OF THE 
PROCEDURE, IN FACT THE LAWYERS 
WERE JUST TELLING ME, OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, I WILL BE 
ABLE TO WRITE IT UP, RULES AND 
REGULATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE 
REALLY TOUGH, EVEN FOR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WE ARE 
KNOCKING OUT BUMP STOCKS, I'VE 
TOLD THE NRA, THEY ARE GONE. 
BUT TO DO IT, YOU HAVE TO GO TO 
PUBLIC HEARINGS, WHICH WE'VE 
HAD, ALL SORTS OF REGULATORY 
CONTROL SYSTEMS, WE ARE IN THE 
FINAL COUPLE OF WEEKS, IS OUR 
TURNING AROUND SOMEPLACE PLEASE?
HE SAID WE ARE IN THE FINAL 2 
OR 3 WEEKS, BUT IT IS A PROCESS 
THAT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR TO DO 
IT.
>> ANY OTHER ACTIONS, THAT 
YOU'RE PLANNING TO HELP PREVENT 
THAT? 
>> WE ARE WORKING WITH CONGRESS 
ON BOTH SIDES, WE ARE WORKING 
ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, 
THAT WAS A HORRIBLE THING, WE 
ARE WORKING ON BOTH SIDES OF 
THE QUESTION, THE BUMP STOCK IS 
ALMOST GONE, BUT TO DO IT SO 
THAT IT IS MEANINGFUL, THE 
LAWYER JUST SET IT, WE'VE GONE 
THROUGH A WHOLE PROCEDURE, YOU 
COULD CALL DEREK, WHO YOU KNOW 
VERY WELL, HE HAS GONE THROUGH 
THE FULL PROCEDURE, WE'VE DONE 
IT BY THE BOOK AND IN A SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME, BUMP STOCKS 
WILL BE RULED OUT, OKAY? 
YOU HAVE HAD ONE. 
YES, MA'AM. 
PLEASE. 
SIT DOWN.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, A FINAL TRADE 
QUESTION, SINCE STEALING 
ALUMINUM SERVES WON'T BE COMING 
DOWN FROM CANADA AND MEXICO, 
CAN YOU DISCUSS WHETHER THERE 
ARE MEASURES TO STOP THE 
RETALIATORY MEASURES?
>> THEY ARE NOT RETALIATORY, 
BUT THEY WERE DUMPING IN OUR 
COUNTRY, CHINA AND VARIOUS 
OTHERS, DUMPING VARIOUS AMOUNTS 
OF DEBT STEAL, IT'S CALLED DEBT 
STEAL, AND ALSO IMPERFECT STEAL 
-- STEEL. INSIDE WAS A LOT OF 
WEAKER THINGS, WHEN YOU HAVE 
QUANTITIES OF OTHER MATERIAL IN 
THE STEAL, -- STEEL, SO IT IS 
NOT JUST ECONOMIC. 
THE MINERS HAVE BEEN THANKFUL, 
YOU SAW THAT THE OTHER NIGHT IN 
WEST VIRGINIA, WE HAVE MET 
ALLERGIC COAL, AND OTHER -- 
METALLURGIC COAL, THIS IS NOT 
JUST FOR HEATING ELECTRIC, THIS 
IS USED TO MAKE STEEL, WE ARE 
MAKING STEEL, AND THE PRICE 
WILL END UP BEING LESS, WE 
DON'T HAVE THE SHIPPING 
PROBLEMS, WHEN YOU SHIP IT FROM 
PLACES SO FAR AWAY, YOU WILL 
SEE, WE WILL HAVE HUNDREDS OF 
NEW PLANTS OPENING UP IN OUR 
COUNTRY, COMPETING AGAINST EACH 
OTHER, OUTSIDERS WILL BE ABLE 
TO COMPETE. 
JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS 
GOING TO HAPPEN, THEY WERE 
GOING TO KNOCK OUT EVERY STEEL 
PLAN. 
THEY WERE GOING TO DOUBLE AND 
TRIPLE PRICE, A DANGEROUS 
THING, WE'VE EMPLOYED A LOT OF 
PEOPLE, AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
IS NOW FLOWING INTO OUR 
TREASURY. 
IN THE BACK, PLEASE? 
BEAKERS STAYING HERE ON TRADE, 
THE STOCK MARKET HAS MADE THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY, 250 POINTS 
UP, THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT THE THREAT OF 
FUTURE TARIFFS, IT COULD 
POTENTIALLY STIFLE A ECONOMY 
THAT IS HOT, A STOCK MARKET 
THAT IS HOT, BUT ONCE AGAIN, AS 
IT RELATES TO CHINA, MORE 
TARIFFS CAN COME DOWN THE LINE. 
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT YOU ARE 
SOMEWHAT SUPPRESSING THE 
ECONOMY TO RUN EVEN FURTHER? 
>> NO, I AM USING THEM TO 
NEGOTIATE, HOPEFULLY WE CAN 
MAKE A FAIR AND RECIPROCAL DEAL,
WE HAVE A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO 
DO WITH CHINA. 
WHEN THEY DRAIN IS FOR $500 
BILLION A YEAR, WHICH IS 
PROBABLY THE REAL NUMBER, NOT 
INCLUDING THE THEFT OF 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER 
THINGS, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY 
THAT THAT COULD BE $300 BILLION 
A YEAR, YOU CAN'T LET THAT 
HAPPEN. 
WE ARE USING TARIFFS VERY 
SUCCESSFULLY TO NEGOTIATE, AND 
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A FAIR 
DEAL, WE WILL USE TARIFFS, BUT 
MEXICO, IF YOU LOOK AT MEXICO 
AND CANADA, THEY ARE WAY BEYOND 
THAT. 
THE NICE PART ABOUT THE DEAL WE 
MAKE WITH THEM, IS IT'S NOT A 
SPECIFIC PRODUCT, IT IS A 
PRODUCT ALL ACROSS THE LINE, 
WHETHER IT IS DAIRY, YOU SEE A 
LIST OF PRODUCTS, MANY 
PRODUCTS, THEY ARE ALL 
INCLUDED. 
ACROSS THE BOARD.
>> ONE MORE AND TRADE, IF YOU 
DON'T MIND?
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IF THE FBI 
DOES FIND SOMETHING, AND BRETT 
KAVANAUGH FALLS, IS THERE A 
PLAN B? 
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT A 
PLAN B, I HOPE HE GETS APPROVED,
AND I HOPE THAT THE REPORT 
COMES OUT LIKE IT SHOULD AND I 
WILL, I HOPE, BUT LOOKUP I AM 
WAITING JUST LIKE YOU. 
CERTAINLY, IF THEY FIND 
SOMETHING, I'M GOING TO TAKE 
THAT -- THAT INTO 
CONSIDERATION. 
I HAVE A VERY OPEN MIND, THE 
PERSON THAT TAKES THAT POSITION 
IS GOING TO BE THERE FOR A LONG 
TIME, I HAVE A VERY OPEN MIND, 
I JUST THINK HE'S AN 
OUTSTANDING PERSON WHO HAS BEEN 
TREATED HORRIBLY, EVEN IF YOU 
WERE GOING TO BRING UP SOME OF 
THE SUBJECTS THAT WERE BROUGHT 
UP, THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TREAT 
HIM SO VICIOUSLY AND VIOLENTLY 
AS THEY HAVE TREATED HIM.>> CAN 
I ASK WHAT ON TRADE? 
>> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH, 
THANK YOU EVERYBODY.>> [
