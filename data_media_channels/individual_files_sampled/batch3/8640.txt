♪ ♪ Laura: SUCH GREAT NEWS. MITCH MCCONNELL BOLDLY CANCELLED MOST OF THE AUGUST RECESS. HE WANTS CONGRESS TO WORK. CONFIRMED LONG STALLED NOMINATIONS. I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THOSE ISSUES IN IN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW A SHORT WHILE AGO. THANKS FOR JOINING US. GOOD TO SEE YOU. Laura: THE BIG AUGUST RECESS, TELL ME ABOUT THIS. CHUCK SCHUMER IS FINE WITH AS LONG AS THEY SPEND TIME ON HEALTH CARE VOTES. WELL, WE WILL BE CONFIRMING THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES. WE HAD TO FILE CLOSURE TO SPEED THE PROCESS UP 101 TIMES DURING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION TO SPEED UP THE CONFIRMATION OF HIS APPOINTMENTS. THAT HAPPENED ONLY 24 TIMES OVER THE LAST 6 PRESIDENTS. THEY MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM JUDGES AS WELL. EVEN THOUGH WE WIN THEM ALL, THEY ARE TAKING TIME. I WILL GIVE THEM PLENTY OF TIME. Laura: CHUCK SCHUMER SAID DEMOCRATS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF TAKING THE SENATE. YOUR REACTION TO THAT? WELL, I THINK IT WILL BE IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF OFF YEAR ELECTIONS 2 YEARS INTO ANY PRESIDENT. BILL CLINTON LOST THE HOUSE AND SENATE. OBAMA LOST THE HOUSE AND ALMOST LOST THE SENATE. IT WILL BE A KNOCK DOWN, DRAG OUT FIGHT. WE ARE OPTIMISTIC WE WILL STILL HAVE THE MAJORITY AND CONFIRM THE PRESIDENT'S APPOINTMENTS. IF WE LOSE THE SENATE, ON APPOINTMENTS TO THE CABINET AND ALL OF THAT, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONQUENCES FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION IF WE LOSE THE SENATE. Laura: OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY IN THE FUTURE? YES, THE ECONOMY IS ROARING. LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN DECADES. JOBS ARE CREATED. MUCH ATTRIBUTEED TO THE TAX CUTS BILL PASS THE LAST DECEMBER. IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE AN AMERICAN LOOKING FOR WORK. Laura: WHY WOULD PEOPLE VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN POCKETBOOKS? THAT'S OUR ARGUMENT AND THEY HOPE THEY SHARE OUR VIEW. THIS IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENT CRYING OUT FOR CHANGE. Laura: REPUBLICAN DONORS SAID UNLESS CONGRESS PASSES THE DACA AMNESTY, THEY WON'T GIVE A PENNY. ANY POSSIBILITY OF IMMIGRATION REFORM GETTING PASSED IN THE HOUSE AND THEN THE SENATE? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IN THE HOUSE. I WENT TO IMMIGRATION EARLY THIS YEAR. WIDE OPEN FOR AMENDMENTS. THE SENATE DIDN'T WANT TO PASS ANY PARTICULAR VERSION OF IT. I CAN'T SEE US GOING BACK TO IMMIGRATION THIS YEAR UNLESS THERE WAS SOME PROPOSAL THE PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO SIGN. I DON'T THINK HE IS ANYTHING WITH ANYTHING I AM SEEING. SHORT ANSWER NOT ON THE AGENDA IN THE SENATE. Laura: BOB CORKER AND OTHERS EXPRESSED THEIR DISMAY OVER THE PRESIDENT'S TARIFFS. THE PRESIDENT WON ON THIS ROBUST ECONOMIC NATIONAL PLATFORM. GOOD FOR THE SENATE TO TAKE ON THE PRESIDENT ON THE ISSUE OF TARIFFS? I DON'T THINK SO. I AM NOT THRILLED ABOUT THE TARIFFS, BUT WE WON'T BE PASSING SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN LEGALLY DO. Laura: THE IG REPORT THAT WAS DELAYED AND IS COMING OUT HAS LEAKED PARTS OF IT SAYING THAT JIM COMEY THE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR WAS INSUBORDINATE AND DEFIED AUTHORITY IN THE WAY HE HANDLED HIS JOB. AT THE END HE NOTIFIED CONGRESS AND CITED LORETTA LYNCH. ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT GIVEN WE ARE ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT HIS RECOMMENDATION WILL BE. WE HEARD HE IS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER. WE KNOW HE IS CONDUCTING THIS INVESTIGATION. I HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT THE LEAKS. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIS REPORT. I HOPE IT COMES OUT SOON. Laura: THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI ANDREW McCABE'S LAWYERS IS ASKING FOR IMMUNITY BEFORE HE TESTIFIES BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHUCK GRASSLEY. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? THAT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING. YOU COULD IMPLY WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO IMPLAY FROM THAT SORT OF THING. YOU ARE A LAWYER. I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING REQUEST. Laura: A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID DONALD TRUMP IS CALLING THE FBI INTO QUESTION. HOW DARE HE QUESTION THE FBI. WE LOVE THE FBI BUT THIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. I THINK ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL COME OUT SOONER OR LATER. THE IG REPORT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE INTERESTING. Laura: THE BIG QUESTION FOR ALL OF US COURT WATCHERS IS THE SUPREME COURT. THE DECISION COMING OUT KENNEDY AND THE MAJORITY. THE BAKERY CASE THIS WEEK. IF KENNEDY STEPS DOWN AND RETIRES, WHEN WILL THE SUPREME COURT HEARINGS BE HELD GIVEN THE TIGHT SCHEDULE WE ALREADY HAVE? THE CONGRESS MEETS UNTIL DECEMBER 31st THIS YEAR. IF WE GET A VACANCY IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO WE WILL DEAL WITH IT THIS YEAR. Laura: BEFORE THE NEW COURT TERM BEGINS? IT WILL BE HELD THIS YEAR. IF THERE IS A VACANCY IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO, WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO DO THE CONFIRMATION. Laura: ANY SENSE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NARROWED DOWN THE CANDIDATES TO 1 OR 2 PEOPLE? I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY ARE NOT BEING ABOUT THIS. I BELIEVE THEY ARE. IF A VACANCY OCCURS WE GET A NOMINATION QUICKLY AND DEAL WITH. IT'S NOT JUST THE SUPREME COURT. WE HAVE CONFIRMED 21 CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES IN THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. BREAKING ALL RECORDS. ONE 8th OF THE CIRCUIT JUDGES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED IN A YEAR AND A HALF. Laura: 8 STILL WAITING TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE? THEY WILL ALL BE DONE THIS YEAR. Laura: YOU HOPE TO GET THEM DONE THROUGH THE AUGUST RECESS? THIS YEAR. Laura: THIS IS THE ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY. HAVE YOU SPENT TIME WITH VETERANS INVESTIGATE WASHINGTON. VISITING WASHINGTON. MY DAD WAS IN WORLD WAR II IN GERMANY. HE GOT THERE AFTER D-DAY. IT WAS THE GREATEST GENERATION. ONE FELLOW TODAY WAS 100 YEARS OLD. HE WAS IN THE ORIGINAL NORTH AFRICA INVASION AND THERE WITH THE GERMANS SURRENDERED.
