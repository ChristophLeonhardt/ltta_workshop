actually meant to me like a once-a-week

60
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,240
treatment if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of dry hair</font>

61
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,590
and you want to really tame it because i

62
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,940
use this like every single time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wash</font>

63
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,580
my hair then you just put it on for a

64
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,720
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes rinse out like normal</font>

65
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,040
conditioner and it will leave your hair

66
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,960
feeling very kind of smooth and it's

67
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,750
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Capac because it's got keratin in</font>

68
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,220
it which I was talking to you earlier

69
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,810
you do know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the Brazilian blow</font>

70
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">dryers don't need yes not rude when I</font>

71
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,010
first of all why would it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> read ya</font>

72
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:49,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">know um and then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait tomorrow you</font>

73
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,530
know yeah the Brazilian blow-dry is

74
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,060
basically when they put keratin into

75
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,320
your hair and blow dry<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and it stays</font>

76
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,360
like that so even if you wash it you can

77
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">just let it dry naturally instantly</font>

78
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,989
smooth so it's got keratin in it it's

79
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as potent as a Brazilian blow dry</font>

80
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,320
but it will definitely kind of smooth

81
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,940
down your hair so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will help my</font>

kind of multi-purpose products so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

95
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,150
can use them because they retain the

96
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">pips I'm not trying to sound like i know</font>

98
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,090
either use them as an intensive

99
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,910
conditioner so if you wake up his

100
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">morning and you have say like half an</font>

101
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,519
hour before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to get the shower</font>

102
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,380
you have your breakfast pop like a pump

103
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,790
of this in your hair in the ends on dry

104
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,170
hair it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look gross</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll look</font>

105
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,030
greasy and disgusting but then you wash

106
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,350
it out and it will leave your hair

107
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,209
feeling just really soft and smooth you

108
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">can then also use it as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a serum when you</font>

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,030
have wet hair when you get out the

110
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,890
shower so another pump through your wet

111
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,720
hair and then obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> blow-dry it will</font>

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,829
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it dry naturally whatever you want</font>

113
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,170
to do and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use it as a</font>

114
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,640
styling product to which I think we

115
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,399
should maybe do a little bit now and so

116
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,810
you just pump it out it's quite thin

117
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,180
Robert between your hands and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

118
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,310

119
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,389
insects in there you notice I I hope not

120
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,990

121
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,550
