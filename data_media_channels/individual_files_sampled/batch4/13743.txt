something that may not have you sleeping well at night and certainly doesn't have Hillary Clinton sleeping well at night is a story that is breaking out from the the Washington Post last night so you need a little bit of background to understand what exactly is going on here so first I have to explain you what the Trump Russia dossier is if you remember back to earlier this year BuzzFeed released a dossier that was full of information some of it more credible than others people have been saying that the entire dossier has been debunked that true some of the dossier has actually been substantiated some of the dossier has not the parts that were not substantiated included the absurd allegation that Donald Trump went to Moscow and rented a room that the Obamas stayed in and then had a bunch of rush Russian prostitutes come in and pee all over the bed right that was p8 if you recall this it was ridiculous we made fun of it and that of course is a not true or at least there's no evidence to that effect if there were then that would be the greatest political story in the history of mankind but it is not so in any case that saucier comes out from BuzzFeed earlier this year and it came out because it had been presented the dossier to President Trump released a summary of the allegations had been presented to President Trump by then FBI director James Comey just before Trump became president of the United States so where did this dossier come from the reason people were asking this is because there were concerns that maybe the Russians had basically been putting out bad info and that bad info had been used by the Obama administration as an excuse to wiretap all of Trump's friends right this is the allegations the allegation is and it's more of a conspiracy theory than an allegation that the Russians were using Christopher Steele basically as a cutout this is the the spy who's responsible for the compilation of the dossier that he knew that the Russians were giving him bad information he put it in the dossier which was funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign that saw CIA was then provided to the Obama FBI and the Obama FBI used that as an excuse to wiretap people like Carter page the the Trump foreign policy advisor or Mike Flynn the the one-time Trump national security adviser that's the allegation anyway there are a few pieces of evidence that have to be there in order for this allegation ultra one we have to show that Christopher Steele the spy actually is being played by the Russians number two we have to show that the DNC and Hillary knew the Christopher steel was being played by the Russians that would look like collusion right there the sort of collusion that Democrats have been accusing Trump of and three we would have to show that the FBI in bad faith went after people like Carter Paige and people like Mike Flynn based on evidence they knew was shoddy in order to target them that contention is is pretty extreme considering that again if the Democrats were really focused on just getting out bad information about Trump then why would this dossier not have come out and say September of 2016 like before the election it didn't so here is the full timeline on the Trump the Trump Russia dossier so Wikipedia actually has a pretty good timeline here so I'll use that as the basis for this in September 2015 there was a wealthy Republican donor who opposed to Trump's candidacy in the Republican primary so he went to fusion GPS and asked them to compile an apple research file for months they did ok then this Republicans owner after Trump won the nomination the Republican donor basically dropped out and that's when in April 2016 the investigation contract and funding was taken over by a law firm called Perkins Coie owned by Mark Elias or Elias he's the lawyer who represented both the DNC and the Clinton presidential campaign so the Hillary campaign knew the DNC knew they Hillary people are claiming they didn't know that's really not credible and it was not until after Elias came on board that christopher Steele was hired as the dossier compiler so the claim has been basically that even mark Elias didn't know Steele was the guy compiling the dossier that's a little bit weak in June 2016 it was revealed the DNC had been hacked by Russian sources so fusion GPS hired Orbis business intelligence which is a private British intelligence firm to look into the Russian connections and that investigation was undertaken by Steele that's how Steele gets involved he only gets involved after the Democrats take over the funding for the Trump Russia dossier he delivers his report in a series of memos from June through September he believed the FBI was not taking it seriously and so it ended up in the hands of John McCain among other people who brought it to the FBI and finally James Comey in January 2017 brings it to the attention of President Trump that's the timeline on the Trump Russia dossier so it is not correct when that when the media say that the Republicans funded the Steele dossier that's not technically true they fund at the beginning of the investigation before Steele was involved when the Republicans when conservatives say that this was obvious collusion between Hillary Clinton and the Russian government again no evidence to that effect in fact there is much more evidence that the Donald Trump jr. for example was attempting to make nice with the Russians then that Hillary Clinton was attempting to make nice with the Russians at least insofar as this she was attempting to make nice with the Russians in all likelihood with regards to selling twenty percent of America's uranium stockpile but with regards to gathering Trump Apple Intel research not any evidence to support that also the idea that the FBI was acting on orders from the Kremlin in order to get Trump that also seems like a bit of a stretch the reason that I lay all of this out is because I want you to have the truth about what exactly is happening here I think that there there's a lot of bit lies being told by both sides on the left they're saying this is no big deal at all you know the Oppo research shows Apple research what's the big deal the big deal is that if you knew and we don't know the answer to this yet if you knew the Oppo research was based on Russian Intel and the Russians were funneling that Intel to Christopher Steele then it looks like collusion so we just don't know the answer to that one yet on the right the same answer applies we don't know the answer to that one yet so you can't assume that such collusion was taking place in the first place so here's what the Washington Post reported and here's the key component okay mark Elias apparently lied to the New York Times about his involvement in the dossier so apparently he told Maggie Haberman of the New York Times who's not involved in the compilation of the dossier at all he suggested the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign did not fund the dossier that turns out to be false the Washington Post reports that last night the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about president Trump's connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin people familiar with the matter said mark Elias a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign in the DNC retained a fusion GPS a Washington firm to conduct the research after that fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele a former British Intel officers with ties to the FBI and the US intelligence community so Maggie Haberman was getting all sorts of crap over at the New York Times because yesterday after this came out she tweeted out quote folks involved in funding this lied about it and with sanctimony for a year now it just shows you that the rabbit left is just as bad as some of the more rabid people on the right that they went after Maggie Haberman tooth and nail for the so mark Elias lied to her she said he lied to me and she's the bad guy but she's the problem here Maggie Haberman who has been thoroughly thoroughly trump skeptical from the start in any case says fusion GPS officials had pled the fifth before the house Intel committee to avoid answering funding question so there's still questions why why was the the DNC and why were Hillary hiding this right that's the big question here why what do they have to hide because they were lying about it for months or taking the fifth like what's the big deal why didn't they just come up front and say listen sure we fund it an oppo research file sure Christopher Steele was one of those guys so so I mean if the implication is well they were using foreign sources to get their Intel we already knew that from hillery's camp they were using the Ukrainian government to gather for an Intel we know that political reported it last year so again the real question here is as always with the Clintons what are they trying to hide the Clintons are so bad at covering things up that whenever they cover things up the cover-up ends up being worse than the original crime right Hillary did this with regard to the the Whitewater papers Hillary's Hillary is still the only first lady in American history to be fingerprinted by the FBI Hillary Clinton did this with regard to her email chains right she deleted 33,000 emails then claims it was completely innocent every clumsy attempt to obfuscate the truth ends up making people more and more suspicious there's a reason to be suspicious around here there's a reason to be suspicious about all of this there's also reason to be suspicious because it's not like fusion GPS hasn't worked at the Russians before so William Browder is a businessman who pushed for sanctions on Russia he's testified in the past that the Russian government used fusion gps before to conduct a smear campaign against him personally Browder admitted he couldn't connect Russian funding to the anti-trump dossier which means president Trump's theory of FBI Democratic Russian collusion is not supported by the evidence but certain key Democrats did apparently lie about the fusion GPS report funding and the question is why so that question remains in open question and now the Democrats are pushing back by saying listen this is just an effort to discredit the dossier entirely well yes it is I mean by some people on the right I think it is a disingenuous effort to say that everything in the dossier has already been discredited as I say some of it has been discredited some of it has not but there are serious open questions on both side of this one what in the dossier is true to was steel being used by the Russians three did the Democratic Party know that steel was being used by the Russians and four why did the Democrats lie about all of this if it was just an innocent Apple research attempt right there so here is Adam Schiff was a very militant anti Trump guy California representative and he says that this entire this entire story is just an effort to discredit Christopher steel Christopher steel no matter who is paying for his services may have discovered before our own intelligence agencies that the Russians were going to interfere in our election on behalf of Donald Trump so we have a lot of work to do in terms of a lot of the claims in the dossier but it I don't think it really adds much value to know who paid for it necessarily and I view this as part of the effort to discredit him which really doesn't advance the investigation okay so Adam Schiff making the case that this is all just obfuscation well it may all be obfuscation but the Clinton in Minister Clinton campaign has some questions to answer now a lot of people are doing this routine like well Hillary Clinton is not president so who cares why is it a big deal if Hillary's not not president what exactly are you whining about and the answer is if she'd been president you'd be saying it's beneath her to answer these questions so wrongdoing is still wrongdoing and again it does shed light on the Russian collusion stuff if in fact it turns out that the FBI used this dossier as the basis to wiretap people like Carter page and Mike Flynn and it was done in corrupt fashion with the help of the Russian government we just don't have that information at this point any any suggestions to the contrary are not true okay any suggestions to the contrary that this the the conspiracy theories have been confirmed not true so let's not get out in front of the story okay I want to get to Jeff Flake resigning from the Senate in just a moment but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the US concealed-carry Association so we always hear the stories in the news about the guy who shoots an intruder in his house and we think that's the end of the

so the other big story of the day is the chaos that's broke now inside the Republican Party and it's also it's it's all around Jeff Flake as well as the as well as senator bob Corker so we talked about corker yesterday and the fact that corker is really kind of an oozy sleazy guy and that he and Donald Trump have now gone at it and so corker is is in opposition to president Trump somewhat conveniently and has decided who's not going to run for reelection now corker if you'd run for reelection probably would have won Jeff Flake is a bit of a different story I think the story that's being told to you by the media today is not true okay the story that's being told to you by the media today is basically Jeff Flake intrepid Trump fighter struck down in the prime of his young career because he stood up against the nastiest man in the universe Donald Trump Breitbart and Trump stand ascendant over the prone flex body as flake speaks the truth to power that's the story that you're getting and you're getting it from all sides you're getting it from flakes camp you're getting it from the Breitbart Trump people and you're getting it from the media and I have to say I don't think this story is even close to the full story so first let me express what I think the interests are for everyone in doing what happened yesterday so to move back a little bit Jeff Flake yesterday the senator from Arizona announced he would not run for reelection and then he gave a long speech just ripping into President Trump as well as Republicans who were who were you know basically soft-pedaling President Trump for a long time now it's a flex you know to flex credit in terms of consistency flake did not endorse President Trump during the last election cycle and was very critical of President Trump so I'm not saying that his opposition to President Trump is insincere I think it is sincere but I think the problem for for Jeff Flake is that he knew that he was going down and so for the past few months he's basically attempted to carve out a position as the anti-trump guy right the guy who's going to earn strange new respect from the left for saying things about Trump now I want to be fair here I've said a lot of the same things about President Trump Jeff Flake says about President Trump I agree with a lot of what Jeff Flake says about President Trump but the difference is that I also compliment Trump when I think he does something right and I also acknowledge that people voted for Trump not because they embraced trumpism not because they think the trumpism should replace conservatism but because Trump was the only tool on hand at the time remember Trump on a historic low percentage of votes in the Republican primaries to win the actual primaries he says I'll accuse well inside the Republican Party once he was nominated then the Republican Party swung behind him because he was the nominee against the most hated Democrat of my lifetime Hillary Clinton but that is not the same thing that Jeff Flake is saying what Jeff Flake basically said in the speech is the Republican Party is a bunch of deplorable right I mean he basically made the Hillary Clinton contention the Republican Party is a bunch of deplorable as who have fallen into league with Satan now again I think a lot of his critiques of Trump are true and I think that people I've been saying for a long time people need to be intellectually honest about what Trump is and what Trump isn't and they ought to call out lies and untruths and half-truths when they see them they ought to call out the vulgarities and the stupidities that emanate from the White House but that's not the same thing as saying that all Republicans are incapable of doing this and this seemed to be Flakes contention Flake was basically saying in this speech listen the reason I'm going down is not because of me it's not even because of Trump it's because the Republican Party has fallen into disrepair that Republican constituents my base the people who elected me our bunch of dunderheads it's not that they made a choice against Hillary Clinton it's nothing held their nose and voted for Trump it's not even that they like Trump but they can also critique him it's that they have fallen full-scale into under the sway of President Trump I think this is a wild overstatement I also think it's a politically convenient one so it's play flake speech and then I'm gonna explain what I think is really going on so his so flake gets up yesterday on the floor of the Senate and he says that he is not going to run for reelection he explains why sustained incumbency is certainly not the point of seeking office and there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles now is such a time okay so he says that now is the time for all men of goodwill to stand up except that he's resigning right he's not sticking around to fight Trump's bad agenda items he's not sticking around to run for reelection and try and you know wrest control of the party away from Trump know Jeff Flake is resigning so where exactly is the where where is he risking his career in favor of principles where was the risk like this is the part that I don't really buy okay the idea that he risked his career to to stop President Trump Jeff Flake has been the most unpopular senator in the United States Senate since 2013 okay so long before Trump was running for president long before he only cared about Steve Manon long before don't care about Breitbart okay the fact is that Jeff Flake was a very unpopular senator pretty much from the get-go there's an article in the Atlantic in 2013 that was titled how Jeff Flake became a most unpopular senator in the United States right four years ago before Trump was a gleam in the media's eye or bannon's eye and Bannon wasn't a gleam in the media's eye right the fact is that that Jeff Flake was already unpopular and the reason that Jeff Flake was unpopular is because he was a hard right congressman who won seventy-five percent of the vote in his district for several terms running and then he came to the Senate and he decided to move to the center the American Conservative Union points out as Senator as Senator flake score is 80% over four years as representative his score was 98 percent over ten years was a twenty percent drop off in the ACU score and it's not just that here's a list of some of his votes Jason Johnson who's a former Ted Cruz chief staffer he laid out a bunch of the votes here he suggested that that you know it's it's well here's what he says it's tempting to comment on flakes floor speech instead offering context on his view of governing by highlighting a few of his votes Jeff Flake was one of 10 Republican senators who voted to confirm Loretta Lynch for attorney general flake voted to fund President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty flake voted against Senator Mike Lee's First Amendment Defense Act flake voted for President Obama's one point one trillion cromnibus 2015 spending bill flake voted for s 221 14 which increased Russia's power at the IMF Flava flake voted for a clean debt limit suspension flake was one of only 11 Republican senators who voted to confirm Janet Yellen flake voted for the Ryan Murray budget which lifted spending caps and raised taxes in exchanges for promises of future spending cuts flake voted for the gang of eight amnesty bill flake voted for the post newtown gun grab flake voted against the defunding obamacare act of 2013 flake voted to increase debt by nine hundred billion dollars in exchange for the promise of discretionary cuts in the future in 2011 flake preferred John Kasich / Cruz or Trump in the 2016 GOP primary a so the point here is that Jeff Flake used to be a much more conservative guy and he moved to the center and as he did he lost the support of the people of Arizona but he looked disingenuous and so he lost that support so here he is saying that he's going down on the burning pyre of Trump that he's falling on his sword to done that he's basically the monk in Vietnam setting himself on fire to demonstrates in the entire world just how terrible President Trump is but that's not really accurate Jeff Flake was going to be primary who's going to run a very tight I marry no matter what now his opposition to President Trump hasn't helped him for sure but again I think that it's less about his opposition to president Trump and more about his opposition to the people who voted for President Trump and this is a distinction worthy of note okay you can oppose things that Trump does you can even say I don't think Trump makes a very good president you can do all of those things but what you can't do and and what he hasn't done you know Jeff Flake has not voted against Trump's agenda items most of the time the vast majority of the time Jeff Flake has voted with President Trump's agenda items so when he says that he doesn't like Trump it's really more a matter of what Trump says and what Trump does as president not a matter of policy so how that materializes is you can say I think Trump is is vulgar izing the discourse I think President Trump would be better off if he stopped doing this stuff I think President Trump is not a very good president he's not doing these things but that's not what flake does instead flake seems to go at his own constituents and he has been since April basically saying the Republican Party was subject to a takeover by a bunch of dholtze and morons and I don't think that that's particularly smart politics nor do I think it's true I really don't think that's true I think there are a bunch of people who voted for President Trump in the primaries who just thought he was the angriest guy in the stage and didn't think beyond that which I do think is not smart and then I think once we got past that there were a lot of people who voted for Ted Cruz in the primaries I voted for John Kasich in the primaries who also voted for Donald Trump for presidents to stop Hillary Clinton so flake continues along these lines and he decides that he is going to be the one who stands up to President Trump again I think some of this is like posturing the reason that I brought up his popularity ratings and his record is to demonstrate I think that the real story here for flake is this flake does have sincere opposition to President Trump he does not like President Trump he think President Trump is born of Vulgarian I think some of those critiques are fair I really do but what's really happening here is that flake was going to lose his primary anyway and now he sees the opportunity to go out as the tragic hero who sacrificed himself in order to throw himself on the gears of the tank to stop President Trump instead of just another senator who wasn't particularly popular in his home state and feels certain things about Trump so we said now he has an interest in basically blaming Trump for his ouster now Trump and Breitbart have an interest in in taking credit for his ouster because they say listen we run the movement now if you cross Trump we will toss you overboard right if you cross Trump if you cross Breitbart we will toss you again Kelly Ward's been running for Senate for well over a year Breitbart only gotten involved at the very tail end and bannon's only getting involved now the same thing is true in more in Alabama Bannon and Breitbart basically backed the guy who finished third Mel Brooks in the primary until they switched to Roy Moore and then they take credit I think Jonah Goldberg has a good line about this Bannon and Breitbart have a bad habit when it comes to these races of being the Rainmaker who waits for it was the first rule of rainmaking as Jonah says is wait for it to start raining and then start dancing right because then people mistake the dancing for the cause of the rain and I think that's exactly what's happened here so Breitbart and Trump have an interest in saying will you run the party now cross us and we'll burn you down I don't think that's actually real I don't think that's actually true I think that you can cross Trump pretty much with impunity actually as long as you don't say that people who voted for him were wrong to do so or not understandable it was under it was a foolish and ridiculous for them to do so or the racist sexist big and homophobes you sign off on everything Trump does because they voted for him that's you know that's lefty talk and it's not accurate either so the Trump and ban and I don't think are telling the truth I don't think flake is telling the whole truth and I think the media have an interest in this narrative too because it does a couple of things for them one it allows them to create this this perception that Trump is the evil manipulator behind the scenes the Palpatine behind the scenes making sure people like bob corker and Jeff Flake the true heroes are put to the boot and I don't think that that's that's interest number one and interest number two is they like portraying the Republican Party as split and so anything they can do to exacerbate that split they will do so here's Jeff Flake going after President Trump directly mr. president I rise today to say enough we must dedicate ourselves to making sure that the anomalous never becomes the normal with respect and humility I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner a return to civility civility and stability right behind it we know better than that by now we all know better than that yes oh there it is we all know better than no goodies coming around the corner again all of this is fair but I don't know why it's effective or useful like I I think that we all have our feelings about President Trump but I've been highly critical of President Trump but I do not know what the purpose of all this is and then and here's where he cast himself in the role of martyr here's where he does the Joan of Arc routine he's gonna hop up on that pyre and light the flame he says that you know this is not about political savvy this is about principle it's about principle well really about principle you'd stick around and run for reelection and see if you can convince the Republican Party to agree with your principles he's bailing out because he knows he's gonna lose here he is now I'm aware that more politically savvy people that I will caution against such talk I'm aware that there's a segment of my party that believes that anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a president who belongs to my party is unacceptable and suspect okay so that last line that did that my party believes anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a president who belongs to my party is unacceptable in suspects I think it's a pretty small segment of the party I really do I think the bill and the chills of the party the people who think that Trump cannot be criticized under any circumstances I don't think that's right I just don't think that's true I think there have been a number of Senators who have criticized Trump including Rand Paul by the way who's gonna win his re-election easily yeah you can criticize Trump so long as it doesn't feel like you're ripping his voters for voting for him again he continues along these lines and the martyr routine is a little bit strong here he talks about how principled he is even more if I have been critical it is not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the President of the United States if I have been critical it is because I believe it is my obligation to do so and as a matter and duty of conscience the notion that one should stay silent and that as the norms and values that keep America strong or undermined and as the alliances and agreements and ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into a hundred and forty characters the notion that we should say or do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavior is a historic and I believe profoundly misguided again people aren't saying anything against Trump is just absurd everyone saying things against Trump now listen I think some people have been cowards in this in the situation I don't want to pretend that everyone has been you know Paragons of virtue here I think Paul Ryan doing me I've never seen his tweets routine I think that Mitch McConnell doing me I'm just going to ignore whatever the president says routine I think that's wrong I think that they should speak out but again I don't think speaking out is the same thing as saying that you're gonna go down simply because you spoke out I don't think that's correct the reason I'm objecting so strenuously to this is because I know enough conservatives to know that we are a good-hearted party still that is attempting to do the right things and I think that criticism of President Trump so long as it's not taken as criticism of his voting base I think that people are willing to go along with it I think that what Jeff Flake is doing this is really what I objective I feel like what Jeff Flake is doing here is he's surrendering the party to Trump and to Bannon and to you know the the and to the media's perception of what the Republican Party is solely so that he can look as though he's a martyr to this new Republican Party said he can play you know saint st. thomas becket and against Henry Henry - like I just don't henry ii i just don't see I don't see the purpose of handing over the party - I don't think this is true I don't that I don't think that you have to hand over the party to everything Trump says and drawing this false dichotomy which is really what flake is doing here between the Bill Mitchell wing of the party and the true speaking wing of the party and you have to pick one of those two I don't think that's right I think that you don't have to agree with Jeff Flake on everything in order to criticize President Trump nor do you have to say that everyone who voted for President Trump is is going along with every element of his agenda in order to say that those people were voting for for some listen I disagreed with that vote right I didn't vote for anyone at the top of the ticket but at least I understood why the vote was happening and I'm not gonna attribute bad motivations to the people who disagreed with me on that vote I mean that's that's just it that's silly and that's what I feel like flake is doing and I've got to say it feels like some of this is for for posturing and personal gain considering him out with a book called conscience of a conservative four months ago and then did the rounds talking about how bad Trump was in the middle of a tough primary fight if you want to win a primary you don't go out there and then suggest that the party that embraced President Trump is a nasty terrible party what you can do instead is you can say they were misinformed which i think is true that they were lied to which i think is true that there were people who were were preying on a justified anger which i think is true but this is the equivalent of you know this really is the equivalent of remember when Hillary was asked whether she blames women who didn't show up to vote for her and she said yes of course I blame them it feels like some of this so it's convenient for Jeff Flake to do that while he's stepping down again this is not even me disagreeing with flakes critique of President Trump I don't think President Trump has been a very good president I think he's actually been very negative for conservatives in a number of ways that doesn't mean he's been that across the board I mean as I've said Gorsuch regulatory cuts right all these things are good but but I think that the the narrative that's being told to you right now is not true and I want to explain a little bit more about this and why everybody is trotting out this narrative in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our friends over at my patriots apply so right now if you are looking at the news and you see there's a wildfire in Northern California in Southern California and hurricanes in Florida and Texas in Puerto Rico it seems like everywhere there's some sort of natural disaster where the people there would have been in good shape had they only had some sort of emergency food supply or at least they would have in better shape if they had that's why you need to prepare okay get a 102 servings survival food kit for just 99 bucks from my friends at my Patriots supply includes breakfast lunches and dinners it shipped to your home for free order a kit for yourself now call eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen that's eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or go online to prepare with been calm again it's prepare with been calm the emergency food lasts up to 25 years in storage people in the office of tried it they say it tastes like home cooking eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or prepare with been calm again that's prepare with been calm okay so again the part of the problem with the speech is not that it was just an attack on Trump I don't care that's fine Trump doesn't like Trump I think deserves to be attacked sometimes I do a relatively frequent basis on the show but it's it's flake presenting himself as leader if you see that the founders were right about people the founding fathers basically said the reason they structured the Constitution the way they did is because they said people aren't ambitious people want power ambition should therefore counteract ambition right they should check each other if you see ambition as a prime mover in human motivation then you're more likely to understand the political dynamic every day so Jeff Flake is an ambitious guy right he's a senator of course he's ambitious and here he is trying to set himself up as leader of the sort of anti-trump conservative resistance even though he has not been supremely conservative as a senator by any stretch of the imagination he and John Kasich are sort of doing the same thing here and if you look at Steve Ben and he's trying to set himself up as the leader of trumpism even though there is no leader to trumpism because trumpism doesn't exist there is only Zuul right Trump is the only one who exists trumpism is not a real philosophy if you see that everyone is trying to set themselves up as leader you're more likely to understand what's going on so here is Jeff Flake trying to set himself up as leader in opposition to the bad evil terrible president Trump leadership knows that most often a good place to start in assigning blame is to look somewhat closer to home leadership knows where the buck stops humility helps character counts leadership does not knowingly encourage or feed ugly or debased appetites in us okay again you know the agree with a lot of this you know I've said it before that all politicians pander to anger their politicians make their Bank off of anger but his idea that I am the leader right that's that's the undercurrent here leadership knows this leadership knows that leadership know who who knows that I know that well that's amazing look at that coincidence he finishes up by and this is the part where I where I have a problem where he basically throws the entire conservative agenda under the bus saying I am the representative of that conservative agenda if I cannot survive as an anti-trump speaker then no one can survive the party's been taking over run for the hills I'm not ready to run for the hills I'm not ready to surrender the party to people who are anti free trade I'm not ready to surrender the party to people who are not just anti-illegal immigration as I am but anti-immigration generally as I am NOT right I'm not willing to surrender the party to I think the more basic instincts of some people I'm not ready to do that cuz I don't think that's my party I don't think that's my movement maybe I maybe maybe Jeff Flake is right maybe it's time for despair you know there's a lot of despair I think in the in the conservative the traditional conservative movement that the party has been soul sucked I feared that that was gonna happen when Trump took office I feared a little less now I don't think that the party has been soul sucked I don't think every conservative has become a Trumpkin on every issue I think that conservatives as I've said before see President Trump is a litmus test that if you are going to say that that Trump is is awful terrible no good very bad evil and unjustifiable and that any vote for him was a bad vote if you're gonna say that then that's not a referendum on Trump that's a referendum on all the people who voted for him it's the Hillary Clinton deplorable line all over the ghin you know I think that that is is a point that people are using Trump to elucidate I think people are using Trump is a bit of a litmus test but you can still oppose Trump when he does things that are wrong you can still speak up when he does things that are stupid and I think constituents mostly understand that because a lot of Congress people do that but here is the the final thing that Jeff Flake says that I ripped again this is the part I really disagree with this is why I think his motivations here are not entirely sterling it is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets who is devoted to free trade who is Pro immigration as a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party the party that has so long defined itself by its belief in those things it is also clear to me for the moment that we have given in or government given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfied anger and resentment to be clear the anger and resentment that the people feel at the Royal mess that we've created are justified but anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy there is an undeniable potency to a populist appeal by mischaracterizing or misunderstanding our problems the impulse to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful backward looking people okay so I agree with a lot of the statements that he's making about the appeal to anger I've said the exact same thing on this show I don't disagree with him but it's that set it's that first second that first sentence Ted that bothers me the anger and the resentment he's right they are not a governing strategy but he himself is suggesting that they are replete with a particular philosophy and I don't think that's right I don't think that's true the same anger and resentment that drove the Tea Party to victory based on a small government platform drove President Trump to victory based on a populist platform because anger does not have any philosophy to which it attaches exclusively anger it can be anti-establishment gore and that's what we're watching and that's why I have hope for the future of the conservative movement because I think that that anger can be turned and should be turned toward the right things not the wrong things I think president Trump has turned things toward the wrong things I think he's turned anger toward things that are unjustified I think that he has excused bad behavior I think that he has made the case on philosophically false grounds that the American people are being screwed by people who really have nothing to do with it I think all of those things are true but the idea that that that represents that the the trumpism is the final iteration of Americans anger that trumpism is the final stage of Republican anger I don't think that's right I think Trump was the most convenient angry guy at their disposal and they picked them and it's that simple it's not that they have rejected limited government and free markets it's not that they've rejected limited government in free markets I agree that anger cannot be the prime motivator for conservative thought but to suggest that anger has become that prime motivator and Trump is the sole evidence you need and Jeff Flake sastras of the sole evidence you need is self-serving in a little bit hypocritical ok so I want to talk more about this plus things I like things I hate a little bit of bible talk but for that you're gonna have to go over to Daley wire calm for just $9.99 a month you

SoundCloud for free obviously and you can do that on YouTube as well leave us a review we always appreciate it we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so now I'm going to show you that and now I'm gonna show you why everyone has an interest in pushing the false narrative that what happened here was not a senator who's going to lose bowing out and then putting that in the best possible light by attacking President Trump again not in sincerely but a little bit politically cynically instead we've gotten this narrative Jeff Flake fallen hero Donald Trump villain who put him out and everybody basically has the the same take because it's convenient for all of them so here's the Huffington Post headline right huffington post headlined this yesterday there's the HuffPost big banner headline yesterday bannon's storms the desert right it's Bannon who took out Jeff Flake nonsense nonsense I worked at Breitbart okay this is crap it's crap Ola Kelly Ward was running against Jeff Flake for well over a year before banning even knew how to spell Arizona ok this idea that the Breitbart was the was the soil mover here is a creation of the media because the media love this story right they want it to be a fight for the soul of the party between two bad guys that's their goal right the losers are all the good honest noble men the people for whom the media have a strange new respect right Jeff like strange new respect pence a strange new respect Ben Shapiro strange new respect right there's this idea that anytime you oppose Trump strange new respect from the media the media have an interest in promulgating that narrative because what they want is the people who are losing are the people for whom they have strange new respect the good folks the people have been exiled from the party and the people who are winning it's Steve ban and his white nationalist brute squad right there are the people who are winning so Huffington Post is happy to push that of course so his Breitbart so Breitbart immediately post the HuffPo headline as its own headline saying look even HuffPost says this of course HuffPost says this i mean they have an interest in pushing this Trump has an interest in pushing this Jeff Flake has an interest in pushing this I think everyone is misinterpreting here I think it's a big mistake right Ari Fleischer who typically his political analysis is is pretty pretty good but you know when he says this is a win for Trump and Bannon in what sense is it a win for Trump and banette I mean it's quite possible that Kelly Ward loses loses the Senate race and then Trump loses the seat in Arizona and again you can't pin this one on Trump because Jeff Flake was you know the lowest rated senator among his home state contingent of any senator for years before any of this happened look at events today and not declare that Donald Trump wants to ban in one the fact of the matter is the people they like lease the establishment organizations inside people inside the Republican Party are not running for re-election because Donald Trump has helped chase them out of the party but go back in time it's it is true you go back to the primary and 16 candidates many of them cut from the same cloth as corker and then a flake couldn't compete with Donald Trump Ted Cruz and Donald Trump got 80% of all Republican votes cast in that primary the establishment candidates got less than 20% state by state by state from the beginning to the very end so now you are seeing that manifestation of it play out in the Senate would I have a hard time wrapping my I am I my mind around is they said you must fight you must stop you must stand up to President Trump but then they don't run it seems to me if you feel that fervently about standing up to fight then you go through your primary and you prove that you can move Republicans to your direction but instead of fighting they the last part of what Fleischer is saying there but what I hate is that is the the combination where he says that what he just sort of slips that an 80% of the primary vote went to Trump and Cruz yes and crews had policy prescriptions that are precisely the opposite of trumps in many of these cases and he was running heavy percentages of the vote as a really unattractive candidate I said then that which again shows that Trump is the avatar of the anger but he is not the new philosophy of the Republican Party I'm not willing to surrender the party that Jeff Flake is this is my biggest objection with Jeff Flake what Jeff Flake did yesterday is he basically said the party is now Trump's party the party is not Trump's party Trump is just the figurehead for a party and he's a figurehead of the inn but Jeff Flake had every right to be in the Senate just as Trump has to be in the White House and the idea that Jeff Flake is sort of responsible for that the Donald Trump is these the final iteration is just silliness it's not it's not true Trump is not and again conflating his popularity and his ideology would be a big mistake and a not true one it's just not true okay time for some things I like things I hate and then we'll do a little Bible talk so things I like so today's things I like is a podcast called another Kingdom this is a fictional podcast put together by our very own Andrew Clavin and perform by our very own Michael moles it is not actually a daily wire project one of the reasons for that is because it is fleet with cursing but it's it but but it is really entertaining it's really well done Knowles acts at Clavin wrote it and the basic premise is that there is a Hollywood failed Hollywood screenwriter who stumbles into a doorway that leads him a portal that leads him into basically a fantasy knights and maidens world and it's it's really well written it's really fun to listen to it's not you know old radio drama in the sense that you have like the the cheesy squeaking sounds of the shoes on the pavements or anything but it's it's great to listen to and it's getting good numbers go and check another Kingdom and go subscribe to it and I think ricochet puts it out and even do that at iTunes or SoundCloud as well and I Andrew Clavin to another Kingdom performed by our very own Michael Knowles who shockingly has the capacity to to act actually I was I was surprised by that considering our interactions in the theatrical sense here at the office because so far I've not seen the acting chops but he shows them he shows them in another kingdoms to check it out okay time for some things that I hate so it's virtue signaling all around Kathy Griffin has decided to disown her former her former disowning of her beheading of Donald Trump so you recall that she infamously held up a beheaded sort of mock-up of trumps head with blood dripping over the face and in in almost Isis fashion and she was casting it in floor she lost her job at CNN for it on New Year's Eve and now Kathy Griffin is back at it and she's saying Trump's a psycho she's trying to earn her way back in and it'll be fascinating to see whether the Hollywood elite accept her back in I think there's a good chance that they will because you know as time heals all wounds it looked bad in the moment that she was beheading President Trump but they really hate President Trump down deep - so she'll probably start going to all the good cocktail parties again here she is calling President Trump a psycho these Trump folks they self-identify as deplorable it's like as if that's a good thing and there are psychos I mean they're not so I'm here to apologize I'm sorry that we have put this guy on everybody else's lap and I don't know what's happening in my own country you know when Kathy Griffin says things like you know they call themselves deplorable the reason they say they're deplorable is is because they're mocking Hillary Clinton who said that half of all Trump voters are racist sexist big at homophobes you hate the poor I mean let's be real about that and does she think that she's winning anyone over to her side again I think that very few people in the country right now are focused on winning over new converts their side again this is my objection to Flake speech I don't think Flake speech wins people over to his side I think Flakes speech actually alienates a lot of the people he's attempting to reach out to and I think he had a habit of that which is why he was losing his Senate race to Kelly Ward in an osteopathic physician who apparently has questioned the validity of chemtrails before you know like I just don't I I the the virtually signaling has to stop from all sides is just it's virtually signaling like try to convince someone it's so funny you know I get ripped in the press I got ripped in the New York Times for quote-unquote not trying to convince people I would bet dollars to donuts that we have more leftists in liberals who listen to this program then who listen to the vast majority of other conservative programs and I would guarantee you that the number of products that I pursued that I personally have endorsed and said people should go read on things I like from the left is much higher than it would be on some shows of the left because I think it's interesting to read the other side Kathy Griffin isn't interested in having the conversation she's interested in calling people Nazis again this is how you got Trump another way you got Trump is stupidity like this there's this protester who showed up at the Senate yesterday and President Trump was walking through with a turtle turtle man Mitch McConnell and here's the protest threw a protester throwing Russian flags at President Trump okay so that guy of course was it was very happy to all the attention what I hate about this is not the guy throwing the flags because that's dumb but you know it's America it's free speech is it great that he's doing that right in front of the president not particularly but I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it what I do love is look at how the media's cameras shift right they're following Trump down the hall and then immediately they all flip their cameras and you can see one of the cameramen sort of grinning at the guys screaming Trump is treason you know the media eat this stuff up they love the polarization it's their favorite thing instead of focusing on what unifies us the media have an interest in driving us apart okay final thing that I hate Paul Ryan says that the DREAM Act the new DREAM Act is gonna be part of the spending bill once again I hate omnibus bills I hate them the idea that in order for me to fund defense I have to fund the DREAM Act green cards for so-called dreamers it's it's absurd it's absurd and it's another broken promise from conservatives who said they were gonna stop Obama's executive amnesty not that they were going to reinforce Obama's executive amnesty on the legislative level okay so one's a liberal Bible talk today so I've decided to change the format of Bible talk instead of just taking whatever the Jews happen to be reading this week I'm going to just give a biblical thought that has been occurring to me because I do spend a fair bit of time thinking about the depth of the Bible so a couple of weeks ago we started reading the Torah again in the Jewish community we had the holiday of Simchat Torah where we celebrate the the finishing of the cycle of reading the Torah and then we start reading again from the beginning so we read the first chapters of Genesis so the parsha itself is Bray she'd and in the beginning and and I have a read on the tree of good and evil knowledge of good and evil that I think is kind of interesting at the very least so here I want to pose two ideas that are sort of an opposition one is the idea of Aristotelian good and the other is the idea of moral good these are not the same thing so the way Aristotle thought of something being good was the way that you would think of a watch being good right or hamburger or hamburger being good what makes something good in the Aristotelian view is it's it is that it is fitted to its purpose right my watch is good my my MVM to watch right here this this watch is good because it tells time and looks good right that is its job and so it is good at being a watch right you're you're good at being a radio host if you can get listeners you're good at being a senator if you are capable of exercising independent judgement and acting on behalf of the interests of the United States right that's what makes you good at things and you are a good person according to Aristotelian thought if you fulfill the function of a human which is to think and reason right this is basically Aristotle's notion of good and then virtue is all the qualities that you have to that you have to push in yourself so that you can achieve these Heights of reason and rationality that's that's Aristotelian good moral go to something different moral good is the idea that we determine of our own sort of our own thinking what is a good thing to do and what is a bad thing to do what is a moral thing to do and what is an immoral thing to do it has little to do with purpose itself it has to do more with our moral intuition this I think is what the Bible is trying to tell us at the very beginning so at the very beginning of the Bible when God says let there be light and then there's light and then God says it says and God saw that the light was good it was evening and it was morning the first day right when it does that when it says and God saw that it was good what does it mean it was good doesn't mean the light was morally good what did the light do to earn that sort of moniker right says it was told it was good what did is it was good at being a light right it fulfilled its purpose it was fitted to its purpose right everything that the the on the first six days the only thing that is not considered fitted to its purpose is the separation of the firmaments the separation of the waters on day two but everything else is considered fitted to its purpose right it is toe then we get into the Garden of Eden man has now been created and God says here's the tree of life and here's the tree of good and evil you know he says you can eat from the tree of life he never tells people not to eat from the tree of life right wait for all we know Adam and Eve we're eating from the tree of life regularly because he never forbids them from doing that he only forbids them from eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil okay the word evil only pops up its head for the first time in this context and what the Torah is saying here is it's contrasting the idea of tove meaning fitted to its purpose from good and evil in moral terms and what it's saying is if man would think in terms of what purpose are you fitted for what purpose did God fit you to you'll live a happier more complete life than if you are making up your own standards of right and wrong right your subjective standards of right and wrong now God has implanted his morality in the world as the idea here right he has implanted his morality can be discerned by discerning purpose that's the idea of the original good but the tree of knowledge of good and evil says the man can create his own perceptions his own subjective perceptions of what it is that's good and evil right this morally relativistic perspective and so what is the natural punishment for that once you've done that once you've decided that you're going to take the world that God created ignore his purpose and make your own then everything falls out of kilter right you're not actually acting in accordance with nature you're no longer acting in accordance with how nature is supposed to work so what happens God says it's not a curse it's not that God's angry God says the natural consequence of you eating from the tree of good and evil is that you can no longer live forever in the sense that you're not now a part of nature you're something separate from nature judging it as something apart from nature for it's good and moral content and also the earth will not yield you its fruit right you're gonna have to work for a living childbirth is going to be painful right I'm sure childbirth was painful before the eating from the tree but the idea was that that was part of the purpose right part of the purpose was the pain because the pain is what allows you to I mean it's the cramps that push the baby out right is the uterus easing up that pushes the baby up we understood that but now all of a sudden we recognized pain as evil we recognize work as an evil and so now stuff that was just considered natural and purposeful is considered an evil so we start seeing things in darker terms and that's what happens that's the transition it's not that human beings become inherently evil it's not the original sin is that we now become sinful it's that before when you are acting in accordance with God's purpose as we were before acting in accordance with the Aristotelian notion of God's good when you do that then you are always going to be acting with good and sin doesn't become an issue but sin becomes an issue as soon as we start substituting our own judgment for God's in terms of not purpose of good but in terms of what we personally think is morally good for us because we're not the final judges of that God made us we did not make God and we did not make the morality that God created and embedded in the universe okay we'll be back here tomorrow with more deep thoughts like that and presumably more fallout from all the political matters of the day I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
