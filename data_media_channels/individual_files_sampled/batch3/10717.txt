hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report have you ever stopped to consider how dirty the word saliva sounds I have Stacy max the audience doesn't know what you're talking about but they'll know what I'm talking about I'm going to talk about zombies I have a lot of zombification in my headlines love zombies this is a course the entertainment industry has reflected the society around it in terms of having all of these zombie films well the rise of the zombie corporations percentage keeps increasing bis explains why zombie firms are on the rise and survive longer this is according to the Bank for International Settlements the central bank of central banks and by a zombie firms they mean that firms that are unable to cover debt servicing costs from current profits over an extended period and they now say that globally the number of zombie firms is over 12% but in the u.s. it's approaching 15% of all firms cannot meet current debt cost from current profits this comes from zombie banks okay the zombie Bank plague has spilled over to zombie corporations what is this ambience Omni Bank is a bank that's technically insolvent butts kept alive by bailouts continuing rolling bailouts from the central banks because of their friends in the other banks the commercial banks the Lloyds the HSBC the BNP the Citibank they're technically insolvent but they're kept alive even though they're zombies through the perpetual rolling of bailouts they call quantitative easing or some other name that they come up with every few months this is spilled over now to the general economy and the corporation is listed on the S&P 500 these are in fact companies that cannot maintain their viability through profits as that word is understood that you're selling stuff for more than it cost they are relying entirely on blood transfusions this is a vampire economy this is a Frankenstein economy this is a zombie economy and of course they're caught the pop culture reflects us as Bob Proctor has been saying to the 1980s the pop culture zeitgeist is risk elected in the markets zombies are hot in Hollywood because we live in a world of zombies and because the zombie banks became zombies after eating the you know the basically the flesh the the actual living beings that were the worker is the productivity the wealth of all our pension funds and you know it's the zombie pension funds and they're looming frightening monster debt obligations that they owe their you know members of the pension fund that are feeding these zombies as well because as bis points out their analysis suggests that the increase is linked to reduced financial pressure which in turn seems to reflect in part the effects of lower interest rates so interest rates are so low pension funds gamble on the fact that they have an 8% annual return most of their investment has to go into safe investments like bonds and the bonds are yielding ever lower because there's ever more basically returns that these pension funds there's a reverse Olympics keep lowering the bar and the winner is the fattest and most slothful that's the economy we're living in you know zombies zombies I reminds me The Cranberries that's song zombie so dramatic then not since they mean Irish rock was so great for a while there and then they became a zombie economy didn't they because of the banks were allowed to create total mayhem there oh well well as you see from the chart zombies are crowding the sp500 so that's the yellow line as it's rising along with S&P 1500 I'm sorry about that but you know speaking of zombies like you know everybody here is so partisan and everybody thinks like those people in the Midwest they're deplorable they're losers as Hillary Clinton might call them and we on the west coast and the East Coast are winners and we're vibrant Hillary voters and we you know you know we're better but when you look at the entire fabric of all these headlines nobody is an island they're all part of the same system so when we have these zombie banks we have zombie corporations and we have zombie workers now we have this first headline about these zombie corporations and Bank being kept alive by low interest rates workers overdose on the job an employer struggle to respond so I'm gonna read you a little bit of a longer text here because you have to listen to this to believe it oh it's really it's fascinating and it's a sad story Jimmy Sullivan prepared for his job as a bricklayer the same way every morning for years injecting a shot of heroin before leaving his car the first time he overdosed on the job in 2013 at a Virginia construction site a co-worker who is his cousin stealthily injected a dose of narcan an opioid antidote into Sullivan's leg he woke up and went straight back to work the second time in 2014 his cousin revived him again and after resting for an hour in his car Sullivan was back on the job his boss told him not to let that happen again but within a month Sullivan had again overdosed on the job site this time another worker called 9-1-1 after a few hours in the hospital he went back to work so I mean here you have a guy shooting up heroin going to the construction job overdoses injected with narcan pops up goes back to the job like it's rinse and repeat it's the same part he's part of the economy which is receiving injections of cash to hide the pain of an economy that doesn't produce a wealth anymore and it merely extracts wealth so it makes sense that this guy a bricklayer the construction building the foundations of the everything you see around you would also be the same right so you began that by saying that no man is an island so the implication there being that this deployed of this bricklayer Jimmy heroin addict is mirrored on every part of society and in ever greater organizational paradigms of society so this one individual is is experiencing a hellish life due to the zombification and occasion of the American economy but so too are the people of his family and his community in the wider community and probably in his state and now the United States of America where's his employers are living in this just-in-time opioid addicted minimum-wage hellscape brought on by easy money like easy blood into the veins of the ever increasing the vampire population of zombie population and the cure is staring us right in the face of course the obvious cure is you need to make financial fraud more expensive by raising interest rates aggressively to weed out the crooks that would be the obvious solution Paul Volcker knows that but he's not running the Fed anymore we now have enablers we have dr. Frankenstein running the Fed we have vampires running the central banks we have Jamie Dimon in charge Lloyd Blankfein these are the these are the vampires of last resort they are the the deepest phallus dankest so yeah we we don't see any of these conversations anymore in America we used to have on television back in the 60s and 70s we used to have deeper conversations what our society should be what sort of economy should we have part of this situation here is construction workers have the highest the highest death rate of opioid overdose on the job they're the second most concentrated the only other industry that has more opioid addicts as the entertainment industry according to this chart but they to this data but construction workers what happens is they lose their job if they're not on the job you know it's a vicious you know you have to show up at the job and a lot of them it's obviously very labor intensive you're using hammers names dangers it's dangerous though they have a lot of medical issues of pain so they've got to get on the job they take that to get onto the job because it's the only way to get through the pain and you know maybe the conversation should be had of you know okay there's on the one hand you need to feed the you know stock markets and you need the revenue of pushing the opioids but on the other hand like we also need to discuss like is there a better way to how this should work have some workers comp should they have the day off should they have a week off or two weakest off instead to like recover from the pain should they not be threatened with losing their job because they have this pain and like maybe there are other conversations that could be had but we don't have those conversations because it's all shrieking and it's all crazy did you see the story that the gig economy like uber drivers their revenue in the last five years I mean cut in half that's actually I have a headline drivers for uber lyft are earning less than half of what they did four years ago study finds as a study by JPMorgan by the way the biggest zombie of all the banks the biggest derivatives book of all the banks the one that benefits the most from 0% interest rates and Fed Chairman and women going out saying oh we should buy equities in the next financial crash right well there's an amendment to the Constitution out outlawing slavery and that's clearly an example of slavery in America right here well I don't I don't think they're forced to do that but it is definitely a declining income and it's only going to add to the sense of you know the the harder you work the more you stay in place we've covered the Red Queen syndrome and fracking like you got to keep up just to meet that bond payment otherwise your flow of cash is going to be cut off if you don't make that bond payment and forget the fact that fracking doesn't make money forget the fact that you're driving faster and faster and harder and harder more and more fares and earning less well the other thing all these people have in common is that they're generally carrying a lot of debt a lot of student debt a lot of medical debt dang the debt for their car auto loan auto loan debt okay so we know from history that forced labor a lot of times this comes with debt peonage well I might sure like the analogy I have for the show better and I think it's working the zombie story you could introduce lave story to another episode but I think this fits and it's suitable I think that the zombie works in fact that we have a zero percent interest rate economy because we have zombie banks that is filtered down to zombie corporations because pension funds need to meet their debt obligation obligations payouts to their members so they have to loan more and more money to more and more zombie corporations in order to keep their flow to their members those same workers need to work harder and harder to pay off the debts for all of their student loans or help mortgages which house prices continue to rise so that works better for me well maybe we've invented something new zombie slaves they are the best of both worlds or the worst of both worlds depending at night you look at it but as far as content goes could be good so a new report from JP Morgan Chase based on payments directed to 2.3 million families show that the average monthly platform earnings dropped considerably by 53% between 2013 and 2017 these drivers made seven hundred and eighty three dollars per month in 2017 versus 1469 in 2013 so like I said working hard to stay ahead working harder to pay the debts on in uber and lyft that's a definite situation where you can keep that the hamster on the wheel like running running faster because you have so much debts in order to have the job you have to pay the gasoline you have prison right remember if you get into debt too much you go to prison anyway the overall story is that this is a zombie economy zombie zombie zombie it's like they keep on coming up you have to get up no matter how many times you die on the job of a heroin overdose you got to pay your credit card bill at the end of the day so you got to inject with narcan and get up and go to the second half don't go away welcome back to the cosmic portal Max Keiser let's talk to Mitch Fierstein in New York Mitch welcome back to the Kaiser report are you max pretty good you know I saw a statistic recently that the world is now debt-to-gdp something like 250 percent the planet ponzi theme they outline in your book has been growing unabated now for years and the total debt the GDP in the entire world is 250 percent it's incredibly big and yet now we see maybe a new trend in that rates are starting to inch up quantitative tightening at the reverse of quantitative easing what's happening MIT's what's going on here well is it really but max I've told you a million times you can never never taper a Ponzi scheme and this is the mother lode of Ponzi schemes so what's going on maybe the Federal Reserve or the reckless policy and abandoned where they reduce rates from 15 percent down to zero they claim that they're going to be raising rates but it's still statistically insignificant the amount that they're raising so all they're doing is replacing there are two forms of policy easing there's monetary policy and fiscal policy so they're getting rid of the monetary policy but they're adding fiscal policy so fiscal policy government spending is replacing monetary policy we're also reinvesting the the bonds the bond proceeds so it's like a mini QE so it really appears the optics are that they may be tightening but they're not really tightening the languages that we're tightening and yet that number keeps going higher and higher so as you point out it's all optics on the Bank of International Settlements which is the central bank of central bank report that 15 percent of all US corporations are zombie firms unable to cover their debt servicing costs from the current profits your thoughts on what's happening here well I think that we're living in a land of unicorns zombies managed by a bunch of snowflakes who don't understand valuation so the problem with Wall Street right now is you've got too many people involved in the sea crowded trades the etf trade is a horrible trade you know it's like a roach motel get in but there's no eggs that once you're in valuations people don't understand valuations I mean you've got some ridiculously priced stocks like I think we've got a couple charts here they've got a chart of Amazon that you can take a look at Amazon is a trillion dollar company but they don't make any sort of profit which is necessary if you're going to maintain that kind of valuation so anybody who's buying Amazon the most crowded trade in the world good luck to you you know I think that's gonna end very very badly I mean you know we'll look at the Amazon chart but let's talk about another company we've mentioned before Tesla so the thing about Tesla Mich you know you're on Wall Street I used to work on Wall Street for many years they seemed very relaxed about the rules particularly regarding the SEC the Securities and Exchange Commission so when Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla says something like I'm thinking about taking myself private and funding is in place we I think in the old days used to get what's called a Welles notice right I mean the SEC comes after you these to be illegal to do that stuff right well what you're talking about securities fraud and is Elon Musk guilty of securities fraud yes he is will they enforce it I'm not sure now you know it's it's a classic what are the set up signs for classic Ponzi scheme you've got look you've got corporates look at the chart you've got corporates and investors selling and Millennials buying the stock the problem is is you can't really tell what the finances of Tesla are they've never made a profit they've got around 11 billion dollars in debt they've got to increase their debt even more the company is hemorrhaging money it's burning it's cash burn is hotter than SpaceX jet fuel so it's compatible to really tell you know must came out and said that funding is secured when he had no funding he was just trying to burn the shorts basically that's market manipulation in my book I don't know why people are buying the stock it's probably one of the best shorts on the planet at over 300 bucks a share I mean on that that on that Ponzi scheme message that you put out the stock went he said that there was gonna be a buyout at $420 share and I think it topped out with around 395 and then when he had to admit that it was a lie you know the shares the shares collapsed but you know I think that's the that's a small-time Ponzi swindle compared to what's out there now I think there are a lot of bigger problems if you look at total corporate debt it's somewhere in the neighborhood of seven trillion dollars in the United States and I think around four and a half or five trillion of those bonds have to be refinanced within the next five years all right so that's a good point in that whatever you think Elon Musk is doing if it's illegal or not it's within the context of a entire global market that is cornea plan a ponzi engaged in much bigger frauds and above all the central banks and trillions of dollars so he's a small fish it's just a forty fifty billion dollar bezel where as very central banks are involved in much bigger scams now at the same time the Bloomberg's consumer confidence comfort index now at its highest level since January of 2001 so consumers seem happy Mitch the wealth effect has kicked in you know stocks are hires property markets are people feel wealthy they're confident they're buying stuff what's what's going on there well this is this is a rally that was sustained by reckless central bank policies around the world you had the Bank of Japan kicking it off buying all the ETF's and Japanese market buying all the bonds in that market you've got the European Central Bank run by Mario Draghi who's ex goldman sachs buying all the corporate bonds in the european market that are highly rated supposedly and the government bonds they're spending an inordinate amount of money trying to prop up these markets it's supporting the markets and keeping interest rates artificially low the problem is Italy has four trillion dollars in sovereign debt that the banks are sopping up so the banks are largely insolvent and need to be recapitalized in italy italy's a huge problem and it could be the wheel that falls off the cart that makes the EU crash so the debt and in the European Union is is super-sized and I don't see a quick solution to that so I think here it's gonna be a bit of a problem right well I got this idea of the zombie banks that were kept afloat by the central banks because they didn't want to have to have any problems with their friends in the banks but this is bleeded into corporate zombies so you have corporate zombies they can't meet their interest payments they are relying on bailouts as well and so what you're describing there is this kind of contagion if you will of insolvency that's spreading with with kind of a hidden under a rising stock price so the stock prices are going higher through stock repurchase programs and through the use of this funny money that's being printed so on the surface it looks like things are good Donald Trump will point to the stock market say see look things are going great but underneath the surface there is a plague of insolvency and that insolvency bubble when pricked should be pretty catastrophic and you're saying then Italy that that mean that EU is a 17 trillion dollar piece of the global economy so I mean how are the banks in the EU doing like Deutsche Bank and these other banks I can't imagine they're doing they're doing very well let's look you mentioned Amazon before being a trillion dollar company Apple is now a Chilean dollar company as well that's US dollars not Zimbabwe dollars and I remember back in the combooo muito was going to be the first trillion dollar company before it flamed out a famously ninety percent crash where is this going is Amazon and these companies going to two trillion or they're gonna be a flameout well you touched upon something that's interesting no I think filled out to be a flameout I think Amazon Netflix or two of the biggest flames that don't make money that will flame out and Tesla's must should go to jail but what's happening is is a lot of these companies are issuing tons of debt either corporate debt or the raising finance in other methods and what they're using it for is financialization they're not using it to create productivity so what they're doing with the stock buybacks is they're cannibalizing future earnings and paying off the CEO suite that never ends well in history never had and where we're seeing this most pronounced right now where we're seeing inflation is it's been exported by the West so although we're seeing this QE tightening in the US where it's really impacted is where all the speculative cash ran out of the US markets into submerging emerging markets like Turkey Argentina Brazil Mexico and Venezuela now remember turkeys debt is dollar denominated a lot of it so their currencies dropped about 30 percent this year and their economy has gone right down the tank same with Argentina Brazil and Mexico so they're dollar-denominated debt is 40 percent what they have 40 percent more debt now yet their GDP and production can't support even the debt service that they had and as interest rates go up we're gonna see a chain of defaults which is going to leave the dominoes to fall so I don't know if the some emerging emerging markets will need this I don't know if the EU will need it or a crisis in China because China is a big problem with all the debt that China has that's a big break upon in China all right let's look at these central banks again and continue on this theme so to keep the zombie banks going they buy the debt of the zombie banks you talk about Mario Draghi you talk about the EU you talk about the central banks inflating their balance sheet by trillions of dollars or trillions of euros and there's another trend though which is pernicious and ugly and disgusting and that is central bank's buying stock so the Swiss National Bank is the biggest owner one of the biggest owners of Apple stock the Japanese central bank has been buying stock on the Japanese market to keep it floating and now the head of the Federal Reserve Bank here in the US is talking about when the next crisis hits they're gonna start buying stock in the open market Mitch your thoughts well this is this is a big problem central bank should be doing 90 percent of what they're doing right but you've got or you've got economic charlatans at the wheel here that are going to run us back into a ditch but then when they create a problem you go to the same guys you know it's like Einstein said insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting to get a you know different result obviously there it's gonna be the same but what we need to do is think of the box and get different people to try to change the program you know we have too much debt too much credit and leverage that caused the crisis right now we've got more debt more credit more leverage than we had back in 2008 why does anybody think that it's gonna end differently it's gonna end catastrophic Lee student loans are at an all-time high default rate is at an all-time high it's closer closing in on two trillion dollars right so we've got that we've got record credit card debt that's the only thing that's sustaining this rally right now and you know the share buyback programs are ridiculous max you mentioned it yourself so you know if you have a hundred shares and you've earned $1 a share you're right that's a hundred dollars in earnings and then if you buy back 50 shares and you make the same hundred dollars you just doubled your earnings what did you really double your earnings productivity didn't double that's only financialization and that's a lot of the magic smoke and mirrors that we see going on and you know I'll digress if it back to Tesla you know no we won't digress bitch because we only got a few seconds so in fact I'm gonna say thanks for being on the Kaiser part and see you again soon okay max thanks a lot alright great well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser and Stacy I would like to thank our guest Mitch Firestein oh planet Ponzi if you want to catch us on Twitter of course it's Kaiser report until next time bye Oh
