I was just like a man on a mission since I was six you know I think everybody is born with the talent is about you to discover what your talent is and then try to master it and for me was scoring I just knew okay I'm a scorer I can shoot my left and my right and with my head when I was like eight or nine and I was for me was like just fighting over how to master it how to score in the difference upper ways and I mean that's what got me here I never did like the running part because I'm not a good like long-distance runner I'm more like a sprinter but like if I would just go take a ball and I will go to the to the soccer pitch that was like two miles away from my house I would walk there with like three or four balls in my hand and then shoot holidays should she try to score as much as I can so basically as soon as we started training camp I cut off all my social media also my phone I had another phone it's not really people can really get you in touch with me and you know you start reading books or watching Netflix so that was really my thing watching Netflix reading books playing xbox I watched how to get away with murder you know playing cars with my teammates you know going to the gym a bit more for weeks you just need to prepare to to try to be at a maximal maximal shape when I was five there was the Welcome 98 going on and in Belgium at the time we could always thought you could start soccer from 6 years old so basically my dad did he recorded all the goals that was scored and you would like play the videos every other day and I would watch it with my brother over and over and over again so at one point you start memorizing the actions and the goals so basically you know I would watch I would watch Ronaldo the Brazilian for like years and then when I was 6 I started out playing for my first team which is called ripple BOM is a team in the neighborhood where we were I grew up fairly quickly I realized that my family was in poverty because obviously I saw my mom mixing water with milk one day for breakfast then when you start realizing realizing that like you try to find a way how to to become successful but I really fast age and because with soccer I knew that I was fairly good and I could score easily I thought like you know what when I was 6 I said to my mom like listen this is going to be it this is how we're gonna make it at 16 you can play and and everything is gonna start from there and even though our financial situation didn't improve I still kept the same hunger inside because I didn't want those situations to happen ever again and sometimes we will go to humiliating moments but you know I would say like sometimes when you go through those times it makes you strong at the other end so it was a negative but it ended up as a positive my dad was not the type of you know the guy being on the sidelines the screaming at the restaurant stuff like that my dad would tell me when I would play well my dad would tell me when it wasn't that well but he will always try to add a positive so I can improve on the next game it was always about positive coaching I was being positive and stuff like that so you know that's what really molded me the stuff that I can do now for my family and for my country back in Africa it's amazing that's for me the the best thing you know helping my family out that was the number one thing everybody's good now I can also if if I have kids in the future they they will they will grow up in better circumstances than I did on the type of guy that you know I I love the game and I love whatever that comes with it but it's not gonna bother my sleep or anything because I know there are stuff in life that are really much more worse than that you
