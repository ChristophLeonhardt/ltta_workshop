1
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:02,500
YOU KNOW IT WELL HAVING SPENT

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,036
MANY YEARS THERE COVERING IT.

3
00:00:05,036 --> 00:00:06,805
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

4
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:08,973
OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES ARE

5
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:10,175
SCIENTIFIC TO KEEP THE IRAN

6
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:12,877
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT ALIVE, BECAUSE

7
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:15,613
IN PART OF THEIR INVESTMENTS.

8
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:20,885
JOINING ME ADAM IS JOINING ME.

9
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,821
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US

10
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,521
TONIGHT.

11
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:24,522
>> THANKS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

12
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:26,491
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS THE

13
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,226
EUROPEAN CONCERNS THAT THEY

14
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,861
HAVE.

15
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:31,796
THE FRENCH FOREIGN FINANCE

16
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:33,298
MINISTER SAYS DO WE WANT TO U.S.

17
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,500
TO BE TO ECONOMIC POLICEMEN OF

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,503
THE PLANET OR TO WE WANT US

19
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:40,405
EUROPEANS TO SAY WE WANT TO HAVE

20
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:41,806
ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN

21
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:42,941
INSIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF A

22
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:44,209
STRATEGIC DEAL WITH IRAN WHICH

23
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:46,578
INCLUDES IRAN'S RENOUNCE

24
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:47,245
INCLUDES IRAN'S RENOUNCING TO

25
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:48,179
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

26
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,081
THAT'S OUR TRANSLATION OF WHAT

27
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,116
HE HAD TO SAY.

28
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:52,250
BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS IF THE

29
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,985
U.S. IS GOING TO SANCTION ANYONE

30
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:54,686
ADOPTION BUSINESS WITH IRAN,

31
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:57,055
WHAT DOES THAT DO WITH REGARD TO

32
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:58,156
THE EU.

33
00:00:58,156 --> 00:00:59,624
>> I THINK IT MAKES IT CLEAR TO

34
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:01,426
THE EU THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

35
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:03,261
HAVE TO GET BACK ON BOARD WITH

36
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:03,628
SANCTIONS.

37
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:05,764
YOU CAN MAKE A CHOICE EITHER DO

38
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:06,397
BUSINESS WITH THE LARGEST

39
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:08,133
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, OR YOUR

40
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,034
GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN,

41
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:11,870
WHO BY THE WAY, IS ACTUALLY

42
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,138
DOING BAD ACTIONS.

43
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:15,707
SO I GET IT, THE EUROPE'S ARE

44
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,742
UPSET, THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ONES

45
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:20,612
TO TAKE LEADS ON FOREIGN APPEALS

46
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:24,082
LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY GET SELF

47
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:25,016
INTERESTED.

48
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:27,352
BUT WE'RE DIFFERENT.

49
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:28,653
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A

50
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:29,654
MISSION, AND WE HAVE BROAD

51
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:33,191
THINGS, ONE OF THOSE PEACE FOR

52
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,893
ISRAEL, AND ENSURING THAT IRAN

53
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:37,562
NEVER GETS A NUCLEAR WEAPON

54
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:37,862
EVER.

55
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:39,364
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

56
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:40,098
EFFORTS BY THE TRUMP

57
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:42,200
ADMINISTRATION TO CULTIVATE

58
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,901
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

59
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,769
GULF STATES WITH ARABS AND THEIR

60
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:46,805
INTERESTS IN THE REGION WHILE

61
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,740
ALSO, LOOKING OUT FOR ISRAEL AT

62
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,775
AS OUR NEWLY ONE ALLY THERE, BUT

63
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:51,643
BUILDING THOSE BRIDGES THAT

64
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:53,278
MAYBE HAVE NOT BEEN SO STRONG IN

65
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:53,845
THE PAST?

66
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:56,347
>> YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY

67
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:56,681
AMAZING.

68
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,350
THERE'S STILL A LITTLE CONFLICT

69
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,553
WITH QATAR AND THEIR NEIGHBORS

70
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:01,853
THERE.

71
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:03,721
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ALIGNMENT OF

72
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:07,692
KIND OF SUNI INTEREST, THE

73
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,661
SAUDIS WITH EVEN ISRAEL AND NOW

74
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,496
TALKING AND FLYING BETWEEN THE

75
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:12,864
COUNTRIES, BECAUSE THEY

76
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,832
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE

77
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:16,301
DIFFERENCES, ONGOING, BUT THEIR

78
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,669
MAJOR DIFFERENTIALS ARE WITH

79
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:17,969
IRAN.

80
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,137
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T

81
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:21,606
LIKE THE NAME, OR THIS IRANIAN

82
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:21,940
PEOPLE.

83
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,142
BUT IT'S BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP

84
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:26,511
IS DEAD SET ON DESTABILIZATION

85
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:28,313
OF THE REGION AND DESTROYING ANY

86
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:29,414
PEACE THAT EXISTS THERE AND

87
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:32,083
WE'VE SEEN IT WITH 150,000

88
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,151
ROCKETS POINTED AT ISRAEL.

89
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,853
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

90
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,521
EVERYBODY IS KIND OF UNIQUELY

91
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:37,956
COMING INTO ALIGNMENT ON TO SAY

92
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,958
IT'S TIME TO CONFRONT THIS,

93
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,559
THESE PEOPLE WHO CALL ISRAEL

94
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,361
LITTLE SATAN AND THE UNITED

95
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,863
STATES GREAT SATAN.

96
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:46,798
>> NOW LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A BIT

97
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,900
OF A COOLING OFF.

98
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,034
THEIRING LEADERS ARE SAYING THEY

99
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,803
DON'T WANT THIS TO PHYSICALITY.

100
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:53,638
BUT ISRAEL BEING CLEAR THEY WILL

101
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,373
NOT TAKE ANY CROSSING OF RED

102
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:57,108
LINE WHEN IT COPS TO THEIR

103
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:59,477
INCONSISTENCY AND SAFETY AS IRAN

104
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:01,646
CONTINUES TO BUILD UP A PRESENCE

105
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:02,814
IN SYRIA.

106
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:04,883
LET'S GO TO A DIFFERENT PART OF

107
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:05,817
THE GLOBE.

108
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:07,518
NORTH KOREA A LOT OF ACTION ON

109
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:08,086
THAT FRONT.

110
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,988
SEVERAL WEEKS, BUT THIS WEEK

111
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:12,390
OBVIOUSLY GET THE THREE AMERICAN

112
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,925
HOSTAGES BACK AND MANY OTHER

113
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:15,026
CONVERSATIONS CONTINUING.

114
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:18,463
TODAY SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE

115
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:19,697
POMPEO SAYING WE DON'T WANT THEM

116
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:21,232
TO BE A ENEMY.

117
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:23,101
WE WANT THEM TO BE A CLOSE

118
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,502
PARTNER, BUT THE STATE

119
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:25,637
DEPARTMENT SAYING WE HAVE A LOT

120
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:28,139
OF CAUTION GOING INTO THIS

121
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,207
MEETING.

122
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:30,975
HERE'S HERTZ FROM THE STATE

123
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:31,676
DEPARTMENT.

124
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:32,977
>> WE ARE REALISTIC AND

125
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:34,112
CLEAR-EYED ABOUT THIS, BUT IT

126
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,114
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE AREN'T

127
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:38,383
GOING TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT AND

128
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:40,418
EVERY ATTEMPT TOO FULFILL

129
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:41,719
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLICY.

130
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,554
WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM THAT, BUT

131
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:44,789
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ALL OF OUR

132
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:45,123
EFFORTS.

133
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:46,658
>> WANT WANTING TO OUR QUICK

134
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,526
TAKE ON MOVING INTO THOSE

135
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:49,427
NEGOTIATIONS NOW.

136
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:51,963
>> SO I THINK SECRETARY POMPEO

137
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:53,398
IS SAYING THE RIGHT THING, WHICH

138
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:55,333
IS LOOK, WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT

139
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:55,633
THIS.

140
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,269
NOW IF YOU COME TO THE TABLE AND

141
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,471
COMPLETELY PERMANENTLY AND DEE

142
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,206
NUCLEAR RISE.

143
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:05,510
THERE'S GOING TO BE CARROTS FOR

144
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:05,777
YOU.

145
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:06,544
I THINK KIM JONG-UN NEEDS TO

146
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:08,112
KNOW AND PROBABLY DOES, THIS IS

147
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:11,749
THE HEIGHT OF DIPLOMACY IF THIS

148
00:04:11,749 --> 00:00:00,000
FAILS, I HATE TO SEE WHAT COMES
