IT'S CLEAR THAT MEMBERS OF OUR

00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:20,098
USED TO COMMIT A FRAUD ON FISA

191
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,033
BOARD JUDGES TO GET A WARRANT ON

192
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,768
A TRUMP CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATE.

193
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,603
AFTER ALL OF THAT FAILED.

194
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:26,904
DONALD TRUMP WINS.

195
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,841
THEN THE CONTENTS OF THE

196
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:32,043
UNVERIFIED PHONEY RUSSIAN

197
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:32,777
DOSSIER THAT HILLARY CLINTON

198
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:34,445
PAID FOR, THEY LEAKED IT TO

199
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:35,446
MEDIA OUTLETS.

200
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:38,549
SO ALL OF THE PHONEY NEWS WOULD

201
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,085
CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREBY

202
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,521
PEOPLE COULD CALL FOR A SPECIAL

203
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,390
COUNSEL TO BE APPOINTED.

204
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:47,392
JAMES COMEY LEAKED TO HIS

205
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:48,960
PROFESSOR FRIEND AT COLUMBIA.

206
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:53,431
THIS IS PLAIN, SIMPLE,

207
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,633
FUNDAMENTAL ABUSE OF POWER.

208
00:07:55,634 --> 00:08:00,905
CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS

209
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:04,008
OF THE DOJ AND THE FBI.

210
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,945
IT SHREDS OUR 4TH AMENDMENT

211
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:08,446
PROTECTIONS.

212
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:18,489
SARAH SMITH AND GREG JARRETT AND

213
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,624
CATHERRINE ARE HERE TONIGHT.

214
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,660
IN 28 DAYS WE THE PEOPLE WILL

215
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:25,196
DECIDE THE FATE OF YOUR

216
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:25,763
GOVERNMENT.

217
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:26,831
HILLARY CLINTON IS THROWING

218
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:29,333
HERSELF BACK INTO THE POLITICAL

219
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:29,634
FRAY.

220
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,602
SHE'LL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY DOING

221
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:32,770
SO.

222
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,938
DEMONIZING CONSERVATIVES.

223
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,309
WE ARE ALL IRREDEEMABLE, SMELLY

224
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,876
WAL-MART PEOPLE.

225
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:42,814
WE CLING TO GOD, GUNS, BIBLES

226
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:43,581
AND RELIGION.

227
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:44,982
THIS IS THE LATEST.

228
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,519
>> YOU CAN'T BE CIVIL WITH A

229
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,555
POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO

230
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:52,223
DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR, WHAT

231
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:53,958
YOU CARE ABOUT.

232
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,127
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IF WE ARE

233
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,929
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN BACK THE

234
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,566
HOUSE AND/OR THE SENATE, THAT'S

235
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,669
WHEN CIVILITY CAN START AGAIN.

236
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,339
>> Sean: IN THE SEASON TIME, NO

237
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,706
CIVILITY.

238
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:13,711
WE HAVE ANGRY MOBS OF LEFT WING

239
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:17,048
PROTESTORS BLOCKING TRAFFIC.

240
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,649
PORTLAND'S LIBERAL MAYOR DID

241
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,719
ZERO TO STOP THIS.

242
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,587
TAKE A LOOK.

243
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:27,959
>> WATCH OUT YOU WHITE LITTLE

244
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,292
[BLEEP].

245
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:28,793
>> [SHOUTING].

246
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:31,062
>> YOU ARE A WHITEY, AREN'T YOU?

247
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:35,800
GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE.

248
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,568
>> [BLEEP].

249
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:38,369
>> TURN RIGHT.

250
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,441
>> YOU ARE BLOCKING TRAFFIC.

251
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:44,842
>> YOU CAN TURN.

252
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:46,410
>> [SCREAMING].

253
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:48,679
>> [SHOUTING].

254
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,385
>> [BLEEP].

255
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,387
[BLEEP].

256
00:09:56,388 --> 00:10:02,927
>> [SHOUTING].

257
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:04,462
>> [SCREAMING].

258
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:09,167
>> HEY, HEY!

259
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:12,603
>> [SCREAMING].

260
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:13,271
>> [BLEEP].

261
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:15,173
>> Sean: WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

262
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:16,607
SADLY IS NOTHING NEW.

263
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,877
WE SAW SIMILAR RESPONSE FROM FAR

264
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,913
LEFT ANTI-KAVANAUGH PROTESTORS

265
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,981
AND SAW REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS

266
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:25,950
CONFRONTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

267
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:29,020
RUN OUT OF RESTAURANTS.

268
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:31,889
PAM BONDI AND SARAH SANDERS AND

269
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,357
TED CRUZ AND MITCH MCCONNELL.

270
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:35,493
THEY ARE TOLD TO GET IN PEOPLE'S

271
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:38,429
FACE IN STORES AND GAS STATIONS.

272
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,032
IT'S HAPPENING OVER AND OVER

273
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:41,332
AGAIN.

274
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,269
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, ACCOMPANIED

275
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,871
BY AN EFFORT FROM ELECTED

276
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,874
DEMOCRATS TO DESTROY THE LIFE

277
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,676
AND CHARACTER OF JUDGE BRETT

278
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:56,814
KAVANAUGH BASED ON ZERO

279
00:10:56,815 --> 00:11:01,219
CORROBORATION FROM 4 DECADES

280
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,519
AGO.

281
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,788
NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

282
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,224
IN 28 DAYS YOU CAN ELECT THE

283
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:10,428
PARTY OF SMEARS, SLANDERS AND

284
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,963
LIES, CHARACTER ASSASSINATION.

285
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,899
AS WE SPEAK THEY ARE DEPLOYING

286
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,733
THAT PLAYBOOK ACROSS THE

287
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:16,067
COUNTRY.

288
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:16,867
I WARNED YOU.

289
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,736
WE SEE IT EVERY 2 YEARS AND

290
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:19,670
EVERY 4 YEARS.

291
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:21,172
ANY REPUBLICAN RUNNING FOR

292
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:23,074
OFFICE IS A RACIST.

293
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:27,545
A SEXIST AND MISOGYNYIST.

294
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:29,680
THEY WANT DIRTY AIR AND WATER

295
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,849
AND KILL CHILDREN AND THROW

296
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,251
GRANNY OVER THE CLIFF.

297
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:36,821
ALL VOICES OF REASON IN THE

298
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,423
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY RAN OUT

299
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:42,059
OF THEIR PARTY JOE LIEBERMAN.

300
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,428
ONE OF THE NICEST GUYS IN THE

301
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:44,729
WORLD.

302
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,433
ALL MODERATION IS GONE.

303
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:52,436
THIS IS A FAR LEFT POLITICAL

304
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:52,737
PARTY.

305
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:54,805
DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

306
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:56,974
JUST LISTEN TO THE DNC CHAIR.

307
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,809
HIS NAME IT TOM PEREZ.

308
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,814
BELOW HIM IS A GUY HE IS

309
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:04,181
DEFENDING.

310
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,884
KEITH ELLISON.

311
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:08,452
>> YOU SEE THE UNION MOVEMENT

312
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:09,520
ATTACKED BY REPUBLICANS.

313
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,189
THERE ARE NO GUARD RAILS IN

314
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,590
WASHINGTON.

315
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:14,458
WE KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

316
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:19,330
THERE ARE NO MODERATE

317
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:20,431
REPUBLICANS LEFT IN THE UNITED

318
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:21,899
STATES.

319
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,435
>> Sean: I WILL BE HONEST.

320
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:26,470
I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL.

321
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,172
I CAN'T PREDICT WHAT NEWS YOU

322
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:29,407
WILL HEAR 4 WEEKS FROM TONIGHT.

323
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:30,708
I AM CONCERNED FOR THE SAKE OF

324
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:31,642
THE COUNTRY.

325
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:34,245
I DON'T WANT THE GREAT PROGRESS

326
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:34,845
WE HAVE BEEN CHRONICLE

327
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:38,349
WE HAVE BEEN CHRONICING ON THIS

328
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,650
PROGRAM TO END.

329
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,052
I LIKE THE SECURITY AMERICA

330
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:41,919
LEADING THE WAY.

331
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,087
NOT LEADING FROM BEHIND.

332
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:45,189
I LIKE THAT WE ARE NOT TRYING TO

333
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,592
BRIBE DICTATORS THAT CHANT DEATH

334
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,027
TO AMERICA.

335
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:51,996
LITTLE ROCKET MAN IS NOT FIRING

336
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:55,166
ROCKETS OVER JAPAN EVERY OTHER

337
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,433
DAY.

338
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:56,567
I AM NOT CONFIDENT THAT

339
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,702
REPUBLICANS WILL HOLD THE HOUSE

340
00:12:57,703 --> 00:13:00,571
OR THE SENATE OR PICK UP SEATS

341
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,606
IN THE SENATE.

342
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:05,242
OUR FRIEND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR

343
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,944
JASON TALKED ABOUT A NIGHTMARE

344
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,347
SCENARIO FOR THE COUNTRY.

00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:32,670
CHAIRMAN TAKING CONTROL OF THE

356
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:33,371
INTEL COMMITTEE.

357
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:38,376
A GUY SCAMMED BY A RUSSIAN

358
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:39,944
HOAXSTER HIMSELF.

359
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,114
IMAGINE OF THE NEVER ENDING

360
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,250
INVESTIGATIONS INTO TRUMP AND

361
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:50,554
KAVANAUGH AND THE THIRST FOR

362
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:51,455
IMPEACHMENT.

THEY WANT THEIR CRUMPS BACK.

368
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:03,868
DO YOU LIKE SKY ROCKETING

369
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:04,835
HEALTHCARE COSTS.

370
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:06,971
OBAMACARE THEY WANT TO KEEP

SAVE MONEY.

374
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,941
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT.

375
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,076
THAT'S THE QUESTION YOU WILL
