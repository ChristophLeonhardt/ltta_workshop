but now by former federal prosecutor Miriam Roca she was the assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York Mimi good to see you thanks for being here thanks for having me the rick gates aspect of this story the Paul Manafort aspect of this story today why do you think that this is as a bigger deal than what we've seen before a couple of reasons Katie first of all this is the first time that I can think of that we've heard Muller's speak if you will through court papers court filings but Moeller and his team speak about a connection between people on the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence active Russian intelligence members so we've had reported in the press before and we've had information about contacts between people in the Trump campaign and you know Russian officials like Flynn who spoke to the Russian ambassador but this is the first time in a court filing that we've had Muller saying that the FBI knows that someone on the trunk not to someone but someone high-level on the Trump campaign right before the election was talking to Russian intelligence and if they put it in court papers it means they can prove it in court so it's saying that Rick Gates knew that this person was a former Russian intelligence officer a GRU officer we're not entirely sure who this person was he's named as I think person a in the documents there are news reports that are speculating as to who it was and the ties that he had to Paul Manafort and Rick gates but at this time in the lead-up to the 2016 election when Paul Manafort is not on the campaign any longer but Rick Gates is still there and he's working as a liaison between the RNC and the Trump campaign how significant is it to talk to even a former Russian intelligence official when you're running the campaign of somebody who's trying to be the president of the United States it's incredibly significant and as you just pointed out it's not only that he was talking to him it's that he was talking to him knowing about his intelligence ties so we've had things that have come out in the investigation already about you know what the word is unwitting Americans being used by Russians now we know the gates was talking to someone knowing he was in the intelligence arena in Russia the question is what were they talking about so now you have the opportunity basically for war and everyone's using its collusion so we have here's the opportunity we don't know exactly what they were talking about and I'm not saying you know this is what's going to be charged but this is a big piece of the puzzle that he is talking to someone at that time those in the trump orbit would say listen Rick Gates and Paul Manafort they didn't have big roles this these are the people that you've been that Robert Muller has been pointing to now for some months this does not show that the President himself knew anything about this and that's true right now I mean this is about gates but I think meant as many people have pointed out Gates was at the president's side at this time so it's you know there's a sort of unbelievab ility to it that he wouldn't have known but you know that's that's yet to be determined what about the pardons we have the reporting from both the times now confirmed by The Washington Post that says John Dowd who is no longer with the Trump legal team but was up until last week had been talking to Matt fort's lawyer and Flint Flynn's lawyer in the time that the investigation was closing in on them and said hey listen we could have a presidential pardon how big of a deal is that I think the most important part about that reporting is that it was doubt and not began talking about partners Dom McGann is the White House Counsel that is who is responsible for assisting the president in the pardon process not his personal attorney so that puts it in a very different light it shows that to the extent if it was being considered it was being considered by his personal attorney in his own criminal investigation in the investigation against him so that really puts it in a suspicious light Frank if it added that ordinary though to talk about pardons with people who are going up to testify or to be questioned by a special counsel or any I guess a special counsel well I mean what's unusual is that they were all likelihood and it turns out they were going to testify against the person who has the pardon power so that it's it's it would be a use of the presidential power which is a legitimate and a very strong and almost absolute authority of the president but a use of a presidential power for his own personal benefit and gain which is something that we've seen repeatedly with him using the presidential bully pulpit in this way to try to get himself out of a certain situation and that's problematic for sure whether it's criminal or not you know I I'm not prepared to say that now there's a lot of other facts we would need to know there's debate yeah I mean certainly it could fit within a broader pattern that we've seen of the president trying to make this investigation go away standing alone it's probably not enough but it's certainly troubling
