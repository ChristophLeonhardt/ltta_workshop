1
00:00:02,405 --> 00:00:03,673
LEADING A GOSPEL CHOIR IN YOUR

2
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:04,940
BACK YARD.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,008
DON'T TRY TO GIVE HIM MONEY OR

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:07,376
HIS THOUGHTS AND MORSELS OF

5
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:10,279
STALE BREAD COMPANY ESCAPE.

6
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,947
PRESIDENT TRUMP TECHNICALLY

7
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:13,149
CONTROLS THE DEPARTMENT OF

8
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:14,383
JUSTICE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

9
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:16,152
INSPECTOR GENERAL HE SEEMS TO

10
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:17,186
RESERVE HIS OVERSIGHT FOR

11
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:17,586
TWITTER.

12
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:19,755
HE TWEETED WHAT IS TAKING SO

13
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:20,690
LONG ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

14
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,060
REPORT ON CRICKET HILLARY AND

15
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,795
SLIPPERY JAMES COMEY?

16
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,263
HERE ARE -- THEY ARE SO MANY

17
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:28,631
HORRIBLE THINGS TO TELL THE

18
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:30,199
PUBLIC, THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO

19
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:30,499
KNOW.

20
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:31,634
AT TRANSPARENCY.

21
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:35,971
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, WHERE

22
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:38,007
SEEN IT AND WHAT COULD BE IN IT?

23
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,444
BYRON, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

24
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:43,212
THIS REPORT?

25
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:44,814
>> IT APPEARS IT WILL BE DELAYED

26
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:45,314
AGAIN.

27
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:46,015
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

28
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:47,750
HAD SCHEDULED A HEARING FOR

29
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,352
TODAY WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED

30
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:50,519
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

31
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:53,122
THAT GOT DELAYED UNTIL NEXT

32
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:54,924
MONDAY THE 11TH AND NOW WE ARE

33
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,726
HEARING IT MIGHT BE DELAYED

34
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:57,360
BEYOND THAT.

35
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,762
THE REASONS, FEET ARE BEING

36
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:00,396
DRAGGED SOMEWHERE IN THIS

37
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:02,832
PROCESS, THERE IS A HANGUP WITH

38
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:03,499
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND

39
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:04,367
PERHAPS THE MOST INTRIGUING AND

40
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:07,770
AT LEAST THE LAST MONTH OR SIX

41
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,771
WEEKS, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS

42
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:10,206
GOTTEN NEW INFORMATION AND

43
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:11,574
ACTUALLY INTERVIEWING PEOPLE.

44
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,175
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT'S

45
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:14,577
ABOUT BUT IT'S AN INVESTIGATION

46
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:15,878
THAT IS GOING ON.

47
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:18,180
>> Tucker: WHAT DO WE KNOW

48
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,181
ABOUT THE CONTENT SO FAR?

49
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:22,051
>> IT WILL BE PROBABLY CLOSE TO

50
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,886
500 PAGES AND YOU CAN EXPECT

51
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:24,987
DISCUSSION ON MANY TOPICS.

52
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:27,256
WE EXPECT DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT

53
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:29,425
LORETTA LYNCH-BILL CLINTON

54
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:30,292
MEETING ON THE TARMAC IN

55
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:30,626
ARIZONA.

56
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:32,428
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS LOOKED

57
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:34,196
INTO THAT A LOT.

58
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,399
EXPECT A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON

59
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,036
JAMES COMEY'S DECISION TO DRAFT

60
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:43,906
AND EXONERATE A MEMO, AND I

61
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:48,110
EXPECT A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON

62
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,512
WHETHER COMEY WAS TRYING TO

63
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:51,247
AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE

64
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:53,849
ELECTION ON SEPTEMBER 28TH, IN

65
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:56,852
WHICH HE REOPENED THE

66
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:57,286
INVESTIGATION.

67
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:59,088
THE DEMOCRATS SPECIFICALLY

68
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:02,124
WANTED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO

69
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:07,830
LOOK INTO THAT.

70
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,633
AND, THAT WAS THE REASON THAT

71
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:11,534
COMEY REOPENED THE INVESTIGATION

72
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:14,370
BUT WHAT THEY FOUND OUT WAS THAT

73
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,706
McCABE KNEW ABOUT IT MUCH

74
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:18,541
EARLIER IN OCTOBER.

75
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,711
JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS, LOOK

76
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:24,313
FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE

77
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:26,515
STATEMENT ON JULY 5TH AND

78
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:31,020
201616, SAYING THAT

79
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,889
HILLARY CLINTON WOULDN'T BE

80
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:34,223
CHARGED.

81
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:36,725
LOOK INTO WHY LORETTA LYNCH DID

82
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:39,295
NOT APPOINT A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO

83
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:40,830
LOOK INTO THIS, AND WHY ANDREW

84
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,932
McCABE IT TOOK SO LONG TO

85
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:43,732
RECUSE HIMSELF.

86
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:47,770
REMEMBER HIS WIFE HAD GOTTEN A

87
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,571
HUGE CLINTON RELATED

88
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:49,004
CONTRIBUTION?

89
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,139
THE LAST THING, THE THING WE

90
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,908
HAVE HEARD OF THE MOST ABOUT

91
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:57,513
WITCHES McCABE VERSUS COMEY ON

92
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:58,514
THIS LEAKING THING.

93
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,716
McCABE SAYS, YOU TOLD ME IT

94
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:03,986
WAS OKAY TO LEAVE AND COMEY SAID

95
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:05,721
IT, NO I DIDN'T.

96
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:07,223
WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN A LOT

97
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:10,125
THROUGH PROFESSIONAL RESPONSES.

98
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,194
>> APPARENTLY WE HAVE READ THAT

99
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:13,729
HE COMMITTED PERJURY WERE LIED

100
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,631
TO FEDERAL AGENTS IN THE COURSE

101
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:16,599
OF INVESTIGATION.

102
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,568
THAT WOULD BE FOR CIVILIANS A

103
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:19,902
FELONY.

104
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:22,671
IN THAT CASE WILL HE BE CHARGED?

105
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:24,507
>> WE DON'T KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN

106
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,941
A CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO LOOK INTO

107
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:29,545
THIS AND BY THE WAY, HAS NOW

108
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,313
BEEN REPORTED THAT McCABE WAS

109
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:35,518
INVITED TO TESTIFY AT THIS

110
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:37,353
JUDICIARY COMMUNITY AND HE HAS

111
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:38,521
ASKED FOR IMMUNITY IN EXCHANGE

112
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:39,488
FOR HIS TESTIMONY.

113
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:40,923
IF HE DOESN'T GET IT, HE WOULD

114
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:42,525
HAVE TO TAKE THE FIFTH

115
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:42,892
AMENDMENT.

116
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:45,728
SO YOU ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE AND

117
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,162
SAY ANYTHING.

118
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:50,332
CLEARLY, HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT

119
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,066
CRIMINAL EXPOSURE FROM WHATEVER

120
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,569
IS IN THIS REPORT.

121
00:03:53,569 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: 500 PAGES.
