HER DISAPPEARANCE HAS GAINED
NATIONAL ATTENTION AS THE
SEARCH FOR HER RAMPS UP.
ALLY.
A BIG YEAR FOR REPRESENTATIVE
DESANTIS WHO WILL BE A GREAT
GOVERNOR FOR FLORIDA.
A GOOD RACE GOING ON.
STRONG ON CRIME, BORDERS AND
CUTS.
LOVES OUR MILITARY AND VETS AND
HAS MY TOTAL ENDORSEMENT.
RONNA McDANIEL IS HERE TO TALK
PUTNAM.
SEEMS THE RACE HAS CHANGED.
PUTNAM HAD A LEAD IN THE
POLLING.
A LOT OF UNDECIDED BUT IT
BROKEN IN DESANTIS'S FAVOR.
HOW DO YOU SEE IT RIGHT NOW?
>> YOU'RE SEEING WHERE THE
ENERGY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
IS RIGHT NOW.
IT IS SOLIDLY BEHIND THE
PRESIDENT.
AND AS HE HAS ENDORSED IN THE
RACES YOU'VE SEEN A SHIFT FOR
THE CANDIDATES HE SUPPORTED.
YOU SAW IT LAST WEEK IN GEORGIA
WITH KEMP.
YOU'VE SEEN IT WITH McMASTER IN
SOUTH CAROLINA AND KATE
AND GIVES THEM A BOOST.
YOU SEE IT IF FLORIDA.
>> Bill: YOU HEARD KELLYANNE
CONWAY PUT THE ODDS ON
REPUBLICANS KEEPING THE CONTROL
OF CONGRESS.
50%.
A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL THAT
WAY BUT WE CAME ACROSS A FEW
HEADLINES TODAY THAT GAVE US A
QUESTION.
MID-TERM ELECTIONS FEAR RISES.
WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE "WALL
STREET JOURNAL." TRUMP MIGHT
NOT MIND SPEAKER PELOSI AS A
POLITICAL FOIL FOR 2020.
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE PIECES?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> THE PRESIDENT IS ALL IN ON
KEEPING THE MAJORITY IN THE
HOUSE.
WE KNOW NANCY PELOSI WOULD BE A
DISASTER FOR OUR COUNTRY.
SHE CALLED THE TAX CUTS THAT
HAVE INCREASED PAYCHECKS FOR
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS CRUMBS.
SHE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH.
SHE WILL BRING IMPEACHMENT
PROCEEDINGS.
THESE AREN'T THINGS WE WANT.
WE KNOW THE HISTORY.
THERE ARE 23 DISTRICTS WHERE
HILLARY CLINTON WON WHERE WE
HAVE REPUBLICANS THAT EITHER
HELD THOSE SEATS OR CURRENTLY
IN THOSE SEATS.
WE KNOW THAT TYPICALLY THE
LOSES SEATS IN THE FIRST
ELECTION.
WE'RE WORKING TO DEFY HISTORY
AND WHY WE'VE RAISED RECORD
MONEY.
WE JUST COMPLETED OUR NATIONAL
WEEK OF ACTION WHERE WE HAD
4,000 PEOPLE KNOCKING ON DOORS
CONTACTING TWO MILLION VOTERS.
WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST
AND HAVE A RECORD TO RUN ON
WITH RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT WITH
ISIS ON THE RUN.
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN TAKE TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS
DELIVERABLES AND SAY THIS IS
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN A
YEAR AND A HALF.
LET'S NOT TURN BACK THE CLOCK
AND SEND IT BACK TO THE
PELOSI/SCHUMER DARK AGES.
>> Bill: THE TWEET FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE.
THE KOCH BROTHERS WHO HAVE
BECOME A JOKE ARE AGAINST
STRONG BORDERS AND POWERFUL
TRADE.
I DON'T NEED THEIR MONEY OR BAD
IDEAS.
THEY LOVE MY TAX AND REGULATION
CUTS, JUDICIAL PICKS AND MORE.
I MADE THEM RICHER.
THEY ARE NET -- I'M FOR AMERICA
FIRST AND THE AMERICAN WORKER,
A PUPPET FOR NO ONE.
THEY GIVE A LOT OF MONEY TO
REPUBLICANS ON THE SENATE SIDE.
HOW DO ARGUMENTS LIKE THAT HELP?
>> IT WAS DISAPPOINTING TO SEE
YESTERDAY THEY AREN'T GOING TO
SUPPORT KEVIN KRAMER IN THIS
ALL TOO IMPORTANT NORTH DAKOTA
SENATE RACE.
HEIDI HEITKAMP HAS NOT BEEN A
THIS ECONOMY AND KRAMER HAS.
THEY'RE IDEOLOGUES NOT JUST
SUPPORTING REPUBLICANS.
THEY'RE ALSO SUPPORTING
DEMOCRATS.
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS
BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF THE RNC.
THE PARTY IS WHERE THE DATA IS
AND WHERE WE'RE BUILDING OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE.
WE DO THE GROUND GAME.
WE CONTINUE -- WE'RE SUPPORTING
