00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,130
WORKING FOR THE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE IT’S A CONSISTENT

108

STILL DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN REMAIN AN ISSUE OF RACE.

201
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:48,508

THE PRESIDENT IS UNPOPULAR. THAT’S THE BIGGEST THING.

218
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:11,998
THAT’S THE BIGGEST THING. I’VE ALWAYS SAID THIS.

219
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,001
I’VE ALWAYS SAID THIS. DONALD TRUMP CAN -- HE CAN -- HE

220
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,436
DONALD TRUMP CAN -- HE CAN -- HE REMAINS POPULAR BUT IT’S A

00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:04,251
IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE A BAD YEAR FOR THEM, AT LEAST ON THE SENATE

251
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:04,551

FOR 2018, CAN THEY FLIP THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE?

257
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:11,592
HOUSE OR THE SENATE? >> I DEFINITELY THINK THE HOUSE

258
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:12,259
>> I DEFINITELY THINK THE HOUSE IS AT PLAY.

259
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:13,393
IS AT PLAY. I THINK THE SENATE IS GOING TO

260
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:14,661
I THINK THE SENATE IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING.

261
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,396
BE A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING. I THINK IT’S -- I JUST DON’T

262
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:17,998
I THINK IT’S -- I JUST DON’T KNOW ANY, YOU KNOW, WELL-FUNDED

263
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,633
KNOW ANY, YOU KNOW, WELL-FUNDED DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO ARE, YOU

266
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,038
DANGER, TO BE QUITE HONEST. BUT THE HOUSE, I DEFINITELY

267
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:25,806
BUT THE HOUSE, I DEFINITELY THINK IS GOING TO BE A HUGE

268
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:26,106

269
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:27,608
PART. I JUST WANT TO PIGGYBACK QUICKLY

00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:29,610

271
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,145
ON WHAT JASON SAID ABOUT WISCONSIN, ABOUT THE LOCATION.

272
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:33,380
WISCONSIN, ABOUT THE LOCATION. I THINK WISCONSIN, PART OF IT IS

273
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,114
I THINK WISCONSIN, PART OF IT IS LOCATIONS, LOCATION, LOCATION,

274
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:35,315
LOCATIONS, LOCATION, LOCATION, BUT I THINK IN THE RACE IT’S

BUT I THINK IN THE RACE IT’S ALSO EDUCATION, EDUCATION,

276

ALSO EDUCATION, EDUCATION, EDUCATION.

277
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,886

AND YOU’VE HAD A LOT OF PUBLIC EDUCATORS COME OUT AND CAMPAIGN

279
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:41,422
EDUCATORS COME OUT AND CAMPAIGN AND BE ON THE FRONT LINES IN

280
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:42,990
AND BE ON THE FRONT LINES IN THAT RACE BECAUSE HE COMPLETELY

281
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,525
