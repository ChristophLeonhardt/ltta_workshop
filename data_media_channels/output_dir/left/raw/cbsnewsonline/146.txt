00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:02,469
ROSFELD WHO HAS BEEN CHARGED 

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:11,711
WITH CRIMINAL HOPS -- HOMICIDE. 

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,712
THE QUESTION AS THERE HAVE BEEN 

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:13,446
PROTESTS HAPPENING THE LAST 

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,247
COUPLE OF DAYS SINCE THE 

6
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:14,914
SHOOTING OCCURRED IS WHAT 

7
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,416
HAPPENED, WHY DID THE OFFICER 

8
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:20,452
FIRE ON A YOUNG MAN RUNNING 

9
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:20,653
AWAY? 

10
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,687
>> WE SHOULD REMIND PEOPLE THAT 

11
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:22,889
PART OF THE REASON WE KNOW HE 

12
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,090
WAS RUNNING AWAY WAS A NEIGHBOR 

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,924
VIDEOTAPED IT USING HER PHONE 

14
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,526
OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. 

15
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:33,700
IN FACT THE POLICE OFFICERS DID 

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,967
NOT HAVE CAMERAS ON THEM OR DID 

17
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:35,735
NOT HAVE THE CAMERAS ON. 

18
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:36,969
I AM SURE WE WILL GET MORE 

19
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,271
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE DA 

20
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,274
KNOWS. 

21
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,608
>> SHE WAS HEARD ON THE VIDEO 

22
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:43,376
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SAYING 

23
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,846
WHY ARE THEY SHOOTING HIM 

24
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:47,614
BECAUSE HE WAS RUNNING AWAY? 

25
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,581
FOR ANYBODY WHO SAW THE VIDEO 

26
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,284
THEY PROBABLY HAD THE SAME 

27
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:51,551
QUESTION. 

28
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,685
IT HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF DAYS 

29
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:53,653
AND HE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. 

30
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,823
YOU COULD HEAR THERE AND DON'T 

31
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:58,691
KNOW IF THAT WAS THE 

32
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,559
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE MAYOR OR 

33
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,927
THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE POLICE

LAMBASTING THE MEDIA FOR THE 

36
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:13,907
COVERAGE. BUT THE COVERAGE AND 

37
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,041
THE PROTESTS THAT HAVE BEEN 

38
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,708
HAPPENING THE LAST COUPLE OF 

39
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,709
DAYS IS MOST LIKELY WHAT GOT 

40
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,644
THE ATTENTION OF THE DISTRICT 

41
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:17,910
ATTORNEY. 

42
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,645
>> WHEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY 

43
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,812
GETS UP THERE WE WILL HEAD BACK 

44
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:20,547

55
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,870
SHE HAD HER MOUTH COVERED AND 

56
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,404
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. 

57
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,505

WHERE YOU SIT ON THE POLITICAL 

61
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,880
DIVIDE TO SEE SOMEONE SO YOUNG

MORNING.

77
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,304
WE FELT SO GREAT ALL DAY BUT TO 

78
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,039
SEE WHAT THAT FEELING LOOKED 

79
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,578
LIKE IN NUMBERS WAS REALLY 

80
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:25,911
ASTONISHING. 

81
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,012
>> DID YOU THINK YOU HAD A REAL 

82
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:28,113
SHOT AT WINNING? 

83
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:32,218
>> I ALWAYS FELT LIKE WE HAD A

00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,285
SHOT AND WE HAD THE POSSIBILITY 

85
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:34,254

COMMUNIST -- COLUMNIST.

CONGRESSIONAL LEADER TO FALL IN 

95
00:02:55,208 --> 00:03:02,048
A PARTY PRIMARY SINCE

REPUBLICAN HOUSE MAJORITY 

97

TEA PARTY CHALLENGER IN THE

00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:04,751
2014 MIDTERM ELECTION. 

100

WHAT WENT WRONG FOR JOE

CROWLEY? 

102
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,522
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS. 

103
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,723
FIRST OF ALL HE IS SOMEONE WHO 

104
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,158
HAS NOT FACED A PRIMARY 

105
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,896
CHALLENGE SINCE 2004, SO HAD 

106
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,997
PROBABLY GOTTEN A LITTLE OUT OF 

107
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,263
PRACTICE. 

108
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:19,299
IN A WAY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM 

109
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,333
AS SIMILAR IN WHAT HAPPENED TO 

110
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,803
ERIC CANTOR IS THEY ARE BOTH 

111
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:24,771
LEADERS IN THE PARTY AND VERY 

112
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,838
FOCUSED ON WHAT IS GOING ON 

113
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:31,578
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL. 

114
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,211
INTERPARTY POLITICS, IN HIS 

115
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,279
CASE EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE HE 

116
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:37,584
WAS WORKING TO CEMENT SUPPORT 

117
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,384
FOR A POSSIBLE RUN FOR 

118
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,319
DEMOCRATIC LEADER AT SOME POINT 

119
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,787
IF NANCY PELOSI WERE TO STEP 

120
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:45,758
AWAY. 

121
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,193
IT MAY BE HE SIMPLY TOOK HIS 

122
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,261
EYE OFF THE BALL IN HIS HOME 

123
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:48,928
DISTRICT WHICH ENCOMPASSES PART 

124
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:56,769
OF THE BRONX AND QUEENS. 

125
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,937
IN HIS OPPONENT, YOU HAD A 

126
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,638
YOUNG, FRESH FACE AND SOMEONE 

127
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,472
VERY CHARISMATIC WHO BURST ON 

128
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,540
THE SCENE AND ARGUED SHE BETTER 

129
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,543
REPRESENTED THE POLITICS OF THE 

130
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,878
DISTRICT AND THE MAKEUP OF THE 

131
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:06,145
DISTRICT. 

132
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,114
IT IS 70% MINORITY IN THE 14th 

133
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:13,686
DISTRICT AND SHE MADE THE CASE 

134
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,721
THAT HER OPPONENT WHO IS TWICE 

135
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,922
HER AGE AND SPENDS A LOT MORE 

136
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,557
TIME IN WASHINGTON HAD GROWN 

137
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:23,930
APART FROM THE DISTRICT AND SHE 

138
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,697
BETTER UNDERSTOOD THE PEOPLE 

139
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,531
THAT SHEWAS SEEKING TO 

140
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:25,932
REPRESENT. 

141
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,468
OBVIOUSLY THAT RESONATED, 

142
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,502
BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT EVEN A 

143
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:29,835
CLOSE CALL. 

144
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:42,582
SHE WALKED AWAY WITH THE WIN 

145
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,182
DESPITE BEING OUTSPENT BY 

146
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,083
SOMETHING LIKE 18 TO 1. 

147
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,318
>> YOU MENTIONED HE WAS OUT OF 

148
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,185
PRACTICE IN TERMS OF RUNNING. 

149
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,186
DIDN'T HE SKIP A DEBATE 

150
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:47,987
ALTOGETHER AND SENT A STAND-IN? 

151
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,855
>> HE SKIPPED A COUPLE OF 

152
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,789
DEBATES AND THAT IS RIGHT. 

153
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,990
HE SENT A SURROGATE TO ONE OF 

154
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,424
THE DEBATES WHICH DID NOT SIT 

155
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:54,127
WELL AND IN FACT THE NEW YORK 

156
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,894
TIMES WHICH IS THE HOMETOWN 

157
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,297
PAPER OBVIOUSLY IN HIS DISTRICT 

158
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,432
ACTUALLY PRINTED AN EDITORIAL 

159
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:10,576
AND SAID WHAT ARE WE, CHOPPED 

160
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:10,809
LIVER? 

161
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:11,443
YOU BETTER WORRY, CONGRESSMAN 

162
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,245
CROWLEY, YOU ARE SENDING A 

163
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,145
MESSAGE TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN 

164
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,180
NEW YORK YOU DON'T HAVE TIME 

165
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,314
FOR THEM BECAUSE YOU ARE SO 

166
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,048
BUSY WITH POLITICS DOWN IN 

167
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:16,348
WASHINGTON. 

168
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,519
HE DID EVENTUALLY SHOW UP FOR A 

169
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,553
DEBATE WITH OCASIO-CORTEZ, BUT 

170
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,956
BY THAT POINT IT MAY HAVE BEEN 

171
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:28,294
TOO LATE. 

172
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,262
THERE WERE SIGNS IN THE LAST 

173
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,496
FEW WEEKS OF THE RACE HE WOKE 

174
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,731
UP TO THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY 

175
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,765
WAS SHE GETTING A LOT OF 

176
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:33,432
ATTENTION IN THE NATIONAL 

177
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,300
PRESS, BUT SHE WAS MAKING 

178
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,436
INROADS IN THE DISTRICT. BY 

179
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,637
THAT POINT, SHE HAD CLEARLY 

180
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,905
CEMENTED HER SUPPORT AND FELT 

181
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,139
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH THAT SHE 

182
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,875
EVEN WENT TO TEXAS OVER THE 

183
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:53,920
FINAL WEEKEND OF HER CAMPAIGN 

184
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,720
TO PROTEST OUTSIDE A DETENTION 

185
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,454
FACILITY ABOUT FAMILIES BEING 

186

368
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,482
THE DRIVER IS EXTRACTED FROM 

369
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:03,815
THE VEHICLE. 

370
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:09,488
HE IS ON THE GROUND. 

371
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,623
AS THE OFFICER BEGINS TO PUT 

372
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,357
HANDCUFFS ON HIM, THE TWO 

373
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,992
PASSENGERS GET OUT OF THE CAR. 

374
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:17,029
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, ANTWON 

375
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,964
ROSE SHOWS HIS HANDS, TURNS AND 

376
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,431
RUNS. 

377
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,033
HE IS NOT IN POSSESSION OF A 

378
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,735
WEAPON. 

379
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,272
NEITHER IS THE OTHER PASSENGER 

380
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,742
IN THE DARK T-SHIRT. 

381
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,143
THERE IS ANOTHER WITNESS WITH A 

382
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:35,414
VIDEO USING A CAMERA PHONE. 

383
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,218
THE VIDEO DOESN'T ADD MUCH TO 

384
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,189
THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE. 

385
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:47,293
THE CAR WAS PROCESSED AND THEY 

386
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,461
FOUND TWO WEAPONS IN THE 

387
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:49,962
VEHICLE. 

388
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,463
ONE IS A 9 MILLIMETER WEAPON 

389
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,299
THAT WAS STOLEN UNDER THE FRONT 

390
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,100
SEAT TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE 

391
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,572
CAR. 

392
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:01,239
THE .40-CALIBER WAS ALSO STOLEN 

393
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,374
AND GOES BACK TO THREE OR FOUR 

394
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,208
OTHER CRIMES UNDER THE FRONT 

395
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:07,746
SEAT TOWARDS THE REAR AND IS 

396
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,781
THE 90 CALIBER WEAPON THAT WAS 

397
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,581
USED IN CONNECTION IN THE 

398
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:17,656
SHOOTING IN NORTH BRADDOCK. 

399
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,859
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER DID THE 

400
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,161
AUTOPSY AND SUBMITTED VARIOUS 

401
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:27,566
REPORTS. ANTWON ROSE WAS HIT 

402
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,835
THREE TIMES. 

403
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,070
HE WAS HIT IN THE SIDE OF THE 

404
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:37,843
FACE, IN THE CHEEK, AND THE 

405
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,644
BULLET EXITS THROUGH THE NASAL 

406
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:38,877
CAVITY. 

407
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,012
HE IS ALSO HIT IN THE RIGHT 

408
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,648
ELBOW FROM THE REAR. THAT IS A 

409
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,315
THROUGH AND THROUGH WOUND. 

410
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,752
HE IS HIT IN THE MID BACK AND 

411
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,552
THAT'S LOVE THAT WAS RECOVERED 

412
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,087
IN HIS CHEST. 

413
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,690
THAT IS THE FATAL SHOT. 

414
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,525
AS I SAID BEFORE, THAT 9 

415
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,328
MILLIMETERS SLUG MATCHES 

416
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,663
OFFICER ROSFELD'S SERVICE 

417
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:03,802
WEAPON. 

418
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:04,636
THE AT SCENE FACEBOOK POSTING 

419
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:05,237
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 

420
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:12,011
INDEPENDENT WITNESS STATEMENTS. 

421
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,245
AS I SAID BEFORE, THERE IS NO 

422
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,882
WEAPON THAT WOULD CREATE THE 

423
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,549
RISK TO OFFICER ROSFELD. 

424
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:21,420
BASED ON THAT EVIDENCE, I FIND 

425
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,788
THAT OFFICER ROSFELD'S ACTIONS 

426
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,590
WERE INTENTIONAL. 

427
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,292
THEY CERTAINLY BROUGHT ABOUT 

428
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,027
THE RESULT THAT HE WAS LOOKING 

429
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,030
TO ACCOMPLISH. 

430
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,930
HE WAS NOT ACTING TO PREVENT 

431
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,603
DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. 

432
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,804
IT IS MY POSITION HE IS NOT 

433
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:39,504
ENTITLED TO A JUSTIFICATION 

434
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,673
CHARGED TO A JURY AS A DEFENSE 

435
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:42,641
IN AS MUCH AS UNDER 

436
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,408
PENNSYLVANIA LAW IF YOU 

437
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:44,676
EFFECTUATE AN ARREST YOU HAVE 

438
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:47,279
TO SHOW THE PERSON BEING 

439
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,680
ARRESTED HAS COMMITTED A 

440
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,988
FORCIBLE FELONY. AS I SAID 

441
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:56,888
ALREADY ANTWON ROSE DIDN'T DO 

442
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:57,556
ANYTHING IN NORTH BRADDOCK 

443
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,556
OTHER THAN BE IN THE VEHICLE. 

444
00:15:58,556 --> 00:15:59,591
YOU HAVE TO POSSESS A WEAPON. 

445
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,160
NEITHER OF THOSE YOUNG MEN WERE 

446
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,061
IN POSSESSION OF A WEAPON. 

447
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,497
WE HAVE TO OTHERWISE INDICATE 

448
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,999
THAT SOMEBODY IS IN A POSITION 

449
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,402
TO TAKE HUMAN LIFE AND THAT IS 

450
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,639
NOT THE CASE HERE. 

451
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,840
THESE ARE BASED UPON JURY 

452
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,309
INSTRUCTIONS IN A SUPERIOR 

453
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:23,182
COURT CASE OUT OF PHILADELPHIA. 

454
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,016
THE APPEAL WAS TAKEN IN 

455
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:24,583
PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT 

456
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,717
WHICH WAS DENIED. 

457
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:31,256
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THAT WE 

458
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,056
HAVE HAD THIS FACTUAL SCENARIO 

459
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:35,494
DURING MY TENURE. THE FIRST TWO 

460
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,564
DATE TO THE BEGINNING OF MY 

461
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,298
TENURE. 

462
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:46,338
YOU ARE AWARE I DIRECTED ONE 

463
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,239
COUNT OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE BE 

464
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,540
FILED IN THIS CASE AS IT WAS IN 

465
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,108
THE PRIOR TWO GIVEN THE SAME 

466
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,209
SCENARIOS. 

467
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,878
I CREDIT OUR CHIEFS OF POLICE 

468
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,580
AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF LAW 

469
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,884
ENFORCEMENT FOR GETTING IT. FOR 

470
00:16:58,884 --> 00:16:59,952
INSTANCE LAST YEAR ALONE WE 

471
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:03,488
HAVE 1.2 MILLION CALLS TO LAW 

472
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:08,227
ENFORCEMENT AND WE LOOKED INTO 

473
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:08,859
TWO MATTERS WHICH INVOLVED 

474
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,694
POLICE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. 

475
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:14,232
THAT IS STILL TWO TOO MANY, BUT 

476
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:18,837
JUST TO GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS. 

477
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,838
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WILL 

478
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,771
TAKE QUESTIONS. 

479
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:28,513
>> NO. 

480
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:32,551
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 

481
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,585
DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE? 

482
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,389
>> AS BEST WE CAN TELL HE IS 

483
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,993
LIKE AN UBER DRIVER. 

484
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:48,967
HE IS VERY FORTHCOMING. 

485
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:49,968
OF COURSE HE IS LOOKING AT 

486
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,136
DRIVING SOMEONE TO THE SCENE OF 

487
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,004
A SHOOTING HAS CRIMINAL 

488
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:52,671
IMPLICATIONS SO VERY 

489
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:53,539
FORTHCOMING WITH COUNTY POLICE. 

490
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,006
>> CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT THE 

491
00:17:55,006 --> 00:18:09,354
CHARGES AND POSSIBILITIES? IS 

492
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,055
THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 

493
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,122
PURSUED BY AN ATTORNEY AND WHAT 

494
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:11,757
ARE THE PENALTIES? 

495
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,558
>> THE CHARGES AGAINST THE 

496
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:12,824
OFFICER? 

497
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:13,559
ONE COUNT OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE 

498
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,226
AND IT SUPPORTS THIRD-DEGREE 

499
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:14,860
MURDER IN MY MIND. 

500
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,393
MANSLAUGHTER, INVOLUNTARY 

501
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:15,727
MANSLAUGHTER. 

502
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,428
WE THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE 

503
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,929
RIGHT TO ARGUE MURDER IN THE 

504
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,467
FIRST-DEGREE. 

505
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,000
FOR FIRST-DEGREE MURDER? 

506
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,934
THAT IS LIFE. 

507
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:28,407
THIRD DEGREE IS 20 TO 40. 

508
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,044
MANSLAUGHTER IS 3 1/2 TO 7. 

509
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:36,782
>> IT IS AN INTENTIONAL ACT 

510
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,717
DONE RECKLESSLY AND THERE IS NO 

511
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,719
JUSTIFICATION FOR IT. 

512
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:45,223
>> OFFICER ROSFELD SAID HE 

513
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:50,362
BELIEVED THAT THE VEHICLE [ 

514
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:59,004
INAUDIBLE ], DO YOU DISPUTE 

515
00:18:59,004 --> 00:18:59,237
THAT? 

516
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:00,272
>> WE TOOK A STATEMENT FROM 

517
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,073
OFFICER ROSFELD ON AUDIO AND 

518
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:01,973

519
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:02,941
TIME WAS THERE A WEAPON IN 

520
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:03,208
PLAY. 

521
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,011
>> I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A 

522
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,379
LONG TIME. 

523
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:12,451
>> THE OUTREACH OF YOUR FAMILY 

524
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:24,496
YOU HAD NO PRESSURE IN [ 

525
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:24,829
INAUDIBLE ]? 

526
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:25,364
>> I DID NOT. 

527
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,598
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE HAD 

528
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,399
THIS PARTICULAR SCENARIO DURING 

529
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:27,699
MY TENURE. 

530
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,767
WE CHARGE THE FIRST TWO TIMES 

531
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:29,635
AND WE CHARGE THIS TIME. 

532
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,568
>> HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THE 

533
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:31,403
ACTIONS OF OFFICER ROSFELD THAT 

534

NIGHT? 

535
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,604
>> I THINK I JUST DID. 

536
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,306
>> DID [ INAUDIBLE ] FIRE A 

537
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,774
GUN? 

538
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,908
>> NO, HE DID NOT. 

539
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:42,581
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF HISTORY IN 

540
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,483
OFFICER ROSFELD'S PAST THAT YOU 

541
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,517
CAN SHARE THAT IS A DEPARTURE 

542
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:55,494
FROM [ INAUDIBLE ]? 

543
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,628
>> THE COUNTY POLICE HAVE ALL

WANT TO GET INTO THAT TODAY. 

546
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,430
WE ARE AWARE OF HIS BACKGROUND. 

547
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,232
>> THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT 

548
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,433
AGAINST THE OFFICER GIVES 

549
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,567
INITIAL PREFERENCE TO [ 

550
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,304

1141
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:44,902
AN OFFICER MICHAEL ROSFELD. HE 

1142
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:45,936
I NOW ACCUSED OF SHOOTING AND 

1143
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:59,350
KILLING ANTWON ROSE.

1145
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:00,918
ROSE, A BLACK TEENAGER THREE 

1146

TIMES. 

1147
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:01,885
THE DA REVEALED DETAILS SAYING 

1148
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:03,120
HE BELIEVED ANTWON ROSE DID NOT 

1149
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,921
COMMIT ANY CRIMES DURING THE 

1150
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:04,188
INCIDENT. 

1151
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,189
>> HE ALSO SAID THE ACTIONS OF 

1152
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,024
THE OFFICER WERE INTENTIONAL 

1153
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:07,757
AND THERE WAS NO JUSTIFICATION 

1154
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:08,225
FOR IT. 

1155
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,026
THE SHOOTING UNLEASHED DAYS OF 

1156
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:09,793
PROTESTS IN PITTSBURGH AND WE 

1157
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:10,694
FOLLOW THIS CASE ALL ALONG. 

1158
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,765
WE GOT A FEW MORE DETAILS ABOUT 

1159
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,633
WHERE THE BULLETS HIT ANTWON 

1160
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,534
ROSE WHO WAS SHOT IN THE SIDE 

1161
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:19,169
OF THE FACE, IN THE RIGHT ELBOW 

1162
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:23,106
FROM BEHIND, AND THE SHOT THAT 

1163
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:24,708
KILLED HIM WAS A SHOCK TO HIS 

1164
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:30,214
MID BACK THAT CAME FROM BEHIND. 

1165
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,081
SO FURTHER PROOF HE WAS 

1166
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:31,581
ACTUALLY RUNNING AWAY. 

1167
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:32,349
WHAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID 

1168
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,616
WAS YES, THE OFFICER WAS 

1169
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:36,987
INVESTIGATING A REPORT OF A 

1170
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:37,454
DRIVE-BY SHOOTING. 

1171
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,054
ALL INDICATIONS ARE THE DRIVE-

1172
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:39,323
BY SHOOTING CAME FROM THIS 

1173
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,593
VEHICLE. 

1174
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,460
BUT THE INFORMATION THAT THE 

1175
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,361
OFFICER HAD WAS THAT SOMEBODY 

1176
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:51,468
IN THE BACKSEAT SHOT AND THAT 

1177
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:52,269
PERSON WAS WEARING A DARK 

1178
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:52,669
COLORED T-SHIRT. 

1179
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:53,671
ANTWON ROSE WAS IN THE FRONT 

1180
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:54,504
SHEET WEARING A WHITE T-SHIRT 

1181
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:55,539
AND NEVER DISPLAYED A WEAPON IN 

1182
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:55,873
ANY WAY. 

1183
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:56,907
FOR THAT REASON, THE DISTRICT 

1184
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,574
ATTORNEY FELT THE OFFICER DID 

1185
00:42:57,574 --> 00:43:00,744
NOT HAVE CAUSE FOR THE DEADLY 

1186
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:07,685
FORCE THAT HE TOOK. 

1187
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,153
>> IN FACT HE SAID WE DO NOT 

1188
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,154
SHOOT SOMEONE IN THE BACK IF 

1189
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,555
THEY ARE NOT A THREAT TO YOU. 

1190
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,756
I THINK THAT IS THE WAY HE IS 

1191
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,124
PROCEEDING WHICH IS AS YOU 

1192
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,695
POINT OUT,  ANNE-MARIE, HE 

1193
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,362
BELIEVES VERY CLEARLY OFFICER 

1194
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:18,829
SHOT INTENTIONALLY. 

1195
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:19,730
THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT  THE 

1196
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,866
PROCEDURES THAT ARE IN PLACE AT 

1197
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:23,500
THIS PARTICULAR POLICE 

1198

DEPARTMENT WHEN IT COMES TO 

1199
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:29,540
SOMEBODY WHO MAY HAVE BEEN 

1200
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:35,946
ACCUSED OR THERE IS A WITNESS 

1201
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:36,780
THAT SAID THIS PERSON DID 

1202
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,614
SOMETHING AND THEY ARE RUNNING 

1203
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:38,649
AWAY AND DON'T HAVE A WEAPON, 

1204
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,316
WHAT POLICE PROCEDURES ARE. 

1205
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:42,519
AS LONG AS THE OFFICER DOESN'T 

1206
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:43,454
FEEL IT'S A THREAT TO PUBLIC 

1207
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,321
SAFETY YOU SHOULD NOT SHOOT 

1208
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,055
SOMEBODY IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. 

1209
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,089
>> THAT BEING SAID, THE CHARGES 

1210
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:47,791
ARE NOT FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. 

1211
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,759
THIRD-DEGREE VOLUNTARY AND 

1212
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,626
INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. 

1213
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:57,901
BUT STILL COMES WITH A HEFTY 

1214
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:58,468
PUNISHMENT SHOULD YOU BE 

1215
00:43:58,468 --> 00:43:58,768
CONVICTED. 

1216
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:01,538
>> HE DID SAY HE WILL TRY FOR 

1217
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,973
MURDER ONE. THAT CARRIES A LIFE 

1218
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,240
SENTENCE. 

1219
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,674
I THINK I HEARD HIM SAY THIRD-

1220
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:07,344
DEGREE IS 20 TO 40 YEAR 

1221

1222
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,613
THAT IS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW 

1223
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:15,819
WITH THIS. 

1224
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,720
YOU CAN CERTAINLY BET THE 

1225
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,688
FAMILY OF ANTWON ROSE IS AT 

1226
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:18,622

1228
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:19,990
PERIOD SINCE THEY LOST THEIR 

1229
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,824
SON, THEIR FAMILY MEMBER, THEY 

1230
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,859
WILL BE RELIEVED TO HEAR THE 

1231
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:28,365

1232
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,032

1239
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:42,679
THAT OFFICER ROSFELD INTENDED, 

1240
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:43,547
THE INTENT BEHIND HIS ACTIONS. 

1241
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:44,748

1243
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,393

00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,000
WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

1340
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:46,949
ACTUALLY RELATED. 

1341
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:47,751
THERE ARE CASES WHERE SMUGGLERS 

1342
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:55,792

TO USE DNA TESTING TO MAKE SURE 

1347
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,198
THE PEOPLE ARE RELATED AND THEN 

1348
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,733
WE WILL UNITE THEM. 

1349
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:04,634

1350
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:05,635

HUNDREDS.

TO THE BUT -- THE BORDER PATROL 

1381
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:54,717
CHIEF. 

1382
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:55,719
TOO EARLY TO SAY THE SEPARATION 

1383
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,953
OF FAMILIES WORKED, BUT A 

1384
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:57,887
NOTABLE DIFFERENCE. 

1385
00:50:57,887 --> 00:50:59,456
DOWN 1000 WHEN THE SEPARATIONS 

1386
00:50:59,456 --> 00:50:59,823
WERE HAPPENING. 

1387
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,892

1394
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:14,971
HE HAS PREVIOUSLY DEFENDED THE 

1395
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:15,905
ADMINISTRATION POLICY OF 

1396
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:19,609
SEPARATING PARENTS FROM THEIR

1398
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:21,144
WHAT IS HE SAYING NOW? 

1399
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,580
>> Reporter: HE SAYS THAT IN 

1400
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:29,152

1402
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,587
SPEAKING THE SEPARATION OF 

1403
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,121
FAMILIES WORK. 

1404
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,288
CRITICS SAY EVEN IF IT DID WORK 

1405
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:34,891
AS A DETERRENT IT WAS IMMORAL. 

1406
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:35,792
THAT IS WHAT CRITICS SAY. 

1407
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:36,993
THE POPE SAID THAT. 

1408
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:43,300
IN THE PROCESS, WHAT HAPPENS 

1409
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,567
NOW? 

1410
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,667
I ASKED HIM IF YOU NO LONGER 

1411
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:45,535
SEPARATE FAMILIES WHAT WILL YOU 

1412
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:45,769
DO? 

1413
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:52,909
HE SAID WE CAN ONLY KEEP THEM 

1414
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,044
IN CUSTODY FOR 72 HOURS SO WE 

1415
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,078
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AT SOME 

1416
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,179
POINT WE DON'T PREFER ADULTS TO 

1417
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,047
PROSECUTION IF THEY CAME ACROSS 

1418
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,081
THE BORDER WITH THE CHILD BUT 

1419
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,149
WE STILL WANT TO PROSECUTE 

1420
00:51:59,149 --> 00:51:59,349
THEM. 

1421
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,417
HOW DO YOU HAVE YOUR CAKE AND 

1422
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:00,817
EAT IT TOO? 

1423
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:01,617
HOW DO YOU SEPARATE FAMILIES 

1424
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:03,286
AND WANT TO PROSECUTEWHAT DO 

1425
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,554
YOU DO? 

1426
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,589
WHAT IF YOU BRING IMMIGRATION 

1427
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,122
JUDGES IN THE FACILITY? 

1428
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,290
HE SAID THEY ARE LOOKING AT 

1429
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:07,557
THAT NOW. 

1430
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:08,191
THE SEPARATION HAPPENED WHEN 

1431
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,226
THEY WERE DOING THEM AS THE 

1432
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:16,066
ADULT WENT TO SEE A JUDGE, THAT 

1433
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,000
IS WHEN THEY WERE SEPARATED 

1434
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,500
FROM THE CHILD. 

1435
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,835
IF YOU BRING THE JUDGE IN THE 

1436
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:19,703
FACILITY YOU TAKE CARE OF IT 

1437
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:19,936
THERE. 

1438
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:20,804
IN MOST CASES WITH FIRST-TIME 

1439
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,005
OFFENDERS, THEY USUALLY TAKE 

1440
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,809
THEM IN OF GROUPS OF 15 TO 20 

1441
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,242
AT A TIME. 

1442
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:28,078
THEY ASK IF THEY WANT TO PLEAD 

1443
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:31,948
GUILTY AND THEY GET CREDIT FOR 

1444
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:32,983
TIME SERVED IN MOST CASES AND 

1445
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:33,316
THAT'S IT. 

1446
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,350
CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED AND PAY 

1447
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,385
A FINE AND YOU ARE OUT. 

1448
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,153
IT IS PRETTY QUICK. 

1449
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,220
IF YOU CAN GET THEM THROUGH THE 

1450
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,890
LEGAL PROCESS, ENTER A PLEA, 

1451
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:41,925
YOU CAN TAKE BOTH THE PARENT 

1452
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:42,926
AND CHILD AND THEN DEPORT THEM. 

1453
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,961
THAT IS ONE THING THEY LOOK AT 

1454
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:45,328
NOW. 

1455
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,563
