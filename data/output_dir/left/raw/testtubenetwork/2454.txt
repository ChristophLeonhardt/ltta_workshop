1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,170
During the Cold War, a space race developed

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,380
between the United States and the USSR, which

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,580
included the design and development of space

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,580
weapons.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,709
The United States even thought about

6
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,469
dropping a nuclear bomb on the moon just to

7
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,610
show their world superiority.

8
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,350
This was a time of talking a big game without

9
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,400
having to follow it up.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,450
But the question still

11
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,850
remains, are countries weaponizing space?

12
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,880
Well, there are some restrictions in place
about

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,890
arming space, namely

14
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,510
the Outer Space Treaty.

15
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,950
It was signed in 1966

16
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,090
by over 100 countries and went into effect
in

17
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,120
1967.

18
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,940
The basics of the treaty were that space is

19
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,080
open for everyone in a peaceful manner,

20
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,350
each country is responsible for what they
send to

21
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,350
space and

22
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,380
no country is allowed to arm outer space with

23
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,820
weapons of mass destruction.

24
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,750
Another agreement, called The Moon Treaty,

25
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,910
followed in 1979 as a supplement to the Outer

26
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,250
Space Treaty and

27
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,980
prohibited the use of the moon for any hostile

28
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,140
acts, including installing military bases
or testing

29
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,140
weapons.

30
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,450
However, this treaty was not signed by the

31
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,950
United States, Russia, China, or Japan, all

32
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,630
countries with the ability to go into space.

33
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,670
There is also the Test Ban Treaty of 1963,
but

34
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,571
this only prohibits the testing of nuclear
weapons

35
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:02,571
in outer space.

36
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:04,069
Now there have been a lot of talks about

37
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,930
countries having the capability of shooting
down

38
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,930
satellites from earth,

39
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,920
including the 2007 test by China and

40
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,549
a US test in 2008.

41
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,840
But that is not what we’re talking about
here.

42
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,289
We are referring only to weapons in space.

43
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:17,289
And

44
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:18,380
so far the only real examples of weapons in

45
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
space,

46
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,380
have been handguns carried by Russian

47
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,380
Cosmonauts.

48
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,380
But even they were not supposed to use

49
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,789
these guns in space, they just had them as

50
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,920
protection on their return to earth, just
in case the

51
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,880
landed in a hostile or unsafe environment
.

52
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
There is also a rumor of an aircraft cannon

53
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,880
aboard, but this has not been

54
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
confirmed.

55
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
So there are no guns, missiles or laser

56
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
weapons currently armed in space,

57
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
but that doesn’t mean there isn’t military

58
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
equipment in space.

59
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,409
Numerous countries have launched military

60
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,380
and spy satellites into orbit that are looking
and

61
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,079
listening in on their enemies.

62
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,950
These satellites can and are currently being

63
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,929
used as weapons in war.

64
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,509
There is also a lot of speculation around
a

65
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,610
mysterious Russian satellite orbiting Earth.

66
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,680
The Russian object, launched into space by

67
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,709
Russia last May, is maneuvering, something
not

68
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,549
seen in other orbiting satellites.

69
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,329
The object is guiding itself towards other

70
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,240
Russian launched objects which leads some
to

71
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,569
believe it is a revival of

72
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:01,590
a Cold War era “satellite killer” object.

73
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,939
Experts say it could be for civilian use,
or a

74
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,890
repair vehicle, but if it truly is the feared
“satellite

75
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,669
killer”, we may have our first official
space

76
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,669
weapon.

77
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,699
