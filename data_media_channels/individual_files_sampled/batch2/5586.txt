the kids are moving the mountain today on the first full day of classes at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school since the Valentine's Day mass murder they're the Florida House of Representatives actually did something today on gun safety they did something the overwhelming Republican Florida House overwhelmingly Republican Florida House of Representatives by a vote of 67 250 passed a bill that imposes a three day waiting period for most purchases of long guns and raises that minimum age for purchasing those weapons in Florida from 18 to 21 it also provides over a hundred million dollars to improve school security none of that none of it would have happened without the protests led by the students of Stoneman Douglas high and also today the Trump Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos visited Stoneman Douglas high school but did not allow reporters to cover her visit to the school many of the students had reactions to her visit on Twitter ally tweeted do something unexpected answer our questions you came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions for the 90 minutes you were actually here how do you actually do your job never again do your job secretary DeVos finally spoke to reporters after leaving the high school when she stopped at a hotel let's be clear I think it's just say arming teachers is a simplification and a mischaracterization really I think the the the concept is to for those schools and those communities that opt to do this as they have in Texas and have as they have in Polk County and other places around the country to have people who are expert in in being able to defend and having lots and lots of training in order to do so joining us now is David Hogg he is a survivor of the attack at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school David thank you very much for joining us once again and I first of all wanted to get your reaction to what you actually accomplished today and you get the credit for it the legislation that passed the House of Representatives in Florida well I think my reaction my reaction to that is it's a small step in a much bigger movement I'm glad to see that we've finally seen some movement but the fact is that until Governor Rick Scott actually signs off on this bill nothing none of this has really mattered unless they've actually unless it's signed into law and along with that it's just the fact that everything that we've been doing it I shouldn't be taking credit for this it's everybody that's been there everybody that was there in Tallahassee from the beginning and everybody that stood up spoken out on Twitter spoken to their college essay ters and really gotten this action to be pushed through because we've seen time and time again these bills have failed for the assault weapons ban and different things that are around gun control but now we're starting to see some action because we're showing our persistence and these politicians know they should be scared because we are the future voters and we are the future David I got to tell you about watching this legislatively for a very long time and I can't think of a tougher place to pass that bill in the Florida House of Representatives and that especially that issue of raising that age from 18 to 21 that was something you people made happen there were some of those representatives who voted to do that today we're arguing against it even after the shooting as you know Intel a C you heard them arguing against raising that age but you got them there and I'd also want to get your reaction to Betsy devices a visit to the school today well my reaction to Betsy DeVos is visit to the school she was talking about a bunch of different things while she was there but one of the main things that I I think people need to realize is she didn't go to a public school she basically has no experience in public school she donated two hundred million dollars to the Republican Party and that's really how she got into this place because it's pay to play politics it's disgusting she has no previous experience in this area she's a pawn from corporate America that's working on behalf of the Trump administration and really isn't doing anything because if she was going to do things she would have done that before she got in this position and one of my friends even asked her today like how are you going to increase spending like for schools and stuff like that and she didn't have an answer she was honestly like I don't know and that's the disgusting state of politics that this country is in she went to a school that was in an act of shooting that were 17 people died republic 4 just just to make herself look better she didn't actually do anything she hasn't done anything and she probably won't I'd love for her to prove me wrong but at this point will she David I think it might know that the president's next scheduled meeting about what he says is about school safety the subject is going to be video games what do you think the president will learn about video games has he ever even played a video game like I don't think that's what we need to be focusing on this situation schools are important and what I would love to see is perhaps a five to ten percent tax on all firearm sales that goes specifically as a categorical categorical grant from the federal government to state governments where they spend all of this money to harden schools and the way that they can push these things through those for example if they want to put in bulletproof glass they could diversify it to every congressional and state legislative district so that every person gets jobs in that district and through economies have scaled the price is high right now but when there's such a high demand in more schools start implementing these methods of hardening their schools with bulletproof glass bulletproof doors and different and different locks we will see the price go down and we will see lives being saved but it's also important to focus on the fact that this isn't about video games this isn't just about schools this is about lives that is what we need to be focusing on it's not just about schools 80 it's important to focus on hardening schools because that's where a lot of these atrocities happen but that's like a pulse let's look at Las Vegas so many concerts and so many amazing people have died in these incidents and now we're only starting to see action when is it going to stop that's my question David hog thank you very much for joining us again tonight and David I've been admiring how you've conducted yourself since this shooting brought you to our attention I'm only sorry that you and I have had to meet the way that we have I wish we could be talking about something else thank you very much again for joining us tonight thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting
