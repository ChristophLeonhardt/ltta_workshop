I welcome back Kanye West is no stranger to controversy but the hip-hop artist raised eyebrows last week when he tweeted his support for President Trump last Wednesday he tweeted you don't have to agree with Trump but the mob can't make me not love him we are both dragon energy he's my brother he went on to tweet I don't agree with everything anyone does that's what makes us individuals west also tweeted pictures of a red make America great again hat signed by Trump and him wearing the hat in a selfie with two other people the president responded with a tweet saying thank you Kanye very cool a lot of people have criticized Kanye for his comments about Donald Trump and in an interview with nationally syndicated radio host Charlamagne tha God he talked about how he identified with Trump as an outsider when he was running it's like I felt something it's like the fact that he won it's like it proves something it proved that anything is possible in America that Donald Trump could be president of America I'm not talking about you know what he's done since he's been in office but the fact that he was able to do it well my guess that's a sentiment that a lot of people can agree with Sharla may the god joins me now to talk more about that remarkable interview that's creating a lot of buzz he's talked to a few people in the last few days and in in typical Kanye fashion he continues to get a little bit more controversial every time he speaks he said a few very interesting things but let's start with that one he looks at Donald Trump as a feller outsider a fellow traveler outside of normal circles I guess that part you can get but what part what else did he tell you about Donald Trump and his seeming affection for him that's literally all it is you know it's not about Donald Trump's policies it's not about Donald Trump's ideologies I don't even think that Kanye is even aware of any of those policies and ideologies and that's why he looks ignorant because you know if you're going out there and you're throwing on the make America great again hat and you're putting your arm around this guy and you don't even really know what this guy stands for and you only like him because of his quote unquote style because he's an outside of you reminds you of yourself because you're that type of rebel energy he'll say what they want you know interrupt people at award shows that's not that's not a good enough reason to stand next to a big if you ask me he's actually interesting he's working through a bunch of things on his own and he talks about the fact that interrupting Taylor Swift at an awards show seems to have cost him a little bit in his career yeah absolutely I mean it did but you know what great risk comes great reward I'm sure that is a lot of people who might have turned it back on Kanye in that moment but it's a lot of other people who agreed with him and that's the way the world works I believe in the rule of ten three people gonna like it 50 when I go like it and for people just gonna be on the fence about it I think sometimes we worry about everybody who's not liking it as opposed to the people who actually felt the same way you felt like Beyonce did have the best video that year and you know you had I'm not gonna say you had every right to interrupt that young running on stage because you didn't but you voiced your opinion and some people agree with you do you think any of his his affinity for Donald Trump has something to do with his little bit of animosity for Barack Obama who really liked Kanye and maybe still likes Connie but chastised him oh yeah that's a good point I mean it's kind of like when Donald Trump was at the White House Correspondents Dinner at that time and Barack Obama was on stage making jokes about Trump's or didn't Trump became like the villain but it's kind of the same thing with Kanye they both remind me of the villain off the incredible number the first incredible yeah when the guy was just mad could mr. incredible didn't embrace him so he became a new villain that's that's what I get with the Kanye Trump situation now the things that that Kanye said that are getting a lot of attention are about his conversations about racism and slavery let's listen to what he said on racism first thing they say is racism they say well what makes George Bush more anymore racist in trouble as a question what my friend asked me my response is well racism isn't the deal-breaker for me if that was the case I wouldn't live in America again an interesting response racism isn't the deal-breaker for me if it if where I wouldn't live in America what do you think of that I mean like I told him that's um that's um that's a very rich rhetoric you know that's that's that's that's what a rich person can say because a rich person has those options you know they can afford to go move someplace else but I don't know too many places in the world that they can go where they're going to escape really smart escape colorism but you know yeah I just feel like that's just a so disconnected statement because there's a lot of people here at a point doesn't franchise who have to deal with racism every day they don't have any options right whatsoever so I just think that's a very rich statement from a rich person like that's a rich person's option but a lot of other people in America don't have that option you you were actually fairly accommodating of another statement he made about slavery being a choice and that he meant something more complicated than he actually said and and you gave him some advice about maybe thinking twice before saying something I gots gonna get a lot of attention he's I mean he did say that he thought slavery was a choice yeah you know I got a segment on my show called donkey today well I give people the credit they deserve for being stupid and I definitely gave him donkey today for that statement because it's not about what you what you meant to say it's about what you actually say now what he meant to say I think was about psychological slavery and you know he was talking about you know we shouldn't be enslaved now mentally but that's not the way it came out the way it came out was 400 years of physical slavery us being kidnapped I was being sold bought over here raped murdered tortured we didn't have an option it's not like being a slave was a fraternity okay I didn't play it slave I you you know I'm saying like I didn't been riding enroll in slavery we didn't have a choice right and that matter so that was just a stupid statement did you tell him though that you know the advice you'd give him his measure twice yeah because you know he's in the clothing you know what I'm saying so when you're in the clothing like he you know he's got a factory he watches people make clothes when you see people fabric you like they measure twice so they can cut once cuz they're not gonna waste that fabric so don't waste your thoughts like that you know what I'm saying like you have too big of a platform yeah you have too much influence it's people actually out there listening to you so when they hear that rhetoric oh look Kanye said slavery was just a choice of Kanye said you know black people can just get up and go be great yeah I do feel like we can get up and go be great but you know it's a lot more nuanced and it's a lot more it's more complex than the way he words it trouble man they got great way to end the show thank you for being me hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if
