GREG: TRUMP HELD A RALLY TONIGHT
AND WONDER IF THE THOUGHT TODAY
WAS A BIG DAY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: THIS IS SUCH A
BIG DAY.
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A MAN OF
GREAT CHARACTER AND INTELLECT.
IS A TOTALLY BRILLIANT SCHOLAR.
GREG: TOTALLY BRILLIANT SCHOLAR.
THAT'S NOT JUST BRILLIANT BUT
TOTALLY.
IN A VICTORY LAUGHING, TRUMP HAS
A MIDTERM TO GET THROUGH AND
LAID OUT THE CHOICES.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: YOU ALLOW THE
WRONG PEOPLE TO GET INTO OFFICE,
THINGS COULD CHANGE.
THEY COULD CHANGE AND THEY COULD
CHANGE FAST.
YOU DON'T HANDLE MATTERS TO AN
ARSONIST AND YOU DON'T GET POWER
TO END ANGRY LEFT-WING MOB.
GREG: WAIT, HE'S NOT DONE.
HE HAS MORE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: DEMOCRATS WANT
TO SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE YOUR
TAXES ESSENTIALLY THEY WANT TO
IMPOSE SOCIALISM -- MAC
VENEZUELA AND ELIMINATE OUR
BORDERS.
THEY WANT TO HAVE NICE, OPEN
BORDERS.
DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME THE PARTY
OF CRIME.
THEY BECOME THE PARTY OF CRIME.
THINK ABOUT THAT.
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF LAW
AND ORDER AND JUSTICE.
GREG: PARTY OF CRIME.
HE JUST GAVE THE REPUBLICANS
THEIR TALKING POINTS AND THEN,
OF COURSE, THE NICKNAMES.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: LEAKY JOE BIDE
BIDEN,  I HAVE MORE
INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THAN
POCAHONTAS AND I HAVE NONE.
GREG: HE WON'T CHANGE.
HE WON'T CHANGE.
AND THEN I'M PRETTY SURE HE DID
SOMETHING NO OTHER AMERICAN
PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN HISTORY.
HE THANKED A GUY NAMED WEEK.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: TAKE YOU, JEFF.
THANK YOU, BRAD.
WEAK, THANK YOU.
GREG: THE ECONOMY IS STRONG IN
SPRING COURT NOMINEE GOT VOTED
IN AND POMPEO WILL TALK TO NORTH
KOREA THE MORE AND EVERYTHING IS
GETTING DONE.
AND YET, I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
ABOUT THE SPACE FORCE AND IF
THAT IS WHERE IT IS AT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: SPACE FORCE.
THAT IS WHERE IT IS AT.
THAT IS RIGHT.
THAT IS WHERE IT IS THAT.
GREG: TOM, TRUMP TAKES A LOT OF
VICTORY LAPS, LET'S FACE IT.
IF THE SUN COMES UP, VICTORY
LAP.
BUT I THINK HE DESERVES
WEDNESDAY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THEY'RE HAVING FUN BUT CONTRAST
THE PEOPLE WITH THOSE AT THE TOP
RALLIES AND THOSE PROTESTERS AT
THE MALL IN WASHINGTON DC.
I DON'T LIKE ELEVATORS WHEN
THEY'RE NOT SCREAMING.
BUT IT WORK.
APPLY THIS WEEK WAS SO GOOD.
HOPEFULLY THE STUFF WON'T WORK.
THEY'RE NOT STOPPING THE
SCREAMING BUT LEFT-WING
ACTIVISTS, REAL PEOPLE, WITH THE
BLUE CHECKED ON THE NAME ON
TWITTER ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO
HARASS SUSAN COLLINS FOR THE
REST OF HER LIFE.
GREG: IT'S CRAZY.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN
EXCITEMENT.
>> I'M GETTING SO EXCITED.
GREG: KAT, NEW NICKNAMES AND
LEAKING DIANE WHICH SOUNDS A BIT
UNFORTUNATE AND TRYING TO COME
UP WITH A NICKNAME FOR YOU, CAT.
HOW ABOUT --
HOW ABOUT.--
KAT: NOT GOING TO LIKE IT.
GREG: UNHAPPY CAT.
SAD CAT.
KAT: GREG, I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT
OF THINKING AND I THINK I HAVE
FIGURED OUT WHY TRUMP HOLDS ALL
THESE RALLIES.
GREG: WHY?
KAT: MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING OR THEY
HAVE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE,
WHAT DO THEY DO?
THEY GO HAVE A DRINK.
GREG: RIGHT, RIGHT.
KAT: TRUMP DOES NOT DRINK.
HE'S BUILD VENUES FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO LOVE HIM AND ALLOW THEM TO
CLAP AND CHEER WHILE HE TALKS
ABOUT IT.
GREG: THAT CREATES THE SAME
FEELING OF BEING DRUNK.
KAT: IT MUST.
HE IS DRUNK ON LOVE FIVE DRUNK
ON LOVE P8 I LOVE DRINKING BUT
IF I COULD TRADE I LOVE A GIANT
VENUE FULL OF KAT FANS.
GREG: TYRUS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
SAYING THIS TRUMP TRUMP REFUSED
TO GIVE IN AND BACKED HIM AND
THAT'S BECAUSE ALL HE DOES IS
FIGHT.
HE LIKES TO FIGHT AND GAVE THE
REPUBLICANS THE ENERGY TO FIGHT
AND THAT IS WHY I THINK HE
DOESN'T STOP.
HE DOES THIS VICTORY LAP AND
START GOING AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE
BECAUSE HE WILL QUIT.
TYRUS: HERE'S THE BUZZ KILL ON
THIS.
I THINK HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE
HAPPY.
KAVANAUGH ALWAYS SHOULD HAVE
BEEN VOTED AND IT WAS NEVER --
WE HAD TO WHETHER THE
ALLEGATIONS BUT AFTER THE FBI
IMITATION IT WAS CLEAR THERE IS
NO COOPERATIVE EVIDENCE.
THE REASON FOR HIM NOT TO BE PUT
IN.
BUT I'M ALL FOR GOING TO A
FOOTBALL GAME AND WINNING THE
WRESTLING MATCH WHEN YOU
CELEBRATE WITH A CLOUD BUT THEN
YOU GO BACK THROUGHOUT THE REST
OF THE DAY.
MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN YOU DO
CELEBRATE AND YOU GO ALL IN
POINTING OUT THE LOSERS BY NAME,
YOU ARE WRITING CHECKS THAT WE
HAVE TO CASH BUT HE GOES BACK TO
THE WHITE HOUSE WITH HIS
SECURITY TEAMS AND ENJOYS
HIMSELF AND HAS A COKE AND A
SMILE AND CALLED IT A DAY.
WE GO TO THE BARS AND GO BACK TO
SOCIETY WE ARE WEARING A RED HAT
OR WHATEVER WE HAVE TO CASH THE
CHECK HE WROTE WITH THE OTHER
PEOPLE.
FOR ME, I WISH I'M ALL FOR THE
VICTORY LAP BUT THE TRASH
TALKING IS GETTING TO THE POINT
WHERE IT'S CAUSING ISSUES FOR
THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM AND
STAND BY HIM THE MOST.
GREG: A GUY IN A RED HAT TONIGHT
IS MORE LIKELY TO GET BEAT UP.
TYRUS: YES, BECAUSE THE USE THE
EXCUSE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT
SAID AT THE RALLY.
>> BUT TIRES, YOU'RE LESS LIKELY
TO GET HURT THEN I AM.
TYRUS: OKAY, AND THAT'S ALL FUN
AND GREAT AND CLAP BUT WHEN THAT
DUMB ASS COMES TO ME AND I PUT
HIM THROUGH THE WALL I GOT TO GO
TO COURT.
YOU'LL GET SOME OF THE FOLLOWERS
AND A GREAT GO FOR ME TO GET
BETTER BUT I'LL GET BE IN COUNTY
FOR TWO WEEKS.
GREG: WILL HAVE YOU ON REMOTE
FROM THE JAIL CELL.
TYRUS: YOU DON'T EVEN DO REMOTE,
DON'T EVEN TRY.
GREG: EMILY WOULD DEFEND YOU AND
SHE'S QUITE THE LITIGATOR BENIGN
SHE'S EXPENSIVE.
>> MY BIGGEST MESSAGE FROM THE
RALLY IS THAT THE REPUBLICANS --
WE CAN'T STAY CELEBRATING FOR
TOO LONG.
THIS IS A MARATHON NOT A SPRINT.
DEMOCRATS PARTY SAID IF THEY
TAKE BACK THE HOUSE AND THE
MIDTERM ELECTIONS THEY'RE MOVING
FOR IMPEACHMENT FOR JUSTICE
KAVANAUGH AND ALREADY BEEN
ETHICS VIOLATION AND MISCONDUCT
CASES BASICALLY FILED AGAINST
HIM AS A JUDGE.
OBVIOUSLY, THERE WOULD BE NO
SUPER MAJORITY BUT THE DEMOCRATS
ARE STILL RUNNING ON THE
PLATFORM AND REALITY AS WE KNOW
IT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH THEM.
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO NOT
RELAX FOR TOO LONG.
GREG: DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEMS
ARE LIKE RIGHT NOW?
THERE LIKE AND ASK THAT YOU
JUMPED AND STILL HANG OUT IN
FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.
THEY CAN'T DRIVE AWAY.
THERE STARING AT -- IN YOUR
WINDOW.
KAT: SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO LET
GO.
GREG: I KNOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO
LIKE A.
TYRUS: BUT IT'S WORTH DRIVING
WITH A PRETTIER AND TALLER
GIRLFRIEND IN FRONT OF THEIR
HOUSE.
I'M SORRY, I KEEP TURNING THIS
WAY.
