hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so you may remember a few</font>

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,840
weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I played to race me Ferguson</font>

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,270
about her new book juice well<font color="#E5E5E5"> penguin</font>

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,710
Random House have now commissioned me to

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,780
make this video where I show you a

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,010
couple of recipes today I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">making two juices that look the same it</font>

8
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,429
actually tastes quite different I'm

9
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,780
actually making them in my blender so

10
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,920
I'm making them as smoothies because I

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,300
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a juicer but I also really</font>

12
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,250
like smoothies because of the fiber that

13
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,769
keep all the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of integrity of the</font>

14
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,330
fruit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and vegetable the two juices were</font>

15
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,269
making today our rainbow juice and

16
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,800
crystal clear look how similar they look

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are completely different also</font>

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">really to emphasize as with any role in</font>

19
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kitchen yield one with the power you</font>

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,910
can make the decision so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I</font>

21
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,200
didn't have blue-green algae and I

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,579
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really find it in the time i</font>

23
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,829
had so i just used the ingredients which

24
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically everything that I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on my</font>

25
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,829
fridge already which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful the</font>

26
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:44,969
great thing about juice which i think i

27
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,230
mentioned in the other videos that it

28
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,059
tells you exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what each fruit and</font>

29
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,800
vegetables good for so you can

30
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,270
substitute<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in around if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

31
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,070
have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can substitute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in or out</font>

32
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,660
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also</font>

33
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,250
substitute it in or not if you're trying

34
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in particular if you're</font>

35
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,359
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be less bloated or you're</font>

36
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to have more energy etc so let's</font>

37
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,438
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ingredients for rainbow</font>

38
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,600
do so you will made a handful of spinach

39
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,210
just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these half a beetroot</font>

40
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,939
one carrot five strawberries<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

41
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,920
blueberries the juice of half a lemon

42
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,869
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recipe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also calls for but I'm</font>

43
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,610
not using it today<font color="#E5E5E5"> two teaspoons of</font>

44
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,360
blue-green algae

45
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,229
so rainbow juice is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> give the</font>

46
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,840
regeneration<font color="#E5E5E5"> its multivitamins equally</font>

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,760
good if you do Pilates or yoga you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

48
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,020
just drink it straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards I</font>

49
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,369
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this if you're not really</font>

50
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,650
used to juices of really vegetable<font color="#CCCCCC"> II</font>

51
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,750
this is a good gateway juice into that

52
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,369
well if it doesn't taste too much like

53
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,080
vegetables it doesn't taste like you're

54
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,300
eating a be true it does have that edge

55
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,070
still that needs to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the sugar</font>

56
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,290
levels of really really sweet juices I

57
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,700
don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people look sexy while</font>

58
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,229
drinking with straws because I look

59
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:08,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid hmm but no this is</font>

60
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,399
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> delicious for crystal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,260
you will need a quarter of a pineapple

62
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,300
which you will obviously peeled and put

63
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,830
it with all the spike of it sends to

64
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,470
beetroots two stalks of celery<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

65
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,120
radishes<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1tsp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rosemary leaves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 teaspoon</font>

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
thyme leaves and six sage leaves if

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,950
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> passing used to reduce it and be</font>

68
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure to wrap the Braves Murray other</font>

69
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,760
time inside the savories<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also did</font>

70
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,290
that's the blender as well but they can

71
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,030
get all caught up and you know get stuck

72
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,590
and can all get a bit messy crystal

73
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,790
clear it's definitely more vegetable<font color="#CCCCCC"> II</font>

74
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,230
if you have a bit more experience with

75
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,489
it all you just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in there</font>

76
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">first because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gryffindor then</font>

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,049
yeah then try this one it's still not

78
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> intense and I'm always a bit</font>

79
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,650
surprised by how delicious the juices

80
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,720
all because of something in my head<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,130
guess that's still telling me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font>

82
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">vegetable juices and vegetable smoothies</font>

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,940
have to taste really bad and this one is

84
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,530
all about clearing the brain fog so

85
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,720
those of you in exams right now those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

86
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,579

87
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:02,900
that you're ignoring because you're

88
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,400
moving to America and everything's a bit

89
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,290
stressful then go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fell it was</font>

90
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,940

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,100
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're you feel like you're</font>
