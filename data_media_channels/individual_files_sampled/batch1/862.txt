is peace possible in South Sudan they fought for independence from Sudan and when they got it government forces and rival rebels ward with each other for years now another power sharing deal has been signed but will it hold this time this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Mohammed Jim Jim the warring leaders in South Sudan are giving peace another chance but is the agreement signed on Sunday in Sudan finally the one which will end five years of Civil War many ceasefire deals have been signed then collapsed within hours and the fighting which has killed tens of thousands and uprooted millions didn't stop now a second power sharing agreement has been struck between President Salva Kiir and rebel leader react match are the president says he's confident this one won't collapse we'll get to our guest shortly but first hipa morgan has more another agreement signed between South Sudan's government and opposition groups and renewed hopes of ending five years of war this time regional countries brokered more than a month of direct discussions in the Sudanese capital Khartoum between the leaders of the warring sides the civil war started less than three years after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 President Salva Kiir accused his former vice president Riek Machar of attempting a coup since then tens of thousands have been killed and a third of the 12 million population forced from their homes the latest agreement gives an eight-month free transitional period after which Riek Machar is due to return as vice president the deal stipulates 35 ministers in a transitional government 20 from Kira's Party and 9 from much ours the rest represent other parties Parliament will have 550 legislators including 332 from Kira's group and 128 from my chars opposition leader Riek Machar says the latest deal will bring peace a power-sharing deal signed three years ago so much I returned to his position months later only for fighting too soon restart some such as Fleur Iowa who so what happened then are cautiously optimistic now well anomaly another's game when the 2016 fighting happened we were trapped so much has changed since the war my sister lost her husband and we also lost another relative we couldn't do anything we just stayed at home now we just want peace around six million South Sudanese rely for innate to survive with the economy devastated by war many are hanging their hopes on this agreement Hiba Morgan al-jazeera all right it just over seven years old South Sudan is the world's youngest country it gained independence from Sudan following a referendum in 2011 a political dispute two years later between President Salva Kiir and his vice president Riek Machar turned into war a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2014 but it didn't hold for long peace talks and deals all failed the first power-sharing peace agreement was signed in 2015 which saw the return of makaras first vice-president the deal collapsed within a year fighting resumed in the capital Juba and machchar fled the country all right we'd like to stress that this program made several attempts to invite a spokesman for the South Sudanese government on the program today but nobody was available to speak to us so let's bring in our panel for the show joining us via Skype from Nairobi Deo goombah researcher at the Institute for Security Studies office in Kenya in Washington DC alie Virgie visiting researcher at the United States Institute of Peace and in London with Suleyman a researcher in the Africa program at Chatham House welcome to you all now Allie I want to start with you Sunday's deal is just the latest ceasefire it's the latest power sharing agreement what makes it different this time any hope that it will last I think its first important to note that this isn't the final deal even though it's been reported that way there will still be subsequent negotiations on security matters the second point to make is that this deal does not repeal the earlier 2015 peace agreement that you mentioned earlier that is still in effect but it's not clear what exactly will be implemented from that and what will be implemented from this agreement and how one selects between those things the third is that it sets up a very long time table for actual implementation and so in these eight months that are being talked about a lot could happen a lot could change there is also a limitation because not everyone who is fighting has been involved in the process in Khartoum and not everyone who signed yesterday appears to be fully represented relative of their own parties as well so we can expect over the next few days to see various statements perhaps some denunciations of the agreement there's still a long way to go before this agreement leads South Sudan to peace there let me ask you and many observers are saying that the structure of this agreement thus far looks very similar to the Accord that was signed in 2016 and thus they are worried that it's going to collapse what do you think I would say that it's it's different this time because of the commitment of the regional governments the commitment of the parties themselves because there is a lot of a lot of optimism from the groups that this time it's not going to collapse the main group studies there are of course smaller groups that cannot be not and that could cause serious problems as my colleague has just noted but I think the optimism of the involvement of the entire region remember that this this agreement was signed in was negotiated in almost all the three or the four main cities of this region so that makes it a little bit different from the rest although it is the same in letter and spirit almost I mean you heard a oh there just talk about regional involvement certainly you know neighbours of South Sudan far more involved in this deal than they have been in other deals do you think that that is going to help this out more this time well I think that the neighboring countries the countries within it have always been extremely important to the egad peace process deal I mean what seems to set this current peace deal apart is that you have largely Sudan and Uganda leading the process and this process has been taken in called the cartoon process so it's essentially the leverage that the Sudanese government provide is on the parties who are signing as well as Ugandan government which has been a strong supporter of President kids Saturday's government during the this period that will see if the deal can be one that lasts and one that holds and of course what we do know is that there are important economic incentives or both parties you know there's an economic crisis of course in South Sudan but there's also one in Sudan on the promise that some of the oil fields and in unity state largely will be re constituted and and and start producing oil again to feed into the the economies of Sudan and South Sudan is an important part of this this deal what we don't know for example is how that oil money is going to be spent what the oversight over that kind of financing is going to be whether or not it's going to go when it goes into an escrow account whether or not the international community will have any oversight over that so there are lots of areas of this deal where potentially it could be a success because of the high level engagement of the region but also perhaps it could fall short because of their engagement Ally you just heard i'ma talk about you know the issue of oil and you know the ink was barely dry on the signing of this Accord before President of Sudan Omar Bashir was talking about the fact that he foresaw that oil would be flowing from South Sudan starting in September first of all I want to ask you do you think that's realistic and secondly Sudan of course has been accused of meddling you know in the war in South Sudan in the conflict so can they be trusted as a guarantor of a peace deal well of course there is already oil flowing there has been all flowing continually their two main areas ahmed dis referred to the unity the other area of oil production was largely unaffected by the conflict and so the hope would be that in this short time you could somehow rehabilitate the damaged oil fields and turn up production in that respect I think that's actually going to take much longer than anybody has indicated whether the various oil ministers are indeed President Bashir so any immediate impact in terms of oil revenue will will take much longer of course oil prices are rising generally and that may increase revenue to both South Sudan and Sudan in that respect there is a long history between Sudan and South Sudan which makes their relationship fraught because of the border because of water because of oil because of the migration of people the idea that Sudan is somehow a neutral mediator I think we all can agree that that isn't the case but that doesn't mean that Sudan can't necessarily be forced to influence a process more positively I think there are two limitations one is that Sudan's own interests can't really be separated from the possibility that it isn't a neutral or isn't a trusted mediator let's say between all of the South Sudanese elements inside the country certainly there is a degree of what so Sudanese interests more than anything else but also this idea that there is a way to compel compliance is something that is extremely difficult so if the government of South Sudan or the new government of South Sudan doesn't live up to certain elements of the deal what can the Sudanese do about it part of the problem of these peace processes is that the compliance the mechanism for enforcement oversight whatever you want to call it doesn't necessarily lead to concrete actions we see that now with violations of the ceasefire for example where there have been violations documented by the regional monitors from the same countries and yet there's very little action or consequences as a result of those violations so the deal itself has the same limitation as the same problem I don't see how the Sudanese can do anything different in that respect on the basis of the current framework do the civil war in South Sudan has been very complicated from the start it's been fuelled by by a personal and ethnic rivalries and I want to ask you what role does tribalism play in this conflict its place the same thing role that it has played in several of and countries when I look at the example of my own country Kenya even this stage of Independence you still have those ethnic interests coming to play a coming into play in a lot of issues that are being discussed at the national level so when you have elections that you will see that coming up so when you look at South Sudan therefore you're going to see that when it comes to the division of resources because this is a country that is just beginning to rebuild and each one of those ethnic groups is going to want a very good share of the cake and I think that if that is not carefully planned and carefully done it is likely to cause a lot of problems the other cake that apart from the economic the economic issues there is also the political issues the division of political offices the division of appointments into government those are also very important and they will be looked at very very critical by the parties that are involved if you want to see how many of the people how many of their politicians and leaders are represented in those governments I in the government and in the departments and ministries of the government so from the economy perspective and the political perspective does factor of ethnic rivalry or ethnic balance is very very important Hamid in March a UN panel of investigators said dozens of senior army officers in South Sudan have likely committed crimes against humanity including mass rapes and civilian murders do you expect that now there will be any accountability will we see trials going forward will anybody be held responsible for these crimes it's very difficult to say there is a provision in the 2015 agreement for the establishment of an African Union hybrid court I have to say that any sort of progress towards the establishment of that Court has been minimal in in the last three years and and also in the interests of holding peace several of the sides have suggested that if that kind of court were to be established that it would be something which would prevent peace from from first of all being established and then being maintained of course we have seen quite recently UN Security Council sanctions including individual sanctions on some commanders but but ultimately these have fallen short and been lacking as well in that we the individuals that we have seen that have been targeted weren't necessarily sanctioned when the sanctions were what were included away you know talking about people such as informant information Minister Michael McCrea the defense minister wanyan Jack these ministers haven't been wearers you know previous commanders in the army including Paul Milan who's currently now an opposition figure are those who have had sanctions placed on them so in terms of reparations and looking at the future it really will be a matter of political will and as we say now looking at the the nature of the way the peace process and the peace deal has been signed we don't know the level of international oversight over this peace deal what what the international community how they are going to engage in this what we do know is that the interests of the region and of Sudan and Uganda are primarily driving this peace deal and perhaps those issues may take about Said's do Hamid was just talking about political will you were speaking a moment ago about the complexity of this conflict look even if the politicians adhere to this framework to this agreement are they going to be able to keep their fighters in line that's an interesting one first of all we have seen the smaller groups saying that they serious lack of consistency in the location of power sharing so we see that from there that there is a group that is disgruntled right from the start and a lot of times they are also interests we did the group so even though the leaders like premature Salva Kiir have signed the disagreements and the you know waxing lyrical about the prospects and their confidence that it's not going to collapse this time around there is a possibility that there are certain interests within their groups that could go against their wish example has been given or Malone who is now in the opposition in the last the last time fighting broke out in 2016 Malone was very much at the center of it all and he was representing some of the interests that then went against that went against the spirit of togetherness of having a unity government so that example could be seen in other inches that could come up and that could become spoilers of these peace agreement Ally the US has backed South Sudanese independence they gave billions of dollars in aid over the years but just earlier this year America was warning South Sudan that their support might end if the war there didn't is this one of the reasons why this peace deal was coming together and what role is the u.s. playing in all of this right now well I think the reasons for the peace deal coming together have a lot more to do with the regional interest but also the government the sitting government's own desire to maintain legitimacy and need an extension needs some way to hold on to office and a peace deal obviously provides that it's less about the the u.s. role in that respect I think the United States is very frustrated with the peace process is frustrated with the South Sudanese and issued a statement the White House issued a statement not long ago saying it was concerned in the direction the peace process was taking I think the concerns remain I think that there's a great deal of skepticism over whether a power-sharing is the right approach I should acknowledge that as somebody who was involved in the earlier mediations we did pursue a power-sharing approach I think the fact that failed is a good evidence to suggest it shouldn't be tried again in a very very similar fashion that new innovation is needed in the United States is upset that there hasn't been more substantive progress in terms of the humanitarian situation in terms of addressing the conflict and so there is a concern that this political process isn't going to solve the problems and therefore needs to be reconsidered although there isn't clarity within the administration about how one might go about doing that and so clearly supporting the region has been the basic principle of the last few years that some extent remains but there are still concerns Muhammad Ali was talking about humanitarian concerns just then and I want to ask you to expand on that because millions of South Sudanese depend on foreign aid to survive and aid agencies have worried in the past about donor fatigue if this peace deal falls through or if this iteration of the peace deal falls through will that make it that much harder for aid to be flowing into South Sudan I think it's already extreme hard and I think donor fatigue is one of the issues that has hit South Sudan in particular extremely hard with with trying to meet the contributions necessary to provide humanitarian assistance to the South Sudanese people as you say millions of people it's four million people who are displaced either inside internally in South Sudan with hundreds of thousands in the protection of civilian sites or two and a half million people outside of the country in neighboring countries a million in Uganda what this peace deal potentially does do is give a bit more of a lift in terms of being able to concretely provide for humanitarian access to difficult to reach areas if it were to to last that is and if fighting you know local fighting as well as inter-communal fighting in in many areas where to where to see sort of two levels were to drop as a result of that but I think on the on the global level the difficulty will remain the challenge will be huge in trying to meet the humanitarian needs the UN has consistently said that in the last six months or so and it's a regional challenge as much as it is a challenge in South Sudan and I think the UN in particular and agencies that it has been supporting have been very over stretched and let's not forget that South Sudan being one of the worst conflicts globally we have also seen an increase in targeting of of humanitarians working in South Sudan and that has made them rightly of course risk-averse German I mean the UN says the UN says it is the deadliest place for humanitarian workers in the world correct absolutely I think I can't remember the number but over 170 killed in the last two or three years one of the deadliest places in the world and and it and it has made you know that the work of meeting the needs of South Sudanese people who are displaced and who were vulnerable and that's up to 70% of the population meeting those needs extremely difficult and and and those challenges I think are likely to be ongoing for the international community but but as I said there is a glimmer of hope in that if this current peace process and we're talking along a long way ahead is able to hold then that will at least enable more solid humanitarian access to student a more difficult to reach areas in South Sudan but also I'm sorry I'm sorry to interrupt it's just that we're almost out of time I just want to get one more question in to do here do you heard Hamid speaking about the humanitarian crisis the impact of it I want to ask you specifically about the displacement crisis there's over two million South Sudanese that fled the war in South Sudan living in neighboring countries what happens to them now do you think we'll be safe for them to be able to come back would they want to come back I think given the fact that there has been in the past the breaking of ceasefires and agreements have not been able to hold I think they would be very skeptical to come back immediately there has to be some level of confidence creating and that would happen in the in seeing that so the economy is flourishing the oil is soared and most importantly what has been said is that maybe the oil and the money that is generated in the economy is not the problem the problem is how it is managed and many of the people in government in South Sudan have been accused of corruption and diverting money that is meant for development there is just the word we're out of time we're gonna have to end it there we're out of time gentlemen we thank you so much for joining us
