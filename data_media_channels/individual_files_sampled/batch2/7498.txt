I do want to toss to me a love representative Mia love who is a Republican she appeared on CNN and was asked about with her not she thought Trump statements were racist let's hear from her where the comments racist do you think well yeah I I think they were yes I think that there were unfortunate I I don't know if they were taken I I wasn't in the room I know that comments were made I don't know which context they were made Jake I can't defend the indefensible you have to understand that there are stood there are countries that do struggle out there but there are people there people are good people and they're part of they're part of us we're Americans it was really it was really difficult to hear especially because my parents are such big supporters of the president and I think that we have to do everything we can to make sure that we are coming from a place of compassion and we're speaking from a place of kindness I mean that is the that is the at least minimal standard here I think that one of the things we need to do is get people like me in the room there are so many people that are that frankly I want to just make sure that everyone knows that I don't know if those comments would have been made if I were actually in the room there are so many people that really care about this issue will heard Carlos corbello people on both sides of the aisle that should have been in that room talking about daca so that's that's the first thing we have to make sure that we have the right people in the room talking about these issues there's there's a lot of healing there's a lot of I still think that he should apologize I think that there are people that are looking for an apology and I think that that would show real leadership Mia love by the way just to really emphasize this is the first Haitian American elected into office in Congress and she more yeah just as important it for the context of this story she's a conservative Republican so now I'm gonna say to me a love and Tim Scott what bankers told me a long time ago and turn out to be right you're in the wrong room and we told you so me and love came and said I don't know Republicans love black people and that's why I'm proud to be a Republican issue got elected in Utah and oops yeah it turns out look you can't say it's not just Republicans that it's just Donald Trump Republican voters had 17 choices in that primary and it's not like they didn't know what Trump was about Trump was very clear he called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and he started surging in the polls right after that that was not the bug that was the feature and he attacked all Muslims including Muslim American citizens but Mia you're now Muslim so you didn't give a crap you're not Mexican so you didn't give a crap and you wanted two tax cuts for the rich and you wanted to please your donors and whatever other thoughts that you had and so you thought it's okay they won't come for me I mean they won't come for the trade unionists and they'll come for other people but they won't come for me guess what happened Mia they came for you it turns out you're Haitian or your parents are Haitian now all of a sudden you find out that Republicans like Donald Trump who is your leader your leader not my leader your leader okay he's the leader of your party and all those other Republican senators in the room defending him they don't like you either Mia color me surprised Tim Scott the only African American Republican senator talks to Lindsey Graham and another senator another Republican from his own state or South Carolina says did he say Lindsey Graham says yeah he said it and so Tim Scott is aggrieved Tim you thought the Republicans weren't racist is that what you thought okay I'm waiting for Tim Scott Mia love and all those others to apologize to us and say oh I guess they were oops oops all those times they want to take civil rights away from african-americans they want to take voting rights away from African Americans they wanted to see they pretended Obama was giving out Obama phones to only African Americans they said that African Americans are bums and taking welfare and you help them Mia love and Tim Scott you help them with that ideology and then you turn around go oh he's coming after me it turns out he's racist yeah no shithole Sherlock so I mean look Trump definitely had some pretty terrible comments in regard to african-americans and blacks in the United States during the election as well and so it's not like you know Mia love didn't experience some of his statements regarding you know black communities throughout the country she heard it we all heard it and he's an equal-opportunity discriminator you know like he has gone after Koreans he has gone after every group of people you could possibly imagine except why is that whites because there are good people even if there are white nationalists who run people over and murder them you know there are good people on that side as well according to Donald Trump but what's interesting to me is that Trump has provided an interesting case study for the Republican Party because right before Trump remember what they were trying to do they were trying to rid themselves of that identity of that discriminatory hateful identity they wanted to reach out to the Latino voters because they've always you know had issues getting them to vote along with the party they tried to convince people that you know they didn't hate the black community they wanted to you know create better opportunities for them Trump comes in he says all these crazy things right these terrible racist things and it's interesting to see who falls in line with Trump who basically says yeah I forget about that agenda where we try to lie to people about who we really are we're gonna go ahead and side with Trump anyway you know some Republicans aren't buying it but a lot of them are and it's really interesting one last thing about me I love so now she's getting a lot of love in the mainstream media because they love to give Republicans credit they love it right it's me I love it called out Donald Trump and you know saying that he's racist that he can't defend the indefensible well let's pause for one more second here put aside all other groups put aside Muslims nobody in mainstream media likes Muslims anyway when he says when he said during the campaign we should ban Muslim American citizens from coming back in the country people who are like oh wow that's a little controversial I mean if he said Dola the Jews back into the country okay everybody would have rightfully rightfully been furious right all this but Muslims spit on them move on it's not that big a deal fine okay let's let's just talk about one group Mexicans so he said they're criminals and rapists coming into this country Mia where were you oh and it's about you all the sudden you realize the president is racist but when he was going after Mexicans and saying those terrible things about them where were you Mia where were you I didn't see you on CNN I didn't see you jumping out going wait a minute our leader of the Republican Party cannot say these things about Mexicans I didn't see you defending them I didn't see you defending anyone else now that it's your parents oh oh my god it turns out he's coming after me too well I didn't bargain for that well I hope you are you got rich off of this and I hope you got powerful off of this and I got oh I hope you got whatever you aim to get out of it but you get no credit because you never defended anyone else so spare me the crocodile tears now that you find out Trump and Republican voters are also not in favor of you what you just watched was one of the videos that we do
