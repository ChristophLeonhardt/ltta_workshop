1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
man afford under surveillance cNN has
learned that investigators wiretapped

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,970
former Trump campaign Chairman Paul
Manafort under secret court order both

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,540
before and after the 2016 election and
that surveillance continued into this

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,430
year including a period when mana fort
wasn't working for the campaign but was

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,140
known to talk with President Donald
Trump Pamela brown Evan president

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,920
shamone pro-q PES broke this story and
they are out front tonight so much to

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,520
ask all of you as this break so Evan
let's just start off with the bottom

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,059
line here what are you learning tonight
well Aaron sources tell us that the FBI

9
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,899
got permission from the secretive
Surveillance Court to monitor Paul

10
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,890
Manafort the former Trump campaign
chairman before and after the election

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,910
now this is an extraordinary step for
the FBI to do surveillance on a

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,050
high-ranking campaign official and of
course Manafort is now at the center of

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,219
the Russia meddling investigation we're
told that there are intercepted

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,329
communications that raise concerns about
whether Manafort was encouraging the

15
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,260
Russians to help with the campaign
now other sources told us that this

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,590
intelligence was not conclusive enough
Robert

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,010
Special Counsel Robert Muller's team has
been provided all of these

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,869
communications Aaron so even when you
say encouraging manna for encouraging

19
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,790
Russians to help with the campaign
obviously the weight of everything is on

20
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,840
that word encouraging what do you mean
by it right there's a lot we don't know

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,009
about exactly what was said am i worried
this is beyond just wiretap it's also

22
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,479
surveillance of all kinds including
searches that the FBI is authorized to

23
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,170
do but we're told that the FBI has
communications between suspected Russian

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,670
operatives relaying what they claimed
were discussions with Manafort as well

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,990
as communications involving Manafort
none of this has amounted to what people

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,040
consider a smoking gun in this
investigation there's still more work

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,790
being done to determine whether there's
a criminal violation here we didn't get

28
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,899
a comment from Paul Manafort spokesman
but Manafort has previously denied that

29
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,619
he ever knowingly communicated with
Russian intelligence operatives during

30
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,450
the election he's also denied helping
Russia undermine the US interests Aaron

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,959
so Pamela you're reporting here that
Paul Manafort has been monitored

32
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,540
once but twice that's right Aaron so our
team is told that the secret order began

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,670
after mana four became the subject of an
FBI investigation in 2014 we previously

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,260
reported that centered on work done by a
group of Washington consulting firms for

35
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,799
Ukraine's former ruling party our
sources say and the surveillance was

36
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,750
discontinued at some point last year for
lack of evidence according to one of the

37
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,639
sources and then the FBI restarted the
surveillance after obtaining a new FISA

38
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,790
warrant that extended at least into
early this year

39
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,720
the sources say the second warrant was
part of the FBI's efforts to investigate

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,159
ties between Trump campaign associates
and suspected Russian operatives now it

41
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,540
is unclear when that new warrant started
and as part of the the FISA warrant

42
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,099
we've learned Aaron that earlier this
year the FBI conducted a search of a

43
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,480
storage facility belonging to Paul
Manafort and as you'll recall this past

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,430
July under Robert Muller's direction the
FBI raided his home in Virginia and of

45
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,680
course we knew that but as part of what
you're breaking tonight

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,030
that that rate of the storage facility
obviously new information we know he had

47
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,540
a storage facility until this hour and
we didn't know that they had raided it

48
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,799
so that's also very significant
shamone do you know though whether

49
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,829
President Trump spoke to manna fort
while he was under surveillance that of

50
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:31,150
course could be crucial here as well
yeah exactly our an extremely crucial

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,470
but what we do know and what we've been
told by sources is that the president

52
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,359
and Manafort were still talking earlier
this year well after the campaign and it

53
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,909
is a time that we've learned the FBI was
listening to manna firts phone calls so

54
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:50,409
it is possible that those phone
conversations were collected during that

55
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:55,030
surveillance as they were listening to
them so that we don't have a specific

56
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,199
answer for but it is possible Aaron all
right which is a crucial point and of

57
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,549
course the President had said vocally
again and again that he was wiretapped

58
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,699
and that he meant that to mean not just
phones but all kinds of surveillance was

59
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:10,689
he right well not exactly so we do know
that you know and the Justice Department

60
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,400
has spoken out about this and they have
denied that the president's own lines

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,529
were tapped were wiretap but as we said
it is possible that he was picked up on

62
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,670
Manafort surveillance we should know
that madam for

63
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,530
does have a residence in Trump Tower but
it is not clear if the FBI did

64
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,960
surveillance on madam Ford at Trump
Tower

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,380
so so Pam what does this mean all of
this for the Moller investigation as you

66
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,030
and Evan point out he now is in
possession of whatever came from this

67
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,820
this this wiretap right he is in
possession it is in his hands and the

68
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,840
PAS man afford investigation has been
really the most visible investigation

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,610
under Robert Muller the Special Counsel
started in May and and there we know

70
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,520
that there is a raid on his storage
facility before Robert Miller took over

71
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,220
but then you have that raid this past
July it's unclear if those stemmed from

72
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,570
any of the intelligence that was
gathered under the FISA warrant but it

73
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,880
is clear that investigators are still
very interested in de Paul Manafort

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,660
under the direction of Robert Muller
Aaron and having a couple questions here

75
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,190
a one obviously manna fort for some time
with all of this focus I'm sure has been

76
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,700
careful in what he says and how he
communicates but but do you know if this

77
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,120
surveillance is still ongoing in any way
and what is the significance that they

78
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,860
were able to get this crucial FISA
warrant to do it well we don't know

79
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,760
exactly when the the timeline of the
surveillance whether it has ended

80
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,930
whether it is continuing to this day but
look the fact that they were able to get

81
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,770
a FISA warrant is a big deal the fact is
this has to get approval from the

82
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,880
highest levels of the Justice Department
and the FBI before agents can carry out

83
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,330
this type of surveillance it's
considered so intrusive that you almost

84
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,860
never find out that these FISA warrants
are authorized Aaron and then the other

85
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,470
thing is that you have to present proof
or suspicions that someone is acting as

86
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,180
an agent of a foreign power all of this
goes into providing the paperwork that

87
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,230
these judges then have to approve before
allowing the FBI to do this type of

88
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,800
surveillance it's very intrusive work
very interested working obviously very

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,490
not easy to get really hard to get as
you all point out all right thank you so

90
00:06:20,490 --> 00:00:00,000
much
