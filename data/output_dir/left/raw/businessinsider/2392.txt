00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,969
our guest today is Roger<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron bird who</font>

2
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,440
is a former Wall Streeter turned

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,510
entrepreneur and investor roger<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,369
watching this whole wall street meltdown

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,590
chiefing at the big we have good ideas

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,269
on how we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna fix the place so</font>

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,519
Roger what do we do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wall Street</font>

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,830
sure no Henry it's obviously a seemingly

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,269
intractable problem but I think there

10
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a couple of basic things that we can</font>

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,440
do to kind of make the industry more

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,660
transparent and to also protect the US

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,180
taxpayer you know point one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think a</font>

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,950
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the counter instruments</font>

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,170
that have exploded to the point of you

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">know tens of trillions of dollars</font>

17
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,410
exposure really need to be moved towards

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,329
exchanges so I think heightened

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,670
transparency which will make bank

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,739
balance sheets much clearer is one piece

21
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the puzzle so not eliminate them to</font>

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,550
simply make them more aware so we have

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,620
some idea of what is in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that</font>

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies every quarter or saying</font>

25
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,739
here's what our<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a word</font>

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,409
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly I mean many of the</font>

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,790
assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are on bank balance sheet</font>

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,049
subject themselves well to being

29
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,350
exchange-traded with central margining

30
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,240
and clear price transparency there are

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,650
some others that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not but I think</font>

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there need to be more stringent</font>

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
capital requirements for those less

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,689
liquid non-transparent assets than there

35
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,299
have been previously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think another big</font>

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,700
point is the kind of segregation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,520
true proprietary<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk taking from the</font>

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,040
customer business and what we've seen is

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,869
we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought hedge funds growing</font>

40
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">up within these bags and the problem is</font>

41
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,650
in the wake of the bailout we've been

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,189
bailing out their hedge fund which

43
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">really shouldn't be the case if you look</font>

44
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,880
at Goldman<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sachs it is a hedge fund with</font>

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,229
a little customer service business

46
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,270
attached on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side which would be nice</font>

47
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,439
in any other world but when you're

48
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,880
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 billion a quarter out of your</font>

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,649
trading business<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously totally</font>

50
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,540
secondary business there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no question</font>

51
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,950
that you know because the cost of

52
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,450
capital to them and running this hedge

53
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,540
fund is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> its approaching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

54
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,680
with today's low interest rate

55
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,960
environment and the Fed backstop it's

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,640
completely unfair and non-competitive

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,350
relative to independent hedge funds that

58
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,180
have to deal with their prime rotors and

59
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,500
financing requirements that are much

60
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,750
much more stringent so how do you

61
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,680
completely separate them

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,909
you can have them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same but you</font>

63
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:14,439
have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules for each I mean to</font>

64
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">me there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two they're really two</font>

65
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,739
separate pockets<font color="#E5E5E5"> a proprietary trading</font>

66
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,299
there's the trading that supports the

67
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:20,650
customer business<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like the back</font>

68
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,329
book trading within the sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

69
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,739
trading infrastructure and then you've

70
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">got these very separate hedge fund</font>

71
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,909
businesses and you know Goldman's is run

72
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:29,500
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the asset management side which</font>

73
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,049
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> readily separable to me that should</font>

74
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:33,819
be outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should not be inside the</font>

75
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,620
firm and we should not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the hook</font>

76
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,349
for providing them this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bonus</font>

77
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,930
financing that we have been really in

78
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,579
perpetuity to break up Goldman Sachs

79
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,769
basically yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in general every</font>

80
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,329
Wall Street firm has one of these

81
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,329
businesses now granted you saw with with

82
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">City andy hall they just separated out</font>

83
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,590
his business I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logical</font>

84
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,379
evolution of these hedge fund operations

85
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,819
that really aren't supporting any

86
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,459
customer activity anything else I think

87
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,200
of science<font color="#E5E5E5"> battle in court requirements</font>

88
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,780
do we let them go bust do we certify

89
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,879
that they can't go bust this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

90
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">too-big-to-fail thing well I think the</font>

91
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,870
too-big-to-fail becomes less of an issue

92
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,669
when most of the assets are

93
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,319
exchange-traded and the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> will then</font>

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,299
set the capital requirements on these

95
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:17,709
liquid assets and we have the central

96
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,389
counterparty clearing and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

97
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,129
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting these these subsidized</font>

98
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,840
hedge fund businesses out of there and

99
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,519
we're really focusing on the customer

100
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,470
business those two things will go a long

101
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,930
way towards mitigating our exposure in

102
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,790
creating a healthier industry so here's

103
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,000
the 64 bazillion<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollar but any chance</font>

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">of any of this happening or as financial</font>

105
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,560
reform just completely did it seemed it

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,239
seems to me the way the political<font color="#E5E5E5"> winds</font>

107
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,220
have been blowing that yeah it's very

108
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,419
unlikely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to see the</font>

109
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,889
kind of changes I'm talking about we'll

110
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,810
see it in pockets like I do think that

111
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,849
we'll see more over-the-counter

112
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,590
derivatives traded on exchanges but is

113
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,060
there going to be this requirement that

114
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,680
the credit derivative market will now

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,720
completely migrate to an OTC construct

116
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,659
no do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

117
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,129
legislators are going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> Goldman</font>

118
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:02,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sachs spin-off what's effectively a</font>

119
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,129
hedge fund within their confines no

120
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,530
should they yes but I mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

121
00:04:08,530 --> 00:00:00,000
game as well as I do I do thanks Ryder
