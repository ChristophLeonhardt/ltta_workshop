1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,110
THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU AN

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,846
INDICATION WHERE KIM'S MIND IS.

3
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:06,848
ED: WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR ALL

4
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:07,615
THOSE CLUES.

5
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:11,385
JOINING US TO GET INSIGHT ON THE

6
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:12,487
STAKES HERE.

7
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:18,326
LET'S TALK TO WALID PHARES.

8
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:20,795
WALID, YOU HAVE BEEN SUCH A

9
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:23,598
SHARP ANALYST OF ALL OF THESE

10
00:00:23,598 --> 00:00:24,465
FAST-MOVING EVENTS.

11
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:26,834
AND A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN TRYING

12
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,703
OVER THE LAST HOUR AS WE HAVE

13
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:30,338
BEEN HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS.

14
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:32,640
WHAT IS THE MOTIVE OF KIM

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:32,974
JONG-UN?

16
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:35,643
WHY DOES HE WANT TO COME TO THE

17
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:35,943
TABLE?

18
00:00:35,943 --> 00:00:38,379
YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT.

19
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:40,448
>> THIS IS THE BEST QUESTION TO

20
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,415
BEGIN WITH.

21
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:43,751
WHAT I CALL THE GENESIS OF WHY

22
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,286
THE DICTATOR WANTED TO ENGAGE

23
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:46,754
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

24
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:48,389
I WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY WHY

25
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,825
DID HE START HIS ESCALATION.

26
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:56,497
LOBBING HOSE MISSILES CLOSE TO

27
00:00:56,497 --> 00:01:00,134
THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

28
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:01,803
THERE IS A DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH

29
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:03,604
KOREA THAT IS PROMPTING HIS

30
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:04,172
ACTIONS.

31
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:06,340
HE WANTS A GUARANTEE THAT HE'LL

32
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,276
COME OUT AS A WINNER.

33
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,577
AND PROBABLY THE SITUATION HAS

34
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:11,345
TO DO WITH THE ECONOMICS OF THE

35
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:12,046
COUNTRY.

36
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,782
IT HAS ALSO TO DO WITH THE

37
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:16,350
POSSIBILITY FOR HIM TO SUSTAIN

38
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,920
THE SITUATION.

39
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,721
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR

40
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:22,924
HIM AS WELL AND HIS REGIME.

41
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:25,259
AND THE ROLE OF CHINA IS

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,328
INTERESTING THOUGHT IT IS IN THE

43
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:30,298
BACKGROUND, I ASSUME.

44
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,500
ED: I WANT TO ALERT OUR VIEWERS

45
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,036
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN,

46
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:37,572
THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES AT THE

47
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:39,874
PALACE IN SINGAPORE WHERE PRIME

48
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:42,143
MINISTER LEE WILL BE RECEIVING

49
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:42,844
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

50
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:43,511
STATES.

51
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:49,116
YOU SEE OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH I I

52
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,419
PHOTOGRAPH --ERS AND YOUNGER

53
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:52,320
STAFFERS.

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,526
THE PREGAME TO THIS BIG SUMMIT.

55
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:02,396
BUT IN THE MEANTIME I DON'T WANT

56
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,699
TO INTERRUPT YOUR IMPORTANT

57
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:05,132
ANALYSIS.

58
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,935
ARE YOU SAYING WE DON'T HAVE A

59
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:10,170
CLEAR ANSWER?

60
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,875
ARE YOU DISCERNING THERE IS

61
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:19,313
INTELLIGENCE ABOUT POSSIBLE COUP

62
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:19,780
ATTEMPTS?

63
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,819
OR KIM JONG-UN RUNNING OUT OF

64
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:25,152
CASH?

65
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,088
ARE YOU SPECULATING SOMETHING

66
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:30,091
BIG HAS BEEN HAPPENING INSIDE

67
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,927
THE BORDERS THE PAST FEW YEARS.

68
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:38,266
>> IT COULD BE SIMPLY A COLLAPSE

69
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,500
OF CIVIL SOCIETY.

70
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,936
THAT IS SOMETHING NO DICTATOR

71
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:42,703
CAN CONFRONT.

72
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:46,173
WHAT HE NEEDS ARE IMPORTANT

73
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:48,209
INFLUX OF ECONOMIC AID FOR THE

74
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,710
REGIME TO CONTINUE FOR THE

75
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,912
INSTITUTIONS TO CONTINUE.

76
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,813
THOSE WHO CAN HELP THEM ARE NOT

77
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:54,949
JUST THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO

78
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,986
SOUTH KOREA, CHINA, JAPAN.

79
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:01,188
HE IS HEADING TOWARD AN

80
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:02,623
AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED

81
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:03,491
STATES, NEGOTIATIONS.

82
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,059
WAY HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT THE

83
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,895
PAST TWO HOURS, HIS REALISM WE

84
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:10,731
ARE GOING TO EXPECT IS NOT AN

85
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:11,632
IMMEDIATE OVERNIGHT CHANGE.

86
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,734
BUT A ROADMAP TO THAT CHANGE.

87
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,102
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE

88
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:16,537
THE AIM OF THE NEGOTIATIONS IN

89
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:19,340
THE TWO PARTIES.

90
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,276
ED: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT

91
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:22,710
ROADMAP.

92
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,112
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE HOW

93
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:27,882
YOU DEFINE DENUCLEARIZATION CAN

94
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:31,018
BE FAR DIFFERENT FROM THE NORTH

95
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,586
KOREAN SIDE THAN THE U.S. SIDE.

96
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:35,723
IF YOU WERE ADVISING THIS

97
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:37,558
PRESIDENT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK

98
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:40,061
HE SHOULD BE GETTING FROM THESE

99
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,528
TALKS?

100
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:43,597
IS IT WORTH THE EFFORT IF KIM

101
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:46,200
JONG-UN SAYS OVER FIVE, SIX,

102
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,171
SEVEN YEARS HE'LL DENUCLEARIZE?

103
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,673
>> I AM NOT SURE HE'LL PUT A

104
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,941
TIME FRAME.

105
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,776
IF THEY COME UP WITH A PRINCIPLE

106
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,245
OF YES WE AGREE ON

107
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,981
DENUCLEARIZATION AND YES WE

108
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:02,216
AGREE ON A PEACE DEAL, THAT'S

109
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:03,684
THE MOST OF IMPORTANT WITH SOUTH

110
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:04,485
KOREA.

111
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:08,856
WE AGREE TO HAVE A

112
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:10,157
NON-BELLIGERENT TREATY WITH THE

113
00:04:10,157 --> 00:04:12,259
UNITED STATES, THAT WOULD BE

114
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:12,693
VICTORY.

115
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,595
WHAT WOULD THEY GET IN RETURN

116
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:16,897
TORE THAT, THEY WILL GET AN

117
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:17,531
ECONOMIC PLAN.

118
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:22,103
I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT A

119
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:25,239
MARSHALL PLAN.

120
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:25,706
AND CHINA.

121
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:28,709
ED: LET'S TALK ABOUT SINGAPORE.

122
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,445
MANY SAY SINGAPORE AS A HOST CAN

123
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,447
PROVIDE THE PROPER SECURITY AND

124
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,216
THEY ARE THE SWITZERLAND OF

125
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:35,983
ASIA.

126
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:38,586
THEY DON'T PICK SIDE, AND THEY

127
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,988
HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH

128
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:42,423
NORTH KOREA.

129
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:44,191
WITH KIM JONG-UN TAKING HIS

130
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:47,428
LONGEST FOREIGN TRIP AS

131
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:48,796
CHAIRMAN, WEEK SEE SOMEONE

132
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:50,564
STANDING AT ATTENTION AS IF THE

133
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:52,967
PRESIDENT MAY ARRIVE, SO WE ARE

134
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,335
KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT.

135
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,637
IS THERE A SENSE KIM JONG-UN

136
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:59,273
BEING IN A COUNTRY LIKE

137
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:01,275
SINGAPORE, SO RICH IN ALL THE

138
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:02,943
INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE, IS THIS

139
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:05,079
GIVEN A LOOK OF WHAT THE FUTURE

140
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,815
OF NORTH KOREA COULD BE?

141
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:11,652
>> THAT'S ANOTHER VERY GOOD

142
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:12,319
QUESTION.

143
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,488
SINGAPORE IS REPRESENTATIVE WHAT

144
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:18,292
WOULD BE AN ASIAN SUCCESS

145
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,127
ECONOMICALLY.

146
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:22,596
CHINA AND JAPAN, DEEP INSIDE KIM

147
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:25,433
IS LOOKING AT THOSE EXAMPLES.

148
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,202
HE KNOWS VERY WELL HE WOULD COME

149
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,638
FROM MINUS 50 TO GET TO ZERO IN

150
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:33,908
HIS OWN COUNTRY.

151
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:36,310
BUT TO GET THERE HE NEED TO

152
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,412
SOLVE ONE IMPORTANT POINT, THAT

153
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:40,581
HIS REGIME HAS GUARANTEED.

154
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,783
ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT HE'S NOT

155
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,984
GOING TO GO FOR.

156
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:46,654
HE WON'T GO FOR REFORMS THAT

157
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:48,389
WILL CHANGE THE REGIME AT THIS

158
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,290
STAGE.

159
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,158
THAT WOULD BE OUR GUARANTEE TO

160
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:53,160
HIM AND HIS GUARANTEE TO US

161
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,695
WOULD BE THE NUKES.

162
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,465
ED: WHAT DOES YOUR GUT TELL YOU

163
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:59,333
ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY

164
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,768
OUT THE NEXT DAY OR TWO?

165
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,736
>> I HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW.

166
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,572
I THINK MOST OF OF THE

167
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,540
NEGOTIATIONS ISSUES WERE ALREADY

168
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,441
REVIEWED BY BOTH SIDES.

169
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:10,611
WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO TO

170
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,881
SINGAPORE NOT KNOWING WHAT WE

171
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:14,715
ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT.

172
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:16,817
MOST OF OF IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED

173
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:19,453
AND AGREED UPON IN PRINCIPLE.

174
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:23,457
THE DETAILS WILL BE TALKED

175
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:23,757
ABOUT.

176
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:27,061
ED: ARE YOU SAYING -- I LIED

177
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,696
WHEN I SAID LAST QUESTION

178
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:31,065
BECAUSE WE ARE EXPECTING THE

179
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:32,933
PRESIDENT AT ANY MOMENT AND

180
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,702
WE'LL GO TO HIM LIVE IN A

181
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:35,035
SECOND.

182
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:36,670
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

183
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,439
CAREFUL IN LOWERING

184
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:38,873
EXPECTATIONS.

185
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:41,175
THIS IS ROUND ONE, I WANT TO

186
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:42,309
START A DIALOGUE.

187
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:46,147
IS THAT A PUBLIC POSTURE WHEN AS

188
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:47,281
YOU SUGGESTED PRIVATE?

189
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,283
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT THE

190
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,319
DETAILS MORE THAN THEY LET ON?
