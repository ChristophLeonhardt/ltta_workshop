PLUS, PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKES A STATEMENT BY CELEBRATING THE NATION INSTEAD OF THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE. BUT FIRST, WE HAVE BIG BREAKING NEWS FROM CAPITOL HILL. FORMER FBI DIRECTOR ANDREW McCABE IS OFFERING COMMITMENT. FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH TO TESTIFY WHEN THE IG REPORT ON THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION IS FINALLY RELEASED. REPORTING THIS. THE FBI ESPIONAGE CHIEF HAS BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE WITH CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS. THE SOURCE SAYS THAT STRUCK PLAYED AN EVEN LARGER ROLE THAN WE THOUGHT INITIALLY IN THE CLINTON EMAIL PROBE AND THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION. LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THIS NOW WITH CONGRESSMAN RON DeSANTIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST RICHARD GOODSTEIN AND A FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT DRISCOLL. GENTLEMEN, IT'S GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU. WHERE DO WE BEGIN, LET'S START WITH THIS IMMUNITY PLEA FOR McCABE. EVERY TIME YOU HEAR SOMEONE CONNECTED WITH TRUMP WHO MIGHT WANT IMMUNITY, IT'S LIKE, OH, MY GOSH, YOU WANT IMMUNITY, YOU MUST BE GUILTY. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? JAMES COMEY STOOD TALL AND WAS A MODEL LEADER AND NOW HE WANTS IMMUNITY BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S JEOPARDY WITH HIS CONDUCT OVER THIS INVESTIGATION, BOTH THE CLINTON AND THE TRUMP INVESTIGATION. I WOULD NOT GIVE HIM IMMUNITY, I WOULD MAKE HIM GO, IF HE'S GOING TO PLEAD THE FIFTH AMENDMENT THEN HE SHOULD PLEAD THE FIFTH AMENDMENT BUT THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD GET SOME TYPE OF GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD FOR THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL WANT TO SEE. Laura: RICHARD? THE PRESIDENT SAID IN TWEETS ABOUT McCABE, LIED, LIED, LIED. HE CALLED HIS WIFE A LOSER, CLASSIC MOVE. BIG WE HAVE VERY LIMITED TIME, I WANT TO KEEP US FOCUSED ON THE FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WANTING IMMUNITY. IF HE HAD NOTHING TO HIDE A COMPANY IF HE WAS A BORE AND HAD INFORMATION TO RELEASE TO THE MEDIA, WHY WAS HE ASKING FOR IMMUNITY? THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. WHEN THE PRESIDENT ASKED FOR THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, PLEASE BRING THAT BACK. Laura: WHEN IS THE PRESIDENT ASKING FOR THE FIFTH AMENDMENT? HERE'S WHAT I MEAN. IF YOU HAVE AN PRESIDENT THAT ISSUES PARDONS WILLY-NILLY, McCABE WOULD BE OUT OF HIS MIND NOT TO SEEK IMMUNITY WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. Laura: RICHARD COME HIS OWN LAWYER IS SAYING HE'S CONCERNED. HE SHOULD BE CONCERNED WHEN HE HAS THE PRESIDENT GOING AFTER PEOPLE LIKE CRAZY. Laura: THIS IS A CRIMINAL REFERRAL, THOUGH THAT WAS MADE BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. THE INSPECTOR GENERALLY THE PREDICATE FOR THIS. I GET IT THAT YOU DON'T LIKE TRUMP. IT'S A BIG NATION AND I'M GLAD WE HAVE OPINIONS ON THE SHOW. BUT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IN A NONPARTISAN CONSONANT PROFESSIONAL INSPECTOR GENERAL, HE BASICALLY SAID HE WAS PREVARICATING, TO PUT IT KINDLY. ROBERT, YOU CAN CHIME IN, YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND HE WANTS IMMUNITY. THIS IS A WILD SERIES OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THE FORMER FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR. AND SMART MOVE BY HIS LAWYER BECAUSE IF HE GETS IMMUNITY BY JUDICIARY THAN HE IS FREE FROM PROSECUTION BY DOJ. SO YOU'D RATHER HAVE AND EMBARRASSMENT THEN DUE TIME. IT'S ALWAYS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND JUSTICE WHEN THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND DOJ ARE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO GRANT IMMUNITY. HE WOULD HAVE TO SAY EVERYTHING HE KNOWS AND EVERYONE WILL HEAR IT. I THINK THE CHAIRMAN WOULD HAVE TO WEIGH THAT AGAINST WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DAY-TO-DAY PROSECUTION WHICH WOULD TAKE ADDITIONAL MONTHS. I THINK ALSO, DOES HE HAVE EVIDENCE, THERE ARE AT LEAST SOME REPORTS SUGGESTING THAT HE MAY HAVE AFFIRMATIVE EVIDENCE. COMEY SAID HE DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THAT SO IF HE WAS PRODUCING SOMETHING LIKE THAT Laura: BUT HE ALWAYS BACKS UP COMEY. BEFORE, WHEN THE TRUMP CONVERSATION WITH COMEY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HE BASICALLY SAID IT, HE BASICALLY SAID TO ME WHAT HE PUT IN HIS MEMO AT THE FILE. ON THE LAKE, YOU SAID HE APPROVED IT AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T APPROVE IT SO THEY ARE IN DIRECT DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT. SO THIS IG REPORT, THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY VERY FRUSTRATED. AGAIN, I WOULDN'T BE TWEETING ABOUT WHY IT WAS DELAYED BUT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO TWEET. BUT ON THE ISSUE OF THE IG REPORT, WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS DELAYED? WE KEEP HEARING IS GOING TO BE OUT EVERY DAY. THAT'S A PROBLEM, LAURA, WE HAVE A BUREAUCRACY THAT IS NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO EVERYBODY. SO WE HAD ALL THESE MAJOR PROBLEMS AND THE DEMOCRATS WERE THE ONES WHO WANTED THE REPORT. IF IT TAKES A YEAR AND A HALF TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION IT'S NOT JUST YOU NEED A SPEEDY TRIAL, YOU NEED A SPEEDY RESOLUTION. SHOWS 500 PAGES, COULD THAT REQUEST FOR IMMUNITY HAVE SOME RELEVANCE HERE IN THIS DELAY IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT? I THINK PEOPLE ARE OVER BLOWING THE DELAY. WHEN THE REPORT IS DONE, EVERYONE REPRESENTS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THAT REPORT, THEY GET TO REVIEW IT ALONE IN A ROOM AND NOT TAKE IT WITH THEM AND THEY HAVE A WEEK TO GET BACK WITH ANY COMMENTS TO THE IG WHO THEN DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT TO TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT, OR NOT. SO THE FACT THAT TWO WEEKS AFTER IT'S DONE IS ABOUT ON TIME I'D BE CONCERNED IF IT TOOK ANOTHER WEEK OR SO BUT RIGHT ABOUT NOW IS WHEN IT SHOULD BE COMING OUT, IN MY EXPERIENCE, FROM WHEN THE REPORT IS DONE TO WHEN YOU WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS. THIS IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE AND THERE ARE LOTS OF HIGH-POWERED LAWYERS INVOLVED AND MAKING OBJECTIONS. Laura: A LOT OF LAWYERS MAKE A LOT OF MONEY HERE. I WANT THIS TO COME OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT I HAVE DIFFERENT REASONS. ONE I THINK WE WILL HEAR WHAT RUDY GIULIANI WAS GETTING AWAY OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT FROM FBI AGENTS WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO BASICALLY SAY BEFORE IT HAPPENED THAT THE SECOND COMEY LETTER WAS GOING TO COME OUT. SECOND, I THINK WE WILL SEE THAT HE ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY BUT IN WAYS THAT HELP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. HE SAT ON INFORMATION ABOUT THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND HE WAS WAY OUT THERE IN WAYS THAT BROKE THE RULES BOTH IN JULY AND OCTOBER I WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE HILLARY EMAIL INVESTIGATION. SO, I'M WITH YOU. I AGREE, I HOPE IT COMES OUT TOMORROW. Laura: WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THIS NEW TEXT? IT'S A TEXT BETWEEN PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE. NOW WE LEARNED THIS TODAY BECAUSE THIS WAS RELEASED AS PART OF THE 500 PAGES OF TEXT RELEASED BY THE SENATE TODAY. HERE'S WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. IT SAYS, HE WILL GET OUR LURES ARE APPROVED, WHICH IS FBI LINGO FOR SPIES. SO THE QUESTION TONIGHT, WITH THESE SPIES POTENTIALLY SENT IN TO TARGET THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN GOING BACK TO DECEMBER OF 2015? AND IF SO, THAT COULD BE FAIRLY EXPLOSIVE, COULD IT NOT, CONGRESSMAN? BECAUSE COMEY SAID, THIS INVESTIGATION BEGAN IN JULY. THAT TEXT, AGAIN, AND WE WILL LEARN MORE, AND THE HOUSE IS NOT EXACTLY WHERE THE SENATE IS ON THIS. BUT WHEN YOU READ THAT TEXT, IT CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT THEY WERE LOOKING TO PUT MORE LURES INTO THE CAMPAIGN IN 2015. SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE REPORTING THIS TONIGHT AND WE WILL LEARN MORE, I BELIEVE. BUT WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT? WHY DID THEY REDACT THAT WORD? IT INITIALLY CAME OUT AND IT IS LIKE, OOPS, IT SAYS LURES THERE. SO THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN REJECTED? I THINK THIS IDEA THAT CROSS FIRE HURRICANE STARTED THIS ON JULY 31ST, CLEARLY THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU HAD COMEY, McCABE AND LYNCH DECIDING NOT TO BRIEF TRUMP IN APRIL WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY CONCERNED ABOUT CARTER PAGE. YOU HAD STEFON HALPER REACHING OUT TO THE CAMPAIGN BEFORE THAT SO THIS DID NOT JUST START ON THE 31ST OF JULY. I THINK HE HAS EXPOSURE AS A RESULT OF THAT TESTIMONY. I DON'T THINK HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH THERE. SO IS THERE ANY WAY HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN, IF THIS IS TRUE, THAT IT STARTED EARLIER? PERHAPS IN MAY? SO HE IS LIKE THE HEAD OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND PETER STRZOK WEST'S NUMBER TWO. NOW HE HAS BASICALLY SAID STRUCK WAS BASICALLY THE MAIN GUY IN BOTH THE HILLARY AND THE RUSSIAN COLLISION INVESTIGATION. OBVIOUSLY HE WANTED HILLARY AS PRESIDENT AND HATED TRUMP WITH A PASSION BUT, HE TRAVELED TO LONDON IN MAY OF 2016. THAT WAS, AGAIN, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE CROSS FIRE HURRICANE STARTED. I'M GOING TO DISAGREE WITH THE CONGRESSMAN ELEMENT HERE. WHAT'S TWISTED ABOUT THIS IS AT THE END OF THE DAY, STRUCK DRAFTED THE COMEY LETTER BEFORE THE ELECTION. HE ALSO SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT ERNIE, CHELSEA AND HOLDER, IN ADDITION TO TRUMP. THE SAME THINGS THAT MARCO RUBIO AND TED CRUZ WERE SAYING DURING THE CAMPAIGN. THE FACT IS, FBI, WHEN YOU LOOK BACK, THEY HELPED TRUMP BY SITTING SITTING ON INFORMATION ABOUT HIM. THE REASON THEY PUT THE LETTER OUT WAS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN BEHIND. STRUCK WANTED TO PROTECT HIS BEHIND AND COMEY'S BEHIND. BUT ONCE HE CAME OUT AND GAVE THE PRESS CONFERENCE, A KIND OF HAD TO GIVE THE LETTER. Laura: . WE WILL LEARN MORE BUT THEY REDACTED THE WORD LURES. AGAIN, LINGO FOR SPIES. FBI'S DON'T USE THE WORD SPIES BUT THEY USE THAT WORD. NONCONTIGUOUS UNIDENTIFIED INFORMANTS. SO, THAT ACRONYM, AND THEN LURES WAS UNREDACTED. SO AGAIN, YOU GET ALL OF OUR LURES APPROVED? I LOVE THE LITTLE SMILEY FACE. AND YOU KNOW, IT GOES ON FROM THERE. I THINK THE TIMELINE IS THE MOST DAMAGING THING HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE USING A BUREAUCRATIC TERM WHEN THEY SAY COME INVESTIGATION WASN'T OPEN. WHILE THAT MEANS NOTHING IF THERE WAS INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITY GOING ON BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED. SO EVEN THE FBI SAID, SOME OF THESE CONTACTS FROM OUR INFORMANTS/SPIES OCCURRED LEADING UP TO THE INVESTIGATION. WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE, DID GOD CREATE THE EARTH? WHO CREATED THAT, WHO CREATED THAT? BUT SOME WHAT HE HAS TO APPROVE Laura: REMEMBER THIS THING WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEGUN KIND OF SORT OF WHEN THAT LIST OF TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY ADVISORS, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS CAME OUT, CARTER PAGE AND GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, THEIR NAMES WERE ON IT IN THE SPRING OF 2016. BUT IF THIS GOES BACK TO 2015 AGAIN, WHAT WERE THEY WORRIED ABOUT? I MEAN, STRUCK THEY WERE PETRIFIED OF TRUMP. WHO KNOWS, MAYBE THEY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO CATCH ON. ONE OF THE PAGES IN THE TEXT WAS, POTUS WANTS TO KNOW EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING. CAN WE JUST ARE NEVER THAT WE HAVE HAD A WHOLE SEGMENTS ON SHOWS LIKE THIS ABOUT THE STRUCK SECRET SOCIETY COME ABOUT STRUCK LOST EMAILS? LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY I AGREE WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. Laura: I'M PUTTING CAVEATS AIM, AND I AGREE WITH YOU BUT THOSE ARE TECHNICAL ACRONYMS THAT ARE USED WITHIN THE BUREAU. THOSE AREN'T LOVE MESSAGES BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE FASCINATED BY THOSE, BUT THOSE ARE TECHNICAL TERMS. SO IT SEEMS LIKE, DID YOU GET APPROVAL FOR THESE LURES? AND, WAITING FOR THE ANSWER. BUT THERE WERE NO SPIES. THERE WAS ONE GUY THAT MADE A COUPLE OF APPROACHES TO PEOPLE THAT WERE TARGETED BY CIA AND FBI. ONE HOUR PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT WITH ALSO STEPHEN MILLER BEING INVITED TO THAT SAME EVENT. PAPADOPOULOS AND THEN THEY REACH OUT TO SAM CLOVIS, AND HERE'S THE THING. IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND THEIR BIG ARTICLE, THEY SAID AT LEAST ONE PERSON SO THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN JUST STUFF ON THE HALTER. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET ALL OF THE EX-ASCENT NATIONALISTS. STEPHEN MILLER IS REALLY A RUSSIAN PLANT. BUT AGAIN, THE TIMELINE IS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE DOCUMENTS, DO WE? WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FBI DOCUMENTS FROM THAT TIME. BEFORE JULY 31ST. THAT'S WHY YOU ARE GRADUALLY GETTING THE TEXT. WE HEARD FROM PAPADOPOULOS AND OTHERS THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE TRYING TO GET DIRT ON HILLARY, BUT NOT ONE PERSON IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WENT TO THE U.S. AUTHORITIES, NOT ONE. THAT'S A FACT. Laura: DO YOU THINK THIS PAPADOPOULOS THIS CHARACTER ACCOMPANIES TROLLING BARS IN LONDON AND GOING TO TRUMP TOWER AND SAYING, I'M GOING TO SET UP THIS. I THINK WE HAVE LIKE, THE
