00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,080
JUSTICE WITHIN DAYS. HOW IS HIS PRESENCE GOING TO

9
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,949
HOW IS HIS PRESENCE GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COURT’S

10
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,184
HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COURT’S RULINGS AND WHAT HAPPENS IF

00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,386
RULINGS AND WHAT HAPPENS IF ANOTHER ACCUSER COMES FORWARD

12
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:20,687
ANOTHER ACCUSER COMES FORWARD AGAINST KAVANAUGH?

13
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:22,889
AGAINST KAVANAUGH? JOINING ME NOW IS PETE WILLIAMS.

14
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,657
JOINING ME NOW IS PETE WILLIAMS. TO THE FIRST QUESTION, PETE.

15
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,860
TO THE FIRST QUESTION, PETE. WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE ARE MORE

16
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,496
WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE ARE MORE UNSETTLED ISSUES ABOUT JUDGE

17
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,565
UNSETTLED ISSUES ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH ONCE HE’S NAMED TO THE

18
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:31,865
KAVANAUGH ONCE HE’S NAMED TO THE COURT?

19
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,300
COURT? >> TWO POSSIBILITIES.

20
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:34,368
>> TWO POSSIBILITIES. ONE IS NOTHING.

21
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,802
ONE IS NOTHING. YOU MAY RECALL THAT THERE HAVE

22
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:39,306
YOU MAY RECALL THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL BOOKS WRITTEN

23
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:44,711
BEEN ADDITIONAL BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT CLARENCE

24
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,846
ABOUT CLARENCE ACCUSATIONS THAT ANITA HILL

25
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:47,180
ACCUSATIONS THAT ANITA HILL MADE.

26
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:50,817
MADE. THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN TO

27
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:51,318
THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

28
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,587
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. YOU HAD BEEN DISCUSSING THE LAST

29
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,589
YOU HAD BEEN DISCUSSING THE LAST DAY OR SO THE TALK AMONG

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,525
DAY OR SO THE TALK AMONG DEMOCRATS OF HAVING AN

31
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:02,329
DEMOCRATS OF HAVING AN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING IF THEREA

32
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,030
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING IF THEREA WAS THE CASE.

33
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,832
WAS THE CASE. THERE’S A REAL CONSTITUTIONAL

34
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,200
THERE’S A REAL CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER

35
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,202
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER IMPEACHMENT CAN BE USED BEFORE A

36
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:10,738
IMPEACHMENT CAN BE USED BEFORE A PERSON CAME INTO OFFICE.

37
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,740
PERSON CAME INTO OFFICE. CAN YOU IMPEACH SOMEONE FOR

38
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:13,841
CAN YOU IMPEACH SOMEONE FOR SOMETHING THEY DID BEFORE THEY

39
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:16,577
SOMETHING THEY DID BEFORE THEY BECAME A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE

40
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:19,046
BECAME A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE OR IS IT ONLY TO BE USED FOR

41
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:20,147
OR IS IT ONLY TO BE USED FOR PUNISHMENT, OFFICIAL MISDEEDS

42
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,281
PUNISHMENT, OFFICIAL MISDEEDS WHILE IN OFFICE.

43
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:25,853
WHILE IN OFFICE. THAT’S AN UNRESOLVED QUESTION.

44
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:31,258
THAT’S AN UNRESOLVED QUESTION. >> I’VE ASKED YOU THIS BEFORE.

45
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,628
>> I’VE ASKED YOU THIS BEFORE. HE’S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF

46
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:35,462
HE’S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF RECUSAL

47
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:35,796
RECUSAL RECUSAL.

48
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:36,564
RECUSAL. SOMETHING GETS TO THE SUPREME

49
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:37,565
SOMETHING GETS TO THE SUPREME COURT THAT HAS TO DO WITH SEXUAL

50
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,033
COURT THAT HAS TO DO WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SOMETHING THAT HAS TO

51
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,068
ASSAULT OR SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH OTHER THINGS THAT BRETT

52
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:43,037
DO WITH OTHER THINGS THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH NOW SEEMS TO REGRET

53
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,439
KAVANAUGH NOW SEEMS TO REGRET SAYING OR HAS APOLOGIZED FOR

54
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,340
SAYING OR HAS APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING DURING HIS TESTIMONY

55
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,575
SAYING DURING HIS TESTIMONY ABOUT PARTISAN POLITICS AND WHAT

56
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,377
ABOUT PARTISAN POLITICS AND WHAT HE CALLS LEFT WING GROUPS THAT

57
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:51,946
HE CALLS LEFT WING GROUPS THAT COULD BRING A CHALLENGE TO THE

58
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,380
COULD BRING A CHALLENGE TO THE SUPREME COURT.

59
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:53,648
SUPREME COURT. IT’S NOT EASY FOR A SUPREME

60
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:56,884
IT’S NOT EASY FOR A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE TO BE RECUSED FROM

61
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:57,184
COURT JUSTICE TO BE RECUSED FROM CASE.

62
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,219
CASE. >> IT’S DIFFERENT OENN THE SUPRE

63
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:01,289
>> IT’S DIFFERENT OENN THE SUPRE COURT.

64
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:01,989
COURT. THERE ARE ONLY NINE JUSTICES.

65
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,324
THERE ARE ONLY NINE JUSTICES. THERE’S NO SPARES.

66
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:06,160
THERE’S NO SPARES. IN THE DISTRICT COURT, YOU GET A

67
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:06,661
IN THE DISTRICT COURT, YOU GET A DIFFERENT JUDGE.

68
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,763
DIFFERENT JUDGE. ON THE APPEALS COURT AS WELL.

69
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:12,300
ON THE APPEALS COURT AS WELL. THERE’S NO STAND BY SUPREME

70
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:12,600
THERE’S NO STAND BY SUPREME JUSTICE.

71
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,870
JUSTICE. THAT REDUZCES THE NUMBER THAT CA

72
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:16,704
THAT REDUZCES THE NUMBER THAT CA HEAR THE CASE AND THAT’S NEVER A

73
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:17,471
HEAR THE CASE AND THAT’S NEVER A GOOD THING.

74
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:18,506
GOOD THING. THEY DECIDE THEMSELVES WHETHER

75
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,273
THEY DECIDE THEMSELVES WHETHER TO RECUSE.

76
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,909
TO RECUSE. NO ONE ELSE TELLS THEM.

77
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,311
NO ONE ELSE TELLS THEM. PARTIES CAN ASK BUT IT’S STILL

78
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:24,679
PARTIES CAN ASK BUT IT’S STILL UP TO THE JUSTICE AND THEY

79
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:27,281
UP TO THE JUSTICE AND THEY USUALLY RECUSE BECAUSE THAT HAVE

80
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:28,116
USUALLY RECUSE BECAUSE THAT HAVE A PERSONAL CONFLICT.

81
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,684
A PERSONAL CONFLICT. THEY OWN STOCK IN A COMPANY.

82
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:31,619
THEY OWN STOCK IN A COMPANY. THEY DECIDED THE CASE WHEN IT

83
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:36,023
THEY DECIDED THE CASE WHEN IT WAS IN A LOWER COURT.

84
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,926
WAS IN A LOWER COURT. RECUSAL FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL

85
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:41,763
RECUSAL FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL STRICTLY SORT OF PARTISAN OR

86
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:45,233
STRICTLY SORT OF PARTISAN OR POLICY VIEWS IS EXTREMELY RARE.

87
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:50,672
POLICY VIEWS IS EXTREMELY RARE. REMEMBER, THAT RUTH BADER

88
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:51,806
REMEMBER, THAT RUTH BADER GINSBERG WAS CRITICAL OF DONALD

89
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,541
GINSBERG WAS CRITICAL OF DONALD TRUMP AND SHE DIDN’T RECUSE WHEN

90
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:54,742
TRUMP AND SHE DIDN’T RECUSE WHEN THE BAN CAME BEFORE THE COURT

91
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:56,510
THE BAN CAME BEFORE THE COURT AND THE GOVERNMENT DIDN’T CAN

92
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:57,445
AND THE GOVERNMENT DIDN’T CAN HER TO.

93
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:00,014
HER TO. I THINK DEFENDERS OF KAVANAUGH

94
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:01,816
I THINK DEFENDERS OF KAVANAUGH WOULD SAY WHAT HE WAS

95
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:07,722
WOULD SAY WHAT HE WAS CRITICIZING IS THE WAY THE CON

96
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:09,157
CRITICIZING IS THE WAY THE CON FOR MEDICATION

97
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:09,858
FOR MEDICATION -- CONFIRMATION PROCESS WAS

98
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:10,959
-- CONFIRMATION PROCESS WAS BEING HANDLED.

99
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,662
BEING HANDLED. NOT CRITICIZING LIBERAL POLITICS

100
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:14,897
NOT CRITICIZING LIBERAL POLITICS OR LIBERAL VIEW.

101
00:03:14,931 --> 00:00:00,000
OR LIBERAL VIEW. THEY MAY TRY TO DRAW THAT
