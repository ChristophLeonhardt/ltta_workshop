this news just in a delay in the second criminal trial of trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort a federal judge in Washington has just postponed the opening arguments by nearly two weeks mana Ford faces charges including conspiring against the United States money laundering and witness tampering all right it's been months since presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani told NBC News that Special Counsel Robert Muller's team has acknowledged it cannot indict a sitting president but Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen alleged in federal court last week that then candidate Trump directed him to make or arrange hush money payments to women saying it was in hopes of influencing the 2016 election so I want to take a look at where this supposed immunity from indictment comes from for a sitting president the United States Constitution lays out a way to remove a president from office impeachment but it is silent on the criminal prosecution of a president remember impeachment is something that takes place in Congress not in the courts in 1973 at the height of the Watergate scandal the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel or OLC issued an opinion that criminal proceedings damaged the president's ability to do his job and shouldn't be brought while he's in office another OLC memo about 27 years later reinforced that original argument saying the indictment of a sitting president would undermine the entire executive branch's function but federal guidelines allow for something called extraordinary circumstances allowing Muller if he found such circumstances to request a pass from the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to go against policy and indict the president that barring something truly earth-shaking is unlikely but consider this these memos and guidelines according to the OLC website itself provide say that that the they're there to provide legal advice to the president and all executive branch agencies so outside of the executive branch of the federal government there might be another way to do this and office with the power to bring an indictment could feasibly bring one against the president that's according to Yale Law Professor on a half the way an office like a State Attorney General for example New York's Attorney General Barbara Underwood whose office is currently suing the Trump found a for quote persistent violations of state and federal law joining me now is on a Hathaway of the Yale University Law School because I figured let's bring you in since you you've been writing about this great to have you here explain to me the way in which a state attorney general like Barbara Underwood or like Joshua we just add in here might work around this prohibition or this guideline against in dining a president yeah so as you mentioned the office the legal counsel memos are binding within the executive branch but they're not binding on anybody else and so a state attorney general for instance could bring charges against the president while he is in office and would not be prohibited from doing that by the US legal counsel memos and I would assume at that point the government would be in court and a court would have to decide and the why wouldn't the government point to this office of legal counsel memo in which it said the indictment of a criminal prosecution of a sitting president would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned function so while Barbara Underwood or a state attorney general wouldn't be bound by that guidance would the government's argument not be the same it would be the same certainly it would and they would certainly point that's the legal counsel opinions and say look you know this has been decided twice by previous administrations but that's not binding on the courts either so the courts get to reassess the question on their own and decide whether they agree with office legal counsel determination on this question now you have to remember the obsolete office legal counsel lawyers are effectively the president's lawyers on it right so they're making a decision for the executive branch and they are looking at the law and they're trying to render their best opinion but they are acting as executive branch lawyers so a court is going to come in with a more objective position it's going to look at all the law and the facts and make a determination in that case as to whether to let the case go forward in the article that I read that was so interesting about this you make a point that whether or not this is likely it's it's more likely or more reasonable a thing to consider that impeachment well so the problem with impeachment is just it's really hard right so you have to get a majority of the house right now of course that's Republicans so they're not going to teach even if they're how switches to Democrats and Democrats do impeach you have to then go to the Senate for conviction in the Senate you have to get two-thirds of the Senators to vote in favor of impeachment right it's like a constitutional amendment that's right and it's it's extraordinarily difficult it's hard to get two-thirds of senators to agree on anything an impeachment is just so explosive it's hard to imagine that that would happen unless something much worse comes out and that's always possible so you know never say never but it seems unlikely at this moment hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to
