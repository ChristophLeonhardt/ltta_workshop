This is a new airbase
in the Sahara desert.
It’s home to secret drone
operations by the C.I.A.
That’s what American
and Nigerien officials
have told The Times.
This is that same location
just seven months earlier.
We’re going to show you
two things: How the base grew
out of a small
commercial airstrip
and what’s important
about this location.
This image from
January 2018 shows
a simple airstrip
surrounded by sand.
Here’s what it looked
like to land there
in a civilian plane
in August.
This is the civilian area.
Just eight days later,
we see that construction
on the drone base has begun.
That construction
moves fast.
A month later,
we see new structures
and security walls.
We also see what appear to be
several new defensive positions
beyond the compound’s walls.
By September, we see
the base has more capacity.
There’s a second
and bigger taxiway.
And that taxiway connects
to a new clamshell tent —
probably an aircraft shelter.
The layout and dimensions
are similar to those
at known drone bases.
So where is this,
and why does it matter?
The base is just outside
a town in northeastern Niger.
But here’s a twist:
The U.S. military is
building its own drone base
just 350 miles away.
It will be there to target
extremists in the region.
The C.I.A. won’t comment
on why it needs its own base.
It could be
because it’s closer
to southern Libya, which sees
a lot of extremist activity.
But it could also
reflect how the C.I.A.
is expanding its 
drone operations
under President Trump.
This would run counter
to an Obama-era policy,
one that sought to put the
military, not the C.I.A.,
in charge of drone attacks.
