Excel has a great tool called text to columns which allows you to clean up all sorts of different types of data sets so here I have a list of names and I want to break them up into two columns first name and last name I'm just going to select this data click data text to columns I'm going to select you limited because I want to use the space in between each name to separate and even see here that each name is separated where there's a space click finish and now I have a first name column and I at last name sometimes when you download data it will be in CSV format comma separated values where the data for each column is separated by a comma so if I highlight this data click text to column again this will be delimited because I'm going to separate the data wherever there the comma click the next switch this to comma instead of space if you scroll down you can preview looks good looks like it's separating the data correctly click finish and there you have it your data is exactly how you want it this is data I pulled from a Bureau of Labor Statistics press release and even though the data looks like it's in perfectly aligned columns each row is all compressed in the first cell so I want to break these out into actual columns so I'm going to highlight the first column where all my data is click text to columns now this is going to be fixed width so I click next cell will guess where the column separator should go and this looks absolutely correct so click finish and now I have a perfectly workable data set
