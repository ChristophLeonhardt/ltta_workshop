the Democratic Party or PD led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi is pro-europe and pro-immigration martyrs failed to engage younger voters Luigi DeMaio is the prime ministerial pic of the five star movement and that's an anti-establishment anti-corruption party which is said for a strong showing then there's the legal party led by Matteo salvini it is Europe's skeptic and anti-immigration and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi returns with the center-right Forza Italia party he can't hold public office because of a tax fraud conviction but could hold significant sway in a future coalition government if his party does well Lauren's Lee reports from Rome as the time arrived for voters to make their minds up there was every sign there were as many people who simply couldn't decide as those with any sort of conviction the party making much of the running is the anti politician party it's 31 year old leader held several part-time jobs before even entering politics five stars entire proposal is to create a citizen's block in opposition to the corrupt successes of the political class but 5 star have vowed not to do a coalition deal with anyone else and in the country which you can't do government without a coalition it leads many to wonder if they would prefer not to be in government at all they won't probably become the first political party to transform and to influence the transformation and the reconfiguration of political system without real government responsibility the political bloc with the best chances this group led by the eternally youthful Silvio Berlusconi the 81 year old appears to hold a magnetic attraction for his far-right allies which have campaigned entirely around identity politics blaming the European Union for what they see as an invasion of black people and Muslims from over the Mediterranean the dream scenario for the anti-establishment right-wing is this man as Prime Minister Matteo salvini wants mass deportations Italy first he says anyone who arrives here illegally must be sent back if we keep welcoming them and look after them the state will collapse it doesn't work economically or socially but if the polls are accurate the far-right might not get enough votes for a stable governments many Italians are revolted at the idea of Berlusconi choosing the next prime minister so what then it's hardly unusual for Italian politicians to promise one thing and then change their minds and even though Silvio Berlusconi insists his right-wing coalition is the only one on offer many suspect that in the events of political stasis he and the center-left might do a deal for a sort of grand coalition supposedly for the good of Italy but even that would only be a temporary measure with a view to even more elections Berlusconi could well hold a key to unlocking the confusion the fact that the European Union might look to him as their best guarantor of stability says much about the state of politics lawrence li al jazeera rome
