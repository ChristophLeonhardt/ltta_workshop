everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tunes in at night kinda for the</font>

46
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,799
speeches but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best part really is the</font>

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,750
roll call yeah that's the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting</font>

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,490
part I wish people would tune in for

49
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,380
that because that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually where</font>

50
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,330
democracy takes place right like that's

51
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,799
where you can like feel it that's where

52
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,570
you can see it that's where it's like

53
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,820
the electricity is just there though

54
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,799
it's like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say like oh where are</font>

55
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">we where with our democracy but that's</font>

56
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,070
where it feels most alive i mean it's

57
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,200
it's on it's the best part by far the

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,329
campaign unfortunately most people don't

59
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,829
even know what happens yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

60
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,510
that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really great point I</font>

61
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,390
mean I have followed politics for a long

62
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,720
time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and watching</font>

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,030
all of these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of this time</font>

64
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,640
spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work so hard for all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,600
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

66
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,340
to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in you're basically</font>

67
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,560
working toward that moment all

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,330
throughout the primary season right and

69
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,190
now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new season a new chapter</font>

70
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">in app but to close out that kind of</font>

71
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> chapter we did have like the Bernie</font>

72
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,990
versus Hillary camp all throughout this

73
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,000
primary season and there was a walk out

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,860
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bernie delegates at one point can you</font>

75
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,390
talk a little bit about like what was

76
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,080
going on there sure so one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

77
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,360
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know Bernie Sanders</font>

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,430
supporters<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt all year is the fact</font>

79
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,620
that we haven't been heard necessarily

80
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,110
as far as what what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

81
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,910
accomplish with this political

82
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,620
revolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're kind of getting all</font>

83
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,570
the issues adopted into the Democratic

84
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,340
National you know the national platform

85
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,350
the Democrats we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this most</font>

86
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">progressive platform in history you've</font>

87
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,140
heard Bernie say that I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

88
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,080
but we'd like though they think that we

89
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,820
can go farther with it and so we wanted

90
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,190
to send some kind of message<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

91
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,290
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be heard and these are the</font>

92
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,390
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we feel like we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font>

93
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and have adopted for unity yeah</font>

94
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,500
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unity is the theme of this</font>

95
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,410
convention and so we decided to

96
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,940
coordinate beforehand to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> walkout at</font>

97
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,710
the end of the roll call and we went a

98
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,380
couple hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> feet across from the</font>

99
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,940
convention doors into the media tent and

100
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,550
we occupied the media tent for about 90

101
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,210
minutes and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was Bernie delegates from</font>

102
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,090
across all 57 states and territories

103
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">united and talking about the same things</font>

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,330
we've been talking about all year right

105
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,380
there in the heart of media to

106
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,940
convention we felt that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

107
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,310
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell our story and tell</font>

108
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,550
the DNC and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hillary campaign what we</font>

109
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">still feel like we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

110
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,880
feel like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> invested in to come on</font>

111
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">board for unity yeah I mean it was like</font>

112
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,020
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just right over here like 50 feet</font>

113
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,390
away right it was pretty intense moments

114
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,620
for a little while and a lot of people

115
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,000
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in they lock down the building</font>

116
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,120
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit and I mean I guess how</font>

117
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,769
did that feel being outside of it did

118
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what was going on I</font>

119
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,730
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> had no idea what was happening</font>

120
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,730
and you know I noticed everyone walking

121
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,800
out of the convention I'm like okay I

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,270
get what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> now yeah they're</font>

123
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna do a walk outs I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know where</font>

124
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,810
they were going or what they were doing

125
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,370
where they were like ending up or

126
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,490
anything like that but it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

127
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,590
strange yeah but i didn't i didn't

128
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">expect anything else really I did expect</font>

129
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,930
something

130
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,000
happen yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,259
this effort it's hard to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

132
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,630
end it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like okay cool right well</font>

133
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,220
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this notion that</font>

134
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,560
conventions are these kind of

135
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,630
celebratory events where people comes in

136
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,970
and essentially the candidate is already

137
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,889
chosen and everyone neatly comes in and

138
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,570
it just becomes like a giant one week

139
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,910
pep rally for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I handed it but that's not</font>

140
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,320
really that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't always been the case</font>

141
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,030
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the case in recent history</font>

142
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,160
but the reason these conventions take

143
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,720
place I mean they used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take place is</font>

144
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,130
because delegates used to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from all</font>

145
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,900
over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was an actual debate in</font>

146
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,090
an actual discussion and there are

147
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,070
instances in American history and going

148
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,199
back all the way you know into Greek

149
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,270
history x where these conventions are

150
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,710
brought together to decide who the

151
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,210
leader is going to be but we have added

152
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this new notion that it's like</font>

153
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,120
everything should be sewn up nice and

154
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,680
tight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's any controversy</font>

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,090
there's something wrong that's the

156
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,039
original purpose of the convention I

157
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,289
guess you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this like lively</font>

158
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:38,940
discourse and debate and people should

159
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,990
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they want to be heard and</font>

160
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,389
after that everyone comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a unified</font>

161
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,610
party with a unified nominee but there

162
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,259
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be healthy discussion in order to</font>

163
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,490
get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could I add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to yeah</font>

164
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,310
absolutely so I totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's totally</font>

165
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,159
true um you know why people were like

166
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,470
Sanders supporters give it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> California</font>

167
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,680
math yeah and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you know it's</font>

168
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">time to you know stop fighting but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

169
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,639
of us especially with Bernie Sanders

170
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,810
supporters being new to the process he's

171
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,580
pulled tremendous amounts of people into

172
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,659
the political process for the first time

173
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,729
we're all thinking it's that kind of

174
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:10,050
democratic national convention we're all

175
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,750
reading about stories about how FDR

176
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Franklin Delano Delano Roosevelt came</font>

177
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">into his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> convention behind on delegates</font>

178
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,639
and was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use Paul ticking and</font>

179
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,070
coalition building and conversation

180
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,740
negotiation on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor to change the</font>

181
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,419
outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that convention right it so</font>

182
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,580
we're looking at 1968 convention where

183
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,449
you have the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the floor and</font>

184
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,159
they're calling up and and it was you

185
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,229
know chaos but it was it was democracy

186
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,789
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what democracy looks like it's</font>

187
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,070
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in here if I think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

188
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,900
of Bernie Sanders supporters felt kind

189
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,699
of like why are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already calling</font>

190
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,500
Hillary<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nominee when we haven't had</font>

191
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,180
that vote it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> till Tuesday sat till</font>

192
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,800
tomorrow when<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

193
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">chance to make our emotions into our</font>

194
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,340
floor you know they have that discourse

195
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,349
and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about ideas and try to maybe</font>

196
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:51,090
move some of these super delegates using

197
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,590
polling numbers and other objective data

198
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,050
to try to persuade them but as you said

199
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,450
it's really kind of already decided by

200
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,620
that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of coming in</font>

201
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,700
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

202
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,440
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ceremony I would have liked</font>

203
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a little more discussion in</font>

204
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,250
Cleveland a week<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago frankly yes I know</font>

205
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Republican league</font>

206
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,430
leaders who are not comfortable with

207
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,230
Trump as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> candidate and I was</font>

208
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,940
disappointed that I didn't see more of

209
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of push back in at that</font>

210
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">convention like you saw from from the</font>

211
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,570
Bernie supporters at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this dimension I</font>

212
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,780
think I think that's good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a healthy</font>

213
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,370
democracy to happen there should be

214
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,530
multiple voices yeah i mean that's as

215
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,450
you said that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the conventions are</font>

216
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,860
supposed to be about it's only been in

217
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,960
recent years that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've showed up and</font>

218
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is likely because from an optics</font>

219
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,010
perspective it's better to show up have

220
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,510
everything decided have everybody on the

221
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,040
same page and then walk forward together

222
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,230
right and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still walk forward</font>

223
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,530
together I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like even if you weren't</font>

224
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,900
walking in together if that makes sense

225
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you walk out together even if</font>

226
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,290
you didn't walk in together I think it's

227
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,570
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling that the that the Bernie</font>

228
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,520
delegates waited until after the roll

229
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,760
call vote and then walk and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't I</font>

230
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,160
think they registered their protest and

231
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,230
they were and they heard but it wasn't a

232
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,120
true disruption I mean they didn't come

233
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,100
in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of demolishor destroy the</font>

234
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,870
convention itself so yeah the way they

235
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,990
chose to protest I thought was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

236
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,730
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> and respectful and that was a</font>

237
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">big part of the conversation we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had set</font>

238
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,040
up you know apps and as you know social

239
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,140
media connection tools to talk across

240
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,510
those 57 states and territories with

241
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,130
whips in each state representing and

242
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,720
taking messages back to their people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

243
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,580
keeping it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the down low until we were</font>

244
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,020
just ready to go with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a</font>

245
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,400
key part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion we knew that</font>

246
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mothers of the movement we're going</font>

247
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,520
to be coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out fairly shortly after</font>

248
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,440
the roll call we<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely wanted to</font>

249
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,840
show our support for them black lives

250
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter movement is a huge part of what</font>

251
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,409
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about in the People's</font>

252
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,360
Revolution so we wanted to be there to

253
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,919
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so that was part of our</font>

254
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">timing and we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people on the inside</font>

255
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,060
texting us and messaging us to keep us

256
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,470
aware of when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was happening and</font>

257
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,510
that was our big push to exit and end

258
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,930
the end the occupation of the media tent

259
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,190
is because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to get in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

260
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,440
those mothers of the movement yeah yeah

261
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,470
so uh you mentioned last<font color="#E5E5E5"> week you know</font>

262
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,870
as Republicans for Hillary Clinton like

263
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,970
you have a a unique kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of experience</font>

264
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,010
for both of those weeks can you talk a

265
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,260
little bit about how you ended up here

266
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNC sure yeah sure</font>

267
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,730
the fact of the matter is my background

268
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,990
and where I come from and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I believe</font>

269
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,060
in is very much a free market open trade

270
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">globalization type look I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

271
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,880
the United States has a responsibility

272
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,649
and actually it's good for the u.s. to

273
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,110
kind of be a leader and include itself

274
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,490
in conversations that are happening at a

275
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,899
global scale I think the moment we

276
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,050
stepped down and stop doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that China</font>

277
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,420
or Russia or another power will step in

278
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,339
and take that leadership role so for

279
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,260
various national security and economic

280
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons I firmly believe that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

281
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engaged and continue to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lead a be a</font>

282
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">global leader here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately the</font>

283
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,180
torch bearer for the for the Republicans

284
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,529
now is somebody who is complete

285
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,980
isolationist very much he is I mean just

286
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,470
speaking on isolation and economic

287
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,570
issues and national<font color="#CCCCCC"> security issues I</font>

288
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,240
think what he espouses is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

289
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,660
dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to mention the zena phobic</font>

290
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,230
kind of racist intolerant message that

291
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,790
he's putting forward so all around<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

292
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,000
somebody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have no idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

293
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,860
Republicans or people who call

294
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,399
themselves Republicans based on look I I

295
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">came here from Nicaragua I came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I we</font>

296
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,390
fled a communist revolution to come here

297
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,270
and in those days the Republicans very

298
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,899
much took a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strong anti-communist</font>

299
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,820
Pro opportunity position where they said

300
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,980
look anyone can come here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and work hard</font>

301
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,060
and make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's partners and I'm</font>

302
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,310
sitting here very good a business and so

303
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,690
I don't I do not recognize what's

304
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,160
happening right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now as far as that</font>

305
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,810
current candidate and so on the other

306
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,060
hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hillary Clinton has shown in her</font>

307
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,010
time at the Senate in her time as

308
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,040
Secretary of State a willingness that

309
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,050
few others have shown<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of reach</font>

310
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,820
across the aisle on particularly

311
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,260
important issues because the fact of the

312
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter is we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two-party system a one</font>

313
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,220
party's not going to get it done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

314
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,620
we've seen what what kind of that that

315
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,380
lockdown can do through Bush and Obama

316
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">administrations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> neither administration</font>

317
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,769
can get the things they<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to get done</font>

318
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:18,920
done yeah she she authored bills that

319
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,390
were bipartisan she reached across the

320
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">aisles on specific issues that were good</font>

321
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,520
be there are an infrastructure be there

322
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,780
on trade issues be

323
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,060
there are national security issues be

324
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,920
there on taxation issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

325
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,720
actually there's more we can get a lot

326
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
more accomplished by working together

327
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,680
but I just don't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from the</font>

328
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,410
current Republican nominee Donald Trump

329
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,510
right so you kind of coming out here to

330
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,920
say like look if there are the

331
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,780
Republicans we can figure this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

332
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,600
together but yeah I think I think part

333
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,960
of the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that that voice that I</font>

334
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,630
just espoused just isn't out there and

335
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,770
so I think from from trump pushing an

336
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,620
isolationist point of view Bernie

337
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,200
pushing a more or less kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you</font>

338
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,460
know let's let's get our house in order

339
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,350
before we do to free trade and free

340
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,390
trade is bad kind of position my worry

341
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,860
is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other position isn't isn't</font>

342
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,470
being spoken at all and the Republicans

343
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,340
aren't doing and that's been our

344
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,470
responsibility historically to do it so

345
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,290
I I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I broke with the</font>

346
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,210
Republicans I say I definitely broke

347
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,620
with a Republican leadership and I

348
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,940
definitely broke with the de facto

349
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,860
leader of the party but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wouldn't</font>

350
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,690
imagine the amount of phone calls and

351
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,460
encouragement I've gotten from true kind

352
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,360
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> free-market individual liberty</font>

353
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,080
conservatives that have called me and

354
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,660
said you know i'm there i wanna i want

355
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,860
to do what you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i think trump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

356
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,320
an existential threat to the existing

357
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,490
united state<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in you could almost</font>

358
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,350
call it classical republicanism at this

359
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,300
point right in this being<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

360
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,490
republicanism almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think so I mean I</font>

361
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,480
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is i mean i think</font>

362
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,950
what you're seeing with the Trump

363
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,450
influence is more of the xenophobic

364
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,680
right-wing extremism that you're seeing

365
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,080
in Europe yeah a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that kind of the</font>

366
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,090
immigrants out we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should push away from</font>

367
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade issues let's not work with other</font>

368
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,490
countries this kind of hyper hyper

369
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,410
isolationist kind of racist undertone

370
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,750
it's it's more of an import I mean

371
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,630
neither party historically has done that

372
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just so blatantly and so no I think I</font>

373
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,460
think there have been voices I think

374
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,630
there have been voices that heretofore

375
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,720
haven't had haven't felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had a</font>

376
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,370
voice I think you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

377
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,650
David Duke former KKK member now running

378
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,360
for Senate saying that Donald Trump

379
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,970
inspired him to do this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think</font>

380
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,970
these voices that that didn't really

381
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">find a place in either party now find a</font>

382
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,529
place in a party led by Donald Trump

383
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's it's a case of</font>

384
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,920
unfortunately these negative voices

385
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,019
almost acting like a parasite coming

386
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the Republican Party of eating it</font>

387
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,249
from the inside out and yeah i think if

388
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:53,040
if Trump wins<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's the death of</font>

389
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,689
the Republican Party with ya know it

390
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,610
when one thing that I was telling people

391
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,670
they talked to at the media occupation

392
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,069
was you know we feel like you know we

393
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:03,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely don't want Trump we don't</font>

394
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,680
want Trump and like Bernie we're going

395
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,730
to everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can to make sure that</font>

396
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,410
Trump is not the nominee but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

397
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to also vote for we don't want</font>

398
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:11,370
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> strictly to vote against right</font>

399
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,329
and so as you say neo republicanism you

400
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:16,350
know a lot of people think of

401
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,870
neoliberalism as being you know being a

402
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,309
liberal or being a progressive but and

403
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,920
then some but a lot of us feel like the

404
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,509
neoliberal policies of the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clinton</font>

405
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,160
administration and a lot of the free

406
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,980
trade and deals proposed by the the

407
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,509
upcoming potential Clinton

408
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,209
administration are really not what what

409
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,740
we're about and what's good for the

410
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,660
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> class and middle class Americans</font>

411
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,160
and that's contributing to the rigged

412
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,839
economy in the diminishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle class</font>

413
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,240
America so we feel like as much as we

414
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
definitely be wary of and advocating

415
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
against voting people voting for Donald

416
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,339
Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> we feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be talking</font>

417
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">about issues that Bernie Sanders</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

418
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,329
talking about and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the</font>

419
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:54,300
key to unity I think is if the the DNC

420
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,309
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Hillary campaign are able to</font>

421
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,939
start showing some meaningful shifts in

422
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:02,309
that direction and staying there and not

423
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:04,139
tacking right choice in general I think

424
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,279
she's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a lot more luck</font>

425
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,959
winning over this 13 million Bernie

426
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,600
Sanders supporters oh no<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok yeah I mean</font>

427
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,279
how do you feel like being a Hillary

428
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,170
delegate do you guys feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you are</font>

429
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,290
the big majority or does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel kind of</font>

430
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,800
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hall like it's two groups you</font>

431
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,740
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you guys know connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

432
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,120
personally feel connected i think unity

433
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,500
is the key to this whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing like</font>

434
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">stronger together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

435
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,679
whole convention like that's the motto

436
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,209
of this convention is stronger together

437
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:33,029
but you can tell that when you're in the

438
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:35,089
hall there is some sort of divide there

439
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,860
but it does depend also what states here

440
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,870
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at sure nevada had a</font>

441
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,329
really turbulent election season like

442
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:48,029
our primary was very just we won we won

443
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:50,220
that we won the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the caucus on februari</font>

444
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,110
20th but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to the county</font>

445
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,580
convention the state convention that

446
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,400
finally here and it's just been a lot to

447
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,870
take in like there's been a lot of

448
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,340
disputes between the Bernie people in

449
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,070
the Hillary people so for us it's a

450
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,800
little different because we're a little

451
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
bit more turbulent than the other states

452
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,960
i would say yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean every state</font>

453
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,250
does it a little different which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

454
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">brings us nicely into what the heck does</font>

455
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,220
a delegate even do like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know here like</font>

456
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,610
we're awesome hats yeah like<font color="#CCCCCC"> buns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

457
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,010

458
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,400
really great feelings<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the</font>

459
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,290
delegates are doing yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we were</font>

460
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,850
saying earlier in the hall during roll

461
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,710
call everybody's excited and shouting

462
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,650
and you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people who are</font>

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,800
delegate and and what what is your job

470
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,850
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I've been a lifelong</font>

471
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,710
Democrat since I was 18 it soon as I got

472
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,780
the army I started campaigning and

473
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,360
voluntary and I but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always done every</font>

474
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,650
four years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never kind of</font>

475
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,460
questioned them behind the scenes

476
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,199
process of how those votes that happen

477
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,240
in that primary get turned into actual

478
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,859
representation here at the convention

479
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,010
never never<font color="#CCCCCC"> lie just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had pushed it so</font>

480
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I became involved was a</font>

481
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,720
grassroots organizer back home saw my

482
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,490
passion during the campaign season the

483
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,619
volunteering the activism that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

484
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,780
showing and my ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate</font>

485
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,579
Bernie's message in our local community

486
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,170
and she said why don't you run to be a

487
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,000
delegate and like well what were you

488
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,530
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and just really quickly</font>

489
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,540
the way an Oregon it works is shortly

490
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,340
after the primary there's a district a

491
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,710
congressional district convention where

492
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,120
people have to register<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend and</font>

493
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,950
have registered to a run as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a state</font>

494
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,720
delegate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a national Delia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or just to</font>

495
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,190
show up as a voter to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

496
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,750
process and and have that voice of who

497
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,490
you do send to the convention so I went

498
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the district convention congressional</font>

499
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,400
district<font color="#E5E5E5"> five back in Oregon from</font>

500
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,280
Portland Oregon and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look fortunately</font>

501
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,100
the Bernie supporters voted for me and

502
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,810
three others to represent them at the at

503
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,850
the Democratic convention after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

504
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,200
there's a state convention where state

505
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,370
delegates came together who are also

506
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,809
voted on it as prevention and we

507
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,379
nominated our delegation chair and some

508
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,059
at-large delegates and alternate so in

509
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,110
case someone got sick or something

510
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,490
they'd be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at representation on the</font>

511
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">floor and so that all happened in June</font>

512
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,919
and then in July we got together met and

513
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,519
strategize about how we were gonna do

514
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,590
all these voters are these delegates at

515
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,509
the convention but that's because we

516
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:26,799
were thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was 40 years ago and</font>

517
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,389
yeah well how did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> become a delicate</font>

518
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:32,299
you're pretty young delegate I am yeah I

519
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">just turned 18 in March so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font>

521
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:39,139
everything so I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> honored to be</font>

522
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:42,110
here so i joined<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Hillary Clinton</font>

523
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,879
campaign a week after she announced in

524
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:46,940
april of last year just super enthused

525
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,440
about her and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything she stands for</font>

526
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,929
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got involved over twitter i</font>

527
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,179
contacted one of the organizers and then

528
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just got involved and did phone calls</font>

529
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,990
and canvassing became a fellow so it was

530
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,899
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a job but not a job you</font>

531
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:01,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">know um so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just been working really</font>

532
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:03,470
hard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nevada and now we're finally</font>

533
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,480
here same thing as Oregon it sounds like

534
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,820
with the different levels of the

535
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,899
conventions and everything like that

536
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,999
where we were elected and then we each

537
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,379
had to give like a speech at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

538
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:14,629
convention to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> elected here like over</font>

539
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,190
a hundred people ran in my specific

540
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,990
congressional<font color="#E5E5E5"> district so I'm very lucky</font>

541
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,019
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here yeah but um so yeah pretty</font>

542
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:22,490
much the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's so funny</font>

543
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">cuz it's kind of like an election</font>

544
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,480
underneath the election videos about

545
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah that people never really talked</font>

546
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:30,830
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much and have specific jobs</font>

547
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,499
then once you become a delegate well um

548
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,659
so within each delegation<font color="#CCCCCC"> there what</font>

549
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,249
they call whips and it's not exactly

550
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:38,629
like being in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know house of</font>

551
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:40,730
Congress it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone that's</font>

552
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,019
going to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure people are on the bus</font>

553
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,369
to get to the convention<font color="#E5E5E5"> on time people</font>

554
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:44,509
are gonna be on the floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> building these</font>

555
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:47,179
seats who are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote the way that</font>

556
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:48,950
the campaign needs them to we're

557
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">expecting their the phone's going to</font>

558
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:51,619
ring at that statewide you know in the

559
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:53,419
seating<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're gonna okay we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

560
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,070
campaign wants us to vote yay on this or

561
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,509
nay on that and we had papers and stuff

562
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:59,659
but again this isn't 1968 but so

563
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:00,769
basically the whip is basically just

564
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,389
helping coordinate everybody and there

565
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:04,340
were two of us were voted Morgan we

566
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,289
decided for gender equity to have a male

567
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,669
whip and a female web sign the male whip

568
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:10,100
for Oregon and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> serac is the</font>

569
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,869
female what we're most veterans that's

570
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:13,940
pretty cool she's a Marine I'm re oh and

571
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,590
then the campaign

572
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,450
appointed some supplemental whoops it's

573
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just the kind of you know some</font>

574
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,720
point people that the campaign and our

575
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,950
state party can work with to make sure

576
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,330
that everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is getting the messaging</font>

577
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,650
because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of communication</font>

578
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,510
happening so much communication I think

579
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,799
the key about this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

580
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,299
communication everyone knows what's

581
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:30,980
going on when it's happening like the

582
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,929
timing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all you need to know where</font>

583
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,190
you're going to be at what time and

584
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah so now</font>

585
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,200
once you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're a delegate</font>

586
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,659
here at the conventions it do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

587
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,610
work together is it like is that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

588
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,020
the unity system where now you are

589
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,150
starting to exchange information and you

590
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,679
know I mean being here you're obviously

591
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:50,299
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet delegates</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you may not</font>

592
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,490
have met otherwise but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

593
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,740
start interacting and like I guess speak

594
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,690
to kind of the unity system now that and

595
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,520
especially now Republicans for Hillary

596
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">are here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's everybody is</font>

597
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,270
in one place yeah so does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

598
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,940
bring you all together naturally well

599
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,360
you know in Oregon we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very fortunate</font>

600
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,700
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know Oregon you know</font>

601
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oregon Democratic platform is very</font>

602
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,330
similar to the burning platform we're

603
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,120
very progress has been organized and so

604
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,340
there is probably more that unites us

605
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,110
than divides us as far as yeah you know

606
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,049
being Democrats in Oregon you know

607
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,640
there's the moderate wing of the

608
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,809
Democratic Party in those progressive

609
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:29,210
wing but feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oregon we are very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

610
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,010
similar now we have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font>

611
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,620
about you know who should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be leading the</font>

612
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,000
charge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the judgment and</font>

613
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,220
qualification and all that but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as</font>

614
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,250
actual delegates and meaning my you know

615
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,000
Hillary delegate you know I've met some

616
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,230
great people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I didn't know before</font>

617
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,200
this there's another guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> about my age</font>

618
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,909
that's a you know a Native American as

619
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,500
well and we've talked about Native

620
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,940
American issues because I'm a part

621
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,950
Native American and it's it's been it's

622
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,690
been really great and to make those

623
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,919
connections because regardless of what

624
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,850
happens in November in 2016 if from a

625
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,830
Bernie Sanders perspective if we're

626
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,230
going to really achieve a bottom up

627
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,909
revolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> People's Revolution in and</font>

628
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,640
really over give a press and make over

629
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,470
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democratic Party it's going to</font>

630
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together and we can't be</font>

631
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,399
regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vote November</font>

632
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,390
we're going to have to work together in

633
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,010
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationships so we're forging</font>

634
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,049
here at the convention and back home at

635
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,549
our state convention or say party that's

636
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,799
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the key to making it happen</font>

637
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,840
right and going off at it's more than

638
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,640
just the presidential election it's all

639
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,470
the local x

640
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,270
that we have and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

641
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,400
work together to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrats up</font>

642
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,750
and down the ticket so that's another

643
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,549
part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing and I think meeting</font>

644
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:37,780
all the other Bernie delegates and all

645
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,789
of that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really fun to me all</font>

646
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:41,470
the new people and everything but uh

647
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,840
like I said Nevada's really strange date

648
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,280
I feel in this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> process I don't</font>

649
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,309
know I feel like we had a more rough

650
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,230
lead up to this national convention but

651
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,240
overall I think it's Wednesday today and

652
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,549
tomorrow's the big day I feel like maybe

653
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:56,380
by tomorrow night we'll have more unity

654
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,940
than we do today like after last night

655
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,799
but you know it takes time yeah it does

656
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,510
and what and 11 other thing I would just

657
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,909
say is the the I talked earlier about

658
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:06,340
the media occupation really again that's

659
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,980
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the progressive wing of the</font>

660
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,539
Democratic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Party wanting to be heard</font>

661
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,190
wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel like they're being</font>

662
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,169
included and that they're the 13 million

663
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,809
votes actually you know come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really</font>

664
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:18,280
make a meaningful impact on the party

665
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,860
now a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are not you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know super</font>

666
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy with the vice presidential nominee</font>

667
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,710
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was too big too close to</font>

668
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,809
Wall Street<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know corporate</font>

669
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Democrat but we feel like if if those</font>

670
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,870
kind of if our our<font color="#CCCCCC"> power issues in our</font>

671
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,669
platform really truly do become the

672
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:35,650
Democratic platform and that the

673
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">platform that we've drafted here in</font>

674
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,510
Orlando goes forward and and is adopted

675
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,299
we can ban the TPP and put an end<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

676
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">super-delegates like the unity</font>

677
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Commission is now proposing to do yeah</font>

678
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,520
and hopefully eliminate super PACs those

679
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,169
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would make</font>

680
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:52,630
it really easy at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local level to</font>

681
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,520
come together because if at the top this

682
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,380
is a bottom up revolution but structural

683
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,820
things like that come also<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from the</font>

684
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,840
top down so I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

685
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">really easy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work together but I for</font>

686
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,690
all you out there in the local community

687
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">or have all these new Bernie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kratz</font>

688
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,280
coming in please<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to them here</font>

689
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,929
then respect them and work with them

690
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,880
because we are passionate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will</font>

691
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,710
bend<font color="#CCCCCC"> over backwards we feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we need</font>

692
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be invited to the table and respected</font>

693
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,820
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a prime example of a</font>

694
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,280
party working within its organization

695
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,179
and should help get some voices

696
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:23,530
listening different things and I think

697
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,730
I'm sitting here as an example of what

698
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,460
happens when a strong voice is is feels

699
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">like they have absolutely no no ears</font>

700
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,330
right yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we feel we're not being</font>

701
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,210
hurt or we feel that the leadership<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

702
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,620
the party or the candidate of the party

703
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,530
has so abandoned our primary points of

704
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,899
view that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see no other solution I</font>

705
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:41,330
mean to the

706
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is traditionally the</font>

707
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,300
opposing party<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think has more in</font>

708
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,070
common than the leadership so I think

709
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very important to continue to</font>

710
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,520
listen to the voices within so they can

711
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,290
so that you continue to feel as one

712
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,810
party you will have internal debates

713
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,340
about them the way the party should

714
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,320
progress it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen all at</font>

715
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,510
once and so when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hope for</font>

716
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,400
you know in four years<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll come back</font>

717
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,930
people will continue to listen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and</font>

718
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,990
we can move gradually in that direction

719
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,310
it's a very different feeling than

720
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,080
what's happening in the Republicans with

721
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,660
the nerve yeah yeah so when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

722
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,250
this though it like as a Hillary

723
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,020
delegate do you feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are</font>

724
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,730
starting to embrace all of these other

725
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,860
viewpoints as well or do you like you

726
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,750
feel that unity kind of coming in i do

727
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,330
i'm pretty confident I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000%</font>

728
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">comment ever going to unite by the by</font>

729
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,840
November yeah let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just see you nite by</font>

730
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,230
November I think that Hillary delegates

731
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,330
went through the same like hurt the

732
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,820
heartache the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> emotional trials that</font>

733
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,780
the burning people are going through

734
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,210
right now that she did in 2008 with

735
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,500
Barack Obama with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> super-delegates</font>

736
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from Obama over her and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

737
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,880
that so it's similar and a lot of our

738
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,830
delegates not me I was a little young so

739
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,110
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that back then but feel</font>

740
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">like they are connected in that sort of</font>

741
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,880
way so we have like that same point of

742
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,230
view that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about and all that</font>

743
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,640
but I'm really confident that we're

744
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,860
gonna unite yeah yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

745
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,420
again that is the point of the

746
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">convention and again it's nice to have</font>

747
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,410
everyone here being able to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

748
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,140
other all at the same time when it comes

749
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,860
to like stuff like there are all this

750
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,750
politics still happening you know the

751
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,880
email link that happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the last</font>

752
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,280
weekend and stepping down of Wasserman

753
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,950
Schultz and you know all of this do you

754
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,530
think that that well first I guess

755
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,290
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one from like kind of a</font>

756
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,510
party outsider like how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that how do</font>

757
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,310
you view that now that you're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

758
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,010
working with this group look at politics

759
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> democracy a mess is a messy process</font>

760
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,250
right it's a messy system and then

761
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,540
there's an old joke that says it all the

762
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,650
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be running</font>

763
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the country are either too busy cutting</font>

764
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,630
hair or driving cabs so and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

765
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,850
means is look we don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

766
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know would</font>

767
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,300
lead the people who you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> would lead</font>

768
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,350
the country are probably in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

769
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,090
neighborhood or in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> home or people</font>

770
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:53,929
you run across there

771
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,690
single day and so the choices we make

772
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,360
our further<font color="#CCCCCC"> are for the people who have</font>

773
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">chosen this this this career this line</font>

774
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,889
know as politics which is going into

775
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,139
politics and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to be</font>

776
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:07,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">messy it's going to be messy because no</font>

777
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,169
one's perfect I know I wouldn't want to

778
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,480
be under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of scrutiny that any</font>

779
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,499
politician is under on a regular basis

780
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,509
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all almost all so messy because</font>

781
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:20,210
you're running against opponents and you

782
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,830
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pastime of the politician when</font>

783
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,269
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not running is to throw dirt upon</font>

784
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:25,730
your opponent right and so yeah so and

785
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,559
so you're gonna see that and you're

786
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,210
gonna see lapses in judgment and lapse

787
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,309
in judgment that that we that we make on

788
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:33,259
a single day basis aren't investigated

789
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:34,850
by the FBI nuts right and don't

790
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,629
constitute potential security issues but

791
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:40,970
show me an honest politician you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

792
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,740
show me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a politician with no faults yeah</font>

793
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:49,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean nobody nobody is perfect nobody</font>

794
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,649
has a flaw at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a winning politician</font>

795
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:55,490
oh yeah what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you guys you guys</font>

796
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,549
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that has affected your</font>

797
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,590
experience as delegates here like is

798
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,029
that strengthen your position is it

799
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:03,529
weakened your position has it done the

800
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:06,169
opposite you know you know it's kind of

801
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:08,509
in a tough spot right now you know the

802
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,070
signals being sent that we're being

803
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,009
listened to I mean all year long we felt

804
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:13,970
like we were being you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> gasps</font>

805
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,830
flighted about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that we</font>

806
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,200
had no forces working against the

807
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,659
burning campaign from the DNC and that

808
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,369
is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were telling us</font>

809
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we were imagining it we're paranoid</font>

810
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:25,820
we're sore losers and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just making</font>

811
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,350
up excuses for why Bernie was

812
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,539
underperforming with these email links

813
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:31,249
coming out it's clear that that was the

814
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:32,899
case we feel like we have been validated

815
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:34,999
by the leaks sure artists I had to come

816
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:36,649
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to you know get that out you</font>

817
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:39,679
know yeah loser I've said sunlight is

818
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,009
the best disinfectant right so but now

819
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:44,990
we're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where okay Debbie</font>

820
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,460
wasserman-schultz has resigned yeah but

821
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,690
is that something that's merely going to

822
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,940
make this you know obviously the Sanders

823
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,470
supporters my fellow center supporters

824
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,929
were you know happy to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

825
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:57,889
you felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there was some</font>

826
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:59,929
accountability being had there yeah but

827
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,999
with unless there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> total revolution</font>

828
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:06,049
of the DNC leadership we then I feel

829
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,100
like we're not we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

830
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">same place because</font>

831
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,320
now the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are leading the part</font>

832
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNC now are the same people that</font>

833
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,410
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these leaks when they were</font>

834
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,850
happening and they're still in office

835
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,740
and did watch them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Schultz to them</font>

836
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,090
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a total revolution and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

837
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that would be one key thing to</font>

838
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,570
bring unity with us because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

839
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,460
show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are being respected like</font>

840
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,350
Ryan Lynette what do you think how do

841
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel about that I have a different</font>

842
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,180
point of view sure personally I really

843
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,820
like debbie Wasserman Schultz um a lot

844
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,410
of the Hillary people do obviously sure

845
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,940
and now she's working with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hillary</font>

846
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,510
campaign right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do think that this</font>

847
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,090
email new email scanned all this that's

848
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,650
coming out right now like right<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

849
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,240
the command started during the

850
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,460
convention all of this is sort of

851
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,250
aggravating the unity sort of but the

852
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,380
point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think in our mind Hilary</font>

853
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,450
people's minds she won more votes than

854
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,020
Bernie I'm join<font color="#CCCCCC"> as she won and the DNC</font>

855
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,930
could not like overturn that decision

856
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,330
you just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the votes she won more</font>

857
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,560
than a million more votes than he did

858
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,300
right and the platform is the most

859
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,800
progressive platform in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the history of</font>

860
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,580
our party so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's a good good</font>

861
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,830
year for us I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I think</font>

862
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,630
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great point is that as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

863
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,610
the DNC can email each other and say

864
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,040
here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we like right this decision</font>

865
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,520
was made by other people right at the

866
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,260
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day and yes super delegates</font>

867
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,580
can influence that decision but

868
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,440
mathematically speaking the voters made

869
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,480
a lot of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision if not almost all</font>

870
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it right but at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time moving</font>

871
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,310
past it and getting getting through that

872
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,070
together and working together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

873
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,100
is the goal yes I guess kind of really

874
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,380
briefly do you feel like I guess that's

875
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,510
possible just to kind of wrap it up you

876
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,460
know I think right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the eyes of the</font>

877
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,900
world are<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what are the 13 million</font>

878
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,400
Sanders supporters like myself is going

879
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,810
to do I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been asked that probably a</font>

880
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,830
million times here at this convention

881
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,570
and really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think people should</font>

882
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,310
put the onus on the Bernie Sanders

883
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,530
supporters Bernie did his part he

884
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,180
endorsed Hillary he got behind her he

885
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,530
pledged his delegates to her yesterday

886
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,140
so Bernie has done his part we're kind

887
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,640
of waiting and seeing to see what the

888
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,140
party and Hillary Clinton in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

889
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,790
campaign are going to do what are they

890
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,650
going to do to bring us in and you know

891
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">people say well if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe use them</font>

892
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,790
you say you believe in Bernie and you

893
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,530
know Bernie saying to support Hillary so

894
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,630
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do that but we believe in</font>

895
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,399
Bernie we believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he is saying that</font>

896
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,839
that we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying way he</font>

897
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,369
believes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be true the heli clamp is a</font>

898
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:23,929
better candidate than<font color="#E5E5E5"> chomp not</font>

899
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,029
everybody in the 13 million Bernie

900
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:28,009
voters they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> alter a value on that</font>

901
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:29,269
yeah so that's why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

902
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:30,320
meaningful things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

903
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,879
structural change within the DNC and

904
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:34,369
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show the progressives</font>

905
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:35,419
that we're being heard and that we're

906
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:36,919
being respected in the party<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you I</font>

907
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,839
think you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see you'll see that's going</font>

908
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,519
to be the outcome the onus is on on the

909
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,440
party in the campaign right I think it's

910
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,119
important to know that this week is

911
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,389
focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Democrats but after after</font>

912
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:48,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's said and done here and we</font>

913
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:49,789
moved on we have a general election to

914
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,159
look at ya<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold it also we have to come</font>

915
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,869
together not the party has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

916
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:55,219
healing come together but in the nation

917
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:56,719
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together and look at stuff</font>

918
00:31:56,719 --> 00:32:00,320
beyond the party and decide between the

919
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,210
the two candidates that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

920
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,249
have in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wigan which is better for</font>

921
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:06,019
the country overall yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

922
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:07,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">then beyond that you have to look at</font>

923
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,619
who's gonna who's going to govern and

924
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:12,349
the way we govern here is as as a unity

925
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,299
as a unity and together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and divided</font>

926
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,639
government so whoo-hoo best can work

927
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:18,349
with Congress and in Congress there's

928
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:19,789
going to be Republicans and Democrats

929
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:22,429
working together and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is not</font>

930
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:23,809
only does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Democrat Party have to</font>

931
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,429
come together but after that after the

932
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:27,559
elections hopefully Hillary wins and

933
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,089
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country comes together and we</font>

934
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:30,259
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start moving forward and get</font>

935
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:32,239
beyond kind of this bipartisan divisions

936
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:34,759
