and what about hate and what about combing you watch him on the interviews come he's a liar and a leaker you know I did you a great favor when I fired this guy Wow Donald Trump is still ranting and raving about James Comey and all the tea he spilled in his latest tell-all memoir it was just one of the topics that Trump returned to again and again to fire up his base last night in Michigan Maria Teresa Kumar and EJ Dionne are back with me and we're joined by Natasha Barrett Ron staff writer for The Atlantic all right well Donald Trump had a lot to say as a matter of fact about Jim Comey but also about Russia actually let's do cut for for my producers this is Donald Trump talking about the house intelligence committees report on collusion I want to thank by the way the House Intelligence Committee okay Russian collusion you know I guarantee you I'm tougher on Russia nobody ever thought the only collusion is the Democrats colluded with the Russians and the Democrats colluded with lots of other people take a look at the intelligence agencies ok well Jim Comey has his say this morning on Meet the Press and here he is giving his take on that very same House Intelligence Committee report I'd have serious doubts about his credibility the president United States yes whether he were under oath or not correct and sometimes people have serious credibility problems can tell the truth when they realize that the consequences of not telling the truth in an interview or in the grand jury would be dire but you'd have to go in with a healthy sense that he might lie to you this strikes me as a political document did the House Intelligence Committee at all survey a good investigative purpose doing all this in your observations not that I can see just totally got to politicize yeah and it wrecked the committee and it damaged relationships with the FISA Court the intelligence community's is just a wreck Natasha given the fact that Jim Comey is now free to speak what our White House insiders feeling about Donald Trump attacking him on the campaign trail in a way that Comey gets to respond to well it's not entirely surprising I mean we saw that freewheeling Fox and Friends interviewed that the president did last week and of course his aides were actually mortified by that that was an interview that many people around the president did not want him to do it's exactly out of character for the president to be attacking Jim Comey he's been doing it for well over a year now calling him a liar calling him a leaker but now that Jim Comey has this platform where he can go out he can push back against the president's claims against him it's going to be more difficult for the president to have any credibility when it comes to going up against Jim Comey because whereas people have questioned Jim Comey's judgment perhaps in the way that he handled you know the Clinton investigation and not disclosing the fact that Donald Trump's campaign was under investigation during the election they've never questioned his underlying integrity they've never accused him the only person that's really key Jim Comey of being a liar is Donald Trump and of course we don't really know what Trump is saying here I mean he had he has said that Jim Comey leaked classified memos but at the same time he said that those memos are fake and that Jim Comey is a liar so which one is it those memos classified or are they not true so this is something that the president is really going up against someone with a lot of credibility and his new lawyer Rudy Giuliani knows that Rudy Giuliani went into an interview with Muller or a meeting with Muller last week to try to gauge the extent to which the special counsels team feels like Jim Comey is more credible than the president and they're going to essentially base whether or not they allow the president to sit down with Muller on the basis of whether or not they think that the special counsels office places more weight in what Jim Comey says perhaps about obstruction or even collusion than what the president says and that's saying something yeah and too easy too I'm sure that Donald Trump lawyers that probably don't like the idea that he is talking so much about the case but he's also giving more and more detail that could wind up coming back to haunt him in front of Bob Melun front of molars grand jury here he is on the stump last night talking about the MS vessel mitts kiya the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump jr. in that famous Trump Tower basement meeting who's now come out and admitted that she is actually a Kremlin informant have you heard about the lawyer for a year a woman lawyer she was like oh I know nothing no no now all of a sudden she supposedly is involved with government you know why if she did that because Putin and the group said you know this Trump is killing us why don't you say that you're involved with government so that we can go and make their life in the United States even more chaotic I mean it easy that will help Donald Trump in terms of his base having a narrative to you know to tweet out and to go on go forward with I'm not sure how it's helpful to him materially no I think this whole business potentially hurts him a lot in the case he is doing what autocratic leaders do all the time which is to throw out junk that's not real information to try to so conspiracy theories in order to just confuse the whole story Alexander Hamilton a long time ago warned against leaders who simply ride the world win after sowing confusion but all of this can only hurt him in his case because if there are ever obstruction of justice charges against Donald Trump one of the most important parts of making the case for obstruction is the mind of the person what do they intend and the more Trump attacks Jim Comey in this way the more Trump is making the case that he didn't fire Jim Comey for incompetence or because he didn't like his hair color or whatever he fired him as he told Lester Holt because he was worried about the Russia investigation so this is creating a narrative for him with the minority of Americans who support him but it's not helping his case at all and I think that's why hat and his own aides are so uncomfortable with a lot of this yeah let's make a quick point about vessel meets kya sure in the in the rally last night Trump really implied that vessel meets kya the lawyer was taking orders from Vladimir Putin so that's not really going to help his case either yeah absolutely and at the same time Moran tracing we have now both Jim Comey and Donald Trump putting so much of the record on the record publicly that I wonder how you know much of his hair Muller might be tearing on at this point here is Jim Comey talking about Michael Flynn one of the other one of the sort of early things that he apparently did wrong the canary in the coal mine right of of not going easy on Flynn which is what he said that Donald Robb asked him to do here is Jim Comey he says can you lay off Mike Flynn why didn't you tell him that was inappropriate that's a great question I've asked myself that a bunch of times I think because I was so focused first shocked and so focused on trying to remember his exact words and standing there alone in the Oval Office that it didn't occur to me at the time it's harder to correct the president and second you got to remember the atmosphere he had just kicked out my boss who had tried to linger the Attorney General and still been booted out of the Oval Office and so you have to realize that if he if he didn't know he was doing something he shouldn't do why was he kicking out the leadership including my boss so I mean these are not new details it's in the book but there's a lot now on the public record from both Comey and Trump so I think that more you're absolutely right I think he's having a hard time because he wants to make sure that all these narratives don't go out that basically it is as a pure case as possible but what I do think that we witnessed with Trump talking about this whole idea that Comey is not telling the truth that it's basically all allegations is that we have to remember that he actually just speaks to closed-circuit TV so his audience is only listening to Facebook a platform and basically retweeting whatever there's an between whatever they're saying they'll wake up and listen to Fox News and then they get clips from the president so well we may be saying well this is actually going to sink him his base is only listening to each other we're into that cave and that and that is the dangers like how do we actually start penetrating them so that penetrating those conversations so that they actually are part of the American narrative of saying this is dangerous what we are seeing now is not something that is constitutional in many ways it's actually putting the danger though the White House itself yes you know then it's a million-dollar question Maria Teresa Kumar and EJ don't be back thank you Natasha Bear Tron and up next Trump supporters think he should get the Nobel Peace Prize really more on that after the break hey there I'm
