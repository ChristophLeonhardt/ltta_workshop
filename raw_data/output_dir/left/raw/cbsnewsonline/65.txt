00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,063
CALIFORNIA HAS JUST BECOME ONE 

1486
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:44,234

1500
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,391
BUT I REALLY ASKED -- IT'S ALL 

1501
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,061
ABOUT COMMON SENSE, RIGHT? 

1502
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,096

1504
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:16,566

WE'RE REALLY SMART. 

1507

I MAY MOVE THERE. 

1514
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,651
