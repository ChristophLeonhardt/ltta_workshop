there have been at least three terror convictions and court hearings going on in London over the last month or so and they all have a common theme they're going after the politicians so there have been a few interesting cases recently regarding terror plots that have been foiled in London I thought I'd go over three of them today all all surrounding London I might add and the first one being from the middle of June Isis seems to have gone old feminist with its first ever all-female Isis cell in London and a young member of the ISIS Spice Girls has been jailed for life for planning a knife attack in central London the independent reports his lame boov are 22 year old mother was handed a minimum turn of 16 years at the Old Bailey for plotting to cause panic injury and death in April last year her mother Mina dick 44 was jailed for six years and nine months with a further five years on extended licence for helping her typically keeping it in the family both women appeared in muslim dress to be sentenced by Judge Mark Dennis QC he said dick failed in her parental role to stop her daughter committing an atrocity that would have taken place one month after the westminster attack it's amazing that isn't it she failed in her parental role to stop her children from going out stabbing people my parents parental role was cooking my dinner and telling me off if I forgot to brush my teeth in the mornings it's amazing now that kids are expected to be these vulnerable little minds that might go out stabbing people if you if you don't don't tell them not to it's insanity but the story here is that these two women took over a terror plot that was originally being planned by RZA Lane Sisto who was a young girl who was stopped from going to Isis going to Syria to fight with Isis at the age of 16 this was her system at an Isis fighter online but then he was blown up in Raqqa and then missing enraged the girls even more but her younger sister was taken into custody in April 2017 when she tried to get into Syria so the plan for the two remaining women was to either target the British Museum or the houses of parliament this is a classic al Qaeda tactic and we know that because they published an article in May 2016 in al-qaeda's inspire magazine called Oh knife revolution head toward America do me a favor don't Google Tereza maze Snooper squad will be all over your internet history so don't do it the second story here is the BBC reports on this is that a British plumber you've probably seen this all over social media over the last day or so a British plumber has been convicted of planning another terror attack in Westminster and making bombs for the Taliban so the BBC report carried a v28 was arrested on 27th of April 2017 in Parliament Street where he was caught carrying three knives prosecutors said re from Edmonton in North London had planned a murderous attack on politicians and police in a police interview Ali said he wanted to deliver a message to British authorities but claimed the knives were for protection an Old Bailey jury convicted him of preparing an act of terrorism in the UK and two counts of possessing an explosive substance with intent he did not react as the verdicts were read out and all this combined with the recent story that one terrorist or at least attempted terrorist tried to bomb Downing Street and behead Theresa May wouldn't you think the politicians would have noticed a theme by now naima ramen tried to bomb Downing Street and kill Therese in May Khaled Ali was plotting a murderous attack on British politicians and police and rizz Lane bula was planning a knife attack at Westminster wouldn't you think the politicians would have noticed the theme you know I've long thought that if politicians was suddenly the focus of terror attacks instead of just the common man on the street that maybe maybe they would wake up but even that isn't doing the job London's descending into violent chaos and politicians are being directly threatened with Islamic terrorists with plot after plot being foiled and you would think the politicians would notice and yet to resume and the main party politicians refused to accept that there's even a problem London is descending into violent chaos terrorist plot after terrorist plot is being foiled and yet the politicians still don't seem to think there's a problem or at least they don't want to recognize the source of the problem and if these attacks if these foiled attacks still don't scare the politicians it leaves me wondering what happens the day when one of these terrorists actually slips through the net when the British authority figures are the British security services who are doing an amazing job right now don't catch the next terrorist and say this terrorists got into Westminster they blew something up and they killed a few politicians say that happens what the politicians then would they still be telling us to join hands and sing don't look back in anger if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
