McDonald's has announced that they'll be using a new filter for job applicants a snapchat filter now the chain started accepting applications in Australia last month and starting today in the US you will be able to submit a snap location to work at McDonald's it allows potential employees to make video submissions with a special filter that shows them wearing a McDonald's uniform I think we have a picture here so basically there's like a snap and then there's a picture where it basically puts them in the McDonald's buta form and then they talk about why they would be a great McDonald's employee the video audition can then be submitted to McDonald's snapchat account after that McDonald's will send back a link to the application and digital careers page now McDonald's said allowing application through snapchat will aid hiring efforts because many of its applicants are between the ages of 16 and 24 and they just want to be rid of kids at they won't be hip and cool so they're trying something new like what's up fellow kids it's your friends from Mickey D's yeah why don't you just join the snaps party with us we're gonna chat claps what's that this is stupid this is really really really stupid so stupid and condescending yeah how do we get them Millennials you know you get millennial in like snapchat how are we gonna get people to work I mean you know people desperately need money how are we gonna get applications you read about at some of these places they get a thousand plus applications for these jobs that's not a problem this is a stupid publicity stunt that also sort of smears Millennials as being so shallow that they would theoretically try to work in a place purely because they appeal to them over snapchat right and like it's a filter to show them in the uniform so if you look good in the uniform yeah do this for a job there's a beer affair a matter more than anything else jonno oh just like in here here's so much marketing it okay there's a year director of human resources for us said that would thought they thought that snap locations were a great way to allow us to meet job seekers where they are their phones which you're right is totally condescending because if you're seeking a job presumably you're going through like the normal routes of like either going and submitting an application at some sort of brick-and-mortar place are you doing through the internet or whatever it may be but to think that like oh like I don't have a job what am I going to do look the only way I can do this is through snapchat is absurd and Sobell it is belittling of Millennials yeah it's it I think the day it's fine I guess and I know that the person that came up with this campaign I don't blame that person that person does social media outreach blah blah blah from McDonald's and they had some out of touch older person say do something fun with the social media uh that's why they came up with this I'm sure but it's just it's not necessary I think it makes everybody look bad it doesn't matter but it's stupid social media is great to get a job LinkedIn that's the social media to get a job disagree or to piss off everyone you know I got this job so I am done I am a big proponent of only bad news I should have used snapchat I could have gotten on the lunders Johnny PI you are gonna pay for that yeah thanks Hank um are you fan yeah well yeah yeah let's move on by the way by the way the person you're weird the person who's going to be watching all these applications enjoy the dongs ha ha ha now you can't put a filter on a dog I don't think which you can put a dog in front of a camera trust me I get a box of fries cut a hole membership helps fund the Young Turks you know one great thing about that that means we're not accountable to anyone but you guys that's why we're strong together because we built the show around you come build it even bigger and better at TYT Network dot-com /join
