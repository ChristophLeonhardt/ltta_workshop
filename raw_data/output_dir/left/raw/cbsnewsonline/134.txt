1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:12,211
IT IS NOT OVER UNTIL IT IS OVER.

2
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,446
YOU GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF 

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,447
SEEING SUCCESS, BUT THE RESCUE 

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,981
IS NOT OVER UNTIL ALL OF THE 

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:17,283
PEOPLE ARE OUT OF THE CAVE, 

6
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:17,884
INCLUDING THE RESCUERS. 

7
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,719
THERE IS A WAY TO GO YET BUT IT 

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,154
IS REALLY GOOD NEWS THAT WE ARE 

9
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:21,955
SEEING PEOPLE COMING THROUGH 

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:22,755
THOSE DIFFICULT PASSAGES AND 

11
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:23,790
GETTING OUT OF THAT CAVE. 

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,791
I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE JUST TO 

13
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:30,897
BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL BECAUSE 

14
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,531
WE HAVE STILL GOT AN AWFUL LOT 

15
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,833
OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE GOT TO COME 

16
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,168
OUT OF THAT CAVE AND STILL YET 

17
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,669
TO SEE THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF 

18
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,470
THE TEAM TO COME THROUGH. 

19
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,972
>> YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF A 

20
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,206
RESCUE TEAM, AS I SAID EARLIER, 

21
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,307
THAT TOOK PLACE IN MEXICO CITY. 

22
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,442
HOW CLOSELY DOES THAT EVENT 

23
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,643
RESEMBLE WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW 

24
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:43,976
IN THAILAND? 

25
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,711
>> I MEAN, IN SOME WAYS IT IS 

26
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:46,045
VERY SIMILAR. 

27
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,247
WE RESCUED A GROUP OF SIX 

28
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:53,019
CAVERS FROM A SIMILAR SITUATION 

29
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,154
AND THE BIG DIFFERENCE WAS THAT 

30
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,287
IT WAS PART OF A CONTINGENCY 

31
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:56,689
PLAN ALTHOUGH IT WAS A RESCUE. 

32
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,024
WE WERE AWARE THAT THE CAVE HAD 

33
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:02,795
FLOODED AND WE HAD A DAY TO -- 

34
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,664
BEFORE WE WENT IN THERE AND WE 

35
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,065
KNEW THAT IT HAD FLOODED SO WE 

36
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:12,505
HAD THE CAMP SET UP IN CASE OF 

37
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:12,805
EMERGENCY. 

38
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,374
WE HAVE LINES LAID OUT TO ALLOW 

39
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,341
THE PEOPLE TO COME OUT THROUGH 

40
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:15,742
THE CAVE. 

41
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,710
WE ALSO HAD RICK AND ANOTHER 

42
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,917
DIVER ON STANDBY IN THE UK 

43
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,717
SHOULD THAT HAPPEN. 

44
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:25,752
SO THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT WE 

45
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,552
WERE SLIGHTLY MORE PREPARED 

46
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:27,654
BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT PARTICULAR 

47
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:27,987
CAVE FLOODED. 

48
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,389
>> THERE ARE SO MANY TEAMS FROM 

49
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,857
AROUND THE WORLD INVOLVED IN 

50
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:37,730
THIS. 

51
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,731
IN TERMS OF CAVE DIVING, WHERE 

52
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,567
DO YOU GO FIRST FOR EXPERTISE? 

53
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,102
>> WELL, THE OBVIOUS ANSWER FOR 

54
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:42,902
ME WAS RICK STANTON. 

55
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:48,041
WE KNEW THAT MAYBE 14 YEARS 

56
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:48,274
AGO. 

57
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,076
THE SITUATION HAS NOT REALLY 

58
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:50,577
CHANGED. 

59
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,944
THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD CAVE 

60
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,780
DIVERS ALL OVER THE WORLD. 

61
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,918
IT IS QUITE A CLOSE KNIT 

62
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:13,266
COMMUNITY. 

63
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,801
THERE IS A NEVER -- IS THERE A 

64
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,336
NUMBER THAT YOU CAN DIAL FOR A 

65
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:16,803
CAVE DIVER RESCUE? 

66
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,203
PROBABLY NOT. 

67
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,204
IT IS AN INTERESTING THOUGHT 

68
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,539
BUT IF YOU ARE CAVING AT THE 

69
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,940
LEVEL THAT WE WERE IN MEXICO, 

70
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,175
THERE WERE ENOUGH MEMBERS OF MY 

71
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:22,976
TEAM THAT UNDERSTOOD WHO TO 

72
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,210
CALL, AND WE ARRANGE THAT 

73
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,443
BEFORE 

74
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,045
>> WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT A 

75
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,080
PLAN, A DIVING PLAN, AND WHAT 

76
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,314
IS INVOLVED IN ONE OF THOSE? 

77
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,716
CAN YOU TAKE US THROUGH THAT? 

78
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:29,983
>> YEAH. 

79
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,351
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO 

80
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,352
KNOW THE CAVE IN DETAIL AND 

81
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,354
RICK WOULD HAVE DONE THAT WHEN 

82
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,622
HE FIRST MOVED TO FIND THE 

83
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,422
MEMBERS OF THE TEAM. 

84
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,657
BUT YOU WOULD NEED TO FIND HOW 

85
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,025
LONG YOU WERE SUBMERGED AND HOW 

86
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:49,135
COMPLEX THE CAVE SYSTEM IS. 

87
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,803
WE HAVE SEEN A LOT ON THE NEWS 

88
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,238
ABOUT HOW TIGHT IT WAS AND HOW 

89
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,473
DIFFICULT IT WAS BUT THAT WOULD 

90
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,674
HAVE BEEN A BIG PART OF THE 

91
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:54,874
PLAN. 

92
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,109
CAN YOU MOVE PEOPLE IN THERE? 

93
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,310
OF COURSE, THE OTHER THING THAT 

94
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,978
YOU HAVE GOT TO CONSIDER IS THE 

95
00:02:58,978 --> 00:02:59,579
SAFETY OF THE RESCUER. 

96
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,613
IF YOU ARE MOVING SOMEBODY 

97
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,414
THROUGH AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE 

98
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,683
THAT WHO IS NOT USED TO IT, 

99
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:13,192
THEN IT IS DANGEROUS FOR THE 

100
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,627
RESCUER AS IT IS FOR THE PERSON 

101
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,294
BEING RESCUED, PARTICULARLY IF 

102
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:16,262
THAT PERSON STARTS TO PANIC. 

103
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:16,663
YOU KNOW? 

104
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,064
LOSES THE LINE OR, EVEN WORSE, 

105
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:18,698
GETS EVERYBODY DISORIENTATED. 

106
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,699
ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE 

107
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:19,999
CONSIDERED. 

108
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,334
YOU NEED TO TRAIN FOR IT. 

109
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:27,573
WE TRAINED ON THE FAR SIDE OF 

110
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:27,773
THIS. 

111
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,108
I HAVE NOT TRAINED THE MEMBERS 

112
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,410
OF THE TEAM THAT I HAD BEFORE 

113
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,077
WE WENT TO MEXICO. 

114
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,078
THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRAPPED. 

115
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,379
BEFORE WE GUIDE THEM THROUGH, 

116
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,814
WE TRAINED THEM IN THE CAVE, IN 

117
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,848
WATER, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 

118
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:36,549
UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY REACTED 

119
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,417
BEFORE WE EVEN CONSIDERED 

120
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,384
BRINGING THEM OUT, USING 

121
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:38,617
DIVING. 

122
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:39,786
SELECT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 

123
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,253
VERY QUICKLY, WE ARE LOOKING AT 

124
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:44,691
SCENES -- AT THE SCENE OF THE 

125
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:48,528
RESCUERS WITH THOSE LIT 

126
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:53,933
HELMETS, WALKING AWAY AND AROUND

127
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,034
AT THE SITE ITSELF. 

128
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,269
A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE ALSO SAW 

129
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,108
A NUMBER OF AMBULANCES MOVING. 

130
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,543
AS FAR AS THE RESCUE IS, WHAT 

131
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,143
ARE THEY CARRYING? 

132
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,411
THEY HAVE GOT BAGS AND RED 

133
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,112
SWEATSHIRTS ON AS WELL? 

134
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,213
SOME OF THEM HAVE GOT THEIR 

135
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:07,814
TORCHES ON. 

136
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,048
JUST GOING BACK AGAIN TO WHAT 

137
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:22,261
YOU SAID, ABOUT TRAINING 

138
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,162
CHILDREN OR TRAINING PEOPLE 

139
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:23,762
BEFORE BRINGING THEM THROUGH 

140
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:24,697
AND COMPLETING THAT RESCUE, 

141
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,932
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU LOOK FOR? 

142
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,333
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU BEGIN A 

143
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,534
CRASH COURSE IN CAVE DIVING IN 

144
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,168
AN EMERGENCY SITUATION? 

145
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,169
>> Reporter: WELL, YOU HAVE TO 

146
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,572
PUT THEM  THE IDEA THAT THEY 

147
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,806
WILL BE MOVING THROUGH THE CAVE 

148
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,007
THROUGH AND YOU WILL FIND A 

149
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,310
SAFE PIECE OF WATER THAT IS NOT 

150
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:47,120
SUBMERGED, AND YOU PUT THEM 

151
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,454
UNDER THE WATER AND YOU SEE HOW 

152
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:48,955
THEY REACT. 

153
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,089
I MEAN, ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE 

154
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,591
PLANT IN MEXICO, WE HAD A DIVE 

155
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,525
LINE LAID ACROSS THE BASE OF 

156
00:04:52,525 --> 00:05:00,833
THE CAVE WHICH EFFECTIVELY WHAT 

157
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,068
WE DID FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE 

158
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,703
RESCUED IS WE PUT AN AWFUL LOT 

159
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,370
OF WEIGHT ON THEM. 

160
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,871
THEY CRAWLED. 

161
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,072
THEY DID NOT SWIM. 

162
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:06,739
THEY CRAWLED AND THEY FOLLOWED 

163
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,840
THE ROPE OUT OF THE CAVE. 

164
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,941
THEY MAY HAVE USED THE SAME 

165
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:09,174
METHOD. 

166
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:10,376
THE MOMENT THAT YOU MAKE THEM 

167
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,377
NEUTRALLY BUOYANT, AND THAT 

168
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,211
MEANS THAT THEY CAN FLOAT 

169
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,245
AROUND, THEY ARE MORE DIFFICULT 

170
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:13,646
TO MANAGE. 

171
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,914
YOU MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT ON THE 

172
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:15,581
FAR SIDE. 

173
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,482
YOU PUT THEM IN EQUIPMENT. 

174
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,517
YOU SEE HOW THEY PERFORM IN 

175
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,117
THAT WATER. 

176
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:24,824
THEY ARE NOT DIVING STRAIGHT 

177
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,257
INTO THE UNKNOWN. 

178
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:26,259
THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING 

179
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:26,459
ON. 

180
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,060
THEY CAN SEE THAT THEY COULD BE 

181
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,461
LOOKED AFTER. 

182
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,095
YOU REASSURE THEM, OBVIOUSLY, 

183
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:29,896
WITH PRESENCE, BECAUSE YOU 

184
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:43,276
CANNOT TALK TO PEOPLE. 

185
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,076
THEY GET TO KNOW THAT, 

186
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,544
ACTUALLY, IT IS OKAY AND THEN 

187
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:46,546
ONCE YOU HAVE GOT THEIR TRUST, 

188
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,780
YOU CAN START TO BRING THEM 

189
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,181
OUT. 

190
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,781
IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT. 

191
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,182
>>> YEAH. 

192
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,616
TALKING ABOUT TRUST, HOW DO YOU 

193
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,316
COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEBODY THAT 

194
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,452
IS INEXPERIENCED ONCE THAT DIVE 

195
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:52,852
IS UNDERWAY? 

196
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,586
>> WELL, YOU CAN'T. 

197
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,887
YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO BE 

198
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:55,154
PRESENT. 

199
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,389
YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE YOUR HAND 

200
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,790
ON THEIR HEART OR THEIR HAND 

201
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,025
AND THEY HAVE GOT TO FEEL YOU 

202
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,159
BECAUSE THEY CERTAINLY WILL NOT 

203
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,794
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU IN THE MUDDY 

204
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,027
WATER. 

205
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,095
THEY MUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE 

206
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,230
THERE AND THEY MUST TRUST YOU. 

207
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,465
TO DEVELOP THAT TRUST IS VERY 

208
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,566
DIFFICULT IN THAT SHORT PERIOD 

209
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:06,866
OF TIME. 

210
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,100
A SHORT DIVE IN PREPARATION 

211
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,970
BEFORE THEY ARE PUT INTO HARMS 

212
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,339
WAY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR 

213
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:13,639
US. 

214
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,740
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THEY 

215
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,509
HAVE FOLLOWED A SIMILAR SORT OF 

216
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,011
PATH. 

217
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:26,185
>> ONCE YOU HAVE GOT THE PERSON 

218
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,186
OUT OF THE CAVE, OBVIOUSLY 

219
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,387
THESE BOYS HAVE BEEN IN THERE 

220
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,221
FOR NEARLY A FORTNIGHT. 

221
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,223
THERE WILL BE LIGHT 

222
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,390
SENSITIVITY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN 

223
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,258
THEIR EYES. 

224
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,659
WHAT SORT OF MEDICAL PLANS ARE 

225
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,193
PUT IN PLACE? 

226
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,495
WHAT DID YOU DO IN MEXICO? 

227
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,529
>> WELL, THE HUMAN BODY ADAPTS 

228
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,462
VERY QUICKLY. 

229
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:41,000
ACTUALLY, THE BIGGEST SHOT THAT 

230
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,910
THE PEOPLE IN OUR PARTY HAD WAS 

231
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,911
THE LEVEL OF INTEREST. 

232
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,278
THE WORLD IS INTERESTED IN WHAT 

233
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:53,779
HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. 

234
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,014
IT WAS NOT A MEDICAL THING. 

235
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,215
IT WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL THING TO 

236
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,450
KNOW THAT THEY WERE, IN OUR 

237
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,917
CASE, ON THE NEWS EVERY DAY FOR 

238
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:03,322
10 DAYS IN THE WESTERN WORLD. 

239
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,257
THAT WAS A BIG THING. 

240
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,558
THEY WERE SORT OF GOING, WHAT 

241
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,392
IS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT? 

242
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,027
THIS IS A PLAN THAT WE HAD 

243
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:08,494
ALREADY ENACTED. 

244
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,229
AND I SUSPECT THAT THE MEMBERS 

245
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,364
OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM WILL BE 

246
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,064
FEELING THE SAME. 

247
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:21,374
IT IS LIKE, WOW, THEY WILL BE 

248
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,408
AMAZED THAT THERE ARE SO MANY 

249
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:22,875
PEOPLE INVOLVED. 

250
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,210
THEY WILL BE AMAZED AT THE 

251
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,311
MILITARY AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE 

252
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,879
THAT ARE AROUND THAT CAVE OR IN 

253
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,047
THE VICINITY OF THAT CASE. 

254
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,282
REGARDING THE MEDICAL, I MEAN, 

255
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:29,949
IT IS JUST A CHECKUP. 

256
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,350
YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

257
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,022
THEY ARE FIT AND HEALTHY AND 

258
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:36,856
THEY ARE YOUNG LADS, 

259
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,323
FOOTBALLERS, PROBABLY 

260
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:37,723
REASONABLY FIT. 

261
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,891
THEY PROBABLY NEED A GOOD MEAL 

262
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,992
AND CERTAIN AND SOME GOOD WATER 

263
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:40,927
AND REHYDRATION AND THEY WILL 

264
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,895
BE RIGHT AS RAIN. 

265
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:59,912
BUT PSYCHOLOGICALLY, IT WILL BE 

266
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,380
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY 

267
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,047
COPE WHEN THEY REALIZE HOW MUCH 

268
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,249
INTEREST THE WORLD HAS HAD IN 

269
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:03,883
THEIR SITUATION. 

270
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,251
>> WOULD SUMMITTED THAT HAS 

271
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:05,918
BEEN RESCUED UNDER SEARCH, SUCH 

272
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:06,485
CONDITIONS, NORMALLY HAVE 

273
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,587
PSYCHOLOGICAL IN PLACE, IS IT 

274
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:07,887
ADVISABLE? 

275
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,621
>> I DON'T NEVER PARTICULARLY 

276
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,056
WITH THE AGE OF THE YOUNGSTERS 

277
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:10,990
INVOLVED, IT IS SOMETHING THAT 

278
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,091
THEY WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT 

279
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,259
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, THEY MIGHT 

280
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:20,733
HAVE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH 

281
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,534
CONFINED SPACES OR WATER. 

282
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,968
IF IT IS DONE IN A POSITIVE 

283
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,537
WAY, IF THEY HAVE GOT OUT AND 

284
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,771
ACTUALLY IT HAS NOT LED TO ANY 

285
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,372
SORT OF 

286
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,073
>> REPORTER:, THAT ACTUALLY, 

287
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,407
THEY WILL PROBABLY GET EVERY  

288
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:28,774
WHITE QUICKLY. 

289
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,842
MOST YOUNG PEOPLE I BELIEVE ARE 

290
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,443
PRETTY RESILIET. 

291
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,677
I SHOULD NOT THINK THAT THERE 

292
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,711
WILL BE LONG-TERM EFFECTS. 

293
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:33,913
>> JUST TO GO BACK VERY 

294
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,847
QUICKLY, YOU MENTIONED SOME OF 

295
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,048
THE TRAINING THAT TOOK PLACE 

296
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:36,448
AND EQUIPMENT. 

297
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:49,762
HOW HEAVY IS THAT EQUIPMENT? 

298
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,896
WOULD THE BOYS HAVE BEEN 

299
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:51,597
DRESSED IN PROPER WETSUITS? 

300
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,298
WOULD THEY NEED THAT? 

301
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,132
BECAUSE OF THE WATER? 

302
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,433
OR IS THE WATER QUITE WARM IN 

303
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,001
THAILAND CAVES? 

304
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,369
>> I DO NOT KNOW THE ACTUAL 

305
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,503
TEMPERATURE, BUT YOU WILL FIND 

306
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,270
THAT THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF 

307
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,039
A CAVE AND PROBABLY THAT WATER 

308
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:11,517
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAVE IS THE 

309
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:12,385
AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF THE 

310
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,519
COUNTRY THAT YOU ARE IN. 

311
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,253
BEING IN THAILAND, I WOULD 

312
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,354
IMAGINE THAT THE WATER WOULD BE 

313
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,889
IN THE 20s, EARLY 20s, 21, 22 

314
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,190
DEGREES CELSIUS, AND YOU CAN DO 

315
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,091
PRETTY WELL WITHOUT A WETSUIT 

316
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:19,925
IN THAT TEMPERATURE. 

317
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:20,660
THE EQUIPMENT IS FAIRLY HEAVY. 

318
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,961
I'M SURE THAT THEY MANAGED THAT 

319
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,496
AND THEY MANAGED IT IN A WAY TO 

320
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,531
MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUNGSTERS 

321
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,732
MAY NOT HAVE CARRIED THE 

322
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,433
EQUIPMENT THEMSELVES OR, IF 

323
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,567
THEY DID, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 

324
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:35,841
SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN MANAGE. 

325
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,143
AS I SAID, IT IS REALLY 

326
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,177
ADVANTAGEOUS IN THAT SORT OF 

327
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:38,911
SITUATION THAT PEOPLE DO NOT 

328
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,146
ACTUALLY SWAM BECAUSE, IF THEY 

329
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,014
DO SWIM, THEY GET LOST, BUT IF 

330
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,117
THEY ARE HEAVY, YOU CAN PLACE 

331
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,252
THEM ON THE FLOOR AND THE DIVER 

332
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,587
KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE AND THE 

333
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
RESCUE DIVER CAN THEN MOVE 

334
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,955
AROUND THEM, AND THEY CANNOT 

335
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,323
ACTUALLY EASILY MOVE AWAY. 

336
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:52,324
THAT IS A REAL ADVANTAGE AND 

337
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:53,659
THEN YOU KNOW WHERE THE DIAPERS 

338
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,393
ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE UP TO. 

339
00:09:55,393 --> 00:10:04,971
>> WE HEARD MENTION OF THE IDEA 

340
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,105
OF SEDATING, THE POSSIBILITY OF 

341
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,139
SEDATING THE BOYS TO CALM THEM 

342
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:07,339
DOWN. 

343
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:08,641
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE 

344
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,975
EVER COME ACROSS IN CAVE DIVING 

345
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,410
OR THAT YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT A 

346
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,011
CAVE DIVING RESCUE? 

347
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,245
NO I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY. 

348
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:13,679
I DON'T KNOW. 

349
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,880
I SUSPECT ANYBODY THAT IS 

350
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,781
SEDATED IN ANY WAY NEEDS 

351
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,282
CAREFUL MANAGEMENT. 

352
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:24,824
I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE MIGHT 

353
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,657
HAVE SAID THAT, BUT OBVIOUSLY, 

354
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:26,859
THAT GIVES YOU AN ADDITIONAL 

355
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,860
PROBLEM BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE 

356
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,161
YOU GOT TO MONITOR THEM 

357
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:29,929
BREATHING AND THE REST OF IT 

358
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,330
BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT 

359
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,131
THEM MEDICALLY AS WELL. 

360
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,566
IF YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE 

361
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,166
RIGHT WAY. 

362
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,601
IT IS NOT ANYTHING THAT I HAVE 

363
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,802
THOUGHT OF OR SEEN BUT I CAN 

364
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,003
UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE THINK IT 

365
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,271
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA. 

366
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,274
EXPECT OBVIOUSLY, WATER PUMPING 

367
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,843
AND DRILLING HAS BEEN GOING ON 

368
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:44,910
AROUND THIS SITE. 

369
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,046
WOULD THAT HAVE ADDED A LOT OF 

370
00:10:47,046 --> 00:11:01,093
WEAKNESS TO THE MOUNTAIN RANGE 

371
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:01,894
AND THE CAVE SYSTEM? 

372
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,095
I PRESUME THAT SOME OF THE 

373
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,029
PUMPING WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE. 

374
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,664
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY AS A RESCUER 

375
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,166
TO GO TO THE SYSTEM LIKE THAT 

376
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,000
KNOWING THAT THAT HAD TAKEN 

377
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,300
PLACE? 

378
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,335
DOES THE WEAKNESS ADD A REAL 

379
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:09,535
RISK? 

380
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,136
>> NO. 

381
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,003
THE MOUNTAINS AND WHERE THE 

382
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,338
KIDS ARE -- IT IS ALL 

383
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:12,638
LIMESTONE. 

384
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:17,409
IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR HUNDREDS 

385
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,711
OF THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF 

386
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,079
YEARS IN THE FORM THAT IT IS. 

387
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,514
IT IS NOT GOING TO FALL DOWN. 

388
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,915
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE AFFECTED 

389
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:23,549
BY DRILLING OR PUMPING, 

390
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:28,187
CERTAINLY NO MORE THAN WATER 

391
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,221
AFFECTING THE SYSTEM AND THAT 

392
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:29,922
NORMAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 

393
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:30,556
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. 

394
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:30,756
NO. 

395
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,725
THAT WOULD NOT WORRY ME AT ALL. 

396
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,328
>> OKAY. 

397
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,063
IT HAS BEEN FASCINATING. 

398
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,364
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 

399
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:38,564
TIME. 

400
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:38,864
THANK YOU. 

401
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,832
>>> THANK YOU. 

402
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,034
>>> A LOT OF REACTION FROM 

403
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:57,883
AROUND THE WORLD TAKING PLACE, 

404
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,485
AND AS WE HEARD AND AS I SAID 

405
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,486
EARLIER, THIS IS AN 

406
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:00,953
INTERNATIONAL STORY, 

407
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:01,620
INTERNATIONAL RESCUE OPERATION, 

408
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,655
AND WE ARE HEARING FROM THE 

409
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,556
USA, FROM DONALD TRUMP THAT 

410
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,790
WILL BE VISITING THE UK NEXT 

411
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,990
WEEK. 

412
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,192
HE HAS TWEETED, SAYING THAT THE 

413
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,393
U.S. IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY 

414
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,427
WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND 

415
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,862
TO HELP GET ALL OF THE CHILDREN 

416
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,096
OUT OF THE CAVE AND TO SAFETY. 

417
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:12,298
VERY BRAVE AND TALENTED PEOPLE. 

418
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,499
I MUST ADD THAT THERE ARE OTHER 

419
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,533
COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE 

420
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,334
RESCUE INCLUDING THE UK, THE 

421
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,737
U.S., AND AUSTRALIA AND THE 

422
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,338
PEOPLE FROM THAILAND 

423
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:19,838
THEMSELVES, OF COURSE. 

424
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:25,344
YOU ARE WATCHING BBC NEWS. 

425
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,511
THE PICTURES THAT YOU SEE 

426
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:27,513
AOUND THE RESCUE SITE AT THE 

427

CAVE ENTRANCE. 

428
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,048
I SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT 

429
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,284
EARLIER WHO IS OUTSIDE OF THE 

430
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,219
HOSPITAL WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT 

431
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,887
THE BOYS WILL HAVE BEEN TAKEN 

432
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:39,291
TO. 

433
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,626
>> Reporter: WE HAVE SEEN TWO 

434
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,560
AMBULANCES RACING INTO THE 

435
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:41,827
HOSPITAL. 

436
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,028
WE DO NOT KNOW WHO EXACTLY IS 

437
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,363
INSIDE THE  WE KNOW THAT THREE 

438
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,197
AMBULANCES LEFT THE CAVE 

439
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,634
COMPLEX, PROBABLY ABOUT AN HOUR 

440
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,168
AWAY FROM HERE. 

441
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,970
THEY RACED ALONG THE ROAD TO 

442
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:08,954
THIS POINT.  

443
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,389
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE BEST 

444
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,624
SOURCE AT THE MOMENT FOR WHAT 

445
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,424
IS HAPPENING IS PROBABLY THE 

446
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,826
THAI NAVY SEALS AND ON THEIR 

447
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,660
FACEBOOK PAGE, THEY HAVE BEEN 

448
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,861
PROVIDING REGULAR UPDATES AS TO 

449
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:16,461
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. 

450
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,496
REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE THE 

451
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,898
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE 

452
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,199
CAVE AND THE ONES THAT HAVE 

453
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,033
BEEN TAKING VIDEOS AND POSTING 

454
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,468
IT OF THE BOYS THAT HAVE BEEN 

455
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:22,768
TRAPPED. 

456
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,003
THEY SAY THAT FOUR BOYS AT THIS 

457
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,170
STAGE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO 

458
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,876

00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,377
HOUR FROM HERE. 

460
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,711
THAT IS THE WORD FROM THAT. 

461
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,545
LOTS OF OTHER REPORTS ARE 

462
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:34,747
WHIRLING AROUND AT THE MOMENT. 

463
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,981
WE CANNOT SAY FOR SURE IF THEY 

464
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,182
ARE ACCURATE BUT WHAT WE KNOW 

465
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:38,384
IS THAT THERE ARE TWO 

466
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,418
AMBULANCES HERE AND FOUR BOYS 

467
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,252
BROUGHT TO SAFETY ACCORDING TO 

468
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,654
THE UNIT, THE LEAD UNIT, WHICH 

469
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,388
HAS BEEN SPEARHEADING THIS 

470
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:42,688
OPERATION. 

471
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,489

472
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,490
CONCERNS FOR THE CHILDREN'S 

473

HEALTH AS THEY ARE BROUGHT TO 

474
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,025
THE HOSPITAL? 

475
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,659
DO WE KNOW WHAT PLAN HAS BEEN 

476
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,727
PUT IN PLACE? 

477
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:54,066
>> Reporter:  WELCOMES 

478
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,000
OFFICIALS HERE, DOCTORS AND 

479
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,901
NURSES, HAVE NOT BEEN SPEAKING 

480
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,102
PUBLICLY ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE 

481
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:57,870
BEEN PLANNING BUT CLEARLY THEY 

482
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,104
HAVE HAD SOME TIME TO PREPARE 

483
00:13:59,104 --> 00:13:59,505
FOR THIS. 

484
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,906
THEY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY 

485
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:21,260
NEED TO BE TREATING POTENTIALLY 

486
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,494
AND THAT EVER SINCE THE BOYS 

487
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,696
HAVE BEEN FOUND AT THE START OF 

488
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,130
LAST WEEK, THEY HAVE HAD A 

489
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,332
DOCTOR WITH THEM THAT HAS BEEN 

490
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,266
ABLE TO ASSESS THEIR MEDICAL 

491
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,167
CONDITION ON AN HOURLY BASIS. 

492
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,135
WE HEARD THE OFFICIALS IN THIS 

493
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:30,602
 

494
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:31,503
THAT THE BOYS WERE STRONG 

495
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,504
ENOUGH, MENTALLY FIT TO EMBARK 

496
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,238
ON THIS RESCUE ATTEMPT. 

497
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,640
CLEARLY A DECISION WAS MADE TO 

498
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,774
GO WITH HIS RELATIVE BREAK IN 

499
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,875
THE WEATHER, TO TRY TO EMBARK 

500
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,810
ON A SUCCESSFUL RESCUE. 

501
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,911
IN TERMS OF HOW THE INDIVIDUAL 

502
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,145
BOYS WOULD BE TREATED, WE HAVE 

503
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,647
NOT GOT THE INFORMATION AT THE 

504
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:41,880
MOMENT. 

505
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,015
CLEARLY THEY KNOW THE AGES OF 

506
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,016
THE BOYS, CONDITIONS OVER THE 

507
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,250
PAST WEEK OR SO, SO YOU WOULD 

508
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,384
IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A TAILOR-

509
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:47,486
MADE PLAN FOR EACH OF THESE 

510
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,287
YOUNG FOOTBALLERS AS HOPEFULLY 

511
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,521
THEY ALL EMERGED TO SAFETY AND 

512
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,723
THEY ARE TREATED HERE AND 

513
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,523
ULTIMATELY RENITED WITH THEIR 

514
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:51,790
FAMILIES. 

515
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,758
>> AND THE HELICOPTERS -- WE 

516
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,692
UNDERSTAND THAT THE HELICOPTERS 

517
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,593
HAD BEEN PUT ON STANDBY. 

518
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,195
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PLANS IN 

519
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,329
TERMS OF GETTING THE BOYS TO 

520
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,230
THE HOSPITAL AS SOON AS 

521
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,497
POSSIBLE. 

522
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,065
WHY IS IT THAT THE THEY HAVE 

523
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,465
USED AMBULANCES? 

524
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:18,550
>> Reporter:  I THINK IT IS 

525
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,651
PROBABLY FOR THE MEDICAL TEAMS 

526
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:20,586
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING 

527
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,287
DYNAMIC RISK ASSESSMENTS AS 

528
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,421
THEY CALL IT BUT WE IMAGINE 

529
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,522
THAT THE BOYS WERE PROBABLY 

530
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,456
ASSESSED AFTER THE FIRST AND 

531
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,457
HARDEST PART OF THE RESCUE 

532
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:25,858
ATTEMPT. 

533
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,692
THAT WAS THE STUMBLING BLOCK. 

534
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,693
THE CAVES ARE SO NARROW, 

535
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,028
FLOODED IN PARTS, AND THEY WERE 

536
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,928
REALLY CONCERNED THAT THEY 

537
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,130
WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING THE BOYS 

538
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,964
SAFELY THROUGH THESE WINDING 

539
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,165
AND VERY NARROW PASSAGEWAYS AND 

540
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:33,465
CORRIDORS. 

541
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,099
THERE WERE PROBABLY ASSESSED 

542
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,301
AFTER THE FIRST POINT AND A 

543
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,335
DECISION MADE THAT THEY WOULD 

544
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,436
CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE 

545
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:37,903
RESCUE OPERATION. 

546
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:38,971
AS FOR HELICOPTERS, THEY ARE 

547
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,239
CLEARLY MUCH QUICKER BUT IF THE 

548
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,609
DECISION WAS MADE THAT BRINGING 

549
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,010
THEM HERE BY ROAD WAS THE BEST 

550
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,944
OPTION, THEY HAVE GONE WITH 

551
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:46,177
THAT. 

552
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:47,413
WE SAW A HELICOPTER TAKE OFF 

553
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,014
EARLY FROM THE SITE AND IT IS 

554
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,449
NOT CLEAR WHO WAS IN THAT AND 

555
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,450
WHAT ROLE HE WAS PLAYING.  

556
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,084
SMITH OKAY. 

557
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:52,684
THAT WAS DAN JOHNSON. 

558
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,653
WHAT WE CAN SEE IS THE LOCAL 

559
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,156
GOVERNOR OF THE PROVIDENCE. 

560
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,392
WE ARE GETTING A TRANSLATION TO

00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:10,636
LATEST, REGARDING THE RESCUE 

563
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:10,969
OPERATION. 

564
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,237
WHEN HE SAT DOWN AND STARTED 

565
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,472
SPIN, WE WERE ABLE TO HEAR 

566
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,073
CHEERING FROM THE PRESS 

567
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,240
GATHERED AT THIS PRESS 

568
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,009
CONFERENCE. 

569
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,444
SO AS SOON AS WE KNOW, IN TERMS 

570
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,878

571
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:20,712
THE RESCUE OPERATION, WE WILL 

572
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:21,313
UPDATE YOU. 

573
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,484
WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS THAT 19?

574
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,752
90. 

575
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,019
MY FAULT. 

576
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:34,927
90. 90 DIVERS ARE CURRENTLY 

577
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,396
INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION. 

578
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,798
54 DIVERS AND 40 THAI DIAPERS. 

579
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:52,478
THEY ARE INVOLVED -- DIVERS 

580
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,512
INVOLVED IN RESCUING THESE FOUR 

581
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,213
BOYS AND THEIR COACH. 

582
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,447
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE CAVE 

583
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,448
SYSTEM FOR ALMOST A FORTNIGHT 

584
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,783
AND THEY WERE IN THERE FROM 

585
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,817
JUNE 23 AND THE LATEST 

586
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,152
CONFIRMATION THAT WE HEARD IS 

587
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,054
THAT FOUR OF THE BOYS HAD 

588
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,155
EXITED AND HAD MANAGED TO BE 

589
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,189
RESCUED FROM THE CAVE SYSTEM. 

590
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,491
WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT CONDITION 

591
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:15,968
THEY WERE IN WHEN THEY CAME OUT 

592
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,569
BUT WHAT WE CAN CONFIRM IS THAT 

593
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,770
PART OF THE MEDICAL PLAN THAT 

594
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,771
WAS PUT IN PLACE SHOWED THAT 

595
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,205
THOSE BOYS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT 

596
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:21,573
IN AMBULANCES. 

597
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,540
WE SAW THE AMBULANCES LEAVING 

598
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,442
THE RESCUE SITE AND WE 

599
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,675
UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN 

600
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:25,977
TO THE LOCAL OR DISTRICT 

601
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:40,325
HOSPITAL AND IT IS ABOUT AN 

602
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,260
HOUR AWAY BY CAR. 

603
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,561
THEY ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF 

604
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:42,994
USING HELICOPTERS. 

605
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,196
THERE WAS AN AMBULANCE FOR EACH 

606
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:44,396
BOY. 

607
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,430
A NUMBER OF HELICOPTERS WERE ON 

608
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,999
LOCATION AS WELL BUT THE 

609
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:53,405
WEATHER HINDERED THAT FOR THE 

610
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:53,672
HOSPITAL. 

611
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,306
THEY WERE TAKEN BY ROAD. 

612
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,340
WE UNDERSTAND, IN TERMS OF 

613
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,742
CHOOSING WHICH BOYS TO GET OUT 

614
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,876
OF THERE FIRST, THEY TOOK THE 

615
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,777
WEAKEST  OF THE BOYS. 

616
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,313
SO THE FIRST BOY REPORTEDLY 

617
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:06,385
LEFT THAT CAVE AT 5:40 PM LOCAL 

618
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,586
TIME. 

619
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:13,225
THE TIME NOW IS 8:50 PM. 

620
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,327
LET ME PUT THAT INTO THE LOCAL 

621
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,895
TIME BST. 

622
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,330
WE GOT THE NEWS OF THE FIRST 

623
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:28,540
RESCUE JUST AFTER 1:00 BRITISH 

624
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:28,840
SUMMERTIME. 

625
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,741
A LOT OF ANALYSTS ARE SAYING 

626
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:30,876
THAT THE RESCUE HAS ACTUALLY 

627
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,377
TAKEN PLACE A LOT FASTER THAN 

628
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,077
ANTICIPATED, A LOT FASTER THAN 

629
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:36,815
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD. 

630
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,016
WE EXPECTED THE FIRST OF THE 

631
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,918
BOYS TO BE BROUGHT OUT OF THERE 

632
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:44,223
BY 3 PM. 

633
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:44,923
THAT IS BRITISH SUMMERTIME. 

634
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:45,624
HERE WE GO. 

635
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,725
MORE AMBULANCES ARE MOVING 

636
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:53,465
AROUND THAT SITE. IN TERMS OF 

637
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,866
THE RESCUE SO, THOSE BOYS WOULD 

638
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:55,700
HAVE HAD TO TRAVEL UNDERWATER, 

639
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,706
DIVING, FOR ABOUT 1 KILOMETER. 

640
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,340
IT IS NOT ALL UNDERWATER BUT 

641
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,774
IT'S THE ROUTE THAT WAS 

642
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:06,145
TREACHEROUS THAT CAUSE THE MOST 

643
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,012
CONCERN BCAUSE, AT TIMES, THEY 

644
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:11,116
WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE SOME OF 

645
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,551
THAT IS -- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

646
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,352
THE DIVERS THEMSELVES BECAUSE 

647
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,820
THE BOYS WOULD HAVE BEEN 

648
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:24,329
ATTACHED TO THE EXPERT DIVERS 

649
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,764
BY A BREATHING LINE SO THE 

650
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,865
DIVERS WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE HAD 

651
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:27,966
TO WATCH THE BOYS TO ENSURE 

652
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,601
úTH 

653
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,435
PANIC, BECAUSE THAT IS THE 

654
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,470
GREATEST DANGER TO BRINGING THE 

655
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,838
BOYS OUT ALIVE, BUT THEY HAD TO 

656
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,173
MAKE SURE THAT THE AIR TANKS 

657
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,174
WERE PASSED THROUGH THE NARROW 

658
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:35,774
PASSAGES CAREFULLY. 

659
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,675
THE BOYS WERE BROUGHT THROUGH. 

660
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,509
THE AIR TANKS WERE REATTACHED. 

661
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:44,016
THE RESCUE WOULD HAVE CONTINUED.

662
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,450
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A COUPLE 

663
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,585
OF STOPS ALONG THE WAY WHERE 

664
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,886
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO 

665
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:48,920
WALK AND CHECKED OVER BEFORE 

666
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,189
THEY WOULD HAVE CONTINUED 

667
00:19:50,189 --> 00:20:02,100
TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE OF THE 

668
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,433
CAVE ITSELF. 

669
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:03,735
GETTING IN THERE, SOME OF THE 

670
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,536
STATISTICS -- IT WOULD HAVE 

671
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,737
TAKEN AROUND 6 HOURS BUT 

672
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,972
REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE GOING IN 

673
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,173
THERE WITH A LOT OF EQUIPMENT. 

674
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,207
SO SIX HOURS FOR THE RESCUE 

675
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,208
TEAM TO GET IN, WALKING, 

676
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,443
SWIMMING AND DIVING AS WELL. 

677
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,078
THE ESTIMATION IS THAT IT WOULD 

678
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,313
TAKE ABOUT FIVE HOURS TO GET 

679
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:14,913
THE BOYS OUT. 

680
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:15,947
THE CONFIRMATION, IF YOU ARE 

681
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,149
JUST JOINING US ON BBC NEWS IS 

682
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,684
THAT FOUR OF THE 12 BOYS THAT 

683
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,252
HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN THAT CAVE 

684
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,854
SYSTEM IN TIME WHEN CAVE IN 

685
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,457
NORTHERN THAILAND HAVE BEEN 

686
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:32,564
BROUGHT OUT. 

687
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,799
I AM OPTIMISTIC AND I WILL SAY 

688
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,100
SAFELY BROUGHT OUT BUT WHAT WE 

689
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,435
DO KNOW IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 

690
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,803
TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL AND RESCUE 

691
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,837
PLANS WERE PUT IN PLACE AND 

692
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:44,343
ALSO PLANS TO GET THOSE 

693
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,143
CHILDREN STRAIGHT TO A 

694
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:45,410
HOSPITAL. 

695
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,745
IN TERMS OF LOGISTICS AND 

696
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:54,219

REMEMBER THAT YOU NEED THE 

700

00:20:57,188 --> 00:21:00,392
YOU NEED SUPPORT DIVERS AS WELL.

54 AND DIVERS ARE INVOLVED FROM 

703
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:10,369
AROUND THE WORLD. 

704
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,369
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TWEETED, 

705
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:12,371
SAYING THAT THE U.S. IS 

706
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,205

THAILAND. 

709
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:21,146
40 LOCAL DIVERS ARE INVOLVED. 

710
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,547
IN TERMS OF MOVING ONTO THE 

711
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:29,454
NEXT STAGE OF THE RESCUE, THE 

712
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,389

PREPARE FOR THE NEXT STAGE OF 

715
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:39,030
THIS OPERATION. 

716
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,532
SO THERE COULD BE A BREAK IN 

717
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,633
ADVANCE AND FURTHER NEWS COMING 

718
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,470

10 HOUR GAP IS NEEDED FOR THE

SOUTH YOU ARE IN THE UK BUT

MANY PLACES ARE SEEING SUNSHINE

00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:41,026
AND THIS IS A VIEW FROM

OF IMMEDIATE TREATMENT THEY 

835
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,212
COULD BE RECEIVING BECAUSE THEY 

836
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,180
HAVE NOT SEEN THE LIGHT, FOR 

837
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,247
EXAMPLE, FOR NUMBER OF DAYS? 

838
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,248
>> Reporter: THE THING TO 

839
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,949
REMEMBER IS THEY HAVE HAD A 

840
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,017
DOCTOR WITH THEM FOR NEARLY ONE 

841
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:39,250
WEEK. 

842
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,185
HER DOCTOR WAS ABLE TO GET 

843
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,186
THERE AND ASSESS THEM ON A 

844
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,921

848
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,462
WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO EMBARK ON 

849
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,029
THIS RESCUE ATTEMPT. 

850
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,896
CLEARLY A DECISION WAS MADE 

851
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,664
THERE. 

852
00:28:52,664 --> 00:29:02,674
WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOME DETAIL 

853
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:03,575

UNIT IN THE HOSPITAL SET ASIDE 

856
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,010
FOR THE BOYS. 

857
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,011
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT IS 

858
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:07,578
INDIVIDUAL CUBICLES, BUT 

859
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:08,379
CERTAINLY SPECIALIST TEAMS ON 

860
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,480
HAND WILL CARRY OUT THE BASIC 

861
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,448
OBSERVATIONAL CHECKS, BLOOD 

862
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,884
TESTS, URINE TESTS, OTHER 

863
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:13,284
NORMAL THINGS. 

864
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,421
THAT IS IF IT IS THE BEST 

865
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,922
OUTCOME IF ALL THE BOYS ARE 

866
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,957
ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THE CAVES, 

867
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,060
WALK PART OF THE WAY, AND THEN 

868
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:28,366
BE BROUGHT HERE. 

869
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,134
CLEARLY, IF THERE IS MORE 

870
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,401
DIFFICULTY OR A WEAKENED 

871
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,972
CONDITION, THE SPECIALIST'S 

872
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:34,873
WILL HAVE A TOUGHER JOB, IN 

873
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:35,740
TERMS OF ANY TREATMENT GOING 

874
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:42,580
ON, THAT IS UNCLEAR.  

875
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,214
>> CERTAINLY REASSURING THAT 

876
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,482
THEY HAVE MADE THEIR WAY TO THE 

877
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:44,749
HOSPITAL. 

878
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:45,683
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE DEGREE 

879
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,784
OF RELIEF ON THE PART OF THE 

880
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:54,859
FAMILIES, ANY WORD FROM THEM? 

881
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,027

882
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,028
THE FAMILIES ARE HERE AT THE 

883
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:57,862
MOMENT, CERTAINLY FOR THE PAST 

884
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:58,963
TWO WEEKS WE HAVE SEEN THEM IN 

885
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,664
DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE 

886
00:29:59,664 --> 00:29:59,997
CAVE COMPLEX. 

887
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,099
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THEIR OWN 

888
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:01,900
TUCKED AWAY AREA WHERE THEY 

889
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,201
HAVE BEEN KEPT UP TO DATE WITH 

890
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:03,734
THE LATEST INFORMATION. 

891
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:04,736
TODAY THEY WOULD'VE BEEN THE 

892
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,570
FIRST TO KNOW AND WOULD'VE BEEN 

893
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,604
GIVEN ALL OF THE UPDATES FROM 

894
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:07,605
THE DIVERS AND RESCUE TEAMS AS 

895
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:14,245
THEY STARTED THE OPERATION AND 

896
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:14,712
DECIDED TO CONTINUE. 

897
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:15,713
IT COULD BE THAT THE FAMILY 

898
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:16,514
MEMBERS ARE INSIDE NOW. 

899
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,649
WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE 

900
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,549
OR IF THEY HAVE SEEN THEIR 

901
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:19,083
LOVED ONES YET. 

902
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:23,688
CLEARLY, A DREADFUL ORDEAL, TWO 

903
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,189
WEEKS THEY HAVE HAD TO COPE 

904
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,759
WITH THIS. 

905
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,760
FIRST THERE WAS THE DREADFUL 

906
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,494
SENSATION OF NOT KNOWING WHAT 

907
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,094
HAD HAPPENED. 

908
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,629
FOR NINE DAYS THOSE BOYS WERE 

909
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:41,039
TRAPPED AND FINALLY THOSE TWO 

910
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,639
BRITISH AMATEUR DIVERS WERE 

911
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,640
ABLE TO LOCATE THEM AND TELL 

912
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,708
THE WORLD THAT THEY HAD BEEN 

913
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:43,941
FOUND. 

914
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:44,809
IN TERMS OF THE REACTION FROM 

915
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,876
THE FAMILIES, WE HAVE NOT BEEN 

916
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:46,244
THAT YET. 

917
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,012
THIS IS STILL IN THE EARLY 

918
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,815
DAYS, ONLY FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN 

919
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:51,883
BROUGHT TO SAFETY, 13 ARE IN 

920
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,919
THE PARTY, CLEARLY A LONG WAY 

921
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,855
TO GO.  

922
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:58,890
>> WE ARE WATCHING FOR 

923
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,390
DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY. 

924
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,124
TAKING A STEP BACK, THIS REALLY 

925
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,326
HAS BROUGHT THE COUNTRY 

926
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,361
TOGETHER, HASN'T IT? WE HEAR 

927
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,462
ARE UTTERLY GRIPPED, I CAN ONLY 

928
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,096
IMAGINE HOW EMOTIONALLY CHARGED 

929
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:09,434
THINGS ARE THERE IN THAILAND? 

930
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,234
>> Reporter: THAILAND AS A 

931
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:11,269
NATION HAS BEEN PRAYING FOR THE 

932
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,106
BEST, FEARING THE WORST. IF YOU 

933
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,140
SPEAK WITH THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE 

934
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,875
HERE, THEY ARE AS ONE, THEY ARE 

935
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,178
SO DETERMINED THAT THESE BOYS 

936
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:21,746
SHOULD BE RESCUED. 

937
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,713
WE MET SOME OF THE WELL-WISHERS 

938
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:24,115
AND VOLUNTEERS AT THE SITE. 

939
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:24,949
THEY HAVE CREATED A COMMUNITY 

940
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:29,253
THERE OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS 

941
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:30,355
AND THE SENSE OF OPTIMISM WHEN 

942
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,356
THEY HEARD THAT THE BOYS HAVE 

943
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:31,956
BEEN LOCATED, THAT WAS 

944
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,658
INCREDIBLE, THERE WAS AN ENERGY 

945
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:39,630
WHICH FLOWED THROUGH THE SITE. 

946
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,898
IS SUSTAINED SO MANY PEOPLE 

947
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:41,465
THAT WERE WORKING EXTREMELY 

948
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:41,799
LONG SHIFTS. 

949
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,834
IF YOU LOOK IN THE EYES OF SOME 

950
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,168
OF THE RESCUERS AND DIVERS, 

951
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:44,936
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY SHATTERED, 

952
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,005
BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULD KEEP 

953
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,174
GOING FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. 

954
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,442
CLEARLY, IF WE HAVE THE NEWS IN 

955
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,510
THE COMING HOURS THAT ALL OF 

956
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:59,684
THESE BOYS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE 

957
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,518
BROUGHT OUT TO SAFETY, THERE 

958
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,151
WILL BE UTTER JUBILATION. 

959
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,487
WE DO HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. 

960
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,821
FOUR BOYS SO FAR, 13 IN ALL. 

961
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,657
THIS IS VERY MUCH THE FOCUS FOR 

962
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,858
THE COMING HOURS. 

963
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,159
>> I'M ASSUMING THIS WILL GO ON 

964
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,196
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT? 

965
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:12,997
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY, WE 

966
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:13,764
JUST HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE 

967
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:20,605
FROM THE AUTHORITIES IN THIS 

968
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,439
PARTS OF NORTHERN THAILAND AND 

969
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,707
THEY GAVE AN UPDATE ON SOME OF 

970
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,207
THE IMMEDIATE DETAILS. 

971
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,042
WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

972
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,076
COLLEAGUES AT THE SCENE AND THE 

973
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:25,909
CAVE COMPLEX ABOUT ONE HOUR 

974
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:26,944
FROM CAR FROM HERE AND THEY 

975
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:29,280
HAVE SEEN THE VARIOUS AMBULANCES

976
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:37,288
DRIVE PAST TOWARDS THE MAIN 

977
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:37,488
ROAD. 

978
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,423
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN HELICOPTERS 

979
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,524
TAKEOFF SO WE DO EXPECT MORE 

980
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,658
BOYS TO BE BROUGHT HERE, 

981
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:45,396
CERTAINLY AS AND WHEN MORE BOYS 

982
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,364
ARE TAKEN OUT WE WILL HEAR 

983
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:46,664
MORE. 

984
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:47,432
REMEMBER, THIS WILL BE AN 

985
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:47,999
EXTREMELY LONG OPERATION. 

986
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,002
TO REACH THE BOYS THIS HAS 

987
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:57,942
TAKEN DIVERS 11 HOURS, SOME OF 

988
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:58,776
THEM HAVE 30 YEARS OF 

989
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,076
EXPERIENCE. 

990
00:32:59,076 --> 00:32:59,944
THIS IS A HUGE JOURNEY. 

991
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:00,978
DURING THE WEEK WE WERE ABLE TO 

992
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,046
GO TO A CAVE ABOUT 10 

993
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:02,880
KILOMETERS AWAY FROM THE SPOT 

994
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,882
WHERE THE BOYS WERE TRAPPED AND 

995
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:05,817
THE RESCUE OPERATION WAS TAKING 

996
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,050
PLACE. 

997
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,552
WE GOT A GLIMPSE OF THAT PLACE 

998
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:17,862
AND IT WAS CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND 

999
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,763
IT WAS HOT AND MURKY. 

1000
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:19,797
IF IT WAS FLOODED IN PARTS, 

1001
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,464
THERE WOULD'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY 

1002
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:20,998
NO VISIBILITY WHATSOEVER. 

1003
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:21,665
WE RECEIVED INFORMATION EARLIER 

1004
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:22,533
FROM THE THAI NAVY TEAMS 

1005
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,968
EXPLAINING THAT EACH BOY WOULD 

1006
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,971
BE SHOREBIRD -- SHEPHERDED 

1007
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,841
THROUGH BY TWO EXPERT DIVERS SO 

1008
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,844
THEY WOULD REALLY FEEL THEIR 

1009
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:34,679
PRESENCE AS THEY WERE MOVED 

1010
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:34,946
THROUGH. 

1011
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,382
THERE WAS A GUIDE ROPE SET UP 

1012
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,318
AND RATHER THAN BEING ABLE TO 

1013
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,052
LOOK WHERE YOU ARE GOING, 

1014
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,587
PEOPLE CAN MOVE THROUGH BIT BY 

1015
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:42,787
BIT. 

1016
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:43,554
ALSO, OF COURSE, THE CORE DOORS 

1017
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:50,995
ARE SO NARROW. THAT WAS PART OF 

1018
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:51,496
THE PROBLEM. 

1019
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:52,763
IT WAS NOT JUST GOING OUT AT 

1020
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:53,063
ONE ANGLE. 

1021
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:53,931
THEY WERE GOING UP, THEY WERE 

1022
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,902
GOING DOWN, SOME OF THE BEST 

1023
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:58,870
CAVE DIVERS IN THE WORLD SAID 

1024
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,004
IT WAS A TOUGH CHALLENGE FOR 

1025
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:00,204
THEM. 

1026
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,039
REMEMBER, SOME OF THESE BOYS 

1027
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,472
COULD NOT SWIM. 

1028
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,440
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW THEY 

1029
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,075
WERE FEELING ABOUT 10 AM THIS 

1030
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,009
MORNING WHEN THE DECISION WAS 

1031
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,544
MADE TO EMBARK ON THIS RESCUE 

1032
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:06,978
ATTEMPT. 

1033
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:16,853
THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 

1034
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:17,755
SITUATION BUT WE DO BELIEVE 

1035
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:18,523
LAST NIGHT THAT THEY THOUGHT, 

1036
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,489
YES, THIS HAS TO HAPPEN. 

1037
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:20,491
THE RAIN HAS STOPPED AND AFTER 

1038
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,259
3-4 DAYS OF GLORIOUS SUNSHINE, 

1039
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:21,958
IT HAS REALLY HELPED. 

1040
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,027
THEY WERE PUMPING OUT SO MUCH 

1041
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:27,797
WATER WHICH REALLY BROUGHT THE 

1042
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:28,299
WATER LEVEL DOWN. 

1043
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,333
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD A GOLDEN 

1044
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,201
OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR THIS. 

1045
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,402
THEY HAVE GONE FOR IT AND WE 

1046
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,437
ARE WAITING TO SEE THE OUTCOME. 

1047
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,437
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT, 

1048
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:34,938
PLEASE KEEP US POSTED. 

1049
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:42,679
OUR CORRESPONDENT, DAN JOHNSON, 

1050
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,781
IS IN THAILAND NEAR THE EXIT OF 

1051
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:44,649
THE TUNNEL, NIGHT HAS FALLEN, 

1052
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,219
WHAT IS THE LATEST? 

1053
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,154
>> Reporter: IT IS JUST FALLING 

1054
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,121
QUIET HERE, THERE HAS BEEN A 

1055
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,422
LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE LAST FEW 

1056
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:53,224
MINUTES BUT IT LOOKS LIKE 

1057
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,662
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE SITE FOR 

1058
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:57,962
THE NIGHT. 

1059
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:58,729
WE JUST GOT CONFIRMATION FROM 

1060
00:34:58,729 --> 00:34:59,964
THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT IS 

1061
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:00,898
GOING ON THAT FOUR OF THE BOYS 

1062
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,933
HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM THE CAVE 

1063
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,667
AND THAT THE OPERATION HAS 

1064
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:07,138
CONCLUDED FOR THE NIGHT. 

1065
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,239
THEY WILL LEAVE THE REST WHERE 

1066
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:08,639
THEY ARE. 

1067
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,607
WE UNDERSTAND THAT OTHERS HAVE 

1068
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,207
NOT EVEN STARTED THE JOURNEY 

1069
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:10,508
OUT. 

1070
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,078
THEY WANTED TO TAKE A GROUP OF 

1071
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,313
FOUR FIRST TO SEE IF THEY COULD 

1072
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,547
SAFELY MAKE IT OUT AND IT LOOKS 

1073
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,015
LIKE THEY HAVE ACHIEVED THAT. 

1074
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,050
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE FEE AND 

1075
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,850
GIVING EVERYONE A POSITIVE FEEL 

1076
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,986
THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE AND 

1077
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,921
EVERYONE CAN GET OUT SAFELY. 

1078
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:31,762
THE ONE THING TO BEAR IN MIND 

1079
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:32,830
IS THE TIREDNESS LEVELS OF THE 

1080
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,397
INVESTIGATORS LEADING THIS 

1081
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:33,698
OPERATION. 

1082
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,532
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD ALL 

1083
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,800
DAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE ARE 

1084
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,801
SOME OF THE DIVE TEAMS ACTUALLY 

1085
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:44,675
LEAVING THE SITE NOT. THERE ARE 

1086
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,443
18 SPECIALISTS DIVERS THAT HAVE 

1087
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,577
BEEN GUIDING THE BOYS, AS YOU 

1088
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,645
HAVE HEARD, IT TAKES MANY HOURS 

1089
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,913
JUST TO GET ONE BOY TO THE EXIT 

1090
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:49,513
OF THE CAVE. 

1091
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:53,918
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE TAKING 

1092
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:54,719
THE DECISION THAT THEY HAVE 

1093
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,053
DONE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN FOR 

1094
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:56,921
TODAY AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO 

1095
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,022
REST SO THEY ARE NOT DOING THE 

1096
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,190
JOB WHEN THEY ARE TOO TIRED, WE 

1097
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,291
ARE TOLD THEY WILL COME BACK 

1098
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,392
FRESH IN THE MORNING TO START 

1099
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,527
AGAIN AROUND 8 AM. EVERYONE IS 

1100
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:04,562
REALLY NOT POSITIVE THAT THEY 

1101
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,931
HAVE PROVEN THIS RESCUE METHOD 

1102
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,433
CAN WORK AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY 

1103
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,501
TEACH THESE BOYS AND UP ABOUT 

1104
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,502
SCUBA DIVING SO THAT THEY ARE 

1105
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,006
COMFORTABLE WITH THE CONDITIONS 

1106
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,107
AND WITH THE TASK THAT THEY 

1107
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,074
HAVE TO COMPLETE AND THE TRACK 

1108
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:25,216
THAT THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE 

1109
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,950
THROUGH THE FLOODED UNDERWATER 

1110
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,216
CAVERNS. 

1111
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:27,418
THIS IS A TRICKY THING FOR ANY 

1112
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,085
CAVE DIVER TO ACCOMPLISH, BUT 

1113
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,420
IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FOUR OF 

1114
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,388
THESE BOYS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

1115
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,322
MAKE IT SO FAR AND THE 

1116
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,256
EXPECTATION IS THAT MORE WILL 

1117
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:32,656
FOLLOW TOMORROW. 

1118
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:34,358
>> IT LOOKS LIKE A HIVE OF 

1119
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,494
ACTIVITY BEHIND YOU, CAN YOU 

1120
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,129
GIVE US A TASTE OF WHAT IS 

1121
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,599
GOING ON? 

1122
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,567
>> Reporter: THIS VERY MUCH HAS 

1123
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,434
THE FEEL OF THINGS WINDING 

1124
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,769
DOWN, THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE 

1125
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,603
FOR THE LAST 30 MINUTES 45 

1126
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,637
MINUTES WITH A FLOOD OF WORKERS 

1127
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:47,638
THAT HAVE LEFT THE SITE AFTER 

1128
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:55,279
THE LAST AMBULANCE THAT WE SAW. 

1129
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,547
IT WAS AROUND TWO HOURS AGO 

1130
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,381
THAT WE SAW THE FIRST AMBULANCE 

1131
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,449
DRIVE OUT JUST WHERE THAT CAR 

1132
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,249
IS LEAVING NOW WITH LIGHTS 

1133
00:36:59,249 --> 00:36:59,516
FLASHING. 

1134
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:04,055
IT HEADED OFF PRESUMABLY TO THE 

1135
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:04,889
HOSPITAL THAT YOU HEARD NICK 

1136
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,790
REPORTING FROM, THAT WAS 

1137
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,357
FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER THREE 

1138
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:06,991
AMBULANCES THAT LEFT WITH 

1139
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:07,391
LIGHTS ON. 

1140
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,193
WE HAVE SEEN AMBULANCES LEAVE 

1141
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:09,860
WITHOUT THEIR LIGHTS FLASHING 

1142
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,598
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE FOUR 

1143
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:15,433
BOYS WERE TAKEN SEPARATELY IN 

1144
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:15,833
THOSE AMBULANCES. 

1145
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:19,437
OTHERS HAVE LEFT THE SITE AT 

1146
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,471
THAT POSSIBLY IS JUST THE 

1147
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,405
MOVING AWAY FOR THE NIGHT AND 

1148
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,540
THEN EVERYONE WILL RETURN 

1149
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,274
TOMORROW MORNING TO RESTART THE 

1150
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,476
RESCUE EFFORT TO GET EVERYONE 

1151
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,844
ELSE OUT. 

1152
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:27,911
THEY SAID THAT TODAY WAS D-DAY, 

1153
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:28,946
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR IT. 

1154
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:29,980
THEY WERE GOING TO TRY THEIR 

1155
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,951
BEST TO PUT THIS RESCUE PLAN IN 

1156
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:34,785
ACTION AND THEY HAVE PROVEN 

1157
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:35,986
THIS CAN WORK FOR THE FOUR THAT 

1158
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:36,420
GOT OUT. 

1159
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,359
EVERYONE IS AWARE THERE ARE 

1160
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,627
STILL RISKS AND LOTS OF WORK TO 

1161
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:43,894
 

1162
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:44,962
THE REMAINING BOYS AND THE 

1163
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:52,737
COACH OUT OF THE CAVE.  

1164
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,503
>> YOU SPEAK ABOUT EXHAUSTION 

1165
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:54,405
LEVELS, HOW WILL THAT WORK 

1166
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,239
TOMORROW, WILL THERE BE A 

1167
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:55,673
TAGTEAM FORMAT? 

1168
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,875
ANOTHER SET OF DIVERS GOING IN? 

1169
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:04,382
>> Reporter: NO, WE BELIEVE IT 

1170
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,049
IS THE SAME CORE TEAM. 

1171
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:05,716
THE EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE 

1172
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:06,817
REQUIRED TO MANAGE A RESCUE 

1173
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:11,055
MISSION ACCESS ARE SO LIMITED. 

1174
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,189
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE 

1175
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,057
THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE DIVING SO 

1176
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,261
DEEP AND SO FAR UNDERGROUND IN 

1177
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:17,962
A CAVE THIS BIG. 

1178
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,963
THEY HAVE COME FROM ALL AROUND 

1179
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,364
THE WORLD, THERE ARE FIVE OR 

1180
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,732
SIX NATIONALITIES INVOLVED. 

1181
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:25,169
I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE WITH 

1182
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:25,869
EXPERIENCE IN THESE CONDITIONS 

1183
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:26,837
ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN 

1184
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,105
CALLING THE SHOTS AND HAVE 

1185
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:32,243
ASSESSED IF THE BOYS ARE READY 

1186
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,043
TO MAKE THE JOURNEY AND THEY 

1187
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:34,545
HAVE GUIDED THE MISSION FOR THE 

1188
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,415
FIRST FOUR BOYS TAKING CARE OF 

1189
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,750
THEM AND TAKING THEIR TIME. 

1190
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,185
NO ONE WANTED TO RUSH THIS OR 

1191
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:41,585
GET THINGS WRONG. 

1192
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,787
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL BE 

1193
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,355
TAKING A WELL EARNED BREAK AND 

1194
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,589
WILL COME BACK FRESH TOMORROW. 

1195
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,926
THERE IS NO BIG SUPPORT TEAM, 

1196
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,496
LOADS FROM THE THAI MILITARY 

1197
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,597
AND NAVY BUT THEY WERE CANDID 

1198
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,733
THAT THEY JUST DID NOT HAVE THE 

1199
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,500
EXPERIENCE OF THESE CONDITIONS 

1200
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,802
SO IT HAS WELCOMED THE 

1201
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:01,205
EXPERIENCE BUT THEY NEED TO USE 

1202
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,139
THIS WISELY. I THINK THE 

1203
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,774
RATIONALE IS THERE IS NO POINT 

1204
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:08,311
TIRING EVERYONE OUT OR WASTING 

1205
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:09,213
THE EXPERIENCE AND ENERGY. 

1206
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,015
LET EVERYONE TAKE THEIR TIME 

1207
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,617
AND CARE AND COME BACK TOMORROW 

1208
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,585
KNOWING THAT THIS RESCUE METHOD 

1209
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:18,255
CAN SUCCEED AND HOPING THAT IT 

1210
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,290
CAN HAPPEN FOR THE REST OF 

1211
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,324
THOSE PEOPLE STUCK IN THE CAVE. 

1212
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,292
CERTAINLY THEY NEED MORE TIME 

1213
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,626
AND THERE ARE STILL RISKS. 

1214
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,663
IT IS RAINING SLIGHTLY IN ONE 

1215
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,231
RISK IS THAT IF THE RAIN GETS 

1216
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:27,865
HEAVIER THE WATER LEVELS WILL 

1217
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,666
INCREASE AGAIN. 

1218
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,801
THE MANAGER SAID IF THAT 

1219
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,669
HAPPENS THEY WILL SPEED THINGS 

1220
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,537
UP AND MOVE QUICKLY TO GET 

1221
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,805
PEOPLE OUT FOR THE MOMENT, IT 

1222
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,207
DOES LOOK LIKE THEY ARE TAKING 

1223
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,641
CARE OF PUTTING THE PLAN INTO 

1224
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:44,515
OPERATION. 

1225
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,583
>> WE KNOW FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN 

1226
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,650
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, HOW DID 

1227
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,387
THEY DECIDE WHICH WAYS TO BRING 

1228
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,021
OUT FIRST? 

1229
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:51,621
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE HAD 

1230
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:54,825
DOCTORS IN THE CAVE OVER THE 

1231
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:55,726
WEEKEND ASSESSING THE CONDITION 

1232
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,293
OF THE BOYS. 

1233
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,595
THE CAVE DIVING EXPERTS HAVE 

1234
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:10,708
BEEN ASSESSING THEIR STRENGTH, 

1235
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,442
CONFIDENCE, ABILITY WITH SCUBA 

1236
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,243
DIVING EQUIPMENT, AND THEY HAVE 

1237
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:12,910
ALSO HAD MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS 

1238
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,911
TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THIS 

1239
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,444
TWO WEEK ORDEAL. 

1240
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:15,479
TWO WEEKS ON THE GROUND WITHOUT 

1241
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:15,879
PROPER FOOD. 

1242
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:16,680
THERE WERE 9-10 DAYS BEFORE 

1243
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,748
THEY WERE EVEN DISCOVERED AND 

1244
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,682
THEY DID NOT EAT AT ALL. 

1245
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:19,316
THEY HAVE DEFINITELY SUFFERED 

1246
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,351
DUE TO THE ORDEAL AND OUR 

1247
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:20,618
WEEKENDS. 

1248
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:21,552
BUT THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF 

1249
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,653
THE OPERATION BUT THAT THEY GOT 

1250
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,454
TO A SUFFICIENT POINT TODAY 

1251
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,888
WHERE THEY WERE READY TO AT 

1252
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:25,956
LEAST START GETTING THEM OUT. 

1253
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:26,857
WE UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE STARTED 

1254
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,460
WITH THE WEAKEST, ACTUALLY. WE 

1255
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,861
DO NOT KNOW IF THAT MEANS THE 

1256
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,131
ONES WEAKEST IN TERMS OF 

1257
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,266
STRENGTH OR WEAKEST WITH THE 

1258
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:35,933
SCUBA DIVING TECHNIQUE, BUT 

1259
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:45,776
THEY DID STARTED WITH THOSE 

1260
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,577
WEAK BOYS THEY THOUGHT NEEDED 

1261
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,578
TO COME OUT FIRST. 

1262
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,412
THEY PUT A SMALL GROUP TOGETHER 

1263
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:49,780
AND WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE A 

1264
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,581
SMALL GROUP THAT CAME OUT. 

1265
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:51,749
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY STARTED WITH 

1266
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:52,716
FOUR AND THEY WERE TAKEN BY 

1267
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:53,484
AMBULANCE, THERE IS ALSO THE 

1268
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,852
OPTION OF HELICOPTERS THAT HAVE 

1269
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,923
BEEN HERE ON STANDBY, WE HAVE 

1270
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:07,932
NOT HEARD OR SEEN THE 

1271
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,632
HELICOPTERS THIS CLOSE BECAUSE 

1272
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,833
THEY DO HAVE TO STAY A CERTAIN 

1273
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:10,734
DISTANCE AWAY TO FIND FLATLAND. 

1274
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:11,969
I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY ALL GOT 

1275
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,137
TO THE HOSPITAL BUT THEY DID GO 

1276
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:13,937
THERE PRETTY QUICKLY TO GET 

1277
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:14,237
TREATMENT. 

1278
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:15,239
NO DOUBT, THIS WILL TAKE SOME 

1279
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,140
RECOVERY FROM THE INITIAL SAW 

1280
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,007

00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,462
IF YOU HAVE A TORRENTIAL 

1462
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,798
DWNPOUR, WE HAVE SEEN IMAGES 

1463
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:18,836
OF THE CURRENT IN THE CAVE 

1464
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,403
TODAY. 

1465
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,104
THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR PROBLEM 

1466
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:26,542
FOR EVERYONE IF THE RAINFALL 

1467
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:32,683
INTENSIFIES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 

1468
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,051
>> FOR ALL OF US, IN FACT FOR 

1469
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:34,985
THE WORLD, THIS HAS BEEN A 

1470
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:37,754
CRASH COURSE IN CAVE DIVING. 

1471
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,190
WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE QUITE 

1472
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,158
TREACHEROUS CONDITIONS THAT THE 

1473
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,493
BOYS ARE HAVING TO FACE, FOR A 

1474
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:47,030
CHILD TO GO INTO THE CAVE, BUT 

1475
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,833
FOR A CHILD TO CAVE DIVE, WHAT 

1476
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:57,007
WOULD BE YOUR RESERVATIONS? 

1477
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:57,641
>> Reporter: IT IS EXTREMELY 

1478
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,775
CHALLENGING, THERE IS NO DOUBT 

1479
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:02,479
ABOUT THAT AT ALL. 

1480
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:03,613
THE IMAGES THAT WE ARE SEEING 

1481
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:04,815
OF THE YOUNGSTERS, CLEARLY SHOW 

1482
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,918
THEM IN GOOD MORALE, IN GREAT 

1483
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:08,618
MORALE! 

1484
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:14,291
AND YES, I'M QUITE SURE THAT 

1485
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,226
THEY ARE TAKING TO THIS 

1486
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,830
ACTIVITY REMARKABLY WELL 

1487
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,864
JUDGING BY THE SPEED OF THE 

1488
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,933
EVACUATION OF THE FIRST PEOPLE. 

1489
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:26,370
>> JOHN AND RICHARD ARE OUT 

1490
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,604
THERE ADDING THEIR EXPERTISE TO 

1491
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,473
THE OPERATION, HAVE YOU HEARD 

1492
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:34,878
ANY NEWS FROM THEM? 

1493
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:39,483
>> Reporter NO, IT WOULD 

1494
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,283
OBVIOUSLY BE GREAT TO SPEAK 

1495
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:41,485
WITH THEM, BUT WE ALL 

1496
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,786
APPRECIATE, EVERY FRIEND AND 

1497
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,121
FAMILY MEMBER OF THE BRITISH 

1498
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:46,623
DIVERS OUT THERE AND WE 

1499
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:50,360
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE 

1500
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:50,960
TOTALLY CONCENTRATING ON THE 

1501
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,762
JOB THAT HAS TO BE DONE. 

1502
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,164
THEY CANNOT AFFORD ANY 

1503
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,499
DISTRACTION FROM GETTING THAT 

1504
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,667
JOB DONE. 

1505
00:48:56,667 --> 00:49:00,604
THEY ARE THE BEST RESCUE TEAM 

1506
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,773
THAT POSSIBLY COULD BE PULLED 

1507
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,543
UP IN THIS INSTANT. 

1508
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,911
I AM SURE THEY WILL CARRY ON 

1509
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:12,916
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. 

1510
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:13,917
>> MARTIN, WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT 

1511
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:14,651
THE TRAINING, THE PRACTICING, 

1512
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:15,351
THE REHEARSALS THAT WOULD HAVE 

1513
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:17,087
TAKEN PLACE. 

1514
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,422
HOW IMPORTANT IS A DIVING PLAN 

1515
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:24,127
IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS? 

1516
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,128
>> Reporter: I AM SURE THAT 

1517
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:25,962
EVERYONE OUT THERE HAS BEEN 

1518
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,664
FORMULATING THIS PLAN FOR MANY 

1519
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:27,864
DAYS. 

1520
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:31,001
CLEARLY, THE PLAN IS WORKING. 

1521
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:34,871
>> HOW MANY PLANS WOULD THERE 

1522
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:35,272
BE? 

1523
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:36,206
>> Reporter: I'M SURE THERE 

1524
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,573
HAVE BEEN QUITE A NUMBER OF 

1525
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:39,876
PLANS AND THE WEATHER WINDOW, 

1526
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,911
THIS NARROW TIME SLOT THAT WE 

1527
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:48,051
HAVE CONFRONTING THE TEAM, THIS 

1528
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,352
HAS SORT OF PRECIPITATED THE 

1529
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:53,457
ACTION AS WE ALL KNOW. 

1530
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,791
THIS EMERGENCY, THIS NARROW 

1531
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,592
TIME SLOT WILL HAVE BEEN 

1532
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:59,096
PLANNED FOR AND EVERYTHING IS 

1533
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,899
GOING WELL. 

1534
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,267
>> MARTIN, WHEN YOU ARE DOWN 

1535
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,268
THERE, OBVIOUSLY COMMUNICATION 

1536
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:12,242
TACTICS ARE IMPORTANT AMONGST 

1537
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:12,475
ADULTS. 

1538
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:13,477
WHAT SORT OF THINGS WOULD BE 

1539
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,611
USED, AND WHAT WOULD BE USED TO 

1540
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:21,051
COMMUNICATE WITH THE CHILDREN? 

1541
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:21,818
>> Reporter: FORTUNATELY THERE 

1542
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,019
HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF THAI NAVY 

1543
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,522
SEALS GOING TO THE CHAMBER AND 

1544
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,258
I AM QUITE SURE THAT ALL ALONG 

1545
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,861
THE ROUTE THERE WILL BE THAI 

1546
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,731
RESCUE PERSONNEL TO HELP WITH 

1547
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,099
THE COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES 

1548
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:41,338
SHOULD THERE BE TO -- 

1549
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:48,412
COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES. 

1550
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:49,312
>> WE HEARD ABOUT THE 

1551
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:49,912
POSSIBILITY OF SEDATING THE 

1552
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:50,914
BOYS TO CALM THEM DOWN AND 

1553
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,249
AVOID THE PANIC WHICH IS THE 

1554
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,183
GREATEST DANGER IN A RESCUE 

1555
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,718
SUCH AS THIS, IS SEDATION 

1556
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,286
REALLY A POSSIBILITY? WHAT ARE 

1557
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:58,421
THE RISKS INVOLVED IN SOMETHING 

1558
00:50:58,421 --> 00:50:59,689
LIKE THAT. 

1559
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,525
>> Reporter: I AM NOT MEDICALLY 

1560
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:04,594
QUALIFIED TO ANSWER THAT, BUT I 

1561
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,229
DO KNOW CERTAINLY THAT SOME OF 

1562
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,533
THE PERSONNEL ON SITE ARE 

1563
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,669
DOCTORS, HIGHLY EXPERIENCED

DOCTORS, HIGHLY EXPERIENCED

CAVE DIVERS, IF THAT OPTION IS 

1566
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:22,011
REQUIRED, I AM SURE THAT THE 

1567
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:25,515
EQUIPMENT, THE KNOWLEDGE, THE 

1568
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,718
EXPERTISE, IS THERE TO GET THE 

1569
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:29,186
JOB DONE. 

1570

00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,390
DIVING WITH AN EXPERT COLLIE, 

1572
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,158
FAIR ENOUGH, IF YOU ARE DIVING 

1573
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,761
WITH SOMEONE THAT IS 

1574
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,495
INEXPERIENCED, WHAT SORT OF 

1575
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:42,999
ADVICE DO YOU GIVE TO THEM 

1576
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:43,934
BEFORE ENTERING A SYSTEM LIKE 

1577
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,903
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DIVE 

1578
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,539
CONTINUES SAFELY? 

1579
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:50,473
>> Reporter: ONCE THEY ARE 

1580
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:51,975
UNDER THE WATER, THEY WILL 

1581
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:58,048
EITHER BE, WELL, IT WILL BE 

1582
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:58,648
DIFFICULT UNDER THE WATER 

1583
00:51:58,648 --> 00:51:59,649
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN THE 

1584
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:00,082
SITUATION YOURSELF. 

1585
00:52:00,082 --> 00:52:06,423
VISIBILITY WILL BE LOW. 

1586
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,459
WE ALL HOPE THAT NO PANIC WILL 

1587
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,996
ARISE. 

1588
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,164
JUDGING BY WHAT WE SEE OF THESE 

1589
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,700
YOUNGSTERS, I AM VERY OFF THE 

1590
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,001
MYSTIC, THEY ARE BEING 

1591
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:22,572
PARTICULARLY BRAVE. THEY ARE A 

1592
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:23,940
CREDIT TO THAILAND. 

1593
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,175
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY GREAT YOUNG 

1594
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:29,679
PEOPLE. I AM CONFIDENT THAT 

1595
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,950
THEY CAN HOLD THIS TOGETHER. 

1596
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,351
>> SOME NEWS COMING IN FROM THE 

1597
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:39,022
AFP NEWS AGENCY THAT THE 

1598
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:39,889
OPERATION HAS PAUSED FOR THE 

1599
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:41,424
NIGHT UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING. 

1600
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,626
THEY SAY THEY NEED 10 HOURS TO 

1601
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:47,030
PREPARE FOR THE NEXT MISSION. 

1602
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,831

THAILAND. 

1605
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,672
HE SAYS THAT FOUR BOYS ARE OUT, 

1606
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,339
AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING. 

1607
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,040
NINE, INCLUDING THE COACH 

1608
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,907
REMAIN IN THE ORIGINAL LOCATION

1609
00:52:57,907 --> 00:52:58,908
ANDIT COULD TAKE ANOTHER DAY 

1610
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:05,081
TO GET THEM OUT. 

1611
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:05,982
THESE ARE PICTURES FROM THE 

1612
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:06,883
HOSPITAL, WE DID HEAR FROM NICK 

1613
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:07,717
BEEK AT THE HOSPITAL EARLIER. 

1614
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:08,818
FROM THAT SAME PRESS CONFERENCE 

1615
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:09,385

1616
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:10,554

1617
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:14,791
CHIEF SAID ALL FOUR ARE IN 

1618
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:15,224
PERFECT CONDITION. 

1619
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:16,126
THIS HAS NOT BEEN VERIFIED BY 

1620
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,362
MEDICAL OFFICIALS OR OUR 

1621
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,130
CORRESPONDENT ON THE GROUND BUT 

1622
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,665
THAT IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD AT 

1623
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:22,198
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 

1624
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,199
KNIGHT HAS OF COURSE FALLEN IN 

1625
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,870
THE STREETS ARE STILL BUSY. 

1626
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,072
I AM SURE NO DOUBT INSIDE THE 

1627
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:29,706
HOSPITAL WALLS, THINGS ARE 

1628
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,807
HECTIC AS THEY ENSURE THAT 

1629
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:35,011
THOSE CHILDREN ARE WELL AND FIT.

1630

>>> CHRIS BOARDMAN FROM THE 

1631
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:42,586
BRITISH CAVING ASSOCIATION SAID 

1632
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,520
THE CHANGING WEATHER FORCED THE 

1633
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,087
OPERATION TO GET UNDERWAY. 

1634
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:45,488
FOR THE MOMENT, THE CONDITIONS 

1635
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,658
HAVE BEEN IDEAL. 

1636
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:49,358
>> THE TIMING IS EFFECTIVELY 

1637
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:50,026
PERFECT, THEY HAVE BEEN 

1638
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,227
DRAINING THE CAVE FOR AS LONG 

1639
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,929
AS THEY HAVE KNOWN THE CHILDREN 

1640
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,631
HAVE BEEN THERE. THEY ARE 

1641
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:59,002
ACUTELY AWARE THAT THE MONSOON 

1642
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,004
RAINS ARE LITERALL GOING TO 

1643
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:01,271
START. 

1644
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,872
THEY HAD TO MOVE RATHER 

1645
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,843
DECISIVELY AND I HAVE SO MUCH 

1646
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:07,544
RESPECT FOR THE RESCUE 

1647
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,411
PERSONNEL AND DIVERS THAT HAVE 

1648
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,580
COME FROM SO MANY NATION, FOR 

1649
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,215
THE THAI NAVY SEALS, AND ALSO 

1650
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,149
THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES TO 

1651
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,018
REALLY HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE 

1652
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,519
MARK HERE. 

1653
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:20,223
WE KNOW THAT THE PERHAPS HAVE 

1654
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:27,597
NOT DIVE THE WHOLE DISTANCE, 

1655
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,431
BECAUSE OF THE DRAINAGE THAT 

1656
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,566
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THEY WERE 

1657
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:30,567
ABLE TO WALK SOME OF THE 

1658
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,035
DISTANCE AND THAT WOULD MAKE 

1659
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:35,739
THIS EASIER. 

1660
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,474
>> HOW SAFE IS CAVE DIVING FOR 

1661
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:45,448
CHILDREN? 

1662
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,582
>> IT IS SIMPLY NOT ALLOWED IN 

1663
00:54:46,582 --> 00:54:47,717
THE UK FOR CHILDREN AT ALL. 

1664
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:48,852
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO GO UNDER 

1665
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,186
THE AGE OF 16 IN A CAVE WITH 

1666
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,221
ANYONE FROM A GROUP, THEY WOULD 

1667
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,055
DEFINITELY SAY, NO, WAIT UNTIL 

1668
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,189
YOU ARE OLDER. 

1669
00:54:53,189 --> 00:55:00,764
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN LEARN TO DIVE 

1670
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,698
IN WARM WATER WHERE IT IS 

1671
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,565
ORDINARY DIVING, NOT IN THE 

1672
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:03,533
CAVES, THEN YOU CAN TAKE THOSE 

1673
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,434
SKILLS UNDERGROUND WHEN YOU ARE 

1674
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:04,667
OLDER. 

1675
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,769
>> YOU OBVIOUSLY WORK WITHIN 

1676
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:10,106
CAVE DIVING, OR THE BRITISH 

1677
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:10,940
CAVING ASSOCIATION RATHER, HOW 

1678
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,978
DO YOU MAKE CAVING SAFE FOR 

1679
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,780
CHILDREN? ARE YOU HEARING 

1680
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,847
MURMURING FROM PARENTS WHO 

1681
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,516
PLANNED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN 

1682
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:23,620
OFF ON A SUMMER HOLIDAY AND NOW 

1683
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,988
THEY ARE SAYING, ACTUALLY, CAN 

1684
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,289
WE HOLD BACK? 

1685
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:30,093
>> Reporter: NOT A WORD, I KNOW 

1686
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:37,700
THAT SOME HAVE BEEN GOING 

1687
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,635
CAVING IN FRANCE, NO ONE HAS 

1688
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,903
ASKED ME ABOUT IT, I'M SURE WE 

1689
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,871
WILL TALK ABOUT IN THE COMING 

1690
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:42,472
WEEKS. 

1691
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:43,606
THIS HAS TO DO WITH PICKING A 

1692
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,441
VENUE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR 

1693
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,642
THE AGE AND EXPERIENCE OF THE 

1694
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,776
CHILDREN AND THAT IS NO 

1695
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,279
CRITICISM AT ALL OF THE 

1696
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:49,713
FOOTBALL COACH. 

1697
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:50,947
HE DID NOT THINK HE WAS GOING 

1698
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,549
CAVING, HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING 

1699
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,784
TO A TOURIST DESTINATION, THE 

1700
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:57,253
SHOW CAVE, SOMETHING THAT MANY 

1701
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:00,223
HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS WOULD DO 

1702
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,224
WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS ON A 

1703
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:01,724
FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS. 

1704
00:56:01,724 --> 00:56:03,893
IT JUST TURNS OUT THAT THIS 

1705
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:07,263
CAVE HAD A BIT OF A BITE, I'M 

1706
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:09,065
QUITE CERTAIN THAT IN THE 

1707
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:09,932
FUTURE THERE WILL BE THOUGHT 

1708
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:13,503
GIVEN TO SOME REGULATION AND 

1709
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:17,207
PLANNING.  

1710
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,475
>> LET'S REMIND YOU OF WHERE WE 

1711
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,476
ARE WITH THE BREAKING NEWS, THE 

1712
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,176
MISSION TO RESCUE THESE BOYS 

1713
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:20,877
STARTED EARLIER THIS MORNING 

1714
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,881
AROUND 3 AM UK TIME, 10 AM 

1715
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:25,882
LOCAL TIME THERE ON A SUNDAY. 

1716
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:29,385
AT LEAST FOUR BOYS WE KNOW ARE 

1717
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,353
TOLD TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH 

1718
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,055
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST PRESS 

1719
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,122
CONFERENCE THAT WE HEARD FROM 

1720
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:33,389
EARLIER. 

1721
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:42,866
THE REST REMAIN TRAPPED IN THE 

1722
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:43,466
ORIGINAL LOCATION WHERE THEY 

1723
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,334
WERE FOUND EARLIER THIS WEEK. 

1724
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,168
THEY WERE TRAPPED BY MONSOON 

1725
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:48,204
FLOODS FOR OVER TWO WEEKS AND 

1726
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,439
THE OPERATION IS SAID TO BE A 

1727
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:49,939
RACE AGAINST TIME. 

1728
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:50,907
THERE IS A HOSPITAL PICTURE 

1729
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,875
WHERE THE BOYS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 

1730
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,309
AND ARE TREATED BY LOCAL 

1731
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:54,644
DOCTORS. 

1732
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:58,915
>> EARLIER MY COLLEAGUE SPOKE 

1733
00:56:58,915 --> 00:56:59,882
WITH A LIEUTENANT COLONEL WHO 

1734
00:56:59,882 --> 00:57:00,850
WAS PART OF A 2004 RESCUE 

1735
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,385
MISSION IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S 

1736
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:07,023
BIGGEST CAVE SYSTEMS IN MEXICO 

1737
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,858
CITY.  

1738
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,259
>> IT IS GOOD NEWS THAT WE ARE 

1739
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:11,261
SEEING PEOPLE COME OUT OF THE 

1740
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,495
CAVE, BUT IT IS NOT OVER UNTIL 

1741
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:12,996
IT IS OVER. 

1742
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:14,931
YOU GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF 

1743
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,835
SEEING SUCCESS, THE RESCUE IS 

1744
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:19,869
NOT OVER UNTIL EVERYONE IS OUT, 

1745
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:20,470
INCLUDING THE RESCUERS. 

1746
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:27,210
THERE IS A WAY -- A WAYS TO GO 

1747
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,611
BUT IT IS GOOD NEWS THAT WE ARE 

1748
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,512
SEEING PEOPLE GO THROUGH THESE 

1749
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,914
DIFFICULT PASSAGES AND GET OUT. 

1750
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:35,919
I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE TO BE 

1751
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:36,786
CAREFUL, THERE IS STILL AN 

1752
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,787
AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED 

1753
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,122
TO COME OUT OF THE CAVE AND WE 

1754
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,223
STILL HAVE YET TO SEE THE 

1755
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,591
REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE TEAM 

1756
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,460
COME THROUGH.  

1757
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,662
>> YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF THE 

1758
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,829
RESCUE TEAM AS I SAID EARLIER 

1759
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:48,064
THAT TOOK PLACE IN MEXICO CITY. 

1760
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:51,868
HOW CLOSELY DOES THAT EVENT 

1761
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:54,971
RESEMBLE WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN 

1762
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,440
THAILAND? 

1763
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,641
>> IN SOME WAYS IT IS VERY 

1764
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,076
SIMILAR, WE RESCUED A GROUP OF 

1765
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:01,477
SIX CAVERS FROM A SIMILAR 

1766
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:10,620
SITUATION. THE BIG DIFFERENCE 

1767
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,821
WAS THAT IT WAS PART OF A 

1768
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,221
CONTINGENCY PLAN. 

1769
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:13,323
ALTHOUGH IT WAS A RESCUE, WE 

1770
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,023
WERE AWARE THAT THE CAVE 

1771
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,625
FLOODED, WE HAD A DAY TO BE IN 

1772
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,759
THAT CAVE BEFORE WE WENT IN 

1773
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:16,992
THERE. 

1774
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:21,264
WE KNEW THAT IT HAD FLOODED TO 

1775
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,799
A ROOF SO WE HAD A CAMP SET UP 

1776
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:23,465
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. 

1777
00:58:23,465 --> 00:58:25,001
WE HAD LINES LAID TO ALLOW 

1778
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,336
THOSE PEOPLE TO COME OUT 

1779
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,940
THROUGH THAT CAVE. 

1780
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,475
WE ALSO HAD RICK AND ANOTHER 

1781
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,745
DIVER ON STANDBY IN THE UK 

1782
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:36,178
SHOULD THAT HAPPEN. 

1783
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:36,980
THE DIFFERENCE WAS, WE WERE 

1784
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,348
MORE PREPARED BECAUSE WE KNEW 

1785
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,919
THAT PARTICULAR CAVE FLOODED.  

1786
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,821
>> THERE ARE SO MANY TEAMS FROM 

1787
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,023
AROUND THE WORLD INVOLVED IN 

1788
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,525
THIS, IN TERMS OF CAVE DIVING, 

1789
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:52,562
WHERE DO YOU GO FIRST FOR 

1790
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:57,667
EXPERTISE? 

1791
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:58,535
>> THE OBVIOUS ANSWER FOR ME 

1792
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,035
WAS RICK STANTON. 

1793
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,771
WE KNEW THAT NEARLY 14 YEARS AGO

1794
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,774
. THE SITUATION HAS NOT REALLY 

1795
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:05,275
CHANGED. 

1796
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,242
THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD CAVE 

1797
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,377
DRIVERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, 

1798
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,944
BUT IT IS A CLOSE KNIT 

1799
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:15,251
COMMUNITY. 

1800
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,286
AND IS THERE A NUMBER TO DIAL 

1801
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,720
FOR A CAVE DIVE RESCUE? 

1802
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:22,292
PROBABLY NOT, IT IS AN 

1803
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:22,759
INTERESTING THOUGHT. 

1804
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:23,826
IF YOU ARE CAVING AT THE LEVEL 

1805
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:24,661
THAT WE CERTAINLY WERE IN 

1806
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,930
MEXICO, THERE WERE ENOUGH 

1807
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,798
MEMBERS OF MY TEAM THAT 

1808
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:30,400
UNDERSTOOD HUTU RING AND WE HAD 

1809
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,467
ARRANGED THAT BEFOREHAND.  

1810
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,469
>> WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT A 

1811
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,805
DIVING PLAN, WHAT IS INVOLVED 

1812
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:37,573
IN ONE OF THOSE, CAN YOU TAKE 

1813
00:59:37,573 --> 00:59:38,608
US THROUGH? 

1814
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,844
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO KNOW 

1815
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,313
THE CAVE IN DETAIL AND RICK 

1816
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,714
WOULD'VE DONE THAT WHEN HE 

1817
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:49,919
MOVED IN TO FIND THE MEMBERS OF 

1818
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:50,953
THE TEAM, YOU WOULD NEED TO 

1819
00:59:50,953 --> 00:59:53,790
FIND OUT HOW LONG YOU WERE 

1820
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,724
SUBMERGED, HOW COMPLEX THE 

1821
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,826
SYSTEM IS, AND WE HAVE SEEN A 

1822
00:59:56,826 --> 01:00:01,764
LOT OF INFORMATION ON HOW TIGHT 

1823
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:02,465
AND DIFFICULT IT WAS. 

1824
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,833
THAT WOULD BE A BIG PART OF THE 

1825
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:04,967
PLAN, CAN YOU MOVE PEOPLE IN? 

1826
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:05,902
THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS 

1827
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,438
THE SAFETY OF THE RESCUER. 

1828
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,106
IF YOU ARE MOVING SOMEONE 

1829
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:14,010
THROUGH AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT

1830
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,644
AND THEY ARE NOT USED TO IT, IT 

1831
01:00:15,644 --> 01:00:19,182
IS AS DANGEROUS FOR THE RESCUER 

1832
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,316
AS IT IS FOR THE PERSON BEING 

1833
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:21,117
RESCUED, PARTICULARLY IF THAT 

1834
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,120
PERSON STARTS TO PANIC AND 

1835
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,954
LOSES THE LINE, OR EVEN WORSE, 

1836
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,355
GETS EVERYONE DISORIENTED. ALL 

1837
01:00:26,355 --> 01:00:30,126
OF THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED. 

1838
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,027
YOU NEED TO TRAIN FOR. 

1839
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:36,599
WE TRAINED ON THE FAR SIDE. I 

1840
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,500
HAD NOT TRAINED MEMBERS OF THE 

1841
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,302
TEAM BEFORE WE WENT TO MEXICO. 

1842
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,103
BUT BEFORE WE DIVE THEM 

1843
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,872
THROUGH, WE TRAINED THEM IN THE 

1844
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:47,810
CAVE, IN WATER, TO MAKE SURE 

1845
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,677
THAT WE UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY 

1846
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:49,779
WOULD REACT BEFORE WE EVEN 

1847
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:50,813
CONSIDERED BRINGING THEM OUT 

1848
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:56,285
USING DIVING. 

1849
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:57,453
>> STEVE, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 

1850
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:58,388
QUICKLY, AND OUR VIEWERS, WE 

1851
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,823
ARE LOOKING AT THE SCENE NOW OF 

1852
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,191
RESCUERS WITH LIT HELMETS 

1853
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:05,361
WALKING AWAY AND AROUND THE SITE

1854
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:07,764
ITSELF. A FEW MINUTES AGO WE 

1855
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:12,602
SAW A NUMBER OF AMBULANCES 

1856
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:12,835
MOVING. 

1857
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,370
AS FAR AS THE RESCUERS, WHAT 

1858
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,973
ARE THEY CARRYING? 

1859
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:17,807
THEY HAVE BAGS, RED SWEATSHIRTS 

1860
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:18,341
ON AS WELL. 

1861
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,942
SOME OF THEM HAVE TORCHES ON. 

1862
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,577
JUST GOING BACK AGAIN TO WHAT 

1863
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:25,448
YOU HAVE SAID ABOUT TRAINING 

1864
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,550
CHILDREN WERE PEOPLE BEFORE 

1865
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,251
BRINGING THEM THROUGH AND 

1866
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,185
COMPLETING THAT RESCUE, WHAT 

1867
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,055
EXACTLY DO YOU LOOK FOR? HOW ON 

1868
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:36,459
EARTH DO YOU BEGIN A CRASS -- 

1869
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:39,862
CRASH COURSE IN CAVE DIVING IN 

1870
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:45,067
AN EMERGENCY SITUATION? 

1871
01:01:45,067 --> 01:01:46,502
>> YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE 

1872
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,303
GEAR THEY WILL BE MOVING 

1873
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,805
THROUGH THE CAVE THROUGH, YOU 

1874
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:54,143
FIND A SAFE PIECE OF WATER THAT 

1875
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:54,977
IS NOT SUBMERGED, OR NOT 

1876
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:55,945
COVERED BY A CAVE PASSAGE 

1877
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,046
ABOVE, AND THEN YOU PUT THEM 

1878
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:57,880
UNDERWATER AND SEE HOW THEY 

1879
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,113
REACT. 

1880
01:01:58,113 --> 01:01:58,680
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE HAD 

1881
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,650
PLANNED IN MEXICO, WE HAD A 

1882
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,750
DIVE LINE LAID ACROSS THE BASE 

1883
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,251
OF THE CAVE. 

1884
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,954
EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE DID IS PUT 

1885
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:09,058
A LOT OF WAVE -- WAIT ON THEM, 

1886
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,092
THEY DID NOT SWIM, THEY CRAWLED 

1887
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:12,662
AND FOLLOWED THE ROPE OUT. 

1888
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,197
THEY MAY WELL HAVE USED THE 

1889
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:20,970
SAME METHOD. THE MOMENT THAT 

1890
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:21,738
YOU MAKE THEM NEUTRALLY 

1891
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:22,471
BUOYANT, MEANING THEY CAN 

1892
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:23,272
FLOAT, THEY ARE MORE DIFFICULT 

1893
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:23,873
TO MANAGE. 

1894
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:24,907
YOU MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT ON THE 

1895
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,141
FAR SIDE WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN 

1896
01:02:26,141 --> 01:02:27,210
THE EQUIPMENT AND SEE HOW THEY 

1897
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,279
PERFORM IN THAT WATER. 

1898
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:34,050
THEN THEY ARE NOT DIVING 

1899
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,284
STRAIGHT INTO THE UNKNOWN, THEY 

1900
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:38,187
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON AND 

1901
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,322
THEY SEE THAT THEY CAN BE 

1902
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,723
LOOKED AFTER AND THEN YOU 

1903
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:41,791
REASSURE THEM WITH YOUR 

1904
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:42,425
PRESENCE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT 

1905
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:42,992
SPEAK TO PEOPLE. 

1906
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:47,029
THEY GET TO KNOW THAT IT IS 

1907
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,630
ACTUALLY OKAY. 

1908
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,798
ONCE YOU HAVE THEIR TRUST YOU 

1909
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:55,838
CAN BRING THEM OUT. 

1910
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:56,739
IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT.  

1911
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:57,573
>> YES, SPEAKING ABOUT TRUST, 

1912
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:58,440
HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH 

1913
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,175
SOMEONE WHO IS INEXPERIENCED 

1914
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,042
ONCE THE DIVE IS UNDERWAY? 

1915
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,144
>> YOU CAN'T, YOU JUST HAVE TO 

1916
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:03,446
BE PRESENT. YOU HAVE TO KEEP 

1917
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:07,216
YOUR HAND ON THEIR ARM OR HAND, 

1918
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:08,250
THEY HAVE TO FEEL YOU BECAUSE 

1919
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:12,255
THEY CANNOT FEEL YOU IN THAT -- 

1920
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,322
SEE YOU IN THAT MUDDY WATER. 

1921
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,924
THEY MUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE 

1922
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,426
THERE AND THEY MUST TRUST YOU. 

1923
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:18,327
TO DEVELOP THAT TRUST IS 

1924
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,364
DIFFICULT IN THAT SHORT PERIOD 

1925
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,632
OF TIME. BUT A SHORT DIVE IN 

1926
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,366
PREPARATION BEFORE THEY ARE PUT 

1927
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:27,003
INTO HARMS WAY MADE A BIG 

1928
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:27,503
DIFFERENCE FOR US. 

1929
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:28,504
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THEY 

1930
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:30,873
HAVE FOLLOWED A SIMILAR SORT OF 

1931
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:36,111
PASS. 

1932
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:37,313
>> ONCE YOU HAVE THE PERSON OUT 

1933
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,180
OF THE CAVE, OBVIOUSLY THESE 

1934
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,315
BOYS HAVE BEEN IN THERE FOR 

1935
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,049
NEARLY A FORTNIGHT, THERE WILL 

1936
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,017
BE SOME LIGHT SENSITIVITY, FOR 

1937
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:41,584
EXAMPLE, IN THEIR EYES. 

1938
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,553
WHAT SORT OF MEDICAL PLANS ARE 

1939
01:03:44,553 --> 01:03:44,886
PUT IN PLACE? 

1940
01:03:44,886 --> 01:03:49,158
WHAT DID YOU DO IN MEXICO? 

1941
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,659
>> WELL, THE HUMAN BODY ADAPTS 

1942
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:51,727
QUICKLY. 

1943
01:03:51,727 --> 01:04:02,038
ACTUALLY, THE BIGGEST SHOCK THAT

1944
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:03,272
THE PEOPLE IN OUR PARTY HAD 

1945
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:04,307
WHEN THEY CAME OUT WAS THE 

1946
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:04,774
LEVEL OF INTEREST. 

1947
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:05,640
THE WORLD'S LEVEL OF INTEREST 

1948
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,642
IN WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. 

1949
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:07,710
IT WAS NOT MEDICAL, IT WAS 

1950
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,544
PSYCHOLOGICAL TO KNOW THAT IN 

1951
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,479
OUR CASE THEY WERE ON THE NEWS 

1952
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,448
EVERY DAY FOR 10 DAYS IN THE 

1953
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,951
WESTERN WORLD. 

1954
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:16,385
THAT WAS A BIG THING, THEY WERE 

1955
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,787
SAYING, WHAT IS THE FUSS ABOUT? 

1956
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,790
THIS IS A PLAN WE HAD ALREADY 

1957
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:21,323
ENACTED. 

1958
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:22,325
I SUSPECT THAT THE MEMBERS OF 

1959
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,426
THE FOOTBALL TEAM WILL FEEL THE 

1960
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:28,764
SAME, IT IS LIKE, WOW!, THEY 

1961
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:29,632
WILL BE AMAZED THAT THERE WERE 

1962
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:30,933
SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED AND 

1963
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,034
THEY WILL BE AMAZED AT THE 

1964
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,003
MILITARY AND THAT ALL OF THOSE 

1965
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,771
PEOPLE ARE AROUND THE CAVE OR 

1966
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:38,607
IN THE VICINITY. 

1967
01:04:38,607 --> 01:04:39,742
REGARDING THE MEDICAL, IT IS 

1968
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:42,444
JUST A CHAPTER -- CHECKUP, YOU 

1969
01:04:42,444 --> 01:04:44,280
NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE FIT 

1970
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,916
AND HEALTHY AND THEY ARE YOUNG 

1971
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:47,616
BOYS, FOOTBALLERS, REASONABLY 

1972
01:04:47,616 --> 01:04:50,619
FIT, THEY PROBABLY NEED A GOOD 

1973
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:54,256
MEAL AND SOME GOOD WATER AND 

1974
01:04:54,256 --> 01:04:55,558
REHYDRATION. THEN THEY WILL BE 

1975
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,427
RIGHT AS RAIN. 

1976
01:04:58,427 --> 01:04:59,094
PSYCHOLOGICALLY, IT WILL BE 

1977
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:01,530
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY COPE

1978
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:02,565
WHEN THEY REALIZE HOW MUCH 

1979
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,599
INTEREST THE WORLD HAS HAD IN 

1980
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,003
THEIR SITUATION.  

1981
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:11,574
>> WOULD SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN 

1982
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,208
RESCUED UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS 

1983
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:12,808
NORMALLY HAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL 

1984
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,977
HEALTH IN PLACE, IS THAT 

1985
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:15,444
ADVISABLE? 

1986
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:16,345
>> I DON'T KNOW, PARTICULARLY 

1987
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,513
WITH THE AGE OF THE YOUNGSTERS 

1988
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:17,780
INVOLVED. 

1989
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,848
IT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL 

1990
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:23,019
HAVE TO LOOK AT. 

1991
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,287
OBVIOUSLY, THEY MIGHT HAVE 

1992
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:25,821
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH 

1993
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,457
CONFINED SPACES OR WATER. 

1994
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,526
IF THIS IS DONE WITH A POSITIVE 

1995
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:34,897
WAY, IF THEY GOT OUT AND IT HAS 

1996
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,600
NOT LED TO ANY TRAUMA, THEN 

1997
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,500
THEY PROBABLY WILL GET OVER 

1998
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,368
THIS QUITE QUICKLY, MOST YOUNG 

1999
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,036
PEOPLE ARE PRETTY RESILIENT. 

2000
01:05:41,036 --> 01:05:42,071
I SHOULD NOT THINK THERE WOULD 

2001
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,640
BE ANY LONG-TERM EFFECTS.  

2002
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,008
>> JUST TO GO BACK AGAIN 

2003
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:46,875
QUICKLY, YOU MENTIONED SOME OF 

2004
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,477
THE TRAINING THAT TOOK PLACE 

2005
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:51,647
AND THE EQUIPMENT. 

2006
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:52,448
HOW HEAVY IS THAT EQUIPMENT? 

2007
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,651
WOULD THE BOYS HAVE BEEN DRESSED

2008
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,953
IN PROPER WETSUITS? 

2009
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,455
WOULD THEY NEED THAT DUE TO THE 

2010
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,457
WATER, OR IS THE WATER WARM IN 

2011
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,093
THE CAVES? 

2012
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,327
>> I DO NOT KNOW THE ACTUAL 

2013
01:06:05,327 --> 01:06:06,128
TEMPERATURE, BUT YOU WILL FIND 

2014
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,764
THAT THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF 

2015
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:10,199
THE CAVE AND PROBABLY THE WATER 

2016
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:18,007
ASSOCIATED IS THE AVERAGE 

2017
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:18,841
TEMPERATURE OF THE COUNTRY THAT 

2018
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:19,408
YOU ARE IN. 

2019
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,209
BEING IN THAILAND, I WOULD 

2020
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:20,909
IMAGINE THE WATER WOULD 

2021
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:22,178
PROBABLY BE IN THE EARLY 20s, 

2022
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,045
21 OR 22 DEGREES CELSIUS. 

2023
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,080
YOU CAN DO PRETTY WELL WITHOUT 

2024
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,348
A WETSUIT IN THAT TEMPERATURE. 

2025
01:06:26,348 --> 01:06:29,018
THE EQUIPMENT IS FAIRLY HEAVY, 

2026
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,686
BUT I AM SURE THAT THEY MANAGED 

2027
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:35,024
THAT IN A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT 

2028
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:37,126
THOSE YOUNGSTERS MAY NOT HAVE 

2029
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:37,626
CARRIED THAT EQUIPMENT 

2030
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:40,196
THEMSELVES, OR IF THEY DID, IT 

2031
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:41,497
WOULD BE SOMETHING THEY COULD 

2032
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,064
MANAGE. 

2033
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:46,235
AS I SAY, IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS IN 

2034
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:47,036
THAT SITUATION THAT PEOPLE DO 

2035
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:48,904
NOT ACTUALLY SWIM. 

2036
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:53,743
IF THEY DO SWIM, THEY GET LOST, 

2037
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,111
IF THEY ARE HEAVY, YOU CAN 

2038
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,912
PLACE THEM ON THE FLOOR AND THE 

2039
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,047
DIVER KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE AND 

2040
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:58,948
THE RESCUE DIVER CAN MOVE 

2041
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:03,552
AROUND THEM AND THEY CANNOT 

2042
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:04,086
EASILY MOVE AWAY. 

2043
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:05,087
THAT IS A REAL ADVANTAGE, THEN 

2044
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,122
YOU KNOW WHERE THE DIVERS ARE 

2045
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:14,563
AND WHAT THEY ARE UP TO. 

2046
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:15,531
>> WE WILL BRING SOME MORE 

2047
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,431
LINES FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE 

2048
01:07:16,431 --> 01:07:18,033
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER, THAT 

2049
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:19,768
WAS FROM THE THAI HEAD OF THE 

2050
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:21,504
RESCUE OPERATION. 

2051
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:22,438
HE SAID THAT THE RESCUE WORKERS 

2052
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:26,275
NEED ABOUT 10 HOURS TO PREPARE 

2053
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:34,917
FOR THE OPERATION. 

2054
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,619
THEY WERE RESCUED FROM THE CAVE 

2055
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:41,690
AND TRANSFERRED BY HELICOPTER 

2056
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:42,558
TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL, THAT 

2057
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,226
IS WHERE WE HEARD FROM NICK 

2058
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:44,426
BEEK. 

2059
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:45,895
DAN JOHNSON IS AT THE MOUTH OF 

2060
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,864
THE CAVE AND GAVE US THIS UPDATE

2061
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:49,198
.  

2062
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:53,268
>> THIS IS FALLING QUIET IN THE 

2063
01:07:53,268 --> 01:07:54,436
AREA AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 

2064
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:55,437
OF ACTIVITY IN THE LAST FEW 

2065
01:07:55,437 --> 01:07:55,704
MINUTES. 

2066
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:56,438
IT LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE ARE 

2067
01:07:56,438 --> 01:08:00,576
LEAVING THE SITE AND WE JUST 

2068
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,444
RECEIVED CONFIRMATION FROM THE 

2069
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,178
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT FOUR OF 

2070
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,747
THE BOYS HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM 

2071
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,014
THE CAVE AND THAT THE OPERATION 

2072
01:08:06,014 --> 01:08:08,684
HAS CONCLUDED FOR THE NIGHT. 

2073
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:09,718
THEY WILL LEAVE THE REST WHERE 

2074
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:10,586
THEY ARE, WE UNDERSTAND THAT 

2075
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,154
OTHERS HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED 

2076
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:15,757
THE JOURNEY OUT. 

2077
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:16,992
THEY WANTED TO TAKE A GROUP OF 

2078
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,127
FOUR FIRST TO SEE IF THEY COULD 

2079
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:18,861
SAFELY MAKE IT OUT. 

2080
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:19,862
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE 

2081
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:20,229
ACHIEVED THAT. 

2082
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:23,665
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE FEAT GIVING 

2083
01:08:23,665 --> 01:08:25,033
EVERYONE A POSITIVE FEEL THAT 

2084
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:28,871
THEY CAN GIVE AND GET EVERYONE 

2085
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:29,470
OUT SAFELY. 

2086
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,872
ONE THING TO BEAR IN MIND IS 

2087
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:32,041
THE TIREDNESS LEVELS OF THOSE 

2088
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,542
LEADING THE INVESTIGATION. THEY 

2089
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:35,477
HAVE BEEN WORKING BUSILY ALL 

2090
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:37,580
DAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE ARE 

2091
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:43,018
THE DIVE TEAMS LEAVING THE SITE 

2092
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:48,590
RIGHT NOW. 

2093
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:49,425
THERE WERE 18 SPECIALIST DIVERS 

2094
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:50,326
THAT HAVE BEEN GUIDING THESE 

2095
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:50,626
BOYS OUT. 

2096
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,694
AS YOU HEARD, IT TAKES MANY 

2097
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:52,861
HOURS TO GET ONE BOY TO THE 

2098
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:53,562
EXIT OF THE CAVE. 

2099
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:54,596
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE TAKEN 

2100
01:08:54,596 --> 01:08:55,464
THE DECISION THAT THEY HAVE 

2101
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,999
DONE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN FOR 

2102
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:57,866
TODAY AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO 

2103
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,033
REST SO THEY ARE NOT DOING THE 

2104
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:02,571
JOB WHEN THEY ARE TOO TIRED. 

2105
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:03,606
THEY WILL COME BACK FRESH IN 

2106
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,573
THE MORNING TO START AROUND 8 AM

2107
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:06,575
. BUT EVERYONE IS POSITIVE THAT 

2108
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:07,443
THEY HAVE PROVEN THIS RESCUE 

2109
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:10,645
METHOD CAN WORK AND THEY CAN 

2110
01:09:10,645 --> 01:09:12,481
TEACH THESE BOYS ENOUGH ABOUT 

2111
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,682
SCUBA DIVING SO THEY ARE 

2112
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:18,353
COMFORTABLE WITH THE CONDITIONS 

2113
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:19,587
AND THE TASK THAT THEY HAVE TO 

2114
01:09:19,587 --> 01:09:20,421
COMPLETE AND THE TRACKS THAT 

2115
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:24,158
THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH 

2116
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:24,826
THE FLOODED UNDERWATER CAVERNS. 

2117
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:26,929
A TRICKY THING FOR ANY CAVE 

2118
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,331
DIVER TO ACCOMPLISH. 

2119
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,733
IT DOES LOOK LIKE AT LEAST FOUR 

2120
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:31,700
OF THE BOYS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

2121
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,734
MAKE IT SO FAR AND THE 

2122
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:34,870
EXPECTATION IS THAT MORE WILL 

2123
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,506
FOLLOW TOMORROW.  

2124
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,741
>> IT LOOKS LIKE A HIVE OF 

2125
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:39,575
ACTIVITY BEHIND YOU, CAN YOU 

2126
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:40,776
GIVE US A TASTE OF WHAT IS 

2127
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:41,577
GOING ON? 

2128
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,479
>> Reporter: THIS VERY MUCH AS 

2129
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,648
THE FEEL OF THINGS WINDING 

2130
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:46,682
DOWN, THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE 

2131
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,716
FOR THE LAST 45 MINUTES WITH A 

2132
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:52,453
FLOOD OF WORKERS THAT HAVE LEFT 

2133
01:09:52,453 --> 01:09:53,255
THE SITE AFTER THE LAST 

2134
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:59,261
AMBULANCE THAT WE SAW. 

2135
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:00,296
IT WAS AROUND TWO HOURS AGO 

2136
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:01,397
THAT WE SAW THE FIRST AMBULANCE 

2137
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:02,398
DRIED OUT, JUST WHERE THAT CAR 

2138
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:03,232
IS LEAVING RIGHT NOW, WITH 

2139
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:03,866
LIGHTS FLASHING, IT HAD 

2140
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,968
PRESUMABLY TO THE HOSPITAL THAT 

2141
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:06,802
YOU HEARD NICK REPORTING FROM. 

2142
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,405
THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER 

2143
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:13,275
THREE NUMB -- THREE AMBULANCES, 

2144
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,443
WE HAVE SEEN THEM LEAVE WITHOUT 

2145
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:15,444
LIGHTS FLASHING SO IT DOES LOOK 

2146
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:16,578
LIKE THE FOUR BOYS WERE TAKEN 

2147
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:18,580
SEPARATELY WITH THE LIGHTS 

2148
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:18,847
FLASHING. 

2149
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,882
OTHER AMBULANCES HAVE LEFT BUT 

2150
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:21,917
THAT COULD BE THEM JUST MOVING 

2151
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:24,053
AWAY FOR THE NIGHT AND THEN 

2152
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:24,686
EVERYONE WILL RETURN TOMORROW 

2153
01:10:24,686 --> 01:10:32,361
MORNING TO RESTART THE RESCUE 

2154
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:32,594
EFFORT. 

2155
01:10:32,594 --> 01:10:33,295
TODAY WAS THE DAY, THE 

2156
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,296
OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR IT AND 

2157
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:35,397
THEY WERE GOING TO TRY THEIR 

2158
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,599
BEST TO PUT THE PLAN INTO 

2159
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:41,203
ACTION. 

2160
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:42,204
THEY HAVE PROVEN THAT IT CAN 

2161
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,205
WORK FOR THE FOUR THAT HAVE 

2162
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:43,872
GOTTEN OUT SO FAR. 

2163
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:44,840
EVERYONE IS AWARE THERE ARE 

2164
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,774
STILL RISKS AND IT WILL BE 

2165
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:46,942
TRICKY GETTING THE REMAINING 

2166
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:49,745
BOYS AND THEIR COACH OUT OF THE 

2167
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:50,612
CAVE TOMORROW, POSSIBLY INTO 

2168
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:54,416
THE DAY AFTER.  

2169
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,351
>> YOU SPEAK ABOUT EXHAUSTION 

2170
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,386
LEVELS, HOW WILL THAT WORK, 

2171
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,888
WILL THERE BE ANOTHER SET OF 

2172
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:04,493
DIVERS GOING INTO THE CAVES? 

2173
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:05,427
>> Reporter: WE BELIEVE IT WILL 

2174
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,762
BE THE SAME CORE TEAM, THE 

2175
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:07,829
EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE 

2176
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:10,999
REQUIRED TO MANAGE THIS IS SO 

2177
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:15,704
LIMITED. 

2178
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:16,538
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAVE 

2179
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:17,273
EXPERIENCED DIVING SO DEEP 

2180
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:21,944
UNDERGROUND IN A CAVE SO BIG. 

2181
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,178
THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX 

2182
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:30,652
NATIONALITIES INVOLVED. THESE 

2183
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:31,720
GUYS HAVE BEEN CALLING THE 

2184
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:41,030
SHOTS AND ASSESSED WHETHER THE 

2185
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,897
BOYS HAVE STARTED MAKING THE 

2186
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:42,698
JOURNEY AND THEY HAVE GUIDED 

2187
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:43,699
THE MISSION TODAY FOR THE FIRST 

2188
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,766
FOUR BOYS TAKING CARE OF THEM 

2189
01:11:44,766 --> 01:11:45,266
THROUGHOUT THE WAY. 

2190
01:11:45,266 --> 01:11:46,335
THEY ARE TAKING THEIR TIME AS 

2191
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:46,535
WELL. 

2192
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:47,702
NO ONE WANTED TO RUSH THIS AND 

2193
01:11:47,702 --> 01:11:49,271
GET THINGS WRONG, IT LOOKS LIKE 

2194
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,073
THEY ARE TAKING A WELL EARNED 

2195
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:52,074
BREAK AND WILL COME BACK FRESH 

2196
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:52,341
TOMORROW. 

2197
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,976
THERE IS A BIG SUPPORT TEAM, 

2198
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,247
LOADS OF SOLDIERS, DIVERS FROM 

2199
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,314
THE THAI NAVY, BUT THE NAVY WAS 

2200
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:00,482
CANDID THAT THEY JUST DID NOT 

2201
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,283
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF WORKING 

2202
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:06,555
IN THESE CONDITIONS SO THEY 

2203
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:07,189
HAVE WELCOMED THE INTERNATIONAL 

2204
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:07,456
SUPPORT. 

2205
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:08,123
THEY HAVE TO USE THAT 

2206
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:08,556
EXPERIENCE WIFELY. 

2207
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:09,625
I THINK THE RATIONALE IS THERE 

2208
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:10,592
IS NO POINT IN TIRING EVERYONE 

2209
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:13,462
OUT AND NO POINT WASTING THE 

2210
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,464
EXPERIENCE AND ENERGY. 

2211
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:16,265
LET EVERYONE TAKE THEIR TIME, 

2212
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:17,299
TAKE THEIRCARE, AND COME BACK 

2213
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:18,000
TOMORRO KNOWING THAT THE 

2214
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,801
RESCUE METHOD CAN SUCCEED IN 

2215
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,269
KNOWING THAT THEY CAN MAKE THAT 

2216
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,271
HAPPEN FOR THE REST OF THE 

2217
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,238
PEOPLE STUCK IN THE CAVE THEY 

2218
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,641
WILL NEED MORE TIME AND RISKS 

2219
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:35,284
ARE INVOLVED, IT IS RAINING SO 

2220
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:36,485
THERE IS A RISK THAT THEY WOULD 

2221
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:37,453
SPEED THINGS UP AND MOVE 

2222
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,921
QUICKLY TO GET PEOPLE OUT AS 

2223
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:40,489
SOON AS POSSIBLE, FOR THE 

2224
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:41,457
MOMENT, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE 

2225
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:42,458
TAKING CARE AND PUTTING THIS 

2226
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:47,029
PLAN INTO OPERATION AND IT IS 

2227
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:47,996
SUCCEEDING.  

2228
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:49,264
>> WE KNOW THAT FOUR OF THE 

2229
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:50,232
BOYS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE 

2230
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,066
HOSPITAL, HOW DID THEY DECIDE 

2231
01:12:51,066 --> 01:13:09,484
WHOM TO BRING OUT FIRST? 

2232
01:13:09,484 --> 01:13:10,319
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE HAD 

2233
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,220
DOCTORS IN THE CAVE THROUGHOUT 

2234
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:11,987
THE WEEKEND ASSESSING THE 

2235
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:12,588
CONDITIONS OF THE BOYS. 

2236
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:13,422
THE CAVE DIVING EXPERTS HAVE 

2237
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:14,122
BEEN ASSESSING THEIR STRENGTH, 

2238
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:14,823
CONFIDENCE, ABILITY WITH THE 

2239
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:15,591
SCUBA DIVING EQUIPMENT, AND 

2240
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:16,258
THEY'VE ALSO HAD MEDICAL 

2241
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:16,891
EXAMINATIONS TO ASSESS THE 

2242
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:18,026
IMPACT OF THIS TWO WEEK ORDEAL, 

2243
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:18,659
TWO WEEKS UNDERGROUND WITHOUT 

2244
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:18,993
PROPER FOOD. 

2245
01:13:18,993 --> 01:13:20,062
THERE WERE NINE OR 10 DAYS 

2246
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:20,695
BEFORE THEY WERE DISCOVERED 

2247
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:21,630
WHERE THEY DIDN'T EAT ANYTHING. 

2248
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,464
THEY HAVE SUFFERED IN OUR 

2249
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,064
WEEKEND, THE OFFICIALS IN 

2250
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:23,898
CHARGE OF THE OPERATION THOUGHT 

2251
01:13:23,898 --> 01:13:25,434
THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN TO A 

2252
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,435
SUFFICIENT POINT TODAY WHERE 

2253
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:33,675
THEY WERE READY TO BE STARTING 

2254
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:34,243
TO MOVE THEM. 

2255
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,244
THEY DID START WITH THE WEEK 

2256
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,578
IS, WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS 

2257
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,579
IN TERMS OF STRENGTH, OR IN 

2258
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,481
TERMS OF GETTING TO GRIPS WITH 

2259
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:40,482
THE SCUBA DIVING TEAM, BUT THEY 

2260
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:41,917
DID START WITH THE WEAKEST BOYS 

2261
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,585
WHO THEY THOUGHT NEEDED TO COME 

2262
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,155
OUT AND THEY PUT A SMALL GROUP 

2263
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:46,955
TOGETHER. 

2264
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,290
WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS A 

2265
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,958
SMALL GROUP THAT CAME OUT EACH 

2266
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,860
TIME AND THEY DID START WITH 

2267
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:55,797
FOUR AND THEY WERE TAKEN BY 

2268
01:13:55,797 --> 01:13:59,001
AMBULANCE AND THERE IS THE 

2269
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,437
OPTION OF HELICOPTERS ON 

2270
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,538
STANDBY AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN OR 

2271
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:03,539
HEARD THEM THIS CLOSE BECAUSE 

2272
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:04,439
THEY HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN 

2273
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:05,807
DISTANCE AWAY TO FIND THE 

2274
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:06,208
FLATLAND. 

2275
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:10,979
THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY QUICKLY 

2276
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,014
TO GET THE TREATMENT AND NO 

2277
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:12,547
DOUBT, THIS WILL TAKE 

2278
01:14:12,547 --> 01:14:13,415
RECOVERING FROM THE INITIAL 

2279
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:17,453
SHOCK AND THE IMPACT AND 

2280
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:17,853
EMOTIONAL EFFECT. 

2281

EVERYONE IS AWARE THAT IF THEY 

2282
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:25,827
ARE ABLE TO LEAVE, THIS IS NOT 

2283
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:27,029
THE END, THERE WILL BE LOTS OF 

2284
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,030
WORK TO DO AFTERWARDS FOR THESE 

2285
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,064

2357
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:44,032
BEST OUTCOME, IF THE BOYS ARE 

2358
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,066
ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THE CAVES, 

2359
01:16:45,066 --> 01:16:45,700
WALK PART OF THE WAY, AND THEN 

2360
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,270
ESSENTIALLY BE BROUGHT HERE. 

2361
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,105
CLEARLY, IF THEY ARE IN MORE 

2362
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:50,906
DIFFICULTY, IF THEIR CONDITION 

2363
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,140
IS WEAKER, THE MANY SPECIALISTS 

2364
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,976
THAT THEY HAVE HERE WILL HAVE A 

2365
01:16:54,976 --> 01:16:57,245
TOUGHER JOB. IN TERMS OF ANY 

2366
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,713
TREATMENT GOING ON, THAT IS NOT 

2367
01:16:58,713 --> 01:17:02,684
CLEAR.  

2368
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,186
>> CERTAINLY REASSURING THAT 

2369
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:04,919
THEY HAVE MADE THEIR WAY TO THE 

2370
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:05,186
HOSPITAL. 

2371
01:17:05,186 --> 01:17:05,787
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE DEGREE 

2372
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,056
OF RELIEF ON BEHALF OF THE 

2373
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:12,094
FAMILIES, IS THERE ANY WORD 

2374
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:12,527
FROM THEM? 

2375
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:13,828
>> Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW IF 

2376
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:14,929
THEY ARE HERE, CERTAINLY FOR 

2377
01:17:14,929 --> 01:17:18,500
THE PAST TWO WEEKS WE HAVE SEEN 

2378
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,668
THEM IN DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND 

2379
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:20,936
THE CAVE COMPLEX, THEY HAVE 

2380
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:22,204
BEEN IN THEIR OWN TUCKED AWAY 

2381
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:23,205
AREA AND KEPT UP-TO-DATE WITH 

2382
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:26,808
THE LATEST INFORMATION. THEY 

2383
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:27,876
WOULD'VE BEEN THE FIRST TO KNOW 

2384
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:28,510
AND WOULD'VE BEEN GIVEN ALL OF 

2385
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,445
THE UPDATES FROM THE DIVERS AND 

2386
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:31,045
RESCUE TEAMS AS THEY STARTED 

2387
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:31,679
THIS OPERATION AND DECIDED TO 

2388
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:35,217
CONTINUE WITH IT. 

2389
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,151
IT MAY BE THAT FAMILY MEMBERS 

2390
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:36,785
ARE INSIDE NOW. 

2391
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,253
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE 

2392
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:41,590
OR WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE 

2393
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,791
TO SEE THEIR LOVED ONES YET. 

2394
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,926
CLEARLY, A DREADFUL ORDEAL, TWO 

2395
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:45,861
WEEKS NOW THEY HAVE BEEN HAVING 

2396
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,562
TO COPE WITH THIS. 

2397
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:48,930
FIRST, THERE WAS THE DREADFUL 

2398
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,999
SENSATION OF NOT KNOWING WHAT 

2399
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,135
HAD HAPPENED, FOR NINE DAYS THE 

2400
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:55,270
BOYS WERE TRAPPED AND FINALLY 

2401
01:17:55,270 --> 01:18:05,113
THE TWO BRITISH AMATEUR DIVERS 

2402
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,248
WERE ABLE TO LOCATE THEM AND 

2403
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:06,982
THEN BASICALLY TELL THE WORLD 

2404
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:07,916
THAT THEY HAD BEEN FOUND. 

2405
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:08,884
IN TERMS OF THE REACTION FROM 

2406
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:09,918
THE FAMILIES, WE HAVE NOT SEEN 

2407
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:10,418
THAT REACTION YET. 

2408
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:11,720
THIS IS STILL IN THE EARLY 

2409
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,587
DAYS, ONLY FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN 

2410
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:13,020
BROUGHT TO SAFETY. 

2411
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:13,888
13 WERE IN THE PARTY. 

2412
01:18:13,888 --> 01:18:24,699
CLEARLY A LONG WAY TO GO.  

2413
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:25,634
>> WE ARE WATCHING FOR 

2414
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:26,301
DEVELOPMENTS, TAKING A STEP 

2415
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,068
BACK, THIS REALLY HAS BROUGHT 

2416
01:18:27,068 --> 01:18:27,903
THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, HASN'T 

2417
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:28,603
IT, WE HEAR ARE UTTERLY 

2418
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:29,638
GRIPPED, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW 

2419
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:30,872
EMOTIONALLY CHARGED THINGS ARE 

2420
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:37,445
THERE IN THAILAND? 

2421
01:18:37,445 --> 01:18:38,246
>> Reporter: THAILAND AS A 

2422
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:39,314
NATION HAS BEEN PRAYING FOR THE 

2423
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:40,014
BEST, FEARING THE WORST. 

2424
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:41,016
IF YOU SPEAK WITH THE PEOPLE 

2425
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:42,150
THAT LIVE HERE, THEY ARE AS 

2426
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,452
ONE, THEY ARE SO DETERMINED 

2427
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:45,320
THAT THESE BOYS SHOULD BE 

2428
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:45,587
RESCUED. 

2429
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:46,354
WE MET SOME OF THE WELL-

2430
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:47,021
WISHERS, THE VOLUNTEERS AT THE 

2431
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:47,322
SITES. 

2432
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:48,090
THEY CREATED A COMMUNITY THERE 

2433
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:51,860
OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS AND THE 

2434
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:52,761
SENSE OF OPTIMISM WHEN THEY 

2435
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:53,795
HEARD THAT THE BOYS HAVE BEEN 

2436
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:55,030
LOCATED, THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, 

2437
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,797
THERE WAS AN ENERGY WHICH 

2438
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:56,898
FLOWED THROUGH THE SITE. 

2439
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,101
REALLY, THAT HAS SUSTAINED SO 

2440
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:01,436
MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING 

2441
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:04,072
EXTREMELY LONG SHIFTS. IF YOU 

2442
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:05,440
LOOK IN THE EYES OF SOME OF THE 

2443
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,274
RESCUERS AND DIVERS, THEY WERE 

2444
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,076
SHATTERED AND CONTINUED AND 

2445
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,044
SAID THEY WOULD KEEP GOING FOR 

2446
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:11,446
AS LONG AS IT TAKES. 

2447
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:12,647
CLEARLY, IF WE HAVE NEWS IN THE 

2448
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:15,016
COMING HOURS THAT ALL OF THESE 

2449
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,118
BOYS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE 

2450
01:19:17,118 --> 01:19:17,986
BROUGHT OUT TO SAFETY, THERE 

2451
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:18,687
WILL BE UNDER JUBILATION. 

2452
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,756
WE ARE A LONG WAY TO GO. FOUR 

2453
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:25,193
BOYS SO FAR, 13 IN ALL. 

2454
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:27,028
THIS IS VERY MUCH THE FOCUS FOR 

2455
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,364
THE COMING HOURS. 

2456
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,032
>> I'M ASSUMING THIS WILL GO ON 

2457
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:35,036
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT? 

2458
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:35,637
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY, WE 

2459
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:37,105
JUST HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE 

2460
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:39,407
FROM THE AUTHORITIES AND THEY 

2461
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:40,475
GAVE AN UPDATE ON SOME OF THE 

2462
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:40,908
IMMEDIATE DETAILS. 

2463
01:19:40,908 --> 01:19:42,177
WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

2464
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:44,212
COLLEAGUES AT THE SCENE, AT THE 

2465
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:47,315
CAVE COMPLEX ABOUT ONE HOUR BY 

2466
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:48,416
CAR FROM HERE. 

2467
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,451
THEY HAVE SEEN THE VARIOUS 

2468
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:54,923
AMBULANCES DRIVE PAST AND OUT 

2469
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:57,459
TOWARDS THE MAIN ROAD. 

2470
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,593
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN HELICOPTERS 

2471
01:19:58,593 --> 01:19:59,327
TAKE OFF. 

2472
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:00,962
WE DO EXPECT MORE BOYS TO BE 

2473
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,330
BROUGHT HERE, CERTAINLY WHEN 

2474
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:06,368
MORE BOYS ARE TAKEN OUT THEY 

2475
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:07,135
WILL BE BROUGHT HERE, REMEMBER, 

2476
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:13,041
THIS WILL BE AN EXTREMELY LONG 

2477
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:13,341
OPERATION. 

2478
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:14,276
TO REACH THE BOYS WHERE THEY 

2479
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:15,310
WERE AND BACK AGAIN, THAT HAS 

2480
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,712
TAKEN DIVERS 11 HOURS. 

2481
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:18,580
THIS IS A HUGE JOURNEY. 

2482
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,480
I CAN TELL YOU, DURING THE 

2483
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,683
WEEK, WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO A 

2484
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:24,286
CAVE ABOUT 10 KILOMETERS AWAY 

2485
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,754
FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BOYS 

2486
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:26,087
WERE TRAPPED. 

2487
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:32,727
WE GOT A GLIMPSE OF THAT PLACE 

2488
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,062
AND I CAN TELL YOU, IT WAS 

2489
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:34,863
CLAUSTROPHOBIC, IT WAS HOT, THE 

2490
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:35,397
WATER WAS MURKY. 

2491
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:38,266
IF IT WAS FLOODED, THERE 

2492
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:38,933
WOULD'VE BEEN NO VISIBILITY 

2493
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:39,234
WHATSOEVER. 

2494
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,936
WE DID RECEIVE INFORMATION 

2495
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:42,037
EARLIER FROM THE THAI NAVY 

2496
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:42,304
TEAMS. 

2497
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:43,371
THEY ARE EXPLAINING THAT EACH 

2498
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:47,509
BOY WOULD BE USHERED, OR 

2499
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,377
SHEPHERDED THROUGH BY TWO EXPERT

2500
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:49,811
DIVERS. 

2501
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:53,615
THE BOYS WOULD REALLY FEEL 

2502
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:54,382
THEIR PRESENCE AS THEY WERE 

2503
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:55,550
MOVED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. 

2504
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,485
THERE WAS A GUIDE ROPE THAT WAS 

2505
01:20:57,485 --> 01:21:00,088
SET UP AND RATHER THAN BE ABLE 

2506
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,089
TO LOOK WHERE YOU ARE GOING, 

2507
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:01,957
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO MOVE 

2508
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:06,428
THROUGH BIT BY BIT. 

2509
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:07,462
ALSO, OF COURSE, THE CORE DOORS 

2510
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:11,032
ARE SO NARROW, THAT WAS PART OF 

2511
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:11,800
THE PROBLEM. 

2512
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,968
IT WAS NOT JUST GOING OUT AT 

2513
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:13,335
ONE ANGLE. 

2514
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:14,436
THEY WERE GOING UP, DOWN, AND 

2515
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,670
SOME OF THE BEST CAVE DIVERS IN 

2516
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,305
THE WORLD SAID IT WAS A TOUGH 

2517
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:18,974
CHALLENGE FOR THEM . 

2518
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:20,108
>> AS WILL JUST REMIND YOU HOW 

2519
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:22,744
THINGS HAVE UNFOLDED. 

2520
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:25,613
THE MISSION TO RESCUE THOSE 12 

2521
01:21:25,613 --> 01:21:29,584
BOYS AND THEIR FOOTBALL COACH 

2522
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:30,518
BEGAN AROUND 10 AM LOCAL TIME. 

2523
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:31,686
WE KNOW AT LEAST FOUR BOYS WERE 

2524
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:32,220
BROUGHT TO SAFETY. 

2525
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,822
THEY ARE CURRENTLY AT THE LOCAL 

2526
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:37,425
CHANG RAI HOSPITAL. 

2527
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:38,259
FOR THE TIME BEING, THE 

2528
01:21:38,259 --> 01:21:39,327
OPERATION HAS COME TO A CLOSE. 

2529
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,830
I HAVE SEEN A FACEBOOK POST 

2530
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:47,168
FROM THE THAI NAVY SEALS WISHING

2531
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:47,669
THEM SUPPORT.

2537
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:15,864
HELLO EVERYONE, I AM MEG 

2538
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:16,998
OLIVER, THANK YOU FOR JOINING 

2539
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:17,598
US, THE RESCUE OPERATION IS 

2540
01:22:17,598 --> 01:22:18,500
FINALLY UNDERWAY IN THAILAND, 

2541
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,701
THE THAI NAVY SAYS FOUR OF THE 

2542
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,804
12 YOUNG SOCCER PLAYERS TRAPPED 

2543
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:24,606
INSIDE A FLOODED CAVE HAVE BEEN 

2544
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:25,507
BROUGHT TO SAFETY SO FAR, THERE 

2545
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:36,751
ARE EIGHT KIDS LEFT TO SAVE ON 

2546
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:37,284
THE 25-YEAR-OLD COACH. 

2547
01:22:37,284 --> 01:22:38,553
THEY MAY NEED TO WAIT A BIT 

2548
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:39,421
LONGER AS CREWS PREPARE FOR THE 

2549
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:40,255
NEXT PHASE OF THE OPERATION. 

2550
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,322
FOR NOW, THOSE THAT ARE OUT 

2551
01:22:41,322 --> 01:22:42,924
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL 

2552
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,359
FOR TREATMENT. 

2553
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:45,260
IT IS TENTATIVE BUT THEY ARE 

2554
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,027
EXPECTED TO BE OKAY. 

2555
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:46,961
THAT IS DESPITE MORE THAN TWO 

2556
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:58,807
WEEKS STUCK IN PLACE, OFTEN IN 

2557
01:22:58,807 --> 01:22:59,674
THE DARK WITH DECLINING OXYGEN 

2558
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:00,275
AND LIMITED RESOURCES. 

2559
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:01,042
AT FIRST, THE BOYS WERE 

2560
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:01,977
MISSING, WHEN THEY WERE FOUND, 

2561
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:02,577
CREWS DISOVERED THAT GETTING 

2562
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:03,678
THEM OUT WOULD NOT BE EASY. 

2563
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:04,379
TODAY'S EFFORTS ARE THE 

2564
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:05,180
CULMINATION OF SEVERAL DAYS OF 

2565
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:05,880
WORK IN DIFFICULT CONDITIONS 

2566
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,452
THAT HAVE CLAIMED THE LIFE OF 

2567
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:11,086
AT LEAST ONE RESCUER. 

2568
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:12,020
THE DANGER IS FAR FROM OVER. 

2569
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:12,587
CBS NEWS, FOREIGN 

2570
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:13,588
CORRESPONDENT, BEN TRACY, SPOKE 

2571
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,957
WITH MARKET BRENNAN -- MARGARET 

2572
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:17,024
BRENNAN ABOUT THE LATEST 

2573
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:24,866
DEVELOPMENTS IN CHANG RAI. 

2574
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:25,834
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE NEWS 

2575
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:26,868
WE HAVE BEEN HOPING TO HEAR, 

2576
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:28,036
FOUR BOYS OUT OF THE CAVE AFTER 

2577
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:29,070
16 LONG DAYS, WE BELIEVE ALL 

2578
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,004
FOUR OF THEM WERE TRANSPORTED 

2579
01:23:30,004 --> 01:23:37,412
TO THE HOSPITAL IN CHIANG RAI 

2580
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:37,979
VIA HELICOPTER AND THEN 

2581
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:38,279
AMBULANCE. 

2582
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,413
WE DID SEE THE HEAD OF THE 

2583
01:23:39,413 --> 01:23:40,081
RESCUE OPERATION GIVEN NEWS 

2584
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:41,116
CONFERENCE, HE SAID IT WAS MORE 

2585
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:42,016
SUCCESSFUL THAN THEY THOUGHT IT 

2586
01:23:42,016 --> 01:23:45,252
WOULD BE AND IT WENT  SMOOTHLY. 

2587
01:23:45,252 --> 01:23:46,321
FROM THE TIME THE BOYS EXITED 

2588
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:47,755
THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE TO WHEN 

2589
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:48,623
THEY GOT ON THE HELICOPTER WAS 

2590
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:49,023
JUST 2 MINUTES. 

2591
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:50,191
HE SAID THAT WAS FIVE TIMES 

2592
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:50,859
FASTER THAN WHEN THEY TRIED 

2593
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:51,425
THIS IN REHEARSALS. 

2594
01:23:51,425 --> 01:23:52,460
THEY ARE FEELING VERY CONFIDENT 

2595
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,929
TONIGHT THAT THE FIRST STAGE OF 

2596
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:56,430
THE OPERATION GETTING FOUR BOYS 

2597
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:58,933
OUT OF THE CAVE HAS GONE 

2598
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:02,236
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL. MARGARET? 

2599
01:24:02,236 --> 01:24:03,338
>> WHY DID THE RESCUE OPERATION 

2600
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:05,840
HAPPEN NOW AND WHAT IS NEXT? 

2601
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,875
>> Reporter: WILL YOU KNOW, 

2602
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:07,909
THEY REALLY FELT A SENSE OF 

2603
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:15,150
URGENCY, THEY FELT LIKE THEY 

2604
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,418
HAD A SMALL WINDOW OF TIME TO 

2605
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:16,751
ATTEMPT THIS. 

2606
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:17,919
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS NOT THE 

2607
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:18,753
PREFERRED MODE OF DOING THIS, 

2608
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:19,621
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS 

2609
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:20,688
OPERATION TO BRING THESE YOUNG 

2610
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:23,858
BOYS OUT OF THE CAVE, THEY ARE 

2611
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:25,359
11-16, AND THIS IS THE WAY A 

2612
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:32,667
TRAINED NAVY SEAL WOULD DO 

2613
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:32,900
THIS. 

2614
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:33,868
THE REASON THEY DID THIS IS 

2615
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:34,903
THEY FELT THAT WITH HEAVY RAIN, 

2616
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,004
AND IT IS RAINING AGAIN, THERE 

2617
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:36,938
COULD BE FLOODING AGAIN AND CUT 

2618
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,373
THE BOYS OFF FROM SUPPLIES OR 

2619
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:38,940
SUCCESSFUL RESCUE CHANCES. 

2620
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:39,540
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY MEAN 

2621
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,242
THEY WOULD BE IN THE CAVE FOR 

2622
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,810
MONTHS ON A SMALL PIECE OF REAL 

2623
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:47,048
ESTATE THAT WOULD SHRINK AS THE 

2624
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:52,620
CAVE FLOODED. 

2625
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:53,655
THEY FELT LIKE THEY HAD A 

2626
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:54,322
LITTLE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY 

2627
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,423
WITH THE WEATHER, THEY FELT THE 

2628
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:56,224
BOYS WERE IN THE RIGHT 

2629
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:56,925
CONDITION TO WITHSTAND THE 

2630
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:57,225
OPERATION. 

2631
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:58,126
SO FAR, THEY HAVE BEEN RIGHT. 

2632
01:24:58,126 --> 01:24:59,127
THESE FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN OUT 

2633
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,161
AND WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO 

2634
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:01,229
BELIEVE THEY ARE ALL ALIVE, WE 

2635
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:02,430
DO NOT HAVE ANY SENSE OF THEIR 

2636
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,298
ACTUAL CONDITION IN TERMS OF 

2637
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:05,633
WHAT KIND OF SHAPE THEY ARE IN. 

2638
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:06,534
THEY WILL BE EVALUATED IN THE 

2639
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:07,769
HOSPITAL FOR 3-5 DAYS. 

2640
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:08,436
>> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

2641
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,872
TWEETED THIS MORNING THAT THE 

2642
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:14,576
U.S. IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH 

2643
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:15,543
THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND TO 

2644
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:16,076
GET THE CHILDREN OUT. 

2645
01:25:16,076 --> 01:25:18,046
HE SAID SOME VERY BRAVE AND 

2646
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:20,381
TALENTED PEOPLE ARE AT WORK AND 

2647
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:22,450
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THOSE 

2648
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:29,557
EFFORTS? 

2649
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:30,525
>> Reporter: WE HAVE BEEN 

2650
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:31,292
SITTING OUTSIDE THE CAVE AND 

2651
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,260
SEEN U.S. PERSONNEL THERE ON 

2652
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,494
THE SITE THERE IN VARIOUS 

2653
01:25:33,494 --> 01:25:35,697
CAPACITIES AS ADVISORS. 

2654
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,499
WE ARE TOLD THAT THERE WERE 

2655
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:38,700
AMERICAN DIVERS IN THE WATER AS 

2656
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,900
PART OF THE RESCUE. 

2657
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:45,974
THIS WAS AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT

2658
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,275
AND A TEAM OF 18 DIVERS, FIVE 

2659
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:48,076
OF WHICH FROM THAILAND, THE 

2660
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:51,045
REST WERE INTERNATIONAL. 

2661
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:51,945
YOU HAD THE U.S., BRITAIN, 

2662
01:25:51,945 --> 01:25:52,246
AUSTRALIA. 

2663
01:25:52,246 --> 01:25:53,081
THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT 

2664
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:55,683
HAS CAPTIVATED THE WORLD AND 

2665
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:56,618
COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 

2666
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:56,985
AND PERSONNEL. 

2667
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,854
JUST BEING THERE ON THAT SITE 

2668
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:00,421
AND SEEING HOW MANY PEOPLE 

2669
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:01,189
SHOWED UP TO HELP IN 70 

2670
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,656
DIFFERENT CAPACITIS. 

2671
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:05,026
IT IS QUITE STRIKING AND I'M 

2672
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,928
SURE THAT IS A BIG PART OF THE 

2673
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:08,429
SUCCESS SO FAR. 

2674
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:11,866
>> BEN, THE RESCUE IS RISKY, 

2675
01:26:11,866 --> 01:26:12,533
THE ALTERNATIVES ARE REALLY 

2676
01:26:12,533 --> 01:26:13,501
TOUGH FOR THOSE PARENTS THAT 

2677
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,404
HAVE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT 

2678
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:16,804
THEIR LOVED ONES. 

2679
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,072
I KNOW YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH 

2680
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:19,040
SOME OF THEM, WHAT ARE THEY 

2681
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,508
THINKING RIGHT NOW AS THIS IS 

2682
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:23,578
UNDERWAY? 

2683
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,013
>> Reporter: I CAN ONLY 

2684
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:38,993
IMAGINE, WE SPOKE WITH THE 

2685
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,061
FATHER OF THE YOUNGEST BOY IN 

2686
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:41,362
THE CAVE, HE IS ONLY 11 YEARS 

2687
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,297
OLD, HIS NAME IS TITAN, WE 

2688
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:43,598
SPOKE WITH HIS DAD AND HE SAYS, 

2689
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:44,599
THIS HAS BEEN HORRIBLE, IT HAS 

2690
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:45,433
BEEN NERVE-RACKING EVERY DAY TO 

2691
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:46,367
SIT THERE WAITING FOR NEWS. 

2692
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,368
FIRST IT WAS THEY COULD NOT 

2693
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:48,369
FIND THE BOYS, THEN ONCE THEY 

2694
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,103
FOUND THEM, THE SENSE OF 

2695
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,004
ELATION THAT THE PARENTS HAD, 

2696
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:52,206
THEN TO FIND OUT THAT THE 

2697
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:52,940
RESCUE MISSION WOULD BE 

2698
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:53,574
HORRIBLY DANGEROUS, IT HAS 

2699
01:26:53,574 --> 01:26:54,442
REALLY BEEN A ROLLER COASTER 

2700
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:54,942
FOR THESE FAMILIES. 

2701
01:26:54,942 --> 01:26:56,611
I CAN TELL YOU, AT THE CAVE 

2702
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:57,779
SITE THERE WAS BASICALLY A TENT 

2703
01:26:57,779 --> 01:26:58,613
WHERE MOST OF THE FAMILY 

2704
01:26:58,613 --> 01:26:59,614
MEMBERS, MOST OF THE MOTHERS 

2705
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:00,314
WERE SITTING IN CHAIRS WATCHING 

2706
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:00,882
TELEVISION COVERAGE JUST 

2707
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,183
WAITING FOR NEWS ABOUT THEIR 

2708
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:05,586
KIDS. TODAY THEY WERE STANDING 

2709
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:09,090
AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE AS THE 

2710
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:09,623
OPERATION WAS HAPPENING. 

2711
01:27:09,623 --> 01:27:10,658
THEY WILL NOW BE REUNITED WITH 

2712
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:13,161
THEIR SONS AT THE HOSPITAL.  

2713
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:18,900
>> HOW MUCH ANGER IS THERE AT 

2714
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:19,934
THE SITUATION ITSELF? 

2715
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:20,968
I KNOW THE BOYS WERE BEING 

2716
01:27:20,968 --> 01:27:21,836
SUPERVISED, THEY HAD A SOCCER 

2717
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:22,804
COACH WITH THEM, HE HAS BEEN 

2718
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:24,105
HEAVILY CRITICIZED FOR PUTTING 

2719
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:26,908
THEM IN THIS POSITION IN THE 

2720
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:30,878
FIRST PLACE, IS HE REALLY TO 

2721
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:38,586
BLAME HERE? 

2722
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:39,620
>> Reporter: LET ME SET THE 

2723
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,388
SCENE, THE SOCCER TEAM HAD 

2724
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:41,055
FINISHED THEIR PRACTICE, FROM 

2725
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:42,690
WHAT WE WERE TOLD BY MULTIPLE 

2726
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,024
PEOPLE IN THAILAND, THERE WAS 

2727
01:27:44,024 --> 01:27:44,658
SOME SORT OF BIRTHDAY 

2728
01:27:44,658 --> 01:27:45,426
CELEBRATION THAT WAS HAPPENING, 

2729
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:46,761
THAT IS WHY THEY WERE GOING TO 

2730
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:47,095
THE CAVE. 

2731
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:47,795
THEY WERE CELEBRATING SOMEONE'S 

2732
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:48,062
BIRTHDAY. 

2733
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:49,197
THEY WENT TO THE CAVE, THE 

2734
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,899
COACH APPARENTLY WAS WITH THEM. 

2735
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:54,068
THERE ARE BIG SIGNS OUTSIDE THE 

2736
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:55,202
CAVES WARNING OF THE DANGER 

2737
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:56,771
DURING THIS TIME OF YEAR DURING 

2738
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,640
THE RAINY SEASON THAT THE CAVE 

2739
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,774
CAN FLOOD AND BE UNSAFE. 

2740
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,976
CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING THE 

2741
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:04,545
COACH WILL NEED TO HER BREASTS 

2742
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:08,749
-- ADDRESS AT SOME POINT. 

2743
01:28:08,749 --> 01:28:10,952
THE COACH DID ISSUE AN APOLOGY 

2744
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:14,222
VIA A LETTER IN THE PARENTS AND 

2745
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:15,189
KIDS WERE SENDING LETTERS BACK 

2746
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:23,697
AND FORTH THE OTHER DAY AND 

2747
01:28:23,697 --> 01:28:24,732
SEVERAL OF THE PARENTS WENT OUT 

2748
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,134
OF THEIR WAY TO SAY WE DO NOT 

2749
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,101
BLAME YOU, TAKE CARE OF OUR 

2750
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:28,269
KIDS, WE KNOW THAT YOU LOVE 

2751
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:29,370
THEM, WE KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO 

2752
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:30,338
PROTECT THEM. 

2753
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:31,205
WE HEARD REPORTS THAT THIS 

2754
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:32,340
COACH WHEN THEY WENT IN WITH 

2755
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,408
LITTLE FOOD, I IMAGINE THEY HAD 

2756
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:34,342
SOME SNACKS BECAUSE THEY HAD 

2757
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:34,875
BEEN PLAYING SOCCER, HE 

2758
01:28:34,875 --> 01:28:35,910
APPARENTLY GAVE ALL OF THE FOOD 

2759
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:40,515
AND WATER TO KEEP THEM ALIVE. 

2760
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:42,917
AND WE ARE TOLD HE IS IN ONE OF 

2761
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:46,654
THE WEAKEST CONDITIONS OF 

2762
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:47,321
ANYONE IN THE CAVE. 

2763
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:48,256
HE CERTAINLY HAS DONE HIS BEST, 

2764
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:50,925
HE APPARENTLY TAUGHT THEM HOW 

2765
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:53,494
TO MEDITATE AND TRY TO KEEP 

2766
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:54,395
THEM CALM AND CONSERVE THEIR 

2767
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:55,363
ENERGY AND NOT PANIC WHILE THEY 

2768
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:57,732
WERE INSIDE.  

2769
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:58,566
>>> SUCH INCREDIBLE REPORTING 

2770
01:28:58,566 --> 01:28:59,634
FROM BEN TRACY IN THAILAND, WE 

2771
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:01,569

01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:02,670
THE LATEST. 

2773
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,772
>>> OUR CORRESPONDENT, DAN 

2774
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:10,511
JOHNSON IS IN THAM LUANG NEAR 

2775
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:11,179
THE EXIT OF THE TUNNEL. 

2776
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,346
IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT IS 

2777
01:29:12,346 --> 01:29:15,950
RAINING, THAT IS NOT GOOD NEWS? 

2778
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,251
>> Reporter: IT STARTED RAINING 

2779
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:18,019
REALLY HEAVILY HERE IN THE LAST 

2780
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:18,920
HOUR, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 

2781
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:19,487
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN 

2782
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:20,054
FEARING ALL WEEK. 

2783
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:24,358
THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE 

2784
01:29:24,358 --> 01:29:25,226
RESCUE MISSION, THE ATTEMPT TO 

2785
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:26,227
GET THE BOYS OUT WAS STARTED 

2786
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:27,094
THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE FEAR 

2787
01:29:27,094 --> 01:29:27,962
WAS THAT IF HEAVY RAIN 

2788
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:30,965
PERSISTED IT COULD RAISE THE 

2789
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:32,967
WATER LEVEL IN THE CAVE AND PUT 

2790
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:34,068
THE BOYS AT RISK. 

2791
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:35,470
THAT IS WHY THE AUTHORITIES 

2792
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:39,540
THOUGHT WAS THE PRIME 

2793
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,073
OPPORTUNITY TO START. 

2794
01:29:40,073 --> 01:29:41,008
THEY ARE TRYING TO TEACH THESE 

2795
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:42,310
BOYS AS MUCH AS THEY CAN AND 

2796
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,778
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE 

2797
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:50,718
THEM AFFILIATED. FOUR BOYS HAVE 

2798
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:51,919
SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATED THE 

2799
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:55,490
TORTUROUS PATH AND HAVE HAD TO 

2800
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:58,226
NAVIGATE THROUGH DARK AND 

2801
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:58,626
NARROW CHANNELS. 

2802
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:00,094
ONE DIVER WHOSE EXPERIENCED 

2803
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:01,829
THESE CONDITIONS IN THE CAVE SAY

2804
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:05,966
THE PARTS OF THIS JOURNEY ARE 

2805
01:30:05,966 --> 01:30:07,502
LIKE BEING FLUSHED TO THE YOU 

2806
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:08,402
BEND OVER TOILET. 

2807
01:30:08,402 --> 01:30:15,843
IT IS NARROW AND YOU ARE WINDING

2808
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:16,477
AROUND DIFFERENT OBSTRUCTIONS 

2809
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:17,078
WITH RUSHING WATER AND 

2810
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:17,912
SOMETIMES THE TIDE RUSHING 

2811
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:18,379
AGAINST THE BOYS. 

2812
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:19,213
THEY REALLY HAVE SOME TOUGH 

2813
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,749
CHALLENGES TO GET THROUGH. THE 

2814
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:22,750
OPERATION HAS PAUSE FOR THE 

2815
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:23,017
EVENING. 

2816
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:23,918
AS YOU CAN SEE, VEHICLES ARE 

2817
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:24,719
STILL COMING AND GOING BECAUSE 

2818
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,021
THERE IS A NEED TO SUPPLY MORE 

2819
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:30,024
EQUIPMENT AND CHANGE TEAMS 

2820
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:30,224
OVER. 

2821
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:31,359
THE SUPPORT TEAM WILL BE HERE 

2822
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:32,493
ALL NIGHT REGARDLESS. 

2823
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:33,294
TOMORROW MORNING THEY WILL 

2824
01:30:33,294 --> 01:30:34,195
RESTART IN EARNEST THE MISSION 

2825
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:35,496
TO FREE THE REMAINING EIGHT 

2826
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:38,432
BOYS AND THEIR COACH. 

2827
01:30:38,432 --> 01:30:39,099
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ALTHOUGH 

2828
01:30:39,099 --> 01:30:45,773
THERE HAS BEEN SOME SUCCESS 

2829
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:47,008
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF RISK 

2830
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:47,841
AND DANGER IN THE OPERATION. 

2831
01:30:47,841 --> 01:30:48,876
THERE IS A HUGE CHALLENGE STILL 

2832
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:49,944
TO ACCOMPLISH TO MAKE SURE THAT 

2833
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:56,250
EVERYONE GETS OUT SAFELY. 

2834
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:57,618
>> DAN, THERE IS NOW A 10 HOUR 

2835
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,220
BREAK, ARE THEY USING THIS SAME 

2836
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:07,428
DIVE TEAM FOR THE NEXT STAGE? 

2837
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:08,396
>> Reporter: WE UNDERSTAND IT 

2838
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:09,797
IS A SMALL TEAM THAT HAS COME 

2839
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:12,967
HERE AND THERE ARE 13 

2840
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:13,534
INTERNATIONAL DIVE EXPERTS 

2841
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:15,970
WORKING WITH FIVE ELITE DIVERS. 

2842
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,304
THEY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR 

2843
01:31:17,304 --> 01:31:20,841
TRAINING THE BOYS AND THEY HAVE 

2844
01:31:20,841 --> 01:31:22,410
THE ABILITY AND STRENGTH TO 

2845
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:25,913
MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND THEY 

2846
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:29,750
DECIDED WHICH BOYS WILL GO 

2847
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:29,983
FIRST. 

2848
01:31:29,983 --> 01:31:30,618
THEY DECIDED TO TAKE THE 

2849
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:31,586
WEAKEST FIRST AND THE ONES THEY 

2850
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:32,553
THOUGHT NEEDED TO GET OUT FIRST 

2851
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:37,391
AND THEY HAVE ESCORTED THESE 

2852
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:38,425
BOYS OUT AND IT TOOK PROBABLY 

2853
01:31:38,425 --> 01:31:42,129
NINE HOURS FOR THEM TO GET OUT 

2854
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:45,466
OF THE CABIN AND EVERYONE IS 

2855
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:46,934
AWARE OF HOW TRICKY AND 

2856
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:49,270
COMPLICATED THIS IS AND THE 

2857
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,671
DIVE TEAM IS HAVING SOME REST 

2858
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:54,709
AND SLEEP AND REGAINING THEIR 

2859
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:56,077
ENERGY AND THEY ARE READY TO

01:31:56,077 --> 01:31:57,044
COME BACK TOMORROW FOCUSED AND 

2861
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:58,479
READY TO APPLY THEIR EXPERTISE 

2862
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:05,285
TO MAKE SURE THE REMAINING BOYS 

2863
01:32:05,285 --> 01:32:06,287
AND THEIR COACH CAN BE ESCORTED 

2864
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:07,321
OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT 

2865
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:08,289
ALSO AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE 

2866
01:32:08,289 --> 01:32:09,257
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF 

2867
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:10,625
DANGER AND UNCERTAINTY IN THIS 

2868
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:14,695
RESCUE ATTEMPT.  

2869

>> DAN, BEFORE WE LET YOU GET 

2870
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:17,231
OUT OF THE RAIN, WHILE THE TEAM 

2871
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:18,132
IS HAVING THE BREAK, DOES THIS 

2872
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:18,866
MEAN THAT PUMPING OPERATIONS 

2873
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:23,104
WILL RESUME AND CONTINUE? 

2874
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:24,005
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE BEEN 

2875
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:24,472
PUMPING WATER ALMOST 

2876
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:25,172
CONTINUOUSLY SINCE THIS WHOLE 

2877
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:26,273
THING STARTED MORE THAN TWO 

2878
01:32:26,273 --> 01:32:27,341
WEEKS AGO JUST TO KEEP THE 

2879
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:30,344
WATER LEVEL IN THE CAVE STABLE. 

2880
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:31,378
THEY HAVE HAD TO PUMP MILLIONS 

2881
01:32:31,378 --> 01:32:35,816
OF LITERS OF WATER PER DAY AND 

2882
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:36,283
THAT CONTINUES. 

2883
01:32:36,283 --> 01:32:37,218
SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU 

2884
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,219
HAVE SEEN GOING IN COULD HAVE 

2885
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:39,086
BEEN MORE GENERATORS AND PUMPS 

2886
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:40,655
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO KEEP 

2887
01:32:40,655 --> 01:32:41,455
CHURNING THAT EQUIPMENT TO MAKE 

2888
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:48,729
SURE THERE IS POWER. THERE HAS 

2889
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:49,830
BEEN A TORRENT OF WATER RUNNING 

2890
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:50,765
DOWN FROM THE CAVE THAT THEY 

2891
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:51,899
HAVE BEEN PUMPING OUT FOR THE 

2892
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:52,934
LAST TWO WEEKS AND THEY HAVE 

2893
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:57,805
STARTED TO DIG A RESERVOIR TO 

2894
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:58,973
TAKE THE WATER SO IT DOES NOT 

2895
01:32:58,973 --> 01:32:59,573
CAUSE PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE. 

2896
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:00,507
IT NEVER SEEMED TO BE REALISTIC 

2897
01:33:00,507 --> 01:33:01,875
THAT THEY COULD DRAIN ENOUGH 

2898
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:03,644
WATER OUT OF THE CAVE FOR THE 

2899
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:04,377
BOYS TO WALK OUT. 

2900
01:33:04,377 --> 01:33:06,314
YOU COULD'VE HEARD EARLY ON úTH 

2901
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:07,281
AND SITTING THIS OUT BUT THAT 

2902
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:07,814
COULD'VE TAKEN MONTHS. 

2903
01:33:07,814 --> 01:33:12,787
IN THE MEANTIME, THERE IS RISK 

2904
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:13,821
OF RAIN FORCING THE WATER LEVEL 

2905
01:33:13,821 --> 01:33:13,987
UP. 

2906
01:33:13,987 --> 01:33:14,855
THERE WAS THE OPTION OF 

2907
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:15,923
DRILLING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND 

2908
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:21,028
THEY DID DRILL EXPLORATORY 

2909
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:21,595
HOLES TRYING TO FIND THE 

2910
01:33:21,595 --> 01:33:22,530
SHORTEST DISTANCE TO REACH THE 

2911
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,265
CABIN BUT IT WAS AT LEAST 600 

2912
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:25,666
METERS AND THE NATURE OF THE 

2913
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,535
MOUNTAIN IT'S ENVIRONMENT MAKES 

2914
01:33:27,535 --> 01:33:33,340
IT TOUGH WITH THICK AND STEEP 

2915
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:40,247
HILLS AND THICK VEGETATION. 

2916
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:40,948
THE SCUBA DIVING OPTION, 

2917
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:42,249
SWIMMING OUT THE WAY THAT THEY 

2918
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:43,050
CAME IN AND WALKED IN TWO WEEKS 

2919
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:48,255
AGO IS THE WAY THAT WAS PUT 

2920
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:49,457
INTO ACTION AND WAS FAVORED. 

2921
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,090
THEY HAVE PROVEN THAT THAT CAN 

2922
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:50,925
WORK AND THEY WILL CARRY ON 

2923
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:51,692
DOING THAT TOMORROW WITH 

2924
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:53,094
EVERYONE HOPING THAT THE REST 

2925
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:54,028
OF THE GROUP WILL SUCCEED SO 

2926
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:54,829
THAT EVERYONE CAN CELEBRATE 

2927
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:56,430
WHEN 13 PEOPLE ARE SAFELY OUT 

2928
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:58,499
OF THE CAVE. 

2929
01:33:58,499 --> 01:33:59,800
>> THAT IS DAN JOHNSON AT THE 

2930
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,168
THAM LUANG CAVE COMPLEX, THANK 

2931
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:01,368
YOU . 

2932
01:34:01,368 --> 01:34:07,074
>>> OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK 

2933
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:07,975
BECAUSE AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE 

2934
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:08,976
THE BOYS WERE TAKEN, NICK, WHAT 

2935
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:11,445
CAN YOU UPDATE US WITH? 

2936
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:25,993
>> Reporter: THEY WERE CERTAINLY

2937
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,294
WAITING FOR GOOD NEWS AND FOR 

2938
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:28,062
THEIR PATIENTS TO ARRIVE, 2.5 

2939
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:29,196
HOURS AGO, THE MEDICAL TEAMS AT 

2940
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:30,097
THE HOSPITAL, THE MAIN HOSPITAL 

2941
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:30,931
HERE IN THE CHIANG RAI REGION, 

2942
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:31,832
RECEIVED THE FIRST OF THE 

2943
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:32,099
PATIENTS. 

2944
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:33,134
WE SAW TWO AMBULANCES COME TO 

2945
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:34,101
THE  ENTRANCE, THEY MOVE THE 

2946
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:34,935
RAILINGS ASIDE AND WE ALSO 

2947
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:36,003
LATER HEARD TWO AMBULANCES OVER 

2948
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:39,640
HER -- OVERHEAD, TWO BOYS WERE 

2949
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,877
BROUGHT IN THROUGH ANOTHER 

2950
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:47,748
AMBULANCE -- ENTRANCE. 

2951
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:48,682
THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING AND HAVE 

2952
01:34:48,682 --> 01:34:49,617
HAD MEDICAL TEAMS ASSESS THEIR 

2953
01:34:49,617 --> 01:34:50,851
HEALTH FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO. 

2954
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:51,919
THE DOCTOR WAS DOWN IN THE CAVE 

2955
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:52,987
WITH THEM AFTER THEY WERE FOUND 

2956
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:53,853
BY THE AMATEUR BRITISH DIVERS. 

2957
01:34:53,853 --> 01:34:55,523
THEY HAVE BEEN ASSESSING THEIR 

2958
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,424
CONDITION DAILY AND THIS 

2959
01:34:57,424 --> 01:34:58,559
MORNING THE DECISION WAS MADE 

2960
01:34:58,559 --> 01:35:00,127
TO GO FOR THE ATTEMPT. 

2961
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:01,495
THE BELIEVED THE BOYS WERE 

2962
01:35:01,495 --> 01:35:03,363
STRONG ENOUGH MENTALLY AND 

2963
01:35:03,363 --> 01:35:05,365
PHYSICALLY. IN TERMS OF HOW 

2964
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:18,079
THEY ARE DOING NOW, THAT IS 

2965
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:18,612
WHAT WE WERE TOLD. 

2966
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:19,446
THE INDICATIONS THAT WE WERE 

2967
01:35:19,446 --> 01:35:20,614
TOLD IS THAT THEY ARE DOING 

2968
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:21,214
WELL CONSIDERING EVERYTHING 

2969
01:35:21,214 --> 01:35:21,648
THAT HAS HAPPENED. 

2970
01:35:21,648 --> 01:35:22,750
THIS IS A HUGE ORDEAL, IF YOU 

2971
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,652
THINK ABOUT THE PATH THAT THEY 

2972
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:25,585
TOOK TO GET OUT OF THE CAVE, 

2973
01:35:25,585 --> 01:35:26,386
EXTREMELY NARROW IN PLACES, 

2974
01:35:26,386 --> 01:35:27,421
VISIBILITY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 

2975
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:29,423
AS WELL, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO 

2976
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:30,391
SEE THINGS IN FRONT OF YOU, THE 

2977
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,692
FACT THAT FOUR BOYS ARE OUT 

2978
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:32,660
THIS EVENING HAS GIVEN MANY 

2979
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,929
PEOPLE HOPE IN THAILAND.  

2980
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:37,731
>>, UNDERSTANDABLY, THE 

2981
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:38,999
HOSPITALS AND THE AUTHORITIES 

2982
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:41,001
HAVE BEEN KEEN TO THE PART OF 

2983
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:42,469
THE PRIVACY OF THE FAMILIES AND 

2984
01:35:42,469 --> 01:35:47,941
THE BOYS AS WELL. 

2985
01:35:47,941 --> 01:35:48,909
THERE WAS A LOT OF SCREENING 

2986
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:49,509
AND SECURITY PRESENT OUTSIDE 

2987
01:35:49,509 --> 01:35:50,211
THE HOSPITAL, AS IT DIE DOWN? 

2988
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:53,914
>> Reporter: CERTAINLY THERE 

2989
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,649
ARE FEWER MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA 

2990
01:35:55,649 --> 01:36:01,889
HERE, THAT OBVIOUSLY IS A RESULT

2991
01:36:01,889 --> 01:36:02,890
OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE ONE 

2992
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:03,590
HOUR AGO WHERE THEY SAID THEY 

2993
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,358
WILL NOT BE ANY MORE 

2994
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:05,826
OPERATIONS, THERE WILL BE A 

2995
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:07,628
LITTLE IN THE RESCUE EFFORTS 

2996
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:08,495
BECAUSE AS DAN WAS SAYING, 

2997
01:36:08,495 --> 01:36:11,031
THESE ARE SPECIALIZED PEOPLE, A 

2998
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:12,399
SMALL CORE OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE 

2999
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:13,534
THE SKILLS TO GET TO THE PLACE 

3000
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:14,168
WHERE THE BOYS HAVE BEEN 

3001
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:14,435
TRAPPED. 

3002
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:15,602
THEY NEED TO REST OVERNIGHT. 

3003
01:36:15,602 --> 01:36:21,976
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON 

3004
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:22,676
INSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL NOW. 

3005
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:23,343
CERTAINLY, THE PARENTS THAT YOU 

3006
01:36:23,343 --> 01:36:23,977
MENTIONED, THEY HAVE BEEN AT 

3007
01:36:23,977 --> 01:36:24,945
THE RESCUE SITE FOR THE PAST 

3008
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:26,313
TWO WEEKS AND HAVE BEEN KEPT UP-

3009
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:26,947
TO-DATE WITH ALL OF THE 

3010
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:27,280
INFORMATION. 

3011
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,381
IF THEY ARE HERE TONIGHT, 

3012
01:36:28,381 --> 01:36:29,049
CLEARLY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN 

3013
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,018
TOLD BEFORE ANYONE ELSE WHAT IS 

3014
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:34,922
HAPPENING IT WAS INTERESTING, 

3015
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:36,490
WE HEARD FROM ONE SOURCE 

3016
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:37,090
EARLIER ON THAT THEY HAVE 

3017
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:39,326
MANAGED TO HAVE PART OF THE 

3018
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:41,996
HOSPITAL SEALED OFF SO THAT THE 

3019
01:36:41,996 --> 01:36:42,930
BOYS COULD BE BROUGHT IN, 

3020
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:47,268
TREATED, AND UNDERGO ROUTINE 

3021
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:47,868
EXAMINATIONS, BLOOD TESTING, 

3022
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:48,502
URINE TESTING, LOOKING TO SEE 

3023
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:51,171
IF THEY HAVE ANY INFECTION DUE 

3024
01:36:51,171 --> 01:36:52,006
TO BEING IN THE WATER WHICH IS 

3025
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,909
EXTREMELY DIRTY AND MURKY. 

3026
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:59,980
WE MAY GET MORE INFORMATION 

3027
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:00,881
ABOUT THEIR CONDITION OVERNIGHT 

3028
01:37:00,881 --> 01:37:02,416
OR IN THE MORNING, BUT THIS IS 

3029
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:04,618
ONGOING AND REMEMBER, IT TAKES 

3030
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:06,821
THE MOST EXPERIENCED DIVERS TO 

3031
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:10,991
GET WHERE THE BOYS ARE AND THIS 

3032
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:15,462
IS A MARATHON OPERATION.  

3033
01:37:15,462 --> 01:37:16,263
>> THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. 

3034
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:17,031
NICK THERE WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE 

3035
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:17,731
LOCAL HOSPITAL WHERE THE BOYS 

3036
01:37:17,731 --> 01:37:22,036
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO. LET'S SPEAK 

3037
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:26,206
NOW TO REUTERS BANGKOK DEPUTY 

3038
01:37:26,206 --> 01:37:30,277
BUREAU CHIEF, AMY, THANK YOU 

3039
01:37:30,277 --> 01:37:31,078
FOR JOINING US, ONE OF THE 

3040
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:32,012
BIGGEST STORIES POSSIBLY THAT 

3041
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:37,017
THAILAND HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH? 

3042
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:37,684
>> Reporter: YES, CERTAINLY ONE 

3043
01:37:37,684 --> 01:37:39,486
OF THE BIGGEST STORIES IN YEARS 

3044
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:42,223
FOR THAILAND, THIS IS A GOOD 

3045
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:47,394
NEWS STORY SO FAR. 

3046
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:47,961
THIS STORY DEFINITELY HAS 

3047
01:37:47,961 --> 01:37:48,696
BROUGHT THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, A 

3048
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:49,363
COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN DIVIDED 

3049
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:53,100
POLITICALLY FOR MANY YEARS. 

3050
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,902
THIS IS A BIG STORY BUT ALSO A 

3051
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:56,937
GOOD ONE. 

3052
01:37:56,937 --> 01:38:00,541
>> IN YOUR MEMORY, IT CAN YOU 

3053
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,076
REMEMBER ANY STORY THAT HAS 

3054
01:38:03,076 --> 01:38:05,245
INVOLVED THIS LEVEL OF RESCUE 

3055
01:38:05,245 --> 01:38:07,214
OR COOPERATION INTERNATIONALLY, 

3056
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:08,615
ALSO, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 

3057
01:38:08,615 --> 01:38:10,084
MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN THIS 

3058
01:38:10,084 --> 01:38:10,484
OPERATION? 

3059
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:11,952
>> Reporter: I DON'T THINK WE 

3060
01:38:11,952 --> 01:38:15,256
HAVE SEEN ANYTHING ON THIS SCALE

3061
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:18,659
IN RECENT THAILAND HISTORY. 

3062
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:20,260
REALLY, THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE 

3063
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:27,668
OPERATION AND THERE'S MANY 

3064
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:28,435
VOLUNTEERS AND TEAMS FLYING IN 

3065
01:38:28,435 --> 01:38:29,002
FROM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, 

3066
01:38:29,002 --> 01:38:30,137
AUSTRALIA, U.S., JAPAN TO NAME 

3067
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:30,471
A FEW. 

3068
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:31,638
THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION 

3069
01:38:31,638 --> 01:38:33,540
INVOLVED OVER THE PAST TWO 

3070
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:36,343
WEEKS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS 

3071
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:37,444
BEEN TRULY AMAZING. 

3072
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:39,613
WE HAVE HEARD INTERNATIONAL

PEOPLE FOR THEIR EFFORTS. 

3076
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,293
THE COUNTRY HAS NOT SEEN 

3077
01:38:53,293 --> 01:38:53,927
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.  

3078
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:54,694

SAYING AND HOW HAVE THEY 

3080
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:56,429
COVERED THE STORY? 

3081
01:38:56,429 --> 01:38:57,164
>> Reporter: THE COVERAGE HAS 

3082
01:38:57,164 --> 01:39:01,502
BEEN BLANKET COVERAGE, NONSTOP. 

3083
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:02,303
WHEN YOU GO TO THE STREETS, 

3084
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:02,903
HERE IN THE CAPITAL, OR 

3085
01:39:02,903 --> 01:39:04,304
ELSEWHERE, PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE 

3086
01:39:04,304 --> 01:39:09,643
IN THAILAND, AND IN TALKING TO 

3087
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:10,310
PEOPLE, ARE TALKING ABOUT THESE 

3088
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:11,278
BOYS AND HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE 

3089
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:12,546
THEY WERE FIRST TRAPPED IN THE 

3090
01:39:12,546 --> 01:39:13,747
CAVE. 

3091
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:15,249
THE BIG HIGHLIGHT WAS WHEN THE 

3092
01:39:15,249 --> 01:39:18,719
TWO BRITISH DRIVE -- DIVERS 

3093
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:19,453
FOUND THE BOYS LAST MONDAY. 

3094
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:27,394
THAT WAS NEWS THAT WAS MET WITH 

3095
01:39:27,394 --> 01:39:28,095
A HUGE POSITIVE REACTION, AN 

3096
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:28,795
AVALANCHE OF GOODWILL ON SOCIAL 

3097
01:39:28,795 --> 01:39:29,029
MEDIA. 

3098
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:29,663
THAT REALLY HAS BROUGHT THE 

3099
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:31,265
PEOPLE TOGETHER AT THIS TIME.  

3100
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:32,866
>> AND WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, 

3101
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:35,269
HOW BIG IS THIS SPORT OF CAVING 

3102
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:37,671
IN THE COUNTRY? 

3103
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:39,807
>> Reporter: WELL, IT IS FAIRLY 

3104
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:40,574
POPULAR IN PARTS OF THE 

3105
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:42,976
COUNTRY, BUT IT IS DEFINITELY 

3106
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:46,113
NOT A NATIONAL LEVEL SPORT, IT 

3107
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:47,414
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT MANY 

3108
01:39:47,414 --> 01:39:49,616
PEOPLE DO. 

3109
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:51,085
IN FACT, CYCLING IS PERHAPS THE 

3110
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:53,120
BIGGEST SPORT IN THAILAND. 

3111
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:57,491
THESE BOYS THAT WENT IN WERE 

3112
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:58,192
NOT EXPERT CAVERS, THEY HAD 

3113
01:39:58,192 --> 01:40:03,397
BEEN THERE DURING THE DRY SEASON

3114
01:40:03,397 --> 01:40:04,398
THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME 

3115
01:40:04,398 --> 01:40:05,232
THEY HAVE GONE IN DURING THE 

3116
01:40:05,232 --> 01:40:05,565
RAINY SEASON. 

3117
01:40:05,565 --> 01:40:06,399
THEY WERE NOT EXPERTS BY ANY 

3118
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:08,735
STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. 

3119
01:40:08,735 --> 01:40:09,636

3120
01:40:09,636 --> 01:40:13,474
RESUME AT 8 AM LOCAL TIME WHERE 

3121
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:15,042
YOU ARE?

MISSIONS SAYS THAT IN ABOUT 10 

3124
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:20,848
HOURS, JUST ABOUT NINE HOURS 

3125
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,816
FROM NOW, THE RESCUE OPERATION 

3126
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:25,052
WILL START AGAIN TO GET THE 

3127
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:26,520
REMAINING BOYS AND ALSO THEIR

CHIANG RAI CAVE.

WE HOPE TO SEE MORE PROGRESS 

3131
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:33,394
TOMORROW  IF THE WEATHER STAYS 

3132
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:35,028
ON THEIR SIDE. 

3133
01:40:35,028 --> 01:40:38,932
>> AMY, QUICKLY, IT HAS TO BE 

3134
01:40:38,932 --> 01:40:42,136
SAID THAT THE PARENTS HAVE COME 

3135
01:40:42,136 --> 01:40:43,537
ACROSS AS BEING QUITE CALM IN 

3136
01:40:43,537 --> 01:40:49,043
THIS, IS THIS JUST WITHIN THE 

3137
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:49,910
THAI CHARACTER, OR HAVE THEY 

3138
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:50,878
BEEN MORE VOCAL AND WISHES HAVE 

3139
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:52,746
NOT HEARD THIS? 

3140
01:40:52,746 --> 01:40:54,915
>> Reporter: I THINK IT IS MANY 

3141
01:40:54,915 --> 01:40:56,250
FACTORS, THROUGHOUT THE 

3142
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:57,518
OPERATION WE HAVE SEEN THE 

3143
01:40:57,518 --> 01:41:02,322
FAMILY CORDONED TO THE SIDE 

3144
01:41:02,322 --> 01:41:04,124
WITH THEIR OWN TENT, THEIR OWN 

3145
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:07,427
SHELTER AND FOR THE MOST PART 

3146
01:41:07,427 --> 01:41:10,296
THEY HAVE HAD SEVERAL BUDDHIST 

3147
01:41:10,296 --> 01:41:11,632
MONKS WITH AN LEADING PRAYERS 

3148
01:41:11,632 --> 01:41:17,471
AND MEDITATION. I THINK THAT 

3149
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:18,972
HAS HELPED THE PARENTS QUITE A 

3150
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:24,678
LOT IN KEEPING THEM CALM AND 

3151
01:41:24,678 --> 01:41:24,945
GROUNDED. 

3152
01:41:24,945 --> 01:41:25,679
THEY HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR GOOD 

3153
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:26,513
NEWS AND FINALLY IT CAME THAT 

3154
01:41:26,513 --> 01:41:27,147
THERE BOYS WERE FOUND. 

3155
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:28,849
THIS IS A HUGE PART OF THE 

3156
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:30,017
CALMNESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN.  

3157
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:33,554

DOING TO YOU WHEN YOU THINK 

3173
01:42:05,585 --> 01:42:06,353
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN CAMBRIA? 

3174
01:42:06,353 --> 01:42:11,258
>> IT IS THE SAME RANGE OF 

3175
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:11,858
EMOTIONS, YOUR CORRESPONDENT 

3176
01:42:11,858 --> 01:42:12,492
HAS PUT THIS WELL, IT IS 

3177
01:42:12,492 --> 01:42:13,193
ACTUALLY WONDERFUL NEWS, IT IS 

3178
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:18,232
NOT OVER YET AND YOU HAVE TO BE 

3179
01:42:18,232 --> 01:42:18,832
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, WHEN 

3180
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:19,533
THEY GO BACK INTO RESUME THE 

3181
01:42:19,533 --> 01:42:22,069
RESCUE OPERATION THEY NEED TO 

3182

HOPE THINGS WILL GO WELL. 

3183
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:26,773
>> IN TERMS OF CONDITIONS, ARE 

3184
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:27,507
THEY SIMILAR AROUND THE WORLD 

3185
01:42:27,507 --> 01:42:29,142
ONCE YOU GET INSIDE A CAVE OR 

3186
01:42:29,142 --> 01:42:29,509
DO THEY DIFFER? 

3187
01:42:29,509 --> 01:42:31,411
>> Reporter: THEY DO DIFFER 

3188
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:35,849
FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. 

3189
01:42:35,849 --> 01:42:36,984
I WOULD SAY FROM WHAT I AM 

3190
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:37,484
HEARING FROM THE THAI 

3191
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:38,018
OPERATION, THEY ARE QUITE 

3192
01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:40,887
SIMILAR TO BRITISH CONDITIONS 

3193
01:42:40,887 --> 01:42:41,688
AND THAT YOU HAVE POOR 

3194
01:42:41,688 --> 01:42:44,424
VISIBILITY AND SMALL PASSAGES. 

3195
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:49,462
THE ONE PERHAPS GOOD THING 

3196
01:42:49,462 --> 01:42:50,230
ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OVER THERE 

3197
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:51,031
IS THAT IT IS WARM, IT 

3198
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:51,732
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE WARM 

3199
01:42:51,732 --> 01:42:52,032
OVER HERE. 

3200
01:42:52,032 --> 01:42:54,768
THAT HAS BEEN A BIG PLUS IN 

3201
01:42:54,768 --> 01:43:00,040
HELPING TO GET THE BOYS OUT. 

3202
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,007
>> YOU RESCUED LES HEWITT BACK 

3203
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:07,748
IN 1992, THE TEAM HERE, OR 

3204
01:43:07,748 --> 01:43:08,682
RATHER THE TEAM IN THAILAND ARE 

3205
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:09,349
HAVING TO RESCUE CHILDREN, WHAT 

3206
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:10,150
WOULD BE YOUR PRIMARY CONCERN 

3207
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:11,018
IF YOU ARE PART OF THAT TEAM? 

3208
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:14,922
>> I THINK THAT IT WAS A VERY 

3209
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:19,026
BIG TEAM EFFORT TO RESCUE LESS 

3210
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:23,030
AND ROY DEAN AT THE TIME, I 

3211
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:26,800
THINK WITH CHILDREN, YOUR 

3212
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,534
CORRESPONDENT HAS SAID, IT IS 

3213
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:28,168
ALREADY ABOUT PRIORITIZING WHO 

3214
01:43:28,168 --> 01:43:28,869
IS THE WEAKEST, WHO NEEDS TO 

3215
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,937
GET OUT FIRST, WHO IS CONFIDENT

3216
01:43:30,937 --> 01:43:34,241
? WHO ARE THE MOST CONFIDENT? 

3217
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:37,177
IT WOULD BE A CASE OF PUTTING 

3218
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:40,180
THEM IN THE WATER PROBABLY WITH 

3219
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:42,015
THE EQUIPMENT ATTACHED AND 

3220
01:43:42,015 --> 01:43:46,186
GIVING THE CHILD ROOM, NOT 

3221
01:43:46,186 --> 01:43:47,054
UNDER THE FLOODED PART OF THE 

3222
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:47,854
CAVE, BUT IN THE WATER WHERE 

3223
01:43:47,854 --> 01:43:48,221
THEY ARE. 

3224
01:43:48,221 --> 01:43:48,855
I THINK THEY WOULD'VE WORKED 

3225
01:43:48,855 --> 01:43:49,856
ALL OF THAT OUT AND THEN SPLIT 

3226
01:43:49,856 --> 01:43:51,992
THEM INTO GROUPS TO DECIDE WHO 

3227
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:57,431
WOULD BE THE BEST TO TAKE OUT 

3228
01:43:57,431 --> 01:43:58,298
FIRST AND THEN CARRY ON FROM 

3229
01:43:58,298 --> 01:43:58,531
THERE. 

3230
01:43:58,531 --> 01:43:59,533
IT APPEARS THAT IS WHAT THE 

3231
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:00,500
CASE IS WHERE THEY HAVE NOW 

3232
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,702
SUSPENDED OPERATIONS BECAUSE IT 

3233
01:44:01,702 --> 01:44:04,638
IS A STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE 

3234
01:44:04,638 --> 01:44:12,946
SEARCHING FOR MISSING PEOPLE IN 

3235
01:44:12,946 --> 01:44:13,379
THE FLOODED CAVE. 

3236
01:44:13,379 --> 01:44:14,247
WHEN YOU FIND THEM, AFTER THE 

3237
01:44:14,247 --> 01:44:15,048
INITIAL EUPHORIA, YOU REALIZE, 

3238
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:16,917
THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY RESCUED 

3239
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:20,320
UNTIL THEY ARE ALL OUT. 

3240
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,622
I WOULD SAY THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY 

3241
01:44:22,622 --> 01:44:24,024
HAVE A PLAN, THEY ARE STICKING 

3242
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:24,891
TO THAT PLAN AND THEY WILL 

3243
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:27,561
RESUME AGAIN TOMORROW AND 

3244
01:44:27,561 --> 01:44:28,662
HOPEFULLY IT WILL CONTINUE TO 

3245
01:44:28,662 --> 01:44:30,931
BE SUCCESSFUL.  

3246
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:35,502
>> AS THE OTHER RESCUER, JEFF, 

3247
01:44:35,502 --> 01:44:37,571
WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND? 

3248
01:44:37,571 --> 01:44:47,948
WHAT PRESSURES ARE YOU UNDER? 

3249
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:48,949
>> YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR 

3250
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:49,783
OWN SAFETY, IT IS A STRESSFUL 

3251
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:50,751
TIME WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO GET 

3252
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:51,617
SOMEONE OUT AND YOU ARE TRYING 

3253
01:44:51,617 --> 01:44:53,053
TO BE POSITIVE ALL THE TIME. 

3254
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:55,021
YOU DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE 

3255
01:44:55,021 --> 01:44:58,125
SERIOUS DANGERS, I THINK THIS 

3256
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,861
IS VERY MUCH A CASE OF FOCUS ON 

3257
01:45:00,861 --> 01:45:04,931
YOUR OWN SAFETY AS WELL AND 

3258
01:45:04,931 --> 01:45:09,636
REMAIN POSITIVE TO GIVE THE 

3259
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:10,303
CONFIDENCE TO GET OUT.  

3260
01:45:10,303 --> 01:45:11,438
>> WHAT WARNING SIGNS ARE YOU 

3261
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:11,771
LOOKING FOR? 

3262
01:45:11,771 --> 01:45:13,774
WE KNOW THAT THE WEAKEST BOYS 

3263
01:45:13,774 --> 01:45:14,574
WERE TAKEN OUT FIRST, DOESN'T 

3264
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:17,544
THAT INCREASE THE RISK? WHAT 

3265
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:19,012
HELP SIGNS ARE YOU KEEPING YOUR 

3266
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:20,914
EYES OUT FOR? 

3267
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:24,784
>> WELL, THAT IS DIFFICULT TO 

3268
01:45:24,784 --> 01:45:26,286
SAY FOR ME, I WOULD BE 

3269
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:29,156
SPECULATING REGARDING HEALTH 

3270
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:32,325
SIGNS. CERTAINLY, FROM MY 

3271
01:45:32,325 --> 01:45:32,925
EXPERIENCE ON RESCUES THAT I 

3272
01:45:32,925 --> 01:45:33,760
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH, WE 

3273
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,197
WOULD MAINTAIN OR TRY AND 

3274
01:45:37,197 --> 01:45:41,301
MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT, WE 

3275
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:42,235
WOULD TRY AND LOOK AT THEM BY 

3276
01:45:42,235 --> 01:45:42,902
ALMOST SWIMMING BACKWARDS WITH 

3277
01:45:42,902 --> 01:45:47,007
THOSE THAT WE BROUGHT OUT, TWO 

3278
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:51,478
DIVERS PER PERSON, JUST LOOKING 

3279
01:45:51,478 --> 01:45:52,279
AT THEM, KEEPING THEM FOCUSED 

3280
01:45:52,279 --> 01:45:53,046
AND WATCHING FOR SIGNS OF PANIC 

3281
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:57,217
RATHER THAN MEDICAL ISSUES. IF 

3282
01:45:57,217 --> 01:45:59,953
THE WATER IS QUITE SHALLOW, I 

3283
01:45:59,953 --> 01:46:01,621
THINK IT IS, THAT IS A GOOD 

3284
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:05,592
THING. IF THE WATER IS VERY 

3285
01:46:05,592 --> 01:46:06,426
DEEP THAT IT DOES BECOME MORE 

3286
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:08,829
OF AN ISSUE PHYSIOLOGICALLY.  

3287
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:13,200
>> JEFF, DOESN'T IT ADD 

3288
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:13,900
PRESSURE TO KEEP EYE CONTACT 

3289
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,567
WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU ARE 

3290
01:46:14,567 --> 01:46:15,035
TRYING TO RESCUE? 

3291
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:18,839
YOU ARE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD 

3292
01:46:18,839 --> 01:46:19,539
THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY 

3293
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:20,240
LOOK BACK TO MAINTAIN EYE 

3294
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:20,507
CONTACT? 

3295
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:21,174
WE ARE HEARING THAT THESE 

3296
01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:23,443
PASSAGES ARE JUST SO NARROW? 

3297
01:46:23,443 --> 01:46:25,645
>> YES, THERE ARE SECTIONS THAT 

3298
01:46:25,645 --> 01:46:27,681
ARE NARROW IN MOST CAVE 

3299
01:46:27,681 --> 01:46:31,017
PASSAGES. 

3300
01:46:31,017 --> 01:46:31,684
CERTAINLY, THAT IS ONE OF THE 

3301
01:46:31,684 --> 01:46:32,619
ISSUES WHEN YOU GET TO A NARROW 

3302
01:46:32,619 --> 01:46:33,353
PART. 

3303
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:37,190
SINCE THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVES 

3304
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:39,759
TO HOLD THEM THROUGH A NARROW 

3305
01:46:39,759 --> 01:46:44,464
PART WITHOUT GUIDANCE, YOU CAN 

3306
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:45,164
BE THERE, YOUR PRESENCE CAN BE 

3307
01:46:45,164 --> 01:46:45,832
THERE, BUT MAYBE THE PHYSICAL 

3308
01:46:45,832 --> 01:46:46,666
CONTACT, OR THE EYE CONTACT 

3309
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:49,369
MIGHT HAVE TO BE REMOVED FOR A 

3310
01:46:49,369 --> 01:46:50,036
FEW SECONDS.  

3311
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:56,209
>> HOW DO YOU, AS YOU TRY TO DO 

3312
01:46:56,209 --> 01:46:56,943
THIS AND YOU SEE SIGNS OF 

3313
01:46:56,943 --> 01:46:57,677
PANIC, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? 

3314
01:46:57,677 --> 01:47:03,016
>> IT IS A CASE OF KEEP HOLD OF 

3315
01:47:03,016 --> 01:47:04,784
THEM. YOU ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE 

3316
01:47:04,784 --> 01:47:07,020
THAT PHYSICAL CONTACT TO MAKE 

3317
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,355
SURE THAT YOU ARE THERE, YOU 

3318
01:47:08,355 --> 01:47:10,457
ARE REASSURING THEM ALL THE TIME

3319
01:47:10,457 --> 01:47:11,691
AND YOU ARE ALSO REASSURING 

3320
01:47:11,691 --> 01:47:15,662
THROUGH YOUR EYES TO MAKE SURE 

3321
01:47:15,662 --> 01:47:16,463
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU 

3322
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:17,097
ARE NOT PANICKING, EVERYTHING 

3323
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:19,533
IS OKAY, THEY ARE DOING WELL 

3324
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:22,135
AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL RESPOND 

3325
01:47:22,135 --> 01:47:23,837
TO THAT IN-KIND. 

3326
01:47:23,837 --> 01:47:27,707
>> DEALING WITH CHILDREN, WOULD 

3327
01:47:27,707 --> 01:47:29,175
YOU HAVE TO KIND OF PULL THEM 

3328
01:47:29,175 --> 01:47:31,011
ALONG IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM

3329
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:34,014
? THERE COULD BE A FEAR OF WATER

3330
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:34,681
, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE 

3331
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:42,689
CILDREN CANNOT SWIM? 

3332
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:43,723
>> I DO NOT THINK THE SWIMMING 

3333
01:47:43,723 --> 01:47:44,558
ISSUES TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM 

3334
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:44,825
ACTUALLY. 

3335
01:47:44,825 --> 01:47:45,491
ONCE YOU GO TO A FLOODED 

3336
01:47:45,491 --> 01:47:48,094
PASSAGE THE BEST PLACE TO BE IS 

3337
01:47:48,094 --> 01:47:49,162
ON THE FLOOR OR THEREABOUTS IN 

3338
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:51,965
THIS TYPE OF SITUATION. 

3339
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:53,967
THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE WEIGHTED 

3340
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:57,571
SUITABLY SO THEY ARE DOWN ON 

3341
01:47:57,571 --> 01:47:58,370
THE FLOOR AND LITERALLY 

3342
01:47:58,370 --> 01:47:58,971
CRAWLING OR WALKING ALONG THE 

3343
01:47:58,971 --> 01:48:04,711
FLOOR TO GET OUT. 

3344
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:05,311
THE CHILDREN, I THINK WITH 

3345
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:06,913
THESE BOYS, WE HAVE SEEN FROM 

3346
01:48:06,913 --> 01:48:09,382
THEIR TEMPERAMENT AND THE WAY 

3347
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:09,915
THAT THEY HAVE CONDUCTED 

3348
01:48:09,915 --> 01:48:12,652
THEMSELVES, IT HAS BEEN AMAZING 

3349
01:48:12,652 --> 01:48:14,921
REALLY, I THINK THEY MIGHT WELL 

3350
01:48:14,921 --> 01:48:17,324
SEE THIS AS AN ADVENTURE AND 

3351
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:18,758
HOPEFULLY THAT IS HOW THEY WILL 

3352
01:48:18,758 --> 01:48:27,167
SEE IT, AND A BIT OF A 

3353
01:48:27,167 --> 01:48:27,867
CHALLENGE, CLEARLY THEY ARE UP 

3354
01:48:27,867 --> 01:48:28,768
FOR THIS CHALLENGE BY THE FACT 

3355
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:29,436
THAT THEY WENT INTO THESE 

3356
01:48:29,436 --> 01:48:30,203
CAVES, HOPEFULLY THEY WILL SEE 

3357
01:48:30,203 --> 01:48:30,937
IT LIKE THAT AND HAVE THE 

3358
01:48:30,937 --> 01:48:32,205
CONFIDENCE THAT IS REQUIRED. 

3359
01:48:32,205 --> 01:48:33,673
>> HOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE A 

3360
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:34,875
CHILD? 

3361
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:37,143
WHAT SORT OF COMMUNICATION 

3362
01:48:37,143 --> 01:48:37,710
METHODOLOGY WOULD YOU HAVE 

3363
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:42,282
BEFORE GONG TO THE WATER? TUG 

3364
01:48:42,282 --> 01:48:42,915
ON THE WIRE, IF SOMETHING 

3365
01:48:42,915 --> 01:48:43,783
HAPPENS, IF YOU ARE WORRIED, IF 

3366
01:48:43,783 --> 01:48:44,684
YOU ARE BEGINNING TO PANIC, HOW 

3367
01:48:44,684 --> 01:48:47,020
DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THE 

3368
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,755
CHILD? 

3369
01:48:48,755 --> 01:48:49,789
>> YOU CANNOT REALLY 

3370
01:48:49,789 --> 01:48:51,024
COMMUNICATE UNDERWATER APART 

3371
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:56,262
FROM VISUAL SIGNALS. YOU CANNOT 

3372
01:48:56,262 --> 01:48:58,798
SPEAK WITH ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT 

3373
01:48:58,798 --> 01:49:01,201
SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT, YOU 

3374
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:02,469
WOULD NOT BE EQUIPPING NON-

3375
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:06,039
DIVERS WITH THAT SORT OF 

3376
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:07,607
EQUIPMENT AND YOU HAVE TO GET 

3377
01:49:07,607 --> 01:49:13,313
THEM AS CALM AS POSSIBLE BEFORE 

3378
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,514
STARTING AND ONCE THE DIVE IS 

3379
01:49:14,514 --> 01:49:15,148
UNDERWAY IT IS MAINTAINING THE 

3380
01:49:15,148 --> 01:49:15,848
PHYSICAL AND VISUAL PRESENCE SO 

3381
01:49:15,848 --> 01:49:17,117
THEY KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS WITH 

3382
01:49:17,117 --> 01:49:18,919
THEM AT ALL TIMES.  

3383
01:49:18,919 --> 01:49:24,224
>> SINCE THE OPERATION, THE 

3384
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:24,824
SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE 

3385
01:49:24,824 --> 01:49:25,725
FOUR BOYS THAT WE DO KNOW HAVE 

3386
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:26,927
EXITED THE CAVE, A LOT OF 

3387
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:29,195
TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE 

3388
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:34,167
DIVER THAT LOST HIS LIFE THIS 

3389
01:49:34,167 --> 01:49:34,801
WEEK, HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS, 

3390
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:37,470
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF A CHILD IS 

3391
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,171
LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS? 

3392
01:49:38,171 --> 01:49:39,005
>> THERE WOULD BE NO RESPONSE, 

3393
01:49:39,005 --> 01:49:40,440
OR THEY WOULD STOP MOVING IF 

3394
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:45,912
THEY WERE LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS. 

3395
01:49:45,912 --> 01:49:46,780
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEED THINGS 

3396
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:48,848
UP TO TRY AND GET THEM OUT, 

3397
01:49:48,848 --> 01:49:51,418
THERE ARE TWO DEATHS THAT CAN 

3398
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:57,891
HAPPEN WHICH IS SLOW AND STOP. 

3399
01:49:57,891 --> 01:49:58,758
THIS IS A SLOW AND METICULOUS 

3400
01:49:58,758 --> 01:49:59,358
OPERATION BUT OBVIOUSLY IF 

3401
01:49:59,358 --> 01:49:59,992
SOMEONE'S LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS 

3402
01:49:59,992 --> 01:50:00,593
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. 

3403
01:50:00,593 --> 01:50:01,828
VISIBILITY IS POOR, THAT IS AN 

3404
01:50:01,828 --> 01:50:06,900
ENEMY OF CAVE DIVING. THAT MAY 

3405
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,835
NOT BE VERY APPARENT. 

3406
01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:09,803
YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE 

3407
01:50:09,803 --> 01:50:13,373
OUT ALL THE TIME. I WOULD SAY 

3408
01:50:13,373 --> 01:50:14,073
ACTUALLY, AT THIS POINT, WITH 

3409
01:50:14,073 --> 01:50:15,742
THE THAI DIVERS, THERE IS SOME 

3410
01:50:15,742 --> 01:50:17,410
SPECIAL MENTION TO THEM HAVING 

3411
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:23,450
BEEN DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, 

3412
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:24,050
THEY ARE REALLY NOT TRAINED 

3413
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:24,784
CAVE DIVERS, IT IS WONDERFUL 

3414
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:25,819
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE WAY 

3415
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:28,855
THAT THEY HAVE SUPPORTED THE 

3416
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:29,355
OPERATION. 

3417
01:50:29,355 --> 01:50:31,524
>> IN TERMS OF THE GEAR THAT 

3418
01:50:31,524 --> 01:50:33,159
THE RESCUE TEAM AND THE 

3419
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:34,527
CHILDREN WOULD BE WEARING, 

3420
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:36,996
THERE IS SOME RISK THERE THAT 

3421
01:50:36,996 --> 01:50:39,432
THAT COULD GET DAMAGED AND ALSO 

3422
01:50:39,432 --> 01:50:42,469
THE AIRLINE THAT IS ATTACHED TO 

3423
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:43,569
THE DIVER, HOW DO YOU ENSURE 

3424
01:50:43,569 --> 01:50:48,575
THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN? 

3425
01:50:48,575 --> 01:50:50,176
>> I DO NOT KNOW WHAT PLAN THEY 

3426
01:50:50,176 --> 01:50:53,480
PUT INTO PLACE OVER THERE 

3427
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,715
REGARDING WHO WEARS THE 

3428
01:50:55,715 --> 01:50:57,851
EQUIPMENT AND WHERE THE AIR HOSE

3429
01:50:57,851 --> 01:51:02,389
IS GOING. I CAN ONLY RELATE TO 

3430
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:06,126
OUR EXAMPLE WHICH IS THE 

3431
01:51:06,126 --> 01:51:07,193
CASUALTY THAT THEY WOULD 

3432
01:51:07,193 --> 01:51:11,197
SURRENDER. THIS IS PART OF 

3433
01:51:11,197 --> 01:51:14,534
BEING ACCOMPANIED BY TWO DIVERS.

3434
01:51:14,534 --> 01:51:17,203
THAT IS THE FIRST ONE AS THEY 

3435
01:51:17,203 --> 01:51:17,837
SAID EARLIER PERHAPS SWIMMING 

3436
01:51:17,837 --> 01:51:20,807
BACKWARDS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 

3437
01:51:20,807 --> 01:51:24,511
AND FEEDING THE GUIDELINE TO 

3438
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:24,978
THE CASUALTY. 

3439
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:25,712
THE DIVER BEHIND WAS CONSTANTLY 

3440
01:51:25,712 --> 01:51:26,913
MAKING SURE THAT THE AIRLINE 

3441
01:51:26,913 --> 01:51:32,986
DID NOT CATCH ON ANY ROCK 

3442
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:33,719
PROJECTIONS AND THE LINE DID 

3443
01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:34,353
NOT GET TANGLED ON ANY 

3444
01:51:34,353 --> 01:51:37,557
EQUIPMENT WHICH COULD STOP THE 

3445
01:51:37,557 --> 01:51:38,992
OPERATION COMPLETELY.  

3446
01:51:38,992 --> 01:51:40,226
>> WE NOW KNOW THAT THERE IS A 

3447
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:40,994
10 HOUR REST PERIOD, WHY IS 

3448
01:51:40,994 --> 01:51:41,361
THAT NEEDED? 

3449
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:42,629
WHAT ARE THEY DOING DURING THAT 

3450
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:46,199
TIME? 

3451
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:47,033
>> I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN 

3452
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:47,967
WORKING FLAT-OUT, I THINK IT IS 

3453
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:48,600
FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE 

3454
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,969
BEEN WORKING FLAT-OUT AND I 

3455
01:51:49,969 --> 01:51:50,603
CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW STRESSFUL 

3456
01:51:50,603 --> 01:51:54,808
IT WILL BE FOR THEM CONSIDERING 

3457
01:51:54,808 --> 01:51:56,843
THAT MOST OF THE DIVERS WILL 

3458
01:51:56,843 --> 01:52:00,780
NOT SPEAK THAI SO THEY 

3459
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:01,380
CONSTANTLY NEED LANGUAGE 

3460
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:05,652
TRANSLATIONS FED TO THEM. THEY 

3461
01:52:05,652 --> 01:52:07,654
JUST NEED REST AND RECUPERATION.

3462
01:52:07,654 --> 01:52:09,522
IT IS A GOOD THING THAT THE SAME

3463
01:52:09,522 --> 01:52:14,093
TEAM STICKS TOGETHER BECAUSE OF 

3464
01:52:14,093 --> 01:52:14,927
THE PLAN IS WORKING, THEN DO 

3465
01:52:14,927 --> 01:52:18,731
NOT CHANGE IT. I AM SURE THAT 

3466
01:52:18,731 --> 01:52:21,100
IS WHAT THEY HAVE DECIDED TO DO 

3467
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:22,902
>> JEFF CROSSLEY, THANK YOU SO 

3468
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:24,304
MUCH FOR THE CHAT HERE 

3469
01:52:25,771 --> 01:52:46,526
ON  

3470
01:52:46,893 --> 01:52:50,930
>>> THEY ARE TAKING EFFORTS TO 

3471
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:53,933
REMOVE -- TO RESCUE THE BOYS 

3472
01:52:53,933 --> 01:52:55,001
AND THEIR COACH. 

3473
01:52:55,001 --> 01:52:57,971
THE TUNNELS WERE WATERLOGGED. 

3474
01:52:57,971 --> 01:52:59,706
DIVERS WERE CALLED ON AND THEY 

3475
01:52:59,706 --> 01:53:02,976
HELPED TO FIND THE GROUP 

3476
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:05,879
SHELTERING AROUND 2.5 MILES 

3477
01:53:05,879 --> 01:53:11,017
FROM THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE ON 

3478
01:53:11,017 --> 01:53:12,619
MONDAY. 

3479
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:13,519
THE VAST CAVE NETWORK STRETCHES 

3480
01:53:13,519 --> 01:53:21,928
10 KILOMETERS INTO THE MOUNTAIN.

3481
01:53:21,928 --> 01:53:23,162
THE TUNNEL IS 1 MILE 

3482
01:53:23,162 --> 01:53:23,462
UNDERWATER. 

3483
01:53:23,462 --> 01:53:24,564
THE FIRST BOY WAS BROUGHT OUT 

3484
01:53:24,564 --> 01:53:26,299
OF THE CAVE AT AROUND MIDDAY 

3485
01:53:26,299 --> 01:53:29,035
OUR TIME. 

3486
01:53:29,035 --> 01:53:30,570
ALL OF THE FOUR RESCUE BOYS ARE 

3487
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,338
BEING TREATED IN HOSPITALS. 

3488
01:53:32,338 --> 01:53:34,874
MORE RESCUE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN 

3489
01:53:34,874 --> 01:53:42,015
PAUSED TO ALLOW DIVERS TO 

3490
01:53:42,015 --> 01:53:42,882
PREPARE FOR THE MISSION. 

3491
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:43,983
THE RESCUE TEAM HAS BEEN 

3492
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:44,350
DREADING RAIN. 

3493
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,351
IT APPEARS TO HAVE ARRIVED. 

3494
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:47,020
IT IS, OF COURSE, MONSOON 

3495
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:53,426
SEASON. 

3496
01:53:53,426 --> 01:53:54,627
LET'S SPEAK TO ANDY, THE FORMER 

3497
01:53:54,627 --> 01:53:55,628
HEAD OF THE BRITISH CAVING 

3498
01:53:55,628 --> 01:53:57,130
ASSOCIATION, JOINING US THROUGH 

3499
01:53:57,130 --> 01:53:59,599
THE WEB CAMERA. 

3500
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:00,667
YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS 

3501
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:03,002
STORY AND TALKING TO US ON BBC 

3502
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:06,973
NEWS. 

3503
01:54:06,973 --> 01:54:07,807
THIS LATEST DEVELOPMENT, WE 

3504
01:54:07,807 --> 01:54:08,775
HAVE HAD FOUR BOYS OUT. 

3505
01:54:08,775 --> 01:54:10,043
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT? 

3506
01:54:10,043 --> 01:54:10,576
>> EUPHORIA. 

3507
01:54:10,576 --> 01:54:12,812
I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY 

3508
01:54:12,812 --> 01:54:14,113
WONDERFUL THAT THEY HAVE GOT 

3509
01:54:14,113 --> 01:54:18,017
FOUR OUT SAFELY AND IT SUGGESTS,

3510
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:19,585
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LUCK AND 

3511
01:54:19,585 --> 01:54:20,853
NOT TOO MUCH RAIN, THAT THEY 

3512
01:54:20,853 --> 01:54:22,054
CAN GET THE OTHER NINE OUT. 

3513
01:54:22,054 --> 01:54:22,889
SO FINGERS CROSSED. 

3514
01:54:22,889 --> 01:54:27,527
THE GREAT MOMENT LAST WEEK WAS 

3515
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:28,328
ACTUALLY GETTING THROUGH AND 

3516
01:54:28,328 --> 01:54:32,999
FINDING THE BOYS AND FINDING 

3517
01:54:32,999 --> 01:54:34,067
ALL 13 OF THEM ALIVE. 

3518
01:54:34,067 --> 01:54:35,468
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL MOMENT. 

3519
01:54:35,468 --> 01:54:39,238
THE SECOND WONDERFUL MOMENT WAS 

3520
01:54:39,238 --> 01:54:40,473
GETTING THE FIRST OF THEM OUT 

3521
01:54:40,473 --> 01:54:45,144
INTACT AND LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. 

3522
01:54:45,144 --> 01:54:45,778
IN BETWEEN, UNFORTUNATELY, 

3523
01:54:45,778 --> 01:54:47,180
THERE WAS THIS DREADFUL 

3524
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:52,018
DISASTER OF THE DIVER DYING, 

3525
01:54:52,018 --> 01:54:56,589
AND THAT UNDERLIES -- UNDERLINES

3526
01:54:56,589 --> 01:54:57,991
THE DANGER THAT THERE IS WITH 

3527
01:54:57,991 --> 01:54:58,925
THIS TYPE OF OPERATION. 

3528
01:54:58,925 --> 01:55:01,661
THE CAVE DIVERS REALIZE THIS 

3529
01:55:01,661 --> 01:55:03,830
SITUATION. 

3530
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:15,208
THEY WILL BE CAREFUL AND CALM, 

3531
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:15,875
COOL, AND COLLECTED. 

3532
01:55:15,875 --> 01:55:16,843
YOU WERE ASKING EARLIER WHAT 

3533
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:17,677
THEY WILL BE DOING. 

3534
01:55:17,677 --> 01:55:18,444
THEY WILL BE RESTING. 

3535
01:55:18,444 --> 01:55:19,912
I HOPE THAT THEY WILL GET AS 

3536
01:55:19,912 --> 01:55:21,147
MUCH REST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN 

3537
01:55:21,147 --> 01:55:22,548
TO ENABLE THEM TO GO BACK IN 

3538
01:55:22,548 --> 01:55:23,383
AND PERFORM THEIR OPERATION, 

3539
01:55:23,383 --> 01:55:25,551
BOTH SAFELY FOR THEMSELVES AND 

3540
01:55:25,551 --> 01:55:30,890
SAFELY FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY 

3541
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:31,324
ARE RESCUING. 

3542
01:55:31,324 --> 01:55:32,725
>> IS A 10 HOUR PERIOD ENOUGH 

3543
01:55:32,725 --> 01:55:33,926
TO RELIEVE THE STRESS THAT THE 

3544
01:55:33,926 --> 01:55:38,197
HUMAN BODY IS PUT UNDER WHEN 

3545
01:55:38,197 --> 01:55:38,831
THEY ARE DIVING? 

3546
01:55:38,831 --> 01:55:40,066
IT IS NOT DEEPWATER BUT THERE 

3547
01:55:40,066 --> 01:55:40,866
ARE INCREDIBLE STRESSES BEING 

3548
01:55:40,866 --> 01:55:41,701
PUT ON THE DIVERS. 

3549
01:55:41,701 --> 01:55:43,302
>> I COULD SAY ONE COULD SAY. 

3550
01:55:43,302 --> 01:55:45,271
IT IS NOT REALLY ENOUGH. 

3551
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:49,175
BUT THERE IS A LEVEL OF URGENCY.

3552
01:55:49,175 --> 01:55:50,543
I DO NOT KNOW QUITE WHAT 

3553
01:55:50,543 --> 01:55:53,880
DIFFERENCE THE RAIN WILL MAKE. 

3554
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:54,914
I SUSPECT QUITE A SIGNIFICANT 

3555
01:55:54,914 --> 01:55:56,716
DIFFERENCE IN MAKING IT LONGER 

3556
01:55:56,716 --> 01:55:57,984
UNDERWATER. 

3557
01:55:57,984 --> 01:56:03,322
THE UNDERWATER PASSAGES WILL 

3558
01:56:03,322 --> 01:56:03,689
BECOME LONGER. 

3559
01:56:03,689 --> 01:56:04,590
THE FLOODED SECTIONS WILL BE 

3560
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:04,823
LONGER. 

3561
01:56:04,823 --> 01:56:11,497
THE AIRSPACE WILL BE SHORTER. 

3562
01:56:11,497 --> 01:56:13,032
IF IT IS POURING RAIN, THE 

3563
01:56:13,032 --> 01:56:14,167
SOONER THAT THEY GET IN AND GET 

3564
01:56:14,167 --> 01:56:15,201
THE REST OUT, THE BETTER. 

3565
01:56:15,201 --> 01:56:18,938
I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS A 

3566
01:56:18,938 --> 01:56:19,872
DANGER, AN IMMEDIATE DANGER, 

3567
01:56:19,872 --> 01:56:20,673
ANYWAY, OF THEM ACTUALLY 

3568
01:56:20,673 --> 01:56:21,908
FLOODING OUT WHERE THEY ARE AND 

3569
01:56:21,908 --> 01:56:23,042
GOING TO THE ROOFTOP AND REALLY 

3570
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:24,443
GIVING THEM A LIFE-THREATENING 

3571
01:56:24,443 --> 01:56:26,412
PROBLEM. 

3572
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:28,147
IT WILL CERTAINLY -- THE RAIN 

3573
01:56:28,147 --> 01:56:29,382
WILL MAKE THE RESCUING MORE 

3574
01:56:29,382 --> 01:56:30,383
DIFFICULT. 

3575
01:56:30,383 --> 01:56:40,392
I KNOW THAT THEY WILL THINK THE 

3576
01:56:40,392 --> 01:56:40,993
SOONER THE BETTER. 

3577
01:56:40,993 --> 01:56:41,827
THEY NEED TO REST. 

3578
01:56:41,827 --> 01:56:42,929
IT IS BALANCING THE TWO. 

3579
01:56:42,929 --> 01:56:43,996
>>> HOW FIT ARE THESE CHAPS? 

3580
01:56:43,996 --> 01:56:47,033
I AM ASSUMING THAT THEY ARE ALL 

3581
01:56:47,033 --> 01:56:49,302
MEN. 

3582
01:56:49,302 --> 01:56:50,203
>> I AM SORRY. 

3583
01:56:50,203 --> 01:56:51,370
I CANNOT HEAR YOU VERY WELL. 

3584
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:52,538
>> HOW FIT ARE THESE DIVERS? 

3585
01:56:52,538 --> 01:56:53,773
>> THE DIVERS ARE VERY FIT. 

3586
01:56:53,773 --> 01:56:58,878
THEY ARE PHYSICALLY PRETTY FIT. 

3587
01:56:58,878 --> 01:57:01,080
RICK HAS JUST CANOODLE AROUND 

3588
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:01,414
TASMANIA. 

3589
01:57:01,414 --> 01:57:08,020
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE PRETTY FIT 

3590
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:08,621
TO DO THAT. 

3591
01:57:08,621 --> 01:57:10,056
THEY ARE FIT GUYS BUT THEY ARE 

3592
01:57:10,056 --> 01:57:13,693
VERY, VERY EXPERIENCED CAVE 

3593
01:57:13,693 --> 01:57:18,331
DIVERS. 

3594
01:57:18,331 --> 01:57:19,398
THOSE TWO WORDS ARE IMPORTANT. 

3595
01:57:19,398 --> 01:57:20,700
THEY ARE NOT JUST DIVERS AND 

3596
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:21,033
JUST CAVERS. 

3597
01:57:21,033 --> 01:57:22,001
THEY ARE CAVE DIVERS. 

3598
01:57:22,001 --> 01:57:23,302
IT IS A DIFFERENT MINDSET WHEN 

3599
01:57:23,302 --> 01:57:23,769
YOU ARE UNDERWATER, 

3600
01:57:23,769 --> 01:57:24,871
UNDERGROUND, AND IT IS MORE OF 

3601
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:26,973
A MIND EXERCISE THAN A PHYSICAL 

3602
01:57:26,973 --> 01:57:28,541
EXERCISE. 

3603
01:57:28,541 --> 01:57:29,842
YOU HAVE TO HAVE EXACTLY THE 

3604
01:57:29,842 --> 01:57:41,320
RIGHT FRAME OF MIND TO KEEP COOL

3605
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,755
-- COOL AND CALM AND COLLECTED. 

3606
01:57:42,755 --> 01:57:44,023
THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO 

3607
01:57:44,023 --> 01:57:44,323
DO. 

3608
01:57:44,323 --> 01:57:45,291
THESE BOYS ARE SHOWING A 

3609
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:45,758
WONDERFUL FORTITUDE. 

3610
01:57:45,758 --> 01:57:46,926
FOR THEM TO KEEP CALM DURING 

3611
01:57:46,926 --> 01:57:48,327
THE NINE DAYS THAT THEY WERE IN 

3612
01:57:48,327 --> 01:57:49,195
COMPLETE DARKNESS IS WONDERFUL. 

3613
01:57:49,195 --> 01:57:50,229
THAT REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT 

3614
01:57:50,229 --> 01:57:51,597
THAT THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO 

3615
01:57:51,597 --> 01:57:52,665
BE PRETTY COOL AND CALM COMING 

3616
01:57:52,665 --> 01:57:53,599
OUT UNDERWATER. 

3617
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:58,037
CERTAINLY THE FOUR COMING OUT 

3618
01:57:58,037 --> 01:57:58,704
NOW WILL HAVE OBVIOUSLY 

3619
01:57:58,704 --> 01:57:59,138
EXPERIENCED THAT. 

3620
01:57:59,138 --> 01:58:00,072
THEY GOT BACK SAFELY. 

3621
01:58:00,072 --> 01:58:00,305
RATES. 

3622
01:58:00,305 --> 01:58:09,148
THEY ARE COMING HOME, BRILLIANT.

3623
01:58:09,148 --> 01:58:10,683
>> YOU ARE TALKING THERE ABOUT 

3624
01:58:10,683 --> 01:58:11,050
MIND EXERCISE. 

3625
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:12,118
ARE THERE CERTAIN TRICKS THAT 

3626
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:13,119
THEY WOULD HAVE TAUGHT THE 

3627
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:13,753
CHILDREN FROM THEIR OWN 

3628
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:14,420
EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE? 

3629
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,955
>> WELL, JEFF EARLIER WAS 

3630
01:58:15,955 --> 01:58:26,665
SAYING THAT THEY WILL BE 

3631
01:58:26,665 --> 01:58:27,700
SWIMMING THEM AROUND IN THE 

3632
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:28,867
SWIMMING -- IN THE POOL, AND 

3633
01:58:28,867 --> 01:58:30,436
THEY WILL BE TRYING TO GET THEM 

3634
01:58:30,436 --> 01:58:30,903
CONFIDENT UNDERWATER. 

3635
01:58:30,903 --> 01:58:31,837
THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT SWIM 

3636
01:58:31,837 --> 01:58:32,905
DOES NOT MATTER VERY MUCH. 

3637
01:58:32,905 --> 01:58:34,774
THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO 

3638
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:39,645
VISIBILITY OF IT OR ALMOST NO 

3639
01:58:39,645 --> 01:58:40,846
VISIBILITY IN THE WATER IS A 

3640
01:58:40,846 --> 01:58:42,047
SHAME, BUT IT'S NOT A SERIOUS 

3641
01:58:42,047 --> 01:58:42,347
PROBLEM. 

3642
01:58:42,347 --> 01:58:43,416
THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT THEY 

3643
01:58:43,416 --> 01:58:44,316
HAVE TO BE COMFORTABLE 

3644
01:58:44,316 --> 01:58:44,616
UNDERWATER. 

3645
01:58:44,616 --> 01:58:45,518
THESE BOYS HAVE TO BE 

3646
01:58:45,518 --> 01:58:46,586
COMFORTABLE UNDERWATER. 

3647
01:58:46,586 --> 01:58:48,387
NEVER HAVING BEEN WITH SCUBA 

3648
01:58:48,387 --> 01:58:50,122
GEAR ON BEFORE, TO PUT THEM 

3649
01:58:50,122 --> 01:58:52,191
UNDERWATER, LIKE THAT, IS 

3650
01:58:52,191 --> 01:59:05,338
OBVIOUSLY A STRESSFUL SITUATION.

3651
01:59:05,338 --> 01:59:06,806
I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY ARE 

3652
01:59:06,806 --> 01:59:07,573
YOUNG GUYS IS HELPFUL. 

3653
01:59:07,573 --> 01:59:08,407
ONE, THEY ARE SMALL. 

3654
01:59:08,407 --> 01:59:09,575
THEY GET THROUGH THE SMALL 

3655
01:59:09,575 --> 01:59:10,643
PLACES EASIER THAN THE LARGER 

3656
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:10,876
PERSON. 

3657
01:59:10,876 --> 01:59:11,978
THEY CAN BE MANHANDLED BY THE 

3658
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:14,280
DIVERS WITH THEM EASIER THAN A 

3659
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:14,547
LARGER%. 

3660
01:59:14,547 --> 01:59:15,715
THEY HAVE NOT GOT THE LIFE 

3661
01:59:15,715 --> 01:59:17,150
EXPERIENCE, SO THEY PROBABLY DO 

3662
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,451
NOT FULLY REALIZE THE EXTREME 

3663
01:59:18,451 --> 01:59:20,452
DANGER THAT THEY ARE IN. 

3664
01:59:20,452 --> 01:59:32,031
THOSE THINGS ARE FACTORS IN THE 

3665
01:59:32,031 --> 01:59:32,431
RIGHT DIRECTION. 

3666
01:59:32,431 --> 01:59:33,966
THE FACT THAT THEY GOT IN THERE 

3667
01:59:33,966 --> 01:59:35,034
TO START WITH SHOWS THAT THESE 

3668
01:59:35,034 --> 01:59:36,269
ARE PRETTY ADVENTUROUS KIDS. 

3669
01:59:36,269 --> 01:59:36,902
THEY GOT IN THIS PROBLEM 

3670
01:59:36,902 --> 01:59:38,404
BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING OVER 

3671
01:59:38,404 --> 01:59:38,871
ADVENTUROUS. 

3672
01:59:38,871 --> 01:59:47,680
THEY HAVE GOT TO BE OVER 

3673
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:48,648
ADVENTUROUS TO GET THEMSELVES 

3674
01:59:48,648 --> 01:59:48,848
OUT. 

3675
01:59:48,848 --> 01:59:49,916
>> THEY HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE 

3676
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:50,616
FOR A FORTNIGHT. 

3677
01:59:50,616 --> 01:59:51,817
THEY ARE IN A PRETTY WEAK 

3678
01:59:51,817 --> 01:59:52,050
STATE. 

3679
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:53,252
THEY HAVE BEEN FED SINCE THEY 

3680
01:59:53,252 --> 01:59:53,685
HAVE BEEN FOUND. 

3681
01:59:53,685 --> 01:59:55,021
BUT GOING INTO THE WATER, WHAT 

3682
01:59:55,021 --> 01:59:56,022
IS THE PRIMARY CONCERN FOR 

3683
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:57,256
SOMEBODY HAT IS TRYING TO GET 

3684
01:59:57,256 --> 01:59:58,124
THE BOYS OUT SAFELY? 

3685
01:59:58,124 --> 01:59:59,058
>> THE ABSOLUTE PRIMARY CONCERN 

3686
01:59:59,058 --> 02:00:01,360
WILL BE TO TRY AND KEEP THEM 

3687
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,695
CALM AND GIVE THEM EVERY 

3688
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:05,364
ASSURANCE THAT THEY POSSIBLY CAN

3689
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:07,333
THAT THEY WILL BE IN SAFE HANDS 

3690
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:09,669
UNDERWATER. 

3691
02:00:09,669 --> 02:00:10,970
THE BIGGEST DANGER THAT THEY 

3692
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:27,720
HAVE BY A LONG WAY IS PANIC. 

3693
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:29,188
IF THEY CAN JUST KEEP COOL AND 

3694
02:00:29,188 --> 02:00:30,356
CALM, THEY WILL GET OUT SAFELY. 

3695
02:00:30,356 --> 02:00:31,524
THE GEAR WILL BE GOOD. 

3696
02:00:31,524 --> 02:00:32,825
I MEAN, THE GEAR WILL HAVE BEEN 

3697
02:00:32,825 --> 02:00:33,959
VETTED BY THE TEAM AT DIVERS, 

3698
02:00:33,959 --> 02:00:35,294
AND IT WILL BE THE BEST 

3699
02:00:35,294 --> 02:00:36,028
AVAILABLE AND VERY RELIABLE. 

3700
02:00:36,028 --> 02:00:37,230
THEY WILL HAVE THE BEST SYSTEM 

3701
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:38,230
THAT THEY CAN POSSIBLY HAVE. 

3702
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:39,498
THE CAVE DIVERS ARE THE BEST 

3703
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:40,700
THAT THERE ARE IN THE WORLD. 

3704
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:41,867
EVERYTHING IS GOOD AS LONG AS 

3705
02:00:41,867 --> 02:00:43,035
THE BOYS DO NOT PANIC. 

3706
02:00:43,035 --> 02:00:51,877
THE GREAT DANGER IS THEM OVER 

3707
02:00:51,877 --> 02:00:52,143
WORRYING. 

3708
02:00:52,143 --> 02:00:53,679
AND AS I SAY, THERE ARE A LOT 

3709
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:55,014
OF SIGNS TO SUGGEST THAT THEY 

3710
02:00:55,014 --> 02:00:56,248
ARE IN A REALLY GOOD FRAME OF 

3711
02:00:56,248 --> 02:00:57,917
MIND TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS. 

3712
02:00:57,917 --> 02:00:59,318
IT IS A GREAT TRIBUTE TO THIS 

3713
02:00:59,318 --> 02:01:00,353
FOOTBALL TEAM THAT THEY ARE 

3714
02:01:00,353 --> 02:01:11,163
ABLE TO DO THAT. 

3715
02:01:11,163 --> 02:01:12,164
THEY ARE FIT, YOUNG, NOT 

3716
02:01:12,164 --> 02:01:12,431
WORRYING. 

3717
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:12,998
THAT IS GREAT. 

3718
02:01:12,998 --> 02:01:13,666
THAT IS WONDERFUL. 

3719
02:01:13,666 --> 02:01:14,900
I AM VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT, IN 

3720
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:16,335
THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL GET 

3721
02:01:16,335 --> 02:01:16,802
THEM ALL OUT. 

3722
02:01:16,802 --> 02:01:18,003
IT DEPENDS ON THE WEATHER. 

3723
02:01:18,003 --> 02:01:18,603
THE WEATHER IS ABSOLUTELY 

3724
02:01:18,603 --> 02:01:19,305
CRITICAL IN THIS. 

3725
02:01:19,305 --> 02:01:20,373
IT WILL NOT BE RUSHED. 

3726
02:01:20,373 --> 02:01:21,306
WHETHER THEY CAN BRING MORE 

3727
02:01:21,306 --> 02:01:22,975
THAN FOUR OUT A DAY, I DON'T 

3728
02:01:22,975 --> 02:01:23,208
KNOW.  

3729
02:01:23,208 --> 02:01:24,443
CLEARLY THAT IS GOING TO TAKE 

3730
02:01:24,443 --> 02:01:26,111
ANOTHER THREE DAYS IF THEY CAN 

3731
02:01:26,111 --> 02:01:27,813
ONLY BRING FOUR HOURS. 

3732
02:01:27,813 --> 02:01:30,682
THEY MUST NOT RUN ANY OF THE 

3733
02:01:30,682 --> 02:01:34,220
DANGERS THAT COULD BE TEMPTING, 

3734
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:36,689
LIKE PUTTING MORE RESCUE DIVERS 

3735
02:01:36,689 --> 00:00:00,000
IN WHO HAVE NOT
