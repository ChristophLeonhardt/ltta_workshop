Richard Dawkins is no friend to conservatives the atheist author spent much of his life to ride in Judaism Christianity he once said that an atheist is called just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the Golden Calf Dawkins says that even moderate religious people quote make the world safe for extremists he's fired the left on politics he's from or ssin a supporter of the Labour Party and Liberal Democratic Party in Britain but he is also smart enough to recognize that radical Islam is a greater threat to human life than Christianity or Judaism Dawkins explains quote I have criticized the appalling misogyny and homophobia of Islam I have criticized the murdering of apostates for no crime other than their disbelief Muslims themselves are the prime victims of the oppressive cruelties of Islamism such language of course makes him a pariah among leftist this week Dawkins was scheduled to speak at an event with KPFA in Brooklyn California all went swimmingly until leftist realized Dawkins had said some untoward things about Islam then they canceled the speech citing his quote/unquote abusive speech they explained quote we had booked this event based entirely on his excellent new book on science when we didn't know he had offended and hurt in his tweets and other comments on his on so many people KPFA does not endorse hurtful speech this is no shock the same left that barred Dawkins from his Berkley event shared this week while Palestinian Arabs riot over metal detectors at the Temple Mount those leftists proclaimed but the true obstacle to peace in the Middle East isn't Palestinian air violence isn't Palestinians who stabbed his railey Druze police officers on the stem on the Temple Mount or Palestinians who invade homes and slaughter old men and women or the Palestinians and government who cheer honor and financially support such behavior nope the problem is the Jews the same elected blames metal detectors for murderous assaults and Richard Dawkins for offending Islam makes excuses for radical Muslim and women's March organizer Linda Sarsour who is called for apostate Muslims to have their genitals removed who says the Zionists cannot be feminists and who stands up for terrorists and terrorist orders so why do the let's seek to support radical Islam so ardently well because the left believes it's a quickest way to destroy Western civilization is no longer class warfare the multi cultural warfare simply allied with groups that hate the prevailing system and work with them to take it down then the left will build on the ashes of the old system in this view Dawkins is an opponent how can left recruit Muslims to fight the same system if Dawkins is to be alienating them they support the Palestinian terror regime how can that colonialist output without Israel be defeated without a little blood a flawed star sewer she's an allies that means she must be backed alliance with nefarious forces cause your own morality into question KPFA has a lot more to answer for than Dawkins but the left will never have to answer such questions so long as they focus in on their common enemy a supposedly conservative establishment that must be fought with any tool at their disposal i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show okay so we have a lot to talk about in Trump Ville today so president Trump is obviously attacking the Attorney General Sessions Sessions is saying that he is not going to go without being pushed out the door we'll talk about what that means plus the Senate Republicans are finally going to vote on some form of care we don't know exactly what that is yet but it appears to vote to proceed on some form of Obamacare change is going to happen so we'll talk about that as well Democrats in confusion plus Trump talks to a bunch of children at the Boy Scouts and it goes weird we'll talk about all those things before we do that first I want to say thank

General Jeff Sessions he has decided to make Jeff Sessions the focus of designer why well not because Jeff Sessions is doing a terrible job in fact by most accounts he's doing a pretty good job particularly on immigration if there's anything that can be said about Jeff Sessions that he's too ardent with regard to the civil forfeiture the attempt to grab property after an arrest but before a conviction right there he's wrong but everything else Jeff Sessions has been doing a pretty good job as Attorney General I haven't seen any problems with Jeff Sessions but Trump sees one big problem and that is determining General Sessions obviously has not done enough to protect Donald Trump Trump has gotten to the point where he is starting to see everything in terms of how it affects him personally not his presidency him personally and so this morning him leashed a series of nasty tweets about Jeff Sessions so he tweeted quote Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign quietly working to boost Clinton so where is the investigation AG and then he said Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes where our emails in DNC server and Intel leakers then he said problem is the acting head of the FBI and the person in charge of the Hillary investigation Andrew McCabe got seven hundred thousand dollars from Hillary for wife so now he's attacking the Deputy Attorney General oh we're sorry the acting ahead of the FBI so just to put this all in perspective in the first six months of the Trump administration inspired Mike Flynn supposedly for lying to vice president pence that's not really why that happened he's fired the FBI director James Comey and said openly and it's because of Comey handling of the Russian stuff he is now threatening Attorney General Sessions he has threatened his Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein and that New York Times interview last week he has attacked the acting head of the FBI and his attack the special counsel so what do all these people have in common they're all involved in the in the Russia investigation all people who he's tapped or has or has said that he wants to cap he is now put to the side he did they're all involved in the Russian investigation which says one of two things either that Trump is a narcissist when it comes to this Russia thing he was really bothered by it it bothers him in a significant way and he just wants to end it by getting rid of anyone who has failed to shut it down or who continues to pursue it or he has nothing to hide right those are really the only two choices there is no choice three so either this is pathological narcissism or this is krump has something to hide now I tend to believe it's pathological narcissism and again I've said before my entire theory here is the Trump really hasn't done anything wrong and he's ticked that everybody isn't just stopping this nonsense already and so he wants to fire everyone but let's be straight about Jeff Sessions here okay Jeff Sessions is not responsible for this Jeff Sessions only recused himself because in his own testimony he said that he never had a meeting with Russians it turned out he had a meeting with Ambassador surrogate kis lyac so he recused himself that happened long after he was nominated and approved for the position the actual recusal and there's no way for him know that this stuff was really going to come up it doesn't make a lot of sense plus Jeff Sessions is the lifeline he is the the the hardwiring into the nationalist populist movement that Trump likes to talk so much about and from which he draws to support sessions is the font head for the anti-immigration movement that Trump supposedly represents so this doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense oh there are a few things that I want to say about all this first of all scaramouche me the Anthony's care moved to the new chief staff he's not to staff yet but he may well be the head of communications for Donald Trump he was on to Hewitt's show this morning and he basically said yes Trump wants Jeff Sessions to resign here's what the muj had to say ah the president's been tweeting this morning Trey awareness why not Evan why not just fire jeff Sessions well listen I mean you know I think the president has a certain style certain skill set he's obviously frustrated I said yesterday I think the Sarah Marie maybe the two of them to get together my guess is the president but doesn't want to do that and so I think it's going to I think him and Jeff or sorry Attorney General Sessions need to work this thing out they can all hear that does it want some gun I have enormous amount of respect for the Attorney General but I do know the president pretty well and there's this level of tension in the relationship that that's that's public you're probably right but I don't want to speak for the President on that because use a cabinet official I sort of think that has to be between the president United States and the cabinet official so scared Lucci says I don't know what is going to do by Yackey shorter he sort of should go so there are a bunch of questions your number one why Trump doesn't just fire him there is a rumor today the Trump was doing this just because this is what trunk does meaning that he got rid of Comey most humiliating way possible he fired tamales on the west coast speaking to a bunch of FBI fidex and and then he saw it on TV - now he's doing the same thing to Jeff Sessions again the problem here is that Sessions himself is pretty popular with the right wing of the Republican Party especially because of immigration issues and that reputation is well-deserved so let's talk about some of the the problems here number one President tough climate ballsy over here he is he's going to fire sessions he should just fire session so he made his entire career I'm going to fire people but instead he's giving sessions the runaround why because you want sessions to resign he wants sessions to do it on his own he doesn't want to fire sessions because for some reason from think that if you openly pressure sessions to quit and then sessions quit the blowback will come back to trump that somehow sessions will be blamed for that I don't know where he's getting that idea but it's foolish if sessions quits at this point no one's going to blame him everybody's going to blame Trump second point this is a very dangerous it's a very dangerous president that's being set by the Trump by by the current White House and that is if you're not obsequious enough to President Trump or if you don't spend your entire career capital trying to support President Trump in every single way then you should throw you out scatter Lucci said something else in this Hewitt interview he said Eric Holder acted as a goalie for President Obama we need somebody who's going to act as a goalie for President Trump that's really not the job of the Attorney General and just because Eric Holder's did the wrong thing doesn't mean that Jeff Sessions should either Sarah Moochie of all people shouldn't be talking about this considering be tweeted just a few months ago that he was in favor of sessions we're accusing himself but this is kind of nasty tenor that's come to the Trump White House which is if you don't scrape and bow before Trump obsequious ly enough then he's going to behead you Joffrey style really really unpleasant right Sean Spicer wasn't just out that he was humiliated Trump refused to take him on that tour of the Vatican even though Spicer's a lifelong Catholic very ardent Catholic and wanted to meet the Pope and Trump left him behind yesterday Trump was speaking to the Boy Scouts he brought virtually all of the Eagle Scouts and his administration to this event he left Jeff Sessions at home and the third point here Trump right now is supposed to be pushing it Healthcare will talk about front pushing health care in just a minute immediately after he tweeted all this stuff about Jeff Sessions he fired off a bunch of Tweety tweeted big day for health care after seven years of talking we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to place Obamacare's torturing the american people etc et-cetera well that should be the entire message room today should it not and that way when the senate votes as it did i believe to proceed on a motion to proceed on some form of trump care bill then hank when victory you can say look it was me right instead all the headlines they're going to be about jeff sessions and that is Trump's own fault that is Trump's own fault and there's no way to escape that ok another point here and this is the big one I think and the reason that you're seeing a split in among conservatives about Trump doing this stuff like there wasn't a big split among conservatives about Trump firing coming yeah I said the Trump shirt of fired call me I was fine with Trump firing coming I just thought that his excuse for doing so it was stupid and problematic but firing Comey itself I didn't see any problem with firing session a lot of people including Breitbart which is been a cheerleader for Trump all the way through britt hume who really likes trump unboxit all all the people on the right are now saying sessions is a bridge too far there's a reason for this and the reason for that is the Jeff Sessions is a deeply conservative down when it comes to immigration so story time a few years back I'm about three years ago there was a horowitz Freedom Center event and this Horowitz Freedom Center event essentially included a dinner and after the dinner after the dinner there was a drinking a late-night drinking session it was basically a bunch of people hanging around by the end of the night the only people who are hanging around or me and Jeff Sessions and and a bunch of sorry me Jeff Sessions Stephen Miller and and Ann Coulter that was the entire drinking session as four of us and we were sitting around the only topic that was discussed the entire evening was immigration and it was very clear that this was the working group for what would become the Trump administration in fact later you've been in my former boss over Breitbart would apparently commissioned a white paper in 2015 from Coulter and Miller and Noah at that time was an aide to session and sessions for a for an immigration policy and so a lot of the idea is that that made Trump President a lot of the immigration I did the made current President came directly from Jeff Sessions in fact Jeff Sessions said to me at the time at the center he said that he was looking for a candidate to support in the Republican race who had embraced his immigration program Trump was that man in fact sessions is one of the first people on board with this whole thing sessions is one of the first people to endorse Trump right much earlier than anybody else now Trump is turning around crapping all over him because he doesn't like what he's doing on Russia what's being had what's happening right now is basically everybody who wants policy inside the Trump administration is being sidelined in favor of people who show personal loyalty to Trump so spice our foreign policy out rights once policy sidelines and influence policy sidelines sessions once policy sidelined all the people who actually want conservative policy currently are being sidelined in favor of Jared navona personal loyalty to Trump scaramouche II personal loyalty to Trump Geary code and personal loyalty to Trump a lot of people who are really Democrats who have a lot of personal loyalty to Trump and Trump is surrounding himself with those people getting rid of sessions would be a disaster area because that basically mean the only person he's going to appoint this attorney general is somebody who's in a vow to fire to him who's going to vow to fire the special counsel if the special counsel is fired you're going to see all hell break loose in Washington DC it doesn't mean impeachment at least not right now it does mean that you're going to see a lot of kickback from Senate Republicans and Trump's agenda completely stalls final points on the sessions thing and then I want to talk about some other topics a president Trump in the industry storm about sessions once again he uses Hillary Clinton as his excuse I grow tired and weary of this routine okay Hillary Clinton is vanquished by President Trump Thank You president Trump thank you for that we don't have Hillary Clinton as our president and for that I am eternally grateful now she's gone stop it enough okay she's not important anymore okay the fact is that you're not angry with Jeff Sessions because of Hillary Clinton just like you weren't angry FBI director Comey over Hillary Clinton this is all just red meat for rubes okay people who believe that that President Trump is actually angry too Jeff Sessions over Hillary Clinton that's nonsense okay it was President Trump who instructed Jeff Sessions and everybody who's investigating to leave the Clinton family alone back in December this is public okay there wasn't there was no secret about this so this notion that he just throws out Hillary Clinton's name and we're all supposed to just bow before his wishes it's really silly okay Hillary has nothing to do with this he'll already may well deserve to be prosecuted I'd be fine with prosecuting Hillary Clinton oh that would be very difficult now that Trump is basically tainted the entire jury pool of the United States but you know I'm fine with that but to pretend that that's what the sessions thing is about that is just an excuse everybody knows the real thing that's happening here is he kicked that sessions will act as he shield on Russia and so he's acting out against sessions this is a pretty stark litmus test for a lot of conservatives are you going to stand with the president getting rid of an actual conservative on his key issue immigration inside his cabinet for no reason reason other than personal peek there is another reason it's just see that okay are you gonna stand with that because come from from from Trump or are you going to say mr. president you want to get the policy done we do too you want to see this Russia investigation thing comes to a good close we do too it can't fire the Attorney General who helps get you there and who has been me stalwart on the key issue in your campaign again is not me saying this alone this is even his greatest allies like Breitbart are saying this sort of thing so you know this is not anything new but again I think that it goes to a character problem that Trump has and that is that he's so ensconced in his own narcissism he is he's so pathologically narcissistic that he's willing to fire even the people who are his friends the only friends he has left their family at this point that's really not a good way to run the operation sessions for his set for his own sake he says I'm not leaving he says if Trump wants to fire me he's going to have to fire me which by the way is a good conservative move gave Trump wants to own this let Trump own it don't let him off the hook make fire jeff Sessions we need Jeff Sessions in place not for civil asset forfeiture but we need Jeff Sessions in place for immigration we need Jeff Sessions in place for for for application of the law we need him in place his strength in the police there are a thousand reasons the Jeff Sessions @ag is a good thing for the conservative movement but you know him him being forced out by Trump is just a disaster okay so I want to talk about Trump at the Boy Scouts is actually more hilarious than it was upsetting but what is there a upset about this I want to talk about why I was laughing at it but first or if they thank you to our sponsors over at math Weldon so Matt Weldon is better than whatever you are wearing right now they make undergarments they make underwear socks shirts undershirts hoodie sweatpants all become for wear that you actually spend most of your life in when you're not at the office and even under the office

eliminate odor and they want you to be comfortable so if you don't like your first pair you can keep it and we'll still refund you no question at they look they perform well too one of my pet peeves

and check them out and use promo code Shapiro so that they know that we sent you all right so when Trump isn't busy trying to fire his Attorney General for no apparent reason the Trump is speaking with the Boy Scouts but I want to get to that in just a second first I want discuss what's happening on the floor of the Senate so the latest on the floor of the Senate is the Senate is going to vote on a motion to proceed on something we don't know what that something is we don't know what exactly it's supposed to be we do know that the that the that there's good shot that 51 senators are going to are going to vote in favor of some sort of saying right they're going to vote in favor of some sort of things so there's there some things that's happened one 51 senators have to vote on a motion to proceed that means they will take up the House version of Obamacare replacement and then we actually have to pass a bill so the key vote is this one because once you get past that then it's just a question of hashing out the details now it could still fall apart it could be the detail suck we don't know the answer to that but Trump is bringing on the pressure and this is what Trump is doing something good this is what Trump should be focused on so yesterday Trump was out there something on Obama care and he said Obamacare is death okay third up here he is president Trump using the power of his presidential bully pulpit against the backdrop of the Blue Room and the faces of what the White House calls the victims of Obamacare it was a big fat ugly lie with doom and gloom declarations the president railed against the law of the land not surprisingly swiping at Democrats they run out they say death death death well Obamacare is death okay so that's fair enough from President Trump and he was pushing very hard he's complimenting Senator McCain who he's not always been more with Senator McCain just showed up on the Senate floor and gave a speech that is being hailed by a lot of people with regard to President Trump and with regard to the Republican handling of Obamacare in the house or in the Senate and I'm sure we'll have more clips of that tomorrow for you because sort of big moment Trump also is attempting to push senators says the senators who don't vote for whatever this is no no this is yet but who don't vote for this on Obamacare is a push they want to forget about the countless Americans they've heard and the many that they are continuing to hurt every day by refusing to help us replace Obamacare for the last seven years Republicans have been united in standing up for Obama cares victims remember repeal and replace repeal and replace they kept saying it over and over again every Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law we as a party must fulfill that solemn promise to the voters of this country to repeal and replace what they've been saying for the last seven years but so far Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare okay so you know Trump putting putting the the pressure on his on his fellow Republicans in the Senate McCain basically called for bipartisanship and we will see if he votes in favor of the the motion to proceed so we'll give you all the updates on that as it comes in Trump is doing the right thing and putting pressure on the Senate to take this up big question is going to be what's in that bill what's in that bill it is not sufficient just to pass any bill and I know that you're going to hear a lot from from Republican partisans today saying well they have to vote for something okay well it depends on what the something is do you even want to own Obamacare and put the GOP stamp of approval on it right now what they're talking about is something I'm calling skinny repeal okay which is again just their branding effort is spectacular skinnier repeal would apparently begin getting rid of the individual mandate I don't think it gets I don't think it reinforces the the new version of the mandate but getting rid of the individual mandate getting rid of some of the taxes getting rid of the employer may it gets rid of the funding mechanism for Obamacare in other words that would exacerbate steps spiral and then the Republicans would have to come up with some new legislation to deal with the fallout from that which presumably they would do in another bill after they pass this one so that's not a terrible strategy as far as it goes but we'll talk more about that plus Trump spoke at the Boy Scouts it was pretty hilarious we'll talk about that in just a second but for that I'm gonna have to go over to daily wire comm and subscribe for $9.99 a month you can subscribe to daily wire yes you you the person listening right

later go to iTunes or SoundCloud subscribe leave the sérgio we always appreciate it we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation okay so yesterday president from spoke at the at the boys couch and he's getting all sorts of flack from the left for speaking at the Boy Scouts because Trump went there and it was pretty ridiculous he treated the Boy Scouts like it was a typical political rally Chuck Todd was particularly sad Chuck Todd tweeted out how dare President Trump Jesus it please presidents don't put the Boy Scouts in this situation keep politics out of the Jamboree what a mess totally unfair to these kids okay so before I begin with the with the critique of Trump let me just say this I have grounds to stand on in critiquing Trump with regard to the sack or dissemination of the Boy Scouts that's because I haven't said that the Boy Scouts should be mandatorily forced to open to girls okay the entire left has said that the Boy Scouts should allow transgender boys meaning girls who believe they are boys into the Boy Scouts and the entire left has suggested that the Boy Scouts should be removed of their IRS 501c3 status if they do not allow gays Scout masters and gay scouts as you need people talk about their sexuality in the Boy Scouts now so the less doesn't have any ground when they talk about the sacrosanct Boy Scouts we must protect them okay I'm not going to take that crap for a bunch of people who have been trying to destroy the Boy Scouts for nigh on two decades can that's stuff I'm going to wash anyway so Trump does speak in front of the Boy Scouts and it is pretty wild so first of all as the Boy Scouts were chanting that they love Trump and people in the media can't understand this may be the reason for that is a lot of the people who are in the Boy Scouts have evangelical parents come from conservative areas here's some tape of the Boy Scouts chanting that they like Trump by the way just a question did President Obama ever come to a Jamboree okay so Trump being Trump doing his rally routine I am going out there and saying and politicizing we can't just accept the phrase yes to riff on President Obama at the same time then it is really funny he says to Tom Price Health and Human Services Secretary part of a bunch of children because people who are aged 12 to 18 they're Tom Price doesn't get to vote on Trump care then he'll fire him which is it's just great to threaten to fire everyone in your cabinet the same way good good process here by the way you're going to get the votes hey you better get them they better get it oh you bet otherwise they'll say Tom you're fired I'll get somebody okay he threatens to fire him and then he threatens Jeff Sessions so this is really kind of garbage this is you know a garbage way to act so is a bunch of children remember and President Trump who shows up and Jeff Sessions is an Eagle Scout by the way right he not invited to this right all the other girl scouts are there not Jeff Sessions and he implies that Jeff Sessions is disloyal to him okay so he's reading the Boy Scout Oath okay the Boy Scout Oath is sort of the opposite of trumps personal creative duty and so he starts reading it and he just breaks it in the middle to make a snide reference about Jeff Sessions unbelievable great Boy Scouts become great great Americans as the Scout law says a scout is trustworthy loyal we could use some more loyalty I won't tell you that okay and then the rest of the crowd continues on with the oath because they all know the oh I love that he's ripping Jeff Sessions in the middle of that and it's pretty amazing so well well done just well done by the way breaking news from The Wall Street Journal Trump is now saying to The Wall Street Journal accessions who's the only senator to endorse from the primaries did so because of big crowds not loyalty which is insane okay I know senator sessions that's absolute garbage and here is Trump ripping him in front of a bunch of children the best moment of this was where Trump who legitimately at this point is starting like in front a bunch of kids pirated this would sound like my daughter and grandfather you know drunk around campfire starting to tell a story about the old days here is Donald Trump telling children remembered their kids a story about life and developers in New York City what in the world and he said yes I would he so badly wanted to get bored with this life of yachts and sailing and all of the things he did in the South of France and other places you won't get bored right you know truthfully your workers you'll get bored too believe me of course having a few good years like that isn't so bad but what happened is he bought back his company and he bought back a lot of empty land and he worked hard and getting it zoning and he worked hard and starting to develop and in the end he failed that he failed badly lost all of his money he went personally bankrupt and he was now much older and I saw him at a cocktail party and it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party was the party of Steve Ross Steve Ross who was one of the great people he came up and discovered really founded Time Warner and he was a great guy had a lot of successful people that the party what is he talking and I was doing well so I got invited to the party I was very young what in the world and all the kids are like um grandpa your hearing aid what what my favorite part of the speech is where he said that we beat Hillary Clinton thanks to people getting out and voting like you most of the people that are under 18 so if we're going to investigate voter fraud and all the Boy Scouts are voting that's problem okay so the media is going nuts over this of course the media goes nuts over everything they've decided that this is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of American politics again I'm not willing to hear that from the same media that's been ripping the Boy Scouts up and down and trying to destroy them is it appropriate for firm to do this of course not are we used to Trump doing inappropriate things yes this is the least of my concerns it's also semi charming and ridiculous but the President of the United States is getting up there like my grandpa on depends you know getting up there and telling stories irrelevant stories about his days in the schemata business like what in the world so with all this craziness going unfortunately we have a second party that's intelligent and with it and really cares about you no no we don't actually turns out that's the Democratic Party says been in giant fail so I love this the Democrats are still trying to figure out what their messages well they have no clue but their messages so Chuck Schumer he came out yesterday and he said you know it seems that people don't get our message this is the Senate Minority Leader people don't get I think the problem is people may get your message actually here's Schumer on the message week after week month after month we're going to roll out specific pieces here that are quite different than the Democratic Party you heard in the past we were too cautious we were too namby-pamby this is sharp bold and will appeal them to both the old Obama coalition let's say the young lady who's just getting out of college and the Democratic voters who deserted us for Trump the blue collar workers I'm a whiter dynamics George is our strength someday we are going to go Matt it okay again just amazing like they think they've really got it in control this time we're going to this time we're really going to push our message but here's the problem there's an inherent contradiction in the Democratic message as we have talked about they're two separate wings of the Democratic Party fighting for sentence right now wing number one the intersectional wing right the idea that the Barack Obama wing of the party we're going to cobble together all of these various identity groups and they will come together and then once they have come together they will form majority and they will push legislation right is Obama's theory but we have to first separate them out in the groups and then pander to each group as necessary and call white people racists in order to provide a common point of opposition that's group number one group number two is the Bernie Sanders socialist okay we're not so into the intersectionality we just like big government we need big government solutions socialism works for everyone socialism wipes out all of the distinctions between colors and ethnicities and religions just more socialism for everybody these are an open conflict Schumer says we don't need to choose we can do both not so much it's a false choice there doesn't have to be a division in fact there must not be a division the vision we're laying out unites both coalition's and unifies the Democratic Party it will have a larger stronger appeal to Americans of all economic levels and all political stripes it will appeal to the young women who just graduated from college in Los Angeles the factory worker in Akron who's now only making $11 an hour and the single mom in Buffalo cleaning toilets on minimum wage okay so this is you know actually it's going to be very difficult for you to bridge that gap considering the one half of your party hates the other half of your party you're gonna lose the blue-collar voters so long as you insist on making white males the object of all of your ire in order to unify the rest of your multicultural base so fortunately we have two parties that are in full disarray not just one again it looks like the Republicans may be able to pass something through the Senate let's see what it is I'm optimistic that maybe it'll make some good changes and I would give you my evaluation of a bill once we've seen it because this process has been hot garbage thus far you know the attempts you spin out a bill without anyone having seen it because to mystery I'm not a fan of this I'm kind of transparency I'm old enough to remember when the Republicans ran on the promise that any piece of legislation be up for three full days so people could read it before there is any sort of vote on it now we put that by the wayside because hopefully if people just don't know what's in any bill we can ram it through really best we'll find out what's in it tomorrow hopefully and I will have some sort of synopsis for you on that okay before I get the things I like things I hate in some deconstruction of the culture I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supplies so right now if you are concerned about the possibility of some sort of natural disasters and some even a brownout you know some situation where you can't get to the grocery store and there's and there's problem getting access to food then you really need to talk to my friends over my Patriot supply that's why I depend on them to help prepare me and my crew for survival with their incredible survival food they have a survival food supply for just $99 which includes one hundred and two

should be safe for a while and and that can take you through some dangerous times if God forbid something happens between you two go to my patreon supply and check them out prepare with been calm okay so time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like so at the end of Dunkirk one of the great choices one of the great directorial choices the Christopher Nolan the director makes is that he doesn't use the music of Hans Zimmer at the very end who's kind of normal composer instead he uses some music by Edward Elgar Edward Elgar is a very famous British composer he's most famous for writing pomp and circumstance so everybody knows music he's been real graduation that's Edward Elgar very famous music so I wanted to do the today some music that's used in movies that is not actually moving music it's actually just classical music used in other movies so this is most famous for being used venues and bunch of movies but it's most famous for being used in platoon in the scene where Willem Dafoe's character is being shot you hear this come over the you hear this come over the soundtrack it's Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings one of the more beautiful pieces ever composed and here's what it sounds like you this piece is composed in 1936 by again Samuel Barber it was played on the announcement over radio that FDR was dead it was played and they when when it was announced that JFK was dead on television it was played it appeared in just a ton of movies the Elephant Man platoon lorenzo le i thought it was from Lorenzo's oil it's been played to comic effect even inside the Pope actually in episode Simpsons in South Park it's been played so often now that people actually use it as a joke right but it's um it's a great piece very effective and very affecting and Samuel Barber is one of the great modern American composers that 1981 I mean 1910 to 1981 and he has a lot of terrific music that's what's in it too okay other things that I like so everybody is focused in on Kid Rock running for Senate in Michigan that's of course because Kid Rock is super famous he sold 14 million records he is extraordinarily popular he's done this routine where he makes sure that all the tickets that are sold for his concerts have to be twenty dollars or less so he's a populist but there's somebody who's better qualified running for that same Senate seat is name is John James and here is an ad for John James running for office in Michigan I'm a Republican because I'm conservative specifically the exceptionalism of our country and our Constitution and they must be defended I'm pro-gun I understand that James Madison wrote this document and listed the number two thing behind religion speech and the right to assemble the right to keep in their arms it's that important I believe that life begins at conception it's a god-given miracle Michigan deserves a leader who's lived in the real world who understands national security who understands how to provide economic opportunity because they've actually created jobs Michigan deserves a leader to make sure that everyone has a fair shot you do that by understanding economic opportunity and by understanding national security because you don't do both in our future will not be as bright as it can be I'm John James and I'm exploring along the USS okay so this guy would be a rock star in a Republican Party in the pre celebrity here this guy is a former military guys US Marine he's 36 years old he is black he is the CEO of Renaissance global logistics which is a logistics and warehousing firm based in Detroit he is basically the perfect candidate right I mean he's articulate and and as Joe Biden might say brighten articulate but obviously he's a smart guy with terrific record and and just a great cam and we're doing the interview with him over at Daily wire to check it out we need more candidates like that we need more Congress people like that I understand the thrill of celebrity and I understand why everybody is interested in celebrity but I mean come on folks at some point we're going to need to actually nominate people who have a deeply conservative streak who know what policies they care about and who have a history of running businesses and dealing with communities and celebrity politics is not my bag and I'm getting kind of tired of it okay other things okay so let's do some one quick thing I hate and then we'll get deconstructing the culture so the thing I hate this week is that every everyday on Huffington Post there is some insane thing where somebody does something crazy or insane and then Huffington Post says this person is crushing a stereotype by doing a crazy thing so here's what it is this time okay barcelona-based since that birth control uses paint and whitter to highlight parts and functions of the body women have been conditioned to feel ashamed of like stretch marks and menstruation so now if you have stretch mark she's painting it she's a vibrant rainbow of colors to highlight stretch marks on the skin and to show the beauty of menstruation on underwear sanitary pads and tampons she's hope PopSugar it started with her own journey toward self-love any time anyone has to tell you about their journey toward self-love they're a jerk okay like I don't want to hear about your journey toward self-love it's your business not mine not interested just she it says I've not always felt comfortable with my period and stretch marks she said TMI gang well when did this phrase TMI go out of style that sort of like at this TMI phrase the overall I've not always felt secure with my body over the years and after internal reflection I saw that if I did not accept anything about my body hair stretch marks I could never love or accept me really why why pet you love or accept you with your flaws or do you have to why can't you love like certain things about your body but not other things like if we all love being overweight we'd all stay overweight another thing you should like cultivate a hatred for your own body god forbid but I don't know why you taking pictures of like the parts of yourself that nobody really wants to see is is is a beneficial thing why that is a worthwhile thing to do she says she paints underwear and she paints stretch marks and it says you'll never look at your body the same way again and say so then there's a picture of a sanitary pad with glitter on it it is so beautiful mmm-hmm that's also what happens when my three year old daughter gets hold of the sanitary pads and takes it into dates and takes it into her craft room so I'm not sure why this qualifies you to be some sort of artistic genius but everything must be cheered now up to and including bodily functions I'm looking forward to the male response which is painting your poop and that'll be that'll be really fun painting your bowel movements painting your beer-bellied I have never felt comfortable with my beer belly but now I've painted in all the colors of the rainbow and given it a frog map okay okay times deconstruct a little bit of culture we need to leave that behind and move on with our lives and deconstruct the culture so one of the things that's been bugging me this week is that all of these actors are now suggesting that it is very very very very important that movies that are aimed at children and entertainment pieces contain all sorts of political messaging so yesterday the lead voice actor for the emoji movie insisted that the movie is a very very important way of fighting president Trump's administration rather than just a film about talking faces the coiny Alex Griswold over at the free beacon we started with the Huffington Post we trashed his co-workers on Silicon Valley which is a show that I think is hilarious said right before the election asked how much money did you donate you Hollywood elite how much did you donate to Hillary Clinton's campaign and everybody in the cast had nothing they hadn't given a dollar maybe because she's the worst candidate in American history Miller said however he's very much on board emoji movie said how rare is it we get an opportunity to do an original property right there's an opportunity to do something optimistic positivistic and you know we have very few weapons in the current administration one of them is target younger demographic and try and help them understand and adopt progressive values the movie has a lot to say to women how they have limitless potential and whatever character literally breaks through a glass ceiling hmm this is a movie able to take my daughter to see I don't want to see your political messaging TJ Miller I'm not interested in what Hollywood thinks my child ought to say I'm interested in what I think my child ought to see she's my child you don't know her you don't care about her I do it's my job to determine what my child should see a new messaging in the emoji movie is not going to forward the ball at all in American politics you want to know what made Trump this is one of the things that made Trump is the incessant attempts by the left to infuse every single damn thing with politics everything everything has to has to be infused of politics opportun including a stupid movie with poop emojis played by Patrick Stewart you wonder why Hollywood is going to the going to the dogs this is one of the reasons you want to know why people are seeing superhero movies right now because they don't want to be hit with your stupid messaging Your Honor I don't hurt did great business besides being a very good movie it's because there is no political messaging and Dunkirk and no matter how hard your left try they couldn't find felicity political messaging and Dunkirk and so people were willing to see it so let's see spider-man or we'll go see Marvel movies or we'll go to DC movies we'll go see all of these superhero movies because we're not expecting to be sucker punch but we know that if we go see a serious drama there's at least a 35% chance there's going to be some back end and slap at Trump or conservatives or Republicans in their I was watching a movie last night I'm playing him in New York I was watching this movie that was what was the name of this film it was that is huge casters Amy Adams and Michael Shannon and for some reason as I get older I forget the names and movies in any case this this it was nocturnal animal that's name of the film so nocturnal animals is the film that opens with probably the worst opening I've ever seen to a pretty good movie the rest of the movie is fine but halfway through the movie there's a scene where the main character played by Amy Adams just starts ripping on her mother and she says she's a terrible person because she's a racist sexist bigoted homophobe and of course she's a Republican of course she's a Republican and it's just like okay do we need that sucker punch right here in the middle like was that necessary now it turns out that it's not as much of a sucker punch as it seems but that sort of thing is what people attempt to avoid when they go to the movies if how they wants to continue poisoning the popular culture to the point where we can't even share movies and entertainment with each other then the end result is going to be a more polarized culture not a less polarized culture okay so we'll be back here tomorrow to talk about John McCain's apparently big speech that I'm just messin on Twitter will talk also about what exactly Trump care is going to be plus the latest on the Jeff Sessions saga when we return i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
