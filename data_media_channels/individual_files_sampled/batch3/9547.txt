JURY. HE DIEPUGH IN 1946. IN WASHINGTON THE BRAIN TRUSTS IN THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT PARTIES ARE PLANNING THEIR MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER. TONIGHT ON CAPITOL HILL WE LOOK AT THE MESSAGES. THE PARTIES ARE TRYING TO CONVEY. THE ROAD MAP THAT HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL FOR REPUBLICANS IN SENATE PRIMARIES SO FAR TRASH TALK THE INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT. A SENATOR WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. OHIO WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH THE TRUMP AGENDA. GOP CANDIDATES ARE TOUTING TAX REFORM, REGULAR TORY ROLL BACKS, AND FLOOD OF CONSERVATIVE JUDGES TO COURT ROOMS. YOU LOOK AT THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS. OUR JUDGES ARE FILLING THE CORRECTS. MAKING GOOD DECISIONS BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION. SOME MIMIC TRUMP'S ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT A PROEFRP. LOOK AT MISSOURI. THEY'RE FURIOUS THAT PUGH C HAS FEATHERED THEIR OWN NEST AND PEOPLE LIKE CLAIRE HAVE VOTED FOR WAYS TO BENEFIT THEM. DEMOCRATS DON'T THINK THEY CAN CLAIM THE OUTSIDE THE BELT WAY APPROACH ANYMORE AFTER WHAT THEY CALL CONTROVERSIES OF THE EPA, HUD, AND OMB. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BECOME THE SWAMP. THEY SAY THEY'RE A BETTER DEAL TRYING TO DIMINISH THE CROWN JEWEL, TAX REFORM. NOW THE RISING GAS PRICES WILL CANCEL OUT THE 2018 CONSUMPTION WORST OF TAX CUTS. THE PRESIDENT'S NAME IS BEING USED TO MODIVATE BASE VOTERS. THE BEST THING WE CAN DO TO STOP THE WORST PART ABOUT THE TRUMP AGENDA IS TO WIN THE 2018 ELECTIONS. IN STATES TRUMP WON DEMOCRATS CAN'T ALL RUN AGAINST HIM. WHICH MEANS THE PARTY ISN'T TOTALLY UNITED. IN WEST VIRGINIA PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND JOE. WE WORK WELL TOGETHER. THAT GOES TO SHOW YOU AS STRATEGIES ARE BEING CRAFTED EVEN LAW MAKERS CONSIDERED THE MOST VULNERABLE ARE NOT ALL ONBOARD WITH THE MESSAGES THE NATIONAL LEADERS ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
