beyond even the racial point you notice this in the language of economic Envy so you hear people say we hate the 1% the upper 1% of wage earners I've never understood that I came from relatively lower means I didn't grow up with 11 siblings in a shack but relative to my area I came from lower means and rich people have always been great to me I've always gotten jobs from rich people I've gotten scholarships from rich people I'm not particularly angry at them and I noticed something at Yale all the richest and most privileged Upper West Side children of hedge fund managers they would lecture me and other students on financial aid about wealth and poverty in America they would always lecture me they'd call fellow conservatives over on financial aid they would they would call them uncompassionate or oblivious to a financial difficulty how have you responded throughout your life to elitists who would lecture you on race and poverty in America I mean it's really funny when they have white liberals and to me they're the most racist group of all I'm saying that movie get out was absolutely right racist group they are and and I have seen them discriminate in college and university admissions decisions between two blacks that there was a black person from a working-class background that has higher scores and one of the reasons I think that I have been treated well by conservatives and people who you know like you people they were more affluent that 1% is that they saw someone that was hardworking that was sincere and they rewarded that kind of behavior and I think that those same some of those same people if they're liberal they don't expect anything of blacks anyway and so they are willing to reward behavior you know that is not very competent and they don't believe any of us are capable of achieving on our own and so they lower the standards and they are harming black people on the colleges and universities they're harming them but not holding they're holding them to the same standard and when they remove the classics well they dumb damn a math the economics courts because students complains when they cancel course on free speech they're harming everyone's education and I think that we what we've seen is the fruits of affirmative action taken to its logical conclusion in that you know during the era that I was in college in the 1980s and the night I graduated with my PhD in 89 but you know there was affirmative action but if you were black and you owned those campuses I mean they were that you did not get huge breaks I did not go to school free you know I had lost student loan debt I had some scholarships but I had to work and nowadays they seem to be telling black students that they can take separate tracks that they can avoid any courses that may be challenging to that views and and I think they're harming everyone's education and that it's totally irresponsible of college administrators making multi million dollars to run universities in the cave into the student and they're harming the minority students the most
