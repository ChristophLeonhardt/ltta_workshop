WILL HAVE CRIME ALL OVER THE
PLACE, PEOPLE POURING ACROSS
THE BORDER.
WHY WOULD THAT BE A BLUE WAVE?
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A RED
WAVE.
REALLY!
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A RED WAY.
>> WAS A PRESENT LAST NIGHT
AIMING TO CURVE A BLUE WAVE IN
THE MIDTERMS.
RALLYING SUPPORTERS IN THE OHIO
DISTRICT HE WON HEAD OF SPECIAL
ELECTIONS.
>> HERE TO ACT WE HAVE A FOX
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER
CAMPAIGN -- DAVID BOSSIE.
HE IS BACK IN CAMPAIGN MODE.
HE SAID THE APPROACH BEING
EFFECTIVE ON TUESDAY AND THEN
OVERALL IN THE MIDTERMS.
>> THIS IS WHERE PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS AT HIS BEST.
OUT THERE ON THE ROAD, TALKING
DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, BYPASSING THE FAKE NEWS
DIVISIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
AND SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE
AMERICAN VOTER.
THIS IS PART OF THE STRATEGY.
THESE RALLIES.
THEY ARE PART OF THIS TRAGEDY
THAT GOT HIM VICTORY IN
NOVEMBER 2016 AND HE KNOWS IT.
HIS TEAM IS PUTTING TOGETHER A
SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, IT WILL
LOOK A LOT LIKE 2016.
>> THE PRESIDENT'S TALK ABOUT A
RED WAVE COMING INSTEAD OF A
BLUE WAVE.
THE PRESIDENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN
ALABAMA, GEORGIA AND REPUBLICAN
PRIMARIES BUT HE HASN'T REALLY
BEEN TESTED IN A REPUBLICAN
VERSUS DEMOCRAT.
YOU THINK IT WILL BE A RED
WAVE?
>> I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE
NOVEMBER ELECTION BECAUSE THIS
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE ABLE
TO RUN OVER THE NEXT 95 OR SO
DAYS ON HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
ON THIS TREMENDOUS LIST OF
PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT.
4.1 PERCENT GDP.
SOMETHING OBAMA SAID WAS NEVER
GOING TO BE SEEN AGAIN.
3.9 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT.
THE LOWEST IN 18 YEARS.
WHEN ECONOMIC INDICATOR AFTER
THE OTHER THAN OUR ECONOMY IS
ON FIRE.
THIS PRESIDENT HAS A RECORD TO
RUN ON.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BETTER
OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE IN
NOVEMBER 2016 AND THAT IS WHERE
WE ARE GOING TO BE EDUCATING
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE WILL BE
TRUE.
YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.
IT IS GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLE
AGENDA GOING THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION IF THE DEMOCRATS ARE
ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE HOUSE.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO
KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A JOKE.
FORWARD AGENDA OF AMERICA FIRST
OR GOING BACK TO THE OLD WAYS
THAT WERE OF YESTERDAY.
>> ALL RIGHT WE WILL BE
WATCHING THE SPECIAL ELECTION
ON TUESDAY.
TROY BALDERSON IN OHIO AGAINST
O'CONNOR.
HOW MUCH SHOULD BE READ INTO
THIS?
AS A STATEMENT OF THE POLES I
THINK ARE WITHIN A POINT OF
EACH OTHER.
THIS IS A DISTRICT THAT HAS
BEEN RED FOR DECADES NOW.
IF A REPUBLICAN LOSES, SHOULD
THE ALARM BELLS BE BLARING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT
REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE CONCERNED
>> THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT
RACE.
WE NEED TO WIN.
THE PRESENT ONLY WON THIS
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT BY A TWO
OR THREE POINTS IN NOVEMBER OF
2016.
IT IS ABOUT
