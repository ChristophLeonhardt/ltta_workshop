KNEEL KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS EXACTLY WORTHY OF A FOX NEWS ALERT. BUT A FOX NEWS POLL THAT REALLY ISN'T TOO JOLTING BUT COULD BE A SORT OF A WIND AT THE PRESIDENT'S BACK TWO OUT OF THREE OF AMERICANS SUPPORT SUMMIT IS HE GOING TO BE HAVING WITH KIM JONG UN. THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA, IF THEY ACTUALLY COME AWAY FROM THIS WITH SOMETHING, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE HIGH-POPPING PROGRESS BUT SOMETHING, THEN IT COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING. NOW, OF COURSE, WHAT WOULD SOMETHING BE? THE AUTHOR OF THE OPERATOR, FORMER NAVY SEAL ROB O'NEILL WITH ME. ROB, GOOD TO HAVE YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING ME, NEIL. Neil: ONE EVER THE COMMON PHRASES WE HEAR, ROB IS DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT'S AN INTEGRAL ISSUE. WE HAVE VERY BIG DIFFERENCES ON THE TIMETABLE. WE WANT IT FAST. THE NORTH KOREANS NOT SO FAST. THERE ARE SO MANY ARGUMENTS WITH THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT KIM JONG UN IS SORT OF PLAYING ALONG, KNOWING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD BE OUT IN A FEW YEARS, SEVEN YEARS AT THE MOST. AND THEN HE COULD PLAY THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS GRANDFATHERED KIM Neil: HOW LIKELY DO YOU THINK THAT IS. I DON'T THINK IT IS. I THINK WITH A LOT OF THE TECHNOLOGY COMING UP, KIM JONG UN WANTS TO MAINTAIN POWER. THE WAY HE MAINTAINS POWER IS WITHOUT AN INVASION OF HIS COUNTRY. HE REALLY WANTS TO AVOID AN INVASION. THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE WAS SAYING IN THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE AND IN SOUTH KOREA IF WE CAN GUARANTEE THE U.S. WILL NOT INVADE WHICH WE DON'T HAVE INTEREST IN DOING, HE GETS TO SORT OF MAINTAIN POWER AND THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL OF WAX ONCE THEY GET THE TECHNOLOGY IN THERE IF HE GETS TO KEEP POWER WITH NUKES. HE KNOWS THAT IS A DETERRENT. IF HE CAN GET RID OF THEM, HOPEFULLY RELEASING SOME OF THE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OF THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, HE GETS MORE STUFF IN THERE, HIS PEOPLE, NOT THAT HE REALLY CARES ABOUT HIS PEOPLE, IF THEY GET FED, THAT, AGAIN, WILL WILL COME WITH HIM MAINTAINING POWER. JUST TO GET A FACE TO FACE WITH THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD WHICH NO ONE IN NORTH KOREA EVER HAS, THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. CAN HE HEAR FACE TO FACE, ALONG WITH AN INVITE TO MAR-A-LAGO OR THE WHITE HOUSE. HE WANTS TO BE LEGITIMIZED AND KEEP HIS POWER. THIS IS DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. EVEN IF NOTHING COMES OUT OF IT, THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED NEGOTIATING ONCE THEY CALLED IT OFF AND PUT IT BACK ON, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO LEAVE THE G-7 SUMMIT TOMORROW TO GET THERE EARLY. THIS IS GREAT STEP IN FOREIGN POLICY. Neil: YOU NEVER LIKE BEING CALLED A HERO THE TAKEDOWN OF USAMA BIN LADEN. YOU CATEGORIZE THAT IN MY BOOK. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF WE DO NORMALIZE RELATIONS AND DOWN THE ROAD THERE IS KIM JONG UN AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? IT'S A TOUGH ONE. I MEAN PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS INVITED VLADIMIR PUTIN, TOO. A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT ARE SAYING, YOU KNOW, YOU BRING YOU KNOW, HE IS A GUY THAT TORTURES HIS OWN PEOPLE. Neil: WE CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE THE LEADERS MUCH THE COUNTRIES HE WANTS TO GO TO. LOOK AT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALL OUR ALLIES I WOULD RATHER BE STABBED IN THE FRONT THAN THE BACK. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT IS. MAYBE HE COMES AROUND. LOOK AT PAKISTAN. OKAY, WE GIVE THEM MILLIONS AND MILLIONS, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN AID. THEY HID BIN LADEN ON US. THEY HIDE THE HAQQANI NETWORK. DO WE JUST IGNORE? Neil: FDR COULDN'T PICK AND CHOOSE THE LEADER OF RUSSIA WHICH HE WAS TALKING TO STALIN. THEY WERE CALLING HIM UNCLE JOE AT THE TIME. HE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE A GREAT GUY. HE KILLED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. Neil: LEAVING THAT OUT OF THE ARGUMENT HERE. THE NORTH KOREAN NEEDS SOMETHING OUT OF IT. A LOT MORE THAN WE DO. YEAH. Neil: WHAT DO WE OFFER IN EXCHANGE THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE EVER CAVING AND THAT WAS THE WRAP AGAINST BILL CLINTON. NOT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE ARE OFFERING RELIEF. HE LIKES HIS MONEY. HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AS A WORLD LEADER. HE LOVES PRESTIGE. IT SEEMS TO ME, EVEN I SAID HE WAS CRAZY BEFORE ON TELEVISION. HE MIGHT NOT BE AS CRAZY AS WE THOUGHT. BUT, YOU KNOW, HE WANTS TO BE WILL HE LEGITIMIZED AND HOPEFULLY THEY SEE WHAT KIND OF LOOK AT THE WEALTH IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA COMPARED TO PYONGYANG. THEY GOT A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE OF CAPITALISM AND COOPERATING WITH THE WORLD. THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF. RIGHT NOW THEY ARE TRADING MAINLY WITH CHINA AND SOME WITH SINGAPORE WHICH IS WHY ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY THE SUMMIT IS GOING TO BE IN SINGAPORE. IF THEY CAN TRADE WITH MORE PEOPLE AND NOT NECESSARILY UNDER THE THUMB OF THE CHINESE THAT COULD BE IN THEIR INTEREST. YOU HAVE GOT TO FIGURE SINCE THE EARLY 1950S PEOPLE BEING LIED TO AND HIS FAMILY ARE GOD AND TAKE A LOT TO BRING THEM AROUND. Neil: COULD YOU UNIFY THE TWO? HOPEFULLY. Neil: THERE WOULD BE NO NORTH OR SOUTH KOREA, THERE WOULD BE ONE KOREA. HE PROBABLY DIDN'T IMAGINE HIS GRANDSON WOULD BE HOLDING HANDS AND SKIPPING ACROSS THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE WITH THE LEADER OF SOUTH KOREA. I MEAN, IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SAY THE LEAST. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. Neil: ALL RIGHT. IT IS GOING TO BE PAY PER VIEW WATCHING.
