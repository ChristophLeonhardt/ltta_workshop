12
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:05,653
TWO BIZARRE BUT TELLING STORIES

13
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,088
ABOUT OUR FUTURE AND AMERICA,

14
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:08,823
BOTH THE HEAD.

15
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:10,792
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT A NEW

16
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,293
BATTLE BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE

17
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:12,894
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

18
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:17,399
A GROUP OF CONGRESSIONAL --

19
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,033
DEMANDING THE DEPUTY

20
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:18,800
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB ROSENSTEIN

21
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,402
RELEASED A SERIES OF DOCUMENTS

22
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:21,603
RELATED TO THE RUSSIA

23
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:22,037
INVESTIGATION.

24
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:23,204
THEY SAY THEY PLAN TO IMPEACH

25
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:23,938
ROSENSTEIN IF HE DOESN'T TURN

26
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:26,574
OVER THE INFORMATION.

27
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,109
SO FAR HE HAS DEFIANTLY REFUSED

28
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:28,510
TO DO THAT.

29
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,613
BEFORE YOU TUNE THIS OUT AS

30
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:34,416
ANOTHER PARTISAN ARCING DEBATE,

31
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,116
THE KIND THAT WASHINGTON

32
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:36,785
SPECIALIZES IN, HERE ARE THE

33
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:37,185
DETAILS.

34
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:39,821
THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE HERE, FAR

35
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,589
BEYOND THE SHORT-TERM POLITICAL

36
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:42,424
ADVANTAGE OF EITHER PARTY.

37
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:44,492
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AS YOU

38
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:45,393
KNOW HAS COMPLETELY DOMINATED

39
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:46,161
THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT SINCE

40
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:49,197
THE DAY TRUMP TOOK OFFICE.

41
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:50,398
IT'S ALL ANYONE IN WASHINGTON

42
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,467
CAN TALK OR THINK ABOUT.

43
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:53,802
NEVER MIND THE POTENTIAL WARS ON

44
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:55,570
THE HORIZON FOR THE FACT THAT

45
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,872
OUR OWN ECONOMY AND CULTURE ARE

46
00:00:57,872 --> 00:00:58,673
CHANGING FASTER THAN ANYONE CAN

47
00:00:58,673 --> 00:01:00,975
UNDERSTAND OR DIGEST.

48
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:02,510
IN D.C., ONLY THE MUELLER

49
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,379
INVESTIGATION MATTERS, SO YOU

50
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,381
MAY WONDER WHAT IS THE MUELLER

51
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:07,382
INVESTIGATION?

52
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:08,349
WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

53
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,018
WHAT EXACTLY IS HE

54
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:10,618
INVESTIGATING?

55
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:11,853
TURNS OUT, ALMOST NOBODY KNOWS

56
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:13,421
EXCEPT ROB ROSENSTEIN.

57
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,824
HE KNOWS, BUT HE WON'T TELL

58
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:16,224
CONGRESS.

59
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:17,792
LAST SUMMER HE WROTE A MEMO

60
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:20,061
DETAILING THE SCOPE OF THE

61
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:20,495
INVESTIGATION.

62
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,464
KEY PORTIONS OF THAT MEMO REMAIN

63
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:23,431
HIDDEN FROM VIEW.

64
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,232
CONGRESS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM

65
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:26,634
AND HAS EVERY RIGHT TO SEE THEM.

66
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:27,368
OUR CONSTITUTION REQUIRES OUR

67
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:32,607
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES TO SUPER

68
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:33,942
SUPERVISE THE DEPARTMENT OF

69
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:34,275
JUSTICE.

70
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:34,676
WHY IS THAT?

71
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:36,845
SO THAT BUREAUCRATS REMAIN

72
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:38,446
ACCOUNTABLE TO VOTERS.

73
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:39,414
WE GIVE THEM GUNS, LET THEM

74
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:40,448
ARREST US AND SENTENCED TO

75
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:42,050
PRISON, ALLOW THEM TO BREAK INTO

76
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,784
OUR PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNTS, TAP

77
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:45,019
OUR PHONES.

78
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:46,521
THEY HAVE A LOT OF POWER.

79
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:47,355
IN RETURN THEY PROMISE NOT TO

80
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:49,624
MISUSE THAT POWER.

81
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:50,425
IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT

82
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,494
THEIR HONESTY, WE GET THE CHECK.

83
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:55,396
THAT'S WHAT TRANSPARENCY IS.

84
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,064
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS HATE

85
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:56,598
TRANSPARENCY.

86
00:01:56,598 --> 00:01:58,399
THEY WOULD RATHER DO THEIR WORK

87
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:58,766
IN SECRET.

88
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,868
SECRECY IS THE SHIELD THAT

89
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:04,739
CONSIDER THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

90
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,406
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION INTO

91
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:07,809
RUSSIAN COLLUSION.

92
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,610
IT TOOK A YEAR TO COMPLETE.

93
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,612
THE FINAL REPORT RANKED 253

94
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:12,380
PAGES.

95
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,215
IF THE REST OF US COULDN'T

96
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,651
REALLY READ IT BECAUSE KEY FACTS

97
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,019
WERE MISSING.

98
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:18,753
JUST DOMINATE TRUMP ASSOCIATES

99
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:20,588
DID THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SPY

100
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:22,223
ON DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN?

101
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:25,193
IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW THAT.

102
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:26,394
SORRY, IT'S REDACTED.

103
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:28,229
IS THERE ANY ACTUAL PROOF THAT

104
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,997
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT DIRECTED

105
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:32,567
HACKING OF THE DNC AND

106
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,004
IF IT IS THEIRS THAT'S BEEN

107
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:36,804
REDACTED TOO.

108
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:37,538
REPORTS SAY THE FBI AGENTS WHO

109
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,073
INTERVIEWED MIKE FLYNN DIDN'T

110
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:43,111
BELIEVE HE WAS LYING, BUT WAIT,

111
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:43,911
MIKE FLYNN PLEADED GUILTY TO

112
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:45,179
LYING TO THOSE AGENTS AND HIS

113
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,115
LIFE WAS DESTROYED AS A RESULT.

114
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,583
HE SOLD HIS HOUSE TO RAISE MONEY

115
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,984
FOR HIS LEGAL DEFENSE.

116
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,986
SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

117
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:52,787
WE DON'T KNOW.

118
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:54,022
THAT INFORMATION WAS REDACTED.

119
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:55,390
WHY WERE ALL THESE REACTIONS

120
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,823
MAY?

121
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,025
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT.

122
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,628
WE ASKED, NO ONE WOULD TELL US.

123
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:01,496
AND THEN THERE'S THE FISA

124
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:04,399
APPLICATION TO SPY ON TRUMP

125
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,600
CAMPAIGN AIDE CARTER PAGE THAT

126
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,201
HASN'T BEEN RELEASED EITHER.

127
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,569
WE HAVE AMPLE REASON TO BELIEVE

128
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,504
THE APPLICATION MAY HAVE

129
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:11,506
FUNDAMENTALLY ILLEGITIMATE BASED

130
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:13,508
HEAVILY ON DISCREDITED PARTISAN

131
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:15,510
HEARSAY, THE DOSSIER.

132
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,445
JIM COMEY DENIES THIS OF COURSE.

133
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:18,413
HE HAS DENIED IT REPEATEDLY ON

134
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:19,213
HIS BOOK TOUR.

135
00:03:19,213 --> 00:00:00,000
JUST THE OTHER DAY, HE NOTED,
