So if you can go into
the Civitan and play,
people would know you in
the streets of Saginaw.
So your name will
start to ring.
O.K., we got this 
little guy over here
named Draymond Green.
They call him Day Day.
Oh, he can ball with
the best of them.
It was just like a
relief valve, you know?
Kids being off the streets,
talking to other kids,
growing up with other
kids at the Civitan.
It was always packed,
always packed.
Wood floor, fiberglass rims.
The gym was great,
and so that’s
why we miss the Civitan now.
 Yeah, that
was away he got the —
— he got the
attitude built in.
I would try to make
him cry, but that’s
where he learned how to —
his, like, no-quit attitude.
It was just very
intense, very intense.
And I was trying to push
him to the level of,
where is your breaking point?
So I knew how to make him
mad, but I didn’t know
what would make him quit.
Everything Draymond does on
the court right now started
when he first started playing.
What you see, what
he doing on TV,
is what he’s been
doing all his life.
