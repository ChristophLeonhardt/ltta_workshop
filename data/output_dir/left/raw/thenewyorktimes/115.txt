Hi.

Yes, I can see.

I like how you look.

Amazing.

12
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,005
I met Inge almost 15
years ago in school.

13
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:13,010
– One summer, she started
writing these lyrics

14
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,420
about blood and death.

15
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,660
And I told her, “This sounds
like death metal lyrics.”

16
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,390
And she goes, “Death
metal, what is that?”

17
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,250
Inge wrote the lyrics,
and we wrote the music

18
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,050
for these songs.

00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,060
O.K., let’s do those
two lines again.

to keep you doing this?

you keep living.

26
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,699

your body up.
