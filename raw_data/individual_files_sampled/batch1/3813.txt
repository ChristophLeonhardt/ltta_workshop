when you ask a financial advisor about hidden fees you're probably in a relationship with the wrong financial advisor because there shouldn't be any hidden fees so the first thing a client or a prospective client should ask their financial advisor is is the fee that I'm paying you the 60 80 100 basis points fee that I'm paying you to give me service is that the only way you or your firm are making money from me now the financial advisor if they're working for a large brokerage firm may try and parse their answer and say well it's the only fee that I get and that's not a sufficient answer you have to dig in and say okay I understand that you're getting 70 or 80 basis points but are the products that I'm being sold is their money that's going from me back to your firm someplace that I need to understand and if the answer is an unequivocal know then you're probably working with the fiduciary if the answer is a hedge or a hesitation or a shucking and jiving then there's probably something there that's hidden and you should dig in now a financial advisor should be able to say to a client here's the fees that you're paying me and here are the actual costs of each of the products that you're invested in whether it's a mutual fund or an ETF or a separate account or a hedge fund a non-fiduciary is not only not required to share with you all the ways that they're making money but here's the sort of disappointing part of this industry they may not even know all the different ways the firm behind them is making money the simplest way to find out whether or not you're working with a fiduciary is to look them in the eye and ask them are you my fiduciary if they look you right in the eye and they say yes i am a legal fiduciary and they go on to explain their rules and the duties that they have to follow then you're probably on the right track and you should ask them for the documentation or a contract that puts in writing the things that they're saying to you verbally to simply confirm that what they're saying to you is codified some place in a written document but if there's any equivocation there obably not a fiduciary
