former Liberal Party interim leader Bob Rae delivered his final report on the Ranga crisis the agust statesman note set Canada needs to take a leadership role regarding the Rohingya translation get out your wallets folks we need to embrace another Muslim victimhood cause it just never ends does it the Trudeau liberals love giving our hard-earned money to Muslims and Muslim causes even the worst of the worst such as convicted terrorist Omar Khadr well he qualified for that eight figure handout the Trudeau liberals also love extending invitations to refugees especially Muslim refugees mostly they hailed from Syria but earlier this month Trudeau said he'd be happy to take in some illegal aliens many of the Muslim who fled certain African countries and were able to sneak into Israel those people are now in the process of being deported from Israel but how odd that any Muslim refugee would convert Leafly to the land of pigs and apes when the Middle East has so many Muslim majority Republic's from which to choose weird eh but apparently this government is just warming up because there are supposedly millions of dollars in the Treasury waiting to be spent on virtue signaling causes and apparently there's yet another region brimming with Muslim refugees that Justin feels obliged to take in on your behalf which brings us to that which is known as the Rohingya crisis that's ongoing in Burma right now where Myanmar as it's called today by way of background there has always been deep-seated tensions in Burma regarding the Buddhist majority and the stateless mostly Muslim Rohingya minority but the situation reached a flash point last August when Raheja terrorists attacked several police posts killing 12 members of the security force this in turn led to a crackdown by the military which is so far driven about 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh and somehow someway there were hanging up people who fled Burma to neighboring Bangladesh is a Canadian problem well Bob ray says a hundred and fifty million dollars in aid ought to help set things right oh sure just put it on the tab Bob and folks think about that as you file your tax returns this month look I'm not heartless I'm just very skeptical of the narrative coming out of Burma these days for starters I believe those who say that the muslim aranga are essentially illegal aliens from Bangladesh as well some of these people have blood on their hands carrying out deadly acts of terrorism in Burma third I'm sorry but when buddhist buddhists of all people actually have to resort the violence in dealing with a group of malcontents you know there must be more to this story than what's being conveyed via the mainstream media and the United Nations indeed if the Rohan gaya can't get along with their neighbors in a predominantly Buddhist country just how would they behave in a judeo-christian multicultural countries such as Canada how do those elementary school report cards sometimes read mmm does not play well with others but Ray well he's all in check out this recent CBC interview in which Ray is essentially asked why Canada is stepping up to the plate regarding the Ranga in the first place do you think there is a leadership vacuum on this issue the way I describe it is Vasi is probably a little dangerous when I say this but what the heck right I'm like I'm really not getting paid to do this I can say what I like I think we're living in a world without adults supervision at the moment we got into the habit after 1945 of looking to the Americans for leadership or others you know for a long time the British and so on those days are gone and we need to understand that the the mantle of leadership really is is shared and it whether or not that and that's always risky because they people say well it's your job my job whose the fact is it's it's a collective responsibility and in that context we can we can actually make a difference if we say we're prepared to do this and are you prepared to do this or others prepared to move ahead and do things can you believe your ears we live in a country led by a former part-time drama teacher currently playing the role of Prime Minister when he's not playing the role of mr. dressup during one of his endless family vacations adult supervision yeah in any event ray goes on to state that Canada has an obligation to respond to the displaced Rohan yeah really why how do we have any skin in the game here but when one asks the tough questions and no you won't hear those tough questions posed during a painfully politically correct interview on the CBC well out comes the do-rag or cries of Islamophobia folks I witnessed this firsthand last November when Toronto City Hall hosted what amounted to a Rohan gay propaganda session but there was precious little tolerance at this public forum for those with a contrarian viewpoint such as SAN francisco-based activist Rick Heinzman heisman was shouted down verbally abused and eventually ejected by security check it out you're denying this genocide because you're also a Holocaust denier then you have to leave I have you should get out you should leave now I later caught up with Heinzmann outside City Hall and I asked him about the contention which is rarely reported that the Muslim minority in Burma are the authors of their own misfortune given that many allege the Muslim minority started this conflict going back some 75 years ago here's what he had to say the 1942 there's a well documented Massacre called the Mong da Massacre where they rose up with world war ii weapons killed 30,000 buddhists in mong town alone sent a hundred thousand or more into fleeing for their lives by burning 400 plus Buddhist villages they simply think they have the divine right to kill anybody that is not Muslim to them other people are like cutting grass or something you can just simply do it we have video tapes from this recent episode from captured terrorists or dead terrorists from their cell phones we have videotapes of them training them putting their black hoods on grabbing their weapons lining up ready to march to a Buddhist village to kill everybody we have videos of kids probably five years old with big old machetes smiling and saying we want to kill Buddhists we want to chop the heads off Buddhists we want to do that however even though Rohan get victimhood continues to fuel the narrative when it comes to coverage of Burma today every so often a story does appear that makes one pause one such story was published in the New York Times in February headlined the Rohingya suffer real Horrors so why are some of their stories untrue and it makes for a fascinating tale published in a newspaper that can hardly be labeled as right-of-center here's how reporter had Beach begins her story quote the four young sister sat in huddled together but alone their accounts were dramatic their mother had died when their home was burned by soldiers in routine state and western Myanmar their father was one of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who had disappeared into official custody and were feared dead somehow the sisters aged 12 8 5 and 2 made their way to refuge in Bangladesh an uncle who had been living for years in the Rohan gaya refugee camps in Bangladesh had taken them in adding the girls to his own collection of hungry children quote my parents were killed in me amar said the eldest girl jenika Begum I miss them very much within an hour I had a notebook filled with the kind of quotes that pull at heartstrings little of it was true indeed Beach goes on to note that after three days of reporting the truth slowly begins to emerge and that truth is unsettling for example so you'd Husein the suppose at uncle who had taken those girls in well turns out he's actually their father and he has three wives two in Bangladesh and one in Myanmar we're saying goes on to lament that his troubles began when he was briefly back in Myanmar and saw a 12 year old girl with fair skin and delicate features said Mr Hussain she was so beautiful I needed to marry her well Beach continues child marriage is distressingly common among the Rohingya and soon mr. Hussein began shuttling among his three wives not every wife knew about the other but mr. Hussein didn't think three wives were too many his own father he said had six wives and forty-two now folks even more disturbingly Hussein midst a beach that he's having a rough time managing all his wives and all his children so much so that he confesses to beating one of his wives and shockingly he boasts that he plans to further beat her in the future it's a coping mechanism for him I suppose so let's take some inventory shall we child brides pedophilia polygamy spousal abuse and as the feminists remain silent on this file how exactly does Rohan get cultural uniqueness fit into Justin Trudeau's vision of diversity is our strength as well one must raise the impolite politically incorrect question given the lack of buy-in to Western values are you truly keen on having people such as Hussein becoming an instant Canadian citizen also that the likes of Bob ray and Justin Trudeau can pretend to the rest of the world that they are the so-called adults in the room for the rebel media I am David the men's ID Menzies hey folks may have heard the rubble has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
