1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,449
DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT
AT THE WHITE HOUSE

2
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:06,839
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER, HE WENT
TO MICHIGAN, AND WHILE IN

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,990
MICHIGAN HE DIDN'T BRING UP THE
FLINT WATER CRISIS WHATSOEVER.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,310
HE WENT THERE TO SAY THERE'S
MORE IMPORTANT STUFF, HE SAID --

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:23,780
THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE CITY
IN MICHIGAN THAT HE WENT TO --

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,710
SO HE SKIPPED OUT ON THE
MICHELLE WOLF CONVENTION TO SAY

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,570
HE'S A MAN OF THE PEOPLE, AND IF
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,750
WHAT A MAN OF THE PEOPLE DONALD
TRUMP IS, YOU HAVE TO CATCH IN

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,370
BETWEEN MEMBERS ONLY EVENTS AT
MAR-A-LAGO THIS WEEKEND.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,780
I TOO WOULD RATHER HAVE HIM IN
WASHINGTON MICHIGAN FOR GOOD.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,390
WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT
THE MICHELLE WOLF SITUATION?

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,399
I THOUGHT IT WAS
UNBELIEVABLE, THE AMOUNT OF HEAT

13
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,719
SHE TOOK.

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,200
TO SAY THAT MICHELLE
WOLF, A FAIRLY UNKNOWN COMEDIAN,

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,680
IS BULLYING THE WHITE HOUSE, IS
PREPOSTEROUS.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,200
SHE WAS HIRED TO

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,940
ROAST THEM AND SHE ROASTED THEM.

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,580
IT WAS TOTALLY FINE.

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,580
WHAT THEY

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,640
ARE REALLY MAD ABOUT IS THAT SHE
MADE FUN OF THE MEDIA.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
SHE SAID

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,950
THE MEDIA CREATED TRUMP, AND NOW
THEY ARE PROFITING OFF OF HIM.

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,659
AND SHE CALLED THEM OUT. AND SHE
ENDED THE SEGMENT BY SAYING

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,130
FLINT STILL DOESN'T HAVE CLEAN
WATER.

25
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,430
SO KUDOS TO HER, I

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,430
THOUGHT SHE WAS FANTASTIC.

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,430
SHE DID GREAT.

28
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,110
SHE HAD A LOT OF JOKES THAT HIT.

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,220
SHE WAS FUNNY, SHE HAD POINTS.

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,890
I MEAN, THAT'S THE KIND OF
COMEDY THAT I LOVE, COMEDY WITH

31
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,110
A MESSAGE AND THE WHOLE POINT
IS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE THE

32
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,110
JOKES.

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,360
IF YOU NOTICE, KELLYANNE CONWAY
WAS MADE FUN OF BUT SHE WAS

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,380
IN THE AUDIENCE.

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,530
CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS MADE FUN OF
IN THE AUDIENCE, REINCE PREBUS.

36
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,180
THE CAMERA WOULD GO TO THEM AND
THEN GO BACK.

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,250
WHEN YOU SAW SARAH HUCKABEE
SANDERS UP IN THE FRONT, THAT

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,670
IS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE
POSITION BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,670
SMILE.

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,670
SHE DIDN'T SMILE.

41
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,720
SHE WAS SEETHING AND I FELT BAD
FOR HER BECAUSE THE JOKES,

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,130
THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT THE JOKE
ABOUT THE LOOKS.

43
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,870
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A JOKE
ABOUT HER APPEARANCE.

44
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,880
SHE SAID TWO THINGS, SHE
TAKES LIES, TRUTHS AND BURN

45
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
THEM,

46
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,219
SHE BURNS FACTS AND MAKES A
SMOKY EYE WITH THEM AND THE

47
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:14,200
OTHER ONE WAS I LOVE YOU AS AUNT
LYDIA IN THE HANDMAID'S TALE,

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:21,439
PLAYED BY ANN DOWD, BUT
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT

49
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,629
COMPARING HER, I DON'T THINK IT
WAS NECESSARILY THAT THEIR LOOKS

50
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:25,629
ARE

51
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:29,389
BOTH BAD BUT RATHER, SHE IS THE
FRONT MAN FOR THE TERRIBLE

52
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,549
TOTALITARIAN REGIME.

53
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:36,090
SO THEY WERE THE BUTT OF
JOKES IN TERMS OF, BUT

54
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,359
REGARDLESS, SHE IS SITTING UP
THERE.

55
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,909
THAT IS THE POSITION AND SHE DID
HER JOB.

56
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,719
THE PRESS, FIRST OF ALL,
SOMEBODY HIRED HER SO YOU

57
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,859
BETTER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING
AND SECONDLY, EVERYONE IN

58
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:48,650
THE PRESS WAS CRITICIZING THAT,
THEY DON'T HAVE THE BALLS

59
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,209
TO STAND UP TO THE
ADMINISTRATION AND MICHELLE

60
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,769
WOLF, SHE SPOKE A LOT OF TRUTH
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BALLS

61
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,029
TO STAND UP, DON'T GO AFTER A
COMEDIAN WHO HAS THE BALLS.

62
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:03,099
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO BE
FUNNY AND MAKE A POINT?

63
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,540
YES.

64
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,799
THEY ARE LIKE
WE HIRED A COMEDIAN AND WE

65
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,329
CANNOT BELIEVE THEY TOLD JOKES.

66
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:13,659
IF YOU WANT SOME SILLY GUY,
GET A TRUMP IMPERSONATOR.

67
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,569
READ THE SCRIPT FOR HIM.

68
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,129
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WAS
OFFENSIVE?

69
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,560
THE TIME GEORGE BUSH DURING
THE IRAQ WAR MADE, JOKES

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,839
ABOUT, WHERE ARE THE WMDS?

71
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,269
NOT THERE, NOT THERE.

72
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,310
HE IS MAKING FUN OF THE FACT
THAT HE COULDN'T FIND THE WMDS.

73
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:37,810
SO THAT IS OFFENSIVE.

74
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,089
PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND YOU ARE
MAKING FUN OF THAT.

75
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,519
AND SHE CALLED THEM OUT FOR
LYING.

76
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,560
THEY LIE EVERY DAY, SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS LIES.

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,739
DONALD TRUMP LIES SO SHE CALLED
THEM OUT IN VERY FUNNY WAYS.

78
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,650
WHY IS THE PRESS SITTING THERE
GOING ALL MY GOD, I CANNOT

79
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,859
BELIEVE SHE IS DOING THIS.

80
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,779
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT DOING
ENOUGH.

81
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:05,849
I WATCH, I DO A BREAKDOWN
WHERE I STAND IN FOR SARAH

82
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,879
HUCKABEE SANDERS AND HONESTLY
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BY THE

83
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,400
PRESS ALL THE TIME.

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,499
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE A SEAN
SPICER THAN SARAH SANDERS

85
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,539
BECAUSE AT LEAST SPICER IS
UPSET.

86
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:21,238
AT LEAST HE GETS MAD, VISIBLY
UPSET.

87
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,720
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS JUST SITS
THERE AND RECITES LIE

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,940
AFTER LIE, LOOKING PEOPLE
DIRECTLY IN THE EYE.

89
00:04:27,940 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS ALL SHE DOES ALL DAY
