THE MOVIE ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD WAS SET FOR A DECEMBER RELEASE BUT JUST A MONTH BEFORE SUDDENLY EVERYTHING BECAME UNCERTAIN BECAUSE ONE OF THE MOVIE STARS WAS LINKED TO A LOT OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. THE MOVIE COULD'VE BEEN PULLED BUT INSTEAD WHAT THEY WHAT THEY DID WAS DO RE-SHOOTS TO TAKE OUT KEVIN SPACEY AND PUT A DIFFERENT ACTOR IN HIS PLACE. THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IT IN THE MOVIE DID NOT EVEN HAVE TO BE DELAYED. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE RE-SHOOTS ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR THEM. IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME OF THE FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE RE-SHOOTS. THE PROBLEM COMES IN NOW NOT WITH KEVIN SPACEY BUT WITH MARK WAHLBERG AND MICHELLE WILLIAMS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PAY FOR THE RE-SHOOTS. THAT IS AS BIG AS OF A DISPARITY AS YOU CAN HAVE. SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SYSTEM, THIS IS PURELY ABOUT AGENTS WHICH COULD BE TRUE BUT THEY ARE BOTH REPRESENTED BY WME. NO ONE FROM THOSE COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED TO CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS, BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME AGENCY. THEY BOTH HAVE TOP-TIER REPRESENTATION. I HAVE ALSO SEEN THE MOVIE, IT COULD'VE BEEN THEORETICALLY THAT IF MARK WAHLBERG WAS IN A TON OF SCENES, AND SHE WASN'T, THEN MAYBE HE SHOULD BE PAID MORE. BUT THEY BOTH SHARE LOTS OF SCENES TOGETHER. THIS IS NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR HOLLYWOOD. ESPECIALLY DAYS AFTER THE GOLDEN GLOBES. DO I KNOW WHY IT HAPPENS DEFINITIVELY? OF COURSE NOT NO ONE DOES. I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS INVOLVED. ONE, SINCE WE ARE NOT IN THE INDUSTRY AND NOT OLD-SCHOOL IT MIGHT BLOW OUR MINDS HOW MUCH DISCRIMINATION THERE ACTUALLY IS. I REMEMBER WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS A TV WRITER AND THEY WERE TRYING TO PICK A HOST FOR A SHOW ON ONE OF THE CABLE STATIONS AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY DISCRIMINATORY. IT WAS SHOCKING HOW DISCRIMINATORY IT WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY DON'T WANT IN NEW YORK INTELLECTUAL LOOK. I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT MEANS JEWISH. THIS IS AT THE TIME WHEN SEINFELD WAS THE NUMBER ONE SHOW ON TV. AND THEY SAID WE ARE LOOKING FOR A MIDWESTERN LOOK, THAT MEANS WHITE. THEY HAD ALL THESE CODEWORDS. THEY MAY NOT EVEN THINK OR SAY CONSCIOUSLY BUT IT MIGHT BE THEIR STEREOTYPE ASSUMPTIONS. BUT NOW IS GIVE YOU THE DIFFERENT FACTORS, IT COULD ALSO BE IN PART OR IN WHOLE THAT WAHLBERG 単 THIS IS NOT THEIR MAIN SALARY FOR THE MOVIE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR SALARY FOR THE MOVIE IS, IT COULD BE EQUAL. I AM GOING TO BET IT IS NOT, BUT IT COULD BE. BUT WE DON'T KNOW. THIS IS JUST FOR THE RE-SHOOTS. IN THIS CASE, GIVE MICHELLE WILLIAMS A TON OF CREDIT SHE SAID SHE WAS THRILLED THEY WERE RESHOOTING THOSE SCENES, SO SHE WAS HAPPY TO DO IT BECAUSE THE STUDIO WAS GOING THE EXTRA DISTANCE AND SHE WAS WILLING TO AS WELL. SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST SAID GREAT. AND WAHLBERG'S AGENTS WERE 単 IT DEPENDS ON YOUR INTERPRETATION OF IT. THEY PRESSED HIM AND THEY GOT MORE MONEY, OR YOU MIGHT SAY THEY WERE JERKS. WE HAVE A SLIGHT CONFLICT OF INTEREST WE ARE ALSO REPRESENTED BY WME, THE COMPANY. AND HENCE THE DISPARITY. AND I DON'T KNOW THE INNER WORKINGS THERE AT ALL BUT A LOT OF THOSE AGENTS I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY SHARED INFORMATION. I'M SURE THEY SHARE IT ON SOME SCALE BUT THEY MIGHT ALSO BE REALLY COMPETITIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WAHLBERG'S AGENT MIGHT BE LAUGHING AT MICHELLE WILLIAMS AGENT SAYING I DID BETTER. WITH ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE AGENTS, THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE WILL RESPOND TO THE AGENTS OF MALE AND FEMALE ACTORS DIFFERENTLY AS WELL. FOR ME IT IS A PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS 単 NUMERICALLY EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS TRYING TO BE FIXED RIGHT NOW. WHEN THIS BROKE I WAS TALKING TO MY GIRLFRIEND WHO IS A WORKING ACTRESS WHO WAS THERE. SHE WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH E, THEY ARE DEALING RIGHT NOW WITH ONE OF THEIR TOP-TIER FEMALE HOUSE, SHE LEFT BECAUSE SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE HUGE PAY DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN HER AND SOME OF THE MUCH LESS EXPERIENCED MALE HOSTS. I KNOW THE TWO HOSTS NOW ON THE TODAY SHOW GET PAID TOGETHER HALF OF WHAT MATT LAUER WAS GETTING PAID. MARK WAHLBERG WAS THE BEST PAID ACTOR IN HOLLYWOOD LAST YEAR. HE HAS BEEN NOMINATED BEFORE, FOR THE DEPARTED AND SHE HAS BEEN NOMINATED BEFORE. BUT THAT IS NOT BOX OFFICE DRAW. BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME ISSUE, YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM THAT, IT IS A FACT. BUT IN TERMS OF ONE PARTICULAR CASE AT A TIME, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. MATT LAUER CAME FROM A TIME WHEN TV HAD ENDLESS MONEY AND THEY THOUGHT THE STARS WHO SMILED A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON CAMERA SHOULD GET $25 MILLION AT A TIME. THOSE DAYS ARE LARGELY GONE. I THINK MEGYN KELLY GOT THE LAST BIG CONTRACT. AND BY THE WAY FROM NBC, THE TODAY SHOW, AND SHE IS A WOMAN. SHE NOW PROBABLY GETS PAID MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE BUILDING. HODA - WHAT IS YOUR NAME? I NEVER WATCH THAT SHOW. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME DRAWL? RIGHT OR WRONG? THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE PAID THE SAME AS MATT LAUER, THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. PEOPLE THAT JUST CAME OUT OF LAW SCHOOL OR MEDICAL SCHOOL 単 THERE IS NO REASON WHY A MAN OR WOMAN SHOULD BE PAID DIFFERENTLY. IF YOU SAW THAT IT IS CLEAR DISCRIMINATION. IF YOU GO TO A DOCTOR AND YOU GO TO THE SAME HOSPITAL IN THE SAME MARKET, CLEAR DISCRIMINATION IF YOU ARE GETTING PAID DIFFERENTLY. THERE ARE 1000 DIFFERENT FACTORS. LOOK AT THE OVERALL TREND, THAT MATTERS AND THE TREND DOES SHOW DISCRIMINATION. BUT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS THERE ARE TOO MANY FACTORS TO BE ABLE TO TELL.
