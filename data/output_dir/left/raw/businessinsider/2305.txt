1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,930
the forecast<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 2010 was that it was</font>

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,910
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the year of the IPO we</font>

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,350
were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see facebook maybe</font>

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,619
linkedin Zynga<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter or anybody you</font>

5
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,960
know IPO big big year these companies

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">are global brands they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over a</font>

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,500
hundred million dollars in revenue not

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,100
not Twitter of course and all these

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,600
companies responded sort of saying

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,320
nothing soon we even saw from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yuri</font>

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">Miller who's an investor in facebook</font>

12
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,960
maybe next year maybe 2011 some are

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,399
pushing it further further and further

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,920
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> so given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all these companies</font>

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,100
have passed this litmus test of should

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,570
go IPO<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred million</font>

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,860
dollars in revenue this year they'll

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,750
have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have it for the</font>

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,870
foreseeable future why what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is their</font>

20
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,309
actual position in public this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what a</font>

21
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,710
reader wants to know is 2010 not going

22
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,390
to be the year as many forecasted and

23
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,460
here's the reason basically what's going

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,860
on what you're seeing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're seeing</font>

25
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,260
large holding companies come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and</font>

26
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,750
basically take the place of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> public</font>

27
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,729
markets in several instances and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

28
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:10,060
provide semi exits so in 2009 we saw

29
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,490
facebook get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 million dollar</font>

30
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,560
investment from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russian company called</font>

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">Digital Sky technologies and basically</font>

32
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:21,759
this was what happens is the founders

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,170
don't want to go public yet because they

34
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,399
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to answer to public</font>

35
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:25,840
shareholders produce quarter after

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,670
quarter results but they want to provide

37
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,259
an exit for many of their employees and

38
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:31,840
early investors so a big holding company

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,639
comes along and says this is a pretty

40
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,139
sure bet this company's going to go

41
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,549
public eventually they're going to be

42
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,049
worth billions and billions of dollars

43
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:40,200
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get our return and</font>

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,459
they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it sort of helps them</font>

45
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,429
stay semi private ty entirely private so

46
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:47,439
Yelp for example got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred million</font>

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,259
dollar investment earlier this year from

48
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,599
elevation partners and Zynga which we've

49
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,299
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know range you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know revenue</font>

50
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,979
ranges have approached 250 million

51
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,139
dollars and that was just 2009 so who

52
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,060
knows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in 2010 anyway</font>

53
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,069
they got 180 million dollars also from

54
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">Digital Sky technologies and Mark</font>

55
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,139
Zuckerberg from Facebook and Mark Pincus

56
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,508
from zynga get to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> running a private</font>

57
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:11,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">company they don't have to answer to</font>

58
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:13,390
public shareholders lots of their

59
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,690
employees get a pretty nice return and

60
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,040
early investors do and they

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
get to just keep chugging along and

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,650
building it to something that's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

63
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a complete surefire bet in the public</font>

64
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,459
markets at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the goal so anyway</font>

65
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,069
holding company is stepping in allowing

66
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,780
entrepreneurs to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> running private</font>

67
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,370
companies that's why we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not seeing</font>

68
00:02:30,370 --> 00:00:00,000
IPOs thanks for joining<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>
