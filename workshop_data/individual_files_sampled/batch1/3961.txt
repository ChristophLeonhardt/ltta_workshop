Ray Dalio is one of the most successful investment managers in history he's built a firm bridgewater that is the largest hedge fund by multiples most successful he's now written a book called principles in which he's kind enough to tell us how he did it and how we can do it ray thank you so much for joining us it's thrilled to be here so here's your book congratulations I know in firsthand how hard it is to write a book and this is a particularly long and pithy one so congratulations on so let's start writing the first sentence you say I want to establish that I am a quote dumb who does not know everything he should know what do you mean by that's very charming and disarming start but what do what are we supposed to take well I think it's important I know that the key to my success has not been so much what I know as much as how I deal with my not knowing that's basically a big theme in the book how do you have an idea meritocracy there's only two things that you need to do in order to be successful the first is you have to know what the right decisions to make are and then you have to have the courage to make them and most people don't have in their heads the right decision and I think one of the greatest tragedies of man is that they hold on to opinions in their heads that are wrong and they don't go out there and stress test them so we have an idea meritocracy I mean there's a reason I wrote this book before I wrote economic and investment principles because that's really more sort of my skill set but in building an organization and are dealing with the markets to be able to have independent thinking and go beyond what you own individually no no in order to get the best is the key to success and you share in detail your own development of coming to developing these principles one of the events that you share would have been wildly traumatic for most people is that you talk about being fired from Shearson for punching your boss in the face what happened there well that was just you know I I was kind of wild then and it was New Year's Eve and I got drunk and he got drunk and you know we did that I punched him I didn't get fired for that he was a good guy we came in on you know the following Monday morning he said okay we're gonna past us I got fired for doing something else not far and I was a kind of a rebellious the the thing that affected me the most I would say was being so wrong in 1982 on the bottom of the stock market in other words that I anticipated that there would be a debt crisis with Mexico and in August Mexico defaulted on its debt and I thought we're gonna have an economic crisis because there would be this worldwide debt crisis which occurred right I know Mexicans just set the scene this was you had left Shearson you had started Bridgewater you'd had many years of being very successful you'd gotten very confident and you've made this huge controversial bet that we were headed into a next Great Depression and Nan right the debt the defaults came Mexico defaulted in August 1982 I thought wow we're gonna go in this crisis and everything was gonna fall apart and that was the exact bottom of the stock market like I couldn't have been more wrong and it was painfully wrong because I'd built the company up until that point we had we're a tight group of a small group of people I had to let everybody grow I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad I had testified to Congress because they asked me to explain this I had been on Wall Street we call all of those mistakes and it was very painful experience and it turned out to be probably the best experience of my life because it changed my attitude about thinking in other words rather than thinking I'm right I went to thinking how do I know I'm right and it created this open-mindedness it to be able to then go find the smartest people who disagreed with me and to see how they would think about things to be route balanced my bets better it taught me a radical open-mindedness it taught me what you were referring to in the beginning of the book that I'm trying to convey that the power of radical open-mindedness and an idea meritocracy is such a powerful thing and you talk a lot about how this process of pain and I can imagine that was just again a gut wrenching experience if have to fire all of your friends you have to rebuild from zero you start going forward you have to look in the mirror and say hey I was way too arrogant and confident I have to effectively relearn that's not an easy thing to do right I have a saying pain plus reflection equals progress right and I began to develop this knee-jerk reaction if I'm pain is a signal that something is wrong that you did something wrong if you make those mistakes and then to take that pain and to calm oneself down and think what would I have done differently in the future so my instincts change I view those experiences now like solving puzzles that will give me gems the puzzle is what would I do differently in the future so I would get a better result the gem is the principle that I would write down as I learned it so literally by writing down the principle when this one comes along what do I do with it there everything is another one of those like we have a million more those yes and if you start to say when one of those comes along how should I bets deal with it and you write down that recipe those are the principles so I found that exercise to be great and I also found that I could turn those principles into algorithms so let's say our investment process those criteria are built into literally algorithms and data can come in so I found that process of encountering pain to produce reflection to produce better ways of doing it to principles and then carrying that forward to decision-making has been invaluable and to do that with people who are going to disagree with me and to know how to do that well that's then the key to success and one of the first and most important principles that you outline is embrace the truth whatever it happens to be right a reality one of the very striking moments in the book is when you talk about how your top managers after you rebuild bridgewater into a success again basically came to you and said look here's what Ray does well he's a genius money manager and thinker and so forth but here's what Ray doesn't do well and I have to read this because for anybody leading other people just a very startling quote it says quote ray sometimes says or does things to employees that make them feel incompetent unnecessary humiliated overwhelmed belittled oppressed or otherwise bad and you say very candidly your first reaction was again like I don't want to do that these people I work with I don't want to have those consequences and on the other hand it's this radical straightforwardness and I want them to speak to me in a straightforward way so we were at a moment that's a that's a painful moment and then it's a moment of reflection should I not be as straightforward should they not be what could I do differently so what we decided to do was deal with it together like I thought that I should then ask the questions do you not want me to tell you what I think do you I would appreciate you doing the same with me in that straightforward so how should we be with each other and by agreeing how we should be with each other and writing those things down so that with this is what we're doing we began to get more of the management principles of how we are with each other because it's the key to their success but but it can be painful it can be under not understood well there are things in our brain neuroscientists tell me that there's a part of our brain which we call the prefrontal cortex the thoughtful part of our brain in which we sort of want to be Socratic ly straightforward we'd like to know what our weakness is is because it's logical and then there's an emotional part of the brain we understand the amygdala that is the fight-or-flight and it takes disagreement and it converts that into a battle and it's not easy and so those two parts of our brains are at odds and if we understand that and we work ourselves through at the end of the day can I be radically truthful with you like what's so bad about us being radically truthful with each other and radically transparent oh let's say one more thing so you understand Bridgewater okay Bridgewater is an idea meritocracy in which the goal is to have meaningful work and meaningful relationships they're equally important but to do those through radical truthfulness and radical transparency so you on a mission together meaningful work but your and you have these relationships in which you care if you have those relationships and you can understand that there's caring what was at the same time as that there's holding each other to high standards if there's tough love that that's a very powerful force and by being radically truthful and not political and being radically transparent we've been able to do that so that's the secret sauce in other words it's explained more comprehensively there but the results speak for themselves and you talk about the two parts of the brain the logical part emotions a lot of the book sounds like the process you've created is to take the emotion out of everything turn the business into a machine make all decisions use computers to aid decision making is there any part where emotion helps emotion but is not perfect I think emotion is the most important thing so let me distinguish between two things there's there's a there's emotion that's beneficial to you and there's a motion that's detrimental to you if your emotion is going to cause you to do something that you regret later that's that's a problem if the motion is helps you do the things that you want so I think the most important things are emotion the motion of inspiration the emotion of love the these are things what that's what I'm working for but to the emotions that we don't want to have is those that we regret afterwards so the notion here is to deal with emotion and not just to take it out but to put it in its right place so for example if somebody's having an emotional moment in a conflict then you you say how should we best handle that do we put it aside and we'll deal with it a little bit later do we have somebody help us through our conversation do we communicate by another vehicle email so that it can be logical and seeing less emotion the important thing is in order to have an idea meritocracy you have to do three things first you have to put your honest thoughts on the table for everybody to see so if everybody could put their honest thoughts on the table for everybody to see that's a great thing a lot of people have problems doing that but that's the difficulty but but not if it's the you got to do it otherwise it's the scenarios going on in your mind that might be wrong and it's not honest so what should be the problem there should be no problem you should feel good put it on the table let's look at it let's do it well the second step that you need to do is to have thoughtful disagreement in other words to know how to disagree well to take in information and and pass it through and to think things through so we have protocols for doing that so that we have a two minute rule and things that I could describe or described in the book that allow it that protocol to have a quality extreme exchange so that you together can get all of you to a better place than you could individually that's the power right and then you have a process that if you have a disagreement that remains how do you get past that disagreement and so you have to have a way ours is what we call believability weighted decision-making you know that and I could explain this if you want me to but in any relationship you need to have those things can you speak honestly with each other do you have good ways of working through disagreement in a productive way and do you have ways of getting past your disagreement that's true for any relationship right and one of the other principles that you stress is this idea that you should teach your team to fish rather than giving them fish but you got to give them room to make mistakes this is something that Jeff Bezos and many other incredibly innovative entrepreneurs have stressed again and again we have to get over the failure the fear of mistakes this seems to be a keeper to learn from mistakes and you learn from pain like I say you know you can scratch the car but you can't total the car okay you mistakes is one of the bays best sources of learning right successes mean you do the same thing over again and okay that's fine but mistakes that are painful stick when I look back on my career I think that the mistakes were the best things that happened to me I remember my mistakes better than my successes somehow there must have been more of the successes to get me where I am but I remember all the mistakes and I remember the lessons so that's what I mean by paying plus reflection equals progress so yeah it's okay for you to make mistakes it's not okay for you to not learn from those mistakes that's a principle in there right and so you have a culture that operates this way if you don't have a culture that operates this way it's not going to be self reinforcing and so the reason I'm talking about these types of principles rather than my economic and investment principles which will come out in the next book is because these are the most fundamental principles with to the basis of success and they're not just an investment it's out the investment firms principles it's not just a hedge funds principles it's like principles how we're going to deal effectively with each other let's talk a little bit about investing one of the things that as I've learned more about Bridgewater that I hear again and again is you've the radical transparency in the culture and among employees but your actual investment book and decisions are kept to a very small group is that for competitive reasons why do you do that well yeah proprietary reasons on anything like the particular algorithms the trades that we're doing it would disadvantageous our clients if we were to you know make that all public but the concepts are economic and investment concepts I'm happy to share I did this 30 minute video that basically how the economic machine works and in 30 minutes I told the most important things that I know about the economy because I want to pass that along I want to pass along things that are gonna be helpful to people I'm at a stage in my life where now my primary goal isn't to be more successful my primary goal is to help other people be successful when I first did this I thought this was so presumptuous it says in 2008 we anticipated the financial crisis and did well we received a lot of attention and then there were stories about what this environment is like that we're not accurate and I tried to stay below the radar not no media and then I was suggested I put the principles online they were downloaded over three million times and I received a lot of thank-you notes and so on well at this snot time I think that I sort of have a responsibility to pass along the things that I think of that valuable along those lines and I hope that'll encourage other people to do it when I think about them if I think about Jeff Bezos Jeff Bezos is a man who made of has formulas for successes he's got ripped recipes I think of principles or recipes for success so wouldn't it be great if Jeff Bezos had a book of recipes and that you say when you encounter that thing what do you do when you encounter that thing in a fun and I hope to encourage there in fact I am encouraging a number of people I won't mention their names but they're you know kind of luminaries fabulously successful people will be giving me principles and writing principles and I think if we look at those principles so when we encounter another one of those things we have principles to go to I think it would be good for you to write your principles and each person to write their principles and also to walk the talk so that way you know what you think others know what you stand for and are you operating that way I think at this time it's important to be principled I think our country needs to restate you know what are the principles that bind us together what are the ones that divide us how should we be with each other can we have idea meritocratic decision-making can we deal with who knows who's right and how do you work those through so this is something that's much more pervasive and I think very important well I think on behalf of everybody who reads your book it's been very valuable I've learned a lot from you from Jeff Bezos Steve Jobs and others there's so much to soak up from that so it's it's great on investing you've recently risen written that risks are rising because of the political atmosphere you've talked about how it looks a lot like 1937 that sounds very scary what do you mean by that well let me clear up on this this is not like 2007 8 2007 8 we could do the calculations of how much debt had to be paid by whom and we could see that that wasn't going to happen and that we were going to have a financial busting and that by and large economically we are at the part of the cycle that is not too hot and not too cold and assets have the right risk premiums and so on so it's a relatively stable kind of environment on the other hand it's very much like the 30s in that in 1929 32 like 2008 we a debt crisis took your interest rates to zero both of those times when interest rates hit zero you don't have the same kind of monetary policy so they print money they buy financial assets in both cases they did that caused an economic rebound in both of those cases and it caused the stock market to rise a lot in those particular cases and at the same time it did not resolve the wealth differences so that today the top one-tenth of 1% of the population has a net worth that is equal to the bottom 90% combined okay the wealth gap is the largest wealth gap that there has been since the nineteen thirty five to forty period and so while we have good conditions here for the bottom sixty percent of the population we have bad conditions so you the average averages don't convey what the picture is this because of this disparity and so what was tapped into and what we see is there's a large percentage of the population who as is it all who was hurting and that there is a conflict between the haves and the have-nots and the and liberal ideas and conservative ideas and all of that and we are having a greater polarity in the 30s we had populism in other words the selection of leaders who were strong leaders in a battle of one segment against the other segment and/or inclined to fight for the certain things and so as we come into this period it's somewhat similar to that we will have as we go forward obligations demographics is going to affect our obligations we're right now at the point where pension obligations not only debt obligations pension obligations health care obligations all of those are going to gradually sort of squeeze us and we have that division and so it's very similar to that and we're also at a point where 1937 was when the Fed said and that we could tighten monetary policy and they put a slight tightness and monetary policy in my opinion the risks are asymmetric on the downside in other words if you tighten monetary policy certainly by more than is this counted in the market and what's the scan on the market is a very minor rise in market that that will reverberate through asset class prices as well as then you could have a situation in terms of the economy so it's similar in that interest rates are close to zero not much room on the downside obligations are large there is a political division there is more populism therefore there's more conflict and therefore we need to be very careful at this moment that's what I'm basically saying and you have spent more than 45 years betting on the future given that picture you dis painted what is your bet for the future well I think we're in the process of watching how conflict is going to be handled politically and that's being reflected not only internationally with something like Korea or Iran and so on but we're also dealing with conflict on taxes and so on I think that one of the things that Donald Trump did extremely well was to identify a constituency that was not heard and that he did that as a pro-business person in other words somebody who is going to be businesslike and and create that environment that group it could have been tapped into also by more of a socialist and what we have is a capitalist who is doing that but in any case whether socialists and capitalists working together to focus on that I think that issue has been raised and now we deal with the issue we're going to find out the question is really is Donald Trump he's going to be aggressive is he aggressive and thoughtful or is he aggressive and reckless and when we work through these these situations we're going to find out more and more I think the fact that he's working across the lines personally I like the negotiations with the Democratic side and I think a lot of Americans do and so on and to see that you know cut that deal in a way if we can - Oh deal with the whole of the economy is something that I'm all in favor for so we're in the process of finding this out right you recommend that most portfolios should contain some gold Wow course why a lot of people think it's not of course in fact it doesn't make sense well first of all to structure a portfolio the best way to structure a portfolio is is to have the right kind of balance in your portfolio so and some amount of gold gold services purpose it is first of all a diversifier against other assets you know we have this risk-on risk-off thing we have we also have a monetary system we have a Brentwood's monetary system began after World War two and it had the dollar as the world's reserve currency there's a risk there there's a lot of dollar-denominated debt and so on if somebody did felt that they didn't want to hold that and so on you could have exposures to that so it's a diversifying asset in that is sensible and and you know that's the main reason to have gold in the portfolio five to ten percent people I don't understand it people will have more in terms of cash or they'll I want the key in to in terms of being able to have a successful portfolio as your core portfolio in other words what's your strategic asset allocation mix what is your if you're oh I got it let me ask you about Bitcoin okay Bitcoin people say the same thing it's a store of value you got to have diversified the dollars not safe it's been going up and up and up yet recently crashed Jamie Dimon came out and said it's complete fraud he'd fire anybody at JPMorgan who invested in it because he wouldn't want people that's stupid working for him what do you think there are two purposes of a currency is it a medium of exchange and is it a store hold of wealth those are the basic ingredients bitcoin is not an effective medium exchange by and large and if I coach I have a Bitcoin I want to go buy things it's not easy to buy things with the Bitcoin and in terms of a store hold of wealth a store hold of wealth more reflects like gold more flex the opposite of what money is doing right and so you look at it's a store hold of wealth bitcoin is a speculative it's a speculative bubble right its price is like a greater fool theory in terms of its price if you say what is its intrinsic value if if bitcoin was made into a more effective medium of exchange and also operated in terms of a store hold of wealth not of the reflection of that volatility it would be a viable instrument it is to me a vehicle for speculation that's attracting people in and it has all the classic ingredients of a bubble people leveraging themselves up and it doesn't have that same intrinsic value even the privacy value okay is suspect suspicious in other words it has a purpose to some extent if you're living in a country and you don't know your currency it was whether it's gonna be good or not and you might hole try to hold that but that thing you're holding is running around like crazy for reasons that you don't understand and then it's so it's not gonna be an effective store holder wealth and the privacy will be stress tested in other words governments are examining who is operating in their own clever ways of what that and so you can't even assume that that's so it's gonna be a privacy vehicle so I don't see the effectiveness of Bitcoin I could see cyber secure currencies and and so on but crypto currencies but this is not what we're having it's it's you know it's a possibility that I think is has been captured as a speculative vehicle that's in the middle of the bubble said something else about investing that I think it's very profound and simple I think a lot of people don't understand which is to be successful as an investor you have to bet against the consensus and be right first of all why why can't we just buy stocks we think well the code the consensus is built into the price so because the consensus is built to the price in assets price themselves in a way that they're all they're all compete and they're all of equal value in certain sense there's there's a risk premium of equities over cash and bonds we'll have that over whatever but it's basically they're all priced that way it's like think of it as going - betting on a sports team or in other words you or a horse-racing okay so there's handicapping that's going on so in order to be successful you're betting against the consensus and you have to be right that's that's the game and you described your first trade when you were a teenager bought a stock it tripled you thought hey this is easy but you convey very effectively that in fact it is extremely difficult even though it seems so simple ah being successful in the markets is more difficult than being successful in competing in the Olympics your odds are higher to be successful competing in the Olympics because you have more people trying to do it you have more resources we put hundreds of millions of dollars we have at Bridgewater 15-under people we are now competing against other teams and that's the kind of resources that are going into playing that particular game so think about that in terms of handicapping it it's not an easy thing to do what you can do is achieve balance you can you can to know how to hold a balanced portfolio and to receive something that is a return that's much better than cash achieving balance is something that you can do and and I think that that but it figure if you're going to enter the game since value added is a zero-sum game you have to ask who are you playing against what is you going to the poker game with and you know do you want to do that and as you talk to people in the real world is your sense that people understand what they're up against when they might buy a stock or try to time-honoured institutional investors who are smart by and large understand that the average man tends to be much more reactive if you look at the purchases and sales that they make when something goes up they're more likely to buy it they think ah that's a good investment they don't know how to measure that in terms of oh is that a much more expensive investment that's more likely to go down so that's why you know you put ads in newspapers and they say ah that's what had that return that's what they're attracted to so they tend to my high and sell low and so they're not the average man should not be playing this game in that way they should be playing the game and humility if you if you think that you're good at playing the game just make sure that it's like going to the poker table or going to the racetrack do it with a little bit of money and watch it and get the best advice that you can to know that you're gonna be able to take money out of the system rather than put it in right you've written a terrific book thank you so much for sharing your life and wisdom and and best of luck congratulations thank you thanks appreciate it
