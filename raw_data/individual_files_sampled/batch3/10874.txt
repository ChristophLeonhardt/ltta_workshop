police in Vienna have charged three men with provocation for waving an Israeli flag at pro-palestinian demonstrators the rally in December was in response to Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel the Israeli activists deny they were being provocative claiming they only produce their flag after having anti-semitic abuse held at them it all started with slogans in English like downtown USA or down down Israel then we heard them shouting Intifada child-murderer Israel and death to Israel a president of the Belgian League against anti-semitism says action should have been taken against the pro-palestinian demonstrators Austrian police they should have arrested those people in the dis anti Israeli demonstration were shouting anti-semitic slogans we saw several incident occur in those last weeks and months in Europe following the Declaration of US President on akram regarding Jerusalem but also even more violent attacks those last years in several European countries in Paris in Toulouse in Brussels and other places in Copenhagen so Jews work because there were Jews so we are facing a violent wave of anti-semitic actions and it can need even two killings of Jews in Europe today
