I'm Danielle home I'm the chef and co-owner of Eleven Madison Park Nomad and make nice I think a really good pan it's important sounds simple but a really good pan with the super flat bottom we use copper pans here because they have really great heat distribution I think you need a sharp knife and I use Victorinox knife it's a knife that I grew up with is the Swiss brand so I had it all my life so the knife is a very big part of a chef but then there's maybe also one other tool that's maybe a little bit unusual that every one of us uses and it's a cake tester and with a cake tester as you cook you can check the doneness you can check the temperature but that's really a super valuable tool and it cost about 75 cents or so so it's a great tool but I'm not a chef of you know really fancy equipment I basically work with we just want a good tan a good knife cake tester good cutting board very much
