<font color="#E5E5E5">of views so I thought I'd take a moment</font>

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,670
to reflect on the past decade I first

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,100
blown away by the hundreds of people who

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,989
were posting video responses introducing

47
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube community was so incredibly</font>

48

small all the video bloggers worldwide

49
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,549
pretty much knew each other it was nice

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,500
but being one of the only main video

opportunity to do that but I had

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,590
organized the first UK gathering earlier

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,239
the year as well if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I recall correctly</font>

58

the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> age of people going to these</font>

59
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,879
gatherings back then was around 25 and I

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,040
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking to myself I really</font>

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,590
need to grow up and so I have over the

62

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,480
things have changed by the end of 2007

65
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,280
these events attracted a lot more

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,590
interest in enthusiasm if you turn

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,760
around who's here even news

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,830

year-on-year under the name stick aid

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,670
with its peak in 2011 where millions

84
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,680
tuned in and tens of thousands of

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollars were raised to get invited to</font>

speak at the world's biggest YouTube

88
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,720
this was inspiring to say the least um

this is gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an all good questions i</font>

creating videos with a small webcam sat

on top of my laptop did the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> but made</font>

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,299
an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise whenever I tried</font>

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,650
not to become too distracted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube</font>

99
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,269
understandably because back then online

100
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,040
video was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not perceived as an obvious</font>

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,780
stepping stone towards employment I

102
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,299
maintained a healthy balance and one day

103
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,099
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a message from lecturers saying</font>

104
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,810
that I had been quoted in dissertations

105
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,790
by students studying teaching as a

106
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,739
result I was asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talks to</font>

107
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,120
students on YouTube as a tool for

108
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,310
education and was even<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought into the</font>

109

fold with their blended learning

department I studied psychology with the

111
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,919
intent of one day becoming a counselor

112
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,989
because the well-being of others is what

113
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,820
keeps me going in life but<font color="#E5E5E5"> after going</font>

114
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,260
through depression myself and

115
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,418
broadcasting my experiences with a video

116
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,640
called you are not alone which received

117
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,890
an incredible response it was yet

118
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,330
another reason why I believe

119
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,159
future of helping people was to be

120
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,800
undertaken via online video instead with

121
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">the community still rather small back</font>

122
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,520
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was often in contact with the</font>

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,650
YouTube staff providing feedback on

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've launched miles you're</font>

126
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,409
raising some very big points about our

civil liberties one of them was<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

ask the PM receiving a video response

129
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,009
from our country's leader was very

130
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,259
surreal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and opened my mind further to</font>

131
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,409
the possibilities this technology has in

132
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,060
2009 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BBC wanted to tap into this</font>

community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they contacted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me to find</font>

134
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,960
out if I fancied spending six hours a

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,150
day in a glass box installed in a town

136

138
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,110
really had in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I was up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

139
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,669
however I soon discovered they were

140
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,349
approaching other youtubers as well

141
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,360
using us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage our audience to</font>

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,159
their show whilst knocking each other

143
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,500
out so I contacted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> others and said</font>

144
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,840
hey let's team up and work together and

145
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,180
so we did as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> beat the competition</font>

146
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,639
show after show of ease due to our large

147
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,529
online following it caused a lot of

148
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,349
controversy especially since we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were not</font>

149
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,449
a traditional act this was a time when

150
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">online community and the digital power</font>

151
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,250

<font color="#CCCCCC">any real regrets I think the closest</font>

231
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,429
I've come to that was back in the day

232
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,229
when YouTube had a front page that they

233
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,660
featured content on if you got picked

234
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,699
you would get hundreds of thousands of

235
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">years overnight and many of those people</font>

236
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,620
went on to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge audiences it could</font>

00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,550
young immature and shouldn't have felt

240
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,140
so bitter about not getting featured

241
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,019
back then but I did and made a video

242
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:04,910
about it after a new video blogger from

243
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,130
the UK got featured called charlie is so

244
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,810
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> like although it was a huge mistake</font>

245
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,209
on my part which led to large amounts of

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,699
drama within a community I loved the

247
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,560
reason I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't fully regret it was</font>

248
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,630
because the knock-on effect was learning

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,060
from it maturing and becoming really

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">what about your opinion well you're not</font>

260

<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna have a say because your opinion</font>

261
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,930
means nothing where I band comments to

262
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,610
prove the point I lost a lot of

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,520
original intention but I'd be lying if I

333
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,110
said I didn't love being invited to

334
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,760
events around the world getting

<font color="#CCCCCC">conversations with so many people now if</font>

337
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,940
I attend these events I could walk

338
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">around and blend in with the crowd while</font>

339
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,690
watching old friends still enjoying the

340
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,330
spotlight but don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me wrong I get</font>

341
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,610
it though it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cycle of a</font>

342

product but when that product is a human

343
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,110
being it hurts at first and it's been a

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,940
huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning curve for me in life the</font>

345
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,800
world has changed significantly the past

lot the online community with video is

no longer one gigantic pyramid that can

349
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,970
be viewed all at once because there are

350
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,190
now thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them subjects once</font>

followings video is consumed on multiple

353
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,580
platforms and even the traditional

354
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,520
notion of celebrity is breaking down we

creator or are considering becoming one

358
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,520
don't fall for the trap of doing

359
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,110
something just because it's popular

360
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,600
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may look back in years time</font>

361
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,550
wishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you were done saying more</font>

362
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,320
in line with your real passions I'm

363
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,930
certainly glad I did stay true to

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself and you will get to exist</font>

with old<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends I miss perhaps our</font>

paths will cross again someday

371
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,540
unfortunately that can't always happen

372
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,400
though with some friends no longer with

us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this world but whose legacies</font>

374

looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> back I realize the moments I've</font>

376

enjoyed most have been where I've

spotted an opportunity and just gone for

378
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,720
them wholeheartedly that's what I must

379
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,730
keep doing some people miss the way I

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years ago others five years ago</font>

381
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and some prefer me now but if there is</font>

382
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,930
one key lesson I've learned from making

383
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube videos it is that each upload</font>

384
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,640
represents just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a snapshot in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time an</font>

385
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,540
idea a facet of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> memory a digital</font>

386
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,560
footprint that Colette

387
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,790
tively will have the biggest possible

388
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,460
impact if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can to keep</font>

389
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">running off into the future with passion</font>

390
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,990
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to end this with my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all-time</font>

391
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,300
favorite comment which was posted on my

392
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,730
first ever video blog disclaimer it was

393
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,070
posted as a joke many years later which

394
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,870
is why it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so brilliant can you imagine</font>

395
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">if this was posted when I first joined</font>

396
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,790
YouTube in 2006 to think if I took

397
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,150
notice and became discouraged you

398
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,260
wouldn't be watching this video right

399
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,770
now so if you are a content creator take

400
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,620
my advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't be discouraged so to</font>

401
