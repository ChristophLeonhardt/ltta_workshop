00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:15,241
ANY RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN WOULD CALL AUTHORITIES OR NOT TAKE THE

165
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:15,608
CALL AUTHORITIES OR NOT TAKE THE MEETING.

166
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,643
MEETING. SO MAYBE THERE’S PITY FOR THE

167
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:18,410
SO MAYBE THERE’S PITY FOR THE GUY IN THE MOMENT.

168
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:19,545
GUY IN THE MOMENT. I WOULD SAY IN THE BIG PICTURE,

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,125
BUT I THINK THAT IT’S ALSO INTERESTING THAT EVEN THE PEOPLE

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,865
INTERESTING THAT EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP THE TRUMP

179
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:41,101

SOMEONE ON THE CAMPAIGN STAFF SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE PHONE

205
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,511
SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE PHONE AND CALLED THE FBI.

206
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,647
AND CALLED THE FBI. IT’S ILLEGAL TO ACCEPT OR

207
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,183
IT’S ILLEGAL TO ACCEPT OR SOLICIT DONATIONS FROM A FOREIGN

214
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:41,528

215
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:43,230

SO THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATURE OF THIS MEETING HAS

217
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:47,034
FEATURE OF THIS MEETING HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FACT THAT NO ONE

218
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:47,734
ALWAYS BEEN THE FACT THAT NO ONE CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

219
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:50,303
CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT’S MADE EVEN MORE ACUTE BY

220
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,439
THAT’S MADE EVEN MORE ACUTE BY THE FACT THAT THE FBI WARNED THE

221
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:53,640
THE FACT THAT THE FBI WARNED THE CAMPAIGN THAT THEY BELIEVED THEY

222
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,442
CAMPAIGN THAT THEY BELIEVED THEY MIGHT BE APPROACHED BY RUSSIANS

223
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:56,877
MIGHT BE APPROACHED BY RUSSIANS WHO WERE TRYING TO INTERFERE

224
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,746
WHO WERE TRYING TO INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION.

225
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,748
WITH THE ELECTION. IT’S REALLY A BIG PICTURE PIECE
