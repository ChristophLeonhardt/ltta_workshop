alright there's one thing I know Donald Trump thinks that immigration is bad and and in fact it's even ruining Europe I know that because he tweets it all the time including this this one but he's done it at least half a dozen times he tweeted we don't want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us Wow okay that's really apparently disastrous he talks about how immigrants have changed the culture of Europe for the worse so you don't want the immigrants in there it'll change things now France seems to be doing rather okay in at least some areas one being the World Cup they just won the World Cup so la Bleu vive la France right but I'm sure that they kept their quote unquote culture as the right wing keeps referring to it both in that country and in our country and all over Europe intact right data probably didn't have any immigrants at all because the superior culture according to these racists is the white nationalist culture but we'll find out about that in a second but this has been around a long time remember back when France won their first World Cup in 1998 I'm gonna show you what their team looked like it was also very multicultural they had players who were either them or their parents were born in Africa and some who were Arab a in fact zinedine zidane arguably the best player in the world but if not the best certainly in the top five an Arab Muslim was the best player on France and critical in winning that World Cup and that drove the right-wing crazy back then in fact people like jean-marie lepen called the team black Blanc at BER and what that means is black white and Arab and of course they used that phrase derisively so sometimes people will call me brown and go I got you right mmm I don't care okay you correctly deduce my skin color so black white an Arab doesn't have to be the rest of at all but they use it that way and it was an insult okay they're insulted except they won the World Cup so apparently that combination works but of course the right wing didn't learn from that and in fact his daughter Marilla who's now a popular politician when the right-wing in France as late as 2010 said that she was worried about immigrants being on the French national team because they have quote another nationality in their hearts now of course she had no evidence of that and at all but come on they're not white so they're immigrants of course they have another nationality in their hearts that can't be loyal to France well I don't hear a lot of them talking now because now France's won its second World Cup and with this team the 2018 team is massively diverse and filled with immigrants and so all of a sudden even the right wing and Friends is kind of quiet I love for someone as Donald Trump about and you think it's ruined France's culture to have those immigrants in and gotten worse results for the country seems like they got far better results now to give you a sense of how many the players they're immigrants 19 of its 23 players are immigrants or the children of immigrants 19 out of 23 I did the math that's eighty two point six percent and by the way a great number of those are also Muslims so what happened I thought that multiculturalism was bad in in all regards I thought it was gonna ruin the country turns out he doesn't ruin the country multiculturalism adds to the country and why is the right-wing quiet at least for now in France because and this is what they were worried about because sports brings people together and it and it gives you a national identity and and it's tied in with your national identity so they didn't want people in France rooting for blacks Arabs Muslims and immigrants too bad for you they did and it turns out they had spectacular success and so now all the people of France are proud of that team because it turns out yes multiculturalism works I guarantee you that if you look in the comment section below you'll see people making racist comments about how some people are good at just athletics and then you'll say well hey have they not made a contribution in culture in other ways whether it's cuisine or or it's a said well they okay they're good at that too but you know that's just dancing and music and eating and sports and then well how about all the professors and all the other people in the other Arab see but those are those are just like small cases but but to this and abut that and then do you think France would have been world champions without immigrants in conceivable and it didn't make France weaker it made France stronger vive la France two easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
