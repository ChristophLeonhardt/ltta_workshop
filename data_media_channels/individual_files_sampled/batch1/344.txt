hello and welcome to the stream live on al-jazeera and YouTube if the o-p-s new Prime Minister has worked at a rapid pace since being sworn in eleven weeks ago now Abbey Ahmed is aiming to mend relations with wartime foe Eritrea I'm Malika Vela and I'm Mohammad Javad Dean today we'll discuss just how strong prospects are for lasting peace between the two countries and consider how a bee can lead without alienating his critics we are fully committed to reconcile with our Eritrean brothers and sisters those are the words of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abbey Ahmed in his inaugural address to parliament in April now Abbey and the ruling EP RDF are offering to give up disputed land to Eritrea as part of a final peace deal 18 years after a deadly war between the two countries Eritrea has so far been quiet on the latest offer but has said in the past that Ethiopia must first pull its troops out of the disputed areas nonetheless there has been support for the peace plan in most parts of Ethiopia the editor-in-chief of the Addis standard applauds Abi's performance so far saying he has been firm when decisiveness was needed on the issues of future relations with Eritrea and community member jakub abram told us that almost everyone is happy with ABI whom he calls a visionary leader but there has been criticism - it's a gray and People's Liberation Front which has dominated the ruling coalition for decades says Ivy and the coalition's Executive Committee did not consult the 180 member council before announcing his plan meanwhile there been protests in the northern Tigre region where most of the disputed land lies many people there say that handing land to Eritrea is a betrayal of those who fought for the land during the war so what is the likelihood of forging a final deal to the benefit of both it co pians and air trans to discuss this we're joined from Kia Staffordshire by the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom by lol oh he is a lecturer in law he'll University from the Ethiopian capital addis ababa we have Daniel bet honey he's the founder of Horn affairs and online magazine covering issues on the Horn of Africa and for the Eritrean perspective we have a wet well demichiel in Kingston Ontario he's an associate professor of African and world history at Queen's University and joining us from London Ezra how well dubs of hatsue she's a political scientist and independent researcher on African affairs she's also an adviser to the Africa youth movement welcome to this dream everyone I what I want to start with you what was your reaction when you heard Prime Minister Abi's announcement thank you very much for having me my initial reaction was optimism cautious optimism that peace finally was to have a chance and the Horn of Africa in general in the relationship between the two countries in particular but the fact that international law has been violated or the two countries existed after the legal settlement of the matter for more than 16 years immediate solution was not going to come just from announcements and there would be a lot of entrenched interests that would be threatened by such bold and courageous and forward-looking moves that the the Ethiopian prime minister at the Ahmed has promised or committed Ethiopia to and so the challenges are inevitable I am hopeful that he will weather weather challenges and would stay the course and we'll see Eritrea and Ethiopia enter a new phase of rebuilding relationships rehabilitating communities especially in the border area and working together to for regional peace and economic mutual economic benefit mmm so bold and courageous Daniel you heard what about had to say there about this announcement and about this move what do you think about yes I concur with the 20 hour the decision the mystery tram border is a very problematic politically significant political context so it was both it was dumped from me it was surprising the same time it kept me wonder what has been what has been going on in the background you'd assume there must have been a back-channel talking talk with azmera about these issues before the announcement and you also multi-hued also wonder whether there have been there might have been a discussion or a package period about the details because the agreement is not just about the water or it's not just about polymer or another piece of land but there are a host of issues related with normalization and peace between the two countries but after two or three days with silence from Asmara and with public display of discontent or disagreement on the matter it has become apparent that it was just another round of attempt by European to make peace with area this time by a neutral mister but came across one because were playing anyway well you know it's interesting to hear you talk about that the history and also whether Eritrea should respond or not a lot of people weighing in on line about that rozelle us on Twitter saying the Parliament has accepted the decision a long time ago in the dead Prime Minister of Ethiopia was sitting on it until he died all what he did is resurrect the file and give an executive decision millions of Ethiopians and eretrians are rejoicing but you know we also have people who are wondering why Eritrea should respond at all proud to be Eritrean saying how is it up to Eritrea while Ethiopia is still occupying Eritrean territories when Prime Minister Abbey orders his troops from the occupied territories then it will be in Eritrea courts if not all he is doing is a PR stunt I will when you see these tweets and people you know saying the troops are the key issue what what do you think let me just start by saying that this is truly a fantastically exciting moment for Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa and generally because Ethiopia is just beginning to play the kind of geopolitical role that is befitting of the size and also its importance in the region and I think Abby's dr. Abbey's outreach to the Eritrean government declaring Ethiopia's readiness to accept the urges argument and the decision of me if you be an Eritrean Boundary Commission is precisely part of this attempt to link up reforms within Ethiopia with the border reforms that he thinks is necessary within within the region so Ethiopia's outreach right now to the patron government is a very critical and bold move as my friend said the previous government for various reasons has failed to comply with the obligation that has accepted it has brought to the Parliament and had its ratified those are internal is European issues and some politics within TBMs mainly but this is an absolutely important moment for ET opere to make that overture for 1283 and I think one is almost incredible is the silence of the 18 states in the face of this world grant form from the European government raha woody what do you make of what I was saying because of course you know that in the backdrop to those tweets is that the Eritrean government has not responded to this announcement yeah I understand that people who might expect that the AirTrain government would have an immediate response to the s and maybe rejoice about this news but this is not the first time that in an Ethiopian Prime Minister or the Parliament has declared in some form that they will abide by the BBC the airchair Ethiopia boundary Commission's decision Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said in fact in November 2004 that he agrees with the Algiers peace agreement and the decision in principle then he continued to outline five points like discussion to open up negotiations I believe also the previous Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has made mention that it is important to have peace with Eritrea and for this border conflict to be resolved but this has been going on for the last 16 years these announcements their Parliament has had these discussions in Ethiopia and we have still not seen anything happens so I mean as much as most of us might want to see every action from the AirTrain side I think it's safe to say that you know it's a situation where will will will believe it when it happens right will believe it when the Ethiopian troops let's get what's comments there first but but look what you started right everyone has something to say about that so why do you go first two things one the Algiers agreement is a very short agreement that has nothing about normalization of relations or economic ties between the two countries it's an international treaty meant to end the conflict so I would want to correct what my friend in Addis Daniel Brahimi said on the question that Rael was responding to from a purely legal point of view the Eritrean government is under no obligation to say anything in response to what the Ethiopian government has said and sure enough if you given Ethiopia is abysmal record of Honor and international treaties it's understandable that Eritrea is uncertain on whether this is one more false start or this is a serious commitment on the part of the new prime minister on the flip side however from a political and diplomatic point of view Eritrea silence is not consistent with or does not fall in line with the dynamics in Ethiopia in the past several months especially since a Bahamut to power that the Prime Minister has been making some of the boldest internal and international moves that are not only beneficial for Ethiopia but also beneficial to Eritrea and the whole region and a trailer would be remiss if it does not jump in and help the the positive or the constructive hand of the of the new and dynamic prime minister and in this regard I do agree with Allah completely except that it's not an obligation on Eritrea to respond which then leaves us with Ethiopia still having the ball on its court if Prime Minister Abbey is serious about this announcements which he made and I have no reason to question his seriousness not just him but also the executive of the epr DF which is a bunch of very young highly dynamic highly educated forward-looking men and women question can I jump in very quickly here well if I can if I let me just finish this this idea I have no reason to question their their intent in the in the declaration and the the ball being still on their field I encouraged them to go through with their declaration and implement it on the ground which is that the unilateral pulling of the forces of occupation because the lands that Ethiopia is still occupied is no longer disputed land as our hosts have been pointed out this are clearly I hear you I hear your point they're ours I know I was trying to get an arrow now I fully agree with both ours and our other guests that Ethiopia has failed to comply with the obligation that it said it will completely abide by but the fact that the territory that is now given to an engineer is a territory that has been under to European control for such a long time but there are people who leave on those territory makes it imperative for the two countries to sit down and negotiate on how to decide on a prosthetic issues and the history of those individuals and people who lived under Title II so if Ethiopia accepts the decision of the Commission why would it be difficult for the Indian government to come to the table and have a conversation about this well a great question that's a great question forgive me go ahead finish up we wouldn't expect any responsible state around the world to remain silent in the face of you your adversary making that kind of overture but if I can stop you right there I will because you talk about overtures and giving you know something to Eritrea and that Eritrea should come to the table asking why don't they a lot of people online Malika and it's a really heated discussion around this point around this point as to whether Eritrea should come to the table and and more importantly if you look at this YouTube comment that came in from Kimi hade they're saying it's important to understand that Ethiopia is not giving anything new essentially the EE BC ruling declares that bad May is and always will be it has been a part of Eritrea which is occupied by Ethiopia a lot of people on Twitter also if you look at this moosie saying Eritrea has been calling for the implementation of this agreement for the last 16 years but the u.s. the UN and others failed to pressure Ethiopia so maybe the question is then you know this last line Eritrea doesn't have to respond until the full withdrawal actually happens because as you see right there a lot of people saying actions speak louder than world words let's give a rile can I jump it yes but then I want to hear also from Rael go ahead you're absolutely right that that from a purely legal point of view this is something I want to point out over and over again from a purely legal point of view Eritrea doesn't need to say anything if you Opia has to withdraw its troops and then things would be normalized or talks toward normalization would start but from a purely diplomatic and political point of view it would be remiss not to get involved as Allah is saying but one thing that I want to point out is that vadoma has never been Ethiopian and the residents of vadoma today or in the past 16 years the vast majority of them are part of Ethiopian resettlement schemes that have been happening in the past 16 years or immediately after the EBC ruling so let's let's not evidence to support that claim and I think the point that you made that there is no legal obligation on the part of your interior to respond and I think that is also a very problematic claim because if there is a legal settlement between the two countries the only way in which that and legal settlement that decision would take effect is if those two countries come together so I wasn't I well I hear you but I don't want to go too much further in this conversation without at least seeing some of the words of the people in that region because of course this conversation sometimes can feel a very high-minded but I want to talk to people on the ground and Reuters The News Agency judge did just that Aaron macho he's a journalist for Reuters he spoke to residents of the town above me in the northern tigre region about this announcement and this is just a sampling of what they told him a read one out why did we fight for Bad's made to just give it all away all this sacrifice for nothing for this another person speaking to Reuters says the thought of moving these bodies from where they were sacrificed it's a desecration of their honor they should not expect peace here if they force us to leave there will be violence so just two residents speaking to the Reuters news agency about something that's going to affect their lives Rahul I know you wanted to get in here what do you make of what some residents are saying yeah if this show was about yeah a couple of weeks weeks long then we'd have enough time to discuss about the complicated situation around the Eritrean border conflict but trust me when I say that this is not an issue about just body man this is the the the ground in which that or the real roots of the conflict are much more complicated than that you know hearing those comments from those residents from bud Amer I found them quite heartbreaking especially when we talk about the desecration of of the graves you know Eritrea had fought a 30-year liberation struggle in order to get its independence and then was then had to go back went back to war with Ethiopia between 1998 and 2000 and despite all those things that have happened including the deportation of thousands of eretrians and if the opens of Eritrean origins and Ethiopia the thousands of young people that were killed one thing that I've heard repeatedly said by Arab people is that they will they they find it hard to forgive the tlf regime or the Ethiopian government for the fact that during the border conflict they desecrated the graves of Eritrean martyrs now it just so happens that tomorrow is going to be the commemoration of Eritrean martyrs day and so I know a lot of air trains across the world are reflecting on this but the point is what I would like to make is that when reconciliation does happen it is going to go beyond just it should it would have to go beyond just the troops leaving the territory it would have to involve the people also talking with each other not in terms of whether or not how people should be moved or not but how can we also reconcile the pain and the trauma that has been going on from more than 50 years we counted all together right you know to have sustained peace you make you make a good point about you know the history and the pain and you know we put those quotes forward because a lot of people are actually talking about how the agreement was actually drafted as you see bad May on Twitter here saying bad May you're a triangle saying it was drafted without the consultation of the local communities most affected by the borders the demarcation dividing villages and Families but then we also have a benezia arguing the flipside to what you're saying saying here the government of Ethiopia accepted the international verdict as it is but Ethiopia cannot order its military to leave the strategic positions without some assurance of some form from the government of Eritrea so you know this person thinks that the Prime Minister is taking the high road but because we spoke spoke about the legal aspect of this what it actually comes down to legally I do want to quickly share Leah Brill mayor's video that she sent us she's the former lead counsel for Eritrea she was involved obviously in some of these negotiations back when take a listen to this so I was asked to comment on what legal steps are that need to be taken next to mark the new boundary and actually all the legal steps have already been taken there's only one thing that remains to be happen to happen and that's not a legal thing that's a practical thing Ethiopia has to remove its troops it's time for Ethiopia to get its troops off of Eritrean territory there are no legal steps remaining to be taken no Daniel I understand you think this is nothing new but based on that last comment from Lea what do you think I mean is that the most practical step no it's not practical in fact I'd like to point out a point of three points acutely first the decision by the eldership was not necessarily a negative decision or annal decision not necessarily of course it was vague deliberately deliberately deliberately so but at least we can assume we could have assumed that the virtual demarcation of which it would have been resistant for several years was vaguely accepted by the appeared if statement Eritrea could have accepts it could have respected that decision that announcement and could have closed the file the first protest rally came after four days and the osmolarity deliberately stayed quite and as a reason as a result they taken leadership started backtracking and now they are saying there's no new policy so there was a chance forties or which is as a forty close shut the door on the second point is the largest agreement is not just about the border Lebanon a few pointers have accelerated or prisoners of war have ever responded about the whereabouts of : visible Petros happy treatable or detained people as furs are just agreements whether the arrow people and other people in rough area continent abduct people from the border to this day and there are also other poles cessation of hostility thus also parts of larger agreements if there continues to host rebels this was an accusation by trip this is a charge confirmed by the United Nations winter group also Mara Amira and the sun points i wanna i want to give someone else a chance to respond final point in daniel go ahead your final point portent it's not like the territories on which european army standards currently is not necessarily the territory we claim some of those areas are attackin troops are stationed there for said for the sake of military strategy okay what I think is the obvious and there is not a single border on the African continent that there does not exist an ethnic linguistic group on both sides the borders that we have here in Africa were set by colonization and unfortunately we have to deal with these borders because in today's modern world we have to you know have States if peace was possible if you t yo Pitt was serious is serious about having peace with Eritrea they would demilitarize the border relations and it would it would it be it's not even think about this in terms of you know should we have pillars or or walls to make the borders if Ethiopia fully agrees with the ABC you just final decision and remove their troops normalization will not talk we're not gonna discuss what to put the poles we're gonna talk about how we can sell great you know our diversity and commonalities between these borders between these raha I'm going to be there because as you mentioned this could be a week of shows that's all the time we have for today's show I know goes very quickly I want to give the remaining time in our show to our community what are they saying about this well you know there's a lot of different people who are lamenting how many lives have been lost we have get to chow Jem tastes are saying considering the precious lives lost and all the resources wasted it's a very painful concession from Ethiopia even if it was decided however many years ago but if this helps us achieve a lasting peace between the two countries we just have to move on keep your comments coming
