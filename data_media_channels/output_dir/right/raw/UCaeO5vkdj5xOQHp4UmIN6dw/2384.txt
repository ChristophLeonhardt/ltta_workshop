people with different viewpoints are

goal and seeking that vote it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

357

<font color="#E5E5E5">up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rules there was disagreement</font>

368
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,779
going

369
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rules Committee about the rules</font>

370
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,139
package that was adopted<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a lot</font>

371
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,999
of delegates who various for various and

372
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,310
sundry reasons wanted a roll call on

373
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,529
that that's all we wanted and they shut

374
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,779
that down it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunate because we</font>

375
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,629
need these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people we the people who feel</font>

376
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,249
differently about the rules for whatever

377
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,319
reason are the very same people<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

378
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,329
Republican Party will need come November

379

<font color="#E5E5E5">help us win elections at the top of the</font>

380
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:53,420
ticket the bottom of the ticket

381
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,790
everywhere in between fit see the thing

382
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,589
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I mean this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy I thought that</font>

383
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:58,879
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of nonsense what are you saying</font>

384
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,379
there I mean basically he was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

385
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,819
force<font color="#CCCCCC"> a floor fight he wanted to</font>

386
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,410
embarrass people you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the Ted</font>

387
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,769
Cruz who has still not endorsed Trump

388
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,600
you know is is basically playing the

389
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,459
Reagan game he's hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he'll be</font>

390
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,410
the nominee I don't I don't personally

391
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,670
believe the Ted Cruz ever gonna be

392
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,199
present in the United States but I think

393
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,269
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come back he's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

394
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speech and hopefully it's going</font>

395
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,410
to be his Reagan's speech where he where

396
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,089
people watch him and think oh gosh we

397
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,769
could have had him you know that was you

398
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:26,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was so great it's Kentucky he</font>

399
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:27,319
says he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the future</font>

400
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,870
of the Republican Party does it see how

401
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,610
many times he mentions Donald Trump in

402
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,079
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course of that speech you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

403
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,350
count them on like one finger about

404
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,850
eight times e minute and then he hopes

405
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,860
that you know we'll all remember and

406
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,920
after four years of Hillary it will be

407
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,740
ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Donald to be lowered from the</font>

408
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,019
ceiling I mean from Ted Cruz to be

409
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,790
lowered from the ceiling I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

410
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,540

they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken the floor fight and</font>

416
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,639
turned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an attack ad because the</font>

417
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,559

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,900
Milania you know plagiarizing stuff now

463
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,290
make no mistake the left would media

464
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,710
would do what it will anyway but it's

465
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,660
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> worse when they're right so you</font>

466
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,340
know I was thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a couple</font>

467
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks ago last week and the week before</font>

468
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,900
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg came out and

469
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,160
she started attacking Trump but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

470
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,090
didn't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cuz I didn't</font>

471
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was much of a story really gives</font>

472
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,140
it was kind of filler material and

473
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ginsberg starts attacking Trump so</font>

474
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,500
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Supreme Court justice who's</font>

475
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to make decisions possibly in</font>

476
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,000
a trump presidency possibly if there is

477
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,040
a tie vote she might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do like</font>

Florida v<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gore you know she might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

479
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,150
to do a make decisions about who become

480
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,040
becomes the president and he or she is

481
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,600
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donald Trump is the worst</font>

482
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,160
he's terrible even the New York Times

483
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
attacked her but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that got me</font>

484
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,200
when the New York Times attacked her was

485
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,910
all she was doing was revealing the fact

486
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,390
that left wing justices vote left they

487
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,560
don't vote according to the constitution

488
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,320
they vote according to leftism you know

489
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,450
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing this is the left</font>

490
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,790
doesn't believe in meta reason it

491
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,560
doesn't believe in that higher reason

492
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:04,920
that

493
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,870
goes above the partisan fight so the New

494
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,880
York Times exemplifies what Ruth Bader

495
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,140
Ginsburg is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing they don't believe in</font>

496
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,880
reporting the news here's listen to how

497
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,640
they reported the convention yesterday

498
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,260
this is there news report this isn't the

Brian rice was acquitted on all charges

516
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,200
this is rubbing salt in the wound the

fact is these guys should<font color="#E5E5E5"> never have</font>

the news because<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Ruth Bader</font>

instance whether you think gays should

the Constitution of course it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in</font>

the Constitution there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

that way but they don't care as long as

they get what they want not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font>

of right or wrong it's a question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

meta the meta construct of the

Constitution that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to govern</font>

536
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,470
our lives the rule of law so you know

537
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,900
when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this convention it's</font>

538
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,130
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make fun of the convention</font>

539
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,570
because it was chaos and silliness and

540
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,010
there's always silliness and conventions

541
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,660
all conventions are kind of what their

542
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,520
horror it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> showbiz you know if</font>

you do it even if you do it well it

544
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,910
looks bad because<font color="#E5E5E5"> who cares you know</font>

545
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,580
died rather be watching something on HBO

546
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,850
you know but we what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to is</font>

547
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,340
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just simply two sides to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and they just perfectly put the whole</font>

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,850
says in this election mr. Trump is not

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,830
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> against himself though you might</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that Mexico will pay for a border wall</font>

562
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:23,850
his suspiciously recent embrace of the

563
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,890
pro-life cause mr. Trump gives reason

564
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,649
for pause but he still isn't mrs.

565
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,419
Clinton that's crucial because much of

566
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,070
the argument for keeping mr. Trump out

567

saying if you're never Trump you know

571
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,130
you're forgetting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that she's</font>

who sees nothing wrong with forcing nuns

to provide employees with contraceptive

583

steroids whatever the shortcomings of

589
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,240
mr. Trump and his people non-progressive

590
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,520
simply do not share the itch to use the

591
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,620
government to boss everyone else around

592
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,380
on top of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> an overreaching president</font>

593
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,390
Trump would not be excused by the press

594
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,220
and would face both Republican and

595
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,110
Democratic opposition so basically it

596
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,179
boils down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you gotta vote for Trump</font>

597
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,289
because he's not Hillary<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side</font>

598
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:41,610
of this comes from Bret<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stevens and</font>

599
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,890
Stevens opens up his column talking

600
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,049
about first he opens up talking about

601
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,880
Abraham<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lincoln and how Abraham Lincoln</font>

602
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,039
forgave his enemies called for malice

603
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,960
toward none and charity toward all and

604
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,510
then he compares that to Donald Trump in

605
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,250
fact we have a cut you know John<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kasich</font>

606
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,779
has refused<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conventions</font>

607
00:22:57,779 --> 00:22:59,370

Party second was very very far away I

613
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,899
beat him very very soundly and you have

614
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:23,610
to understand this was a contentious

615
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,840
some people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most contentious</font>

primary they've ever seen either party

if I were him and got beaten that badly

618
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
i probably wouldn't show up

619

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,360
and from the standpoint of Honor I think

621
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,669
it should show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up I also think this if</font>

622
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,830
this were the Democratic<font color="#CCCCCC"> convention I</font>

623
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,990
think he should show up because it's

624
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,750
good for Ohio I wanted it to be here and

625
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,929
they had lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of choices I want so</font>

626
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,299
malice toward all charity toward none

627
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,590
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

628
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,029
Lincoln partying Bret<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stevens goes on to</font>

629
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:56,130
talk about how the character of America

630
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,230
has changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we accept we accept</font>

631
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,029
Obama's lies about health care about a

632
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:01,830
ran deal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's still you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

633
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,659
still saying the guise of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> New</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> York</font>

634
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Times are so saying what a brilliant man</font>

635
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,769
what a scandal free administration what

636
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,779
a wonderful guy Hillary Clinton you know

637
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:11,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's still these talk about her every</font>

638
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,659
now and again they'll pause and reflect

639
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,460
on the fact that every word out of her

640
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">mouth is a lie but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

641
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,350
character of America has changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

642
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,940
it's obviously changed on the right to

643
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,980
that this guy Trump is elevated so this

644
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,539
is what Bret<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stevens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is saying and he</font>

645
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,700
says if Republicans are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to spend</font>

646
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few days talking about making</font>

647
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">America great again should be part of</font>

648
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,429
that discussion also be about making

649
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,320
Americans great again or<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the very</font>

650
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,510
least making us better from its

651
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,130
beginning the impulses that have

652
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,230
dominated mr. Trump's candidacy are the

653
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,809
insult<font color="#E5E5E5"> the put down the slander the</font>

654
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:45,450
threat the refusal to apologize these

655
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,309
have poured out of him in such profusion

656
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:49,200
and such velocity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

657
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,299
degraded Republicans simply by

658
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,639
accustoming us to them mr. Trump's

659
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:56,250
apologists<font color="#E5E5E5"> praised this as a refreshing</font>

660
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,620
burst of political incorrectness but

661
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,419
that just betrays an ignorance of what

662
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,980
it means to be politically incorrect

663
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,080
saying you aren't worried about global

664
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,299
warming is politically incorrect making

665
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,279
fun of physically disabled reporters is

666
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,919
called being a creep but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't all</font>

667
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,720
we've grown used to mr. Trump doesn't

668
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,850
merely lie as Hillary Clinton does his

669
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,830
statements are postmodern and that they

670
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,809
have no connection to a foundational

671
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,809
concept of truth that's beside the point

672
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:23,970
what's at<font color="#E5E5E5"> stake in Cleveland this week</font>

673
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,860
isn't the identity of the next president

674
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,529
it's the identity of the GOP its<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font>

675
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,769
its leaders its followers above all its

676
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:33,630
character so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two things</font>

677
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that sounds a little bit</font>

678
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,630
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> band I think talking you know</font>

679
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,940
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know if we plunk for</font>

680
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,159
this guy we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically poison our brand</font>

681
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,480
essentially

682
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,370
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a two points of view</font>

683
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,410
to me it seems to me you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold both</font>

684
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,820
those points of view in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind at the</font>

685
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,580
same time you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong</font>

686
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,290
there's going to be an election<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

687
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,790
these two people unless something

688
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,290
happens is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the president</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

689
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">the United States there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing wrong</font>

690
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:58,350
and saying in choosing which one of them

691
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,669
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least harm to your</font>

692
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:04,230
country in those four years while you

693
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,150
rebuild your brand I'm not afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

694
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,770
people pointing their finger<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

695
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,570
saying I voted for Donald Trump I'm not

696
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,400
afraid people pointing finger me and

697
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,559
saying any damn thing they want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

698
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,990
the point the point is will trump be

699
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,669
less damaging to the country than

700
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:19,620
Hillary yeah probably I mean you know a

701
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,200
poisoned adder as president which is

702
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,400
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're getting what</font>

703
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe it would be better for the country</font>

704
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,540
than Hillary Clinton but it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> true that</font>

705
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,429
the concern that the Republican Party

706
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">has lost its way and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

707
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,530
know this very very destructive for the

708
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,490
country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to</font>

709
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,020
rebuild the conservative<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brandon we're</font>

710
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,250
going to have to rebuild it in such way

711
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,620
that people will buy the brand I mean

712
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,360
whether it's in finding the candidate

713
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they like or in finding policies</font>

714
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,860
that somehow soften the blow of freedom

715
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,660
because freedom is tough and when you

716
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,220
sell freedom to people they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

717
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,960
it what they want is safety you know and

718
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,179
especially now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think people just want</font>

719
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be safe you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're gonna have to</font>

720
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,030
rebuild that brand and I think those are

721
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,160
two things that are that are both true

722
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,840
at the same time it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

723
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,280
question of like Oh am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote</font>

724
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,630
for Hillary or am I going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> vote for</font>

725
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,160
Trump you know I would never vote for

726
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,780
Hillary I mean I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would shoot</font>

727
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,820
myself in the foot first but that's but

728
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,679
that's not the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point is that</font>

729
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,110
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy this is a guy who has</font>

730
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,790
no connection to the truth is a guy has

731
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,500
never read the Constitution and if we

732
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,870
don't say that if we don't speak out you

733
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,820
know then then we truly have<font color="#E5E5E5"> soil or</font>

734
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,410
brand in the true way which is that our

735
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,390
brand has become poisoned and dishonest

736
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,790
all right this brings me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff I like</font>

737
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,669
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a thing on now I'm going to</font>

738
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:31,290
preface this by saying this stuff is

739
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,540
really disturbing not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> art is</font>

740
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,610
pleasant you know some people yell at<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

741
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">and say oh you know when I art as an</font>

742
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,730
escape it should be better than real

743
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,020
life I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe that</font>

744
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">art is a path to wisdom okay some art is</font>

745
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,559
really unknown it's not unpleasant it's

746
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,140
just disturbing there are is a series of

747
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,299
videos on YouTube now<font color="#E5E5E5"> called don't hug</font>

748
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,520
me i'm scared it was created<font color="#CCCCCC"> by two</font>

749
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,100
british artists Becky

750
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,080
Sloane and Joseph<font color="#E5E5E5"> pelling they</font>

751
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,160
originally put it out on their own

752
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,190
website and it's now become and enter a

753
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,380
youtube sensation I think the first one

754
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,570
has like 38 million hits or something

755
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this what they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is they're kind</font>

756
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,620
of takeoffs on Sesame Street these

757
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,799
little kids these little puppets yellow

758
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,429
guy red guy and duck I and in each one

759
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,510
somebody comes and introduces a

760
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,390
happy-go-lucky concept like creativity

761
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,100
so here's the one the first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

762
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,840
creativity so we'll play just the

763
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
opening of this what's your favorite I

764
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,010
did mine is being creative how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

765
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,650
get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to think</font>

766
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">creatively now when you look at this</font>

767
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,799
orange tell me please what do you see

768
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,280
it's just a boring or orange maybe to

769
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not to me I see a silly face</font>

770
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,179
walking along and smiling at me I don't

771
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,120
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you did you're not thinking</font>

772
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,200
creatively take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> my hand I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

773
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,450

to express myself now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

775
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,429
clouds in the sky don't you find it

776
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,789
exciting

777
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,960
thank you getting the hang of it now so

778
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it starts off with that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then it</font>

779
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,930
slowly devolved into utter horror and it

780
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,510
just goes from creativity to they start

781
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,640
thinking creatively and all the thoughts

782
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
start coming out of their head and of

783
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,970
course not all thoughts are clean and

784
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,310
wonderful<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well so they get their</font>

785
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,900
fight about the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> their writing like</font>

786
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,110
death it like and a little bad who's

787
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,700
singing the creative song let's all

788
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,640
agree to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop thinking creatively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

789
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,560
each one deals with a different subject

790
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,880
so like it though one there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one on</font>

791
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,650
health which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one on health I thought</font>

792
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,850
was actually going to give me nightmares

793
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,770
it was so spooky<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

794
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,330
technology and there's a and the and the

795
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,850
idea there's lots of theories on the

796
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet about what these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

797
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,270
has all these little mysterious things

798
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,340
like the date jun 19th keeps coming up

799
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this but I I think just in an</font>

800
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,530
overall way let alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're</font>

801
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,940
specifically about their about the ways

802
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">in which happy-go-lucky concepts simply</font>

803
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,950
do not contain the full existential

804
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,750
truth of life the full existential

805
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,630
horror of life and I think that when we

806
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,160
look at the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're whether</font>

807
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,630
we're looking at it politically or not

808
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,940
you know the little categories that we

809
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,320
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put things in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the little right</font>

810
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong black and white categories</font>

811
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,530
that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put things in simply</font>

812
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,750
don't work and the fact that life is

813
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,220
complex that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's messy that it's</font>

814
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,500
horrific that involves death and tragedy

815
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,380
are things that like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire society</font>

816
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,810

00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,610
cartoons that they may just brilliantly

818
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,680
