chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel who is in Istanbul Richard thanks for being here I'm hoping that you can walk us through to start with why it was that the Saudi government was so focused on khashoggi we have a sample of some of his Washington Post columns Saudi Arabia wasn't always this representative now it's unbearable he writes in one Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince wants to crush extremists but he's punishing the wrong people Saudi Arabia's crown prince is acting like Putin these are in in some ways very personal criticisms can you kind of give us some background about how the crown prince interacted with mr. Koh shoji well it's hard to know exactly what may have motivated the Saudi Crown Prince and why he according to Turkish authorities would have organized and ordered this assassination Saudi Arabia of course denies that it did any such thing but it seems like a massive overreaction and something that has totally backfired on Saudi Arabia experts we've spoken to are asking themselves and many people in this region are asking themselves tonight what was he thinking this seems to been a very emotional operation an operation that was launched with with not much thought about the potential consequences what kind of person orders an assassination inside a diplomatic building that will beat a trail right to the government that that owns that building many journalists have been killed by authoritarian governments around the world usually they try to cover their tracks a little bit using a poison or having a car bomb or at least something that gives a plausible deniability not doing it in side a diplomatic building with a hit squad arriving into the country and then leaving on unchartered plains so it's very hard to know what would have motivated that this howdee crown prince or somebody else to order this kind of operation that is backfired so badly on the Saudi government because yes khashoggi was a was a critic of Saudi Arabia but there are many critics of the of the crown prince absolutely and and that is an interesting point I think the question for us now here in the United States is what exactly does this mean for our relationship with Saudi Arabia we actually have some new comments from the President on this question he was just answering questions from reporters who are traveling with him let's take a look at that we'll talk about it are you evaluating the relationship with Saudi Arabia well we're going to find out what happened with respect to the terrible situation in Turkey having to do with Saudi Arabia and the reporter and nobody knows quite yet nobody's been able to put it all together people are starting to form ideas and as they're formed we'll let you know but it certainly is a terrible thing so a terrible thing he seems to cast this and a little bit more negative light than he did yesterday but at the same time no indications from President Trump that this is something that will fundamentally change the u.s. relationship with Saudi Arabia Steve minuchin still attending a conference there at that ritz-carlton hotel that was actually used as something of a luxury prison for some of the political enemies of MBs what's your take on how this should affect US relations with Saudi Arabia well I think what President Trump was saying right now is that he wants an explanation from Saudi Arabia so far Saudi authorities haven't been giving an explanation they've only been saying that shogi went into this consulate behind me and they say that as far as they know he left and was alive and well and they don't know what happened to him after that what we've seen over the last week or so is increasing pressure from the Turks where with leaking out information more information coming out today about these recordings and what may have been the source of these recordings pressure from the Washington Post pressure from the White House as well pressure from members of Congress to get the Saudis to at least give more of an explanation and today we saw the Saudi Arabia say will participate with Turkey in some sort of joint investigation so we will have to see what the Saudis say they may come up with a stress excuse they may try and blame another government they try and might try to blame a rogue agent I think what you just heard from the president is him saying let's hear what the Saudis have to say and maybe he will accept that whatever offer they have and use that as an excuse to resume negotiations but I think now the ball has been put firmly in the Saudis court to come up with a better answer yeah some of what you were just saying Richard suggests warming relations potentially between the United States and Turkey this also coincides with the release of pastor Brunson what role do you think that relationship the one between US and turkey is playing and how this plays out with Miss Turkish oh gee so there are a lot of dynamics that are at play right now as this crisis a little bit came out of no place that everybody knew that that Khashoggi was not a not in good graces with the Saudi government he himself knew it he knew that it wasn't safe for him to be living in Saudi Arabia the Turks knew it that's why he'd been living in exile in the United States and spending quite a bit of time here in Turkey as well but now you see you see turkeys relationship with Saudi Arabia has come to a head this crisis is now made in not an open war yet but certainly an open wound between the Turkish government and the Saudi government and that for Turkey could be a very expensive prospect Saudi Arabia is an enormous leap powerful oil-rich Kingdom and Turkey has been in the midst of an economic war with the United States over the incarceration of pastor Brunson so I think it's it makes sense and I think that's what we saw today as as turkey is looking at its future at least in the short term and it's seeing a fight with rich Saudi Arabia it wants to get out of the fight and did get out of the fight I think with with the United States by releasing the pastor mm-hmm Richard Engel thanks so much for your perspective as always really appreciate it hello youtubers if you're watching this it means
