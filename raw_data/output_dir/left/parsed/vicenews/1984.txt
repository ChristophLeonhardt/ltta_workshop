we went back to the abacis home for one
final visit as a reality of life without
a mirror started to sink in how are you
coping very difficult to cope we really
this last two months is we don't have a
word to explain it how hard it is we
really miss Amira so hope is like you
know i don't know like finished because
nobody contacted us you know no second
without remembering her I hope you sort
of got any more of a source of ideas now
why it might have happened we really we
cannot get a say we can't guess why this
happened children
so a piece of you you love with foreign
watch but uh you know
look work
you
