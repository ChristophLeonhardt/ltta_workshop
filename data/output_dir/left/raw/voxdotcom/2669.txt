1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,510
Nixon and Trump.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,580
Both presidents faced major FBI investigations,

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,509
were accused of obstructing justice.

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,250
called their investigations "witch hunts,"

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,139
and oozed raw sexual charisma.

6
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:12,710
It's not a perfect analogy,

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,070
but the similarities have led some to argue
that,

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,750
like Nixon, Trump's time is running out.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,360
What's going on here is very Nixonian.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,050
Having prosecuted the Watergate case,

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,470
we’re well on our way to impeachment.

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,030
I was in the Nixon administration, as you
know.

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,080
I think we're in impeachment territory now.

14
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,080
But the truth is

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,950
these two are living in totally different
worlds.

16
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,250
And that has less to do with

17
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,969
what's happening at the FBI

18
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,559
and more to do with what's happening

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,660
on Fox News.

20
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,350
The media and the Democrats have lied to you.

21
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,609
Trying to create a Watergate out of this.

22
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,610
Desperate to get back to the days of Watergate.

23
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,399
The elite media is part of the “deep state.”

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,720
You, the American people, should never trust

25
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,860
this “destroy Trump” corrupt media.

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,999
I know we're all trapped

27
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:56,539
in a flaming media hellscape right now.

28
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,149
But during Watergate, things were way different.

29
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,149
At the time,

30
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,899
there were three national nightly broadcast
news shows,

31
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,250
30 minutes each.

32
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,180
Big cities typically had one or two major
papers.

33
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,250
There were a couple of radio stations.

34
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,010
And that was about it.

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,430
No 24-hour cable news, no push notifications,

36
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,250
no Twitter, no blogs, no internet.

37
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,830
God, that sounds peaceful.

38
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,360
And that meant that, Democrat or Republican,

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,720
Americans were basically getting the same
news.

40
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,340
This is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.

41
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,470
People are basically reading and hearing

42
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,070
and watching the same things.

43
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,130
And they by and large believe the news that
they hear.

44
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,130
This is Nicole Hemmer,

45
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,850
political historian and author of

46
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,100
Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media

47
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,340
and the Transformation of American Politics.

48
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,430
We'll get to that "transformation" in a second.

49
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,640
Hemmer says there is conservative media in
1970;

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,320
it just looks really different.

51
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,390
There is conservative talk radio.

52
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,100
There are conservative publications

53
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,500
like National Review and Human Events,

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,030
but they're so much smaller than they are
today.

55
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,170
Like, when I talk about Human Events and National
Review,

56
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,600
that's just about it when it comes to

57
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,950
weekly conservative publications.

58
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,830
And while that might seem like a supply problem,

59
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,500
it's actually a demand problem.

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,640
In the 1970s, Americans had incredible trust

61
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,319
in the news they were getting.

62
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,160
69 percent—

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Nice.

64
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,319
Are you serious?

65
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,390
69 percent of Americans expressed

66
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,819
a great or fair amount of trust in the media.

67
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,249
And that trust meant there wasn't really an
appetite

68
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:27,569
for right-wing news.

69
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,689
Most Americans have faith in the objectivity

70
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,040
of mainstream media.

71
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
They trust it.

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,709
If Walter Cronkite says something,

73
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,260
it's not seen as liberal propaganda.

74
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,629
It's seen as, here's this guy who knows something,

75
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,610
who's telling us something objective and true

76
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,610
about the world.

77
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,610
And that's the way it is.

78
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,980
That's the way it is.

79
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,200
That's the way it is.

80
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,170
That became a big deal during Watergate.

81
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,549
As the investigation turned into a national
story,

82
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,370
Nixon lashed out, calling it a witch hunt

83
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,120
and attacking the media for covering it.

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,730
I have never heard or seen such outrageous
reporting

85
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,939
in 27 years of public life.

86
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:03,730
And conservative outlets came to Nixon's defense.

87
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,760
One conservative radio personality said the
press

88
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,189
had turned a prosecution into a persecution.

89
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,860
An article in National Review even suggested

90
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,310
that Watergate was a trap set up by the CIA.

91
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,599
They definitely didn't use the language of
the “deep state,”

92
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,069
but that was kind of lurking there.

93
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,709
But despite their efforts,

94
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,079
conservative media just couldn't change people's
minds

95
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,340
about what was going on.

96
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,069
They don't have the power to drive

97
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,019
or to shape the conversation about Watergate.

98
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,599
There's not really an alternative story

99
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,780
Republicans can credibly spin,

100
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,250
because they're not just going up against
Democrats;

101
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,989
they're going up against all the networks,

102
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:44,989
all the newspapers.

103
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,930
And so having that uniting narrative,

104
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,329
that really matters.

105
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,430
To be under a constant barrage

106
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,049
on each of the three major networks

107
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,349
tends to raise some questions in the people's
mind.

108
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,540
That's really too much for Republicans to
resist.

109
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,950
My phone calls were 100 to 1 in favor of pursuing

110
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,069
the path of impeachment, which was rather
shocking to me.

111
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,349
By 1974, Republicans in Congress begin

112
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,659
moving to impeach Nixon.

113
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,159
And by August, Nixon resigns.

114
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,790
Events have been rushing toward one seemingly

115
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,620
inevitable conclusion: removal from office.

116
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,228
There was kind of a cohesive message about

117
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,250
what Watergate was, what it meant.

118
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,300
It would have been nearly impossible for

119
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,210
the Nixon administration to muddy the waters.

120
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,600
That's not the case today.

121
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Right.

122
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,700
Today.

123
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,120
The flaming hellscape.

124
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,780
Or as Hemmer might call it: the transformation.

125
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,130
In the past 50 years,

126
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,610
trust in traditional media has plummeted,

127
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,530
with all Americans but especially with Republicans.

128
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,730
And the demand for conservative media has
exploded.

129
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,810
What started off as a few rinky-dink conservative
magazines

130
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,840
has become an entire ecosystem

131
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,250
of right-wing TV, talk radio, and websites.

132
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,389
You can now exist within a comprehensive,

133
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,819
closed conservative media ecosystem.

134
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,280
Whether it's having Fox News on all the day
or talk radio on all day,

135
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,409
you don't need to really ever step out of
that bubble,

136
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:05,960
which is something you couldn't have done
before.

137
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,020
Republicans aren't getting their news from
Cronkite anymore.

138
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,310
They're getting it from Fox.

139
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,210
And that's a huge deal when it comes

140
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,870
to the Mueller investigation.

141
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,870
Republicans during Watergate were

142
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,740
turning on their TV and seeing this:

143
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,410
The country tonight is in the midst of what
may be

144
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,009
the most serious constitutional crisis in
its history.

145
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,800
Now they're seeing this:

146
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,910
Biggest non-story ever being hyped by the
liberal media.

147
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,569
Greatest political hoax.

148
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:30,770
Farce and a witch hunt.

149
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,770
It's a sham.

150
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,070
It is a house of cards.

151
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,400
The American people will put up with a great
deal,

152
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,139
but they will not put up with anyone

153
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,259
who claims to be above the law.

154
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,629
The president says it's fake news.

155
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:41,629
Do you even care?

156
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,540
How can anyone trust the Mueller office?

157
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,800
Bunch of Trump-hating, Hillary-loving partisan
hacks.

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,990
A grave and profound crisis

159
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,300
in which the president has set himself against

160
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,060
his own attorney general and the Department
of Justice.

161
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,629
It's one giant, huge web of corruption.

162
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:00,770
The FBI has become America's secret police.

163
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,080
The FBI needs a complete cleansing.

164
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,599
Mueller is, frankly, a disgrace to the American
justice system.

165
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,930
These people need to be taken out in cuffs.

166
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,370
That uniting narrative we had during Watergate
—

167
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,560
it's gone.

168
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,270
And without it, Republicans in Congress

169
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,120
have a strong incentive to turn their backs

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,349
on the Mueller investigation.

171
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:23,080
They know that the Republican base is tuned
in

172
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,259
to conservative media and hearing these messages

173
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,069
that the Mueller investigation is a sham,

174
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:29,970
that this is a project of the “deep state”
to bring down the president.

175
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,400
Mueller is out to get the president, it appears,
at any cost.

176
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,229
And so if a Republican politician breaks with
that,

177
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,690
then all of a sudden, it looks like he's siding
with the enemy.

178
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,900
And siding with the enemy could be a political
death sentence.

179
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,889
A 2017 study found that watching Fox News

180
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,069
had a significant effect on elections,

181
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,889
shifting 6 percent of voters

182
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:51,930
toward the Republican presidential candidate
in 2008.

183
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,750
In that environment, politicians have to choose
sides.

184
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,750
And if you're a Republican,

185
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,370
do you choose to side with the media that

186
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,480
all your base listens to,

187
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,870
or do you choose to side with the ones they
all oppose?

188
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,830
House Republicans have already released a
report

189
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,199
attempting to undermine the Mueller investigation.

190
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,770
There's no reason to continue this.

191
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,900
We've turned up nothing.

192
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,790
And some have begun echoing Fox News's talking
points.

193
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,970
Mueller is desperate.

194
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,220
He doesn’t have a case he can make.

195
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,090
This Mueller investigation is built on a false
premise

196
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,530
and rotten to the core, Tucker.

197
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,460
Is the integrity of the agency in question
then, now?

198
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
Of course it is.

199
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,750
We know there's bias; we know there's a conflict.

200
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,879
I agree with you, Sean.

201
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,699
They're trying to manufacture a process crime.

202
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,500
This is increasingly becoming scary stuff.

203
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,639
Do you agree?

204
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,360
Yes, I do agree with that.

205
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,770
Of course, we don't know if Trump will fire
Mueller

206
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,250
or if Mueller will actually dig up any dirt
on Trump.

207
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,240
But if either of those things do happen,

208
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,310
it'll be up to Republicans in Congress to
do something about it.

209
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,530
And right now, Hemmer isn't confident they
will.

210
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,010
It's very hard to imagine a future in which
all of a sudden

211
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,810
they're going to say, "Oh, wait, we now need
to listen

212
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,090
to this independent counsel who

213
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,139
most of the conservative media have been

214
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,860
undermining and delegitimizing for months
now."

215
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,400
And before you call me dramatic,

216
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,430
listen to how actual Fox News hosts

217
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,810
are talking about this stuff.

218
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,560
Nixon never would have been forced to resign

219
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,629
if you existed back in 1972, ’73, ’74.

220
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,449
I was literally 11 years old.

221
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,479
It's too bad for Nixon because nobody like
you existed then.

222
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,310
Our prime responsibility now

223
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,169
is to unshackle the 45th president of the
United States.

224
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,090
These investigations might be really similar,

225
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,460
but on TV, they could not look more different.

226
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,039
And for Republicans in Congress,

227
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,279
that might be all that matters.

228
00:08:32,280 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the way it is.
