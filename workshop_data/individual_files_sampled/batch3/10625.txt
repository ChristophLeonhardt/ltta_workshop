welcome to guests and in an hour there will be efficient now later there will be these official meeting now as for the airport so the father will say the same as the sports minister ah I'd like to say dear fans you must wait us at Angie arena please don't create any faster the airport's so we'll be three cars and three cars will move straight to Algeria now please respect us as we will respect you see you now one question how did you like it what was the scenario was it so was it okay well four plus what was inside the cage and no comments on what was after that well you're gonna punish Habib yet discipline should be in top priority so we'll be first to praise him and punish or punish him why I need to you know punch him either from the left or from the right well they're jokes aside well what happened happened anything can happen in sports unfortunately that's what we saw by all that time habib was reaching out for that target so he's never had anything that undermined his reputation his credibility he's showed himself as a perfect person with a great upbringing but not everyone can you know have that keep that pressure of when your mother a father when your homeland is attacked well 99% of daghestani people cannot swallow that it would have been much better they did not happen so I made a statement well that's a fact you know how he was a champion of the world even if they take away the belt so there's no one to match how babe in the world so what sanctions could be applied to Habib financial sanctions will be there but hobby but we will retain the title so he got the title but there will be a financial penalty between five to thirty percent while the Athletic Commission will decide on the size of the penalty now getting back to the to the battle you as a coach what's your view of that what's your assessment well a be followed the tactic that we told him to do to follow right in the first round we were able to control it we impose the pace that made him tired and fatigued in the second round so as I said we will run the risk in one of the rounds so in the third round some exchange just to show whether we have his jabbing technique or not and in the fourth round there was a takedown well I think that this pose well he decided to have an exchange but as I said he needed to you know use the clinching position to push him towards the cage fence here he did only in the last minute so there was an exchange there was an exchange of jabs but at the end he took that round he pushed him against the fence and he controlled it but if he didn't do that movements in the final minute then it would be an equal a tied around so he won the first two rounds so he he did what he had to do in the fourth round we saw that he was tired and then he decided to do that's painful movements and that lock and McGregor wasn't able to break have that lock well we haven't seen any official suspension of two who gov and others so they were in the corner they they didn't what they did in the bras I mean no one attacks one person there were with two people so I don't understand why everyone's been complaining about the I side jump from stage he threatened to jaws Iaido and it was welcomed there that was now we have the same and we are getting punished I mean there should be no double standard involved
