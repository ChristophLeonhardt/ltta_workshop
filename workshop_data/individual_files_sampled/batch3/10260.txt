efforts are trying to deescalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula if hit another snag plans now for an historic railway that was meant to link North and South Korea have been blocked by the us-led United Nations command the UN units has controlled movement across the Demilitarized Zone separating the north and south since the end of the Korean War in fact a joint field study for the project was planned last week but was cancelled by the u.s. military then the inter-korean rail project was supposed to improve trade and tourism between the two Koreas it was also intended to set the stage for future investments in the north if sanctions on Pyongyang were lifted human rights attorney Eric Surratt contolled us he thinks the US should stop meddling in the Korean peace process these are all breakthrough steps yeah the United States would frankly get out of the way which is unfortunate I you can see the incredible efforts and the incredible craving for peace and reunification that we saw in the eyes of the family exchanges recently we've seen the hopes for peace on so many levels with president moon and chairman kim jeong-hoon so consequently those are being thwarted now as a quite a reminder that the u.s. still holds quite a military grip in the region they are their people within the administration who frankly benefit from instability gives a certain kind of edge it allows a certain level of military spending allows us to have our basis paid for by South Korea in South Korea it allows us to export billions of dollars of weapons there so consequently there are always people who are gonna fight against peace but in this period at this essential time when we're about to have another summit between North and South and September it seems to me that this is a reminder to both North and South that the US has never or given up its wartime Authority in South Korea parallel to this the latest move comes after US defense secretary James Madison answered Washington has no plans to suspend future joint military exercises with South Korea drills which the north has strongly protested over the years as you know we took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit we have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises last week President Trump cancelled his chief diplomats visit to North Korea blaming insufficient progress over denuclearization looking back trump's had something of a love-hate relationship than with leader kim jong-un we have developed a very special bond best not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury you will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea have madmen out there shooting rockets all over the place he is a sick puppy a frightened dog barks louder I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged u.s. dotted with fire we're both for both very honored to sign the document thank you today we had an historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind we're very proud of what took place today it worked out for both of us far better than anybody even predicted it's an honor to be with you DC in the last year too has been a Bastiaan of mixed messages unfortunately you can't on one hand say I going to trust you I'm going to respect your sovereignty as a nation and then when two countries start to take steps in that direction stop and look try to block it you
