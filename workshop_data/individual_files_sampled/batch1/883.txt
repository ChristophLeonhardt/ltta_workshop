this is the cost of consumer culture we don't like to think about the waste we make but we're all responsible for it this plant in the West of England processes hundreds of tons every day the paper the glass above all the plastic we throw away and as the British prime minister says it's the planet that pays in years to come I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly this plastic is ingested by dozens of species of marine animals and over 100 species of seabirds causing immense suffering to individual creatures and degrading vital habitats the prime minister says she wants to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste by 2040 - but that's a long way off and anyway what does that even mean environmental groups say we need laws sooner to tackle our mountains of waste at this Center they say give the Prime Minister a chance we want action now we've got marine litter we got we've got the planet to protect but I think transition does take time we've heard from the government in recent weeks and months that they're looking at deposit return they want to incentivize recycling they want to drive better quality all of those things fit with us a reducing plastics impact on the planet changing our throwaway culture won't be easy the scale of the problem can seem daunting but factories like these aren't part of the problems they're part of the solution until very recently almost all this material all this and metal was simply dumped in a land so now with new technology it can be used again and again and again but how far and how fast are we the consumers prepared to go in Britain as in so many other countries the public use millions of disposable throwaway coffee cups some companies now offer cheaper coffee if you bring your own reusable cup so London's commuters need to change their habits back at the recycling center another concern until recently Britain sent huge amounts of recycled material to China now China says it has too much and won't take more so the onus is on British industry to start reusing more of the waste it creates talking green may be good politics for the Prime Minister changing the ways economy and society work not so easy Barnaby Phillips al Jazeera Bristol
