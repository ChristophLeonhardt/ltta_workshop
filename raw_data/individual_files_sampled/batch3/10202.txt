the I'd spoken president of the Philippines as dismissed and offered to buy us made f-16 fighter jets saying buying them would be quote utterly useless we do not need any m16 it would be utterly useless to buy it but I need attack helicopters and small planes but it 130 so Rodrigo Duterte made the offer signed by Washington's top brass public during a military ceremony the president then highlighted that the letter from the US defense and state secretaries came after officials in Washington had made humiliating comments about his country's crackdown on drugs let's get into some of this I'm happy to say about security analyst Charles Shoebridge joins us live on the program hi there Charles is there more do you think to president duterte saying the f16 just isn't what he needs right now was his rejection deliberate for other reasons aside from the anti drug operations and it not being suitable for such operations I mean yes he has a point with that from the operational military perspective f-16s are not much use in the immediate threats that he perceives the Philippines faces and he perceives those with good reason but there is I think more to this many countries around the world are questioning first of all their relationship with the United States including countries that hitherto were considered allies that couldn't be separated the Philippines one of those Turkey mention as well because we've got a situation of course where up until recently you would buy your weapons from the US largely based on the fact that you were given many weapons beforehand and therefore that you were effectively suckered in in a certain way to then keeping that supply chain going benefiting of course arm cells from the US but also we've got here the fact that the US especially but other countries as well they've long seen arms sales as if you like an arm of diplomacy and indeed of course diplomacy as an arm of arm sales largely intended to boost arm sales and as many examples of that of course for the United States so what we've got here is a situation where I think through the vehicle of armed supplies and arms procurement the president here the Philippines is lashing out at the u.s. given that there have been shall we say he's basically rejected a conciliatory letter that you've already described that came from very high-level within the u.s. that itself was an attempt to smooth the waters given the rather provocative letter that preceded that that's a question in itself isn't it because why do you think the US was almost assuming that Manila would just accept what the US was offer near the f-16s also considering de tertius domestic war on drugs faced a lot of criticism from the US didn't it yes that's right but let's not forget that human rights is often cited by the US as a reason why it's not going to cooperate with certain countries or why it's going to not deliver arms but of course we know from very prominent examples Israel is one Saudi Arabia another where the United States is absolutely prepared to supply in the state case of Israel of course not sell but actually give weapons very advanced weapons knowing absolutely that I will be used almost certainly to kill civilians for example in Gaza or in Yemen and so really that I think has to be taken with a pinch of salt what we're talking about here is trying to use armed cells as a means of leverage to control the foreign policies of other countries and that's exactly what the philippine president regardless of whether one likes him or not always policies that he has correctly identified that america uses this to pressure its allies into staying as allies after all the letter that the philippines president objected to basically said don't forget that arm sales is about more than capability it's also about a relationship you buy american weapons your relationship just on that where does it go now charles because does deter attea statement mean that the philippines is considering developing better relationships with other arms suppliers and I point out Russia here because it's been noted that the Philippine defense secretary is planning to meet his Russian counterpart this week that's just one example though yes it makes sense I think in Turkey itself you mentioned earlier and your package is also playing this diplomatic game very skillfully in other words rather than giving this signal to the United States that we're with you regardless actually playing to feel to some degree and actually saying we're going to diversify not only our weapon systems but also our diplomacy we want to be allies with more than one country and of course that is also a way of extracting concessions from the opposing side after all you've got a situation where there is already a small defense relationship between Russia and the Philippines for example Russia has already supplied small arms to the Philippines and of course you've got this situation now where in other markets Turkey India and so on we're very advanced weapons systems are attractive to countries and they are going to resent very much I think being told by the United States suppose at allies of them that they should or should not buy weapon systems after all buying a weapons system as a celexa foreign policy is a question of the sovereign rights of countries and a lot of American officials seem to forget that always food for thought when you're on the program security analyst Charles Shoebridge thank you you
