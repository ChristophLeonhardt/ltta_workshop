STEVE: DON'T MESS WITH ANTHONY
SCARAMUCCI.
HE WAS THE PRESIDENT'S
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR 11
DAYS.
>> YEAH.
BRIAN: ON HIS RESUME'.
NO FAKE NEWS AT FOX NEWS.
THAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER.
>> HE HAS WRITTEN FANTASTIC,
VERY FUNNY MEMOIR, RECOUNT OF
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
TRUMP THE BLUE-COLLAR PRESIDENT.
MR. SCARAMUCCI JOINS US LIVE.
AINSLEY: LAST TIME I SAW YOU
WERE IN YOUR KITCHEN COOKING
WITH YOUR WIFE AS FAR AS HIS
BOOK SEGMENT OF THE WE HAD A
VIDEO.
YOUR HOUSE SO SO BEAUTIFUL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
>> THE ONLY ONE IN THE FAMILY
KNOWS HOW TO COOK IS MY WIFE.
STEVE DOOCY OUTED ME TO AMERICA
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SKIN A
CARROT.
BRIAN: YOU MADE FAKE NEWS THAT
CAST CONTROVERSIAL.
YOU WEATHERED THAT STORY.
>> I WEATHERED.
YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE MAYHEM IN
THE ALLSTATE COMMERCIAL GOING
INTO POLITICS.
THE CAR CRASH, YOU CAN COMPLAIN
AND GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND GET
UP, DUST YOURSELF UP.
I DUSTED MYSELF OFF.
BRIAN: YOU MADE MY LIFE EASIER,
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK DON'T KNOW
PRESIDENT TRUMP, I SAID, WHY IS
A BILLIONAIRE RELATING TO
BLUE-COLLAR PEOPLE MORE THAN
BILLIONAIRES?
ANOTHER BILLIONAIRES DON'T
REALLY LIKE HIM THAT MUCH.
HE IS DIFFERENT THAN THEM.
YOU BREAK IT DOWN IN THE BOOK.
GO BACK TO YOUR FAMILY AND HIS
FAMILY.
CAN YOU DO IT NOW?
>> I TALK ABOUT FRED TRUMP.
HOW HIS RISE, THAT
COCONTEMPORANEOUS TO MY DAD'S
STORY.
THEY'RE BOTH AMERICAN STORIES
AND BOTH AMERICAN ARCS, SEEKING
AMERICAN DREAM.
I TALK ABOUT THE CARWANA FAMILY,
A GOOD FRIEND OF OURS, FRED
TRUMP, AND VERY YOUNG
DONALD J. TRUMP ARE MEETING WITH
PEOPLE TO COLLECT RENT.
THE FAMILY, THE HUSBAND LOST HIS
JOB.
THE FRED TRUMP LOOKS IN FRONT OF
DONALD J. TRUMP, FINE, WE'LL
REVISIT THIS IN A MONTH OR SO
I'M CONFIDENT YOU WILL GET
ANOTHER JOB.
YOU ARE A STRAIGHT-UP JOB.
THESE ARE STORIES ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT PEOPLE WOULDN'T TELL,
IN TERMS OF HIS COMPASSION, WHO
HE IS AS A GUY, IN THE END OF
THE DAY HE FEELS FOR THE PEOPLE.
THIS IS A GUY THAT CAN WALK A
CONSTRUCTION SITE, RECOGNIZE
SOMEONE WITH A LUNCH PAIL,
COMING INTO THE SITE, WORKING
EIGHT, POSSIBLY 10 HOUR DAY,
GETTING HOURLY WAGE, BEING
MEMBER OF UNION AND HELPING --
AINSLEY: HE IS RELATABLE.
>> HE IS RELATABLE.
AINSLEY: STARTED WITH A MILLION
DOLLARS, BECAME A BILLIONAIRE?
>> WHATEVER HE STARTED WITH IS
THE NOT REALLY THE THING.
IT WAS A BILL ANY IN A TOWER
ADJACENT TO THE TIFFANY STORE
THAT SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY
NEIGHBORHOOD, AINSLEY.
I WRITE ABOUT THAT I'M VERY
HONEST ABOUT IT.
I WENT TO THE FANCY PANTS
SCHOOLS IN BOSTON.
WENT TO GOLDMAN SACHS.
BUILT TWO HEDGE FUNDS.
I STARTED TO GET INTO THESE
CONCENTRIC CIRCLES OF BIAS,
CONFIRMED BIASES, TALKING TO
WEALTHY PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR
WEALTHY LIFE EXPERIENCE.
IT WASN'T -- UNTIL I GOT ON THE
CAMPAIGN WITH THE PRESIDENT.
WENT TO PLACES LIKE ALBUQUERQUE,
NEW MEXICO, SAW ASPIRATIONAL
FAMILY I GREW UP IN WAS BECOMING
A DESPERATIONAL WORKING CLASS
FAMILY.
BRIAN: MIDDLE CLASS WAS
DISAPPEARING.
MANUFACTURING LEAVING THE
COUNTRY.
>> NOT WHITEETH KNOW
NATIONALISM, JUST ECONOMIC
DESPERATION.
WHY ARE YOU HERE IN THE RALLY?
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BRINGING BACK
JOBS TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
WHAT THE NEW MEXICO IS LITERALLY
NEW MEXICO.
THAT I TRY TO RELATE THAT IN THE
BOOK.
AT END OF THE DAY THE PRESIDENT
HAS A TOUCH FOR THIS STUFF, VERY
UNIQUE AND INSTINCT ALL.
STEVE: THE BOOK IS TERRIFIC.
YOU'RE A VERY GOOD WRITER.
AFTER YOU WERE ESCORTED OUT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE, SEEN WITH YOUR
WONDERFUL MOTHER MARIE, SHE IS
AT STOOP OF YOUR BOYHOOD HOME,
GOING, ESSENTIALLY, TO
REPORTERS, GET OFF MY LAWN
CLAIM.
>> I SAID MOM, PLEASE, GOT ME
TROUBLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
NOBODY ELSE CURSES IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.
MAYBE SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
AINSLEY: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THE BLUE WAVE?
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS, TOM PEREZ,
CHAIRMAN OF THE DNC, BERNIE
SANDERS WE'RE NOT CALLING IT A
BLUE WAVE, BECAUSE WE DON'T
THINK THAT SMART.
IT IS WAY CLOSE.
SOME STATES ARE PURPLE.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS GENIUS,
MOVING AROUND THE COUNTRY,
MAKING THE BET HE CAN GET THE
VOTER PARTICIPATION UP.
WHAT CLASSICALLY HAPPENED,
AINSLEY THE PRESIDENT IS
HUNKERED IN BY THE ROSE GARDEN,
OVAL OFFICE, PEOPLE ARE
GENERALLY HAPPY BECAUSE HE IS IN
POWER.
PEOPLE IN HIS PARTY AND OTHER
PEOPLE COME OUT AND VOTE.
ANGRY VOTERS VOTE MORE THAN
COMPLACENT VOTERS.
THE PRESIDENT IS OUT THERE
TRYING TO RALLY HIS BASE,
REMINDING THEM HOW IMPORTANT IT
IS TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE SO
THEY CAN PROTECT THE LESS OF
DEREGULATION, PROTECT THE
LEGISLATION AND OBVIOUSLY LOOK
FOR FORWARD PROGRESS AFTER THE
MIDTERMS.
STEVE: SURE.
BRIAN: YOU TALK ABOUT THE CLASH
YOU HAD IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU TALK ABOUT A CLASH WITH
CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL KELLY.
STORY YESTERDAY, GENERAL KELLY
GRABBING COREY LEWANDOSKI BY THE
COLLAR, THINGS GOT HEATED
BETWEEN THEM.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT STORY TOOK
PLACE?
>> OF COURSE THE STORY TOOK
PLACE.
HERE IS THE THING.
YOU KNOW, GENERAL KELLY FIRED
YOU SO YOU HAVE A PERSONAL
ANIMOSITY.
STEVE: AXE TO GRIND.
>> I DON'T HAVE PERSONAL
ANIMOSITY FOR GENERAL KELLY.
I'VE BEEN FIRED BEFORE.
I WRITE ABOUT THAT IN THE BOOK.
GENERAL KELLY IS THE SECOND
PERSON THAT FIRED ME.
HE WON'T BE THE LAST PERSON
BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE BIT AFTER
RENEGADE.
HAVING SAID THAT I THINK HE IS
ILL-SUITED FOR THE JOB.
I'M BEING HONEST.
I RUN SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES.
I KNOW HOW TO EVALUATE TALENT.
I MAY NOT BE THE BEST
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.
I KNOW HOW TO EVALUATE TALENT.
YOU NEED A LESS MILITANT STYLE
IN A ORGANIZATION.
YOU CAN'T BE GRABBING PEOPLE BY
THE COLOR.
CURSING OFF THE NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR.
BRIAN: YOU THINK IT HAPPENED?
>> I'M CONFIDENT IT HAPPENED.
I KNOW THE PLAYERS INVOLVED.
I AM VERY CONFIDENT.
LET'S NOT LIE ABOUT IT.
AINSLEY: SEAN SPICER WROTE ABOUT
YOU.
STARTED AT BOOK BEGINNING TO
TALK ABOUT YOU, AT THE END HE
RESIGNED IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE YOU
WERE HIRED.
HE LIKED YOU AS A PERSON, DIDN'T
THINK YOU WERE RIGHT FOR THE
JOB.
>> SEAN IS ENTITLED TO A PERSON.
I THOUGHT HE WAS A LIAR, LIAR
SPICE FROM THE SPICE GIRLS.
EVERY SPICE GIRL HAS A NICKNAME.
I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY HE HANDLED
ABOUT ME.
TOLD LIES ABOUT ME TO THE PRESS.
I WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO BE
THE LPL DIRECTOR.
THEY WITHHELD THE PRESS RELEASE
EVEN THOUGH I HAD OFFER AND
ACCEPTANCE.
HIM AND RICE TRIED TO PREVENT ME
FROM GETTING JOB.
THAT IS THE WASHINGTON
SHENANIGANS AMERICAN PEOPLE
ABSOLUTELY HATE.
I DON'T DISLIKE SEAN PERSONALLY.
HE IS ENTITLED TO HIS VALUATION
OF ME.
HE IS RIGHT IN THE FOLLOWING
RESPECT I DIDN'T HAVE COMES,
WASHINGTON OPERATIVE LYING
EXPERIENCE.
OKAY?
STEVE: THAT WAS YOUR PROBLEM.
>> THAT WAS MY PROBLEM.
STEVE: THE BOOK IS CALLED,
"TRUMP, THE BLUE-COLLAR
PRESIDENT."
NOT OPENLY A BOOK.
HE PUT OUT ONLINE INTERPRETIVE
DANCE.
>> LITTLE BIT OF A INTERPRETIVE
