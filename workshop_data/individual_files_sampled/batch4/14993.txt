what does it say that more people are interested in seeing what a pornstar says about the president then a former FBI director is that a sad commentary on our society that we care a lot about storming Daniels story or that a former top intelligence officer who's been nothing short of corrupt partisan and malfeasant has lost the interest and trust of the American people let me pose a question to you if you walked in on your husband watching porn and then looked beside him and saw the James Comey book which one would you be more upset about not to get too preachy on the whole porn stuff but they're both kind of gross and they're both going to require some cleanup afterward because commis book definitely makes me nauseous to the extent that I might puke but let's talk about the interviewer and some of the ratings don't you find it ultra-rich that George Stephanopoulos is the one who landed this interview quite possibly the Clintons strongest ally in the media now he has a long history with the Clintons he was communications director for the Bill Clinton campaign and then became senior advisor for policy and strategy he was the de facto press secretary for Bill Clinton and Stephanopoulos who is part of the we hate Trump camp who is as big a hypocrite as any in the media you remember when he said after the Monica Lewinsky scandal that even though bill clinton had debased himself that we shouldn't debase the office with an impulsive reaction ie Bill Clinton resigning or being impeached yeah how about that now Steffi it also should be noted that Stephanopoulos dodin donated 75 thousand dollars to the Clinton Foundation and even a former colleague of his on CNN's reliable sources back in 2015 said there's a coziness George cannot escape while he did try to separate himself from his political background to become a journalist he really isn't a journalist and I'm sorry that again the public trust in the media is being challenged and frayed because of the actions of some of the people in the business well safe to say Stephanopoulos is no longer by himself on that Island pretty much everyone in the media has become that losing the public's trust because of their partisanship and they're all consumed hatred of this president but that speaks volumes about the fact that George Stephanopoulos was granted the interview with Comey maybe that explains why so many people didn't watch did anyone expect him to actually press Comey on anything related to I don't know the clinton investigation of course not did they expect him to blabber on and on about how he finds the president to be mentally unfit for the presidency yes absolutely and maybe that's why less people watch the interview than the Country Music Awards or a roseanne or the stormy Daniels interview and a whole host of other shows the stormy Daniels interview pulled in 22 million 12.1 million people watched the CMAs and only 9.8 million people watched the James Comey interview it's also ten million people less than the amount who watched commis testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee last summer so apparently people are more interested in seeing James Comey pressed by Congress than a hack fo journalist makes perfect sense so are people just losing interest in general as in losing interest in the current news cycle practically every major Network has seen a decline in viewership and now that people are paying less taxes and seeing higher paychecks and more people are back to work our people just I don't know downright fed up with the constant negativity in the news I know I am I have to balance my diet of staying informed politically with watching shows that have nothing to do with politics I never used to watch cooking shows or hallmark movies but dang they do a really good job of taking my mind off of the current climate and I doubt that I'm the only one feeling that way so what say you are you tired of the same stories rehashed over and over again by the big media networks let us know in the comments thank you so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com favorite rebel shows thanks for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
