>>BERNIE SANDERS SAID ON SUNDAY
THAT HE WANTS TO SEE A
REVOLUTION IN THIS COUNTRY IN
THE WAY THAT WE TREAT WOMEN.
TAKE A LOOK.
>>AL FRANKEN INDICATED THAT HE
WAS GOING TO RESIGN, AND I THINK
WHAT FRANKEN DID TOUCHES ON AN
ISSUE OF IN NORMA'S CONSEQUENCE
FOR THIS COUNTRY.
AND WHAT I
WORRY ABOUT, JAY, IS NOT JUST
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH REGARD
TO FAMOUS PEOPLE, WE SEE THAT IN
THE PAPERS EVERY DAY WHETHER
IT'S THE MEDIA, THE CORPORATE
WORLD, OR IN POLITICS -- RIGHT
NOW AS WE SPEAK IN RESTAURANTS
ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, IN
OFFICES ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY,
THERE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT
FAMOUS WHO ARE HARASSING WOMEN,
MAKING DEMANDS ON WOMEN, THAT
ARE OBSCENE, AND WE NEED A
REVOLUTION IN THE WAY WE TREAT
WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE FROM THE
BOTTOM ON UP.
>>THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT
POINT BERNIE SANDERS MADE AND I
WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CRUCIAL
THAT WE RECOGNIZE THIS.
THE ME
TOO MOVEMENT HAS BEEN SO
EMPOWERING AND SO AFFECTED IN SO
MANY WAYS.
THAT SAID, IT'S A
MOVEMENT FOR THE PRIVILEGED.
MOST OF THE PEOPLE COMING OUT
OUR FAMOUS WOMEN, THEY ARE RICH
WHITE WOMEN, FRANKLY, AND IT'S
LEAVING OUT AN ENTIRE
DEMOGRAPHIC OF WOMEN WHO CANNOT
COME FORWARD AND SAY ME TOO.
NOW, THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO
ARE SEXY HARASSED OR SEXUALLY
ABUSED ARE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE
SERVICE INDUSTRY, AND THOSE ARE
WOMEN WHO MAY BE OUR IN HOTEL
ROOMS ALONE WITH GUESTS WHO THEY
CANNOT COME OUT AGAINST, OR IF
IT IS -- IF THEY ARE IN A
RESTAURANT AND IT'S SOMEONE THEY
ARE WAITING A TABLE ON,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OR IF THEY
ARE A HOUSEKEEPER AND THERE IS
NO UNION TO PROTECT THEM, THEIR
BOSS IS THE PERSON WHO IS
SEXUALLY HARASSING OR ABUSING
THEM, THERE IS NO H.R.
DEPARTMENT OR ANYTHING LIKE
THAT.
THESE WOMEN ARE BEING LEFT
OUT OF THIS MOVEMENT, WE ARE
FORGETTING THE WOMEN IN THIS
MOVEMENT AS WE TRY TO COMBAT
THIS HORRENDOUS AND UBIQUITOUS
PROBLEM.
I WANT TO SHARE YOU A
CHART THAT TALKS ABOUT THE TOTAL
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES FILED
BY INDUSTRY BETWEEN 2005 AND
2015.
KEEP IN MIND WHILE LOOKING
AT THIS THAT THESE NUMBERS
AREN'T TOTALLY REPRESENTATIVE
BECAUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ONE
OF THE MOST UNDERREPORTED CRIMES
THAT WE HAVE, SO THESE NUMBERS
MIGHT BE MUCH BIGGER, MUCH
GREATER, ESPECIALLY IN THE
SERVICE INDUSTRY WHERE WOMEN MAY
NOT FEEL THAT THEY CAN COME OUT
AND REPORT THESE THINGS.
LET'S
LOOK AT THIS, THE TOP REPORTING
ARE ACCOMMODATION AND FOOD
SERVICES, THE RETAIL TRADE,
HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL
ASSISTANCE, ADMINISTRATIVE
SUPPORT, WASTE MANAGEMENT,
REMEDIATION, ALL THESE SORTS OF
SERVICE INDUSTRIES.
THEN YOU
LOOK DOWN AT 1.61%, THAT IS
ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND
RECREATION.
IT FEELS LIKE EVERY
SINGLE DAY WE SEE ANOTHER
ACTRESS OR MUSICIAN COMING
FORWARD TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL
HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL ABUSE, THAT
ONLY ACCOUNTS FOR 1.61% OF THESE
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES, AND
WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE
MAJORITY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
THAT HAPPENING IT'S WITHIN THESE
SERVICE INDUSTRIES AND WE ARE
COMPLETELY LEAVING BEHIND THESE
LOW INCOME WOMEN, OFTENTIMES
WOMEN OF COLOR, AND WE NEED TO
CHANGE THAT AND START FROM THE
BOTTOM UP JUST LIKE BERNIE
SANDERS IS TALKING ABOUT.
>>DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE OTHER
DAY, WHEN I WAS HERE LAST WEEK,
THAT WHEN I WENT TO BREAKFAST
WITH YOU I LEFT RELIEVED THAT
YOU WEREN'T A PERVERT?
ISN'T
THAT THE SENSIBILITY OF ALL
WOMEN, THAT WHEN WE HAVE TO
ENCOUNTER A MAN IN A POSITION OF
POWER, ESPECIALLY SOMEONE WHO IS
FAR MORE EMPOWERED THAN WE ARE,
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING IN
A SITUATION THAT IS
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE IT IS SO
EMBEDDED IN OUR CULTURE.
AND
THEY ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE
GIRLS AT APPLEBEE'S.
AND WHEN I
WORK AT THE COMEDY CLUB, BECAUSE
I'M THE HEADLINER THAT WEEKEND,
I ENCOUNTER SOMEONE BEING
INAPPROPRIATE WITH ME, SO I
ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE SERVERS
THAT ARE THERE.
BECAUSE IF I SAY
SOMETHING, SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN,
BUT THOSE GIRLS CAN LOSE THEIR
JOBS.
EVEN THE OTHER DAY WHEN
YOU ASKED ME ABOUT RUSSELL
SIMMONS, I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
BECAUSE HE'S A PRODUCER OF
COMEDY SHOWS AND IF I SAY THE
WRONG THING ABOUT RUSSELL
SIMMONS I MAY NOT WORK IN A
COMEDY SHOW AGAIN.
WE ALWAYS
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE
THINGS.
THIS IS A CULTURAL
ISSUE.
WHERE IN THE WORLD CAN
YOU GO THAT WOMEN DON'T FEEL
THAT THEY ARE BEING -- THAT THEY
ARE SECOND-BEST?
IT'S
EVERYWHERE, IT'S IN EVERYTHING,
AND I DO AGREE WITH BERNIE.
WE
HAVE TO HAVE A PARADIGM SHIFT,
AND IT BEGINS WITH THE EDUCATION
OF OUR BOYS.
THE BIGGEST
FEMINIST IN OUR HOUSE IS MY SON.
MY DAUGHTER KNOWS, I TALKED TO
HER ABOUT IT, BUT I HAD TO
EDUCATE MY SON ON HOW TO TREAT
WOMEN.
>>YOU TOLD ME THAT STORY OFF
THE AIR ABOUT THE BREAKFAST, AND
IT WAS A REALLY INTERESTING
PERSPECTIVE, I NEVER THOUGHT OF
IT THAT WAY.
I GO TO BREAKFAST
MEETINGS ALL THE TIME, I DON'T
THINK TWICE ABOUT IT, BUT FROM
YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU WENT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT A SHOW, YOU
HAD TO BE CONCERNED, IS HE THIS
TYPE OF GUY OR THAT TYPE OF GUY?
AND WHEN YOU SAID THAT TO ME I
WAS LIKE, WOW, I'VE NEVER HAD TO
GO TO ANY MEETING, BREAKFAST OR
OTHERWISE, WHERE I THOUGHT MIGHT
I BE IN DANGER?
AND WHAT MIGHT
HAPPEN HERE THAT PUTS ME IN AN
AWKWARD SPOT?
SO TRY TO THINK
ABOUT THE SHOE BEING ON THE
OTHER FOOT AND BROADEN YOUR
PERSPECTIVE HERE.
AND FOR WHAT
BERNIE SAID, I KNOW WHY THE
MEDIA COVERS OTHER STUFF MORE,
AND IT'S VERY LOGICAL.
EVERYBODY
KNOWS HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND KEVIN
SPACEY, A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THE
ACCUSERS, ASHLEY JUDD, ETC., SO
IT'S HARD TO RESIST THAT STORY,
AND YOU SHOULDN'T. AND IN FACT
COVERING THAT 1.6% HAS LED TO, I
THINK, AND AWAKENING THAT HAS
AFFECTED THE REST OF THE CULTURE
AND SOCIETY, SO I THINK IT'S
BEEN A GREAT MOVEMENT OVERALL.
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY, I'M NOT
SURE WHAT THE ANSWER IS, TO GET
THE HELP FOR OTHER WOMEN WHO
NEED IT WHEN IT'S NOT AS
INTERESTING TO THE REST OF THE
MEDIA TO COVER IT.
>>YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE
ASHLEY JUDDS OF THE WORLD, ROSE
MCGOWAN, LUPITA NYONG'O, CAME
OUT BECAUSE THE EXPEDITED THIS
CULTURAL SHIFT IN THE WAY PEOPLE
COULD GRASP ONTO BECAUSE THEY
ARE TANGIBLE, WE KNOW WHO THEY
ARE, THEY HAVE NAME RECOGNITION
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY
COME FORWARD, AND IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT THINGS SHIFT FROM THE TOP
DOWN AS WELL.
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE HAVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
TRAINING IN CONGRESS AND THE
SENATE, WE MAKE MORE LAWS TO TRY
TO PREVENT THIS SORT OF THING
FROM HAPPENING, BUT I THINK WHAT
AIDA IS GETTING AT AND WHAT IS
IMPORTANT, OBVIOUSLY THE
PUNISHMENT OF THE MEN WHO DO
THESE THINGS AND COMMIT THESE
SORTS OF ACTS IS CRUCIAL TO THIS
SHIFT WE SEE, BUT IT'S ALSO
REALLY ABOUT EDUCATION.
FOR
WOMEN, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
CENK, IT'S NOT IF WE ARE GOING
TO GET SEXY HARASSED, OR IF WE
ARE GOING TO GET SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED, IT'S WHEN.
THAT IS
THE REALITY OF WHAT IT MEANS TO
BE A WOMAN.
YOU CAN GO TO ONE
MEETING AND IT COULD BE OKAY,
THEN THE NEXT MEETING IT'S NOT.
SO FOR THESE WOMEN WHO HAVE
THESE ESTABLISHED CAREERS AND
HAVE THE PLATFORM TO COME
FORWARD, I APPLAUD THEM, BUT IF
YOU ARE YOUNGER, IF YOU DON'T
HAVE AN ESTABLISHED CAREER, IF
YOU ARE IN A LOW INCOME JOB, IF
YOU ARE A PERSON OF COLOR, IT'S
NOT SO EASY, SO WE NEED TO
PROVIDE A NET FOR THEM TO COME
FORWARD ABOUT THESE THINGS, WE
NEED TO PROVIDE THEM PROTECTION,
AND WE REALLY NEED TO PROVIDE AN
EDUCATION FOR OUR BOYS THAT IT'S
NOT OKAY TO EXERT YOUR POWER IN
THESE WAYS AND IT'S NOT OKAY TO
HOLD THESE BELIEFS THAT YOU CAN
SPEAK ABOUT, ACT AROUND WOMEN,
IN THESE WAYS.
