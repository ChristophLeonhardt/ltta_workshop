KEN STARR IS ON TV AND HE HAS
THE GOAL TO TALK ABOUT A
PROSECUTOR WHO MIGHT BE
OVERREACHING.
THIS IS OF COURSE IN REFERENCE
TO MUELLER WHO IS A SPECIAL
COUNSELOR AS KEN STARR WAS
INVESTIGATING WHITEWATER WHICH
IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER WAS A REAL
ESTATE DEAL AND HE IS SAYING HOW
MUELLER MIGHT BE OVERREACHING
GOING INTO CHUMS FINANCES, BUT
IF THE FINANCES ARE CONNECTED TO
RUSSIA, THAT WOULD BE THE HEART
OF THE INVESTIGATION BUT THAT'S
OKAY, LET'S HEAR THEM OUT.
NOW THE QUESTION IS, WITH
THEIR COLLUSION WITH THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN?
SO THE INVESTIGATION GOES
BEYOND THE RUSSIAN MANDATE AND
LET'S JUST SAY, LET'S LOOK INTO
THE FINANCING OF TRUMP TOWER BUT
THERE IS NO RUSSIAN CONNECTION
TO IT, BUT THE ARGUMENT AS
I SEE IT IS THERE THAT THE
INVESTIGATION IS GONE TOO FAR.
WAIT A MINUTE, THEY FIND OUT
THAT HE HAS FINANCIAL DEALS
WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THAT
THAT ALLOWED HIM TO FINANCE
TRUMP TOWER, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR A
STORY WE COVERED ON THE
YOUNG TURKS, FOUND OUT THAT ONE
THIRD OF THE APARTMENTS IN
TRUMP TOWER WHEN IT FIRST GOT
UP, AND THIS IS A TIME WHEN
DONALD TRUMP WAS IN THE
MIDDLE OF A BANKRUPTCY IN A
MASSIVE TROUBLE, WERE BOUGHT BY
THE RUSSIANS.
IF THEY'RE JUST INNOCENT
RUSSIAN CITIZENS THAT JUST
COINCIDENTALLY HAPPENED TO BUY
ONE THIRD OF THE APARTMENTS
IN TRUMP TOWER, OKAY, THAT IT IS
NOT RELATED, BUT IF IT HAS
TO DO WITH MONEY LAUNDERING
THAN IT MIGHT BE ENORMOUSLY
RELATED AND BY THE WAY, YOU
DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU INVESTIGATE
THAT YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT IT
WAS MONEY LAUNDERING.
YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT IT WAS
SOME SORT OF A LEGAL DEAL
WITH THE RUSSIANS.
I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO TRUMP.
YOU HAVE TO INVESTIGATE TO FIND
OUT IF IT IS RIGHT ISN'T
AND THERE'S ONLY WAY TO DO THAT.
TO DO THIS INVESTIGATION BY THE
WAY, IT ISN'T A MANDATE
THAT ROB ROSENSTEIN THE DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT PUT
MUELLER IN CASE THE FIRST ONE
SAID IN HIS LETTER THAT
MUELLER COULD INVESTIGATE ANY
MATTERS THAT AROSE OR MAY
ARISE DIRECTLY FROM THE
INVESTIGATION.
KEN STARR, WHO LEGENDARILY WENT
ABOVE HIS MANDATE AND WENT INTO
BILL CLINTON'S SEX LIFE FOR
REASONS NO ONE UNDERSTANDS TO
THIS DAY IS GOING TO SAY HEY, BE
VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW FAR YOU
GO WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.
HOW HE COMES ON TV AND HAS THE
TEMERITY TO SAY THIS, IT IS
AMAZING AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND
EXCEPT REPUBLICANS JUST
DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF
APOSTROPHE.
THEY HAVE NO ISSUE WITH AT ALL
BUT I WANT YOU TO WATCH AND
THEN I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A
SERIES OF PICTURES AFTERWARD
THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF
WHAT CANCER ACTUALLY DID.
THE MANDATE THAT BOB MUELLER
RECEIVED HAS SOME BROAD LANGUAGE
INCLUDING RELATED TO TYPE
LANGUAGE WHICH TENDS TO OPEN THE
DOOR BUT THERE ARE CHECKS AND
BALANCES, THE PRESIDENT HAS
SAID HERE IS THE REDLINE.
I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF
THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT WAS
WAS THEIR COLLUSION TO THE
EXTENT THAT YOU WERE MOVING
BEHIND COLLUSION WITH RUSSIAN
OPERATIVES OR INTERESTS OR
THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND INTO
THAT, WHICH DOESN'T SEEM TO
HAVE A DIRECT TITLE RUSSIA, THEN
THESE QUESTIONS ARE IN FACT
RAISED AND IT BECOMES A LITTLE
GLOBAL AS WE SAY QUESTION
THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SQUAWK
ABOUT AND DISAGREE ABOUT IT.
I DON'T THINK IT IS CLEAR ONE
WAY OR THE OTHER, BUT I DO THINK
IT IS CERTAINLY A SERIOUS MATTER
WHEN A SPECIAL COUNSEL IS
ACCUSED, AND I WAS ACCUSED OF
THAT, OF EXCEEDING HIS OR
HER AUTHORITY.
THAT IS A SERIOUS MATTER
BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT
INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS
OUT ON A FISHING EXPEDITION.
A FISHING EXPEDITION?
CAN START TALKING ABOUT THAT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS HE
SAID EARLIER.
THE PRESIDENT IS DRAWING A RED
LEONARD INVESTIGATING HIS
FINANCES.
THE PRESIDENT IS THE SUBJECT OF
THE INVESTIGATION.
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL CARE
WITH THE SUBJECT OF HIS
INVESTIGATION DRAWS THE REDLINE.
IT'S LIKE A BANK ROBBER SAYING
LOOK, YOU CAN LOOK INTO ME
RUB MUGGING PEOPLE ARE
ASSAULTING THEM, BUT I'M
GOING TO DRAW THE REDLINE ON YOU
INVESTIGATING THE ROBBING BANKS.
AND YOUR OPINION IS RELEVANT
WHY?
YOU DON'T GET TO SET THE
PARAMETERS OF WHAT PEOPLE
INVESTIGATE YOU INVESTIGATE.
THE IDEA THAT LET'S SAY ROBERT
MUELLER FINDS THAT TRUMP IS
CLEARLY OBVIOUSLY FLAGRANTLY
IN VIOLATION OF MONEY
LAUNDERING SCHEMES.
WHAT IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO?
GOVERNMENTAL THAT IN THE
GARBAGE, BARRY, DON'T GIVE
IT TO THE PRESS OR AUTHORITIES.
IT IS BEYOND MY MANDATE.
I INCLUDED EVIDENCE, HE
SAYS IN THE EMAIL, THAT'S OKAY.
BUT DONÃ­T INVESTIGATE
THAT BECAUSE IT CAME UP IN
YOUR INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIA.
IF THAT IS THE CASE, LET HIM TO
THE INVESTIGATION SO WE CAN
ALL FIND OUT.
AND BY THE WAY, TRUMP DENIES
THE INCIDENT AND ASSESS HIS
CLAIMS AND HIS SUPPORTERS
CAN START GOING OUT THERE
DEFENDING AND THEN WE WILL FIND
THAT OUT.
THERE WILL BE NO SMOKING GUN.
YOU DON'T KNOW SO I THINK I DO
HIS JOB.
NOW FINALLY COMING TO THE
FISHING EXPEDITION.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, CAN START?
YOU GUYS REMEMBER WHAT KEN
STARR WAS ACTUALLY PICKED TO
INVESTIGATE?
YOU MIGHT NOT.
YOU HEAR THE
WORD WHITEWATER EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE.
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT IS?
IT IS REAL ESTATE IN ARKANSAS.
WE HAVE A PICTURE OF IT FOR YOU.
THIS IS WHAT HE WAS SET TO
INVESTIGATE.
DID BILL CLINTON HAVE SOME SORT
OF ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL OR
UNTOWARD DEAL RELATING TO
WHITEWATER REAL ESTATE IN
ARKANSAS?
YOU KNOW WHAT THE INVESTIGATION
SHOWED?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
NOT GUILTY.
SO I GUESS CAN WAS DONE BECAUSE
HE IS NOT A FISHING EXPEDITION.
NO, IT WASN'T DONE.
HE WAS LIKE I DON'T CARE.
THAT WAS MY REAL ESTATE THAT
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO
INVESTIGATE INSTEAD?
THIS.
WAIT, GO THE NEXT PICTURE.
SHOW ME HOW WHITEWATER REAL
ESTATE LED TO MONICA
LEWINSKY'S DRESS?
FISHING EXPEDITION.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FISHING
EXPEDITION?
YOU RAN THE MOST LEGENDARY
FISHING EXPEDITION IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.
ANY OF THE GOLDA, TV AGO NO,
LET'S MAKE SURE MUELLER IS
INVESTIGATING MANY POSSIBLE
CRIMES ARE THERE CERTAIN
CRIMES HE SHOULD NOT
INVESTIGATE.
THAT WILL BE EXCEEDING YOUR
AUTHORITY AND OFF-LIMITS.
YOU DO FIND THAT.
AND COME ON HERE AND TELL US
THAT PROSECUTORS SHOULDN'T
GO ON FISHING EXPEDITIONS.
THEY JUST ARE NOT CONNECTED TO
THE TRUTH OR REALITY OR FAX
AT ALL.
THEY DON'T CARE, SO JUST GO AND
BRAZENLY SAY STUFF LIKE
THIS ON TV.
