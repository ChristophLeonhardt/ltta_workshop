I DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM BY 
HOW MUCH. 
I DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM BY 
HOW MUCH. 
HE IS DOING GREAT. 
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY. 
ASSUME YOU ARE DOWN BY ONE 
POINT. 
IT'S THE BEST. 
THAT WAY YOU WORK REAL HARD. 
I WANT TO THANK -- THANK YOU, I 
WANT TO THANK KELLY ARMSTRONG 
WHO IS HERE SOMEPLACE. 
KELLY? 
THANK YOU KELLY. 
RNNING FOR CONGRESS AND ALSO 
REALLY OUT THERE, VERY POPULAR, 
VERY OUTSTANDING PERSON AND 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
YOU ARE GOING TO DO FANTASTIC, 
KELLY. 
APPRECIATE IT. 
RICK BURG WHO IS THE HEAD OF 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
RICK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU, RICK. 
WE HAVE A VERY SIMPLE WELL 
DEFINED TASK. 
WE WANT TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS. 
WE WANT TO HAVE LOW TAXES. 
WE WANT TO CUT THE HELL OUT OF 
REGULATIONS. 
WE WANT -- WE WANT REGULATIONS. 
SOMEONE VERY POPULAR GUY HERE 
WAS JUST INTERVIEWING ME. 
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT. 
GREAT GUY. 
HE SAID WHAT DID YOU THINK OF 
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH? 
I SAID I'M SORRY, I WATCHED IT 
BUT I FELL ASLEEP. 
I FOUND HE IS VERY GOOD, VERY 
GOOD FOR SLEEPING. 
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO TAKE 
IN CREDIT. 
HE WAS TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT 
FOR THIS INCREDIBLE THING 
THAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR 
COUNTRY. 
IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT -- I HAVE 
TO SAY THIS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
IT WASN'T HIM BUT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE SAME THING. 
IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT IN WITH 
THEIR AGENDA IN NOVEMBER OF 
ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO, INSTEAD 
OF HAVING 4.2 UP I BELIEVE YOU 
WOULD HAVE 4.1 DOWN. 
YOU WOULD BE IN NEGATIVE 
NUMBERS RIGHT NOW. 
YOU WOULD BE A NEGATIVE NUMBER. 
WE WERE HEADING SOUTH. 
YOU LOOK AT THOSE BAD NUMBERS 
THAT WERE THERE IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS. 
IT WAS THIS WAY AND GOING IN 
THE WRONG DIRECTION. 
IT WAS THE WEAKEST RECOVERY IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 
SINCE, I GUESS -- TO BE 
SPECIFIC BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE 
THEY HAVE GONE ANY FURTHER 
SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN 
THE 20s. 
IT WAS THE WEAKEST RECOVERY WE 
HAVE EVER HAD. 
BARELY A RECOVERY. 
NOW THIS IS CALLED NOT 
RECOVERY, THIS IS CALLED ROCKET 
SHIP WHAT'S HAPPENED. 
TODAY, TODAY NUMBERS CAME OUT 
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
MAKES ME HAPPY. 
THE NUMBERS WERE GREAT. 
THE JOB NUMBERS WERE GREAT. 
THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN 
INCREDIBLE. 
ALMOST FROM THE BEGINNING. 
TOOK ME A FEW MONTHS TO GET THE 
ENGINE STARTED. 
WE DID THAT WITH REGULATION. 
WE DID THAT BY FREEING IT UP. 
YOU HAD PIPELINES THAT COULDN'T 
BE BUILT. 
I IMMEDIATELY APPROVED THEM. 
DAKOTA. 
HOW ABOUT DAKOTA ACCESS? 
THAT WAS AN UNFAIR SITUATION. 
I APPROVED IT. 
I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE 
PROTESTS. 
NOBODY CALLED ME. 
THEY JUST BUILT THE PIPELINE. 
ITS BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE. 
LOT OF JOBS. 
IT WAS VERY UNFAIR. 
THEY GOT THEIR APPROVALS AND 
THEN SAID YOU HAVE YOUR 
APPROVAL BUT YOU CAN'T BUILD 
IT. 
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BUILD 
IT. 
I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NEVER BE 
ABLE TOA BUILD IT. 
I APPROVED IT ON DAY ONE. 
THE SAME THING WITH KEYSTONE. 
I APPROVED KEYSTONE. 
TOTAL OF 48,000 JOBS. 
MORE IMPORTANTLY TWO GREAT 
PROJECTS. 
WE APPROVED THEM BOTH 
IMMEDIATELY. 
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN STUCK. 
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN STUCK. 
YOU WERE NEVER GETTING THAT 
APPROVED. 
SO MANY PEOPLE THANKED ME FOR 
THAT. 
I GUESS MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN I 
WALKED IN. 
I WAS WALKING IN WITH KEVIN AND 
WALKING THROUGH THE DOOR AND A 
STRONG MAN CAME UP TO ME. 
A TOUGH, KIND OF A GUY. 
HE SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU, 
MR. PRESIDENT FOR SAVING OUR 
COUNTRY. 
HE HAD -- HE HAD TEARS COMING 
DOWN HIS EYES. 
HE HAD -- THIS WASN'T JUST A 
STATEMENT. 
HE HAD TEARS COMING DOWN UNLESS 
HE WAS -- A REAL WISE GUY. 
HE HAD TEARS COMING DOWN HIS 
EYES. 
HE SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU MR. 
PRESIDENT FOR SAVING OUR 
COUNTRY. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF 
THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT YOU 
HAVE TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S 
SO UNFAIR TO YOU AND IT'S SO 
UNFAIR TO ALL OF THE MILLIONS 
AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
THAT VOTED FOR YOU. 
IT'S TRUE. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
SO, SO I REALLY APPRECIATED 
THAT. 
IT'S VERY HARD FOR REPUBLICANS 
AND CONSERVATIVES. 
WE HAVE A GREAT JUDGE RIGHT NOW 
BEING LOOKED AT TO GO UP AND BE 
THE NEXT JUSTICE OF THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT. 
THIS IS A GREAT MAN, IS HE A 
FINE PERSON. 
THE WAY THEY ARE SCREAMING AND 
SHOUTING AND IT'S A DISGRACE TO 
OUR COUNTRY. 
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAS BEEN 
WATCHING IT. 
THEY ARE MAKING FOOLS OF 
THEMSELVES. 
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE I WILL RUN 
AGAINST IN TWO AND A HALF 
YEARS. 
I WILL RUN AGAINST THEM AND I 
LOOK FORWARD TO IT. 
WE WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE IT 
BACK. 
SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. 
THE COURT SYSTEM IS VERY 
IMPORTANT. 
I WILL BE APPOINTING AND HAVE 
APPOINTED A RECORD NUMBER OF 
JUDGES. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE DISTRICT 
COURT JUDGES, COURT OF APPEALS, 
SUPREME COURT, AND ONE OF THE 
REASONS THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO 
GET KEVIN IN IS JUST THAT. 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT COULD 
CHANGE VERY QUICKLY. 
WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE, YOU 
KNOW, THIS WILL BE HOPEFULLY 
EVERYTHING GOES VERY WELL WITH 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
IS HE CENTRAL CASTING. 
TEN YEARS AGO THEY SAID HE WILL 
BE A SUPREME COURT JUDGE. 
THE INTELLIGENCE IS 
EXTRAORDINARY AND THE MAN IS 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
THEY WERE SAYING THIS YEARS 
AGO. 
I HEARD IT EVEN BEFORE I EVER 
THOUGHT I WOULD BE DOING THIS 
THAT THERE WAS A MAN NAMED 
KAVANAUGH WHO IS EXTRAORDINARY. 
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE WANTON 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
WE HAVE TWO OF THEM, WE WILL 
HAVE HIM HOPEFULLY AND WE HAVE 
JUSTICE GORSUCH WHO IS JUST AN 
OUTSTANDING MAN. 
I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. 
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT GOING. 
IF WE DON'T KEEP IT GOING THAT 
CHANGES. 
IF IT CHANGES THAT AFFECTS YOUR 
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, SO 
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. 
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO IT BUT 
IT AFFECTS SO MANY DIFFERENT 
ELEMENTS OF YOUR LIFE. 
I KNOW IT'S A BIG NATIVE 
AMERICAN POPULATION AND I KNOW 
ITS BEEN VERY TOUGH AND I KNOW 
HEIDI HASN'T DONE A GOOD JOB IN 
TAKING CARE OF THEM. 
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE 
RIGHT CHOICES, MAYBE THEY DON'T 
KNOW ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON 
WITH RESPECT TO THE WORLD OF 
WASHINGTON AND POLITICS BUT I 
HAVE TO TELL YOU WITH AFRICAN 
AMERICAN FOLKS I WOULD SAY WHAT 
DO YOU HAVE TO LOOSE? 
AS I READ A LIST OF THE WORST 
THINGS YOU HAVE HEARD. 
HIGHEST CRIME RATES, WORST 
EDUCATION, LOWEST HOMEOWNER 
SHIP AND I READ LIKE TEN ITEMS 
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET. 
THEY GAVE ME A LIST. 
I WAS MAKING A SPEECH AND I'M 
READING ALL OF THESE HORRIBLE 
THINGS ABOUT CRIME AND 
EDUCATION AND HOME AND SO MANY 
THINGS. 
I JUST SAID, WHAT DO YOU HAVE 
TO LOOSE? 
VOTE FOR ME. 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOOSE? 
YOU REMEMBER THAT? 
MY PEOPLE ALL CAME UP TO ME AND 
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. 
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. 
I SAID WHY? 
THE RESPONSE WAS INCREDIBLE. 
WHY? 
I USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND 
FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, WE WENT WAY 
UP. 
NOW WE HAVE PRODUCED BECAUSE 
NOW AFRICAN AMERICAN, 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE BEST 
NUMBER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
BEST NUMBER MEANING IT'S AT THE 
LOWEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
ASIAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC 
AMERICAN AND WOMEN OF 65 YEARS. 
HISPANIC. 
THINK OF IT. 
IT'S THE BEST NUMBER IN THE 
HISTORY OF YOUR COUNTRY. 
ASIAN IS THE LOWEST IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
I SAY WITH RESPECT TO THE 
NATIVE AMERICANS THAT I GO 
RIGHT BACK TO WHERE I WAS TWO 
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS 
CAMPAIGNING, WHAT DO YOU HAVE 
TO LOOSE? 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOOSE? 
YOU PUT KEVIN INTO THAT 
POSITION AND YOU WILL SEE 
THINGS HAPPEN THAT YOU WILL 
NEVER SEE WITH HEIDI. 
YOU JUST NEVER ARE GOING TO SEE 
IT WITH HEITDI. 
I WILL SAY VERY RESPECTFULLY 
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO 
LOOSE? 
RIGHT? 
SO, I HAVE A LIST AND THE LIST 
GOES ON AND ON. 
IT'S FOUR PAGES OF THINGS THAT 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 
ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME, LESS THAN TWO YEARS. 
THIS GOES ON AND ON AND ON. 
IF I READ IT TO YOU -- THIS IS 
-- IF I READ -- EACH DOT IS A 
THING OKAY? 
SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE VERY 
BIG THINGS. 
MORE THAN 4 MILLION JOBS 
CREATED SINCE THE ELECTION. 
THINK OF THAT. 
201,000 JOBS JUST LAST MONTH, 
BRAND NEW JOBS. 
WAGES ARE GROWING AT THE 
FASTEST PACE IN NEARLY A DECADE 
AND WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING? 
DID YOU HEAR THAT? 
2.9%. 
IT'S LIKE THE BEST WAGE NUMBER 
THAT WE HAVE HAD IN MANY YEARS. 
THAT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY. 
TO ME, WE HAD GREAT JOBS 
NUMBERS THIS MORNING. 
THEY WERE JUST ANNOUNCED. 
THEY WERE FANTASTIC BUT THE ONE 
THAT STUCK OUT TO ME WAS THE 
WAGE. 
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO BE ABLE 
TO LIVE. 
TO LIVE. 
SO NOT ONLY UNEMPLOYMENT BUT 
THE WAGES ARE STARTING TO GO UP 
FOR PEOPLE. 
MORE AMERICANS ARE NOW EMPLOYED 
THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE 
RECORDED HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
TODAY, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MORE 
PEOPLE WORKING THAN HAVE EVER 
WORKED. 
WE HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 
400,000. 
THAT'S VERY SOON GOING TO BE 
600,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS 
SINCE MY ELECTION. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID YOU WON'T 
HAVE MANUFACTURING JOBS 
ANYMORE. 
THEY AREN'T AROUND. 
THEY ARE AROUND. 
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE DONE 
FOR YOUR COAL INDUSTRY IT'S 
INCREDIBLE. 
WE HAD A MAN WHO IS IN THE 
MINING BUSINESS WHO SAID. 
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE COAL 
INDUSTRY IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE 
WE WERE DEAD AND NOW WE ARE V 
IB RANT AGAIN. 
SHOUT OUT THAT, I SIGNED HIS 
HAT. 
HE IS PROBABLY LOADED I'M 
SIGNING HATS. 
COME UP HERE. 
GET HIM UP HERE. 
CAN YOU GET HIM UP HERE? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
WHO THE HELL KNOWS. 
HE IS IN THE COAL BUSINESS. 
COME ON UP. 
SEE IF YOU CAN GET HIM UP HERE. 
HE WILL HAVE TO WORK -- HE WILL 
HAVE TO WORK THROUGH SECRET 
SERVICE BUT WHO CARES? 
I'M TELLING YOU SECRET SERVICE, 
HE WILL BE ALL RIGHT. 
THIS GUY WANTS TO PROTECT 
TRUMP. 
COME HERE. 
COME HERE. 
DOES EVERYBODY RECOGNIZE HIM? 
I DON'T. 
HE IS A BIG -- IS HE ONE OF THE 
BIGGESTFUL TELL THEM WHAT YOU 
SAID? 
DO YOU MIND? 
IT'S ALWAYS VERY DANGEROUS FOR 
ME. 
>>  IF -- GIVEN AN ORDER I 
GUESS YOU OBEY. 
WHAT I SAID IS THAT -- YOU 
KNOW, FOR EIGHT YEARS THE COAL 
INDUSTRY HAD THE BOOT OF 
GOVERNMENT ON ITS THROAT. 
MANY, MANY JOBS WERE LOST AND 
MANY TOWNS WERE DESTROYED BY 
THIS. 
IT WAS JUST A HORRIBLE THING. 
HORRIBLE SUFFERING THAT 
HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A 
MADE UP REASON, I THINK. 
WHAT YOUR ADMINISTRATION HAS 
DONE IS BRING US BACK TO LIFE. 
JOBS HAVE BEEN -- JOBS HAVE 
BEEN CREATED, FAMILIES HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FOR 
THEMSELVES AND HAVE A GREAT 
FUTURE AND EDUCATION AND SMALL 
TOWNS IN NORTH DAKOTA AND OTHER 
PLACES REALLY SURVIVE BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE A GREAT COAL MINE AND 
A GREAT POWER PLANT AND IT'S 
WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT. 
IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT WE AGAIN 
CARE ABOUT THOSE THINGS. 
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
REALLY NICE. 
SO NICE. 
I COULD STAND UP HERE AND TALK 
ABOUT COAL FOR A HALF HOUR AND 
I COULDN'T DO AS GOOD A JOB AS 
HE JUST DID. 
HE SAID WE WERE DEAD AND NOW WE 
ARE A V IB RANT INDUSTRY AGAIN. 
ANOTHER INDUSTRY THAT'S DOING 
WELL, IT AFFECTS EVERYBODY IS 
STEEL. 
THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS COMING 
BACK LIKE I HAVE NEVER SEEN 
ANYTHING BECAUSE OF WHAT WE 
HAVE DONE. 
WE HAVE DONE WITH ALL THE 
DUMPING, THEY AREN'T DOING SO 
MUCH DUMPING ANYMORE BUT THE 
STEEL INDUSTRIES ARE COMING 
BACK. 
WHEN THEY DO DUMP THEY PAY A 
LOT OF MONEY ON THE DUMP SEAL 
THEY ARE SENDING IN HERE. 
IT GOES RIGHT IN TO THE COFFERS 
OF OUR COUNTRY. 
THAT'S OKAY. 
U ARE UNITED STATES STEEL IS 
OPENING UP EIGHT PLANTS. 
NEW CORE AND OTHERS ARE OPEN BE 
UP PLANTS. 
SOME OF THEM ARE SPENDING CLOSE 
TO A BILLION DOLLARS ON A BRAND 
NEW PLANT. 
THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS ONE OF 
THE GREAT THINGS TO BE TALKING 
ABOUT. 
SO, THE MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE 
BACK. 
THEY ARE COMING BACK AND THEY 
ARE COMING BACK AT LEVELS. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH AS YOU KNOW 
LAST QUARTER, 4.2%. 
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS HIT A 49 
YEAR LOW. 
I'M GOING THROUGH THEM LIKE 
HUH. 
MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HIT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED. 
THAT'S NOT BAD, RIGHT? 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE BIG ONES. 
AMERICAN PENSIONS HAVE GROWN 
MORE THAN TWO TRILLON DOLLARS 
TERE VALUE SINCE THEE LIKES 
ELECTION. 
AFRICAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT. 
THE BEST EVER. 
THE BEST EVER. 
LOWEST NUMBER EVER. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN. 
ASIAN AMERICAN, WOMEN 65 YEARS, 
SORRY ABOUT THAT. 
IT'S -- I LIKE HISTORY BETTER. 
HISTORIC -- I JOKE BUT -- WOMEN 
AT 65 YEARS. 
BEST NUMBERS IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN 
65 YEARS. 
IT'S GOOD. 
IT'LL BE HISTORIC, I WOULD SAY 
BEST IN HISTORY VERY SHORTLY. 
PROBABLY ANOTHER TWO WEEKS. 
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. 
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT THE BEST IN 
HALF A CENTURY. 
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 
RECORDED FOR AMERICANS WITHOUT 
A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. 
NOBODY EVEN TALKS ABOUT THIS 
STUFF. 
THAT'S LIKE -- YOU PROBABLY 
NEVER HEARD OF THESE 
CATEGORIES. 
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT CATEGORIES 
TO ME. 
VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED 
IT'S LOWEST IN MORE THAN 20 
YEARS. 
THAT'S GOING UP RAPIDLY. 
I THINK IT'S WRONG. 
I THINK IT'S A HIGHER -- MUCH 
BETTER THAN THAT. 
IF IT'S NOT I WILL MAKE SURE IT 
IS. 
I WILL MAKE SURE. 
WE LOVE OUR VETERANS. 
ALMOST 3.9 MILLION AMERICANS 
HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD 
STAMPS SINCE MY ELECTION. 
3.9.
SO MEDICARE, THE DEMOCRATS WILL 
DESTROY MEDICARE. 
THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY YOUR 
SOCIAL SECURITY. 
WE ARE GOING TO SAVE IT. 
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT. 
WE AREN'T GOING TO TOUCH IT. 
DID YOU SEE WHAT I CAMPAIGNED I 
WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT SAID WE 
ARE NOT TOUCHING SOCIAL 
SECURITY? 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT AND 
I SAID GROWTH. 
WE ARE GROWING FASTER THAN I 
PROJECTED THOUGH I THOUGHT WE 
WOULD BE AROUND THAT NUMBER. 
IF I SAID IT DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN THEY WOULD HAVE 
LAUGHED ME OFF THE STAGE. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO 
THAT FOR A LONG TIME. 
THAT HASN'T BEEN WORKING TOO 
WELL HAS IT? 
WE ARE GOING TO GROW A LOT 
FASTER. 
WE ARE DOING WELL AND YOU HAVE 
THE 4.2. 
WE WILL GO HIGHER THAN THAT. 
MOST WOULD HAVE SAID 4.2, THAT 
WILL TAKE YEARS BUT IT DIDN'T. 
I SAID IT'LL GO MUCH HIGHER 
THAN ANYONE BELIEVES. 
WHEN WE FIX THE TRADE DEALS 
THAT HAS A BIG IMPACT. 
WE ARE LOSING 100 BILLION WITH 
MEXICO, WE ARE LOSING FROM 25 
TO 50 BILLION WITH CANADA, EVEN 
THOUGH THEY LIKE TO SAY WE HAVE 
NO DEFICIT. 
THEY ARE SMART IN SAYING THAT. 
THEY HAVE A SHEET OUT THAT IT'S 
$98.2 BILLION. 
THEY DON'T SHOW US THAT SHEET. 
THAT'S MEANT FOR OTHER REASONS. 
THEY SHOWED 98.2 BILLION. 
WE ARE WORKING ON A DEAL WITH 
CANADA. 
WE WILL SEE IF IT'S GOOD. 
IF IT'S GOOD FOR US, FOR THEM. 
I WANT IT TO BE GOOD FOR 
EVERYBODY. 
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO GET 
RIPPED OFF LIKE WE HAVE BEEN 
RIPPED OFF BEFORE. 
OUR FARMERS IMPORTANT TO ME. 
OUR FARMERS AND YOU ARE GREAT 
PATRIOTS. 
IT TAKES TIME BUT CHINA WASN'T 
LETTING YOU IN FOR PEANUTS. 
THE EU HAS BEEN VERY TOUGH ON 
YOU. 
THEY HAVE TRADE BARRIERS. 
THEY SELL US BUT WE AREN'T 
ALLOWED TO GO THERE THERE. 
I SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT. 
IF YOU DO THAT WE WILL TAX YOUR 
CARS. 
THAT'S EASY. 
THAT'S THE BIGGEST MONEY. 
THE CARS, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE 
CARS. 
THAT'S THE BIGGEST MONEY. 
THEY ARE ALL PUTTING CARS IN TO 
THE COUNTRY AND WE DON'T 
ESSENTIALLY TAX THEM. 
IT'S 2.5% BUT FOR THE MOST PART 
THEY DON'T PAY. 
THEY AREN'T USED TO PAYING THE 
UNITED STATES. 
NOW THEY ARE PAYING. 
IT'S ONLY 2.5% AND WITH THEM -- 
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR CARS AND IF 
THEY DO THEY HAVE A TARIFF MANY 
TIMES WHAT THEY PAY US. 
WE TAX THE CARS AND THEY SAY WE 
WILL MAKE A DEAL. 
EVERY TIME I HAVE A PROBLEM 
WITH ANY OF THESE -- MANY OF 
THESE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY THE 
BIG CAR COUNTRIE I SAY OKAY, 
WE CAN'T MAKE THE DEAL. 
THAT'S OKAY. 
I WILL PUT A 20% TAX ON YOUR 
CARS, WE WILL DO IT, WE WILL DO 
IT, WE WILL AGREE. 
WE WILL AGREE. 
I MEAN ACTUALLY IN SOME 
COUNTRIES, INCLUDING CANADA, A 
TAX ON CARS WOULD BE THE 
RUINING OF THE COUNTRY. 
THAT'S HOW BIG IT IS. 
IT WOULD RUIN THE COUNTRY. 
NOW, THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 
OF US FOR MANY DECADES. 
WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN 
ANYMORE. 
WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN. 
THE EXPRESSION WE HAVE A 
COMPANY TO RUN. 
WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN. 
WHEN I GET THESE HORRIBLE TRADE 
DEALS. 
THESE ARE ONE SIDED, HORRIBLE 
DEALS. 
I THINK NAFTS. 
PEOPLE FORGET BUT NAFTA HAS 
BEEN HORRIBLE. 
WORLD TRADE LET CHINA BECOME 
THIS BIG ECONOMIC POWER AND I 
SAID WE HAVE TO BE FAIR. 
WE CAN'T LET CHINA TAKE OUT 
$500 BILLION A YEAR OUT OF THE 
UNITED STATES AND REBUILD 
ITSELF. 
WE HAVE SOME OF THESE 
COUNTRIES, THEY ARE CONSIDERED 
GROWING ECONOMIES. 
THEY ARE CONSIDERED NATIONS IN 
THAT AREN'T MATURE SO WE PAY 
THEM. 
IT'S CRAZY. 
YOU KNOW, LIKE INDIA, LIKE 
CHINA, LIKE OTHERS, WE SAY THEY 
ARE GROWING, I WANT TO BE PUT 
DOWN THERE BECAUSE WE ARE 
GROWING TOO. 
WE WILL GROW FASTER THAN 
ANYTHING. 
YOU KNOW THEY CALL THEM 
DEVELOPING NATIONS. 
WE ARE A DEVELOPING NATION TOO. 
WE ARE. 
WE ARE -- AS FAR AS I'M 
CONCERNED WE ARE A DEVELOPING 
NATION. 
THEY CALL THEMSELVES DEVELOPING 
AND UNDER THAT CATEGORY THEY 
GET MONEY. 
WE HAVE TO PAY THEM. 
IT'S CRAZY. 
WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. 
WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. 
WE HAVE STOPPED IT. 
WHEN WE ARE SECURING MILITARY 
-- JOHN KELLY IS HERE. 
GENERAL KELLY. 
WHEN WE ARE SECURING THE 
WEALTHY COUNTRIES FROM OUTSIDE 
HARM BECAUSE WE ARE PAYING FOR 
THEIR MILITARY I THINK IT'S 
FINE BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY US 
FOR THIS. 
WE ARE WATCHING THE WHOLE WORLD 
AND THEY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. 
FOR YEARS AND YEARS WE HAVE 
BEEN PROTECTING THESE 
COUNTRIES. 
THEY ARE MAKING A FORTUNE. 
THEY ARE HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE 
MILITARY COSTS. 
WE HAVE THE BIGGEST MILITARY 
COSTS IN THE WORLD. 
MOST OF IT GOES TO PROTECTING 
OUTSIDE COUNTRIES. 
SOME OF THEM DON'T EVEN LIKE 
US. 
SOME OF THEM DON'T EVEN LIKE 
US. 
WE ARE PROTECTING COUNTRIES 
THAT HAVE -- I GOT GOT TO SAY 
THEY HAVE RESPECT FOR US NOW 
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE RESPECT 
FOR US. 
THEY GOT TO PAY. 
THEY GOT TO PAY. 
WHEN THEY ARE WEALTHY. 
WE WILL PROTECT PEOPLE THAT 
NEED HELP. 
THAT'S OKAY AND WE UNDERSTAND 
THAT. 
WHEN WE PROTECT WEALTHY 
COUNTRIES, I WON'T NAME THEM 
BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHO I'M 
TALKING ABOUT. 
THEY HAVE TO PAY. 
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE 
THE PROTECTOR OF THE WORLD AND 
LOOSE A FORTUNE AND HAVE OUR 
TAXPAYERS PAYING WHILE THESE 
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE LIVING VERY 
BEAUTIFULLY BECAUSE OF US. 
NOT FAIR. 
WE CHANGED THAT AROUND. 
I HOPE EVERYBODY  
BY THE WAY THEN THIS IDIOT 
WOODWARD WHO WROTE THIS FICTION 
BOOK SAID I SAID THAT BUT HE 
PUT IT IN A CRUDE MANNER. 
I -- THE CONCEPT IS TRUE BUT 
THE WAY IT WAS SAID WAS VERY -- 
YOU KNOW -- HEY, I WENT LIKE TO 
THE BEST COLLEGE, I DID A LOT 
OF -- YOU READ THIS THING AND 
THE QUOTES WERE WRONG. 
ALL THESE JOHN KELLY, GENERAL 
MATTICE WRITING -- I NEVER SAID 
THAT. 
I NEVER SAID THAT. 
IT'S FICTION. 
THEY DO PUT DOWN THE CONCEPT OF 
I SAID THAT AND ISN'T THAT 
HORRIBLE? 
ISN'T THAT CRUDE? 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I WANT TO HAVE OUR NATION 
PROTECTED AND I DON'T WANT TO 
BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY OTHER 
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THEY RESPECT US MORE WHEN THEY 
HAVE TO PAY THEIR BILLS AND 
THEY CAN AFFORD TO PAY THEM. 
ITS GOING TO MAKE A BIG 
DIFFERENCE FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
YOU WAIT, YOU WATCH, YOU SEE. 
SO MANY OTHER THINGS. 
I COULD GO -- HELP WITH THE 
OLYMPICS. 
WE HAVE THE OLYMPICS. 
WE JUST GOT THE WORLD CUP. 
THAT'S SMALL STUFF. 
I MUST TELL YOU. 
WE OPENED NYAR. 
POTENTIALLY THE BIGGEST IN THE 
WORLD. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT 
FOR 45 YEARS. 
WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF 
REGULATIONS ELIMINATED IN THE 
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IN LESS 
THAN TWO YEARS. 
I HAVE CUT MORE REGULATIONS 
THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT 
REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THEY 
HAVE SERVED. 
I THINK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN JUST 
AS IMPORTANT AS THE TAX CUTS. 
REGULATORY RELIEF FOR COMMUNITY 
BANKS. 
THEY WERE DYING. 
THE COMMUNITY BANKS. 
NOW THEY CAN LOAN YOU MONEY. 
MAKE A GOOD DEAL, PLEASE. 
WE PUT IN ALL SORTS OF 
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FOR CREDIT 
UNIONS TO COME SO THEY MAKE IT 
POSSIBLE FOR YOU. 
MY ADMINISTRATION IS PROVIDING 
MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE 
OPTIONS FOR AMERICANS THROUGH 
ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AND 
SHORT TERM DURATION PLANS. 
WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF HEALTH 
CARE. 
WE HAD IT BEATEN BUT THAT'S A 
LONG STORY. 
WE REPEALED AND REPLACED BUT WE 
WILL DO IT. 
WE WILL DO IT. 
WE WILL IT DONE BUT SOMETHING 
HAPPENED. 
WE -- FRANKLY YOU ARE RIGHT. 
HEIDI'S VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
GREAT. 
SHE VOTED AGAINST IT. 
WE GOT IF YOU REMEMBER THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS WIPED 
OUT. 
WE WIPED OUT THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE WHICH IS THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR PART OF OBAMA CARE. 
WE WIPED IT OUT. 
THEN I HAVE THREE MORE PAGES. 
TWO MORE PAGES. 
JUST LIKE THIS. 
LOOK. 
OKAY? 
ISN'T THIS MUCH -- ISN'T THIS 
MUCH MORE EXCITING THAN 
LISTENING TO PRESIDENT OBAMA 
SPEAK? 
BECAUSE WE GET THINGS DONE. 
ALL OF THIS LIKE THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM THE COAL INDUSTRY. 
I HAVE HAD THAT FROM SO MANY 
PEOPLE. 
I HAVE HAD IT FROM OTHER 
INDUSTRIES. 
WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR LUMBER. 
WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR CARS. 
PLANTS ARE MOVING BACK TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
THEY ARE COMING IN TO MICHIGAN, 
THEY ARE GOING INTO OHIO, 
PENNSYLVANIA, THEY ARE GOING 
INTO NORTH CAROLINA. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM COMING 
BACK IN. 
WE HAVE JUST STARTED. 
ONE OF THINGS I WANTED IS I 
DON'T WANT OUR COMPANIES AND I 
JUST -- INSIST ON IT. 
I DON'T WANT OUR COMPANIES 
MOVING TO OTHER COUNTRIES, 
FIRING EVERYBODY, LOSING THESE 
GREAT COMPANIES AND GREAT JOBS. 
THAT'S WHAT I INSIST ON WITH 
TREAD DEALS. 
WE DID NAFTA AND OUR COUNTRY 
EMPTIED OUT. 
THEY TILL HAVE EMPTY PLACES IN 
NEW ENGLAND WITH THESE BIG 
EMPTY FACTORIES. 
THEY MOVES TO OTHER PLACES BUT 
THEY MOVED TO MEXICO. 
I COULD GO ON AND ON AND 
REACHED SO MANY DIFFERENT 
THINGS. 
WE STARTED THE WALL. 
IT'S -- IT'S MOVING ALONG. 
KEVIN IS A BIG FAN. 
KEVIN IS A BIG FAN OF THE WALL. 
I JUST SAY THIS. 
WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS THAT I 
WILL -- I WILL PUT IT VERY 
STRONGLY. 
YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT IS UNDER 
SEIGE. 
YOU PUT THE WRONG PERSON IN 
THERE AND THEY WILL VOTE WITH 
SCHUMER. 
HEIDY WILL VOTE WITH NANCY 
PELOSI AND SCHUMER. 
I ADD MAXINE WATERS IN THERE 
BECAUSE -- HE IS GOING TO VOTE 
WITH -- WE ARE GOING TO VOTE -- 
HE WILL VOTE WITH ME. 
HE WILL VOTE ON MAKING AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN WHICH SOON -- WHICH 
SOON WE ARE GOING TO BE 
CHANGING TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
KEVIN WILL BE WITH US. 
WE HAVE THE AGENDA FOR THE 
COURTS AND BORDERS. 
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE POURING IN 
WHERE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY 
ARE. 
WITH THESE LOTTERIES. 
WE HAVE LOTTERIES FROM 
COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE COME IN 
THROUGH A LOTTERY. 
DO YOU THINK THAT THESE 
COUNTRIES ARE SENDING US THEIR 
FINEST? 
I DON'T THINK SO.
