BACK ABOVE THE 25,000 MARK. S&P 500 UP 24. NASDAQ FINISHED I HAD 51. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TOUTING HIS OWN INFLUENCE IN HIGH REPUBLICAN TURNOUT IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS HELD YESTERDAY IN EIGHT STATES. MUCH OF THE FOCUS WAS ON CALIFORNIA WHERE THE STATE'S UNUSUAL JUNGLE FORMAT COULD HAVE LOCKED OUT ONE PARTY COMPLETELY OUT OF THE NOVEMBER RACES. COURSE BY THE PETER DOOCY HAS AN UPDATE. CALIFORNIA'S GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY DIDN'T HAVE A BLUE WAVE. INSTEAD, A REPUBLICAN RIPTIDE. MAKE CALIFORNIA THE GOLDEN STATE ONCE AGAIN. WITH THAT FAMILIAR SOUNDING SLOGAN AFTER A STRONG FINISH TO PUT THEM ON THE BALLOT, REPUBLICAN JOHN COX IS CHANNELING PRESIDENT TRUMP WHILE DEMOCRAT GAVIN NEWSOM IS TWEETING TO HIM, URGING THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO GO FURTHER THAN JUST CONGRATULATING THE CANDIDATE HE HELPED WITH AN ENDORSEMENT WITH THIS. "PLEASE COME CAMPAIGN FOR HIM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE." VOTERS WILL HAVE A REAL CHOICE THIS NOVEMBER BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO STAND UP TO DONALD TRUMP AND A FOOT SOLDIER AND HIS WAR ON CALIFORNIA. JOHN COX IS CORRECTING NEWSOM. IT WASN'T DONALD TRUMP THAT PASSED THE SANCTUARY STATE. GAVIN, YOU DID THAT. CALIFORNIA'S AIRWAVES HAVE BEEN BLANKETED WITH COMMERCIALS. TURNOUT WAS A SOFT 21.9%, 3% LOWER THAN THE 2014 GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY. SOME VOTERS RUN INTO TROUBLE BECAUSE A PRINTING PROBLEM IN L.A. COUNTY LEFT 118,000 RESIDENTS OFF THE ROLES AND 1500 PRECINCTS. IT WAS AS MANY AS A FEW HUNDRED. WASN'T JUST A LONG NIGHT FOR THE L.A. REGISTRAR. IT TOOK HOURS TO LEARN DEMOCRATIC SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO FAILED TO WIN THE STATE PARTIES ENDORSEMENT WOULD BE CHALLENGED BY THE MORE PROGRESSIVE STATE SENATOR KEVIN DE LEON. IT ALSO TOOK A WHILE UNTIL RESULTS IN ORANGE COUNTIES EXPENSIVE PRIMARIES BEGAN TO TRICKLE IN AND WHEN THEY DID, DEMOCRATS WERE RELIEVED TO HAVE SEEN CANDIDATES CLAW THEIR WAY ONTO BALLOTS EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING DISTRICTS THEY RISKED COMING IN THIRD PLACE. TOO LOW FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE SAYS ITS INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO PAY DEVIN'S IN NOVEMBER AND BEYOND. TALK LIKE THAT DOESN'T IMPRESS ONE INCUMBENT. REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN DANA ROHRABACHER. HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO HEAR THERE'S A BLUE WAVE? REPUBLICANS ARE DEFENDING TEN HOUSE SEATS HERE. FOUND LATE LAST NIGHT THE AVENUE
