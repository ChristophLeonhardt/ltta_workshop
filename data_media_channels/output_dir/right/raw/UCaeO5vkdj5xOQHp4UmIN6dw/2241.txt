00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
well it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christmas time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,650
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means or you're a leftist and</font>

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't you see this is the festive</font>

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,820
time of the year when leftist hear the

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,250
sound of children laughing carolers

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">singing and worshippers saying their</font>

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,790
prayers and send their lawyers to hunt

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,309
them down and silence them forever

9
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,050
that's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> leftist believe that</font>

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,480
religion is insulting and moralistic and

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,430
should be destroyed because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's stupid</font>

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,740
and bad left this believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,570
exclusive to belong to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an inclusive</font>

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,429
religion like Christianity because it

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,199
excludes exclusive religions like Islam

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,480
and thus the inclusive religion is

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,430
exclusive for excluding the exclusive

18
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,290
which is inclusive<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it murders</font>

19
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,930
everyone leftists don't believe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Santa</font>

20
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,000
Claus because that's childish instead

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,890
they believe in an all-powerful and

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,840
beneficent figure who can be everywhere

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,730
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> once giving free gifts to those who</font>

24
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">deserve them and they're really sorry</font>

25
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,739
his presidency is coming to an end

26
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,969
leftist believed that conservative

27
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,530
religious people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be forced to</font>

28
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,109
fund abortions and participate in gay

29
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,430
weddings because when the founding

30
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">fathers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first amendment</font>

31
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,270
that Congress shall make no law

32
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,099
respecting an establishment of religion

33
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,979
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

34
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,900
they were really trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,939
Congress<font color="#CCCCCC"> should make those laws but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

36
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,590
got it all confused because they were

37
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,720
speaking in Old English and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s's</font>

38
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,490
looked like<font color="#CCCCCC"> f's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus they had nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

39
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,320
write with but feathers so the words got

40
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,240
smeared but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point the founders were</font>

41
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,950
trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the man should be</font>

42
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,540
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have sex with another man and</font>

43
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,280
then kill the baby if the second man

44
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,080
becomes pregnant because he identifies

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,750
as a woman and isn't that what Christmas

46
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,450
is really all about leftist believed

47
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,220
that when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> construct a tableau in a</font>

48
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,810
public place that shows a baby in a

49
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,030
manger surrounded by wise men shepherds

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,070
and farm animals it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous to</font>

51
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,740
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the baby is the son of the</font>

52
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,380
everliving God of course the tableau

53
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,360
must be taking down because it violates

54
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,500
the separation of church and state

55
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,780
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> baby is obviously the son of</font>

56
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the everliving God left is believed that</font>

57
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you shouldn't judge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people because jesus</font>

58
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,890
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> so but they don't believe in Jesus</font>

59
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,210
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still shouldn't judge people</font>

60
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,159
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes them feel bad about the</font>

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
things they've done because they haven't

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,070
been forgiven for them because they

63
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,930
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe in Jesus who said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

64
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,520
shouldn't judge<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but they don't</font>

65
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him okay it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make any</font>

66
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,460
sense but you're a hateful conservative

67
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,130
shut up<font color="#E5E5E5"> leftist believed that we should</font>

abandon our irrational faith in the

69
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,270
supernatural because now we have science

over that we were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decimate him</font>

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,160
the place but the Navy still controls

access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Seas and that is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

161

the reasons that Obama has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

162
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,789

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,950
like after Pearl Harbor<font color="#E5E5E5"> was bombed</font>

00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:35,800
is hostilities are taking place there's

182
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,180
there's no avoiding it there's no

183
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,710
looking away and saying it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

184
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,060
happening it's happening and compare

185

<font color="#CCCCCC">that to today when we have these people</font>

186
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,410

187
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,330
can't say the word Islam and connect it

190
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,350
that it's our fault that we are

<font color="#CCCCCC">Islamophobic which is insane I mean it's</font>

192
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,740

193
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,090
Islamic majority country is a slave

197
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,789
immediately they go to us it's our fault

198
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,560
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine if FDR had come out and</font>

199
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,560

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,389
bummed by the Japanese why do they hate

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,520
us so much you know why what have we

203
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,190
done to make them it must be our<font color="#E5E5E5"> aging</font>

204
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,680
phobia I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a terrible</font>

205
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,150
terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing here's what a president</font>

206
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,880
sounds like today here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama talking</font>

207
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,729
about victory so help us God in the war

208
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,760
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> terror I I'm always worried about</font>

209
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,250
using the word victory because you know

210
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,309
it evokes this notion of Emperor

211
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,150
Hirohito coming down and signing a

212
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,160
surrender to MacArthur you know we're

213
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">not dealing with nation states at this</font>

214
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,400
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're concerned with al-qaeda and</font>

215
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,810
the Taliban he's so smart he's so slow

216
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,089
it was intemperate you know as we know

217
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,730
who signed the who signed the surrender

218
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,589
it was I don't know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Foreign</font>

219
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Secretary in the name of euro that just</font>

220
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,570
just putting that aside from it I worry

221
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,000
about the word victory we don't have

222
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,250
victory we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting a war we don't</font>

223
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,770
want victory you know I mean eight years

224
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,690

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,100

227
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,779

what the carrier people said is exactly

286
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:48,800
what this guy said was that he knows

287
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these regulations and you know</font>

288

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">in every single one of those regulations</font>

292
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,490
cost some company money which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

costs you money when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to buy their</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his speech of the carrier plant he</font>

298
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,290
suddenly realized while he was

299
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,699
campaigning something that he could have

300
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:19,170
found out by just<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to the show</font>

301
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulations are even worse than</font>

302
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,970
high corporate taxes which we also have

303

of regulations you're not going to need

305
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,430
all these tariffs he's talking about

306
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,260
