I am an old woman a forgotten woman I
live by myself going on everyday life
waiting to die as I have no reason to
live anymore I have not spoken anyone in
three days as no one wants to speak to
an old woman my body parts are aching
more and more each day but I was once a
vibrant woman I had an amazing job care
of the people helping people I fell in
love at a very young age but the thing
is but good things will always come to
an end
love passion and motivation now I dream
dream of being young again
doing things but I can no longer do
because of my age I want to show people
that I'm not yet but very much to the
lies I can still do all those things I
can show them I can show them all if
only someone would call me
but it won't happen again
yeah
I said I'm riding with my
Grammy's back bitches
niko it's roman lets go bowling Oh piss
off Roman
