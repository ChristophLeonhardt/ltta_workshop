1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,750
WHILE ALL
THIS IS GOING ON, SOME ASPECTS

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,330
OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE
DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,830
MOORE, THE FUNDRAISING ARM OF
THE PARTY DISTANCED ITSELF FROM

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,270
MOORE AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
COMMENTED ON IT, SARAH HUCKABEE

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,270
SANDERS SAID --

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:35,780
>>I NOTICED THAT THAT IS WILL
DO THE RIGHT THING, NOT SHOULD

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,079
DO THE RIGHT THING AND STEP
ASIDE.

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,270
WE ARE STILL WEEKS AWAY

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,800
FROM THE ACTUAL RACE, POLLS
GENERALLY PUT MOORE UP BY ABOUT

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,399
EIGHT OR NINE POINTS, BUT --

11
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:03,149
>>WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT WILL LOOK
LIKE IN A WEEK, LET ALONE THREE

12
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,149
WEEKS?

13
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,009
BUT THIS COULD HAVE AN
EFFECT ON THE RACE.

14
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:10,109
>>I THINK IT WILL, I HAVE TO SAY
THIS, I KNOW THE FOX NEWS

15
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:15,240
AUDIENCE WELL, I THINK THE FOX
NEWS AUDIENCE IS A LOT SMARTER

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,649
THAN THIS AND I THINK THEY READ
THIS STORY AND THEY SEE IT FOR

17
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,719
WHAT IT IS, I THINK THEY CAN
SNIFF OUT B.S.ER WHEN THEY SEE

18
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,869
ONE.

19
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,180
I THINK THAT POLLS SPEAK TO
THAT, THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA ARE

20
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,109
SAYING WAIT A MINUTE -- MIND YOU
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY POLLING DONE

21
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:37,539
SINCE THIS REVELATION HAS
HAPPENED FROM A CREDIBLE

22
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:40,069
POLLSTER WHO COULD GO DOWN THERE
AND DO SOME POLLING.

23
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,069
I THINK YOU

24
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,189
WILL SEE PEOPLE BEING LIKE, I
CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS GUY, AND

25
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,632
RESPECTABLE REPUBLICANS AND
INDEPENDENTS IN ALABAMA WILL SAY

26
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:52,279
I WILL EITHER STAY AT HOME AND
NOT VOTE AT ALL BECAUSE I WON'T

27
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:57,229
VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT, OR I WILL
VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT AND VOTE FOR

28
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,229
DOUG JONES.

29
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,789
>>OR POTENTIALLY WRITE SOMEONE
IN.

30
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,530
>>JUST DON'T VOTE FOR THIS GUY.

31
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,399
>>I LIKE YOUR OPTIMISM, I KNOW
JAYAR ON THE SHOW YESTERDAY SAID

32
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,340
HE THOUGHT MOORE WOULD CLIMB IN
THE POLLS AFTER THIS, I DON'T

33
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,470
THINK I AGREE WITH THAT BUT BUT
I WORRY THAT IN ONE WEEK WILL WE

34
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,300
SEE A POLL WERE DOUG JONES IS UP
BY TWO POINTS?

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
A LOT OF PEOPLE

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,610
IN THIS COUNTRY HATE THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY SO MUCH THAT

37
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:31,050
THEY MIGHT VOTE FOR SOMEONE EVEN
IF THEY THINK HE'S A PEDOPHILE.

38
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,930
>>MAYBE I HAVE MORE FAITH IN
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT

39
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,420
THEY WILL BE LIKE, THERE'S NO
WAY WE CAN VOTE FOR A PEDOPHILE.

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,750
>>I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,840
>>MY THOUGHT IS NO FATHER OUT
THERE WHO HAS A DAUGHTER COULD

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
VOTE FOR THIS MAN.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,870
>>NO, ALMOST EVERY REPUBLICAN IN
ALABAMA.

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,090
I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH

45
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,090
YOU.

46
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,370
>>REPUBLICANS IN ALABAMA, PLEASE
PROVE ME RIGHT AND PROVE CENK

47
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,480
WRONG.

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,780
>>I LOVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE, IT'S
IMPORTANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,780
PERSPECTIVES.

50
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,350
MY PERSPECTIVE IS
REPUBLICANS DON'T CARE ABOUT

51
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,670
FAMILY VALUE AT ALL, THE PEOPLE
WHO CARE ABOUT FAMILY VALUES THE

52
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,360
LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FOX
NEWS VIEWERS.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,130
THIS GUY IN

54
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:20,951
TENNESSEE, A PRO-LIFE
REPUBLICAN, THREE ABORTIONS, HE

55
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:25,110
SAID I HAD TO BECAUSE I HAD A
MISTRESS -- ACCORDING TO NOT MY

56
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,500
LANGUAGE, YOUR LANGUAGE, FOX
NEWS AND REPUBLICANS IN ALABAMA

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,140
AND TENNESSEE, HE MURDERED THOSE
THREE KIDS BECAUSE IT WAS

58
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,030
CONVENIENT FOR HIM, BUT YOU
DIDN'T CARE.

59
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,680
YOU REELECTED HIM.

60
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,780
TRUMP MOLESTED THOSE WOMEN, IT'S
ON TAPE, HE SAID YOU GRAB THEM

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,670
BY THE GENITALS, YOU NOT ASK FOR
PERMISSION -- YOU DIDN'T CARE.

62
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,190
YOU SHOWED TIME AND TIME AGAIN,
ALL YOUR TALK ABOUT FAMILY

63
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,550
VALUES IS A GARGANTUAN LIE.

64
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,810
AS
LONG AS IT'S A REPUBLICAN WHO

65
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,870
HATES THE SAME PEOPLE YOU HATE,
YOU DON'T CARE THAT HE MOLESTS

66
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,660
14-YEAR-OLDS OR SEXUALLY
ASSAULTS PEOPLE, YOU DON'T CARE

67
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,220
HOW MANY ABORTIONS HE HAD WITH
HIS MISTRESS OR HIS WIFE, OR AS

68
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,380
YOU WOULD PUT IT THE BABIES HE
MURDERED.

69
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,250
YOU DON'T CARE, JUST

70
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,250
ADMIT IT.

71
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,750
SAY ROY MOORE HATES
THE SAME PEOPLE I DO, I'LL VOTE

72
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,959
FOR HIM NO MATTER WHAT.

73
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,310
I WOULD
BE SHOCKED IF ALL THE DEFENCES

74
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,130
THAT RIGHT NOW ALABAMA
REPUBLICANS AND FOX NEWS ARE

75
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,840
DOING WOULDN'T WORK, I THINK HE
MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,430
OF WINNING RIGHT NOW.

77
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,569
>>COME ON.

78
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,180
>>ALABAMA REPUBLICANS HAVE ZERO
INTEREST IN MORALITY.

79
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,080
>>PROVE HIM WRONG AND PROVE ME
RIGHT.

80
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,499
>>ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES OF CENK
GOING AWAY FOR A WEEK AS HE

81
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,029
COMES BACK TIRED --

82
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:45,000
>>LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT
REPUBLICANS IN ALABAMA.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
STATE

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,561
REPRESENTATIVE ED HENRY SAYS
THESE GIRLS, NOT WOMEN, WERE

85
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:53,990
FOOLISH FOR COMING FORWARD AND
THEY WOULD REGRET GOING DOWN

86
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,990
THIS ROAD.

87
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,620
THEN HE WONDERED, WHY
DIDN'T THEY COME OUT EARLIER?

88
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU JUST
THREATENED THEM BY SAYING YOU

89
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,080
WILL REGRET COMING DOWN THIS
ROAD.

90
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
HE SAID THEY SHOULD BE

91
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
PROSECUTED.

92
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,749
AND HE SAID THEY ARE
GUILTY FOR ALLOWING HIM TO EXIST

93
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:11,759
FOR 40 YEARS.

94
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,879
HE'S NOT GUILTY
FOR MOLESTING THE 14-YEAR-OLD,

95
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,129
THEY ARE GUILTY FOR GETTING
MOLESTED.

96
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:17,520
ALABAMA REPUBLICANS

97
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,229
DON'T CARE ABOUT MORALITY, THEY
THINK MORALITY IS A PUNCHLINE, A

98
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:23,699
POLITICAL GIMMICK.

99
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,229
THAT IS
ALABAMA REPUBLICAN STATE

100
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,529
REPRESENTATIVE ED HENRY.

101
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:29,240
THE
STATE AUDITOR SAID EVEN IF YOU

102
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,229
ACCEPT THE WASHINGTON POST
REPORT AS BEING TRUE, IT'S MUCH

103
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,779
ADO ABOUT VERY LITTLE.

104
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,659
THIS IS
ASSUMING, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN

105
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:42,539
WORDS, THAT MOORE GOT NAKED IN
HIS MID-30S WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD,

106
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,819
STRIPPED HER TO HER UNDERWEAR
AND FONDLED HER.

107
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:45,819
MUCH ADO ABOUT

108
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:46,819
VERY LITTLE.

109
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,120
IT'S SOMETHING
ALABAMA REPUBLICANS ACCORDING TO

110
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,110
THEIR OWN WORDS THINK IS NO BIG
DEAL.

111
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,449
HE SAID MOORE MARRIED

112
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,960
SOMEONE 14 YEARS YOUNGER AND
IT'S FINE, HE HAPPENED TO DATE

113
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,470
TEENAGE GIRLS IN HIS 30S, WHAT'S
THE BIG DEAL?

114
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,820
THESE ARE QUOTES.

115
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,259
HE SAID MARY WAS A TEENAGER,
JOSEPH WAS AN ADULT CARPENTER,

116
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:09,249
THEY BECAME PARENTS OF JESUS,
THERE'S NOTHING IMMORAL OR

117
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,550
ILLEGAL HERE.

118
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,120
SO ALABAMA
REPUBLICANS THINK CHILD

119
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,770
MOLESTATION OF 14-YEAR-OLDS IS
NO BIG DEAL.

120
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,020
YOU THINK THESE

121
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,050
GUYS WILL BE THROWN OUT OF
OFFICE FOR SAYING PEDOPHILIA IS

122
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,240
AWESOME AND BIBLICAL?

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,740
NO, HE
WILL GET REELECTED.

124
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,339
THEY DON'T

125
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,249
CARE, THEY'VE NEVER CARED.

126
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,110
IN
FACT THEY MIGHT RALLY TO HIM AND

127
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:53,770
GO, GOOD QUESTION, MOLESTING A
14-YEAR-OLD AND NOW HE'S IN

128
00:06:53,770 --> 00:00:00,000
TROUBLE.
