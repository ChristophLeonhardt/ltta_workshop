day6 20 of the Trump administration and there are new and potentially damaging revelations about Supreme Court nominee federal judge Brett Kavanaugh many of them still rolling out tonight even as the president defended his nominee tonight before a rally in Tennessee they've been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced he's a good man great student great intellect never had a problem all of a sudden no let's go back to high school they maybe should go before high school there is new reporting out tonight from the New York Times and Bloomberg it says Cavanaugh was involved in a bar fight in New Haven Connecticut back in 1985 while a junior at Yale The Times ads the Kavanagh had been questioned about it by New Haven police Cavanaugh's former classmate at Yale Chad Ludington spoke to Bloomberg about that fight yesterday he released a statement describing Kavanagh as quote belligerent and aggressive after drinking here is what Kavanagh said to the committee about his drinking last week I drank beer with my friends almost everyone did sometimes I had too many beers but I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out earlier this evening his former classmate offered a different assessment I can unequivocally say that in denying the possibility that he ever blacked out from drinking and in downplaying the degree and frequency of his drinking Brett has not told the truth I felt it was my civic duty to tell of my experience while drinking with Brett Chad Ludington went on to say much more he said he's already been in touch with the FBI about Kavanagh this morning president Trump was asked about the conflicting accounts of Cavanaugh's drinking there are now concerns that he may have lied or mischaracterized his drinking while testifying if they find that he did do you think that bars him from being your Supreme Court nominee well I've watched I watched him I was surprised at how vocal II was about the fact that he likes beer and he's had a little bit of Gault II I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this is not a man that said that alcohol was absent that he was perfect with respect to alcohol please note there the president did not quote Cavanaugh accurately and went further than Cavanaugh did in his own sworn testimony tonight there are also new questions concerning Cavanaugh and his second accuser Debra Ramirez she has alleged Kavanaugh exposed himself to her while they were both at a party at Yale something he denies NBC News reports tonight that before Ramirez went public with her allegation published in The New Yorker quote the judge and his team were communicating behind the scenes with friends to refute the claim according to text messages obtained by NBC News those texts sent between two of Cavanaugh's friends suggest quote that the nominee was personally talking with former classmates about Ramirez story in advance of the New Yorker article that made her allegation public that is critically important because Cavanaugh said under questioning and under oath that he learned about the Ramirez allegation only when it was published in The New Yorker NBC News has confirmed that the FBI has spoken to Ramirez and the lawyer for Cavanaugh's high school friend mark judge says he has also spoken with the FBI but that his interview has not been completed as of yet last Thursday the first accuser dr. Christine Blasi Ford testified judge was the one in the room during Cavanaugh's alleged assault during a house party Ford's friend Leland Kaiser who was said to be at that party has also taken part in an FBI interview according to her attorney there has been much debate over the scope of this investigation and Democrats say they worried Republicans may try to rein in the bureau's agents on this today the White House signed off on the bureau expanding its inquiry beyond that set set of witnesses offering the agency to follow any leads they wish while still maintaining the same Friday deadline I think the FBI should do they have to do to get to the answer I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation whatever that means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I want them to do that now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly today Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was determined to signal full steam ahead if you listen carefully mr. president you can practically hear the sounds of the Democrats moving the goalposts the time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close judge Cavanaugh's nomination is out of committee we're considering it here on the floor and mr. president we'll be voting this week with that let's bring in our leadoff panel on a Monday night Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for the New York Times Shawn Henry former executive assistant director at the FBI and Mimi Roca former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York now a distinguished fellow in criminal justice at Pace University's Law School good evening and welcome to you all Peter you shared the byline breaking the news today that the White House I'll say this it had the air of a White House relenting in expanding the reach and scope of the FBI investigation you have also written about the fact that it's not without its risk well that's exactly right the White House passed along the list that Senate Republicans it gave them witnesses they wanted the FBI to interview it was only for names of course Rebecca Ramirez who was the second accuser after Christine Blasi Ford and the three people that Christine Blasi Ford's say were in the house when her incident happened in the early 1980s and that was it that was what the FBI was told to do and when that got out that caused a lot of consternation among Democrats but also among the handful of Senate Republicans including Jeff Flake who had been concerned about this nomination now for weeks Jeff Flake and Chris Coons a Democrat from Delaware whose work with him to initiate this investigation got in touch with the White House I made clear this wasn't acceptable to them the president saw these stories and obviously decided as well that it didn't look good anyway if it was seemed to be so restricted that it wasn't a serious investigation they'd only generate more problems among the Republicans that are trying to recruit over to judge Cavanaugh he went ahead and gave Tom McGann the quite House Counsel instruction to tell the FBI to go ahead and follow their leads interview anybody they thought they needed an interview as long as was done this week Sean Henry I need not tell you the FBI is not autonomous and they hate being the story which is what they have not liked thus far about this administration but what I mean by that is they receive orders and follow them are you convinced that agents in field offices feel they have received their orders and in living rooms around the country tonight where appropriate there are agents sitting this close asking people potential witnesses in this story for their testimony I have no doubt they're there working around the clock now interviewing people taking the results of those interviews chronicling them that information is going through the Department of Justice and to the White House so the FBI is not going to wait a week to prepare a report and then send it they're getting the results of these investigations these interviews contemporaneously they're being submitted so there may be direction and guidance coming from the Department of Justice and ultimately from the White House so while I believe that they'll have the opportunity to conduct their investigation the parameters may change as the information goes back in into the White House through the Department of Justice so somewhere tell me there is a whiteboard and a map of the nation and there's a red pin on New Haven Connecticut where field agents are at Yale looking into all things in the vicinity there's a red pin in Bethesda Maryland and the environs there's a red pin for dr. Blasi Ford in California where presumably they are re-interviewing her and that kind of thing imagine this is being worked out of FBI headquarters as a central nucleus for this and there are leads that are being cast throughout the United States when results of interviews come back if the agents have the authority and the opportunity to continue to follow those leads logically as they would take them to try and get to the bottom of this answer all the questions then additional leads will go out and other agents will be dispatched to follow up on those on those interviews would you be interested in a bar fight in the 80s with that / cure you know I think that it's important what happened as to somebody in their teens in high school or in college isolated incidents in and of themselves are other types of things that are looked at but then overlooked if they're isolated I think the bigger issue here is a pattern of conduct and if in fact it continues decades into the future into the present time the other piece is there's the credibility and the suitability of the candidate to sit on the bench and if in fact the candidate made statements under oath to the Senate and they were Miss statements or if he had perjured himself those are the types of issues that agents will Chronicle they're going to follow and they're going to present them for it that's exactly where I'm going to go with our wise in-house counsel tonight so Mimi this NBC news story that let's call it a campaign small C of text messages we're going out to old friends to say listen there's something coming out please backup our guy the story I think in part alleges that some of them may have come from Cavanaugh a 2-tiered question for you is there anything illegal if I'm coming up on a big moment in my hearings and I get wind of something bad coming second is it really bad that this federal judge is already sworn just saying he didn't see the allegation we're talking about until it came out in The New Yorker and we all read it right so the first question is it could be illegal if Cavanaugh and his team got word that Ramirez's allegations were coming out which is what sounds like happened and Cavanaugh himself reached out to people to say hey you know it would this is not unlike things we talked about with Trump before yeah and and you know it's how close did he come to helping them refresh their memory he shouldn't have reached out directly he should have left that to his legal team that would be extraordinary for a sitting federal judge it would but it sounds like that might have happened that he might have reached out directly I mean we're based on the reporting it says that her text referred to Brett reaching out to her so I mean look we don't know for sure but that's something that needs to be looked into because if he did that's highly highly inappropriate and could border on illegal even his team doing that I mean it depends what they said if they were simply asking questions what do you remember you know there are perfectly legitimate ways to do it if they were pressuring people in any way if they were trying to refresh their memories or get their story straight that's a big no-no to put it simply and the allegation comes out in the New Yorker he says that's when he first learned about it but any of these texts would put that in doubt it would I mean again it sounds like you know we're hearing this from someone who has the text this is why this investigation is so important and someone needs to really speak directly to the person who has the text which it sounds like they've been trying to reach the FBI and it hasn't happened yet so that's a little troubling and my guess is that that might be because of limits that were put on the FBI initially so now hopefully they'll be free to talk to these witnesses directly but yes if he you know did know about this ahead of time but testified that he didn't know about it until the time of the New Yorker look that's definitely not true could you prove a perjury case based on that I wouldn't want to bring that case but that's not the standard here the standard is as we've all been saying is this a person who is being forthright and honest and should be on the Supreme Court and I think the growing impression over and over is that he was not completely forthright in his testimony hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
