>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 
MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO AND FOUNDER
OF FACEBOOK, IS ABOUT TO APPEAR 
ON CAPITOL HILL IN THE WAKE OF 
THAT PRIVACY SCANDAL FLOWING 
FROM THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.
YOU SEE HIM RIGHT THERE AS HE 
ENTERED THE SENATE JUDICIARY AND
COMMERCE HEARING ROOM.
THE SCANDAL WAS ON THE PERSONAL 
INFORMATION OF 87 MILLION 
FACEBOOK USERS WAS IMPROPERLY 
TAKEN FROM THE COMPANY WORKING 
FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA.
THERE'S A JOINT COMMITTEE 
HEARING, 44 SENATORS IN 
ATTENDANCE.
THERE'S MR. ZUCKERBERG, HIS 
FIRST APPEARANCE ON CAPITOL 
HILL, ONE HE HAS PRACTICED FOR 
AND ONE WHERE THERE IS A LOT ON 
THE LINE.
I WANT TO WRING IN OUR 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, 
MARY BRUCE.
MARY, THIS IS HIS FIRST 
APPEARANCE ON CAPITOL HILL AND 
HE'S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO TO FEND
OFF NEW REGULATIONS. 
>> Reporter: GEORGE, THIS IS 
MARK ZUCKERBERG'S FIRST 
APPEARANCE BEFORE A 
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE AND THE 
STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER FOR 
FACEBOOK AND THE TECH WORLD AT 
LARGE.
HE IS ABOUT TO BE QUESTIONED BY 
NEARLY HALF THE U.S. SENATE AND 
THEY'RE LIKELY TO GRILL HIM ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ABOUT 
USER PRIVACY, ABOUT RUSSIAN 
MEDDLING IN THE U.S. ELECTION 
AND ABOUT HIS PLAN TO PROTECT 
YOUR DATA GOING FORWARD.
ZUCKERBERG WE KNOW COMES ARMED 
WITH AN APOLOGY.
HE'S GOING TO TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY, ADMIT THAT HE 
MADE MISTAKES AND TRY TO 
CONVINCE CONGRESS THAT HIS 
COMPANY CAN BE TRUSTED, BUT 
GEORGE, THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH 
FOR LAWMAKERS.
MANY WE'VE TALKED WITH ARE 
DEMANDING MORE ROBUST OVERSIGHT 
AND TODAY THEY WANT TO KNOW IF 
MARK ZUCKERBERG IS GOING TO GET 
ON BOARD. 
>> MARY, OPENING STATEMENTS ON 
THE COMMITTEE WRAPPING UP RIGHT 
NOW.
SENATOR BILL NELSON FROM 
FLORIDA, DEMOCRAT FROM FLORIDA, 
SPEAKING RIGHT NOW AS ZUCKERBERG
IS WAITING PATIENTLY THERE FOR 
THAT TO END.
WE'RE TOLD HE'S GOING TO HAVE AN
OPENING STATEMENT, ABOUT FIVE, 
FIVE OR SEVEN MINUTES LONG, AND 
THEN TAKE QUESTIONS FROM ALL 44 
SENATORS IN ATTENDANCE.
HE'S FLANKED BY HIS DEPUTIES WHO
WORKED FOR GEORGE W. BUSH.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM 
MARK ZUCKERBERG. 
>> FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF FACEBOOK.
MR. ZUCKERBERG LAUNCHED FACEBOOK
FEBRUARY 4, 2004 AT THE AGE OF 
19.
AT THAT TIME HE WAS A STUDENT AT
HARVARD UNIVERSITY.
AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, HIS 
COMPANY NOW HAS OVER $40 BILLION
OF ANNUAL REVENUE AND OVER $2 
BILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS.
MR. ZUCKERBERG, ALONG WITH HIS 
WIFE, ALSO ESTABLISHED THE 
CHAN-ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE TO 
FURTHER PHILANTHROPIC CAUSES.
I NOW TURN TO YOU.
WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE AND 
WHATEVER YOUR STATEMENT IS 
ORALLY, IF YOU HAVE A LONGER 
ONE, IT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE 
RECORD.
SO PROCEED, SIR.
>> CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY, CHAIRMAN 
THUNE, RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN 
AND RANKING MEMBER NELSON AND 
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, WE 
FACE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT 
ISSUES AROUND PRIVACY, SAFETY 
AND DEMOCRACY.
AND YOU'LL RIGHTFULLY HAVE SOME 
HARD QUESTIONS FOR ME TO ANSWER.
BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE STEPS 
WE'RE TAKING TO ADDRESS THEM, I 
WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT 
HERE.
FACEBOOK IS AN IDEALISTIC AND 
OPTIMISTIC COMPANY.
FOR MOST OF OUR EXISTENCE, WE 
FOCUSED ON ALL OF THE GOOD THAT 
CONNECTING PEOPLE CAN DO.
AS FACEBOOK HAS GROWN, PEOPLE 
EVERYWHERE HAVE GOTTEN A 
POWERFUL NEW TOOL FOR STAYING 
CONNECTED TO THE PEOPLE THEY 
LOVE, FOR MAKING THEIR VOICES 
HEARD, AND FOR BUILDING 
COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES.
JUST RECENTLY, WE'VE SEEN THE ME
TOO MOVEMENT AND THE MARCH FOR 
OUR LIVES ORGANIZED AT LEAST IN 
PART ON FACEBOOK.
AFTER HURRICANE HARVEY, PEOPLE 
CAME TOGETHER TO RAISE MORE THAN
$20 MILLION FOR RELIEF, AND MORE
THAN 70 MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES
USE FACEBOOK TO CREATE JOBS AND 
GROW.
BUT IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT WE 
DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO PREVENT 
THESE TOOLS FROM BEING USED FOR 
HARM AS WELL, AND THAT FWGOES F 
FAKE NEWS, FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 
IN ELECTIONS AND HATE SPEECH, AS
WELL AS DEVELOPERS AND DATA 
PRIVACY.
WE DIDN'T TAKE A BROAD ENOUGH 
VIEW OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY, AND 
THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.
IT WAS MY MISTAKE AND I'M SORRY.
I STARTED FACEBOOK.
I RUN IT.
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 
HAPPENS HERE.
SO NOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL
OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING 
A BROAD ENOUGH VIEW OF OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST CONNECT 
PEOPLE.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE 
CONNECTIONS ARE POSITIVE.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST GIVE 
PEOPLE A VOICE.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE
AREN'T USING IT TO HARM OTHER 
PEOPLE OR TO SPREAD 
MISINFORMATION.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST GIVE 
PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THEIR 
INFORMATION.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
DEVELOPERS THEY SHARE IT WITH 
PROTECT THEIR INFORMATION TOO.
ACROSS THE BOARD WE HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT JUST BUILD
TOOLS BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THEY'RE USED FOR GOOD.
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO WORK 
THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES WE NEED 
TO MAKE ACROSS THE COMPANY, BUT 
I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING THIS 
RIGHT.
THIS INCLUDES THE BASIC 
RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING 
PEOPLE'S INFORMATION WHICH WE 
FAILED TO DO WITH CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA.
SO, HERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT 
WE ARE DOING TO ADDRESS THIS AND
TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING 
AGAIN.
FIRST, WE'RE GETTING TO THE 
BOTTOM OF EXACTLY WHAT CAMBRIDGE
ANALYTICA DID AND TELLING 
EVERYONE AFFECTED.
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THAT 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA IMPROPERLY 
ACCESSED SOME INFORMATION ABOUT 
MILLIONS OF FACEBOOK MEMBERS BY 
BUYING IT FROM AN APP DEVELOPER.
THAT INFORMATION -- THIS WAS 
INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE 
GENERALLY SHARE PUBLICLY ON 
THEIR FACEBOOK PAGES, LIKE NAMES
AND THEIR PROFILE PICTURE AND 
THE PAGES THEY FOLLOW.
WHEN WE FIRST CONTACTED 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, THEY TOLD 
US THAT THEY HAD DELETED THE 
DATA.
ABOUT A MONTH AGO WE HEARD NEW 
REPORTS THAT SUGGESTED THAT 
WASN'T TRUE.
AND NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH 
GOVERNMENTS IN THE U.S., THE 
U.K. AND AROUND THE WORLD TO DO 
A FULL AUDIT OF WHAT THEY'VE 
DONE AND TO MAKE SURE THEY GET 
RID OF ANY DATA THEY MAY STILL 
HAVE.
SECOND, TO MAKE SURE NO OTHER 
APP DEVELOPERS OUT THERE ARE 
MISUSING DATA, WE'RE NOW 
INVESTIGATING EVERY SINGLE APP 
THAT HAD ACCESS TO A LARGE 
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE 
PAST.
IF WE FIND THAT SOMEONE 
IMPROPERLY USED DATA, WE'RE 
GOING TO BAN THEM FROM FACEBOOK 
AND TELL EVERYONE EFFECTED.
THIRD, TO PREVENT THIS FROM EVER
HAPPENING AGAIN GOING FORWARD, 
WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT 
DEVELOPERS CAN'T ACCESS AS MUCH 
INFORMATION NOW.
THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT WE 
ALREADY MADE BIG CHANGES TO OUR 
PLATFORM IN 2014 THAT WOULD HAVE
PREVENTED THIS SPECIFIC 
SITUATION WITH CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA FROM OCCURRING AGAIN 
TODAY.
BUT THERE'S MORE TO DO AND YOU 
CAN FIND MORE DETAILS ON THE 
STEPS WE'RE TAKING IN MY WRITTEN
STATEMENT.
MY TOP PRIORITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
OUR SOCIAL MISSION OF CONNECTING
PEOPLE, BUILDING COMMUNITY, AND 
BRINGING THE WORLD CLOSER 
TOGETHER.
ADVERTISERS AND DEVELOPERS WILL 
NEVER TAKE PRIORITY OVER THAT AS
LONG AS I'M RUNNING FACEBOOK.
I STARTED FACEBOOK WHEN I WAS IN
COLLEGE.
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE 
THEN.
WE NOW SERVE MORE THAN 2 BILLION
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, AND 
EVERY DAY PEOPLE USE OUR 
SERVICES TO STAY CONNECTED WITH 
THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER TO THEM 
MOST.
I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN WHAT WE'RE 
DOING AND I KNOW THAT WHEN WE 
ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES WE'LL 
LOOK BACK AND VIEW HELPING 
PEOPLE CONNECT AND GIVING MORE 
PEOPLE A VOICE AS A POSITIVE 
FORCE IN THE WORLD.
I REALIZE THE ISSUES WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT TODAY AREN'T JUST 
ISSUES FOR FACEBOOK AND OUR 
COMMUNITY, THEY'RE ISSUES AND 
CHALLENGES FOR ALL OF US AS 
AMERICANS.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE 
TODAY, AND I'M READY TO TAKE 
YOUR QUESTIONS.
>>> STREAMLINED STATEMENT THERE 
FROM FACEBOOK CEO MARK 
ZUCKERBERG, TAKING 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT WENT 
WRONG DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, 
SAYING HE FOUNDED THE COMPANY, 
IT WAS HIS MISTAKE AND HE'S GOT 
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX IT.
HE'S GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS 
NOW.
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FROM EACH 
SENATOR ON THE PODIUM.
SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY, THE 
CHAIRMAN, NOW SPEAKING. 
>> WITH YOU, FACEBOOK HANDLES 
EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL 
DATA FOR BILLIONS OF USERS.
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THAT 
DATA IS SHARED WITH THIRD PARTY 
DEVELOPERS WHO UTILIZE YOUR 
PLATFORM.
AS OF THIS -- EARLY THIS YEAR, 
YOU DID NOT ACTIVELY MONITOR 
WHETHER THAT DATA WAS 
TRANSFERRED BY SUCH DEVELOPERS 
TO OTHER PARTIES.
MOREOVER, YOUR POLICIES ONLY 
PROHIBIT TRANSFERS BY DEVELOPERS
TO PARTIES SEEKING TO PROFIT 
FROM SUCH DATA.
NUMBER ONE, BESIDES PROFESSOR 
COGAN'S TRANSFER AND NOW 
POTENTIALLY CUBEYOU, DO YOU KNOW
OF ANY INSTANCES WHERE USER DATA
WAS IMPROPERLY
IF WE FIND ANY SUSPICIOUS 
ACTIVITY, WE'RE GOING TO CONDUCT
A FULL AUDIT OF THOSE APPS TOO
ENFORCED OUR 
>> THE BUCK TSTOPS WITH HIM.
THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY 
CHANGES, WHAT KINDS OF CHANGES.
AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER, 
CONGRESS IS REALLY LOOKING TO 
MAKE LARGER, MORE ROBUST CHANGES
WHEN IT COMES TO OVERSIGHT.
WHETHER THAT'S POLITICALLY 
FEASIBLE IN THIS CLIMATE REMAINS
TO BE SEEN BUT THAT IS GOING TO 
BE AT THE CRUX OF SO MUCH OF THE
QUESTIONING HERE TODAY.
JUST HOW FAR IS MARK 
ZUCKERBERG -- 
>> PREPARED TO QUESTION MARK 
ZUCKERBERG.
OKAY, MARY, THANKS VERY MUCH.

HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON.
