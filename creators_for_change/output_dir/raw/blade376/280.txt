<font color="#E5E5E5">ago I wouldn't have the confidence to</font>

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,930
just stand here and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a camera</font>

58
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,970

103
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,889
internet thinking it's an insecure form

104
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,380
of communication in which it's just for

105
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,389
the pedophiles and people who are you

106
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,850
they say they are but in fact it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

107
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way media does it I mean it's friend</font>

108
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,470
buy it because you have newspapers and

109
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,680
TV and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> second petition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

110
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,580
is an honest<font color="#CCCCCC"> form in which people can</font>

111
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,160
just express themselves as a site is no

112
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,199
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> assuming there is negative clever</font>

113
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,599
way to say or else it doesn't fit to

114
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">attention conditions and they can remove</font>

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">it but on the whole you do have exposure</font>

116
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:22,210
and I said to have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past year i've</font>

117
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,900
had over 15 million views which is a lot

118
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,639
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know for a lot of other people</font>

119
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,220
they've got a lot more I've going two

120
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,340
hundred videos and it's just I'm just

121
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,289
trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn how to put it it's just</font>

122
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,510
the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you do begins like</font>

123
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,789
this you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> transfer in camera you</font>

124
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,500
don't know who's on the other end and

125
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,320
then

126
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,410
go to the camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just allow emotion</font>

127
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,030
and you just honest of it because you've

128
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,200
got no one interrupting your

129
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,430
conversation you've got no more

130
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,320
questioning what you're doing and when

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,820
you put the video up there it's too<font color="#CCCCCC"> late</font>

132
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,340
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice up there now and I've</font>

133
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">got videos in the past which of course</font>

134
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,010
controversy and it's gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> up your paper</font>

135
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">mission but you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning like that</font>

136
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,100
it was a quote you can place some people

137
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,180
some of the time but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't please</font>

138
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,550
all people all the time and I think

139
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's very true so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get out</font>

140
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,370
I mean was it's relevant for today I

141
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,900
mean I try carve a few points hopefully

142
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,050
they're valid communication skills as I

143
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,610
said I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a lecture before I</font>

144
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,170
think we've been doing anything like

145
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> studied public speaking I'm a</font>

146
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,000
secondary school Oh two years ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,470
was rubbish<font color="#CCCCCC"> today at the time and I</font>

148
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,120
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> with communication skills when you</font>

149
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,800
do a video you're sure you can edit it I

150
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,270
mean if you are now you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> college</font>

151
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,870
itself but if you just lie the time

152
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,340
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start trying all the</font>

153
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,870
stuff you find that you do come all

154
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,340
