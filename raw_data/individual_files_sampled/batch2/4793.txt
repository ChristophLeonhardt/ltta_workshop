Michael would represent me and represent me on some things he represents me like with this crazy stormy Daniels deal he represented me during the discussion now Michael avenatti the attorney for stormy Daniels and Jill wine banks former assistant Watergate special prosecutor in an MSNBC contributor and Michael in the courtroom today were you surprised to see the prosecutors pounced on that Fox and Friends appearance as quickly as as you did with their inserting in their pleading today that the president just said that Michael Cohen that doesn't tiny amount of the president's legal work and therefore there's very little attorney-client privilege sure no Lawrence I wasn't surprised I mean this is a you know as a two-way gift for both them and us it it came out of nowhere I mean if we scripted this Lawrence we could not have scripted it better if the president is watching please call in the Fox and Friends tomorrow and every day next week please whatever you do and please speak about our case in stormy Daniels please mr. president thank you this was by the way the very first day the words stormy Daniels past the lips of the President of the United States while President well correct I mean they passed his lips many many times prior to this but yes you're correct since since he's become president Lawrence look I can't emphasize enough you literally could not script this out any better for us that the president and Michael Cohen every trap we lay they they step in it he is the president is undisciplined he shoots off-the-cuff he says whatever comes to mind and that may work in a political campaign but it is a unmitigated disaster as it relates to being a litigant in a case like this he's got you have two answers now about the president's involvement in this case you have an Air Force one answer in which he says I knew nothing about it you have Michael Cohen in the past publicly saying in the press the president do nothing about it I took care of it without the president knowing now you have the president today saying he represented me past-tense he says with this crazy stormy Daniels deal he represented me that sounds like he was aware that Michael Cohen was representing him in those discussions that created that that's agreement in the first place which one do you like better which one do you which one helps your case better which one do you want to be true that the president knew nothing about it therefore there is no agreement or the president says that Michael Cohen did represent them in that case well the beautiful part of this Lawrence is is that this this is a buffet it's not ala carte menu okay okay so we don't have to pick one we get to pick both alright and and not only did he say if you really look at what he said not only did he say he represented me but then he actually doubled down and said he represents yes current tense yes so he was tightened it he tightened it up for us which I truly appreciate it by the way because that helps us even further in the case so we're gonna we're gonna see how this plays out Lawrence the beautiful part of this from my perspective is as you know we have a pending motion to take the deposition of the president what he did today adds considerable fuel to that fire for that deposition and why do I say that the reason why I say that is because now we have inconsistent statements we have Michael Cohen and what he said some time ago coupled with the statements by David Schwartz the guy that he trotted out for a couple weeks who now can only be found on milk cartons to explain them the Michael Cohen's position no I never drift through cable news shows yelling at you sometimes okay correct incorrect we and we've called around to local hospitals and he's not present there and I'm glad to hear that but he has disappeared we don't know what happened to him but separate apart from that we also have been the Air Force one comments on April 5 or six and now we have these comments and you cannot reconcile these three sets of comments all of which gives further credence to our motion we need to take his deposition we need to put him under oath we need to find out exactly what his position is about the agreement what he knew what he paid what do you Tim pay what he did about it all of these we're entitled of 7 hours I think to is going to be more than sufficient in fact if he does what he did this morning I think we could probably accomplish it in 20 minutes Juwan banks if you're asking to do a deposition on the president of United States and the president is claiming among other things this is an incredible burden on its time does it help your case with the judge when the president spends a half an hour on Fox and Friends talking about whatever goes through his mind including oh by the way your case it certainly doesn't help and I saw that interview and he was unraveling throughout it it was an incredible interview and Michael is quite correct that this will help in terms of getting a deposition because he has said inconsistent things now and there should be some obligation to answer to that it's really incredible to wonder what does the president actually believe does he believe the things he says and I recently had a conversation with a psychiatrist who was trying to explain to me the difference between someone who just plain out lies and someone who is delusional and actually believes what they are saying and his conclusion was that Trump must believe what he's saying because he says things that are so harmful to his self-interest that he couldn't possibly lie that way if he was being sensible so he must be delusional well he can't he can also be both Jill I want I want to get your reaction as a former federal prosecutor to the appointment of the Special Master today in the evidentiary case involving Michael Cohen I think it gives everybody what they need it will eliminate any objections to it being an unfair process I happen to be lucky enough to know judge Jones I worked with her in the Pentagon committee looking at sexual assault in the military and got to know her very well there she followed me in the organized crime section so I sort of share some background with her in terms of that prosecution she is an excellent choice they could not have done any better she will do a very excellent job Michael we learned a lot about what's actually what how the evidence is being physically conveyed Michael avenatti got a big collection of BlackBerry's and iPhones iPads electronic devices Michael Cohen has this big collection of these electronic devices that are now in the custody of the FBI that they're studying Lawrence by my count it's 16 phones and iPhones and blackberries 16 okay that's that's a big number I don't know how many old phones you have laying around your home I don't I don't have anywhere close to 16 but including blackberries and so my belief is that Michael Cohen may have 7 10 12 15 years worth of cell phones that have now been imaged by the FBI and what that means is unless he erased them forensic ly erased them and I doubt that he did what that means is is that every text message and every email and every data point on all of those cell phones is now in the possession of the FBI and we know according to what the president said on Fox and Friends I think he described the relationship is spanning 20 years so presumably the FBI has all of the communications between Michael Cohen and the president spanning 20 years okay that should send a chill down the spine of the president and Michael Cohen and it should also send a chill down the spine of anyone else that had any other dealings with Michael Cohen that were anything other than aboveboard because the FBI has it all and and that's why I used that phrase from Steve Doocy today we're running out of time that when I heard it it just felt like that is the story of where the president is now not just in the Fox News interview but there's a there's an evidentiary proceeding going on now now guided by a special master where they're digging into every one of Michael Cohen's phones that he's used the whole time he's known Donald Trump well and Lawrence I'll say this when I heard these reports that Michael Cohen had recorded his conversations with people I initially liked in so many instances in this case I thought that's not possible I mean clearly this guy has got to be smart right to actually do that and then save them electronically it's not possible and I can't tell you how many times I've said that in this case and I've been proven wrong actually the fact that he saved all these old cell phones I think at this point there's probably a little question that these recordings exist and if those recordings exist there is no finer piece of evidence other than a videotape there's no finer piece of evidence than an audio recording so if Michael Cohen took pleasure in recording his conversations with individuals where he threatened them intimidated them and engaged in anything that can be described as illegal conduct he's an even worse in worse position than I ever thought and I've always thought even a really really bad spot a quick question on the time table how long you think it'll take for the FBI to sort through all of this electronic evidence one of the devices mentioned in court today the prosecutors suggested just one of them might take 90 days the rest of them actually seemed like something they could do fairly quickly well downloading it isn't the problem it will be interpreting them and that will take a bit longer and I think that there's so much to be worried about here I don't think that it's the stormy Daniels payment that is going to bring down Cohn or the president because I think there's as Michael is suggesting that the evidence that has now been obtained will show business wrongdoing for many many years and much of that will be very serious threat to the career and future of both Michael Cohn and the president so I think there's a lot to be worried about well beyond the stormy Daniels amount chill wine banks thank you for joining
