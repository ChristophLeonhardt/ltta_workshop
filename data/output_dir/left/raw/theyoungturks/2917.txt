1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,600
>>AMERICAN AIRLINES IS
APOLOGIZING AFTER ONE OF ITS

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,820
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ESSENTIALLY
KICKED OFF TWO PRO BASKETBALL

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,990
PLAYERS FROM A FLIGHT AFTER
ACCUSING THEM OF STEALING

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,870
BLANKETS FROM FIRST-CLASS.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,290
THE
BASKETBALL PLAYERS ARE MARQUIS

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:21,330
TEAGUE AND ALSO TRAHSON BURRELL,
THEY ARE PLAYERS FOR A

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,359
BASKETBALL TEAM I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH, THEY ARE IN AN NBA G

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,470
LEAGUE, THEY ARE KNOWN AS THE
MEMPHIS HUSTLE.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,619
THEY WERE ON THE

10
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,260
FLIGHT, AND AS THEY WERE GOING
TO THEIR SEATS IN THE ECONOMY

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,430
AREA APPARENTLY SOMEONE IN FIRST
CLASS GAVE THEM THEIR BLANKETS.

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,950
AT THAT POINT A MALE FLIGHT
ATTENDANT, WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,289
BE BLACK, ACCUSED THEM OF
STEALING THE BLANKETS, AND THEN

14
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,230
AN ARGUMENT HAPPENED AND THE
FLIGHT ATTENDANT SAID HE WAS

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,739
UNCOMFORTABLE AND KICKED TO THE
TWO OFF THE FLIGHT.

16
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:54,739
>>I THINK HE LEFT.

17
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:55,739
>>NO, HE ACCUSED THE TWO MEN OF
THEFT AND FORCED THEM OFF THE

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:56,739
PLANE.

19
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:57,739
THE TWO PLAYERS WERE
FORCED OFF THE PLANE, AND LATER

20
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,320
APPARENTLY BECAUSE THIS STORY
BECAME A HUGE DEAL, THE AIRLINE

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,970
REALIZED THERE WAS A MISTAKE AND
THAT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY STEAL

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,930
ANY BLANKETS, AND THEY WERE
GIVEN TWO FIRST-CLASS SEATS ON A

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,580
DIFFERENT FLIGHT TO GET TO THEIR
DESTINATION.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,000
BUT LOOK, THE THING

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,090
I THOUGHT WAS REALLY INTERESTING
WAS THE IMMEDIATE ACCUSATION OF

26
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,300
THEFT.

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,180
WHY DID IT IMMEDIATELY GO
THERE?

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,180
I DON'T REALLY

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,530
UNDERSTAND.

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,420
FIRST OF ALL, SO
THEY HAVE SOME BLANKETS.

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,420
IF

32
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,500
SOMEONE IN FIRST CLASS GAVE THEM
THE BLANKETS THAT MEANS NO ONE

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,580
EVER COMPLAINED ABOUT BLANKETS
BEING STOLEN, YOU JUST SAW TWO

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,180
PEOPLE WITH FIRST-CLASS BLANKETS
AND IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED THEY

35
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,060
WERE STOLEN EVEN THOUGH NO ONE
COMPLAINED ABOUT ANYTHING.

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,060
WHO

37
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,060
CARES?

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,060
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE
DOING AS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT,

39
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,060
THAT'S WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT?

40
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,160
WHETHER THESE PEOPLE HAVE
BLANKETS?

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,780
>>TWO PARTS OF THE STORY GET
UNDER MY SKIN.

42
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,390
ONE OBVIOUSLY IS

43
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:28,180
THE AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION HERE.

44
00:02:28,180 --> 00:03:05,130
WE KNOW THERE ARE STEREOTYPES --

45
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:22,569
AND 

46
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,290
OF COURSE THE LAST PART, AS
ANA EXPLAINED TO ME, THEY GOT

47
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,230
THROWN OFF THE PLANE BECAUSE HE
FELT "UNSAFE."

48
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,030
GET OUTTA HERE.

49
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,470
YOU HAVE ULTIMATE POWER NOW IS A
FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

50
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,470
PEOPLE ABUSE

51
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,330
THAT POWER LEFT AND RIGHT.

52
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,670
I HAD
A SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT WITH YOU,

53
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,230
HA-HA, I WIN.

54
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,599
I HAD A FRIEND WHO
GOT THREATENED AT AN AIRPORT IN

55
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,790
VEGAS THAT THEY WOULD NEVER LET
HIM FLY AGAIN IF HE SPOKE UP

56
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,920
AGAINST THEM.

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,750
THEY CAN RUIN YOUR
LIFE, PUT YOU ON A NO-FLY LIST,

58
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,690
YOU CAN'T GIVE PEOPLE THAT KIND
OF POWER.

59
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,980
IT GOES TO THEIR HEAD

60
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,849
AND YOU GET STORIES LIKE THIS.

61
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:09,959
>>THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE IN
THE ECONOMY SECTION OF THE PLANE

62
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,310
IS WHAT REALLY GETS TO ME.

63
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,480
YES,
THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY STOLE

64
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,180
IS A HUGE PROBLEM, PROBABLY THE
NUMBER ONE PROBLEM IN THIS

65
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,988
STORY, BUT I JUST DON'T GET WHY
THAT STOOD OUT TO THE FLIGHT

66
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,289
ATTENDANT TO THE POINT WHERE HE
FELT I NEED TO CONFRONT THESE

67
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,020
PEOPLE BLANKETS.

68
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,150
THEY HAVE BLANKETS, NO ONE
COMPLAINED TO YOU ABOUT

69
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,460
ANYTHING, LET IT GO.

70
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,669
I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT ON THAT PLANE.

71
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,919
>>THIS IS AMERICAN AIRLINES
AGAIN, AMERICAN AIRLINES IN

72
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:45,569
OCTOBER HAD THE NAACP ISSUE A
TRAVEL ADVISORY AGAINST THEM

73
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:48,889
SAYING THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS
COULD FACE DISCRIMINATION IF

74
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,180
THEY FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES
BECAUSE OF REPEATED INCIDENTS

75
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,020
INCLUDING ONE INVOLVING AN
ORGANIZER OF THE WOMEN'S MARCH

76
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,889
WHO WAS BOOTED FROM A FLIGHT
AFTER A DISPUTE OVER HER SEAT.

77
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,020
SO FOR THE NAACP TO SAY WATCH
OUT FOR AN AIRLINE, THEY

78
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,620
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST BLACK
PEOPLE, I'M NOT SURE I'VE SEEN

79
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
THAT BEFORE.

80
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,460
IN THIS CASE IT'S TWO BLACK GUYS
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR

81
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,849
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WAS ALSO
BLACK SO THERE ARE A LOT OF

82
00:05:14,849 --> 00:00:00,000
FACTORS HERE.
