Oh then in a year that has seen Hillary Clinton try to explain away her failure to become the US president with a tell-all book she's now got American youth in her sights our Washington correspondent Samira Khan shares her thoughts upon that and that's exactly what Hillary Clinton's been doing since she lost the election searching for any way whatsoever to get back under the spotlight and when Teen Vogue invited her to guess at it it's a December issue what resulted was an ode to Hillary nevertheless we resist guest-edited by Hillary Rodham Clinton and it features no less than three essays written by various women on what exactly they learned from Hillary Clinton and as an American female I feel as though I've learned so much from her myself so here's my list number one it's perfectly okay to be totally hypocritical I believe that marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law number two deflect criticism by shaming anyone who criticizes you as sexist this is a man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs number three never take responsibility for your failures last but not least number four blame Russia for everything I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off the one thing that I would say that I've learned the most from Hillary would be to be as far away from her brand of politics and divisiveness as I can possibly be Hillary has spent an entire career trying to chop up what is the fabric of America by race by gender by religion by a political view by partisanship and she's divided America to such a point that America was almost unrecognisable another section contains advice for young woman in quotes from well you can guess who but too bad the issue doesn't include her best-known quotations you could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorable z' or this piece of humor to dodge a question on inspirationally wiping her email server before giving it to the FBI like with a cloth or something about down okay so it is vogue after all so here's your fashion advice from Hillary Clinton if I want to knock a story off the front page I just changed my hairstyle and here's chapter three a set of pictures of Hillary Clinton laughing but here's a special moment I think they missed we Came we saw he died so what's next after Teen Vogue well it seems Hillary might be marketing herself almost like she's going out of fashion I think that it is diminishing the intelligence of young women who want to have both sides or all sides presented to them and then to be able to be entrusted with the information to make an intelligent decision when you only present one side of an argument you say you send a message to teen girls we don't think you're smart enough to figure this out for yourself so we're going to tell you what you're going to think that's propaganda not free not free speech
