1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,442
This home has been empty for

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,277
the past six years.

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,920
it is in Namie, a small town

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,448
in Fukushima Prefecture,

5
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,183
where an earthquake and tsunami

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,785
triggered a nuclear meltdown

7
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,387
at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,322
power plant in 2011.

9
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,761
Pachinko parlors, popular

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,262
gambling sites in Tomioka,

11
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,064
another town evacuated because

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,665
of the high radiation levels,

13
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,167
have not yet been cleaned up

14
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,435
after the earthquake toppled

15
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,037
money buckets to the floor.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,709
We came upon this eerie scene

17
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,177
at an empty ramen restaurant,

18
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,678
where the dishes were left in

19
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,880
the sink and the menus are

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,181
strewn along the counter.

21
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,723
In a graveyard along the coast,

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,124
damage from the earthquake and

23
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,660
tsunami six years ago remains.

24
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:06,966
The plant and its surrounding

25
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,268
areas are the site of the

26
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,003
world's largest ongoing nuclear

27
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,071
waste cleanup.

28
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,706
Containing the radiated 
material is a

29
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,408
problem with no end in sight.

30
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,744
Thousands of bags of

31
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,345
contaminated soil are piled

32
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,047
high across the prefecture.

33
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,054
After being exposed 
to radiation,

34
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,422
fields were scraped

35
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,257
of their soil and trees cut at

36
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:31,891
the stump.

37
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,401
In the town of Namie,

38
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,936
not far from the plant,

39
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,938
this house is being demolished.

40
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,573
Its owners have decided to

41
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,674
>settle elsewhere.

42
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,676
The materials of the home

43
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,344
with risk of contamination,

44
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,046
are being packed 
into bags

45
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,348
and will be stored 
in yet another lot.

46
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,522
The government plans to lift

47
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,090
the evacuation order 
this spring.

48
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,826
A few residents plan 
to come back.

49
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,428
But many others,

50
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,163
including those with 
young children,

51
00:02:10,864 --> 00:00:00,000
will never return.
