AND ALWAYS WORKING TO BE BETTER.
ROB: IRAN DEAL NOW ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK AS PRESIDENT
TRUMP WILL DECIDE ITS FATE BY
THE END OF THIS WEEK.
JILLIAN: WE ARE NOW LEARNING
THAT JOHN KERRY HAS BEEN
SECRETLY MEETING WITH BOTH
IRANIAN AND EUROPEAN OFFICIALS
TO DISCUSS SAVING THE DEAL.
SO IS THIS THE REAL COLLUSION?
HERE THE WEIGH IN FORMER STATE
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL UNDER
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GEORGE W.
BUSH.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS
MORNING, WHAT DO YOU THINK, IS
JOHN KERRY UNDERMINING THE
PRESIDENT?
>> DEFINITELY IT IS.
THERE USED TO BE A SAYING SAYING
THERE USED TO BE A SAYING SAYINT
THERE USED TO BE A SAYING SAYINA
THERE USED TO BE A SAYING SAYINT
DIFFERENCES END AT THE WATER'S
EDGE, THAT'S GONE BY THE
WAYSIDE, JOHN KERRY, LEAVE IT TO
JOHN KERRY TO TAKE IT WHO -- TO
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL, SENIOR
DIPLOMAT AND ALSO MET WITH
GERMANSES AND THE FRENCH IN AN
EFFORT TO UNDERMINE THE
PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN POLICY.
ROB: HOW SHOULD THIS BE
RESPONDED AND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN
TO JOHN KERRY IN LIGHT OF THIS?
>> HE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED UNDER
THE LOGAN ACT, I DON'T
PARTICULARLY LIKE THE LAW.
IT WAS USE TODAY THREATEN PEOPLE
, BUT IF IT'S GOING TO BE
USED AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND IT
WAS CERTAINLY USED AGAINST MIKE
FLYNN TO CREATE ENTRAPMENT, IF
YOU WILL, IT'S A PRETTY PLAIN
THAT HE'S IN VIOLATION OF THE
ACT SO WHY NOT THROW IT AT HIM?
JILLIAN: PART OF LOGAN ACT, ANY
CITIZEN WITHOUT AUTHORITY OF THE
UNITED STATES DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY COMMENCES OR CARRIES
ON ANY CORRESPONDENCE WITH ANY
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT WITH INTENT
TO INFLUENCE THE MEASURES IN
RELATION TO TO ANY DISPUTES
SHOULD BE TITLED OR IMPRISONED,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> IT'S BEEN USED.
JOHN KERRY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING
TO TEST AGAINST HIMSELF AND I
DON'T THINK THE FOREIGN MINISTER
WILL.
IF CONGRESS DOESN'T LIKE IT,
THEY CAN REPEAL IT.
WE HAVE TO HAVE FAIRNESS.
THE LAWS HAVE TO APPLY TO
EVERYONE.
JILLIAN: RIGHT.
ROB: LET'S LISTEN TO CHAIRMAN OF
THE ARM FORCES COMMITTEE TALKING
ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION.
>> I'M NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED
TO STICKING WITH THE DEAL
FOREVER, YOU NEED TO HAVE CLEAR
IDEA OF NEXT STEPS, MAYBE THE
BEST THING FOR THE PRESIDENT TO
DELAY A BIT MORE THE DEADLINE OF
THIS MONTH AND PUT THE FRENCH
AND THE BRITISH UP TO THE TEST
ABOUT WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO
GET THIS OTHER SORT OF
AGREEMENT.
ROB: SO CHRISTIAN, HEARING HIS
SIDE, AND THAT WAS FROM
YESTERDAY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS
THING, I THINK WHAT IT IS IS
THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF THE
DIFFERENT VOICES SAYING, WE NEED
TO STAY IN THE DEAL, ALL OF
EUROPE, MOST DEMOCRATS, A LOT OF
REPUBLICANS TOO, WHAT BOTHERS
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WHAT I
THINK BOTHERS THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION, WE ENTER DEALS
AND WE NEGOTIATE WITH THE
HORRIBLE COUNTRIES THAT HATE US
AND WE TRY TO BASICALLY PAY THEM
TO PLAY NICE, I MEAN, THAT BOTHE
TO PLAY NICE, I MEAN, THAT BOTHS
PEOPLE.
>> RIGHT, AND THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE
IRANIAN REGIME IS ABOUT.
WE MAY HAVE IRANIAN MODERATES
THAT WE CAN REACH OUT TO BUT
IRANIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN AT
WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.
THE IDEA IS TO MOVE BEYOND THIS
APPEASEMENT PACT TO BE ABLE TO
PUT TOUGHER SANCTIONS ON IRAN IF
THEY DO VIOLATE, YOU KNOW, BUILD
UP A NUCLEAR ARSENAL OR DO OTHER
THINGS THAT ARE HARMFUL TO US.
SO ALSO, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT
WAS CLEAR, HE TOOK THE SIDE OF
THE IRANIANS WHO WERE IN THE
STREETS PROTESTING THE REGIME
AND SO THOSE ARE THE FUNDMENTS
OF BIG AND IMPORTANT POLICY.
JILLIAN: CHRISTIAN, WE HAVE TO
LET YOU GO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ENDS UP HAPPENING?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT PULLING
