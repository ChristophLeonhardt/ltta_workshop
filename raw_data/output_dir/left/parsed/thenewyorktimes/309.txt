When I looked at my
mother, my grandmother,
and my great grandmother, I just
saw women who were burdened.
Women who weren’t free.
I was just intent on having
another kind of life.
My mother is the
youngest of eight.
Her dream was always to travel
the world playing her music.
She was 16 when she
married my father.
He was abusive and we moved
back into my grandparents’ home.
My mom worked long hours.
She was always stressed.
She ended up pregnant three
times after she left my father.
She said she just didn’t
believe in abortion
and she was going to
have each of the babies.
I didn’t want to be her,
someone like her, 
stuck in that town.
I wanted to get out of 
De Ridder and go to college.
I remember having
this dream of having
a flat in Europe or some
studio apartment in New York.
He told his
stepfather and his mom
that we were going
to the state fair.
There was a woman
sitting there waiting.
I just remember her looking
at me and saying,
“Don’t worry.
This is my fifth one.
It doesn’t hurt.”
I couldn’t even process it
mentally or emotionally.
I felt that I had
let everyone down
and they didn’t even know it.
On the way home, I got in
the backseat and just slept.
I married a man who
did not want kids.
I said,
“I like children, but
I just, I don’t want them.”
And I still don’t feel that
just because you’re a woman,
you’re supposed to have kids.
But around 30, 31, something
within me started changing.
Why did I make the
decision not to have kids?
I was definitely
in deep conflict.
We ended up going
our separate ways.
I was watching something on
television about abortion.
I just hadn’t allowed
myself to really think
about that baby
and that pregnancy.
Just the floodgate opened.
I thought about how
old the child would
have been at that point and,
oh my God, what kind of mother
would I have been?
I met a guy.
He was a single father.
We hit it off, and I must have
been pregnant by that fall.
It felt surreal.
Something about it
also felt very natural.
When I think about my
mother, my grandmother,
my great grandmother, motherhood
is something that just happened
or seemed to happen to them.
I stepped in and
ended that, but I also
am very saddened by having
to make that choice.
I’m proud of the
life that I’ve been
able to craft and the freedom
that I’ve had because I’m
able to share that with my son.
We finally went to see a
reproductive endocrinologist.
At 30, I had no eggs.
