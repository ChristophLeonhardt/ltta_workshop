IN PROTEST WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
TRIES TO PUT WORKING PEOPLE
FIRST.
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF THE G7
ELITE MELTDOWN AT FNC.
JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS FOX
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR LISA BOOTH AND
BRUCE HEYMAN.
MR. HEYMAN, I WAS INTERESTED
THAT YOU RETWEETED TODAY
SOMETHING FROM THE NEW YORK
TIMES.
BUT -- THAT I THINK REALLY WELL
CAPTURES THE ATTITUDE OF THE
ELITE TO WHAT WENT DOWN AT THAT
SUMMIT IN CANADA WITH A TWEET
STORM FROM AIR FORCE ONE
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALL BUT BLEW UP
THE GROUP OF SEVEN NATIONS THAT
THE UNITED STATES LED FOR MORE
THAN SEVEN DECADES AND DECLARED
POLITICAL WAR ON ITS CLOSEST
NEIGHBOR.
THIS IS SO OVERTOP.
IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT YOU'RE
EXPERIENCING, YOU AND YOURS THAT
HAVE THAT VIEW, IS JUST SHOCK AT
THE DEMOCRATIC PROTEST FINALLY
WORKING.
THAT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND
YEARS, PEOPLE VOTE IN ELECTION.
NOTHING REALLY CHANGES.
IN 2016 SOMEONE IS ELECTED WHO
PROMISES TO CHANGE AND YOU CAN'T
QUITE BELIEVE THAT HE'S ACTUALLY
DOING IT.
>> OH, SO, HERE IS THE REALITY
HERE.
AND THE THING THAT I KNOW SO
WELL, THE UNITED STATES AND
CANADA HAVE NO BETTER
RELATIONSHIP THAN ANY TWO
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRADE,
$680 BILLION IN GOODS AND
SERVICES IN THE U.S. HAS A
SURPLUS IN TRADE.
THIS IS OUR BEST FRIEND.
THIS IS OUR BEST ALLY.
AND SO TO TREAT CANADA IN THE
WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN TREATING
INAPPROPRIATE.
THAT BEING SAID, I THINK CALMER
VOICES NEED TO COME IN.
AND WE NEED TO FIND A PASSIVE
SOLUTION.
BUT, DON'T GET ME WRONG, THIS IS
ABOUT JOBS TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.
MILLIONS OF U.S. JOBS, MIDDLE
CLASS, GOOD-PAYING JOBS ARE DUE
TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CANADA.
AND SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE MISS
PLACED THIS.
AND I HEAR YOU.
LOOK.
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
EXCITEMENT AROUND POPULOUS.
AND YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT
AROUND THE WORLD IN TERMS OF
VOTING AND OUTCOMES.
BUT I THINK SOMETIMES WE PUT A
GUN TO OUR HEAD AND START
CLICKING THE TRIGGER, ESPECIALLY
AS IT COMES TO CANADA.
I THINK WE'RE MAKING A HUGE
ERROR HERE, SIR.
>> STEVE:  BUT WHY DO YOU THINK
IT'S NOT OKAY FOR THE PRESIDENT
TO JUST SIMPLY MOVE FORWARD ON
THE THINGS HE WAS ELECTED TO DO
AND SPECIFICALLY TO PUT THE
AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST?
ONE PARTICULAR THING EVERYONE IS
GOING ON ABOUT HOW AMAZING
CANADA IS.
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
>> STEVE:  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN
THE NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT.
JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS
DISPUTE.
>> LOOK, WE NEED TO HAVE A
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT OF SOME TYPE.
>> STEVE:  BUT LET'S JUST
EXPLAIN TO THE AUDIENCE WHAT IS
GOING ON HERE WHICH IS THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO
TAKE OUT OF NAFTA A PROVISION
THAT MEANS THAT MULT NATIONAL
CORPORATIONS CAN GET ANY
DISPUTES WITH THE GOVERNMENT
DEALT WITH BY A BUNCH OF
BUREAUCRATS SO THAT A COMPANY, A
FOREIGN COMPANY THAT OPERATES IN
AMERICA IS SUBJECT TO AMERICAN
COURT.
AND IT'S THEM THAT IS NOMINATING
AGAINST VOICE.
>> LOOK, I'M NOT GETTING -- I'M
NOT GETTING -- I'M NOT THE TRADE
NEGOTIATOR HERE BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES TODAY.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, THIS
AGREEMENT HAS PRODUCED A LOT OF
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS.
35 U.S. STATES, THEIR NUMBER ONE
EXPORT MARKET IS TO CANADA.
AND WE HAVE A VERY BOUND TRICK.
IN AGRICULTURE, U.S. HAS A
SURPLUS OF AGRICULTURE WITH
CANADA.
>> STEVE:  OKAY.
I DON'T WANT TO GET BOGGED DOWN.
I'M SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF.
BECAUSE WE WERE HOPEFUL -- I'M
MAKING A GENERAL POINT HERE
ABOUT THE FACT THAT JUST THE
VERY NOTION OF CHALLENGING THIS
STUFF IS SEEN AS JUST COMPLETELY
BEYOND THE PAIR.
HOW DARE HE EVEN ARGUE WITH OUR
ALLIES.
>> WELL, PAYING ATTENTION TO THE
2016 ELECT.
BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED,
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES FEEL LIKE
HE HAD A MANDATE.
LOOK, HIS ELECTION WAS A DIRECT
RESPONSE TO WHAT WE SAW FROM
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHERE AMERICANS
FELT LIKE WE WERE WEAK ON THE
WORLD STAGE.
AND THEY ELECTED SOMEONE WHO HAD
A POSITION OF STRENGTH WHO SAID
THAT I'M GOING TO GO IN.
I'M GOING TO SHAKE THINGS UP.
I'M GOING TO CHANGE SORT OF THE
GLOBAL STATUS QUO THAT WE'VE
BEEN SEEING THAT AMERICANS WERE
DISSATISFIED WITH.
LOOK, IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS THE FACT
THAT THE NAFTA DEAL IS WEAK, HOW
ELSE DO YOU EXTRACT EXTRACTIONS.
>> RIGHT.
>> OR IN CONCESSIONS WITHOUT
UTILIZING SOME SORT OF LEVERAGE.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE
ALUMINUM AND STEEL TARIFFS COME
INTO PLAY.
IS PRESIDENT TRUMP TRYING TO USE
THAT AS LEVERAGE AGAINST CANADA
AND MEXICO.
ALSO, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
ALREADY DONE EVERYTHING HE SAID
HE WAS GOING TO DO.
HE PULLED OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL.
THE PARIS ACCORD DEAL.
SENDING A VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO
THE REST OF THE WORLD IF YOU'RE
NOT WITH US FOR SOME OF THESE
ALONE.
I AGREE WITH THAT VERY MUCH.
AMBASSADOR, I WOULD HATE TO TAKE
A SHOT AT YOUR FORMER
PROFESSION.
BUT ISN'T IT ALSO GOOD NEWS THAT
FINALLY THANKS TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP WE'RE PULLING THE VEIL
FROM THIS RIDICULOUS GAME OF
DIPLOMACY THAT GOES ON THAT THEY
TRY TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE'S
VIEW.
THEY COVER UP THE REALITY.
IT'S JUST TRANSPARENT, ISN'T IT?
BETTER THAN DIPLOMACY?
TNCHTS
TNCHT
.
>> LOOK, I'M A VERY FRANK PERSON
AND OUTSPOKEN.
I THINK THE CANADIANS WOULD TELL
YOU THAT.
I BRING UP ISSUES THAT ARE A
CONCERN WITH THE UNITED STATES.
WE HAVE NO BETTER FRIEND IN THE
WORLD.
AND WHEN WE SIT DOWN AND TALK
ABOUT TRADE IN DOLLARS AND
CENTS, YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT
OF HOW IMPORTANT THIS
RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN TO THE
UNITED STATES.
THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR US AT
EVERY TWIST AND TURN IN OUR DEEP
HISTORY WITH THEM.
150 YEARS.
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO HELPED
FAIR OUR DIPLOMATS OUT OF IRAN
WHEN THE AYATOLLAH CAME OVER AND
TOOK OVER.
THEY WERE THE ONES WITH US AT
9/11.
>> STEVE:  HE'S NOT TRYING TO
INVADE CANADA.
HE'S NOT TRYING IT DO THAT.
HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET A FAIR
DEAL FOR AMERICA.
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
PEOPLE WEIGH -- THEY BLOW UP
EVERYTHING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THE ECONOMY WAS SUPPOSED TO
CRASH UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED.
WITH FIRE AND FURY, WE'RE ON THE
BRINK OF WORLD WAR 3.
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.
SO I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
EARNED SOME LATITUDE IN THE
SENSE WHERE WE'VE SEEN THESE
OVERREACTIONS AND THEY END UP
REALLY NOT MEETING THAT PLACE
WHERE EVERYONE IS OVERREACTING.
IT ENDS UP NOT BEING BAD AT ALL
AND ULTIMATELY IT ENDS UP
WORKING IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
FAV.
SO, WHO KNOWS, MAYBE IT'S TOO
EARN TO SEE WHERE THEY GO BUT I
THINK HE'S EARNED SOME LATITUDE.
>> STEVE:  EXACTLY.
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS WHEN ALL
OF THESE EXPERTS JUST SAY, WELL,
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SAY THESE
THINGS.
IT'S JUST NOT -- YOU JUST HAVE
TO FOLLOW THE SCRIPT THAT'S BEEN
THERE.
THE SCRIPT HASN'T WORKED.
>> WELL, AND TOO, STEVE, I THINK
WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT PHOTO OF
OTHER WORLD LEADERS AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP STARING EACH
OTHER DOWN, THEY SEE LEADERSHIP
AND A POSITION OF STRENGTH WHICH
WE DIDN'T SEE UNDER PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
AND, AGAIN, I REALLY THINK
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ELECTION WAS A
RESPONSE FROM THE WEAKNESS OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THEY WANTED AMERICA TO BE STRONG
AGAIN.
THEY WANTED AMERICA TO ASSERT
