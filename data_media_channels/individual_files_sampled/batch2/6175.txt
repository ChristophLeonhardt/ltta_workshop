a member and get the whole show okay so now as usual lately we've been starting with a little bit of fun so we got Sacha Baron Cohen but we also have some parts of the TYT Network as well so let's go over here so Sacha Baron Cohen's on it again Showtime series is who is America and he has been busting these guys up understand that he did not solely target conservatives he also went after people in the media and also liberals so smart folks in the media like Ted Koppel and in politics like Bernie Sanders immediately said during the interviews you can see it it's on the show itself this is nonsense it doesn't make any sense so they were quick to call him out and on the other hand conservatives not so quick by the way you know there's people that are in the art community that could be described as progressives who also were not quick I'm just trying to give you the full context in this case sheriff joe arpaio he's a criminal he was pardoned by Donald Trump because Donald Trump liked the laws that he was breaking and that was of course by the way not listening to court orders Donald Trump doesn't really believe in the American justice system so that's not surprising but we're gonna have fun here with how Cohen got him first of all he's dressed up in this case as a Finnish YouTube star which is already fun his handle is oMG Wiz boy OMG somehow he got joe arpaio a massive right we're here to sit down for unboxing videos and then madness ensued let's start the first video delish donut do you want to say hello hi delish donut is anti guns I think all the guns should be given back delicious donut you have to understand that you have to follow the Constitution and a law allow people to have guns but I want the guns to be taken back because they are dangerous bad guys are going to get their guns it's gonna kill you I'm hoping there's somebody else in there as a gun and we'll shoot that person before he shoots you oh ok then thank you for telling me that because I like guns I every party knows I've got a really big collection I have over 43 guns you have 43 guns oh yes I've been collecting them for the upcoming race war all right listen when he says I've been collecting them for the upcoming race war that's when you get up take the mic off and you're done with that interview unless you're sheriff joe arpaio huh although i was pleasantly surprised to see that joe arpaio thought 43 guns was a lot he's like whoa ok apparently there's some limit and in the way that he got this interview is he yes he pretended to be in favor of Donald Trump oMG Wiz boy oMG and and in the beginning he talked about how or the how the Communists are trying to stop people from having guns and Sheriff Joe was like yo yea and that's why he goes and talks to delish donut which he calls delicious donut and he's like now delicious donut remember people are trying to kill you ok now he's gonna say some things that are far worse although I'm not positive he understood what he was saying we'll get to that in a second but before we do I actually wanna go to my favorite clip because I love the look of Sheriff Joe Arpaio's face here is such a burger just as fun nonsense what and so loo loo loo loo tikka foo and ticket or on tell Hudson curd her fertility yet enemy proofs proof on tear flu evil you he's killing him man he's absolutely killing it who's America on Showtime the whole series amazing not just the stuff that they release in public but you sure get up if you don't agree with the fufufufu get up get up get up you won't get up and then so at the end this happens my first job was a handjob from my mother and it was newspapers what was your first handjob so let me say this me whatever I did in my life I always did that extra it gets me in trouble sometime you wanted to keep the best handjob possible extra center oh so if the on Google tube calls you up after this and says Sheriff Joe I want to offer you an amazing blowjob would you say yes I may have to say yes indeed after what Donald Trump's done for him I basically made sure that he doesn't go to jail when he's was a convicted criminal I should have gotten to jail I suppose maybe that is in order he can claim that he didn't quite understand what he was saying and you can see that in parts he really has kind of lost it but I thought that was fairly clear I mean he said hand he said blow hey you know the accident wasn't that thick in those particular cases besides which it doesn't really matter what matters most is revealing their true nature and that's why the shows brilliant because you know the the fun jokes about hand jobs okay all right great god bless I enjoyed that Oh okay okay but the essence of it is hey delicious donut now remember you know when people are coming to kill you you should have a gun too so tiny kids about guns and he's done this on countless occasions with conservatives that are massively Pro guns etc and by the way Sheriff Joe was right at the end when he said sometimes doing that little extra is what gets him in trouble so for example that extra Hena interview he did with not Sasha Baron Cohen but American Free Press well what are they well they are an anti-semitic week weekly publication okay he claims why'd they are they are they I didn't know that well Sheriff Joe if you did one interview with them and you didn't know what they were about okay that happens I could understand you know how many interviews Joe Arpaio did with them five that little extra that's what defines Sheriff Joe Arpaio's career perfectly exposed all right now I'm moving on let's go to Kyle so calculon's he does a show called secular talk it's part of the TYT Network I happen to think he's awesome he's been on The Young Turks before as well this particulars show and now you're gonna get to see why some people call him the Kyle Driver I love nicknames sometimes I call him the crusher but I like piledriver better now so Fox News made the mistake of asking him to be on-air they thought they were gonna steamroll them as they do with all left-wing guests that they would present right-wing framing and then ask him to scramble and defend it well Kyle doesn't do defense as much as he does offense so he decided he was gonna go on the attack you're gonna like this so first off they do a whole section I'm leaving out here and you could watch the whole interview on Kyle's channel secular talk we'll have the link down below but they set up this framing of the far left the far left and this is when the Liberals are supposed to apologize for it on Fox News but here's what kuklinski doesn't step kyle should moderate democrats worry about this far left push no I think that the far left is actually the way for Democrats to win believe they're not so when you look at the polls and you look at all the substantive policy issues the American people overwhelmingly support Medicare for all for example they overwhelmingly support free college they overwhelmingly want to end the wars so when you go issue for issue the American people are actually with the far left and in fact President Trump when he ran in 2016 stole some of those issues he ran against the wars he ran against the trade deal and he might you might have a point he also said he wasn't gonna touch any of the entitlement Social Security right or or Medicare you make a good point Kyle driver all right might be reports of that clip are the looks on the right where's face Chris the gall he and let alone the Fox News host so first there they go okay now the far left oh you go ahead and apologize for him and cause like no I think they have the right positions and right wing host is like you didn't see that coming and then when the Fox News host agrees with Congress that's that's a good point I mean yeah American people are in favor of those positions we be calling a far left this the guy was like he's not anywhere near done so then they would play a long clip of a just democrat cory bush she's got an election coming up tomorrow in Missouri she's a wonderful candidate they sent someone to trip her up about the tax rates I I think Corey's position on tax rates are exactly right she didn't give a great answer to be honest and I might have even said that but Kyle didn't say that they're like okay now apologize for Corey Bush he's like no I don't think so listen to this child is that the future of the Democratic Party I hope it's the future of the Democratic okay Jeff Jeff Bezos has over 100 billion dollars at the same time now we have 60,000 homeless veterans in this country and 400,000 homeless Americans the American people again to go to the polls overwhelmingly want to raise taxes on the rich overwhelmingly want to raise taxes on Wall Street operations I'm talking about 58% of Americans didn't so if your strategies to defend the rich by all means go right ahead Kyle driver love the facial expressions and the way he turned around he's like sixty thousand homeless veterans and they're really mmm that's uncomfortable man you messed with the wrong dude so now Chris the GAO is gonna try to throw in the usual not only right-wing framing but the usual lies that they throw in there as well know you're on with a Kyle driver it's not gonna fly watch we're still talking about radical French stuff abolishing ice abolishing law enforcement abolishing why are you making things up that's made up you just made that up who says abolish it yes you just made is I said abolish endorsement nobody you did is I excuse me is ice not law enforcement Customs and Border Protection already protects the border ice was created in 2003 and by the way their allegations one second one second Kyle driver you just made that up no who me yeah you no one on the left has ever said abolish law enforcement altogether never said it and even if you're talking about ice Kyle makes a great point there about the history of ice and how it is actually duplicated and so terrific points and then so at that point they're like mercy please stop talking just you're killing us I love it man if you're gonna go on Fox News that's how you do it so cock kolinsky secular talk check it out he does Kyle drivers all day every day on secular talk and next time you ask him on great that's awesome just be careful because he packs a punch okay see it coming I love it all right now speaking of not seeing it coming let's go to Brent welder okay so Brent welder of course progressive candidate in Kansas third District he's gonna shock the world tomorrow night I have a fun prediction on that coming up but the right wing the site has decided because the corporate Republicans think a lot like the corporate Democrats that hey you know what Brent welder will be maybe in their minds easier to defeat if he wins the primary and goes on to the general election so the people who are running this ad are actually right-wingers even though it seems very positive Brent in the beginning okay the guy who is the founder of TD Ameritrade Ameritrade is Joe Ricketts and his group is called ending spending and they're the ones who paid for this his son by the way is Todd Ricketts and he's the finance chair of the Republican National Committee so I want you to watch the whole ad in the beginning it seems like it's for Brent at the end they turn against them because they're right-wingers and then we'll talk about why they did it and what I think are the results let's watch these progressive Brent will dur community organizer friend of Barack Obama and Ally of Bernie Sanders welder wants to bring Obama Sanders progressivism to Kansas he raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour wipe out tax breaks for big corporations make College completely free and he supports single-payer medicare-for-all we don't need more Obama Sanders progressivism print welder to progressive for Kansas ending spending is responsible for the content of this they put in a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to run that ad so there are two possibilities so one is they're like I mean wouldn't it be crazy if you guys all had health insurance instead of being nervous strikes about whether your family's going to live or die he's actually fighting for the American Way dream for your kids in terms of college education and higher wages for you that's possible and that's why they attend they said Kansas is not for progressivism it's also of course possible and his opponents have been complaining that this is done before the primary to try to get Brent welder to win now mind you there are conservative groups in Washington pretending to be progressive who've already poured in over $600,000 of ads against Brent welder trying to make sure that he does not win as a progressive in Kansas so those are theoretically left-wing groups but they are Pro establishment so now in this case my best guess is these knuckleheads think oh yes yes we'll we'll do this ad that makes Brent look progressive maybe he'll win the primary and he'll be in their minds easier to defeat huh I have one message for them be careful what you wish for you just might get it so if Brent wins the primary tomorrow night and I've got a prediction coming up on that for you in a second he is going to beat Kevin Yoder with a stick he's gonna beat him real bad of course politically first of all is already pulled out showing Brent kicking yoader's ass 49 to 42 Public Policy Polling he's got a seven-point lead on the incumbent this district should be blue by all intents and purposes voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary Donald Trump is polling the 30s in that district in the middle of Kansas and Kevin Yoder is one of the most right-wing congressmen there are in the whole country he's also one of the most corrupt he takes more money from the payday lenders than anyone in Congress those are basically legalized loan sharks but they get corrupt people like Kevin Yoder to do their handiwork for them in Congress to screw over the average worker in Kansas who needs a loan for a little period of time and they charge him sometimes as high as over 300% interest rates and Kevin Yoder aids and abets that robbery of the average American you think that he's gonna have an easier time with welder are you nuts Brent doesn't take any corporate PAC money he's uncorrupted so he's gonna get to call you corrupt day in and day out he's running ads against Yoder right now calling him corrupt what are the other Democrats doing Pat kake's leading from the middle that's literally a slogan from one of the other Democrats in the race and other slogan is the courage to compromise no they're gonna come a real soft and they're not going to talk about is systemic corruption and Ally works for his donors and they're gonna try to do a Republican life brant welder is not going to do that he's gonna fight for you and he's gonna come with a whooping stick so be careful what you wish for because either way whether you like it or not Brent welder is gonna win that election and that is in fact my prediction so the day before the primary let me go on the record Brent welder will win the primary in Kansas's third District he is a phenomenal candidate justice Democrat helped by other progressive groups like P triple see so many people have chipped in here but he has done an amazing job of organizing volunteers raising small dollar donations he's uncorrupted and he has run a campaign that was unapologetically progressive we are actually gonna fight for the average guy in the middle of Kansas and we're not gonna let the donors and their corruption win this time and Brent welder will win the primary tomorrow night and then he will win the general election easily I predict he beats Kevin Yoder by double digits sends him packing and then he'll probably go Yoda will probably go get a job with one of his corporate donors because that's who he works for anyway inside Kansas and inside Congress so here comes Brent welder look I I don't say it lightly and I didn't say it earlier and I don't want to jinx it but I'm keepin it real with you guys I think Brent has run amazing campaign and my political assessment of his chances is he's gonna win and when he does that's another Alexandria Acacio Cortes that's another deeply progressive win that the rest of the media did not anticipate here comes the Justice League Young Turks thanks for listening to this podcast you're only halfway through so hold hold stay right here just want to remind you if you want to get all five segments of the Turks commercial-free these are just two of them everyday we do it so go to TYT Network comm slash join and you'll get the whole five segments two hours ad free do it now all right back on a Young Turks let me read some comments for you guys first YouTube super chat stabby 666 writes in hmm I think I'll see what's going on in the Alex Jones Channel oh well look at that okay we're gonna talk about Alex Jones a little bit later in the program Danny Knapp of course he's kidding about how it doesn't exist anymore Danny nap rights and I YouTube super chatted kolinsky percenter 2022 Chuck Schumer's days are numbered you never know brother you never know and then on Twitter eclectic miscellaneous says Kyle did that interview exactly how progressive should do the media don't let the host or guests control the narrative show the progressive policies are popular and that progresses will not take other people's crap anymore he did trt proud hashtag too strong alright indeed indeed proud to have them as part of the network and we have the popular policies we should mention that in every interview and every time that we're brought on we represent the American people alright now let's go over here and do some more stories Charlie Kirk and Candice omens were having breakfast over the weekend they're part of Turning Point USA and that is a group that is meant to do propaganda across college campuses and intimidate professors who are exercising their freedom of speech so another last day of the group that most loudly cries about how their freedom of speech is abridged now that is a great great irony and hypocrisy but this weekend there were some actions taken against them that I do not agree with I wanted to show that for you guys as always we believe in being principled here and and being for freedom of speech no matter what and then we'll find out if Charlie Kirk is actually for freedom of speech so first here is video of that encounter in Philly yeah I don't agree with that they poured water over his head it's not the right thing to do one because it's anything physical is not the morally right thing to do another progressive thing you can do number two it allows them to play the victim card which they can't wait to play so why would you help them I like that now let me give you a little bit more of the video and then I'll give you full context Candice Owens who was there wrote a tweet saying Charlie Kirk and I just got attacked in capital letters and protested by Antipa for eating breakfast I don't know if it actually isn't even that's what she's claiming but this tweet already contains at least one lie she went on to say they are currently following us through Philly all black and Hispanic police force protecting us as they scream F the racist police now on the video it appears that there are also white officers but that's not at all important the lie is that they were chanting after the racist police I want to show you the video and you will see for yourself that they are actually chanting F the racist policies which is very very different watch policies as clear as they repeated over and over again and it doesn't sound that much like police its policies so now that doesn't in fact the fact that the person shouldn't pour the water over Charlie Kirk I'm sure Charlie would agree that protesting him is a freedom of speech issue because that's what he claims all the time when they do it to the left I'm kidding that I'm sure Charlie would agree to because Charlie does often does not agree with freedom of speech it's just whenever it is convenient in fact they have a professor watchlist with over hundreds of professors on that list where they try to intimidate them into silence now I want to be clear one more time here doing anything physical is not the right direction and I agree with Philip Blackman who wrote for the Washington Examiner that it allows for easy martyrdom for these guys and and they don't deserve it but I do also want to point out as in there in the middle of crying now although Charlie was smiling ear-to-ear throughout the entire video every time they pan to omitted giant smile over his face thinking yes I know the victim and I'll get the claim that my rights have been a bridge now but this Charlie actually care about rights being abridged and especially on the issue of freedom of speech because he puts all these professors on a watch list they get death threats non-stop some so much so that they are driven from campus and and for example a professor at Drexel named George sister Lamar was not allowed back onto campus by Drexel University unless he had security with him and they put him on administrative leave even though he had just expressed his freedom of speech but Charlie Kurt thought great let's intimidate them that's the whole point of his professor watchlist at that point he didn't seem overly concerned about freedom of speech well CNN caught up with him on that and asked them hey aren't you concerned about these people being punished for exercising their freedom of speech look at his answer some of these professors have gotten death threats as a result of being outed on these websites do you see that the watchlist has responsibility for that I don't have sympathy for people that are in public life that say these sort of statements and then try and play the victim card you don't have sympathy for people who say outrageous statements as you do all of the time against immigrants minority groups etc and then play the victim card so I assume today that Charlie's not playing the victim card or Candice owns oh they are all over the internet and all over media they protested us well you want people to protest all those professors who are actually doing their job the irony I don't know if it's lost on them because they're not that bright or if they think irony that's for liberals we don't care to be principled we don't actually care about freedom of speech don't you get it this is just propaganda so that's exactly what they're doing here I got another example for you guys you guys know the BDS movement that's the boycott Israel for their occupation of the Palestinians for decades now now you might agree or disagree with that principle but there's a bill that was proposed in Congress that is particularly odious it is among the most unconstitutional bills that I have ever seen it would punish people for exercising their freedom of speech against Israel how's that remotely American so let me give you an explanation of what it is the ACLU sent a letter to the Senate saying this bill would impose civil and criminal punishment on individuals solely because of their political beliefs about Israel and its policies well you say punished but ACLU what would be the maximum penalty you can get if you were to dare to speak out against Israel violations would be subject to a minimum civil penalty of 250 thousand dollars that's the minimum and a maximum criminal penalty a million dollars and 20 years in prison well I mean but look guys Charlie Kurt mainly focus on college campuses how about college campuses well the intercept reporting on US campuses punishment of pro-palestinian students for expressing criticisms of Israel is so commonplace that the Center for Constitutional Rights refers to it as the quote Palestine exception to free speech well I'm sure that if you asked charlie kirk about it he's going to be principled and say that is outrageous and if people want to be in favor of BDS they should be allowed to it is a freedom of speech issue especially on college campuses well luckily he was asked what was his answer Kirk condemned the BDS movement as anti-semitic hmm okay so I just want to understand what you claim are your principles so if you think something is discriminatory apparently it's okay to ban it now I don't think that's right but apparently that's your position Charlie we are free to clarify using it's that law that is being proposed on the BDS issue and Congress is outrageous and an affront to freedom of speech which it clearly is or do you think it's totally fine because you happen to think that movement is discriminatory because people think you're discriminatory so I guess that would mean that you should stop crying every time someone protests you like I said doing anything physical is unacceptable and that person who threw the water needlessly put them in a position where they get to play the victim card when in reality the rest of the folks there were exercising their freedom of speech against what they consider to be discriminatory and offensive speech that Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens do and if they're still crying about that they have no leg to stand on at all because they are the world's largest hypocrites they don't actually believe in freedom of speech they love trying to intimidate professors and in some cases even endangering their lives by putting them on a so-called professor watch list and they have never shown any concern for the freedom of speech of those professors the protesters or anyone who does not agree with them so I understand who they are that's who they are okay now we move forward to Donald Trump Donald Trump has lied several times about the Trump Tower meeting so that is not conjecture anymore Donald Trump has confirmed it so if you like Donald Trump I always ask which Donald Trump the one that was lying before the one that admits that he was lying today so I'll give you the quotes you can judge for yourself but if you want to know what the Trump Tower meeting was that was when Donald Trump jr. got a note from a friend of his saying that there are Russian agents or people connect to the Russian government who would like to give you information about Hillary Clinton and he said I love it I'll give you some details about that in a second including that quote and Donald Trump jr. a Jared Kushner Paul man afford all attended the meeting and now apparently Michael Cohen is saying to Donald Trump Donald Trump senior also knew about the meeting ahead of time and of course it's good evidence to that effect because a couple of days before the meeting Donald Trump was on the campaign trail talking about how there's going to be damaging information coming out about Hillary Clinton soon gee I wonder how we knew that now back then when this meeting was first discovered Donald Trump jr. put out a statement but we now know was dictated by Donald Trump that's another admission I'll give you the details so you're not confused about it in a second but at the time they had said we primarily discussed the program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago so when they're discovered they say oh no that was just about Russian adoption now this weekend Donald Trump senior admits that that was a lie he says on Twitter fake news reporting a complete fabrication that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son Donald had in Trump Tower so he's saying the fabrication is that he's concerned because he's not at all concerned he go to say this is the damaging part this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics and it went nowhere I did not know about it so let's note a number of things there he just admitted it was not about the adoption it was to get information against his opponent that's not me saying it that's Donald Trump saying it so if you think that's fake news take it up with Donald Trump cuz apparently he's the one disseminating it a complete admission it was in fact to get dirt on Hillary Clinton he is I told you that he would not get away with it because he is too stupid for a cover-up why would you admit that he's so unbelievably unintelligent so that's that he's a lawyer's worst nightmare go all around admitting things that he made up so now his defense here is oh there's nothing wrong with it you know you can just go get you know research done on your opponent by the Russians no you can't that's taking money from a foreign government that's illegal oops and by the way why did you write the last sentence I did not know about it I thought you said in the rest of the tweet that there was nothing wrong with the meeting if there was nothing wrong with a meeting why does it matter that you didn't know about it it almost seems like you're trying to cover your ass and by the way you accidentally threw your son under the bus there as well as yourself so Jay Sekulow his lawyer had earlier said that that meeting was about adoption and not about getting dirt so what does he say now he told The Associated Press Sekulow acknowledged that the public explanation for the meeting has changed but insisted that the White House has been very clear with this special counsels office in other words well we've been clear with the special counsel we didn't lie to them we didn't lie to you guys our story has changed he confirmed so we'll get back to that in a second as well so now Jay Sekulow back in the day when he was asked not only what the meeting was about but did the President himself dictate that note had said the president was not involved in the drafting of that statement man that is incredibly clear when Sarah how could be Santos was asked about as she said he quote certainly didn't dictate that note now here's something slightly inconvenient later the Nero Times reported the lawyers for Donald Trump acknowledged that mr. Trump dictated a statement to The Times about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between some of his top advisers and Russians who were said to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton and in case you're a lunatic who thinks that the New York Times just makes things up let me clarify for you his old lawyers acknowledged and actually bragged about it to the New York Times that's why it was in the New York Times we sent a letter to this special counsel admitting that Donald Trump did dictate to note so now that is two lies one they originally said we didn't dictate the note now they say yeah we're just kidding we're lying Donald Trump did dictate the note number two originally they said it's not important it was thought about the campaign it was just about adoption now they say I'm just kidding it was not about adoption it was about the campaign and yes it was to get damaging information about our opponent and who's a genius who admitted that Donald Trump himself this weekend moron of morons okay I'm not done with him yet so well are we sure that they knew that the information was coming from the Russians which would make it illegal well the note the email sent to Donald Trump jr. by Goldstone's said that they have sensitive information that is quote part of Russia and it's government support for mr. Trump Donald Trump jr. responded to that by saying quote if it's what you say I love it they knew that it was from Russia they knew that it was information that would help them that is an in-kind contribution as I'll explain in a second that is an illegal attempt to accept in information and an in-kind contribution from a foreign government thank you very much for proving the case before we even go to trial couldn't possibly do a cover-up way too stupid his idea of a clever cover-up is oh I got it and he once bragged about this he's like a color of witch-hunt that'll get him oh so dumb okay back to the New York Times the president's White House and legal advisors have said for the past year that misleading journalists is not a crime and get a load of that because what does that tell you they say well I mean look we lied to you but that's not a crime lying to the special counsel would be a crime but we need a line at a special counsel we told them that we were lying to you and this is the important part the American people so it's not a matter that's open a question anymore these are his lawyers saying yes we lied to the media so who's doing the fake news again here it is them admitting they're the ones doing fake news and when you lie to the media it isn't about lying to the New York Times it's about lying to Americans you're the president of all the United States of America and here you are you and your lawyers bragging about how you lie to Americans all the time and their main defense is it's not a crime well that's of course also not true lying overall to Americans is by a sub is not a crime otherwise you'd have to put away all the politicians but in this case the collusion could be so but now we're back to his lawyer Jay Sekulow he says the question is what law statute or rule or regulation has been violated and nobody has pointed to one well Jay no problem can do so let me go to the Associated Press again they explained but the legal experts have pointed out several possible criminal charges including conspiracy against the United States and aiding and abetting a conspiracy federal campaign finance law makes it illegal for a campaign to accept a thing of value such as a financial contribution from foreign nationals opposition research could be counted by investigators as a thing of value experts have said so they took time and money to get that to do that research in this case to steal the emails from the Democrats and so giving that clearly has value and they gave it over obviously in this meeting they thought that they that the Trump team was going to receive that they wound up making it public as well so their only defense could be it's not any of this stuff hey we attempted to do something criminal but then we realized they didn't have the goods so we couldn't accept the stolen materials we were hoping to get and we couldn't collude collude with the Russian foreign government that we were hoping to collude with that would be their best defense and boy that's a crappy defense okay here would go to one more campaign finance expert Rick Asus says the courts would have to consider the opposition research from Russian agents quote a thing of value for campaign finance purposes very very clear now after all this comes out I'm wondering are the Trump's lawyers and aides going to say I mean he meant it yeah of course this is part of a secret strategy to admit that we're guilty in public because we're playing three-dimensional chess No CNN reports President Donald Trump has been urged to stop tweeting about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump's top advisers and several Russia's a source familiar with the discussions tells CNN Washington Post confirms sources inside the White House saying mr. president please stop tweeting why because of course all it does is get him in trouble this is why you don't put your guilty client on the stand but here he's taking the stand on a national stage and they can't stop him so the other day he admits obstruction of justice by asking the Attorney General to stop the investigation of himself he says it publicly on Twitter and now this weekend he says yeah yeah we're dead it wasn't about it was to get information about our opponent hey I got him tonight and his lawyers and all days are like oh my god that's why his top two lawyers have already left the building it was the case of their life it would make their careers representing the president they're like yeah thanks but no thanks this guy's a hot mess and by the way he clearly did it Young Turks thanks for watching what I hope was a lovely edition of The Young Turks now you know that that is two of the five segments that we do because that's free we want to have you support independent media and can watch the whole show that we do every day that's five segments overall no ads at all that's at TYT Network com /join come become a member thanks for watching either way
