yeah and since there are um 30 clips from the debate we may skip a couple should we do good trump bad Trump just because yeah exactly we'll have to do that okay we'll do it just because Lindsay's here all right there's not really a place for it we'll just throw it out I know he actually was the debate was not bad Trump that if it was like somewhat good Trump the problem is that we are so late to the ball game with good Trump no actually now it'd just be better never Trump because this is as we will explain don't worry folks it is Bolin branch yes I have tweeted out the link I can it is before my very eyes Linc's the worst she comes back and I'm already annoyed um I am I'm prepared to rock right now okay so it's the nightmare scenario according to new NBC Wall Street Journal poll Donald Trump's is now collapsing he's down 52% to 38% to Hillary Clinton in a 2a race his down 46% to 35% in a four-way race in the generic congressional ballot Democrats now outstrip Republicans by 49 to 40 truth 42 Trump is not merely losing he's dragging the entire GOP down with him just in time to hand complete power to Hillary Clinton and her Democratic allies in the house of Senate so well done everyone this has happens this is what happens when you nominate a combination of Todd akin and Mark Foley to the presidency in late August 2012 if you recall Missouri senator Todd akin made comments about a local radio show on a local radio show about rape and abortion the comments made him a national laughingstock Republicans across the nation immediately cut ties they sacrificed his Senate seat in an attempt to prevent the electoral infection from spreading in the end Republicans lost just two seats in the Senate and eight seats in the House in September 2006 representative Mark Foley of Florida was caught in a scandal involving sexual liaisons with congressional pages Republicans again attempted to distance themselves this time far too late Republicans lost 30 seats in the house and controlled the chamber to Nancy Pelosi and her radical Democrats now imagine if Todd akin or Mark Foley had been running for president and imagine if the Republicans had then insisted on tying themselves to those candidates that's right now Donald Trump knows this election is over everybody knows this election is over except for a few demented people over at Breitbart news but they're clinging to an alternative reality anyway sorry to be depressing folks this is the truth it's a reality in which Trump could still win but only if everybody stays loyal to him and talks about how Gradius Trump's debate performance it gives him just enough credibility that Republicans will stay in line he tossed the red media Republicans and they're eating it up Republican officials who continue to defect will be punished by people who think they're defecting because they're too weak need to attack Hillary Clinton that's why Paul Ryan got booed after refusing to invite Donald Trump to an event on Saturday the day after news of the blank tape broke the P word broke here's wrapper cost of the Washington Post reporting just that quote and calls this morning many Republicans privately wants an effect from Trump but they say the debate gave them pause since he roused their base so the hemorrhaging of Republicans away from Trump has stopped for the moment even if some like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan are gradually attempting to edge away quietly like Homer Simpson into a bush in theory that's fine in practice it's going to be the equivalent of a Viking funeral the Viking dies the community insists his widow climb on the funeral pyre with him terms pride demands that if his candidacy is dead everyone shall burn with him like the heathen kings of old and burn they shall Trump informed his voters on Sunday that anyone who wouldn't support him should be punished at the polls raising the ugly specter of people voting for Trump at the top of the ballot and then leaving the rest of the ballot blank so Trump's gonna go down he's gonna take the rest down with him and he's gonna laugh while doing so here's what Robert Costa tweeted quote Trump's circle gloating privately mocking elected Republicans who are agonizing one laughed and said we don't care here's the thing Trump isn't a Republican he's not a conservative he probably doesn't think things will be that bad if Hillary and the Democrats are elected which is why he gave money to them for 30 years that's the sick joke of this election cycle his supporters think it's the end of the world if Hillary and the Democrats take over and they're pretty much close to right but Trump is perfectly happy to watch Republicans and conservatives go down and firey ruin just so he can feel good about the size of his hands and Hillary knows it for months she's tried to separate Trump off from normal Republicans she thought she could draw Republicans to her side if she created an option to escape Trump now that she knows she's gonna win big she's going in for the kill she's linking all Republicans to trump hoping to win the house here's what she just tweeted this morning quote Ryan is still endorsing Trump she's trying to tie them together this is a full scale disaster Hillary's looking to exploit it and Republicans are too short-sighted to stop it but it's not just about losing the presidency and losing the Senate and losing the house Trump has done something else too by forcing Republicans to lash themselves to the trumpian Titanic as it takes on water he's forced them to destroy their own arguments in their own cause Republicans have spent decades fighting the leftist false narrative of a broad American war on women and now they're spending all their time writing off talk of sexual assault as locker room talk Republicans have spent decades telling voters character matters and then when their candidate brags about attempting to eff married women they shrug it off by citing King David because apparently they don't know the Bible all that well republic have said they're not racist in either is America which is true and then they brush off the guy who went easy on the KKK and used textbook racism in the words of Paul Ryan against a judge of Mexican descent they're giving Democrats all the fodder they'll need for decades more of crap and false arguments about the evils of Republicans and the American people now let's be clear none of this means Republicans can vote for Trump you can and maybe you should as I said thousands of times at this point it's possible to condemn in the strongest terms all of trumps evils and still make a lesser of two evils choice a lot of my friends are doing that but many Republican leaders aren't capable of the cognitive dissonance so instead they make excuses for Trump and to make light of his disgusting rhetoric in action and they lose women and they lose minorities and there was an entire generation of young voters in the process not to mention their souls the Trump advocates wanted to see everything burn they're gonna get their wish but Hillary's gonna be the one holding the mass and match and she's gonna be laughing hysterically while Donald sets off to the side secure in the knowledge that at least he demonstrated just what a tough guy he is I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay sorry for the depressing lead there folks but I just decided I would get the the ugly stuff out of the way so we'll talk about the debate last night which went better for Trump than was expected of course the expectations were that he was spontaneously combust burst into a ball of flame hurl himself on Hillary Clinton and then they would both burn down to cinder but since that didn't happen he won so we'll talk about that and we'll talk about you know being the fallout from that the fallout for the Republican Party cuz there's just a lot happened over the weekend we did a Friday show but it was too early in the day so we missed all of the Trump vagina talk and so we will get into all of that but first but first we have to say hello to our advertisers over a bowl and branches bol and branch and they make sheets and they make the greatest sheets in the world these sheets are truly astoundingly good we we got them and we have them on our bed and I am very very picky about the sheets that I sleep on because I tend to heat up a lot when I sleep at night bowl and branch sheets they breathe they're really comfortable they're really nice they're good-looking sheets means it's it's they really make terrific product luxury sheets can cost up to a thousand dollars in the store but bull and branch sheets are only a couple hundred bucks so you get them for a good price and if you think all that sounds expensive for a set of sheets remember you're sleeping on these things every night and they really do affect the quality of your sleep they definitely affect the quality of my sleep they have thousands of five-star reviews and I believe they are there three former presidents have slept on them which means that three former presidents and not Hillary Clinton have slept on them because Bill and Hillary have never actually shared a pair of sheets or if they did it was many many years ago one time and that's how Chelsea was born in any case Boleyn branches are the sheets ends and they are fantastic if you if you go to their website right now bull and branch combo land branch cambio ll and branch com use the promo code been fifty bucks off your first set of sheets so instead of a couple hundred it's now 150 so that's pretty awesome and by the way you can try them for 30 nights and if you don't like them then you can return them so you can even see if something that you like shipping is free and I promise you like as somebody who knows nothing about sheets except the quality of the ones that I sleep on like I and I can tell you that I've slept on them they're a fantastic product ball and branch calm promo code event okay okay so since we last saw one another lots of things happened lots of things happen people and not all of these things were good and for the most most of these things were very very bad for the Republican Party so we take our story back to last Friday we begin last Friday I finished the show I say Donald Trump has a shot at restoring some momentum to his campaign Mike Pence has stopped the slide in the VP debate and Donald Trump finally has a shot to get back on track and then this tape comes out so the washington post breaks this tape it's it's a tape of Billy Bush the only Bush who mattered in this election cycle turns out to have been Billy and Billy Bush is on the bus with Donald Trump and they're talking about sex and such and and here is Donald Trump being Donald Trump you know what Ematic ly attracted to beautiful I just started kissing them it's like a magnet I don't wait any when you're a star they let you do it you can do anything whatever you want grab by the and Billy Bush giving the fake awkward laugh because he knows that Donald Trump's a celebrity and he's supposed to treat him nicely okay so Billy Bush by the way has basically been fired over this Donald Trump is says that and this of course goes viral because tape is everything in the modern society so number one if you didn't know that this who who was who Trump was I don't know what you've been watching from last year I know you've been reading about him for the last year I honest-to-goodness I mean like this is who Trump is and he's always had this kind of stuff I mean in the same tape he brags about trying to f a married woman and that's been completely overlooked because of this particular comment and in Trump of course says that this is just locker room talk so I want to break this down for a second okay yes it turns out that men talk dirty about women a lot it turns out that we think women are sexual creatures and we say things about their body parts and welcome to the real world by the way I'm under the impression courting sex in the city women do the same thing about men so the idea that men and women don't talk about each other sexually is just silly talk that said there's actual bad stuff on this tape okay when you talk about wanting to F married women I don't want to hear any more about how Donald Trump has repented and he's just like King David he's just like Abraham he's just like all the all of the founders of religion that he's you know an adulterous cretin who's never apologized for anything and brags about having sex with married women but he's just like all of the great men in the Bible then shut up but that's stupid it's illiterate you're a moron okay it's not it's not true second thing when he says so people brush stops just talk okay just talk when he says I just go up to women and I just kiss them and they don't do anything about it because I'm famous that is called sexual assault it is I'm sorry someone who respects women as someone who has a wife and three and three sisters and a daughter and a mother and somebody who actually believes that women are to be treasured and in terms of how you behave toward them and someone who has never ever attempted to walk up to women and just kiss her right I mean like my wife maybe I feel like badly by the idea the idea that I would just walk up to a random woman and just kiss her because she's not gonna do anything better I'm point out a couple things about this number one it is sexual assault number twenty says grab her by the bleep I don't know if he's exaggerating for the purpose of laughs or if he really has attempted to do that but he really has attempted to kiss women without their permission and he just doesn't randomly I mean the New York Times reported this back in May they said that he used to go into Miss Universe dressing rooms and just walk up to women and kiss them on the lips without any sort of forewarning without even knowing them just walk up to them and the reason that Billy Bush is laughing by the way is not because Billy Bush is a uniquely bad guy is because everyone in Hollywood acts like this is okay everyone in Hollywood acts like this as somebody who lives in LA grew up in LA knows a lot of Hollywood people when you say when Hollywood and the media and the Democrats complain about Trump doing this let's just be clear Hollywood in the media in the Democrats all do this okay NBC knew he did all this crap for 20 years and they put him on the apprentice and left him there and talked him up is a great god-king genius I mean this tape was lying around the eye in the archives in Access Hollywood and nobody bothered to turn that over to management I mean like because this is common because in Hollywood this sort of thing is common now that's said it is not justifiable and it cannot be justified okay when you say that you sexually assault women that can't be that can't be justified now here is the problem you can say you still can say I'll vote for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton you can you can still say that right but if you say if you say that you should also say some of the stuff that he's saying is bad it's bad to say these things it's bad to do these things right instead because people can't handle the cognitive dissonance at all instead what they do is they pretend it's okay that's just locker room banter oh it's just dirty talk what's the big deal why is this a big deal understand when you do that you're handing the Democrats every single thing they want in life all they want in life is for you to write off talk about sexual assault as no big deal while they're still trying to claim there's a culture of rape and or on one that's all they want politically that's all they want and so Trump is dragging down the party with him so this tape comes out and a bunch of Republicans do what always happens when something like this comes out they run for the hills right when Todd akin made comments I mentioned before about abortion and rape back in 2012 everybody ran for the hills here's a list of Republicans who immediately well here are the ones who never endorse or support and be called on him to step down Hugh Hewitt who has been a big trump booster Barbara Comstock from Virginia these are all senators and representatives charlie dent from Pennsylvania Jeff Flake from Arizona will Hurd Texas John Kasich Ohio John Catco New York Steve Knight California Michael a Utah representative Mia love Utah governor susana Martinez New Mexico Senator Lisa Murkowski Alaska Governor Brian Sandoval Nevada represented fred Upton Michigan here are the ones who rescinded their endorsements okay those are the ones who hadn't endorsed over here the ones who rescinded Senator Kelly Ayotte New Hampshire Governor Robert Bentley Alabama representative Bradley burn Alabama senator Shelley Moore Capito West Virginia represent jason Chaffetz of Utah Mike Crapo senator from Idaho governor dennis Daugaard of south dakota representative Rodney Davis Illinois senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska represent Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska Cory Gardner of Colorado Scott Garrett new jersey gary Herbert Utah I mean it's this list goes on on McCain senator Rob Portman John Thune I mean the list is endless okay so a lot of people just decide ok we're out and the reason we're out is because we're not gonna burn with you okay you're gonna go down in flames and we're not gonna do it we're not burning with you we're not burning with you we're not going to do this okay so what that forms up into over the weekend was a lot of people saying the Trump's should drop out one of the people saying Trump should drop out is Senator Mike Lee who never endorsed Trump in the first place and is one of the few honest people left in the United States Congress I really like Mike Lee like personally and also it's a politician here's senator from Utah now I there is a way here for mr. Trump to have a legacy in this election cycle and for his supporters who are really energy who have done a whole lot of good as far as expanding the party to have a lasting legacy that could mean something here and that is for Donald Trump to step aside and for the Republican Party to find a candidate who can bring together all the elements within the Republican Party and defeat Hillary Clinton in November that's what we want to do that's what we need to do now okay so he says that we need get rid of Donald trum now and we'll talk about Trump's reaction and we'll talk about all the rest of this the debate in just a second I want to make a quick note and then and then I have to take a break really quickly for another ad but here's here's the quick note okay folks I know this isn't pleasant to talk about you think that I'm sitting here chortling over this this is horrifying okay it's horrible and I wish that none of this matter I wish the Donald Trump could say stuff like this and you know it wouldn't make any difference but first well I don't wish she could say stuff like it's not only anyone should say stuff like this because I don't I'm I'm a gentleman I think that that matters to people and all these people who think that it's being a pansy to be nice to women and not say nasty thing about women I would just recommend they check their morals handbook again but I wish that we lived in a world where these weren't the candidates I wish the tunnelled Trump were better candidate I wish that Republicans weren't blowing this I wish that the polls didn't show what the polls show if you come to if you come here I'm gonna tell you that I'm not gonna give you happy talk about what's gonna happen in this election I'm not gonna tell you what you want to hear if you want to hear what you want to hear there are plenty of other places you can get it if you want to hear this morning only about Donald Trump is still gonna win this election and things are gonna be grand and glorious and he's going to a point that goes to Justice Scalia to the bench and the Republicans are gonna win 80 seats in the Senate if you want to hear all that crap there are plenty of places you can go and those places will also tell you that people like me own it when things go bad you know you get there plenty of places for you to go for the happy talk you're not gonna get the happy talk here I'm gonna tell you what is true I'm gonna tell you what is true and if you don't like it well tough because the fact is that my job is not to lie to you and honestly I don't think that it's worthwhile that anyway I think the reason we got here is people lying to you I think the reason that we got here is that there are a lot of people Trump supporters included who were lied to all through the primaries and all the way up to now who are told that Donald Trump was not only a good conservative but we're also told that not only would you be the only one who could fight but he would be the only one capable of winning and that when he fought he would win that's what they were told and I don't think that was true at the time and I don't think it's true now and I'm telling you the poll numbers because numbers matter I want to hear about stupid online polls from Matt Drudge about 97 percent versus 3 I love The Drudge Report too but online polls don't mean anything I'm gonna give you the poll results and I'm gonna tell you there's now a serious danger the Republicans lose everything to Hillary Clinton so long as they lash themselves to the mast of this Titanic if you lash yourself I mean Donald Trump is now in the midst of an electrical raging electrical fire all that happened in that debate last night is that he gave cover to people who still want to stick with him on the Republican political side or at least he pressured people to stick with him on the Republican political side but the polls show that he is still in the middle of a raging electrical fire now if you want to vote for him you can still vote for him as I've said before I understand I get it I don't think a morally lesser for voting for Donald Trump if you think that he's worse if you think he's better than Hillary Clinton go for it I understand that lesser of two evils logic is still compelling logic it still applies that said I'm not gonna lie to you about what's gonna happen I'm not gonna pretend your vote is gonna be the difference between Donald Trump winning and Donald Trump losing I'm telling you the only thing that's gonna make a difference now the only thing that's gonna make a difference is don't defend stupid nasty things that people do and say don't defend evil things that people do and say stand up for principle no matter who you're voting for and then vote down ticket because I promise you things are not gonna be ugly they're going to be horrendous if Hillary Clinton is elected and if there's no Republican Congress to stop here okay that said when I say hello to

you know that Michael Issa everybody said a lot of people say drop out people who are big Trump backers say drop out they're realizing that the writing is on the wall and all the rest and and at this point Trump says I'll never drop out Trump says I'll never drive he tweets this the media and establishment want me to do want me out of the race so badly I will never drop out of the race will never let my supporters down hashtag Magga okay let me explain something folks you're all gonna be let down you're all gonna be let down because he's gonna get crushed sorry to break it to you I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings he is going to lose and he's not going to lose in in in small fashion he's gonna lose spectacularly we're talking about McGovern type numbers we're talking about we're talking about Walter Mondale type numbers okay it's going to be very very very ugly and the worst part is he's now gonna drag other people down with him because here's what here's the other thing that he tweeted quote so many self-righteous hypocrites watch their poll numbers and elections go down I remember I'm old enough to remember when Donald Trump said we all had to vote for Donald Trump because he was gonna save the Supreme Court let's say the Trump were by some miracle to get elected what's he think he were to win for some reason okay something were to happen and it were to come out that Hillary Clinton once had sex with a Russian horse or something and it came out in in the emails released by the Russians let's say all that happened and Donald Trump ends up in office but he doesn't have a Republican Senate he doesn't even how close to Republican Senate you didn't get that Supreme Court judge you gonna get that wall now I can't get any of those things trumping care from never cared this is all about his ego it was always all about his ego today Paul Ryan said I'm not gonna campaign for Trump I'm not gonna defend Trump I'll still vote for him but I'm not gonna campaign or defend Trump because I'm not gonna get burned and burned all the members of the house having to defend all of trumps horrible statements that are gonna come out by the way if you think that the only shooter drop is this P word video get ready gang get ready it's gonna be 12 days of Christmas for the media because this is just there's gonna be a gift every single day and I'll tell you what the next gifts are gonna be in just a minute because it was perfectly set up last night and Trump fell right into it okay Trump's response to Paul Ryan was speaker Ryan should go back to being crappy at his job basically there's real there's really what he tweeted okay this is the guy running for president on the Republican ticket quote Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget jobs in illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee that's what Trump is tweeting out at the end his own Speaker of the House yeah clearly this is a guy who cares deeply about what happens to the Republican Party you didn't care about the Republican Party he has no interest in what happens here and we'll talk about something that next we'll talk about something Kellyanne Conway did that's even worse then what Trumpton which is amazing as I like Emily uncon way but first we have to we have to take our break if you're on Facebook you'll be cast into
