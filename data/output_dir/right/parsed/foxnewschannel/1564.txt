>> WE WILL APPLY UNPRECEDENTED
FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON THE
IRANIAN REGIME.
THE STING OF SANCTIONS WILL BE
PAINFUL IF THE REGIME DOES NOT
CHANGE ITS COURSE FROM THE
UNACCEPTABLE AND UNPRODUCTIVE
PATH IT HAS CHOSEN TO ONE THAT
REJOINS THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
THESE WILL INDEED END UP BEING
THE STRONGEST SANCTIONS IN
HISTORY WHEN WE ARE COMPLETE.
BRIAN: WOW, SECRETARY OF STATE
MIKE POMPEO PUTTING IRAN ON
NOTICE.
HERE WITH THE LATEST, DEPUTY
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE AND
FORMER U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE
OFFICER ANDREW PEEK.
ANDREW, WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS
ACCOMPLISHED YESTERDAY AS MIKE
POMPEO LAID OUT 12 DEMAND ON THE
IRANIAN REGIME?
>> WELL I THINK WHAT THE WORLD
HAS WANTED TO SEE IS THE WAY
FORWARD FROM THE PRESIDENT'S MAY
8th ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE'RE
LEAVING THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR
DEAL.
I THOUGHT WHAT THE SECRETARY
LAID OUT WAS EXACTLY THAT, WAS
THE UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC
PRESSURE, THE DETERRENTS,
IRANIAN MALIGNED BEHAVIOR IN THE
REGION AND DESTABLIZING
ACTIVITIES AND THE TIRELESS
ADVOCACY FOR THE IRANIAN PEOPLE.
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT COMES
NEXT?
THIS IS WHAT COMES NEXT.
BRIAN: RIGHT AFTERWARDS THEIR
FOREIGN MINISTER ZARIF, WHO
NEGOTIATED THE DALE WITH JOHN
KERRY SAYS, U.S. DIPLOMACY A
SHAM, MERELY A REGRESSION TO OLD
HABITS, IMPRISONED BY FAILED
POLICIES AND CORRUPT SPECIAL
INTERESTS.
WILL REAP THE SAME REWARDS.
IRAN IS BEING WOULDING WITH
PARTNERS FOR THE POST-U.S.,
JFCPOA.
HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
LOOKS LIKE EUROPE WANTS TO STAY
IN THE DEAL AND IRAN WILL STAY.
ARE YOU MAKING EUROPE MAKE A
CHOICE, AND ARE THEY DECIDING
IRAN OVER US?
>> YOU KNOW THE SILVER LINING OF
THE IRANIAN THREAT WE ALL AGREE
THAT IT'S A THREAT AND WE ALL
AGREE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
ITS GOTTEN OFTEN TIMES WORSE
SINCE THE JCPOA WAS SIGNED.
IRAN'S BEHAVIOR IN THE REGION
HAS BECOME WHO ARE UNSTABLE AND
MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH MISSILES
LANDING IN SAUDI ARABIA.
AS WE FAN OUT AND ENGAGE OUR
PARTNER COUNTRIES AROUND THE
WORLD, AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT,
AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT, WE'LL BE MAKING
THAT CASE.
I THINK WE'LL FIND A LOT OF
AGREEMENT AMONG OUR PARTNERS.
BRIAN: NOT YET.
THEY'RE REALLY TICKED OFF YOU
LEFT.
ALTHOUGH IT IS HARD FOR ME TO
SAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
STAYED, THAT WE SHOULD HAVE EVER
GOTTEN INTO IT IN THE MEANTIME,
IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE SENATE
AND HOUSE DIDN'T HAVE MAJORITIES
THAT SUPPORTED IT.
SENATOR SCHUMER AND SENATOR BEN
CARDIN DIDN'T SUPPORT IT.
FUNDAMENTALLY, HAVE YOU GOTTEN
DEMOCRATS ON BOARD WITH YOUR NEW
TOUGH POLICY?
>> LOOK I THINK THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN FORGET OR WANT
TO FORGET IS THAT THIS IRANIAN
NUCLEAR DEAL WAS SUBMITTED TO
CONGRESS AS AN AGREEMENT BECAUSE
TREATY.
THAT WAS A BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION
TO WEAK TERMS IN IT.
I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE
WILL BE A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR
THIS NEW APPROACH.
I THINK PEOPLE OFTEN PLAY
POLITICS WITH THIS.
PERHAPS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE
OF THE AISLE.
BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE
SUPPORT AS WE MOVE FORWARD.
BRIAN: WE'LL SEE.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, YOU WANT TO
PUT PRESSURE BACK ON THEM, THAT
