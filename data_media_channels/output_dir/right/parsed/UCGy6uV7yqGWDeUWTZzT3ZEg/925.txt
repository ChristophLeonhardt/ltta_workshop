I'm here in Palestine in Hebron and on
the other side of that wall that the
Jewish people have built here is martyr
Street and funnily enough the Israeli
Defense Force thought it wise to build
this barricade between the Palestinians
and martyr Street that we were on just
before I've never never felt such a
physical manifestation of hate here and
there's also such kind of an emotional
manifestation of hate as well I don't
believe there's ever going to be a
solution here in Palestine or on the
other side of that wall in Israel I'm
here in the Palestinian city of Hebron
on the other side of that wall is a
street called martyr Street if you'd
like to find out more from me and the
rest of the rebel team do join us at
rebel is real calm
you
