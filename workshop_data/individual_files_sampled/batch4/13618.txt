she is for gun a gun is an evil deadly creature that at any moment may leap into the hand of an innocent madman and kill everyone around it many innocent madmen have suffered at the hands of guns there they were standing in a crowd or a military facility or a gay bar minding their own business and shouting Allahu Akbar when suddenly a gun lept into their hands and opened fire thus ruining the innocent mad man's life many a person has become a criminal simply because he was standing on a dark street demanding a fellow citizen hand over his wallet when some opportunistic gun jumped into his hand and mayhem ensued this wouldn't happen if guns were banned if guns were banned the criminal would say to himself I was going to rob that person at gunpoint but guns have been banned so I will simply demand that he give me his money and if he refuses well all the worse for me women have been particularly victimized by guns it's easy to see why say some 5 foot 200 pound woman is dragged into a dark alley by a muscle-bound 6 foot 4 male who wishes to engage in what to him would be a meaningful relationship if the woman has a gun she might blow this guy to hell and gone and thus miss out on an amazing interpersonal experience so as you can see guns are especially bad for women most importantly guns are very dangerous to leftists you see leftist believe that your property and your conscience should belong to the state they back up those beliefs with laws that are enforced by people with guns if you refuse to hand your property and conscience over to the state these people with guns will come to your house and arrest you if on the other hand you also have a gun an ugly situation may ensue this is not just theoretical it is based on a true story that happened in 1776 so be warned guns are unhealthy for leftists because guns protect our property in our conscience and they keep us free and we wouldn't want that G is for gun I'm Andrew Klavan with the Lefty's dictionary
