1
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:02,907
SENATOR JOE DONNELLY AND THOSE

2
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:04,608
ARE THE GENTLEMEN WHO ARE TRYING

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,477
TO 1 AGAINST HIM IN NOVEMBER.

4
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:08,846
AS WE SAID, WEST VIRGINIA,

5
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:13,651
CONGRESSMAN EVAN JENKINS

6
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:16,286
INTERNAL PATRICK MORRISSEY HOPE

7
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:17,922
TO BEAT DON BLANKENSHIP.

8
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:20,591
AS A RESULT, HE IS GAINING SOME

9
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:21,225
TRACTION.

10
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:23,494
JOINING ME NOW ATTORNEY GENERAL

11
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:23,928
MR. MORRISSEY.

12
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:26,497
GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS EVENING.

13
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:27,698
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU

14
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:28,032
TONIGHT.

15
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:28,966
THANK YOU.

16
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:30,100
>> WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

17
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,101
EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU SAID

18
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,040
TODAY ABOUT WHAT SEE AS CAMPAIGN

19
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,008
VIOLATIONS FROM THE BLANKENSHIP

20
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:40,010
CAMP AND WHY YOU REACHED OUT TO

21
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,712
HIS PAROLE OFFICER IN NEVADA?

22
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:43,113
>> COUPLE OF THINGS.

23
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:45,182
VERY BIG ISSUE, DON BLANKENSHIP

24
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:47,318
HAS A HISTORY OF IGNORING THE

25
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:48,118
RULE OF LAW.

26
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:50,821
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT HIS

27
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,556
CRIMINAL CONVICTION RELATING TO

28
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:54,492
THE CONSPIRACY TO VIOLATE MINING

29
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:54,859
STANDARDS.

30
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,694
WHEN YOU FILE AS A U.S. SENATE

31
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:59,196
CANDIDATE, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

32
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:01,098
SUBMIT YOUR PERSONAL FINANCIAL

33
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:01,499
DISCLOSURES.

34
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:04,735
YOU'RE WEALTH, YOUR INCOME, YOUR

35
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:06,937
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DON

36
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:08,038
BLANKENSHIP IGNORING THAT.

37
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:10,407
THAT COMES WITH POTENTIAL CIVIL

38
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:13,043
AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

39
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:14,111
HE JUST BRUSHING IT OFF LIKE

40
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:15,779
IT'S NO ONE'S BUSINESS.

41
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:17,114
THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION

42
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:18,349
FOR VOTERS SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY

43
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,518
KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

44
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:20,784
YOU.

45
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:22,820
YOUR FINANCES AND YOUR CONFLICT

46
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,025
OF INTEREST.

47
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:30,528
>> HIS PAROLE OFFICER SAID HE

48
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:32,129
DOESN'T SEE THIS AS A VIOLATION.

49
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,833
WE KNOW THAT DON BLANKENSHIP HE

50
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,235
DOESN'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT

51
00:01:38,235 --> 00:01:40,638
CANDIDATES HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT

52
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:41,038
INFORMATION.

53
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:42,940
DO YOU THINK VOTERS CARE THAT

54
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,941
MUCH IN WEST VIRGINIA, WHETHER

55
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,709
OR NOT HE DOES THIS?

56
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,811
>> I THINK VOTERS CARE IF HE

57
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,713
JUST IGNORED THE RULE OF LAW.

58
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:52,516
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEING FROM

59
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:55,152
DON BLANKENSHIP.

60
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:55,853
HE'S BEEN WEAVING THIS TAIL

61
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:58,289
DURING HIS CAMPAIGN.

62
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:01,525
I THINK PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO

63
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:02,526
KNOW, ESPECIALLY PRESIDENT

64
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:05,829
TRUMP, DOMINATING DON

65
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,098
BLANKENSHIP WILL BE DISASTER FOR

66
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,098
WEST VIRGINIA.

67
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:11,936
HE'LL BE DEFEATED BY JOE

68
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:12,269
MANCHIN.

69
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:13,537
WE'RE SEEING MORE PEOPLE FROM

70
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:14,204
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

71
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:14,705
STATES DOWN.

72
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:17,141
>> THIS IS YOUR OTHER OPPONENT,

73
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,009
EVAN JENKINS TALKING ABOUT WHY

74
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:22,313
YOU ARE TURNING YOUR IRE AGAINST

75
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:22,980
DON BLANKENSHIP.

76
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,951
IT WAS MOSTLY JENKINS VERSUS

77
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,852
MORRISSEY AND BLANKENSHIP ON THE

78
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:29,153
SIDE.

79
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:32,890
HE'S RISEN IN THE POLLS

80
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,392
>> PATRICK MORRISSEY IS

81
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,759
DESPERATE.

82
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,462
HE'S TAKING SHOTS AT DON

83
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:38,862
BLANKENSHIP.

84
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:39,597
HE'S BEEN ALL OVER THE BOARD.

85
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:42,032
IT'S A CLEAR INDICATION HIS

86
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:43,734
CAMPAIGN IS ON LIFE SUPPORT.

87
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,736
THE POLL SUGGEST HE'S IN A

88
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:47,137
DISTANT THIRD.

89
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,740
PATRICK MORRISSEY IS DESPERATE.

90
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,443
HE'S TRYING TO ATTACK ANYBODY.

91
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:55,012
>> YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT?

92
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:57,748
>> SURE, I THINK IT'S PRETTY

93
00:02:57,748 --> 00:02:58,248
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

94
00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:01,485
VOTERS KNOW ABOUT EVAN JENKINS

95
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:04,254
LIBERAL RECORD.

96
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:06,624
RIGHT NOW, BLANKENSHIP AND I ARE

97
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,157
CLOSE RACE.

98
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:08,258
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

99
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:09,360
EDUCATE PEOPLE.

100
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,762
BUT THE MOST CRITICAL THING WITH

101
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:13,564
24 HOURS TO GO, PEOPLE SHOULD

102
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:18,035
KNOW, I HAVE THE STRONG

103
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,371
CONSERVATIVES WEST VIRGINIA FOR

104
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:20,671
LIFE.

105
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:21,672
SECOND AMENDMENT GROUPS.

106
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:23,173
PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT

107
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,876
TO THE POLL AND ENSURE THAT A

108
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,077
PROVEN CONSERVATIVE WIN AGAINST

109
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:28,245
A LIBERAL AND CONVICTED

110
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,413
CRIMINAL.

111
00:03:29,413 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WE'LL SEE.
