you know I was thinking about you know there's an American song from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli it's it's an American marching song it's a military song or meeting fight our battles it's I think it's a I think that might even be the song of the Marines I'd have to check and I'm singing it shores of Tripoli well that's Libya what were the American Marines doing in Tripoli Libya they were fighting pirates weren't they yeah and those pirates were avowedly jihadis I've got the communique of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson when they met with the emissary of those pirates who were actually they were agents of the government in Morocco at the time and they had an ambassador in London and John Adams and Thomas Jefferson actually met with this ambassador in London and he told them and they reported back to the US Congress that he told them we have are commanded in the Koran to fight against infidels and to capture them kill them enslave them convert them and this is what we're doing and so the this was the first jihad that the United States fought against it wasn't 9/11 it was the wars against the so-called Barbary pirates in the late 18th century and the very beginning of the 19th century that's incredible I mean it really goes back in history when Churchill I mean Churchill fought I mean he fought in five different Wars he fought at the Battle of Khartoum I think I'm not sure if he was in that battle but he fought in the Sudan was that a jihadist war against the West as well yeah a little bit before Churchill there was in Khartoum a figure who was known as the Maquis which is this the the savior figure in Islam he's going to come back at the end of the world and fighting the infidels and many many people another thing that I show in the book they have proclaimed themselves the Maquis throughout history and one of the most successful was this fellow in the Sudan in the 1880s and the famous British general who was known as Chinese Gordon because of his earlier heroic exploits in China was actually sent to the Sudan to fight against this and was killed there by him and the machi revolt was gaining incredible number of adherents in North Africa and spreading elsewhere with Muslims actually believing that he was the mock T because he could beaten the mighty British Empire and killed Chinese Gordon and then he died suddenly and that took the wind out of the sails of the movement but there have been these kinds of apocalyptic revivalist movements Isis is kind of akin to that throughout Islamic history that was one known as the car mad Ian's way back in the 11th century and they actually thought that the end of the world was imminent and that thus the aspects of Islamic worship that we're familiar with were no longer applicable and they actually raided Mecca and stole the black stone from the Kaaba that Muslims venerate and kiss when they make the pilgrimage to Mecca and they only brought it back years later when they were ordered to by the Calif and threw it into the the Kaaba broke it into nine pieces it's still of course in pieces today and you know in any case the these kinds of revivalists Messianic apocalyptic movements that have been extremely violent are also a running theme throughout Islamic history and today of course we have Wahhabi Saudi Arabia that started with one of those founded by Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab in the 18th century and we have isis and al-qaeda and groups like that these are not new cut a new thing in Islam they go throughout history that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
