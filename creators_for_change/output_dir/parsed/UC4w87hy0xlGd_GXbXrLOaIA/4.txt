Hey! This is Nadir from BENI
Sorry I missed your call but I'm not home right now but
please leave a message after the beep!
Hi.
I know I shouldn't feel this way...
and I can't believe I'm telling you this.
This month, has been really difficult for me.
I haven't got much sleep.
I said something I didn't mean
I'm finding it really hard to stay positive.
When Mum died I didn't know what to do
I can't get through to my brother, he's just always angry
I'm worried about them adjusting to a new family
Just don't know what I'm doing with my life
I keep reading these horrible comments
I've been feeling pretty lonely
Hey, its me Nadir
If I've learnt anything from (starting) BENI
despite how hard things get
what gets me through the day is knowing there are other people just like me.
Fightint their own battles
Their own imperfections
Their own demons
And thats ok, because its what makes us human
An an immigrant
As a Father
Child
A man
As a woman
Our stories bring us together
They let you know you're not alone
Your voice is significant
and you can take on the whole world
This month I learnt that even when the day is long and life is hard
its good to take a step back and realise its not only about the food
Its about the love that runs deep
The bonds that connect us
The energy that pushes us to be better
Better partners
Better daughters
A better listener
Better friends...
Its about knowing you persevered through your struggles and turned your weaknesses to strength.
So now in the future, when life feels at its lowest.
Know that you will connect with people.
You will fall in love
You'll still be forgiven
You'll always push through
So take this with you this Eid.
Take this with you even further.
That when the world is against you
you'll always be left standing.
Thats your story.
Eid Mubarak
