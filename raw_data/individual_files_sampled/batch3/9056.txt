SCHUMER SENDING SINCERE WISHES FOR HER SPEEDY RECOVERY. WE ALL SEND THOSE HERE AS WELL. WE BELIEVE HAMAS BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY. THIS IS A PROPAGANDA ATTEMPT. A GRUESOME PROPAGANDA ATTEMPT. THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT WEEKS TRYING TO HANDLE THIS WITHOUT VIOLENCE. Bill: THIS SITUATION IS VERY TENDER TODAY. THE WHITE HOUSE LAYING THE BLAME FOR THE DEATHS OF 60 PALESTINIANS IN GAZA AT THE FEET OF HAMAS. MEANWHILE TURKEY, ONE OF AMERICA'S ALLIES RECALLING ALL THEIR ENVOYS AND U.S. AND ISRAEL. DANNY DANON WITH ME NOW. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT NORMALIZING THIS SITUATION TODAY? GAZA? IT'S UP TO HAMAS. IT IS BY THE HAMAS ORGANIZATION. THEY ARE USING CIVILIANS AND SENDING THEM TO THE FENCE AND TARGETING ISRAELI CIVILIANS. OUR INTEREST IS NOT TO SEE ANY CASUALTIES BUT THEY HAVE THE INTEREST TO SEE MORE CASUALTIES. IN ONE HOUR WE'LL HAVE A SECURITY COUNCIL EMERGENCY SESSION IN THE U.N. SPEAKING ABOUT THE CASUALTIES. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. INSTEAD OF US SPEAKING ABOUT THE GREAT MOVE OF THE EMBASSY THEY WANTED EVERYBODY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CASUALTIES AND USING THOSE CHILDREN, INNOCENT PEOPLE AS HUMAN SHIELDS IN ORDER TO CREATE RIOTS. Bill: I WANT TO COME BACK TO THE EMBASSY. IT'S A PROBLEM FOR HAMAS BUT A PROBLEM FOR ISRAEL, TOO. AT WHAT POINT DO YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN NORMALIZE THIS BORDER YET AGAIN? WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF ESCALATION. WHEN SOMEBODY IS APPROACHING THE FENCE WITH EXPLOSIVES AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES. WHETHER THEY TRY TO BREAK THE FENCE. IF THEY BREAK THE FENCE THEY WILL STORM THE COMMUNITIES. Bill: YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. THOSE LIVING IN GAZA LOOK INTO ISRAEL AND DON'T SEE ISRAEL, THEY SEE PALESTINE. AT WHAT POINT CAN YOU GET TO THE NEXT DAY WHERE THE OTHER SIDE WOULD ARGUE THE WHOLE EMBASSY MOVE GIVES THEM REASON TO RIOT IN THE MANNER THAT THEY HAVE? IT'S AN EXCUSE, BILL. THEY WILL FIND A REASON FOR VIOLENCE. THEY WILL FIND A REASON FOR ESCALATION. I WANT TO REMIND YOU IN 2005 WE PULLED OUT OF GAZA COMPLETELY. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY JEWISH COMMUNITIES, WE TOOK OFF. THE PEOPLE OF GAZA ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS. I FEEL BAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF GAZA. ON FRIDAY THEY SET ON FIRE THE CHECKPOINT WHERE WE BRING AID INTO GAZA. NOW WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BRING THE HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT. I THINK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD CONDEMN HAMAS TODAY AND NOT ISRAEL. Bill: PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN. WHAT DID THAT MEAN TO YOU FOR THE U.S. GOING TO JERUSALEM. HISTORIC DAY FOR US. WE THANK PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE BOLD TO MOVE THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. THE JEWISH CAPITAL FOR MORE THAN 3,000 YEARS AND FINALLY THE U.S. TOOK THE LEADERSHIP. OTHER COUNTRIES WILL FOLLOW THE U.S. TOMORROW GUATEMALA WILL OPEN THEIR EMBASSY AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WILL COME AFTER THE U.S. TO US IT IS HISTORY. A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY YESTERDAY IN JERUSALEM. Bill: GUATEMALA AND PARAGUAY
