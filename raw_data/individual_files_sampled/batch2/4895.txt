day five 40 of the Trump administration and an explosive development as we've been covering all day in the Russia investigation with the president just two days away now from his summit and private time with Vladimir Putin let's put it this way if you wonder if we were really hacked by the Russians if you question the links they went to to affect our election or if you wonder what the special counsel has been up to all this time read the indictment that came out today robert muller charged 12 russian military officers with a sustained wide-ranging cyber attack on this country's democratic process the indictment alleges the russian agents conspired to interfere with our 2016 election by hacking the DNC the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein explained how the alleged conspiracy unfolded the defendants worked for two units of the main intelligence Directorate of the Russian general staff known as the GRU the conspirators created fictitious online personas including DC leaks and gusoff ur 2.0 and they used those personas to release information including thousands of stolen emails and other documents beginning in June of 2016 the conspirators correspondent with several Americans during the course of the conspiracy through the internet there's no allegation in this indictment that the Americans knew they were corresponding with Russian intelligence officers further on that point Rosen Stein added no Americans were charged in the indictment and said it does not allege that election results were altered he also said the investigation continues we learned today Rosenstein briefed the president told him this was coming before the president left on his overseas trip tonight the president's plan Monday meeting with Putin remains on the schedule here is the president on the topic of election interference in London this morning and remember he knew about this coming indictment I will absolutely bring that up I don't think you'll have any G I did it I did it you got me there won't be a Perry Mason here I call it the rigged witch hunt I think that really hurts our country and it really hurts our relationship with Russia I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia and a very good chance a very good relationship with President Putin today's indictment from Muller has a number of stunning revelations within it it says quote on or about June 8th 2016 the conspirators launched the public website DC leaks dot-com which they used to release stolen email that's just one day before that infamous Trump Tower meeting on June 9 another notable revelation quote on or about July 27 2016 the Russian conspirators attempted after hours to Spearfish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third party provider and used by Clinton's personal office that day is important because this happened on that day Russia if you're listening I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press well they probably have them I'd like to have release gives me no puss if they haven't they have them another part of the indictment refers to the time when the DNC Convention was getting underway it says an unnamed organization believed to be WikiLeaks message the Russians saying if you have anything Hillary related we wanted in the next two days the indictment also says the Russian Intel officers posing as the hacker goose' 42.0 wrote to a person in regular contact with the Trump campaign asking did you find anything interesting in the docks I posted that person is not named but is widely believed to be Roger stone that longtime Trump campaign advisor he was asked this and I about this indictment earlier tonight I certainly acknowledge that I was in touch with Trump campaign officials and I have testified under oath to the House Intelligence Committee that I certainly had a 24 word exchange with the persona Lucifer 2.0 over Twitter some years back I think I probably am the person referred to the reason I'm not charged in this indictment is because I received nothing from the defendants I passed nothing on from other defendants there's no evidence of collusion or conspiracy or coordination and the following is interesting for what it doesn't say the White House responded to this indictment with a statement that reads in part today's charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result again notably here no criticism or condemnation of Russia with that let's bring in our leadoff panel on a busy Friday night Jeremy bash former chief of staff at CIA and the Pentagon former chief counsel to House Intelligence Committee mica o yang an attorney and former staffer for the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and Matt Apuzzo Pulitzer Prize winning reporter for the New York Times and Matt I'd like to begin with you because you've been on this story from the very start having said that how significant was today in your view I think it was really significant and here's why Brian I think you know flashback to January of 2017 when the intelligence communities put forward their report that really said for the first time we think Russia did it this essentially adds all the details the why the who the when and you know obviously we've been dealing with over the past 18 months the President of the United States on-again-off-again saying I believe the report I believe the report I don't believe the report I believe Putin when he says he didn't do the hacking and here's Bob Muller's rejoinder to that he says let me tell you here are the names of the Russian intelligence officers here the dates they started here the positions they held here's the physical addresses they were in here are the email addresses they use here's how they routed their communications through servers in Malaysia it's really really detailed information and I think it it really spells out the government's case in full for why they they are so confident that the Russian government was behind these hacks and again I mean it bears repeating these hacks are front and center key issues in the 2016 election so Mika what does the timing of today say to you does it say that this prong of the Muller effort is is over and will be moving on does it say on the Friday before a Helsinki summit on Monday that this is a warning shot to Donald Trump so I think that we are seeing here a very important brick in this wall this is not the end this is the beginning of the middle this is not something that people are going to say okay well we've done this part and now we're moving on to other things the timing on this with hell thinking you know it really changes the narrative for the president and this summit which everyone thinks is a terrible idea and what we've seen in this summit is something that Trump has tried to do over and over again which is established a secret channel and a private channel to Putin we saw them try to do the story they campaign we see them trying to have this conversation now and in this summit where there are no other witnesses present you wonder why he would do this if in fact he is not at all connected to the allegations in the indictment today so Jeremy a two-part question for you how would a rational actor president respond to this how scared would you be part 1 part 2 what did you learn from this document today you didn't learn before well I think any other president would walk into the summit on Monday actually serve this indictment on the Russian president because after all it was the Russian government's own intelligence officers that are named here in 12 of them by name of course bringing the Muller tally to 32 individuals indicted five have been convicted and Bob Muller I think is really letting the facts speak for themselves and to your second question what facts did I learn first of all I think is very relevant as you noted in the setup Brian that the day before the Trump Tower meeting and remember that meeting was set up as a Russian government delegation that was supportive of Donald Trump's candidacy going to meet with the senior high command of the campaign in the campaign headquarters there's no getting around that that the day before is the day that in fact the Russian intelligence agencies set up DC leaks and other ways to weaponize the information they had stolen and then second that on the very same day that Donald Trump said please try to hack Hillary Clinton's personal servers in addition to whatever you were doing with respect to the DNC that night after hours for the first time the intelligence agency actually tried to engage in a spear phishing attack on Hillary Clinton's personal server and when Katy tur from NBC actually asked the president in that video clip he said they probably already have them indicating I think to the entire world that he knew full well what had been briefed to his team on June 9th the Trump Tower that in fact the Russian intelligence agencies had engaged in this hacking operation hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos
