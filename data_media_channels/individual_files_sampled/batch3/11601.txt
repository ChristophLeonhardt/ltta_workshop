mr. Armada waka the director of the ganache think-tank joining us live here on Artie International great to see you today so Putin and Trump agreeing to continue joint efforts to battle ISIL although according to senior officials ISIL is on the verge of being eradicated I suppose at this stage in the war what kind of joint efforts are they referring to now well I think the main joint effort is not to clash because the Syrian army backed by Russia Iran and so on and is making headway against - and at the same time there there are forces you know the Syrian democratic forces backed by the United States are making progression against - at the same time now there hasn't been or they haven't been clashes recently well there's been some tension but no clashes and probably the two parties would want to make sure that there are no clashes in the you know near future so at least they need to form some sort of a base for deconfliction between the two allies or the two alliances so to speak and then they need also to have a look at the future and see whether they can fine-tune their views and probably and hopefully their actions as well do you think though it's potentially symbolic that Trump and Putin have put out this joint statement or on Syria because many have said that these two players are ultimately on either side of the fence with the war in Syria is it symbolic it's not that simple like no well first of all we've seen this coming although it wasn't we it wasn't so sure that it would come out because the Americans were saying well we're a bit worried that for example the Astana process is taking now center stage and now there is this new Suchi Syrian dialogue sort of conference that the Russians have called for and and basically they would want to make sure that everything falls into the internationally recognized framework of Security Council two two five four and the Geneva process now they might want to trade something for that or for ensuring that they don't they've probably been worried and some of the factions that they support some of the opposition that they support might have been worried you know the Russians are calling all the shots at the moment so with the Americans trying to make sure of something they must have brought something else to the table to say to the Russians look we're willing to trade on this if you can ensure that the Geneva process is still paramount and what we see from the very short statement that were very short details very few details we have is that the the Americans and the Russians have agreed on key issues a to have the Geneva process still center stage and also when it comes to future elections that they would be supervised by the United Nations and that Syrians outside Syria might be able to participate in so that's some sort of a progress but at the same time it's good to have them agreeing on something rather than having this summit going on without them agreeing on anything which would in a huge disappointment as you say regarding that the the talk so the u.s. is involved with the Geneva talks but when it comes to the Aston our talks the US has essentially been shut out of those talks at mr. Bokka let's discuss the spoils of war here Syria known for its huge oil and gas reserves and now u.s. bat Kurdish fighters from the north remain in control of most of the oil fields in the east of Syria of course what's an enormous cash source for die ash and the ISIL and the ISIL mercenaries and terrorists Assad says he wants to take all of his fields back could that be the next stage of confrontation the east of Syria where the oil fields are well we'll see what sort of confrontation it be whether it would be only a diplomatic concentration or it would actually go down to a military one the point of the matter the fact of the matter is that you know President Assad the Syrian government have all the legitimacy in terms of international law to take every inch back of Syrian land from whatever flag that raises there or from whatever forces but the most important thing here is that it needs it blusters it maintains the Syrian government legitimacy within Syria to have all these places returned home so to speak so in a sense President Assad has no other alternative but to go for every part of Syria that is currently on not under Syrian flag now the the Americans the Turks and other parties who support militants on the ground who control for example a dream it lead province south of Daraa the south sorry the eastern and northern part of Syria eastern of the three keys where as you rightly say the oil fields are are aware of this but probably they are trying to hold on to a position where they can force some sort of you know backing down from the Syrian government on key issues like a political settlement whereby the syrian government would be more open to bring in opposition figures and so on and so forth so it's it's still contested and we think this is the shape of the next few months and probably hopefully not but here's also of the confrontation within Syria but definitely the the Syrian government they would want to go for every single inch of Syria back that's what they are there for innocent mr. woke up I'm running very low on time here very very quickly I must ask you you just mentioned the political process of the Assad government what is the political future of Syria we all depend it's very complex but it would all depend on what Syrians would accept so the Syrian government can out-of-the-blue say well we're going to include this faction who's for example based in Riyadh or based in Cairo or whatever they would have some sort of ability to convince their constituency which is the millions of Syrians who currently live under government controlled areas in Syria they would need to convince them of that otherwise the Syrian government basically won't be able to include anyone now the more an international Accord happens around this sort of inclusive process the more likely the Syrian government would be able to convince his constituency and not have any issues but then there is also the flip back of free bring you know people who are based in Riyadh who are very much connected for example to the Saudis or Istanbul to the Turks would they be really free to say what they want to say and you know government has what Syrians would have them we've seen for example subtle Hariri debacle in Saudi Arabia now you know turns out that he's more of a vassal than a really nice Prime Minister so that's another issue to tackle it's very complex it will take a long a long time but hopefully it will turn out right in the end we appreciate getting your insight to help shed some light on this as you say a very complex situation I'm gonna walk off the director of the Ginoza think tank thank you so much for joining us here on Rt internationally appreciate it thank you
