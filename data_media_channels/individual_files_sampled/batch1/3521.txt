Susan just walk it briefly through the history of Pottermore sure palmer's JK Rowling's digital content company for those of you that may not know it it launched in 2012 to consumers in two parts the first was as a expression of an online reading experience centered around the seven books and it also is a direct-to-consumer ecommerce site where it was the exclusive seller of the books in digital form I started in October of 2013 and one of the things that we worked over the past few years was to reposition it to really broaden beyond the seven books and to make sure that it was also a digital publisher as well as a direct to consumer seller so for the past year plus we've been selling our books through Apple Amazon other places versus going it alone and we've also been broadening the content publishing that we've been doing to be all about our new properties curse child and fantastic beasts fantastic beasts just past 600 million in the global box office Yeah right yes what was Potter Moore's role in the marketing at the movie so we work really closely with Warner Brothers but our job at Pottermore was not really just to market the film obviously that's what Warner's does right and does it really well our job was actually to create a lot of backstory around the characters and link them to the wider Wizarding World into Harry Potter has anybody seen the movie few of you okay the movie actually features four characters that you may not know and so we needed to provide a lot of backstory on these characters and how create a linkage in the worlds between Harry Potter and a movie that was set 70 years before Harry Potter went to Hogwarts we did that really through two different ways we worked with JK Rowling who wrote new content about the wizarding world and about fantastic beasts in New York City we launched that online with Warner Brothers and global media partners one of which was Entertainment Weekly hey thanks for your support in that and throughout the year when we launched that content we also took lots of different pieces of the footage that we were working with Warner Brothers to shoot in Leavesden in London and put little bits of that online so we had journalists actually covering the the taping and the making of the film and we worked with the characters to actually create different parts of their world that was tied to Harry Potter so this year in addition the six-hour play Harry Potter and the cursed child opened great reviews and fix hours yes sold-out performances I think you can't get a ticket for like us two years or something like that what was Potter Moore's role with that well very similar fantastic beasts we have done a lot of lead up into curse child curse child is a little different it's the eighth Harry Potter story it's that nineteen years after Harry Potter so we have both a prequel and a sequel sort of with Harry Potter in the middle and we had a lot of coverage not only of the play and the storyline as it was unfolding but we broke a lot of news you may have seen just last week we broke that curse child will be coming to New York to the lyric theatre hopefully 2018 so you don't have to wait a few years for a ticket but we've been working with the theater creators and the talent to also be celebrating different aspects of the play that you may or may not know about it's a very interesting and deep Wizarding World the JK Rowling's created so we need to be finding ways to give it different dimension to that for the audience and the consumer right and is it tricky tying something that takes place so many years after the books yeah late yeah the movie which is 70 years before it it is because ultimately there's a cannon that JK Rowling's created and that she's really the arbiter of and we have to find ways to be true to that that cannon for both fantastic beasts and for cursed child simultaneous with the content launching we published the digital version of those books and that was also really different for cursed child being the eighth story we published a screen you know script book that people aren't really used to reading plays so that felt really different for the majority of people also four fantastic beasts Warner Brothers took the screenplay that JK Rowling made and that's the movie so JK Rowling basically became a filmmaker they did an option a book it wasn't based on any book it was loosely tied to a text book that Harry Potter used at Hogwarts so we've had to find ways to make that whole world make sense and we basically broadened it beyond just those special years of hog or right so the closest franchise I can think of to Harry Potter is Star Wars and I'm fascinated by the fact that when Kathleen Kennedy took over at Lucasfilm Star Wars had been diluted so to speak in many different ways there were comic books there were novels no one and so forth and she basically um this was gutsy she drew a big line and she was like this is canon and this isn't mm-hm and you know going forward everything will be cannon but Pottermore has been canon from the very beginning yep right yeah so what are the challenges of that and what are the advantages so it is different having a real-life creator who is in largely in control of the world that she's created and we spend a lot of time collaboratively working across Warner Brothers and also with Joe to make sure that everything we're all putting out makes sense I think it's one of the reasons why when we put out the content for fantastic beasts and three different content drops this past year it was content that Joe wrote it wasn't marketing content it also means that we have to be really careful what we put out because we are JK Rowling's company and our fans as many of you know and you've got two daughters right yeah big fan yes everything we do can be scrutinized and looked at in fact checked for accuracy so we spend a lot of time actually on Joe's Twitter feed and going through it and she'll reveal a little bits and pieces and we have to make sure that those bits and pieces are not only accurate it's her world of course they're accurate but that we're tying and supporting them in a way that actually broadens the Canon right so you can't be an idea machine in advance you have to wait until she's written something and then you take what she's written and you mind that right we do mind that and she writes a lot of work that you know you may know reputationally sometimes doesn't even make it into the books or into the film she's a prolific writer and part of I think her process is generating characters in their backstory through a lot of stuff that may get published over time so there's lots of content that we're working with right now that we haven't put live she doesn't write it and give it to us and we instantly publish although we are doing daily con Publishing some of its her work and some of its content that we're producing there are things that we get inspired by and things that we work on collaboratively together one of the best examples of that that we worked on together with Joe was the idea that you could be sorted both into a hogwarts house at an L ver morning house Hogwarts is the British Wizarding school and Elmer Marnie's the American Wizarding school and when we talked with Joe about it we said can we actually have a concept that you could be I don't know a transfer student if you were in the UK and then you transferred to the US and she said well actually I think you you probably could be sorted into both of those houses they have different sorting ceremonies and she worked collaborative a little bit of us to write that so we pitch each other ideas and she comes up with a lot of stuff and we do mind that right and I think we have a video to show of the Patronus experience which is one of the digital experiences and should we actually explain to everyone what that is in case that yes go ahead and I hope some of you will find out but your Patronus is it's one part of your Wizarding identity it's actually a very difficult charm in a defensive way to produce with your wand and when you produce it it actually protects you from evil spirits that in the Wizarding World are called Dementors that could suck the life out of you and just make everything awful so one of the ways and we're talking a little bit about how we stitch these worlds together we took the cast of fantastic beasts the four protagonists and we had them take a very short series of online prompts which is this quiz that JK Rowling had written we expanded on her quiz which was the authentic Canon and we created a 3d environment with an audio soundscape and we put it online and we had people take a look at what their Patronus would be should they be able to cast it through their wand three million people took it in the first three days but let's take a look at what Eddie redmayne's Patronus is hey there i'm eddie redmayne and i'm about to discover my Patronus on the brilliant Pottermore comm all right so let's sir let's get started that's beautiful Sun wind or rain Sun even though attracting sweet or salt sweet popcorn always I'm going to meet its big moment here we go oh my god I'm a basset hound I'm a basset hound that is ingenious I love basset hounds floppy ears and kind of kind mentality slightly dopey perfect my Patronus is a basset hound that's wonderful I hope you enjoy firing your Patronus you know that was a fun piece when we worked on that with him first of all completely unscripted when you take that experience or that quiz you don't know what your Patronus is gonna be it's only between five to seven questions and you take it once and you can't really retake it and it's an interesting thing that we had worked on with JK rowling and talking a little bit about how she writes content and we mined that content and publicized and launched that content she had written that I think before I even got to Pottermore and so when I started in October of 2013 it was about six months later that I knew we had this content available to us and we wanted to make it using really cutting-edge technology was sort of difficult to do what we we did in sort of a three j/s technical architecture and ultimately when we developed that it took us a little while to do it and Joe had come out on Twitter and the fall of 2014 or so and said ok everybody my Patronus is a pine marten and she came out and we were working on the quiz at that point but we hadn't yet had her actually take the test so we were talking a little bit with her about 6 months ago to say okay we're ready to demo this for you it's in beta but we just want to make sure that if you take it you may actually get a different result you may not be a pine marten and she'd been very prolific telling people she was a pine marten she loves pine marten she'd been posting pictures of them and we wanted to make sure that she would be okay with potentially getting a different result and what was amazing with us was that she took it none of us were there with her she took it she got a completely different result she's a heron I believe and she mount up tweeting about it which we didn't know because she controls her in Twitter feed and we were delighted that that worked out because it was part of the fiction that apparently your Patronus can actually change through some series of life events so we learn a little bit in this job - mm-hmm so you reach your core fan base in a number of ways and obviously on power more there's a fair amount of fresh content yeah written by Otto herself yep but you also employ a team of Pottermore correspondents who are doing actual news reporting yeah and you have become the place that Potter fans go yeah for news yeah and you are a news site that's different right we are a news site and it is different it was one of the things we saw in the market that was a little bit of a void was an authentic true source about what is really happening in the Wizarding World I think when Pottermore first started Twitter wasn't actually the medium that it is today and for JK Rowling being a writer and enjoying expressing herself in 140 characters or less and on her own terms she's become to use that as a real tool and we wanted to publish to engage the audience with content on a much more frequent basis but we didn't want to solely rely on content from JK Rowling right so we created a concept that we call the Pottermore correspondents they're professional journalists we don't byline them we don't release their identity they're in different parts of the world and they report on different things that are happening and they themselves part of their criteria is that they're big potter fans so our really core audience was between 9 and 12 in the late 90s when the first book was published and grew up with the fiction and believed that that rite of passage of Daniel Radcliffe and all the characters from the movie or Harry Potter from the books was really what they also grew up with so those those people that audience is now late 20s they're on our site in droves many of them are Pottermore correspondent some of them work with us in London and for us and we find that there's an awful lot of stuff going on within the entire world that sometimes we don't even know is happening and it's getting reported in from different locales in different environments and so this is how you deal with the problem of fans just being insatiable for more content all the time right fans are insatiable and I think that's probably what we're gonna hear in the next panel from Star Wars I knew you know there's a feed the beast mentality with these properties and in our case at Pottermore because JK Rowling is living breathing delightful amazing creator in charge of this world we're not dreaming up new characters or ways to expose different storylines part of our role is to actually create different themes and different comparison points now that more fun to do given how broad the Wizarding World has become but to find different essentially things to report on and I think in a way that when fans reach out to Joe on Twitter or they want her to validate something we saw this a lot of Patronus people would say well I'm a salmon is that good or not good and she would weigh in and she would tell her thoughts on it it's also finding part of a way to legitimize and authenticate not only what we're publishing but take a little bit of the burden off of her to have to do that work right tell me a little bit more about Pottermore shorts and what they work what they are and whether there will be more of them so as part of our role as a digital publisher earlier this year we published a series of ebooks Schwartz called Pottermore presents they're 199 or $2.99 depending on the currency that we're in which these days might all be the same and we we found a need in the market for an hour-long read that could also take content we had curated on pot or more over the years joe's writing but also content that we had stitched together and we themed Attica Lea linked them and we launched them in September in a back to Hogwarts theme if you're a fan what you'll know is September 1st is the day that everyone goes back to Hogwarts and so we took that content and published it and really just bite-sized reads they've done extremely well we've been sign them as a trio but their individual purchasing and what's been fun for us is that in the two weekends during the year both the UK and the US had different daylight savings times and so we had a concept calling make your hour magical because we were able to actually turn that extra hour into reading time that's great I think we're actually out of time here I do but it's been delightful to see Thanks I'd shot
