get me a notebook out and turn to what makes me me and you you together partners will explore inspiration partner stories and problem-solve using new tools to reiterate our commitment to the green apron what we look like in action when we are truly at our best oh so so there's a green apron thing now as well as a third place thing this really is like Scientology isn't that swear when the post-modern left abandoned religion and heritage they thought they were freeing themselves didn't they from all those old rules and old symbols and old rituals and dead white guy stuff fussy stuff how dumb are those rules right well I think people crave rules and codes and symbols for life and look what the leftist Marxist have done they've replaced any real traditions with the third place the green apron old conduct old codes of conduct I don't know and Commandments or even customs built up over centuries like the golden rule do unto others and use as you would have them do unto you i thocht radition conservative values not only sane or but may be actually more helpful and practical I mean some Seattle millionaires saying every single thing is permissible everyone everyone is welcome that's not possible and it's not actually moral either and living with no rules is not real their plan will fail can you imagine telling those minimum wage coffee pours from a moment ago the ones talking about homeless customers and drug shooting customers I say customers as if they're paying yeah we don't have time to answer those specific real-life questions because we have to spend some time now with the big coloring book learning about what makes me me and what makes you you that was not the satirical video by the way I mean if I work for Starbucks I might enjoy being paid to not work for a day and instead to sit around and do this silliness I mean few things are sillier than you know corporate team-building exercises like this example on the screen right now so being paid to sit around and listen to your cult leaders expiate their own racial guilt well I mean if you pay me I guess and I guess it's a welcome break from having to deal with hobos or drug addicts I guess that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Azrael avance show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
