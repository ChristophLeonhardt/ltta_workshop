00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,300
“Hello, and welcome to
‘Internetting After Dark.’

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,020
If you don’t know
by now, I’m Amanda.”

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,880
“I’m Shane.”

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,400
“And we’re here to give you a
closer look inside the making

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,720
of ‘Internetting
With Amanda Hess.’”

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,977
“Should we get started?”

7
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:14,140
“Mm, O.K.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,150
So we released a
video about the dark side

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,820
of the male fitness
internet starring Zyzz,

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,970
legendary bodybuilder,
may he rest in peace.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,850
And I heard from a
lot of Zyzz’s fans.

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,610
This is what they
had to say.”

13
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,400
“‘Mirin’

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,240
‘You mirin brah?’

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,080
‘You mirin’

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,920
‘Yeah u mirin’

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,670
‘U mirin?’

18
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,170
So, Amanda?”

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,750
“I just want to say to all
of you that I am ‘mirin.”

20
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,950
“Jessica Hoss on YouTube wrote,
‘This was a waste of a video.

21
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,200
How are you going to talk
about Zyzz and the dark side

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,610
of men’s fitness online,
without talking

23
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,970
about steroids?’”

24
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,560
“So that’s a great
point, and it’s something

25
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,540
that we thought a little
bit about while we

26
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,980
were making the video.

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,410
We wanted to be
really careful not

28
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,540
to draw an association
between someone and something

29
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,660
that had not been confirmed
by the guy himself,

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,510
or by a doctor,
or the coroner.

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,850
I think maybe we were a
little bit too careful.

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,320
Like, we could
have figured out

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,180
a way to mention that this is
a phenomenon in this space

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,490
without specifically saying
that anyone in particular

35
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,790
had used steroids.

36
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,110
So that’s a great point, and
thanks for bringing it up.

37
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,790
My favorite comment
on this video

38
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,136
came from
John Paul Sylvester.”

39
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:28,230
“‘Meal one.

40
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,700
Mea lone.

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,120
Me alone.’”

42
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,565
“Beautiful.”

43
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:36,010
“In our last batch, we had a
video about online mysticism.

44
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,600
We got a lot of comments on
this video, and a lot of them

45
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,020
were just people shouting
out their astrological signs.

46
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,830
And that Gemini Cancer Cusp
is Joshua Chance,

47
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,950
who also said:

48
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,560
‘Y’all should do the
dark side of this,

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,780
the become a
living god website,

50
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,330
those guys are absurd.’”

51
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,300
“We’re going to just show
you a clip of the home screen

52
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,885
video for this website,
because it’s amazing.”

53
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:58,020
“It’s really good.”

54
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,840
“Over the last
two decades, I’ve mastered

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,210
the god-like powers
of divination, evocation,

56
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,030
soul travel and energy work.

57
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,500
But I’m not special.

58
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,758
You can do it, too.”

59
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,199
“Thank you, Joshua Chance,
because I had never

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,032
heard of the Become a
Living God website,

61
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,577
and it is quite a great
rabbit hole to go down.”

62
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:15,250
“Yeah.”

63
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,860
“Rhys wrote, ‘I
find that people

64

have the most superficial
knowledge of it

66
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,673
and wouldn’t know
the difference

between zodiacal

69
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,820
“I do not know the difference
between those things,

70
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,010
although I did some
YouTube investigation to try

71
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,810
to find out what they are.

72
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,080
I kind of feel like it’s a
little bit like Scientology,

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,940
though, where
like the more you

74
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,190
know about it
doesn’t necessarily

75
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,330
mean that you have a better
perspective on whether it’s

76
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,530
a real thing.”

“We have news
about jade eggs.

80
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,080
So, Goop has to pay
$145,000 thanks to a

81
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,250
consumer protection lawsuit
in California

82
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,750
that found that the
claims that they

83
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,520
were making about
their vagina eggs

84
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,100
were not based in fact.

85
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,170
Goop said that
its vaginal eggs

86
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,010
would increase vaginal
muscle tone, hormonal balance

87
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,510
and feminine energy
in general.

88
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,760
In fact, they do
not do those things.

89
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,850
So, if you bought
an egg from Goop,

90
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,200
you can get a refund by
calling 1-844-WTF-GOOP.

91

Should we call it?”

“We were so
unprepared for that.”

about unboxing.”

unboxing videos,

and their kissing cousin,

99

“This is funny because,
when I was a kid,

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,370
the only two things I would
do with my Barbies was,

101
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,080
like, cut off all of
their hair and make them

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,075
do sex do with each other.”

103
00:03:59,075 --> 00:03:59,740
“Of course.”

104
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,420
“So it’s interesting that
the first one of those things

105
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,040
has created its own genre.

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,760
I’m happy with the second one
just staying in the playroom.
