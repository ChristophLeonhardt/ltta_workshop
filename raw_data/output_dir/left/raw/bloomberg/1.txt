1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
this is an individual that lies on a
consistent basis.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,140
if it was up to me which it's not
I would indict the president.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,220
I'm gonna put Donald Trump on trial.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,580
You are something of a folk hero now.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,900
well wait until we actually accomplish something in the coming months.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,920
Who is Michael Avenatti? Well that really depends on who you ask.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,620
Creepy porn lawyer. He's a lowlife. He's
Donald Trump's worst nightmare...

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,980
He's got a fearlessness right, and he's fighter.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,640
Stormy Daniels court beefcake Michael Avenatti

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,340
but there's one thing we can all agree on

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,180
Michael Avenatti has thrust himself
onto the national scene as

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,000
Donald Trump's most virulent adversary.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,440
I think the president will not serve out his term.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,520
Michael Avenatti's gotten significant traction in his legal battles against

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,980
president Trump and the president's allies .

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,940
Are you trying to win a case or take down a president?

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,740
This is a search for the truth.

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,380
this is the story of how a powerful lawyer and his

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,720
porn star client became Trump's worst
nightmare.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,180
This president has had his eye off the ball now basically from day one.

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,519
But I don't think the president wants to sit

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,760
across a conference room table from
me and answer questions under oath but

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,100
if he does perhaps we can do it this afternoon.

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,740
Now there is one thing Michael avenatti and Donald Trump do have in common- they both love the camera

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,360
He doesn't have much of a political
record but he does know his way around a TV studio.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,920
A day doesn't seem to go by
without at least one news outlet giving

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,400
Mr. avenatti some oxygen and that
unflappable look on his face is no bluff

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,120
it's been cultivated from years of
experience of winning high-profile legal battles

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,140
But how did he get here?

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,460
Michael Avenatti was born in 1971 in Sacramento, California.

31
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,400
Armed with a bachelor's in political science he went to George Washington law school

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,600
and graduated first in his class.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,440
As a high-powered LA attorney he won more
than a billion dollars in judgments for

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,200
his clients including a 10 million
dollar defamation case against Paris Hilton

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,900
and a 40 million dollar
embezzlement lawsuit involving KPMG.

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,240
It was in 2006 when avenatti first went to
battle with Donald Trump .

37
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,480
Avenatti sued Trump and TV producer Mark Burnett for
allegedly stealing his clients idea for

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,780
their hit show The Apprentice.

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,260
The case led to a settlement for an undisclosed amount.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,580
These and other big successes
gained him a reputation for his bold and

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,880
fearless tactics in and out of the
courtroom.

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,840
He spent a couple of years working at a political consulting firm run by rahm emanuel and that was

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,790
where he says that he really learned how to play hardball.

44
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,780
When preparing for cases Avenatti will refer to the title of a book by former Intel CEO Andrew Grove

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,680
which is only the paranoid survive.

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,100
did we mention that he's also a professional race car driver?

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,620
A self-professed adrenaline junkie Avenatti raced in

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,060
over 30 professional races. Though he's
yet to quit his day job one of his teams

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,080
did place seventh in its class in 2015.

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,040
Racing aspirations aside Avenatti claims

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,480
to be motivated by his desire to argue
strong cases for good people.

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,660
one such person turns out to be stormy Daniels

53
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,860
Avenatti burst onto the national stage

54
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,400
this year as a lawyer representing
Stormy Daniels in her hush money case

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,260
involving President Trump.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,300
Are they gotta come out and call my client a liar once again?

57
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,520
I hope they do because we're gonna
double down and I think Michael Cohen as

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,140
I've been saying for some time is gonna
flip on the president.

59
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,700
He scored a huge victory when Michael Cohen pled guilty to campaign finance fraud and named

60
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,800
Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator to
pay off a porn star just prior to the 2016 election.

61
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,840
We're gonna get a chance
to depose Michael Cohen and Donald Trump

62
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,100
Avenatti is banking on the 1998
precedent that got Clinton impeached for

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,200
lying under oath. If that ruling is
upheld Trump may be forced to take the

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,980
stand which Avenatti believes will put
him in a very uncomfortable position

65
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,100
having to choose between either lying
under oath revealing an unseemly

66
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,800
cover-up or trigger a constitutional
crisis by ignoring a subpoena,

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,340
none of which are good options for the president

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,540
but the case hasn't been all victorious-
a federal judge dismissed stormy Daniels

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,420
defamation lawsuit against President
Trump calling her quote horse face and

70
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,060
calling her lawyer third-rate.

71
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,300
but that hasn't deterred a Avenatti's resolve.

72
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,320
He's taken up a number of other legal
challenges to the Trump administration

73
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,660
as well. He's representing multiple cases
involving children separated from their

74
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,380
families in the aftermath of Trump's
crackdown on illegal immigration.

75
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,480
This policy should end immediately.

76
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,200
As well as representing Julie Swetnick in the sexual misconduct allegations against

77
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,740
newly appointed Supreme Court justice, Brent Kavanagh.

78
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,760
All of these women cannot
be lying it doesn't make any sense.

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,320
He's even gone so far as to go justice
Kavanaugh to sue his client.

80
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,160
Are you trying to out Trump Trump by using the media?

81
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,780
But his risky tactics backfired

82
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,180
this time and many Democrats were
furious with avenatti for pushing

83
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,300
unsubstantiated claims which ultimately
helped confirm Kavanaugh.

84
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,720
Certainly his tactics are very Trumpian, he says outrageous things

85
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,120
uses oneupmanship to force the
hands of his opponent just the same way

86
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,820
that President Trump does.

87
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,880
I will tell you that at least one of those women

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,560
claimed to be pregnant at the time.

89
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,640
This way he could be really worthy adversary of the president in the end.

90
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,620
And now there's this.

91
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,120
There's been a lot of attention about whether you're gonna run for president in 2020

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,820
how serious are you at this moment in
time about that?

93
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,000
Just so we're clear on this- the lawyer suing the president is

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,020
considering running for president. Talk
about unprecedented.

95
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,250
Most of the world knows you as the lawyer for a porn star and somebody that goes on cable TV a lot

96
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,380
why should you be taken seriously as a
presidential candidate?

97
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,100
Its not yet clear how serious Avenatti is about running and not just kind of being part of the media circus.

98
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,920
I don't know whether I'm gonna run or whether I'm not gonna run.

99
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,940
but considering the current landscape and landscape in which

100
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,960
President Trump won just two years ago
anything is possible

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,140
you're currently leading the pack among
2020 contenders on the Democratic side.

102
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,420
But Avenatti isn't without controversy himself in October

103
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,400
he was ordered to pay almost five
million dollars to an attorney who

104
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,020
worked with him in its former firm. He's
also reported to owe over 1 million

105
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,240
dollars in federal taxes and corporate
debts while enjoying a lavish lifestyle

106
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,880
not to mention a bitter divorce.

107
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,120
Sleaze bag. Sleaze bag!

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,420
But in the era of Trump where scandals are so normal no one knows if that will even matter.

109
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,180
The Democrats need to fight fire with fire.

110
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,340
When they go low I say we hit
harder.

111
00:06:45,380 --> 00:00:00,000
One thing is certain- Avenatti versus Trump would make great television!
