1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,780
>>DONALD TRUMP CLAIMS HE'D LIKE
TO PUSH FORWARD WITH A

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,430
BIPARTISAN EFFORT ON AN
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND RECENTLY

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,900
CNN HOSTED A PANEL TO DISCUSS
THIS SO-CALLED LEGISLATION, AND

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,369
JOHN PHILLIPS, A CONSERVATIVE
COMMENTATOR AND COLUMNIST, HAD

5
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:22,600
AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ON
WHAT TRUMP SHOULD DO MOVING

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,949
FORWARD ON THIS LEGISLATION.

7
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:25,949
TAKE A LOOK.

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,199
>>I THINK IT'S ALTRUISTIC FOR
HIM TO START OUT WANTING TO GET

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,560
A BIPARTISAN BILL THROUGH BUT HE
SHOULD HAVE A PLAN B READY TO GO

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,170
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S LIKELY TO
FALL APART ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,170
>>WHY?

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,650
>>I SUSPECT DEMOCRATS WILL GO
INTO THIS BEING BOTH GREEDY AND

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,800
DIFFICULT, GREEDY BECAUSE TRUMP
WILL BE LEFT HOLDING THE PRICE

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,430
TAG SO THEY WILL ASK FOR THE
MOON, AND DIFFICULT BECAUSE ONCE

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,860
YOU'VE BEEN PART OF THE
RESISTANCE IT'S HARD TO GO FROM

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,300
SAYING THE GUY SHOULD BE
IMPEACHED TO SAYING THE BRIDGES

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,830
ARE IRRESISTIBLE.

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,210
SO I SUSPECT
HE WILL NEED MORE REPUBLICAN

19
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,150
VOTES THAN HE THINKS HE IS, AND
I WOULD DO THAT BY SPENDING THE

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,609
MONEY IN RED STATES, AND WHEN I
SPEND MONEY AND BLUE STATES I

21
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:09,390
WOULD MAKE SURE TO TARGET THAT
MONEY IN DISTRICTS WHERE

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,130
VULNERABLE REPUBLICANS ARE
RUNNING FOR REELECTION.

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:18,700
>>WOW, THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY,
BLATANTLY POLITICAL.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
I'M NOT

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,380
SAYING THAT IT'S NOT MAY BE A
SMART POLITICAL STRATEGY BUT

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,869
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY ALSO A LOT
OF BLUE STATES THAT NEED THAT

27
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,499
WORK ON THEIR BRIDGES AND ROADS.

28
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:30,499
>>OKAY.

29
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:35,329
>>IF YOU NOTICE IN ONE OF THE
28 CORNERS THAT CNN HAS WAS A

30
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:40,039
GUY WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN SHAKING
HIS HEAD LIKE, WHOA, WHAT THE

31
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,909
HELL WAS THAT SUGGESTION?

32
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,520
THAT
THE REPUBLICANS ARE JUST.

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
THESE

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:58,450
ARE NOT NORMAL TIMES, IF OBAMA
HAD GONE OUT AND SAID I'M JUST

35
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,920
GOING TO GIVE BLACKS EVERYTHING
AND WHITES WHO VOTED AGAINST ME

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,840
I WON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING,
HEADS WOULD'VE EXPLODED.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
AS THEY

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,199
SHOULD BE.

39
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,690
IF HE SAID I ONLY
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,250
FOR ME, NOT THE PEOPLE WHO
DIDN'T. A CLASSIC LINE

41
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,010
PRESIDENTS SAY IS I'M GOING TO
REPRESENT EVERYBODY.

42
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,010
TRUMP AND

43
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,730
THESE CONSERVATIVES, THEY DON'T
BELIEVE IT, THEY DON'T CARE.

44
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,730
IF

45
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,620
YOUR BRIDGE COLLAPSES IN A BLUE
STATE, THEY DON'T CARE.

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,620
THEY

47
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,520
DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU, THEY'VE
NEVER CARED ABOUT YOU.

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,280
>>LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THE
MORAL AND ETHICAL COMPONENT TO

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,170
THIS BECAUSE REMEMBER, THIS
ISN'T TAXPAYER MONEY THAT'S BEEN

50
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,480
CONTRIBUTED TO FEDERAL COFFERS
BY REPUBLICANS OR PEOPLE IN RED

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,330
STATES, THIS IS MONEY THAT'S
BEEN CONTRIBUTED BY PEOPLE OF

52
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,530
ALL POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES, ALL
POLITICAL LEANINGS.

53
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,530
THIS IS OUR

54
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,830
HARD EARNED MONEY THAT GOES TO
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND IT'S

55
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,010
SUPPOSED TO BE SPENT ON THINGS
THAT BENEFIT US AS A COUNTRY AND

56
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,510
BENEFIT OUR LIVES REGARDLESS OF
WHAT OUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION

57
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,010
IS. AND, LOOK, WHEN I TALK ABOUT
THIS, PEOPLE IN RED STATES GET

58
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,290
FIRED UP AND ANGRY, BUT THE
NUMBERS PROVE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO

59
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,810
SAY -- PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN STATES
LIKE CALIFORNIA OR PLACES LIKE

60
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,790
NEW YORK CITY, ALL OF THE AREAS
OF THE COUNTRY THAT THE RED

61
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,590
STATES HATE, THEY CONTRIBUTE A
LOT MORE WHEN IT COMES TO

62
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,590
TAXPAYER MONEY.

63
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,820
AND A LOT OF
THAT TAXPAYER MONEY ACTUALLY

64
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,760
GETS ALLOCATED TO RED STATES IN
THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,010
I'M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT IT
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO SIT

66
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,560
HERE AND SAY I WANT MY TAXPAYER
MONEY TO GO TO ME AND MY PEOPLE

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,930
AND MY POLITICAL AFFILIATION.

68
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,930
NO.

69
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,100
I WANT TAXPAYER MONEY TO GO

70
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,680
TOWARD IMPROVING THE LIVES OF
ALL AMERICANS.

71
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
SO TO SIT THERE

72
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
AND SAY I WANT THIS POLITICAL
STRATEGY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,150
WILL GO AHEAD AND BENEFIT THE
SAME PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR TRUMP,

74
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,930
WHO WILL THEN TURN AROUND AND GO
FOR TRUMP AGAIN FOR REELECTION,

75
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,140
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HE'S
SAYING THERE, IT'S UPSETTING.

76
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,550
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WE ARE SO FAR
REMOVED FROM ETHICS AT THIS

77
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,110
POINT OR MORALS AT THIS POINT,
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND

78
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,110
TO IT.

79
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,250
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
STRATEGY SHOULD BE USED BY

80
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,660
GOODHEARTED PEOPLE WHEN IT'S NOT
A FAIR PLAYING FIELD ANYMORE.

81
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,910
>>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS, IN

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,080
MY OPINION, WE HAVE DISCUSSED
BEFORE, WHAT THEY VIEW TO BE US

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,270
VERSUS THEM.

84
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,730
A LOT OF
CONSERVATIVES HAVE A LIMITED

85
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,840
SCOPE OF US, AND THEY ARE
ACTUALLY VERY GOOD TO THE PEOPLE

86
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,259
IN THAT CIRCLE OF WHAT THEY
CONSIDER US.

87
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,340
THEIR COMMUNITY,

88
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,110
THEIR CHURCH, THEIR FAMILY, THEY
ARE WONDERFUL TO THOSE FOLKS.

89
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,110
SO

90
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,569
THEY AREN'T BAD PEOPLE IN THAT
SENSE.

91
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,340
BUT EVERYONE ELSE IS THE

92
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,370
OTHERS.

93
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,759
IT USED TO BE ON RACIAL
GROUNDS, UNFORTUNATELY FOR A LOT

94
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,830
OF PEOPLE IT STILL IS, AND IT
USED TO BE PEOPLE WHO GOT

95
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,801
DIVORCED, THAT'S AGAINST THE
BIBLE, WE SHUN THEM, THEY ARE NO

96
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,449
LONGER PART OF US.

97
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:03,449
THEN
EVERYBODY GOT DIVORCED, THAT WAS

98
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,610
UNCOMFORTABLE, THEN THEY SORT OF
PICKING ON GAYS, AND ON AND ON

99
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,610
IT GOES.

100
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,020
SO FOR THEM, WHY DID
THE MAJORITY OF TEXAS

101
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,580
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS VOTE
AGAINST RELIEF FOR SUPER STORM

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,830
SANDY THAT HIT THE NORTHEAST?

103
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,129
BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK YOU ARE

104
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:20,550
PART OF THEM.

105
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,310
THEY THINK YOU ARE
THE OTHERS.

106
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,310
AND THEY HAVE NO

107
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,610
EMPATHY FOR YOU.

108
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,610
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU AT ALL.

109
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,610
IF YOU WERE IN

110
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,300
THEIR CHURCH, THEIR COMMUNITY,
THEY WOULD CARE A LOT, IN FACT

111
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,979
THOSE SAME TEXAS REPUBLICANS,
WHEN HURRICANE HARVEY HIT

112
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,990
HOUSTON, ALL VOTED FOR RELIEF
MONEY.

113
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,630
SO IT'S NOT ABOUT

114
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,630
PRINCIPLE.

115
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,199
IF IT'S THEIR PEOPLE,
THEY CARE.

116
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,600
IF IT'S NOT THEIR

117
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,009
PEOPLE, THEY DON'T -- I KNOW IT
DOESN'T COMPUTE FOR

118
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:48,219
PROGRESSIVES, HOW COULD THEY NOT
CARE ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS?

119
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:50,689
WE ARE ALL AMERICANS, WE ARE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

120
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:51,689
NO, TO THEM

121
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,800
THEY AREN'T IN IT TOGETHER WITH
YOU.

122
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
IF YOU LIVE IN CONNECTICUT

123
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,550
OR NEW YORK OR CALIFORNIA YOU
ARE THEM, AND THEY WILL CUT YOUR

124
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,159
MONEY EVEN THOUGH IT'S MAINLY
YOUR MONEY BEING DOLED OUT, THEY

125
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:05,189
WILL TAKE IT FOR THEMSELVES AND
GIVE YOU NOTHING AND THINK THEY

126
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:06,189
ARE GOOD PEOPLE.

127
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:07,780
WHAT, I GOT IT
FOR MY COMMUNITY?

128
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
I ROBBED YOU

129
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,559
TO GET IT BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOU, YOU ARE FROM CONNECTICUT.

130
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,990
WHEREAS PROGRESSIVES HAVE AN
EXPANSIVE VISION OF US.

131
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,990
IT

132
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,509
INCLUDES ALL THE RACES, GENDERS,
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES ALABAMA.

133
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,509
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

134
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,509
HUMAN
BEINGS, AMERICANS, LIVE IN

135
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,059
ALABAMA AND WE CARE ABOUT THEM.

136
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:30,279
SO WHEN THINGS BEFALL THEM, WHEN

137
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,599
THEIR BRIDGES FALL AND THEY GET
HIT BY A HURRICANE, WE WANT TO

138
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,069
HELP THEM BECAUSE WE VIEW THEM
AS PART OF US.

139
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,749
>>IF THE LIBERAL STRATEGIST OR
COMMENTATOR WAS ON THAT PANEL

140
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:47,650
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
BUT SAID THE SAME THING AND THE

141
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,569
TABLES ARE FLIPPED AND IT WOULD
BENEFIT BLUE STATES, I WOULD BE

142
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,309
SO EMBARRASSED.

143
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:55,479
I WOULD BE SO
EMBARRASSED BY THAT.

144
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,479
BECAUSE YOU

145
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,229
ARE PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES.

146
00:06:58,229 --> 00:06:59,729
ARE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A WHOLE

147
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,379
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS
FALLING APART, AND WHEN YOU'RE

148
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:08,129
TALKING ABOUT BRIDGES AND ROADS
-- THINK ABOUT CALIFORNIA, FOR

149
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,129
INSTANCE.

150
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,129
CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES, WE HAVE

151
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:15,129
EARTHQUAKES, YOU HAVE OTHER
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT ARE

152
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:18,160
NOW DEALING WITH EXTREME WEATHER
CONDITIONS THAT OBVIOUSLY NEED

153
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,339
IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR
INFRASTRUCTURE TO WITHSTAND

154
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,439
EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS,
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING

155
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,729
MONEY AWAY FROM CERTAIN PARTS OF
THE COUNTRY, FINALLY GET INTO

156
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,259
OTHER PARTS FOR POLITICAL
STRATEGY, YOU ARE MESSING WITH

157
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,879
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

158
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,439
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE FAILS IN

159
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,379
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
THAT YOU'VE ADVOCATED FOR A CUT

160
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,729
IN FUNDING SO YOU CAN FUNNEL
THAT MONEY INTO OTHER STATES?

161
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,059
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE, IT'S IMMORAL,
IT'S INHUMAN.

162
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,059
I KNOW JOHN

163
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,479
PHILLIPS PERSONALLY.

164
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,869
PERSONALLY,
HE'S NOT A BAD PERSON, YOU KNOW

165
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:48,869
WHAT I'M SAYING?

166
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,599
BUT TO HEAR
THIS KIND OF COMMENTARY, IT'S

167
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,589
JUST -- IT MAKES ME LOSE HOPE
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE ARE NOT HAVING

168
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:57,779
A FAIR DEBATE HERE.

169
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,710
WE ARE NOT
DEBATING IDEAS THAT WOULD

170
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,529
ACTUALLY BENEFIT AMERICANS, WE
ARE DEBATING IDEAS THAT BENEFIT

171
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,530
ONE POLITICAL PARTY INSTEAD OF
AMERICANS AS A WHOLE.

172
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,520
>>BUT THAT GOES TO MY POINT, I
DON'T KNOW JOHN PHILLIPS, BUT MY

173
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,889
GUESS IS HE WAS PERFECTLY NICE
TO YOU BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT

174
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,189
YOU WERE PART OF US.

175
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,139
YOU WERE
HAVING A CORDIAL CONVERSATION

176
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,419
AND RELATIONSHIP AND HE'S LIKE,
OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO PUNCH THIS

177
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:22,610
PERSON IN THE FACE, SHE'S IN MY
CIRCLE, RIGHT?

178
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,610
BUT IF YOU ARE

179
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,479
OUTSIDE MY CIRCLE, AND I WILL
CALL YOU AN OTHER, I DON'T CARE.

180
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,889
AND HE'S WRONG.

181
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,010
DEMOCRATS WON'T
DO A DEAL WITH TRUMP BECAUSE

182
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,030
THEY ARE PART OF THE RESISTANCE?

183
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,070
HAVE YOU MET THE DEMOCRATS?

184
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,000
THOSE CORPORATE DEMOCRATS CAN'T
WAIT TO STRIKE A DEAL.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
12 OF

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,810
THEM JUST COSPONSORED A BILL TO
TO DEREGULATE THE BANKS.

187
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,810
SO YES,

188
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,630
YOU WILL HAVE BIPARTISAN
AGREEMENT THE MINUTE YOU'RE

189
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,440
GOING TO HELP ALL THEIR DONORS.

190
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM

191
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,149
HERE IS, THE INFRA-STRUCTURE
BILL, SOME PORTIONS OF IT MIGHT

192
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,570
ACTUALLY HELP THEM IN BEINGS AND
NOT CORPORATE DONORS.

193
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,570
BUT BY THE

194
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,250
WAY DON'T BET ON IT, TRUMP'S
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL IS MAINLY

195
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,660
MEANT TO PRIVATIZE ALL OF OUR
ROADS AND BRIDGES, ETC., SO YOU

196
00:09:09,660 --> 00:00:00,000
PAY TOLLS AND TAXES ON THEM FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
