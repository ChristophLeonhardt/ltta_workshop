00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,809
frustration as I really find myself

incapable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of formulating a proper</font>

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,100
sentence and then get crossed myself and

then delete like the whole sentence and

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,719
then I caused myself bodily harm by

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,860
whacking myself in the head which is

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually really painful and I didn't</font>
