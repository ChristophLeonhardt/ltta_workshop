ENEMIES STILL SMEAR AND BELITTLE

00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:43,408
THE BIG CHANGES THAT ARE BEING

18
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:43,775

00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,981

00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:57,889
FIRST LET'S GET TO THE BREAKING

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,189
NEWS.

23
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:58,957
PRESIDENT TRUMP INTERVIEW ON 60

24
00:00:58,958 --> 00:00:59,290
MINUTES.

25
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,024
HE OFFERED A FIERCE DEFENSE OF

26
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:00,758
HIS ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON

27
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,861
NORTH KOREA, RUSSIA, TREY, AND

28
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:03,962
MORE.

29
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,765
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

30
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:14,105
THEY PRESS FOR THE 2016

31
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:17,942
ELECTION.

32
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:19,177
>> WELL, THEY METAL BUT I THINK

33
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:24,616
CHINA METAL TWO.

34
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,450
>> WHY DO YOU THINK CHINA METAL?

35
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:30,922
>> I THINK CHINA METAL ALSO.

36
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:31,689
I THINK FRANKLY, CHINA IS A

37
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,223
BIGGER PROBLEM.

38
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:35,393
>> YOUR DIVERTING THE RUSSIAN

39
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:35,693
THING.

40
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:37,095
I'M SAYING RUSSIA BUT I'M ALSO

41
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:45,069
SEEING CHINA.

42
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,537
>> STEVE: CHINA.

43
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,304
AMONG OTHER THINGS THE PRESIDENT

44
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:47,038
SAID HE HAS NO PLANS TO SHUT

45
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,208
DOWN THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION AND

46
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:50,909
PREMISES PUNISHMENT TO SAUDI

47
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,310
ARABIA IF IT TURNS OUT THEY

48
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,012
MURDERED THE REPORTER.

49
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:58,116
MARCO RUBIO WAS OUT TODAY WITH A

50
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,686
STRONG MESSAGE.

51
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:02,420
>> NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH

52
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:03,454
CAREFULLY BUT IT NEEDS TO BE

53
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:06,190
STRONG, RECIPROCAL AND LIVE UP

54
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:08,993
TO THE LEVEL OF THE OUTRAGE AND

55
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:09,794
THE CRIMINALITY IF IN FACT THIS

56
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:15,867
IS PROVEN TO BE TRUE.

57
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:16,568
I'M GLAD THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T

58
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,468
TIE HIS HANDS BUT IT NEEDS TO BE

59
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:18,036
STRONG AND MEANINGFUL.

60
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:18,670
IT CAN'T BE SYMBOLIC.

61
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:27,445
>> LET'S BREAK THAT DOWN.

62
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:27,845
WITH JASON.

63
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:28,646
JASON, THERE'S SO MUCH IN THERE.

64
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:32,951
I WANTED TO START ON THE SAUDI

65
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:33,318
SITUATION.

66
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,052
SEEMS TO ME THERE'S AN OBVIOUS

67
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:34,752
NARRATIVE BEING PUT FORWARD.

68
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:40,425
I WAS WATCHING ALL DAY AND THAT

69
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,326
IS THERE TRYING TO MAKE OUT THAT

70
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,093
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SOMEHOW BEING

71
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:43,194
SOFT ON SAUDI ARABIA.

72
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:46,731
BECAUSE THERE'S FINANCIAL TIES

73
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:47,465
THERE'S COMPROMISE OVER THAT

74
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,934
WERE BEING USED.

75
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:52,804
THERE TRYING IT TREATED LIKE

76
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,137
RUSSIA.

77
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:53,905
HE LITERALLY SAID THERE WILL BE

78
00:02:53,906 --> 00:03:02,847
SEVERE PUNISHMENT IF IT TURNED

79
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:03,348
OUT THIS HAPPEN.

80
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,082
I THINK IT'S RUSSIA ALL OVER

81
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:04,449
AGAIN.

82
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,149
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

83
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,883
JUMPED ON THIS WITHOUT KNOWING

84
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,186
ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE.

85
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:08,953
I THINK THE PRESIDENT STRUCK THE

86
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:12,790
RIGHT TONE.

87
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,358
MARCO RUBIO IS RIGHT.

88
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,627
HAS TO BE MEASURED, CALCULATED,

89
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,129
PRECISE.

90
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,830
IT CAN'T BE SYMBOLIC OR AN

91
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:19,197
OVERREACH.

92
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,865
IT'S VERY SERIOUS SITUATION.

93
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,334
WE ARE ALSO FRIENDS WITH THE

94
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,603
SAUDI.

95
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:26,337
NEVERTHELESS, THIS BEHAVIOR IS

96
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:29,774
ABHORRENT, CANNOT BE STOOD FOR

97
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:30,642
AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A UNITED

98
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:34,612
STATES RESPONSE.

99
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:35,213
>> STEVE: THAT'S RIGHT.

100
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,382
HE SAID THAT RIGHT FROM THE WORD

101
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:37,649
GO.

102
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:45,623
THIS IS REALLY OUTRAGEOUS.

103
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:48,726
IT'S AS IF TO APPEAR HE'S BEING

104
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:49,327
SOFT ON A ROGUE REGIME.

105
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,061
I JUST WANTED TO SWITCH TO

106
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,997
ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THE

107
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:53,364
INTERVIEW.

108
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,132
THE GENERAL MATTIS ASPECT WHERE

109
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,933
HE BASICALLY SAID WE DON'T HAVE

110
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,870
TO CLICK THERE BUT THEY HAVE

111
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,807
SEEN IT I KNOW HE'S MIGHT GO,

112
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:05,376
HE'S BASICALLY A DEMOCRAT.

113
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:09,113
VERY POSITIVE ABOUT HIM BUT OPEN

114
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:09,914
TO THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE

115
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,518
LEAVING HIS CABINET.

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,185
>> GENERAL MATTIS AS WELL

117
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:15,987
REVERED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

118
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:16,287
AISLE.

119
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:21,159
THAT'S WHY HE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY

120
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,526
CONFIRMED.

121
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,260
HE HAS DONE A GREAT SERVICE FOR

122
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,361
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

123
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:28,132
SAD TO SEE HIM GO.

124
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:28,966
HE SERVED A FEW YEARS IN THAT

125
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,835
POSITION AND THEN MOVE ON.

126
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:31,636
I THINK HE'S BEEN STRONG AND A

127
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,372
GOOD LEADER.

128
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:35,173
IT'S HELPED US WITH NORTH KOREA,

129
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:39,711
IRAN AND A ROUND THE WORLD.

130
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,411
IT'S HELPED WITH THE FUNDING

131
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,680
THAT CONGRESS HAS UPPED TO GET

132
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:46,384
OUR MILITARY BACK IN STRENGTH

133
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,586
AFTER BEING DECIMATED BY THE

134
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:49,921
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

135
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:50,621
>> STEVE: HE SAW THE PRESIDENT

136
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:52,957
GETTING FIRED UP ABOUT THE WAY

137
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,227
HE WAS BEING PRESSED ON RUSSIAN

138
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:56,961
MEDDLING MAKING THE POINT THAT

139
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,529
CHINA HAS AS WELL.

140
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,966
IT'S INTERESTING THAT STORYLINE

141
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:02,667
OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING THEY

142
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:06,571
LITERALLY CAN'T MONICO EVEN

143
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,972
THOUGH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF

144
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,174
THAT.

145
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:20,885
IT STRIKING WAS ALMOST THE ONLY

146
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:21,652
THING HIS CRITICS IN THE MEDIA

147
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:22,453
AND ELSEWHERE CAN TALK ABOUT.

148
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:23,187
>> THERE'S NO WAY THAT LESLIE

149
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:23,921
STAHL WOULD'VE TREATED PRESIDENT

150
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:26,057
OBAMA THAT WAY.

151
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:26,758
ANYBODY WHO IS SERIOUS ABOUT

152
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,558
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON IN

153
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,960
THE CYBER WORLD UNDERSTANDS

154
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:33,197
CHINA'S A BIGGER THREAT.

155
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,031
NO DOUBT THAT RUSSIA IS A THREAT

156
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:37,368
AND THEY DID TRY TO METAL.

157
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:42,039
BUT THE CHINESE, DONALD TRUMP IS

158
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,775
RIGHT.

159
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,375
IF ANYBODY SERIOUS ABOUT

160
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:45,042
UNDERSTANDING CYBERSECURITY

161
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,077
UNDERSTAND CHINA HAS A BIG ROLE.

162
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:50,848
THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT AND I

163
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:51,549
THOUGHT LESLIE OVERSTEPPED HER

164
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,683
BOUNDS BY INTERRUPTING THE

165
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:53,117
PRESIDENT.

166
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,486
>> I AGREE ABOUT THAT.

167
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:58,156
ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVES FROM

168
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:04,529
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS THEY HAVE

169
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,263
REVERSED DECADES OF THE FAILED

170
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,164
CHINA POLICY AND HAVE GOTTEN

171
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:11,636
INCREDIBLY TOUGH.

172
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,104
IT'S A REALLY BIG

173
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:13,571
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

174
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:20,311
ONE LAST QUESTION, WITH YOUR

175
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,012
POLITICAL HANNAH I'M LOOKING

176
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:21,746
FORWARD TO THE CRUCIAL MIDTERMS,

177
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,447
WHERE DO YOU THINK IT ALL STANDS

178
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:27,952
RIGHT NOW?

179
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:28,686
>> I THINK ENTHUSIASM IS THE

180
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:29,487
BIGGEST FACTOR IN THE LAST THREE

181
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:34,058
OR FOUR WEEKS OF AN ELECTION.

182
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,726
I THINK THE MOB RULE YOU SEE

183
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:36,394
HAPPENING FROM THE DEMOCRATS

184
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,730
TURNS OFF THE INDEPENDENTS AND

185
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:40,464
CENTRIST WHO WILL DETERMINE THE

186
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:40,832
ELECTION.

187
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,700
I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE GINNED

188
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,535
UP AFTER THEY SAW THE WAY JUDGE

189
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:47,471
KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED.

190
