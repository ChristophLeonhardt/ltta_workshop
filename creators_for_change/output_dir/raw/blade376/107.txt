00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
hey everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,240
start this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video I guess I could quickly</font>

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,919
mention what this video originally was

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,360
going to be about which is

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,179
procrastination I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very severe case</font>

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,480
of it the past seven years because seven

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,130
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I completed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site called the</font>

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,590
Duke of Edinburgh gold award which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,150
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got an expedition you do</font>

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,080
physical training<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sports activities</font>

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,490
you do volunteering work and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a</font>

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,410
two-year period and in then you learn a

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,360
skill for me it was learning to drum and

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,520
all I had to do was send off the booklet

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,469
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> invited to the palace and be</font>

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,140
presented with the award I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on</font>

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,239
to do lists I've had it on my wall and

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,480
my dad has said just get it done all I

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,210
had to do was send it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and seven</font>

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,989
years later um three days before the

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,940
inform you that i received confirmation

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,409
of your gold award from the regional

26
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,220
officer many congratulations so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,740
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I was just going to ask if</font>

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,299
other people suffer of procrastination

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,119
because it's quite common but seven

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,470
years is quite extreme<font color="#E5E5E5"> they yeah I got</font>

31
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,170
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so yay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and I turned 25</font>

32
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,890
tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a big deal because 25</font>

33
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,040
is a quarter of a century had to think

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,530
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't I'm in a very</font>

35
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,950
emotional state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind because I'm this</font>

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,810
morning a very close person in my life

37
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,820
passed away and it's been quite

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,700
difficult to deal with and they were

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,210
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> just twice my age which for me is a</font>

40
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,020
very young age<font color="#CCCCCC"> too dire I lost my best</font>

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,820
friend at 16 so obviously that is an

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,670
extreme version of you know what it is

43
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,350
to die young<font color="#E5E5E5"> death is just it's a</font>

44
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,899
certainty in life yet it's something

45
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,910
that is is so hard to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

46
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's that that final</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goodbye and</font>

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,890
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't get to say</font>

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,590
final goodbye it could be coming out of

49
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,750
the blue sometimes it's expected and

50
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,730
then it's the knowing that eventually it

51
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,900
will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> about there's no ideal</font>

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,600
situation for death really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live with</font>

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,200
rare circumstances like euthanasia but

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,390
even in those cases it would be more

55
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,490
ideal to just have a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality of</font>

56
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's been a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,640
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do videos about recently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,489
organized a UK lecture tool that I'm

59
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,230
doing I'm actually taking a week out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

60
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last week holiday I have from the</font>

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,370
year from work<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it resets on</font>

62
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,950
April it's not from this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

63
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,130
be a bit scary if I used all my vacation

64
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,730
before the end of februari and it's a my

65
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,260
talks about empathy and using the

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,269
internet to connect people<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

67
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,220
world it's something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked</font>

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,590
about on my videos for the past five

69
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,519
years and empathy for me is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

70
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,200
aspect of how we bring the world

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,320
together because empathy on a biological

72
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,690
level is mirror neurons that are inside

73
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,400
us it's the fact that we can look at

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,239
another human being or an animal another

75
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,780
living organism and when we see them in

76
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,200
pain we relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it we we compare it to</font>

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,549
our own to our own experiences and

78
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,980
therefore you know it's not that when

79
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,840
you grow up in life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a blank</font>

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,430
slate it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have to go oh I</font>

81
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,950
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to experience everything first to</font>

82
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,239
learn from it which is ridiculous

83
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,209
because it's like saying if you jump off

84
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,209
a building there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 stories high</font>

85
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,010
you're gonna die you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

86
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,140
to know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do that</font>

87
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,200
yourself to know the outcome and so

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,209
empathy is a great thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

89
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,640
empathy really explains that the the

90
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,579
moral complexes we have in terms of

91
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,769
treat others as you'd like to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> treated</font>

92
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,358
there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that arguing religion</font>

93
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,238
that morality only exists because of

94
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,740
religion I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to have a debate</font>

95
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if we didn't have</font>

97
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,389
an inner morality of looking out for

98
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,630
each other and having empathy we

99
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about as a species today but</font>

100
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,790
that depends if you believe how long

101
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've been on the planet for and who our</font>

102
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,090
Creator is again I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

103
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,770
into it the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do want to talk</font>

104
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,650
about empathy though is because who I

105
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,320
lost today I I had some really good

106
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,310
chats the past few months they were

107
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who really believed in what I</font>

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,190
stood for I could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye-opening and I</font>

109
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,070
just openly explained what I want to

110
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,680
achieve in life oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about in life</font>

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,660
is people making other people happy and

112
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,030
solving the injustice<font color="#CCCCCC"> as's in justices</font>

113
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,800
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in the world um and how does</font>

114
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,300
this relate to empathy well life's too

115
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,310
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in itself is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson things</font>

116
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,950
can go you just so so quickly and we

117
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">take life for granted and there is a</font>

118
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,130
good reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking life for granted</font>

119
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,919
because if we were worried about life

120
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,500
being too short every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> second we</font>

121
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,160
wouldn't live our lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way</font>

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,169
I guess because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd be just constantly</font>

123
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,539
worried it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to switch</font>

124
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,270
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just get on and live life at a</font>

125
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,830
pace where you're not trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

126
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,289
everything at once you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

127
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,620
have an expectation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you will live a</font>

128
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,740
long time but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same time there's</font>

129
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">an it you know there are extremes on</font>

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,210
both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the spectrum if you were</font>

131
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,860
to worry all the time you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

132
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,090
rushing around trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do everything</font>

133
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,550
going skydiving every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a to put</font>

134
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,020
it as a joke but then the other

135
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,310
extremity is you become so removed<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

136
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality that life is so short that</font>

137
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,760
you just don't care anymore but it you

138
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,280
just don't appreciate life you you don't

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,910
appreciate freedom you don't appreciate

140
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,460
the well-being of your fellow human

141
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,320
beings and I get criticized<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot by</font>

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,360
quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,150
I say friends people that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

144
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,949
friends if I guess I've lost a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

145
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:48,979
friends over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the years when they realize</font>

146
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:51,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> na the thing I've that's happened</font>

147
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,080
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me over the years is I make good</font>

148
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,909
friends of people because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they find</font>

149
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,740
something about me that they like and

150
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,509
then they realize i'm a very intense

151
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,949
person and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually when they had a</font>

158
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,539

159
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:27,169
or that I'm taking life too seriously or

160
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:29,360
I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lighten up when you know I</font>

164
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,270
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware because fee for mankind to</font>

165
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,319
unite to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside the fact that</font>

166
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,750
countries are just lines in the sand the

167
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,639
fact that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> our nationalities and</font>

168
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,919
the flags we waive all burn in some

169
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,120
cases is is a is a form of racism you

170
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,069
know we're showing divisions you know

171
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,539
it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have culture I'm not</font>

172
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:02,779
denying it but nationalities and you

173
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,909
know you could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the global crisis</font>

174
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,509
of economies trying to survive when

175
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,889
they've getting bailed out in the

176
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,589
eurozone it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know your</font>

177
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,770
leaders of your country<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to these</font>

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,240
EU meetings to defend your own national

179
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,560
interest when it shouldn't be about

180
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,449
national interest it has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

181
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,339
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traditional way but it should</font>

182
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,539
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a human interest and I know there's</font>

183
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:34,130
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> real point to this and I was mainly</font>

184
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,110
going to talk about the fact of death

185
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,029
but it was it's more about the lesson of

186
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:44,870
death because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I brought up</font>

187
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,630
empathy was because I explained how

188
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,000
empathy allows us to learn lessons from

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,040
other people's experiences from what we

190
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,660
see around us and I guess by doing this

191
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">video</font>

192
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,670
the pain that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm feeling and expressing</font>

193
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,360
right now about my lost today maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

194
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,449
a little nudge or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reminder that we do</font>

195
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:07,110
have to not take life for granted and

196
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,459
that life can be too sure and turning 25

197
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">tomorrow am I looking forward to it's a</font>

198
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,639
neutral thing really it worries me and

199
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,790
it worries me because I have such big

200
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,279
ideas that i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put into practice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

201
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,339
have these huge concepts I mean stick

202
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,600
aids one that's done well over the past

203
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,870
five years but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very limited and</font>

204
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,399
it's just about finding people that can

205
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a vision possible but we</font>

206
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,230
get so distracted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the television by</font>

207
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,790
gaming by just entertainment you know

208
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,449
buy a cheap offer down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> local pub</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

209
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:47,970
nightclub or all these sort of things we

210
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">get exhausted at work trying to make a</font>

211
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,250
living so we can survive and then we

212
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,019
switch off in the evening<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

213
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,149
talked about mainstream media before and

214
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:59,459
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people go oh yeah miles you go</font>

215
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,870
on about people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be their own</font>

216
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,000
journalists but when i<font color="#E5E5E5"> get home from</font>

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,420
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm exhausted and I don't want to I</font>

218
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,759
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to turn something on and just</font>

219
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,850
veg out that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it doesn't make</font>

220
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">it right we we need to make the effort</font>

221
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,029
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be hard and who I lost</font>

222
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,069
today in the conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had and how</font>

223
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,350
he said he believed in what I did and

224
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,430
that it just opened my<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes and like I</font>

225
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,920
did in my video about recapping<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

226
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,800
year it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

227
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">care of my body and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have been doing it</font>

228
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,459
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care of my mind as well</font>

229
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:44,220
and and it's just let's say well I'm not

230
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I believe it to be the case the</font>

231
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,750
world or the you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> universe has</font>

232
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,519
been around for billions and billions of

233
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,709
years isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it amazing that we're just</font>

234
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:57,540
like a pinpoint in the ocean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know up</font>

235
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to eighty a hundred years if we're lucky</font>

236
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,870
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just make sure you question it</font>

237
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,500
makes you look at the bigger picture and

238
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,220
unfortunately it takes

239
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,700
sometimes death from someone close to

240
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,080
you to really affect you because

241
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,580
obviously if we were affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by every</font>

242
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,620
death on the planet we wouldn't cope we

243
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,710
would suffocate in complete despair I

244
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,200
felt like I de decent point to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

245
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video but I think I just wanted to</font>

246
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,340
get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my chest and I'm sorting out</font>

247
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,050
my UK tour and I'm speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Z day and</font>

248
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,790
the zeitgeist movement does a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

249
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:47,420
every year which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they get</font>

250
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,290
academics from all over the world to

251
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,680
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> about ways in which we can bring</font>

252
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,920
the world together and I've been given a

253
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,600
slot<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that so i'll be giving details</font>

254
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
about it very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon follow me on</font>

255
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter you can contact me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on my</font>

256
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,900
personal facebook now you can subscribe

257
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be doing more videos</font>

258
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,060
more often I don't know I just felt

259
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,680
going into this video I had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

260
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,260
to say I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have said it it's just</font>

261
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,910
some very numb right now and I guess it

262
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,820
just feels good to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but who</font>

263
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,580
I lost meant so much to me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

264
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,380
it always hurts when it's someone that

265
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,390
you really relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and I think to have</font>

266
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:45,260
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life taken so short is a tragedy</font>

267
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,010
but that's the tragic beauty about life

268
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,270
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess because when speaking to another</font>

269
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,130
close relative of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this before</font>

270
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,400
I did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video and she was getting</font>

271
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,100
upset I said it's good to get upset

272
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,840
because if we didn't get upset if we

273
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't worry if we didn't get emotional</font>

274
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,330
when people die then what would we<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

275
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,430
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that we feel emotion</font>

276
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,940
the fact that we feel pain I was

277
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,850
reminded of how I'm never balance time

278
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,730
I've already happy already sad I'd much

279
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,019
rather live this way

280
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,929
it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm alive to be alive is to</font>

281
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,509
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go for it peaks and troughs</font>

282
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,249
because if you're never happy how would

283
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,429
you ever know what's sad is<font color="#E5E5E5"> although</font>

284
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's probably not a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example what</font>

285
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,199
I mean is happiness and sadness is

286
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:43,439
relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for me I know I'm going to</font>

287
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">be okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with dealing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this I know</font>

288
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that my rationale is time only goes in</font>

289
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:52,619
one direction sarnies past is not going

290
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:54,269
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back so you have to move</font>

291
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:57,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the memories the legacy and you</font>

292
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,850
have to be supportive with those that

293
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,189
are still around and it's just about

294
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:06,869
game with the motions or it's about

295
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:11,639
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the emotions so yeah I just</font>

296
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw out there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

long video like this in a long while um

298
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,540
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> care so much and I think getting</font>

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledgement I did from this</font>

person<font color="#E5E5E5"> I it just makes me feel stronger</font>

301
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,179
and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to strive and keep going and me</font>

302
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,100
doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video isn't not to put myself</font>

303
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,029
on a pedestal or to say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee look at me</font>

304
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:43,709
I'm dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> death we all deal with</font>

305
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,889
death it's just my thoughts with

306
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:50,189
youtubers it's a great way of directly

307
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,869
connecting people all you people they're

308
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:53,399
going to be commenting you'd be having

309
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,929
discussions against one another people

310
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,790
geographically isolated around the world

311
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the beauty of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

312
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:02,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge we're now</font>

313
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:04,379
going to see in our lifetime and this is

314
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,009
why I'm excited and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit scared is we</font>

315
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:10,230
have traditions you know religion

316
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">government the education system health</font>

317
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,929
care energy usage the traditions that

318
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,879
have been with us for such long times

319
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,720
and they're being challenged now because

320
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,939
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is tearing down the</font>

321
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,249
international borders it's making<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

322
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:32,819
all around the world declare that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

323
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:34,559
want human rights we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all want to be</font>

324
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,670
treated equal

325
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,620
Lee we want everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have access to</font>

326
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,380
the world's resources we want to live a

327
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,860
more sustainable lifestyle and that's

328
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,990
the challenge and we only have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one life</font>

329
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,260
on this planet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll spend it</font>

330
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,290
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV or watching dogs on</font>

331
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,640
skateboards something that's good to do

332
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,190
that every once in a while but every

333
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,530
time you do something ask yourself are

334
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,540
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing st. worthwhile are you</font>

335
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,520
gonna look back in and feel that that

336
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,350
was time well spent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't mean</font>

337
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,090
you can't switch off you definitely

338
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,370
should switch off I've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a bit</font>

339
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,890
at gaming recently but at the same time

340
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,280
just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> how great would it be if you</font>

341
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,930
look back and you realized you helped

342
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:25,500
shape shape the future and the powers in

343
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,050
our hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's no longer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

344
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,700
elite it's about the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> with access</font>

345
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and it's why I've I'm</font>

346
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,760
paying for I'm out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my money I'm</font>

347
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,710
paying to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the UK and talk at</font>

348
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,900
schools etc and if there's anyone who

349
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,640
would like me to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> your score</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anything and do get in contact through</font>

351
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,690
my email it's on my channel and let's

352
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:51,390
organize this because I have faith and I

353
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,700
think that people that aren't immersed

354
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,920
in empathy people who are switched off

355
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,250
they're not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> blame they just haven't</font>

356
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,560
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that flame inside him lit up and it</font>

357
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,090
definitely happened to me a very long

358
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,280
time ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I guess it's why I do my</font>

359
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,480
videos because I know there's that

360
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,579
moment where yes I get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and it's a</font>

361
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,109
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to do ages ago but I can</font>

362
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,640
never put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I see it in their</font>

363
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,829
eyes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I every time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

364
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,710
conversations with strangers I always

365
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,300
tiptoe carefully and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I bring up</font>

366
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,760
what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and you see in</font>

367
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,470
their eyes once they realize it's the

368
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,349
most empowering thing ever because with

369
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,980
empathy we're all connected now we're

370
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,870
not tribes that you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just us</font>

371
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,550
and in other tribes that were unsure

372
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,250
about it's not now<font color="#E5E5E5"> about religions and</font>

373
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,050
those other religions I mean that does

374
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,120
still exist today and it shouldn't be

375
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,860
about nationalities it shouldn't be

376
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,570
about our country in their country it

377
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,110
should be about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> human race</font>

378
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">verse real enemies such as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> illness</font>

379
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,590
cancer heart disease famine drought all

380
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things those are the real enemies</font>

381
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,520
and those are problems that as a human

382
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,250
race we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can deal with and we shouldn't</font>

383
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,170
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine each other because we're all</font>

384
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:13,770
from the same family and after than

385
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,330
these I got today it's just another

386
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,429
spark just another reminder that life is

387
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:23,010
too short we just got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

388
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,890
of it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that's still about</font>

389
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,919
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future because I don't said</font>

390
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,419
before for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the meaning of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life is to</font>

391
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,490
create legacy whether it's to have

392
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,549
children weather is to educate people

393
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,280
whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a structure like a</font>

394
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,880
hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> business wherever it's to plant</font>

395
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,419
a tree so someone can enjoy the shade

396
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,030
which you won't be able to do that was a

397
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,320
really butchered up version of the

398
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,320
metaphor and I'm gonna stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking now</font>

399
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,690
um but yeah I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all and I feel a</font>

400
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,299
weight was lifted off my shoulder so I'm

401
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,250
a dios the next time and hopefully be

402
00:19:05,250 --> 00:00:00,000
doing small video sink bang
