1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,860
for maximum protection from paralytic polio, three inoculations, the second given not less than two weeks after the first

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,200
A minority of parents believe that the most
life-saving medical advance in history does

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,910
more harm than good.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,020
This group has undermined progress against
disease in Europe and the U.S., and health

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,770
officials worry about further setbacks, considering
who has endorsed the discredited link between

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,869
vaccines and autism.

7
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:25,390
Two years, two years old.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:33,040
a child, a beautiful child went to have the
vaccine and came back and a week later got

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,600
very very sick and now is autistic.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
Here’s the situation…

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,590
The vaccine backlash took off in 1998 when
the medical journal the Lancet published what

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,320
turned out to be a fraudulent study linking
the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine to

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
autism.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,110
The journal retracted the study in 2010, and
UK authorities stripped its author, Andrew

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,110
Wakefield, of his medical license.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,910
Preventable diseases are on the rise again
in the U.S. and Europe.

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,140
The U.S. was measles-free in 2000.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,569
The number of cases spiked to 667 in 2014
though.

19
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:10,049
It's worse in Europe, where there were 4,000
measles cases in 2016.

20
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,549
Whooping cough has remained at elevated levels
in both places since 2012, when it killed

21
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,210
20 people in the U.S. and 10 in the U.K.

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,859
The choice not to vaccinate doesn’t just
affect individual children.

23
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:25,859
Since unvaccinated kids often live in geographic
clusters, groups can lose herd immunity.

24
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,849
That's when a community that is so protected
against a particular pathogen that the pathogen

25
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:31,740
itself dies out in that area.

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,960
If communities lose herd immunity, those who
can’t be vaccinated either for medical reasons

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,369
or because they are too young become susceptible
to infection.

28
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,880
So do those who are immunized, because no
vaccine is 100% effective.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,079
Now here’s the argument…

30
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,789
In the U.S., states set vaccine requirements
for school attendance.

31
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:52,409
Many states offer exemptions for parents who
cite religious or personal beliefs that their

32
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,529
children should not be vaccinated.

33
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:58,639
Some public health specialists support eliminating
these waivers, and in some cases courts have

34
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,639
agreed.

35
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:04,309
In striking down a religious exemption, Mississippi’s
Supreme Court cited an “overriding and compelling

36
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,909
public interest” in keeping children healthy.

37
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,899
Others worry that making vaccinations more
compulsory for school attendance would just

38
00:02:10,899 --> 00:00:00,000
harden the opposition.
