that has been one year since we first
reported on russian-speaking children
found in an orphanage in Iraq following
the brutal military operation there
against Islamic state after the report
was aired we launched a campaign to to
find relatives of those children and
several people did reach out to us
saying that they recognized some of them
this allowed those orphans to reunite
with their families years after their
parents left with them to join ISIL
our correspondent Medina Katya ever
spoke to those families to find out
whether they've managed to move on after
the tragic experience
a year ago two small sisters hadees' and
fatima were brought back to their
grandparents who at the time lost all
hope of ever seeing them again they say
they feel safe here in this house
the sisters look and behave like any
other child of their age
despite their traumatic experience their
playground is now the two rooms upstairs
that were once home for their parents
their grandfather Anvar hasn't changed
two things since they left and now the
girls play surrounded by things that
once belonged to them it's about kids
while the oldest sister hadisha is open
and active fight seemed as quiet and
closed often seeking the comfort of her
grandfather she doesn't let me go
anywhere she says her dad also left in
the morning and never came back in the
evening she tells me how the gas station
where he worked was bombed tells me how
the planes arrived and dropped their box
then left
ideally I'd really tell about Lily Anwar
often speaks about the day in August
2017 when they discovered their beloved
granddaughter's were still alive well
then look at I said if I do your
in May 2015 both of Anwar sons
secretly left Russia to join ISIL his
eldest Roslin took his wife and two
young daughters and never revealed his
true intentions about a week after they
left I received a message from my son
saying they are in Turkey
I replied what do you mean in Turkey
instantly understood everything and felt
terrible this sort of thing happened a
lot at the time a lot of young people
left some when to join militant groups
others went to Iraq or Syria
Roslin often called his father but the
last time he got in touch was when the
fierce fighting began in Mosul a short
time after he and his wife were killed
in a drone strike
leaving Khadija and Fatima all alone
weeks later they turned up in an
orphanage in Baghdad scared and
traumatized they were among the group of
children who could speak Russian RT
reported from that orphanage the story
spread and the children were recognized
gathered I remember when the film crew
arrived and they showed me the footage I
could not believe it I could not believe
that it was possible that my girls could
come back home
despite the joy of the long-awaited
reunion this past year has been
difficult for the family anwar says it's
only now that some of the girls fear is
being left behind hadiza remembers how
difficult and dangerous was to go get
water so when they arrived they were
always thirsty they drank like five
liters of water a day only in these past
two weeks has that stopped and they no
longer wake up at night wanting to drink
there are hundreds of families across
Russia's North Caucasus just like on
Mars searching for grandchildren mainly
fear they will never see them again
yes if there is anything one message one
sign that they are alive you have to
grab it run around fake ask for help
there are good people in the world my
dinner Kershner RT reporting from
russia's republic of dagestan
and that fact was the first in a series
of reports on the fate of the Russian
citizens who fled with their families to
join ISIL because throughout the week
will bring me more stories - on how the
returnees are adapting to life back at
home
