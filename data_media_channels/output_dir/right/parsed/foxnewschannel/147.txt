INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE WE GO.
>> President Trump: I JUST WANT
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO WILL
BE BACK PROBABLY LATE TONIGHT
OR EARLY TOMORROW MORNING.
HE WENT TO TURKEY, HE WENT ALL
OVER.
BUT HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH
THE CROWN PRINCE AND HE IS
GOING TO HAVE A FULL REPORT.
I'M NOT GIVING COVER AT ALL.
WITH THAT SAID SAUDI ARABIA HAS
BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT ALLY OF
OURS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
WE ARE STOPPING IRAN -- WE'RE
STOPPING IRAN.
WE WENT A BIG STEP WHEN WE TOOK
AWAY THE RIDICULOUS DEAL MADE
BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION,
THE IRAN DEAL, $150 BILLION,
1.8 BILLION IN CASH.
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
THEY'RE AN ALLY AND WE HAVE
OTHER GOOD ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.
IF YOU LOOK AT SAUDI ARABIA
THEY'RE AN ALLY, TREMENDOUS
PURCHASERS OF NOT ONLY MILITARY
EQUIPMENT BUT OTHER THINGS.
WHEN I WENT THERE THEY
COMMITTED TO PURCHASE 450
BILLION WORTH OF THING AND $110
BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY.
THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST ORDERS IN
THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY,
PROBABLY THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD.
I DON'T THINK THERE HAS EVER
BEEN EVER ORDER FOR $450
BILLION.
YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY IN SAUDI
ARABIA WHERE THAT COMMITMENT
WAS MADE.
THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT ALLY BUT
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT
HAPPENED, WHERE IS THE FAULT,
AND WE WILL PROBABLY KNOW THAT
BY TEND OF THE WEEK.
MIKE POMPEO IS COMING BACK AND
WE'LL HAVE A LONG TALK.
>> ACROSS THE RIVER IN
VIRGINIA, WHY NOT SEND THE
F.B.I. IN TO FIGURE ALL THIS
OUT?
>> HE WASN'T A CITIZEN OF THIS
COUNTRY FOR ONE THING.
WE'LL DETERMINE THAT.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT
WE HAVE, DO YOU?
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT
WE'VE SENT THE F.B.I.?
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.
WHY WOULD I TELL YOU?
>> YOU ASKED FOR THIS AUDIO,
VIDEO INTELLIGENCE?
>> President Trump: WE HAVE
ASKED FOR IT IF IT EXISTS.
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED THEY
HAVEN'T SENT IT OVER?
>> I'M NOT SURE IT EXISTS,
POSSIBLY DOES.
I'LL HAVE A FULL REPORT ON MIKE
