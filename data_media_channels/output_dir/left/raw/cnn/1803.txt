distinguished delegates welcome to New
York it is a profound honor to stand

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,670
here in my home city as a representative
of the American people to address the

4
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,820
people of the world as millions of our
citizens continue to suffer the effects

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,730
of the devastating hurricanes that have
struck our country I want to begin by

6
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,360
expressing my appreciation to every
leader in this room who has offered

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,000
assistance and aid the American people
are strong and resilient and they will

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,670
emerge from these hardships more
determined than ever before

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,120
fortunately the United States has done
very well since election day last

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,680
November a the stock market is at an
all-time high

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,540
a record unemployment is at its lowest
level in 16 years and because of our

12
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,180
regulatory and other reforms we have
more people working in the United States

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,930
today than ever before
companies are moving back creating job

14
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,020
growth the likes of which our country
has not seen in a very long time and it

15
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,740
has just been announced that we will be
spending almost 700 billion dollars on

16
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,850
our military and defense our military
will soon be the strongest it has ever

17
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:53,210
been for more than 70 years in times of
war and peace the leaders of nations

18
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:59,369
movements and religions have stood
before this assembly like them I intend

19
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,189
to address some of the very serious
threats before us today but also the

20
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,889
enormous potential waiting to be
unleashed we live in a time of

21
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,849
extraordinary

22
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,430
breakthroughs in science technology and
medicine are curing illnesses and

23
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,819
solving problems that prior generations
thought impossible to solve but each day

24
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:34,040
also brings news of growing dangers that
threaten everything we cherish and value

25
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,889
terrorists and extremists have gathered
strength and spread to every region of

26
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:47,010
the planet rogue regimes represented in
this body not only support terrorists

27
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,430
but threaten other nations and their own
people with the most destructive weapons

28
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:02,269
known to humanity Authority and
authoritarian powers seek to collapse

29
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:10,109
the values the systems and alliances
that prevented conflict and tilted the

30
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:18,599
world toward freedom since World War two
international criminal networks traffic

31
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:25,349
drugs weapons people force dislocation
and mass migration threaten our borders

32
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:33,419
and new forms of aggression exploit
technology to Menace our citizens to put

33
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:41,579
it simply we meet at a time of both
immense promise and great peril it is

34
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,519
entirely up to us whether we lift the
world to new heights or let it fall into

35
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:56,609
a valley of disrepair we have it in our
power should we so choose to lift

36
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:01,290
millions from poverty to help our
citizens realize their dreams

37
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,500
and to ensure that new generations of
children are raised free from violence

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:16,259
hatred and fear this institution was
founded in the aftermath of two world

39
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:23,909
wars to help shape this better future it
was based on the vision that diverse

40
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:27,570
nations could cooperate to protect this
of

41
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,050
preserve their security and promote
their prosperity it was in the same

42
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,750
period exactly 70 years ago that the
United States developed the Marshall

43
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:48,740
Plan to help restore Europe those three
beautiful pillars their pillars of peace

44
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:56,130
sovereignty security and prosperity the
Marshall Plan was built on the noble

45
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:03,630
idea that the whole world is safer when
nations are strong independent and free

46
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:11,540
as President Truman said in his message
to Congress at that time our support of

47
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:18,479
European recovery is in full accord with
our support of the United Nations the

48
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,940
success of the United Nations depends
upon the independent strength of its

49
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,270
members to overcome the perils of the
present and to achieve the promise of

50
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,800
the future we must begin with the wisdom
of the past our success depends on a

51
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,229
coalition of strong and independent
nations that embrace their sovereignty

52
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:52,860
to promote security prosperity and peace
for themselves and for the world we do

53
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,639
not expect diverse countries to share
the same cultures traditions or even

54
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,430
systems of government but we do expect
all nations to uphold these two core

55
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,190
sovereign duties to respect the
interests of their own people and the

56
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:18,750
rights of every other sovereign nation
this is the beautiful vision of this

57
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:26,639
institution and this is the foundation
for cooperation and success strong

58
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,120
sovereign nations let diverse countries
with different values different cultures

59
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,900
and different dreams not just coexist
but works side-by-side on the basis of

60
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:47,800
mutual respect strong sovereign nations
let their people take ownership of the

61
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,639
future and control their own destiny and
strong sovereign nations allow

62
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:02,259
individuals to flourish in the fullness
of the life intended by God in America

63
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:09,639
we do not seek to impose our way of life
on anyone but rather to let it shine as

64
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:17,289
an example for everyone to watch this
week gives our country a special reason

65
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:23,740
to take pride in that example we are
celebrating the two hundred and

66
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:30,460
thirtieth anniversary loved'
Constitution the oldest constitution

67
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,910
still in use in the world today this
timeless document has been the

68
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,099
foundation of peace prosperity and
freedom for the Americans and for

69
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:45,729
countless millions around the globe
whose own countries have found

70
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:52,229
inspiration in its respect for human
nature human dignity and the rule of law

71
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:58,840
the greatest in the United States
Constitution is its first three

72
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:07,949
beautiful words they are We the People
generations of Americans have sacrificed

73
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:15,120
to maintain the promise of those words
the promise of our country and of our

74
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,110
great history in America the people
government the people rule and the

75
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,740
people are sovereign I was elected not
to take power but to give power to the

76
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,229
American people where it belongs in
foreign affairs we are renewing this

77
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,958
founding principle of sovereignty our
governments first duty is to its people

78
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,990
to our citizens to serve their needs to
ensure their safety to preserve their

79
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,680
rights and to defend their values as
president of the United States I will

80
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,870
always put
America first just like you as the

81
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:06,339
leaders of your countries will always
and should always put your country's

82
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:08,880
first

83
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:18,369
all responsible leaders have an
obligation to serve their own citizens

84
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:24,239
and the nation-state remains the best
vehicle for elevating the human

85
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:31,749
condition but making a better life for
our people also requires us to work

86
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:37,989
together in close harmony and unity to
create a more safe and peaceful future

87
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:44,649
for all people the United States will
forever be a great friend to the world

88
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:52,119
and especially to its allies but we can
no longer be taken advantage of or enter

89
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:59,379
into a one-sided deal where the United
States gets nothing in return as long as

90
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:05,139
I hold this office I will defend
America's interests above all else

91
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:11,559
but in fulfilling our obligations to our
own nations we also realize that it's in

92
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:17,069
everyone's interest to seek a future
where all nations can be sovereign

93
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:24,999
prosperous and secure America does more
than speak for the values expressed in

94
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:32,019
the United Nations Charter our citizens
have paid the ultimate price to defend

95
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:38,610
our freedom and the freedom of many
nations represented in this Great Hall

96
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:44,769
America's devotion is measured on the
battlefields where our young men and

97
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:50,619
women have fought and sacrificed
alongside of our allies from the beaches

98
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:58,360
of Europe to the deserts of the Middle
East to the jungles of Asia it is an

99
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,290
eternal credit to the American character
that even after we and our allies

100
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:10,619
emerged victorious from the bloodiest
war in history we did not seek

101
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:18,689
territorial expansion or attempt to
oppose and impose our way of life on

102
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:26,019
others instead we helped build
institutions such as this one to defend

103
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,459
the
Rinty security and prosperity for all

104
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:38,600
for the diverse nations of the world
this is our hope we want harmony and

105
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:46,490
friendship not conflict and strife we
are guided by outcomes not ideology we

106
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:53,000
have a policy of principled realism
rooted in shared goals interests and

107
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,240
values that realism forces us to
confront a question facing every leader

108
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,680
and nation in this room it is a question
we cannot escape or avoid we will slide

109
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:13,550
down the path of complacency numb to the
challenges threats and even wars that we

110
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:21,110
face or do we have enough strength and
pride to confront those dangers today so

111
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:29,329
that our citizens can enjoy peace and
prosperity tomorrow if we desire to lift

112
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:36,319
up our citizens if we aspire to the
approval of history then we must fulfill

113
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:44,180
our sovereign duties to the people we
faithfully represent we must protect our

114
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,110
nation's their interests and their
futures we must reject threats to

115
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:58,699
sovereignty from the Ukraine to the
South China Sea we must uphold respect

116
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:06,110
for law respect for borders and respect
for culture and the peaceful engagement

117
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:14,480
these allow and just as the founders of
this body intended we must work together

118
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:24,440
and confront together those who threaten
us with chaos turmoil and terror the

119
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,110
scourge of our planet today is a small
group of rogue regimes that violate

120
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,480
every principle on which the United
Nations is based they respect neither

121
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,459
their own citizens nor the sovereign
rights of their countries

122
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:50,060
if the righteous many do not confront
the wicked few then evil will triumph

123
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:56,190
when decent people and nations become
bystanders to history the forces of

124
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:02,759
destruction only gather power and
strength no one has shown more contempt

125
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,759
for other nations and for the well-being
of their own people than the depraved

126
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:16,560
regime in North Korea it is responsible
for the starvation deaths of millions of

127
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,220
North Koreans and for the imprisonment
torture killing and oppression of

128
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,430
countless more
we were all witness to the regime's

129
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:33,600
deadly abuse when an innocent American
college student otto warmbier

130
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:42,839
was returned to america only to die a
few days later we saw it in the

131
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,319
assassination of the dictators brother
using banned nerve agents in an

132
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:56,579
international airport we know it
kidnapped a sweet 13 year old japanese

133
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:03,300
girl from a beach in her own country to
enslave her as a language tutor for

134
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:09,779
North Korea's spies if this is not
twisted enough now North Korea's

135
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:14,759
reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and
ballistic missiles threatens the entire

136
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:21,839
world with unthinkable loss of human
life it is an outrage that some nations

137
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,360
would not only trade with such a regime
but would arm supply and financially

138
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,259
support a country that imperils the
world with nuclear conflict no nation on

139
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:40,259
earth has an interest in seeing this
band of criminals arm itself with

140
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:46,410
nuclear weapons and missiles the United
States has great strength and patience

141
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,829
but if it is forced to defend itself or
its allies we will have no choice but to

142
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:59,460
totally destroy
North Korea rocket man is on a suicide

143
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:06,750
mission for himself and for his regime
the United States is ready willing and

144
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:13,110
able but hopefully this will not be
necessary that's what the United Nations

145
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:23,000
is all about that's what the United
Nations is for let's see how they do it

146
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,470
is time for North Korea to realize that
the denuclearization is its only

147
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,870
acceptable future the United Nations
Security Council recently held two

148
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,380
unanimous 15 - nothing votes adopting
hard-hitting resolutions against North

149
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,170
Korea and I want to thank China and
Russia for joining the vote to impose

150
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,930
sanctions along with all of the other
members of the Security Council thank

151
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:02,550
you to all involved but we must do much
more it is time for all nations to work

152
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:09,720
together to isolate the Kim regime until
it ceases it's hostile behavior we face

153
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,950
this decision not only in North Korea it
is far past time for the nations of the

154
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,930
world to confront another reckless
regime one that speaks openly of mass

155
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:28,319
murder vowing death to America
destruction to Israel and ruined for

156
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:35,340
many leaders and nations in this room
the Iranian government masks a corrupt

157
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:42,210
dictatorship behind the false guise of a
democracy it has turned a wealthy

158
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,180
country with a rich history and culture
into an economically depleted rogue

159
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:56,730
state whose chief exports are violence
bloodshed and chaos the longest

160
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:04,350
suffering victims of Iran's leaders are
in fact its own people rather than use

161
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:11,100
its resources to improve Iranian lives
it's oil profits go to fund Hezbollah

162
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,250
and other terrorists that kill innocent
Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab

163
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:25,440
and Israeli neighbors this wealth which
rightly belongs to Iran's people also

164
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,880
goes to shore up Bashar al-assad's
dictatorship fuel Yemen Civil War and

165
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,730
undermine peace throughout the entire
Middle East

166
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:46,710
we cannot let a murderous regime
continue these destabilizing activities

167
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,220
while building dangerous missiles and we
cannot abide by an agreement if it

168
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:01,280
provides cover for the eventual
construction of a nuclear program

169
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:13,799
the Iran deal was one of the worst and
most one-sided transactions the United

170
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,610
States has ever entered into frankly
that deal is an embarrassment to the

171
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,630
United States and I don't think you've
heard the last of it

172
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,760
believe me it is time for the entire
world

173
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,450
to join us in demanding that Iran's
government end its pursuit of death and

174
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:42,270
destruction it is time for the regime to
free all Americans and citizens of other

175
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:49,470
nations that they have unjustly detained
and above all Iran's government must

176
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:55,710
stop supporting terrorists begin serving
its own people and respect the sovereign

177
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,679
rights of its neighbors the entire world
understands that the good people of Iran

178
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,520
want change and other than the vast
military power of the United States that

179
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:16,200
Iran's people are what their leaders
fear the most this is what causes the

180
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:24,600
regime to restrict internet access tear
down satellite dishes shoot unarmed

181
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:31,860
student protesters and imprison
political reformers oppressive regimes

182
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,809
cannot endure forever and the day will
come when the people will face a choice

183
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:45,750
will they continue down the path of
poverty bloodshed and terror or will the

184
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:52,429
Iranian people return to the nation's
proud roots as a center of civilization

185
00:20:52,429 --> 00:21:00,110
culture and wealth where their people
can be happy and prosperous once again

186
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:06,390
the Iranian regime support for terror is
in stark contrast to the recent

187
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,660
commitments of many of its neighbors to
fight terrorism and halt its finance in

188
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:19,770
Saudi Arabia early last year I was
greatly honored to address

189
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:26,850
the leaders of more than 50 Arab and
Muslim nations we agreed that all

190
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,240
responsible nations must work together
to confront terrorists and the Islamic

191
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,920
extremism that inspires them we will
stop radical Islamic terrorism because

192
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:49,160
we cannot allow it to tear up our nation
and indeed to tear up the entire world

193
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:56,340
we must deny the terrorists safe haven
transit funding and any form of support

194
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:04,290
for their vile and sinister ideology we
must drive them out of our nations it is

195
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:11,570
time to expose and hold responsible
those countries who support and finance

196
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,920
terror groups like Al Qaeda Hezbollah
the Taliban and others that slaughter

197
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,580
innocent people the United States and
our allies are working together

198
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,280
throughout the Middle East to crush the
loser terrorists and stop the

199
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:37,290
reemergence of safe havens they use to
launch attacks on all of our people last

200
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:43,590
month I announced a new strategy for
victory in the fight against this evil

201
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:49,620
in Afghanistan from now on our security
interest will dictate the length and

202
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:56,760
scope of military operations not
arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set

203
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,280
up by politicians
I have also totally changed the rules of

204
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:09,330
engagement in our fight against the
Taliban and other terrorist groups in

205
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:17,040
Syria and Iraq we have made big gains
toward lasting defeat of Isis in fact

206
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,430
our country has achieved more against
Isis in the last eight months than it

207
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:32,790
has in many many years combined we seek
the de-escalation of the Syrian

208
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:39,540
and a political solution that honors the
will of the Syrian people the actions of

209
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:46,800
the criminal regime of Bashar al-assad
including the use of chemical weapons

210
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:54,240
against his own citizens even innocent
children shock the conscience of every

211
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,150
decent person
no society could be safe if banned

212
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:07,590
chemical weapons are allowed to spread
that is why the United States carried

213
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:14,670
out a missile strike on the airbase that
launched the attack we appreciate the

214
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,260
efforts of the United Nations agencies
that are providing vital humanitarian

215
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:27,750
assistance in areas liberated from Isis
and we especially thank Jordan Turkey

216
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:36,540
and Lebanon for their role in hosting
refugees from the Syrian conflict the

217
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:44,010
United States is a compassionate nation
and has spent billions and billions of

218
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:50,760
dollars in helping to support this
effort we seek an approach to refugee

219
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,760
resettlement that is designed to help
these horribly treated people and which

220
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,640
enables their eventual return to their
home countries to be part of the

221
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,630
rebuilding process for the cost of
resettling one refugee in the United

222
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:16,650
States we can assist more than 10 in
their home region out of the goodness of

223
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,450
our hearts we offer financial assistance
to hosting countries in the region and

224
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:27,990
we support recent agreements of the g20
nations that will seek to host refugees

225
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:35,880
as close to their home countries as
possible this is the safe responsible

226
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,060
and humanitarian approach for decades
the United States has dealt with

227
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,669
migration challenges here in the Western
Hemisphere

228
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:52,179
we have learned that over the long term
uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair

229
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:57,909
to both the sending and the receiving
countries for the sending countries it

230
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:05,879
reduces domestic pressure to pursue
needed political and economic reform and

231
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:11,999
drains them of the human capital
necessary to motivate and implement

232
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:18,099
those reforms for the receiving
countries the substantial costs of

233
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:23,889
uncontrolled migration are borne
overwhelmingly by low-income citizens

234
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:31,690
whose concerns are often ignored by both
media and government I want to salute

235
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,619
the work of the United Nations and
seeking to address the problems that

236
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:45,179
cause people to flee from their homes
the United Nations and African Union led

237
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:52,329
peacekeeping missions to have invaluable
contributions in stabilizing conflicts

238
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:57,849
in Africa the United States continues to
lead the world in humanitarian

239
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:06,059
assistance including famine prevention
and relief in South Sudan Somalia and

240
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,409
northern Nigeria and Yemen we have
invested in better health and

241
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:18,399
opportunity all over the world through
programs like PEPFAR which funds AIDS

242
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,339
relief the president's malaria
initiative the global health security

243
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:32,649
agenda the Global Fund to end modern
slavery and the woman entrepreneurs'

244
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:39,099
finance initiative part of our
commitment to empowering women all

245
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:44,969
across the globe we also thank

246
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:57,080
we also thank the secretary-general for
recognizing that the United Nations must

247
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,179
reform if it is to be an effective
partner in confronting threats to

248
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:09,590
sovereignty Security and Prosperity too
often the focus of this organization has

249
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:16,910
not been on results but on bureaucracy
and process in some cases states that

250
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:24,409
seek to subvert this institution's noble
aims have hijacked the very systems that

251
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:31,580
are supposed to advance them for example
it is a massive source of embarrassment

252
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:37,159
to the United Nations that some
governments with egregious human rights

253
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:47,620
records sit on the UN Human Rights
Council the United States is one out of

254
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:54,020
193 countries in the United Nations and
yet we pay 22 percent of the entire

255
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:02,600
budget and more in fact we pay far more
than anybody realizes the United States

256
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:10,220
bears an unfair cost burden but to be
fair if it could actually accomplish all

257
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:19,039
of its stated goals especially the goal
of peace this investment would easily be

258
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:26,000
well worth it major portions of the
world are in conflict and some in fact

259
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,720
are going to hell but the powerful
people in this room under the guidance

260
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,630
and auspices of the United Nations can
solve many of these vicious and complex

261
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:45,470
problems the American people hope that
one day soon the United Nations can be a

262
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:51,710
much more accountable and effective
advocate for human dignity and freedom

263
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:57,710
around the world in the meantime we
believe that no nation should have to

264
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,690
bear a disproportionate share of the
burden militarily

265
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,510
or financially nations of the world must
take a greater role in promoting secure

266
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:14,450
and prosperous societies in their own
regions that is why in the Western

267
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,120
Hemisphere the United States has stood
against the corrupt destabilizing regime

268
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:26,710
in Cuba and embrace the enduring dream
of the Cuban people to live in freedom

269
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:33,500
my administration recently announced
that we will not lift sanctions on the

270
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,580
Cuban government until it makes
fundamental reforms we have also imposed

271
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:46,880
tough calibrated sanctions on the
socialist Maduro regime in venezuela

272
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:54,650
which has brought a once-thriving nation
to the brink of total collapse the

273
00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:00,740
socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro
has inflicted terrible pain and

274
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:07,580
suffering on the good people of that
country this corrupt regime destroyed a

275
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:14,330
prosperous nation by imposing a failed
ideology that has produced poverty and

276
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:21,800
misery everywhere it has been tried to
make matters worse Maduro has defied his

277
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:28,450
own people stealing power from their
elected representatives to preserve his

278
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:35,720
disastrous rule the Venezuelan people
are starving and their country is

279
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:42,830
collapsing their democratic institutions
are being destroyed this situation is

280
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:50,240
completely unacceptable and we cannot
stand by and watch as a responsible

281
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:59,210
neighbor and friend we and all others
have a goal that goal is to help them

282
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:06,470
regain their freedom recover their
country and restore their democracy I

283
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:13,100
would like to thank leaders in this room
for condemning the regime and providing

284
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:19,010
vital support to the Venezuelan people
the United States has taken important

285
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:25,159
steps to hold the regime accountable we
are prepared to take further action if

286
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:31,880
the government of Venezuela persists on
its path to impose authoritarian rule on

287
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,600
the Venezuelan people we are fortunate
to have incredibly strong and healthy

288
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,539
trade relationships with many of the
latin-american countries gathered here

289
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:50,539
today our economic bond forms a critical
foundation for advancing peace and

290
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:58,010
prosperity for all of our people and all
of our neighbors I ask every country

291
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:07,750
represented here today to be prepared to
do more to address this very real crisis

292
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:14,059
we call for the full restoration of
democracy and political freedoms in

293
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,960
Venezuela

294
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,880
the problem in Venezuela is not that
socialism has been poorly implemented

295
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:34,560
but that socialism has been faithfully
implemented

296
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,510
from the Soviet Union to Cuba to
Venezuela

297
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:52,110
wherever true socialism or communism has
been adopted it has delivered anguish

298
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:58,860
and devastation and failure those who
preach the tenants of these discredited

299
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,260
ideologies only contribute to the
continued suffering of the people who

300
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:11,340
live under these cruel systems America
stands with every person living under a

301
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:17,429
brutal regime our respect for
sovereignty is also a call for action

302
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:23,610
all people deserve a government that
cares for their safety their interests

303
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:29,699
and their well-being including their
prosperity in America we seek stronger

304
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:35,789
ties of business and trade with all
nations of goodwill but this trade must

305
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:41,969
be fair and it must be reciprocal for
too long the American people were told

306
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:49,409
that mammoth multinational trade deals
unaccountable international tribunals

307
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:56,569
and powerful global bureaucracies were
the best way to promote their success

308
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:04,340
but as those promises flowed millions of
jobs vanished and thousands of factories

309
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:14,700
disappeared others gamed the system and
broke the rules and our great middle

310
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:22,730
class once the bedrock of American
prosperity was forgotten and left behind

311
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:32,070
but they are forgotten no more and they
will never be forgotten again while

312
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:37,830
America will pursue cooperation and
commerce with other nations we are

313
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:43,980
renewing our commitment to the first
duty of every government the duty of our

314
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,450
citizens this bond is the source of
America's strength and that of every

315
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:57,450
responsible nation represented here too
day if this organization is to have any

316
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,160
hope of successfully confronting the
challenges before us

317
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,960
it will depend as President Truman said
some 70 years ago on the independent

318
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,230
strength of its members if we are to
embrace the opportunities of the future

319
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:22,710
and overcome the present dangers
together there can be no substitute for

320
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:30,300
strong sovereign and independent nations
nations that are rooted in the histories

321
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:37,650
and invested in their destinies nations
that seek allies to be friend not

322
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:45,450
enemies to conquer and most important of
all nations that are home to Patriots to

323
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:50,610
men and women who are willing to
sacrifice for their countries their

324
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:58,350
fellow citizens and for all that is best
in the human spirit in remembering the

325
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,750
great victory that led to this body's
founding we must never forget that those

326
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:11,720
heroes who fought against evil also
fought for the nations that they loved

327
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:19,140
patriotism led the polls to die to save
Poland the French to fight for a free

328
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:25,860
France and the Brits to stand strong for
Britain today if we do not invest

329
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:31,590
ourselves our hearts and our minds in
our nations if we will not build strong

330
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:38,700
families safe communities and healthy
societies for ourselves no one can do it

331
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:46,040
for us we cannot wait for someone else
for faraway countries or far-off

332
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:53,240
bureaucracies we can't do it we must
solve our problems to build our

333
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:59,540
prosperity to secure our future or we
will build vulnerable to decay

334
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:06,060
domination and defeat the true question
for the United Nations today for people

335
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,680
all over the world
who

336
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,050
for better lives for themselves and
their children is a basic one

337
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:19,470
are we still Patriots do we love our
nation's enough to protect their

338
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:26,520
sovereignty and to take ownership of
their futures do we revere them enough

339
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:34,890
to defend their interests preserve their
cultures and ensure a peaceful world for

340
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:40,620
their citizens one of the greatest
American patriots John Adams wrote that

341
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:47,520
the American Revolution was affected
before the war commenced the Revolution

342
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,390
was in the minds and hearts of the
people that was the moment when America

343
00:38:54,390 --> 00:39:00,720
awoke when we looked around and
understood that we were a nation we

344
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,910
realized who we were what we valued and
what we would give our lives to defend

345
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:14,730
from its very first moments the American
story is the story of what is possible

346
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:21,810
when people take ownership of their
future the United States of America has

347
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:27,090
been among the greatest forces for good
in the history of the world and the

348
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:34,830
greatest defenders of sovereignty
Security and Prosperity for all now we

349
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:43,170
are calling for a great reawakening of
nations for the revival of their spirits

350
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:50,580
their pride their people and their
patriotism history is asking us whether

351
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:59,040
we are up to the task our answer will be
a renewal of will a rediscovery of

352
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,360
resolve and a rebirth of devotion we
need to defeat the enemies of humanity

353
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:17,660
and unlock the potential of life itself
our hope is a word and world of proud

354
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:24,740

duties seek friendship respect others

355
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:30,860
and make common cause in the greatest
shared interest of all a future of
