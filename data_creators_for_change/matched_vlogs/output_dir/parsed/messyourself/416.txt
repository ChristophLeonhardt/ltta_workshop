beyond two souls the story so far if I
had to say how it all began
I might just as well start here mommy
mommy gonna get me and you know money
exists oh my god this is darkish a truth
I know it's hard leaving your home and
your family but here we have a better
chance of understanding what's happening
we can find a way to protect you our age
the agency wants you to join their
military school program at Camp Perry
army no I will not do it
Ryan's gonna take care of you from now
on no Jamal Sheikh Sharif one of the
most dangerous warlords in the country
we have to find him all and eliminate oh
my goodness no silly so easily you
shouldn't see this
but then would I be happy that was OOP
that was your dad a new president Jamal
Sheikh Sharif Jamal Sheikh Sharif when
the most dangerous warlords in the
country the president
use the democratically-elected president
my god
we're not politicians we had our orders
for God's Saints gonna kill us
man
hello everyone how is everyone doing it
is mesh yourself there and today lace
jemand you guys are so excited cuz we
are back with beyond 2 souls baby I yeah
I am having the most fun ever playing
this thank you guys so much for support
again leave a goddamn like as soon as we
hit 15,000 likes I'll up the next row
straight away you guys have been doing
it just as far as 10,000 ok let us see
what happened to Jody okay here's where
we left off
it's Jody okay did she die or did you
know all she landed Jody why are you
crying up she's gonna bring up the fact
that Nathan Dawkins
used me to kill this people's County
what happened where are you is Brighton
with you no no he ran away
you can't run away from them they'll
hunt you down and they'll find you
you've got to come here Johnny we'll
talk I'm here it's over through the
inventory
you tell them that if they try to find
me oh my god
shit we're on like the run from the
government
we got outrun the government oh that was
like the end of the mission okay so
let's see the options I don't get to do
that like last time okay so 75% kiss
Ryan uh okay 90% avoided capture there
was an option we could have been
captured oh my god
79% took weapon from soldier 76% got
rescued on the roof
51% spotted in town 79% spotted at the
checkpoint okay and an undiscovered path
I really want to know what that is I
think future Brandon will we know where
everything is so hey guys a future
Brandon here sorry about the poor
quality you had to rip this footage off
youtube
basically that extra option that we
didn't know was basically Jodie at one
point pulls a gun to her head and she
nearly like kills herself because she
thinks it's the only way of getting out
of this situation so that was the choice
which I never actually did there is
actually no way of completing the
mission complete mission where the dad
doesn't die and Jamal doesn't die okay
that does happen in every single outcome
anyway back to the rest of the video
we want to train on the run
is it bad that I'd like I'm so like
invested in the story that I don't even
want to talk I just want to watch like
