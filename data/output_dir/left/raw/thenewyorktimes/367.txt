1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720


2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,740
If you are a young, sexually
attractive woman who gets

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,050
perhaps unwanted attention,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,120
you know that
appearance matters.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,130
If you are black in America,
you know that image matters.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,010
I didn't see anyone who
had a visible disability

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,450
in the mainstream media.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,410
There are about 2 spots in
a show for black girls out

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,760
of maybe 50.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,850
The conventional ideal
of a beautiful woman

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,950
is a thin white woman.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,650
As I'm getting older,
I'm really noticing

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,860
how the rest of
society must feel

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,530
from looking at these
images of 14-year-olds,

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,380
15-year-olds as the
ideal of beauty.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,190
My understanding of
Fashion Week in general

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,950
is very limited because
as a plus-size model,

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,214
we're never really invited.

19
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:55,630
We've all kind of
been brainwashed

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,540
into thinking like these
Eurocentric Caucasian features

21
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,280
are what is attractive.

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,980
From what I've seen in my
career in the last nine years,

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,280
generally, fit models, most of
the time, they look like me.

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,240
There are things that I did
to compromise my authenticity

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,970
in order to get my foot in the
door, such as straightening

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,090
my hair, changing what I wore.

27
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,470
My first agent here changed my
name from Precious to Victoria.

28
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,204
A lot of the times,
designers and clients

29
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:23,620
don't really know
where to put me.

30
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,520
They're like, is she white?

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,090
Is she black?

32
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,840
I know that there is
like a petite category,

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,750
a plus-size category.

34
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,160
But there isn't, if
any at all, a category

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,480
for people with disabilities.

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,960
I think I'm literally the
biggest blackest model at IMG.

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,070
We need more people that
have more power and influence

38
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,950
to open their mind to
different types of beauty.

39
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,170
I had one guy who wanted
my nipples to look hard

40
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,390
for this shoot to show through.

41
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,290
He literally just grabbed my
nipple, and was like, see?

42
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,460
We need it to be hard.

43
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,740
They would talk about
my body in front of me.

44
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,096
Like they'd say, like,
Julia's very wide .

45
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:06,970
Everyone keep that in
mind, like in a meeting

46
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,761
in front of people.

47
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,669
One of my first test
shoots in New York,

48
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,070
we drove out to the Hamptons.

49
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,490
And nobody told me that it
was going to be topless.

50
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,060
So I shot topless on
the beach, and the

51
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,500
poses he was asking me to do.

52
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,714
And I have never felt so
uncomfortable in my life.

53
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:26,380
Let me help you put
lotion on your back.

54
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,736
But I don't need help
with that, because I

55
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,860
don't need you touching me.

56
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,300
I had this moment when I
was like 20 or 21 years old,

57
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,350
and I was like, I understand why
Britney Spears had a meltdown

58
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,300
and shaved her head.

59
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,350
And it's like, you get sick
of people touching you.

60
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,320


61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,010
Some people would say that
people in the industry

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,760
have confused being new and
having a moment with age.

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,140
Other people would say
that adolescent girls have

64
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,420
sort of a pre-pubescent physique
that is favored by designers.

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,820
The fashion industry seems
to have this obsession

66
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,350
with extreme youth.

67
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,850
I was a 16-year-old.

68
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,580
I was at Disneyland
on a camp trip,

69
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,390
and I had to rush to New
York to shoot an editorial.

70
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,250
Showed up to set, and
it was S&M inspired.

71
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,450
And it was just this table of
anything you could think of.

72
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,560
It was whips, and
cuffs, and various balls

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,660
for various activities.

74
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,090
And oh my god, I was
just like bright red.

75
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,510
When I was young, I
shot was someone who

76
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,280
went to jail for pedophilia.

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,150
So that was really
difficult to hear,

78
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,330
because he shot a
lot of young women.

79
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,720
I was at a casting yesterday
that felt like a cattle call.

80
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,750
And I was looking around,
and I felt like everyone

81
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,770
must have been 16, 17, 18.

82
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,640
And here am I, like past
25, really questioning,

83
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,080
am I still beautiful?

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,340
Do I still hold worth?

85
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,240
I think that too often,
models are trivialized,

86
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,130
and our concerns are dismissed
because we're young women.

87
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,160
People would not have been
able to turn a blind eye

88
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,820
if this were a
male-dominated industry.

89
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,230
Fashion is becoming a
little more diverse,

90
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,550
but we still have
a long way to go.

91
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,660
We have to tokenize
in order to normalize.

92
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:33,860
But I don't want this shift
to be commodified as a trend.

93
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,540
I want it to be a reality.

94
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,490
I think that women, they forget
that they have consumer power.

95
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,350
And if they stop buying
into the women's magazines

96
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,620
that are always like, lose
15 pounds in two weeks.

97
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,090
Why do we have to do that?

98
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,150
I believe that everything
starts with self-love,

99
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,391
and that's what the decision
to wear my hair natural really

100
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:55,890
taught me.

101
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm a model, but I can
also be a role model.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,730
Being a role model isn't
about showing people

103
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,230
how to look like you.

104
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,870
Being a role model is
about using your freedom

105
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,450
to show other people it's
safe to be themselves.

106
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,070
My imagery is my activism.

107
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,765
Like, how could
you like yourself?

108
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:12,500
I like myself.

109
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,520
How could she wear that?

110
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,270
I'm wearing it.

111
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,110
In my mind, I'm competing
with the Naomi Campbells

112
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,240
and the Kate Mosses
of the world.

113
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,070
Just because, why not?

114
00:05:23,070 --> 00:00:00,000
