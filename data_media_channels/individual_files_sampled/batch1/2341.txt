do you think there are over or under 6000 jelly beans in this jar how many jelly beans do you think there are exactly write your answer down this is why are we all so stupid the show that explores the cognitive biases that lead us to make irrational decisions I'm Sara silverstein and I'm Adam grant anchoring is a bias that we all face where whenever we're exposed to an estimate we then make our own estimates sort of too close to that and we don't adjust enough so you know when you think about setting salaries you're unduly influenced by last year's salaries when you think about budgets right whatever your budget was the previous year that serves as an anchor that sort of pulls you in that direction even if last year's economy or market was nothing like this years today we're interested in jelly beans we are gonna get a lot of jelly beans we're gonna fill a candy jar and see how good people are at guessing the number of jelly beans in the jar first we're gonna try to anchor their answers to a really high number or a really low number by asking them if they think there are over under a number of jelly beans before we ask them to guess we're expecting people's guesses to be tied to that number we anchor them - do you think there are over or under 6,000 jelly beans in this jar under under over under under under definitely under 6,000 jelly beans in this jar and how many do you think there are if you had to guess exactly uh there are okay I can't say that like there are I think it's four thousand nine hundred and eighty I'm trying to count this first layer up here and which is around fifty to sixty five hundred forty five hundred great how'd you come up with that I have no idea this would be around five thousand and three hundred and twenty-eight do you think there are over under fifteen hundred jelly beans in this jar under under over under Oh / I would say they're probably under $1500 beans in the DAR okay and how many do you think there are exactly 532 1435 on earth how did you come up with that had no idea I have I think there's more 1500 less than five thousand there's 20 by 20 which is 400 and then I didn't get to count this way twelve hundred thousand okay how'd you come up with that looks like a lot mm-hmm the people that were anchored to 1500 had an average guess of two thousand four hundred and ninety those anchored to the higher number of six thousand had an average guess of three thousand four hundred and twenty seven thirty eight percent higher than the first group or about a thousand jelly beans more so why are we all so stupid so you look at that jar of jelly beans and you have no idea how many are in there and so the moment you hear an estimate you start to say okay well maybe that's in the ballpark right it's kind of like being on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and hearing you know I asked the audience this is what they think now I'm going to adjust whatever my estimate is according to that so in negotiations the evidence is really strong that if I want to know who's gonna win the negotiation what I want to know is who made the first offer and how high or low is it so every dollar higher that the first offer is an average translates to about 50 cents more that you get in the final deal and when I talk with with the executives about this no I don't want it I don't wanna make the first offer I don't want to tip my hand before I see your cards but you forget that the anchor that first offer is a chance to set the terms right and and sort of take charge right you you determine the tone of the negotiation and so you know I had people say well I'm not prepared to make the first offer and my response to that is then you're not prepared to negotiate you don't have to make the first offer right but you want to be in a position where you can anchor the deal in a realm that that fits for your goals and so we see this a lot in salary negotiations we also see it in real estate negotiations there any way to offset the effects of anchoring when you're in negotiation so I had a chance to test this out for years I would you know teach about anchoring and students would ask about countering and so one of these classes that was about to lease a new car and I went in and I said all right this is a chance to put my money where my mouth is and practice one of the things that I've been teaching that has evidence it which is one of the best things you can do when someone anchors you is you can just label the behavior and test your own understanding and so you know go in I have a particular car picked out and I say you know what what's the price on this and the guy throws out a number that I know is you know at least 100 dollars a month more than it should be after doing my homework and so I just I just look at him for a second and I say you know it seems like you're using this technique called anchoring where you come in with an extreme first offer in the hopes of pulling me more in your direction that's not what you're doing is it there's been a difficult person I hope not but I just sat there and waited hmm and yeah 2 or 3 seconds of silence and then he started laughing he said I feel I couldn't fool you here's the real offer but to this day is still the most effective card negotiation I've ever had the actual jellybeans count 3388 beans next time and why are we all so stupid we have chosen two similar wines that cost the same we are labeling each wine but we're lying about how much they cost labeling one is more expensive be sure to follow our page so you don't miss an episode
