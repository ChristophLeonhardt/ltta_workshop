a cartoon baby on a flag has raised the totalitarian hackles of the mayor of Prince Albert Saskatchewan and has landed the city of Prince Albert in a legal battle with a pro-life group who feels they are being discriminated against Prince Albert right-to-life Association is your run-of-the-mill pro-life group they believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death they like babies and they try to help women in need as much as they possibly can they recently participated in a diaper drive on the University of Saskatchewan campus now thinking abortion is harmful is an opinion that over 50% of North Americans hold including women that's about as mainstream as you can get on any opinion anywhere about anything now for 20 years Prince Albert right-to-life association or parla has flown their flag on the courtesy flagpole in Memorial Square at Prince Albert City Hall as part of celebrate life week every single May in 2007 parla changed their old flag to their new flag the new flag features a cartoon baby it's pink and white with the logo of um Burt the unborn the flag also includes the phrase celebrate life week and please let me live now last April just like nineteen other years before parla applied to the city to be able to fly um Burt the unborn on the courtesy pole at Memorial Square instead on May 4th 2017 Prince Albert Mayor Greg Dion told parla that their flag would not be raised as it was not a national flag or a nationally recognized flag so parlous started asking questions why now all of a sudden after 20 years was the mayor citing rules that nobody could find evidence of to block them from flying their baby flag and according to lawyers for parla the Justice Center for constitutional freedoms mayor Greg Dion instead ran off to the media to promise the media that parlous flag would never again grace the city hall flag and that's because the mayor and council were brought to their knees by a literal half dozen pro-choice protesters who demanded to the city that they changed the rules to block the pro-lifers from using the flagpole after two successful decades so now parla is taking the city to court and in response to the whole controversy Prince Albert City Council has now decided to scrap the policy of allowing courtesy flags to fly at Memorial Square at all instead of allowing equal access to everybody City Council has decided to censor everybody the pro-choice protesters basically ruined the use of the flagpole for everybody and the mayor and council were all too happy to just go along with it all those are the kinds of excellent problem-solving skills you really want to see from a municipal government aren't they now given the other flags that have been flown at City Hall controversial or otherwise it seems like the mayor's personal beliefs are superseding any concept of fairness here according to filings by parlous lawyers the city has allowed flags to be flown for many diverse causes including Falun Dafa hunger awareness naturopathic medicine natural Public Works paramedic services motorcycle awareness occupational health and safety LGBT pride gender diversity transgenderism literacy seniors and Saskatchewan Ukrainians now in none of those other instances was the city ever accused by protesters of endorsing those positions not once but that is the main argument being put forward now by advocates of this anti-christian anti pro-life censorship that by just giving them equal space that somehow equals endorsement in Prince Albert pro-lifers and Christians are literally being chased from the public square by a cowardly Council and censorious pro-choice bullies for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just saw there is my daily video that I do here at the rebel but did you know that I have my own weekly full-length show it's aptly called the gun show and we talk about issues facing Canadian families in a way the mainstream media just won't but to get access to my show and the rest of our incredible premium content you need to treat yourself to a rebel subscription today
