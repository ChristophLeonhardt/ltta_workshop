PREMATURELY. 

88
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,065
>> WAS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP 

89
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,168
AT ALL BETWEEN THE VICTIM AND 

90
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:49,501
THE SUSPECT? 

91
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,604
>> NOT THAT WE FOUND. 

92
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:57,110
>> ARE THERE ANY OTHER SUSPECTS 

93
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,777
YOU ARE CONSIDERING? 

94
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,945

BE CHARGED? 

99
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,894
>> IT IS STILL ONGOING SO THERE 

100
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,095
IS A POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY 

101
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:16,896
DEVELOP OTHER SUSPECTS BUT 

102
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,897
RIGHT NOW, NO. 

103
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:28,441

00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,009
>> THESE INCIDENTS ARE 

105
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,845
OBVIOUSLY RARE. 

106
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,514
BUT IT IS BEST TO TAKE 

107
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,050
PRECAUTIONS, TRAVEL IN GROUPS, 

108
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,951
JUST BE AWARE OF YOUR

113
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,367
>> I CANNOT ANSWER THAT RIGHT 

114
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,369
NOW ON SPECIFIC WITNESSES. 

115
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,905
SORRY. 

116
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:07,180

00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,249
ANSWERS ABOUT HOW HE ENTERED 

119
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,252
THE GOLF COURSE. 

120
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,621
>> YOU KNOW HOW LONG HE WAS 

121
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,888
LIVING AT THE GOLF COURSE? 

122
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:16,956
>> THE WOODED AREA NEXT TO THE 

123
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,257
GOLF COURSE, NO I DO NOT. 

124
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,194
>> IS HE CONSIDERED HOMELESS? 

125
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:21,728
>> YES. 

126
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,597
HE WAS LIVING IN A WOODED AREA. 

127
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,033
WE HAVE NO OTHER KNOWN ADDRESS 

128
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,737
FOR HIM. 

129
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,572
THE QUESTION WAS, WHAT SHE 

130
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,841
GOLFING ALONE AND THE ANSWER IS 

131
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,177
YES. 

132
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,648
WE HAVE HAD ENCOUNTERS WITH HIM 

133
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,282
IN THE PAST. 

134
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,016
I DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFICS ON 

135
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,318
HIM ABOUT CRIMINAL RECORD AND 

136
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,087
HOW MANY INSTANCES WE HAVE HAD 

137
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:53,926
WITH HIM. 

138
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:58,231
>> DO YOU KNOW IF HE WAS 

139
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,668
FOLLOWING HER DURING HER 

140
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:02,901
COURSE? 

141
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,470
>> WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG HE 

142
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,872
MAY HAVE FOLLOWED HER. 

143
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,541
>> DID COLDWATER STAFF REPORT 

144
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:16,149
ANY PROBLEMS WITH HIM OR OTHERS?

145
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,583
>> I ACTUALLY DO NOT HAVE 

146
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,885
SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THAT 

147
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,553
RIGHT NOW. THAT IS SOMETHING I 

148
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,090
CAN FOLLOW UP ON THOUGH. 

149
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,326
>> HOW ARE OFFICERS FEELING 

150
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,194
RIGHT NOW AFTER HAVING A 

151
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:32,198
WHIRLWIND OF A DAY LIKE THIS? 

152
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,701
>> CLEARLY IT IS A TOUGH DAY 

153
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,234
FOR OUR OFFICERS. 

154
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,436
WE ARE NOT A LARGE DEPARTMENT. 

155
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,536
HAD A LOT OF OFFICERS WORKING 

156
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,305
VERY LONG HOURS. 

157
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,807
OBVIOUSLY MUCH WORSE FOR FAMILY 

158
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,042
AND FRIENDS DURING A VERY 

159
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,477
UNCERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE 

160
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,012
WE WERE ABLE TO CHARGE THIS 

161
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,480
PERSON. 

162
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,417
VICTIMS FAMILY LIVES IN SPAIN 

163
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:56,589
WHICH LOGISTICALLY MADE IT 

164
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,290
DIFFICULT TO GIVE THEM 

165
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,090
NOTIFICATIONS WHICH WE ARE 

166
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,958
STILL WORKING ON TODAY. 

167
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,727
TOUGH DAY AT -- ALL THE WAY 

168
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,029
AROUND. 

169
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,731
>> DO WE HAVE A TIMELINE ABOUT 

170
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,201
HOW QUICKLY HE SAW HER AND THEN 

171
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,035
ATTACKED HER? 

172
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,138
>> NOT AT THIS TIME. 

173
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,473
THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE 

174
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,807
THINGS WE DO NOT WANT TO 

175
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,209
RELEASE QUITE YET. 

176
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,379
>> WAS HIS DNA FOUND? 

177
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,180
>> DNA RESULTS TAKE QUITE A BIT 

178
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,547
OF TIME. 

179
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,282
BUT THERE WAS THE PRESENCE OF 

180
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,151
BLOOD ON CLOTHING THAT BELONGED 

181
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,087
TO HIM. 

182
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:33,960
>> THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD 

183
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,965
NOT COMMENT ON RIGHT NOW. 

184
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,199
>> A QUESTION FROM ONE OF MY 

185
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,068
COLLEAGUES, WHAT IS IT THAT -- 

186
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:48,040
>> IF ANYBODY WAS OUT IN THE 

187
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,941

ARREST. 

203
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,476
>> I THINK THE PUBLIC ALWAYS 

204
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:28,214

205
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:28,947

00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,582
THEM, I CANNOT ANSWER THAT. 

229
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,049
>> HOW RARE OF A CASE LIKE THIS 

230
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,519
HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 

231
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,953
DAY WHERE PEOPLE COULD'VE SEEN 

232
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,690

>> IT IS RARE, OBVIOUSLY. 

234
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,561
STILL VERY TROUBLING THAT 

235
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,195
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD 

236
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,396
HAPPEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN A 

237
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,831

239
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,974
IT IS AN AWFUL THING THAT HAS 

240
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,042
HAPPENED. I'M NOT SURE WHAT 

241
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:11,484
ELSE I CAN SAY. 

242
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,754
IT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY SEARCHED.

243
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:21,494
>> I CANNOT COMMENT ON ANY 

244
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,595
SPECIFICS OF EVIDENCE WE MAY 

245
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,196
HAVE COLLECTED THAT WE ARE 

246
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,566
STILL LOOKING FOR ANYTHING 

247
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,200
SOMEBODY MAY HAVE. 

248
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,669
WE KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF 

249
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,603
PRIVATE VIDEO OUT THERE. 

250
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,071
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THE 

251
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,907
PUBLIC MAY HAVE, THAT THEY MAY 

252
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,308
HAVE CAUGHT THAT TIME OF DAY WE 

253
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,277
WOULD LIKE TO CHECK IT AND MAKE 

254
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,112

>> WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE CLOSED 

258
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:55,027
THROUGH MOST OF TODAY. 

259
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,629
OUR HOPEIS TO BE ABLE TO TURN 

260
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,431
IT BACK OVER TO THEM BY THE END 

261
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,432
OF THE DAY BUT THINGS COULD 

262
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,333
CHANGE, DEPENDING ON WHAT 

263
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,367
INFORMATION WE GET AND WHAT 

264
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,668
THINGS WE FIND. 

265
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,203

00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,658
WOULD HAPPEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT 

272

IN THE MIDDLE OF AN AREA THAT 

273
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,294
