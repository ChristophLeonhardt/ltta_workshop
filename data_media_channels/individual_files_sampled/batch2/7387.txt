Donald Trump is not a believer in climate change and he has taken actions to prove that including pulling out of the Paris climate Accord now recently he wanted to use an example of whether to make a statement about climate because he's an idiot and doesn't know the difference between those two things in a tweet he said the following in the east it could be the coldest New Year's Eve on record perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old global warming that our country but not other countries was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against bundle up so you guys just so you guys all right so of course whether they had to explain to him NASA had to literally send this quota in on it weather is what conditions of atmosphere are over a short period of time and climate is how that Monsieur behaves over relatively long periods of time you already lost them that's longer than the tweet and even if you read that he biked yeah I got it so it's cold outside I don't get it right because it's not very bright so some facts at the eight warmest years ever have all come since 1998 so this past October was the second warmest October on record first half months of 2017 we're recording NASA the second warmest 10 months ever second only to the year before 2016 and it goes on and on and on 97% of the climate science in the world agree that the climate change is real and man-made look but we're having conversations with a guy incapable of understanding the words were using although he says he has the best words but he thinks that that climate change is a Chinese hoax how do you have a conversation with a guy who's on a different planet like how do you what do you what do you say no China didn't gather 97% of the world's scientists the Norwegians the ones from Botswana and the other guy from Peru they didn't all get them in one room like all right do you all agree to do this hoax so we can trick Donald Trump right I mean how do you it's like going into an insane asylum and trying to reason with people yeah and he's he's not mentally capable of understanding the difference between weather and climate well it's another one that if it wasn't real it would be funny right because on New Year's Eve in New York somebody would be out there watching the ball drop in there freeze and then jokingly they'd be like man we need some of that global warming and like it would be a joke and you'd laugh and but that's not the President of the United States saying it like it's real that's the scary part that he actually says this and like you said Jake no one can explain to him like well you know if the temperature the planet increases you know two degrees then the Arctic ice melts and the oceans rise and we have more hurricanes and like no one I'm sure down at NASA they have a conversation and they like it's your turn your turn to talk to him like no I talked to him last week well there's no way the Trump has ever had a conversation with a NASA scientist yeah there is some lowly intern who has to it's like alright you got to make the call you have to you know it's yeah they're so smart they have to find someone in between because they're like I can't speak as dumb as he understands smart to make this dumb enough for him so we need somebody in the middle who can translate smart to dumb like it's two different language yeah look the the scary part about all of this is when you look at the issue of climate change that the impact of climate change that we're already experiencing in in the context of all the other policies that he's pushing for and has succeeded in so what did Trump have in terms of a legislative win tax cuts for the wealthy and what have we been experiencing more and more of every year extreme weather conditions right weather conditions that have been exacerbated by climate change so increased severity of hurricanes increased severity of wildfires these are all issues that have required federal funding in order to provide disaster relief and scientists are saying a year it's gonna get worse and we just were about to experience a significant cut in funding just so millionaires and billionaires can continue living high off the hog so that that really makes me worried because there will be ramifications to what Trump is doing we're gonna experience them in in the worst ways and I don't want people to suffer but I feel like there's gonna be a lot of suffering because we have an imbecile as our leader and by the way Trump's statements reminded me of a video that we showed you guys back in 2015 of Senator Inhofe who at the time was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee here's what he had to say to you know make a statement about whether or not climate change exists we keep hearing the 2014 has been the warmest year on record I asked the chair you know what this is it's a snowball and that's just from outside here so it's very very cold out very unseasonal so here mr. president catch this mm-hmm well that explains it all because the fact that there's snow in Washington DC in January or February means that global warming doesn't exist I don't know what's wrong with you two there was obvious evidence right there and yet you're still hanging on to this global warming myth let me tell you some if there was global warming you know if global one we really worked like that like suddenly it's 80 degrees every you know how many of us would be moving to Canada tomorrow we'd be like all right it's warm let's get out of here yeah and and there's about a snowball's chance in hell of them understanding the difference between weather and climate so last note on that look on any particularly hot day we could then say okay global warming is real oh it got cold again in the winter I guess it's not real no of course you don't do a day by day you look at the macro picture you look at the overall picture is yeah what not was it hot or cold on one day but was it hot for the entirety of the year what is the trend and do you know what the three hottest years on record are for the last 140 years 2016 2015 2017 so the last three years with three hottest years ever ever in history in our recorded history okay so that's a trend that's climate as opposed to it's snowed on one day I mean these morons then you just move up to the North Pole they're like problem solved well that's that's why words like scientific evidence have made the list of seven dirty words that we're not supposed to be using it yeah never thought about it that way but George Carlin had the seven dirty words and stuff and they were banned because they were dirty right now science is dirty it's a dirty where they literally banned science but the word science-based and evidence-based from some departments in the government that's right we went from like body parts to science being considered dirty if you become a member of The Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now TYT Network comm /join get the whole younger so every day
