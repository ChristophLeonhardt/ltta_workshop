how long do you think it takes before you check the average email that comes in when your work you know most people when asked that question say a number like maybe five minutes maybe 10 minutes the answer based on data is six seconds so on average we check out emails six seconds after they arrive which is a staggering number now it's staggering because when you check your email it takes about 25 minutes on average for you to get back into the zone of maximum productivity which means that if you are writing something or you were thinking about something you were using a creative part of your brain to come up with some great idea if you check an email it's going to take you 25 minutes to get back into that that state of productivity you are in before you check your email so the obvious solution there is that there should be certain times in the day when you check email and there should be large periods of the day where your email program is at all possible is closed it's like going to sleep and being disturbed every few seconds you never really get back into that deep sleep and you end up not being rested and the same thing happened to work overtime if you keep checking your email through the day people who are very productive notice you will never get anything done
