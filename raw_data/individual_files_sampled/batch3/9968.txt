MUELLER'S TEAM RAISED THE PROSPECT OF ISSUING A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA TO COMPEL THE PRESIDENT TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH OATHI TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH OATHF TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH OATHH TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH OATHE DOESN'T SIT DOWN TO TALK. CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROBE. I KNOW WHEN YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INVESTIGATION, YOU CAN LOSE SOME OBJECTIVITY. ARE THEY OBJECTIVE ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS INTERVIEW? DO THEY HAVE AN OPEN MIND TO THE FACT THAT HE COULD BE TELLING THE TRUTH AND COMEY MAY BE LYING? IF THEY HAVE AN OPEN MIND TO THAT, THEN THIS IS SOMETHING WE WOULD CONSIDER. IF THEY DON'T, THEN GIVEN ALL OF THE IRREGULARITIES IN THE INVESTIGATION, WE WOULD BE FOOLISH TO HAVE HIM BE INTERVIEWED. Jesse: HERE ARE SOME STIPULATIONS FOR AN INTERVIEW. WHAT TO YOU WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE PARAMETERS FOR AN INTERVIEW? TWO HOURS. TOPICS? QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE. RELEVANT TOPICS. MEANING RUSSIA, WHICH MAY NOT BE RELEVANT ANY LONGER. WE WANT A COMMITMENT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DECIDE BEFORE THE END OF THE SUMMER SO WE DON'T HAVE THIS DRAG ON AND FURTHER IMPERILED THE PRESIDENCY. Jesse: MR. TRUMP FIRING OFF ON TWITTER ONCE AGAIN. "THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. IT IS A HOAX. AND THERE IS NO OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. THAT IS A SETUP AND TRAP." KIMBERLY, TWO THINGS GOING ON. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE SHAKE-UP OF THE LAWYERS IN A SECOND. IN TERMS OF THE COLLISION COURSE IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE ON, WE ARE EITHER GOING TO HAVE THIS GO ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT OR THEY ARE GOING TO ORCHESTRATE SOME SORT OF CONTROLLED SIT DOWN WITH MUELLER, ONLY TWO HOURS. YOU THINK THOSE ARE THE STAKES? Kimberly: I THINK THIS IS REALLY SMART AND QUITE REASONABLE. NOBODY WANTS TO EVOLVE AWAY AND DRAG IT OUT. I THINK RUDY GIULIANI IS PUTTING SOME REALLY GOOD PARAMETERS AND LIMITS ON IT TO SAY WE WANT TO COOPERATE. WE WANT TO TALK. LET SIT DOWN. LET'S LIMIT THE TIME SCOPE AND HAVE A DISCUSSION AHEAD OF TIME IN TERMS OF HOW IT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED. THEN THE PRESIDENT WILL COOPERATE AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. THAT SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLE, RIGHT? NOT SOMETHING, TWEETS BEING FIRED FOR THIS AND THAT OR ANY BACK AND FORTH. THEY WANT TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT WHAT HE SAID. RUDY GIULIANI SAID AS LONG AS I HAVE AN OPEN MIND, LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT, HAVE A JUMPED TO A FOREGONE CONCLUSION, THEN THEY ARE WILLING TO SIT DOWN. Jesse: HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHETHER MUELLER HAS AN OPEN MIND? Kimberly: HE SHOULD REPLY BACK "I HAVE AN OPEN MIND." Jesse: TY COBB IS OUT. HE WORKED FOR ABOUT A YEAR FOR THE PRESIDENT. HE GOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS TO MUELLER AND HE SET UP ALL THE INTERVIEWS, AND NOW THEY ARE BRINGING IN THIS IMPEACHMENT LAWYER THAT WAS WORKING FOR BILL CLINTON. WHAT SIGNAL DOES IT SENT TO YOU? Dana: HE DIDN'T JUST WORK FOR BILL CLINTON. I KNOW EMMETT FLOOD VERY WELL. HE WORKED IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE AS WELL. I KNOW ABOUT HOW HE THINKS. HE HAS A WONDERFUL, DRY SENSE OF HUMOR, HE IS A VERY LAWYER. WE WERE HAVING THE U.S. ATTORNEY SITUATION WHERE THE DEMOCRATS WERE DEMANDING ALL THE DOCUMENTS. WE WERE TRYING TO PRODUCE THEM AS FAST AS WE COULD. THE SAME EXACT ARGUMENT THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING TODAY AGAINST THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR NOT RELEASING DOCUMENTS, IT'S A MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 2007 AND 2008. I THINK EMMETT IS A MUCH MORE ASSERTIVE AND AGGRESSIVE TYPE OF PERSON. HE KNOWS SPECIAL COUNSEL LAW EXTREMELY WELL. I THINK THERE'S THE FEELING THAT THE ORIGINAL TEAM WAS TOO ACCOMMODATING TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL CHANGE. I THINK WHEN RUDY GIULIANI SAYS THAT THIS WOULD BE A TWO HOUR INTERVIEW AND WE WILL HAVE TO SEE, THE NARROW SCOPE, I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT EMMET FLOOD TALKED TO THEM ABOUT. JAY SEKULOW DID A LOT OF INTERVIEW WITH EMMET TO GET TO THIS POINT. I THINK WE FORGET, IT WAS ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AGO THAT DONALD McGAHN, THE PRESIDENTS WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO BE GONE BY THE SUMMER, THAT HE WOULD STAY UNTIL HE FOUND HIS REPLACEMENT AND THAT COULD EXTEND THE MIDTERM. BUT EMMET FLOOD I THINK WE'LL END UP BEING THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL BEFORE THE END OF THE SUMMER. Jesse: ALL RIGHT. GREG, WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IS, YOU KNOW, I AM PREPARING TO BROKER PEACE ON THE NORTH KOREAN PENINSULA. TRYING TO NEGOTIATE SOMETHING IN SYRIA. TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR SITUATION AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING ME SPEND HOURS PREPPING FOR A SITDOWN AND WASTING MY TIME ON THIS. Greg: YEAH, IT IS LIKE STUDYING FOR THE S.A.T. WHILE YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDE A BIKE. ANYWAY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. HE SHOULD ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS ON TWITTER. THAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD DO. I THINK TWO HOURS IS WAY TOO LONG. I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM ANY TIME. DO IT IN WRITING SOMEHOW. WHAT BOTHERS ME MOST ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE INVESTIGATION, THE MEDIA, THE DEMOCRATS ALL APPEAR TO BE WORKING IN TANDEM. IT'S LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY. THE IRAN DEAL, THE DEMOCRATS PUSH THE MESSAGE, THE MEDIA. WHAT IS THE ECHO IN THE CHAMBER? UNSEAT AND IMPEACH. INSTEAD OF A COUNTER VISION WHICH REQUIRES IDEAS FROM DEMOCRATS. THEY ARE RELYING ON THE OUSTER SWITCH. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS GUY AND THIS IS LATE TO DO IT. YOU ARE POINT, WE ARE PROBABLY IN ONE OF THE MOST OPTIMISTIC PERIODS OF RECENT HISTORY BECAUSE WE ARE WATCHING THE ABSENCE OF ISIS VIDEOS. WE ARE WATCHING THE ABSENCE OF A NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR THREAT. LOOKING AT A STRONG ECONOMY AND DECLINING CRIME OVERALL WHICH IS KIND OF INTERESTING. KIND OF INTERESTING. HAVE THEY ACTUALLY PLANNED THIS OUT? THEY DON'T HAVE TO PLANTED. THEY COULD TRY TO IMPEACH THE GUIDE THAT THEY SHOULD THINK IN THE LONG TERM, WHAT IS IT MEAN OF THE COUNTRY? WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HALF THE COUNTRY? WHAT IS IT MEAN TO THE WORLD. IT'S NOT JUST AN ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES. IF THE WORLD IS GETTING LESS VIOLENT. THE WORLD IS GETTING SAFER BECAUSE OF A REDUCED NORTH KOREAN THREAT. IT'S ABOUT THE WORLD. AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING GLOBALLY? Jesse: YES, JUAN, LET'S THINK GLOBALLY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? Juan: TO ME, IT'S A MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE. YOU ARE BRINGING IN SOMEBODY WHO IS A PUNCHER AND WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT. THE THING IS, I THINK IT'S JAY SEKULOW WHO HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN SAYING TO TY COBB I THINK IT'S TIME TO GO. I THINK YOU HAVE SEEN THE SAME THING WITH JOHN DOWD. BOTH OF THEM KIND OF WERE OF A MIND TO SAY THE PRESIDENT, IF YOU CAN TALK, LET'S TALK, WILL WE DON'T THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND WE COUNSEL AGAINST IT. THE PRESIDENT WASN'T LISTENING BUT AFTER MICHAEL COHEN'S OFFICE WAS RATED, I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS MORE YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE FROM THE LITIGATION PHASE I THINK, FROM THE DISCOVERY PHASE, I SHOULD SAY, TO LITIGATION AND CONFRONTATION.
