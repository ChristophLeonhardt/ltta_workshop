SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS STEPPED
IN IT FOR UNDERSTANDABLE
ISSUES ON THE ISSUE OF STORMY
DANIELS.
THE ADULT ACTRESS WHO HAD AN
AFFAIR WITH DONALD TRUMP
EXPLAINED IN GLORY
DETAIL BACK IN 2011,
DONALD TRUMP GOT HIS LAWYER TO
DO AN NDA.
MICHAEL COHEN SAYS I HAPPEN TO
DO THE NDA AND I'M THE ONE
THAT PAID HER SO OBVIOUSLY THAT
IS WHO IT WAS FOR.
NOW STORMY DANIELS SAYS IT IS
NOT VALID BECAUSE DONALD
TRUMP NEVER SIGNED IT.
IT WAS NOT TO HUSH UP ABOUT
ANYTHING RELATED TO MICHAEL
COHEN THOUGHT IT WAS A HUSH
CONTRACT ABOUT THE AFFAIR
SHE HAD WITH DONALD TRUMP.
SHE IS IN AN IMPOSSIBLE
SITUATION BECAUSE DONALD
TRUMP HAS ASKED HER TO LIE 13
DIFFERENT WAYS SO SHE
ACCIDENTALLY SCREWS UP AND ADMIT
SOMETHING THAT IS TRUE.
DON'T GET ME WRONG SHE'S THE
PRESS SECRETARY 
FOR DONALD
TRUMP.
MADE VERY CLEAR THAT NONE OF
THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE.
AND AGAIN THIS CASE HAS ALREADY
BEEN ONE IN ARBITRATION
ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I WOULD
REFER YOU TO OUTSIDE COUNSEL.
YOU SAID THERE IS ARBITRATION
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN WON?
FOR DETAILS ON THAT I WOULD
REFER YOU THEM.
I CAN SHARE THAT ARBITRATION WAS
ONE IN THE PRESIDENT'S FAVOR.
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE
PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS AND AS I
OUTLINED EARLIER THIS CASE IT
ALREADY BEEN ONE IN ARBITRATION.
OOPS.
THE REPORTER HAD A PUZZLED LOOK
ON HIS FACE AND RIGHTFULLY SO.
IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS
ARBITRATION IN THE CASE WHICH
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SHOULD
NOT HAVE ADMITTED BECAUSE THAT
ADMITS THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS
INVOLVED.
WHAT IS THE UNTRUE
PART OF HER STATEMENT?
THAT HE
WON THE ARBITRATION.
THEY WENT TO AN ARBITRATION
HEARING WITHOUT STORMY DANIELS.
MICHAEL COHEN AND CALLED FOR A
SECRET ARBITRATION MEETING,
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.
SECOND OF ALL THEY DID NOT WIN
IT, THEY GOT A TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER SAYING DON'T
TALK ABOUT THIS IN PUBLIC
UNTIL WE CAN HAVE PROCEEDINGS
AND CONCLUDE THEM.
AND HE DIDN'T SIGN THE CONTRACT
SO YOU CAN'T HAVE AN
ARBITRATION PROCEEDING ABOUT A
CONTRACT THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF HER
WINNING IT, SHE IS WRONG.
THE FACT THAT HAPPENED IS
CORRECT.
THAT THEN MAKES TRUMP APPARENTLY
ANGRY.
CNN'S JIM ACOSTA DOING 
THE MAIN
REPORTING HERE.
SO TODAY OF COURSE THE TRUMP
WHITE HOUSE IS DENYING MAINLY
THROUGH FOX NEWS ñ SOURCES TELL
FOX NEWS THAT SARAH HUCKABEE
SANDERS CAME OUT FOR A
PRESS CONFERENCE ñ
OH THAT'S RIGHT SHE DIDN'T.
IF TRUMP IS NOT UPSET WITH HER
AND THERE IS NO ISSUES THEY
HAVE A CURIOUS WAY OF SHOWING
IT.
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE MORE.
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WHY
TRUMP CARES SO MUCH, HE'S HAD
DOZENS OF AFFAIRS, DOZENS OF
WOMEN ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL
HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT WHICH IS
FAR WORSE THAN ANY AFFAIR.
STORMY DANIELS AND HER LATEST
COURT FILING SAID THAT SHE HAS
TEXTS AND PICTURES, THAT IS WHY
HE WAS TRYING TO COVER IT UP.
THAT IS WHY HE IS UPSET IT
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS FOR
SCREWING UP AND ADMITTING IT IS
REAL.
ONE LAST THING, PEOPLE ARE
GETTING ALL OVER SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS, I WILL DO AN
IRONIC DEFENSE.
THAT JOB IS IMPOSSIBLE.
TRUMP ASKED YOU TO LIE IN BOTH
DIRECTIONS, IT IS NOT DOABLE.
JUMP IS NOT AT ALL INVOLVED
BUT HE WON THE CASE.
GARY COHEN LEFT ñ
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHO CAN SEND THIS GUY.
AND THE PRICE SARAH HUCKABEE
SANDERS HAS HUNG IN THERE
FOR THAT LONG.
IT IS A MISERABLE JOB TO HAVE.
