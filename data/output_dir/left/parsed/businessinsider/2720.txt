so we built the ship and the course had
to go out and test drivers and make sure
all the engines work the air
conditioning and the galleys and the
sewage treatment plants and all the
waste disposal facilities work properly
to make sure the ship is a sustainable
platform at sea which we did and it all
works very well and now is all about
operational as the ship in the future
but I think the greatest privilege for
me really is commanding the ship's
company who have done so much with
industry over the last couple years to
get a ship to where she is today so I'm
a very proud man very excited and very
honored today
you
