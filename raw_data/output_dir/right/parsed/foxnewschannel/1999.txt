OTHER NATIONS INCLUDING THE
UNITED STATES.
BUT CHUCK SCHUMER VOTED AGAINST
IT SO IT DOESN'T JIVE WITH WHERE
HE WAS THEN WITH WHAT HE SAYING
NOW.
BUT LET'S GET A REACTION OUT
FROM THE LOUISIANA SENATOR.
>> IN TERMS OF WHAT SCHUMER SAID
IT, I AGREE WITH YOUR POINT
ABOUT HIS INCONSISTENCY.
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT
IS DOING, THE PRESIDENT IS
MAKING THE CALCULUS.
SINCE THE SANCTIONS ARE RELAXED,
IRAN HAS INCREASED THEIR
ACTIVITIES TO DESTABILIZE
SAUDI ARABIA AND ATTACK ISRAEL.
IT APPEARS THAT HE HAS MADE THE
CALCULUS THAT IF WE REIMPOSE
SANCTIONS THEY ARE LESS LIKELY
TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE FOREIGN
ADVENTURES THAT HAVE DESTABILIZE
THE REGION AND IT TAKES THE RISK
WITH THEM RESTARTING THEIR
NUCLEAR PROGRAM SOONER, NOT
LATER.
>> Shepard: DO YOU BY WHAT
SOMEONE SAID, AND I KNOW THIS
WASN'T FORMALLY A TREATY BUT IT
DOES CALL INTO QUESTION WHETHER
YOU
THE UNITED STATES CAN BE TRUSTED
ON AGREEMENTS OF ANY SORT IF THE
PRESIDENT COMES IN AND RIPS THEM
UP.
>> TYPICALLY THE PRESIDENT COMES
IN AND MAKES BIG CHANGES.
PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE BIG CHANGES
ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S POLICIES.
HE SHOULDN'T DO WHAT A
PRESIDENT OBAMA DOES AND KIND OF
PUSHES IT THROUGH IN A WAY WHICH
IS NOT A TREATY, BECAUSE ONCE
YOU GET THE TREAT OF THAT
REFLECTS AS THE CONSENSUS OF THE
COUNTRY.
IF YOU TRY TO DO IT WITH A PEN
AND A PHONE, ITS EFFECTS ARE
LESS LONG-LASTING.
>> Shepard: THE SECRETARY OF
THE STATE HAS BEEN IN ITALY AND
MUCH OF EUROPE THIS WEEK AND
TODAY, MANY PEOPLE SAID HE WAS
BEHIND THE SCENES WORKING TO GET
FOREIGN LEADERS TO SORT OF
PUSHBACK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> CARRIE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS.
THE FACT IS THAT DOES HAVE
LIMITED INFLUENCE UPON TRUMP,
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP I
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP IA
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP II
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP IG
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP IT
AND I THINK TRUMP       TRUMP IE
CALCULUS.
OBVIOUSLY IN SYRIA, OBVIOUSLY IN
YEMEN, STIRRING UP LOTS OF
TROUBLE.
