>> WE'RE STARTING OFF ON A
NEW FOOTING A WONDERFUL
THING RELEASED THE FOLKS
EARLY.
THAT WAS A BIG THING.
I REALLY THINK WE HAVE A
VERY GOOD CHANCE OF DOING
SOMETHING VERY MEANINGFUL.
I REALLY THINK A LOT OF
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
STEVE: WE'LL SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
THE PRESIDENT SOUNDING VERY
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH NORTH
KOREA AND HIS SUMMIT.
IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE.
LET'S TALK TO WHITE HOUSE
PRESS SECRETARY SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS.
SHE JOINS US FROM THE NORTH
LAWN.
SARAH, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING.
GREAT TO BE WITH YOU GUYS.
STEVE: WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
NORTH KOREA?
>> LOOK, AS THE PRESIDENT
HAS SAID TIME AND TIME
AGAIN, WE'RE READY TO MEET
AND IF IT HAPPENS, THAT'S
GREAT.
AND IF IT DOESN'T, WE WILL
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WE'RE STILL HOPEFUL THAT THE
MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE AND
WE'LL CONTINUE DOWN THAT
PATH.
AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW
THAT WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED
THAT THESE COULD BE TOUGH
NEGOTIATIONS.
THE PRESIDENT IS READY IF
THE MEETING TAKES PLACE.
AND IF IT DOESN'T, WE WILL
CONTINUE THE MAXIMUM
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN THAT'S
BEEN ONGOING.
BRIAN: HOW WOULD YOU
CHARACTERIZE THE PRESIDENT'S
REACTION TO THIS BACK STEP
MAKING UP SOME PROBLEMS WITH
MILITARY EXERCISES THAT HAVE
BEEN ON THE BOOKS COMING UP
WITH COMMENTS ABOUT JOHN
BOLTON THAT'S BEEN SET BACK
IN 2003.
WHAT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S
REACTION WHEN SOME OF THIS
STUFF STARTED COMING OUT?
>> LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS
THE TOUGHEST NEGOTIATOR
AROUND.
HE IS PREPARED TO GO THROUGH
THIS PROCESS.
HIS TEAM IS PREPARED TO GO
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
AND THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY
IN THESE TYPES OF
OPERATIONS.
THE PRESIDENT'S FULLY
PREPARED AND FULL NAMELY
READY TO CARRY ON IN THESE
CONVERSATIONS LEADING UP TO
AND IF THE MEETING TAKES
PLACE.
HE WILL BE READY.
>> WHY WE NEED SOME PEOPLE
IN THESE ROLLS IN THE
ADMINISTRATION.
GINA HASPEL, THE SENATE
INTEL COMMITTEE VOTING ON
HER TODAY.
WE KNOW SHE HAS MADE THE
ROUNDS UP ON THE HILL.
SENT A PERSONAL LETTER TO
MARK WARNER.
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAS THE
VOTES SHE NEEDS, SARAH.
>> IT LOOKS GREAT.
WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC.
WE THINK OBVIOUSLY GINA
HASPEL IS THE MOST QUALIFIED
AND CREDIBLE PERSON THAT YOU
COULD FIND TO RUNT CIA.
WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT HER
TAKING THE HYMN AS THE
TAKING THE HOWN AS THE
TAKING THE HOW MAS THE
TAKING THE HOW MAN THE
TAKING THE HOW MANYTHE
TAKING THE HOW MANY AE
TAKING THE HOW MANY AS
TAKING THE HEL MANY AS
TAKING THE HELMMANY AS
TAKING THE HELM ONY AS
TAKING THE HELM OFY AS
TAKING THE HELM OF AAS
TAKING THE HELM OF ASS
TAKING THE HELM OF AS THE
DIRECTOR OF THIS AGENCY.
FULL FLOOR VOTE TAKING PLACE
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.
WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT AND
OPTIMISTIC PEOPLE ARE
PUTTING NATIONAL SECURITY
AND THE SAFETY AND SECURITY
OF AMERICANS AHEAD OF
PARTISAN POLITICS.
SEVERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE COME
OUT AND SAID THEY WILL
SUPPORT GINA HASPEL.
WE THINK THAT'S A GREAT
THING BECAUSE SHE IS A GREAT
CANDIDATE TO RUN THE CIA AND
WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT HER
TAKING OVER AND MOVING
FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS.
STEVE: WE HEARD FROM THE
PRESIDENT DOING A TWEET A
COUPLE DAYS AGO ABOUT THE
LEAKS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU KNOW, IT ALL GOES BACK
TO ROUGH COMMENT THAT A
MEMBER OF THE WHITE HOUSE
STAFF MADE ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN
AND THEN THERE WAS A LEAK
ABOUT THAT.
YOU HAD A MEETING WITH THE
TEAM ABOUT LEAKS AND THAT
GOT LEAKED.
I THINK FIVE TIMES TO
JONATHAN SWAN OVER AT AXIOS.
WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE THE PRESIDENT CAN'T
EVEN TRUST HIS OWN STAFF.
>> LOOK, I CAN TELL YOU
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BAD
ACTORS.
I THINK IT IS DISGUSTING AND
SOME OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL
BEHAVIOR THAT YOU COULD EVER
ENGAGE.
IN IT'S AN HONOR AND
PRIVILEGE TO WORK FOR THE
PRESIDENT AND TO BE PART OF
HIS ADMINISTRATION.
ANYBODY WHO BETRAYS THAT, I
THINK IS A TOTAL AND
COMPLETE COWARD AND THEY
SHOULD BE FIRED.
WE FIRED PEOPLE OVER LEAKING
BEFORE.
I HAVE PERSONALLY FIRED
PEOPLE OVER LEAKING BEFORE.
AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE
VERY WILLING TO DO SO AGAIN.
BUT, AGAIN, THIS IS ONE OF
THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES
OF A LIFETIME TO GET TO WORK
AND SERVE FOR PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS
SACRED FOR SOMEBODY TO ALLOW
TO YOU HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
AND WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.
STEVE: SARAH, WHY DO THEY DO
IT?
ARE THEY TRYING TO STAB
OTHER STAFF MEMBERS IN THE
BACK?
ARE THEY TRYING TO ADVANCE
THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA?
ARE THEY TRYING TO SET THE
RECORD STRAIGHT?
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?
>> THINK THINK THERE ARE
PROBABLY A NUMBER OF
REASONS.
SOME OF THESE LEAKS ARE MADE
UP AND REPORTERS SEARCH FOR
VALIDATION FOR THEM.
LOOK, THERE IS DEFINITELY
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE
ADDRESSED.
WE ARE FOCUSED INTENSELY ON
ADDRESSING IT.
AND WE TAKE AN EXTREMELY
SERIOUSLY.
AS I JUST SAID, I CAN'T
ANSWER WHY PEOPLE DO IT
BECAUSE I FIND IT TO BE SOME
OF THE MOST DISGUSTING
BEHAVIOR THAT YOU COULD EVER
PARTICIPATE IN AND ONE OF
THE MOST DISLOYAL THINGS
THAT YOU COULD DO AS
ENTRUSTED MEMBER OF THE
PRESIDENT'S TEAM.
WE HAVE BIG THINGS HAPPENING
HERE DECISIONS WITH NORTH
KOREA.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IRAN.
WE HAVE MOVED THE EMBASSY,
THE PRESIDENT IS GROWING THE
ECONOMY.
CREATING JOBS.
WE JUST GOT THE 21st
CIRCUIT JUDGE NOMINATED AND
CLEARED THE SENATE
YESTERDAY.
AMAZING AND BIG THINGS ARE
HAPPENING.
THAT'S WHAT OUR
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE
FOCUSED ON.
BE FOCUSED ON.
AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE --
THE NEWS FRANKLY TO BE
COVERING.
THERE ARE ALL THESE BIG
THINGS HAPPENING.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SHOULD BE
COVERING AS WELL.
IT'S A COMPLETE DISSERVICE
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT
THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON A
COMMENT MADE IN A PRIVATE
MEETING VERSUS THE COMMENTS
THAT ARE MADE ON A PUBLIC
STAGE THAT ARE LITERALLY
CHANGING THE COURSE OF HUMAN
HISTORY THAT THIS PRESIDENT
IS ENGAGED IN.
THAT IS WHAT THE MEDIA
SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AND I
HOPE THEY WILL SPEND A
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME OVER
THE NEXT WEEKS LEADING UP TO
THE SUMMIT TO DO EXACTLY
THAT.
ABBY: DO YOU THINK WE CAN
EXPECT AN APOLOGY FROM THAT
AIDE, KELLY SADLER?
MEGHAN MCCAIN IS A FRIEND OF
MINE.
I KNOW THE WAY THEY LEFT IT
THEY SPOKE ON THE PHONE AND
MEGHAN MCCAIN SAID SHE WOULD
APPRECIATE A PUBLIC APOLOGY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.
SHOULD WE NOW EXPECT THAT
NOT TO HAPPEN?
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO
THE BACK AND FORTH ON THIS.
I THINK IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED.
WE ARE DEALING WITH THIS
MATTER INTERNALLY.
AGAIN, I THINK WE SHOULD BE
FOCUSED -- A.
ABBY: WHY THE STRATEGY TO
NOT COME OUT PUBLICLY AND
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS WRONG.
LET'S MOVE ON?
>> SHE HAS PERSONALLY
APOLOGIZED.
AGAIN, I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD CONTINUE TO VALIDATE
LEAKS THAT COME OUT BY
MAKING THAT THE FOCUS OF
WHAT WE ARE DOING.
I THINK THERE ARE SOME
INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT THIS
PRESIDENT IS DOING THAT
LITERALLY HAS MASSIVE GLOBAL
IMPACTS.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT.
BRIAN: I WOULD HAVE TROUBLE
EVEN EXPRESSING MY THOUGHTS
KNOWING THAT SOMEBODY ON MY
OWN TEAM COULD BE LEAKING
THAT TO THE PRESS.
DOESN'T OVERLOOK AND
OVERSHADOW ALL THE OTHER
PEOPLE THAT ARE LOYAL TO THE
PRESIDENT THAT WORK WITH HIM
EVERY DAY.
AND I IMAGINE YOU'RE ONE OF
THEM.
NOW, I HAVE GOT TO ASK YOU
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"
TODAY HAD THIS FRONT PAGE
STORY ABOUT NAFTA.
IN THE BACK DROP THE
PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS SAID I
WANT TO UPDATE THIS DEAL
THAT'S OVER 20 YEARS OLD.
WORD IS NOW IT'S GOING NOT
GOING TO GET DONE THIS YEAR.
WE KNOW THE SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE SAID IF YOU WANT THIS
PASSED, I NEED IT BY NEXT
WEEK.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> WELL, LOOK, WE ARE STILL
IN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS.
THE PRESIDENT IS COMMITTED
THOUGH TO MAKING SURE THAT
WE DO SOMETHING BETTER.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO JUST
CONTINUE ON THE STATUS QUO.
THAT'S THE EASY THING TO DO.
BRIAN: IS MEXICO THE
PROBLEM, SARAH OR IS CANADA
THE PROBLEM OR BOTH?
>> LOOK, WE HAVE GOT TO GET
A DEAL THAT WORKS FOR
EVERYBODY.
BUT, MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE GET A DEAL THAT
WORKS FOR AMERICA.
HE IS TIRED OF GETTING TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF BY COUNTRY
AFTER COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES
TO TRADE AND HE IS GOING TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A GOOD
DEAL THAT HELPS PEOPLE IN
THIS COUNTRY AND THAT WE'RE
ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.
AND HE IS NOT GOING TO STOP
UNTIL HE GETS IT I HAVE
THINK YOU KNOW THIS
PRESIDENT IS THE TOUGHEST
NEGOTIATOR AT THE TABLE.
AND HE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE
HE GETS SOMETHING THAT
WORKS.
YOU.
BRIAN: USE THE OLD DEAL
UNTIL WE BET THE NEW
DEALENNED THAT'S NOT
WORKING, RIGHT?
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT IS
WILLING TO TEAR UP THE NAFTA
AGREEMENT IF THAT'S WHAT IT
COMES TO.
WE STILL WANT TO SEE
SOMETHING HAPPEN AND WE'RE
GOING TO CONTINUE IN THOSE
CONVERSATIONS.
THEY ARE ONGOING NOW.
AND WE ARE PUSHING FORWARD
AND HOPEFUL WE CAN GET
SOMETHING DONE SOON.
STEVE: YOU WILL GET
SOMETHING DONE TODAY.
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO HOST A NUMBER OF
OFFICIALS FROM
ANTI-SANCTUARY CITIES AND
COUNTIES AND THINGS LIKE
THAT.
THIS MORNING WE HAD THE ON
THE MAYOR OF LOIS
THE MAYOR OF LOSS
THE MAYOR OF LOS ALAMITOS.
HE SAID THE MESSAGE IN THESE
TOWNS AND COUNTIES STAND UP
AGAINST SACRAMENTO WHICH
THE SANCTUARY STATE OF
CALIFORNIA IS FORGET ABOUT
THAT, WE'RE NOT THINKING
ABOUT THAT, WE'RE THINKING
ABOUT US ACTUALLY ENFORCING
THE LAWS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
WE'RE A LAW AND ORDER TOWN.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU
MORE.
WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAWS
THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS.
PEOPLE DON'T GET TO DECIDE.
CITIES DON'T GET TO PICK AND
CHOOSE WHICH LAWS THEY WANT
TO FOLLOW.
JUST BECAUSE IT'S CALIFORNIA
DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET TO
DECIDE THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR
GOVERNMENT AND IN OUR
SYSTEM.
AND YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE
LAW THAT IS ON THE BOOKS.
AND WE'RE VERY THANKFUL THAT
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MAYORS
AND COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, ET
CETERA, THAT ARE STANDING UP
TO SOME OF THE OTHERS AND
SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH LIKE
THIS IS NOT WHAT OUR STATE
NEEDS.
IT'S NOT WHAT OUR STATE
WANTS AND WE ARE GLAD THEY
ARE GOING TO BE HERE AND BE
PART OF THAT DISCUSSION
LATER THIS AFTERNOON.
BRIAN: I'M SURE YOU KNOW
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAD A
BIG MEETING YESTERDAY ABOUT
IMMIGRATION AND TRYING TO
GET DACA BACK ON THE BOOKS.
TRYING TO GET DEMOCRAT AND
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT TO TRY TO
LOOK AT DACA DEAL AGAIN.
WHAT COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT
THE PRESIDENT'S STANCE ON
THIS?
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
VERY CLEAR ON WHAT HE WANTS
TO SEE WHEN IT COMES TO AN
IMMIGRATION PACKAGE.
HE WANTS TO CLOSE THE
LOOPHOLES.
HE WANTS TO SECURE THE
BORDER.
AND HE IS WILLING TO DO
SOMETHING ON DACA BUT WE
HAVE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.
WE CAN'T JUST KICK THE CAN
DOWN THE ROAD.
WE HAVE TO SECURE THE
BORDER.
BRIAN: REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS
COMING UP WITH THEIR PLAN.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT
THEY ARE DOING?
DOES THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT
THESE THREE REPUBLICANS OR
NOT?
>> LOOK, WE WILL SEE WHAT
THAT COMES OUT TO LOOK LIKE.
AT THE SAME TIME, THE
PRESIDENT HAS NOT WAVERED
AND HE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY
CLEAR ON WHAT THE PRIORITIES
AND WHAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE
THAT HE WANTS TO SEE WHEN IT
COMES TO ANY PIECE OF
IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION.
ABBY: SARAH, HOW IS MELANIA
DOING?
>> SHE IS DOING VERY WELL.
SHE IS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS.
THE PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO GO
BACK TO WALTER REED
YESTERDAY AND VISIT WITH HER
AND SHE ASK THAT EVERYBODY
CONTINUES TO KEEP HER IN
YOUR PRAYERS.
BUT SHE IS ONE OF THE
TOUGHEST PEOPLE YOU WILL
FIND AND SHE IS DOING GREAT
AND IN GOOD SPIRITS.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.
STEVE: THE PLAN IS FOR HER
TO BE RELEASED IN THE
NUMBERS COUPLE OF DAYS?
>> YEAH.
SHE IS ON TRACK FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS AND CERTAIN
LIE WE WILL KEEP EVERYONE
POSTED.
ABBY: OUR THOUGHTS AND
PRAYERS ARE WITH HER.
GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS
MORNING.
>> THANKS SO MUCH.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.
BRIAN: SOMEONE ELSE HAS TO
BRING BARRON TO SOCCER
PRACTICE.
I HOPE YOU ARE PITCHING IN.
>> VERY FEW THINGS I COULD
PROBABLY HELP PITCH IN ON,
THAT, I THINK I COULD
HANDLE.
STEVE: I BET YOU HAVE A
MINIVAN.
>> I DON'T HAVE A MINIVAN
BUT I HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM IN
A MOM-SIZED VEHICLE AND I'M
MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO A
