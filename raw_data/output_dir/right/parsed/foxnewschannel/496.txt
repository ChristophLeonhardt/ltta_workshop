MEAN SENATOR CHRIS, WHO WATCHED
AND HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF
TEARS.
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENS GOING FORWARD.
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS VOTE
RIGHT NOW AND WE WILL KNOW IN
JUST A FEW MOMENTS IF IT DOES
SHAKE OUT 11-10 OR SOMEHOW
DIFFERENT THAN THAT, WE WILL
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT JUDGE BRETT
KAVANAUGH WILL BE FULL SENATE
VOTE NEXT WEEK TO BECOME THE
NEXT JUSTICE ON THE
SUPREME COURT.
WHERE DO WE STAND IN WASHINGTON
WITH PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO WORK
THINGS OUT?
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY, REALLY
NASTY, CHRIS.
>> LET ME TALK FIRST OF ALL
ABOUT THE PROCESS BECAUSE EVEN
IF THEY WERE TO VOTE NOT TO
REFER THE NOMINATION OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH, THAT WOULD NOT STOP
THE SENATE FROM TAKING A VOTE.
IF YOU WERE TO GO DOWN 11-10
RATHER THAN REPORTED OUT
FAVORABLY 11-10, IT CAN STILL BE
BROUGHT TO THE SENATE FLOOR IN
THE WAY THAT WOULD WORK IS THAT
TOMORROW IT WOULD BE BROUGHT UP
AND ON MONDAY THERE WOULD BE A
VOTE TO CUT OFF DEBATE AND THE
CONFIRMATION WOULD HAPPEN ON
TUESDAY.
AS BRET BAIER MENTIONED A FEW
MOMENTS AGO, THERE IS STILL SOME
DOUBT ABOUT TWO MODERATE WOMEN
IN THE SENATE, REPUBLICAN WOMEN,
LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE.
WE DON'T KNOW, THEY HAVE NOT
ANNOUNCED.
SUSAN COLLINS AS OF LATE MORNING
HAS SAID SHE IS STILL UNDECIDED
ON THIS AND I SUSPECT IF WE ARE
NOT GOING TO HAVE US UNTIL
TUESDAY SHE WILL HEAR FROM A LOT
OF CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME IN
MAINE.
AS FAR AS RELATIONS ON
CAPITOL HILL AND BETWEEN THE TWO
PARTIES, YESTERDAY WAS ABOUT AS
UGLY AS I'VE EVER SEEN IT AND
I'VE BEEN IN THIS TOWN FOR 40
YEARS.
YOU'VE SEEN SPIRITED DEBATES,
SOME ANGRY DEBATES, BUT
YESTERDAY WAS UGLY AND BITTER.
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU SAW
LINDSEY GRAHAM SNAP BACK AFTER
THESE ATTACKS BY DEMOCRATS ON
KAVANAUGH WHEN THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT DRINKING GAMES AND HIS
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.
AND HE SAID THIS IS THE MOST
DESPICABLE THING I'VE EVER SEEN
IN THIS TOWN AND ANY REPUBLICAN
WHO VOTES NO VOTES AGAINST THE
NOMINATION IS LEGITIMIZING THAT,
THIS ISN'T JUST PEOPLE PLAYING
ON TV AND THEY GO AS IT OFTEN
HAPPENS, HOPEFULLY SO, YOU CAN
ARGUE ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND GO
OUT AND HAVE A DRINK OR
