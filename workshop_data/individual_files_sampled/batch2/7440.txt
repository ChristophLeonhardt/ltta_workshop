I guess in some kind of effort to upstage Paul Ryan's stupid tweet from this past weekend about that secretary getting a dollar fifty a week raise on Monday morning Donald Trump decided to take to Twitter to once again prove that he is the king of stupid tweets now Donald Trump decided after watching Fox and Friends this morning that he was going to attack Adam Schiff the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who's been very outspoken about the nothing burger that was the Nunez memo released Friday so Donald Trump tweets out the following little Adam Schiff is how he started this little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and clapper little Adam Schiff now let's forget for a minute that the president just accused the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee of committing a felony we'll get to that in a moment little Adam Schiff Donald Trump's wife Melania has made it her duty as first lady to to tackle bullying in the United States particularly cyberbullying and here her president one of the most disgusting human beings to ever walk the face of this earth is out there on Twitter on a Monday morning referring to a man a civil servant serving in the House of Representatives a powerful Democrat as little Adam Schiff Donald Trump President of the United States has nothing better to do with his time than to insult sitting members of Congress because he disagrees with what they have to say but actually a little bit more importantly than that because this man this little Donald Trump is terrified about this ongoing investigation and even he knows in spite of his tweets to the contrary that this Nunez memo proved absolutely nothing in fact if anything it made his case a hell of a lot worse there were a lot of things released in that Nunez memo specifically dealing with Carter page that were later then corroborated by independent stories including E and interviews given by Carter Paige himself Carter Paige had been interacting with Russians for years and years and years and years said that he was an adviser to officials at the Kremlin yeah I would say that constitutes being wiretapped if you're working on a federal presidential campaign Nunez memo was quite possibly a huge nothing burger and I know Republicans think that it proves some kind of conspiracy at the FBI that does not exist but if you looked at that memo if you actually read it and saw the things in there and you still think that there's something to it then reread it or go take a class and learn how to properly read because there's nothing in there that in any way paints Democrats as doing something wrong Nunez really screwed the pooch on this one because that memo hurt him a hell of a lot more than it hurt anyone at the FBI anyone in the Obama administration or anyone in the Clinton campaign and that's why Donald Trump is pissed off and scared and that's why he's going after Adam Schiff now let's get to the second part of the tweet he said he illegally leaves intelligence meetings to go leak stuff to the press that was the back half of his tweet there he illegally leaves meetings to go leak stuff to the press a felony if true unfortunately for the president there's zero evidence to back any of that up and this is the same guy who accused President Obama of committing a felony by illegally wiretapping Donald Trump which did not happen Carter page was the one who was under surveillance not Donald Trump so all those people saying Donald Trump was vindicated in his claim no he's not I suggest you learn how to read context and more specifically read the actual words that were said by both parties and you'll see that no Donald Trump was not vindicated in anything if anything it paints his campaign as even more involved with the Russians than we previously had thought Donald Trump is a sad pathetic little excuse for a man and he can't handle that and he understands it that's why he's out there attacking other people that's why he's being a bully because he suffers from so many insecurities himself that he has to project them on to other people and that is exactly what he did this morning with his little Adam Schiff tweet thanks for watching and if you like what you see here on Ring of Fire we encourage you to subscribe to our Channel you can see the little subscribe button down there but if you're watching it on another device where you can't see it go to youtube.com slash the Ring of Fire hit subscribe be notified every time we get a new video
