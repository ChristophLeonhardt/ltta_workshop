fresh revelations have surfaced which could potentially shed light on a mysterious murder of three Russian journalists in the Central African Republic at the end of July with signs that their perilous trip was badly managed the journalists were looking into the alleged presence of Russian mercenaries in the country Russian tycoon and vocal critic of President Putin Mikhail Khodorkovsky sponsored the investigation and the reporters were found dead in a bullet-riddled car in a remote location the speculation in the mainstream media that the killings were politically motivated claiming that the military contractors had close ties to the Russian government Golikov ski too insisted that journalists were killed because of the investigation they were carrying out do you have any reason to believe that these men were killed because of the work they were doing the immune attack yes I think exactly vacuum however screenshots of text messages between the team organizing the trip and the slain journalists which have recently surfaced indicate a possible serious managerial lapses this has prompted to call the cops key to halt his support for the outlet the journalists were working for Jacqueline VUCA discussed the revelations with correspondent Elia petrenko the group chat featured the three members of the crew and also their boss back at the HQ plus a couple of producers at this point the screenshots cannot shed light on what exactly happened on that tragic day and the probe is of course far from being over but the screenshots allow us to trace the preparations that were actually being undertaken for working in one of the most dangerous countries in Africa and also the crew and their HQ people kept using that very same group chat as their means of communication when the trip began and just have a look at some of these elements of the preparations we've got a print small press cards in English and also a UN sign for the car make sure you film how you get rid of the press cards do it in a creative way and with commentary so apparently according to these messages from their HQ faking UN credentials was part of their plan yes and by the way the group later claimed that they were working in the Central African Republic in coordination with the United Nations however eventually the UN said that they knew nothing of it so again the plan suggested that the group could use their freshly printed press cards at one stage of the travel and then burn them at another we don't know the purpose of that well they knew that they were about to break the law by entering the country on tourist visas but as journalists on active duty without any accreditation you might argue that most of the Central African Republic is lawless land so your logical assumption would be that they must have had a go to person on the ground then definitely a proper translator and for sure a carefully thought through plan and reality though when they arrived in the country they didn't even have the phone number of their fixer he didn't show up at the airport and they were never able to get in touch with him and at the end of the day they didn't have a proper itinerary and so issues started piling up one after another upon arrival and here's some of the other parts of the messages that the crew sent in the group chat guys we're in a bit of a logistical disaster we just can't seem to get through to the locals technology is absolutely alien to them there's a feeling of total helplessness when it comes to language basically no one speaks English the journalist mission and the CA are obviously meant that they were supposed to sneak through some heavy security and have a look at what the cameraman texted and the group chat after one of their failed attempts to do just that we couldn't get in they said it's only possible with the permit from the Defense Ministry plus two cops met us with all our equipment by the hotel we had to bribe them then we were stopped at a checkpoint another bribe but a smaller one the locals see cameras as a negative unfriendly thing and what kind of directions did their bosses give them at that point they were told to keep going the group was losing money on bribes they were never even able to get in touch with their only english-speaking guide however when everything seemingly went out of control messages from HQ kept urging them to stay on track go there by yourself you paid a lot of money to get to this country you shouldn't give up about any permit we need a translator to find him when it held from Bienvenue it's impossible to storm into the secured territory and I'm not sure we have to go to the ministry and be tougher with the bribes next time what rules did you violate tell them you're gonna go to the embassy etc this group chat clearly points at the fact that there were real security issues that the crew was facing before their tragic death you
