welcome to Sophie & Co I'm Sophie apart not say today Moscow welcomes to draw for the FIFA 2018 World Cup where the lucky team is already looking forward to the group stage one of the debutantes of the competition Iceland has already won the hearts of fans to world over at the 2016 heroes and it's manager hey mer ha Grimson is my guest today is bringing the Viking spirit to the FIFA World Cup being the smallest ever nation survive for sports ultimate prize what's behind Iceland's meteoric rise from football punching bags to fear giant killer is the Nordic underdog : just a passing fad or are we about to see the birth of a new football superpower on the world stage hey mere hole crimson welcome to the show it's a pleasure to have you on our program now this is going to be Iceland's first-ever World Cup are you going to pull up another upset and progress out of the group stage or even further I mean after years it seems like anything is possible for Iceland of course that's that's the aim to do well we deserve to be in Russia like like everyone else and we've done quite a lot of good results so why not in welcome finally we at least hope so but we are also realistic that we can have fantastic games but but still lose against the like nations that are normally in the World Cup final so we are realistic but Icelanders are normally really optimistic so how optimistic are you I mean what is your goal to - what to win to reach semi finals quarterfinals well to begin with of course we it's a great honor just to be there if we progress from the group stage I think that is a big achievement for Iceland but we know that from the past former like past 5-6 years that if we have our best games we can beat anyone but I think it's healthy to dream to hold the World Cup in our hands but of course that's statistically probably not likely that we're gonna win it but like I said before we're optimistic and we don't know yet work teams will be playing again so what nations will be playing again so we haven't set any any goals yet but of course we are going there to protest from the group stage and from there it's a copy our champion is like a so if we if we have a good game we can we can win everyone so now explain in the cop but now your team Iceland has all this international experience facing top teams so if you could choose which countries do you want to get and which ones do want to avoid in a World Cup I don't think there is an easy team in the World Cup final so my opinion is we don't actually mind who we get we know we're gonna get strong teams I don't think for Iceland there is a team that we should win but hopefully you know the the best teams in the world you can't avoid them because they are in Group one so yeah we were always gonna have a team that's really really really difficult to beat and from from Group one and group two so no III don't mind which team we will get we just we accept what we got so you've had this big breakthrough right Iceland isn't an underdog anymore everybody has seen what the tip is capable of is it going to be a lot harder this time around I mean do you feel the pressure now that you've set you know sort of limit that you can be really good no the pressure is more or less from ourselves the husband in very many group that all the games were tough teams play a little bit different against us from the days in the past so we just prepared for everything and yeah we have maybe not so much pressure on doing results but it's it's harder and harder because it's very unlikely that people would underestimate us I just wonder why didn't you leave the team after a year or 2016 like Lars lagerb√§ck I mean to leave on a high and try your hand a coaching a club or another national team I actually believe that we could do even better than done the euros and luckily I did also I had the contract so I could couldn't leave the contract but no it was never in the plan to leave the the national team because I think still we can improve from what we are doing so I still believe Iceland could do even better than and we have been doing yep and the Dutch team coach Dick Advocaat says your team should be looked up to having no inner conflicts no personal ambitions but common ground discipline is that your personal achievement as a coach or more of an Icelandic national trait what's the secret I wish I could say it it's all me but but it is and it's it's a I said it's a really big group that's coming together and trying to do this as a team both the players the staff the the FA and we have a special relationship with the fans and we have a special relationship with the media so it's it's a big team not us working together to to make this happen and and in the world as it is today like all the money involved in all the I don't want to say greed but it's a lot about the individual today everything today is about the individual so it's so nice to be a little bit different and it's all about the team and and I think it's it's a quality that Icelandic football players have maybe because we come from an amateur environment so we know that that the other nations have better individuals and more individual qualities than we have so we have to be collectively better than than others in its that's I think that's a good message to Iceland ders and to the kids in Iceland we have to stick together and work together to achieve or maybe it's like a national trade of smaller nations because every other football teams coach actually dreams of the kind of unity that you have in your team why isn't it working out with others I can't answer that one because I don't know what the others are doing but we haven't we haven't we don't try to hide what we are doing so we are open about how or we are achieving things and how we are working so there's no secret in it and you know you can't do anything in a sport like football unless you have good football players that as always number one two and three you have good football players luckily for us they are really really good characters so it's possible to build a good team around good football players and that's of course a fantastic blend so most of your players they play in Europe how do you keep the team question going when the players see each other so rarely I think that's a good thing about thing I don't think that's any different from other national teams you know that they are playing everywhere around Europe in another national team so it's no different from Iceland but what is a little bit special with the the ice on a national team is that the players have been playing together since the bulk of the squad has been playing together since they were in the under-17 under-19 on 2:21 so they know each other quite well they played many of them together in the same team as youth players so the relationship between the players is also special in our squad and it's they're probably closer to each other than in most of other national teams you are a doctor by trade I know that when doctors work on medical problems like before an operation they sit there and analyze and think about the job months before it happens and complicated cases so while your players are being off in all their European clubs how do you prepare the team for the next game when you don't have a team present I guess it's the same for me like like every other national team coach we watch our players we watched the our games and analyze our games in the past we watch our opponents and analyze them and so on but yeah we try to see as many players as as we can it's probably easier for an ISIL in national codes to to monitor their players because we don't have that many plane in Europe we have about a hundred professionals playing across Europe so it's it's it's probably easier for for an Icelandic national team coach to to monitor his players so when you see money George actually the continent to see your players in action during their Club games yes sometimes we do but because we are so spread we don't have like the Russian national team coach has most of his players playing in Russia we're spread all over Europe so more or less we we use the modern technology to watch as many games as we can during especially the weekends and we have today we have software that we can see every game everywhere in the world so it's easy to see the players especially if if we we hear that they have been doing well or badly we can we can look back to that game whenever we like so modern technology makes it makes it much much easier to be a national team coach today than it was before hey Mir say you know how it works huge success usually comes with down Falls and now that the whole world is an Iceland team do you think there's a danger that your players maybe will lose that humility and with that the team spirit no I'm not afraid of that we we talk about it regularly about why we went football much is why we are we are good as a team so we remind ourselves what we are about and what we like to represent as a national team and especially how we win football matches so I think it's really dangerous to overestimate yourself when you have success but that's the job of the staff and the coaches to remind the place about what we should stand for and probably at the moment that is the biggest task for us because Icelandic football doesn't stand and fall with the World Cup final in Russia sentence we use so often is that success is not destination success is not the work of finals in Russia success is a continuous journey to the right direction and I think that that is so vital for us to remind ourselves that we have to keep on building on what we are good at don't try to be something else just because we had success and and I think that's so healthy and not so important for Iceland at the moment to remind ourselves continuously on on why we have success and that's that's the team as that's the team all right hey me we're gonna take a short break right now when we're back we'll discuss what's the secret of Iceland's football team's raving success with their manager hey Mira vulgrim s'en stay with us and we're back with Hamer Hall Grimson manager of Iceland's football team discussing the team's stunning rice at Giro 2016 and their expectations for the World Cup soap a mere as you've said earlier you all often mentioned there's too much money in football and that money is the enemy of motivation yeeow players who play in the English Premier League you had players from Barcelona money didn't corrupt them so it must be something else and no no I've never said that that money is destroying everything but of course for some when you have a plenty of it it stops motivating you but of course you have examples of the best football players in the world that had a lot of lot of money but still are really motivated so it depends on the personality but of course it is difficult to motivate yourself when when you don't need anything in the world but not that's then it's down to the character of the person you know during this quarterfinals with France Islip fans occupied a relatively small part of stead of house yeah it was like 10% of Iceland's population as some statics statistics put it and I remember vividly the Viking clap chanting and singing is one and those guys I mean they're really sent some shockwaves throughout the world let alone the stadium was it all the result of some coordinated effort or spontaneous I think it's a blend of both it's been slowly increasing their support the national team is getting and all the credit goes to the supporters club that has been fantastic growing all the time doing more more things and if you look back four or five years ago it was you didn't see many where the Icelandic national shirt on on team games but now all the stand is it's blue everybody has a national team sure they are singing the national anthem before the game and the Icelandic national anthem is maybe not the most motivational song ever made so the change is enormous in our in the support and it's both spontaneous of course the the interest increases with better results but it's again also the the supporters club that has been growing steadily and and I kind of taken control of what's happening and and I I hope so tremendously that Russia will see the best of Icelandic fans because it's a kind of a family a family fun you know you take your kid you take your wife you take your grandmother to the game and it's it's a different kind of support because it's a lot of ownership from the fans in the team almost everyone has a relative or a friend that is playing or in the staff so I think that's unique regarding the Icelandic support and also I'm thinking if that many fans came to the heroes perhaps even more will come to the World Cup so his Ashlyn just going to take one giant holiday for a whole month I mean who's gonna stay behind him work and that was the problem in the euros there was a lot of lot of companies that almost had to close because there were so many many people in France and I hope it's gonna be the same in in Russia and next summer and I hope the the Icelandic fans will show that their best side because they were really something to be proud of in in France and and I think and I know that when they come in numbers to Russia I know there will be good guests in Russia so I know you have a tradition of going to this fans pub before home games of the national team having a chat with them what did do this for I mean how do you deal with everyone they are telling you how to do your job yeah it's difficult to explain and yeah it's it's it's hard for many to under understand it how this is possible but I think firstly it's it's something that makes us different a national team coach can walk into a pub two and a half hours before a game talk to maybe four or five hundred people that's there some are drinking beer no different kinds of people there but there's a lot of respect to do it of course we respect our fans and we show that with with doing this and what I think is more unique and more special is that we have done it now I've done it now for six years and nothing has gone online in the media so it's it's a rule for the fans that they shot their phones off nobody's recording anything nobody is is is tweeting anything and the fans are the first one to know the the lineup and the fans are given how we are gonna play against the opponent and so on and so forth so there they have a lot of information about how we want to play and for me that is something unique that is something that I don't want to lose because it's we give the the fans ownership in the team they respect it enormously and we respect them and when we trust them like we do and I think it's very hard to do that anywhere in the world so this makes us a little bit this is something that we we we have they're the only national team that does this and I love it it is kind of strange of course for some to think about it but while it works I think it's a fantastic way to give ownership to the fans so like you said everyone knows everyone and somehow each family's related one way or another to the soccer team how hard is it in the circumstances for you to be a public person it's quite easy actually is quite easy I live in a 4,000 people village or an island just in the south coast of Iceland so whenever it's gets it gets too much I go there and relax and and when you come from a small village you you go there and everybody knows yourself for what you are and you don't have to play anything you don't have to be you know you don't have to act anything because everybody knows you anyway so they would see through it so it's nice to come from a small ready to go there and relax after after something big like when we when we wanna the right to go to Russia but it's quite easy because the media also knows how how things are going we work closely with the Icelandic media and I think again something special the relationship between the national team and the Icelandic media there they are probably closer to the national team than and any media in the world and we trust them and they trust us so it's it's again something special that we have and what makes us a team also so it's quite easy to be an Iceland in the time of success there is one UEFA qualified football coach for 800 people in Iceland that's compared to one per 11,000 in the UK for instance Iceland has also the highest density of indoor football pitches than any other country in the world what's behind such a massive investment into basically just a game it's not factories roads banks the country is investing in right no it's the the local communities that not pay for the for the facilities in every village in every town and that's that's again good facilities in good coach Yunus is the two most necessary parts to produce good football players but what we like to to think and and what we have known from research is that the kids they do better in school when they do sports they they become more healthy they do less drugs they do less alcohol when they do sports and oh all religious and iced and thrive and and pride themselves of good facilities for for sports and football especially has done quite well with with coach education so so it doesn't matter if you come from two thousand people village or the Icelandic champions you almost get the same coaching so you don't need to drive your kid a long distance for good coaching it's it's all local locally based so I think that's again something unique in Iceland and and it's difficult for for big nations to to replica that so yeah you correct that's that's the local communities that not do the do the facilities and pay for the facilities hey Mir you have been an assistant coach and a co coach you've coached quite a few teams yourself which approp brings better results I mean should the coach be strict demanding keep his distance or it doesn't work better when you're the players friend a part of the team it's different between teams your coach and sometimes you have to be tough sometimes you have to be different and I think it's it's a balance between everything we are quite it's quite a good routine and what we are doing now so distance is okay and a coach always has to keep a certain distance and but you can see everything work you can see like a coach like a dictator and you can see a coach that's hugging everyone so you have to evaluate what players you have what what club you have or what team you have it might be the the culture of the nation or whatever so it's not one in my opinion it's not not one type of code that's better than the other you just have to to look at the circumstances and surroundings so footballers are tempted to break the rules for the sake of winning you pull sure tackle someone's leg instead of the ball or just outright dive do you think winning is worth doing things like that again depends on what game what's the score but of course nobody wants to cheat and and it's new it's never any shortcut to a place worth coming to I think that's a good sentence but you know you sometimes even applaud the player for fouling an opponent going for a counter-attack or whatever and it's a yellow card but it's still worth it that the opponent isn't score so it's very difficult question to answer versus there was this case in Germany when referee gave a penalty but the player who earned it who was fouled came up to the RAF and said there was no foul and the penalty should be canceled other countries have seen similar cases of course and I wonder if you've seen anything like that in football is it more important to be honest like that and fair in Fairplay or to actually put the team forward to help the team win reward the fans yeah I would be very would be very stupid to say that you should cheat this always it's not only in football it's in life you should always try to be as honest as you can and you should always be honest and I think that's a philosophy everybody should should live by and work by alright hey Mira thank you very much for this interesting insight in the world of football where we're talking - hey Mir Hall Crimson Iceland's football coach and one of those behind the national team's stunning success at the Euro 2016 that is it for the latest edition of Sophie and ku I will see you next time
