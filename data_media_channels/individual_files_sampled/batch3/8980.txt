♪ ♪ RUDY IS A GREAT GUY, BUT HE JUST STARTED A DAY AGO. HE REALLY HAS NOT FINISHED. HE IS WORKING HARD, LEARNING THE SUBJECT MATTER. HE WILL ISSUE A STATEMENT. RUDY KNOWS THAT IT IS A WITCH HUNT. STARTED YESTERDAY. HE WILL GET HIS FACTS STRAIGHT. John: PRESIDENT TRUMP ON HIS WAY TO DALLAS, TALKING ABOUT RUDY GIULIANI, OFFERING HIM PRAISE AND A LITTLE BIT OF A CORRECTION AS WELL. LET'S BRING IN THE PANEL NOW. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR FOR THE "THE WASHINGTON TIMES," SUSAN PAGE, AND JASON RILEY, WALL STREET JOURNAL COLUMNIST AND SENIOR FELLOW AT THE MANHATTAN INSTITUTE. WE GOT A CLARIFYING STATEMENT FROM RUDY GIULIANI NOT AFTER AT THE PRESIDENT SPOKE. HE SAID THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN VIOLATION. IN THE PAYMENT WAS MADE TO RESOLVE A PERSONAL AND FALSE ALLEGATION IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT'S FAMILY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN ANY EVENT WHETHER HE WAS A CANDIDATE OR NOT. GIULIANI SEEMING TO BE WALKING BACK OR CLARIFYING THE STATEMENT HE MADE ON FOX WHEN HE SAID IF THAT HAD COME OUT IN THE DEBATE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. SPEE HE MIGHT HAVE JUST EXTENDED IT. I DON'T THINK IT WAS A SLIP OF THE TONGUE, I THINK IT WAS A STRATEGY. THEY SEEM TO BE WALKING A BACK A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW. BUT POLITICALLY, WHAT IT HAS INSURED IS WALL-TO-WALL COVERAGE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE PORN STAR THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND BEYOND. THAT IS A PROBLEM POLITICALLY. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THESE GREAT JOB FIGURES OR SOME OF THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS IN THE POST WORLD TOUR SOMATIC WORLD WAR II ERA. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT, IF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN, A REPUBLICAN UP FOR REELECTION, THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO BE TALKING ABOUT. John: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION EARLIER IN THE WEEK, BECAUSE THEIR SEEM TO BE A NEW MOMENTUM, BUT THIS KICKED IT IN ORBIT. I WOULD DISAGREE THAT GIULIANI WAS BROUGHT IN TO BRING MUELLER INVESTIGATION, BROUGHT INTO CHANGE THAT KIND OF CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE WHITE HOUSE. I THINK THAT TY COBB HAD A VIEW THAT YOU DEALT WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND HE TRIED TO COOPERATE. YOU AGREED TO TESTIFY. AND THEN THE GIULIANI APPROACH SEEMS TO BE LET'S FIGHT IT IN THE STREETS AND NOT IN THE COURTROOM, LET'S FIGHT IT OUT ON CABLE TV AND PUBLIC OPINION. I THINK THAT THEY ARE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR IF THERE IS A VERY NEGATIVE REPORT BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL OR AN INDICTMENT, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO UNDERLINE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FBI OF THE COURT TO THE INVESTIGATION. John: I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THIS MIDNIGHT ON WEDNESDAY AFTER HE MADE THE COMMENTS, I SAID, WHY DID YOU DO THIS? I SAID TO YOU HAVE SOME REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT PROSECUTORS RATED MICHAEL COHEN'S HOME HAVE EVIDENCE? HE SAID, NO, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT WAS RECEIVED FROM MICHAEL COHEN'S OFFICE, BUT COHEN KNOWS. YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF THEY HAVE BANK RECORDS. OBVIOUSLY POLITICAL SPEAKING IT IS A FIRESTORM RIGHT NOW, BUT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT POLITICS. I THINK THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LEGALLY, AND CLEARING THAT UP FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESIDENT. IN THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM. John: YOU THINK THIS CLEARS IT UP? THE FACT THAT HE PAID FOR IT AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY ELSE PAYING FOR IT AND FEELING TO FILE THE PROPER DOCUMENTATION, YES, THAT IS A GOOD THING FOR THE PRESIDENT. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT SUGGESTS THAT AT LEAST THE BEST INFORMATION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS IS THE BEST CASE THEY HAVE AGAINST HIM IS AN FEC VIOLATION. IS THIS CASE, AND IF THAT IS THE BEST THAT MUELLER HAS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, THAT IS NOT THAT BAD. John: THERE IS A LITTLE DETAIL OF OKAY, YOU ARE PAYING MICHAEL COHEN A RETAINER, DID YOU KNOW WHERE THE RETAINER WAS GOING? IN THE PRESIDENT ON THE WAY TO DALLAS GAVE US A LITTLE INSIGHT. LET'S LISTEN. WELL, YOU ARE GOING TO FIND OUT, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO GIVE A FULL LIST, AND PEOPLE KNOW, AND VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING SAID HAS BEEN SAID INCORRECTLY. AND IT HAS BEEN SAID WRONG OR IT HAS BEEN COVERED WRONG BY THE
