start start working I guess mr. president ladies and gentlemen negotiations with US President Donald Trump in seeing straightforward manner very successful and useful we reviewed the current status and prospects and russia-us ties and also the key issues of the International agenda sardius that bilateral challenges difficult stage but these difficulties tension between our countries do not have any objective grounds for it the Cold War is long over the ideological confrontations in the past the situation in the world has drastically changed today both Russia and the US are facing new completely new challenges those include dangerous dangerous D balancing of international mechanisms global security regional crises this president terrorism missioned transport of crime difficulties and the economy environmental issues and other threats overcome these issues if we stand together and I hope that we'll reach this understanding with our US counterparts today's negotiations reflected our shared wish to improve the negative trend and to identify the first step so to change it to make confident steps it to go back to the previous level across all the issues as biggest nuclear powers we have the responsibility for global security I feel it is important and we talked about it to establish dialogue on strategic security and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction we've handed over a list of proposals to our US counterparts on this regard we believe it's important to continue working together military political and disarmament agenda we need to expand to extend the agreement strategic weapons and that's New START treaty we'll also have issues about the US missile shield the INF treaty we also need to talk about the issues related to the deployment of weapons in space we favor continued cooperation in fighting terrorism jointly and in providing a cyber security and our security agencies have been working successfully and the recent example is cooperation with security officers from the US as part of the FIFA 2018 World Cup that concluded yesterday we need to make it a systemic effort and I reminded the US president to reestablish our anti-terror group we also talked about regional crisis we don't have the same approach on all the crises but we still have a lot of shared interests we need to be looking for points of convergence we need to be working together in a closer way including at International Forum we're also talked about regional crises including Syria pass for Syria we need to establish peace and accord and include be the role model of joint cooperation Russia and the US definitely take leadership in this area and establish interaction to avoid and overcome the humanitarian crisis and help refugees go back to their homes in order to provide for a constructive cooperation in Syria we have all the necessary components Russian and US military officers have very good experience saying in terms of coordination they have established very good channels of communication that helped to avert collision and unnecessary dangerous incidents on the ground and in the air after terrorists were destroyed in the southern the situation in Holland hides the Golan Heights should be restored in line with a 1974 a treaty it would help to ease tension and Golan Heights and he's tension between Syria and Israel and provide security for the State of Israel and distinguished mr. president paid particular attention to it I'd like to reaffirm that Russia he's interested in it and will stick to this policy going forward this will help to pave for an equitable peace and security based on a UN Security Council resolution its goods that's the Korean opinions for the issues finally being resolved and to a large extent it's been possible thanks to president Trump's personal activities he's been focused on easing tension and on a confrontation we're also talked about us decision to pull out of the Iranian deal I'd like to confirm once again that Tehran has been a defeater country that's been biggest scrutiny of the IAEA and that has helped it to protect the non-proliferation treaty we also discussed Ukraine we looked at the needs for a conscientious implementation of the Minsk Accords the US could have been more firm achieving pushing the Ukrainian authorities to comply with the Minsk Accords we also focus strongly on the economy we do have interest for cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic the u.s. business delegation was one of the biggest ones the st. Petersburg Economic Forum in May featured more than 500 senior executives from the US we need to spur bilateral investments and trade and to do this we agreed to set up a high-level working group that would combine captains of industry from both countries business leaders know better how to establish the cooperation in trade and investment so let them think hard about it and provide proposals that's fourth use president raised the issue of the so-called alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and I had to repeat what I said several times including at my one-on-one meetings with him as I said Russia has never interfered and will never interfere with US domestic affairs including election campaign if there are if there is any of evidence we are ready to review eight together especially as part of the knee as part of the cybersecurity group that needs to be set up we discussed that earlier I would also need to DeFries I the US and Russia ties in the humanitarian area and in terms of civil society we received a delegation of the US congressman and that was perceived as an extraordinary event but that should actually become a usual routine effort that's why we asked you as President Trump to think about the philosophy as a vision for our ties going forward we need to engage experts who know a lot about history and the specifics of the Russian and u.s. relationship we need to engage influential scholars former diplomats and military offices historians who would try to identify points and confirm convergence and ways to reverse negative trends and move towards a sustainable upward trend overall we are satisfied with one on one meeting previously we had meetings during international fora we had a very good conversation I hope that we achieved a better understanding and I really appreciate Donald Trump's without Ed there's still a lot of issues were not able to clear out but it's a very important first step in this direction and finally I'd like to say that the establishments of the working environment has been largely due to the Finnish House who we are we'd appreciate the efforts of the Helsinki residence the nation of Finland so we are sorry for the inconvenience to the residents of Helsinki thank you so much thank you thank you I have just concluded a meeting with President Putin when a wide range of critical issues for both of our countries we had direct open deeply productive dialogue went very well before I begin I want to thank president nene still of Finland for graciously hosting today's summit President Putin I was saying how lovely it was and what a great job they did I also want to congratulate Russia and President Putin for having done such an excellent job in hosting the World Cup it was really one of the best ever and your team also did very well it was a great job I'm here today to continue the proud tradition of bold American diplomacy from the earliest days of our republic American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility a productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia but it is good for the world the disagreements between our two countries are well known and President Putin and I discussed them at the length today but if we're going to solve many of the problems facing our world then we're going to have to find ways to cooperate in pursuit of shared interests too often in both recent past and long ago we have seen the consequences when diplomacy is left on the table we have also seen the benefits of cooperation in the last century our nations fought alongside one another in the Second World War even during the tensions of the Cold War when the world looked much different than it does today the United States and Russia were able to maintain a strong dialogue what our relationship has never been worse than it is now however that changed as of about four hours ago nothing would be easier politically than to refuse to meet to refuse to engage but that would not accomplish anything as president I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics or the media or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct constructive dialogue between the United States and Russia affords the opportunity to open new pathways toward peace and stability in our world I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics as president I will always put what is best for America and what is best for the American people during today's meeting I addressed directly with President Putin the issue of Russian interference in our elections I felt this was a message best delivered in person spent a great deal of time talking about it and President Putin may very well want to address it and Bernie strongly because he feels very strongly about it and he has an interesting idea we also discussed one of the most critical challenges facing humanity nuclear proliferation I provided an update on my meeting last month with chairman CEM on the denuclearization of North Korea and after today I am very sure that President Putin and Russia want very much to end that problem going to work with us and I appreciate that commitment the president and I also discussed the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism both Russia and the United States horrific terrorist attacks and we have agreed to maintain open communication between our security agencies to protect our citizens from this global menace last year we told Russia about a planned attack in st. Petersburg and they were able to stop it cold they found them they stopped them there was no doubt about it I appreciated president Putin's phone call afterwards to thank me I also emphasized the importance of placing pressure on Iran to halt its nuclear ambitions and to stop its campaign of violence throughout the area throughout the Middle East as we discussed at length the crisis in Syria is a complex one cooperation between our two countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives I also made clear that the United States will not allow Iran to benefit from our successful campaign against Isis we have just about eradicated Isis in the area we also agreed that representatives from our national security councils will meet to follow up on all of the issues we addressed today and to continue the progress we have started right here in Helsinki today's meeting is only the beginning of a longer process but we have taken the first steps toward a brighter future and one with a strong dialogue and a lot of thought our expectations are grounded in realism but our hopes are grounded in America's desire for friendship cooperation and peace and I think I can speak on behalf of Russia when I say that also President Putin I want to thank you again for joining me for these important discussions and for advancing open dialogue between Russia and the United States our meeting carries on a long tradition of diplomacy between Russia the United States for the greater good of all and this was a very constructive day this was a very constructive few hours that we spent together it's in the interest of both of our countries to continue our conversation and we have agreed to do so I'm sure we'll be meeting again in the future often and hopefully we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today so right now Janice would be able to take two key questions so we start with journalists from the Kremlin pool please introduce yourself my name is Alexei Meshkov Interfax news agency I have a president to US President Donald Trump during your European tour he said that the implementation of the North stream cheaper plan projects makes Europe a captive of Europe and you wanted to help the Europe to get rid of this dependence by supplying L&G American LNG but this cold winter proves that the current energy security system is really better than what you're offering and the US have had to buy additional volumes of gasoline from Russia do you think that your proposal could lead to a gap or two in the energy security system - and we'll make Europeans more exposed and my second question you called President Putin and competitor earlier but you said that you'd be able to become friends with him have you achieved that and a good competitor he is and I think the word competitor is a compliment I think that we will be competing when you talk about the pipeline I'm not sure necessarily that it's in the best interests of Germany or not but that was a decision that they made we'll be competing as you know the United States is now or soon will be but I think it actually is right now the largest in the oil and gas world so we're gonna be selling LNG and we'll have to be competing with the pipeline and I think we'll compete successfully although there is a little advantage locationally so I just wish them luck I mean I did I discussed with Angela Merkel in pretty strong tones but I also know where they're all coming from and they have a very close source so we'll see how that all works out but we have lots of sources now and the United States is much different than it was a number of years ago when we weren't able to extract what we can extract today so today we're number one in the world at that and I think we'll be out there competing very strongly thank you very much just one remark we discussed this issue with the US president we are aware of the stance of the u.s. the u.s. is also a major ungass country we believe we can work together to regulate global markets because we don't want a drastic cut in the price and our producers will suffer from that and including US producers I mean shale gas producers we don't want the price to fall too much because otherwise production is not profitable anymore and we are not interested in exceedingly high prices because refinery and machine building or will be killed so we do have joint areas that we can discuss going back to Nordstrom two US presidents expressed concerns over possible disappearance of transits value crane I assured him that we are ready to go on with transits of our Ukrainian we are ready to extend the contract if the issues resolved at the Stockholm court of arbitration between gospel enough to Gus Thank You mr. president us stupidity and the Muller probe that is responsible for the decline in US relations with Russia do you hold Russia at all accountable for anything in particular and if so what would you what would you consider them that they are responsible for yes I do I hold both countries responsible I think that the United States has been foolish I think we've all been foolish we should have had this dialogue a long time ago a long time frankly before I got to office to blame I think that the United States now is step forward along with Russia and we're getting together and we have a chance to do some great things whether it's nuclear proliferation in terms of stopping we have to do it ultimately that's probably the most important thing that we can be working on but I do feel that we have both made some mistakes I think that the the probe is a disaster for our country I think it's kept us apart it's kept us separated there was no collusion at all everybody knows it people are being brought out to the fore so far that I know virtually none of it related to the campaign and they're gonna have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign a clean campaign I beat Hillary Clinton easily and frankly we beat her and I'm not even saying from the standpoint we won that race and it's a shame that they could even be a little bit of a cloud over it people know that people understand it but the main thing and we discussed this also zero collusion and it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world we have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries it's ridiculous it's ridiculous what's going on with the pro-president follow-up as well why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election given the evidence that US intelligence agencies have provided and will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials that were indicted last week by a US grand jury well I'm gonna let the president answer the second part of that question but as you know the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election which frankly they should have been able to win because the electoral college is much more advantageous for Democrats as you know than it is to Republicans we won the electoral college by a lot 306 to 223 I believe and that was a well thought that was a well-fought battle we did a great job and frankly I'm gonna let the president speak to the second part of your question but just to say it one time again and I say it all the time there was no collusion I didn't know the president there was nobody to collude with there was no collusion with the campaign and every time you hear all of these you know 12 and 14 it's stuff that has nothing to do and frankly they admit these are not people involved in the campaign but to the average reader there they're saying well maybe that does it doesn't and even the people involved some perhaps told miss stories all in one case the FBI said there was no life there was no life somebody else said there was we ran a brilliant campaign and that's why I'm president now getting back on credibility is there any credibility well you cannot trust anyone why do you feel that President Trump trusts me or did I trust him fully he defends the interests of the United States of America I defend the interests of Russia we do have points of convergence and we're looking for shared interests with rises where we are not on the same page and we're trying to find ways to make our were constructive we should not rely on short term political goals by sound political forces we should rely on evidence can you name at least one piece of evidence that points to any kind of collusion during the race it was this was absurd we didn't know each other president just said that there was some particular opinion in the Russian society concerning warned particular candidates presidential candidates Donald Trump was talking about the need to re-establish political ties with Russia and that led to the fact that there was an opinion among Russian people that sir he's the preferred candidate it's natural to be to have a liking towards someone who wants so to build better ties with another country as for us he accusations against Concord Concord hired the lawyers and basically what's happening is that sir the entire charges are collapsing so just look at what's happening in the court proceedings so that's what you have rely on now going back to the indictments of rushon that security services I need to look into it I we're not really aware of what's behind it but the President did raise this issue now here's what I can propose we do have an existing treaty between Russia and the United States that was signed in 1999 and that's a treaty were mutual facilitation on criminal cases and that's been effective treaty and upon a request from foreign air authorities we open up to 150 criminal cases and as you might remember the former nuclear power minister was extradited from the u.s. to Russia and he was persecuted prosecuted here and there's a formal procedure that is part of these Chiti say your commission led by the mr. Muller so that's troll could send an official request to Russia so that we hold investigation or in questioning of those individuals and our Prosecutor General's our officers will look into it so they will hold the questioning and will then send all those materials to the US and we can even make another step forward we can also invite US official representatives including the members of the mother probe we can invite them to be present during the questioning but if that takes place then it must be a two-way street we would also expect from the US to question those officials including from the security services that we believe are behind illegal activities on the territory of the Russian Federation with the presence of our investigators what what I mean by that you might remember the notorious Hermitage capital case owned by mr. Broun according to our investigators a group of people his business associates illegally earned more than half a 1.5 billion US dollars they didn't pay a sense of for taxes but they transferred the money to the US and they also donated four hundred million to the Clinton the campaign four hundred million well they might have done it legally but they earn that money illegally and we do have evidence to believe that some of the US security services have helped Browder to conduct those illegal transfers but there's just one step we can talk about expanding our cooperation there are multiple options they are on the table and they're part of the see did you want treaty yes I wanted him to win because he talked about the need to normalize u.s. Russian ties continue think we can take up to three questions RT go ahead thank you good afternoon my name is Ilya petrenko our tea represents our tea for mr. Trump in English mr. president would you please go into the details of possibly any specific arrangements for the u.s. to work together with Russia in Syria if any of these kind of arrangements were made today or discuss few allow me mr. president of Russia a question in Russian now we mentioned World Cup several times mr. Pompeo earlier said that when we talk about cooperation in Syria the ball is on the side of Russia is is it correct and if so what's your next step long and hard for many years many decades I think we've never never has anyone any country been closer than we are President Putin also is helping Israel and we both spoke with Bibi Netanyahu and they would like to do certain things with respect to Syria having to do with the safety of Israel so in that respect we absolutely would like to work in order to help Israel and Israel will be working with us so both countries would work jointly and I think that when you look at all of the progress that's been made in certain sections with the eradication of Isis 98% 99% there and other things that have taken place that we've done and that frankly Russia has helped us with in certain respects but I think that they're working with Israel is a great thing and creating safety for Israel is something that both President Putin and I would like to see very much one little thing I might add to that is the helping of people helping of people the because you have such horrible if you see and I've seen reports and I've seen pictures I've seen just about everything and if we can do something to help the people of Syria get back into some form of shelter and on a humanitarian basis and that's what the word was really a humanitarian basis I think that both of us would be very interested in doing that and we are we will do that thank you very much excuse me but for now no specific agreements for instance between the militaries well our militaries do get along fact our militaries actually have gotten along probably better than our political leaders for years but our militaries do get along very well and they do coordinate in Syria and other places thank you as I mentioned earlier we discussed a humanitarian area in Syria and I discussed the same issue with French president Marc Ron yesterday and we agreed that we will step up our efforts with European countries including new with France and we're ready to provide our cargo planes to deliver humanitarian aid and we discussed it - with just president Trump so there's a lot to work on here now what's important is there there's so many refugees hold our pain at Turkey Lebanon Jordan in Syria's neighboring states if we provide them assistance so they could go back to their homes that the migration pressure on European countries and other countries who will decrease many times so I feel it's very important from all the perspectives both from the humanitarian perspective and also to ease the situation with refugees and overall I agree with you as presidents that our military have been working hard together have been working hard together and they've been getting along and I hope that this will be the case going forward forward we'll also continue working together as part of the Astana format Russia token Iran but we're ready to align these efforts with the efforts of the so called smaller group of states so that this process would kick off and that we have the best chances for the ultimate success now as for the boron is on our side the football metaphor you used yes president just said that's we've finally concluded the conducted the bull have conducted the World Cup I'd like to give the ball to the US president Trump now the ball is on his side is expected to host the 2026 World Cup final question from the United States will go to Jonathan Lemire from the AP thank you a question for each president president Trump view first just now President Putin denied having anything to do with the election near Ference in every US intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did what who my first question for you sir is who do you believe my second question is would you now with the whole world watching tell President Putin would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again so let me just say that we have two thoughts you have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server why haven't they taken the server why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee I've been wondering that I've been asking that for a months and months and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media where is the server I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying with that being said all I can do is ask the question my people came to me dan coates came to me and some others they said they think it's Russia I have President Putin he just said it's not Russia I will say this I don't see any reason why it would be but I really do want to see the server but I have I have confidence in both parties I really believe that this will probably go on for a while but I don't think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server what happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC where are those servers they're missing where are they what happened to Hillary Clinton's emails 33,000 emails gone just gone I think in Russia they wouldn't begun so easily I think it's a disgrace that we can't get Hillary Clinton's 33,000 emails so I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today and what he did is an incredible offer he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people I think that's an incredible offer thank you allow me to add a remark as you know I was also a security officer I know how dossiers how these reports are drafted secondly I believe Russia is a democratic state and I'm sure that you believe that the u.s. is democratic state is it well if it is so then the ultimate decision in this dispute can only be established by court and not by security services the company called Conchords is charged with interference but they don't represent the Russian state given many examples you have many people take mr. Soros a billionaire has been interfering everywhere but is this the official position of the US State this is the position are they in individual same could be applied here and the ultimate verdict can be only provided by court and again it applies only to individuals it has nothing to do with the state and a final indictment regarding our security officers again we do have a mutual treaty send us an official request leather mallet Commission sent us an official request we'll do our part of the job and we'll plying and we can expand our cooperation as I said but again it should be a two-way street we'll then we'll also expect to access provided by the u.s. to those individuals that we feel are also part of the security services let's talk in details let's not use the Russian u.s. ties as a bargaining chip in the u.s. domestic affairs thank you two questions for you sir can you tell me what President Trump may have indicated to you about officially recognizing Crimea as part of Russia and then secondly sir do you just the Russian government have any compromising material on President Trump or his family here's President Donald Trump's position is well known on Crimean he's been sticking to it he says it's Crimea has been taken illegally we have a different opinion we believe that we held a referendum in line or with rules and procedures you and so for us this issue is closed as for compromising materials I heard about it it's been an allegation that so we compiled a dossier on Trump when he came her to Moscow my colleague when Trump came over to Moscow I was not aware of it I respect President trampers heads the United States but when he came over as a businessman I was not even aware that she's in Moscow take the st. Petersburg Economic Forum 500 senior executives from the US came over to Russia I don't even remember all the names do you feel that so we are compiling compromising materials in all of them well it's it's definitely it's absurd I cannot really imagine anything more absurd than this so please throw out this nonsense of you're out of your heads anybody watch Peter Straub testify over the last couple of days and I was in Brussels watching it it was a disgrace to the FBI it was a disgrace to our country and you would say that was a total witch hunt thank you very much everybody thank you
