hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle it's a new year but the same stories persist out front is the chaotic Trump White House followed by the steel dossier and a possible breakthrough with North Korea crosstalking the new year i'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst and we have Dimitri babaji's a political analyst with Sputnik international okay gentlemen as I always cross stock rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate let's talk about Michael a wolf's a fire in fury I look at it as basically political gossip something that some things in there we've already suspected but one of the things I thought was interesting that I pulled from the excerpts I haven't read the book I haven't seen the whole thing but you know when we have these conversations with Steve band and the former strategists and being thrown to the curb later by mr. Trump the the collusion with Israel again this story pops up it doesn't get a whole lot of coverage because people want to hyperventilate about how crude or rude or simple-minded or stupid the president is but there are little nuggets coming out here that the mainstream just isn't interested in Demon's well first I was puzzled by the admission of Michael Wolff that actually I'm going to quote him certain segments of the of the early days of trans presidency in this book well fools and I all readers to make up their own minds well that's not true that's not journalism Marcus we reaction to I don't want to waste a lot of time on Gossip Girl yeah yeah well he specifically said that a lot of what he says in the book quotations and so on contradicts each other and that some of the people were flat-out lying to him and that in some areas he's gonna let the readers decide what is true in other areas he's gonna decide on a narrative that he believes in this guy is a charlatan he's a flim-flam man he's he's he's selling scandal to an audience a resistance liberal media audience they want this to believe it's like Fox smoke I want to believe now this is a a review of one of his earlier books in The New Republic hardly you know a center-left magazine much to the annoyance of wolfs critic the scenes in his columns aren't recreated so much as created springing from wolf's imagination rather through from actual knowledge of events even wolf acknowledges that conventional reporting isn't his bag rather he absorbs the atmosphere and gossip surrounding him at cocktail parties on the street and especially during those long lunches at Michaels he's around town enough to have those insights to spot people to come across pieces of information he also has a talent for making the most of even the briefest encounters his great gift is the appearance of intimate access I think we got this week we've got the flavor of the reactions to the book the the the excerpts that people are talking about I think is real also really interesting is it maybe what is different in this year we started last year where everyone is an expert on all things related to Russia which virtually none of them are experts they hardly learned anything about Russia through the course of 2017 but 2018 is now the mainstream media they're all psychologists ok that they can judge the the mental health of the President of the United States again the rush is a scandal story is fizzling out we'll talk about that later in the program and now it's the president's mental health that's the news story well I think they're of course questions about Trump's behavior even though I think that the fact that he abandoned TPP and TTIP this will be on the good side of his presidency yes well was the fact that even skeptics admitted he did more for brilliant manufacturing drops back to the United States than the last five presidents we'd have to admit it well maybe yeah but you're talking about facts this is the media doesn't talk about facts this is what the problem is here is it with mark this is what I'm getting at here is that they don't want to look at facts they want to look they want their narrative to become prevalent and and they reinforce it 24/7 this is the time once again for the time-honored tradition of American partisan political dysfunction the side that lost the election starts accusing the side that won the election be that the president being that the people that elected him of being crazy you know every president since Nixon Nixon Ford Carter Reagan Bush Clinton they have all had their question their sanity their mental health questions in the mainstream media but to this degree it has never happened and I think what's really interesting here in a much broader sense is that this whole idea of a loyal opposition is disappearing it's disappearing in the in the neoliberal world and that is a huge threat to the system because if I dislike you then you're you're you lack morality something we disagree is it you're evil and this is you know having a loyal opposition is the key the foundation to political stability in the West it has been for millennia well that's disappearance degradation of institutions that I'm sorry it's a destruction of democracy because I remember very well despite all the differences between say bush the senior and Clinton when Clinton was the election Bush said now we will all stand behind the president and that was normal but then I can't even imagine Obama saying that and when he said something similar in the first three or four days after the election everyone understood he is going to say different things days from the election to inauguration the Obama administration did everything in their power to trace out the incoming president let's change gears talk about North Korea mark an interesting set of events occurring here the north and the south are gonna start some kind of engagement here it looks like the the Russian Chinese plan for a freeze for freeze the North Koreans would halt their program if the United States and South Korea would stop maneuvers in the south so did Trump win this one or is he being outwitted go ahead I think he's just being ignored and maneuvered around the North Korean government has what it wants it now has a nuclear deterrent which the US has given every indication that despite all the rhetoric and bluster coming out of the White House the defense secretary and Trump's tweets of course that it is not willing to sacrifice millions of South Koreans to prevent North Korea from having a nuclear deterrent so now North Korea and South Korea are now actually starting to sit down and talk directly to each other rather than the hub-and-spoke type relationship of foreign policy the US would prefer that South Korea only do what it says it with regards to North Korea one of the interesting things are demons that you know you won't get this in mainstream media but the South Koreans are reminding everyone that they're a sovereign state and they have the right to determine therefore I think they're reminding themselves we absolutely who would you know if you look at Western media coverage in the politicos in Washington they're quite bewildered by this because it's the South Koreans taking the initiative oh my goodness they have historical agency who knew it's true but how did the whole story begin South Koreans just indicated that they had a letter they had a message from North Koreans suggesting to reestablish connection you know facts connection electronic connection so basically South Koreans did what the North Koreans asked the Americans to do they started talking they at least checked the fax machine and that already made things a lot better now North Korean athletes North Korean team may go to Pyeongchang for the Olympic Games unfortunately the Russian Olympic team will not be allowed to do that it shows you how absurd the modern world has become but if you look at there at the history of the program I think the South Korean story is very important it's very important what you mentioned South Korea was allowed to become rich in the 70s and 80s by the United States as a deterrent against North Korea against China against the Soviet Union no new countries of the South Korea were allowed to become rich even when they became satellites of the night you remember Rachel trading relations with United States to get interesting rates for me you know I mentioned then they leave the russian-chinese idea and then you have South Korea you have North Korea it does sizzle it's going back to what it should have been all along a regional problem resolved by the countries in the region not an outsider determining what South Korea's foreign policy and defense needs would be should be a both Russia and China both have good relations with both of these country more or less right and that all four of these countries stand to benefit primarily economically from improved relations between North and South Korea Russia would like to supply energy to South Korea they want a transport corridor through North Korea providing South Korea access directly through Russia to your European markets there is every potential here if they manage to push the US with its big big button out of the way there could be a real breakthrough you know I we have to start with baby steps of course in relations between North and South Korea brokered by Russia and China which both stand the benefit from reunification an eventual reunification unlike when you look at the four players here what's being initiated now and we've seen you know false starts before but everybody the four countries they're basically gonna get everything they want well that's really quite remarkable because it's done through diplomacy well we've had a similar story with Syria ultimately who is now resolving the problem why is the fighting dying down little by little Iran Russia basically 30 and to a lesser extent Lebanon okay so the countries that are close to Syria that have an interest in in Syria been peaceful there are of course much more capable bringing peace to that region than the outside I think soonerlater Ukrainians were singing on it was to that short break we'll continue our discussion on stories in the new year stay with arty welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle to remind you were discussing stories in the new year okay gentlemen let's move on to the United Nations and Iran and we know that the end of 2017 in the beginning part of this year there were a number of protests in Iran and we saw a flurry of particularly uh congressional officials and of course the media get all excited about the possibility of giving freedom to the Iranian people they didn't really understand the story and these were economic protests and when push came to shove there were a lot more pro-government protests going out in supporting of the government here then you had the humiliation of the United States again in the Security Council when most of the permanent members saying what are we doing here why are we here it's an internal problem for Iran to resolve the United States again standing completely alone of course the Iranians were claiming there's some kind of colored revolution that were it was in the works we've seen this playbook before but it's it's very interesting the isolation of the United States when it comes to around this this is a complete fail for Washington and the Trump administration particularly nikki Haley she has no friends there I've apparently political scientists in the United States whom I work about Michael Brenner he basically wrote on this we live from obsession to obsession from Russia to China Iran North Korea Venezuela anyone who dares to cross Uncle Sam but Iran is the longest obsession that has been going on for 38 years so when you are obsessed about something you lose the ability to judge soundly what's going on there Iran is a complicated country there are different groups basically and and some of these groups are demanding things which are quite contrary to to nighted States once you know that there are conservatives in Iran who want the government to be more conservative than than it is now and and the figures okay twelve people killed killed during the protests there were days but the United States by its drone attacks killed more people just thinking here markets that when they were vents going on in Ferguson there wasn't in the know and the the Russians the Chinese or the French or the British they didn't call for the United Nations Security Council to convene because it were riots inside the United States but the United States seems to think that it it has the moral responsibility to protect protesters in Iran when they don't even protect their own people at home that's exactly what the Russian representative to the United Nations and the United Nations chastised nikki Haley about should we should we then investigate Ferguson should we invest if I investigate Occupy Wall Street are these matters for Internet what happens with that shooting in Las Vegas I'd like to know something about that maybe the UN can help us find out what happened to these Keepers sure in Ferguson I think would be a good idea no these protests they are completely there's hasn't been a story since Russia gate well I mean there's so many of them stories actually that the press has gotten so wrong and the press was begging the press the commentary at the the foreign policy blob in the US were baying as one regime change regime change freedom names of course is they wanted sanctions to if you income force the Iranian people to change the regime and now they're saying that they want to help the people of Iran I think completely contradictory they don't even know what they said in the past I'm old enough to remember John McCain just a few years ago singing bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran so tell me again how much the US figures in the Yukons in the US government care about the people of Iran and their freedom but these protests actually started outside of Tehran this wasn't the green protests again this isn't an urban middle class these are working-class poor in small cities in Iran that were angry about subsidies and benefits being removed by the popular moderate Prime Minister just recently re-elected in a landslide rouhani and is there's some indication that they actually had the support of conservatives it was in the government because this is seen as a neoliberal move to take these things away and the Conservatives are more economically left but some people say these protests were more then jacked by violent armed rioters others say that there was actually some small parallel riots going on that we're trying to do under the cover of the protests but the government actually reacted fairly moderately in rouhani said the people have a right to protest as long as they're peaceful I don't think this was the reaction that the u.s. wanted I think they of course they had their color revolution figure in the game any any suggestion that they weren't involved at some level in these riots it is absurd but it does say in Demon's is that the Iran is on the agenda it's on the menu for the deep state and they're in their colleagues in Israel they definitely want to see some time they don't make a secret out of it and of course you just imagine what would happen if Russia reacted to Ferguson in the same way I think these reports in Russia that Ferguson is a breach of human rights and it should be investigated these reports would be looked upon you know under a microscope now by mister mu and others how did they try to influence the political process in them I was actually part of the CIA assessment their anger that that Artie dared to cover occupied we we did a great job during Ferguson I'm very proud of our team all right let's change gears here the Russia gates still kind of moves along though it's it's these parameters are thinning Heights link here but one story that stays with us and I think should have been at the very center of it is the fusion GPS Christopher Steele dossier we have Republican congressional officials coming out saying they want an investigation of this parallel we have our new investigations into the Clinton Foundation three of them possibly four here also it's both are fine and have a life of their own market but I'm really I really think this fusion GPS thing is the key to it this is the this is the glue that has the entire Russia gate conspiracy theory house it pulls it all together go ahead there's a big broad legal pushback that's the the story at the beginning of this year against Russia gate man affort is suing the FBI special investigator Mueller for stepping outside the boundaries of anything to do with the election Trump Russia gate and going back and through his tax records from from more than a decade ago so he's calling for judicial review of the powers that Mueller has we have the Clinton Foundation is now being investigated for corruption for taking the operations of money from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries while the US was arming these countries to the hilt we we have this investigations are being called for into both Christopher steal this this former British spook for hire that was hired by the DNC and then later essentially picked up by the FBI they were at least paying his expenses to to create opposition research it somehow the New York Times gave the fusion GPS a little bit of space to redeem themselves there in the article in January 2nd here are the Republicans fake investigation by Glenn Simpson and Peter Frisch I think how you that's how you pronounce his name and here they say in the year since the publication of the so-called steel dossier the collection of intelligence reports we commissioned about Donald Trump's ties to Russia this is a fabrication this is fake this is fake it wasn't a collection of intelligence reports that is this is opposition research completely different okay and they're trying to pass it off as being the same thing and you have the failing New York Times carrying water perfusion GPS this is a complete scam on many different levels well the New York Times has been so shameless in its campaign against Trump for over a year now I think two years it's just it's impossible to read them because out of nine articles that I get in my mail you know out of nine eight I think are anti Trump how Trump is bad but I think there is an interesting point here I think it's comical and at the same time tragic poor manifold they went after Paul Manafort men of what actually wanted to make a no curvature pro-american president of Ukraine he wanted Yanukovych to turn against Russia when he after he comes to power and for that you know they decide they really reward and and manifold good man obviously so now he's suing he is going to war against I don't usually look for virtue in politics metaphor was making a lot of money Dima and so the Podesta brothers and everybody else okay it's all about that it's all about influence in money so you know making him into a pro-american president okay maybe how much you would get paid good I have to disagree with you I have no problem with the New York Times taking out hit piece after hit piece of Donald Trump because there's a lot of domestic policies environmental concerns that he frankly deserves it on but what I do have a problem with is them pursuing against all reason all evidence this Russia gate scandal as the league because George papadopolis Connors run query' with an Australian implement and and it spewed garbage to make him look it make himself look important a year later there is no evidence of collusion there isn't even any more evidence that Russia actually did anything to hack or interfere with the election and still this witch hunt goes on they keep generating more smoke more smoke they're hoping to carry this whole partisan you know neo McCarthyite of furniture right into the midterm elections to give them both energy and then if they manage to take back both houses to jump right into partisan political impeachment oh my goodness oh we've got what we've got eleven months to wait just don't expect any actual evidence of collusion well I mean they make it look we've already had over a year of no of spinning their wheels I mean it's it's quite amazing that the story continues to go on without any basis in fact go ahead to you before we go to the well I think it's not just that story you just repeat a certain assertion and then people finally will start believing it it was the same with the so-called McLaren report about rashness leads using drugs no proof whatsoever not a shred of evidence but since the Russians did not refute it as the head of the International Olympic Committee now said it must be true in the same way no shred of evidence of Russian collusion in in the election but since the Russians did not present proper evidence denying it it must be really it's that is a really good reflection on the media here okay they do what they do have to do is you you're guilty and you have to prove your innocence exactly okay gentlemen that's all we have time for many thanks to my guests here in Moscow and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk polls okay now for the extended version of our program mark Deema this is where we have political potpourri what's on your mind mark I know what it is you it's a Wall Street Journal article looking for help help in Moscow yes brilliant stuff explain the Wall Street Journal put out a job advert looking they're looking for a new Moscow boroichi 'f and this is being passed around by Western journalists rather excitedly who you should apply no you should apply oh you'd be great for that so I had a glance at this and what I saw wasn't so much a job advert as as description of the political commissar that they are looking for it's it's an anti-russian op-ed and and and the thing is you know Western journalists continually present arguments as if they are objective as if they are fair and balanced on their reporting on Russia and they have built their their biases and their narrative into their own job adverts I mean they're they're they're borough chief must believe things like Putin is a quote beacon for right-wing politicians across Europe even in the US and is a champion of so-called illiberal democracy in a job this is a this is a this is what they're looking for this is all the political and ideological boxes that you have to check you believe in to be a Western media borough chief reporting on Russian which requires well see language requirements there's not nothing they mention that division it's a distinct advantage but obviously it if it's an advantage that means it's not necessary as long as you toe the line on all these other narratives that the Wall Street Journal has about Russia and the set the two sad things are is is one that the Wall Street Journal is far from the the notorious outlets against Russia and to the reaction of Western journalists passing this job advert around they saw nothing wrong with it they said but but this is a perfect example of being blinded by your own groupthink okay and this is what's happened to Western journalism they can't think beyond there it's a mutual admiration society this is their standard for their borough chief but then we need to stop calling them journals I think you're absolutely right that is it I could absolutely right that profession is essentially dead go ahead deal just just five years ago ten years ago it could be other boxes that you had to feel Putin is a former KGB colonel that wants to rebuild the Soviet Union and he is probably a communist who wants to build another communist empire and even though this drama that contradicts the previous one like a Putin's of the right now put it on the left Putin is evil Russia is evil that is basically the Manor well I don't think you say do you have a knowledge of Russia do you have a knowledge of the Russian language can you write well well I mean Michael Wiese is exactly who they're looking speak any Russian has no education in Russia but he really doesn't really party wrote that for any Luke Harding wrote that for them for the wall street new card it would be a good kind of show so or maybe Pomerance FP 2po around something but you know you should have first you shouldn't be proficient proficient in Russian you shouldn't speak Russian as a friend of mine a former correspondent of The Wall Street Journal in Moscow said her first memo from her bosses when she went to Moscow was okay let's not make it a language class don't learn Russian but if you learn it make it so that you would only listen to Alexei Navalny and a few other so-called liberals in the media somehow put the filters that would filter out all the narrative that contradicts what you're supposed to write yeah because it's you know and you know what when you can when you get to that stage demon you can be the Moscow bureau chief and you can live in Washington in wall street journal' you don't need to live in Russia you can just report on Russia from Washington see I would say that it's interesting how this story is reflected in the Iranian situation the point is about Iran is that there are many forces opposing the regime there including leftist nationalists you know but the United States and the European Union for decades have been ignoring them because they were only able to accept what fits their narrative like we're a similar absolutely well the same story for many years was true about Russia that they put their stake when the Liberals and the Liberals have not won a single election in Russia since 1993 since their events in October 1993 now they're getting a little bit smarter they're kind of their main credit is Alexei Navalny who is actually a bigger than the racist took part in the racist so-called Raja we should point out to our viewers here that Russian liberals if you want to understand when a Russian liberal is it's an American neocon okay and plus the Liberals in Russia bigots they're racist okay and this is what liberal liberals in the West support of Russian liberals who are racists and bigots I say it again go ahead well I mean not only is an interesting example because most of the Russian liberals are racist but they are just anti-russian their provost and anti-russian you can hear all kinds of insulting statements from them about Russian people now about some fading Russians absolutely self-hating Russians now only is a big exception he he is a racist but he is a Russian racist and he makes crazy statements like the Ukrainian regime is nice because it is Slavic and it doesn't allow the Central Asians in unlike our treacherous government which is bringing so many guest workers from Central Asia so in in Russia I think right now there is a new thing being tested an alliance of Western aid with nationalists extremist nationalists here they may try the same thing in Iran because I think during these riots if they're smart they will see that actually it's not easy saying him to me here anyway I could put it in a nutshell is that the Europeans and the Americans just can't leave Iraq Iran alone right absolutely just can't leave it they can't leave anyone alone including Iran well not entirely because I think part of what the US was hoping and and I I do believe that they were involved in these protests these riots we should say and it very quickly even The Associated Press admitted that the riots are separate from the protests the rioters were armed they were attacking police stations military barracks and on the very first day that there were any protesters killed they were killing police exactly what happened in Syria but there has been suggestions in the Western media that oh if you say that the US must be involved again you know in trying to overthrow the Iranian government like they did when they ins helped the CIA helped install the Shah then you're a conspiracy theorist by 1953 the Western media's 15 memory 15-minute memory of their own reports the New York Times the CIA names the dark prince run II read operations signaling a tougher trance Michael aundrea the Dark Prince he'll he'll bring covert operations to Iran but the US isn't involved along the wall street I'm sorry the Washington Post the CIA creates a new mission center to turn up the heat on Iran this was just a few there's a you know what at least they're transparent about it okay there's a there the appointed stenographers of the deep state on how it's six months ago its a long time ago mark you know why are you bringing it but let's let's listen to the French president Emmanuel macron in his opinion what you just described that is okay that is you know improving Iran making it democratic what mr. McCrone wants to ban is fake news he is suggesting a new law banning fake news and given let me call that given authorities powers to remove a block social experiments what is fake and what is a meal right that's the path to walk social media contact deemed as fake news during the election sections sessions why because of the russian-led attempts to thwart his own presidential campaign last year he brings it up in the context of fake news because while he was claiming that Russia was hacking his emails and this was seemingly backed up by the US National Security Adviser under oath right after the election the French intelligence said Russia wasn't involved at all and there's no evidence that Russia was involved so whose heart is macron want to find himself really compelling there was a German election and everyone was wondering why didn't the Russians hack the election you know well it must be something the bomb had a chance to listen to the mobile phone of Chancellor Merkel for many years and that was not taken that was not influenced Russia posted news items about mr. macaron losing possibly losing to marine lepen and and you know mr. McRoy has not presented any factual evidence there were no fake reports on RT France on other Russian news items they cannot deny anything they can only say that the the sister of marine lepen she posted a news item saying that macron macrons campaign was financed by the Saudis she couldn't prove it so they declared it fake news what else did they declare fake news I'm quoting EU observing 3000 example of Russian fakes news about Crimea being part of Russia so I mean we traveled to Crimea we will know what it is Crimea is now a part of Russia but if you publish it on Facebook on Twitter it's called fake you are spreading fake news and now the German government according to the war that went into force since January 1st this year the German government can can fine you for 50 million euros because you are spreading fake news on it is the moral of the story is just don't post it in Germany okay I look forward to their Spiegel New York Times and Washington Post being fine for all the fake news that they write together gentlemen in our audience we'll be watching a lot more fake news as it is it is has a life of its own and it will keep us talking for the rest of the year that's all the time we have for the extended version of this program thank you for being with us and we'll see you next week you
