00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
History is full of stories of demons and other unearthly creatures coming into our world

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,460
and wreaking havoc on society.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,460
But what does science have to say about zombies?

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,740
Are these ferocious freaks plausible or scientifically accurate in any way?

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,340
Should we be preparing for a zombie apocalypse?

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,920
Well, it depends on what type of zombie we are talking about.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,920
Dying and coming back from the dead?

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,020
Not so likely.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,940
But a virus that induces zombie-like qualities of rage and the incessant need to eat human flesh?

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,020
Hypothetically.....yes.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,640
The main factor involved is finding a virus specific to the brain areas for these symptoms

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,640
while leaving other areas intact.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,160
Neurons are some of the some of the longest cells

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,400
and can transport molecules and proteins across the entire body.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,880
Many viruses such as rabies take advantage of take advantage of something called

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:00,000
Retrograde Axonal Transport
