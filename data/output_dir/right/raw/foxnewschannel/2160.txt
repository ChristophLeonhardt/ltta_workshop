1
00:00:00,881 --> 00:00:01,916
OFFICIALS EXPRESS SEEING

2
00:00:01,916 --> 00:00:04,184
OPTIMISM THAT THE SUMMIT WILL

3
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:05,786
PROVIDE A COMPLETE SOLUTION TO

4
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:06,587
THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR

5
00:00:06,587 --> 00:00:07,288
ISSUE.

6
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:08,289
I'M JOINED BY THE "NEW YORK

7
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:11,058
TIMES" BEST-SELLING AUTHOR OF

8
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:13,527
"US VERSUS THEM."

9
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:14,795
CONGRATULATIONS ON LANDING ON

10
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:15,462
THE LIST.

11
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:16,030
>> THANK YOU.

12
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,197
>> Dana: YOUR BOOK CAME OUT

13
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:19,900
AT A GOOD TIME.

14
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,635
BEFORE I GET TO THAT PART OF

15
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:23,938
IT LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT NORTH

16
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:24,271
KOREA.

17
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:25,773
IF THE HOSTAGES GET RELEASED

18
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:28,275
THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE OUTCOME

19
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,877
LEADING INTO THE SUMMIT.

20
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:30,978
>> A BIG WIN.

21
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:32,780
TRUMP DID OFFER SOMETHING.

22
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,882
SUMMIT, BIG DEAL TO LEGITIMATE

23
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:35,983
KIM JONG UN AND THE NORTH

24
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:37,117
KOREANS WANT THAT.

25
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:38,686
IN RETURN, NORTH KOREANS

26
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:40,187
SUSPENDED NUCLEAR TESTS AND

27
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:41,255
ICBM TESTS AND THEY DIDN'T

28
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:42,489
HAVE TO DO.

29
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,058
TRUMP HIMSELF SAID RED LINE,

30
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,060
MISSILES HITTING THE LOWER 48.

31
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,361
WELL, THIS IS DEFINITELY

32
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:48,529
MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

33
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:54,301
BEFORE THE MEETING, BEFORE

34
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,538
TRUMP.

35
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:00,441
POLITICAL PRISONERS -- THIS IS

36
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:01,809
A STICKING POINT, THIS IS RUN

37
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:03,610
LIKE A CONCENTRATION CAMP --

38
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,378
IT SHOWS THAT THE NORTH

39
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:05,846
KOREANS ARE TAKING THIS

40
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:06,280
SERIOUSLY.

41
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,181
>> Dana: WHAT MIGHT WE LEARN

42
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,183
FROM THE HOSTAGES IF THEY ARE

43
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:11,518
RELEASED FROM THE LABOR CAMP.

44
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:15,556
WHAT MIGHT WE GLEAN FROM THAT?

45
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:16,290
>> MASSIVE MISTREATMENT.

46
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,058
THEY HAVE BEEN KEPT OUT OF

47
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:18,692
COMMUNICATION.

48
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:20,227
I'M SURE -- I WOULD BE

49
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:22,262
SURPRISED IF THEY WERE

50
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:22,629
TORTURED.

51
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,231
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, I MEAN,

52
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:27,234
YOU KNOW, THERE IS ENORMOUS

53
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,136
AMOUNT OF INTERROGATION AND

54
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,537
THE THINGS -- THERE IS NO

55
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:31,538
HUMAN RIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE

56
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:32,272
WHEN THEY GO OVER.

57
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:33,507
>> Dana: LAST WEEK YOU HAD A

58
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:38,879
TWEET YOU PUT OUT THAT SAID

59
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,081
TRUMP, MOON TOGETHER GETS VOTE

60
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,783
FOR THE PEACE PRIZE.

61
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,118
YOU SAID YOU HAVEN'T SEEN AS

62
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,321
MUCH BACKLASH ON A TWEET AS

63
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:50,824
FROM THAT.

64
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:53,360
IF WE FIND PEACE IN NORTH

65
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,595
KOREA IT SHOULD BE NOMINATION

66
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:55,596
FOR THE PRIZE.

67
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:58,098
>> THE BACKLASH TO ME WAS

68
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,066
ABOUT TRUMP.

69
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,100
THEY WEREN'T SAYING HOW COULD

70
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,368
YOU SAY KIM JONG UN.

71
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:02,970
>> Dana: THAT IS MY PART I

72
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,370
CIRCLED.

73
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,872
>> HE IS A LITTLE WORSE.

74
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:11,278
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T STAND TRUMP

75
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:12,479
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T

76
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:12,913
STAND TRUMP.

77
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:14,481
EVEN SOMEONE LIKE ME THAT IS

78
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:15,983
CRITICAL OF TRUMP'S FOREIGN

79
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:16,316
POLICY.

80
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:17,684
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT I THINK

81
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:18,952
TRUMP GOT IT WRONG ON FOREIGN

82
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:19,319
POLICY.

83
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,089
BUT IF I SAY HE GETS ANYTHING

84
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:23,657
RIGHT, NORTH KOREA IT'S NOT

85
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:27,194
JUST BUMBLING INTO IT.

86
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:28,328
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT

87
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,329
MUCH MORE PRESSURE ON THE

88
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,264
CHINESE TO SQUEEZE FOR

89
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:30,631
SANCTIONS.

90
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:33,400
THEY PUT MUCH MORE FRESH ON

91
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,735
THE NORTH KOREANS TO REALIZE

92
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,203
THEY NEED TO ENGAGE AND

93
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:37,337
PRESSURE ON SOUTH KOREANS TO

94
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:38,272
REALIZE THEY HAVE TO DO

95
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:39,339
SOMETHING AND THAT IS MOVING

96
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:41,141
THE NEEDLE IN A WAY THAT OBAMA

97
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:44,545
AND BUSH WERE UNABLE TO.

98
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:46,046
I SAY THAT AND PEOPLE ARE NOT

99
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,081
PREPARED TO HANDLE IT.

100
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:48,115
>> Dana: IF THE BOOK YOU

101
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:49,950
TALK ABOUT "US VERSUS THEM" IS

102
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,717
THAT PART OF IT?

103
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,486
THAT THERE IS A FEELING, THAT

104
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:53,720
EVEN IF HE DOES SOMETHING

105
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,090
GREAT HE CAN'T GET CREDIT FOR

106
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,490
IT?

107
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,624
>> WE HAVE GONE TO THE POINT

108
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,126
WHERE A BREAKING HALF TWEET

109
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:02,896
THIS MORNING, A HALF TWEET

110
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:03,797
WITH "...

111
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,632
" NOT EVEN FINISHED YET IS

112
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:06,500
BREAKING NEWS WE HAVE TO

113
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,834
COVER.

114
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,035
THAT HAPPENED TO ME ON THE

115
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,203
NEWS THIS MORNING.

116
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:10,270
IT'S NOT.

117
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,072
TRUMP WILL BE GONE IN FOUR

118
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,775
YEARS OR EIGHT YEARS' TIME AND

119
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:15,576
THERE IS PRESUMPTION THAT IT

120
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:16,977
WILL FIX THE PROBLEMS BUT

121
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:18,879
ACTUALLY, THE REASON TRUMP WAS

122
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,815
ELECTED PRESIDENT IS -- YOU

123
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,750
WENT COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE

124
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,219
ESTABLISHED NORMS OF WHAT A

125
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,053
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN

126
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:30,090
PRESIDENT WOULD BE -- BECAUSE

127
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,225
PEOPLE, AVERAGE PEOPLE IN

128
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:33,460
UNITED STATES FEEL LIKE THIS

129
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,529
COUNTRY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT

130
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:36,697
NO LONGER SERVES THEM.

131
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:39,066
THAT IS TRUE ECONOMICALLY,

132
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,367
CULTURALLY, IT'S TRUE IN TERMS

133
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,835
OF THE MILITARY AND IN TERMS

134
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:42,436
OF TECHNOLOGY.

135
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:43,937
THOSE ARE DEEP, DEEP-SEEDED

136
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,005
THINGS THAT ARE JUST NOT

137
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:45,772
GETTING FIXED.

138
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:46,773
WE ARE NOT UNIQUE.

139
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,275
THAT'S THE WAY THEY FEEL IN

140
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:49,276
BRITAIN AND CANADA AND NEW

141
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:49,676
ZEALAND.

142
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,211
IT'S THE WAY THEY FEEL ACROSS

143
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,579
THE CONTINENTAL E.U.

144
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,981
IT'S ONLY IN JAPAN THEY DON'T

145
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,183
FEEL THIS WAY BECAUSE NO

146
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:57,151
IMMIGRANTS, POPULATION

147
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:58,218
SHRINKING.

148
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,520
NO MILITARY WITH FIGHTS ALL

149
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,020
OVER THE WORLD.

150
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,421
THEY ARE THE ONE COUNTRY THAT

151
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,758
HAS REJECTED GLOBALISM SO NO

152
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:05,692
ONE IS COMPLAINING.

153
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:06,527
>> Dana: IN THE MINUTE I

154
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:08,428
HAVE LEFT, LET ME ASK ABOUT

155
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:09,062
ANOTHER AREA.

156
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:10,497
WE HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

157
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:13,167
DELEGATION ON HIS WAY TO

158
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:13,534
CHINA.

159
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:15,102
THEY ARE THERE TO DISCUSS THE

160
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:16,702
TARIFF ISSUE TO WORK ON THE

161
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:17,404
TRADE IMBALANCE.

162
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:18,939
DO YOU THINK THAT IS A PLACE

163
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:19,973
WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS WELL

164
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,241
POSITIONED TO GET A GOOD DEAL

165
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,276
FOR THE UNITED STATES?

166
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:23,477
>> MUCH HARDER, RIGHT?

167
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:25,112
FIRST, IT'S A BIG DELEGATION.

168
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:26,547
THEY ARE NOT ALIGNED.

169
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,182
THEY DON'T ALL AGREE THEY WANT

170
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:28,849
THE SAME THING.

171
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,517
THAT MAKES IT HARDER TO GET A

172
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,451
DEAL DONE WITH THE CHINESE.

173
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,153
I DON'T THINK WE WANT A TRADE

174
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:33,854
WAR WITH CHINA.

175
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:35,889
ON THE TECHNOLOGY PIECE WE ARE

176
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,291
HITTING THEM HARD AND WE ARE

177
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,926
HITTING THEM HARD ON AN ISSUE

178
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:41,895
THAT THEY MADE THE DOMINANT

179
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:42,963
STRATEGIC ISSUE FOR THE

180
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:43,530
CHINESE PRESIDENCY.

181
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,132
THEY WANT TO BE THE DOMINANT

182
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,034
TECHNOLOGY POWER BY 2025.

183
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:47,801
WE DON'T WANT THAT.

184
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,502
>> Dana: NO.

185
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:49,736
>> THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A

186
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:50,037
FIGHT.

187
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,171
I DON'T SEE US BACKING OFF

188
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:51,738
THAT UP MANY.

189
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:53,140
EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL BE A

190
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,408
TRADE WAR IN TERMS OF THE

191
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:55,475
TARIFFS GOING DOWN THE PIKE,

192
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:58,278
