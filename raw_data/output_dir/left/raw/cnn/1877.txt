austan that this is your first time in
this neighborhood right let's stand up

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,370
here a little bit if we can and try to
figure out a way to talk to Austin while

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,969
we well he maneuvers his way can do you
mind if we talk to you

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,500
Austin you're from you're from Lake
Jackson which isn't that isn't that

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,470
close to here
yeah it's about an hour west of here

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,340
wedding 2004 what how did you hear this
news what what made you want to bring

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,220
your boat out here well I don't remember
if it was the game wardens office or

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,750
just the local police but they put a
thing out on Facebook saying that you

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,450
know anybody with the flat bottomed boat
in the general vicinity if you could

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,860
come help you know we'd greatly
appreciate it so that got from what I

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,340
saw you know within an hour it had like
three thousand shares or something like

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,090
that so it got the word out pretty quick
we're standing there on the interstate

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,079
and that's where I first met you a
couple hours ago and we saw everybody

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,500
you know just the boat started coming
out of nowhere it seemed like oh yeah

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,750
it's been unreal I mean I've been passed
by dozens upon dozens of boats and you

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,840
know this is a huge area so God knows
how many there are out here and you've

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,920
already rescued about a dozen people

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,290
what is that that's like that's one of
those National Guard truck that's kind

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,820
of what I was thinking the first time I
saw it I saw that earlier and that's

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,979
kind of eerie
what were the the people that you've

21
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,790
rescued from here what did what did they
tell you what were their stories well

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,350
the first people I pulled out it was a
wife and her husband and their daughter

23
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,610
and they I don't know how they got as
far as they did I picked him out or

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,000
picked him up closer to the entrance in
the neighborhood and I said is there any

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
way we can go back and get our dogs I
said yeah we can go come back and get

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,049
your dogs let me drop your wife and
daughter off first and then the other

27
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,149
people they woke up this morning at 5:30
and stepped out and then knee deep water

28
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,530
in the middle of their house and so they
had no idea no idea was coming and they

29
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,860
were lucky enough their neighbor across
the street was actually dry he built up

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,770
a little bit so they went over there and
we're camping out there and I just

31
00:01:58,770 --> 00:00:00,000
happened to find him an hour two ago
