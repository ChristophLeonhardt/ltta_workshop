doctors in Salisbury have confirmed that yulia scruple has been discharged from the hospital following last month's nerve agent attack but she's asked for the media to respect her privacy her father Sergei is also on the road to recovery but at a slower rate we have now discharged Yulia from Salisbury district hospital Yulia has asked for privacy from the media and I want to reiterate her request her father has also made good progress on Friday I announced that he was no longer in a critical condition although he's recovering more slowly than Yulia we hope that he too will be able to leave hospital in due course the Salisbury Hospital has issued that short statement confirming that Yulia scruple has indeed been discharged and they said that this isn't the end of her treatment but it marks a significant milestone reports suggests that she left last night that she's been taken to an undisclosed location where she can be safe from the media the foreign secretary Boris Johnson has tweeted saying congratulations that it's wonderful that Yulia scrapple is out of hospital and here's to her full and speedy recovery and there's already been reaction from the Russian embassy here in the UK saying that we congratulate Yulia on her recovery but we need urgent proof that what's being done to her is being done according to her own free will now the medical recovery that Yulia crippled and to a lesser extent her father Sergei have made as being presented as nothing short of extraordinary here given the severity of the nerve agent that they were said to have been exposed to five weeks ago sergey skripnikov are found slumped on that park bench in Salisbury and very soon afterwards the British government announced that they had been poisoned with a deadly nerve agent one that the government laboratory here Porton Down had identified as lava chalk and the media scandal and the ensuing diplomatic fallout the medical prognosis for this scrip house was catastrophic ly grave many chemical weapons experts were saying that they wouldn't survive and media reports in the first few days some of them even jumped the gun saying that the script pals had been murdered and when she pointed the finger of blame at Moscow the Prime Minister Theresa May was also pessimistic when talking about the script pals condition sadly late last week doctors indicated that their condition is unlikely to change in the near future and they may never recover fully but despite the hospital releasing this statement saying that Ullaeus cripple has been discharged the story here is already being spun in a particular way it's being spun in a particular direction again some of the media reports here now a keen to make one thing clear to paraphrase a BBC report from this morning the idea that Yulia and her father are going to make a full recovery is wrong they're going to be permanently damaged by what's being done to them thus cripples were said to have been poisoned by the so-called Noah Chowk class of nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union although it was never called by that name it is said to cause permanent damage and even death and is believed to be one of the most deadliest set of substances of its kind the British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson claimed the government sportin down military lab had attributed the agent to Russia and confirmed it was no me choke something later denied by the labs chief when I look at the the evidence I mean the people from from Portland died they were absolutely categorical and I asked the guy myself I said are you sure and he said that there's no doubt it to be clear you're not able at Porton down to say where it is from we haven't yet been able to do that we spoke to Oliver lepak from the foundation for Strategic Research who believes this type of nerve agent is extremely damaging a nova truck is supposed to be very toxic highly toxic five to eight times more toxic than than DX which is already very very toxic so small amounts should have killed mr. scribble for sure but what is still very difficult to assess today is how the Nova choke was delivered to to to the victims so before we know exactly how the Nova choke was delivered to the victim it's very difficult to assess the amount of the chemical agent that was in contact with the victims
