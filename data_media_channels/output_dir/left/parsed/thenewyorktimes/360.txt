So, inside the machine what happens
is that we have the granulate coming in.
It's been mixed with the dye
and then it's being melted,
heated up until about
250 degrees Celsius.
And so it's being pushed into the
machine and under very big pressure
it's being molded into Lego bricks and
then it's being spit out in the other end.
When the box is full, then
an A.G.V., which is a robot, it
will come and pick it up.
It will drive it over to a conveyor
belt, which transports it through
the entire factory to the high bay
warehouse, where it's being stored,
also by robots until it's
needed for packing.
So, once the box enters the high bay
warehouse, the crane, it puts it into
a random space area on the shelves, because
it always remembers exactly where
all the more than 420,000 boxes are.
The fantastic part of the job is that we
do actually build with the Lego bricks.
We do actually come up with
these crazy creative concepts.
I think we're up to almost 300
designers, and
with that many people there
we need a lot of bricks.
So, we have every Lego brick that's
in production right now
and every color that's in production.
And to just see that quantity
and that variety of Lego bricks is
just â€” it's awe-inspiring.
