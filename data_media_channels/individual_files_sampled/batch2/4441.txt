that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo they're ignoring a question about whether this migrant crisis undermines in either moral authority of the United States now Pompey owes predecessor as CIA director joins me now with John Brennan thank you for being here your first time on the beat during a period of real controversy United States there's plenty of moral questions we just covered some of them do you see a national security component or problem to this Trump policy well I certainly do not just from a humanitarian standpoint and that audio tape was just devastating and just listening to that it's heartbreaking but in terms of how the world views the United States and our allies and partners who for so many years looked up to us is setting a standard for what is right what is moral what is the right thing to do for the world the fact that we now have an administration who seems to totally disregard that I think it has tremendous implications for national security and reverberations around the globe the United States is not that standard bearer anymore what position does it put public servants in who are still duty bound to enforce most orders well it's very difficult for individuals and the the issue along the border is really a tough one when I was at the White House during president's first term I was homeland security advisor these are not easy decisions but the cruelty of the lack of empathy and compassion of the policy that's coming down from mr. Trump really makes it difficult for those members of the Customs and Border Patrol CBP to be implementing policies that I'm sure many of them find reprehensible so it really puts our public servants or civil servants in a very difficult position I'm sure a lot of them have tears on their cheeks right now would this be something a political appointee should resign over I think somebody who is being asked to carry out something like this that is cruel that is inhuman and there's just a continuation of this policy I can see if they were trying to implant something and then they realize my goodness there are these consequences that we really have to stop but fact that they're sticking to their guns and they're digging their heels I think these are things that flipple appointees who with with the conscience and who really want to make a difference should give serious consideration to departing the government you know a lot of things about a lot of things as the old saying might go so I want to also get you on this new Bob Miller filing it talks about discovery that identifies individuals that the government believes that smaller are continuing to engage in interference operations like those charged in the indictment the idea that there's ongoing Russian interference what is your view of the meaning of that and when Bob Miller says that is he building a case which we know means the most aggressive reading the prosecutors have or would he be relying on the kind of intelligence that you used to oversee well I think both when I was director CIA whenever we would get intelligence that had bearing on a counter evidence investigation that the FBI had to pull the threads on we would provide that information to the FBI so I'm sure Bob Mollica special counsels team is now picking up things on their own investigative leads but also using whatever intelligence is available and I don't for one minute think that the Russians are taking a back seat in terms of trying to influence the political landscape here in the United States through the electoral process you are someone that has quite a public record and a lot of public esteem and respect you've also said things that as you know people criticize I want to ask you about one of those something you said on Morning Joe that I based on what we know maybe you can correct us seems to be in the realm of speculation about what the Russians have or don't have on Donald Trump take a look I think he's afraid of the President of Russia why well I think one could speculate as to why that the Russians may have something on him personally is it a good idea or even proper for a former intelligence officials such as yourself to to speculate on that what is the purpose of that if perhaps in fact the Russians don't have anything on the president well I think I'm trying to explain a very puzzling phenomenon which is Vow Trump playing a very fawning attitude and having this this differential role on this to Vladimir Putin trying to explain it and so yes I said that you know one can speculate that the Russians may have something on as a former director of CIA I'm not going to get into what I might have known at that time that was classified but I continue to just underscore my puzzlement over why mr. Trump continues to take steps that appear to try to undermine the role of the Special Counsel and this investigation that if he was totally innocent of any of these allegations of involvement that he would allow the Special Counsel to pursue his investigation without any type of impediment so I want to press you on that respectfully if someone listens to you say that which is very intriguing given the stakes and someone has the interpretation that you may be trying to lawfully refer to something that's classified that is true without confirming it I'm not lawfully referring to anything that might be true but I don't not willing to reveal I am just saying that it's unclear in my mind why mr. Trump continues to have this attitude toward Vladimir Putin and the Russians again turning to another important topic you've been involved in the use of drones which is something that gets almost no attention anymore but has been controversial reading here from a New York Times report just last week President Trump has now oversaw not double not triple but five times as many lethal strikes in his first seven months in office as Obama did during a six-month a corollary and that was controversial when you were involved in that walk us through whether they're getting this right is it a problem if the numbers are up or could that be justified because this is sort of a dark war that appears we have very little public oversight on well I don't know the facts here I don't know what the conditions and circumstances are that the Trump administration is using the drone technology which is remotely piloted aircraft to actually put missiles and ordnance on targets but President Obama was very adamant as far as making sure that we use that very powerful weapon of war in a very judicious fashion and we make sure that we have near certainty of no civilian casualties in the application of that weapon and I don't know my understanding based on some of the press reports is that high standard that existed during the abomination may in fact have been lowered let me ask you - another way because I appreciate your precision would you apply that standard and easily end up on five times as many lethal strikes I find that hard to believe now I know that there over the course the last 17 months or so there's been a lot of urban warfare yeah in places like Mosul and Raqqa and it's much more difficult to carry out these types of strikes in areas where there are a large number of civilians but the fact that if the reports are true that is five times I think that it'll be very very difficult to apply the same standards and have that many strikes and that seems like a very important story as well given the fact that as you allude to there's a lot we don't know about it hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
