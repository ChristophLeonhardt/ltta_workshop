00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,719
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> all either think it's that sense of</font>

59
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,399
treasuring something you know that

65
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,600
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like knowing or wonder</font>

66
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,520

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,340
clothes but that's not true there is it

71
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,900
because it just wear clothes they live

72
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,150
their lives every object was vintage

73
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,910

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,800
I've done a little ciggies AG edge on

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,230
the top using pinking shears which if

98
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,120

<font color="#CCCCCC">America oh yeah maybe we'll stop the</font>

101
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,690
edge from fraying so we just cut along

102
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,519
the top there and then you take your jar

103
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,940
and you want to wrap it round so wrap it

104
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,920
round so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get work out how much fabric</font>

105
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,940
we needs if you just a cigarette like

111
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,060
so we're gonna have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stitch those two</font>

112
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,820
edges together so like that so basically

113
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we ran our at that point what we</font>

114
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,650
need to do is pin that together so that

115
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,049
we mark where where they suppose to meet

116
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,880
around the jar so we're going to pop

117
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,470
them in like that so it's nice and

118
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,310
and snug<font color="#E5E5E5"> round the jar great so we slide</font>

119
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,350
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and now what we're going to do is</font>

120
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,019
we're going to stitch along the edge I'm

121
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,130
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something called a back</font>

122
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,900
stitch along up and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font>

123
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,300
into the end of that one and then you

124
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,240
come up beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> two steps forward one</font>

125
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,580
step back yeah they go I'm left having

126
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,590
get like you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> married am I sure</font>

127
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,420

128
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,200
so I feel more relaxed if it says better

129
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,280
than a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meat-eor thing isn't it do you</font>

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,320
find you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a specific demographic or</font>

131
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,730
is lots of different kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ages of</font>

132
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,580
people just men we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some then we</font>

133
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,770
do have some men not lots of them but

134
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,810
definitely do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something but</font>

135
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,390
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> women of all ages so I'm early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20s</font>

136
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,300
through to 70s I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the</font>

137
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,320
biggest age group is in the 30s yeah

138
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,000
Maria it's a real mixture which is great

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and every topic of conversation comes up</font>

140
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,310
I can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

141
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,500
sister yeah and when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to is</font>

142
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,730
one of the teachers about the other day

143
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,980
she was saying like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I think that</font>

144
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,440
because you you know you're focusing on

145
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,140
something else and so and suddenly you

146
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,730
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in this a room full of women</font>

147
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,080
and you just suddenly start talking

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">about politics and then you having about</font>

149
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,770
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't and fertility and then you're</font>

150
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about sex or we know at the end</font>

151
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,479
of things and kind of hand come up oh

152
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,720
yeah and but I think people relax and

153
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,490
find it you know in 30 years again then

154
