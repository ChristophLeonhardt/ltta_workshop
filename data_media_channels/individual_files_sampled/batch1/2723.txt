managers kind of make two mistakes around promotions the first mistake is to make a big hoopla over promotion when you are promoting somebody you're rewarding them for doing great work and you're giving them additional responsibilities and you're also probably giving them some additional pay and and in some cases additional stock and there's enough extrinsic recognition and a promotion that comes through improved compensation and so on and so forth you don't need to give people public recognition around the promotion because then you're just hooking into ego and you don't want to connect ego and and promotion too much in your organization which creates a bad creates promotion obsession and promotion obsession is really unhealthy for the people who've been promoted but it's also unhealthy for those who haven't been promoted there's often going to be on your team a lot of people who are great at their job but not necessarily gunning for the next job or not necessarily they don't necessarily have the skills for the next job and if you make the whole purpose of work about getting a promotion you're guaranteeing that the majority of people on your team are going to be unhappy every promotion cycle another mistake that managers make around promotion is they save up all the best performance ratings and and the biggest bonuses for the people who are on a path to promotion and this is really unfair to the people who are great at their jobs of doing just as just as great work at that moment in time but who are not on a path to promotion if you take a look at performance in any given in any given time period bonuses and and performance ratings should be about performance in that period not about future promotion when these people who get promoted get promoted that's when they get extra pay they shouldn't get extra pay for that for that period
