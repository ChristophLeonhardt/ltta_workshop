jhin's but this is a liturgical language in the language for divine services it's not just a full form of Slavonic language it's a special form that was compiled to be kind of this semi translation this mirror of Greek language among the Slavs it began to be constructed artificially by the great ninth century Byzantine / Roman missionaries cyril and methodius and zero being the westernized form of kirill the name of the current page yeah yes actually these two great brothers the Moravian brothers us they were known they were born in Thessaloniki in the Byzantine Empire are they were educated in Constantinople now Cyril was not actually Cyril he was Constantine the philosopher he was a linguist this is primary he was a secular man an academic if we might call him that a scholar and a linguist and his older brother who served in the military and then left everything to become a monk in Asia Minor was kind of the spiritual guide and they were they came to Moravia the Slavic state and present-day Slovakia and Hungary which was destroyed later on and began mission izing to the Slavs of course of course they were Byzantine missionaries but they were actually Roman missionaries because they were representative of the Pope of Rome methodius was ordained as the archbishop of the poor by the Pope of Rome and Constantine the philosopher went to Rome where he spent his last days he was dying he went to Rome and he died a monk being tonsure the monk in room as Constantine and he was buried in the Basilica San Clemente in Rome so these brothers devised began devising this language that the Slavs could understand but on the other hand that it could reflect all of the theological complexities that were knowing to grieve that we see this one of the forms of this text even those will be Church Slavonic he has to Kitty the Cyrillic alphabet as it's known named in honor of Saint Cyril even it's not it's not what Cyril actually devised the alphabet that Cyril device no last lug will it's look much more like Armenian and then we'll see today it was it has very strange letters it's kind of reminiscent of Armenian he just made up new letters and his disciple Clement of Ohrid began devising a new offer bet that was closer to Latin and Greek which this many of the Slavs used up to this day it's not exactly clearly understood by Russians but it could be understood you know it's it's the closest thing that I might say if one tries to read Shakespeare originally in this original form you might not especially in the original grammar you might not understand 40% of the text of what someone is saying this is quite close to how Church Slavonic is understood but of course Orthodox services are done in all languages besides Greek besides Church Slavonic you have Arabic you have Syriac you have Georgian you have English you have again and it's interesting that the Russian Orthodox Church greatly contributed to the great missions in the East and in the 19th and 20th century you had brilliant Russian missionary scholars that began translating language translating these services into new languages so in all of the Central Asian languages into Chinese into Korean into Japanese this is quite an interesting element again since we saw this wonderful film which I mentioned silence many of you I'm sure saw this last year actually when Christianity came back to Japan in the nineteenth century a wonderful Russian missionary came he was an abbot his name was Nikolai Kasatka st. Nicholas Kasatka the star man with a booming voice six foot six I think tall you know walking through the streets of Tokyo smoking a pipe and his black cassock this towering figure who actually became one of the most prominent european Orientalist studying japan studying japanese culture studying the japanese language and immediately he began translating the services where he came to japan there was not a single Orthodox Christian there when he died ten thousand people many of them samurai is shaped the japanese orthodox church which exists up to this day and if one visits tokyo you could see the church of st. nicholas this towering great cathedral which was protected under the Japanese Emperor's orders during the American bombings of Tokyo it was actually painted black so that the American Air Force could not see it nor bhavet because they were bombing all of the principal buildings so you had these brilliant kind of story this brilliant these brilliant scholars which whose main purpose was to translate the services so that they would be understood the same is true for example in Africa in the Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria the liturgy the Orthodox services are performed in oh god over 30 languages and translated and began to be translated into more than 60 languages so it's our languages are appropriate for the service yes we're seeing beautiful views of the Magnificent Christ the Saviour Cathedral itself the world's largest Orthodox Church with a truly miraculous history on Christmas Day 1812 Russian forces finally drove the invading French army off Russian land of Napoleon's six hundred thousand strong Grand Army calm down me a mere twenty thousand remained it had been a horrendous campaign though with the allied French Italian German Austrian Spanish swish Swiss Danish Norwegian army even occupying the capital Moscow even arabs and cops fought in that army which is a few people know even remnants of Napoleon's Egyptian campaign very few people know this that for example you even had about 800 Christians from Egypt fighting and most of them were located in that campaign so basically and most of the Europeans and Middle Eastern people represented in Napoleon's army invading it was horrible devastation and actually for the record you know my personal pet peeve Napoleon did not lose because he froze because that was the traditional kind of idea general janvier and favoring fair because they did not live to see January in February in Russia be invaded in the early summer and they occupied Moscow by September but actually the due to the brilliance of the Russian command of Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov Napoleon did occupy Moscow but he was blocked he already suffered immense casualties he was blocked from any resources he lost the Russian army only to find it blocking all paths to the east to the north to the south and the only play after losing battles he began to lose battles and then he realized that the only way he can go back he can retreat is by the route that he came that's the left of all resources he left Moscow by early October he was beaten several times a beautiful winter started exactly they were already in the territory of present-day Belarus badly beaten in November before the first snows and we've got fake news from the 19th century even but nevertheless much of western Russia was simply razed to the ground it was quite horrific campaign for Russia so it's very if you remember that the paulien actually wanted and ordered the Kremlin to be blown up it was they had gunpowder burn barrels around the towers only one blew up actually the st. Nicholas tower only to be rebuilt in the early 19th century later on but as we remember the Russians began to lead the resistance against Napoleon and he was beaten again a year before the hundred days a year before Waterloo in the summer of 1814 when the coalition formed and shaped by Russia managed to invade France and occupy Paris by yes so after the final Russian Viktor national manifesto by the Tsar ordered quotes signify our gratitude to divine providence for saving Russia and to preserve the memory of the unheard of efforts displayed by the Russian people we build a cathedral in honor of Christ the Savior in our capital city of Moscow may the cathedral stand for many centuries let the incense of Thanksgiving that you see there together with love and a desire to imitate our ancestors achievements burn before the holy altar of God for many generations so Sergei the Cathedral has images honoring that incredible victory over Napoleon saving Russia from a very should we say genocide will foreign invader not for the first time or the last we might add as well as many religious symbols which you are an expert on you are an expert among other many other things on icons and to continue the very bizarre story unless you want to jump in there if we talk about the history of the Cathedral it actually connects for Russian Emperor's because Alexander the first ordered for a Cathedral which was a form of Russian Thanksgiving for our liberation our Thanksgiving for the salvation of our country Memorial Cathedral to be erected now Alexander the first young brother and successor Nikolas the first began the construction of the Cathedral as we know it the building continued carried on through the entire reign of Nicholas the first and Alexander the second the liberators are and it was only consecrated why is he quote deliberate design because he free desserts on one hand he abolished slavery in Russia on the other hand he saved Bulgaria he liberated Bulgaria from Turkish genocide it was a wonderful enlightened ruler he was actually on his way to sign the first Russian constitution but he was blown up by terrorists well he wasn't blown up he was mortally wounded because they threw a grenade one of the grenades it even is one of his Cossack guards and instead of racing away the Tsar went out to help the soldier and he was struck by the second grenade suffering for several for a day and a half and died in Saint Petersburg the Constitution was never signed but he led the finishing kind of phase of construction he oversaw it and only Alexander the third during his coronation in 1883 saw the consecration of this Cathedral so basically how four emperors Alexander the first it was the first Alexander the second Alexa after the third now when we talk about the memorials the military the church has a military memorial the memory of the soldiers and officers who in generals who fought the Napoleonic Wars is commemorated not in the icons but at the memorial planks which one sees on the walls bearing the names the marble planks bearing the in the galleries that surround the cathedral bearing all of the names of all of the regiments all of the units also it's a memorial both religious and military to the great patriotic double sacrilege which was committed by Josef Stalin when he awarded this Cathedral to be blown let's tell you about that I mean after the czars came Soviet Union the Cathedral was destroyed on December the 5th 1931 some of the marble that you just mentioned was even used for Moscow's role beautiful metro stations but not their original goal for the State Duma the staircase in the state tomb was also weak from the marble taken from the Kebede well well well and in its place in place of this Cathedral was built the world's largest open-air swimming pool but from 1994 after the Soviet Union came Russian Federation more than a million people around the world donated to rebuild the cathedral with extraordinary accuracy it was consecrated in the year 2000 mm anniversary of the birth of Christ so today is also a celebration of the rebirth of the cathedral itself fittingly named after Christ the Savior whose entry in the world we are celebrating today so VA can you tell us a little bit about the imagery you are an expert's we're seeing these wonderful icons and other images yes what the icons the decoration of the church is actually at the architecture itself is not traditional the only traditional icon that we see right now is the icon which stands in the center decorated with flowers the icon of the Nativity of Christ I can see clearly but ously they're a copy constantly compilations of a 16th century early 16th century piece if we look around we will see basically imperial error academic western-style painting because the entire Cathedral is built in the you know in the historic style when in the 1830s Europe and Russia began to try to rediscover its heritage that's the picture we see in front of us on the center of the screen the Nativity of Jesus no that's not the nativity no the adoration of the Magi the nativity is painted on the altar walls so that's the three wise men come to visit after the birth of Jesus actually it's interesting that the gospel doesn't say anything about the number of the Magi the wise men that came in just as the wise man came from then here you see the nativity to the north of the altar on one side of the echinus tassels you see the adoration on the other side you see the nativity again these are not traditional elements these are not traditional style icons but in the mid 19th century the 1830s when you have this romantic desire to rediscover your medieval heritage people began experimenting but it's not traditionally no this is as much this is as close to traditional Russian architecture as you know the Castle Neuschwanstein in Bavaria the second is it's close to Beattyville archetype but nevertheless we do see here some iconography as well we see 19th century copies of 19th century religious paintings let's just call it that way really yes but going back to the wonderful significance of the Cathedral as a memorial and the story which you mentioned about the cathedrals destruction and abolition okay right now skipping that we are seeing a wonderful picture of the icons yes just a twenty early twenty first century replication of 15th and 16th century Russian iconography what's very important is that when you look at the traditional icon you see that Christ is not lying in a wooden major like a chubby happy naked child as we're used to see Christ would always the infant Christ would always be depicted lying tightly tightly bound in his linens you know all tied up bundled up in a stone manager because actually in Bethlehem and then we cave managers and the caves where which are used by herdsmen in the Middle East no one carries around with the furniture you know they just cut out the managers and cut up the places where the shepherd said so Christ is born in Decatur he is taken before the eyes of his mother he's washed he's bound in linen and placed in the stone mansion 33 years later before the eyes of he's has weakened mother he will be taken down from the cross will be wrapped according to the Jewish and middle-eastern custom in little linen completely wrapped and bad things and placed in a stone tomb so in the icons of the Nativity Christ is depicted already like as if he is lying in a tomb because you know this is something that brings a very very touching very intense feeling to these celebrations to the texts to the services of the Nativity it's not just about the joy it's also about the coming suffering something that we might or might not see because sometimes people say well look the services of the Nativity are very homely very happy very joyous while the Paschal services the services of Easter are all about the passion it's exactly the other way around if you look at the Byzantine or sonography if you look at the iconography if you look at the actual texts of the services it's an activity that we are happy on one end but we are weeping on the other because crop it's the joy that Christ comes into the world but he comes as the sacrifice he comes as the Lamb of God and the cave of Bethlehem is the starting point of his long way to Golgotha to the cross and to the tomb and again during Paschal then we already rejoice completely because we are celebrating the final victory over death well going back to the theme of death and resurrection the death and the resurrection of this Cathedral is mentioned Daniel that the cathedral was destroyed and there was a swimming pool actually the story was slightly more complex you see when Nicholas the first was selecting a place to begin building the cathedral he selected a place where there was a monastery slight complication but the church was subjugated to the state so Nicholas thought he had the right to blow up the monastery and move the nuns to different colors all over Russia and the last Abbess said that you might destroy this place but mark my words you'll have nothing here but a wet spot but a puddle that's a Russian proverb you know you nepali cheat in each evoke chromium 11 esta so what Crimea start on it's a wet spot the puddle is the only thing that will be left that didn't happen obviously they built a grand Cathedral everything was fine then start the Communists came along Lenin came along Stalin the former Georgian seminarian because few people notice that's one of the worst tyrants in the history of mankind one of the worst criminals the Joseph Stalin was actually studying to be a priest in Georgian seminary but Georgia not the state of Georgia the country obviously anyway ah Stalin destroyed the Cathedral and he wanted the tallest building in the world to be placed to be built on that exact spot the Palace of the Soviets which was supposed to be you know if anyone has been to Moscow and you probably saw the Seven Sisters the seven kind of Stalin era Chrysler buildings almost skyscraper like yeah nothing semi in the summer sessions there's guys Stalin semi skies but this was supposed to dwarf the Seven Sisters supposed to have a 70 meter statue of Lenin on top well they began construction but they ran into problems because there are a lot of ground waters wet spots lots of they were forced to abandon it and finally the only thing that they could construct it was the world world's largest open-air swimming pool the Abbas's prophecy came to be so when they began to construct the new cathedral in the nineteen nineties they began digging and they've uncovered the altars and the foundations of the churches destroyed by nicholas de frst so beige the monastery of the monastery the churches of the monastery in the altars of the monastery so the patriarch Alexy is the second after i suppose the memory said that we must not just we must honor those churches as well because the causes for the first also committed a crime alexei the second is the predecessor elena so there is one major change well there are several major changes to the cathedral as it looks right now because it's much higher in terms of ground level it's the same height but if you know it's lifted up over a whole series of underground buildings that now are there but the most important one is an underground Church whose altars set exactly over the altars of the churches that nickel is the first annihilated so as this form of homage of this powerful kind of memory of those churches as well so it's very touching and wonderful this gesture let's tell you about today's symbolism of colors so gold the color of birth the Sun and truth we mentioned the color of the patriarchs clothes and clergy as you can see there tell us a little bit about the form of dress we see during this service is it different and sometimes more elaborate than some churches in the West does the form of dress change according to the ceremony so when we come back for Easter will it be different or the color will be different not the vestments themselves now of course in the present day Byzantine Rite Byzantine liturgical Rite as we see it in the Orthodox and the Greek Catholic churches we have a very very elaborate form of passages sometimes they look very very very rich probably cannot get richer than the vestments of the patriarch of Moscow incredibly lavish but if we look at the structure themselves the base of the wrestlers is this long white road known as these T hariyama's this is the robe that symbolizes the garment of baptism the garments of new life whitelighter birth that is the base for the vestments of the Deacons and the priests and bishops then of course there is the Deacons have this long just long line of fabric across their shoulders known as the horario which signified the angel's wings now on the neck of every single priest and on the underneath the bishops garments there is another kind of basically a stole the same thing as a Western stole which is called the mp3 Hylian in Greek and that signifies the holy oil which drips down the beard of Aaron the brother of Moses because an old is in ancient Israel the priests would be anointed that's why the Kings would later on become anointed just like the priesthood you know these are poor precious oil all on the head of the ordained priests then follows the some form of cape basically the Casula as it's known in the West a form of cape which is known as the film Oni on Colonna the cape that sits on the shoulders of the police the bishops also had that Bologna but in the fourteenth fifteenth century this was replaced by the Sarkis by the elaborately decorated embroidered gown which we see for example on the patriarch which bears different embroidered icons and of course on the shoulders of the patriarch we see a very important symbol we see this very this very very very broad band with crosses this long long road a band of material that is the oume for yon which is similar to the Western pallium this is the symbol of the lost sheep because every single Bishop stands in the place of Christ and the place of the apostle's in the place of Christ he's not standing in the place of Christ and everything he does he's not standing in the place of Christ and everything he says but he stands on the place of Christ because he is put there to lead the parish and he bears witness and the responsibility before Christ for his community for his church he will answer and there's a very very important reminder we see in the gospel that we know Christ talks in parables and he gives wonderful parable about the Good Shepherd that the Shepherd leaves the 99 good sheep and goes off in search of one lost sheep and he will lay down his life and his soul to bring it back and the Good Shepherd bearing the lost sheep on his shoulders was one of the earliest representations of Christ one that we already hear of in the second century and one that we already see in surviving 3rd century frescoes and carvings and graffiti and art well every single bishops must wear this OMA for ian was brought down with with crosses on his shoulders as this sign that he is responsible for Christ he must lay down his life not only for the 99 good sheep not only for the wonderful pious tearing people which we see in the cathedral but he must go out and lay down his life and lay down is sold for the lost for the disappointed for the disbelieving a very important reminder and it's interesting that in Byzantine times the OMA for Ian would be actually made from the wool of young sheep young lambs and actually the pallium the Western the variation pallium of the Pope of Rome is still made from that form of sheep and of course this know this search for the lost sheep is often seen in the service of the great bishops even of contemporary times for example if we look at Pope Francis of Rome you know when he goes out to wash the feet of Muslim immigrants during Holy Thursday you know with all of the races everything else and all the problems that go on he is basically following that idea he's justifying the AMA 40 on the pallium that is laid on his shoulders the same can be said for example about the wonderful Pope in patriarch the orthodox pope and patriarch of alexandria because the orthodox patriarch of alexandria bears the title pope theodoros ii a man who has been very well known for his immense missionary efforts in africa building churches building hospitals building schools and saving the lives of people that are not necessarily orthodox are not even christian that's not the matter you know but these hierarchs seek to help the needy these hierarchs leave the safety of their cathedrals and residences to serve the lost sheep and of course what's interesting a very interesting change was that in Byzantine times and the original and the original Byzantine Rite all of the priests and bishops had short hair we're tortured what does that mean that means they had the bald spots kind of cutouts on their forehead what's the reason behind that well you know just as a sign that you know they would stand out among all of the other people because when you begin serving in the church you leave this secular life in one way or another not only monks but even people who would be ordained as readers for example the nutrition altar boys because then you would be very very visible in the bars and brothels of Constantinople or Thessalonica or any middle-eastern city or Alexandria because again that's the church man he's not supposed to be sure it was a sign of renunciation of the world and of course there were no hats in the no headgear in the original Byzantine Rite the hats and the long hair which right now are often associated with northrax services they go in much later after the Ottoman Turks took Constantinople and destroyed the Byzantine Empire they made the clergy the authority a separate class in the Ottoman Empire and the bishops and pit sharks were seen as the rulers of the people they were the ones responsible for the obedience of the Orthodox people subject to the Ottoman Sultan that is why for example when you had the great Greek war of independence of 1821 when the state of greece as we know is formed the greek orthodox patriarch of constantinople gregory v was hanged on easter day in the gates of the Patriarchate and his body was supposed to hang there for an entire year he was later canonized as an ethanol martyr by the Orthodox Church so as the leaders of the people the bishops began to wear the patriarchs and then all of the bishops began to wear these elaborate crowns the miters as we see them basically laid Byzantine form of traffic other clergymen had to let their hair grow long and were wear special long black robes and special Turkish hats because they were literally big judges of their people in the eyes of the enemy States so that fashion took on even in those lands where the trips were not present like in Russia and that is why we see the bishops in the crowds and the priests are these different square hats so you mentioned bishops you mentioned priests is fascinating the deacon tell us the various roles we see in front of us here various clergy water there what are their functions in the church well as an any traditional church the hierarchy is divided into three levels basically the clergy is divided into three categories first you have the Deacons the helpers of the priests and bishops those that served the communities in different ways right now the role is much more ceremonial than it used to be and you see them doing the major part of this operatic chanting and so on then come the priests which already can serve the last serve liturgy and lead the services and they are standing around but of course the church is complete when the bishop is present when you have all of the levels of consecration represented the bishops are the successors to the Apostles because in the original communities after Christ's death and resurrection and deceptions you would have the priests help them and the Deacons now I think we are very good we see President Putin here do you think that's the Church of st. Simeon an 18th century church this is traditional that the president will often go to not even major cathedrals but sometimes to smaller places around the country I think he went to really key know of good at last he got last year before that he was in the one of the provincial churches and eat very rich and halfway between Moscow and st. Petersburg right yes that is kind of this new tradition because on Easter on pasta he is standing his always in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior but I'm doing the Feast of the Nativity of Christmas using some provincial Russian church tell us about the situation with churches of course you told me in previous commentaries that we did the Moscow and Russia generally Moscow was known as it was it the 40/40 said there was for 1602 churches across Moscow and of course they were many of them destroyed or abandoned in the Soviet Union and now are we seeing witnessing something of a rebirth of church is approaches to great rebirth of the 1980 late 1980s dr. Graf a chav and then in Picher PMON and then under patriarch Alexy just a second you know some remnants of that movement is still continuing because we're seeing new church is constructed was filled with people it's very interesting where the situation will go right now because you know the momentum was gained already now it's interesting but you know the people did come in is quite interesting right now what the church is going to do with them where it's gonna go because you know it's only one phase to get the people coming back to church but it's a whole other story of what to do with them how to turn you know as one great lebanese or socks bishop said i see in churches filled with people in romania and russia but I have not seen too many parishes but them in slight shifts between you know people just coming into a church in their own hopes and wrong prayers or just because there's a feast actually working with these people healthy educating and turning a church full of people into a living concern into the living parish that's quite a challenge that will have its own losses and it's hopeful games but the public is these services open to anyone there is a lot of security in the cases of not only there's always another problem of accessibility because of course visits for example Islam pools by the fan our region were the ecumenical patriarch resides you will find that it's much simpler to actually come and stand and see the ecumenical patriarch the oldest and the most senior patriarch in the Orthodox world you serve and even receive His blessing then sometime seeing as having access to the service which is led by a receipt rack of Moscow or by the patriarch of Romania because then accessibility in these predominantly Orthodox countries is sometimes a challenge not only because of the amount of people but also because of the security and so on so there are different approaches let us to many ordinary Russians know the basic prayers and rituals they seem to understand what's going on technically I don't want to be you know a debbie downer but no because of course we're seeing great interest in orthodoxy and we're seeing for example icons all over the place and a great number of Russians will say oh I went to church to place a candle to light a candle to pray but theological education and basically the Christianization the mission izing you know the inner mission has a great way to go thank God we see the desire the people to go and we see a lot of communities and you see wonderful examples of piety because sometimes when some representatives say oh you know 80% or 70% of Russia belongs to these two church then comes the question you know how many of them are there how many of them will only visit the church twice once when they were baptized and the other time when they will be brought in for their memorial service so it's that great you know the mission is still going on and it's actually facing new challenges that's the interesting part and then the positive part is challenges so we're back in the cross the Savior Cathedral Cathedral means place of permanent worship with its own bishop or Archbishop and this Cathedral would that be the patriarch Kirill himself it's actually the tradition that our quote on the day of the Nativity of Christ on the day of Christmas every single of Bishop is supposed to serve in his Cathedral that's why for example those of us that tune into our Easter broadcast in the springtime you would see that there are much more bishops around in this case we see just the patriarch and four vicar bishops Bishop helpers of the patriarchs because Moscow is actually one of the biggest diocese in the world if you judge by the number of people at the number of communities and the number of churches so the patriarch has for help or bishops that are not ruling Bishop Steve they are there to help the patriarchs or because the answers for the entire internet date so it's you know everyone is in his own Cathedral and the patriarch is considered the rector of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour is there any significance to the fact we've moved into the altar are we going to move to the high place after that yes this is the time when again the liturgy the Orthodox liturgy of John Chrysostom which is celebrated today is separated as anyone else liturgy is into three consecutive parts the prothesis which is the preparation of the bread and wine something that we do not see before the official service starts then the deacon comes up and says blessed master and the priest answers blessed is the kingdom of the Father Son Holy Spirit now whenever of the ages of Ages that signifies the Liturgy of the word the liturgy that begins with the introductory prayers that takes place for the most part outside of the altar and this combination is the reading of the gospel and the sermon well actually in the Russian tradition the sermon was moved to the very very very end of the service which is a mistake but that's because in the Imperial era in the Imperial era the priests were not allowed to say their sermons they could only read texts which were approved by the Holy Synod and the state but anyway now we are going into the most sacred part of the service the liturgy of the faithful and this will culminate in the consecration of the bread and the wine and the communion of the patriarch the clergy and the faithful so atop the altar is the tabernacle a miniature shrine sometimes built in form of a church itself inside of which is a small arc containing the reserved sacrament for use in communing the sick also kept on the altar is the gospel book so the altar table usually has a plain linen covering stretch it sir in slavonic and that's bound to the holy table with cords this cover is never removed after the altar is consecrated symbolizing the winding sheet in which the body of Christ as you mentioned said a bit earlier was wrapped when he was laid in the tomb and at the moment just listening to another hymn from another part of the choir these repetitive prayers led by the deacon who we see in the center standing before the Royal doors that is the deacon and is answered by the choir he responds easily with lord have mercy or grant us Lord glory to God they are called the Yaak tinea 18 years which are basically supplications prayers for the well-being of the people and right now the deacon is actually naming all of the Orthodox Patriarch all of the primates of the Orthodox Church the patriarchs of Constantinople of Alexandria Antioch Jerusalem Georgia be Romania Bulgaria Cyprus Greece Albania Poland the Czech lands of Slovakia at the Marrakesh and the choir wishes the many years Levites the traditional kind of way to think in God's wrath for many years and in this commemoration you find the manifestation of the unity of the Orthodox Church it has divided into regional Patriarchate's but it is one in the faith what and third that is why we must remember that there you know a lot of people who get asked what's the difference between the Greek Orthodox and the Russian Orthodox Greek Orthodox and the Romanian trust there are national differences there are some slice traditional kind of differences sometimes our calendar differences but there is never ever ever faith that is all one universal Orthodox Church is that the Last Supper that we can see yesterday back one sees the Last Supper and here again we see the eye and is that the holy table that we see in the center that's the altar table today we are the altar tabernacle across the table which the bread and the wine would be brought in placed and consecrated as the body and blood of Christ and so the altar traditionally people brought gifts their best bread or their best wine and those who did not have money instead of wine they brought water yeah well in the Eastern Orthodox tradition they actually add hot water tubing wine and the bread and in the Coptic tradition because we must remember that our coptic egyptian brothers and sisters are celebrating the nativity as well today as well as the ethiopian christians as well as syria Christians and the Serbs and Orthodox Palestinians and Jordanians well the cops have a wonderful tradition because in the Coptic tradition bread for the Eucharist bread for the liturgy is baked within hours before the service starts and must be brought warm into the altar so actually there is a small fee if one goes in to excavate you know make archaeological digs and was the Coptic monasteries and in Egypt one would find that there's a small bakery that's attached to the church from the Northeast from the northern part of the altar and that very place is known in the Coptic tradition as Bethlehem that will happen because that's where we baked the bread which is to become the Lamb the body of Christ and that is traditionally brought him to the right now in Cairo and st. Mark's Cathedral the Pope of the Coptic Church Pope Tawadros the second a wonderful man probably the tallest bishop right now that we have serving his patriarch called to candles crossed in one hand is that symbolizing the duality of creatures of Christ both holy and human in was the divine and the human nature's of Christ because you know that is a very important element for the which actually differentiates Christianity I'm not trying to go into religious propaganda and counter-propaganda this is a very important difference in Christianity that separates it from the other Abrahamic monotheistic faiths it's not just the idea that there is one single divine entity not a series of God it's not just some kind of energy but there's one personal creator of everything is one personal kind of God but I mean that's there in Judaism that's there in Islam but the difference is that in Judaism and Islam that one God gives the laws witnesses you know gives witness to himself through revelations through prophets and demands those laws to be obeyed his Christianity that one God becomes man and dies for this sinner dies for in a fallen world so God is not just some great demi Ark that sits there and on high and looks at us like ants that are supposed to obey God becomes the father that sacrifices his only beloved son and he becomes the son that is sacrifice studied by the father the utmost sacrifice for the father for these sinners through Jesus so the journey to Bethlehem which you just mentioned Mary and her husband-to-be Joseph had to travel to the city of Bethlehem to register for a census ordered by the Roman Emperor Augustus about a hundred kilometres from Nazareth to Bethlehem and when they got to Bethlehem there was no place for them to stay because the inn was already full as I'm sure you know the story they ended up spending the night in a stable place where animals were kept it's thought they slept on hay and that night Jesus was born there was no crib so they laid the baby Jesus in a manger as you as you've spoken about a feeding trough for animals and then the night of Jesus's birth we talked about the mage IV shepherds also were in fields near Bethlehem keeping watch over their sheep and an angel appeared and gave them the good news that the Savior the Messiah had been born so the angel told the Shepherd's they could find Jesus lying in a manger and suddenly a whole group of angels appeared saying glory to God in the highest and on earth peace goodwill toward men and the Shepherd's hurried to Bethlehem and found Jesus in the manger just as the angels told them and after they had seen Jesus they spread the news and everyone who heard was in war and then the sometime later wise men or Magi we don't know how many as you say today from eastern countries so a star in the sky that's signaled the birth of a new king they came to the region around Bethlehem to worship Jesus as the new king but Herod was the king of Judea and he called the wise men to a meeting and told them to find the new king so he could go and worship Him too and the wise men continued on to Bethlehem and followed the stars and it was above the house where Jesus was they found Mary and Jesus in the house and knelt down to worship Him they brought Jesus gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh some of the finest things in the ancient world frankincense burnt to make a sweet smell as we've talked about the myrrh was an expensive perfume and after visiting Jesus the wise men had a dream that warned them not to go back to King Herod so they took a different route home King Herod had lied when he told the Wiseman he wanted to worship Jesus what Hara really wanted was to find Jesus and kill him Herod was furious when he realized the wise men had not come back to tell him where to find use he sent his soldiers to Bethlehem to kill all children under two years old thinking Jesus would be one of the ones killed but God had told Joseph in a dream to flee to Egypt it's actually very interesting when we talk about the gifts of the Magi and this great during this great night this holy night remember wonderful short story by oh Henry called the gifts of the magic about a very love that's one of the most bright wonderful loving stories that one can find just a little google it and what's called gifts of the Magi about a couple that has nothing except their love for each other but when we talk about the gifts of the Magi described in the described in the Gospels why do they give Christ's gold frankincense and myrrh all of the gifts are purely symbolic they give Christ gold because gold is given to the king they give him birth because myrrh is used to ordained priests to ordained Kings on the other and to wash the bodies of the dead washed in the end with precious frankincense and we remember that the women who become the first witnesses to the empty tomb and Mary Magdalene who see Christ resurrected for the first time they will come to anoint Christ's body so you know the wisest journey would be a myrrh and we're very women Gambas connection between the two caves between the cave of Bethlehem and the cave of Golgotha and of course the frankincense is given to Christ because in Sicily is raised to God so he's venerated and he's worshipped worshipped God has the future salvation will be made possible now the patriarch right now is actually standing on the high seat as it was known because originally and here if we have any Roman Catholic listeners we might remember all the conflicts about the Vatican to decision you know to turn the priests around where should the priests be facing during the services towards the altar or should he stand facing towards the people well Vatican 2 for example turned the Catholic priests around towards the people the Eastern Orthodox continue to serve facing east facing the altar well actually in the earliest Christian communities the bishop would be facing this neutral and the high seat was actually was actually much higher and yeah the icon screen was much lower so the bishop would come up to this high flight of stairs and set on a very high throne working towards the people this is a point of connection between the bishop that leads the service I was in Asia Minor actually his fall that I was examining a tell us where is Asia Minor for people later I was in Turkey technical turkeys examining a bus Byzantine fifth century cathedral and actually saw this wonderfully preserved High Sierra what went up and son already knows you go up about a flight of steps about like seven feet high because of course it's a representation of the sky the heavens the high seats also known as the high place by some it's located as silly a said in eastern part of the altar and the patriarch sits here during the reading of parts of the New Testament referring to the twelve disciples yes remember that only two Gospels the Nativity of Christ that is the Luca Matthew Luke yes because Mark the apocalyptic gospel starts the story of Jesus from his baptism and from John from the start of his mission and John again begins with this it's this wonderful emphasis on the Eternity of the Son of God in the beginning was the word the logos and then again carries on to the theophany narrative to the baptism of Christ now our two historians Matthew and Luke they begin with the Nativity with Christ's genealogy and Nativity in a very different way actually because the accuracy the later they painted kind of westernized version of the Nativity it's interesting that Matthew Luke could take a totally different approach when it comes to you know the people that they are writing to because the Gospel of Matthew is written for the Jews written in the Middle East written in Syria around the 68 68 70 AD it's really for the Jews Matthew must prove to the Jewish people that Christ is the Messiah to whom the prophets who these prophets had expected so he deals completely in Old Testament Jewish terms you know bringing up the genealogy from Abraham giving him major part of the Old Testament clothes and he tries to tie Christ's birth in with the reign of King Herod the king of Judea last great king of Israel something that no every Jew would understand oh I don't inherit the great was around I remember now Luke was also a Jew just like Matthew but I drew from a different part of the Middle East from northern Syria and a Hellenized he's writing for the Greek Roman audience so he is actually he doesn't mention Harold once he says he's telling us that this happened because you know some Roman creak sitting in the Mediterranean he might care less about the kingdom moving into dear some King of the Jews so he's saying this was at the time of the Roman governor queer eNOS who ordered the Roman census remembered the Roman census all over the Roman Empire and says of course we do so it ties in with that he's he gives the census narrative which actually does give some slight problems with dating actual Christ's birth because the Roman census was between the Year four and six ad some Christ might be if we take Christ's life before the death and resurrection he might be a bit younger than traditionally 33 yeah so we just sort of paid track again standing up now on the high seat or the high place and when the Cathedral here was demolished in 1931 this throne that we see at the back shot here was was kept and transferred to the Trinity Cathedral in st. Petersburg and now has been returned as the patriarch walks down from the high seat on February the 1st 2009 the 16th Patriarca Sergey said of the Russian Orthodox Church Kirill was enthroned here and every Orthodox temple has a high seat it's interesting that there are very different variations of how to read the Gospel as the Russians for them to do the Russian tradition tends to do it in a very very operatic fashion and ending in this kind of high-pitched note will in other traditions you might but it's actually the patriarch ambition for the older priests reading the gospel I'm not an erratic way but very very very very quietly very quietly so that the people will understand every word so now we go to this transition from the Liturgy of the word since the gospel has been read to the Liturgy of the faithful when the bread and wine will be concentrated and this will be the last major part combination of all of the mass of the man if I keep upon its am i neva oceans area partially he has done Kotori vigilant in the vast okie flight pyridinium karna can especially astana us not a mere stumble so the patriarch will say blaga dead him he will give thanks just as jesus gave thanks to the father before breaking the bread as described in the first book of corinthians those who go to the lord's table to receive the sacrament of the Eucharist also known as the lord's supper give thanks for the boundless love of God and celebrate the sacraments exactly that is an incredibly important emphasis that the central mystery of the Christian faith the central ceremony a central mystery not merely a ceremony is called the Eucharist Thanksgiving because Thanksgiving is perhaps the most important element of Christian life you know here's the problem because I mean all of us come from different Christian backgrounds for example sometimes might find themselves back by the behavior of many people who call themselves Christians who are Christians sometimes because they're very unhappy about the world and it's different manifestations they are unhappy the oh look at the world oh look at this guy this guy they're so simple this is so horrible this is we must all repent and so on and they still put so much emphasis on that that you have nothing but hate Christianity is not about that Christianity is not about the sour face the sour Pius faces it's about Thanksgiving thank you God for every good for every breath one cannot take communion one does not thank God for everything God has done everything good okay let's before this ceremony wraps up let's let's talk a little bit more generally if we may the patriarch Kirill said at his service that Christianity helps to cope with life's difficulties that sometimes the impression growing up in the West there may be some sort of crisis of identity people lack social guidance the support network falling values can Christianity help with that so there are there functions that you believe that Christianity and Orthodox Church plays a lot of functions attribute I don't think that it's right to say that Christianity has any function loving sources we might have no witness to our faith because again despite all of the great miracles and cathedrals and martyrs and saints of the past still our faith comes down to one thing a crucified Jew and an empty - nothing else anyone can mock us anyone can make fun of us moreover they should it's a healthy thing when leaders we should go raving on about our hurt religious feelings and about about blasphemy we should hardly accept that it's not compromise but accept it and give people love at home every day every day no it's like something that one of the great 16th century Saints said that we must strive at all costs to bring about the greater glory of God every single day if you think about it can be improved at least a little bit you know you wake up you have a headache or your stomach hurts and it's just about this afforable form of grado pepper or the horrible whether at least coast of the US or the lack of a cuddly winter in Moscow right now or the war in the Middle East for example there is devastation around well get yourself together look at yourself find the good that is given in your life your talents your inner or outer beauty your strengths find it with God's help and make the world a better place a little bit as much as you can you know from cleaning up your room to helping a man and lead up the way you know give a homeless person a five dollar bill and you make his today a better place because now he can buy at least a cup of hot coffee on this day call a relative with whom you have problems in the past don't react well sometimes at home or would love what we go through some kind of tribulations skip a visit to a bar and send money at least once a year to you know some Hospital that deals for example with kids with birth defects or cancer patients which is something like make the world a better place that is the church's mission the church not merely as an organization led by overdressed people but has made living community as the role of people who are Christians it's not about going out and reading it about the fact that oh they're reading war on Christmas manifesting the joys of Christmas to everyone to the people who do not necessarily share your views now we see the patriarch of Moscow commemorating all of the Orthodox Patriarch all of his brethren Cyprus Athens Albania Albania deserves a special mention because thank God he's still alive he's a wonderful man probably one of the greatest Orthodox primates that we have right now other stars this year the lottos a I think I spoken about him learning couple of times already during previous broadcasts a Greek theologian brilliant Greek theologian who left everything to go to become a missionary in Africa in the Church of Alexandria he not only that he serve in Congo in Kenya he managed to reinvigorate the Orthodox Church in Kenya as their special Kenya under the Patriot translating services in Swahili building schools kind of reinvigorating the seminary hospitals everything a lot of people owe his life to his service because I'm huge managed to bring medicine bring treatment to the villages bereft of everything and then he said he find what I've done here I'm feeling old that retiring lived in Athens wrote books everything was great then the ecumenical patriarch calls up and says well you know Conyers and Fela in Albania this was 1990 1991 and Albania was actually the only state which was one of the most radical communist states like North Korea the only state in Europe which actually managed you know the communist dictator and the Qadri managed to annihilate every single Orthodox Church every single Catholic Church every single mosque and every single synagogue the fasces came because he was supposed to look 15 percent of the population is Orthodox of Albania 15 percent are Catholics the great mother Teresa of Calcutta was actually in Albania learning and Albanian capitalist SES comes along finds only ruined churches that are churned into stables or some kinds of factories or something finds eight priests the youngest one was 64 years old nothing else I decided to stay and serve there and with under his guidance the Church of Albania was reborn right now there are thousands if one business Tirana once you one can see the great cathedrals yeah and there's actually wonderful Albanian Cathedral in Boston Albanian Cathedral of the Orthodox Church in America st. Nicholas Cathedral in Boston well what's interesting is that right now there are about eight bishops sixth bishops Albanian born young men hundreds of clergy thousands of people and the Albanian church is one of the most active social workers in very poor state of Albanians interesting was when we had the Kosovo and the families of the Muslim Kosovar Albanians began flooding in to Albania because of the war and again many of these people's fathers and husbands took part in the massacres against serves roughly cleansing the Albanians were doing cost about Albanians we're committing in horrible crimes destroying churches as well sometimes in retaliation sometimes a preliminary attack you know violence is bound in the Balkans and all parties in all ways so actually a lot of war starts were unhappy because I said listen our special you're the archbishop of Albania why are you feeding these refugees no the only organization in Albania that actually opened up hospitals in gave food and shelter to these Muslim refugees was the portraits Church in Albanian and people addressed Archbishop anastacio said they're not supposed to do this these people are the families of these people the terrorists are killing Orthodox Christians and destroying Orthodox churches and archbishop anastasi south central Iowa Christians what Christianity today see through our other brothers just people coming in with icons saying in the name of God we're gonna get rid of you that's not Christianity so when they can't come back to coastal so maybe at least someone won't think twice before desecrating a church for raping a nun before killing us because he saw true Christianity when people defend them and people help them no questions asked so that is actually the message out for the current ecumenical patriarch for you to advocate for these refugees coming in from the Middle East sometimes you know they're completely foreign sense violent people no one says capitulate but treat with the dignity or the honor and the I was reading the Bible yesterday and what struck me was not just the cross references to the symbols obviously in this service but also just how much of the language you use in our daily habits actually still come from the Bible and Christianity so just one example I thought the Land of Nod was just a fun Child's phrase referring to sleep but it's actually a term from the book of Genesis and my mother says the Sermon on the Mount remains the best life guide so so after a prayer they will often repeat either the choir or the public will say either I mean which is amen obviously yeah in English verily truthfully or Alleluia of course in international words yes or the God have mercy lord have mercy it's actually interesting that Christ was in fact the only person in Israel that broke the logic of the phrase you know Christ is the only one that actually says Amen before saying something else because Amen works in what way someone says something in the recipe of the people say Amen Christ is the only man in the history of Jewish spirituality of eight ancient Israel that actually breaks this down completely assessment first he says that men then he says the famous meaning that I'm not interested in men this is how is gonna be whether you like it or not and sometimes people say oh he is just an egomaniac it's not about egomania my dear brothers and sisters because that means I said Amen and this is how it's gonna be I said Amen and I will die for you whether you want it or not your salvation I give you everything needed for salvation now whether you will follow it or not that is up to you I'm not rating your will but as the great russian philosopher in collectors I have said that Christianity is the is a faith is a religion where God is not tried to rape mankind with kindness and with goodness you're gonna be good whether you want it or not it's not about that men have the freedom of will you know as I said in one of my theological lectures once uh-huh God is not interested in playing tennis with the wall in the gym he needs a life partner he gives men free will but he gives everything necessary for our salvation but you dies it gives this a sacrifice and waits for us and love and that is something that we celebrate in every Mass every liturgy that we should celebrate every day but most gift that is given to us many of the public know this by heart do you know could you tell us what is right now we are hearing the year faithful we cite the Nicene Creed in the Orthodox Church you hear the faithful all of the faith of all of the people can sing to to prayers the Lord's Prayer which will follow and the Nicene Creed which is basically the overall profession you know the profession of the Christian faith compiled during the first and second ecumenical councils in Nicaea 325 and at Constantinople in 381 so basically if we just we can read the text basically I think we believe God the Father Almighty maker of heaven and earth of all things visible Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten sandwhich begotten of the father before all ages light of light true God of True God begotten not made being of one substance with the Father but whom all things were made who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and it was incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was laid man and was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate and suffered and was buried and the third day he rose again and according to the Scriptures and ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of the Father from thence he shall come again with the glory to judge the living and the dead his kingdom shall have no end and in the Holy gold the spirit the Holy Spirit the Lord and giver of life who proceeded from the father who with the father and the son together is worshiped and glorified of whom the prophets have spoken and then what Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church we acknowledge one baptism and we look for the resurrection of the Dead and the life of the world to come amen so the text of first council of constantinople Nicene Creed from the Year 381 and here we see the future begin reciting these enough for a week but most the prayers of consecration are the liturgy and we see the create chalice because only one chalice is supposed to be placed on the altar and the tell us about the chalice yes they are tell us about the chalice the chalice there's supposed to be one chalice on the altar and we see as we see it's a huge chalice and later it's going to be at the body and blood of Christ which will be consecrated there will be distributed to smaller chalices and distribute it across the cathedral by different trees now in the original Roman Rite the Byzantine Rite and the oriental Orthodox rites the not only the clergy but the laypeople receive both the consecrated bread the body of Christ and the wine as well originally if we would've traveled down to the early Middle Ages and find herself the master liturgy we would come up and we would actually receive the bread from the hands of the priests and take a dog from the chalice of the wine then in the eleventh century this tradition kind of shifted because then the spoon was brought into the church heavy the bread would be put in the wine at what actually the clergy take the bread and the wine separately as did the Emperor's the Byzantine Emperor had the right to stand on the altar he took part in the procession and he took communion with the Deacons taking the bread separately and drinking of the chalice separately and the faithful obviously get the bread dunked in the wine given on the spoon there was an interesting Western invention as well because in the 10th 11th and 13th centuries the chalice was finally reserved only for the clergy and the lately people received the host the bread only the bread of course they still receive Communion in his fullness it doesn't really matter because both signifying Christ's body and blood and its completion but with in in Western and Western tradition they actually in the Latin tradition they invented the straw because he would actually come to the chalice and you would sip wine through this little straw which was known as the fistula and that survived until well finally it was by the late Middle Ages it was reserved only for the Pope of Rome and in the papal high mass 19 until 1964 actually the Pope would take communion of the wine through the special gold straw so there are different things the spoons and the straws were later the pitcher creeds these series of prayers of the enough culture known as family tree which basically means secret prayers not because they were secret but because they were read by the priests in the altar and would not clearly be heard by the flock and there was a great controversy about these prayers because a lot of people said well solely we're not supposed to the way people are not supposed to hear these prayers actually they are that's why thanks to microphones now they're read out loud so that all of the people can loudly hear them but there was this whole movement with you know a lot of conservative police trying to mumble that was quiet this morning so that no one will hear them is he speaking modern Russian now I seem to be understanding so it can be understood in English you know you will have depends on your background and education you will have no problems with twenty to forty percent I just understand it surprised because they are expecting because of to be a bug we are sue bloggers 'if bloggers relief as we chief prelim if that is via teams we Michiko here post Columbia and these are the words of collaboration when each Bishop must repeat the words of Christ instituted the sacrament of communion take eat this is my body which is broken for you take this cup and drink of that this is the my blood of the New Testament which was for you and for many so these words must be repeated every time of the bread of the wine could you just remind us is this reference to the Last Supper yes during the Last Supper Christ assembles his disciples the Twelve Apostles in the upper room in the household Sion on one side and he washes their feet which is an act of Holy Thursday you know this act of greatest humility and he obviously has this usual problem with misunderstanding overly pious Peter who says you shall not wash my feet and Christ as if you don't let me wash your feet are not going to be in the kingdom of heaven with me and it's okay they're not just the feet and the hands and the head do everything you know Peter does have these problems doing 180s in the gospel you know Peter has the Prince of the Apostles sorry at the rock and this is very important because Christ washes the feet of all of the Apostles including curious who was already in the process of betraying Christ already took the money already has the date set with the temple guard then Christ sleeves them and they sir and they feast lead of the Paschal Lamb because it's feature with baskets to pay staff the greatest Passover Feast and there he gives him the bread and the wine and this is a very important thing because what we see Orthodox and Catholics and Anglicans and Protestants flock together for especially the Orthodox and the Catholics for this mystery of Holy Communion which is of central importance in the mass from this adoration before the body of blood of Christ what's the significance we see Christ starts this sacrament he begins passing out the bread and the wine and doesn't care it he calling everyone to partake of the cup calling everyone to partake of the bread and to gather together in unity in love in Thanksgiving in mutual forgiveness and to commemorate him in this way that is why this feast is so important that is why Christians built such splendor under full churches that are spread throughout the world it's not to show off grandiose architecture not merely to show off wonderful music and art it's to build these places whoever will come for that very special encounter with Christ it's not the only encounter with God it's not the only encounter with Christ because with again one person can rightly say that you know I feel really in the Sun this unity with God when I'm alone how I can in the mountains of walking in the park or praying by myself and Christ talks about you know shutting yourself in the room and praying quietly that's all essential for a spiritual life that's an essential point of communications of God walking thinking being with the loved ones but this experience of coming in and fulfilling another request for us to come together you might hate the pious old lady that's sitting right in front of you you might hate someone that's singing out of tune you might feel incredibly tired and bored and you don't want to spend this hour and a half in church for half an hour depends on what right on tradition you're coming from but you must overcome yourself you must find the love for these people you must find the humility you must come and fulfill this request or because it can't become one with Christ if you cannot become one or at least kind enough to the overtly pious hypocritical off to your old lady and the pure cross for me right you must find that humility to come together that is the beauty of this service and through that you will be sanctified you will find new strength and this is the central mystery of the and it's very important that again Christ washes the feet of Judas gives him his body and blood as we spoken before Christ gives you everything you need for salvation it's up to you what you will expect to you what are some of the principles I think we see a little bit of iconography what are the principles of Russian iconography what iconography is basically theology and colorant as a theological manifestation through art one of the wonderful early Christian things that you know the the eye understands quicker than the ear meaning that you can have a bass baritone mumbling for hours and other hours about theology like you have right now but sometimes just standing in complete silence before a dreamer Bluffs Trinity would be enough to realize a lot of River probably the greatest seconds of all time yes so it's basically very strict artistic language very strict symbolic language that changed throughout the centuries retaining its basic symbolic nature and Russian iconography there is no one element that can describe Russian iconography every decade different something that a lot of people don't understand styles differ completely every 10 to 20 years something changes in different regions but the essence is the same with symbolic nature some people ask about the reasons why the expressions of people in icons Russian icons differs sometimes they don't seem to show either smiling or frowning it seems to be portrayed emotions in a different way could you explain that you understand see emotion is expressed in the language of iconography not only Russian but by santa georgian italian emotion is expressed through gesture through the hands for their positions for example java theologian standing under the cross of christ would be shown you know with his hand touching his hand and his face in a very particular kind of fashion as this about gesture of grief no one has ever depicted smiling or with his mouth open the icon is that one you see Christ depicted with a blessing gesture it's not simply a blessing gesture what's the blessing gesture can you describe with the three with your pinky you're not a little thing there's the ring finger and the thumb plays together like three fingers there on the right is right there on the icon and two fingers lift it up into the air that's not just a blessing that's a symbolic gesture witnessing - what price - say what - what he's witnessing - with the Holy Trinity the three fingers and the tuneage face of Christ we have that have the praying gestures the blessing gestures the gestures of mourning and suffering it's that form of language it's not supposed to be very sentimental emotional even though icons can be striking although some smiles to come into the eye sometimes for example I remember a wonderful 15th century icon that I've seen the new tragic gallery in Moscow from central Russia where it's the icon of the Nativity and if you look closely at the donkey and the world that are warming Christ with their breaths you know because the animals are always depicted there this manifestation of nature you know Christ is feeling cold and the animals come to have their breath nature glorifies the world glorifies Christ and the bull is actually depicted in this very very kind smile incredibly emotional if she Ocoee peace cups floor Provo's lamas issue Darwish with him to encircle mediate Selleck chairs next Ramadan begins will she probably sheets logo for the commemoration of the patriarch of Moscow in this case the patriarch does not condemn irate himself maybe some pitchers would like to it doesn't happen he's collaborated separately by the senior of the curve in this case senior sister this is the new Archdeacon wonderful old Archdeacon father every Muslim who served until he was almost 90 years old with a

people may be able to understand and international words are feasible and Piscopo yes the International Christian I squeezed Greek words like the word liturgy in Russian little gear talking to people that defines that a lot of them don't know for some reason that actually the Greek word Christ listos is the word Messiah The Anointed One I'm one of them okay and I studied ancient Greek didn't know one fun fact the word Messiah al-maseeh Messiah is the Aramaic word for the Anointed One again here we go with the anointment of Mayor Aaron of the kings of Israel The Anointed One be chosen Aramaic is tell us about what is Aramaic Aramaic is the one of the Semitic languages in the Middle East which was the spoken popular language in the time of Christ later on it was kind of supplanted by Arabic especially with the Arab Muslim conquest of them at least but there are still communities that speak Arabic has their own so there are living Christian communities that pray in the language of Christ and speak the language of Christ to the Apostles especially most of them are in Syria north of Damascus the communities in maaloula inside the Nile with Orthodox and Greek Catholic members so we've got a mix of languages really hallelujah is from Hebrew Hebrew so they're makin Messiah means the chosen one of it and the Anointed One the Anointed One if you translate that into Greece Greek it's Christos Christmas Christos Jesus Christ is basically Jesus dark messiah from the latin this time altars meaning high as in high seeds of birthplace and we see the empty chalices being prepared through to which the body and blood of christ would be distributed and right now very soon the all the people will sing the Lord's Prayer and then the Royal gate towards would be closed and the clergy will take given Holy Communion that's the time that usually are broadcast holy table may only be touched by ordained members of the hierarchy or bishops Archbishop's or deacons and nothing which is not itself consecrated or an object of veneration can be placed on it just no one can turn its back on it and once you go into the altar you're suppose to prostrate the process prostrate yourself before the altar and icons are usually blessed by laying them on the holy table yes for some divine liturgies they're sprinkled with holy water then the ultra area is actually consecrated even with the bishop actually taking this huge staff and anointing the altar wall not not always present in russian tradition but in the Middle East and in Greece that still the case like you anoint a living person you know and confirm his place Abbey Church and here we see the people reading the Lord's Prayer we have just spoken about the we have just spoken about the what for image of unity actually Catholic invited Catholic and Armenian priest which do not have full communion with your thoughts church reciting the Lord's Prayer wholeheartedly and we saw a wonderful Russian Catholic bishop because the Catholic Church is present in Russia is an italian-born wonderful man the chaplet an archbishop paul petsi the man who's reading the also the you know reopening of catholic churches because we must remember that catholics suffer just as bad as the authors there are far less Catholics in the Soviet Union but they suffered immensely and they were their churches were destroyed they were usually killed off is a little greater percentage wise and greater numbers than the Orthodox so the Lord's Prayer we just spoke about Aramaic if everyone knows the Lord's Prayer but if you want we can kind of narrated and just said in the language of Christ added English if you read English text would you like to read the English version so there's three versions that lastly 1928 1662 and 1988 each one is by the e LLC our Father in heaven Hallowed be your name your kingdom come your will be done on earth as in heaven give us today our daily bread forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us save us from the time of trial and deliver us from evil for the kingdom the power and the glory are yours now and forever amen and in the language of Christ as Christ has spoken it on the Sermon on the Mount it sounds as foolish Maya heat conduction that the mulcher to the Deaf Saviano H energy shreya para la Lala what super nerdy bother you should like they a Jeanette above none should not hire him Allah Tala listeni la posada indicia with tilde low high right shoe starts to wear la disco dust la la Alvie Emilio wonderful world language is there that's Arabic that's the price that's two words that we said we spoke without Russian accent now the doors of the altar are closed to the bread and the wine are consecrated and the clergy will take Holy Communion the bread and the wine as I said before the clergy and the in most rocks Emperor's took the communion separately as was the medieval tradition within bread being taken separately and the wine and of course this moment and the liturgy signifies the death and resurrection of Christ because we can the Shatt royal door signify the closed tomb of Christ and then there will be opened and Charles to be brought out as the resurrected Christ is leaving the tomb on Golgotha it's actually very interesting that last year there was a massive restoration process undertaken by the archaeological Institute of Israel and this wonderful team of scholars the in the Cathedral of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and it was interesting when they were excavating the place where that was supposed to be Christ's tomb and were uncovering the modern slab of stone and opening the Crusader low level of suddenly they had a very interesting there was an electromagnetic impulse and these are secular scholars they're not religious fanatics they had an electromagnetic impulse that blocked out all of the machinery for a while this is this kind of very very interesting moment and of course there was a lot of arguing about it's not really the place of Christ was buried or is that just the fourth century location in the Armenian Quarter they found second century graffiti Christian an image of a ship in a Greek inscription Lord we came this is in the time when there was no no Church there are no chapel Jerusalem was razed to the ground and then completely rebuilt as a Roman town and then therefore Adrian built II he the temple right on top of the place of Christ various but that's the witness that at that time the Christians will come at least stand there at the foundation of the heathen temple near the cave of Christ burial at resurrection and left graffiti is very one of the earliest depictions of Christian art this ship and this word Lord we came what is the choir singing it's made a lot of from the Old Testament and the New Testament a lot of Byzantine there are hymnography from the sixth and the eighth and the ninth centuries actually one of the very important element is the trapar ian and Kentuckian the two main hymns of the Nativity the partying is goes as follows your nativity in Christ our God show to the world the light of wisdom for buying those who worship the Stars we've taught by a start of the Williams the Sun of righteousness and to know you the Orient from on high or Lord glory to unity fish and the answer the Kentuckian is today the Virgin gives birth to the transcendent one and the earth offers a cave to the unapproachable one angels with Shepherds glorify Him the wise men's journey with a star since for our sake the eternal God was born as a little child now if you think about it this is another manifestation another witness to the fact that Christianity is a faith of the paradox because in this piece do you have one how do you have just a bunch of Jewish Shepherds wandering around Bethlehem with a bunch of sheep and angels from heaven and all of them are united in the love and unity of the small infant who is God who is coming into the world the same thing you know when the Apostle Paul says that we believe in Christ which to the Jews as temptation and to the Helene's it's madness and here you have three wise men going across the world
