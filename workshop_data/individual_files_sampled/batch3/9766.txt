STEVE: HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN JOINS US FROM STATUTORY HALL IN THE U.S. CAPITOL, MR. SPEAKER, NOW FROM MIDTERM ELECTIONS YOU WILL DO ALL YOU CAN TO RAISE MONEY FOR REPUBLICANS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE REPUBLICANS DON'T LOSE THE HOUSE. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT? FIRST OF ALL, GOOD MORNING, STEVE, AINSLEY AND BRIAN, GREAT TELL THE STORY OF WHAT WE'VE DONE. LOOK, TWO YEARS AGO HOUSE REPUBLICANS RAN ON A PLATFORM CALLED THE BETTER WAY AND THEN ALONG WITH THE NEWLY ELECTED GOING TO DO, KEPT PROMPTS AND ENACTED A PROMISING AGENDA HOME AND ABROAD, WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, WE ARE CONFRONTING THE OPIOIDS CRISIS, LOOK, WE NOW ARE SHOWING THAT WE ARE BETTER OFF NOW, YOU CAN GO TO BETTER.GOV THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES, 4% UNEMPLOYMENT. MORE JOB OPENINGS THAN PEOPLE LOOKING FOR WORK IN AMERICA TODAY, WAGES ARE UP, THE ECONOMY IS SOARING, THESE ARE GOOD THINGS AND GREAT RESULTS TO RUN ON. WE WILL TALK TO PEOPLE, WHAT DO GUARANTIED JOB, THEY WANT TO GET RID OF PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE AND HAVE GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. A REALLY GOOD TRACK RECORD AND FALL. BRIAN: YOU DID PROMISE THAT YOU WILL GET ANOTHER IMMIGRATION BILL OUT THERE AND YOU PROMISED IT TO SOME REPUBLICAN MEMBERS, DENISE ROSS AND THEY WANT ESPECIALLY GUEST WORKER PROGRAM WELL, SO THE VERY MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HAVE ASKEDTOUS HOLD ASKED US TO HOLD ON HAVING THE VOTE. WE WORK WITH AGRICULTURE MEMBERS SO WE HAVE VOTES LINED UP BEFORE WE TAKE IT TO THE FLOOR, WE ARE NOT QUITE THERE YET. THEY WANT TO SPEND AUGUST BREAK WORKING ON THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. AINSLEY: YOU ONLY HAVE NINE FULL DAYS, ONLY NINE FULL DAYS UNTIL THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THAT'S YEAH, RIGHT. WE HAVE A LOT TO DO. A LOT TO DO. AINSLEY: WHAT'S THE AGENDA, WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING? SO JUST THIS WEEK WE ARE WILL FINISH TODAY OUR CAREER IN TECHNICAL EDUCATION BILL, COMPLETE OVERHAUL, CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION, THAT'S THIS IS OUR GOAL TO FOCUS ON CLOSING SKILLS GAP, AND THEN WHEN WE COME BACK, WE WILL WORK ON MAKING TAX CUTS PERMIT, APPROPRIATION BILLS AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE BIG OMNIBUS AT END OF THE DAY AND PASS APPROPRIATION BILLS AND PLAN TO DO THAT AND ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS THAT WE ARE WORKING, THE PRESIDENT'S INFRASTRUCTURE AGENDA THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT GETTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS AS WELL. STEVE: THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO FUND ANOTHER ONE LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHY WE ARE TRYING TO BREAK IT UP IN OLD PIECES. LIKE THE OLD DAYS. THE HOUSE HAS ALWAYS DONE THIS. YOU HAVE A NEW CHAIRMAN OVER THERE, SHELBY, THEY ARE ACTUALLY PASSING APPROPRIATION BILLS, THIS YEAR HOPEFULLY WILL BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SENATE ACTUALLY DOING APPROPRIATIONS THIS YEAR. BRIAN: YOU WILL VISIT WITH THE IS THAT CORRECT? WELL, LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT A WHOLE SWLUI OF ISSUES AND HOW TO GET THE APPROPRIATION PROCESS BACK ON TRACK SO AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE DON'T HAVE ONE GIANT OMNIBUS APPROPRIATION BILL. NOBODY WANTS THAT, THE SENATE IS ENGAGED SO WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER PLAN WITH THE SENATE TO GET APPROPRIATIONS DONE SEPARATELY BUDGET, ON SCHEDULE THIS YEAR AND THAT'S THE PRIMARY CONCERN. BRIAN: 5 BILLION ACCURATE? THAT. THEY'VE CHANGED ORIGINAL GOTTEN SO FAR? THE PRESIDENT WANTED 25 BILLION? ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST, THE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ASKED FOR 1.6 BILLION, THAT HAS BEEN FUNDED AND THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. THAT CONSTRUCTION IS NOW OCCURRING. SO THERE IS THERE'S BEING MONEY SPENT ON THE WALL ON THE BORDER.
