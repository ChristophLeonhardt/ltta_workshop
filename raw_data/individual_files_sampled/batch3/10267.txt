despite the controversy surrounding brexit the UK's decision to go it alone has inspired people in other countries a new political party in Ireland whose mission will be for Dublin to quit the EU is being officially launched later on Saturday the IR exit for freedom party wants independence from Brussels it will seek to put the Irish people themselves in charge of all spheres of life the party plans to run candidates for the upcoming national and European elections ray Basset a former Irish ambassador and one of the backers of IR exit for freedom says that the party still wants good economic relations with Europe Ireland left the European Union I would like us to stay in the European Economic Area and I think the whole idea of moving around the Erasmus problems there aren't very good but they shouldn't come with a political price that you've just sort of beef up your military let's just to change a tax system like you know you have difficulty and holding other public utilities it's the political part of the European Union which is scaring people off the Irish government's attitude here today to the Braxtons negotiation at the moment that's completely baffling it's quite clear that our interest lies in getting the United Kingdom a good deal because we are so dependent if there's some people in Ireland who are I've still got lingering anger phobia and they would be probably prepared to be much more hardline even if it damaged our interests as long as the damaged United Kingdom I find that argument perverse meanwhile a recent poll found that just 11 percent of Irish citizens want their country to leave the European Union some people told us why it may be a bad idea the benefits that Ireland's home from being a member of the EU since 73 is absolutely incredible I think it would be absolutely devastating for our country if we were to leave it so no I would definitely not be voting for us what would we benefit from leaving and what we lose to leave she would have to sit there and have a good look at that before you do anything else joining but now I'd say it would be disaster I don't really think it's a good idea for our Ang Lee do you because we're kind of an island nation on the western pics of Europe so Ireland's benefited a lot from EU support for our exit is low but going forward because we will be the first party making an argument for Ireland to leave the EU and take back its democratic parts as we make the case the the popularity of the cause will increase for sure the political and media class on Ireland are almost a man and woman completely pro we you we as I Rex at Freedom Party will be like almost like rebels with a cause those fighting for freedom those going we will be the contrarians and an electoral terms that is a good position to be in you
