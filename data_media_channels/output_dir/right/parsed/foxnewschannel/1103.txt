IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU COULDN'T
HAVE SCRIPTED IT.
ALL RIGHT, KRISTIN FISHER,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANKS.
>> Shannon: A REPORT RELEASED
BY SENATE REPUBLICANS TODAY SAYS
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
DELIBERATELY MISLED THE PUBLIC
AND CONGRESS BY GRANTING A
IRAN TO ACCESS THE FINANCIAL
SYSTEM RIGHT HERE IN THE U.S. BY
SIDESTEPPING SANCTIONS.
FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS SAY IT
WAS ALL PART OF THE SPIRIT OF
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, PART OF
THE BENEFITS THEY PROMISED TO
IRAN.
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE'S
PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON
INVESTIGATIONS, SENATOR ROB
PORTMAN, JOINED US NOT TO
DISCUSS THIS REPORT THAT HAS A
LOT OF PEOPLE BY SURPRISE.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Shannon: WHAT WAS GOING ON
HERE?
WHAT DID YOU UNCOVER?
>> WE SPENT TWO YEARS LOOKING AT
THIS, BECAUSE OF THE RUMORS THAT
THERE WAS SOME SORT OF A
SANCTIONS VIOLATION BY THE
ADMINISTRATION, THEY HAD ALLOWED
IRAN TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
WE JUST DID A LOT OF INTERVIEWS
AND TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND
WERE ABLE TO GET EMAILS THAT
OTHERS HAD NOT RECEIVED, AND IT
BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT WHAT
HAPPENED WAS THE ADMINISTRATION
CHOSE TO MISLEAD CONGRESS, AND
MISLEAD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BY
SAYING THEY ARE NOT GETTING
ACCESS TO THE U.S. BANKS, THE
U.S. DOLLAR, THE U.S. FINANCIAL
SYSTEM, WHEN IN FACT THEY
GRANTED THEM A SPECIFIC LICENSE
TO DO SO.
>> Shannon: WE WANT TO PLAY A
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT TWO TOP
TREASURY OFFICIALS, INCLUDING
THEN TREASURY SECRETARY HAD TO
SAY ABOUT THIS.
>> IRAN WILL CONTINUE TO BE
DENIED ACCESS TO THE WORLD'S
LARGEST MARKET, AND WILL
MAINTAIN POWERFUL SANCTIONS.
>> IRAN WILL BE DENIED ACCESS TO
THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT
MARKET AND UNABLE TO DEAL IN THE
WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT CURRENCY.
>> Shannon: THAT WAS BACK IN
2015.
SHORTLY AFTER THE DEAL HAD COME
TOGETHER.
WHAT YOU LATER FOUND, IN THE
SPRING OF 2016, THIS
ADMINISTRATION, THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION, ACTUALLY GRANTED
A LICENSE WHICH WOULD HAVE
ALLOWED THEM TO DO WHAT THEY
NEEDED TO DO, WHICH WAS GET THE
CURRENCY TRANSLATED INTO
SOMETHING IF THEY COULD THEN
SEND, AND THEY WERE ANGRY WITH
THE ADMINISTRATION, FRUSTRATED
THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE
GETTING WHAT THEY HAD AGREED TO
UNDER THE DEAL.
>> $5.8 BILLION.
IN A BANK IN OMAN, AND THEY
WANTED TO CONVERT THAT INTO
EUROS ULTIMATELY, TRUE DOLLARS,
SINCE THEY HAD A
DOLLAR-DENOMINATED CURRENCY,
BETTER TO DO DOLLARS.
THEY ASKED THE TREASURY
DEPARTMENT IF THEY COULD GET THE
ABILITY TO DO THAT AND SURE
ENOUGH, THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT
GRANTED THEM A LICENSE TO DO
THAT.
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THEY WENT
TO THE TWO BIG U.S. BANKS, THE
APPROPRIATE BANKS TO DO THIS,
BOTH BANKS SAID, NO, WE WANTS
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
THIS IS WRONG.
IN OTHER WORDS, THE REPUTATIONAL
RISK OR LESS AND LEGAL RISKS
WERE TOO HIGH.
ULTIMATELY, THE DOLLARS WERE NOT
PROVIDED TO CONVERT THAT
CURRENCY.
OVER TIME, THEY CONVERTED TO
EUROS, AS WE UNDERSTAND IT,
SMALL AMOUNTS IN EUROPE, MUCH
LESS EFFICIENTLY.
THE POINT IS, AT THAT TIME, THE
ADMINISTRATION WAS SAYING, WE
ARE NOT ALLOWING THE U.S.
FINANCIAL SYSTEM TO BE USED, WE
ARE NOT ALLOWING THE DOLLAR TO
BE USED, KEEPING THE SANCTIONS
IN PLACE, ONLY THE SECONDARY
SANCTIONS AND OTHERS ARE WE
ALLOWING THE ARRAY NEEDS TO HAVE
ACCESS TO, WHEN IN FACT, THEY
WERE GRANTING THIS LICENSE.
IT'S JUST WRONG.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FLUSH
THAT OUT BECAUSE NOW WITH REGARD
TO THE NEXT IRAN AGREEMENT, OR
WITH REGARD TO THE AGREEMENT
WITH NORTH KOREA, WILL REQUIRE
MORE TRANSPARENCY AND IT IS PART
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS.
>> Shannon: SOME RESPONSE TO
THE REPORT, NET PRICE, PART OF
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYS,
"THEY CONTINUE TO MALIGN THE
DEAL IN AN EFFORT TO JUSTIFY
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S UNJUSTIFIABLE
DECISION."
REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WITHDRAWN
FROM THE DEAL.
THEY SAY THIS IS ABOUT
BESMIRCHING THE DEAL AND NOTHING
MORE.
SPEAK OF THIS INVESTIGATION IS
TWO YEARS OLD.
IT BEGAN LONG BEFORE
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT,
MUCH MORE THAT HE WOULD PULL OUT
OF THE IRAN AGREEMENT.
BUT IT WAS DONE IN A TOTALLY
STRAIGHT UP, OBJECTIVE WAY.
WE FOUND THAT THIS HAD OCCURRED,
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT.
AND AGAIN, FOR THE FUTURE, THAT
WE HAVE BETTER TRANSPARENCY.
ANYTIME THERE'S A SPECIAL
LICENSE GRANTED, CONGRESS OUGHT
TO KNOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
OFTEN OPERATE IN THIS CASE, IT
WAS KEPT FROM US.
BECAUSE, AS HE SAID EARLIER,
IRAN WAS FRUSTRATED, ANGRY, WE
KNEW THIS FROM PUBLIC AND
PRIVATE DOCUMENTS, THEY WANTED
TO BE SURE IRAN WOULD STAY WITH
THE AGREEMENT, AND SO THEY WERE
WILLING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS
COUNTERS ARE NOT JUST WITH A
WITH ED TO DO, BUT COUNTER TO
THE APPROACH HERE, WHICH WAS
THAT HE WAS SANCTIONS WOULD
STAY IN PLACE.
>> Shannon: IS THERE ANY LEGAL
LIABILITY HERE?
WHAT DOES IT SAY TO YOU MORE
BROADLY ABOUT THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO GET
THEN LOGIN AND KEEP THIS DEAL IN
PLACE?
>> IT SAYS THAT THEY WERE
WILLING TO DO THINGS THAT THEY
SHOULD NOT DO IN ORDER TO BOTH
GET THE IRANIANS TO THE TABLE,
AND THEN KEEP IT AT THE TABLE,
AND HOLD THE AGREEMENT.
THERE WAS A VOTE IN THE
UNITED STATES SENATE, PEOPLE
FORGET ABOUT THE SOMETIMES.
THE VOTE WAS A MAJORITY
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT VOTE
AGAINST THE IRAN AGREEMENT.
IT WASN'T NECESSARY TWO-THIRDS,
WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE HAD UNDER
THE RULES.
BUT IT WAS A VOTE AGAINST IT.
NORMALLY, IF YOU'VE A TREATY,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TWO-THIRDS
VOTE TO APPROVE IT.
EVEN IF THEY KNEW THEY COULDN'T
GET THAT, THEY DO NOT SEEK THIS
TO BE A TREATY.
WHEN THERE WAS A VOTE ON THIS
ISSUE IN CONGRESS, SURE ENOUGH,
A MAJORITY OF THE CONGRESS SAID,
THIS IS NOT A GOOD AGREEMENT.
AND I THINK THAT IS ONE REASON
THE PRESIDENT CHOSE, BECAUSE HE
WAS ABLE TO COME WITHOUT HAVING
A TREATY, TO PULL BACK AND TO
SAY, LET'S PUT TOGETHER
SOMETHING THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.
>> Shannon: I KNOW IT'S BEEN A
LONG PROCESS, FLEW UNDER OUR
RADAR.
WE HAD NO IDEA.
DEMOCRATS ALSO WORKED WITH YOU
ON THIS, CHOSE NOT TO SIGN THE
FINAL PRODUCT, BUT THEY WERE A
