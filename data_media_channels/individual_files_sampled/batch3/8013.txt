YOU KNOW IT WELL HAVING SPENT MANY YEARS THERE COVERING IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES ARE SCIENTIFIC TO KEEP THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT ALIVE, BECAUSE IN PART OF THEIR INVESTMENTS. JOINING ME ADAM IS JOINING ME. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT. THANKS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS THE EUROPEAN CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE. THE FRENCH FOREIGN FINANCE MINISTER SAYS DO WE WANT TO U.S. TO BE TO ECONOMIC POLICEMEN OF THE PLANET OR TO WE WANT US EUROPEANS TO SAY WE WANT TO HAVE ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN INSIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF A STRATEGIC DEAL WITH IRAN WHICH INCLUDES IRAN'S RENOUNCE INCLUDES IRAN'S RENOUNCING TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT'S OUR TRANSLATION OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS IF THE U.S. IS GOING TO SANCTION ANYONE ADOPTION BUSINESS WITH IRAN, WHAT DOES THAT DO WITH REGARD TO THE EU. I THINK IT MAKES IT CLEAR TO THE EU THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET BACK ON BOARD WITH SANCTIONS. YOU CAN MAKE A CHOICE EITHER DO BUSINESS WITH THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, OR YOUR GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN, WHO BY THE WAY, IS ACTUALLY DOING BAD ACTIONS. SO I GET IT, THE EUROPE'S ARE UPSET, THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ONES TO TAKE LEADS ON FOREIGN APPEALS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY GET SELF INTERESTED. BUT WE'RE DIFFERENT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A MISSION, AND WE HAVE BROAD THINGS, ONE OF THOSE PEACE FOR ISRAEL, AND ENSURING THAT IRAN NEVER GETS A NUCLEAR WEAPON EVER. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE EFFORTS BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO CULTIVATE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE GULF STATES WITH ARABS AND THEIR INTERESTS IN THE REGION WHILE ALSO, LOOKING OUT FOR ISRAEL AT AS OUR NEWLY ONE ALLY THERE, BUT BUILDING THOSE BRIDGES THAT MAYBE HAVE NOT BEEN SO STRONG IN THE PAST? YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY AMAZING. THERE'S STILL A LITTLE CONFLICT WITH QATAR AND THEIR NEIGHBORS THERE. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ALIGNMENT OF KIND OF SUNI INTEREST, THE SAUDIS WITH EVEN ISRAEL AND NOW TALKING AND FLYING BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES, BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES, ONGOING, BUT THEIR MAJOR DIFFERENTIALS ARE WITH IRAN. IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T LIKE THE NAME, OR THIS IRANIAN PEOPLE. BUT IT'S BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP IS DEAD SET ON DESTABILIZATION OF THE REGION AND DESTROYING ANY PEACE THAT EXISTS THERE AND WE'VE SEEN IT WITH 150,000 ROCKETS POINTED AT ISRAEL. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY IS KIND OF UNIQUELY COMING INTO ALIGNMENT ON TO SAY IT'S TIME TO CONFRONT THIS, THESE PEOPLE WHO CALL ISRAEL LITTLE SATAN AND THE UNITED STATES GREAT SATAN. NOW LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A BIT OF A COOLING OFF. THEIRING LEADERS ARE SAYING THEY DON'T WANT THIS TO PHYSICALITY. BUT ISRAEL BEING CLEAR THEY WILL NOT TAKE ANY CROSSING OF RED LINE WHEN IT COPS TO THEIR INCONSISTENCY AND SAFETY AS IRAN CONTINUES TO BUILD UP A PRESENCE IN SYRIA. LET'S GO TO A DIFFERENT PART OF THE GLOBE. NORTH KOREA A LOT OF ACTION ON THAT FRONT. SEVERAL WEEKS, BUT THIS WEEK OBVIOUSLY GET THE THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES BACK AND MANY OTHER CONVERSATIONS CONTINUING. TODAY SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO SAYING WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE A ENEMY. WE WANT THEM TO BE A CLOSE PARTNER, BUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYING WE HAVE A LOT OF CAUTION GOING INTO THIS MEETING. HERE'S HERTZ FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE REALISTIC AND CLEAR-EYED ABOUT THIS, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT AND EVERY ATTEMPT TOO FULFILL PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLICY. WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM THAT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ALL OF OUR EFFORTS. WANT WANTING TO OUR QUICK TAKE ON MOVING INTO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS NOW. SO I THINK SECRETARY POMPEO IS SAYING THE RIGHT THING, WHICH IS LOOK, WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. NOW IF YOU COME TO THE TABLE AND COMPLETELY PERMANENTLY AND DEE NUCLEAR RISE. THERE'S GOING TO BE CARROTS FOR YOU. I THINK KIM JONG-UN NEEDS TO KNOW AND PROBABLY DOES, THIS IS THE HEIGHT OF DIPLOMACY IF THIS FAILS, I HATE TO SEE WHAT COMES
