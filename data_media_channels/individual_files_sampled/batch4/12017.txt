administration so we've been hearing non-stop from the media that President Trump is the worst liar in history his administration just lies and lies and lies and lies and we here on the bench Shapiro show have called balls and strikes when President Trump says something that I don't think is true I will tell you that I think that he said something that is true and I will hammer him if I think that he did something wrong I'm happy to do that because he's the President of the United States and it is our job to call the President on the of the United States when he does something wrong but one of the things that conservatives find so incredibly galling about the media coverage of President Trump is that the media are so eager to use the word lie about President Trump in every possible context but they will refrain in every possible context from using the word lie about President Obama and they did for years well turns out today his stunning report from The Associated Press the Obama administration shock of shocks was lying to the American people for years on end about helping out the Iranian mullahs so when we talk about President Trump lying when media talk about it usually what they are talking about his president Trump is fibbing about his inauguration crowd or President Trump is fibbing about a note that he wrote about Donald Trump jr. and a Trump Tower meeting something like that something that really has very little to do with governance per se President Obama lied about key areas of American governance in a way that President Trump never has President Obama lied repeatedly about Obama care he said if you liked your doctor you could keep your doctor that was a complete lie and he kept lying about it over and over and over and what's hilarious is that the media covered for him at the time I believe it was PolitiFact that originally said that that statement was half true and then three years later when it turns out that it was a lie all along they called it their lie of the year which is just incredible and demonstrates how biased all of these sources are President Obama lied repeatedly about his treatment of illegal immigration he said 22 times he did not have the executive authority to unilaterally suspend enforcement of immigration law and then what did he do he unilaterally suspended enforcement of immigration laws he lied two dozen times about that issue and the media basically let him get away with it the Obama administration lied repeatedly about Benghazi in the aftermath of the murder of four Americans in Benghazi and a terrorist attack a pre-planned parrot terrorist attack the Obama administration lied and lied and lied first they lied but they had not denied security then they lied and said that the whole thing had been caused by a YouTube video when it clearly had not been caused by a YouTube video they they lied repeatedly they lied when it came to the IRS the Obama administration lied on issues of serious national policy they Trump lies because that's what Trump does about silly things on a lot of a lot of issues right Trump will fib for example about the Philadelphia Eagles kneeling for the national anthem and I'll smack him on it as I did yesterday show but typically the stuff that Trump lies about tends to be rather small potatoes when you compare it to the actual central policy ramifications of the stuff that President Obama lied about today's story from The Associated Press is the most obvious example so according to the Associated Press the Obama administration attempted to end-around its own sanctions in order to give cash to the worst terror sponsor on the planet so while the Obama administration was pitching the Iran deal while they were suggesting the Iran deal was going to be some sort of great savior of the moderates inside Iran and at the same time saying that Iran was not pursuing terrorism they had sanctions in place but the Obama administration was attempting to end around those sanctions and they were lying to the American people about it at the time according to the AP quote the report by the Senate permanent Subcommittee on investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016 never previously disclosed that would have allowed Iran to convert 5.7 billion dollars it held in a bank in Oman from Omani rial into euros by exchanging them first into US dollars if the Omani Bank had allowed the exchange without such a license it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the US financial system so in other words Iran in order to use its capital has to transfer has to transform it into Omani rial these are very difficult to then transfer into American dollars unless there's a waiver and President Obama was secretly pursuing just that sort of waiver so basically what happened is that the Obama administration went to a bunch of American banks and tried to get American banks to go along with violations of American sanctions they issue them a waiver and these banks said no the bank said listen we don't want to be caught up in the middle of this we're not gonna run money for Iran on your behalf only the fact that US banks did not want to violate American law prevented Iran from getting a TENS on five point seven billion dollars more in American dollars Senator Rob Portman from Ohio he says what the Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran so at the same time that Obama was pursuing this Iranian deal which was a garbage deal from the very beginning they were lying to the American people saying the sanctions were fully enforced and that they had no intention of becoming money launderers essentially for the Iranian regime at the very time they were attempting essentially money-laundering from the Iranian regime the Obama administration repeatedly lied over and over again about their supposed a willingness to allow Iran access to the US financial system Obama Treasury secretary Jack Lew even testified before Congress to that effect which could amount to perjury so what is Team Obama have to say about the fact that they were trying to help out Iran so Iran could avoid sanctions passed by the United States Congress held globally what was Obama saying at the time well they were saying that they weren't doing it and now what are they saying unnamed Obama officials according to the AP said they were acting quote in line with the spirit of the deal so they weren't in the acting in line with the letter of the law they were acting in line with the spirit of the deal which is apparently to give away the store and bend over backwards for the worst terror regime on the planet they said the lies were justified because they were attempting to debunk arguments that team Obama wanted to get even more concessions to the Iranians so in other words people were saying you're bending over backward from Iran for Iran and so team Obama lied about bending over backward for Iran to prove that they weren't bending over backward for Iran yeah well done guys and some of my car doing that Bill Clinton didn't lie about sex with Monica Lewinsky he just wanted to debunk rumors that he had sex with an intern and it turns out the Obama administration activity on behalf of Iran went even further in March 2016 is according to the AP is not a right one news source according to the Associated Press in March 2016 Obama officials including the execrable Secretary of State John Kerry quote fanned out across Europe Asia and the Middle East trying to convince banks and businesses that could do business with Iran without violating sanctions and facing steep fines so the Iranians were complaining listen you guys want us to sign a deal with you and we have signed a deal with you but we're not seeing the benefits of this deal so why don't you go out there and act as our PR agents and Team Obama said sure let's do it let's go out there let's be around friends well go out there we will be there foreign ministry and so the Obama administration was the foreign ministry for the Iranian government they talk about collusion with Russia by the Trump administration the same Trump administration that has killed some hundreds of Russians in Syria the same Trump administration that is armed Ukrainian resistance with lethal weaponry they talk about Trump collusion with Russia you don't say about collusion the Obama administration was covertly playing foreign ministry for the worst terror regime on planet earth that was covertly pursuing nuclear weapons as it turns out there's another story in a second that I'm gonna tell you the AP continues in the same week the AP reported that the Treasury had prepared a draft of a license that would have given Iran much broader permission to convert its assets from foreign currencies into easier to spend currencies like yen or rupees by first exchanging them for dollars in offshore financial institutions the draft involved a general license a blanket go ahead that allows all transactions of a certain type rather than a specific license like the one given to a man's bank Muscat which only covers specific transactions and institutions the proposal would have allowed dollars to be used in currency exchanges provided that no Iranian banks no Iranian reals and no sanctioned Iranian individuals or businesses were involved and that the transaction did not begin or end in u.s. dollars in other words they're going to cover this up as far as it could possibly go but it was the American government helping out the Iranian government Obama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license would not be coming but the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared that was never published so in other words they were pursuing it at the same time they were lying and saying they weren't pursuing it when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting around any kind of access to the US financial system Obama era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat and Oman had been issued two months earlier so they lied about this I mean this is perjurious stuff and this is criminal stuff and yet the Obama administration we were told that they were honest they were clean as the driven snow just absolutely pure and by the way is the second deal this week demonstrating the team Obama lied to Americans about the Iran deal that Iran's yield that Obama treasured so dearly President Obama believed that Iran should become a regional power by granting it more power it would moderate Iran an insane proposal but tied into President Obama's misconceptions about the nature of Shia Islam and the Muslim world in particular and so here is the second story that is a serious problem for the Obama administration if anyone cared in the media on Tuesday and by the way I should but I should mention of course the AP is reporting this so it's not everybody in the media ignoring this but why is that the media were so happy to go along with all of these lies for eight long years in only two years after Obama leaves office we find out about this on Tuesday the Iranian government announced they've completed a new centrifuge assembly at their Natanz facility that's just a month after President Trump killed the Iran nuclear deal which is sort of suspicious since we were assured that the Iranians had dismantled all of their nuclear capacities that the Iranians were going to dismantle those nuclear capacities for the next ten years and they weren't going to be able to reconstitute their nuclear program so quickly so here's how the Obama fanboys in The New York Times reported this odd development quote while Ron said it would keep it enrichment within limits set by the 2015 nuclear accord the center's opening seems to signal that it could swing to industrial level enrichment if that agreement which the United States withdrew from last month should further unravel under the 2015 nuclear deal Iran stopped enriching uranium to the 20% limit they would allow for rapid development of a nuclear weapon and agreed to a limit of under five percent it will adhere to that limit Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini said in a speech on Monday yes surely the mullahs who have been lying for literally decades about this stuff would not have lied to the Obama administration I do love how the New York Times tries to twist this into well it's really Trump's fault I've Trump hadn't pulled out of the Iran deal they wouldn't fired up the centrifuge facilities again the real question is why is it that in a month they were able to redevelop their centrifuges I thought these had been dismantled I was assured that the Iranians would not simply snap back to a nuclear program the minute the seal was over by President Obama I remember him saying it and yet it seems like that's exactly what happened that's not the extent of the lies there more lies than that first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at Barroso you're sitting on a couch right now listening to my podcast right well look at that couch like look at it it's got the stains it's

extent of the Obama administration's lies on Iran are pretty extraordinary of course their biggest lie about the Iran deal is that the Iran deal was pursued because there was an opening in the oceans you remember that ben rhoades remember that guy who is basically sitting there in stunned silence during the Trump election and it was hilarious and wonderful remember that guy well that guy spent most of the Obama administration publicly lying about Iran saying that Iran had now moderated there was new Iranian regime in place that was eager to reach out to the American people and make a deal with the world that was all a lie he went around bragging to The New Yorker magazine that there he'd created an echo chamber strategy to anybody who would listen right that he had used people like Jeffrey Goldberg the new editor over at the Atlantic who I believe is is it wasn't pawn and Lackey for the Obama administration Rhodes basically suggested the same thing Rhodes said that we were lying to everybody about what was going on with you around zeal they went ahead and did it anyway and this is why so many people on the right are so fed up with the media suddenly getting harsh with President Trump now listen I wish the media were just as hard on President Obama as they've been on President Trump I think the solution to the media's disproportionate focus on Trump is to increase its coverage of Democrats not to decrease its coverage of Republicans there's this feeling on the right that turnabout is fair play if the media was going to ignore all the bad stuff that Obama did why shouldn't we ignore all the bad stuff that the Trump does my feeling is how about we hold all of our politicians to the same accounts and when they do bad stuff let's call them on it but is there a media double standard absolutely abso-freaking-lutely there is a media double standard when it comes to the Obama administration versus the Trump administration and this latest spate of stories regarding Iran is the most obvious example of this I mean it is just stunning it truly is stunning remember Obama was lying to the American people over and over again the word lied was never used with President Obama with regard to anything go back and look the media never said that Obama lied about things they said that maybe he made a mistake or maybe he exaggerated I mean even this ap report with his really really damning ap report at the very beginning of the report they try to soft-pedal the nature of the report itself it's really quite astonishing at the very beginning of the report here is what the AP actually says so the report begins with these words the Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access albeit briefly to the US financial system by sidestepping sanctions set in place after the 2015 nuclear deal I love those two words albeit briefly just wonderful I'll be it briefly can you imagine saying about Trump Trump fibbed albeit briefly they would never use that kind of language with regard to president Trump because this is how the media treat Democrats versus how they treat Republicans Obama gets to run around saying he had a clean administration when he absolutely did not now speaking of this sort of stupidity last night Stephen Colbert had on Bill Clinton now as you'll recall Bill Clinton is the worst so Bill Clinton is not only a human being who has sexually harassed half of the women in the United States he's just as bad about women as any allegations about Trump ever have been Bill Clinton in MIT and some of the allegations are worsening their allegations rape a credible allegation of rape against him by one Anita Broderick Bill Clinton went on NBC's Today Show and then he got mad at the interviewer yesterday we pointed this out he got very upset with the interviewer instead of waving his bony finger at the guy and saying how dare you ask me these questions I apologize to the entire American people well now Stephen Colbert is asking Bill Clinton about all of this but Stephen Colbert remember a guy who said that President Trump had been used by Vladimir Putin as his bleep holster as his genital holster you remember he said this on national TV I guess that Stephen Colbert's idea of a strong interview is to act as precisely that for Bill Clinton to perform the job no one but Monica Lewinsky would perform on Bill Clinton apparently that's what Stephen Colbert was doing look how he opens this interview now later in the interview Colbert says you know you're the most prominent man in my lifetime to sexually harass the help but listen to how he opens this interview with Bill Clinton I noticed she didn't enjoy that entire interview I want you to enjoy this one but I do want to ask you something which is when I got home last night on the CNN they had a lower third banner that said something about William Clinton's tone-deaf response to the question from the Today Show my question is would you like a do-over on that answer do you understand why some people thought that was a tone-deaf response to his questions about the me2 movement and how you might reflect on your behavior twenty years ago okay why don't you stick your hand up his ass and using his face as a meat puppet I mean as long as you're going to just feed him the answer you may as well just be a full ventriloquist like Stephen Colbert could have done an interview with Stephen Colbert dressed as Bill Clinton with that question I mean that's as bad as any leading question that was asked by anybody during the election cycle on Fox News to Donald Trump okay that leading question is astonishing the last part of that question do you understand why some people thought that was a tone-deaf response to his question on the meeting movement here's the part where he feeds in the answer I love it and how might you reflect on your behavior 20 years ago and how that reflection may change based on what you've learned from the me2 movement why don't you just give him the answer why bother answer asking the question would you like a do-over imagine that Donald Trump weren't coming on the show right now and Stephen Colbert and Donald's from just an interview about the sexual harassment allegations and gotten really grumpy about it and Stephen Colbert you think Colbert would lead off with you know mr. president would you like a do-over would you like to reflect on how the media movement has changed your perspective on these things over the years or do you think the Colbert one said yeah mr. president looks like you weren't too happy with that sexual harassment question maybe because you sexually harassed people don't you think that's what Colbert probably would have said to lead off that interview and then of course here's Bill Clinton's answer because he gets thrown a softball right over the middle of the plate and he it's about a single I mean it barely clears the second baseman's head it wasn't my finest hour but the important thing is that was a very painful thing that happened 20 years ago and I apologized to my family to Monica Lewinsky and her family to the American people I'm in at then a minute now I've had to live with the consequences every day sense and I still believe this meeting movement is long overdue necessary and should be supported okay so now he believes in the meeting movement yeah I love that he comes back and he actually spouts Colbert's direct answer back at Colbert yes great interviewing skills and then you wonder why people on the right aren't willing to watch Stephen Colbert why people on the right are looking at people like Colbert and saying this is endemic to the media you wonder why we don't take the media seriously President Trump when he says fake me as I've said this a thousand times I'll say it again when President Trump says fake news and people resonates that it's not because they are just blindly following President Trump they're doing that because they didn't like the media in the first place they figured the media was lying to them because the media does lie to them the media plays defense for Democrats on a regular basis all the time and then we are supposed to believe them when suddenly they turn on one politician in particular at the very least we're gonna say it's disproportionate as I said yesterday the same media who are complaining about coverage of Hillary Clinton's health issues was spending in the last week suggesting that maybe Melania Trump had been abducted and anally probed by aliens or something these are the same people it really is it really is quite amazing okay so in just a second I want to get to more fallout from the dis invitation to the White House by President Trump of the Philadelphia Eagles and President Trump holding a rather hilarious event a patriotic event on the lawn at the White House to compensate we'll get into all of it first I want to say thanks to our sponsor is over at filter by so I don't want to seem too much but I suspect that you have a lot of bills to pay already and that is why you need to be spending you know the appropriate amount of money on your air filters not too much not too little the appropriate amount and listen I know you don't want to hear about air filters right now I know it's not the sexiest topic but let's be real about this the reason that you're hacking up a lung and I could be your air filters the reason that you're going home you don't feel so good you feel like you're got phlegm and you're throwing all this it could be because you haven't bothered to clean your air filters in the last thirty seven years and there's basically the equivalent of a human body's worth of ash in your air filter so maybe you might want to check that out and then head over to my friends over at filter by according to the Department of Energy the most expensive utility for most Americans is their electricity bill and you can drop that electricity bill by getting air filters that actually work America's leading provider of HVAC filters for homes and small businesses available over at filter by they carry over 600 sizes if you are one of those difficult people who have to deal with this stuff they can make custom filters just for you plus they ship free within 24 hours and if that isn't enough they're manufactured here in the United States there's no excuse not to do it set up auto delivery never have to think about it again when you save five set five percent additionally you extend the life of your system you don't want to bust your HVAC because then you're really screwed so go check it out set up water delivery it makes life easier as you save five percent as well save time save money and breathe better with filter by com filter Bui comm filter by comm and let them know that I sent you filter by comm get five percent off of your auto delivery when you set that up as well filter by comm check it out already so president Trump in in the most bizarre and strangely hilarious and yet disputing controversy of the week this would be President Trump's decision to disinvite the Philadelphia Eagles so the White House has an alternative story as to why President Trump disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles so the go story is that the Eagles weren't gonna show up with enough players Trump got me out and he cancelled it the White House story is that the Eagles were basically jackin them around that it was a setup ya be hearing this from a lot of conservatives I just want to say this okay if you think that President Trump is constantly being set up by people there's a way for him to avoid the setup and that is to just not fall for it yeah I'm getting kind of tired of the constant excuse making you know Trump makes a mistake and then it's well he was set up to make that mistake okay guess what every test you ever had in school was set up to do it was set up to test you yes it's true President Obama's political opponents president Trump's political opponents rather test him on a regular basis the question is how well you handle those tests so I'm not saying the Philadelphia Eagles are Pro Trump they're not believe the owner Jeffrey Loria is a wildly left guy but President Trump could have handled this better no question but here's Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggesting that the Eagles were planning a political stunt now I will explain in a second what exactly the White House should have done about it look if this wasn't a political stunt by the Eagles franchise then they wouldn't have planned to attend the event and then backed out at the last minute and if it wasn't a political stunt and they wouldn't have attempted to reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be overseas and if this wasn't a political stunt they wouldn't have waited until Monday well after a thousand of their fans had travelled and taken time out of their schedules to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend the event okay so apparently so the idea here is that they originally said they're gonna bring a hundred people and then they said they were only and bring like ten people and then at the very end it was only like Nick Folk who is the who's the quarterback for the team fine fine so Trump should have hosted Nick focuses on behalf of the on behalf of your team and the media would made fun of it and then he should have said listen I understand if people don't want to visit the White House that's their prerogative again there was a member of the Boston Bruins back in 2012 who didn't visit the White House the media ripped him up and down I mean speaking of media biased media ripped that player up and down Tim Thomas was the goalie for the Boston Bruins they said how dare he not visit the White House it just demonstrates what a bad faith guy he is now the entire Eagles team doesn't really want to visit in the media's like fine but how should the White House have handled it what they should have done is they should have said listen the White House is always open to any of these players who want to visit and if they don't want to visit you know that's that's really them missing out because the White House is an amazing place and we would really love to see them here but you know we can have our political differences which they didn't extend to the sporting world right being gracious is not the end of the world and listen again I understand President Trump is a hammer in search of a nail and he's constantly hammering and he's constantly kicking back I get it I get that this tendency I don't think he is well served in this particular case so here is what how Trump responded so President Trump responded by saying you know what we won't have the Eagles will cancel the Eagles but we'll have a patriotic event a deeply patriotic event and which will get the Marine Corps band out here to play god Bless America and and I will talk about how much we respect our flag the problem I have with this of course is that a lot of the Eagles aren't showing up because they don't like Trump personally and don't like his politics not necessarily because of the kneeling for the national anthem controversy at all Trump as I said yesterday lied when he said that Philadelphia Eagles members were kneeling for the anthem not one Philadelphia Eagles member kneeled the entire year for the national anthem but here was president Trump yesterday doing his event saying that he respects the flag the suggestion of course being that his political opponents do not respect the flag I don't like this if you wanna say Colin Kaepernick doesn't respect the flag agree if you want to say that you know the every member of the Eagles who didn't show up doesn't respect the flag I don't think President Trump is the flag I don't think that that this administration is the flag I hated when President Obama did the same thing that he disagreed with him you were disagreeing with America I hate that crap it's just nonsense here was President Trump doing it yesterday with respect to the flag we love our country we respect our flag and we always proudly stand for the national anthem we always will stand it's about a thousand people showed up a lot of these people were White House staffers and White House interns there were some Philadelphia Eagles fans who showed up as well but you know the fact that the Trump felt they need to do this this kind of thumb in the eye listen I understand a lot of people who are Trump supporters like this sort of thing they like to B's fighting the culture war I think it's divisive I think that it's useless I think it's counterproductive and then of course it leads to awkward moments like this so you know if the ideal is to avoid an awkward moment such as Trump's they're just with the quarterback of the Super Bowl winning team then you could avoid a then you shouldn't have awkward moments like this where Trump is standing there and he's got the Marine Corps Choir standing next to him flanking him and singing god Bless America and then it appears he doesn't know the words okay it's like a big deal that he doesn't know the words no maybe we had the same in controversy when he when he visited a football game uh I was college football national championship and he supposedly didn't know the words to the star-spangled banner and all the rest of it isn't a big deal no it's not a big deal it's just I don't like this kind of showmanship this is not what the presidency is for it is not an imperial office it is not a place where you summon people to meet you and they are required to meet you it is not a place where if you don't come to meet the president then he gets to bring out the Marine Corps band and imply you're not a patriot I just I find this sort of stuff distasteful and you should put the shoe on the other foot if you disagree if you think it would been good if Hillary Clinton had like did you like it when President Obama shined the rainbow flag on the White House I thought that was utterly obnoxious I thought the idea that you are using the people's house to push her own personal politics now you're suggesting that all of America endorses your view of same-sex marriage it was gross it was counterproductive and it increased the cultural divides that's why President Trump was elected because of those cultural divides well by the same token even if I agree with President Trump's message about patriotism I don't like the use of patriotism as a club to wield against political enemies particularly when I don't agree with the idea that everyone who refuses to visit the White House is unpatriotic maybe they just don't like President Trump just says Tim Thomas was a patriot maybe he just didn't like President Obama all of these things are quite possible now with that said do I think that it's foolish that all these athletes keep saying they're not going to visit the White House I do think it's foolish I understand that listen they have their prerogative that's fine you know they don't have to I I would like to hear their specific beefs with President Trump as their as their excuse for doing this but now President Trump has basically gotten into a culture where he thinks he can win both sides think they're winning this culture war in the end only the American people lose so president Trump thinks that he's winning when he's fighting the NFL and the NBA because in one sense he is most people agree with him about kneeling for the national anthem most people agree with him about patriotism being a part of our sporting heritage most people agree with all of that stuff and so he thinks he's winning on the other side people on the Left think they're winning because they think whenever they get in a culture war with President Trump what they are doing is winning people over to their side because President Trump is personally unpopular so in just a second I'm going to show you how the NBA and the NFL how all these people are responding to President Trump in an attempt to win more leftist fans I'll explain that in just a second first how say thanks to our sponsors over at Tommy John so Father's Day is coming up we are right upon it and now is the time to get your dad a Father's Day gifts that he will really appreciate I am talking

podcast in the nation so the NFL controversy of course has bled over to the NBA where a bunch of players hate President Trump with a passion and they're looking for an excuse to make a headline about how much they just like President Trump so LeBron James has decided to comment now LeBron has a long history of disliking president Trump he said that President Trump had revivified rage in the country and Hayden the country and all this stuff here is LeBron James saying that if we win the NBA Finals we will not go to the White House and then Steph Curry says the same thing I mean I know no matter who wins this series no one's don't wants to invite anyway so it won't be going said or Cleveland going we have a lot of freedom in our country and guys me and our female have the right to do what they want to do you know in a very respectful manner and I think if they decided I want to go to they have the right so I obviously agree with LeBron James you have the right not to go to the White House choosing not to go to the White House you know that's that's your problem I'd never problem Tim Thomas did it with the Boston Bruins I find this whole controversy very off-putting and silly I think it's a waste of time South Korea said the same thing so for all those people saying well LeBron is never gonna go to the White House anyway he's gonna get swept that's true but South Korea is saying the same thing I don't think I think I agree with Bryan pretty sure the way we handled things last year kind of stayed consistent with that but at the end of the day like I said every team has an opportunity to make a decision for themselves and and speak for themselves and and I think that's powerful okay again I can't really disagree with the idea that people have a prerogative not to go to the White House I think the best way for Trump to have handled this was as president just to say listen now I'm the president we're not gonna do all of this showmanship we're not gonna do all this reality TV stuff I know Trump would probably be not a guy to embrace that particularly that particularly muted line but I still think that that's the way the president's gotta operate the presidency is not a showpiece the presidency is not a place for photo ops the presidency is not a place where you spend all your days meeting celebrities and handing each other jerseys I hate this stuff I've hated it since the Obama administration and I continue to hate it today now meanwhile the President of the United States is preparing for his big meetup in in single or with North Korea and apparently Dennis Rodman is gonna show up no I'm not actually kidding about this apparently he is Kim Jong Un's dear friend and sources tell the New York Post there not only will Dennis Rodman be in Singapore at the time of the meeting but he could take part in the negotiations one source told the Post quote no matter what you might think about his presence one thing's for sure the ratings will be huge a lot of times in situations that involve complex diplomacy countries like to identify ambassadors of goodwill and whether you agree with it or not Dennis Rodman fits the bill so Rodman of course has visited North Korea some five times and he believes that he was responsible for the North Koreans dictator understanding Trump in April he told TMZ that he gave Kim jong-un a copy of Trump's book the art of the deal for the dictators birthday in 2017 he said quote I think Kim didn't realize who Trump was at that time I guess until he started to read the book and started to get to understand him Donald Trump and Kim Jong learn are pretty much the same well that's not good I don't think that's true number one and number two if you have to use Dennis Rodman as your ambassador of goodwill if you're trying not to look like you better come away with something material here's all I better say I'm gonna say about this this North Korean summit you better come away with something real if you go in and you have no plan and all that comes out of it is the second summit at mar-a-lago where kim jeong-hoon comes to the united states first of all I think that if Kim gentleman comes to the United States we got to strangle him he's the worst dictator on planet Earth I think the first opportunity we have to assassinate him in the leadership of his regime we should yeah I'm not an agreement with the Carter Administration policy that we can't kill foreign officials it seems to me that people who are keeping millions of people in a giant gulag slave state probably deserve to die Kim jong-un has killed enough of his own family members to know exactly what I mean so I'm not a big fan of this whole this whole thing unless you actually have a real plan unless you actually have a serious plan I'm not getting the the the idea they have a really serious plan but maybe I'm wrong maybe Kim jong-un actually wants to come to the table but it better be worth it because otherwise it's just gonna be a bunch of photo op co president Trump doesn't like bad photo ops and she's gonna be a bunch of photo ops of Dennis Rodman alongside Donald Trump and Kim jong-un and people mocking that from here til the end of time if they don't come away with anything material here it's legitimately like the equivalent of Ronald Reagan bringing mark the burden fit rich to negotiations with Gorbachev I mean if this is important enough I'm not sure that it ought to be a photo op for Dennis Rodman Rodman added modestly I don't want to take all the credit I don't want to sit there and say I did this I did that's not my intention my intention was to go over and be a sport to ambassador in North Korea so people understand how the people are in North Korea I think that has resonated to this whole point right now in 2017 when Rodman visited North Korea he was asked about the detention of four Americans in North Korea he said he wasn't gonna mention it he said that's not my purpose right now my purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea okay so will something come of this maybe maybe not color me skeptical I've always been skeptical of the idea that we got together with the North Koreans in the first place it seems like a low-level diplomacy issue I've never thought that summits themselves are a diplomatic win I think diplomatic wins are a diplomatic win I don't think the meeting with Hassan rouhani by by John Kerry is a useful thing I don't think that that Donald Trump meeting with kim jong hoon is inherently a useful thing I don't think meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev were inherently useful unless something good came out of those meetings in the first place the difference is that at least you could say the Gorbachev was the leader of a world power with nuclear weapons who was threatening the entire security of the world and so the meeting was a meeting between two superpowers you can't say the same thing about this which obviously grants additional legitimacy to the Kim regime in in North Korea so grant ain't granting the sort of legitimacy I find a little bit off-putting now meanwhile that we are hearing some rumors that perhaps there will be an agenda here perhaps the the Trump administration knows what they are doing I'm willing to withhold judgment because we don't know what they're doing quite yet but apparently and the idea here is they're looking for some sort of timeline on disarmament that's the ideas that there will be a timeline on disarmament general mattis the Secretary of Defense is not going to this John Bolton apparently is going to this and they are also looking forward to the possibility as I say of a second summit the White House wants him to commit to a timetable and I guess that they're looking for the possibility of a second summit at mar-a-lago commit and came to a disarmament timetable is not useful unless there are significant snapback sanctions in place or unless there's an end not or and unless there's tremendous capacity to for us to actually verify what exactly Kim jong-un is doing in the first place okay so now I've been promising it I'll show the most important story of the day okay and the story that the media will largely ignore yesterday The Associated Press reported that Medicare will become insolvent in 2026 okay it is currently 20:18 that means in eight years Medicare will not be able to pay for itself it's not able to pay for itself right now it's already running in the read Social Security is going to follow in 2034 so within 15 years we are going to see Social Security essentially go bankrupt now it's a government program which means a can't go bankrupt it means instead they're gonna have to radically raise taxes or radically reduce benefits Medicare and Social Security along with Medicaid do represent the majority of the federal budget every year so when you hear about uh-oh we're spending so much money it's waste fraud and abuse it's always frightened of you this was Trump's line it was also the line of left during the last administration that you know the way to cut spending was to look at waste fraud and abuse but we can never never restructure our key entitlement programs those are what are driving our debt those are what are driving our deficit Medicare and Social Security as with Medicaid represent a majority of the federal budget every year and they are mandatory spending okay that means you can't change them unless you actively go and change the law even in a government shutdown people get their Social Security checks and Social Security has been running a negative cash flow for years if we were actually to take into account the amount of unfunded liability we have in Medicare and Social Security some estimates say that our national debt is not 20 trillion dollars it is 90 trillion dollars 90 because we are not taxing to the necessity necessary to pay for all of this stuff my grandmother was paying like 50 bucks into Social Security 40 years ago 50 years ago now she's taking out thousands of dollars that's not because they invest it in the stock market that's because they're taxing me thousands of dollars for my grandmother if I want to help out grandma that's my responsibility but it shouldn't be my responsibility to help out your grandma one of the things that Social Security has done is that it has shifted the burden of responsibility from individuals and families to the government there's actually been a net negative it's meant that people feel less a necessity to take care of their parents they figure the government is going to do it and really the government isn't doing it because the government doesn't have its own money supply the government is just taxing my kids in order to pay for their great grandmother and not just their great grandmother somebody else's great grandmother as well the original ratio with regard to Social Security like the number of people who are taking out of secure social security compared to the number of people paying in it was like one person Social Security taxes were paying for 12 to 15 people today it is to your Social Security taxes are paying for two people soon it will be one soon it will be a direct monetary transfer from my kids to old people to old baby by the way are the wealthiest cohort in the United States as you get older you get richer so you are taxing people who are poor to pay for people who are rich it is actually a regressive policy as you get older you have more money you have more assets you have a house you've been earning for 50 years and yet the idea is you're gonna tax people who are not yet born in order to pay for all of this and yet politicians of both parties are unwilling to look this right in the face right the only politician who really talked about entitlement reform over the last several decades has been Speaker of the House Paul Ryan but he's basically been shellacked for it Donald Trump ran promising not to touch entitlements and so he has not Republicans are in control right now if they do nothing about entitlements that is a giant fail on the part of Republicans because we're gonna feel the brunt of this and then it will come down to Democrats saying do you want to raise taxes and Republican Sainz you want to cut benefits the estimate is that if we do not actually raise taxes dramatically then when the social security fund goes insolvent when Medicare goes insolvent you're gonna have to cut benefits by 20% my feelings of that is okay well I guess that's the way it's gonna have to be because I don't see why my kids should be put behind the economic 8-ball so that my parents won't have to won't have to get as much money out of Social Security I just I don't see why that should be I'll pay for my parents that's my responsibility and my parents will pay for themselves that's their responsibility so again there are only a few solutions here we could increase the payroll tax right now from whatever it is eleven point seven percent to something like 14 or 15 percent or we'll have to cut cost of living adjustments or he might have to confiscate cash from people you know people who paid into Social Security but they're more wealthy they just won't get anything out of Social Security or we could raise the retirement age which is really what we ought to do right we ought to raise the retirement age because the reality is that retirement I don't think is actually particularly good for people and retiring at 65 made sense in an era when the average age of death was 63 it doesn't make a lot of sense in the day when the average age of death in the United States is now over 80 for women in just about 80 for men that's 15 years Social Security is supposed to pay for you delaying retirement and moving their terminate job seems like it would make more sense than all this but we're not gonna say we're not gonna focus on any of these problems we're just gonna fight useless stupid culture wars because that's what we do now right that's so that's what we are more involved with but this is what we should be a paying attention to if the government was designed for anything is to solve problems exactly like this and yet because of the gridlock in our system which is usually a good thing in this case a bad thing it means that we're probably gonna do nothing kick the can down the road until that can ends up exploding in our face okay time for some things that I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like I just I had to laugh at this so nature is red in tooth and claw as the saying goes and this is obvious so this family decided that you can see the small kids they decided that they were going to raise a caterpillar into a butterfly so they let the counter but they fed the caterpillar it's like The Hungry Caterpillar I fed the caterpillar and they and they let it spin its cocoon and then it turned into a butterfly and finally they were ready to release it into the wild and then something unexpected happened okay if you can't see it and release the butterfly the butterfly took about three flaps of its wings and the family dog ate the thing boom I tweeted out that this basically was the narrative of the 2016 election that the media fed Hillary Clinton and they bathed Hillary Clinton and they wove a cocoon for Hillary Clinton and they ensured that Hillary Clinton would never be challenged and then just as she began to spread her wings along the lumps the family dog Donald Trump and eight Hillary Clinton and that is basically the story of the 2016 election in one hysterically funny nature video also this demonstrates again everybody has this romantic view of nature nature is trying to kill us okay the the civilization was built to avoid nature just I know you're sitting there shaking your head because you love the nature you don't love the nature enough they're gonna sleep in that tent every night okay the nature is trying to kill you nature's been trying to kill you for years half of human life is about trying to avoid nature trying to murder you so if you want to go out and like vacation with a trick is nature's the bad boyfriend all right that's your thing but let's stop trying to pretend the nature is kind and cuddly and cute and friendly okay that dog is a wolf deep down and that's a like seat the family butterfly that's what's going on right there sounds pretty spectacular okay other things that I like so every McDonald's in the United States is going to have self aura kiosks by 2020 according to CEO Steve Easterbrook 1,000 stores will get the new kiosks every quarter for the next few years there exist in thirty five hundred of the roughly 14,000 domestic outlets so fight for 15 guys it's not like McDonald's will come up with a solution where they replace your stupid job with a with a machine right like jobs that are pretty easy to replace with machines and then you won't have to worry about people spitting in your food it's not like McDonald's we'll just do that McDonald's these machines are going to replace everybody ello in low-level jobs is one of the reasons why there's now talk of how do we retrain people what do we do for people who have low skill sets you know do if menial jobs go away how do we handle all that but if you keep artificially boosting the price of labor particularly entry-level jobs McDonald's is just going to substitute a bunch of machines a four-year job Easterbrook told CNBC that customers who use kiosk tend to browse the menu in order more food he said if you think about only two years ago if you were a customer there were two ways you can get served in McDonald's you walk to the front counter and lined up and took your drink and find a table or you go through the drive-through we're introducing many options they can order through mobile they can come curbside we'll run it out as well as the existing traditional ways you can pay in different ways and customize your food in different ways first of all this is better service and they're not just saving money they're making life better for you can you imagine how awesome that is that now like I order out from restaurants all the time because my wife you may have heard he's a doctor that means she has not cooked dinner in 1,000 years okay so she is cook that I've cooked more dinners than she has feminists in the audience okay so my wife doesn't cook dinner all that often when she does it as a pleasure she's an excellent cook but it has not happened since I was but a wee pup and that's why we order out a lot so it would be great if the kosher restaurants that I went to had the capacity to run the meal out to the curb for me because I have two kids who are screaming in the back and I can't abandon them in the back of the back of the car so good out of McDonald's the service is getting better it's getting cheaper technology is awesome so by all means leftist continue to push her stupid fight for 15 nonsense and watch as McDonald's replaces you with a computer so there's that also I have to enjoy this Howard Schultz in the the former head of Starbucks he just stepped down he says that he the Democrats are moving too far to the left he wants to run for president in 2020 because what better to represent the Democratic Party than a latte sipping liberal from Seattle he says that he he's ripping the Democrats an interview on CNBC he suggested the Democratic Party needs a leader who won't let it fear to fire the left now this is true I agree with Howard Schultz unfortunately not gonna happen unfortunately the Democrats have moved into their own populist mode where they've embraced the left-most perspective on everything which is why Chris Matthews is upset with the elitism in the Democratic Party he thinks that they need more grassroots down-home feel they need more Bernie Sanders endemic party cuz Matt Gavin the money Today Show come on you're all rumpled hey you know I'm here anyone talking about that Haiti wheats sure my boyfriend's in the entire hotel chain tribes super wealthy but he leaves are just the worst of garbage you need we need less elitism in the Democratic Party Gore's back go a true Democrat lowercase D thinks they're no better than anybody else that's what Democrat is and when the party regains that with white black Hispanic people everybody starts to think of themselves as one of them instead of being better than them they'll get back to the party other people and they're not there yet okay and this accusing rises in the background as he makes this populist speech and there's the upshot with the light right behind him so you get them in aerobic profile Chris Matthews when we start to realize that we're the party of the people I hate the part of the people nonsense you know why because every perspective appeals to some people okay maybe the elite perspective on this meaning that you shouldn't run to the Bernie Sanders left maybe that perspective is right and one of the things that I really dislike about the talk will be leads is that we have not actually distinguish between elites and elitism okay if you are elite this means you are good at something right LeBron James is in the elite basketball player what I prefer to watch a non elite basketball player would you prefer to watch me clang 7-footers probably not because being elite at something is actually a good thing if you are elite in the business of economics you know what economics looks like if you are elite in the in the perspective giving business it's because you are entertaining and hopefully knowledgeable and have a perspective to contribute if you are elite in politics presumably you are good at it hey elitism is a different thing elitism is I'm bossing you around now that's the stuff we should all be railing against right left and center is the idea that we had to boss each other around that's stuff I hate that's not what Chris Matthews is saying he's saying that if you think that your perspective is better and that perspective entails for example more freedom not less then maybe you're an elitist maybe you're elite maybe it's got guy here remembers show ho deal okay time for time for a thing that I hate so for the second time in just two weeks there's a black woman screaming at somebody on the subway that has made news so this is a crazy video uploaded to YouTube last week and it shows an encounter between two passengers on the New York City subway system actually you know what this may be the same no this is not the same video it's it's a different video so this is so this woman gets on the subway and the end this unidentified black woman can be seen verbally abusing an Asian passenger according to law and crime calm who she claims stole her kids seat okay this is the same exact setup as a video the reason I'm getting confused there was a setup last week I talked about and which a black woman got on the subway and people didn't stand up for another black woman and this first black woman started ripping into the Jews okay in this particular case this black woman gets angry and starts ripping into the Asians because this unidentified mother starts verbally abusing an Asian passenger who she claims stole her kids see mother proceeded to curse her out push her on the ground and accuse her of not giving up the seat because her daughter is black two children could be seen seated next to the Asian woman so in other words this Asian woman is sitting there with her kids which you are supposed to do when you have kids because they're trying to keep track of your kids and here's what the video sounds like she said well you got me effed up welcome to America F your home put my effing child out of a seat and then she realizes that she is being recorded and then she and then she says what you're recording my bleep in your mouth so she sounds like a charming person says she put she said she put my child out of seat this ain't your country welcome to America the reason that I point this out is not because I think that this is endemic to any particular race in the United States the point is that it's not okay a lot of the talk in the last election cycle is about xenophobia on the part of white people in the United States this idea that white people in the United States in blanket fashion thought this was their America and when Donald Trump said make America great again what he really meant was make America white again the reality is though too many people have a tribal tendency okay it's something we all have to fight it actually is a tendency in us from when we are children there's tribal tendency that says my tribe is more important than your tribe using purported victimization as an excuse to be a nasty human being to other people on the basis of group identity makes you a nasty person it makes you a bad person okay this woman is a bad person suggesting that this is not an Asian woman's America because I'm a member of one group and you're a member of another group is really gross and pretending that it's not racism because it comes from one group as opposed to another group is also really gross bad behavior is not unique to any one group racial or ethnic in the United States it is possible among all groups and we all have to be careful of letting our own perception of victimhood turn into victimization of others we all have to be careful of allowing our tribal identities to overcome our treatment of each other as individuals okay we'll be back here tomorrow with much more i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Sonia
