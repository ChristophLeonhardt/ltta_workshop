I think he would actually use the nuclear weapon so the presidential campaign right now it's like you have a choice between diarrhea or constipation you pick or choose either way it's gonna suck that's how I look at it the whole political campaign right now it's a it's dangerous you got a guy who has expressed his desire for you know why can't we use nukes and that's why I think it's dangerous I had no one wins in a nuclear war yeah it's it's quick to push a button or you know put in codes on a pad and you know Nuka country and everyone's gone but then there's also repercussions for that you have other countries with you know nuclear weapons and nuclear fallout and no one wins you're killing innocent people at that point in time do I agree with Trump's way of doing things not all the time do I think that he'd be the right guy to have with the nuclear code definitely not that's a disaster I think waiting to happen and like I said no one wins that war
