hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter labelled winning his fourth and most probably last term as russia's President Vladimir Putin has six more years to fashion his legacy how his Putin changed Russia how will he continue to change crosstalking russia's presidential election i'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Victor Levesque he is a political analyst as well as a leading expert at the center for actual politics and of course we have Dimitri Babbage he is a political analyst with Sputnik International all right gentleman crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump any time you want and I always appreciate it Dima your takeaway from this election his reelection was obviously expected he got more percentage points than I think a lot of people were predicting yes well just a few slightly more than I predicted just a few facts that I think are important for our viewers to understand first he got 13% more than in 2012 in 2012 Williams got 63 percent of the vote 45 million Russians voted for him this time he got 76 percent of the vote 55 million Russian voters voted for him why did it happen well between these two elections we had the coup in Ukraine Crimea we had Syria we had the nasty Western campaign against Russia from Russia gave Russia gate we had this British scandal now it's crippled it always works absolutely that's what I said the Olympics it'll help Putin I mean I think a tweet from a vote yesterday says it all he said I didn't plan to vote the reason may be I mean for outsiders looking in there's only two figures in this election there was the Vladimir Putin obviously and Ksenia Sobchak okay the socialite she got what 1.6 7 percent of the vote I mean she actually went to Washington to campaign in Washington DC and nobody accused of meddling in you know she wants to imagine an American candidate openly going to to Moscow and meeting Russian officials in the Kremlin and having lunch with them and discussing the presidential election in the United States what would this be used oh she got a lot of criticism here also but not nowhere near what an American candidate would get over there and she was still allowed to take part in the debates she was all that was shown on television she given fair coverage she was given fair coverage and in fact after the election was over she recognized the result she said the country voted for Putin you know when when he when a president gets 76% he feels political capital that's colorful about it by any term that it that is a lens on you what is to say about the opposition because earlier you were talking about the spectrum of political thought in this election go ahead well first of all I think the Communists running a new candidate a strawberry farm mogul businessman who runs a strawberry farm commune with speck didn't yeah criticized yeah he he did much better than the Communists were expected to do even with Putin's turnout he finished with 12 percent and I think that this shows that this was the real protest vote in Russia right as it were and it's a maybe a vote to be even harder on foreign policy but more for social benefits people talking about foreign policy and what was the election results for Crimea was at 93 percent voted for Putin that's right that it was a that is a very significant responsibility is being able to vote in the Russian elections at the same time Russia the Russian citizens living in Ukraine were not allowed to vote well yes they were blockaded from entering their own embassies by Ukrainian there's a real commitment to democracy no go ahead well I think it's very interesting you know the Western reaction it's very important the context for the West the fact that Russians in Crimea voted for the president is unacceptable it's it's a breach of international war they created the fact that Russian citizens in Ukraine could not vote because the Ukrainian police seemed off the the Russian embassies and why did the Ukrainian police do it they said they were afraid of a repetition of what happened in the deaths in 2000 2015 when several thousand people were burned along with food which was never fully investigated and no one was ever held because they put the people that were the victims by the judge are in jail again when contacted charges okay let's say with the election you mark what what did Americans they always say they vote for bread-and-butter issues with their worth their pocketbook here a Russians any different somewhat but I think there's an element of that too and I think that Putin would not have had as high a turnout as he did if the economy hadn't turned in the last year a little over a year ago he reached the deal with the Saudis to end the oil price war and that helped raise the macroeconomy starting about eight months ago and only in the last three or four months did we see that start to trickle into the real economy and we saw some growth and and it's a movement on salaries in Russia and if that hadn't happened I don't think Putin would have gotten quite as dramatic a show of support as he did do you mean how much you know how much is foreign policy playing into the minds of the electorate here because I mean Russia is in the news in a big way I mean they're told about it one of the things that's really quite remarkable is it Russian federal stations they take verbatim the Lindsey Graham's and the John McCain and everybody else it has something to say and they just let the run of the Russian viewer sorbets themselves would be right and it's not just Lindsey Graham or John McCain when you have the British prime minister accusing Russia of taking the UK or its own soil of a waging chemical attack or something you know of course people react because these are some of the most powerful people in the world telling you that you are waging a war with no air with no evidence you know when they're when the America you know the most powerful Americans say that they're sure Russia meddled in their elections when they say Russia will pay a price when the British Parliament openly discusses a cyber attack against Russia of course foreign policy plays a role here but one thing you know I think it was an interesting campaign because economic issues played a role but not in the way the West would like them to a lot of people consider the policy of the Russian Cabinet of Ministers as too liberal to them - pro-western - monetarist and these people voted for Gruden one of coordinates negative slogans was that if my if mike farm you know he is a CEO over successful family in Moscow if my farm had been rung by accountants we would be bankrupt in two or three days a lot of Russians agree with that because they consider a lot of policies of the central bank of the Finance Ministry you know when they say keep the Russian economy open well I mean when you have hostile States such as I'm sorry I'm quoting miss may you know when she called Russia hostile state then I think we have the right to call a lot of the Western international organizations and become very hostile and you give yourself open to them that's a risky policy Russians understand it two things obviously there's a lot of criticism leveled at the economics section of the cabinet but at the same time it is these people whether one likes them or not it is these people that guaranteed Russia's economy going through in a stable fashion through a period when massive massive sectoral sections sanctions were introduced against Russia by the United States by that by the EU by by other nations so the Russian central bank and the Russian economy ministry and other ministries that deal with this they proved themselves successful in keeping the Russian economy stable in this tough period but another thing also the Western leaders like to say including Boris Johnson recently that they have nothing against Russian people they are only against the Russian government against Putin who knows all these great things 55 but what does this vote what are the results of yesterday's vote say that the Russian people overwhelmingly support Putin's policies so being against Putin is against being is being against Russian people Bucheon equals Russia today they must be sad for they must be so disappointed with the people there's much gnashing of teeth and wailing and the pulling out of the hair in the Western circles I'd like to point out that however I agree with Viktor about the national reserve was that was built up that held whether the sanctions and the oil price out drilling into debt we're not going to do that but I will note that those same neo liberals who built up didn't want to spend it even to save the country during the financial that's right the country for wrong reasons against Iran will probably if you look at the 2008 financial crisis Russia whether that pretty well in the same way to say these same people make sure that Russia kept a stable economy during that period and did it again this time so the track record there is pretty good that's why they're still in their places because nothing is 6 nothing succeeds like success yes despite all the criticism yes 30 seconds mark before we're going to break there was a big ideological option of choices honest read the book to communists to nationalists to liberals a neoliberal and Putin and there was absolute ideological on display and the people still chose Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Putin is not seen as being very ideological and I think that's one of the attractions he has with the with the voters alright gentlemen we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on Russia's presidential election stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lorre belt remind you discussing Russia's presidential election okay liked it broaden this out a little bit I said in my introduction that Vladimir Putin with his re-election this will be hit the fourth time it'll be a in office it's time for him to start thinking about his legacy and and I think all of us here on the table think I think that he has a lot to reflect upon Viktor I mean what what is he thinking because I remember before they changed the terms from four years to six years he was saying what he wanted Russia to accomplish by 2020 you heard that all of the time over a wide variety of sectors and what does he want to accomplish in this last term in office so whatever the main points in the next six years what can we expect from Putin first of all making Russia more influential world stage making Russia one of the prime world powers in the new multipolar world making Russian science and technology on the same level as American science and technology let's progress in America and in Europe and Europe making Russia one of the prime scientific and technological powers a new program of rearmament of the Russian armed forces new opportunities in education in employment for the Russian people in new venues developing bio technologies developing great robotics artificial intelligence and other all making Russia a competitive country and also what a huge challenge is also one more very important thing you talked about it will making the party structure more more progressive more diverse more stable and and also choosing somebody who are candidate who could continue on his course after he leaves six years from now those are the main points of his program and that's what the Russian people expect extra time at I certainly am glad Viktor brought it up here I mean when the parties are not very strong I mean in many ways in my mind there's really it's still just one party and it's the Communist Party and it's shrinking and it's shrinking okay through time there's a point you'll follow there is a communist yeah yeah but okay but if you look at like United Russia it is very diverse okay I mean I mean it actually has a very critical spectrum with a reason for that actually why why you know 25 years have passed more than 25 years since the Soviet Union collapsed in Russia became a multiple multi-party system multi-party state what why has that problem still persisted because Russia's information sphere political sphere has been tainted by foreign influence as soon as opposition parties emerge foreign actors come in and start to meddle because they see the opposition yes with their money with their presence and so forth and as soon as opposition real opposition parties emerge foreign actors such as the United States and its practice energy oh yes the commune and they try to use those parties against against the Russian state okay that is the problem what can what can who to do in this excuse to address that is I think why we see what you know in the West they they simply can't believe a 76 77 percent return it's because the Russian public understands that the country has been under attack all right all these years and that's why there's this widespread national consensus if Putin leaves the country successfully I think he'll have moved it to a at the end of this next six years he'll have moved it to a place where that type of consensus is no longer necessary yes we're right we could potentially either you know as he leaves or within you know a few years afterwards somewhere in the next decade I would like to see United Russia which is it as a party of power it doesn't have a political ideology of its own other than supporting the state you know and the country I would like to see it split I would like to see a real Conservative Party that is because that is that's conspicuously missing in the pudding or do the Russian majority is moderately social conservative by modern Western standards and moderately leftish without being left this they believe in a strong state with strong social benefits that can manage a country you know the the enormous size of Russia and I would like to see a party firmly on those principles emerge well 18 years yeah to do it I hope he can do it in the next six I think there is a big unknown here and that is how will the West change and how will the Western attitudes to Russia change we're in the midst of a crisis in relations between Russia and the West we don't know how it in the West has its own internal crisis go yes so I think I think what will depend on on the developments inside the West I mean what we have seen in the last two years Rodney Atkinson a British political corner said it on Sputnik yesterday when we discussed this election he said that look at the elections in Italy 60% of the people voted for the parties that were friendly to Russia you know that were non-systemic in Germany non-systemic parties are gaining ground very few people are happy with Merkel in France if the election the presidential election had been fair there were at least two candidates who were very Pro Russia and they were so it's really interesting partial explanation why the establishment in the establishment parties use Russia as a foil okay just finishing it I think a lot will depend on this edit your column will the crisis continue I think it will continue for two or three more years if it continues for all the six years then it will be very difficult for Putin to find a successor because I mean look at the candidates now I look at guru Dean Ian I might have sympathy for him will he be able to weather another crisis like the one where Haven with Britain like was the one we had with Crimea Putin has the experience of surviving in crisis none of the other candidates no one's been tested out when you say that these french candidates are pro Russian they are not pro Russian their pro French friendly simply not ready simply so simply understand that having these sanctions against Russia these economic sanctions there's nothing good for French business there's nothing good for French politics does nothing good for the French security what they understand is that this is forced on them by the American foreign policy the you foreign policy it is connected to the American one this these sanctions do nothing good for the EU either yes the only reason that they apparently the bureaucrats support this is because they are pressured by the Americans because they report to Washington okay with with Putin's re-election well we see the UK in the United States and their allies doubling down on this failed Russia policy lutely it's it's not going anywhere and I agree well it's it's going somewhere but off a cliff I agree with Viktor that Putin would like ideally his vision for this term is science technology education that would be a luxury let us remind why Putin came back in 2012 in the first place the primary thing that influenced his decision was Libya and since Libya he has seen the the crisis in Ukraine with the West openly backing this push that overthrew the government and the developments in Syria and in Ukraine a Putin is remembered and justly by the country he was rewarded for bringing Crimea back into the fold but he should as well be remembered as the president who lost the rest of Ukraine to a Western back Bush and that is still a war that's still being fought in the east of Ukraine I think that Putin is will not have the time to think about legacy at this moment because the next few years are going to be spent weathering and surviving crises in Ukraine's interior and an interesting lift that may be his legacy is the struggle the heavy well I think with Ukraine it not just Putin who lost it the process was very long it started back in 1991 Russia continuously didn't meddle in the Ukrainian affairs the liberal dogma about it was only business nothing personal not in fraternal just gas pay get payment for the gas that's why turn a million you know the former Prime Minister and you know the guest person of Russia was appointed them because the exercise of Russian or exercise of Russian soft power the results are dredging let's put it like that but I think a lot when we talk about Putin's legacy a lot will depend on the developments in Ukraine Ukraine is entering its own election cycle and and the problem is that poroshenko is getting huge power thanks to the new law on national security he will be catered police the army the security service on the other hand he is very unpopular so he's popular with Washington having many more problems coming up this could be a rough day almost every single day in that years the search increase already being labeled a traitor who wanted to blow up the Ukrainian Parliament killing the president government remind us who you're talking about the suction was Houston then tried for killing Russians in in don't badger Thomas yes Russian journalists who were supposed to be protected the press is not supposed to be fired on but she fired on them on purpose proclaimed the hero by Ukrainian authorities declared here here they said she was a nationalist here they wanted here back in Ukraine she was exchanged by Russia and then she became a deputy to became a member of the pain she was and now she's going to use the west now she's my because she's come out and publicly said that she saw snipers enter with the neo-nazi Speaker of the Parliament and raper Ruby that fire should skin imagine gentlemen we're talking about it because it's important people are talking about it in Ukraine because it's important is anybody it's see and anyone talking about it is that Ukraine's fate depends much on what the West decides to do with it and what what the West is going to look like in the next 60 s what can she change there it's obvious but the West has been talking a lot about sub sank a while she was in the Russian jail we had we had the you we had the the Ukrainian Parliament every day they had this poster and that year's option is fasting the 11th 12th 13th day okay now I think in the Russian Duma they are going to have the post and ideas option case last 10 seconds nature because first of all is that Putin has political capital to to get his foreign policy and domestic policy objectives realized within the next six years and okay well I'll hold it to you I'll talk about this in six years time that's all the time we have gentlemen many thanks and I guess here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules now for the extended version of our program when we talk about political potpourri make sure let me go to you first it's kind of map out the landscape here what's going on Russian who betrayed his country and worked for British intelligence who had been in presentin stin prison he was let out of the country are pardoned seemingly in retirement and now this happens go ahead of course Russia had absolutely no interest in doing anything to mr. scrip oh it does not benefit in any way but what is the danger of the situation what do we see the anti-russian rusev phobic tenor of the Western press of the British press American press European press is is such that almost any accusation can be leveled against Russia today almost anything you could call the Russian government gang of assassins who go around and the poison people with absolutely no evidence whatsoever and the Western public whether it's the British public whereas the American public is going to most it not all not everyone but mostly believe it so what is the danger of that atmosphere that has been created by the russophobic Western press in the last few years the danger is that now the British the American security services can practically create new provocations we do not know you know two days from now a week from now two weeks from now there could be another case like Skype out with a much more world-renowned individual person or there may be and and Russia could be accused anything this is going the saddest thing about that scenario that prognosis there is that in the old days I remember the media would be questioning what people are not already have to say but the media actually just fan these what I think are this conspiracy theories well unfortunately there is a fertile ground for that because who were the Russians who came to London like mr. screep mysteriously before them they were the most dangerous thugs in Russia okay they wore fancy suits but usually the most dangerous thugs are the ones in fact all of them you know they have their pockets stuff which means they get up at the airport there it is who was very song skier who was madame acoustic also came to london before going to israel they were the richest in he was arrested in space then she had to go to London from London he went to Israel so basically they were the richest people in the Russia of the 90s the criminals are flunky absolutely remember what the Western press wrote about the Russia of the night sometimes even exaggerating and now you have them all in London all of them have in very strange relations with each other so it's no wonder that the NATO of Berezovsky died the strange death recently the British press immediately peels it on Russia well Russia told these people extradite these bandits back to Russia they are dangerous for you the British dismissed it no there are nice people you are just mistreating them okay you know the most dangerous Russian criminals the little Japanese even cough he came to the United States as a Russian dissident in in the wait ages don't forget about that and then he was imprisoned for for mafia activity there's nothing with the poisoning thinking it has to have it has to play a sinister role because if it's not sinister then you can't spin it the way they want it spun okay you know if a former traitor to his country suddenly dies in his bed no one's good it's not sinister enough to get this kind of media whirlwind created and that's exactly what's happening this last week in The Guardian there was a cartoon of Putin as a crudely drawn spider coming out of Russia over the world which is a direct copy of a 1930s era Goebbels poster of the Soviet Union emerging as the the very same spider so obviously copied the Guardian copying Goebbels propaganda to slur Russia today I mean which is a repeat of the whole octopus name that's been going for a long while but this week in BBC Newsnight they showed that this scribble poisoning in this hysteria is not just the danger of it is not just international with the geopolitics and the threat of the war but domestic and crushing domestic political dissent Jeremy Corbyn the leftist leader of the Labour Party who was a big threat to the British deeps because he questioned because he questions he's questioned accusing Russia with no evidence and what did they do to him BBC the British state media outlet photoshopped him into in front of a picture of the Kremlin with this sinister red and black black lighting tinting to it and they even Photoshop is his hat to make it what they think looks like a look like a linen hand washing yeah and and this is what it's all about this is demonizing dissent humanizing Corbin to make sure he never takes office just like it's being used as a political witch hunt in the u.s. to prevent Trump from doing any date I mean I'm very pessimistic about this but I mean my sense of and this this issue people are beginning to push back at least on social media there's more of a push back of what's you know people really wanting to know because we're not gonna get it from the mainstream media well I think if you look at the origins of that like palm oil with the tube now may accuse inrush of dangerous chemical agents that no one knows about then nikki Haley saying it could happen in New York City you know again talking about chemistry and samples you know in the old times doctors magic you know none of magic magic is the origin of chemistry yes Russ right and magic to witch-hunt of witch-hunt you know mr. McLaren you know terrorism a Colin Powell they understood that the broad public doesn't know much about dangerous chemical agents the public is terrified you know whenever they hear this thing that can I think it has to be noted that on British TV in the last few months they've been running a spy thriller strike back where Russians used a chemical nerve agent then no one has heard about for decades that no one knows is real nova chuck in some kind of sinister plot now my question is who in the British Secret Service's is watching their TV who is writing the script for movies in Salem in the 17th century had television and series at their disposal I bet a few more witches would be killed right the Western the Western establishment understands that it cannot change power in Russia it cannot bring in a new leadership in Russia a pro-western leadership by by the force of the state because the Russian people the Russian state does not support the West they know that Western establishment is not their friend so they understand they think they believe that the only way for so-called regime change in Russia is to force struggle in the Russian business and political elite in the way they are thinking about creating that that struggle in the elites is bodies by enforcing a more and more aggressive sanctions regime against Russia in these types of attacks such as the one these types of provocations such as the one that happened in Salisbury and unfortunately more that could happen that could this possibly could be as I said the number one in the series they can be used as a pretext for more and more aggressive sanctions that's the danger because when they're talking about is expropriating assets that's what you're getting what they're doing is assuring them to oppose the Russian girl I only exposes their incompetence and their failure to understand Russia what they would do is force many criminal oligarchs Russian elite some of them corrupt who have taken this their filthy lucre to London they're forcing them to repatriate it back to Russia doing the Kremlin's work for our economies and our give you an example let me give you an example the British government says we are going to force these Russian businessmen to explain the origins of their fortunes begin with trader coughs key begin with wanting that for 25 years forest absolutely I will be fascinating to hear from Carter cause I keep all of his money also with poker joke who called Putin a slave owner of all the garbage all of this here okay that's all the time we have gentlemen that's the the finishing point of our extended version of the program we hope you I couldn't remember crushed-up rules you you
