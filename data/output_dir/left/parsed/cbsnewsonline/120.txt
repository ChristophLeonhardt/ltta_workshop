IN A VERY HIGH STRAIGHTIVE 
CAPACITY. 
WE HAVE A FAVORITE OF MINE. 
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, GOOD JOB 
HE HAS DONE. 
AND MONTANA STATE AUDITOR MATT 
ROSE NDA LE. 
YOU ARE DOING GOOD MATT. 
I HEAR BIG THINGS MATT. 
WE ARE ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL TO 
BE JOINED TODAY BY THE TOP 
CEO'S, UNION LEADERS, TRADE 
ASSOCIATIONS AND EDUCATORS FROM 
ALL ROUND THE COUNTRY. 
THESE ARE THE BIGGEST AND BEST 
AND MOST TALENTED. 
AMONG THOSE -- I WILL INTRODUCE 
THEM AS THEY SIGN THEIR PLEDGE. 
WE HAVE A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
THE REALLY FOUNDER AND CREATOR 
AND I HEARD HE DID A REPORT AT 
HIS SCHOOL AND HE GOT LOW MARKS 
BECAUSE THEY SAID IT COULDN'T 
WORK AND HE ENDED UP GETTING 
VERY HIGH MARKS BECAUSE IT'S A 
COMPANY CALLED FEDEX. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
PRETTY CORRECT, RIGHT? 
THAT PROFESSOR DIDN'T KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
FRED SMITH. 
THANK YOU FRED. 
WE WILL HAVE TO GIVE THAT 
PROFESSOR LOW MARKS BECAUSE IT 
WORKED OUT WELL FOR YOU. 
HOME DEPOT CEO. 
CRAIG, CRAIG.
MARYLAND U HOUSTON AND HOW IS 
THE F-35 DOING? 
RIGHT ON TIME? 
RIGHT? 
GOOD JOB. 
TOM KENNEDY. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU TOM. 
KATHY WARDEN.
I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE DAN 
ENGLAND ALONG WITH JOHNNY 
TAYLOR, PRESIDENT OF THE 
SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCES 
MANAGEMENT. 
THEY HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC AND 
REALLY WORKED HARD FOR US. 
EVERYBODY HERE TODAY IS UNITED 
BY THE SAME GOAL, TO TRAIN, 
RECRUIT, HIRE AMERICAN WORKERS, 
THANK YOU TO OUR GREAT ECONOMIC 
SUCCESSES AND WE HAVE HAD A LOT 
OF THEM AND WE HAVE NEVER HAD 
-- I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS A 
COUNTRY WE HAVE NEVER WITHIN 
MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN WE ARE 
EXACTLY RIGHT NOW TODAY. 
THE NUMBERS COMING OUT ARE 
BEYOND WHAT ANYONE THOUGHT 
POSSIBLE.
SO THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER 
TIME TO HIRE AND GROW IN 
AMERICA. 
WE CREATED 3.7 MILLION JOBS 
SINCE THE ELECTION. 
IN THE MONTH OF JUANA LOAN WE 
GREW THE WORK FORCE BY MORE 
THAN 600,000 WORKERS. 
I SAY THAT IF IF I EVER 
MENTIONED THIS -- IF I EVER 
MENTION THIS DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN THEY WOULD HAVE SAID 
THERE'S NO WAY. 
THERE'S NO WAY. 
NO WAY THAT COULD HAPPEN. 
IT'S HAPPENED AND FAR MORE THAN 
WE EVER THOUGHT. 
WE ARE IN THE LONGEST POSITIVE 
JOB GROWTH STREAK IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY. 
AFRICAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
HAS REACHED IT'S LOWEST LEVEL 
IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 
HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT ITS 
LOWEST LEVEL IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY. 
ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED 
IT'S LOWEST LEVEL IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY. 
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT -- THIS IS 
TO BAD. 
THIS IS VERY SAD. 
HAS REACHED IT'S LOWEST LEVEL 
IN ONLY 65 YEARS. 
WITH IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS I THINK 
WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY. 
IT'S MOVING QUICKLY. 
65 YEARS NOT SO BAD.
CONSUMER AND BUSINESS 
CONFIDENCE HAS REACHED IT'S ALL 
TIME HIGHS. 
THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED. 
95% OF MANUFACTURERS ARE 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE. 
THAT'S THE HIGHEST NUMBER EVER 
RECORDED. 
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE 
HAPPENING OUT THERE. 
EVERY DAY WE ARE LIFTING OUR 
FORGOTTEN AMERICANS OFF THE 
SIDELINES, OUT OF THE MARGINS 
AND BACK INTO THE WORK FORCE. 
WE ARE GIVING A SECOND CHANCE 
AT LIFE TO THE 620,000 FORM 
ERIN MATES WHO RE-ENTER SOCIETY 
EACH YEAR. 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GREAT, 
GREAT JOBS MARKET TO TAKE CARE 
OF THAT SITUATION. 
IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENED 
WITH PEOPLE THAT WERE IN PRISON 
THAT PREVIOUSLY TO THIS 
COULDN'T GET THEMSELVES A JOB. 
NOW THEY ARE BEING HIRED AND 
PEOPLE ARE LOVING THEM. 
ITS BEEN INCREDIBLE TO SEE. 
TO KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING, TO 
CONTINUE THIS ECONOMIC MIRACLE 
AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS. 
IT'S A MIRACLE WHAT'S HAPPENED 
IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE 
MUST INVEST IN JOB TRAINING AND 
VOCATIO IN, AL EDUCATION. 
THE FACT IS THAT COMPANIES ARE 
COMING BACK INTO THE COUNTRY. 
COMPANIES THAT LEFT TEN AND20 
YEARS AGO AND THEY ARE COMING 
BACK AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO WORK 
FOR THEM. 
WE NEED TALENTED PEOPLE. 
WE NEED PEOPLE WITH TRAINING. 
THAT'S WHY IN A FEW MOMENTS I 
WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO 
ESTABLISH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL 
FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER. 
THIS COUNCIL WILL BE MADE UP OF 
TOP OFFICIALS ACROSS THE 
GOVERNMENT. 
WE ARE ALSO ESTABLISHING AN 
OUTSIDE ADVISORY BOARD OF 
INDUSTRY LEADERS AND EXPERTS 
WHICH WE WILL ANNOUNCE IN THE 
COMING WEEKS. 
VERY SHORTLY. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO BE ON 
THAT BOARD. 
TOGETHER THEIR TASKER WILL BE 
TO DEVELOP A NATIONAL WORK 
FORCE AND STRATEGY TO EQUIP 
AMERICANS OF ALL AGES AND AT 
ALL STAGES OF THEIR CAREER WITH 
THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO THRIVE 
IN THE MODERN ECONOMY. 
WHETHER IT'S A HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENT LOOKING TO LAND THEIR 
FIRST JOB, FIRST JOB EVER, THEY 
HAVE A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AND 
THEY LOOSE THIS EXCITEMENT WHEN 
THEY DON'T LAND THAT JOB BUT 
NOW THEY ARE ALL LANDING JOBS. 
OR A LATE CAREER WORKER WHO úWA 
WANT EVERY AMERICAN TO HAVE THE 
CHANCE TO EARN A GREAT LIVING 
DOING A GREAT JOB THAT THEY 
LOVE WHERE THEY WAKE UP IN THE 
MORNING AND THEY CAN'T GET TO 
WORK FAST ENOUGH. 
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT 
FEELING. 
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE IN THE 
POSITION THEY ARE IN. 
IN THAT SPIRIT I'M PROUD TO 
ANNOUNCE AN EXCITING NEW 
CHALLENGE AT THE BEGINNING OF A 
NEW NATIONAL MOVEMENT. 
WE ARE ASKING BUSINESSES AND 
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY TO SIGN OUR NEW PLEDGE 
TO AMERICA'S WORKERS. 
TODAY, 23 COMPANIES AND 
ASSOCIATIONS ARE PLEDGING TO 
EXPAND APPRENTICESHIPS. 
THAT'S ON INTERESTING WORD FOR 
ME TO BE SAYING, THE 
APPRENTICE. 
I NEVER PUT THAT TOGETHER UNTIL 
JUST NOW. 
THAT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE. 
I WILL TELL YOU THAT. 
ISN'T THAT STRANGE? 
I NEVER ASSOCIATED BUT HERE WE 
ARE. 
CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THAT WORD. 
FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING 
EDUCATION. 
THEY WILL SIBERIA THE PLEDGE 
COMMITTING TO TRAIN AND RETRAIN 
MORE THAN 3.8 MILLION AMERICAN 
STUDENTS AND WORKERS FOR NEW 
JOBS AND REWARDING CAREERS.  
THIS IS ONLY DAY ONE AND WE FAR 
EXCEEDED OUR INITIAL GOAL OF 
500,000 STUDENTS AND WORKERS. 
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 500,000 
AND IT'S CLOSE TO 4 MILLION AND 
BY THE END OF THE DAY IT'LL 
PROBABLY BE WELL OVER THAT. 
IN THE DAYS AND MOSS AHEAD WE 
HOPE THAT HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES 
AND ORGANIZATIONS WILL JOIN US 
IN THIS EFFORT.
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE 
WONDERFUL COMPANIES AND úASSOCI

>>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO

CONCERNING WORKERS. 
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
MORE NEWS.  
. 
>>> WE WANT TO GO TO ASPEN 
COLORADO WHERE DAN COATES IS 
SPEAKING AT THE ASPEN 
INSTITUTE'S FORUM. 
THIS AMID THE FALL OUT OVER THE 
PRESIDENT OVER COMMENTS ON 
RUSSIA. 
HE STOOD BY UNITED STATES 
INTEL 
CALLED HIM A GREAT PATRIOT. 
>>  YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR.  
ON THAT BASIS WE STARTED -- A 
GOOD  RELATIONSHIP -- I JUST 
FELT AT THIS TIME, POINT IN 
TIME THAT WHAT WE HAD ASSESSED 
AND REASSESSED AND REASSESSED 
AND GONE OVER -- STILL STANDS. 
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT 
STAND ON BEHALF OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.  
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE 
STATEMENTS RELATIVE TO -- IN 
SUPPORT OF THAT WHICH I 
APPRECIATE. 
THE LATEST BEING ON -- I THINK 
ONE OF YOUR RIVAL NETWORKS. 
THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT NAMING 
THEM. 
KEEP NBC IN FRONT HERE. 
IT WAS A PART OF MY ROLE AND I 
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT I DO 
THAT IT HAS BEEN SAID AND 
DISCUSSED WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND -- I THINK THAT IT'S TIME 
TO MOVE ON. 
>>  WELL,  
HE HAS SWITCHED FROM ONE 
POSITION TO THE OTHER EVEN IN 
THE SAME DAY, AS RECENTLY AS 
YESTERDAY. 
WHEN YOU WATCH THAT -- WHAT WAS 
YOUR GUT REACTION WATCHING HIM 
VALIDATE PUTIN'S ASSESSMENT 
OVER YOURS? 
>>  MY THOUGHT WAS THAT I -- I 
BELIEVED THAT I NEED TO CORRECT 
THE RECORD FOR THAT. 
THIS IS THE -- THE JOB I SIGNED 
UP FOR AND THAT WAS MY 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
OBVIOUSLY I WISHED HE HAD MADE 
A DIFFERENT STATEMENT. 
I THINK THAT NOW THAT HAS -- 
BEEN CLARIFIED BASED ON HIS 
LATE REACTIONS TO THIS. 
SO, I DON'T THINK I WANT TO GO 
ANY FURTHER THAN THAT. 
>>  IN THE CABINET ROOM ONE OF 
STATEMENT THAT YOU REFERRED TO. 
HE SAID I ACCEPT OUR 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S 
CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIA'S 
MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION 
TOOK PLACE, COULD BE OTHER 
PEOPLE ALSO. 
COULD BE OTHER PEOPLE ALSO? 
WHAT DOES HE KNOW THAT YOU 
DON'T KNOW? 
>>  WELL -- COULD IS NOT A 
DEFINITIVE WORD. 
COULD SOMEONE ELSE BE LOOKING 
AT HOW TO DO THIS? 
RELATIVE TO OUR ELECTIONS? 
POSSIBLY ROGUE STATES, 
WHATEVER? 
WE KNOW OTHERS HAVE POTENTIAL 
ABILITIES. 
IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT THE 
RUSSIANS ARE TAKING THE LEAD ON 
THIS AND THAT BASICALLY THEY 
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE TRYING TO 
UNDERMINE OUR BASIC VALUES AND 
DIVIDE US WITH OUR ALLIES AND 
WREAK HAVOC OVER THE ELECTION 
PROCESS. 
WE NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO MAKE 
SURE THEY AREN'T ABLE TO DO 
THIS WITH THE ELECTION COMING 
UP. 
LEARN THE LESSONS FROM THE 
PAST. 
PUT IN PLACE THE THINGS THAT WE 
NEED TO PUT IN PLACE IN TERMS 
OF MAKING SURE WE CAN GUARANTEE 
TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHEN 
THEY WALK IN THAT VOTING BOOTH 
AND CAST THEIR VOTE, HOWEVER 
THEY CAST IT IT'S A VALID VOTE. 
IT WON'T BE TAMPERED WITH. 
WHATEVER RESULT COMES THESE 
ELECTION IS SOMETHING THAT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HAVE 
CONFIDENCE IN, THAT IT WAS NOT 
MANIPULATED BY ANYONE. 
WHETHER THAT WAS EXTERNAL ORRIN 
EVEN INTERNAL. 
WE KNOW WHEN PARTIES HAVE TRIED 
TO MANIPULATE THE VOTES ONE WAY 
OR THE OTHER. 
THAT IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE. 
DEMOCRACY IS THE ABILITY TO 
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTED 
OFFICIALS AND WE HAVE TO TAKE 
EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT 
MAKES -- THAT HAPPENS IN THIS 
UPCOMING ELECTION AND FUTURE 
ELECTIONS. 
>>  JUST TO NAIL THIS DOWN THE 
-- THE 2017 INTELLIGENCE. 
IT SAID THAT PUTIN HAD A CLEAR 
PRECEDENCE FOR TRUMP. 
18 MONTHS LATER HAS ANYTHING 
CHANGED THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE 
OR LESS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS 
PUTIN? 
>>  I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO 
WHAT THE INVESTIGATION THAT'S 
GOING ON AND WHAT THEY MAY 
PRODUCE FROM THAT. 
>>  IT TERMS OF THE ASSESSMENT. 
>>
