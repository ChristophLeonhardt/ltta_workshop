ever had on my show because after that awful school shooting in Broward County on Valentine's Day he didn't just go running straight to CNN he didn't his first reaction after that horrible shooting wasn't just to become famous on TV I know that was ever there was everyone's faith at you know that kid the meme kid who went on and he called Marco Rubio terrorists c'mon this guy is like the opposite of that Kenneth Preston is a 19 year old Broward County student who reacted to the shooting by actually investigating what happened Kenneth thank you for being here it's my pleasure Michael so you spent over 100 hours combing through thousands of pages of local government documents you spoke with dozens of school and law enforcement officials past and present parents of victims of that shooting you got to know their families you spoke with members of the media in short you did exactly what the Stoneman Douglas gun-control kids did not do you actually did what every adult journalist in America failed to do the things that you found out in your report by actually doing the work of investigative journalism any of these news sites could have done it you're just the guy who actually did the work instead of shallow media grandstanding my first question what were you thinking actual investigative journalism is not going to get you on CNN buddy why did you investigate what happened listen journalism isn't dead yet Michael so like it's you and Cheryl Atkinson I think I think you're the two lightest journalists and Americus there you go it was it was a whole lot of anger everybody in this county was angry but I was sort of bothered by the fact that I was constantly seeing officials in the county going on lobbying for more money for Broward County I know for me more money were to flow into the county we could have prevented or we can weaken harder and harder in our schools in the future the issue though is that most people don't realize that we we've had a whole lot of school safety money that's been designated to Broward County Schools but it hasn't all been spent properly but that's only that's only part of the report so I want to know the report is very good it's very detailed you source every syllable in it what are the main conclusions what's the 30,000 foot view of your investigation so basically the findings of the investigation were twofold first off there was 104 million dollars designated specifically to school safety in 2014 about five of that has been spent since that passage about the second be a five percent five five million the point something yeah Wow yeah so and then on top of that the the second part of our investigation was on school discipline reform school school discipline matrixes the behavior intervention program and the promise program which is honestly what I think contributed more to this far more to this then than any funding could have I want to talk about that promise program Adam Smith said mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent and we've seen that play out in Broward County you write in the report quote according to the Broward School Services website students convicted of serious crimes such as rape murder attempted murder sexual battery or firearm related activity are given the possibility of entering back into the traditional school system as part of the promise program how did the promise program come about what does it mean for the rest of the country what should we do about it so let's separate them for a second the school discipline reform thing encompasses a lot that part isn't part of the school of the promise program that is part of what's called the behavior intervention program the behavior intervention program essentially works to move incarcerated students from incarceration back into tradish school systems and as you've noted students convicted if some pretty heinous felonies are all for those programs the promise program is a whole nother mess but in particular I focused my time on the school discipline matrix which essentially gives administration complete discretion over whether or not to report incidents to law enforcement why did they do this is insane you know sometimes people say in America they'll say you know we lock up a lot of people we owe X percent of the population is incarcerated and I think oh good that's good because then the criminals are away from me and my family and my friends and that's good and maybe if we could get some more criminals in there that would be even better why did this come about this seems insane well the promise program originally came about because the federal government under Arne Duncan's education plan was to address problems of disproportionate minority arrests so this is under the Obama administration that was the implementation of it they put forward this plan superintendent Runcie followed with a lot of those plans and in a private meeting with him and some other district officials the other day they told me that they've accepted most of these as part of federal not even guidelines but suggestions but ultimately it was their job to implement those so they the counties what what is the force behind this though I wonder why was this a priority of Arne Duncan what is Arne Duncan have to do with Broward County why do they want to take dangerous people murderers and rapists and put them back into a traditional school community maybe I'm a little thick maybe I'm a little slow here but that sounds like a bad idea on the face of it I'd imagine so as far as the policy it was it was nationwide these these guidelines some counties decided to adopt them or my County was one of them but as far as Arne Duncan and the superintendent they actually know each other pretty well Arne Duncan got the superintendent his job at the Chicago Public Schools so as far as those guidelines being implemented I'm sure they shared some of the same views but ultimately what the purpose of things like a behavior intervention program or I I wish I could tell you Michael that's million-dollar question because a lot of times they try to push these programs as compassionate they'll say oh we have too many racial minorities going to prison and that's there's a school to Prison Pipeline or something like that and you say okay well that's not good those people should stop committing crimes and that would be better nobody wants to see one demographic going to jail at a higher rate than some other demographic but oh is they the solution they propose is just not to punish them but that isn't fair at all that's that isn't justice that's injustice you're treating some people differently for committing a crime than other people because of factors that really shouldn't have very much to do with it like the color of your skin or the neighborhood you come from or something like that yeah well what they throw around a lot is this right to education but they often don't consider the the right to safety and the right to life for those other students that have to be surrounded by these potentially violent students that that oftentimes you wouldn't be aware or in your classrooms right and you know they'll say if they try to make it a racial thing because the left always wants to make this into a racial thing so they'll say to too many black people are going to jail the crime rates are too high and you say oh okay well I don't see how your solution of putting those criminals back into the traditional school system how is that fair to the black students who don't commit crimes your imperiling their safety that isn't that isn't good for anybody that isn't good for the school you quote a veteran deputy of the Broward Sheriff's Office as saying quote I'm sorry to say but we all knew some sort of tragedy like this was going to happen in Broward you can't just stop arresting kids and send kids straight from juvie back into schools without expecting something like this as officers our hands were tied the decisions were political ones not well researched or backed by evidence just follow the money if they really wanted to know what worked they would have asked us the officers why aren't more law enforcement officials speaking up and speaking up publicly well they're employed by the county is it the same county that failed them and failed our students and teachers that day so you know the only reason he spoke to me is is because you know now he's retired after after decades on the forest so but many of these people are not willing to come forward with their vote with their voices because they're they're afraid of you know the backlash that they made was professional backlash right yeah without question so you spoke it correct me if I'm wrong you spoke at the school board meeting last night I tried you yeah well I'm in there this was what you were going to present your findings a hundred hours of research you've combed through all the documents that journalists didn't come through you're going to present it to the school board and then what happened well three weeks in advance we had a set speakers list of seven speakers which included survivors some families of victims some were affected and and just you know community members that want to to have their voices heard and I had about six minutes of time a different from the usual three because I had some time rail of course so basically the gist of what happened is an hour before this meeting I had received a call where they said all seven speakers were cut and my time would be cut in half so I get there and I had an entire six minute speech prepared I had to basically throw that speech out and just come to the board and say you know for the last week you guys have been doing everything in your power to subvert our message and you know so we pushed that that message out to national media outlets and I'm sure runs he's sweating a little bit now that's run c1c is the superintendent in Broward County and he doesn't come out looking very nice in your report you see this a lot in local government where they'll say oh no one's gonna pay attention we can cut this guy's time we can shut them up who's gonna find out what are you gonna do national news cycles are gonna move on and then we can keep being just as corrupt as we ever were how corrupt is the Broward County School Board and how corrupt is superintendent Runcie you know it's funny in 2011 this was just before the superintendent got here a grand jury commissioned by the former governor looking into the Broward County School Board said that if if it weren't for a constitutional mandate they would recommend that the school board be abolished entirely the of how deep-seated the corruption where there were a couple school board members that were arrested the superintendent had to step down and obviously the superintendent Runcie came and he was in fact supposed to clean up the mess and bring about transparency to the district so there's some deeply ingrained corruption without question unbelievable so IIIi want you to continue on that because I want to hear more explicitly about this guy's corruption and I have one more question for you but before we do that we got to keep the lights on we have to keep the lights on we get to keep the lights on now you know Kenneth you're a young man you've got a thick pompadour over there a good head of hair but you know as you get older perhaps you'll want to keep that head of hair because look for me for most of my life I'll tell you this I

County School Board tell me more about the superintendent himself sure the superintendent is an interesting guy he's very well-spoken it'll run circles around you but he claims to be competitive committed to transparency the only issue is that I'm not sure if you're aware the day before this meeting I was called into it a last minute meeting with the superintendent where I was supposed to talk about my rapport I was told I wasn't allowed I wasn't allowed to record the meeting because it was supposed to be just between myself a couple parents in the superintendent once I got there it was stacked ten district officials all work for him himself and they took two hours to speak with me about my report to try and sort of pick it apart and tell me what was wrong with it so the the issue with this whole process and him in particular is I just can't imagine that a superintendent who is in charge of 300 plus schools 15,000 students and 270,000 or $15 and teacher than 270,000 students has the time to be to eight an 18 year old about a report that he doesn't believe there's any substance to so-so run see Ron's he's sweating a little bit that's a great point that is a great point he is clearly you don't do that you don't line up your officials and take the time unless you think this is a big deal and what they're always going to tell you is oh it's nothing it's lies it's nothing this is it keep the pressure on a man you were doing excellent excellent work is really really admirable great to have you here Kenneth Preston you can read about the report it's so one published in the hill and some other national media are covering it to keep the pressure on them that goes for every conservative out there people who want to help education reform and also to Kenneth Kenneth thank you for being here thank you all right now look Kenneth was great it was nice to have him here I really I enjoy that and everything but now we get the panel of deplorable this is really good it has been so long we it has been so long I have not seen roaming in a long time seen Liz wheel or I there a lot of others we want to bring on may will bring him back every so often Liz wheeler is the host of tipping point on one America news roaming millennial hosts roaming millennial uncensored on CR TV hubba-hubba and john hirsh our is some guy no John has written all over the place he's written at National Review and daily wire New York Times Fox News nation and the Fairfield mirror he was also the national undergraduate winner of the buckley program ideas essay contest that's how I know him ladies and john thank you for being here let's dive right in Paul Ryan is retiring from Congress here is speaker Ryan this has been one of the two greatest honors of my life the job provides incredible opportunities but it the truth is it's easy for it to take over everything in your life and you can't just let that happen because there are other things in life that can be fleeting as well namely your time as a husband and a dad which is the other great honor of my life that's why today I am announcing that this year will be my last one as a member of the house Paul Ryan has been in Congress since the age of 28 he's been in Congress for 68 percent of all of our lives and he's probably been in Congress for more for the pretty young things like John out there you know the 20 to 23 year olds first of all roaming are you broadcasting from hell what is going on behind you oh yeah this is the fireplace that we actually built for the set and I say we because I you know of course manage and supervise that's excellent all right Liz we'll come back to you in a second drumming Liz is Paul Ryan jumping off of the Titanic is that what this is about or is this about the midterms or does he just want to see his kids more what's the real story here why is Ryan quitting Congress listen I am never gonna castigate someone who says that they're quitting their time-sucking job because I want to spend more time with our family actually think we should commend that more politicians probably should be better examples like Paul Ryan of being a good husband and a good father so I'm never going to criticize him in the personal sense but didn't we learn our lesson a couple weeks ago between the difference of criticizing the person when it came to the students from parkland the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school kids criticizing the person and criticizing the policies and that's where I would separate my criticism of Paul Ryan he seems like a good man good husband good father his kids are gonna be lucky to have him around more but I don't think that he's the quite the right fit for the job of Speaker of the House I mean he doesn't seem to have that so-called fire in his belly to actually fight for conservative principles like he did maybe when he was first in office we've heard in the last two years more often and more vehemently criticized the president that we've heard him stand up for actual conservative values cutting wasteful spending scaling back the size and scope of government and enabling people to be successful for themselves and get government out of the way I hate to interrupt if the sound is still going on now I am getting in my ear a 75 minute delay from when your lovely selves are talking and when I can actually hear what you're saying so I think this is probably Bashar Assad if I had to blame this on anybody and I think I'm willing to blame it on Bashar Assad this is an attack on the show very devastating because I want to talk to you all but I guess it's just gonna have to be another time I'm gonna have to go through it myself that you know absence makes the heart grow fonder I guess this will be a sanctifying experience as I have to say goodbye to all of you Liz I'm gonna see you on your show later today so at least get to talk to you roaming I miss you terribly John you know good to see you buddy and well we'll have to bring you on when we have a better news cycle and also a better control room and we're out of the broom closet of the ben shapiro show I'm gonna do the news myself see you guys absolutely devastating I am so sorry to see my dear friends go do I have to sign off of Facebook now too so sad all right I'm gonna cover all the news on the back end of Facebook that's fine listen you know I invite people

pay $10 a month or $100 for an annual membership you get me the under Clavin show the Ben Shapiro show that's fine you need this really what you need today is a Michael Noel's tears tumbler because of has sat to say goodbye to my panel of deplorable x' with the tech issues but the leftist here's tumblr is very important to in particular because of some of the news that we're going to be talking about because I suspect that roaming millennial is right I suspect this is just another false alarm and Trump's demise ain't going to happen they didn't get them in 2015 2016 2017 they're gonna get them in 2018 and you're gonna need this to protect your family go to daily wire comm we'll be right back all right we'll hit all three of these news stories before we have to go here because they are really important this one of the biggest news days I can remember in a while Paul Ryan is out Paul Ryan has been in Congress since the age of 28 this should throw up red flags for anybody it isn't good for someone to be in Congress that long he's been in Congress for 68 percent of my life and that said unlike a lot of other conservatives I'm gonna defend him I like Paul Ryan I think he's pretty good he comes from the wing of the party that seems to care mostly about economic issues but he's been pretty good on it he's and he's also the only Republican and conservative who's really had the cojones to cough fo nays to go after entitlements which are the biggest driver of debt and deficits that are some of the greatest threats to our Liberty since we've been in there he had a he was the guy who put forward the path to prosperity he said we'll touch the third rail will reform Medicare Medicaid Social Security he gets a lot of credit for that a lot of Republicans are far too cowardly to even touch those issues with regard to Donald Trump he played it fair enough there were a lot of Republicans some of whom are now employed by the administration some of whom are in high posts in the administration who threw Trump under the bus who said I won't support him he should drop out he should get out of here Paul Ryan didn't quite do that Paul Ryan played nicely he didn't want to say that the Republican Party made this awful error he didn't pull the MIT Romney and say this is the end of the world and you know what an idiot you would be to vote for Donald Trump he didn't do that he he basically was respectful of the American people and was fairly respectful too toward the president so I give him a lot of credit for that too when he took the job as Speaker nobody wanted to be Speaker it's easy to forget in these 24-hour news cycles but the Congress was hopelessly divided at that time between the freedom caucus and the establishment types Boehner was considered a toxic figure the Conservatives really didn't like him at all they felt he didn't stand up enough to Barack Obama and Paul Ryan took it as a consensus job he was the one guy who could do it didn't seem like he really wanted to that much he was doing a wonderful job for his own career and for the country as a Budget Chairman and he took the job and he he did fine in it he's not rock-ribbed on some of the social issues he's not rock-ribbed on immigration but c'est la vie all in all I think he's done a pretty good job who knows when someone's been a politician for that long basically his entire life usually there are some other considerations here it's not just to see his kids and it's not just because he's been in Congress for 20 years one suspects that he thinks that the Republican Congress is not going to survive the election perhaps he suspects that Donald Trump might not survive the election or he just wants to run for another office but all in all I think conservatives should be nice to him we shouldn't eat our own we should wish him well he did some good stuff and compared to a lot of other politicians and issues he's a lot better than they were moving on to some scarier news the feds have raided president Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen and what this seems to be is Democrats and bureaucrats trying to overturn a presidential election over a hooker over a hooker ten years ago Donald Trump met a hooker they allegedly had one tryst together and that was it and when I heard that story I was shocked I actually was really shocked that Donald Trump only did it once I figured you know if she was a famous porn star it would have been at least five or six times now just one night that's the end they're gonna try to overturn a presidential election for this I had the privilege of talking to Antonin Scalia before he died and a couple on two occasions I got to meet him and we asked him what the greatest threat to American liberty was and he didn't hesitate he said the bureaucracy the unelected executive agencies and this is what people mean by the deep state the deep state isn't some secret underground bunker with computers and everything you know I guess they probably have that too but that's just because it's the federal government it's not this crazy conspiracy it's just bureaucrats and he observed that there's nothing conspiratorial about recognizing that and this is bureaucrats trying to undo a presidential election the Mulder investigation has clearly exceeded whatever limits it pad I suppose it didn't really have any at all the the investigation was supposed to be into Russian interference in the election for some reason now we're looking at president Trump's personal lawyer and communique he had with some hooker ten years ago I don't know how we got there and it's really put him in a tough spot because the investigation has gone on way too long it's going way too far we shouldn't be talking about hookers ten years ago if it's actually about Russia we should talk about Russia but now if Trump fires Muller he looks guilty even if Muller has nothing if Trump doesn't fire Muller Muller could indict him over the pack of bubblegum that Trump lifted from the Queen 711 in 1955 who knows these investigations are really big you can indict a ham sandwich in New York or DC so what should be done about Muller my gut instinct is that the Muller investigation hasn't turned up very much of what it was trying to turn up namely Donald Trump The Manchurian Candidate wearing a trench coat like Boris from Rocky and Bullwinkle talking to the Russians you know in secret meetings and colluding with them and undermining the integrity of the United States I don't think they got any of that I think they're throwing spaghetti at the wall and grasping at straws and you're gonna end up with a lot of procedural crimes and talking to hookers and things for four nights in a hotel ten years ago so my instinct tells me don't fire Muller the only way you can guarantee that Trump looks guilty in the court of public opinion which is frankly the only one that really matters in politics is is to fire Mulder that looks like an admission of guilt it almost seems like he's being baited into firing him so I think that probably that would be a mistake to do that but it's really frustrating and it shows all the more reason why we elected Donald Trump we elected Donald Trump to stop this ridiculous nonsense and to stop unelected bureaucrats from telling us how to run our country that's how they do it in Europe that's how they do it in Brussels that's how they do in the United Kingdom I'd say they do it in a lot of places in the world I guess not in the UK anymore since brexit but that's not how we do it in America it shouldn't be how we run our government in America and the the bureaucracy is the threat that's the threat to freedom and then in other news we may go to war with Syria our dear president Kofi fais tweeted that we're about to fire missiles at Syria you'll remember you remember when FDR tweeted about how he was going to drop the atomic bombs you remember how they tweet get ready I guess we actually did drop leaflets down when the people tweet it you know the tweet from President Trump read quote get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and smart get ready Russia in Syria in another tweet Trump said that our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War that's the alleged Russian Russian stooge that's boris and Natasha according to the Democrats he's talking about how awful our relationship with Russia is which it is reports suggest that the Syrian government under Bashar Assad dropped bombs filled with chemical weapons on Duma that attack that alleged attack came just after Donald Trump declared that he would be pulling troops out of Syria and now there's a question do we respond do we have to fire more missiles throw some soldiers in there do some more things some conservatives are skeptical here guys like Tucker Carlson they point out that we don't have firm evidence that this was an attack by the regime that that it doesn't make much sense for the regime to be using chemical weapons as they're about to get exactly what they want they want the Americans out of there they're about to get exactly what they want it's announced that they'll get what they want and then Bashar Assad what a dummy has this chemical attack also in February defense secretary mattis admitted that there was no evidence that Bashar Assad used sarin gas on his citizens despite reports that he did if you consulted the mainstream news if you ask the average person who read the newspaper they'd say oh yeah Bashar Assad used sarin gas on his citizens but general mattis defense secretary mattis said no we don't have any evidence of that that's just a thing people report now Bashar Assad is a butcher I mean he's an absolute monster and a psychopath and a butcher but why would he do this why would why on earth would he do this sort of chemical attack now it doesn't make a lot of sense doesn't mean that he didn't do it it's just a little strange it doesn't quite add up so so what is our strategic interest in Syria president Trump is just a point to the Ambassador John Bolton one of the greatest men in the country with one of the greatest mustaches in the country to be his national security advisor will the very hawkish - initially hawkish John Bolton pushed for an increased military presence in Syria that's what people are suggesting you're saying John Bolton never met a country didn't want a bomb John Bolton never saw him made at Middle East country didn't want to invade that's the caricature of John Bolton that's the cartoon that they portray him as on TV I suspect that he won't push for much increased action in Syria because John Bolton despite that caricature that the Democrats have made of him is a very serious strategic thinker and the guy that you get on TV also is not the guy you get in the government there they are the two different media and I you know full disclosure I've known the Bolton family for a while and I'm friends with some of them and I got to meet him on an occasion and I was immediately impressed by how incredible his breadth and depth of knowledge is the guy can just monologue with precision and detail on virtually any topic and foreign affairs this is not a guy who goes hopping along things Bom Bom Bom we need to bomb everybody you know he doesn't have a giant button on his desk and he just keeps clicking it John Bolton has also pointed out that the great threat to the world order the great threat to the United States is Iran it's not Syria he's actually called the Syrian civil war a sideshow he said it's a tragic event it's awful to see it's been going on for seven years but it's ultimately a sideshow it doesn't quite threaten American national interests and we have this question is it worth getting bogged down you know full-scale war there is it worth spilling a lot of American blood over there or is it better to keep our powder dry for a conflict with Iran it seems to me that the clear answer is the latter and I suspect that's the position of John Bolton based on statements that he's made in public and I suspect that that's the view of Donald Trump who campaigned against stupid wars in the Middle East who campaigned against intervening in every country that has a problem so I wouldn't worry about it too much I think it's being really hyped I think it's being played up a lot I think these sort of attacks these red lines are being catered to in the media but I don't think there's any evidence from the dubs to the Hawks and our government that we're gonna get bogged down there and probably we shouldn't anyway okay that's all the time I have I'm sorry that I couldn't bring you the pretty girls and John I wish I could
