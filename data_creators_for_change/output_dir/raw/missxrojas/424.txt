1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
I was in Marks and Spencers earlier

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,389
today at the Tesco next door don't been

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,069
a power cut so understandably everyone

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,870
rushed to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box Spencer to do their</font>

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,610
shopping once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I picked out my roasted</font>

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,469
red peppers and my portobello mushroom I

7
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,059
got into self-service<font color="#E5E5E5"> checkout in front</font>

8
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,559
of me there was a lady who can have been

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,059
queuing for more than two minutes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

10
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are about 10 people in the queue</font>

11
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,420
it was quite slow because there were two

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,250
checkouts open but that was unsampled

13
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,810
they were restarting all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

14
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,519
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power cut and the tills actually</font>

15
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,990
had real people and I'm had massive

16
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,550
massive queue so I thought I better stay

17
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,990
in the self-service checkout as I say

18
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,250
she can't have been queuing for more

19
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,510
than two minutes I think two minutes is

20
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,279
an exaggeration should probably cube for

21
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,500
you know a minute before when standing

22
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,610
in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she started muttering</font>

23
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,980
ridiculous ridiculous is absolutely

24
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,510
ridiculous the next five minutes she

25
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,219
continued it as mutter ridiculous

26
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,020
ridiculous as though hoping that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

27
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,579
join the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation with her and say</font>

28
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,710
oh how great is that a power cut have

29
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,989
made service<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5-10 minutes long rather</font>

30
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,579
than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know two seconds what an</font>

31
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,140
outrage it really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have two</font>

32
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,730
supermarkets next to one another so if

33
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just pop to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other one when</font>

34
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,969
one is closed how terribly unfair that

35
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,410
they've built these machines for us that

36
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,910
make our shopping experience quicker

37
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,949
really what a terrible shame needless to

38
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,480
say I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> very little sympathy for her</font>

39
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,739
muttering but who knows she might have

40
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a bad day happens a lot in kiosk use</font>

41
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,299
supermarket queues all sorts of kids

42
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,470
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rare that you see someone being</font>

43
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,299
direct about that anger if<font color="#CCCCCC"> something's</font>

44
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">not quite working out they wanted it to</font>

45
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,150
be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of muttering I</font>

46
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,590
feel like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very kind of tense</font>

47
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,030
exercise if they let people just

48
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,860
mushroom to themselves anxious<font color="#E5E5E5"> inwards</font>

49
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,930
feeling can't stop thinking of the slide

50
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,820
in the television program<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> West Wing</font>

51
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,170
series is one of my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all time</font>

52
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,640
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's set in the white house and the</font>

53
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">line I kept thinking of comes from an</font>

54
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,909
episode called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Posse Comitatus focuses a</font>

55
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,799
lot on whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's right for the</font>

56
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,420
leaders of one country to decide to

57
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,250
execute an important government official

58
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,780
in another country someone explains to

59
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,070
the president that if they do go through

60
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the execution they can't do it on</font>

61
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,909
American soil and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the president says the</font>

62
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we choose to care about he says</font>

63
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,450
it quite dismissively quite despairing

64
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,590
me he's really stuck because he's a

65
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,360
person who has to decide whether or not

66
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,100
to do this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as he says in later</font>

67
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,299
the episode is just rolled it's

68
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,009
completely and utterly wrong I think

69
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,720
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of hope in the things we</font>

70
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,009
choose to care about I think there's a

71
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found in it think that</font>

72
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,640
choice is the most important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

73
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,290
have and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> university in your</font>

75
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,530
and everything's constructed and built

76
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it seems very false in that and</font>

77
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,330
we've all made it ourselves by now I

78
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,889
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really so much</font>

79
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,750
that it made up and it's fake

80
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,610
everything we've lived as a lights more

81
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,860
than it's all destruction that we have

82
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,330
to be aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and we have to be aware</font>

83
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,980
of the strength of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure upon</font>

84
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,810
us and our strength of ourselves within

85
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,670
that structure in many ways our only

86
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,860
power in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those systems we live in are</font>

87
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,660
the things we choose to care about those

systems are<font color="#E5E5E5"> made up of the things we've</font>

89
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,260
just care about the first cut of this I

90
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">said it was a foundation of</font>

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,030
through a common love of television

<font color="#CCCCCC">shows and books that in reality it's so</font>

much bigger than that I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I keep</font>

100
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,880
made around this time last year when i

101
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,680
talked about yielding to rage and not

102
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,600
yield into rage letting something roll

103
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,920
off your back while then letting it get

104
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,989
to you is like I think probably the

105
00:02:57,989 --> 00:02:59,790
hardest lesson i've have to learn and

106
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,739
i'm a very stubborn person<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a Leo you</font>

107
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,020
know so for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means I think</font>

108
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,640
it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a very stubborn person and</font>

109
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,959
then again we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be careful not to</font>

110
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,580
become passive people if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

111
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,050
about anything because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easier not</font>

112
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,850
to care I think you're equally as

113
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,739
unhappy if you care about everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

114
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,090
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi friends Lauren and Matt got</font>

115
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,890
married and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read from</font>

the last page<font color="#CCCCCC"> of paper towels and in</font>

117
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,540
there it's all about a choice of

118
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,940
metaphor and why that's important now

119
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> redefines a way we're</font>

120
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,660
thinking how they're in a way claims

121
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,940
certain truths about the world and about

122
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,190
people about everyone our choices say so

123
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,260
much about us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other people as well as</font>

124
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ourselves being aware that you have a</font>

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,670
choice of what positive of what you get

upset<font color="#CCCCCC"> by what makes you happy in a way</font>

127
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,900
we sometimes pretend that those choices

128
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,090
aren't really choices and that they're

129
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,160
kind of visceral reactions like natural

130
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,630
reactions I don't know that that's

131
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,459
entirely true I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

132
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,140
things that we choose to care about and

I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those things for most</font>

things direct that makes sense swing and
