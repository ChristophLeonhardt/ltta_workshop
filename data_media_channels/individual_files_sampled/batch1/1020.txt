just this week in the face of its funding crisis unruhe was celebrating the start of the academic year and the reopening of its schools girls arriving for class in the Gela zone refugee camp in the occupied West Bank welcomed by the agency's chief Unruh has been scrambling all year to drum up the money to maintain its services after the us withheld more than three hundred million dollars in funding now comes confirmation that those cuts are permanent the US State Department saying the fundamental business model and fiscal practices that have marked unruffle years tied to an Resendiz Lee and exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries is simply unsustainable the United States will no longer commit further funding to this irredeemably flawed operation for the Palestinian leadership the decision is not about the specifics of a UN agency rather an attack on the Palestinian cause and the u.s. may argue that it's taxpayers money and they are free to do whatever they want to do with it yes but who give them the right to approve the stealing of my land my future my aspiration my hopes my capital my aqsa mosque my Holy Sepulchre Church they have no right whatsoever the Palestinians the final status of the more than five million refugees who assert a right of return to present-day Israel is like the status of Jerusalem an issue to be settled by negotiation not by a pre-emptive US position that position is referred to at least in the language used in the US statement when it talks about the exponentially expanding number of people who rely on Unruh that suggests this isn't just a move against one specific agency but also against the continued refugee status of millions of people for the Safi family home is the village of baton abala now in Israel not the Jala's on refugee camp where most of them were born and raised what can I do if I go back on my own I can't tend the land I want my children there before me we want them there the future is theirs and their children's use rasathi has 70 grandchildren and great-grandchildren among Israeli Jews there's all but political consensus that allowing all such families to return would destroy the Jews character of the state but there's also concerned not least reported within the Israeli security establishment about the effects of killing off their main provider of aid in order to disrupt the politics but I think people are asking whether what we're seeing is the political instrumentalization of aid and what we say is that the vulnerability and the needs of the people are simply too great in the short term unruhe will continue to seek ways to plug its funding gap Germany among the first donor nations to promise extra money warning of an uncontrollable chain reaction if Unruh were forced to shut down Harry Fawcett al-jazeera gelas own refugee camp in the occupied West Bank
