00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:24,923
AND YOU KNOW, I’M TRYING TO THINK OF AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING

151
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:27,159
THINK OF AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT THE NORTH KOREANS GAVE

152
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:27,492
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS GAVE AWAY.

153

164
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,410
THE HILL WAS THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE TO END THOSE EXERCISES.

165
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,512
MISTAKE TO END THOSE EXERCISES. I THINK PEOPLE ARE BITING THEIR

166
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:47,613
I THINK PEOPLE ARE BITING THEIR TONGUES PARTLY BECAUSE A LOT OF

167
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,915
TONGUES PARTLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE MEMBERS ARE SEEING

00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:53,252
THESE MEMBERS ARE SEEING ESPECIALLY SENATORS ARE SEEING

169
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:55,254
ESPECIALLY SENATORS ARE SEEING INFORMATION THAT WE’RE NOT PRIVY

170
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:55,521
INFORMATION THAT WE’RE NOT PRIVY TOO.

171
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:57,656
TOO. THERE WAS A VERY SERIOUS FEAR

172
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,458
THERE WAS A VERY SERIOUS FEAR THAT WE WERE ON THAT TRACK TO

173
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:01,060
THAT WE WERE ON THAT TRACK TO WAR THAT DAVID IGNATIUS WAS

174
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,494
WAR THAT DAVID IGNATIUS WAS TALKING ABOUT.

175
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,429
TALKING ABOUT. A YEAR AGO, THINGS WERE

176
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,263
A YEAR AGO, THINGS WERE DRAMATICALLY TERRIBLE.

177
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:05,731

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,403
PRESIDENT AT LEAST THE CHANCE TO PUT US ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING.

180

00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:17,877
ULTIMATELY LEADS PEOPLE TO BE MORE CONCERNED THAN THEY ALREADY

184
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:18,177
MORE CONCERNED THAN THEY ALREADY ARE.

00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:09,495
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF COULD LATER MEET WITH THE NORTH

213
00:06:09,506 --> 00:06:10,196
LATER MEET WITH THE NORTH KOREANS AFTER WE ALREADY KNOW

214
