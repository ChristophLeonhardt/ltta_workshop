all right I'm gonna let you guys in on a little secret as many of you know the better part of my adult life I've been in the music industry here in LA but what a lot of people don't know is that during those 10 years in the music industry I wrote for a lot of artists that white yeah I wrote for several urban record labels who on their roster had a lot of big rap and R&B artists and yep I charted but it's funny when I was making them money they never accused me of cultural appropriation for being a white chick writing for their black artists but that was a very different day in age because now those accusations are being slung across all different genres of music and areas of culture this past week Bruno Mars was the subject of heated debate and criticism pertaining to cultural appropriation which really ticks me off because his music is so uplifting and upbeat and usually has a really great universal message to it a few years ago he had one of the best Superbowl halftime shows ever and it was completely clean and void of any salacious body parts or black panther symbols or anything else otherwise scandalous and my question is how long and how far are people going to take this cultural appropriation thing I mean if we take it far enough are people going to say that as a music major at Auburn I shouldn't have been spending two years of my collegiate career studying the anthology of music history which includes decades of R&B Motown jazz funk music should anyone other than white people be allowed to listen to Mozart or Bach or Beethoven or amaldi Justin Timberlake has also been criticized for cultural appropriation because of his R&B style songs now we used to celebrate when a white person had a soulful element to their voice because let's face it it's not that common but it's beautiful but not no mo so again I ask how far are we gonna go with this because if you're not white go ahead and sign off that internet because it was invented by white people and if you get sick during this flu season you better refuse those antibiotics because the first antibiotic penicillin was invented by a white man Scottish microbiologist Alexander Fleming and it may not matter much right now but come May it's really gonna suck when you can't use your air conditioner because no more cultural appropriation right and are we going to put all language interpreters out of work because I mean I'm not Mexican but I do speak Spanish and what about those sign language interpreters who stand next to speakers and preachers and presidents are we going to axe their jobs too and as a white person if I go to Mexico as I often do should I not purchase a souvenir from there now tourism accounts for over 1/3 of Mexico's revenue so Mexico's going to take a major hit should I not go to Cabo Cantina up on Hollywood Boulevard for Taco Tuesdays can I not dine at AAG oh my favorite Italian restaurant here in LA how about my patron a patronage of those little mom-and-pop restaurants in Little Ethiopia seriously how far are we going to take this all cultures are not equal and what we now call cultural appropriation used to be called appreciating someone's culture which is a good thing so think about it is this really the road you guys want to go down and I'm just asking thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rubble subscribe to our premium content at WWWE a forward slash shows and make sure you're following us on Facebook and Twitter also download our new app for the rebel media on the App Store you download it and you'll have access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
