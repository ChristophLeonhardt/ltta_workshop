20
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,199
it hurts<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway now there were a number</font>

21

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,739
and and talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she perceived</font>

to share her perspective with you right

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,020
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take a look</font>

29
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,240
she was crying the whole time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font>

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,430
she<font color="#CCCCCC"> hung up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phone she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at me</font>

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,400
and said he didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember his</font>

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,229
name

33
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:21,750
that's the that's the hurting part he

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">was almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joking he said well I</font>

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,430
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> you knew he was something to the</font>

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,560
fact that he knew what he was getting

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,380
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he signed up but I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,740
hurts anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just</font>

39
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter-of-factly that this is what</font>

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,710
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who is signing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up for</font>

42
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,670
that's the way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> interpreted it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

43
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,640
was horrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was insensitive it was</font>

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,860
absolutely crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and unnecessary limit</font>
