IN ISTANBUL FOR THIS INTERSECTION AND THAT’S SOME

134
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,216
INTERSECTION AND THAT’S SOME SORT OF ROGUE OPERATION?

135
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,152
SORT OF ROGUE OPERATION? IT SEEMS VERY CLEAR FROM WHAT WE

136
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:45,254
IT SEEMS VERY CLEAR FROM WHAT WE KNOW OR WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW

137
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:47,556
KNOW OR WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW THAT THIS WAS A PRETTY ELABORATE

138
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:50,959
THAT THIS WAS A PRETTY ELABORATE PLAN THAT HAD TO BE AUTHORIZED

139
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:54,530
PLAN THAT HAD TO BE AUTHORIZED AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT

140
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:57,166
AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT MOHAMMED BEN SOLOMON AND THE WAY

141
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,635
MOHAMMED BEN SOLOMON AND THE WAY HE OPERATES, IT SUGGESTS NOTHING

142
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,636
HE OPERATES, IT SUGGESTS NOTHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

143
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:02,438
LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT HIS DIRECT APPROVAL.

144
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,674
WITHOUT HIS DIRECT APPROVAL. SO THIS -- IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS

00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:05,875
SO THIS -- IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS THE COVER STORY AND I THINK

146
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,277
IS THE COVER STORY AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT GAVE US A PREVIEW.

147
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:13,149
THE PRESIDENT GAVE US A PREVIEW. MAYBE HE GOT A HINT FROM THE

148
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:13,482
MAYBE HE GOT A HINT FROM THE KING.

149
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:15,184
KING. BUT I THINK HE GAVE US A PREVIEW

150
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:16,719
BUT I THINK HE GAVE US A PREVIEW OF WHAT THE STORY IS GOING TO BE

151
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:20,089
OF WHAT THE STORY IS GOING TO BE LATER TODAY.

152

00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:08,659
CROSS THE PRESIDENT WHEN YOU HAVE SAUDI LEADERS WHO ARE

242
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,061
HAVE SAUDI LEADERS WHO ARE MURDERING WASHINGTON POST

243
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:10,461
MURDERING WASHINGTON POST JOURNALISTS?

244
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:11,662
JOURNALISTS? >> YOU WOULD THINK THAT THIS

245
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:13,597
>> YOU WOULD THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE THE RED LINE.

246
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:15,166
WOULD BE THE RED LINE. WE THOUGHT THE RED LINE MAY HAVE

247
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,267
WE THOUGHT THE RED LINE MAY HAVE BEEN THE TARIFFS.

248
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:18,402
BEEN THE TARIFFS. BUT IN THIS CASE, YES, LINDSEY

249

BUT IN THIS CASE, YES, LINDSEY GRAHAM AND SEVERAL OTHER

250
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,438
GRAHAM AND SEVERAL OTHER REPUBLICANS WERE STRONG IN

251
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,739
REPUBLICANS WERE STRONG IN SAYING THAT THE REPERCUSSIONS

252
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,877
SAYING THAT THE REPERCUSSIONS HAD TO BE SEVERE.

253
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,246
HAD TO BE SEVERE. HOWEVER, JOE, IT WAS WITHIN

254
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:29,380
HOWEVER, JOE, IT WAS WITHIN MOMENTS THAT THE PRESIDENT

255
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,582
MOMENTS THAT THE PRESIDENT REALLY ALLOWED MBS AND THE

256
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,951
REALLY ALLOWED MBS AND THE SAUDIS TO HAVE THIS PLAUSIBLE

257
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,586
SAUDIS TO HAVE THIS PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY UNDERCUTTING THEIR

258
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:37,721
DENIABILITY UNDERCUTTING THEIR OWN SECRETARY OF STATE’S ABILITY

EFFECTIVE IN HIS MEETING, AS WELL.

262
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,061
WELL. LIKE YOU SAID EARLIER, THE ONLY

263
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,496
LIKE YOU SAID EARLIER, THE ONLY REALISTIC OUTCOME NOW WOULD BE

264
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:50,101
REALISTIC OUTCOME NOW WOULD BE THAT POMPEO IS PUT IN A POSITION

265
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:53,771
THAT POMPEO IS PUT IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO RUBBER STAMP

266
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:58,610
OF HAVING TO RUBBER STAMP WHATEVER THE SAUDIS’ EXPLANATION

267
00:08:58,644 --> 00:08:58,910
WHATEVER THE SAUDIS’ EXPLANATION IS.

268
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:01,079
IS. WHO GOES TO AN INTERROGATION

269
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:02,614
WHO GOES TO AN INTERROGATION WITH A BONE SAW.

270
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:05,383
WITH A BONE SAW. BUT THAT THIS WAS SOME KIND OF

271
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:10,321
BUT THAT THIS WAS SOME KIND OF AN INTERROGATION THAT THE SAUDIS

272
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:11,022
AN INTERROGATION THAT THE SAUDIS HAD NO IDEA WAS GOING TO LEAD TO

273
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:11,656
HAD NO IDEA WAS GOING TO LEAD TO THESE CONSEQUENCES AND A

274
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,023
THESE CONSEQUENCES AND A KILLING.

275
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:15,527
KILLING. SO THE IMPLICATIONS ARE REALLY,

276
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:20,198
SO THE IMPLICATIONS ARE REALLY, REALLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE’VE

277
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:21,632
REALLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE’VE TALKED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF

00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,441
THAT BEGINS WITH JOURNALISTS. I REMEMBER VIVIDLY A TRAIN TRIP

283
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:32,944
I REMEMBER VIVIDLY A TRAIN TRIP WHEN I TALKED TO A GROUP FOR

00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,078
WHEN I TALKED TO A GROUP FOR INTERNATIONAL, WHO TOLD ME IT

285
