1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,650
This is the port district of Tel Aviv. It’s
a popular shopping area, and the perfect place

2
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,690
to meet up with Dror Sharon, a former member
of the Air Force, and now the founder of Consumer Physics.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,259
The company raised $2.7 million via
a huge Kickstarter campaign so that it could

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,840
produce a device called the SCiO, which may
soon change the way we shop for groceries.

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,079
When you think about it, how do you make your
selection today?

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,840
Grab it and feel how firm it is.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,620
So it’s good, but you might want to have
some scientific backing to what you’re doing.

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,120
Right.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,379
The SCiO replaces your grandmother’s squeeze
test - sorry, grandma - to tell you the best

10
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:53,699
cucumber or tomato to pick.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,620
In an instant,
it displays the food’s calorie, fat and sugar content.

12
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,699
It’s the quickest way to
finding the perfect potato.

13
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,530
That’s cool. It’s really cool.

14
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,600
And you can actually train yourself

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,320
I mean this is like some Star Trek S*** right?!

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,760
A spectrometer usually looks like this. It’s
a big ole hunk of scientific gear that can

17
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,460
peer into things and determine their properties.
Rather incredibly, the SCiO shrinks much of

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,250
the same technology down onto a chip. It zaps
an object with near infrared light, stirs

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,200
up its molecules and tells a story about the
object. As people go around zapping things

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,100
with the SCiO, the objects get put into a
database - this then becomes a giant log of

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,240
all the materials in our world.

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,980
That sounds all well and good,

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,700
but how would the SCiO fair against one of mankind’s most mysterious creations.

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,439
This is the cheese test. Good ole American
Velveeta.

25
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,820
The label is 290, here its 300.

26
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,260
So it’s almost spot on! What’s the fat
percentage on the label?

27
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,760
23

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,160
23 and you’re 25!

29
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,340
The SCiO’s value should go well beyond kumquats
and industrialized cheese.

30
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,600
It can help farmersdecide when to harvest their crops,

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,400
it can
detect watered down fuel at shady gas stations,

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,980
and It can tell real medicines from fake pills.

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,210
When you think of health care actually, it's
not about what you’re buying it's actually

34
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,430
tracking your well being over time

35
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:36,650
Ok!

36
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,330
and instead of sending stuff to the lab you’ll
actually be able to measure it on yourself.

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,000
Dror even sees a future for this device in
your bathroom.

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,740
You can measure teeth, you can measure saliva,
you can measure hair, you can measure urine,

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,820
you can measure the other thing so there's
a ton of stuff and people tell us that they’re

40
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,590
going to use it for clinical trials.

41
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,800
So I’m gonna take my smartphone into the
toilet.

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,480
Well it'll probably be inside your toilet
already.

43
00:03:03,480 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh right, yea, that make sense.
