00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,200
risk of inflation remains very very

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">remote and the persistence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,120
unemployment remains very real and let

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,590
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain a little bit about</font>

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,119
unemployment for some people to look at

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,609
the five percent for you know less than

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">five percent unemployment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,840
really good performance the answer is

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,150
the labor market is still very weak

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,619
evidence the fact that wages are barely

12
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,130
keeping up with inflation the low labor

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,739
force participation there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,750
disguised and employment if you look at

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,850
those who are holding jobs part-time

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">involuntarily the number of people in</font>

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,800
disability the people who discouraged

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,360
workers have stopped searching for a job

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,989
there's a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good case case that</font>

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,520
reasonable people have made for for not

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,890
to mean I remember I'm old enough I

22
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,900
remember you know late late Reagan was

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,489
for a percent inflation it didn't seem

24
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,070
like a hell hole at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time and that</font>

25
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,140
would give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a lot more leeway than we</font>

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,170
currently have I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that if</font>

27
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,720
you ask historically how do we get two

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,410
percent as the number uh people looked

29
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,180
around and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually there's no</font>

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,160
theory behind the two percent number it

31
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,470
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that was picked out of the</font>

32
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,250
thin air if you ask now knowing what we

33
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,300
know now where our economy is today<font color="#E5E5E5"> wha</font>

34
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,680
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a more reasonable number I think</font>

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,259
four percent would certainly be more

36
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,210
reasonable than 2% maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should be</font>

37
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">five percent but there's a growing</font>

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,590
consensus let's try four percent and see

39
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,149
what happens the idea at the time was

40
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,920
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inflationary processes were</font>

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,190
very unstable if you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> above two</font>

42
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,300
percent you went to two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half</font>

43
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,399
percent you next day you would be a

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,770
three percent and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be escalating</font>

45
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right now it's very</font>

46
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,470
hard for us to move away from deflation

47
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,110
very hard to get us to get any

48
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,540
inflationary momentum in the economy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means given that that if we should</font>

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,300
be very comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a four percent</font>
