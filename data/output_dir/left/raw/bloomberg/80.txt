1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,500
(lighthearted music)

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,240
Jack Ma is Asia's richest man

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,070
and most recognizable business tycoon.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,640
He's the chairman of Alibaba.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,134
China's E-commerce giant

6
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,710
and one of the 10 largest
companies in the world.

7
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,610
Yet he still wants more.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,530
We know where we're going,

9
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,790
we want to be the fifth largest economy.

10
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,550
Big words from the man some
call Asia's Jeff Bezos.

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,800
He's confident, he's charismatic

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,870
and he's definitely not the average CEO.

13
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:30,797
♪ Can you feel the love tonight ♪

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,503
This is how a poor school teacher

15
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:35,230
went from the classroom, to being one

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,982
of the most influential
multi-billionaires in the world.

17
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:41,065
(lighthearted music)

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,450
Ma was born in China's southeastern
city, Hangzhou, in 1964.

19
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,050
His parents were traditional
musician storytellers.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,430
As a teenager, he started to learn English

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,410
from foreign tourists,

22
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,400
after China opened up in the late 1970's.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,390
And then for nine years, Jack Ma,

24
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,640
hung around outside the Hangzhou Hotel,

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,550
which is now called the Shangri-La.

26
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,970
He would get up at five a.m.

27
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,300
to talk to travelers.

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,420
That's Bloomberg Technology
reporter, Lulu Chen.

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,720
And I cover China
internet for Bloomberg.

30
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,070
Ma failed China's National University

31
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,153
entrance exam twice

32
00:01:16,153 --> 00:01:19,320
before being admitted to
Local Teachers College.

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,290
He graduated in 1988.

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,010
He applied for 30 jobs and got rejected.

35
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,873
Including from the fast food giant, KFC.

36
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:29,225
When KFC come to China,

37
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:31,357
(crowd laughing)

38
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:35,397
24 people went for the job.

39
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:38,470
23 people were accepted,
I was the only one guy.

40
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,020
Then Ma got a job at a local university

41
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,210
and taught English there
for about five years

42
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,170
earning just $15 dollars a month.

43
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,330
On the side he started
a translation company

44
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,510
with several friends.

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,620
During a company trip to the U.S. in 1995,

46
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,710
Ma had his first encounter
with the internet,

47
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,270
at a friend’s place in Seattle.

48
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,045
I searched the first word, beer.

49
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:05,530
(crowd laughing)

50
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,520
I don't why, because easy to spell, maybe.

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,810
And I see beers from Germany,

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,630
beers from U.S.A, beers from Japan.

53
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,250
But there's no beer from China.

54
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,620
So he searched for the word China instead

55
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,370
and still couldn't find anything.

56
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,200
And that got him thinking,

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,330
he wanted to build something

58
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,410
that would put China on the world's map.

59
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,080
He started China Pages,

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,030
a Yellow Pages like website,
but it didn't take off.

61
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,730
Then Ma joined a government agency

62
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,780
in Beijing to help set up a website.

63
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,180
(energetic music)

64
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,550
By 1999, the internet stock boom

65
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,100
had gripped Wall Street.

66
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,790
And back in his Hangzhou apartment,

67
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,700
Ma decided to try again.

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,450
With his wife and a group of friends,

69
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,250
Ma raised $80,000 dollars,

70
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,140
and set up Alibaba, a site
that allowed businesses

71
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,516
to sell stuff to each other.

72
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:58,433
(speaking excitedly in a foreign language)

73
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:05,129
(upbeat music)

74
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,650
By 2000, Alibaba had
raised $25 million dollars

75
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,730
from investors, including
Goldman Sachs and SoftBank.

76
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,230
He had no business plan

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,920
and zero revenue,

78
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:25,630
but his eyes were very strong.

79
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,500
Strong eyes.

80
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,940
(laughing)

81
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,120
In 2003, Alibaba started Taobao,

82
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,820
a platform for individual sellers

83
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,090
to trade with each other

84
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,570
and publicly declared war against eBay,

85
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,980
who had started to make
a foray into China.

86
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,440
Jack Ma has this famous saying

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,140
that Alibaba is a crocodile
in the Yangtze River,

88
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,410
whereas eBay is a shark in the ocean.

89
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,160
And if they fight eBay in the ocean

90
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,032
then they'll lose,

91
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:53,340
but if they fight them
in the Yangtze River

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,202
then they have a home base advantage.

93
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,785
(upbeat music)

94
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,700
In 2007, just one year

95
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,740
after it forced eBay out of China,

96
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,100
Alibaba debuted its
business-facing division

97
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,170
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

98
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,970
But it delisted five years later,

99
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,347
as its performance sagged.

100
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:12,486
(bells chiming)

101
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,640
(crowd yelling)

102
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,410
In 2014, Alibaba raised
$25 billion dollars

103
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,950
in the world’s biggest IPO in New York.

104
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,420
Everybody should have a dream.

105
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,290
What if that dream comes true?

106
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,530
After achieving dominance

107
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,810
in the business of E-commerce in China,

108
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,150
Alibaba has been building

109
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,020
an internet empire worth
$472 billion dollars

110
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,120
with businesses in cloud computing,

111
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,760
online video streaming, movie production,

112
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,580
healthcare, sports, retail,
and even news media.

113
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,730
Alibaba buying into
South China Morning Post

114
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,240
really raised eyebrows.

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,500
This is the largest English
newspaper in Hong Kong.

116
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,560
And it shows that Jack Ma's ambitions

117
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,680
weren't limited to E-commerce.

118
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,040
He wanted to influence,
not just Chinese users,

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,714
but also overseas users, as well.

120
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,270
(upbeat music)

121
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,020
The U.S. has criticized Alibaba

122
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,010
for allowing companies

123
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,280
to sell counterfeit and poorly made goods.

124
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,040
But in China, it enjoys the favor

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,360
of China's government.

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,110
It's part of Ma's company philosophy.

127
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,410
In love with the government,

128
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,930
but don't marry with them.

129
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,940
Jack Ma is an extremely fortunate man

130
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,500
for jumping on the
internet sector so early.

131
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,230
Note that this is a person

132
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,370
who has no coding skills at all.

133
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,370
He's a natural showman
and a gifted public speaker,

134
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,330
and really able to convince others

135
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,760
to believe in his vision.

136
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,620
Ma's vision of growing Alibaba

137
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,610
to be the world’s fifth largest economy

138
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,734
faces strong competition
at home and abroad.

139
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:41,640
It will require more than just
naked ambition and charisma.

140
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,490
But Ma is great at getting himself

141
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,770
in the right place at the right time.

142
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,255
So far it's served him well.

143
00:05:47,255 --> 00:00:00,000
(successful music)
