what you're looking at right now is just a small fraction of over 58,000 square feet of studios 20 individual sets while we're always broadcasting on the same 20 sets individually those sets transform so for example right now if it's 10 40 in the morning the backdrops of our sets look like it would probably be about 10 40 in the morning but come afternoon and evening they scroll down and become guess what afternoon or evening we have it in the black we have it in the vivid fuchsia we have it for you in this really pretty vibrant coral right now we're presenting what in the building we call the TSV that's a today's special value the most exciting find of the entire day every product on average will get between 6 and 8 minutes but could be as little as two and as long as a full hour there are a couple of enormous closets here at QVC that we call product central every single item that goes out on the air has to have at least two samples so we put it all at product central and on top of that all of those samples have to be prepped and ready before they go out on the air so it's constantly cycling well-oiled machine and a whole bunch of plates spinning at the same time it's been a while since I can confidently say I've had to show this jam-packed with incredible offers we have some of the most talented people working in because they get a lot of reps at it it's something that I find really impressive with the show hosting that they can go out there with a plan and have the ability to adapt that plan all why you know making sure that they're listening to the person that's there with them and they're talking to the people at home we have to wrap it up here the line producer position it's it's complicated you're really doing multiple things at the same time you're listening to the show host you're listening to the crew on headsets but you're also in real time looking at sales so you can see how many orders are coming in you can see what they're ordering what color what size you can see how many are left and you have to kind of take all that information in real time then kind of rearranging the plans for the show and it's all lined and a tricot kind of like thing so just lips on I feel like the television piece of it gives a kind of integrity to me right because knowing that I have this product that I have to literally stand inside of a camera and talk about you know I'm not a very good liar so it has to be like the right product it has to be a great value I do think the truth really resonates with people if you're lying she knows it she's someone that really loves shopping she's somebody that thinks about shopping as an enjoyable way to spend free time she's someone who loves shopping as a form of entertainment while there are some times where she comes to us to actually transact most the time she's really coming just to engage in her form of entertainment you look this opulent and if you're wondering about the cardigan that I've been wearing with this dress we fully know that she watches TV she's watching the designers on air but at the same time she has her phone out and she's using it as an ordering mechanism so our customer has become very tech savvy along the way even though she tends to be a little bit older she's really embraced the whole idea of not only watching it but also using the other mediums to order no matter kind of where television has gone with cable TV expanding or you know cord cutting or any of these other things QVC always has been able to kind of adapt it was always thought of it's something you sit down in your house and you watch TV see you know on your couch and now you can kind of watch us anywhere I've been here QVC for 26 years that's what I've enjoyed is just watching us adapt to a new world and new technology
