hey I'm Alisa Pagano I'm a regular biker and today I'm gonna test out the CD lock we're gonna see how easy it is to install what it's like to lock it up and how comfortable it is to ride first I'm gonna take off my seat that I have right now how they stole my seat another time success now for the seats that part was easy and so we're looking so I had a chance to ride the bike around with the CD walk on I walked it to a pole I walked it to a bike rack I cruised around the city a little bit and the seat was pretty comfortable kind of made the bike feel a little top-heavy when I was pushing it but then once I was on the bike it felt totally normal so my first impression of the installing the seat was that it was pretty much just like installing any any other seat the walk is a little bit cumbersome but generally you know you just pop it off wrap it around the pole lock it up if you're looking for something that doubles as a seat and a lock and you want to minimize the number of things you're carrying with you and I think it's great
