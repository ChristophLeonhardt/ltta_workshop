TO SUPPORT THEM IN WHATEVER 
THEY NEED. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS A PHONE CALL 
WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF 
JAPAN. 
AND THEY CONTINUED TO 
MAINTAINING SANCTIONS ON NORTH 
KOREA. 
AND THEY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING 
EACH OTHER AND TO CONTINUE 
THESE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS 
WITH ALLIES. 
LASTLY, ON BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE 
ADMINISTRATION I WANT TO EXTEND 
PRAYERS TO THE FAMILY, FRIENDS, 
AND LOVED ONES OF MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS. 
THE NATION HAS WATCHED FOR 30 
DAYS AS OFFICIALS HAVE SEARCHED 
FOR MOLLIE, A RISING SOPHOMORE 
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. 
SADLY, THE INDIVIDUAL BELIEVED 
TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
MURDER IS AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, 
MAKING THIS AN UNFORTUNATE 
REMINDER OF WHY WE NEED TO 
STRENGTHEN OUR IMMIGRATION 
LAWS. 
THE BIBLE TELLS US THE LORD 
HEALS THE BROKEN HEARTED. 
THE TIBETS FAMILY -- WE ARE 
GRIEVINGS WITH THEM. 
>> MIKE ELKO MEN PLEADED GUILTY 
TO PAYING STORMY DANIELS AND 
KAREN McDOUGAL. 
>> WE'VE STATED HE DID NOTHING 
WRONG. 
AND THERE ARE NO CHARGES AND 
WE'VE COMMENTED ON THIS 
EXTENSIVELY. 
>> WHY NOT REPORT THESE 
PAYMENTS. 
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO GET 
INTO THE BACK AND FORTH 
DETAILS. 
I CAN TELL YOU AS THE PRESIDENT 
HAS STATED, THERE ARE NO 
CHARGES AGAINST HIM. 
AND JUST BECAUSE MICHAEL COHEN 
MADE A PLEA DEAL DOESN'T MEAN 
THAT IMPLICATES THE PRESIDENT. 
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS NEVER LIED TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>> SO MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT THE 
TAPE OF HIM ON AIR FORCE ONE. 
HE SAID HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT 
THE PAYMENTS. 
>> I THINK THAT'S A RIDICULOUS 
ACCUSATION. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING 
WRONG AND THERE ARE NO CHARGES 
AGAINST HIM. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID TO FOX 
NEWS THIS MORNING THAT THIS 
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN ILLEGAL 
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE 
HE GAVE THE MONEY. 
HE PUT $60 MILLION OF HIS OWN 
MONEY INTO THE CAMPAIGN. 
HOW DO YOU DRAW THE LINE -- 
MAYBE IT DIDN'T FLOW THROUGH 
THE CAMPAIGN. 
HOW DO YOU DRAW THE LINE 
BETWEEN A CAMPAIGN CONVICTION. 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
THE BACK AND FORTHS OF THE 
LEGAL PART OF THAT. 
I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE 
OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS STATED A NUMBER 
OF TIMES, HE DID NOTHING WRONG 
AND THERE ARE NO CHARGES 
AGAINST HIM. 
JUST BECAUSE MICHAEL COHEN HAS 
MADE A DEAL DOESN'T MEAN 
ANYTHING. 
>> THE IMPLICATION IS THAT 
MICHAEL COHEN GAVE UP SOMETHING 
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD RATHER 
STAY SECRET. 
IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD READ 
INTO THAT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED 
HIS VIEWS ON THAT. 
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER 
TO ADD. 
>> IS THE PRESIDENT PLANNING ON 
OR INTENT ON PARDONING PAUL 
MANAFORT. 
>> THE MANAFORT CASE HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OR HIS CAMPAIGN OR 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> THE PRESIDENT COULD STILL 
HAVE THE POWER TO PARDON 
MANAFORT. 
HAS HE DISCUSSED THAT? 
HAS IT COME OUT? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY 
CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THAT. 
>> OTHER THAN WHEN HE WAS ASKED 
BY A NEWS OUTLET EARLIER THIS 
WEEK AND HE SAID THAT HE HADN'T 
BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT AT 
ALL. 
>> IN TIMES LIKE THIS, NOT THAT 
THERE MANY TIMES LIKE THIS, THE 
WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO FIGURE 
OUT IF THERE NEEDS TO BE 
INTERNAL ADJUSTMENTS TO DEAL 
WITH THE POLITICAL -- WITH THE 
HILL, WITH VOTERS, WITH 
LAWMAKERS. 
IS THE WHITE HOUSE MAKING ANY 
ADJUSTMENTS IN TERMS OF 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHIEFS OF 
STAFF, OF COMMUNICATIONS TO 
DONORS, COMMUNICATIONS TO 
SUPPORTERS, HOW YOU WOULD 
RESPOND TO PROTECTIVELY AND 
OFFENSIVELY TO -- 
>> I WOULDN'T VIEW IT THAT WAY 
AT ALL. 
AND WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE 
PREMISE OF YOUR QUESTION. 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS FOCUSED ON 
THE SAME THINGS THAT WE WERE 
FOCUSED ON THE FIRST DAY WE GOT 
HERE. 
ANDS THAT GROWING THE ECONOMY 
WHICH IS DOING EXTREME WELL. 
PROTECTING THE BORDERS, 
STRENGTHENING THE SAFETY AND 
SECURITY OF ALL AMERICANS, 
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE 
FOCUSED ON DAY ONE, JANUARY 
20th AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS 
WE'RE FOCUSED ON NOW. 
>> I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU. 
THIS IS YOUR 100th BRIEFING AND 
THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS EASY -- 
SEVERAL REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES 
TOLD ME -- PREDICTIONS COULD 
DEPRESS TURNOUT AND SERVE TO 
MAKE A BLUE WAVE BIGGER. 
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY 
REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES THAT 
WOULD MAKE THIS STATEMENT.  
IN THE THING THAT'S GOING TO 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IS THE LACK OF 
A MESSAGE BY DEMOCRATS. 
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO RUN ON 
OTHER THAN ATTACKING THE 
PRESIDENT. 
WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE STORY TO 
TELL. 
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING. 
RECORD NUMBERS JUST TODAY. 
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE 
FOCUSING ON THE THINGS THAT 
AMERICANS CARE ABOUT. 
AND I THINK THAT WILL BE 
CERTAINLY WHAT ENCOURAGES THEM. 
AND CERTAINLY WHAT WILL HELP 
PUSH REPUBLICANS TO DO WELL IN 
NOVEMBER. 
>> YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT 
STATED THAT ISRAEL WILL PAY A 
PRICE FOR THE -- NOT SURE 
THAT'S AN EXACT QUOTE. 
SHOULD ISRAEL BE CONCERNED THE 
PRICE -- NOT PREPARED OR 
WILLING TO PAY. 
>> WE THINK THAT THE 
PRESIDENT'S DECISION WAS THE 
RIGHT ONE TO MOVE THE EMBASSY. 
SOMETHING THAT OTHER PRESIDENTS 
PROMISED AND FAILED TO DO AND 
THIS IS A PRESIDENT DELIVERING 
ON THE PROMISES. 
>> WHAT PRICE MIGHT ISRAEL HAVE 
TO PAY. 
>> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING 
FURTHER FOR YOU. 
>> THANKS A LOT, SARAH. 
SINCE THE GUILTY VERDICTS IN 
THE PAUL MANAFORT TRIAL. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID KIND 
THINGS ABOUT HIM. 
HE'S SAID HE FEELS BADLY FOR 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. 
HE REFUSED TO BREAK IN ORDER TO 
GET A DEAL. 
HE TWEETED SUCH RESPECT FOR A 
BRAVE MAN. 
IS HE A CANDIDATE FOR A 
PRESIDENTIAL PARDON. 
>> THAT'S NOT UP FOR 
DISCUSSION. 
>> CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE -- 
SOME DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING THAT 
THE NOMINATION SHOULD BE PUT ON 
HOLD BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL 
DEVELOPMENTS YESTERDAY. 
SENATOR-- PUT OUT A STATEMENT. 
THIS PRESIDENT WHO IS AN 
UNINDICTED COCONSPIRATOR IN A 
CRIMINAL MATTER DOES NOT 
DESERVE THE COURTESY OF -- 
>> THIS IS A DESPERATE AND 
PATHETIC ATTEMPT BY DEMOCRATS 
TO OBSTRUCT A VERY HIGHLY 
QUALIFIED NOMINEE. 
THE HEARING DATE IS SEPTEMBER 
4th. 
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE 
THERE. 
>> TRADE TALKS BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND CHINA ARE 
RESUMING. 
THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED LOW 
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE TALKS. 
I'M WONDERING IF THAT HAS 
CHANGED AND WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE COME OUT OF THESE 
DISCUSSIONS. 
>> AS YOU SAID THESE 
CONVERSATIONS WITH CONTINUING. 
I DON'T HAVE ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS 
ON THEM. 
THEY ARE ONGOING. 
CERTAINLY WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE 
IS BETTER TRADE DEALS FOR 
UNITED STATES. 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SEE 
FREE, FAIR, AND MORE RECIPROCAL 
TRADE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, AND 
WE'LL CONTINUE IN THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS. 
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT FEEL 
BETRAYED BY MICHAEL COHEN AND 
IS IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HE 
MIGHT SAY TO ROBERT MUELLER. 
>> I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT 
IS CONCERNED AT ALL. 
HE KNOWS HE'S DONE NOTHING 
WRONG AND THERE'S NO COLLUSION. 
AND WE'LL CONTINUE FOCUSING ON 
THE THINGS AMERICANS CARE 
ABOUT. 
>> DO YOU ANTICIPATE A DEAL ON 
NAFTA? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD 
OF ANY POTENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. 
FOR DECADES, NAFTA HAS HARMED 
AMERICAN WORKERRINGS, WE'RE 
FOCUSED ON DEALING WITH THOSE 
PROBLEMS. 
AND WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. 
>> IN HIS INTERVIEW TODAY, THE 
PRESIDENT SAID HE FOUND OUT 
ABOUT THE PAYMENTS MICHAEL 
COHEN MADE LATER ON. 
BUT HE'S ON TAPE DISCUSSING HOW 
TO MAKE ONE OF THE PAYMENTS. 
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT. 
>> ONCE AGAIN I'VE COMMENTED ON 
THIS PRETTY EXTENSIVELY. 
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT KID NOTHING WRONG. 
THERE ARE NO CHARGES, THERE'S 
NO COLLUSION. 
FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT, I 
WOULD REFER YOU -- 
>> RUDY GIULIANI IS NOT A 
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE PRESIDENT. 
YOU ARE. 
>> I'M AWARE OF THAT. 
>> ON THE GROUNDS -- CONFIRMED 
THAT IT IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING 
THAT. 
>> ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE ADDRESSED 
THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES BECAUSE 
YOU CONTINUE TO ASK THE SAME 
QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER. 
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A 
DIFFERENT ANSWER. 
THERE'S NO COLLUSION, THAT'S 
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU. 
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FURTHER. 
I WOULD REFER YOU -- 
>> DID NO HAVE AFFAIRS -- 
>> WE'VE ADDRESSED THIS A 
NUMBER OF TIMES. 
>> FIRST, YOU SAID THAT THERE 
HAVE BEEN NO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT 
POTENTIA PARDON FOR PAUL 
MANAFORT. 
SO YOU'RE NOT RULING IT OUT 
ENTIRELY. 
IF THERE'S NO DISCUSSIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT SAID HE 
WON'T DO IT. 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD 
BE A PARDON. 
>> THE ONLY COMMENT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS MADE ON THIS WAS 
WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY A NEWS 
OUTLET AND HE SAID NO HE WAS 
NOT CONSIDERING THAT. 
BEYOND THAT. 
>> THAT WAS BEFORE PAUL 
MANAFORT WAS CONVICTED ON EIGHT 
OF THE 18 COUNTS AT THE TIME 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED 
THAT. 
I'M ASKING NOW THAT HE'S BEEN 
CONVICTED -- 
>> THERE HAVE BEEN NO 
DISCUSSIONS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
ON THAT MATTER. 
>> ON A DIFFERENT POINT. 
LAST TIME WE WERE IN HERE YOU 
READ OFF SOME EX-OFFICIALS AND 
ONE CURRENT OFFICIAL WHO THE 
PRESIDENT WAS CONSIDERING 
TAKING AWAY THEIR SECURITY 
CLEARANCE. 
FIRST OF ALL. 
WHO IS CONDUCTING THAT REVIEW 
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE 
SECURITY CLEARANCES WILL BE 
PULLED. 
AND SECOND OF ALL I WANTED TO 
ASK YOU ABOUT A TWEET. 
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT THAT 
JAMES CLAPPER IS BEING NICE TO 
HIM SO THAT HE DOESN'T LOSE HIS 
SECURITY CLEARANCE. 
IS THAT A THREAT THAT HE'LL 
LOSE HIS SECURITY CLEARANCE. 
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY 
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THAT FRONT. 
WHEN WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT 
I'LL LET YOU KNOW. 
>> WHO IS  DOING THE REVIEWS? 
>> A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
>> IN THE TWEET THIS MORNING, 
THE PRESIDENT WAS PRAISING HIM 
FOR THE REFUSING TO COOPERATE 
IN A WAY THAT WOULD IMPLICATE 
HIM, THE PRESIDENT. 
IS THAT WHAT HE MEANT TO 
SUGGEST? 
DOESN'T THAT SEEM TO SUGGEST 
THAT LOYALTY TO HIM IS MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN ABIDING WITH THE 
LAW OR COOPERATING WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT. 
>> MANAFORT CASE HAS NOTHING TO 
DO WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED HIS 
VIEWS. 
>> MICHAEL COHEN'S LAWYER HAS 
SUGGESTED PUBLICLY THAT THERE'S 
NEW EVIDENCE ABOUT 
FOREKNOWLEDGE OF ELECTION 
HACKING. 
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE MAINTAIN 
THERE WAS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE OF 
ANY ELECTION HACKING DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN. 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING. 
>> GIVEN THAT FIVE CONVICTED 
FELONIES ARE LINKED TO THE 
PRESIDENT OR HIS CAMPAIGN AND 
GIVEN THAT THE PRESIDENT 
PROMISED TO HIRE THE BEST 
PEOPLE. 
DID HE FAIL TO LIVE UP TO THAT 
PROMISE. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS EMPLOYED 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN HIS 
LIFETIME AND HAD INCREDIBLE 
SUCCESSES BOTH IN BUSINESS AND 
IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 
HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, I THINK HE'S 
DOING QUITE WELL. 
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T 
WANT TO ANSWER THE SAME 
QUESTION -- I DIDN'T HEAR A 
RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION. 
DID HE LIE TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 
THIS. 
>> NO AND THE PRESIDENT HAS 
ADDRESSED THIS A NUMBER OF 
TIMES. 
>> THE PRESIDENT FEELS BADLY 
FOR COHEN AND MANAFORT. 
ONE OF THE MEN PLEADED GUILTY 
AND THE OTHER WAS FOUND GUILTY 
OF TAX FRAUD WHICH ROBBED THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC OF TAX DOLLARS 
THEY WERE OWED. 
WHY DOES HE FEEL BAD FOR EITHER 
OF THESE MEN. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED 
HIS VIEWS ON THIS MATTER AND I 
HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO ADD. 
>> DOES HE BELIEVE THERE'S AN 
INTRINSIC PROBLEM WITH THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR DOES HE 
ONLY BELIEVES IF SOMEONE CLOSE 
TO HIM IS A VICTIM OF THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 
>> NO, I THINK WE SEEN A LOT OF 
CONCERNS COME OUT OF THE 
ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE THAT 
WORKED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE. 
WHETHER IT'S PETER STRZOK OR 
LISA PAGE OR JAMES COMEY. 
WE'VE WALKED THROUGH THOSE A 
NUMBER OF TIMES AND IT'S GIVEN 
CAUSE FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS. 
>> THE PRESIDENT -- HIS OWN 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT DOING 
ITS JOB. 
>> AGAIN, CERTAINLY THE 
PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED HIS 
VIEWS ON THIS MATTER AND HE'S 
RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT A NUMBER 
OF OTHER PROBLEMS THAT HE'S 
SEEN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE. 
>> I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT 
THE COMMENTS ON FOX NEWS WITH 
REGARD TO THE PAYMENTS TO MS. 
DANIELS AND MS. McDOUGAL. 
WHEN DID HE LEARN ABOUT THEM? 
AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER 
PAYMENTS? 
OR ARE THOSE THE ONLY TWO WOMEN 
WHO RECEIVED MONEY? 
>> ONCE AGAIN, I'VE ADDRESSED 
ALL I'M GOING TO SAY ON THE 
COHEN ISSUE FOR THOSE SPECIFIC 
QUESTIONS, I WOULD REFER YOU TO 
COUNSEL. 
>> CAN'T WE BRING THEM IN HERE 
FOR THE BRIEFING? 
>> THEY DON'T WORK AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO 
REACH OUT TO THEM. 
>> GOING BACK TO THE SECURITY 
CLEARANCES. 
ALL SIGNS ARE THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME A PRESIDENT PERSONALLY HAS 
BEEN HANDLING THE REMOVAL OF 
SECURITY CLEARANCES. 
IT'S USUALLY DONE BY SUPERIORS, 
EVEN IN THE LAST TWO BIG 
ESPIONAGE CASES OF THE COLD 
WAR. 
THE URBAN -- OF 1961 AND FELIX 
-- OF 1990, THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE PULLED THE SECURITY 
CLEARANCES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE 
ACCUSED OF ESPIONAGE. 
YOU SAID THE OTHERS ARE 
REVIEWING IT. 
WHO ARE THE OTHERS? 
AND DOES THE PRESIDENT TAKE A 
PERSONAL ROLE IN THE POTENTIAL 
REMOVAL OF SECURITY CLEARANCES? 
>> CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO 
DO SO. 
I KNOW THIS WILL COME AS A 
SHOCK TO YOU BUT I'M NOT AWARE 
OF THE DETAILS OF THOSE CASES 
YOU OUTLINED. 
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE 
AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE DECISION. 
AND SHE'S CONSULTING WITH THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AND 
MEMBERS OF HIS LEGAL TEAM. 
>> IS HE ALSO CONSIDERING A 
POLICY OF JUST SIMPLY HAVING 
ALL SECURITY PASSES TURNED IN 
WHEN SOMEONE LEAVES GOVERNMENT 
SERVICE? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT. 
AS A POLICY CERTAINLY WE WOULD 
LIKE THE ABILITY IF NEEDED TO 
BE ABLE TO CONSULT WITH 
INDIVIDUALS ON NATIONAL 
SECURITY MATTERS. 
BUT THEY DO FEEL THE TEAM HERE 
THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE 
SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS AS A 
WHOLE. 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE 
ARE ROUGHLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCES 
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND 
WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
OVERALL PROCESS OF WHO HAS AND 
WHO MAINTAINS THE SECURITY 
CLEARANCES. 
>> YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT HAVING CONSTITUTIONAL 
AUTHORITY ABOUT SECURITY 
CLEARANCES AS WELL AS PARDONS. 
I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS 
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS THAT 
AUTHORITY, IS ANYBODY IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE THOUGHT ABOUT 
PUTTING TOGETHER A BOARD TO 
LOOK AT SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR 
FORMER PERSONNEL AND PARDONS AS 
WELL? 
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO 
BE CONSULTING THE PARDON 
ATTORNEYS IN THE A.G.'S OFFICE. 
HAS HE THOUGHT OF DOING 
SOMETHING MORE TRANSPARENT. 
>> AS THE REVIEW OF THE 
SECURITY CLEARANCES, THERE IS A 
WORKING GROUP LOOKING AT THE 
OVERALL SECURITY CLEARANCE 
PROCESS. 
AND WHO MAINTAINS THOSE AND 
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE NEEDED 
ACROSS THE BOARD WITHIN 
GOVERNMENT. 
IN TERMS OF THE PARDON PROCESS, 
GWEN, THE PRESIDENT HAS THE 
AUTHORITY TO CARRY OUT THOSE 
DECISIONS, HE TAKES INPUT AND 
LOOKS AT THEM ON A CASE BY CASE 
BASIS. 
>> YOU SAID THERE ARE PEOPLE 
LOOKING AT SECURITY CLEARANCES. 
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
MEMBERS ON THE TEAM. 
I KNOW THE CHIEF OF STAFF IS 
INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. 
>> EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE 
PRESIDENT TOLD OUR COLLEAGUES 
AT REUTERS -- 
>> CAN YOU SPEAK UP? 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID TO 
REUTERS THAT HE COULD RUN IT IN 
REFERENCE TO THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID MANY 
TIMES THAT HE'S CHOSEN TO 
REMAIN UNINVOLVED IN THIS 
PROCESS AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE 
NOW. 
>> IS THAT AN INDICATION THAT 
HE'S THINKING ABOUT TAKING 
ACTION AGAINST ROBERT MUELLER? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY 
CONVERSATION. 
>> IS IT AN INDICATION THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SEES HIMSELF AS ABOVE 
THE LAW? 
>> NOT AT ALL. 
>> SOME LEGAL EXPERTS ARE 
SAYING THE PRESIDENT IS CORRUPT 
AND THAT THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR 
IMPEACHMENT. 
IS THE WHITE HOUSE CONCERNED 
ABOUT -- THAT THAT COULD HAVE 
AN IMPACT IN THE ELECTIONS, THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
AND DOES THE WHITE HOUSE TAKE 
THE ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. 
>> CERTAINLY WE TAKE 
ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. 
THE IDEA OF AN IMPEACHMENT IS A 
SAD ATTEMPT BY DEMOCRATS. 
THE ONLY MESSAGE THEY HAVE 
GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS AND A 
GREAT REMINDER OF WHY AMERICANS 
SHOULD SUPPORT LIKE-MINDED 
CANDIDATES LIKE THE PRESIDENT 
FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO GROW 
THE ECONOMY, CONTINUING TO 
SECURE OUR BOARDS, AND FOCUS ON 
THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF ALL 
AMERICANS. 
THE BIGGEST CONTRAST YOU COULD 
POSSIBLY MAKE IS THE MESSAGE OF 
THE DEMOCRATS WHICH IS NOTHING 
MORE THAN ATTACKING THE 
PRESIDENT AND LOOKING AT CHEAP 
POLITICAL STUNTS WHILE THIS 
WHITE HOUSE ARE FOCUSED ON 
DOING GOOD THINGS FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>> EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TOUGH WORDS OF 
CREDIT TIM FOR THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE CHAIRMAN. 
WHEN YOU -- WHETHER OR NOT THE 
PRESIDENT BROUGHT UP THE 
CRITICISM WITH POWELL DIRECTLY. 
>> I BELIEVE THE LAST TIME THEY 
MET -- I'D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK 
-- WAS AROUND THE TIME THAT 
JEROME POWELL TOOK HIS PLACE. 
>> HAS HE SPOKEN TO HIM. 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT. 
>> THANK YOU, SARA. 
ON VENEZUELA, IS THE PRESIDENT 
PLANNING ON GETTING INVOLVED 
úT 
THERE'S MILLIONS FLEEING THE 
COUNTRY. 
WHAT IS THE U.S. STANCE ON 
VENEZUELA? 
>> THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES 
TO SUPPORT VENEZUELA'S 
NEIGHBORS AND PROVIDE EMERGENCY 
AID AND SHELTER TO VENEZUELA 
AND ALSO CONTINUES TO STAND 
WITH THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ALL 
OPTIONS ON THE TABLE. 
AND WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED IF WE 
HAVE FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS. 
WE'RE GOING TO WRAP UP SO WE 
CAN JOIN THE PRESIDENT FOR THE 
MEDAL OF HONOR CEREMONY.    
>> WHEN ASKED ABOUT MICHAEL 
COHEN, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS' 
WORDS WERE HE DID NOTHING 
WRONG. 
INTERESTING STATEMENT TO MAKE. 
MANY CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS AS 
TO WHETHER A SITTING PRESIDENT 
CAN BE INDICTED OR CHARGED 
WHILE IN OFFICE. 
AND THE LINE FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS -- THE PRESIDENT DID 
NOTHING WRONG. 
AND ON PAUL MANAFORT TALKING 
ABOUT PARDONED, SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS SAYS THE CASE HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF. 
AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT WHETHER 
A PARDON MIGHT BE ISSUED BY THE 
PRESIDENT. 
SANDERS SAYING THIS HAS NOT 
SOMETHING UP FOR DISCUSSION. 
I WANT TO BRING IN WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE 
HEARD FROM SARAH SANDERS? 
>> CERTAINLY SARAH SANDERS WAS 
PREPARED. 
SHE KNEW WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT 
A OF THE BRIEFING. 
AND REGARDLESS OF HOW REPORTERS 
ASKED HER ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN 
AND PAUL MANAFORT. 
THE ANSWER WAS THE SAME. 
THE PRESIDENT DID NOTHING WRONG 
AND THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. 
WHEN WE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS 
ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN, AND THAT 
IS NOT PART OF THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION, WE 
WERE ASKING ABOUT THE EXCHANGE 
OF MONEY, THE LINE WAS THERE 
WAS NO COLLUSION. 
AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT SARAH 
SANDERS WAS PROGRAMMED AND 
READY TO DELIVER THAT ANSWER 
WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY REAL 
ANSWERS DESPITE THESE TWO 
MASSIVE LEGAL BOMBSHELLS THAT 
JUST EXPLODED YESTERDAY. 
>> IS THERE A WAY TO GAUGE HOW 
CONCERNED THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
PARTICULARLY THE PRESIDENT IS 
ABOUT WHAT MICHAEL COHEN COULD 
TELL THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. 
>> NOT IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE 
SANDERS, ALONG WITH OTHER 
OFFICIALS, THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF, HAVE INDICATED THEY 
BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL COHEN IS 
NOT A CREDIBLE WITNESS. 
THEY DON'T BELIEVE HE HAS 
ANYTHING TO OFFER 
INVESTIGATORS. 
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO PAINT HIM 
AS A LIAR. 
THEY ARE NOT EXPRESSING ANY 
CONCERN. 
IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THE 
PRESIDENT'S LANGUAGE WHEN IT 
COMES TO BOTH MEN. 
PAINTING PAUL MANAFORT AS A 
VICTIM. 
HE WAS BADLY TREATED AND THIS 
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. 
AND BRINGING UP THE FACT THIS 
WAS A 12-YEAR-OLD TAX CASE. 
I WANTED TO ASK HER ABOUT WHY 
THE AGE OF A CRIME MATTERS IF 
IT'S COVERED BY THE STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS WITH THIS 
PRESIDENT. 
IN TERMS OF HOW CONCERNED HE 
IS, CERTAINLY IN THIS ROOM, 
SARAH SANDERS' MESSAGE IS THAT 
HE IS NOT CONCERNED. 
HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG. 
>> IT WAS ALSO INTERESTING 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS HE 
LEARNED ABOUT THE PAYMENTS 
AFTER THE FACT EVEN THOUGH 
THERE'S TAPED RECORDINGS 
TALKING ABOUT IT. 
>> THIS ADDS TO THE SAGA OF 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT KNEW WHAT 
ABOUT THOSE PAYMENTS. 
THE BIG HEADLINE TODAY FROM HIM 
IS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN 
THE PAYMENTS WERE MADE. 
THE MONEY DID NOT COME FROM 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE. 
IT CAME FROM HIM. 
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER. 
THAT'S NOT TRUE, RIGHT? 
THERE'S NO CLEAR DISTINCTION OR 
WAY TO DETERMINE WHERE THE 
MONEY CAME FROM WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF AS A PUBLIC 
CITIZEN FUNNELED SO MUCH MONEY 
INTO HIS OWN CAMPAIGN. 
AND IN TERMS OF WHAT MATTERS 
HERE, IT'S WHAT COHEN HAS NOW 
POLICE DEPARTMENT GUILTY TO AND 
HE BROUGHT THE PRESIDENT INTO 
THOSE ACTIONS SAYING IT WAS THE 
RESULT OF THE DIRECTION OF THE 
PRESIDENT. 
AND THEY ACTED IN COORDINATION. 
AND SO SARAH SANDERS AGAIN SAID 
SHE WOULD REFER THOSE QUESTION 
TO THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL WITHOUT 
PROVIDING ANSWERS ABOUT THE 
TIMELINE THAT CONTINUES TO 
CHANGE ABOUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT 
KNEW WHAT IN REGARD TO THE 
PAYMENTS. 
HE SAID ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE HE 
DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 
PAYMENTS. 
LATER ON HE ACKNOWLEDGED 
REIMBURSING COHEN FOR THE 
PAYMENTS. 
AND SO EVEN THOUGH THAT 
DISCREPANCY WAS BROUGHT UP 
AGAIN TODAY, SANDERS SAID MANY 
TIMES THAT THE PRESIDENT DID 
NOT LIE. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
SUPREME COURT NEWS. 
WE KNOW DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING 
HARD TO SAY THAT IF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS CONSIDERED A 
COCONSPIRATOR, HE SHOULDN'T BE 
ALLOWED TO PICK FOR THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE? 
>> THE WHITE HOUSE BRUSHED IT 
OFF. 
YOU HEARD SARAH SANDERS SAYING 
THIS IS A PATHETIC ATTEMPT ON 
THE PART OF DEMOCRATS TO 
TAKEAWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 
NOMINEE. 
BUT THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS 
DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE. 
THEY RESULTED FROM WHAT 
HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND PAIRED 
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S HISTORY 
OF WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN IN 
ACADEMIC ARTICLES AND WHAT HE 
HAS SAID PUBLICLY ABOUT WHAT HE 
BELIEVES THE PRESIDENT HAS TO 
DO WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT 
PRESIDENTS OUGHT TO ALWAYS BE 
PART OF THOSE BECAUSE THEY 
MIGHT BE A DISTRACTION TO THE 
PRESIDEN. 
AND THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS ARE 
CONCERNED AND WHY THEY'RE 
BRINGING THIS UP RIGHT NOW THAT 
THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT A 
POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT JUDGE 
DOES NOT BELIEVE EVEN IF A 
PRESIDENT IS SUBPOENAED HE HAS 
TO ANSWER TO THAT. 
AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT 
REACTING TO THAT STRONGLY, 
SAYING THIS IS JUST ANOTHER 
GAME THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
PLAYING TRYING TO BLOCK THE 
NOMINEE. 
>> AND SEPTEMBER 4th HEARINGS 
ON THE BOOKS. 
WEIJIA JIANG, THANK YOU FOR 
JOINING US. 
>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE HAVE A LOT MORE NEWS AHEAD. 
THIS IS CBSN.
