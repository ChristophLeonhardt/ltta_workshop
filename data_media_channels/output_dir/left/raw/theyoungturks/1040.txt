00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,320
Before we jump into the next clip, I just wanna tell you real quick

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,800
We got a new audio network

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,320

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,320
and get all of our new podcasts.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,780
A new bombshell report in the Miami Herald details how a police chief in a small town, a small suburb

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,260
Biscayne Park

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,040
Is accused of telling his officers to arrest random black people in order to just boost stats.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,440
And this is from one of the officers in the report.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,180
Anthony de la Torre says they were told

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,140
And he's not the only officer

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,920
Four officers, which comes up to a third of the small force,

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,620
The police chief in question, Raimundo Atesiano,

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,740
denies all these allegations. He quit the force back in 2014.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,560
But I wanna tell you this.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,660
During his 2-year tenure, 29 of 30 burglary cases were solved

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,660
And the year after he left, the force didn't solve any. Not one.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,940
The year after he left.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,660
Because right-wingers are not that bright, I have to explain that

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,680
'Cause they're gonna think, "Oh you see that, it lead to more crime."

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,340
No! They hadn't solved any of the cases in the past. They were just pinning it on the wrong guys.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,100
All these cops are saying it.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,340
"Oh yeah, we're just arresting random black guys"

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,120
So when they stop doing that, it turns out they weren't solving any of the cases!

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,000
It also means there is a good possibility that any competent defense attorney

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,660
is gonna get every single person who was convicted during that time - off. Right?

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,340
And some of them did do it.

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,460
And some of them will have done it.

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,460
You'll then inevitably put some legitimate bad guys back on the street

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,120
because you guys are so friggin' incompetent and racist.

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,140
This police chief in question is actually in trouble with the feds.

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,400
for one specific case. They've only got one going right now.

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,700
But he's charged with framing a black teenager - a 16-year-old, I think.

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,460
for four different burglaries, even though federal prosecutors say they knew there was no evidence

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,620
to support any of these charges.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,680
Whatever the maximum sentence is for four different burglaries

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,479
that's how long Chief - I don't remember his name already -  belongs in prison.

37
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,199
Atesiano

38
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,500
That's how long Chief Atesiano - but he deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.

39
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,140
Yeah, it's stunning to me how little they care about other people.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,420
Like, you're gonna put them in prison, you're gonna take away their liberty,

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,100
even though you know they didn't do it. Why?

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,480
'Cause it's gonna improve your career by this much.

43
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,640
You get to brag about how good you are at solving crime when you know you're not solving crime.

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,080
And think about that too, guys.

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,900
Not only are they putting away these people and taking away their freedom, ok?

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,720
But at the same time,

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,220
people get to do burglaries nonstop in that town

48
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,060
'cause you're not actually doing the police thing.

49
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,760
So people keep getting victimized, and then you have people who didn't commit the crime going to prison,

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,900
for, again, a crime they didn't commit.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,640
And, look, remember, he specifically said to single out black people in the community.

52
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,100
So please spare me the arguments about how there's no institutional racism in the country

53
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,300
because this is a perfect example of it.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,960
This was burglary. You think sometime in the last 30, to 40, to 50 years in this country, that's happened for murder?

55
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,880
and that maybe we have a couple of black guys - let alone white guys - on death row who didn't do it?

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,820
If you think that, you're out of your freakin' mind.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,320
Twenty of them get out every year.

58
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
That's right.

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,880
Yeah, and so guys, if it didn't happen to you, doesn't mean that it doesn't happen.

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,540
So yes, unfortunately for a lot of African-Americans, this is their experience.

61
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,520
This is what they've lived in so many different areas for so long.

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,960
So, it doesn't mean you did it

63
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,180
This guy did it. He did it 'cause he's lazy

64
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,240
and he did it because he's a bad guy.

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,940
But it happens to a lot of black people in this country

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,320
So just recognize this so we can all fix it together.

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,020
