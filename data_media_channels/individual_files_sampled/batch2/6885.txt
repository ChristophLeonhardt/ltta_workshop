a GOP candidate for California's 44th district wanted to make a statement about transgender individuals using the bathrooms that they identify with the candidates name is Jasmine Saavedra and she was at a Denny's restaurant apparently she needed to use the restroom and she was informed that the person using the stall was a transgender woman well she thought it would be a great idea to take her phone out and start filming a Facebook live video while she is simultaneously harassing this person as she uses the restroom take a look at the video the lady to you the restaurant Joe a man in my privacy because I'm a mother you violated my right sing that stupid sick so she's claiming that her rights are violated as she is harassing a person while that person is using the bathroom I can't believe she's never seen a man in the woman's restroom before if she believes this person is a man well well one other thing I want to mention is the argument that the that you hear from conservatives is that if you allow transgender people to use the bathroom that they identify with well that will create unsafe situations but the only person who's harassing anyone or causing an unsafe situation is this congressional candidate in California right you're harassing someone as they're using the bathroom that person is simply using the bathroom and you were going out of your way to harass them I said you know Anna I read the story and then I forgot she was a congressional candidate I mean that's insane if you're just a normal person she is a self-proclaimed Latina spokeswoman for president Trump now his self proclaimed okay and she's a candidate in the 44th District in California among the Republicans running there okay so now look and by the way the to be fair anyone can run okay but there's anyone who's a Republican look at that video you know and I know the answer to this but but I'm trying to find the ones that are not that looks at that video and goes yeah I'm proud that's me that's yes way to go you should go into a bathroom with a video camera and you should harass people like that and I'm so proud of her and if you're in that camp like just just like do some self-evaluation for a second are you sure you're the good guy are you positive about that the ones stalking people in the bathrooms and the one saying that person's identity bothers me so much that I'm gonna just try to humiliate them publicly what a sad sick person you are so look it's one thing to have conservative views about the transgender community and keep those views to yourself you know it's another thing to take this kind of action it's so hideous and and so incredibly cruel I mean when you look at the statistics and you look at the suicide rate among transgender people because of the way that they're disenfranchised the way they're discriminated against the way that they're constantly being attacked and then you see videos like that I mean this woman is so incredibly ignorant and she thinks this is a good idea yeah I'm gonna kill this I imagine she's trying to make a name for herself but before the primary but I imagine she was a fringe candidate trying to sort of create a viral moment for her so that people pay attention and perhaps that'll happen I'm curious if we know what the Denny's guy was there was a Denny's employee maybe hopefully it was a Denny's employee in the bathroom not not the one in the stall but in the video yes see a man in there it was an employee and he was but he was knocking on the door was he saying they get do we know if he was telling the story there it wasn't the transgender persons but they found supposing this is Danny statement they found drugs on the floor and so the Denny's employee went in there to take care of that no but that had nothing to do with the transgender woman okay in the in the bathroom stall yeah and and so to Ben's point unfortunately and we're also guilty of this we were talking about this when Alison Hartson was here on election night last Tuesday and so she's running against Dianne Feinstein in in California for the Senate seat and what is the who's a one candidate in that race that the media has covered the most and and I've covered him too it's a guy named Patrick little who's a Nazi and he says he wants to drive the Jews out of the country and and he's doing robo calls about how Feinstein is Jewish and needs to be driven out etc you have a man now all right so and by the way in one of the polls he was at 18% so all of a sudden fringe candidates that are poll and he would come in second and he would go to the general election if that polls accurate I hope to god that it's not but Blankenship with the China well these guys the deportation buses in Georgia this lady going into the bathroom anymore and so why because we acts I hope accidentally not on purpose incentivize bad behavior and because if you're crazy we cover you if you're a great candidate who's gonna help the people of your state you don't get any coverage and so this is the result of that right Allison has the audacity to have spent the last couple of years working to get money out of politics and she was a schoolteacher that's that's not viral yeah but I don't know what what we're supposed to do because look on one hand we do cover those candidates yeah you have an entire show dedicated to covering those candidates which is rebel headquarters they're progressive candidates yeah the progressive candidates yes not the candidate that we were talking about in this story but at the same time you have these lunatics running around victimizing people and then what do we do we just sit back and let it happen do we not call them out do we not provide a voice for the powerless because that's the issue here like for me that that woman being harassed like that she has no power at all okay and who's gonna speak out for her who's gonna try to defend her and that's true because that woman left and this little lady she stayed in her she's having moons over my hammy right and so the so like that gets the question of like what you what do you do with this woman whose name we'll leave out and and Erin schlossberg whose name's already out there the guy in Miami who now we have back again your guy New York Jimmy who said I got the manners had three videoed incidents of confronting people which suggests that maybe there were a few that were not caught on to yeah um so serial racist he's a serial so he has you know he's lost he's been kicked out of his office he's had his I don't know if his home address got out there but his certainly his office did and he's getting hammered on Yelp he's lost business and there are some people good people I've seen on Twitter really good decent people were like I'm not comfortable with that part of this story I don't do that you you you you also are not comfy yeah no no look if you say hey the offices may be slightly different but don't go to people's homes don't don't do that they said that mariachi band to slash Berg's office that's funny that's okay all right fine that's kind of but don't think Brian Kemp would do yeah but don't stalk people like this woman it is the bothering the poor trans person there is is a lunatic and don't go to our home don't give a we got to fight back with ideas and in Anna's right and we have to say don't do that that's terrible think about how awful you're banging that person she's an actual human being okay for God's sake be decent for a second and but don't go and stalk them and go to their houses because then by the way not only is it immoral but it also allows them to play the victim don't do that okay it's a yeah I I'm with you I'm with you hundred percent I knew that would happen to Aaron and as soon as his name got out there and I thought oh this is gonna be be ugly but to Anna's point when you put it like that it's a really you know like she'll have immunity she gets to sort of victimize the powerless and gets to do it and you'll get to do it again sometime a weird part of that about that video is all the people eating at Denny's no one really reacted to it yeah if you watch the full video and you know you have this candidate yelling and filming this video with a selfie stick well to be fair they were having moons over my hammy let it get cold yeah and I will say one last thing about this and by the way luckily in coffee bean and some of the other places across the country they have not been reacting that way they've been saying stop it don't do that to another person in the store in this case this Republican lady says this is unbelievable well that part is true and says only in California this happens exactly you know so if you ever say anything bad about Alabama or Mississippi the Republicans need a safe space and they get triggered etc right well you're in California running for office in California if you don't like California there's a super easy thing you can self-deport okay you can just leave you can go to Alabama oh my god you might find a lot of Republicans that agree with you although apparently not as many anymore is there Jose one okay but so why are you here why are you here I'm telling you please please leave she's just having a tough time assimilating to California culture right because that's what you hear from right-wingers that's right right you simile and in California it's not a secret it's an incredibly liberal state and if you don't like protections for transgender people then don't live in a blue state like health and I justice just another door solution sure great Dan Patrick's listening yes thanks lieutenant governor um why don't we just make all the bathrooms like unisex yeah yeah I mean California yeah I never thought about it that way they are quite unisex right you go to bathroom somebody's house oh that's the male bath yeah two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then
