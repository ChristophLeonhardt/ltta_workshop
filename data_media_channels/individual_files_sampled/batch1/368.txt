in Iran there is a saying carpet Weaver's sacrificed their eyes for people's feet making even the smallest carpet means patiently toiling for months using tools and techniques that have been passed down for generations this is what my parents did my grandparents were doing so I learned from them and now I'm in this career I love this art but I'm not weaving I feel as if I'm sick the carpet is just like a child to me I love it because this is an original Persian art form the women in this workshop our artists employees they take classes to learn the basics and practice for months the best students get to work on the most intricate designs but there is something sad about this job the closer these women get to completing a carpet the less able they are to actually afford one of their own creations Persian rugs sell for thousands of dollars and some of the carpets made in this very workshop sold for tens of thousands and depending on the detail and materials used such as silk or even string spun from gold a Persian rug can sell for millions it's no wonder then that in the business world carpets are a valuable Iranian export second only to oil but they're also an important part of Iran's cultural identity in the 2011 Farsi language film gold and copper a dying woman weaves carpets to pay for medicine and keep her family together the scriptwriter says the Persian carpet was the engine driving the story Iranian and global audiences recognized the Iranian carpet as a piece of art it has been a little painful for me that the price of the Iranian carpets has risen a lot and now it's unaffordable to everyone in the past it was common for people to cover every corner of their houses in carpet an especially sad irony for carpet dealers is that the United States is their largest markets America has put sanctions on Iran Ian's carpets but if you look at American buildings and family homes you see Iranian carpets on the floor as I saw in a video I think even US President Donald Trump's daughter has an Iranian carpet in her room traditionally Persian carpets are meant to portray the gardens of heaven Iranian say the latest sanctions are an attack on the very fabric of Iranian identity and an attempt by America to make trouble in paradise Zane Baz Ravi al-jazeera carriage
