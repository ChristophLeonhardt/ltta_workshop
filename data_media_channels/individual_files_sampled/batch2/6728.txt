THE ATLANTIC HAS UNEARTHED SOME EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT DONALD TRUMP, JR. WAS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH WIKILEAKS DURING THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. NOW, THERE ARE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT MAKE THIS STORY RELEVANT ESPECIALLY PERTAINING TO SOME OF THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING IN REGARD TO RUSSIA AND POTENTIAL RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THIS PAST ELECTION. BEFORE WE GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THE DIRECT MESSAGES THEY SHARED WITH ONE ANOTHER, THERE IS SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE LEAKED INFORMATION OBTAINED BY WIKILEAKS WAS GIVEN TO THEM BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. NOW, THAT IS BASED ON ANALYSIS BY U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, BUT THERE ARE SKEPTICS WHEN IT COMES TO THAT PORTION OF THE STORY. WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO GIVE YOU GUYS WHAT THEIR COMMUNICATION WAS, AND WHAT KIND OF ACTIONS THEY TOOK, MEANING MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AFTER THEY WERE GIVEN CERTAIN LINKS AND CERTAIN INFORMATION FROM WIKILEAKS. BEFORE YOU GET STARTED LET ME JUST CLARIFY THAT I'M AMONG THE SKEPTICS. INCLUDING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS STORY. ALL OVER TV AND ALL OVER THE MEDIA, ANA WILL GIVE YOU THE DETAILS, LET'S GIVE YOU THE FACTS FIRST, AND DISCUSS WHETHER IT IS GROUNDBREAKING COLLUSION OR NOT. FIRST, HOW DO WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE? WELL THEY WERE TURNED OVER TO CONGRESS BY DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND HIS LAWYER, THEY ARE COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATION, SO CREDIT WHERE IT IS DUE, BUT THAT'S WHERE THIS INFORMATION IS FROM, AND THE ATLANTIC OBTAINED THIS INFORMATION AND REPORTED ON IT LATE YESTERDAY. HERE IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN THE FIRST MESSAGE SENT TO DONALD TRUMP, JR. WAS SEPTEMBER 20 OF 2016, AND IN THAT MESSAGE SOMEONE FROM WIKILEAKS, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO, ESSENTIALLY LET DONALD TRUMP, JR. KNOW ABOUT AN ANTI-TRUMP WEBSITE, AND SOMEHOW THEY MANAGED TO GET THE PASSWORD TO THAT WEBSITE AND TOLD DONALD TRUMP, JR., YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO WHO IS BEHIND THIS WEBSITE. DONALD TRUMP, JR. RESPONDED TO THAT AND SAID I WILL ASK AROUND, AND HE DID ASK AROUND. SO HE NOTIFIED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFILIATED WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING THE SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER, A NUMBER OF CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS, AND THROUGH THAT THEY FORWARDED THE INFORMATION TO ONE ANOTHER, KELLYANNE CONWAY, STEVE BANNON, AND ALSO JARED KUSHNER, AS I MENTIONED. I THINK THERE IS ONE RELEVANT REVELATION, THIS ONE I THINK IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. THERE WAS A WEBSITE, WE TOLD YOU ABOUT IT AND YOU LOOKED INTO IT. WHOOPDIE DOO. HE COULD HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE WEBSITE IN 1000 DIFFERENT WAYS. THE NEW YORK TIMES COULD HAVE TOLD HIM THERE WAS A WEBSITE, AND I LOOKED INTO IT. AND? SINCE CENK PREFACED EVERYTHING WITH HIS OVERALL TAKE, I WILL GIVE YOU MINE, I DISAGREE WITH CENK IN REGARD TO THIS NOT BEING A BIG DEAL. THAT PORTION OF WHAT WE KNOW I DON'T THINK IS A BIG DEAL, BUT AS WE GET DEEPER INTO THE COMMUNICATION THEY HAD I THINK IT BECOMES MORE SIGNIFICANT AND RELEVANT, NOT NECESSARILY IN REGARD TO POTENTIAL RUSSIAN MEDDLING, BUT FOR ME IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER OR NOT WIKILEAKS HAS A POLITICAL MOTIVE, AND I THINK THESE COMMUNICATIONS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A POLITICAL MOTIVE TO HELP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. SO LET ME GO ON THAT'S FINE, THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE REPORT SO THEY ARE SETTING THE STAGE TO SHOW THAT ALREADY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WAS A POLITICAL MOTIVE, AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRIVATE MESSAGES THAT DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND WIKILEAKS HAD WITH ONE ANOTHER IT FURTHER REINFORCES THAT NOTION. GO AHEAD I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I THINK WIKILEAKS WAS ON TRUMP'S SIDE, AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY PUBLISHED SOME OF THE EMAILS RIGHT AFTER THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPES IS DECENT EVIDENCE OF THAT, AND THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE OF IT, INCLUDING ONE DAMNING PART WE WILL GET TO IN A SECOND. SO I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHO IS TALKING ABOUT THE STOLEN HOLLYWOOD EXCESS TAPES? AND WHERE THE WASHINGTON POST GOT THEM? AND WHO WANTED TO INTERFERE WITH OUR ELECTIONS, AND GAVE THOSE STOLEN TAPES TO THE WASHINGTON POST? I DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER A QUESTION THAT A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OBTAINED THOSE TAPES AND LEAKS THEM IN AN EFFORT TO MEDDLE IN THE ELECTIONS, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE THERE. LOOK AT THE FRAMING, THE EMAILS ARE ALWAYS REFERRED TO AS STOLEN, THE PENTAGON PAPERS AREN'T BUT YOU CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT, THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPES ARE NEVER REFERRED TO AS STOLEN BY THE MEDIA, BUT WHERE DID THEY GET THEM? AND WHO GOT THEM? DID THEY HAVE PERMISSION FROM WHOEVER THE OWNER OF ACCESS HOLLYWOOD IS? NO, THEY TOOK THEM WITHOUT PERMISSION, THERE'S ANOTHER WORD FOR THAT, STOLEN. IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WANT TO FRAME IT. IF YOU GIVE IT TO THE WASHINGTON POST, THAT'S AWESOME, THEY ARE A MEDIA ORGANIZATION, IF YOU GIVE IT TO WIKILEAKS WE DON'T LIKE THEM, THEY ARE MEAN, THEY ARE THE BAD GUYS. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY MAINSTREAM MEDIA BIAS AGAINST WIKILEAKS, I THINK THAT'S WELL KNOWN. BUT I WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON WHAT WIKILEAKS IS TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHEN THEY ARE MESSAGING DONALD TRUMP, JR., BECAUSE THEY ARE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS ARE. SO REGARDLESS OF MEDIA BIAS, MEDIA BIAS DOES NOT PLAY A ROLE IN THESE DIRECT MEDICATIONS, KEEP THAT IN MIND. SO DONALD TRUMP, JR. DID RESPOND TO THAT, HE SAID LOOK, I CAN'T STAND THE TRUMPS, I WORKED SUPER HARD TO MAKE SURE THEY DIDN'T WIN. I AM VERY CLEAR WITH MY PERSPECTIVE. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH WHAT DONALD TRUMP, JR. SAID THERE. IN FACT, IT'S ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS THAT THE REST OF THE PRESS GAVE HILLARY CLINTON A PASS FOR WANTING TO MURDER WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED, I THINK SOMEWHAT CORRECTLY AN ACCURATELY SO BY ANA AS SHE POINTED OUT EARLIER, A POLITICAL OPPONENT. EVEN IF YOU GRANT WIKILEAKS IS AN OPPONENT OF HERS, SHE WANTED TO MURDER A POLITICAL OPPONENT. IF TRUMP HAD SET AT THE WORLD WOULD HAVE EXPLODED AND YOU KNOW IT. SHE SAID IT, I DON'T KNOW, WAS SHE JOKING? IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE SHE WAS. AND EVEN IF TRUMP WAS JOKING IF HE SAID THAT, IT WOULD'VE BEEN NEWS 24/7, AND IT SHOULD BE, BECAUSE TRUMP IS ABHORRENT AND YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT. WHAT I'M ANNOYED WITH IS WHENEVER ESTABLISHMENT PUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS SAY THINGS LIKE THAT THEY GET A PASS. HERE IS MY ISSUE WITH THIS, THE CONNECTION WITH RUSSIA ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH FOR ME, MEANING THAT OKAY, OR INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS SAY RUSSIA STOLE OR HACKED INTO THESE EMAILS, I'M NOT PERSONALLY CONVINCED BY THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T REALLY SHARED THAT EVIDENCE WITH US YET, JUST SAYING THAT THEY BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. BUT THAT BEING SAID, FOR ME WHAT THIS STORY COMMUNICATED WAS WIKILEAKS IS NOT SOME JOURNALISTIC ORGANIZATION, AND BY THE WAY I WAS SUPPORTIVE OF WIKILEAKS EVEN AFTER ALL OF THIS HILLARY CLINTON STUFF CAME OUT, BECAUSE MY VIEW OF THEM WAS THEY OBTAIN DAMNING EVIDENCE THAT SPEAKS TRUTH TO POWER AND THEY LEAK IT. TO SAY THAT THERE ARE NEVER ANY POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS OR BIASES IS NAÅ“VE, BUT I DID NOT HAVE PROOF OF HOW DEEP THE BIAS WAS DURING THIS PAST ELECTION, AND I THINK THAT IS RELEVANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AT AN ORGANIZATION LIKE WIKILEAKS THINKING THIS IS A CREDIBLE ORGANIZATION WITH NO POLITICAL BIAS. CLEARLY THEY DID, AND THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO PROVE IT, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO YET. HOLD ON, I AGREE AND DISAGREE IN PARTS. THE PART I AGREE WITH, EVEN MIKE POMPEO, TRUMP'S CIA DIRECTOR, SAYS HE THINK THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE KEY LEAKS AND RUSSIA. TAKE THAT FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH, IT'S A DATA POINT AND I DO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. AT THE SAME TIME, ALMOST EVERYBODY THAT WORKS IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, BOTH ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, HATE WIKILEAKS WITH A PASSION, SO I WILL TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THEY ARE CREDIBLE JOURNALISTS, THAT'S WHERE I DISAGREE WITH YOU. YES, I THINK THIS STORY DOES PROVE THAT THEY WERE CLEARLY ON TRUMP'S SIDE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T BE CREDIBLE, IT DOESN'T MEAN THE STUFF THEY LEAKED ISN'T TRUE. IT WAS TRUE. AND THEY ARE STILL A MEDIA ORGANIZATION. BUT THERE IS ALSO THE QUESTION OF WHAT THEY REFUSED TO LEAK OR TALK ABOUT, LIKE THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS THAT WERE IMPLICATED IN THE PANAMA PAPERS AND HOW WIKILEAKS REFUSED TO DO ANY TYPE OF WORK ON THAT ISSUE. SO I THINK THAT THIS COMMUNICATION, THEIR CLEAR SUPPORT OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THEY REFUSED TO LEAK, DRAWS A PICTURE THAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THEIR CREDIBILITY. SO I'M PUTTING THAT OUT THERE. I UNDERSTAND, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT THAT'S FINE, I WILL GO EVEN FURTHER AND SAY THEY HURT THEIR CREDIBILITY MORE WHEN THEY AREN'T HONEST ABOUT THEIR PERSPECTIVE. FOX NEWS, THAT'S FINE, THEY ARE CONSERVATIVES, WE DON'T LIKE THEM AND I THINK THEY ARE WRONG ON EACH ISSUE AND WE DEBATE THEM, THE PROBLEM ISN'T THAT, THE PROBLEM IS THEY CALL THEMSELVES FAIR AND BALANCED, AND THEY AREN'T, THAT'S A JOKE AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT. SO I WOULD HOPE WIKILEAKS WON'T CONTINUE TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. WHATEVER YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS YOU SHOULD BE OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT IT, WE ARE HONEST ABOUT OUR PERSPECTIVE, AND I DON'T THINK GIVEN THIS STORY AMONG OTHERS, I AGREE WITH ANA THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN OPEN ABOUT WHAT THERE PERSPECTIVE IS. LET'S GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THEIR COMMUNICATION, AND ONE-POINT WIKILEAKS SENT TO DONALD TRUMP, JR. THEN IN THAT CASE, DOES IT SHOW THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS COMMUNICATING WITH WIKILEAKS? YES, OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T RANDOMLY DO IT 15 MINUTES LATER. BUT THIS STUFF WAS PUBLIC ANYWAY, AND HAVE JOURNALISTS SENT OUT THEIR ARTICLES TO THE PEOPLE THEY WROTE ABOUT IN HOPES THAT IT WOULD BE SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA? ALMOST EVERY TIME, EVERY DAY. SO IF ANY OTHER JOURNALISTS SAID HEY, HERE IS AN ARTICLE I WROTE ABOUT YOU OR ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE AND SENT IT TO YOU, IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST NO BIG DEAL OF ALL TIME. WHEN IT HAPPENS WITH WIKILEAKS, OH MY GOD, THEY WANTED THEIR LINK PUBLICIZED. OF COURSE THEY DID, SO DOES EVERYONE. I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE SURFACE. IF IT IS PROVEN THAT THEY DID NOT OBTAIN THEIR INFORMATION FROM RUSSIA, THEN YOU ARE RIGHT, WIKILEAKS SHOULDN'T BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER MEDIA ORGANIZATION. BUT THE CONCERN HERE IS THAT A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT IS MEDDLING IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS AND IF THAT'S PROVEN I THINK THESE TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE RELEVANT. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH DISTINCTION BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE IF RUSSIA SAYS I STOLE THESE EMAILS, TRUMP, WOULD YOU LIKE THEM? I THINK THAT'S A GIANT PROBLEM AND I TALKED ABOUT THAT IN THE PAST, THAT IS A REAL ISSUE, IT HAS LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS AND IT SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND I'M THRILLED THEY ARE INVESTIGATING IT. BUT RUSSIA OR ANYONE ELSE GETS ACCESS TO INFORMATION, PASSES IT ON TO SOMEONE IN THE MEDIA RUSSIA DIDN'T GET ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION, THEY HACKED AND STOLE THE INFORMATION. WHATEVER, DANIEL ELLSBERG STOLE THE PENTAGON PAPERS, HE GOT THEM WITHOUT PERMISSION AND GAVE THEM TO THE NEW YORK TIMES. ALMOST EVERY SINGLE WEEK IS WITHOUT PERMISSION GIVEN TO A MEMBER OF THE MEDIA AND WE NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT, YOU WOULD HAVE TO ARREST THREE QUARTERS OF WASHINGTON IF THEY WERE ALL STOLEN. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AMERICAN WHISTLEBLOWERS OR AMERICAN LEAKERS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT POSSIBLY HAVING AN IMPACT ON OUR ELECTION. THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT. IF CANADA SOMEHOW GOT SOME INFORMATION, AND IT WAS SUPER RELEVANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SHOULD THE NEW YORK TIMES PRINT IT? MY ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY. IF YOU DON'T AGREE AND YOU SAY CANADA, RUSSIA NEW YORK TIMES SHOULD SUPPRESS THE INFORMATION BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, EITHER ONE THAT IS FRIENDLY TO US LIKE CANADA OR ONE THAT ISN'T, LIKE RUSSIA OKAY, THOSE ARE FINE POINTS OF DISAGREEMENT, I SAY THEY SHOULD PUBLISH IT BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW, I THINK THERE WAS VALUABLE INFORMATION IN THOSE EMAILS, I DON'T THINK THE RUSSIANS SHOULD HAVE STOLEN IT OR THE TRUMP PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE WORKED WITH THE RUSSIANS, THOSE ARE LEGAL ISSUES, BUT WHEN YOU GIVE IT TO A MEDIA ORGANIZATION, THE MEDIA ORGANIZATION HAS EVERY RIGHT TO PRINT IT. LET'S MOVE ON TO, BY THE WAY, TWO DAYS AFTER THEY SHARED THAT LINK WITH DONALD TRUMP, JR. HE ALSO TWEETED IT OUT, AGAIN THE LINK PROVIDED TO HIM BY WIKILEAKS. MOVING FORWARD, LET'S GO TO GRAPHIC 23, THIS IS WHEN THINGS GET INTERESTING SO THAT IS HONESTLY IT RILED ME UP MORE THAN I EXPECTED IT TO, BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO LEAD TO COMPLETE CHAOS AND TURMOIL IN THE UNITED STATES, AND YOU ARE NOW PUSHING FOR THAT. AND YOU ARE NOW UNDERMINING AND QUESTIONING THE ELECTION PROCESS. AND BY THE WAY, RIGGING IS AN INTERESTING WORD IN THIS CONTEXT. THE DNC WAS DIRTY AS HELL, THERE'S NO DENYING THAT WHATSOEVER, WHAT THEY DID TO UNDERMINE BERNIE IN THE PRIMARIES WAS CLEAR AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WAS AWARE OF THAT SO I WAS FINE WITH THOSE LEAKS 100%. HOWEVER THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT VOTES WERE CHANGED OR THAT VOTING MACHINES WERE HACKED INTO OR THAT VOTES WERE TAMPERED WITH IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM TO ME THAT IS RIGGING. MANIPULATING AND RIGGING ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, AND JUST THIS CONSTANT NARRATIVE COMING OUT DURING THE ELECTION ABOUT RIGGING THERE WAS NO RIGGING, THERE'S NO PROOF OF RIGGING. MANIPULATION BY THE DNC IN ORDER TO UNDERMINE BERNIE SANDERS, ABSOLUTELY THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF THAT, BUT RIGGING? LET'S NOT GET SIDETRACKED BECAUSE NOW YOU WILL GET ME ON A WARPATH ON THAT. EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF RIGGING, PEOPLE KEEP ASSUMING THE OTHER PERSON HAS THE OTHER DEFINITION. FOR SOME PEOPLE IT MEANS THE DNC PICKED ONE SIDE AND HELP THAT SIDE. THAT DEFINITELY HAPPENED, DEFINITELY. THE DNC CHAIR ADMITTED IT. OTHER PEOPLE LEGITIMATELY THINK RIGGING, THAT WORD, MEANS ACTUALLY CHANGING VOTES. THERE, THERE IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH EVIDENCE, PEOPLE WILL SAY I GOT THIS SNAPSHOT NOBODY HAS EVER PROVEN THAT. I DON'T WANT TO GET SIDETRACKED ON THAT, AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY WHEN PEOPLE MAKE DECLARATIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT THE WORD RIGGING MEANS. ANYWAY, ON THIS ISSUE, THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNICATION WITH DONALD TRUMP, JR., IT IS DAMNING. WIKILEAKS, BY SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T CONCEDE THE ELECTION IF YOU LOSE AND YOU SHOULD CHALLENGE IT, NUMBER ONE IT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE A PERSPECTIVE, AND IT MIGHT BE FINE TO HAVE A PERSPECTIVE, BUT THEY WERE PRO TRUMP. NOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. AND BY THE WAY, YOU COULD SAY HEY, IF THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO IMPRISON YOU, DO GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE TO YOU, AND IN THE CASE OF HILLARY CLINTON MAYBE MURDER YOU, YOU MIGHT BE PRO TRUMP TOO. OKAY, BUT THEY WERE PRO TRUMP. THAT COMMUNICATION PROVES IT. AND BY THE WAY, IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A PERSPECTIVE, SO THEY WERE PRO TRUMP. BUT THEY SHOULD BE HONEST ABOUT IT, AND THEY ARE NOT. THE SECOND REASON THAT IS DAMNING IS, WAIT, WHY DO YOU CARE, THE ELECTION IS ALREADY OVER, THAT HE NOT CONCEDE? THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT A MESS AND YOU DON'T CARE IF HE WON THE ELECTION OR NOT. THEY DIDN'T SAY IF YOU THINK YOU WON YOU SHOULDN'T CONCEDE, THEY SAID YOU SHOULDN'T CONCEDE TO MATTER WHAT. WHICH TO ME SAYS GOD DAMMIT, DID YOU WORK WITH THE RUSSIANS? IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU GOT ACCESS TO EMAILS EITHER THROUGH THE RUSSIANS OR SOMEWHERE ELSE, IT'S THAT YOU ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THEM, BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS WANT TO CAUSE A MESS HERE. THAT IS NOW ABSOLUTELY PROVEN. THEY HAD THE TROLL FARMS, NOT ONLY DID THEY DO ALL THE STUFF DURING THE ELECTION, BUT THEY WOULD SET UP FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS THAT WERE SEEMINGLY LIBERAL AND SEEMINGLY CONSERVATIVE, THEY WOULD TRY TO GET US TO FIGHT AND RIP US APART. WHAT IS A GOOD WAY TO RIP US APART? DON'T CONCEDE THE ELECTION, SAY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED ON WHEN TO FIGHT ANYWAY. WHY IS WIKILEAKS SAYING THAT? IF YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS WONDERFUL AND YOU WANT HIM TO WIN THAT'S ONE THING, YOU WANT TO RIP THE COUNTRY APART? FOR WHAT REASON? I KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT TO RIP US APART BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY ON THE RECORD, AND ALL DIFFERENT WAYS HAVE BEEN PROVEN THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THAT. SO TO ME THAT PARTICULAR MESSAGE IS REALLY DAMNING FOR WIKILEAKS, AND IT'S A SHAME. BECAUSE THEY PUBLISH REALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION, AND I WISH THEY WOULD JUST DO THAT, AND AGAIN, I DON'T EVEN MIND IF THEY WENT AN EXTRA STEP AND HAD A PERSPECTIVE. BUT TO NOT BE HONEST ABOUT IT AND TO POTENTIALLY WORK WITH THE RUSSIANS TO TRY TO SPLIT US APART, DAMMIT, WHY DID YOU DO THAT? BY THE WAY THAT'S NOT CONCLUSIVE, BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE, AND DENYING THAT IT IS IMPORTANT IS RIDICULOUS. IT IS IMPORTANT. I ALSO WANT TO QUICKLY NOTE THAT THEY KEPT URGING TRUMP TO GIVE HIS TAX RETURNS TO WIKILEAKS SO THEY COULD ESSENTIALLY, I'M PARAPHRASING WHAT THEY SAID, BUT CONTROL THE MESSAGING AROUND HIS TAX RETURNS. BECAUSE WIKILEAKS WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD EVENTUALLY GET LEAKED ANYWAY AND IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WIKILEAKS HANDLED IT AS OPPOSED TO A MEDIA ORGANIZATION LIKE MSNBC OR THE NEW YORK TIMES. 90% OF THAT I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH. THEY ARE SAYING, GIVE US HER TAX RETURNS AND WE WILL PUBLISH THEM. EVERY MEDIA ORGANIZATION WOULD HAVE DONE LIKEWISE. MAYBE THEY WERE EVEN TRICKING TRUMP. JULIAN ASSANGE IS NOW ARGUING AFTER THE FACT, I WAS TRYING TO TRICK HIM INTO GIVING ME THE TAX RETURNS. TWO OTHER JOURNALISTS DO THAT? YES. THE ONLY ISSUE THERE IS THEY SAID SO WE CAN IMPROVE THE PERCEPTION OF OUR IMPARTIALITY AND WE WOULDN'T BE PERCEIVED AS COMING FROM A PRO TRUMP OR PRO-RUSSIA SOURCE. IF YOU ARE SAYING WE ARE ON YOUR SIDE BUT WE WANT TO APPEAR NOT TO BE ON YOUR SIDE, THAT'S A DISHONEST ACTOR. THAT'S A SHAME. THERE IS A LOT OF OTHER STUFF, BUT LET'S SHORTEN THIS A LITTLE BIT ONE OF THE FINAL MESSAGES THAT WAS SENT TO DONALD TRUMP, JR. BY THE WAY AT SOME POINT HE JUST STOPPED RESPONDING, AND AT THIS POINT HE HAD STOPPED THIS WAS LOOK, MY READ OF IT WAS IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO KIND OF LET ASSANGE OFF ON SOME OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR RAPE ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE LODGED AGAINST HIM, MAYBE THIS WAS A WAY TO GET OUT OF IT, I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY WANTED SOMETHING IN RETURN FOR WHAT THEY WERE DOING. ASSANGE WANTS TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THE PRISON HE'S BEEN PUT INTO BY THE WESTERN GOVERNMENTS, I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT. IS THIS A WACKY SCHEME TO DO THAT? YES, IT'S PARTICULARLY WACKY. AND THEY KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK, BUT IT'S ABOUT FRAMING. OKAY, YOU WORK WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOR YOUR OWN PURPOSES, AND I GET IT, BUT I WISH YOU HAD BEEN WAY MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT. THE WHOLE POINT OF WIKILEAKS IS TRANSPARENCY, AND I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH THEM NOT BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT THEIR MOTIVES AND WHO THEY SUPPORTED IN THE CAMPAIGN. HAVING SAID THAT, AS I'VE BEEN SAYING THROUGHOUT THIS PIECE, 8 OUT OF 10 OF THESE ALLEGATIONS THAT EVERYONE IS TREATING AS BOMBSHELLS, THE REST OF THE PRESS DOES ON A DAILY BASIS.
