everybody is sad when their side loses
an election but the day after we have to
remember that we're actually all on one
team this is an intramural scrimmage
we're not Democrats first we're not
Republicans first we are Americans first
we're Patriots first we all what want
what's best for this country that's what
I heard Mr Trump's remarks last night
that's what I heard when I spoke to him
directly and I was hardened by that
that's what the country needs a sense of
unity a sense of inclusion a respect for
our institutions our way of life rule of
law and a respect for each other I hope
that he maintains that spirit throughout
this transition and I certainly hope
that's how his presidency has a chance
to begin
