less than a couple of days after the tragic most recent school shooting in Florida the FBI finds itself being targeted after revealed today that it failed to follow up on calls warning the agency of the parkland shooter the agency said proper protocols were not followed in investigating him who authorities say has confessed now to stalking the high school's hallways cutting down students and teachers and we have a statement from the FBI director going in greater detail saying I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we received from the public it's up to all Americans to be vigilant and when members of the public contact us with concerns we must act properly and quickly and so let's talk about what actually happened law enforcement officials said calls to the tip line are handled at the FBI's call center in West Virginia they get about 2100 per day a caller did call in about this particular individual saying that crews had recently purchased firearms and had threatened a family member he added that the caller knew Cruz's address and said he had been posting disturbing messages on social media accounts and that he had a desire to kill which is a whole lot of information when you combine together that's really scary and now under established protocols the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life the information then should have been forwarded the FBI Miami field office or appropriate investigative steps would have been taken they did not do that and there will be consequences although we can hold off for a second if you want to respond to this initial information so look there's gonna be a political angle here in a second but in terms of what the FBI did wrong I'm gonna have a minority opinion here so it's very easy to say oh my god in the act why didn't they do something but it was a youtube comment look down below if you're watching on youtube tell me if you don't find a death threat in there or someone saying they're gonna kick someone's ass or kill them or come for them etc and if you don't find it on this video which will be nearly miraculous go find any other video oh that we do anyone does if we reported every person who sounded dangerous equal way same exact way I'm gonna be a shooter I'm gonna come get you guys with guns yada yada if we report each one to the FBI the FBI would do nothing else but track the people that are in our youtube comment section so it's a little Monday Morning Quarterback here I sometimes wear the threats are incredibly specific and repeated I feel like the FBI still feels overwhelmed and does not give a proper response that's my take on it but this was one guy in a youtube comment section I if an FBI chased every one of those down I'm like I said I don't think they'd do anything but that so I I agree with you and this to me may be just me but this reads as one of these the Republicans are getting ready to set up a straw man so they could avoid the real conversation and I think it's disheartening and I think it's excuse my language but this is the internet it's bullshit um because I grew up literally a janked about 20 miles from the school I've debated at this school and as I watched um on Wednesday night as they showed the aerial views I could remember myself being a sophomore in high school sitting in that courtyard and to watch these Republicans bob and weave and Bob and we even tried to find all these different reasons as to what went wrong here when the real thing that went wrong in this case and everybody knows it you talk to people in Parkland you see the interviews from these students you see the interviews on these parents here's what went wrong it's pretty simple America he was 18 years old he couldn't buy a beer he couldn't buy a pint of vodka he couldn't buy whiskey but he was able to buy a military grade weapon an ar-15 and multiple magazines and he was able to camouflage himself as a student walk into that school pull the fire alarm and then kill 17 innocent people the problem is not the FBI the problem is not oh we didn't get it soon enough the tips were bad the problem was is this man was armed with a military grade weapon and Republicans will continue to conjure up different Bible scriptures and they will talk about thoughts and prayers but thoughts and prayers does not bring back a 14 year old little girl who had the world ahead of her and the world in front of her to accomplish into a conquer and I think that is what's so upsetting and that's why these parents if you look at these these parents are like this is ridiculous and and and I gotta say this I think it's really time that every American wake up and there's there was a video done where now this went to when they started talking to other members of Congress what do you have to say what are you gonna do and they're like oh well I don't want to talk I don't want to talk because the NRA has a stranglehold on our elected leaders in the state houses and in Congress and everybody is so afraid of Wayne LaPierre and that bill building in Fairfax County that they're unwilling to protect our children and so now they're gonna blame this on Christopher ray and the FBI and they're gonna find some way to connect it back to Russia and connect it back to Comey so Trump could go back to his old narrative and once again we're missing the argument the argument is this we are 12 20 some are 30 some 60 some are days into the new year and we've had 18 school shootings our kids are not safe schools should be safe and welcoming places for children and this is not true why it's not true because too many people have guns and it's too easy to get you can get an ar-15 in Florida in about 38 minutes yeah period so I'm gonna go to graphic 30 here in a second but now let's talk about the the political part of this cuz then Rick Scott the governor of Florida and Marco Rubio both come out they say they're shocked and chagrined at the FBI and what we have yes so here I'll read you want to rick scott's quotes the FBI's failure to take action against the killer is unacceptable 17 innocent people are dead and enology a mistake isn't going to cut it we constantly promote see something say something and a courageous person did that just that to the FBI and the FBI failed to act see something they say something is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow-through from their law enforcement the FBI director needs to resign yeah so now let me explain the trifecta there for the poor Republicans and it might be even more than so number one great I get to deflect from guns it's not guns it's if you had just found that one YouTube comment and done something about it or this all would have been taken care of number two I wanted FBI director fired because he's allowing an investigation of Donald Trump perfect yes now what a what a gift to me I get to avoid talking about the real problem I get to get rid of was someone I perceived to be a political enemy so I could help the president obstruct justice and then number three is the constant reference to see something say something why look for people who aren't who are different than your own right and and that is mainly used it is incredibly ineffective so they have that program in the tri-state area up in New York New Jersey etc the overwhelming majority of the calls are totally useless and waste a tremendous amount of police time to chase after that guy looked Arab that guy looked dark that guy looked suspicious that student had a backpack it's a total waste of time right and but it allows the Republicans to deflect and get you to start questioning one another oh and it allows for demagoguing now by the way the guy it appears is a white nationalist and he was wearing a mag I had in one of the pictures and bragged about being a right winger so every time I see someone in a maggot should I say something every time I see a right-winger should I report it to the FBI a right winger with a gun okay let's be more specific right that's all right with okay great but can I report a hundred and twenty million people right how useless is see something say something so they hit a trifecta with it and the mistake that Christopher raid did in this case and Christopher raised a Republican yeah they're all over there lookin for God's sake and and I'm sure that if Christopher ray and I discuss policy we would disagree on what 80 90 percent of things right so I'm not a fan of Christopher rate I wouldn't have a pointed Christopher Ray but Christopher ray here did what an FBI director should do took accountability and I think he took too much accountability but that's okay good I liked it he he's my they represent us he's our FBI director I'm glad that he took accountability but in politics major mistake the Trump team and the Republicans never take accountability and they go what we denied it we strongly denied it yeah and the other side and decent honest people take accountability they go yeah let you see you admitted it that's it we got to fire you and that's what's happening here yeah when when saw that you know the FBI had not followed the protocol this morning at a production meeting we were like I felt like okay I I'm putting a tough position because obviously I want to talk about this because they theoretically could have stopped the guy now I think when you're getting literally thousands of tips every single day it is very difficult I mean sometimes there's other evidence like the fact that you've recently purchased a firearm something like that that can make it a little bit easier but it's still tough but I also knew that this would be used for the two-pronged distraction tactics that we've been talking about they want you to be focused solely on protecting the last possible shield against a mass shooting let's not actually talk about a the root causes the structure that makes it possible let's talk about you did they get their medication on that particular day did someone pursue a phone call let's not talk about the fact that they can literally reach out and grab a firearm because they're all around us and so it's distraction and then of course we were talking about the meeting they're going to use this to try to discredit the FBI I didn't know how specific and target it would be that they would literally call and in to step down that day but we knew it was coming and they wasted no time so just one more thing that I - to Richard's earlier point it's the guns it's the ar-15 s etcetera when you look at a scale of shoot mass shootings in the world compared to the number of guns we stand alone so we're in the upper right corner all by ourselves we have 270 million guns in the country and we have 90 mass shooters from 1966 to 2012 now that is a very very conservative count the reality is it is now especially since 2012 way higher okay now if you look at other countries they have a low amount of guns and they have a low amount of mass shooters and it's not close they're all huddled in the lower left corner we're in the upper right corner it's the guns stupid I think you're absolutely right and I think what makes this even more sad is that this is part this is all part of this sort of they love to play I think I might in my word of the day is straw man because you would hear them they when they go on about ms-13 and all these illegals are killing everybody Oh Kate Steinle and then you look at it majority of the mass shootings in this country are white supremacists right white supremacist white nationalist Trump supporters who go in and create absolute mass havoc and that's exactly what they did to parkland and and it's like for me it just hit way too close to home cuz you never like you know what had happened in Sandy Hook and I'm like this is awful this is really sad but you never think is gonna happen in your community and to know that this happened my mom called me she was like I'm so happy that you neither you or your brother are in public school anymore and I could vision my mother being one of those parents and then you ask yourself the question what what is it going to take for these members of Congress and for these elected leaders to say hold on we've got to get these guns out of these people's hands I mean and it's not I'm not a I'm one of those people my brother's a gun owner and my father's a gun owner I don't have a problem with guns I just have a problem with military-grade weapons in the United States of America where we're not at war
