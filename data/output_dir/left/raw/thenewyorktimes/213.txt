00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,480
Hi, I’m Joe Russo.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,070
And I’m Anthony Russo.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,400
And we are the directors of
“Avengers: Infinity War."

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,410
This scene takes
place about 20 minutes

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,930
into the film in Dr.
Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,540
And Tony Stark is looking
at the burner phone

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,290
that Steve Rogers gave to him,
trying to decide whether or not

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,170
he’s actually going to
contact Steve about what’s

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,440
occurring in the movie when
he is interrupted by a sound.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,390
"Say, Doc.

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,530
You wouldn’t happen to be
moving your hair, would you?"

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,170
"Not at the moment, no."

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,870
Part of the creative
appeal of this movie

14
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,570
was us bringing together
disparate characters

15
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,630
throughout the MCU and kind
of smashing them together

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,980
in a crisis situation.

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,920
The intention was to create
propulsive narrative, where

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,050
the plot is driven
by the villain,

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,150
and he keeps interrupting
the heroes because he’s

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,940
one step ahead of them.

21
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,620
This is one of those incidents.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,550
And this shot, you
know, part of what

23
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,027
we tried to bring to the MCU
as filmmakers on a tonal level

24
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,860
ever since our first
film, “Captain America,

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,060
Winter Soldier” is just a
grounding and a real world

26
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,530
patina over who these
people are to try

27
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,500
to bring out their humanity
a little more in contrast

28
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,760
to their powers.

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,060
And this shot here is in
that vein in the sense

30
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,010
that it’s a very long shot.

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,710
We stay in the perspective
of these characters

32
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,660
as they walk out into
Greenwich Village

33
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,240
and discover the scene
of chaos unfolding.

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,320
And we discover it as they
discover it, and the scope

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,211
of it as they discover it.

36
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:33,336
It’s a way to increase tension
as they walk down the sidewalk.

37
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,460
What are they going to see?

38
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,640
What is the audience
going to see?

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,490
And then here is
probably the most asked

40
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,710
about VFX shot in the
movie is the hair standing up

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,500
on Peter Parker’s arm.

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,870
We’ve been asked
hundreds of times

43
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,990
how we got Tom Holland’s
hair to stand up his arm.

44
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,680
And it was a very gentle blowing
on his ear actually did it.

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,980
[laughs] It’s a CG shot.

46
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,440
But this fulfilling the
promise of “Infinity War”

47
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,020
is that all of the characters
are working together

48
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,860
in this movie to try to stop
Thanos, including Stan Lee.

49
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,460
"What’s the matter with you kids?

50
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,730
You never seen a
spaceship before?"

51
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,690
While this is a
multi-perspective film,

52
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,230
Thanos is the glue that binds
all the characters together,

53
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,350
as we watch Peter Parker swing
off towards the incident in New

54
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:16,850
York.

55
00:02:16,850 --> 00:00:00,000
