howdy there I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report yeah we're in Canada you know maple syrup and hockey a you know it's all friendly here we love it Staci max remember the last time we were here and we were recorded here we made a big show about the fact that we had Sade at the Trump Hotel well some things have changed quite rapidly since we were here last and that is Toronto hotel dumps Trump's name so that hotel is no longer called the Trump Hotel that's called something else Doogie Lafleur hotel the rocket Rashard Hotel I don't know why you're making up those weird they use your famous hockey players from the Montreal Canadiens the Ken Dryden Hotel Toronto Maple Leaves when they're good too but the Canadians aren't you know how about the Don Cherry hotel now Don Cherry I know I said when I come to Canada I want to get him on our show mr. Saturday night hockey the best broadcaster in the history of hockey the guy who will I go to for inspiration when it comes to picking out my suits and my ties Don Cherry is really a fashion plate underrated and the global fashion scene well we were also talking about the fact that the Toronto house prices kept rising they were rising kind of faster than the parabolic move that Bitcoin did in November and December and they continued to rise since we were here two years ago and when we were driving in from the airport you could see just like the explosion of new buildings everywhere and more huge high towers and the crazy thing about the house prices here compared to say driving into San Francisco or New York City is or more importantly flying in is like there's hundreds of thousands of square miles empty around it like there's plenty of room for it to grow so why is like there's no constraint on how big it could get like there's no there's plenty of space to build plenty more buildings so the fact that prices were rising unlike say Hong Kong or Manhattan which are jam-packed onto a little island and that's all you can get in that island well this country is completely empty there's just a bunch of trees and froze Lakes some lakes there's nobody lives here maybe how many people live in Canada maybe 60 million total I don't know your 35 million people that's half the population of the United Kingdom live in this vast wilderness up in the next to Alaska there's nothing to do except snog and play hockey well here's a headline Canada home prices fall six percent and first quarter from a year ago first decline since 2009 new regulations also known as b20 require all borrowers to pass a stress test at an interest rate two percent higher than the qualifying rate early symptoms appear rather obvious national home sales slid for the month of March falling 23% year over a year and pushing the average sales price down 10% overall it is a bearish quarter for Canadian housing first quarter sales fell 16 percent year-over-year so their new regulations brought in that basically you have to earn say in Vancouver they give an example of two by the median price there you would need to earn a hundred and seventy-five thousand Canadian dollars per year to meet the new standards but that the Canadian regulators have imposed on the mortgage market where the average income there is 65,000 per household let me explain this in a way that the average Canadian can understand okay let's say Wayne Gretzky it was determined to be making too many goals in the NHL so it decided to make his hockey stick heavier than anyone elses hockey stick to try to stop him from scoring so many goals but of course Wayne Gretzky being the talented guy that is only used it to his advantage and end up screwing bar goals whatever okay do you understand that Canadian person they were saying that the markets forces cannot be reined in by the simple master nations of corrupt bankers and central bankers and politicians who don't know jack doodly-squat about the economy they only know about how to give themselves pay raises to create bureaucracy and create more government markets rule markets are saying uh-oh and now we're at an inflection point now it's you're down three to two it's the seventh game of the Stanley Cup and in walks Derek Sanderson oh I know the hockey fans out there will know what you're talking about there I know waiting Gretzky's name of course he was the greatest player of all Derek Sanderson the Turk as he was known Boston Bruins played during their Stanley Cup reign of championship along with the greatest hockey player to ever live greater than Wayne Gretzky I'm talking of course number four Bobby Orr the great Don Cherry back me up on this okay well so you know mortgage debts piles of mortgage debts on households government debt corporate debt continues to rise we talked about Christine Lagarde and the previous episode while the IMF you know they came out with their World Economic outlet we did refer to that recently but here's some of the data about how much debt there is now in the world since we were last year IMF sounds the alarm on global debt warns the United States stands out when looking at the big picture needless to say it's all about the US China and Japan these three countries alone accounted for half of the 164 trillion dollars in global debt and private sector debt and speaking again of China its debt surged from one point seven trillion dollars in 2001 to twenty five point five trillion and 2016 and was described by the IMF as the driving force behind the increase in global debts accounting for three quarters of the rise and private sector debt in the past decade think of those numbers and remember that we're just talking about the housing bubble in Toronto Vancouver Los Angeles New York a lot of it was driven by Chinese money but you're going into this against some mad debt accumulators 1.7 trillion in 2001 - 15 years later twenty five point five trillion so you're competing against that pile and this is what's causing all these housing bubbles as well so the way that these countries are fighting global inequalities is to give themselves financial Ebola and allowing debt to consume them until their bodies are eaten away by the disease that is over indebtedness and then when they're completely gone and they have deaded themselves out of existence the remaining countries will be like we bought gold china and russia are buying gold it's a fine goal we mined gold it's like the three little piggies right the piggy number one lives in a fiat currency house their houses blown away by the huffing and puffing at the big bad fiat wolf and then piggy number two you've got countries like India that are like one step in one step out sector household sector has all the gold there the government doesn't exactly and then the big bad fiat wolf huffed and puffed and the people the private sector survived but the government was blown away then you've got the countries like China and Russia that have said where our house is made out of 24 karat gold bullion and the big bad Fiat wolf huffed and puffed and it didn't blow their house away they also include a chart in the Zero Hedge coverage of that IMF story the world economic outlook of the United States stands out you can't really read this chart too well but you can see that the stand out there that's the United States there there were only one amongst advanced economies only in United States expect an increase in the debt to GDP ratio over the next five years so these are all of the European countries you know they love austerity and they've been imposing austerity upon themselves and welcoming it more and more it's those sort of end times of the hairshirt and spank spanking themselves on the back so flagellation you need a spanking yourself I think you're referring to leader hos wearing German they like to grab each other in Auto spanking wheels of spanking going down the promenade spanking each other on the bottom singing German drinking songs with the lederhosen let's move on to the next one because I talked about Trump at the top we said that Trump Tower is no longer here and what is this Trump there's a there used to be a trunk premium - that's why his name was on hotels across the world he at least his name out apparently that was a sign of some it used to be a sign of some sort of luxury he changed the name from the Trump Hotel to the Harvey Weinstein in right next to the Kevin Spacey restaurant and for some reason business is just not picking up well Trump's name is also mud in New York City Manhattan went 86.6% for Hillary Clinton so just over 10% of the Manhattan population even voted for Trump and there's some proof lately that even renting in anything named Trump is the rent prices are declining but now there's a basically Trump Tower prices are also collapsing we have this headline a new report claims Donald Trump's New York City properties have lost their luxury status the Trump Palace at 200 East 69th Street fared the worst with the lowest comparable prices when stacked up against the manhattan condo average coming in with 8% dip over the last decade so these are the prices for the Trump Palace 200 East 69th Street so the blue line is Trump Palace compared to other luxury condos so people no longer consider it luxury has probably from his thuggish tweets when people realize I guess they didn't know how he spoke I don't know kill two birds with one stone rebrand Trump properties as the White House the White House is a great brand Trump is in the White House if you want to stay in the White House like the Lincoln Bedroom or something like that you can stay at it what was formerly a Trump Hotel rebranded as the White House they've got the White House logo on the towels you got the White House soap you've got all the couch or mole of the White House but in various properties around the world and use part of the money to pay down America's debt so you're killing two birds with one stone you're rehabilitating the Trump brand and you're paying down America's debt well so basically what you're saying is now the u.s. stands out as debt to GDP ratio increasing you're saying we already have the emergence of a royal sort of family we have the Clintons we have the Bush's we have these royal sort of families remember Hillary Clinton was the wife of a former president Barbara Bush just died she was the wife of a president and the mother of a president so we already have these royal families and why do they you know whenever you're in London like we were for too many years what they always say so we love our royal family they bring in so much money because people tourists come to look at them so you're saying like why don't we start to make money off them like all these tacky hotels we could put those thousands and thousands of gifts that the president receives they're not allowed to personally keep it it's a product you know base luckily the taxpayer owns it but where is it like within some basement somewhere or the White House why don't you just put them in all these luxury condos right you know little tchotchkes in the hotel's replicas you can buy in the lobby and you know they have the fire recently in Trump Tower you can recreate that fire in properties all around the world that Trump properties and call like a re-enactment of the American Revolution it's like oh we're gonna burn down the ramparts we're gonna cause an insurrection let's set it on fire it could all be pre-programmed and just be like a Disney event at Disneyland where the fire bursts out on fly 439 and you because it's just part of your package of staying at the White House last Trump hotel but in order for the American people to buy into this and they want the debt to be paid down and their taxes not to rise is you could put it at the over head as you enter each building in the lobby you can have that American debt clock and then it also has a donation box like in the churches where like it helped fix up this building help pay down our national debt and have all those like junk presents that are were given to the president oh absolutely or when you walk through the portals of the hotel it puts you further into debt anyway we got to take a break we'll be back right after this don't go away welcome back to the car park I'm Max Keiser time now to speak with heart tez sunny of ha show doc I owe our - welcome thank you so much for having me max I'm honestly a huge fan oh that's fantastic you know we are seeing you at conferences around the world because you've got something that is in high demand ha show dot IO tell us about it it's a ho show itself means security in Japanese and we were looking for a short word that nailed exactly what our focus was which is cyber security within the blockchain space and we felt like we hadn't seen anyone in the industry be laser focused on just blockchain security especially one that's not doing their own ico of course people when they hear blockchain they hear Bitcoin one of the first things they hear about is that it's so secure tell us about that I mean what are people missing or what do you add to the equation so code that's written on a blockchain is referred to as business logic and business logic is very far from being secure and traditionally in the technology era when ever sophisticated code is written you always get a third party to audit it and the exact same methodology is now being implemented in the blockchain space that if you're writing code you need to have at least one professional third party do a technical audit of that code and then make sure that there's no hidden functionalities that you're not clogging up the blockchain by potentially using too much gas and that the actual written words of the source of truth are actually married to the business logic is the code doing what the words say they're supposed to do a lot of money's been pouring into crypto and blockchain and when this money comes in ideally they do an audit of the technology is there enough technology auditing going on with all this money and my question is is there more money out there now chasing projects that there is just a adequate amount of auditing your thoughts yeah there's not enough sophisticated auditing firms out there to handle all of the work in this space and we're seeing the Asian crypto markets boil and become extremely exciting there you're seeing millions of dollars fundraised in a much faster speed of time in Asia but none of them are valuing security the lowest numbers of security audits being done are by far in Asia and for an investor to cut a check into a project and not make sure that this smart contracts been audited at least once and to review the actual audit report I think it's bizarre and there's not enough firms willing to even audit non aetherium based projects so in theory 'm has been the main protocol in which most ICS have been launched on their launching what's called an ER c20 token on top of the etherion protocol and that's been the majority of icos to date now we're starting to see people start to develop smart contracts on the newer protocols that are coming we see some interest in stellar neo and soon maybe EOS but the current firms like consensus that have been doing smart contract auditing seem to be much more laser focus on just aetherium you know people when they hear the word auditing they think about auditing firms like Price Waterhouse Cooper and these big auditing firms so is whole show dot IO C are you the kind of the PwC of blockchain is that how you position yourself correct yeah we're looking to evolve and to becoming the Deloitte or Bane or McKinsey or PwC who will it of this space right and how long is it company been around it's been a little less than a year okay so this is a startup startup first year startup and what's the headcount we're at twenty four full-time in Las Vegas and about 11 contractors we are hiring rapidly about 30 more people onboarding looking to open up our first office outside of the US hopefully looking to as you do global business you realize time zones now matter a lot and so when I've been in Europe I've been realizing well Europe is pretty interesting to do business in both Asia and North America and so we're exploring where to go we're growing steadily month-over-month are definitely a startup pace remember during the Y Combinator time Paula Graham used to say that during Y Combinator or startup grows at average 7% week over week we've we've been right around there actually as a tech startup growing at a rapid pace week over week ever since we started how many startups have you been involved with technically three I founded one before this it was a this is called Zelda comm we did mobile point-of-sale and integrating to legacy POS systems and implementing NFC payments and chip credit card payments and before that we were building a white labeled Android app store for picks at L so let's talk about smart contracts just to kind of reel back for a second of course people talking about smart contracts you build them on the ethereum blockchain etc now is there a way to actually audit a smart contract the way we audit a smart contract is you need a engineer who has a unique background the the background has to be a security background a QA mindset full-stack engineer that's keeping up with solidity and solidity is the language that aetherium the protocol is built on it's a new language that very few engineers in the world are very well versed in it it's updating as a language on a weekly basis and so when we're doing a smart contract audit you need this engineer with a unique background to marry the code to the words to do a gas analysis to do a static analysis and to do a dynamic analysis you know you're talking about more money entering the space and there is auditing it's like more money entering the space than there is engineering talent correct at what point does the industry start to level off in terms of the various under law underlying dynamic components if you will start to come into more of a balance if it will that ever happen I guess as a precedent you'd look back to the dot-com era or some other high-growth tech eras but if that question kind of makes sense doesn't make sense what's your thought on that I think that a lot of dust has to settle in this industry in order for more sophisticated capital to come play active ball in the space and the biggest issue is a lack of security and a lack of education when it comes to hiring new engineers like what's needed most in this industry is and is more academies to train high level engineering time our selves at Xhosa we're building an in-house Academy because the only way we're gonna stack up our engineering team is by finding full-stack engineers that we can train to become qualified auditors it's if you're a qualified engineer today chances are you're building your own solution or you're being paid a ridiculous amount per month to work for some I see oh yeah and that's just the reality of it when you're offered 800 aetherium for the month for some IC o you're gonna jump ship from whatever you are and the go on going joke in the industries if you're a really qualified engineer in this space you might be too rich to get out of bed yeah exactly I mean that's a real problem the top talent is is become fabulously wealthy and so they're not really motivated to to get their hands dirty correct right yes so you've got a grow talent from the grassroots and this is a brand new industry where even if you're hiring someone on the blockchain side of things maybe they were an early employee at LinkedIn and they've built out a big team of 30 people before but they haven't spent the time to read the Bitcoin blockchain white paper Devin rich Satoshi white paper where it all started and I feel like most of the times people who are very experienced in business don't understand blockchain 101 and that's also a big problem with hiring this is a true for anyone in this industry I'm sure they're all facing it you found someone who can be a VP of Marketing you know Salesforce or she knows Salesforce and par dot but they know nothing about blockchain 101 and how to operate in this space what's the what's trustless what's the decentralization really mean people bring their assumptions and their experience and they hear a few things and then they just kind of poured over what they know and they think they know stuff so what is it's like with the one thing that a newcomer even an experienced I'll say technologist is missing about the blockchain ethos if you will the core belief system what's that one special sauce if you will that they're missing I don't think it's special sauce I think it's reading the Bitcoin white paper read it understand it and if you don't start watching some videos from Andreas Antonopoulos read Nick Szabo's essays I think they a little more succinct I found Nick Szabo's material easier to digest he invented the word smart contract the phrase and it's remarkable that people don't even know that now looking out to 2018-2019 what are your thoughts on bitcoins emerging second layer like lightning networks and how's that going well I mean we've been waiting for a really long time for Elizabeth and the Lightning Network team to give us a viable solution but we've all been very excited about sidechains being the answer and sidechains being the answer to us viably being able to go up against Visa and MasterCard in this space because it's not gonna happen on the the core Bitcoin blockchain right so it's got to go off chain yes it to handle that volume and it gets back to you know the debate of 2017 was really this debate about store value versus means of exchange and the means of exchange were opened up competing block chains and talking about how a toasties vision is all about digital cash and that the store value argument is not really to be placed in the center of the discussion but it looks as though that store value argument kind of won out to some degree in 2017 and that now we're in 2018 and it seems like the argument of the day is going to be proof of work versus proof of stake yeah okay so explain the difference and then your view on that proof of work is not sacrificing security as much as proof of stake is that proof of stake is a great step towards leveraging less electricity and it's way more earth friendly but is it the right step for security I would personally say in my personal opinion no first proof of stake takes a step in the wrong direction for security at least right now it's it's sacrificing security in order to save electricity and which brings us right back to proof of work the dust hasn't settled so therefore it kind of comes to all the way back to Bitcoin again because it's the longest chain is - it's the got the longest track record it's got on uninterrupted uptown uptime right and so do you see anywhere maximalist to say that that's the reality bitcoin is all we really have stuff right so as a security professional that's kind of your opinion to the industry if folks are asking you about that that's the we review yeah we're excited for proof of stake but they need to value security and we need to as a community hash through how security won't be sacrificed so on the environmental issue it seems like a non-starter in many ways because first of all I mean just off the top of my head I'm thinking like well you know renewable energy can power watching and you know like Saudi Arabia's gonna be 100% renewable soon they've got an array of solar panels that are the biggest in the world Iceland is all geothermal energy the technology for photoelectric cells is going you know that asymptotic curve down to like zero cost right so we're heading into a renewables anyway and and so why is this even an issue security it's usually just someone I don't think the issue is finding a way to have renewable energy be produced whether it's nuclear or whether it's solar I think that's not the issue the issue is just being able to hash through how can security be the the utmost priority in order that so security is not sacrifice in an effort to make things proof of stake where's the proof of work no I get that but it just seems that the common theme you hear from no coiners as they're called let's say a Paul Krugman from the New York Times yeah he'll hit on this it used up a lot of energy issue and it just seems like a it's a non-starter it doesn't matter all right yeah it's okay for you see a lot of electricity right now at this point all right there's a lot of things that use a lot of electricity and honestly we don't even know if like the US dollar that's gold gold all right the Oh show is duck I oh is the name of the company this is heart edge Sawney CEO and founder I'm co-founder and president my co-founders do Kwan yo Kwon and his previous company was coin setter they found in exchange that in New York they sold coins that are too crackin and after that he launched launch key where they got rid of passwords using multi-factor authentication they sold launch key die evasion labs and then and I partnered up to start her show and to be laser-focused on blockchain security perfect thanks for being so much max already appreciate it alright well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser and Stacy Herbert want to thank our guest heart as Sony of hosho dot IO if you want to reach us on Twitter it's Keiser Report that's the next time bye Oh
