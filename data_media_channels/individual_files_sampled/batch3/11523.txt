it seems the EU is feeling a little vulnerable in the wake of some media headlines in the UK hold the front page the Sun the UK's right-leaning tabloid used a clever play on words to get its feelings across of the recent Salzburg summit you know the one where the leaders of the EU outright rejected the UK's brexit proposals well that headline has caused rather a tailspin in the EU and the Commission is now calling for a more responsible approach by the media in the way that it informs the public about issues like brexit and there I was thinking that freedom of press was a cornerstone of the EU media can build the culture of dialogue or so divisions spread disinformation and encourage exclusion the brexit debate is the best example of that I would advocate for a European approach to media based on quality and smart regulation if needed the Sun front page which set the EU justice commissioner off is not the only hard-hitting act on the part of the British tabloids known for pulling no punches and surely the brexit debate coverage is no exception but our headlines like this really that offensive and sewing division to the extent that some sort of regulation is needed to bring them in I think a newspaper can write whatever they want to but if it's aggressive towards a community in terms of law regulation then it should be forbidden the media needs to to remain free whatever is written in those media and that's it I think the freedom of speech is important so we should be able to write anything but simply there have to be more serious journals that explain on the other hand that it's unacceptable to write such things it's necessary to respect why they have expressed but the public should also be respected it seems the EU justice commissioners proposals are pretty unpopular at least here in Paris from what I gathered the view on the street is mostly don't touch the press we asked the same questions in London and it seems opinion across the English Channel is divided and also influenced by readers preferences I think they've got be there's gotta be regulations in place to keep everyone playing by playing fairly I don't encourage strong language yeah that kind of headline could be offensive to people but that doesn't kind of compromise we had to have a free press in this country press can look after themselves they won't print anything that's gonna upset their readers that's facing I think the paper should be banned oh yeah appealing to the lowest common denominator and I'm a guardian reader and what do you expect me to say you
