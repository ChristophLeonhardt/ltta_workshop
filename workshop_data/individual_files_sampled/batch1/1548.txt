worst humanitarian crisis and the United States where Donald Trump's travel ban has now made it seemingly impossible to bring his family I finish this time I should fuck Minnie Winnie more than any he will enjoy we should when we met Najib and his family they'd been living in the East African nation of Djibouti across the sea from Yemen for almost four months there hasn't been an American Embassy in Yemen for over three years now because of the war that means visa applicants including American citizens like Najib have had their cases assigned to foreign countries like Djibouti as they tried to get their families away from the conflict to mama ma fille oh well Ann Machado couldn't have invited her Murphy my official in Kenya my vision class come in half I'll be Landin Hara how do you I had

difficult in Yemen mechanics kita as the war escalated Najib applied for visas for his family to join him in the US where he works to support them and where she met can get stable medical care they applied well before Donald Trump became president and introduced the travel ban mass outcry and protests marked the initial chaotic rollout of the ban which stopped the entry of nationals from a number of Muslim majority countries including Yemen release just a week after Trump took office the order moved through three versions while I was being challenged in court so it wasn't until December that the full impact on families became clear when the Supreme Court allowed the third version of the band to go into effect a month and a half later Najib and his family had their interview at the u.s. embassy here in Djibouti describe what happened in the embassy here in Jerusalem Maya yeah I'll have in Solera give me yours it's because she was born after Najib became a citizen his youngest daughter Lamia could be issued a passport but his wife and two other daughters needed visas Holland America portamento Mamba Sofia and Carmen and how did you know only if you stiff now it's not kinda Futurama is ever a seat yeah one of our changes in the latest version of the travel ban is the inclusion of one pathway to the u.s. a waiver that can be granted on a case-by-case basis if applicants meet three criteria the morphic Atalaya a jib hello person the minute the whole at least they swallow Chaka Layla one who decried sheer Aletta didn't owe me a lemon way to Nutella me here I wanted hula Sehun we must like the open e totally and mommy had attended that I'm gonna call me let me he had a little Appa Najib thought that given Shay Mets condition and the fact that he's an American citizen they would qualify for a waiver with no appeals process their one hope now would be at the Supreme Court which was set to hear challenge to the travel ban and rule whether to uphold it or not by the summer until then their lives would remain in limbo and Mahanama can defer living here cost him his savings forcing him to rely on family and friends to get by the question facing them now can they bear the weight in djibouti or will they have to go back to Yemen so now that you've been refused what's your Danny my side una novia Burma and how can you say I do not know and holla holla saba originally manasa a known or Jania man in Canada the war in Yemen shows no signs of slowing as northern rebels continue to fight with a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and supported by the United States now in its fourth year the conflict has destroyed much of the country's infrastructure leading to widespread disease and famine and over 22 million people in need of humanitarian assistance it's this that so many Yemenis are trying to escape as they try to reunite with their families in the u.s. instead hundreds have been stranded between their two homes stuck in a foreign country we went to meet with a group of applicants who'd been in Djibouti for months many of whom had already received waiver rejections under the ban who here has a US citizenship so a lot of you so are you you have citizenship I was born and raised there and so you're applying for who my wife I got the refusal paper here so you're gonna do now most of spent tens of thousands of dollars waiting in Djibouti where there's a high cost of living spending fortunes and borrowing fortunes and in the end where is the hope external doula in the German Calvary taxi you could ask Allah Allah the operator that's the question facing everyone here as they grapple with how to keep their families United and figure out where their home is now how is this affecting your family's become here for in signs of hope and then they just tear that apart the moment this day was lifted all of these people receives visa denials were the notice that they were also denied the waiver the LSMs is an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights which has been working with yemeni-american visa applicants who have received waiver rejections for their relatives she says there's been little transparency from the administration about how waivers are actually granted there isn't like a formal application process that you would be subjected to undue hardship if you're denied that it would be in the national interest to let you in and that you don't pose a threat to national security but it's a bit of a shadow boxing exercise because you don't really know what it is you need to show to meet that criteria did anyone here get a waiver many of the families we met didn't even know that there was a waiver in the ban largely because they began their application process years ago were you aware about the waiver process was there people who had gone through their interview process and filed all their documents well before it was there was such a thing as a waiver so they didn't even make a case for undue hardship so on what basis were they being denied it's like you're getting a rejection for something you didn't even ask for and that seems particularly of Kafka ask that you know your application for waivers denied and I'm you know you've never even applied for one these are US citizens and US lawful permanent residents who have a right to be reunited with our families one of the couples we met in Djibouti has been trying to start a life in the US for nearly three years yeah sure Thanks for seeing us as nice at home Mohamed first moved to New York in his early 20s when he went back to Yemen a few years later he and Aziza got married and they had their daughter omnia the war broke out when she was still a toddler and we don't worry don't worry we don't watch a few foreign elements Takata hair mr. Poirot I'm us fetus I'm a factor of three become favorable Louis Saha even handsome has its share a big corner and you got an S in a favorite okay happy has that dad if I'm gonna feel a lot of Muhammad became a citizen when he went back to the US where he was working and most of his family lives and started planning for Aziza Annamayya to join him in stuff for the house furniture for the house that's it so we clean are you gonna view in the family when they got to Djibouti five-year-old DeMeo was given a visa but her mother was still waiting for a decision my wife same case same number so they know that you might gonna be the race so I don't think so beginning giving my wife reject but as eases interviewed took place before the ban went into effect and it was unclear to her that she had to make a case for a waiver I didn't learn I'm an open America cost control consider on the saga Carter on bow Alabama's in color she doesn't so it says a waiver won't be granted in your case sticking to the counter provisions of the proclamation did they give you any other reason that they explain why whistle I like mine I get the passport very sweet and just watch the news they even give you information from the embassy the family needs to make a decision about their future within days because Muhammad and their daughter have to go to the US while she still has a visa but then the question is where will Aziza go philopon hollow sudden death star of her data or of the tree attack mudfish Abdul Allah hand AHA we can assure akela chairman Petra had an open house on Staten Island a great visionary holy an updated door Shelley I'm mama mama Anna Tovar sent over sent over to element o sanjaya dominant Nikolas lava the separation facing Mohammedan Aziza has been shared by too many families some in Djibouti others having returned to Yemen and their relatives in the u.s. waiting hoping they can be together soon before the war Yemeni Americans were able to travel relatively easily between their two home countries that's the case for Abdul Fahim he works in the US for an ATM company to support his family we went to meet him at his apartment just outside New York City home to generations of Yemeni Americans that's a wave of immigrants they came from our area in Yemen Abdus family's roots in us go back almost a century I'm a fourth generation here fourth generation in the country my father's grandfather from his mother's side the citizen my father is a citizen all my uncle's are citizens Abdul had hoped his children would continue that line - that's so far she's 21 years old Muhammad is 17 voil√° is 9 this is my wife and your other son is how old 19 years old there's nothing in this video he first applied for visas for his wife and four children in 2015 just after the war began it marked the beginning of their first long separation which lasted almost three years without me being here supporting them we wouldn't have a source of income to meet our life demands was the logic for me to come but emotionally was that was tougher than any time before the next time he would see them would be in Djibouti when they left Yemen and traveled there for the visa interview at the interview together it was in January 29th I'm in the interview the little one she was eligible for citizenship she get it easy but the rest of the family was rejected it's difficult to reconcile those families history in America with the fact that his own children are now banned from coming here that wasn't the America that we thought about that we dream to live and to come to and like to settle here to pursue our lives the day we met up do the rest of his family had just left to Booty it was too expensive to stay there so they went to Jordan where they'll wait for the Supreme Court's decision it's gonna be a life-changing decision after that when you live here you feel lonely but you still have the hope that they gonna come and was just gonna be a normal process for to bring them since it gets that hard and would be bad you feel even lonelier than than before you kids are the other side of the globe and it's very very very hard and waiting for the Supreme Court ruling has come with steep costs for families and for Najib waiting in to Booty eventually became impossible well me and my German what can it help that the water it as well - why is one knuckle 9 news - bad news - favi Djibouti Matt will have a team up with treatment unavailable for Shaima and Djibouti Najib told us he didn't know what to do but go back to Yemen where he sent us these messages well hello Hal Chima Mustafa Ali own feed hassle than female Elijah half Yemen La Jolla will have a papaya Africa battery here a mystery they give that man Malaysia so will an ally the families we met during our reporting like Najib and his family seems like they met the criteria for a waiver under the ban one of the things that we're really sort of scratching our heads about it's a sort of undue hardship requirement and how we can show that many of the people as you can imagine leaving countries like Yemen would suffer and do hardship if they're not able to rejoin their families in the u.s. the families we met also seemed like they meet the criteria particularly because they're American citizens and in the Jeep's case his daughter she met needs critical medical care both of which are listed as qualifications to be considered for a waiver so who's deciding who gets a waiver the US government official position is that it's a consular officers discretionary decision but if you put yourself in a position of a consular officer and you're sort of told and the rhetoric around at the administration is over sort of an overall ban these people from use countries are essentially undesirable you're gonna have a much harder look to decide whether or not someone should be eligible for a waiver according to State Department data sent to Congress in the month after the ban went into effect 8400 applications from the targeted countries were processed but only two waivers were approved the State Department declined our request to interview officials in Djibouti or Washington but told us that in the four-month period leading up to the Supreme Court arguments 460 waivers are granted but they refused to say out of how many applications by claiming that there is a robust waiver process through which you can seek a waiver it sort of takes away some of the harm it's a bit of more of a sugar coating of what is an outright ban and then that sugar coating disappears if you actually look at what's happening on the ground and we see that the waiver process is only there in name but not in practice let's just take for example mr. alomari the ten-year-old in late April on the last day of their term the Supreme Court heard arguments in the challenge to the travel ban this waiver process has excluded justices focused on the waivers and why so few people were being granted them and out of thousands of cases just one was brought up by name a ten-year-old with cerebral palsy who wants to come to the United States to save her life and she can't move her talk the ten-year-old was denied a waiver Justice Breyer were you surprised when you found out that your case was mentioned at the Supreme Court nominee Lilly O'Hara Olivia field al Muhammad Yahoo a Kenya member apat best mapping woodworker in Hobart Cosima Tajima and hybl Muhammadu car just a day after the Supreme Court arguments Najib received an email from the US Embassy in Djibouti okay so this is the email you got from the embassy dear mr iyama read during your family's immigrant visa interview at u.s. embassy the severity of shame has cerebral palsy had not only been independently verified by a panel physician but also very apparent to me to new Jeep surprise the embassy official told him they were now approved for waivers had you heard from the US consulate in Djibouti at all between when you were rejected for surjective for the waiver and when you got the approval in April when if you eat of muscle the embassy official claimed he had always been approved but they couldn't tell him in the meantime Najib in his family spent thousands of dollars in Djibouti and traveled back to Yemen after the email he had to wait for further instructions and eventually got a call from the embassy telling him they had two weeks to get to the u.s. from Yemen they rushed to Djibouti to get their visas and then were finally able to come to the US or we met up with them again via the annual header and any vitamin fun had the family settled in a small town in California Shay met is now receiving proper medical care one night and what a shame a stinky theory ani Halton if she was there as a my heart I have an English MC Connell azzam ordeal and miss ballets mode via Hema Annie Dalek he was Takara NFC at hamster Kurama do you think that getting this waiver may have saved her life Janna he didn't know was say I've had no helium Sheila high achievement had no Kalina and no I add my immortal top-selling yeah no mana student with low cal two months after hearing arguments over the policy the supreme court issued their ruling the travel ban was upheld what do you think about the supreme court's actual ruling on the band neck said it about her carotid about next Fe Fe

you know how jolly Najeeb in his family seemed to be an exception with thousands of others left to face the reality of the court's decision of morphine tell me Allah we met up with Mohammed then his daughter omne and Brooklyn they traveled here shortly after he met them in Djibouti to live with the rest of his family they decided that Aziza would go to Jordan where Muhammad's older brother lives and a very though Kariba vehicle in terminal a talk about convey Hannah I literally him Cohen I mean muffler their hope is that omnia can get her passport or a green card soon so she can join her mother in Jordan while Muhammad works in New York but it still means their family will be separated she leave a little bit time with her mother in late at a time with her dad it's not good for her it's not good for her life personality like 3-4 months for her mother three four months with had father that's gonna be like two persons I'll of this country that's like my country I love it and I'm
