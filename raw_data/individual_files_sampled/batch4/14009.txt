I think the newer times of the liberal media Germany are drowning men clutching at straws Trump has maneuvered the Democrats out of the position of a permanent minority party incapable of winning national elections and incapable of reclaiming losses at the state local level and because of that they are desperate to find some magic bullet that this terrible president go away it's not going to happen you might recall that on Friday CNN claimed it had a smoking gun but had emails filling that front was aware of the WikiLeaks post burden of the Democratic National Committee emails before they were posted it turned out that they simply had gotten the date wrong in the email that completely flood the story sort of thing that a cub reporter would be fired for and after having a whole day of gloating it turned out the story was absolute nonsense and earlier in the week Brian Ross at NBC had claimed that Lieutenant Colonel Mike Flynn was going to testify that Trump had instructed him to contact the Russians during the campaign presumably to collude on breeding the election that turned out to be completely false as well NBC had to apologize so we've had one smoking gun after another that turned out to be a soggy water pistol and I think that's what will happen Robert Mueller Special Counsel investigation of the president will peter out after a few months with nothing but the scouts of a few sacrificial victims like the unfortunate Mike Flynn but I think they've got nothing on the president I think their desperation is in direct proportion to their political losses and that's really the thing to focus on his back the Democrats into a corner that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
