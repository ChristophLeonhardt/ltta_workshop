1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,170
SEN.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,170
DIANNE FEINSTEIN HAS BEEN
UP UNTIL WHITE NOW SHOCKINGLY

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,940
OUT OF STEP WITH HER
CONSTITUENTS ON THE ISSUE

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,750
OF MARIJUANA.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,610
TODAY SHE TAKES ANOTHER STEP TO
BE LESS OUT OF STEP BECAUSE

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,180
SHE SAID THIS.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:29,039
AND TO THAT I SAY IS SHE NOT
MERCIFUL?

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,299
BUT THAT IS HER MOVING

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,640
TOWARDS THE POSITION OF HER
STATE.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:51,809
SHE WENT ON 
TO SAY THIS.

11
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,449
SO SHE SEEMS TO HAVE TO SOME
EXTENT SURRENDERED ON TRYING TO

12
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:01,079
GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO
COME IN AGAINST CALIFORNIA LAW

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,641
TO SHUT DOWN THE PLACES SELLING
MARIJUANA AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

14
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:37,149
SHE IS STILL PUSHING BASICALLY
THE PLOT LINE OF REEFER MADNESS.

15
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:40,490
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING
THAT SHE HAS STARTED TO MOVE IN

16
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,000
OUR DIRECTION, BUT WE ARE STILL
QUITE FAR OFF.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,310
THE FEDS BEING AT ODDS WITH
THE STATE CREATES ALL TYPES OF

18
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,499
OTHER ISSUES BECAUSE AS WE KNOW
THAT THE BANKING REGULATIONS IS

19
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:56,280
SUCH THAT THEY WON'T TAKE CREDIT
CARDS AT THESE OUTLETS BECAUSE

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,859
THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE FEDS
CRACKING DOWN.

21
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:04,109
THERE IS A WHOLE ECONOMIC
IMPACT ON THIS INDUSTRY THAT

22
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,820
AFFECTS TAXES AND THE HEALTH OF
THE STATE.

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,390
IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN
JUST THE APPROVAL OF THE DRUG

24
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,580
ITSELF, OF MARIJUANA BEING
EQUAL TO ALCOHOL OR A GATEWAY

25
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,709
DRUG OR WHATEVER.

26
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,940
THAT IS ALMOST LIVING IS A
SEPARATE ISSUE GIVEN ALL

27
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,830
THE PROBLEMS WITH THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT BEING OUT OF

28
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,940
STEP WITH THE STATES.

29
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,140
WELCOME TO 2018.

30
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,269
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU
CAN'T EVEN TALK TO SOMEONE

31
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,110
WHO WAS STILL STUCK ON THIS.

32
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,349
SHE IS MAKING LIKE YOU SAID THE
OLD REEFER MADNESS FROM THE 40S

33
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:44,791
OR 50S AND YOU ARE JUST NOT
GOING TO GET HER TO GO

34
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,930
ALONG WITH HER CURRENT THINKING.

35
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,400
THE MONEY IS THE BIG DEAL
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL THIS MONEY

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:03:03,040
LIKE COLORADO 

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,140
AND WASHINGTON.

38
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,420
I'M NOT A YOUNG MAN BUT IT IS
LIKE TRYING TO TELL MY

39
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,909
GRANDMOTHER THAT WEED IS OKAY.

40
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:19,150
HE WOULD BE LIKE TRYING TO TELL
YOUR GRANDMOTHER ñ SHE IS FROM A

41
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,329
GENERATION WHERE IT WAS THIS
HORRIBLE THING AND SHE IS NOT

42
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:28,360
CHANGING HER MIND.

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,460
LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE EVERY
SINGLE PERSON UNDERSTANDS

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,980
WHAT IS UNDERLYING THE STORY.

45
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,129
THE REASON SHE IS MOVING IS NOT
THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

46
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:40,690
IT WAS A REFLECTIVE MOMENT.

47
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,790
SHE IS IN A PRIMARY AND THIS
IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

48
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,070
HAVE PROGRESSIVE CHALLENGERS IN
A PRIMARY.

49
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,409
THAT'S WHY WHEN PEOPLE SAY THE
PRIMARIES ARE THE WORST THING IN

50
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,610
THE WORLD, ALL THAT IS BS.

51
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,890
THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE IS
SUCCESSFUL IT CAN RESULT IN A

52
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,189
BETTER MORE REPRESENTATIVE
CANDIDATE REPRESENTING A

53
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,560
DISTRICT OR STATE.

54
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,590
EVEN IF IT ISN'T BEFORE YOU HAVE
THE PRIMARY IT CAN LEAD TO THE

55
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,970
CANDIDATE FINALLY ADAPTING ON
SOME ISSUES AND MOVING ON

56
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:33,940
THE DIRECTION 

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:42,690
YOU 
NEED TO MOVE

58
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,690
IT.

59
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,030
YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE SPENDING
TIME IN JAIL FOR SIMPLE

60
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,200
POSSESSION OF THINGS THAT NOW I
CAN GO AND BUY RIGHT NOW.

61
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,850
I TALKED TO A CANDIDATE ON
REBEL HEADQUARTERS ABOUT

62
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,200
INSTITUTING REPARATIONS FOR
THOSE WHO HAD SPENT TIME IN

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,470
JAIL FOR POSSESSION OF WEED.

64
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,480
THERE WAS SO MUCH FARTHER WE CAN
GO ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU HAVE TO

65
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,080
ASK YOURSELF WHO I WANT
AS MY CHAMPION?

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,280
SOMEONE WHO WAS RELUCTANTLY
APPROACHING MY CURRENT POSITION

67
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,380
OR SOMEONE WHO WAS LOOKING TO
THE FUTURE AND THE NEXT STEPS

68
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,100
WHEN IT COMES TO LEGISLATION
HAVING TO DO WITH MARIJUANA.

69
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,760
THANKFULLY WE GOT A PRIMARY
COMING UP SO WE GET TO MAKE

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:24,140
THAT DETERMINATION.

71
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,740
I HATE TO SAY OLD BECAUSE
THERE ARE ALSO SOME FORWARD

72
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,940
THINKING OLDER PEOPLE.

73
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:35,900
I THINK MOST OF THE POINT OF
PROGRESSIVE POLITICS DOES

74
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,550
NOT REPRESENT OUR VIEW TO THE
FUTURE.

75
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,650
I REALLY THOUGHT WE WOULD'VE
OUTGROWN THIS.

76
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,410
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THE GRANDMOTHER
THING, I REMEMBER BEING A KID

77
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,280
AND THINKING IT IS GOING TO BE
SO COOL THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,090
TO THINK- WE ALL VOTE IN COOL
NEW PEOPLE WHO GET THIS

79
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,090
MARIJUANA

80
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,120
THING.

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,830
AND YET WE HAVEN'T, IT IS
INSANE.

82
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,770
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T
COME AROUND ON THIS AND NOW EVEN

83
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,300
THE SENATOR OF ONE OF THE MOST
PROGRESSIVE FORWARD THINKING

84
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,770
STATES HAS JUST NOW COME AROUND
INCREMENTALLY ON IT.

85
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,740
WHEN I SAY OLD I DON'T MEAN ñ
BUT IT'S ALSO THE THING OF HOW

86
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,930
LONG HAS SHE BEEN IN THE SENATE?

87
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,190
30 SOMETHING YEARS?

88
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,630
COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH
PEOPLE.

89
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,620
YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO TALK HER
INTO AGREEING TO A LAW THAT

90
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,520
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED
FOR.

91
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,800
THAT IS RIDICULOUS THAT YOU HAVE
TO TALK TO A SENATOR LIKE ñ THIS

92
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,020
ISN'T LIKE PEOPLE TALKING ARE
PEOPLE GETTING HIGH AND JOKING.

93
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,730
THERE WAS AN ELECTION IN
CALIFORNIA VOTED IN CALIFORNIA

94
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,070
SAID MARIJUANA SHOULD BE LEGAL
FOR RECREATIONAL USE FOR ADULTS

95
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,070
TO USE.

96
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,900
AND SHE IS LIKE MAYBE IT IS
OKAY.

97
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,440
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
PERSONAL OPINION.

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,090
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT
THE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE

99
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,990
HAVE SPOKEN.

100
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,550
IF YOUR PERSONAL OPINION DOES
NOT AGREE WITH THE PEOPLE EITHER

101
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,520
LEAVE THE JOB OR SUCK IT UP AND
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE.

102
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,001
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE
FOR SOME 30 ODD YEARS YOU ARE

103
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,330
COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE
PERSON YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

104
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,840
THAT THIS IS WHY YOUNG
PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE FEEL

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,600
THAT NO ONE REPRESENTS US.

106
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,240
BECAUSE SHE WAS A SENATOR FOR 10
YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN.

107
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:32,260
WE HAVE A MODEL FOR THIS.

108
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,270
THEY VOTE PRO-CHOICE BECAUSE
THEY KNOW THAT IS WHAT THEIR

109
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,430
STATE WANTS.

110
00:07:36,430 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU CAN DO THAT FOR OTHER ISSUES
TOO.
