00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,469
hello boys and girls today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,300
to talk about sluts now there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,920
lot discussion around the web sluts

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,750
recently especially on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,090
idea of slut-shaming the slut walk a

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,710
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that also peach when Tina</font>

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,690
favorite Mean Girls and asserted that if

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,099
you call each other sluts and whores you

9
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,719
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for guys to call you sluts</font>

10
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,010
and whores anything that needs to be

11
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,359
that much explanation as to why it's

12
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,340
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sexist and completely valid time</font>

13
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,140
to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone a slut as a judgemental</font>

14
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,850
assertion or how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex they're having</font>

15
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,470
that measures it<font color="#E5E5E5"> against some weird</font>

16
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,029
arbitrary standard what is a normal

17
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of sex to be having or what is an</font>

18
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,330
appropriate amount and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

19
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,279
completely subjective it's a weird witch

20
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,809
hunt mentality and no one really<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows</font>

21
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,250
what the lines are but people feel like

22
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,840
they are qualified<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that person's</font>

23
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,670
a slut and they say person but really I

24
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,200
mean women<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's no equivalent</font>

25
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,969
term for men a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it's like</font>

26
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,860
man whore or joking<font color="#CCCCCC"> late that guy's</font>

27
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,270
acting like such a slut right now yeah

28
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,590
technology of the word slut is a little

29
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,789
bit difficult and weird and

30
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,440
multi-layered and changes them all in

31
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,480
the 200 years after its first year it

32
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,149
means kind of dirty slovenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman it's</font>

33
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,860
connected with the dialectical Swedish

34
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,230
work slaughter which means idle one is

35
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,300
funny that lethargic and slot are joined

36
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,730
by idleness and how inactivity seems to

37
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,438
link all the bad things so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

38
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:05,820
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of the word slut now we think</font>

39
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as an active thing as something</font>

40
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that involves too much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> action rather</font>

41
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,850
than too little action and again tracing

42
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,340
set emoji seems to not just be in

43
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,500
regards to sex or in regards to sex at

44
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,689
all jalsa describes an untidy man as

45
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,640
sluttish not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the sort where we</font>

46
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,960
would use the word today<font color="#E5E5E5"> according to my</font>

47
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,729
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems like slut became a bit</font>

48
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,229
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> judgemental time in the mid</font>

morality in fact the online etymology

dictionary which is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

55
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,890
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> has this quotation from pizzas</font>

56
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,320
diary that says our little girl Susan is

57

<font color="#E5E5E5">the most admirable slush and pleases us</font>

58
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,689
mightily for 325 60 and 64 but now what

59
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">is negative and is this big fight to</font>

60
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,229
reclaim it somehow because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

61
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">are two options you have to directly</font>

62
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,110
persuade people that the use of the word

63
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,210
slut is unacceptable inappropriate and

64
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,850
judgmental and nasty and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

65
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,680
perpetuates is really unfair standards

66
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,750
between men and women of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people</font>

67
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,399
women around have sex with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

68
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,899
people men or a lot have sex with as

69
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,040
well as the idea that it's anyone's

70
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,299
business something that American

71
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,340
politicians are having really hard time

72
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,160
coming to town

73
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,419
I think the other option if you're not

74
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,830
going to persuade people that it's not

75
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,690
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a stop letting it be an insult</font>

76
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,610
which is so much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> said than done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

77
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,320
know but this has kind of been my

78
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,720
philosophy with everything the past few

79
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,400
months see how I'm taking the I'm rubber

80
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,960
and you're glue whatever you say bounces

81
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,910
off me and stick to you approach to the

82
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,290
world involves genuinely not

83
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,090
sarcastically saying thank you to anyone

84
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,800
who calls you a slut it involves

85
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,450
creating many lines for much show up

86
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,220
nothing I wonder that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

87
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,710
talking insert name here nobody marks

88
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,510
you courtesy<font color="#CCCCCC"> at South</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> must convert to</font>

89
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,250
disdain if you come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in her presence I</font>

90
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,990
had rather hear my dog barking to crow

91
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,180
that a man's where he<font color="#E5E5E5"> loves me a bird of</font>

yours etc etc etc just<font color="#CCCCCC"> relate man it</font>

94
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,600
would be so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interesting if you</font>

95
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">referred to me the lady just stayed and</font>

96
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,870
spoke in iambic pentameter then if you

97
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,700
just call me a slut like how lazy is

98
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,140
your language that's the worst thing you

99
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,850
can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me that I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a person who</font>

100
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">likes to sleep with lots of people</font>

101
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether or not that's factually accurate</font>

102
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,070
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an insult when you</font>

103
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,420
pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> apart and the fact that we let</font>

104
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,950
it become an insult just makes it even

105
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,050
more ridiculous than bizarre so I

106
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,490
propose Thank You is the accurate

107
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,870
response to someone accusing you of

108
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,670
sluttish pneus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in a way eza</font>

109
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,620
became the model for my life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

approaches to the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> Olive</font>

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,950
penderghast is my hero well in the sense

112
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,780
that it's the best written film of all

113
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,640
time or it's the best certain characters

114
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,560
of all time what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the least problematic</font>

115
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,050
story of all time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

116
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">like her approach to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world they want</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to call me a dirty skank fine I'll be</font>

118
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,790
the dirtiest lightly I've ever seen I

119
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,930
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the approach that we need</font>

120
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,490
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're tackling women's</font>

121
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,110
issues women's rights issues and rights

122
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,610
issues in general you're going to accuse

123
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,630
me of something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't even</font>

124
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an accusation I'll do</font>

125
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,989
whatever you want for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your hopes and</font>

126
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,489
dreams may be without the prostitution

127
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,320
aspects of it but still it's always nice

128
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,790
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do something for prostitutes</font>

129
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,959
and also like to add that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

130
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,400
funny ways that sluts can come into

131
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,900
conversation for example yesterday I was

132
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,310
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out with my friend</font>

133
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,750
Becker and she was annoyed that some of

134
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,489
her friends wants slutting up to go out

135
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the set of Manning up you slut up</font>

136
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,120
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think it's really nice use</font>

137
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,650
of the term and<font color="#E5E5E5"> firing let's experiment</font>

138
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,570
with my new approach to the word slut

139
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,530
hey Lex<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're a slut like a monkey</font>

140
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,870
today so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of my not at all</font>

141
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,820
complex opinion on sluts if you have any

142
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,130
complex or non-complex opinions on sluts

143
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,690
then leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in the comments also I'm</font>

144
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,130
really devastated to find out that Dan

145
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,160
Harmon has less

146
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,930
community and will no longer be sure

147
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,310
Rhonda he's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> replaced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a showrunner</font>

148
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,540
community is one of my favorite

149
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,770
television programs it's really well

150
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,910
written yeah it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sound</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

151
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,070
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that away from him I mean you</font>

152
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,990
know it was one last season<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were</font>

153
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,310
getting and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace him</font>

154
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,620
what like what what what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font>

155
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,330
what's the point I mean I'm keeping

156
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,710
