what's your outlook for the markets do you think that the US stock market is expensive right now no I think the US market is is okay I mean it's it's Hana sort of Rocky's kind of year and I think the reason for that is people don't have a hard time appreciating just the earnings we're receiving right now I mean the problem is I think stock market investing is kind of a monotheistic religion there's only one God and that is future earnings growth and the thing is you cannot see much future earnings growth from here next year it's gonna be tougher than this year but look how good its this year I mean this year we think we're gonna do about 26% year-over-year growth and operating earnings per share if the S&P 500 that's extraordinary in the tenth year of a bull market in equities and it's like you getting five years of earnings growth packed into this year so I think we should appreciate I think investors that eventually will appreciate just how good these earnings are right now the ability of companies to earn this cash and distribute this cash that should push the market up and I think the markers you know barring some worth trade conflict I think the market will probably move up now the end of the year and that's my next question what would it take for the market to dive is trade the biggest I think there is a risk there I mean if we just if we if we keep on doubling down on a trade conflict I mean remember you know people like Xi Jinping they're not going to capitulate here because there are politicians in a broader sense and in China they cannot be seen to lose face over this and they think that you know there's no midterm elections in China and because of that they're not going to give an easy and so the danger is the trade war gets prolonged now honestly I think we may see it sort of a trade war ceasefire before the midterm elections because I think the push back on Washington about this trade war is getting bigger and bigger and bigger and eventually I think that's gonna have an impact on the administration but there is a risk you know one of the biggest risks facing this economy is that we keep on pushing up tariffs because tariffs tariffs are such a bad idea it is an idea twice cursed it curses the person inflicting the tariffs and it curses the one upon whom the tariffs are inflicted it's just gonna slow down global growth its slows and economic growth the United States so it is a big risk but hopefully it's one that we sort of back away from before the end of the year and where else are you seeing opportunities for investors well I think there's a there's a lot of opportunities in equities overall particularly outside the United States I remember we're gonna slow down eventually to about two percent growth we don't have the population growth we don't do the workforce growth honestly to to do more than that but if you look overseas Europe still there are a lot of unemployment that unemployment is coming down they can grow faster emerging markets you know there's always something going wrong in emerging markets but overall they've got much better long-term growth prospects and then if you look at valuations the u.s. is fairly valued but Europe is cheaper than average and emerging markets are cheaper than average so I honestly think that if the US can give you about 5% total return per year over the next five years I think Europe and emerging markets can give you about 10% I think that's where the opportunity is
