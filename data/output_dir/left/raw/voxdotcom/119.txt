1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,430
It's from a CNN town hall on gun violence

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,589
held just days after a mass shooting

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,290
at a high school in Parkland, Florida.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,019
On one side, you've got the parents,

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,139
teachers, and students who survived the shooting,

6
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:13,139
and on the other,

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,269
you’ve got Dana Loesch,

8
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,879
a spokeswoman for the NRA

9
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:17,600
who's famous for saying things like:

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,359
They will perish in the political flames of
their own fires.

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,119
This is what the modern gun debate looks like
in America.

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,449
We're so used to hearing from the NRA

13
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:26,640
that we don't really question it

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,439
when we see them on TV anymore.

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,560
But talking to the NRA has turned the

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,410
gun control debate into a confusing, frustrating
mess.

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,550
We don't say that no one has a right to free
speech...

18
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,112
I mean, are we talking about prevention or
not?

19
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:41,230
Wait a second, wait a second!

20
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,460
And that's exactly what gun companies were
hoping for.

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,370
Anything can be qualified as an assault weapon.

22
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,610
If you stab someone with a spoon,

23
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,730
it can be qualified as an assault weapon.

24
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,050
If you go to the NRA’s website right now,

25
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,070
you'll see the group describing itself as

26
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,410
“America's longest-standing civil rights
organization.”

27
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,120
We're the largest and oldest civil rights
organization in America.

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,080
The NRA really wants you to think of it that
way

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,470
because it frames the organization as essentially

30
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,860
a public interest group,

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,050
alongside groups like the ACLU and NAACP.

32
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,370
That framing is the reason the NRA pops up

33
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,240
in every debate about gun control.

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,220
If you think of the NRA as a group that represents

35
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,360
gun owners, you can't really debate gun policy

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
without them.

37
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
The problem is...

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,060
The way they go about this is a charade.

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,060
It's a fraud.

40
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,820
This is Democratic Congressman Ted Deutch.

41
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,440
He represents Florida's 22nd Congressional
District,

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,610
which is where the Parkland shooting took
place.

43
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,490
And he is tired of arguing with the NRA.

44
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,610
This is an organization that receives millions
of dollars

45
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,990
every year from gun companies directly,

46
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,250
millions more through advertisements.

47
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,310
Yeah, you’ve probably heard about the NRA

48
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,390
giving money to politicians,

49
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,280
but we should talk about how much money the

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,570
NRA gets from gun companies.

51
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,360
Every year, gun manufacturers donate millions
of dollars

52
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,260
to the NRA through its corporate partners
program.

53
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,550
Some of them sponsor specific NRA projects

54
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,729
like “Empower the People,” sponsored by
Sig Sauer.

55
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,550
Or “Love at First Shot,” sponsored by
Smith & Wesson.

56
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,960
What is “Love at First Shot”?

57
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,139
I don't want to know.

58
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,960
Other gun companies give money directly to
the NRA,

59
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,160
and ones that donate over a million dollars

60
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,569
get to be part of something called

61
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,420
the NRA’s “Golden Ring of Freedom.”

62
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,040
An honor given to those who make significant
contributions

63
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,480
to the NRA’s defense of the Second Amendment.

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,819
That “Golden Ring of Freedom” includes
companies

65
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,600
like Beretta, Remington, Bushmaster,

66
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,810
and Smith & Wesson, the manufacturer that
produced

67
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,450
the gun that was used in the Parkland massacre.

68
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,450
In exchange for their donations,

69
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,200
the NRA gives gun companies these tacky golden
jackets.

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,010
That’s more of a dirty yellow.

71
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,010
Yeah, that is not gold.

72
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,160
The NRA doesn't disclose how much money it
gets

73
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
from these donations.

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,360
But a report by the Violence Policy Center
estimates

75
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,231
the number was anywhere between $20 and $60
million

76
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:57,510
from 2005 to 2013.

77
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,880
The NRA makes millions more by selling ad
space

78
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,280
to gun companies in publications like American
Rifleman.

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,910
But maybe weirdest of all,

80
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,810
some companies donate a portion of every gun
sale

81
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,160
directly to the NRA.

82
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,980
Taurus buys an NRA membership for every customer

83
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,520
who buys one of their guns.

84
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,040
In 2015, Sturm Ruger launched a campaign donating

85
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,870
$2 to the NRA for every gun they sold,

86
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,030
which explains why so much NRA programming

87
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,480
looks like a gun ad.

88
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,420
The AR-15 is one of the most effective tools
available

89
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,550
to protect yourself and your family.

90
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,550
What the…

91
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,430
All of this makes the NRA less of a public
interest group

92
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,690
and more of an industry lobbying group.

93
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,130
And that's a big distinction.

94
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,060
We're arguing about gun control with a group

95
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,319
that makes money when people buy guns.

96
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,590
They're a lobbying group.

97
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,130
I don't know, frankly, that there's

98
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,490
another lobbying organization that drives
the debate

99
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,810
on an issue the way that they do,

100
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,629
So any time the NRA debates gun control,

101
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,950
their priority is protecting the product.

102
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,340
To deflect attention away from gun sales,

103
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,700
they blame violence on things like video games

104
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,780
...vicious, violent video games with names
like Bulletstorm…

105
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,920
while blocking the CDC from actually studying
gun violence.

106
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,580
Or they say we need to enforce existing gun
laws -

107
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,129
We have all kinds of gun laws on the books
right now, John.

108
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,180
We don't enforce any of ’em.

109
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,798
while lobbying to gut the agencies

110
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,719
that would actually enforce those laws.

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,108
They blame states for not using

112
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,478
the background check system.

113
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,050
Do you know that it is not federally required

114
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,580
for states to actually report people

115
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,610
who are prohibited possessors?

116
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,779
And then aggressively oppose background checks

117
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,599
because background checks

118
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,919
“don't stop criminals from getting firearms.”

119
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,460
You know perfectly well the reason states

120
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,089
aren't mandated to go through that system

121
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:41,419
is because of a lawsuit the NRA filed.

122
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:42,990
Or, most obvious of all,

123
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,210
they argue the solution to gun violence is

124
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,210
buying more guns.

125
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,150
To stop a bad guy with a gun,

126
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,320
it takes a good guy with a gun.

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,499
Yeah, that's a twofer.

128
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:56,789
They get to talk about something other than

129
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:59,620
all of the things that have broad bipartisan
support,

130
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,249
and they get to talk about something that

131
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:03,669
is ultimately going to benefit the gun companies

132
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,460
that fund their entire operation.

133
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,979
The annoying thing is these distractions work.

134
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,860
A Vox study of cable news coverage

135
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,439
after the Parkland shooting found that CNN
and MSNBC

136
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,879
both devoted serious airtime to debating arming
teachers.

137
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,659
How do you feel when you hear these proposals

138
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,360
to arm the teachers, given what was going
on?

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,279
That allegiance to gun companies creates a
warped view

140
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,400
of the gun control debate.

141
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,490
The truth is huge majorities of Americans

142
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,059
agree on things like background checks and
restrictions on assault weapons.

143
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,879
And most gun owners, including NRA members,

144
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,120
support things like universal background checks.

145
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,969
The NRA knows this too.

146
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:40,569
Which is why they work so hard to convince
their members

147
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:43,100
that the government is coming to take away
their guns.

148
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,699
Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment

149
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,610
so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.

150
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,300
It is always this attempt to whip people into
a frenzy.

151
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,659
This is just the first step.

152
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,009
We're the only thing that stands between you
and tyranny.

153
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,009
It’s nonsense.

154
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,159
It's a distraction.

155
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,949
It's also a smart marketing strategy.

156
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:01,649
If you convince people the government is

157
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,909
coming for your guns, they'll buy more.

158
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,039
Gun sales usually spike after mass shootings.

159
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,400
Thankfully, not everyone is falling for it.

160
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,220
This is Ryan Deitsch, a survivor of the Parkland
shooting.

161
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,229
He was visibly frustrated at the CNN town
hall.

162
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:26,550
And he says he’s started turning down invitations

163
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,050
to debate NRA spokespeople like Dana Loesch.

164
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,479
We know what happened at the town hall,

165
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,369
and we just did not want to give her that
platform.

166
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:37,139
Deistch isn't afraid of debating gun control.

167
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,539
I love to face the opposition.

168
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:40,830
I've been told I'm too nice.

169
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,599
But he says talking to the NRA is different.

170
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:44,729
They're never going to agree

171
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,789
because the money flows one way.

172
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,430
Please, God, no, not a new Dana.

173
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,649
We've seen this exact thing happen before:

174
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,729
with tobacco.

175
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,979
In the ’50s, tobacco companies formed the
Tobacco Institute,

176
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:06,289
a group that spent 40 years fighting against
tobacco regulation.

177
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:08,499
Most of the Tobacco Institute's work

178
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:11,240
is with people who represent the public's
interest.

179
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,099
The group became one of Washington's most
powerful,

180
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,139
well-heeled, and effective political lobbies.

181
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,679
And like the NRA, they did everything they
could

182
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,039
to protect the product.

183
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,309
They blamed lung cancer on air pollution and
food additives,

184
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,840
tried to block government research on smoking,

185
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,229
It’s inappropriate for any agency of government

186
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,289
to take steps to try to eliminate a legal
product.

187
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,809
and peddled junk science.

188
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,679
Most smokers don't develop lung cancer.

189
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,009
We think it's an open question.

190
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,860
And believe it or not, lots of news outlets
took the bait.

191
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,150
The Tobacco Institute charged that its findings

192
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,770
were based on evidence that is not scientifically
conclusive.

193
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,899
Looking back, it's bananas that anyone

194
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,979
included the Tobacco Institute in public health
debates.

195
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,949
But that's exactly what's happening now with
the NRA.

196
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,300
There's no question that having the representative

197
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,819
for the biggest gun companies raises

198
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,740
all of those same concerns.

199
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,969
That doesn't mean we should ignore the NRA.

200
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:07,189
It's still an incredibly powerful industry
lobbying group.

201
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,699
And we should take that political influence
seriously.

202
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,889
But that doesn't mean we need to take their
arguments seriously.

203
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,289
Debates about gun control only work if both
sides

204
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,959
are genuinely interested in finding a solution
to gun violence.

205
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,550
But in this case, they're not.

206
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,039
If the way that you’re approaching this
is about

207
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,029
either having guns or not having guns,

208
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:29,240
then having the gun manufacturers there

209
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,469
probably makes sense.

210
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,869
But that's not what the debate should be.

211
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:33,140
That's not what the debate is.

212
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,140
It's about taking action to keep our communities
safe.

213
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,429
That's a conversation most Americans agree
on.

214
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,559
But it's a conversation that falls apart

215
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,899
every time the NRA gets a seat at the table.

216
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,250
I want to thank Dana Loesch of the NRA for
being here

217
00:08:45,250 --> 00:00:00,000
to listen to your questions.
