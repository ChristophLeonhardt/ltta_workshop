>> Shannon: ED HENRY,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WITH THE SEVENTH BACKGROUND
CHECK ON BRETT KAVANAUGH
POTENTIALLY DONE AS SOON AS
TOMORROW, I VOTE COMING SOON
AFTER, SENATOR KOERBER SAYS HE
DOES BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS MAY
HAVE OVERPLAYED THEIR HANDS.
LET'S BEGIN HER OWN POLITICAL
ASK
EXPERT, THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, GOOD TO SEE
BOTH TONIGHT.
KAYLEE, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
VERY DISCIPLINED ABOUT THIS.
TONIGHT THAT SEEMED VERY
UNSCRIPTED AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH
AND THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE
PROCEEDING.
WITH THAT OFF MESSAGE FOR THEM
TONIGHT OR THAT EXACTLY WHAT HE
WANTED TO SAY.
>> I THINK IT IS EXACTLY WHAT
YOU WANTED TO SAY.
HER TESTIMONY, SHE COULD NOT
RECALL THE TIME, THE PLACE TO
HIM HOW SHE GOT TO THE HOUSE,
BUT SHE DID HAPPEN TO REMEMBER
TWO THINGS, THAT SHE HAD ONE
BEER AND THAT SHE WAS 100%
CERTAIN THAT THIS PERSON WAS
BRETT KAVANAUGH AFTER 30 YEARS
OF NOT BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY
HIM OR NOT TELLING ANYONE THAT
IT WAS IN FACT HIM WHO WAS THE
ASSAILANTS.
I THINK IS MAKING THAT POINT
WHICH SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE MADE.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK NOW
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE LET
PEOPLE WEIGHING IN FROM ALL OVER
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM ON THIS.
EVEN REPUBLICANS NOW ARE SEEMING
TO WANT TO HEDGE THEIR BETS.
THAT INCLUDES SENATOR JEFF FLAKE
WHO LED US TO THIS ONE WEEK
DELAY AND THE FBI, HERE'S WHAT
HE SAID.
>> I TELL MYSELF, YOU GIVE A
LITTLE LEEWAY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE
HAS BEEN THROUGH.
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE CAN'T HAVE
THIS ON THE COURT.
WE SIMPLY CANNOT.
>> Shannon: THAT IS VERY MUCH
SOMETHING WE HAVE SAID FROM YOUR
FORMER BOSS, HERE'S
HILLARY CLINTON.
>> FOR ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THERE
IS SUCH THING AS A JUDICIAL
TEMPERAMENT AND THAT WE WANT
JUDGES PARTICULARLY THOSE ON OUR
HIGHEST COURT TO APPROACH
ISSUES, APPROACH PLAINTIFFS AND
DEFENDANTS WITH A SENSE OF
FAIRNESS.
THAT THERE IS A LOT TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT.
>> Shannon: OVER THE WEEKEND,
THIS IS A NEW THING,
TEMPERAMENTS.
HE IS BACKED INTO A CORNER
TRYING TO FIGHT HIS WAY OUT, HE
SEEMED WAY TOO EMOTIONAL.
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT WAS
EMOTIONAL, THINK THAT WAS A
MELTDOWN.
I UNDERSTAND IF SOMEONE COME
I'VE BEEN ASKED THIS, WHAT WOULD
YOU DO?
WOULD YOU JUST SAT THERE, NO, I
WOULD BE INDIGNANT, WOULD BE
UPSET.
YOU KNOW I WOULD DO QUESTION
WORK ON CALL FOR AN
INVESTIGATION.
IF I'M INNOCENT THAT I WILL
RESPECT WHAT SHE SAID AND I
CANNOT RECONCILE THE TWO BUT I
WANT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
AND I WANT YOU TO ADD TO THE
BOTTOM OF THIS AND I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE UNTIL YOU DO.
THAT IS NOT WHAT HE SAID.
HE SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID I WANT
AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE
NEXT DAY EVERYONE TURNED ON HIM
AND CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION.
IT WAS SILLY.
I THINK HE TEMPERAMENT PART IS
LEGITIMATE.
WE WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS A
MATURITY.
WHICH OF THE SAND?
SLOVER LIKE A JUDGE.
THAT MAN WAS NOT JUST OVER LIKE
A JUDGE.
HE PRACTICALLY HAD ANGER
MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS.
I UNDERSTAND HOW FRUSTRATING
THIS IS BUT THERE IS A WAY TO BE
STRONG AND DENY IT AND EXPLAIN
AND BE COMPELLING, WITHOUT THE
GUY WHO SHOWED UP.
IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE BOYS
WILL BE BOYS DEFENSE, DON'T BE
THE JUDGE.
>> THAT WAS NOT A MELTDOWN,
DEMOCRATS CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH
WAYS.
HAD HE NOT SHOWED ANY EMOTION
THEY WOULD'VE SAID HE WAS COLD,
HE DIDN'T SHOW ANY EMOTION, HE
WAS VERY CALM I THOUGHT.
I THOUGHT HE SHOWED EMOTION
APPROPRIATELY.
IF YOU WOULD USE IT THERE FOR A
WEEK AS HE WATCHED THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA'S SMEAR YOUR
NAME WITH HEINOUS ALLEGATIONS OF
GANG-RAPE, PRETTY SURE THAT
ANYONE WOULD REACT OR THAT HE
REACTED.
>> Shannon: AND THE FAMILY AS
WELL, WHAT IS HAPPENING ON BOTH
SIDES.
DR. FORD'S FAMILY, THIS IS AN
INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL SITUATION.
>> I KNOW PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE
BRETT KAVANAUGH FAMILY AND THEY
SWEAR BY THEM, THEY CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.
THIS WOMAN CAME FORWARD AND SHE
MADE A STATEMENT AND I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REPUBLICAN
TALKING POINTS ARE.
>> THE TALKING POINT IS THAT
THERE IS NO CORROBORATE
EVIDENCE.
>> ISSUE LYING?
>> I THINK PEOPLE THINK
SOMETHING HAPPENED.
SENATOR THAT I REMAIN VERY
CONCERNED WE MIGHT NOT GET THE
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAT THE
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS WEREN'T ON
THE SENATE AND THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE DESERVE.
HE WAS PART OF THE ONE MAKING
THE DEAL.
NOW KAYLEE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
WILL NOT BE GOOD ENOUGH.
>> TO QUOTE SENATOR McCONNELL,
I CAN ALMOST HEAR HIM MOVING THE
GOAL POST.
THIS WAS A PREDICABLE AND POINT
OF DEMOCRATS.
THEY WOULD OFFER THE
INVESTIGATION, AMY KLOBUCHAR
SUCH AS WHEN WE COME WHICH IS A
PROBLEM WITH ONE WEEK?
NO NOTHING IS GOOD NOT BECAUSE
NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY
DEMOCRATS.
IT IS ABOUT TO LAY UNTIL THE
MID-TERMS.
THAT IS A SAD TRUTH AND IN DOING
SO THEY ARE SMEARING AN INNOCENT
MAN.
>> Shannon: OF THE
INVESTIGATION IS DONE BY
TOMORROW OR WILL THEY VOTE BY
THE END OF THE WEEK?
>> I THINK I SHOULD BE DEADLINE.
>> Shannon: IF THE BOAT IS N,
SHOULD THEY VOTE?
>> SURE.
>> ON FRIDAY JUDGE KAVANAUGH
WILL BECOME JUST AS KAVANAUGH.
