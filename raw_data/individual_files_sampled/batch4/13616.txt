ring comm slash Ben that's ring.com / Ben again one hundred and fifty bucks off when you go to ring calm / Ben go check it out right now ring calm / Ben for that special deal alright so the breaking news today is that poem Anna Ford has apparently cut a deal with the federal government with the Muller investigation we don't know what that deal encompasses we know that Paula that poem Anna fort had already been convicted on several felony counts related to bank and tax fraud charges and then he was to move on to a second trial and he pled guilty in that trial to avoid a a longer sentence apparently the according to the New York Times the negotiations over a plea deal related to a separate set of seven charges encompassing conspiracy obstruction of justice money-laundering false statements and violations of a lobbying disclosure law it's not clear exactly what manna fort might plead guilty to apparently he's pleading guilty to a bunch of charges having to do with failing to register as a foreign agent of the Ukrainian government back when a named Yanukovych was was running the country in any case man affords trial on the second set of charges was scheduled to get underway on Monday but now he has pled guilty he's going to turn over apparently an enormous amounts of property the federal government what is more important because who cares about Paul Manafort what's more important here is that Paul Manafort is apparently working under cooperation agreement with the Muller investigation which means that presumably he is flipping maybe on President Trump and this is the part where it starts to get real dicey for the Trump administration because nobody actually knows what man affort knows nobody knows exactly what man affort was doing now again there's no evidence that's actually been shown that mana fort was actively cooperating with the russian government on behalf of Trump Trump could still say listen I just hired this guy manna for because this guy manna Ford has long-standing high-level RNC ties going back legitimately years years I mean ties to top members of RNC finance ties to top political members of the RNC going back election cycles I mean several election cycles and Trump could just say listen I was looking for a campaign manager there wasn't a professional available the RNC suggested that I pick up manna for it because they knew him I picked him up and whatever he did on the side that's his business but that doesn't mean that I personally knew anything the problem is that Trump has made kid claims that the Trump campaign had nothing to do with Russia if it turns out that man afford as his campaign manager was messing about with Russia then that could lead to some pretty severe consequences according to ABC the deal is expected to be announced in court Friday it remains unclear whether Manta Ford has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors were simply conceding to a guilty plea and now appears that he is indeed cooperating with prosecutors we don't actually know again what's the information that he's going to turn over to prosecutors what exactly are they getting in return for a reduced sentence of some sort we don't know the answer to that and we're gonna have to wait for the answer to that but it's not good news for President Trump obviously president Trump you remember was tweeting incessantly after the Paul Manafort convictions a couple of weeks ago which came out on the same day that Michael Cohen pled guilty and said that he was cooperating with federal prosecutors do you recall that president from tweeted out how much he loved Man afford for not flipping on him now it is now it's getting real ugly now it's really ugly so man has indeed agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in the Russia probe on July 31st mana forts attorney had told CBS there was no chance his client would cooperate with the special counsel to avoid his first trial but now he is apparently going to have to cooperate to avoid the second trial so this could be very ugly for the Trump campaign the Trump administration we're going to have to see what this actually means everybody is jumping to the conclusion that this is the end of Trump you know again unless there is something deeply unless there is something I think deeply indicted and convicting a president Trump himself it's gonna be very difficult to make the claim that President Trump was personally approving any sort of Putin manipulation of the election but we'll have to see the evidence that mana 4 provides because after all could be and Manta 4 again does haven't he does have an incentive I would say to spill as much of his guts as he possibly can on the President or to theoretically make things up in order to avoid the consequences of his own corruption apparently going back years but the fact that mana fort is flipping his bad news for president Rumple meanwhile the Democrats are trying to play every dirty trick they can with regard to Brett Kavanaugh yesterday saw the dirtiest trick of all this was Dianne Feinstein's the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee she refer to information involving judge Brett Kavanaugh president Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court to federal investigators on Thursday but the senator declined to make public what exactly the matter involved two officials familiar with the matter say the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between judge Kavanaugh and a woman when they were both in high school so now we're gonna go back 35 years to try and find something that Brent Cavanaugh allegedly did wrong hey Dianne Feinstein's announcement yesterday was just perverse because here's what she announced quote I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court that individual strongly requested confidentiality declined to come forward a press the matter further and I have honored that decision I have however referred the matter to federal investigative authorities so in other words somebody came with information I'm not gonna tell you what the information is I'm not gonna tell you where it came from I've referred it to federal authorities so it could be anything it could be the worst thing you could possibly imagine or it could be the Bret cabin always mean to someone back in high school but I'm not gonna say so and this is where you start to look at this stuff and say yeah this is pretty I see stuff yeah if Diane Feinstein really knew months ago that Brett Kavanaugh had to say raped somebody wouldn't she have been under an obligation to tell federal law enforcement then why wait until the week or two before the confirmation vote I'm Brett Kavanaugh except to scuttle the boat simply out of out of this kind of dirty tricks playbook this is really really dirty stuff Ronan Farrow has a piece over at The New Yorker in which he's essentially accusing Brett Kavanaugh of something more dire or at least he's or at least he's substantiating the allegation here's what Ronan Farrow is writing as well as Jane Mayer over at The New Yorker the woman was asked not to be identified first approached Democratic lawmakers in July shortly after Trump nominated Kavanagh so in other words Democrats knew about this for months because it is now September okay so they knew about it in July August and September they did nothing about it they didn't refer it to the FBI they waited until now to take a allegation that Cavanaugh has apparently completely denied and throw that into the public square it's sort of a red meat thing to stop Bret Cavanaugh's nomination Democratic lawmakers didn't do anything about it the allegation dates back to the early 1980s when Cavanaugh was a high school student at Georgetown Prep School in Bethesda Maryland and the woman attended a nearby High School in the letter the woman alleged that during an encounter at a party Cavanaugh held her down and that he attempted to force himself on her she claims in the letter that Cavanaugh and a classmate of his both of whom had been drinking turned up music that was playing in the room to conceal the sound of her protest and that Cavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand she was able to free herself although the alleged incident took place decades ago and the three individuals involved were minors the woman said the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result in a statement Cavanaugh said quote I categorically and unequivocally denied this allegation I did not do this back in high school or at any time Cavanaugh's classmates said of the woman's allegation I have no recollection of that and the woman's declined a request for an interview so how exactly is Diane Feinstein bringing this up now again with no evidence other than this woman's allegation which has been denied by everyone else who was there now maybe if she's telling the truth maybe she is but wouldn't it have behoove Diane Feinstein to initiate that investigation say in July when she first received the information I mean this is dirty tricks at its very finest it's dirty trick all the way down and this is not the last time this is not the most yeah the only time the Democrats have tried this routine they tried the same routine with Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas's hearing bringing up allegations that were thoroughly non-credible for a variety of reasons about Clarence Thomas supposedly sexually harassing Anita Hill talking making jokes about pubic hairs on coke cans and such and this was supposed to sink Clarence Thomas they're trying the same thing here Republicans should ram through Brett Cavanaugh's nomination right now the FBI has already declined to investigate it they announced that yesterday they have referred it to the White House for a background check but that's all because there's no further evidence that this actually happened Cavanaugh denies the allegations and the Democrats are gonna have to do better than that instead they're smearing Brett Kavanaugh with an allegation decades old decades old going back to when he was 17 years old when he was a minor and we are supposed to pretend that this is a legitimate effort to keep what a serial rapist off the Supreme Court that's what Democrats are really doing here this is the dirtiest of the dirty stuff it's just it's just gross it's the same thing as when Harry Reid suggested that MIT Romney had not paid his taxes they just went out there and said it and then it turned out the MIT Romney had in fact paid his taxes but Harry Reid said you know what we got what we needed to get done done he wasn't elected presidents of the United States this is gross stuff do you want to write people think politics is a dirty disgusting business this is why people think politics is a dirty and disgusting business because folks on every side of the aisle are pretty much willing to do anything to take down political opponents and listen I'm on the right eye I don't think that my side is immune to this I don't think I'm immune to this but I think that this is a pretty egregious example I mean over the last couple of weeks when we've seen cory booker doing this routine where he is spartacus by reviewing documents that were already revealed or when he saw Kamala Harris implying that Brett Kavanaugh had been corruptly discussing the Muller investigation with members of president Trump's firm with no evidence of that whatsoever when you had Sheldon Whitehouse proclaiming that he didn't feel subject to the law because Merrick garland should be on the Supreme Court and now when you have Dianne Feinstein dumping into the public record unsourced allegations of an alleged sexual assault that took place 35 years ago in order to stop Brett Kavanaugh his ascension to the Supreme Court really really gross stuff and that's not the only dirty allegation being put out today by Democrats in an attempt to smear Republicans we'll get to another one this one courtesy of the New York Times in just a second but first we're talking out a lot of dirty stuff let's talk about keeping your teeth clean so you really haven't spent a lot of time thinking about how to keep your teeth clean when you go to the dentist's office they ask you you know how do you brush for long enough do you brush twice a day and then you lie and you say you did but there's no reason for you to lie instead what

Democrats not just the Brett Kavanaugh think the White House by the way has responded immediately to this White House spokeswoman Kerry ku Peck said throughout his confirmation process judge Cavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators including senator Feinstein said that Feinstein set over sat through over 30 hours of testimony addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential setting not until the eve of his confirmation has senator Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new information about him Senator Schumer promised to appo judge Cavanaugh's nomination with everything I have it appears he is delivering this 11th hour attempt to delay the confirmation so it just really grows up that's not the only gross allegation today there's a headline at The New York Times today going after nikki Haley who's the single most popular Republican in the country and as I had said before on this show my spirit animal here is the headline from The New York Times State Department spent fifty two thousand seven hundred and one dollars on curtains for Nikki Haley's residence so this is an attempt to paint nikki Haley as a sort of scott pruett casually corrupt official who's spending enormous quantities of cash pear cash in order to of taxpayer cash in order to pad her residence hey here's the piece from the New York Times I'll say you stopped me when you think you hear the problem with this New York Times piece the State Department spent fifty two thousand seven hundred one dollars last year buying customized and mechanized curtains for the picture windows in Nikki Haley's official residences ambassador to the UN just as the department was undergoing deep budget cuts and then frozen hiring the residents in a new building on First Avenue has spectacular views and miss Haley is the first ambassador to live in it for decades her predecessors lived in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and after the hotel was purchased by a Chinese insurance company with the murky ownership structure the State Department decided in 2016 to find a new home for its top New York diplomat because of security concerns the government leased the apartment just blocks from the delegations offices with an option to buy according to Patrick Kennedy the top management official at the State Department during the Obama administration the full floor penthouse with handsome hardwood floors covering large open spaces stretching nearly six thousand square feet was listed at fifty eight thousand dollars per month per month a spokesman for Miss hailey said plans to buy the curtains were made in 2016 during the Obama administration Miss hailey had no say in the purchase he said so the headline is nikki Haley is responsible for spending fifty three grand on curtains and then buried in paragraph four of this piece is the actual story which is that the Obama administration outfitted the place for fifty eight grand on curtains because they were fully expecting the UN Ambassador to be a Democrat the Obama administration was expecting the next person to occupy that penthouse to be a Democrat and so they decided to spend inordinate quantities of cash on curtains but they're trying to pin it on nikki Haley anyway so instead it's going to be that nikki Haley is is somehow responsible for all of this really a tremendous smear a really massive smear from the New York Times again in an attempt to get top Republican officials and then you wonder why folks don't actually trust the media well meanwhile there were a series of elections in New York last night and there's a bizarre split that happened in New York last night there are a bunch of very very far left candidates who won in sort of local races the most prominent of whom is Julia Salazar a 27 year old Democratic Socialist who is plagued by negative news coverage in the final weeks of her insurgent campaign against incumbent New York State Senator Martin Dillon for making misleading statements about her background she had claimed that she was the child of Colombian Jewish immigrants that she had emigrated she was an illegal immigrant who was poor from Colombia and Jewish not a single element of that is true okay she's not from Colombia she's an American citizen her parents are American citizens she isn't she was not poor she grew up middle class to upper-middle class she is not Jewish okay all of this was false so she's basically a sociopath just essentially lying about key elements of her background that didn't stop people in this New York district from voting for her for the New York State Senate because this is a small district in the middle of North Brooklyn and as we know Brooklyn is a very very left area voters in North Brooklyn this is according to The Huffington Post which loves Salazar voters in North Brooklyn on Thursday found her preferable to Dillon's close ties to the real estate Lobby Salazar triumphed in the Democratic primary for the New York State Senate 18th district seat the voters may also have been sending a message of disgust with corruption scandals that have rocked the state Senate Suzan Kang a leader of the New York City chapter of the Democratic socialists of America which endorsed Salazar and she's an active dues-paying member of the organization she said Julia Salazar's victory is a testament to how much her policy platform resonated with the people of North Brooklyn some of the fastest gentrifying communities in New York City her bold platform of fighting for tenants rights immigrants and transit riders matters more than this expensive smear campaign against her and that shows how important the issues really are so she she again implied that she was an immigrant she's not that she was poor she's not that she graduated from she said she graduated from Columbia University she does not have a degree from Columbia University she said that she was raised in a Jewish in Jewish faith that is untrue and I love the New York The Huffington Post coverage while these fibs made headlines they're just fibs they're just fibs not real lies about her background they are fibs salazar's policy platform earned her the enthusiastic grassroot supports of the Democratic socialists of America basically you're talking about one area of New York that is far left socialist and keep selecting similar people from Alexandria Asya cortez to cynthia nixon but here's where things get weird that same district last night that voted for Julia Salazar voted basically two-to-one for Andrew Cuomo Andrew Cuomo / Cynthia Nixon in the Democratic gubernatorial primary so Cynthia Nixon who was running to the far left she put out a series of tweets this morning talking about how she was very disappointed that so many people showed up and turned out to vote for Andrew Cuomo which is a weird thing for a Democratic Socialist to say supposedly a power to the people person she also talked about how true priorities like banning plastic bags we're not gonna be taken care of by Andrew Cuomo can't imagine why she lost in any case Cynthia Nixon who did win by the way one third of the vote being her only qualification for office being extraordinarily radical on politics here's what she had to say in the aftermath of her defeat it is about offering a vision of the way things could work if only we have the leadership and the political courage to make it a reality this race for the Democratic nomination may be over but the fight for the soul of the Democratic Party is just beginning you know here's the part that is actually kind of true about what she's saying and here is where Republicans run into a bit of a pickle hey Republicans are betting on democratic radicalism to save them they're betting on the fact that the Democrats have moved very very far and left to save them in general elections like 2020 because president Trump's approval ratings are low because President Trump will be hit with another slew of negative headlines regarding Paul Manafort for example and so the feeling is the only way that President Trump cruises to victory in 2020 is because the Democrats are just bad at this the Democrats are likely to nominate somebody who's a far left radical who's easy to pillory I'm not so sure that's true because where Cynthia Nixon is correct is that her agenda is in fact taking over the Democratic Party the mainstream Democratic Party people on the right are counting on the Julia Salazar in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's of the world to take over the party they're counting on people who are overtly nuts to take over the route of the Democratic Party and to a certain extent that's worked on the grassroots level but I think that as we rise in democratic politics they're actually window the most ridiculous candidates so I'm a little bit concerned about the fact that Andrew Cuomo defeated Cynthia Nixon I was hoping Cynthia Nixon would win because then we'd actually have the specter of Cynthia Nixon as New York Governor we could point to her Andrew Cuomo is bad enough he's actually bad at politics but Andrew Cuomo is in fact a professional politician and I'm gonna explain why that's important in just one second but first let's talk about natural disasters okay right now there's a natural disaster bearing down on the east coast of the United States and there's a solid possibility that a lot of folks are going to be cut off from grocery stores from the ability to get potable water and all the rest and this is one of the reasons why you really ought to have some food in your house that is available in case of emergencies when there's no power refrigeration fails stores closed and then what do you do well I trust my Patriots apply for dependable food storage you should as well each person in your household should have at least a two-week emergency food supply from my Patriot supply this week they're offering a special price of only 75 bucks for a food kit that contains 92 servings of breakfasts lunches and dinners call 888 803 1413 or go to my special website prepare with been calm again that's eight eight eight eight oh three 14 13 or the special website prepare with been calm the food lasts up to 25 years in storage only 75 bucks that includes a rugged tote order now 888 803 1413 or prepare with ben's calm folks around the office have tried the food they say taste like home cookin and it last for 25 years in storage 888 803 1413 be prepared in case of disaster prepare with been calm even the government recommends you ought to have some sort of food supply in your house well no reason why it shouldn't be my Patriot supply good folks who can make sure that you are equipped in case of disaster okay so as I say the problem for the Democrats is the possibility of unpalatable faces repeating a Democrat socialist platform people like Julia Salazar and XL exaggerate Ocasio Cortez and yes Cynthia Nixon but instead what has happened is mainstream members of the Democratic Party have simply moved to the left to co-opt all of the ideas of the hardcore left Democratic Party when Cynthia Nixon says there's a war inside the Democratic Party the war is over and the mainstream Left lost the mainstream liberals lost the people who are now in full control of the Democratic Party are in fact Democratic socialists who are basically campaigning that way even people like Elizabeth Warren he says she's Pro capitalism yesterday she came out and she said we should break up Amazon and we should break up JPMorgan I'm not sure under what guys should claim that Amazon is monopoly that needs to be broken up but all of this is sort of the populist demagogic rhetoric you hear on a regular basis from Democratic socialists all across the country and folks like beta O'Rourke who was beloved by the Democratic base where he's spending his time campaigning in Washington DC and New York he is running very close to Ted Cruz in Texas which is an insane insane thing ITEX is a very very red state if Pedro Rock were to pull out that race there's no question who had immediately turned around and run for president of the United States here is better O'Rourke trying to explain on CBS because this is what he does he gets all the late-night slots beta O'Rourke explains that dreamers should be freed from deportation by simply granting them full amnesty and citizenship we don't need walls we can have smart security solutions and we can free dreamers from the fear of deportation by making them US citizens today so they can contribute to their maximum capacity to their potential okay so they don't work again adopting some of the most radical elements of the far-left platform he continued by saying that he would not actually trade a wall for the DREAM Act first of all again let me demonstrate how bias the Left media is when's the last time Ted Cruz was on The Late Show the answer is never and they won't even have apparently people like Norm Macdonald on The Late Show because Norma tunnelled is too politically incorrect but beta O'Rourke who's going to lose his race to Ted Cruz in all likelihood that's a guy who they'll have on The Late Show any any Democrat who has higher aspirations will get a slot on The Late Show but the point here is a little bit broader which is that beta O'Rourke and mainstream Democrats they have embraced the radical platform of people like Julia Salazar and Cynthia Nixon but they put a more palatable face on it better or work is better at this than Julia Salazar right nobody's talked about Alexandra Ocasio Cortez for president even if she ran for Senate and won nobody would be talking about her for that but bethe O'Rourke is a pretty smooth polished politician and you can see that he's effective in pushing exactly the same message and again you can see the radicalism of the Democratic Party at work among mainstream political figures who feel the need to adopt that platform Chelsea Clinton is doing the same thing so Chelsea Clinton is the child of the guy who said safe legal and rare should be the standard with regard bortion here she was yesterday saying it would be unchristian unchristian to go back to a time when abortion was illegal you we just can't go back to that I think that's unconscionable to me and also and I'm sure that this will unleash another wave of hate in my direction but as a deeply religious person it's also unchristian oh it's unchristian now it's unchristian to prevent the abortion of the unborn as it's unchristian Wow I mean pretty pretty amazing stuff there but again the point here is is the broader point what's happening is that the Democratic Socialist platform is now rising up in the Democratic Party among more palatable figures including folks like Andrew Cuomo the reason that Andrew Cuomo beat Cynthia Nixon is because the difference between Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon was simply not broad enough to justify voting for an actress from Sex in the City over a sitting governor of the state of New York with a long family history in New York politics when that happens then Republicans really should be worried Republicans should be worried that Democrats will pick somebody who's a little bit more publicly palatable but is mimicking exactly the same messages of Bernie Sanders it won't be a crazy old loom bag from Vermont running this time it'll be somebody who's more attractive there'll be somebody who's better at this it'll be somebody who is who is capable of winning a national election on a far left platform now there is some hope left okay and the hope stands in the fact that a lot of the a lot of the primary voters on both sides are more motivated by anger and revenge than they are by anything remotely approaching typical politics and this is why Michael avenatti I think still provides an outsized threat on the left I think that basically the 2020 nomination the Democratic Party at this point if you had to give odds you say Elizabeth Warren is the odds-on favorite Elizabeth Warren is dangerous because she is picking up all of the cues from the hard left Elizabeth Warren used to be kind of moderate okay back in the day she wrote books about the two-parent in the two for the two income trap and we need to build the middle class by release by removing some regulation and we need to restructure our kind of social mores to to benefit marriage Elizabeth Warren was not a hardcore radical she's become a hardcore radical specifically because she knows that that is what plays with the Democratic base and while she is a / silly unappealing candidate in some ways she can answer the one question that probably lost Hillary Clinton the election why do you want to be President Hillary lost in 2016 because everybody knew the answer was she just wanted it because she felt she was owed it Elizabeth Warren can do the populists routine far better than Hillary Clinton can you can see the media already starting to rally behind Elizabeth Warren the harvard law professor against the the rube from queens that's that's the way they're gonna play this thing so she's still the front-runner and then you've got the the sort of insurgent candidacy of probably Kamala Harris the Democratic candidate from California who's his senator out here she's a terrible senator she was a terrible Attorney General but she is black and she is female and she is radical she checks intersectionality boxes for a lot of folks on the Left she can theoretically try out the minority base in a way Elizabeth Warren may not be able to and she is good at playing the prosecutor and then you have the real dark horse of the race and that dark horse of the race would be Michael avenatti so Michael avenatti this is what Republicans are banking on is that the Democratic base will be driven so nuts by Trump they just decide to go get the angriest guy on television and so while the rest of the country is and the elites particularly are laughing and Michael a vanadis pretensions to glory they also laughed at Donald Trump's pretensions to glory all the way until he was President of the United States Michael avenatti was on Tucker Carlson last night and I have to say you know Tucker I thought did a did a pretty funny job handling and it was clearly planned that this thing was gonna be just a Rock'em Sock'em robots punching match between tucker carlson and michael avenatti it benefits have a nodding it's good for having out it's good for Tucker too because the ratings are good and because Tucker is is good with interviews but avenatti clearly likes these sorts of situations he goes into the lion's den and that's gonna be his pitch his picture is gonna be I'm the guy who punch his hardest and you can see exactly how this work last night so Tucker benefited from the fact that he was smacking around avenatti avenatti benefited from the fact he was punching right back at Tucker this sort of oppositional politics is Republicans best hope for somebody like a vanity to get the nomination so Tucker was trolling avenatti with all sorts of hilarious chi runs last night the chyron writer over at foxnews get to raise the chyron said things like creepy porn lawyer to wayne with 20/20 run have an ID of course is the lawyer first stormy Daniels and Tucker takes on creepy porn lawyer and it was you know pretty glorious Chiron is there from from Tucker Carlson avenatti did get into it with Carlson for Kalima creepy porn where he says why don't you call Trump the creepy porn president this is the kind of thing where avenatti earns points with the base right he's gonna try and run a hard left I fight President Trump campaign and theoretically he could do more damage than I think people will give him credit for why is it that you don't call Donald Trump the creepy porn president he's the one that had sex with a four month old son at home case with my client now without a condom okay so but you don't want to acknowledge that you don't want to acknowledge that acknowledge it okay do you believe that he had such people think it's okay if the president lives settle down okay so it went like this for avenatti a Vinod he comes out of this looking good for his base Tucker comes out of this looking good for his base I will say the funniest moment of this interview is when a avenatti asked Tucker if you watched porn and Tucker got off a pretty good line here if you've got that big boy do you have that bigger problem when's the last time you saw porn oh you busted me actually many humiliation porn that's why I watch you once seeing that no but pretty good line there from Tucker but again this sort of oppositional it's funny everybody in the elites thinks people are watching the Elizabeth Warren of it all things are watching the Kamala Harris of it all more people will watch the clips of Tucker versus avenatti then we'll see that Elizabeth Warren has ever said anything about antitrust this is this is the best hope for Republicans the best hope for Republicans is that they control the Democrats into nominating somebody like a Michael avenatti the worst nightmare for Republicans that somebody who's a credible candidate comes along who's even remotely likable and hijacks Cynthia Nixon's platform and uses that all the way to the presidency that is that is the worst nightmare for Republicans and they should take that under advisement we shouldn't be quite so sanguine about the possibility the Democratic moves to the left is inevitably going to lead to failure on their part okay we're gonna get to the mailbag in just a second but first I want to talk to you about

let's jump right in Jackson says Haven I know there is a huge hurricane coming for me and I still say why should the government be compelled to help me during the storm well I mean the answer is that the government should you know putting yourself in a bad situation doesn't mean that the government isn't compelled to try to help you out right I mean if you if you walk through a heavily crime-ridden neighborhood in the middle of the night and get mugged the police are still supposed to show up if you stay in an area where you're not supposed to be the the FEMA rescuers are still supposed to show up I do think that you ought to bear a higher financial cost for doing that like I think that you should actually have to pay more money for doing that the government should find people for staying in areas where they are expected not to pick up the cost even if their house gets flooded by water John says honorable Chief Justice Shapiro many years from now how do you think this era of politics from roughly 2012 to today and on will be taught in education do you think there's any chance the left-leaning education systems will fail at some point and change perspective what is the most significant example you can think of where history is taught and it completely wrong and twisted manner to American students thanks to you and Daily wire for the continued inspiration well the Howard Zinn version of history is taught routinely in the United States his book a people's history of the United States has sold over 2 million copies basically attributing every individual evil to America and every individual good to the world civilization at large this is something left loves to do slavery uniquely American sexism uniquely American racism uniquely American landing man on the moon world achievement and in World War 2 world achievement ending sexism ending slavery ending racism world achievements all of that is absolute nonsense and there's no basis for that whatsoever as far as how do i think this year of politics will be taught well I think if people regain sanity they're gonna look at 2012 is the election that broke the country I think 2012 really made the country worse in a variety of what like imagine right now if Mitt Romney were in his second term or he drummed in running for reelection in 2020 as opposed to Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump you think the country might be better in a lot of ways I think the country would be a lot better in a lot of ways if Obama had not won a second term in 2012 and used his identity politics in order - in order to seize victory I think that would have been very I think that election was horrible for the country I think it trolled the right into near insanity and I think that in turn has trolled the left into near insanity it has polarized politics in dramatic ways 2008 didn't break the country but I think 2012 really did serious damage to the country Adam says I know there's a general saying about men falling in love or marrying a woman similar to their mothers and women with their fathers do you think there's truth to that is r wife anything like your own mother and how thanks for the infinite insight well yeah I mean I think that you are driven to imitate people that you love and if you are if you like your mom then you're gonna look for somebody who is like your mom in a lot of ways so the ways that my wife is like my mom they they have it's always funny every so often there will be some weird commonality between my mom and my wife and we'll all just start laughing about it so my wife has a tendency to mix up movies in the most bizarre ways my mom is the same thing my wife will forget about the plot of movies extraordinarily quickly in the same way that my mom will they have a lot of commonalities in sort of weird quirky ways um they're very they're similarly practical my mom is career woman my wife is a career woman and because I admire my mom a lot I would say that my wife is similar my mom and those ways there are ways in which my wife is different there are things about my mom that you know I like less than I like about my wife and I looked specifically for ways in which my wife would be different from my mom I think that one of the things that can help you pick a good spouse is making a serious objective analysis of what you liked and disliked about your parents because that allows you to get a little bit of distance instead of sort of falling instinctually into the pattern of marrying somebody who's exactly like your parents your parents are models for your life so of course you're gonna marry somebody who seems to be like your parents in a lot of ways but trying to analyze what it is that drives you nuts about your parents is also a good way to avoid marrying somebody who exhibits those same characteristics andrew says hey Ben I'm a Spanish professor and I want students to join my major but I also want my students to make money after college what should the role of humanities in college related to be related to yesterday's comments well listen i think that the humanities education was originally designed to inculcate things like virtue and american values in a certain level of background knowledge about your civilization but since we no longer do that obviously things should be job-related now I think that being a Spanish major is actually pretty useful I live in the state of California well last night my wife and I spent half an with rosetta stone specifically because we're trying to learn spanish so yeah I think that your major is actually a useful major when it comes to English majors however it seems to me that the only thing that trains you to be as an English teacher or an English professor because the number of successful writers in the United States is extraordinarily low as a percentage that doesn't mean people shouldn't major in English or enjoy English I love English I took a lot of English courses in college I enjoyed them tremendously but I think that if you are looking at the job of a college you have to determine what is the risk reward benefit you know what is it what what is the opportunity cost if you could have measured in something that was gonna earn you more money what if that would that have been the best possible use of your time as opposed to majoring in something that you maybe enjoyed more College has essentially become a sorting mechanism for grad school that's all colleges at this point it doesn't almost matter where you went to college who matters a lot more where he went to grad school it doesn't matter that much I went to UCLA matters a lot more I went to Harvard Law School cuz Harvard Law prepared me for an actual job Blake's has been when planning for a marriage proposal is it more important to get debt and finances in order first or is there more or less that I should consider well I think that it is important to be able to support your family obviously but I think that the first thing that you should be considering is whether you are capable of living a responsible lifestyle generally and treating your wife or husband with the most appropriate level of respect and dignity necessary treating them as an individual human being not as a tool for gratification of your emotional desires that is the biggest thing constantly working on yourself is what makes marriage better constantly working on your spouse is what makes a marriage worse you want them you want to ruin your marriage you wanna run your relationship nitpick your spouse but make sure by the way that you find a spouse who is capable of changing when when they are called on something that is worthy of changed rachel says hey Ben why is it called single payer health care when everyone pays thanks Rachel well the reason is because the single payer is the government but it's really just a euphemism it makes it sound better than nationalized health care which is what single-payer is it was really funny Cynthia Nixon said earlier today that we need a Democratic Party that embraces single-payer health care is like every major Democratic candidate has now embraced the Medicare for all plan now there's some folks who I respect in health care policy you say well embracing Medicare for all doesn't necessarily mean it's single-payer no it means it's the first step toward single-payer because once you have a government option the government can simply undercut everybody else the government does not cost you anything why would you buy private supplemental insurance if the government is going to cover it anyway maybe you do that but the government is then gonna have to restrict your access to that insurance in order to prevent every doctor from simply taking that insurance and rejecting Medicare so heavily regulating creating a public option does create an enormous number of problems in the private market and in fact does lead more toward a single-payer system although obviously there are hybrid systems like Australia where a huge number of people buy supplemental health insurance - all says Haven could you explain how evolution is compatible with creationism thanks love the show fan from hungry there's a great book by a Gerald Schroder called Genesis in the Big Bang that's really worth reading I've recommended it many times basically the idea of evolution being consonant with creationism is there is a force that stands behind evolution God has to use a mechanism that mechanism is evolution I honestly find it puzzling that folks have a very tough time rectifying the balance between the two I understand why folks by the way would want to take the Bible literally because they say if you're gonna take this part metaphorically and you take this part literally how do we know what's metaphorical and what's literal and the answer to that is sort of the Thomas Aquinas answer which is what science tells us is also the presence of God in the universe so science in the Bible cannot be in conflict you're either misinterpreting the Bible or you're getting the science wrong one of the two has to be wrong if you're a true Jew or Christian but creationism is fully consonant with the idea of evolution because again the order of creation suggests that God created living material and then he created plants and then he created in animals and then he created and then he created human beings there's there's nothing there that says by what mechanism God actually did all of that Stephen says - who's your favorite founding father thanks and I love the show you'd have to pose it you'd have to say Washington just because he's the greatest man in American history and this is a person who was capable of uniting a country that was divided about virtually every issue and then seeding power as soon as he could do so legally and it's an amazing thing the amount of the confidence that you have to have to say I'm walking away from power now I'm gonna hand it to somebody who I don't necessarily even trust like John Adams and I'm gonna hand it to that guy and just walk away it's pretty tremendous house has been what legal authority do public universities have to deny students their second Amendment rights about public universities from my understanding have the same authority as local cities and and local and and localities and counties which is they can make regulations that that prevail on their particular swath of territory as long as those don't violate the Constitution with regard to the second amendment so that really hasn't been litigated too much you haven't seen a lot of cases with regard to the Second Amendment frankly but let's say the state of Texas were to pass a law saying that the that conceal and carry is the law of the land and then the University of Texas said no it's hard to see how that could trump the state law of Texas actually let's see finn says dear lord vader how do you think we should pay for the border wall i think we should just take all the money we would spend on straws and use that to build the wall well I mean frankly I think that we have the money to pay for the border wall it is in pretty much every attempted defense appropriations bill so I think the border wall is bln oh by the way I don't I mean I'm in favor of a border wall do I think it's the chief mechanism for curbing illegal immigration I don't I think the chief method for curbing illegal immigration is deportation and that needs to rise with regard specifically to people who have overstayed their visas but it is a serious problem that we have have avoided paying our Freight on a variety of issues in the border wall included Mexico is not gonna pay for it by the way that's just that's only Jay says hi Ben I'm a programmer in Seattle Washington I'm growing increasingly fearful of the homeless problem has gotten much worse in the past years with tents popping up all over the place we had multiple brush fires that have been started along i-5 human feces literally lining the sidewalks trash is everywhere what do you think is the source of this recent uptick in homelessness and what do you think local governments can do to solve the issue well the long term cause of homelessness is the dramatic rise of drug use and mental illness on our streets so it used to be that folks were forcibly institutionalized when they were a danger to themselves or others and living on the street in mentally ill state is not actually a healthy thing but the left has basically decided that you have the freedom to live on the street and has promulgated the lie that most of the people living on the street are people who are simply victims of economic circumstance which is not true the huge swath of the folks who are living on the streets have serious mental illness ends or our drug addicts and have serious problems beyond just they're poor they're homeless shelters available and a lot of these folks are not staying at homeless shelters because they want to live outdoors well you don't have a right to do that the way to fix the homeless problem is to jail people if they if they are defecating on public land it is - it is to take away the stuff that they have on the street and put them in jail Rudy Giuliani did this with Times Square he cleaned up Times Square it is only the localities have decided that they're not going to do anything about the homeless problem the homeless problem remains a major problem in cities like Los Angeles where we have 60,000 homeless people at last count and Seattle where the attempts to build tent cities that are reminiscent of Hoovervilles has continued unabated for the past several years turning the Emerald City a worse shade of poop brown lisa has been as a former left-leaning millennial turned right-leaning do you think Millennials over time will become more conservative or remain the same Thanks well I think that the evidence is that they will turn more right-leaning but the question is how many and right now there's a pretty durable polarization in American politics of the myth that a bunch of people who are on the Left when they're 18 are going to be on the right by the time they're 40 I don't think that's true fewer of them are getting married fewer of them are having children most of them are pretty ensconced in a media world that suggests that all conservatives are racist sexist pig at homophobes this is why I am you know deeply troubled by President Trump's rhetoric a lot of the time I think he's driving away future generations from the Republican Party and the polls bear out my point of view on this I don't think that this is a simple this is as simple as people get older they pay taxes and they turn Republican I just I don't think that's the case unfortunately culture wars seem to matter a lot more than economic ones okay final question here let's see this is kind of an interesting one let's see hi Ben this from Sonia I love your show it's basically part of my lunch routine at this point not really politics but I wanted to ask for your opinion on purely cosmetic surgery I don't have any real convictions one way or the other although I do lean heavily against them following the whole their unnatural and a waste argument there's an issue specifically in my case mostly because I have parents who have been hounding me for about a year to get some sort of nose job I know a lot of people from my ethnicity end up getting one at some point Thanks person's Armenian I guess thanks again love the show and they say That's not me making a racial slur at this point the money isn't a factor in the decision the only thing keeping this from happening is me thanks men again love the show so actually like the Jewish perspective on this which is that you should not seek optional surgery you know optional surgery puts you at risk and seems ungrateful for you know what it is that God gave you unless you can't get a shit off so in the Jewish world that means that unless it's like preventing you from getting married if it's actually providing you significant hardship in your life to have your nose shape the way it is then it seems to me not abnormal to go get a nose job that I don't think it's the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination there there are cases in which plastic surgery that is optional I think is is still fully warranted so for example there are many women who after they have a double mastectomy for breast cancer will have breast reconstruction surgery they don't have to do it for health reasons they want to do because it makes them feel better it makes them feel more beautiful I don't see any problem with that at all however if you're just a dude and you want to like have washboard abs you just go get liposuction because you're vain that seems to me like a waste and a bit of foolishness okay time for some things I like and then we'll get to a thing that I hate so things that I like today we are doing some more Brad Meltzer book so Brad Meltzer has this great series of children's books they're just terrific my daughter loves them the latest in the series is I am Neil Armstrong in which presumably Neil Armstrong doesn't need plants a flag on the moon I'm like in first man these books are great they basically portray all of these characters as kind of kid versions of themselves and they tell their whole story there's one about Abraham Lincoln that's great there's one about George Washington that's just terrific my daughter loves these books loves them and the illustrations by Christian I Christopher Ellie appleís are really tremendous really this is this it you wonder how to educate your kids this is a great way to educate your kids there's a lot of great stuff in these books and Brad who I've interviewed on the program before does a great job with them okay time for a couple of things that I hate okay so thing number one that I hate so yes last night Fox four put out this sweet Fox in Dallas put out this sweet developing search warrant marijuana found in Botham genes apartment after deadly shooting and this tweet rightly got ratioed to the skies Botham gene if you missed it I discussed it a couple of days ago boffin gene is a black fella lived in Dallas I guess he was a rep for a pharmaceutical company or something I can't remember what his job was his insurance maybe and he was in his own apartment a police officer who lived downstairs walked into his apartment she thought it was her own apartment this is her case and then she saw a black guy hulking around her apartment and shot him I mean that's that's basically what she says does that sound racial maybe does it sound really bad in any case absolutely okay and there is no excuse for walking into someone else's apartment and shooting them to death okay that's what happened with this lady because she's a cop it seems like the police department is doing its damndest to try and justify the shooting and so they've now issued a search warrant against his apartment and they found pot there if you think that being shot in your own upon care if this guy had a hydro lab in his apartment I don't care if he was baking crystal meth in his apartment if he was in his apartment and he wasn't doing anything and when I say he wasn't doing anything I mean he wasn't threatening anyone else you cannot go into his apartment and shoot him particularly if there's not a search warrant like it's one thing if there's bacon crystal meth in his apartment and the cops come to raid his apartment and he resists arrest in some way he goes for the cops gonna get shot that's that's one thing but if he's literally just in his apartment making some tea and in the other room he was baking crystal meth and you made a mistake and you wandered into his apartment and shot him and oh look it just happens to me he's got crystal meth in the bathtub what exactly does that have to do with the shooting can the marijuana certainly has nothing so what so about hell what like really what would this be the headline back in you know 1928 during Prohibition if somebody accidentally got shot in their apartment who bottle of gin found on the nightstand so so what this idea that that police officers have to be given this above and beyond level of exemption for behavior that is clearly criminal seems to me absolutely absurd and that needs to stop as soon as possible you want to restore trust between the police and and the community one of the ways to do that is to actually prosecute police when they do bad things and not to try and obscure these facts with with silliness about marijuana being found in an apartment okay other things that I hate so CNN's John Avlon is is doing one of the things that the left loves to do which is suggesting that presidential policy is going to lead to people dying and so far we haven't really had a lot of evidence that people die because of global warming what we have seen is evidence that global warming maybe happening over a period of time that human impact has some effect on the on the environment that even if you make the case that storms are more severe because of this that doesn't necessarily link the death toll to the severity of the storm right there are a lot of intervening factors like how well is the town built and people evacuate right there are a lot of things that are that are linked to that but when we are now seeing from CNN is the attempt to use this current hurricane Florence that is threatening the East Coast as a as a club against Trump so now if John Avalon on CNN claiming that President Trump's policies could lead to 80,000 excess deaths per decade dismantling the clean power plan and opening nearly all our course coastline to offshore drilling it's so bad that according to two Harvard scientists Trump's environmental policies could lead to an additional 80,000 unnecessary deaths every decade okay why what like I'm so glad that they have now linked policies to death so how many excess deaths would Affordable Care Act have led to based on shortages in doctors how many excess deaths have been created by the National Health Service how many excess that like all of these calculations are based on the kind of modeling that you do and the modeling doesn't take into account market changes it doesn't take into account migration it doesn't take into account future technological changes it's very easy to say that you're the policies of your opponent are going to cause death but that seems like an extreme case now that's pretty extreme if you actually want to make the case against President Trump's policies instead of saying it's gonna cause death which is just off-putting in some way say president Trump's policies are irresponsible with regards to the environment and they're going to cause an upsurge in bad weather that has significant impact on the economy and that may result in additional danger to populations if for example storms get worse don't try and forecast how many people gonna die because Trump didn't pick up an Obama or a regulation it's just it's silly towns and it's an exaggeration most people can detect okay we'll be back here on Monday with all of the latest i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro
