normally get the french vanilla one and

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,389
they don't have fresh vanilla flavored

108
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,759
anymore they have a vanilla bean so it

109
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,900
tastes really different but it's just a

110
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot sweeter can you hear that chewing on</font>
