the backlash you're looking at protests in Washington DC today advocates holding the sit-in children wrapped in silver blankets and solidarity with what children are undergoing with this Trump administration zero-tolerance policy in New York crowds gathering at LaGuardia Airport supporting children that were believed and we were just discussing the secrecy issues but believed to be separated from their parents some holding signs we are with you and the singing of we shall overcome take a look out in Portland Oregon where protesters set up tents form forcing ice enforcement field offices to actually be temporarily shut down this resistance getting larger nine days from now there are major protests planned for June 30th that's across the entire country to rally for a continued effort against the zero-tolerance part of this policy which remains in force artists and activists getting involved a powerhouse list of celebrities saying they want to join this cause and use their platforms many celebrities expected to come out in Los Angeles in New York as well now a star lending his voice to the Mex Wilmer Valderrama is the former star of that hit comedy the 70 that 70s show he's an actor and activist his family immigrated here from Venezuela when he was 14 and he's been quite outspoken on issues of immigration reform and tweeted about what real leadership would involve empowering those around to make an environment where anything is possible in fact two years ago in an emotional speech he talked about the struggles his own parents went through following the rules and immigrating legally after selling everything they had to get the family to America now remember one time when my mother Joaquin you know a couple miles back to the house with a girl she'd bags and I looked at my mom and I said mom one day we're gonna drive and she said I'm okay wilmer valderrama joins us now you are someone who occupies an interesting position because of the work you do a lot of people love you all kinds of people and yet we're in a country where we're seeing a debate over who really is American and whether people who are trying to get here should be mistreated as a quote deterrent as a tool of US government policy walk us through how you view this well I think I think there's a there's a misconception and I think what you guys were talking about earlier I think was very relevant to this topic because there is a pivot there is a pivot that happens on a daily basis when you're when you're telling a story and what you're broadcasting news right and and and what happens is that they're they're blurring the lines of what if the word immigration really means right they're making it sound like there's this problem it's just issue you know I think also I think that there's another blurry line where they think that you know politics are not human issues human issues are not politics right so so the the biggest issue is is is that we we are we are looking at this group of individuals coming to America as of a percentage as of a group of people as opposed to actual individuals people that have a family and I think that that's that's I think that's the biggest misconception and I think why people are so torn and how they feel about this conversation that they're so far removed from so it's hard for people to have an actual opinion when they're not necessarily you know affected directly or indirectly by it you know when really they were to really understand that there's there's more they can relate to this then then they actually have have understood I wonder how you feel artists can engage this because a lot of politics is everyone has the right to come down where they do and any big hit show like yours any big movies gonna have people of all views watching it and yet we're also talking about whether we're gonna continue to deal with ethical and moral lines as a nation Fox News has gotten a lot of criticism for the way they've de humor knives some people in this now their talent is slamming some of their coverage I'll read to you Judd Apatow saying they're promoting evil ideas another Fox talent says they's disgusted to work at a company that has anything to do with Fox News Seth MacFarlane saying he's embarrassed by this what do you think is the role of artists who have such a following in this debate I think it's important that we block the you know the pivot of the conversation in instead of making the politics not to not forget these are human issues and a lot of people are very cynic about about artists no musicians athletes and and everyone getting involved in this in this national conversation but we you know let's not forget that we're are also human beings and that we are people that have a story that really not only resembles but parallels the people that are in this border and the 2,000 kids that came here with a hope right so you know you look at what you can do you know from from the specific your platform is to continue to hel accountable the story what really is truly happening and not let the pivot create some kind of decisive undecided thought where all of a sudden this issue slows down and it becomes one more of the things of the laundry list that we have to address with an administration that unfortunately you know sees that this was a very hard thing to pivot and this was a very very difficult thing to tell a world a planet right and specifically the United States that this is something you shouldn't feel right so so what can we do it together is that we have to hold them accountable we have to put pressure and we have to have them give us a timeline and when these families are going to be reunited because this is the other thing the other thing that's very unique is that this executive order doesn't mean that you know that the oh that means the new arrivals are just going to be now kept in the same cage well stay with me stay with him because you're talking about the policy piece and we want to do something here to bridge the conversation I want you to stay with me I want to bring in congresswoman for me jeyapaul who visited attention Center in Washington State for moms separated from their children she's working as well on these June 30th protests and so to the point I was just discussing with Wilmer I want to read something else that another artist has said a comedian but again these are stories that go across politics and policy Billy Eichner who's been a big critic of Donald Trump said something that I think cuts to the heart of the car woman he wrote this we'll always now be the administration ripped children away from their parents even children with mental disabilities they didn't stop until shouted at from every corner of the globe telling them they are inhumane that is who they are and they'll do it again congresswoman your view of that point and and as Wilmers with us what it means for artists and others to be speaking out not as a political matter but as they argue as a moral matter well I think I completely agree with that it is not a political matter it is not a policy matter it really is a question of right and wrong and I said that on the floor today with the rule I spoke on the rule around the Ryan bill because what this president has done and what I saw at the Federal Detention Center is actually a federal prison in talking to these women is these are asylum seekers they are people who are seeking a better life they have made tragic tragic choices because they had to one woman who left her blind child at home and brought her other child to safety because she had to at least save one of them another woman whose eldest son had been shot and killed by gangs second son shot and paralyzed by gangs and finally took the third child again to try to bring that child to safety and to see these children being stripped away from their parents these women told me that children as young as one year old that they had been taken away they haven't talked to their kids and so I think humanizing this issue as your previous speaker said and having our cultural icons around the around the globe frankly not just the country say to us that America you are better than this let me play for you because I want to get you in Willmar on this let me play you and others who spoke out as as early as before this was the top news story in all fairness the news response to what's out there take a look they wept every single time they talked about their children the mothers were literally sitting in a room next to where the children were being held and could hear their children screaming what country is that this is a United States of America my younger brother left back in Japan never really recovered from the trauma of his separation from his mother's and his siblings my mother always had deep sorrow about having to leave her baby behind how important is it for political leaders and others to bear witness so that the nation can respond first to you congresswoman it is really important for us to bear witness but we are also the ones I'm an immigrant myself one of only 12 members of Congress including senator Hirono who were born outside of the United States and so to hear people including the President of the United States talk about immigrants by conflating everybody gang members in talking using words like infest is so humiliating to who we are as a country and I think that is what people are responding to that this isn't a political issue my office has been flooded with calls from Republicans and Democrats across the country not just in my district saying thank you stand up for this I may not agree with you on other things but I do agree with you on this we should not treat children this way and that is why you know I work to organize this mass protest on the June 30th with move on and the National Domestic Workers Alliance we're now up to over 300 groups 380 events on June 30th around the country over 300,000 people that have already signed up to come and a huge protest here in Washington DC because it is outrageous that this President created this crisis he implemented the zero tolerance policy that is why we are seeing what we are seeing he can lift up the phone and call Jeff Sessions and end it it does not need an executive order and he didn't actually reverse the policy no you know what he's doing right now is saying let's just indefinitely detain in prison camps re families that's what we're gonna do who thinks incarceration of children is a solution to what we're dealing with that's just a bug and he needs to reverse it right and that's why there's so much left even with the new order wilmer your views as you was watching there the clips including senator Hirono talking about what her family went through you know I've told my story so many times I I put we should never forget to put on this is not it is beyond a matter of like just where somebody else's shoes and you know this is this is this is the moment where we have been called to be there for a fellow human for a fellow brother and a sister who seeks exactly what everyone for multiple generations have come to this country to seek the exact same thing there's no difference between those families live you know detained by the way who's looking out for our children who is making sure they're they're warm at night who's bathing them who's watching them bathe like we don't have any information about how they're being treated so that's why there's an urgency to reunite is you know this kids with with with the families I think it's our responsibility to not to not let down not now quiet down in not to it's now look at this executive order as most are going to look like well he already sign it what else do you guys want know there is there is a timeline that we need to see when this 2,000 kids are going to be reunited with their kids there's kids and there's there's young men and women dying in this cages because they haven't gotten the proper the proper care you know so you know like like the rally day and in Washington water Latino is is organizing one Antonio Texas why with the where the actual tent cities are being built and we're bringing electric officials and and you know human rights advocates and and and religious leaders to go out there and put the pressure in the amount of time when and where we're gonna reunite everyone again the truth the matter is said this is the type of things that if we let them cool down you know then they have now a recipe to get away right this kind of that that we're not gonna be able to stop so everyone has to really put in it put it and put some thoughts and put some hours and do this hey
