of them seemingly bland but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of turn</font>

into beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of elaborations on</font>

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,409
this couple story it follows a very

fragmented<font color="#E5E5E5"> story of a couple then second</font>

person generators<font color="#E5E5E5"> always talking from I</font>

to you so the example would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,420
one in the beam section we spoke I was

43
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,380
the one who said we should live together

44
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,270
and even as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

45
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,560
it would mean that I would be the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

myself at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if it went wrong the last</font>

48
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,530
thing I care about was who was to blame

49
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,170
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in together corrode the I</font>

50
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,490
spent all this time building a

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,200
relationship then one like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

52
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's graphic tuber</font>

53
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,439
they'll switching them having like a

54
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,390
pretty destructive argument to very

55
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,549
small pockets and windows into their

56
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,380
kind of like just exchanges so this is

57
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,180
just this this entry just called me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

58
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,100
ER but it's just the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very</font>

59
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,630
anecdotal exchange about them talking

<font color="#E5E5E5">about tainted love the words that</font>

61
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,540
tainted love you have you on board this

62
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think the concept pubs you just have</font>

63
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,479
to be on board<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the format and</font>

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,799
accept it and not be like all they're

65
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,719
pushing it now it's contrived or don't

66
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,189
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a little organic but I feel</font>

67
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,299
I feel like this muscle grown-ups

68
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,340
organically<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the story just fit</font>

69
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,229
with its format rather than link forth

70
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,360
into it no square pegs in round holes

71
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't beautiful somebody</font>

72
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,450
you phony<font color="#E5E5E5"> planless I think you might be</font>

73
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,220
David lezdom probably well he did write

74
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,450
it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> partner I don't want to give too</font>

75
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,980
much away those who love a kind of

76
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,140
poetic writing style and are willing to

77
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of put their faith in the format I</font>

78
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,890
think it is like a blue valentine of

79
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,690
literature like it's beautiful and I

80
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,160
think you've got like good press and

81
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,900
when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was first published but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

82
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,070
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that much about</font>

83
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,320
anymore but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably one of my</font>

84
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,760
favorite books now like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

85
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,260
assumedly finished I just wanted to read

86
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it again and it's really fast to read</font>

87
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> books</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only like 200 pages but</font>

88
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,020
obviously a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more pages Colin empty</font>

89
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,060
so it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> took me one train ride and it</font>

90
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,680
was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most heartbreaking turn</font>

91
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,230
around remember god i rarely publicly

92
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,920
cried last time I cried at book was way

93
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,750
to live forever by selling nickels on a

94
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,940
bus Ivan has to route to review it's

95
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,500
very very hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain but hey is</font>

96
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,630
loaf I week we can we can be incompetent

97
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,750
and reviewing thing it's not why at all

98
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,150
but it is kind of great crossover if you

99
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't notice about jumping from way</font>

100
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,390
to general fiction this is a good bridge

101
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,100
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> David Levithan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a massive</font>

102
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,040
role of like brown packing tape measure

103
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,239
the whole freaking thing out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

104
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,670
floor stuck on end down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is slowly</font>

105
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,580
backing away from the storyline like

106
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,950
laying it out for you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's started</font>

107
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,840
at the end worked backwards and made all

108
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,670
things perfect from that point it saw

109
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,010
someone the most realistic depictions of

110
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,750
a relationship that I've read in live in

111
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,060
in a long time also also kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels</font>

112
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person I almost didn't want to</font>

113
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,940
review this and then say that this is

114
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,799
closest to my periods of low because

115
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,000
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll fill out your reader you'll</font>

116
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,959
know all my friends of love is like okay

117
00:03:42,959 --> 00:00:00,000
folks I made it
