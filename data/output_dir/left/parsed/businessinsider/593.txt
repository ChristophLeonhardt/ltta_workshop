Poland joined the Security Council at a
very critical time it's a critical time
frankly for the world because you see
what's going on not only must we secure
our nations from the threat of terrorism
but we must also confront the threat
from North Korea and that's what it is
it's a threat and we will confront it
very strongly president Duda and I call
on all nations to confront this global
threat and publicly demonstrate to North
Korea that there are consequences for
their very very bad behavior
