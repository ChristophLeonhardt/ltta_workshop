a woman allegedly shot a homeless man after he asked her to move her Porsche that's the story we're doing next 26 year-old Katie Quackenbush who describes herself as a honky-tonk rock and roll singer from Texas outlaw country was in her car with a female passenger when she got into a confrontation with Gerald Melton or Melton near music row in Nashville on October 26th so according to the report Melton a 54 year old homeless man quote was trying to sleep on the sidewalk at 3:00 a.m. when he became disturbed by exhaust fumes and loud music coming from a Porsche SUV police said in a press release so after that it seems like it's a disputed case over what happened but the police say that after the argument she shot him and then left the scene her father who is also her lawyer disagrees according to her father quote she warned him to stay away and told him she had a gun she then fired a warning shot but he kept coming so he fired another quote warning shot he said he said that his daughter and her friend quote had no clue that she had hit Melton which is why they drove away and went to eat breakfast later so a full story also includes statements from the father that say that this that Melton was actually an aggressive person as noted by multiple businesses around the area but he had not actually been charged with anything nor had any official complaints been fired according to the report filed according to the report and however for Quackenbush the daughter that is not the case she has two misdemeanor assault charges against her in the past one quote in December she was charged with misdemeanor assault causing bodily injury in Texas for allegedly striking a woman in the head with a drinking glass which her father downplayed as actually she saw the new girlfriend of her ex-husband and they got in an argument and she resorted to violence is her father like her official press he's her lawyer mr. Quackenbush but she's pretty outlaw country okay well this is unfortunate and look we don't know exactly how it went down and you know you do have businesses in the area saying that this homeless person is somewhat aggressive and you know to be quite honest with you there's a growing problem in the country of first of all the homeless population it's exploded over the last few years and also homeless people who have severe mental disabilities and need help right we don't help them we ignore them and the problem will continue to grow and we're gonna continue pretending like it doesn't exist until we will be forced to address it and so I don't know no one knows exactly how it all went down there her record doesn't look good but this is what happens you know when you live in a society that just arms anyone and everyone by the way what does is she legally in possession of a gun considering the fact that she had criminal charges regarding assault it doesn't say in the reports I found whether she was convicted of and the other misdemeanor charge was for assaulting her mother but those charges were dropped so well she could have legally possessed the firearm but according to the police report the man did not impede her ability to leave the area exactly it's a he said she said in terms of what went down in the altercation he said there was a first lien on physical interaction where he aggressively according to her side said racially charged epithets at her and was aggressive and was coming toward her and she said go away but the whole warning shot and not knowing what happened I don't know but but you know that's all speculation but this is a good opportunity to bring up issues like how difficult it is when you have people who in by whatever circumstance rendered them homeless and a lot of them are in need of mental counseling and in the court it's difficult because some of there's a lot of times not enough resources or legal authority for the prosecution and the legal system to actually mandate that these people who need mental counseling go get mental counseling yeah if you're an adult and you might have a mental health condition it's it is hard you know you're an adult so it's it's actually kind of difficult to force that individual to go get the help that they need but you know I think the bigger problem is the fact that people can't afford mental health care and the issue of mental health care comes up specifically when there's a mass shooting and people want to use that excuse as the scapegoat for that shooting they don't want to talk about gun legislation they just want to find another thing to blame and it is a real problem and we need to give Americans the health care that they need that and that includes physical healthcare and mental health care so they don't end up in in terrible positions like this help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
