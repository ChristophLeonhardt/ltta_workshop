there's an actual trial of trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort now if you know anything about Paul Manafort you know he's been part of the swamp and Washington for a long long time he had close working ties with Hillary Clinton's campaign managers of foundation the Podesta group he funneled money from them to John Podesta's brother Tony which is why Tony Podesta is no longer at that organization and so it's a big net and once you start prosecuting that you see that if that's why they call it a swamp because guys like Trump's campaign manager are literally working shoulder-to-shoulder with Hillary Clinton's campaign manager foundation so now they're going so now they're gonna prosecute Paul manna for it so you like oh my god I guess we're gonna find out all about this collusion and this treason they've been investigating this guy for two years and Trump's campaign they're such nincompoops I bet they're leaving Clues all over the place and evidence right so let's watch here if you go to my computer there it is says Paul Manafort wants trial move to Roanoke says Northern Virginia is too liberal so that's the headline in the Washington Post so what I want to show you is I'm going to show you how long the article is because they bury the lead as far as I'm concerned they buried the lead yeah the articles all this discussion of you know he the the prosecutors want the the trial in DC and his lawyers are saying no DC is too liberal he wants in Virginia City can't get a fair trial in DC because they all hate Trump in Virginia they love Trump and so are the more people left it's all about that sort of it's heavy it's a bit it's a really long article heavy in detail and it's also a heavy in detail all the charges except watch what's not one of the charges so I'm going to show you how long this article isn't this video here we go a long article you see all that stuff man afford that draw the federal district court the thing that that thing that this the bank they saw and then look at this paragraph look at this paragraph the government does not intend to present at trial evidence or argument concerning collusion with the Russian government says assistant US attorney I read that again the government does not intend to present at trial evidence or argument concerning collusion with the Russian government did you see how law long it took for them to get to that in that article did you see how long it took them to get to that that should be the headline of that article as far as I'm concerned because when everyone sees that Paul man affords because you know that 60% of the people don't read past the headline so when people see that headline they're like Oh trumps go up front Trump's campaign managers going to trial for collusion with Russia that's what it looks like that's what it looks like they're not if you're gonna bring that up to me that's the headline in that article what do you think about that Steve what would that so what is he gonna try for so here's how sweet prosecutors have said that they will present evidence that a banker helped man afford obtain a 16 million dollars in loans because he hoped to get a position in the Trump administration that's what they're gonna charge him with regular current what that's what this whole investigation is about are you kidding so by the way if you put a prosecutor on anybody in Washington DC they will find illegal do it they will find corruption like this they will find shady business deals they put a prosecutor on Bill Clinton and guess what happened they impeached him that's what happens when you put a prosecutor and somebody who's been working in the swamp their whole life but that was there was a land deal in Arkansas yeah shady land deal they put the prosecutor and that's what he was impeached over right turns out no he was impeached over something totally unrelated to that what like sex what could be and here's Paul Manafort being he was being investigated because of the collusion with the Russian government in treason and now we're giving him because some banker gave him a loan because he wanted to get influence in the Trump camp and that amazing here's what else they say in short the defendants role with the Trump campaign is relevant and inextricably intertwined with the bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy charges here it would be difficult for the jury to understand why the loans were approved without understanding that the lender approved the loans in spite of the identified deficiencies because the senior executives factored in his own mob blah blah blah that's all this CC k CC k that's what that is the real story is that this is about regular corruption and some people are saying well of course Jimmy he's not gonna charge him with treason yet he doesn't want to tip his hand on how he's gonna project it's been two years two years when is this treason evidence gonna present itself it's never going to present itself and do you know why I know that because the former director of the CIA admitted it he said if there was evidence it would have already been leaked and the fact that it hasn't been leaked and that ever reporter from New York to Los Angeles has been trying to find a connection and evidence of it and they haven't means there probably isn't that was the former director of the CIA who admitted that again that was buried in an article in box just like this was buried that statement was buried almost in the last paragraph so this is how your government does propaganda just so you know this is how the news media aids your government in doing propaganda this is a paper owned by Jeff Bezos whose Trump's tax cut just gave him billions more dollars well I think that it there there in addition of what you point I was about this article as like to underscore what you said also earlier about the how widespread corruption is and that you could investigate almost anybody in Washington and you know probably a lot of other places rich people in general invested and won't you investigate that Clinton Foundation but but it even aside from the political implications that there is so much white-collar crime going on in America that is unprosecuted nobody ever investigates and but you know if you're if you're a kid in New York 16 years old who gets accused of stealing a bad man and they put you in Rikers Island for three years and you commit suicide those crimes that you know they're gonna pursue those crimes and this Atheneum so he jumped a turnstile in a subway they'll call a helicopter over you but it literally did that but so I mean so when they talk about draining the swamp like the upper echelon the 1% you know it it's endemic and there's the they're all guilty of something there's so much and well we know the SEC is underfunded I mean the the you know the the investigated since you know certainly George Bush but even before then you know we're just not interested in prosecuting and it's what what Trump is doing with the IRS the IRS is not going to have to rich people now either I mean you're you're given a pass basically and Paul Manafort mistake was getting involved in the Trump administration in the first place because he had expose it yeah you know all the corruption the Cohn was involved and he was fine they were all doing fine and everybody was without they were they're gonna just live off this gravy train and Trump's campaign was gonna do them good cuz Trump was gonna lose yeah but it would still access give them access to a lot more money yeah and then he won and they're like oh yeah and now now the spotlight is on us yes but you should shine that's probably almost anywhere and you're gonna expose this sort of thing yeah well also the other problem is that this obsession with the Russian angle diminishes the importance of going after corruption mm-hmm so this guy's guilty of corruption and there's corruption all over well let's go through the corruption why didn't his sexy it up more with the Russian angle I mean if the prosecutors themselves are not going to pursue it then why do we need to pursue it in the media we've come to another end of the aggressive progressives but you haven't heard the end there's a lot more to this show and you can get it earlier when it actually drops so the news is timely what do
