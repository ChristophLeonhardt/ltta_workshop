1
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,570
so it's got there's obviously tons of

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,310
forms of media you've got novels you've

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,080
got films you got commercials you've got

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,960
drawings you've got what is rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">gallatin and how have you sort of</font>

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">openness up to the transmedia world for</font>

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,220
lack of a better term well<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rinnegan is</font>

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,470
our first internally produced

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,430
intellectual property and it is a

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,079
fantasy<font color="#CCCCCC"> world that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was originally</font>

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,239
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us we open it up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,309
community and it is a multimedia world

13
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,690
in the sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we offer people the</font>

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,149
option of submitting fiction<font color="#E5E5E5"> our role</font>

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,710
playing game materials comics

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,570
essentially any medium that can be

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,610
digitized and put up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,050
take submissions and we'll put the best

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,780
up on the web it's our first property to

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,550
demonstrate the potential of the model

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,039
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was purposefully done in a way</font>

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was an extremely an extreme version</font>

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,480
of the model we wanted to push the

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">envelope in every direction is possible</font>

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,860
to see if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a break so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far we</font>

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,630
haven't found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to be true so we used</font>

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,210
to extreme version what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean</font>

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">like what is extreme so this is ruins of</font>

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,189
gallatin and what is not strength well

30
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,020
the base<font color="#E5E5E5"> model the brain candy has is</font>

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,960
flexible scalable we can scope it to

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,729
meet the goals of whatever the property

33
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,130
owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen whatever goals interested</font>

34
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,020
in parties they happen have so for

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,270
example ownership model the revenue

36
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,369
aspect of the model those types of

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,860
things can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be adjusted to base to meet</font>

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> property owner bruins a</font>

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,460
gallon on what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was say how do we</font>

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,320
make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as extreme as possible how do</font>

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">we make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as friendly to the community</font>

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,470
as possible so what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,259
you create a novel you create some piece

44
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,659
of art or an image you submitted we post

45
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,700
it under the ruins of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gallon on model</font>

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,920
you retain ownership over that we don't

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,110
purchase rights under any circumstances

48
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,170
what we do is say we will exchange

49
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,979
non-exclusive commercial rates which

50
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,110
means you as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> creator can continue to</font>

51
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,670
make money<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it and we just ask that</font>

52
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,740
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> show revenue with us and the same is</font>

53
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,530
true for us and that particular model we

54
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,140
think is very artisan friendly we also

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,758
say from a revenue<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint under</font>

56
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,489
erisa gallatin we split money at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50-50</font>

57
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,850
gross level as a

58
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,010
to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's on the net side now</font>

59
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,360
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something we would propose</font>

60
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,490
for most properties it's certainly not

61
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,230
something we propose for a large media

62
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,610
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it just goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font>

63
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,680
that with<font color="#E5E5E5"> very little marketing this</font>

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,480
particular model can work we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

65
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,580
getting submissions for over a year now

66
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,230
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting them up online and</font>

67
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,670
the community has shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interest in</font>

68
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,960
playing this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> world under</font>

69
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,330
these terms so walk me through I'm a

70
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,230
player or I am in this world and I i do

71
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,800
what i read this i decided i like a

72
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,630
secondary character i draw a picture of

73
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">them i submit it like how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does this work</font>

74
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,120
well you've got two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

75
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,930
participants in the world you've got

76
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,730
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pure consumers who come to the</font>

77
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,920
site read fiction look at the art and

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,900
they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away then you've got others who</font>

79
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,010
are more active they might participate

80
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,720
in the forum they might contribute to

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,310
the wiki they might actually create a

82
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,050
new work and submit it to the world so

83
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,670
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you stumble across a</font>

84
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,830
particular art image and you say oh

85
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a great idea for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a story i'm</font>

86
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,920
going to write a story based on that art

87
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,810
image or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read a fictional work by</font>

88
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,360
some other artisan<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say i really like</font>

89
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,400
this minor character i'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explore</font>

90
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,900
what's happening with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that character and</font>

91
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,030
under the ruins of gallatin model that's

92
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally fine you're not infringing the</font>

93
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,840
copyright law when you grab that<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor</font>

94
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,820
character you write<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own fiction</font>

95
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,680
turn around assume that that derivative

96
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,110
work back to brain candy we evaluate

97
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,460
that and if it's really good we put it

98
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,860
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the website so my revenue could be</font>

99
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,540
endless I mean if you have all these

100
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,930
factions of people sprouting off and and

101
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,460
contributing their own work and then

102
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,530
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody riff off of what you've</font>

103
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,810
done I mean the revenue model seems to

104
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,660
just sort of grow exponentially well it

105
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,100
certainly can and again it's obvious

106
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,650
content is absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that the</font>

107
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,880
whole purpose of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to have a</font>

108
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">constant stream of content coming in</font>

109
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,200
that the property<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can decide what to</font>

110
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,630
put up what not to put up and they're

111
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,460
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that constant stream of</font>

112
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,140
content continually build out the

113
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,200
property basically give the fans more we

114
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,240
more ways and means to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage with the</font>

115
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">property over a persistent time period</font>

116
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it can be as simple as a derivative</font>

117
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,590
work like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said a fictional word based</font>

118
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,690
on an artwork by someone else it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

119
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,238
pretty complex you could have 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 12</font>

120
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">or 15 artisans all playing with the same</font>

121
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,480
character

122
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,250
working in the same city with their

123
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,560
particular medium and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

124
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,180
part of the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to make it as</font>

125
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,320
collaborative and integrative as

126
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,140
possible but almost seems like what

127
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,300
works here would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a great model for</font>

128
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,590
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would work in the offline world</font>

129
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,800
like are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you seeing stories or what not</font>

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,780
working this world that have translated

131
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,840
offline does it go digital to analog I

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,450
mean is that translate at all absolutely

133
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,860
I mean the whole point here is that you

134
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,360
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple revenue streams</font>

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,280
beyond just advertising so what you want

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,530
to do in a digital will say let's look

137
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,630
at the most popular works in the

138
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,400
property whether it's a novel<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a</font>

139
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,440
collection of art let's bundle them up

140
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,960
and offer them in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> analog revenue</font>

141
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,090
sharing type model so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example rather</font>

142
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,980
than say let's give spend millions of

143
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,780
dollars in<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show and hope that</font>

144
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,510
people like it in the digital website

145
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,980
you're looking at it going<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm</font>

146
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at the highest</font>

147
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,100
downloaded novel or the most looked at

148
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,440
art I'll bundle them all up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll offer</font>

149
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,540
through a traditional print offering and

150
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,190
I'll saw it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way because i know this</font>

151
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,110
is already the most popular content in

152
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,840
the property so how where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

153
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,570
this extreme model fitting in to say the

154
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,880
entertainment world well the extreme

155
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,120
model is probably not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be it</font>

156
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,620
probably won't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a box chain</font>

157
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,690
