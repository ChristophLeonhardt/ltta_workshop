>> Reporter: WELL, IT IS DARK 

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,105
HERE IN JOHANNESBURG. 

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:07,741
VERY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT. 

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,409
THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN FAINTLY 

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:13,346
MAKE OUT THE MOON AS IT PASSES 

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,281
THROUGH THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE 

7
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:16,983
AND THAT SHADOW IS CAST ONTO 

8
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:17,717
THE MAN. 

9
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,619
CAN FAINTLY MAKE IT OUT. 

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,290
IT IS NOT COMPLETE BLACKNESS. 

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,057
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GATHERED 

12
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:25,992
AND IT IS EXCITING TO WITNESS 

13
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:26,960
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,128
A LITTLE WHILE AGO IT WAS MORE 

15
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:34,868
RED AND THAT OF COURSE ELICITED 

16
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,602
GAS AND EXCITEMENT AND SOME 

17
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,105
PEOPLE STARTED HOWLING AT THE 

18
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:39,772
MOON. 

19
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:41,006
>> I LIKE THAT, HOWLING AT THE 

20
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,443
MOON. 

21
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,410
HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST WITH 

22
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,080
THE RED TONE THAT WE SEE NOW? 

23
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,015
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE LONGEST

24
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,886
LUNAR ECLIPSE OF THE 21st 

25
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,152
CENTURY. 

26
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,688
IT WILL TAKE ONE HOUR AND 43 

27
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:59,459
MINUTES. 

28
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,193
THE RED WILL NOT LAST THAT 

29
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:00,426
LONG. 

30
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:01,361
IT IS STARTING TO FADE A LITTLE 

31
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,228
BIT NOW. 

32
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,429
THAT IS AS IT MOVES OUT OF THE 

33
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:04,263
ATMOSPHERE AND YOU WILL SEE IT 

34
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:07,567
LESS AND LESS THE BEST PART HAS 

35
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,801
ALREADY HAPPENED FOR PEOPLE 

36
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,704
HERE. 

37
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,371
>> YOU'RE AT THE PLANETARIUM, 

38
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,240
SO I WOULD IMAGINE THERE ARE A 

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,241
LOT OF PEOPLE THERE WITH YOU. 

40
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,509
YOU SAID SOME PEOPLE WERE 

41
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,180
GASPING AND HOWLING AT THE MOON.

42
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,681
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE WITH 

43
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,983
YOU? 

44
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,420
>> Reporter: A COUPLE HUNDRED. 

45
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,888
THEY SET UP TELESCOPES AND 

46
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,390
EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT THEM. 

47
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,625
PEOPLE HAVE MADE THIS INTO A 

48
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,429
HUGE OUTING. 

49
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,030
THIS FAMILY BROUGHT THEIR 

50
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,797
CHILDREN WHO SAID THEY WOULD 

51
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,700
RATHER WATCH THE MOON GO READ 

52
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,734
THEN GO TO A PARTY. 

53
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,604
AND THIS BEING MODERN TIMES, 

54
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,805
EVERYONE IS TRYING TO TAKE A 

55
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,809
SELF THE WITH THE MOON. 

56
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,676
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT IS 

57
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:51,077
WORKING OUT. 

58
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:51,811
IT IS QUITE HARD TO GET 

59
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,145
LOGISTICALLY. 

60
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,212
EVERYONE IS DOING THEIR SULCI 

61
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:54,714

SOCIAL MEDIA SITE THEY ARE

69
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,359
WE ARE LOOKING AT A VERY CLEAR 

70

00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:10,930
JOHANNESBURG. 

72
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,333
AS YOU ARE AS WELL, AS THE SKY 

73
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,704
AND THE WEATHER OPERATED? 

74
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,574
-- COOPERATED? 

75
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,442
>> Reporter: IT HAS. 

76
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,109
THIS IS WINTER IN SOUTH AFRICA, 

77
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:28,047
SO IT IS COLD FOR US HERE. 

78
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:28,714
WHAT THAT MEANS IN JOHANNESBURG 

79
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,783
IS THAT WE HAVE CLEAR SKIES. 

80
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,285
THERE IS NO RAIN DURING THE 

81
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:32,652
WINTER SEASON. 

82
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,587
WE HAVE THESE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR 

83
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,855
SKIES. 

84
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,558
NO CLOUDS, IT COULD NOT BE MORE 

85
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,426
PERFECT WEATHER CONDITIONS. 

86
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:40,859
THIS IS A CITY. 

87
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:45,164
IT IS NOT EVEN THE BEST VIEW IN 

88
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:45,932
SOUTH AFRICA, BECAUSE THE MORE 

89
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,066
YOU MOVE AWAY FROM THE CITY, 

90
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,169
THE BETTER THE IMAGE IS. 

91
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,704
EVEN IN THE CITY, IT HAS BEEN 

92
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,104
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. 

93
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:53,373
EVERYONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO COME 

94
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,275
OUTSIDE ONTO THEIR BALCONIES 

95
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,743
AND GARDENS, OR COME TO A 

96
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,843
PUBLIC PLACE LIKE THE 

97
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,013
PLANETARIUM AND GET THIS ONCE-

00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,814
IN-A-LIFETIME, ONCE IN A 

99
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,250
CENTURY OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS 

100
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,752
LONGEST LUNAR ECLIPSE. 

101
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:07,987
NEXT TO THE MOON YOU ALSO HAVE 

102
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,989
THE SMALL LITTLE ORANGE BLOB, 

103
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,192
AND THAT IS MARS WHICH IS THE 

104
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,227
CLOSEST IT HAS BEEN TO THE 

105
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,095
EARTH IN 15 YEARS. 

106
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,197
SO IT REALLY IS A TREAT FOR 

107
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,031
PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT. 

108
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:22,669
>> YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH MANY 

109
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,670
ASTRONOMERS AND SCIENTISTS 

110
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,571
ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON. 

111
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,539
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU, AND 

112
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,575
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR? 

113
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,312
>> Reporter: WHAT IS UNIQUE 

114
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,148
ABOUT THIS, EVERYTHING HAS TO 

115
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,951
BE IN PERFECT ALIGNMENT. 

116
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,585
YOU HAVE THE MOON, THE EARTH, 

117
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:39,986
AND THE SUN. 

118
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:44,190
IT CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN IT IS A 

119
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,557
FULL MOON. 

120
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,090
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WHEN 

121
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,724
EVERYTHING IS IN ALIGNMENT, 

122
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,694
THAT IS WHEN YOU GET A TOTAL 

123
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,061
LUNAR ECLIPSE. 

124
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,661
WHY EVERYONE IS EXCITED IS 

125
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,763
BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT SEE IT FOR 

126
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:54,434
THIS LONG FOR ANOTHER 100 

127
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:54,667
YEARS. 

128
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,402
THERE WILL BE MORE ECLIPSES. 

129
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,104
I THINK THAT IS WHAT HAS GOT 

130
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:58,804
EVERYBODY EXCITED HERE IN SOUTH 

131
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:03,810
AFRICA AND OF COURSE ACROSS THE 

132
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,444
REST OF THE CONTINENT. 

133
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,077
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING 

134
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:05,844
FOR, THE PERFECT ALIGNMENT. 

135
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,213
AS THE MOON PASSES THROUGH THE 

136
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:11,450
SHADOW IT IS CAST ONTO THE MOON 

137
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,251
AND LITTLE BITS OF THE SUN 

138
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,786
CREEP THROUGH AND YOU GET THIS 

139
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,921
RED LIGHT. 

140
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,622
THAT IS WHERE YOU GET THE 

141
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:19,325
NICKNAME, BLOOD MOON. 

142
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,728
IT CAPTURES THE THRILL THAT 

143
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:23,796
EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES HERE. 

144
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:27,700
YOU DO NOT OFTEN SEE A MAN THIS 

145
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:27,933
COLOR. 

146
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,735
THEY ARE ALSO LOOK FOR THE MOON 

147
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,503
BEING THE FURTHEST FROM THE 

148
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:34,039
PLANET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 

149
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,309
YEAR WE HAD THE SUPER BLUE MOON 

150
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,476
AND IT WAS BIGGER. 

151
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:40,413
TONIGHT, IT IS KNOWN AS A MICRO 

152
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,514
MOON. 

153
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,750
IT IS FAR AWAY, BUT BEAUTIFULLY 

154
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,017
LIT UP AND READ. 

155
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:48,821
>> DEBORAH, YOU SPOKE WITH 

156
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,757
EXPERTS WHO SPOKE ABOUT TE 

157
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,760
MEANING OF THESE MOONS TO BRING 

158
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,893
-- PREINDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES. 

159
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,029
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE SCIENCE 

160
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,268
THAT WE HAVE TODAY. 

161
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:02,901
WHAT WERE THE SIGNS THAT THESE 

162
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,103
SOCIETIES USE TO ATTRIBUTE TO 

163
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,172
THE BLOOD MOON? 

164
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,340
>> Reporter: YOU CAN IMAGINE IT 

165
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,910
WAS TERRIFYING IN ANCIENT TIMES.

166
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,212
THE MOON WOULD DISAPPEAR OR 

167
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,516
TURN RED. 

168
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,517
IF YOU TOLD TIME BY THE MOON OR 

169
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,785
WORSHIP TO THE MOON, THIS WAS 

170
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,085
TERRIFYING. 

171
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,286
A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THE 

172
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:20,887
GODS WERE ANGRY. 

173
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,120
THE INCA BELIEVED THAT THE 

174
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,556
JAGUAR WAS EATING THE MOON. 

175
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,926
THEY WOULD GATHER OUTSIDE AND 

176
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,094
BANGING POTS AND MAKE THEIR 

177
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,395
DOGS HOW TO CHASE THE JAGUAR 

178
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,198
AWAY. IN OTHER PARTS THEY 

179
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,967
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A DIRECT 

180
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,135
ATTACK ON THE KING, AND YOU 

181
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,037
WOULD GET A PROXY KING WHO 

182
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,006
WOULD SIT ON THE THRONE DURING 

183
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,675
THE TIME OF A LUNAR ECLIPSE TO 

184
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,010
ENSURE THAT THE KING WAS NOT 

185
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,277
ATTACKED. 

186
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,346
A LOT OF ANCIENT BELIEFS -- FOR 

187
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,915
MOST PEOPLE IT SIGNIFIED DROUGHT

188
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,750
OR TERRIBLE WEATHER OR 

189
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,419
SOMETHING AWFUL, IT WAS NEVER A 

190
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,787
GOOD SIGN. 

191
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,290
NOW WE KNOW WITH PRECISION WHEN 

192
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,724
IT WILL OCCUR. 

193
00:05:58,724 --> 00:05:59,992
IT IS NOT TERRIFYING, JUST 

194
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,862
EXCITING AND A CHANCE TO TAKE A 

195
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,096
SOPHIE. 

196
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,030
>> I CAN IMAGINE HOW TERRIFYING 

197
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,232
IT MUST HAVE BEEN. 

198
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,100
ONE OF THE THINGS EXPERTS SAY 

199
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,504
IS THAT SCIENTISTS KNEW THIS 

200
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:13,606
WOULD HAPPEN AND HOW LONG IT 

201
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,474
WOULD LAST THAT THEY DID NOT 

202
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:19,111
KNOW THE EXACT YOU THAT THE 

203
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:21,814
MOON WOULD TAKE ON. 

204
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,448
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE 

205
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,918
COLOR FROM THERE? 

206
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:26,886
WE SEE THE MONITOR, SO WE DON'T 

207
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,254
SEE THE SAME COLOR THAT THE 

208
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,088
WITH THE NAKED EYE. 

209
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,157
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT YOU 

210
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,394
MARK -- HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE 

211
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:34,594
IT? 

212
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:39,098
>> Reporter: YOU DON'T NEED A 

213
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:39,866
TELESCOPE, AT ITS PEAK IT WAS 

214
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,233
CERTAINLY RED. 

215
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,034
NOT BRIGHT RED, YOU HAVE THE 

216
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:47,072
SHADOW OVER IT, AND WE ARE IN 

217
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:47,807
JOHANNESBURG, SO THERE IS AN 

218
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,375
AMOUNT OF POLLUTION AND DEBRIS 

219
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,911
OR DUST. 

220
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,012
WE DO NOT HAVE CLOUD COVER, SO 

221
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,413
IT IS ONE OF HIS RIGHTIST HERE, 

222
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,850
AND THE MORE YOU MOVE AWAY FROM 

223
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,885
THE CITY LIGHTS, WE WERE 

224
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,052
SPEAKING TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY 

225
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:04,457
WHO WERE FAR AWAY IN A FARMING 

226
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,224
COMMUNITY AND THEY SAW A MUCH 

227
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,526
BRIGHTER RED IN. 

228
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,361
BUT, EVEN FOR US IN 

229
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,762
JOHANNESBURG, IT WAS VERY RED 

230
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:14,133
AT ITS PEAK. 

231
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,502
>> THANK YOU. 

232
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,237
>>> HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS 

233
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,574
COSMIC PHENOMENON IS A KEEN, HE 

234
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:26,511
IS A PROFESSOR OF SPACE SCIENCE 

235
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,047
AT THE FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF 

236
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:28,347
TECHNOLOGY. 

237
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,982
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 

238
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,185
CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR US WHAT IS 

239
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,454
HAPPENING? 

240
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:35,687
>> YES. 

241
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,289
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EARTH AT ALL 

242
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,259
TIMES, BECAUSE IT IS ORBITING 

243
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,962
THE SUN, IT HAS A LONG SHADOW 

244
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,096
THAT EXTENDS OUT FROM IT. 

245
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,766
THE MOON IS VERY FAR AWAY. 

246
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,633
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISTANCE 

247
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,135
FROM THE CENTER OF THE EARTH TO 

248
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,203
THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH -- THE 

249
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:54,273
MOON IS ABOUT 65 EARTH RADII 

250
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:58,110
AWAY. 

251
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,678
IT IS VERY FAR. 

252
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,278
AND, WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT 

253
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,379
NOW IS THAT THE MOON IS AT HIS 

254
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,714
FURTHEST WIN IN ITS ORBIT 

255
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,182
AROUND THE EARTH, WHICH IS NOT 

256
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,450
A PERFECT CIRCLE. 

257
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,185
SOMETIMES IT IS CLOSER, 

258
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:10,756
SOMETIMES NOT. 

259
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:11,456
WHEN IT IS CLOSER IT MOVES 

260
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,324
QUICKER, AND WHEN IT IS FURTHER 

261
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,326
AWAY IT IS SLOW. 

262
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,428
SO, RIGHT NOW IT IS FAR AWAY, 

263
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,063
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHAPE OF 

264
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,965
EARTH'S SHADOW, THE MOON COULD 

265
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,065
PASS THROUGH THE EDGE OR THE 

266
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,635
CENTER OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. 

267
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,938
THIS TIME, THE MOON IS FAR AWAY 

268
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:26,605
AND IS GOING THROUGH THE CENTER 

269
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,741
OF THE SHADOW. 

270
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,875
THAT MAKES IT AN INCREDIBLY 

271
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,276
LONG ECLIPSE. 

272
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,410
WHAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW IS THE 

273
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,780
MOON JUST WENT IN TOTALITY. 

274
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,517
THE EARTH'S SHADOW HAS A DARK 

275
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,553
INNER PART WHERE THE LIGHT IS 

276
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,254
COMPLETELY BLOCKED. 

277
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:42,821
IF YOU'RE STANDING ON THE 

278
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:43,722
MOON'S SURFACE YOU COULD NOT 

279
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,791
SEE THE SUN. 

280
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,792
YOU SEE A RING AROUND THE EARTH 

281
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,461
AND IT IS A TOTAL ECLIPSE. 

282
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,029
BUT, IF YOU ARE ON THE EARTH, 

283
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,465
THEN THE ENTIRE HEMISPHEREÃ

284
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,400
HEMISPHERE GETS TO SEE THE 

285
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,968
ECLIPSE. 

286
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:56,635
WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, WE 

287
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:57,904
CANNOT SEE IT. 

288
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:04,910
BUT, THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE 

289
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,744
BENDS THE LIGHT, SO IT FALLS ON 

290
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:06,578
THE MOON, BUT IT ALSO FILTERS 

291
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:07,146
THE LIGHT. 

292
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:07,746
THE BLUE LIGHT GETS SCATTERED 

293
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:13,185
OUT BY A PROCESS AND THE RED 

294
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:13,785
LIGHT MAKES IT THROUGH, SO 

295
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:14,787
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF RED 

296
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,454
LIGHT FILTERED THROUGH, FALLING 

297
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,321
ON THE MOON, AND WE GET THIS 

298
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,589
BLOOD MOON AND THIS VERY LONG, 

299
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:18,890
ONCE IN A CENTURY ECLIPSE. 

300
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,694
>> THAT IS WHY IT IS RED, VERY 

301
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,062
INTERESTING. 

302
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:23,796
THIS IS THE LONGEST ECLIPSE OF 

303
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,732
THE CENTURY SO FAR. 

304
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,669
WILL THERE BE A LONGER ONE? 

305
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,605
>> IF YOU GO AND LOOK UP THE 

306
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,239
ECLIPSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED, 

307
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,840
WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR IS 

308
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,175
WHEN THERE WILL BE A CENTRAL 

309
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,144
ECLIPSE, MEANING THE MOON GOES 

310
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,612
THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE 

311
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,048
EARTH'S SHADOW, AND THAT 

312
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,516
ECLIPSE OCCURRING WHEN THE MOON 

313
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,519
IS IN ITS NEAREST/FURTHEST POINT

314
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,755
FROM THE EARTH. 

315
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,322
THIS HAS BOTH CONDITIONS. 

316
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:51,357
THERE IS NOT ANOTHER ONE OF THE 

317
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,424
CENTURY THAT HAS BOTH 

318
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:55,460
CONDITIONS, BUT WE CAN PREDICT 

319
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,262
THESE FAR INTO THE FUTURE. 

320
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,531
THERE IS A WEBSITE THAT SHOWS 

321
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,966
YOU PHOTOGRAPHS OF HOW THE MOON 

322
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,766
WILL PASS THROUGH THE EARTH 

323
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,168
SHADOW AND WHERE IT WILL BE IN 

324
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,270
ITS ORBIT. 

325
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,971
IF YOU CAN HANG AROUND FOR A 

326
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:06,772
FEW HUNDRED YEARS, YOU WILL SEE 

327
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,640
ANOTHER ONE. 

328
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,445
>> HAS THE TEMPERATURE ON THE 

329
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,379
MOON DROPPED SINCE THE SUN IS 

330
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,446
NOT HITTING IT DIRECTLY? 

331
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,748
>> WHEN THE SUN'S RAYS ARE 

332
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:20,186
DIRECTLY FOLLOWING ON A SURFACE,

333
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,687
HERE WE ARE ON EARTH, AND WE 

334
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,155
HAVE AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS ABLE 

335
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,657
TO FILTER OUT A LOT OF THE 

336
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,324
RADIATION THAT WE ARE NOT 

337
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,159
RECEIVING. 

338
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,460
A LOT OF THE ULTRAVIOLET AND 

339
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,897
INFRARED IS FILTERED OUT. 

340
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:32,832
THE MOON DOES NOT HAVE AN 

341
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,599
ATMOSPHERE. 

342
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,501
WHEN THE SUNLIGHT FALLS ON IT, 

343
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,203
IF YOU HAD SOMETHING MEASURING 

344
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,036
TEMPERATURES YOU WOULD MEASURE 

345
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,106
A HIGH RATE OF SOLAR ENERGY 

346
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,341
BEING ABSORBED ON THE SURFACE, 

347
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,843
BUT NOW IT IS BLOCKED OUT AND 

348
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,546
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT RADIATION 

349
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,414
IS BLOCKED OUT SO YOU DO NOT 

350
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,916
GET THAT ENERGY. 

351
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,283
YOU ARE COLDER. 

352
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,184
>> WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF 

353
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,889
INTEREST IN THIS EVENT. 

354
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,556
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE 

355
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,056
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY? 

356
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:58,858
ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THIS 

357
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,124
INTEREST? 

358
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:00,458
>> WE CERTAINLY ARE, BECAUSE A 

359
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,330
RISING TIDE FLOATS ALL BOATS. 

360
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,999
AND THE SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION 

361
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,100
COMES FROM SCIENTIFIC 

362
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,001
INSPIRATION. 

363
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,135
SO, GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE 

364
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,503
INVOLVED, LETTING THE PUBLIC 

365
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:17,175
KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING 

366
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:17,943
THAT IS WORTH YOUR TAX DOLLARS 

367
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,278
TO INVEST IN, BECAUSE YOU CAN 

368
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,014
THINK ABOUT -- WE HAVE HEARD OF 

369
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,581
PEOPLE THAT INVEST IN 

370
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,181
BUSINESSES AND STARTUPS AND 

371
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:23,648
THIS SORT OF THING. 

372
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,251
BASIC SCIENTIFIC INVESTMENT IS 

373
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,487
LIKE INVESTING IN STARTUPS THAT 

374
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:34,426
DO NOT YET EXIST. 

375
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:35,027
SO, ONCE WE GET EVERYONE 

376
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,828
EXCITED ABOUT SCIENCE AND WE 

377
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,562
RECOGNIZE IT IS IMPORTANT, THAT 

378
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,130
NOT ONLY IMPROVES OUR LIVES 

379
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,965
THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC THINGS 

380
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,368
THAT WE LEARN AND THE 

381
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,170
ENGINEERING THAT CREATES NEW 

382
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,506
STUFF, BUT IT ALSO CREATES MORE 

383
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,374
PROSPERITY. 

384
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,543
>> YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING EXCITED 

385
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,211
ABOUT SCIENCE IS A GOOD THING. 

386
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,213
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE 

387
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,182
LOOKING AT A PICTURE OF THE 

388
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,452
BLOOD RED MOON ON THE LEFT-HAND 

389
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,020
SIDE, AND A BRIGHT STAR UP IN 

390
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,388
THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER. 

391
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:03,922
THAT IS MARS, RIGHT? 

392
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:06,859
>> THAT IS RIGHT, YEAH. 

393
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,693
THIS IS AN INTERESTING THING. 

394
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,263
WHEN WE HAVE A FULL MOON, THAT 

395
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,097
MEANS THAT THE SUN, EARTH, AND 

396
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,265
MOON ARE LINED UP. 

397
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,502
RIGHT NOW, MARS IS AT WHAT WE 

398
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,369
ASTRONOMERS CALL OPPOSITION. 

399
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,104
MARS IS ON THAT LINE ALSO. 

400
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,340
RIGHT NOW, THE EARTH, THE SUN 

401
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,876
AND MOON ARE ALL IN A LINE. 

402
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:28,714
AND, THAT IS WHY WE ARE LOOKING 

403
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,548
PAST THE MOON OUT TOWARDS MARS 

404
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,616
WHICH IS TENS OF MILLIONS OF 

405
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,053
LIGHT METER -- LIGHT YEARS 

406
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:34,253
AWAY. 

407
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,187
WE HAVE A FULL MOON DURING THIS 

408
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,154
ECLIPSE, AND WE ALSO HAVE A 

409
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:36,622
FULL MARS. 

410
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,326
>> WHAT IS GOING ON ON MARS IF 

411
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,061
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MOON 

412
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:46,131
DROPPING TEMPERATURE AND WHAT 

413
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,165
IT WOULD BE LIKE -- WHAT IS 

414
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,300
HAPPENING ON MARS RIGHT NOW? 

415
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,935
>> WHAT MARS WOULD SEE 

416
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,372
POTENTIALLY WOULD BE -- WHEN WE 

417
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,973
LOOK AT VENUS PASS IN FRONT OF 

418
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:56,375
THE FACE OF THE SUN, WE CALL 

419
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,544
THAT A TRANSIT. 

420
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,779
I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ARE LINED 

421
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,847
UP SUFFICIENTLY FOR THERE TO BE 

422
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,315
AN EARTH TRANSIT, BUT THAT IS 

423
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,683
ABOUT IT. 

424
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,618
EARTH'S SHADOW DOES NOT EXTEND 

425
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,319
THAT FAR, BUT IT IS SIMILAR TO 

426
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,723
THE WAY THAT WE DISCOVER 

427
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,323
PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS. 

428
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,558
WHEN THE PLANET PASSES IN FRONT 

429
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,662
OF THE DISC OF THE STAR YOU GET 

430
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,396
A LITTLE DROP IN THE 

431
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:17,696
BRIGHTNESS. 

432
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,497
IF YOU ARE A SCIENTIST ON MARS 

433
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,331
YOU COULD BE TAKING DATA AND 

434
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,501
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THE 

435
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,103
EARTH/MOON SYSTEM BLOCKING OUT 

436
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,938
LIFE. 

437
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,372
IF YOU DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH 

438
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:31,243
RESOLUTION TO SEE THAT THEY ARE 

439
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,111
TWO SEPARATE BODIES, YOU COULD 

440
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,846
FIGURE IT OUT FROM THE DATA. 

441
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,080
HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE 

442
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,215
IT OUT THIS TIME, BECAUSE THE 

443
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,284
MOON IS IN THE EARTH'S SHADOW, 

444
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,385
YOU WOULD MISS THE MOON. 

445
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,019
BUT, POTENTIALLY YOU COULD DO 

446
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,119
THAT AT OTHER TIMES. 

447
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:45,624
>> WAS A THAT YOU ARE NEIL 

448
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,224
ARMSTRONG, YOU LANDED ON THE 

449
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:47,125
MOON AT THE TIME OF THE LUNAR 

450
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,026
ECLIPSE, YOU LOOK UP -- WHAT 

451
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:49,028
WOULD YOU SEE? 

452
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,829
>> THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL 

453
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,096
QUESTION. 

454
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,365
SO, AGAIN THE EARTH SHADOW IS 

455
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:53,766
COMPLEX. 

456
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,302
THERE IS A DARK INNER REGION 

457
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,469
THAT WE CALL THE UMBRA, AND 

458
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:02,608
THEN THERE IS AN OUTER REGION. 

459
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,375
AT FIRST, WHAT HAPPENS IS THE 

460
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,442
MOON PASSES INTO THE OUTSIDE 

461
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:04,676
REGION. 

462
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:05,611
IF YOU ARE ON THE MOON YOU 

463
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,447
WOULD SEE A CHUNK TAKEN OUT OF 

464
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,049
THE SUN FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, 

465
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,017
AND THEN YOU SEE THE EARTH AS 

466
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,155
IT PASSES YOU SEE MORE AND MORE 

467
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:16,822
OF THE SUN GETTING BLOCKED OUT, 

468
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,191
AND NOW IMAGINE -- THE EARTH 

469
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,794
SHADOW IS WAY BIGGER THAN THE 

470
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,029
SIZE OF THE SUN, SO YOU WOULD 

471
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,531
HAVE THIS BIG ARC COVERING THE 

472
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:30,969
SUN. ONCE THE TOTALITY STARTED, 

473
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,404
THAT WOULD BE A FULL ECLIPSE. 

474
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,305
YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE 

475
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,107
THE SUN AT ALL AND YOU WOULD 

476
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,310
SEE THE EARTH WITH THIS RED 

477
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,311
RING AROUND IT WHERE THE LIGHT 

478
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,279
IS FILTERED THROUGH THE 

479
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:40,579
ATMOSPHERE. 

480
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,314
