people like you who have out you came from the Jackson world this was essentially what Jesse Jackson stood for that's was welcoming more voices diversifying the party bringing in you know new leadership we're in Wilko rainbow coalition exactly yeah I but there's there's still this element there's the Clinton element we cannot deny it you know many people who are refusing to leave it's not like there's people being appointed into leadership positions that are coming from millennial side but I mean I'm gonna save the sander side because most Millennials did support Bernie Sanders yeah that's correct so if the Democratic Party wants to move forward wouldn't it just logically say all right Bernie alright we'll let you win we'll let you bring in some reforms we know you're an independent but we also know that you you know you have a lot of Democratic support you have union members you have Millennials right look Jackson 84 was far different from Jackson 88 Jackson 84 was the movement Jackson 88 was the moment before the moment you have to have the movement and a movement that might have been ignited and given new fuel and energy in with Bernie in 2016 it has to continue because this is the moment the moment is coming quicker than you anticipated and and I think for people who walked away last year saying I'm done with it really yeah this is when you once you get in the door or once you start tasting the soup you keep either you keep walking you keep coming in the movement and gave us this moment for reform and and if you walk out the door when you start in a reform process simply because you can't get your ideas in the room it took us it took us a season to just get take one off and when I take all off the the table when we used to Jackson campaign we did not like wanna take what is we want to take all is that Walter Mondale Jesse Jackson and five other people compete Walter Mondale get 37% Jesse get 34% but just to get no delegates want to take all left us without having even one person in the room who could speak on our behalf and so we got rid of that we also lower the threshold we the threshold of 20% and you can give one delegate we lower the threshold so that it was 15% 15% you can you know we felt that we can get better representation so Jackson 84 was the movement Jackson 88 was the moment Jesse almost won the 88 primary and so I think what people have to understand it said no you cannot walk into a room and say and this is your first election and you put it all on the table and then when you lose you say I'm going home no when you lose you figure out what happened
