00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:01,937
THE SUMMIT ON TUESDAY, ALSO

2
00:00:01,937 --> 00:00:04,239
LOOKING BACK AT THIS WEEKEND'S

3
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,941
G-7 MEETING IN CANADA THAT ENDED

4
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:06,775
WITH A BIG BANG.

5
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:09,077
WE BEGIN RIGHT NOW WITH CHIEF

6
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:09,844
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JOHN

7
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:10,979
ROBERTS WHO HAS BEEN TRAVELING

8
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:13,949
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

9
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:14,816
GOOD MORNING, JOHN.

10
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,484
>> BRET, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

11
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,552
WHAT WE'RE WITNESSING UNFOLD

12
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:21,056
HERE IN SINGAPORE COULD BE TRULY

13
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:21,423
HISTORIC.

14
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:22,223
WHAT HAPPENS HERE OVER THE NEXT

15
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,358
FEW DAYS COULD BEGIN THE PROCESS

16
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,593
TO ELIMINATE ONE OF THE GRAVEST

17
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:28,196
THREATS FACING THE WORLD, OR IT

18
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:32,634
COULD GO NOWHERE.

19
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:34,970
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOUCHED DOWN IN

20
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,237
SINGAPORE PRONOUNCING THAT HE IS

21
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,139
FEELING GOOD ABOUT THE PROSPECTS

22
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,108
OF HIS MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN,

23
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,510
BUT AS HE DEPARTED THE G-7

24
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,878
SUMMIT IN QUEBEC, PRESIDENT

25
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:44,679
TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED HE WAS FLYING

26
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,513
INTO THE UNKNOWN.

27
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:48,583
>> IT'S UNKNOWN TERRITORY IN THE

28
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:49,417
TRUEST SENSE.

29
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,619
BUT I REALLY FEEL CONFIDENT.

30
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:55,824
I FEEL THAT KIM JONG-UN WANTS TO

31
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:57,292
DO SOMETHING GREAT FOR HIS

32
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,794
PEOPLE, AND HE HAS THAT

33
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:00,228
OPPORTUNITY.

34
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,463
AND HE WON'T HAVE THAT

35
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:02,297
OPPORTUNITY AGAIN.

36
00:01:02,297 --> 00:01:03,465
IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE THERE

37
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:03,765
AGAIN.

38
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,633
>> KIM JONG-UN HAD ARRIVED

39
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,836
EARLIER IN THE DAY TRAVELING

40
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:09,070
FARTHER THAN HE EVER HAS AS

41
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,106
NORTH KOREA'S LEADER COURTESY OF

42
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:13,274
CHINA'S NATIONAL AIRLINES.

43
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,676
KIM LATER MEETING WITH THE

44
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:18,380
SUMMIT HOST SINGAPORE'S PRIME

45
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:18,747
MINISTER.

46
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:19,981
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL MEET WITH

47
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:25,153
HIM TODAY.

48
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:28,123
THE RED LINE AT TUESDAY'S TALKS

49
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:35,730
THE COMPLETE VERIFIABLE

50
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,033
DISMANTINGLING -- DISMANTLING OF

51
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,667
NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

52
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,202
>> HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE WHETHER

53
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:41,836
OR NOT THEY ARE SERIOUS?

54
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:43,438
I SAID MAYBE IN THE FIRST

55
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:43,772
MINUTE.

56
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,273
YOU KNOW THE WAY THEY SAY YOU

57
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,641
KNOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO LIKE

58
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:48,543
SOMEBODY IN THE FIRST FIVE

59
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,478
SECONDS, YOU EVER HEAR THAT ONE?

60
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,616
WELL, I THINK THAT VERY QUICKLY

61
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:55,750
I WILL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

62
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,152
SOMETHING GOOD IS GOING TO

63
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:57,485
HAPPEN.

64
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:59,521
>> BACK HOME, CALLS FOR THE

65
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,688
PRESIDENT TO BRING WHATEVER DEAL

66
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,857
HE CUTS WITH KIM TO CONGRESS.

67
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,061
MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR ED MARKEY

68
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,128
WHO NEVER ASKED PRESIDENT

69
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,130
OBAMA'S IRAN DEAL TO BE RATIFIED

70
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,065
SAYS CONGRESS SHOULD HAVE ITS

71
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:10,330
SAY.

72
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,300
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE FOR

73
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,635
THE PRESIDENT TO COME TO

74
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:16,037
CONGRESS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS

75
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,239
A RATIFICATION OF ANY AGREEMENT

76
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,942
WHICH DOES TAKE PLACE BETWEEN

77
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,577
THE NORTH KOREANS AND THE UNITED

78
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:22,911
STATES.

79
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:24,412
>> BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD

80
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,514
ALREADY PREEMPTED MARKEY SAYING

81
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,316
ON FRIDAY HE WOULD MAKE ANY

82
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,151
AGREEMENT WITH NORTH KOREA A

83
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,619
TREATY, UNLIKE THE IRAN DEAL.

84
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,788
>> I WOULD ONLY DO A DEAL IF I

85
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:34,856
GET IT THROUGH CONGRESS.

86
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,191
I WOULDN'T DO LIKE OBAMA DID.

87
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:37,926
>> AS HE ARRIVES IN SINGAPORE

88
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:38,960
FOR PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT

89
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,695
MEETING OF HIS PRESIDENCY,

90
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,430
PRESIDENT TRUMP LEAVES BEHIND

91
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,533
GRUMBLING ALLIES AT THE G-7,

92
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,502
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP DEPARTED

93
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,937
QUEBEC, CANADA'S PRIME MINISTER

94
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,038
RIPPED HIM UP ONE SIDE AND DOWN

95
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:51,473
THE OTHER ON TRADE.

96
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:53,274
>> IT IS KIND OF INSULTING.

97
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,710
AND I HIGHLIGHTED THAT IT WAS

98
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,947
NOT HELPING IN OUR RENEGOTIATION

99
00:02:58,947 --> 00:02:59,314
OF NAFTA.

100
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:01,416
>> THAT PROMPTED RETALIATION

101
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,384
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO TWEETED

102
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,953
HE HAS INSTRUCTED OUR U.S. REPS

103
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:07,222
NOT TO ENDORSE THE SUMMIT

104
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,356
COMMUNIQUE AND CRITICIZED

105
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,658
TRUDEAU AS DISHONEST AND WEAK.

106
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,061
CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR LARRY

107
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,696
KUDLOW SAID TRUDEAU STABBED THE

108
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,197
PRESIDENT IN THE BACK, DOUBLE

109
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:16,731
CROSSED HIM.

110
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:18,800
>> TRUDEAU DECIDED TO ATTACK THE

111
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,234
PRESIDENT.

112
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:20,502
THAT'S THE KEY POINT.

113
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:22,303
AND YES, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ATTACK

114
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,640
THIS PRESIDENT, HE'S GOING TO

115
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,808
FIGHT BACK.

116
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,576
>> KUDLOW ADDED THERE IS NO ROOM

117
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,379
FOR A SHOW OF WEAKNESS BEFORE

118
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,380
THIS IMPORTANT SUMMIT ON

119
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:32,747
TUESDAY.

120
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:34,282
HERE'S THE WAY IT WILL UNFOLD,

121
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,517
THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST MEETING

MORNING SINGAPORE TIME.

124
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,355
IT WILL BE A ONE-ON-ONE WITH KIM

125
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,056
JONG-UN, JUST THE TWO LEADERS

126
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:48,530
PLUS THEIR INTERPRETERS.

127
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,899
AN EXPANDED MEETING WILL HAPPEN

128
00:03:50,899 --> 00:00:00,000
