CONWAY. ARI, I WISH I COULD GET THE WHOLE PANEL GOING. THANK YOU, ALL. PRESIDENT TRUMP APPARENTLY BUOYED BY CAVANAGH'S PERFORMANCE TODAY TWEETED SHORTLY AFTER IT ENDED, JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOWED AMERICA EXACTLY WHY I NOMINATED HIM. HIS TESTIMONY WAS POWERFUL, HONEST, AND RIVETING. DEMOCRATS SEARCH AND DESTROY STRATEGY IS DISGRACEFUL, AND THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN A TOTAL SHAM AND AN EFFORT TO DELAY, OBSTRUCT, AND RECESSED BY THE SENATE MUST VOTE." JOINING US NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, FROM THE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDN WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT, KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESID. WHAT IS THE MOOD TONIGHT? AND THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY PLEASED WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH'S APPEARANCE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. BUT WHAT IS NEXT, WHAT WILL BE THE NEXT MOVE BEFORE THE WHITE HOUSE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE VOTES FROM THE REPUBLICANS ON THE HILL? LAURA, THANKS FOR HAVING ME PRAYED WITH THE PRESIDENT SAW IN JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHEN HE FIRST MET WITH HIM, AND CONSIDER DOMINATING THEM TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS WHAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY SAW TODA TODAY. A MAN OF GREAT SELF POSSESSION AND COMPOSURE WHO ALSO WAS ABLE TO SHOW EMOTION AND EMPATHY FOR THOSE HE FEELS ARE BEING WRONGED, CERTAINLY HIMSELF BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE PROCESS. HIS YOUNG DAUGHTERS, HIS WIFE, HIS PARENTS. ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO HAVE COME FORWARD TO SUPPORT HIM. HIS HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS WHO ARE NOW BEING DRAGGED INTO THIS, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY CANNOT CORROBORATE THESE ALLEGATIONS. Laura: KELLYANNE, THERE'S A LOT OF COMMENTATORS ON TV WHO ARE LIKE, BRETT SHOWED HE HE HAD THIS SEETHING RAGE. I HEARD ONE PERSON SAY, OH, IF HE COULD BE SO TICKED OFF AT THIS, IMAGINE WHAT HE DOES WHEN HE HAS A FEW DRINKS IN HIM. I ACTUALLY HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT. LAURA, RESPECTFULLY, YOU GOT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR PUT ON THE RADIO ONCE A WHILE. I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT RELEVANT. I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH ACTUALLY SPENT TWO WEEKS, TWO PLUS WEEKS, TRASH AND WHERE HE WAS 90 ABLE T WATCHING AND LISTENING TO PEOPLE TRASH AND WHERE HE WAS 90 ABLE O RESPOND. THE SANCTIMONIOUS PENDANTS PONTIFICATING AND PREVARICATING ABOUT A MAN THEY HARDLY KNOW. ALL THEY KNOW ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE HAS 300 OPINIONS AND A YEARBOOK PAGE. AND THE SENATE DEMOCRATS TODAY IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTUALLY WERE FAR MORE INTERESTED IN A YEARBOOK PAGE BY A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY THEN 300 OPINIONS HE HAS AUTHORED AS A MAN. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT OUR PROCESS. I THOUGHT TODAY WAS A TOUR DE FORCE BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH. HE PUT IT ALL ON HIS SHOULDERS. HE IS GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE TAPE AND LABORED OUT IN THE FIELD AND PIER TRUMP FASHION. I THOUGHT JUDGE KAVANAUGH CHANNELED HIS INNER CLARENCE THOMAS AND HIS INNER DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO BESMIRCH A GOOD MAN'S REPUTATION AND DASH GO AHEAD. Laura: KELLYANNE, DO YOU THINK THAT THE DECISION TO BRING IN MS. MITCHELL, THE FORMER SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR WAS THAT EFFECTIVE? I DON'T YOU WORK FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND EVERYBODY SAYS IT WAS GREAT. I GOT TO SAY, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GREAT. I DIDN'T THINK THAT MITCHELL SHE SEEMS LIKE A REALLY SMART PERSON, A REALLY NICE PERSON, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE FORMAT BUT IT ALL SEEMED A LITTLE TOO PLOTTING IN A LITTLE TO LIKE IT INSTEAD OF, THIS IS A PERFORMANCE. I DON'T KNOW. I JUST TALKED LINDSEY GRAHAM AT THE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY DID A BETTER JOB THAN MITCHELL WITH THE WITNESS, WITH THE ACCUSER. I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ULTIMATELY REMOVE HER FROM IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH. LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT TODAY IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT AFRAID IT'S A CIVIL PROCEEDING OR A ME TOO MOVEMENT. IT'S NOT A TRIAL BY TB. IT IS ANOTHER STEP IN THE SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. I THINK THEY'LL REMEMBER HIM THEY'LL REMEMBER HIM BECAUSE HE BATTED ON THE ALLEGATIONS, SHOWED, I WOULD SAY, EMOTION BUT ALSO EMPATHY. PEOPLE COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER THEY WERE MAD AT HIM FOR SHOWING CHANNELING THE ANGER THAT HE HAS FOR SENATE DEMOCRATS AS HE SAID CALL HIM EVIL, AND QUESTION HIS JUDGMENT, AND SAID NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHILE THEY ARE HEARING THREATENED HIS WIFE Laura: DID YOU THINK SHE WAS EMPATHETIC, DR. FORD, THE ACCUSER? DID SHE SEEM CREDIBLE? YES, I DO THINK NOT AS A WOMAN. I DON'T LIKE THAT. I SHOULD SAY THAT SHE CAME ACROSS AS COMPELLING AS EMPATHETIC. AND I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR TWO WEEKS NOW, A WEEK NOW, THAT IT'S TRUE THAT SOMETHING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HER, SOMETHING TERRIBLE MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HER. ADJUSTED AND INVOLVE HIM. HE SAID TODAY UNDER OATH, HE DOESN'T DOUBT THAT SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR HARMED BY SOMEONE, SOMEHOW, SOMEWHERE, BUT THAT HE HAS HAD MANY TIMES NOW UNDER OATH, IT WASN'T HIM. I THOUGHT WHAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH DID TODAY IS AN EXERCISE IN THE WAY PEOPLE SHOULD TREAT PEOPLE WHO MISTREAT THEM. I WILL TELL YOU WHY. HE DID NOT DRAW FIRST BLOOD. WHEN HE FIRST GAVE THE 34 HOURS OF SWORN TESTIMONY, HE SHOWED RESPECT, THE DEMOCRATS ANSWERED WITH RUMINATION. HE DEFERENCE. THEY ANSWERED WITH CONSTRUCTION. HE HAS WATCHED THEM TRYING TO DESTROY THEM AND HIS NAME I DO KNOW WHAT? HE RESPONDED IN KIND. I DON'T THINK THEY WERE READY FOR THAT. THE DEMOCRATS QUESTIONS WERE TERRIBLE. THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED MS. MITCHELL TO STAY FOR A COUPLE MORE HOURS. THEIR QUESTIONS WERE TERRIBLE. A FEW OF THEM TALKED ABOUT THE THREE FAVORITE PEOPLE, ME, MYSELF, AND I, THEY GAVE SPEECHES, THEY KEPT REPEATING THE SAME THING Laura: OBSESSED WITH DRINKING. I THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY AGITATED TONIGHT, NOT BRETT KAVANAUGH, YOU KNOW WHO WAS EDUCATED, THE LEFT. BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ON THE PRECIPICE OF HAVING A SECOND SUPREME COURT NOMINEE CONFIRMED. ALONG WITH 26 OR SO U.S. CIRCUIT COURT NOMINEES. Laura: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY GOT NEIL GORSUCH ON THERE, AND THEN THEY SAID, YOU BETTER STOP THE NEXT ONE AND THIS IS THE WAY THEY TRIED TO STOP HIM AND LOOK AT HIM TODAY. Laura: BRIAN FALLON'S TWEET AND THAT WHOLE RESISTANCE GROUP IS REPREHENSIBLE. BRIAN FALLON BETTER I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. HE BETTER STAY OUT OF MY STATE BECAUSE THAT IS JUST RUDE. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED FOR HILLARY CLINTON PROBABLY HASN'T
