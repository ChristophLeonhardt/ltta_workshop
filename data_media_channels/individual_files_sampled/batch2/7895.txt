all right welcome the Young Turks folks Jake and Anna with you guys we also have a very important election tonight now that's a little weird because it's a Thursday normally the elections are on Tuesday next week Rhode Island won't be out on Wednesday we're thinking about doing an old-school episode of election coverage oh okay so I'm just kidding of course I'll be watching okay but tonight's super important because this is a one Senate seat that just Democrats could take so there were just a couple of Senate candidates the Senate seats are much much harder to take because they involve whole states now luckily Delaware is a tiny tiny state so it's actually not a big number it's of almost the size of a congressional district so Kerry Harris tonight the polls have not closed yet if you're in Delaware go vote grab T y-t-dot-com / app grab your app get in line and vote it could make all the difference against one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate Tom Carper so tonight we find out if just Democrats take a sentence seat if they do it'll be another enormous earthquake and even political if you've been watching our election coverage even Politico is starting to have positive headlines like oh another big shocking upset win for progressives or a heap and but Senate's a different animal that will rock their world one more time so I don't you know we gave it

days we've added about well let's we started at 27,000 661 right so getting the 30,000 and a couple of days is near impossible let's see where we are today 29,000 47 so we're past 29,000 okay okay I think we can get there I really do and and I actually think that that might have been from earlier in the day so TYT dot-com slice join and let's see we can push past 30,000 right now we appreciate all of your support and as part of all this we continue to give you more and more progressive content thank you okay so let's get started on the show all right in an unprecedented move a senior Trump White House official released an op-ed anonymously to the New York Times criticizing Donald Trump and his mental stability now there has been backlash against the New York Times and there's been chaos in the Trump administration following the release of this op-ed and the question is well who wrote this which senior Trump official made this decision has these thoughts and is fighting you know secretly in the background against Trump's own political agenda well every single senior official has denied it but before we get to their denials I do want to give you a sense of how Trump reacted to it now of course he reacted on Twitter but he also reacted in video form and you're about to see that right now let's take a look nobody has ever done in less than a two year period what we've done so when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons now and the New York Times is failing if I weren't here I believe the New York Times probably wouldn't even exist they don't like Donald Trump and I don't like them because they're very dishonest people remember this also about the New York Times when I won they were forced to apologize to their subscribers they wrote a letter of apology it was the first time anybody's ever done it because they covered the election incorrectly so if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial can you believe it anonymous meaning gutless a gutless editorial we're doing a great job the poll numbers are through the roof our poll numbers are great and guess what nobody is gonna come close to beating me in 2020 okay like let's just first acknowledge the fact that his poll numbers are abysmal they're at record lows he's in the 30s he's pulling in the 30s in terms of his approval rating he's not doing well but I do want to give him credit for one part of that statement that I actually think is a little accurate he said that the New York Times was failing and then he was elected and if it wasn't for him they wouldn't be around now of course it's ridiculous to say that the New York Times wouldn't be around if it weren't for Trump however I do believe that their reporting has improved like significantly after his election same for the Washington Post that is the only accurate thing that came out of that statement yeah of course he thinks that their their reporting is more fake but no what we like about the reporting is not because it's partisan or against Donald Trump or that it's biased no we actually like that they're holding power to account which we thought they did not do enough during the Bush years famously when we were lying they're Iraq war but also in the Obama years and there was a lot of deference to Obama because he was well-liked in Washington well-liked by the establishment and that's not what the press is supposed to do they're supposed to be watchdogs and and Trump is so over-the-top and so outrageous he kind of forced their hand to do it because he says nonsense lies you know in every single statement as he did a couple of times in that clip I mean his poll numbers are among the worst the president has ever had but he creates this illusion for his base they think he's really popular because he keeps saying it when in reality nearly two-thirds of the country can't stand him and and apparently in two-thirds of his own administration can't stand him now that's of course the two-thirds not official poll and within the administration it is in the country so there's what an irony here that I want to point out here so he doesn't deny that it's true because he says the individual is gutless and a coward they have now attacked whoever it is and they say he should resign so obviously you believe it is true otherwise you wouldn't be saying that if if there was an anonymous I've had to hear of someone writing outrageous things etc and we thought none of that sounds true I don't think this person is in the building we would say and if it was a right-wing website I would say oh they made that up right we wouldn't be like who is it yeah so so it's obvious that that the the op-ed is from a real person that is a senior administration official now the the real irony though is hey if it wasn't for the New York Times you wouldn't know that there's somebody inside your administration working against you doesn't that help you to know that knowledge to understand that and so I mean look you could say hey now the whole country knows and he looks bad but it's horrible but on the other hand it's it's true it exists if I was the president I'd want to know well you see what I'm saying I do see what you're saying I would also want to know I certainly want would not want to be informed the way I certainly wouldn't want to be informed the way that Donald Trump was informed about it however I think the thing that's you have to consider the fact that it was an anonymous op-ed he has no idea who it is and every single your official has come forward and denied it and so who do you trust right so now there's nothing but chaos I mean there was nothing but chaos in the administration prior to this happening but it's even worse now there was already a lack of trust Trump was already carrying out actions and policy decisions unilaterally at least as much as he could without you know the senior officials circumventing him in any way but at least he now knows that there is and by the way we keep talking about it as if it's one person the iPad writer was very clear that there is a great number of people that's why I referred to a big percentage of his administration who are working to make sure that he doesn't do something maniacal and that is a threat to the Republic so it's if I'm the president that's incredibly valuable information I would want to know I get that it doesn't look good but in a sense I thank the New York Times for a service of letting me know something I didn't know oh he would never think Oh the reality is Jake if you were in his shoes you also wouldn't think the New York Times you wouldn't you would hate it you would hate every part no I would hate the person who was doing it and so now that brings us so I think what is the most important point look so if and I said this that were yesterday when the news broke if Donald Trump was a normal president who was mentally stable and was main decisions we just didn't agree with by the way that's George W Bush I I would say no you got to follow his orders and and this kind of clear and subordination is unacceptable and you can't have you can't have it inside the White House and and I always say what if the shoe is on the other foot let's say Bernie Sanders is president and there's a bunch of guys who are establishment people left over from Clinton or Obama or whatever they're like oh whatever man we're not gonna do what Bernie says that would drive me absolutely crazy but this isn't that these are all Republicans who actually agree with Trump's ideas and policies they're just saying no the guy's mentally unstable that's right so yeah and and even if we wanted to execute his policies since he changes his mind non-stop if we if we do the thing he tells us to do he's gonna change his mind later and that's not his actual state of policy to begin with so let me give you guys an example of something that Trump wanted to do but his officials essentially stepped in and prevented it from happening so Trump wanted to go into Syria and just assassinate Bashar al-assad right now no one's making the argument that Bashar al-assad is a good guy right but you don't just go in and execute or assassinate the leader of a country without considering the ramifications of that like what would that mean and also as we all know because you guys are smart you guys know what's going on with you know Foreign Relations and foreign policy Syria isn't a simple civil war against rebels and you know the government there's it's a proxy war Iran is involved turkey to some extent is involved Israel to some extent is involved Russia is involved I mean a decision like that a flippant decision to just go in and assassinate someone is disastrous and so it's important to have adults in the room who understand that and don't actually carry something like that out and let me follow that up with look so if if Trump said no our stated policy is that we are going to get into the middle of the Syrian war and we are going to take out Assad well that's a stated policy and you've got to execute that that's not optional now I would disagree with that massively and I'd fight to make sure that couldn't happen but that's politics and the people voted and they voted for Trump if he said look I'm gonna make a peace with Russia so I'm not gonna get involved with us on all that is fine it's not it's not our call to make he's the president okay and he got elected so if Bernie Sanders said I wanted her withdraw I wanted to engage that that's their call to make but in this case what the people inside his administration are saying is he's so unstable he had and he's like a child so he hasn't lost through anything so if we go attack Assad it unleashes all these things we are not prepared for if you said attack Assad but make preparations so what are we going to do if Russia counter-attacks what if we do if Turkey go comes into northern Syria then we go okay good that's a plan let's go execute that plan yes sir absolutely sir but when one day you wake up and you're mad is something that happened on Twitter and you go why don't you just kill Assad mattis apparently at the time according to Woodward's book said sir we'll get right on it okay hung up the phone and told us aid we're not gonna do any of that right because you have to be more measured like it's good that there are adults in the room and to your point jank this isn't a discussion about whether or not an elected official or the elected president should be able to do his job right this is we're not comparing let's compare two people in the same political party right it's not like we're having a conversation about I don't know George HW Bush and and Trump they're not the same people right in terms of mental stability they're not the same people so Trump has proven over and over again that he's erratic that he's impulsive that he has a lack of intellectual curiosity pertaining to these very issues that he needs to make difficult decisions on okay and guys the the case proves itself because once mattis did not assassinate Assad Trump didn't even notice so apparently it wasn't a real order he didn't really care it was just that in that day he was a little bit more unstable than he is on an average day so I remember when Obama asked for options from the military on Afghanistan he said give me a withdrawal option a stay option and an increased troops option and the military camp is a real store and it was leaked as well by the failing New York Times no it wasn't at the time it was the papers that leaked it that happens in Washington to both Democrats and Republicans and the military came back with we stay and we increased troops they did not present the option of we withdraw now if I was the president I'd say I think you misheard me we're gonna have this meeting in a week again and if you don't have the withdrawal option you're gonna be fired and the guy underneath you is gonna give me the withdrawal option now that is a same president who would like to know what his military options are and then he's gonna make the decision right Trump doesn't ask for options doesn't say hey once we kill a side what happens next are we going to occupy Syria are we gonna have ground forces he's just a stupid little child who's a guy so Madison says that's not a plan I'm not gonna go and try to somehow and what's our plan for killing Assad how long is it gonna take how much does it cost no this guy is a total moron I'm not gonna listen to an order that makes no sense at all if he insists on and he comes back and he says hey general mattis come up with a plan we are going to occupy here's my orders then I'll follow it right but as it stands yes the guy who wrote the op-ed and all the people who are not following Trump's asinine stupid irrational unstable orders are doing a service to the country they are and and this is an important conversation to have because what I've noticed this is just based on you know my media consumption what I'm seeing playing out in the mainstream is people who would typically be more critical of Trump now all of a sudden have some sympathy for him right they feel as though this is not the right course of action he's been betrayed in the worst ways Trump is the individual that was elected as president of the United States and he should be able to do his job the way he sees fit which i think is an incredibly simplistic argument considering who Trump is as a person again this is not about being against a president because of political disagreements because I would be against this if it were a Republican president who was mentally competent but Trump is not mentally competent he is a danger to this Republic and as a result I think that what this administration official is saying it makes all the sense in the world and whoever this person is they will be revealed at some point and so we'll see how it plays out he I mean yeah one more thing so Richard Nixon's defense secretary at near the end of Nixon's tenure told officials if Nixon tells you to launch nuclear weapons don't do it right come and check with me and other officials inside the White House why because Nixon was in a state of depression and and heavily drinking okay so when Nixon is drunk and deeply depressed and he tells you to go nuclear country you are not to do it okay see that is not betraying the president that's actually standing up for the country and doing something rational and and the last thing especially when it comes to trump if mattis had actually gone to try to assassinate Assad and followed that order of that second and that day and things went wrong as they most certainly would have without any plan at all you know what Trump would have done we're not winning with our generals a bunch of idiots go there try to kill Assad I told him not to do that and he would have thrown mattis under a bus he would have lied about it through his teeth and blamed him for his own stupid idea and you know it and mattis knows it and everybody knows it so we're all playing it's these silly little games pretending that the emperor has clothes on when it is super obvious and I know everybody's getting wrapped up and who is it who is it and it's a fun game and we'll play it okay but having said that don't lose track of the overwhelming substance of the story which is the president doesn't have a stable mind he just doesn't he's not making rational decisions and it is deeply deleterious to our republic to our democracy and to our national security so I do want to spend a little bit of time talking about the denials because there have been a number of administration officials who have come forward and denied publishing that op-ed and I want to share their responses with you so first let's go to graphic for because it gives you a sense of the environment or the climate within the administration at the moment according to the New York Times a hunt for the author of the offending article was quickly initiated and scrutiny focused on a half dozen names aides said they assumed it was written by someone who worked in the administration but not the White House itself although they could not be sure you know I don't necessarily believe that yeah it same Kellyanne Conway is out there saying oh good but anybody could have been thousands of people that have access to the White House no no and it's like we don't know they're in the White House at all why Kelly and Conway's in the White House and so to me that was a little bit of curious I know what we're doing now this is the fun part of the story the disastrous part is that the president has lost his mind the fun part is playing Mafia I don't know if any of you have ever played that game where you try to figure out who the Mafia is and who the citizens are look Google it it's a super fun game and that's basically what we're doing at a national level here who did it and who who could it be and when you look for clues when someone goes it comes out and goes hey it didn't have to be somebody in my position or similar they don't have to be in the West Wing I'm in the West Wing but they don't have to be in the West Wing it could be thousands of people you don't know who it is I go hmm interesting yeah okay so that's just but there's a lot of clues there's a lodestar of clues you know we'll get to him so let's go to the first video this is Mike Pompeo he of course is a senior official within the Trump White House and here's what he has to say about the op-ed and whether or not he might have published it were you the author of that op ed could you comment on it thank you so it shouldn't surprise anyone that the New York Times a liberal newspaper that has attacked this administration relentlessly chose to print such a piece they should not well have chosen to take a disgruntled deceptive bad actors word for anything and put it in their newspaper if again if it is what it is purported to be it is sad that you have someone who would make that choice I come from a place where if you're not in a position to execute the commander's intent you have a singular option then just to leave and this person in shed instead according to the New York Times chose not only to stay but to undermine what President Trump and this administration are trying to do and I have to tell you I just I find I find the media's efforts in this regard to undermine this administration incredibly disturbing and and I'll answer your other question directly because I know someone will say gosh you didn't answer the question it's not mine so a couple of things that are fun there first of all that deep breath in the beginning was awesome okay and disturbing I want it on the sound board although people be so mystified later what is that weird breathing number two he again like Trump he attacks the New York Times are you serious a newspaper gets someone that they have confirmed as a senior administration official maybe the vice president may be the spokesperson we don't know who it is a cabinet member comes to any press organization says I am working against the president would you like to print that oh you would you should immediately shut down your news organization if you don't print that examine their is nothing that is more news than I am inside the White House and I will not do what the president says because the president is potentially mentally unstable how is that not news but American voters deserve to know as well we deserve to know that is our government that government represents us supposed to be looking out for us serving our best interest we doesn't we deserve to know about the utter chaos that's happening within the White House right now by the way you could argue Trump deserves to know magna deserves to know like that there's somebody in your view of the world if you're a Magra guy there's a guy who's looking to undermine the president well now you know and you could pair him out or whatever you think is the appropriate course yes and now is it Pompeo back to the parlor game okay no it's unlikely to be a Pompeo not because oh he denied it gourds are all gonna deny it but in the ipad the person refers to early cabinet meetings where there were whispers of a using the 25th amendment Pompeyo was not in the cabinet in in the beginning Pompeo joined the cabinet later so he's at the CIA and now he's Secretary of State in part of the cabinet you sure you didn't work as like a defense attorney at some point I thought little nugget right there you look I'm not saying that I'm a monk the defective detective I just wanted to comment on one word he said in that statement that was just ridiculous and inaccurate so he referred to the person who published the op-ed as disgruntled just run told why it's a senior official within Trump's administration who's currently serving within Trump's administration disgruntled is usually what bad actors will point to when someone got fired and then decided to publish something or say something negative about the company that they got fired from this is not a disgruntled person this is a person who still has a position of power holds a position of power within the Trump administration yes oh okay so more candidates yes by the way I I have the person that I did something very curious that I got at among the top two candidates along with Kellyanne Conway oh okay now Paul Ryan was also asked about the op-ed here's what he had to say I look the person the person by person in the worst of the administration serves pleasure the president it's a person who obviously is living in dishonesty it doesn't help the president so if you're not interested in helping the president work for the places far as I'm concerned he doesn't believe yeah I know in reality he's thinking oh thanks God please stay whatever you do don't don't come out stay where you are make sure he doesn't launch any news yeah by the way to give you some more context and some inside baseball so what the senior officials are currently doing is they are essentially printing out their strongly worded responses to these off EDS and putting it on Trump's desk because he needs it like he needs that validation on a regular basis he loves like those strongly worded denials and and all the negative commentary about this op-ed because he's a child he's a thin-skinned egomaniac and that's what he needs to hear from people to feel good about himself and by the way he's not very bright I mean so John Kelly and Jim mattis apparently went in chief of staff and his defense secretary and they were like no no Woodward's book was wrong we didn't really say those comments and it isn't us he said I okay then I believe you yeah but the person is gonna lie to you and he's not it's smart enough to figure out which one it is so and by the way this is something that's been going on for a long time remember Bob Corker another Republican senator has said earlier I know for a fact every single day at the White House is a situation trying to contain him it's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center someone obviously missed their shift this morning referring to something that Trump had done erratic that day and that's another Republican obviously talked to a colleague of his so that's another clue so perhaps a former Republican senator that would know bob Corker dan coates is a former Republican senator he's the Director of National Intelligence okay another former Republican colleague of corker in the Congress vice president Mike Pence okay two strikes against pence so there's the star yeah so there's the Loadstar and that's a word that was used in the op-ed that Mike Pence uses all the time and almost no one else does certainly within this administration so that was strike one on you guess passed corker is potentially strike two now get a little strike three hmm Pence is one of the few guys who didn't say it himself he had a staffer put out a statement okay so already I was like hmm things that could make you go and then here's a statement from his communications director the vice president puts his name on his op eds so for that is an incredibly weak denial okay the newer time should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote now he gets better here the false illogical and gutless op end okay so new york times should be ashamed doesn't mean anything but hey the false illogical and gutless not bad that's getting stronger but so far they haven't actually said it isn't him okay and then the last part of it and this is it last sentences our office is above such amateur acts and if you notice not only did he never say he didn't do it okay called it an amateur act but he didn't they didn't even say Pence's above it they said our office is above such acts now I this is what I do our decode political speak for a living and there's a reason why they state things in a lawyerly way so if they get caught later they can say oh I didn't say that it wasn't me I just said that it this and that and the office they didn't but I didn't do it etc so that's curious I mean it would be amazing if Penn State if I would have if you didn't have these who's he would have been among the last guys I would I guess because it's too brazen I mean he's the guy who would stand to gain if Trump was removed from office he would be the president he's the one guy who actually has a dog in the fight that isn't just about being a patriot absolutely absolutely and another thing to keep in mind is that and this is just my analysis of it someone who's been openly feuding with Trump like let's say Jeff Sessions although he doesn't really reciprocate like it's usually just Trump feuding with him it would be too obvious like if he were to think about publishing something like this I feel like there would be too many eyeballs on him like they don't like each other they're not getting along but with pence there hasn't really been much drama with pence and Trump yeah and so he could have snuck this in now wait does that mean it's definitely pence of course not it that's why it's a parlor yeah you don't know look and by the way there's an argument for sessions number one also former colleague of bob Corker Republican senator okay and now sessions won't leave the administration even though Trump keeps harassing him over and over again maybe we're overthinking it and it's just the cup in front of me right and so maybe sessions is like hey listen I'm not leaving because me and other guys have to make sure that this idiot doesn't run out of control the sessions does think he's an idiot obviously at this point because it's personal between sessions and Trump now so it's entirely possible those sessions walked in it was like a Woodward wrote the book this is the time to strike your times come here I got this for you yeah by the way one other thing I wanted to mention about sessions his denial was also incredibly short very weak so he didn't release the statement himself there was a Justice Department spokesperson who released the statement so let's go to graphic 12 a Justice Department spokesman told CNN that sessions was not the author wow that's super weak is is super weak denial now there might have been another statement that maybe I had missed but that was the statement that I saw and you're right it's it's very weak yeah yeah and look if I was sessions even if I didn't write it I wouldn't give a strong denial look I'll write whatever the hell I like okay this guy says I'm mentally retarded I'm a dumb southerner I'm not a real man and I mean on and on what Oh like Oh like I'm supposed to be embarrassed that I told you the truth about Donald Trump I'm not at all embarrassed if I'm Jeff Sessions so so look knowing how porous Washington is it would be shocking if the identity was not revealed I don't know if it'll happen soon but but it can't last that long you would imagine certainly not like the old days where they kept our identity of deep throat hidden for decade after decade this will likely come out much sooner but again don't lose focus on the real issue which is the emperor has no clothes it's not just the person who wrote the op-ed he says he's working with a lot of people inside the administration and that they are all worried that Trump is not mentally stable yeah we gotta take a break when we come back some updates on policies that Trump is sneaking in there while we're paying attention to the drama and chaos in

join to become a member all right what's next alright the Trump administration plans to circumvent court limits on detaining migrant miners now there was something known as the Flores settlement which was a settlement that was the outcome of court proceedings in the late 1990s and the Flores settlement essentially lets the government know hey you can't detain immigrant children indefinitely and if you do detain them it can only be for 20 days and you have to detain them in certain conditions Trump administration hates the Flores settlement and they've been fighting aggressively to essentially get rid of it and so now the administration has decided now we're just going to basically go against what the Flores settlement says let me give you the details according to the Washington Post the administration is preparing to circumvent limits on the government's ability to hold miners and immigration jails by withdrawing from the Flores settlement agreement this is something that they've already tried to do and a federal judge said no you can't do this now US District Judge dolly mg the person I was talking about earlier who oversees the agreement has rejected attempt to extend the amount of time migrant children can be held with their parents beyond the current limit of 20 days so to give you some more context and background into this as you know the Trump administration thought it would be a great idea to deter immigrants seeking asylum by separating children from their parents as they cross the border now after that happened federal judges weighed in ACLU sued and it was determined that this was not the right course of action they shouldn't be detaining these children separate from their parents in all these shelters throughout the country and so now the Trump administration is saying fine but we're not gonna allow these families to be released we're gonna go ahead and detain them with their children in special facilities and the judges have said no you can't do that either because you want to detain them indefinitely in some cases for months you can't do that now the administration is saying we're gonna do it so it's funny the Orwellian games that people in power play with words so when the Bush administration started doing torture again they called it enhanced interrogation and and you all know that so in this case this is not an internment camp this is not a cage you know when they had the children locked up in the cages they're like no it's not a cage as a fence interesting Morris now when they're locking up the kids with their parents they're not locking them up it's not a prison it's not any internment it's not any of those it's a family residential center Wow doesn't that sound lovely would you like to go to a family residential center I mean it happens to have cages all around you and you can't leave and if you remember the story about the kids they would get 1 to 2 hours of daylight outside does that sound like a family residential center to you guys not and and so there are other parts of this that you know everyone should be aware of because I've said this from the beginning even when the zero tolerance policy was imposed this is a money-making scheme for facilities that want these huge government contracts so for those of you who think oh we're wasting our money on these migrants and we can't have it no no we're wasting our money on things like private prisons or these privately operated facilities that are going to house these families and the thing is the Flores settlement indicates that if families do get detained together as they await their hearings they have to be in a licensed facility but many states do not license these types of facilities and so that's another reason why Trump wants to do away with the Flores settlement because he wants to be able to you know imprison them wherever the hell he wants and by the way final thing the whole point of this right the whole argument surrounding this from the Trump administration is well we can't do this catch and release thing because these immigrants come in seeking asylum and then they never show up to their court date we release them into the country they never show up that is patently untrue it is untrue more than 80% of them do come back now for the remaining let's let's round and give Trump a higher number than it really is let's say twenty percent don't show up okay then find a better way to monitor them don't put them in prison indefinitely or a facility indefinitely until their case gets heard by a judge but look they're incompetent so that to be fair to them they probably wouldn't find them because of their incompetence to give you a sense of of that there are still more than 500 children in federal custody without their parents they just lost them that they they lost a lot of them the parents got deported and the kids got left behind they didn't bother tracking them it's still the case today so I know we're now focused on other issues and cable news isn't covering it anymore but it's just 500 kids with and they're like hey where's mom and dad sorry we don't know where they are we lost them we did we deported many of them yeah we kept you here detained and then deported your parents some of those videos where you know the lucky families finally got reunited there so heartbreaking there's one video where a mother is about to be reunited with her young son and the sons angry with her cuz it's he's a kid he doesn't understand he thinks his parents did this to him and so she's crying you know sobbing and the little boy doesn't want anything to do with her can you imagine that happening to you and you know I don't know what kind of re-education they did in these camps and it sounds like Maoist China where they get you to turn on your parents etc and you're telling me that you don't think that maybe they did propaganda say oh it's your parents fault for bringing you here right and the kid doesn't know in some of the cases they make the kids to represent themselves in court it's like a three-year-old climbing on the tables without a lawyer and the judge is like what are you doing you can't just bring a three-year-old in the court and have him defend himself this is and this is what the Trump administration is they don't care about these kids they don't care about these families you're just thinking how do I score political points by stuffing more people into these prisons for longer'n and my final point is what might be even more disturbing is here it is again the Trump administration going I don't really care what the courts say I know that we are to follow the floor settlement I'm just not gonna do it that's right and so that breaks down our system of government if the courts don't have this the last word and and the executive branch says I have the guns the court doesn't have the guns I'm not doing it well okay that's not America and that's not our system of government this is exactly how Trump is a danger to the Republic let's take a break when we come back some developments with North Korea and then the story about Alex Jones that we've been promising yeah it final final action on Alex Jones if you will and yeah let's talk about that when we return
