hello I'm Sami Zayn and this is counting the cost on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week a problem with Davos an exclusive ski resort hosts the rich and powerful to discuss making the world a better place but for who also this week African skies moves are afoot to open up air travel across the continent when it proved a game-changer for the region's economy plus slavery at sea the link between supermarket shrimp and forced labor in one of the world's largest seafood exporters Davos a tiny town in the Swiss mountains has hosted the World Economic Forum every January for the past 46 years the rich powerful and famous mingle over five days of sessions and networking the stated aim for this annual event improving the world high in the Alpine air problems of inequality are discussed by some of the planet's richest and most successful leaders of industry at Davos men outnumber women so this year for the very first time there were all female co-chairs here two environmental issues are discussed by some of the world's biggest polluters but the feeling on less elevated ground are they truly addressing the need for a more just global economic system the international elite are acutely aware of the widening gap between rich and poor gender inequality and the derating state of the environment and they're nervous about the political fallout the people in this room are immensely privileged we owe it to society to use this privilege for good we should ask ourselves do we want to live in a world where the wealthy hide and their gated enclaves while those around them struggle or do we want to help create a world grounded in the notion of fairness I might it's ominous some important questions come to mind which require adequate answers for the kind of world we want to leave for future generations is our global order widening these fault lines is it increasing these differences what are the powers that give reference to isolationism and opposed to harmony which give reference to conflicts over cooperation Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi there who opened this year's event but US President Donald Trump was the closing speaker our diplomatic editor James BAE's has more on why Donald Trump went to Davos president Trump clearly decided to perform the role of salesman in chief when he addressed the global elite here at Davos this was a pretty conventional speech in which he talked about the achievements he says they've been in the last year and the priorities fought the Trump administration talking about cutting bureaucracy saying for everyone new regulation that his administration has introduced 21 regulations have been got rid of and annulled by this administration he made it clear that the u.s. is open for investment I'm here to deliver a simple message there has never been a better time to hire to build to invest and to grow in the United States America is open for business and we are competitive once again in recent days there's been criticism of President Trump in his administration for introducing new tariffs what some would say is protectionism on solar panels and on washing machines but in this speech he made a plea for free trade but he said all countries need to play fair we cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others this speech I think will be seen as a success by the white house in fact as they left the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the Treasury Secretary Stephen Venusian both told Al Jazeera it was an excellent speech how will it be received here by those that come every year to Davos one person who does that and has been to Davos very many times said the people here liked here concrete announcements this person quoted president Matt cross saying that he would stop all coal powered power stations by the Year 2021 there were no such announcements in Donald Trump's speech the veteran goer of Davos said to me what people would not be impressed with was Mara Lago happy talk it's for you to decide whether that's what was delivered here James Bay's for counting the cost in Davos joining us from Glasgow is Gregor Owen Gregor is a chief economist at the Global Council good to have you with us so the stated goal of Davos is to make the world a better place but for who Gregor are the Davos elite really looking out for the interest of all well I think it's an open question about exactly whose interest they're looking out for but but issues around inequality how the benefits of globalization are shared who's going to benefit from new technologies digitalization of the economy these are all issues that are being debated actively in Davos this week but is it looking good when you have for example the IMF saying we're going to have in 2018 perhaps the best global economic growth in a decade and at the same time you've got an organization like Oxfam that's saying now you have 42 individuals holding as much wealth as 3.7 billion who make up the poorest half of the world's population that doesn't bode a good economic future for the world does it that's a very stark contrast and absolutely for sure it's a problem for people at Davos it's also a problem for policymakers look I think you've got to you get a view it at two different levels there's partly this question of inequality between countries and one of the things that we've seen happen over the past decade two decades has been a narrowing of inequality between countries as emerging countries have grown faster and prospects for faster growth in countries like India are looking very good just this week in Davos we had Narendra Modi saying that he wants to double the size of the Indian economy between now and 2025 that's a huge ambition but also at the same time inequality within countries and that's where the record is is much less goods we've got very real difficult to erodes inequality in countries like the United States but you also see it in Europe and increasingly you see it in emerging countries including in India is it fair to say that the global economic system is not working for all of the reasons you just mentioned there well it's certainly working for some it's certainly also delivering and it has delivered over the past ten years an improvement in the living standards of many people including many people in the poorest countries but there are real questions about just how widely shared the benefits are we are seeing not just the concentration of incomes in among richer people but also wealth wealth inequalities perhaps more important now than income inequality that that's tied in with this question of monetary policy low interest rates in a low interest rate world asset prices become much higher much more inflated and that boosts the wealth of the wealthiest and that's one of the reasons why we now see wealth concentrated in such a small group of people many of whom are in Davos this week what should do you think Davos be promoting in order to overcome some of the challenges that we see on the global economic landscape well look I think on this question of income inequality one issue that people at Davos will need to consider is executive pay just whether executive pay really is grounded in reality whether pay differentials between the leaders of corporations and many of the people that work for those corporations are now justifiable so I think that is an issue for people at Davos beyond that I think when you look at new technologies when you look at the prospects with digitalization for artificial intelligence the impact that they will have on the economies of the future you know we're seeing new technologies becoming mainstream now beginning to become mainstream so we're the start of a process there that's going to open up a whole new set of issues around disruption to jobs and it potentially will widen some of the inequalities that we've seen in recent years all right we'll leave it there for now thanks for talking to us thank you very much China and South Korea have condemned the u.s. decision to impose steep tariffs on imported solar cells and washing machines Adrian Brown has the details from Beijing well China had been anticipating these tariffs because of course president Trump has been talking a lot about this during the past few months now these tariffs are going to be phased in gradually over the coming weeks and months so it's not going to happen immediately China is warning that of course washing machines made by China solar panels made by China are going to be much more expensive for US consumers it's also saying that what the United States is doing is a misuse of trade laws but I think China is paying much more attention to an investigation that president from ordered last year under Section 301 of the US Trade Act now specifically this investigation has been looking at Chinese intellectual property practices areas like telecoms and also semiconductors now if President Trump is to impose tariffs on these sectors then that could hurt China because these exports are worth billions of dollars to China much more valuable than the washing machine or solar industry and I think what experts are saying is that what we may be seeing possibly are the opening shots in a trade war but what is more likely is increased trade friction between these two countries in the weeks and months ahead neither country can afford to have a trade war because of course China has so many investments in the United States and the u.s. is a major investor here in China Boeing Starbucks General Motors these are two economies that are mutually dependent on one another and cannot afford to have a full-blown trade war right now say those experts still to come on counting the cost I'm Sarah Clark in Hong Kong coming up why the city famous for its neon and deterring skyline maybe under pressure to dim the lights and switch off our fresh accusations migrant workers are still being abused in the Thai fishing industry four years after their appalling working conditions made headlines Human Rights Watch says government reforms to address trafficking and forced labor have been largely ineffective Victoria Gaytan beer reports seafood caught in Thailand's waters ends up in markets all around the world but in 2014 the industry was badly damaged by accusations that many of its workers were victims of trafficking and forced labor for years on and Human Rights Watch says the situation is as bad as ever despite government promises to clean up the industry after three years it is unbelievable that people inspection has not been able to identify a single case of forced labor at all the bottom line is many fishermen's they work long hours with little pay face abuses from captain and see no path to escape from the dilemma the Thai fishing industry depends on low-skilled migrant workers from neighboring countries many of them continue to be trafficked across the border and sold onto fishing boats despite being promised other jobs on land they complain of being forced to work through violence or intimidation of physical and mental abuse and of a struggle to get paid I thought about running away from the boat but if I try to escape they'd pay people to hunt me down they'd beat me up and smashed my head then send me injured back to the boat industry leaders say that's not a picture they recognise and that all migrant workers have their rights respected didn't believe for a minute al you look the consumers of America and Europe can eat our seafood everything is fine every problem has been fixed by the current government the boats are correct and the workers are correct there is no more forced labor international pressure from outraged consumers led to the introduction of reforms to protect migrant workers but without effective enforcement the Thai fishing industry continues to be a big earner but one that also comes at a significant human cost Thailand exports 1.8 million tons of seafood annually and is one of the top five global exporters of shrimp seafood from Thailand ends up in supermarket frozen Isles and even as can pet food the three biggest markets for Thai seafood are the US Japan and the European Union but trafficking persists on Thai fishing boats and the sea food on your plate and in your sushi could still be fished by what's being called slaves as a result there are calls for seafood companies and supermarkets to take more responsibility for proving supply chains are free from rights abuses while multinational companies say they investigate allegations of abuse in their supply chains they rarely share negative findings it's about to get easier for almost 700 million Africans to travel by air in the continent the idea of a single African air transport market was first put forward at the African Union some 30 years ago when it's now finally being launched it's one of the AU's pan-african agenda 2063 flagship projects the plan aims to use air transportation as an engine for economic growth tanya page has more Ethiopian Airlines is spreading its wings across Africa buying parts of other countries national carriers the Ethiopian expansion is expected to be boosted by the African Union's launch of a single airspace during its summit in Addis Ababa this week mark befool runs the african diaspora forum in south africa he's originally from Ivory Coast and constantly field travel complaints flying in Africa is a nightmare I went to Tanzania two weeks ago but to get to Tanzania I have to take three different flights and I could not believe when I when when I fly to France after 10 hours is this trap street flight I land in France I mean in other continents Africans often have to fly to European cities as transit stops first before flying on to African countries journeys that should last hours sometimes take days not only does time-consuming and expensive air travel keep families apart but it hinders economic development easier travel will help Africans do business with each other another important priority for the African Union prosper Abbasi is the chairman of the pan-african Business Forum the entrepreneur runs a charter flight company to help businesspeople get around the lack of direct routes as well as liberalizing airspace for African airlines he says the a you should be charging international carriers more to fly in Africa Africa as this is the only space where everybody come into whatever he want to do you can't do that in the US you can't do that in Europe but you can come to Africa you can fly in and drop anywhere we need to be regulated into that s there's so much billions the airline's Association of Southern Africa sees a single airspace could provide a major boost to the continents Airlines if you look at the whole question of international aviation into Africa 80 to 82 percent of the passengers are carried by international airlines and the 18% is only carried by African airlines so there's a huge disparity between that the United Nations says up to the year 2050 more than half of the world's population growth will be in Africa the launch of a single airspace is a step closer to meeting their travel needs and aspirations joining us from London now is Charles Roberts and Charles's the global chief economist at Renaissance Capital all ran cap he's also the lead author of the book the fastest billion the story behind Africa's economic revolution good to have you with us so let's start with this Open Skies agreement what sort of a boost would that give the continents economy I think it's a nice signal I bad integration in Africa I don't think it's going to make much of a difference it's certainly going to help those of us who are travelling around the continent and don't want to be flying back to Amsterdam Paris or London to go from country to country but in terms of economic boost it's not going to affect our forecasts at all hang on you said it will help with travel connections inside the contour how would that change given that the majority of the market up to 80% of passenger travel is dominated by foreign carriers that's there's an opportunity there for carriers to be growing and have been growing Ethiopian Airlines Kenyan Airways they're all doing into content and travel within the continent and it would make it easier with an Open Skies agreement there has already been some expansion of those airlines in West Africa much more problematic you haven't seen anything like that developed out of Nigeria and again maybe the open skies will make a small difference will it not impact as the promoters of the plan say things like trade and the movement of goods and services I doubt it what would be more helpful would be the free trade arrangement within Africa that some still hope to achieve in the long run that might make more of a difference in our view or my view the most important trade growth is going to come from selling to the rest of the world it's a vagina developed it's how Japan developed so that's more important in the right what will come to the see FTAs I think it's called in a minute but let's talk about corruption that's another big theme at the AU summit it's a big obstacle to economic growth this year's summit is being held under the slogan of fighting corruption finding that sustainable path to make that transition do you have any more optimistic expectations of what the summit could do to try and find a sustainable way to fight corruption not much I think that the strongest link on Transparency International's Corruption scores with any other indicators with per-capita GDP rich countries on average have a corruption score of 77 out of 100 that's pretty good countries with an income below two and $1000 a per capita GDP have an average score of 28 out of 100 and the big leap happens at about the $30,000 mark of per capita GDP no country in Africa has GDP that high it's where career is now and you're seeing presidential change in Korea because it's reached that income level because the middle class is that strong that it'll make a difference you can't make that much of a difference in low-income countries there's more urgent priorities for everybody than dealing with corruption so what do you make now of the argument that says that yes there may be more urgent priorities for government on the national level maybe people's hands are tied but the idea of activating that 2006 African Union Convention on corruption activating that advisory board which was created so that it can sort of sit on top of corruption cases on the national level too far-fetched there's no harm in him going in in trying to push against corruption it's not helpful I agree with the African Union in their goal and ambition I just think it's unrealistic to assume a dramatic rise in in corruption scores I better performance against it for most countries you get some rare exceptions Rwanda has a score of 54 out of 100 which is double the average of countries at its income level but it's a it's a very small country it's very well organized and dominated by a strong president that's not normal and more normal is to assume not a great deal of change on the corruption side let's talk a little bit about that Continental free-trade area you think negotiations will be wrapped up in this summit I don't think that's going to be very quick progress on this for many many years but it's not a bad goal and it's something which you hope the African Union would be well placed to try and make progress on again I still think that it strayed to the rest of the world which will be more important that's where the wealth is you've got over a billion people in Africa as you know but in terms of global GDP it's about 2 percent or so 98 percent of the world wealth is outside of Africa and that's what tapping into that exporting to that wealth is what will bring manufacturing industrialization and so on to Africa and much stronger growth rates good talking to you Charles thanks for coming and finally Hong Kong may be famous for its bright neon signs and glittering skyline but it's also earned the title of one of the worst cities in the world for light pollution now many residents are calling for authorities to flick that off switch on those infamous lights Sarah Clark reports from Hong Kong when the Sun sets in Hong Kong the city skyline comes alive billboards and neon lights illuminate the crowded streets the glow from the densely packed skyscrapers is one of the city's main attractions oh my god the lights were so amazing we love it there one second evening and but this appreciation is not shared by everyone in Hong Kong last year the government reported a record number of complaints the curtains may be drawn but residents argue the glare outside is hard to escape we receive some complaints about the light pollution they get insomnia or they have disturbance from the black outside building too in their home scientists at the University of Hong Kong spent 18 months studying levels of light pollution collecting more than 5 million measurements they found Hong Kong one of the world's worst offenders the lights pollution condition in Hong Kong was extremely severe in particular in the urban regions you know the lights night sky brightness which is what we measured is on average a few hundred times over the level of that of a night sky without light pollution in cities such as Seoul London Shanghai and Paris billboard lighting and signage is regulated and there are penalties for violators of the law but in Hong Kong there are no laws a voluntary charter encourages visitors to switch off between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. but critics say it's not enough to make a difference the government says 4800 properties have signed up to the Charter so far and it's satisfied that it's working we are doing our utmost to address this papa concerned we are we are touch importance to the issues and be voluntary at the charter of external I think is taking is the effective but not everyone is convinced and some residents are taking upon themselves to act Zoe Chow led a campaign to have a commercial building switch off after midnight she won but she expects the lights to eventually turn back on I know that the bill they have has side the Charter of Esther no logic but the Charter of external lighting is not is it is voluntary it is not a mandatory for now it seems Hong Kong's bright lights will continue to shine and that's our show for this week but remember you can get in touch
