“Well as raids for immigrants
continue to sweep the country,
a wave of fear and panic
is gripping undocumented
workers.”
“New video shows ICE agents
arresting an alleged victim
of domestic violence
right after she was 
granted a protective order.”
“ICE arrests like this
could become the new normal.”
“The precedent this
sets for people
who want to come forward
and help solve crimes
but are now afraid
of being deported.”
“If I wasn’t undocumented and
if he wasn’t undocumented
I would have called the cops.”
“They have the right to ask
me if I’m documented or not.”
“What did you see happen?”
“Living under the same roof
when someone that you know
could harm you or your
children and not being
able to call the authorities —
it’s a very scary situation.”
“You have to think, what
are the consequences
if I call the cops?”
“I don’t want to get
him in trouble.”
“Because it wouldn’t just
be a day in jail
and you learned your lesson.
It would be a day in jail,
and then you’re
going to get deported.”
“Well I want to thank you all 
for joining me this evening
as I sign a law, it ensures
that law enforcement officers
in Texas can and will
cooperate with ICE.
“Elected officials and 
law enforcement agencies,
they don’t get to pick 
and choose which laws
they will obey.
Texas has now banned 
sanctuary cities
in the Lone Star State.”
“Senate Bill 4 —
it opens the window for
law enforcement officers
to ask for immigration status.
So that’s the thing.
Everybody’s scared.
A lot of folks are scared.
And then that fear
has always been there.
It just enhanced when
S.B. 4 came in,
you know, just in the talks.
And so it doesn’t help
make our job easier.
That’s for sure.”
“It seems like there’s 
a culture problem.
Especially with Hispanics.
There’s so many victims
that eventually do not
go far enough to stop this.
What can we do.”
“We’re not interested in
somebody’s immigration status.
If a person is a
victim of a crime
or the witness of a crime,
we want them to understand
that this department stands
with the victims and
witnesses of crime.
But most importantly,
a crime that impacts
children and women
disproportionately
like domestic violence.”
“There’s been a really
mean-spirited debate
in terms of immigration
at the national level.
And here in Texas with
Senate Bill 4,
with the anti-sanctuary city bill.
It creates an environment
where people feel like,
‘If I report this, they’re
going to be more
interested in my
immigration status
rather than my value
as a human being.’”
