>> Martha: A BEAUTIFUL SHOTS IN
ENDING TODAY.
LESS THAN 48 HOURS FROM THE
ROYAL WEDDING.
PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN MARKLE
WERE SPOTTED WHILE BRITISH
TROOPS TOOK TO THE STREETS.
THEY ARE PRACTICING FOR
SATURDAY'S BIG EVENT.
MEGHAN MARKLE CONFIRMED HER
FATHER WON'T WALKER DOWN THE
AISLE.
WE ARE NOT SURE WHO WILL BE
DOING THE HONORS.
HERE'S THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO
THE UNITED STATES.
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
A LOT OF EXCITEMENT FOR THE
WEDDING.
ALSO THE HOPE FOR A MEETING IN
JULY BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
THE PRESIDENT IN ENDING.
HOW DID THEY GET ALONG.
THEY GET ALONG REALLY WELL?
>> THEY TALK EVERY COUPLE OF
WEEKS.
ON A RANGE OF SUBJECTS.
THEY TALKED JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.
IT'S AN OPEN, FRIENDLY,
SUBSTANCE-FILLED EXCHANGE
BETWEEN THEM.
SHE WILL HOST HIM ON BRITAIN ON
THE 13th OF JULY.
>> Martha: WHAT IS THE BIGGEST
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO OF
THEM?
>> IT'S A VERY OPEN AND HONEST
RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH YOU CAN
DISCUSS DIFFERENCES AS WELL AS
VAST AREAS OF SUBJECTS THAT WE
AGREE ON.
THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ON THE
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.
WE AGREE ON THE OBJECTIVES.
IRAN WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND
IRAN THAT BEHAVES BETTER.
WE WANT TO KEEP THE CURRENT DEAL
AND WORK ON THE REGIONAL
BEHAVIOR AND THIS U.S.
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO
RE-NEGOTIATE THE CURRENT DEAL.
OBJECTS ARE THE SAME.
MEANS OF GETTING THERE ARE
DIFFERENCES.
>> Martha: I HAVE BEEN COVERING
THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE
WEDDINGS AND THE BIG EVENTS OVER
THE YEARS FOR FOX NEWS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS WEDDING
AND YOU GO BACK TO WHEN DIANA
DIED AND THERE WAS NO MUCH
NEGATIVE FOCUS ON THE ROYAL
FAMILY.
WE HAVE COME FULL CIRCLE TO
WHERE THEY ARE EMBRACING THIS
AMERICAN WOMAN MARRYING PRINCE
HARRY ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED
MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT TIME FOR
THE ROYAL FAMILY, ISN'T IT?
>> IT IS.
IT'S A  VERY STRONG POPULAR TIME
FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY.
IT STARTS WITH THE QUEEN THE
STRONGEST MONARCH IN BRITISH
HISTORY.
PRINCE HARRY HUGELY POPULAR
PARTICULARLY AMONG THE YOUNGER
GENERATION.
THIS WEDDING DEMONSTRATES THAT.
ALSO IT'S WONDERFUL THAT PRINCE
HARRY IS MARRYING AN AMERICAN.
A SYMBOL OF THE DEPTH OF OUR
RELATIONSHIP.
>> Martha: YOU ARE GOING TO
MARRIAGE THE YOUNG PRINCESS FROM
SPAIN BUT I THINK THESE TWO ARE
NOT ARRANGED, NOT ARRANGED
CLEARLY.
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT HER
FATHER?
>> IT'S SAD THAT HEALTH REASONS
PREVENT MEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER
FROM COMING.
WE WISH HIM A COMPLETE RECOVERY
AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN
