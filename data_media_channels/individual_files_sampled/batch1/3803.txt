well I I have a little sister she's 12 so she's the young latina woman and this is the first president that she will really grow up like this is like how racist xenophobic in the White House and she knows this she's 12 she knows better she knows better being a woman I think it's a real knock for women I think in America we talk we like to tell other countries that they need women's empowerment and gender equality and all these things but we look to our own selves and we see we don't have equal pay and we've never had obviously a female president and head of state so what are we saying to other people and other nations when we don't even really get it right here think of it at all like I just can't think of waking up to a Tron president because he's publicly been such a misogynist of I got a reason if I had girls I'd want them to feel limitless and I'd want them to feel like they could do anything regardless of their gender and and I hate to say this but at this point I don't know that I could tell them that and I would I guess I would tell them to keep fighting than to just we'll get there one day and we have to keep pushing I hope I hope so much in four years I don't get to say I told you so because that would be terrible so if he does pull it off good luck I mean I'm hoping that I'm still living here in that Canada
