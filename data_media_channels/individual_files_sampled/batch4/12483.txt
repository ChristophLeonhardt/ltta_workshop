this is happening in front of our eyes this is our elites reacting to Donald Trump elites are revealing that instead of being what they think they are what they want us to think they are is these elevated cultured intellectual people who are looking out for a better world they just show that they have their own interest and if you roll a bowling ball down their alley and you break apart their interests you make it harder for them to do business harder for them to make money harder for them to get respect suddenly they turn into and it's like that senior yes I heard it I killed her with my bare teeth you know I did this is what they've become so we see the g7 I mean look I'll raise a a doubt that I have about Trump but in general now I think we have to start to trust the Donald I think we do you know what it he destroyed the Iran deal and we heard oh my gosh this is the worst thing ever obviously it was a good idea he pulled out of the Paris Accord now the Sun is gonna hit the earth because did God's will be angry nothing it was fine it was that was a bad bad deal he was right he's gotten that he told them they had to pay more for NATO anybody those are our allies he was like yeah why aren't they paying for nails now they're paying more for NATO he did all this stuff a week we're told that his treatment of Kim jong-un was gonna destroy the world because the nukes would fly and now they're having this conference in Singapore they're actually having a meeting so it's time like to start to think about the fact that man you know maybe he knows what he's doing at least he knows at least he knows what he doesn't want we know this so far he knows what he doesn't want he goes to the g7 and they're screaming he insulted the Europeans and he didn't didn't sign the communique you read this communique I noticed that nobody published the communique I have to hunt to communicate down it's just this statement this bland statement of the European socialist values it's like we're all gonna be European socialists I'm glad he didn't sign it you know they can stuff their communique like first of all wait why don't they go to their countries and find out why their women and girls are being raped all their police turn a blind eye I mean if they're not going to defend the West how do they become the representatives of the you know they put out this picture here you have those two pictures they put out a picture of that there's Obama at the g7 yeah we're all buddies we're all he's got his arms around everybody and here's Trump at the g7 like facing them down is that yeah I would rather that this guy standing up for me so I trust him I'm not sure yet that he has a plan I hope he has a button but basically basically all he's saying is that we pay high tariffs on their stuff which is true and they don't pay as high as we do which I also think is
