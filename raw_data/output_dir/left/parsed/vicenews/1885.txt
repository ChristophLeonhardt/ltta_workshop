so we've just arrived in Kazakhstan
there is nothing for hundreds of miles
around here and this is the place where
they brought some of the former
Guantanamo detainees to pretty much the
end of the earth salam the original
orange guantanamo jumpsuit we've only
just arrived in kazakhstan and it seems
like half the city's police force is
already trying to figure out what we're
up to
okay how much up in the room she
said he's a free man he doesn't wear
chains on his legs now we see the
reality of the situation
we basically kidnapped a former
Guantanamo detainee
