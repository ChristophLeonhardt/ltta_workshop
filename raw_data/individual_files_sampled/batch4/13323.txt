hey this is drew Clavin at the daily wire I wanted to talk about a book I'm reading a novel I'm reading by a French author guy named Michelle Wie Levesque it's I can't even say how to spell it it's so complicated but if the novel is called submission and no it is not a sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey which I thought it was when I ordered it and I'm very disappointed but no seriously it is a very serious novel by a one of the most provocative writers alive on the most provocative novelists alive it's about the Muslim takeover of France and submission obviously being the translation of Islam and the guy I've read this is the third novel by hollaback I've read and he is there's something so realistic about the way he writes he kind of writes the same story every time he writes the story about a French guy who was absolutely dissolute and if you see pictures of will actually know why it's about a dissolute guy but he's a dissolute French guy smokes sleeps with everything in sight and then suddenly wakes up to find that Muslims are essentially taking over Europe and destroying Europe and there was something about the way he does this that is so realistic and so alert and the reason I wanted to talk about it because I wanted to compare it to some of the American stuff I've been seeing and how white it is and how unattached it is to reality I mean I'm always complaining you know it's not easy to publish a book like this in France by the way my novel Empire of Lies I had a big French contract they paid me for the contract and then they cancelled the book because they were afraid of what I said about Islam in it they have to they still have to pay me but they cancelled the book so it's not easy to get past the censors in France and pull the backs doesn't because he's just so powerful and then provocative they're kind of expecting from it from him but here's the thing this week I also went to see the movie American assassin and I was really excited to see it because it's by Vince Flynn Vince Flynn terrific international thriller writer and an obvious conservative especially when it came to questions of fighting the bad guys and fighting the Islamists and all this and then the thing about American assassin was it's the chief the guy who was credited as the chief screenwriter on it was the guy who wrote the was the chief screenwriter on an adaptation of one of my books true crime and true crimes about a white guy who's on death row possibly because he has been railroaded due to political correctness and when I sat down with the writer of the screenplay he said you know we have to cheat make a few changes it's it's like what we made of a black guy and I thought well that's kind of interesting because it completely wrong foots the entire sense of the book so now an American assassin they write this book and it does have evil Islamists in it but it has all this dialogue suggesting I know this dialogue doesn't come from the novel because the novel takes place in a different time they have all the style look suggesting that there are moderates in Iran and the Obama's Iran deal is such a good thing a wonderful thing but then there are the kind of bad guys in Iran and that's who we're fighting but we're not fighting the good guys in Iran complete fantasy I mean a complete political fantasy and I just can't help thinking there is something about the left-wing monopoly on the arts that makes our arts white and this is one of the reasons I'm always complaining about you know superhero movies it's not that I don't like superhero movies I saw Logan I loved Logan and I thought dr. strange that what it was called dr. strange I thought that was it that was a good one you know there's just so many of them and I sometimes suspect that the reason we are addicted to superhero movies is that we never have to talk about who the real villains are because real villains present a problem you know real villains are real people they have real philosophies they mean they change the way we think about religion about the way we criticize philosophy you know nobody wants to attack other people's religions we know that you know there's been religion oppression for centuries religious oppression for centuries we don't want to do it so we want to kind of empty all content all real content out of American art and I think that's why when I read a book like submission this French novel it suddenly has this bite of reality that is so intense that you just it's like fascinating it's like watching a car accident in a way that you just can't take your eyes away from so much reality that's what the arts are for me that's what they that's when they get great and that's when they really are important so if you want to take a look at this novel it is a serious novel and very but very rich and deep submission by Michelle I think I've got his name right Michelle qui Levesque by the way I'm sure you saw the conversation with a Ben
