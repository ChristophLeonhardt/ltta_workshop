new developments in the stormy Daniels story putting more heat on Trump lawyer Michael Cohen Daniel's about to speak on 60 minutes which has Trump advisers so nervous they might try to block it from airing Cohen now in a behind-the-scenes battle with Daniel's obtaining a new arbitration order against her at a public battle with her lawyer Michael avenatti whose dialing up the pressure and Cohen facing legal filings arguing he violated election law by facilitating that hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment he's also one of the names on Motorz grand jury subpoena and to top it all off news broke on the beat just last night that molars investigators now asking witnesses about Trump lawyers paying women did Mother's folks ask anything that related to these issues around payments to people or women well look they asked if I had ever heard anything about that and my answer is I never have I've never heard you say that publicly before in your FBI interview with Miller we're asking about payments to women they were asking if I knew anything about it so that's a lot and there's plenty that people can criticize Cohen for commentators have called him everything from mysterious and brash to a shady liar that people can make up their own minds about Cohen's actions but as this story escalates there is a focus on the law and it's important to be accurate about the law in question Cohen may have done a shady thing even a dumb thing but based on the legal history this 130 thousand dollar payment itself was probably not a crime and there are two reasons why the first reason is something called the irrespective test and the second reason is john edwards so let's start with a legal rule that goes by this ungainly name irrespective test here's how the Federal Election Commission decides if a candidates paying for a personal or campaign item under the law you cannot use campaign funds for personal costs like vacation or student loans using campaign funds for personal use is prohibited if the expense would exist even in the absence of the candidacy than the personal use ban applies so the law says that if this is an expense candidates pay irrespective of them running for office then look it's a personal expense and the campaign can't pay for it so even though Cohen arranged this payment during the campaign this rule gives him a legal defense that Trump was making hush payments irrespective of being a candidate and of course the New Yorkers Ronan Farrow and the author Michael Woolf have reported on many other Trump hush payments throughout his life so the good news here for Trump and Cohen is they can prevail by publicizing how Trump pays hush money to women all the time the bad news is they'd have to publicize how Trump pays hush money to women all the time but if the payment was personal then think about it this entire complaint against Cohen does fall apart legally the group common cause have been arguing that the payment was a campaign donation and then the Trump campaign broke the law by not reporting it and they say if it was Cohen's money he broke the law by giving more than the twenty seven hundred dollar limit or if he just facilitated money from the Trump organization then that broke the law because such corporate donations are themselves illegal you can see how that would be a big deal but if the original payment was personal not a donation every one of those claims comes crashing down now even if people don't like that outcome it has logic because if the FEC can just decide after an election personal spending should be recategorize as a campaign donation then think about it can't earn basically any candidate into a lawbreaker and since the FEC bans campaigns from using their funds for these personal expenses that would become a kind of a well like a catch-22 and that brings us to John Edwards in 2011 prosecutors charged him on a similar theory they argued the payments he made to a mistress should have been campaign donations the trial showed Edwards was not a sympathetic defendant evidence about him cheating on his wife while she had terminal cancer emerged but Edwards insisted he was a sinner not a criminal while I do not believe I did anything illegal or ever thought I was doing anything illegal I did an awful awful lot that was wrong and there is no one else responsible for my sins the jury agreed they acquitted him on the charge for a two hundred thousand dollar payment from a donor for his mistress sound familiar they did not convict him on any other charges conservative and legal experts agreed a lot of conservatives who didn't don't even like John Edwards thought this case was to use their words appalling they just think thought it was without merit and then it was the government trying to regulate personal conduct we looked this up at the time leading legal groups like Cru and ethics organizations started by some Democrats also opposed the Edwards prosecution saying the entire case rests on finding that the payments to Edwards mistress were in fact campaign contributions but no court has ever interpreted the definition of campaign contribution this broad that was true then about Edwards regardless of what you think of him and it looks to be the case for Michael Cohen today the law doesn't change based on who's sitting at the defendants table the payment to stormy Daniels doesn't look like an illegal campaign donation and that's based here on this FEC rule in the history now let's be clear many questionable things have emerged about Michael Cohen during this whole story and now as I just explained his legal defense may require him to prove these hush payments were common for Trump and thus something they were doing irrespective of being a candidate so Cohen's legal defense is not about denying material that seems incriminating it's actually about publicizing that material himself so legally he may have to take a page from the PlayBook of another strategists killed in battle Eminem who famously won a rap battle by listing off all the negative information about himself saying it proudly and handing the mic to an opponent and saying here tell these people something they don't know about me that can make for an embarrassing mic drop but it is still a mic drop hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
