IN JAMAL KHAISHOGGI'S FINAL PUBLISHED PIECE FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST," HE CALLS FOR ARAB NATIONS TO ALLOW FOR FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. A FREEDOM FOR WHICH HE DIED FIGHTING. LAST NIGHT THE NEWSPAPER RELEASED AN UPON COLUMN THAT HE WROTE BEFORE HE WENT MISSING. IN IT, KHAISHOGGI SAID PART OF THE PROBLEM IS ARAB NATIONS DON'T FACE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHEN THEY DO THINGS LIKE LOCK UP CRITICS OR TAKE OVER NEWSPAPERS. THOSE ACTIONS HE WROTE NO LONGER CARRY THE CONSEQUENCE OF A BACKLASH OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. INSTEAD, THESE ACTIONS MAY TRIGGER CONDEMNATION FOLLOWED BY SILENCE. AS A RESULT, ARAB GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN FREE REIGN TO CONTINUE SILENCING THE MEDIA AT AN INCREASING RATE. THE EDITOR OF THE PIECE SAID SHE RECEIVED IT FROM KHAISHOGGI'S TRANSLATOR AND ASSISTANT THE DAY OF THE COLUMNIST DISAPPEARED. SHE SAID SHE WAS WAITING TO PUBLISH IT HOPING HE WOULD COME BACK AND BE ABLE TO WORK ON IT WITH HER. "THE WASHINGTON POST" EDITORIAL PAGE COLUMNIST FRED HYATT JOINS US. THANKS FOR COMING. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. Shepard: TELL US ABOUT THE DECISION TO POST. WELL, IT WAS BOTH HARD AND EASY, SHEPARD. HARD, AS YOU SAY, IT MEANT ADMITTING TO OURSELVES THAT JAMAL WAS UNLIKELY TO COME BACK AND HELP US EDIT IT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T WANTED TO ADMIT. EASY IN THE SENSE THAT IT WAS SUCH AN AMAZING STATEMENT OF WHAT HE BELIEVED IN, WHAT HE HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE, WHY HE WENT INTO EXILE AND APPARENTLY IF WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS TRUE, THE VALUES OF WHAT HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR. Shepard: KHAISHOGGI WAS CRITICAL OF THE SAUDI KING AND THE CROWN PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF SENDING THE HIT SQUAD TO TURKISH CONSULATE. AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS FOR THE WHAT THE CROWN PRINCE WAS ADVOCATING, THE REFORMS. YES. IT'S UNFATHOMABLE THAT THIS CRIME WAS TAKING PLACE AND WHY A LOT OF US HERE AT THE POST HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING THIS WAS TRUE. JAMAL WAS A PATRIOT. HE BELIEVES THE MIDDLE EAST NEEDED A BRIGHTER FUTURE. HE NEEDED THE REFORMS TO SUCCEED. HE SAW HIMSELF AS A CONSTRUCTIVE CRITIC THAT WAS SAYING IF YOU WANT TO OPEN UP THE KINGDOM, IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE THAN JUST AN OIL PETRO STATE, YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE VIBRANCY OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE. TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO LET THEM SPEAK, EXCHANGE OPINIONS. THE KINGDOM WOULD BE STRONGER IF YOU ALLOWED THAT. THAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT HE WAS DELIVERING. IT'S WHY WE TRANSLATED THERE PIECE INTO ARABIC AND SOME OF HIS OTHER PIECES. HE WANTED THIS MESSAGE TO HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THE REGION. HE VERY MUCH SAW IT AS IN THE INTEREST OF HIS COUNTRY. Shepard: SELF-IMPOSED EXILE LAST YEAR. EXPLAIN WHY AND HOW HE CAME TO THE POST. HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HIS COUNTRY. HE HAD BEEN A JOURNALIST THERE FOR MANY YEARS. SAUDI ARABIA HAS NEVER BEEN A DEMOCRACY. THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SOME RESTRICTIONS. BUT IN 2016, HE BEGAN TO SEE AND 2017 WHEN THE CROWN PRINCE WAS TIGHTENING HIS GRIP, I THINK JAMAL BEGAN TO SEE IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE. THERE WAS EVEN THE LIMITED SPACE THAT HAD EXISTED IN THE PAST WAS GOING AWAY. HE SAID, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE MY COUNTRY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MY COUNTRYMEN THAT CAN'T SPEAK UP AT ALL. THEY'RE IN PRISON OR MUZZLED OTHER WAYS. SO I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SPEAK UP. HE WENT INTO EXILE. HE KNEW HE WAS TAKING RISKS. ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED ANYTHING LIKE THIS ANYMORE THAN THE REST OF US COULD. BECAUSE PEOPLE AT HOME WERE LESS AND LESS ABLE TO EXPRESS OPINIONS. Shepard: HE WROTE AS PART OF THIS COLUMN THAT WAS RELEASED LAST NIGHT THAT THE ARAB WORLD IS FACING ITS OWN VERSION OF AN IRON CURTAIN IMPOSED NOT BY EXTERNAL FACTORS BUT THROUGH DOMESTIC FORCES FOR POWER. DURING THE COLD WAR, RADIO FREE EUROPE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN FOSTER AND SUSTAINING THE HOPE AND FREEDOM. ARABS NEED SOMETHING SIMILAR. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT HE TALKED ABOUT OFTEN? IS THIS PART OF HIS MESSAGE? HE DID. YOU KNOW, IN 2011 WHEN THERE WAS THE BRIEF ARAB SPRING, I THINK HE SAW LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARABS ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY ELSE. THEY WANT THE DIGNITY OF FREEDOM, THEY WANT TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. UNTIL THEN, THERE'S THIS MIX OF OH, THE ARAB DON'T WANT DEMOCRACY. OF COURSE, EVERYBODY WANTS THAT DIGNITY. WHEN THE ARAB STRING COLLAPSED, HE BEGAN TO THINK ESPECIALLY LAST YEAR, TALKED TO US AND OTHERS ABOUT CREATING SOME KIND OF PLATFORM WHERE THESE VOICES COULD BE HEARD. SOME WAY THAT WE COULD REACH PEOPLE IN THESE COUNTRIES WHERE THEIR OWN PRESS IS NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK WITH A DIVERSE DEBATE. Shepard: FRED HIATT FROM "THE
