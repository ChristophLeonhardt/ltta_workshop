people here escaped the earthquake and tsunami but the fight for survival goes on in parlour parks have become refugee camps for those who have nowhere else to go their houses were destroyed many family members killed now they use whatever they can find to build shelters while still struggling to comprehend what's happened to them my sister was trapped under a wall they managed to get her out but she died my mother-in-law is still missing there is some food being given out but it's well short of what's needed there's still a lack of basic supplies around the affected areas including here in the heart of pilu city where people have been camping for a week despite all the money from the Indonesian government and all the offers of assistance from foreign governments no one's been able to supply the people here with temporary toilets or adequate shelter part of this camp is on the grounds of the mayor's office those sheltering here say he's only been to see them once when the Indonesian president was in town we asked the mayor for an interview but his staff declined refugees say that grateful for the land to sleep on but they need more help I can tell you there are some toilets over there but they are full of excrement so I eat only once a day so I don't have to go maybe everyone is okay at the moment but if they don't sort it out we will have disease here some people are waiting for space on military flights out others say they have nowhere to fly to everyone is scared of more earthquakes and wondering when or if they'll be able to go home
