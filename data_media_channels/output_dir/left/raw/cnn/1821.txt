1
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,770
Michelle Cox Eugene Connor and their
five-year-old daughter Cynthia lived in

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,169
this once beautiful neighborhood on st.
Thomas overlooking the US Virgin Islands

3
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:20,580
and all of their beauty obviously it had
a great view and you know things were

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,279
great for four years but you know when
that's it

5
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,040
it was a bad location last week when
Hurricane Emma came roaring through

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,600
their home crumbled on top of them I was
stuffing towels into the rafters to stop

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:50,190
the leaks from coming in and they was
screaming a man who they say knew their

8
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,280
landlord was watching from across the
valley

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:04,620
he says I'll get you her we slid from
one end slammed into the other side we

10
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,400
couldn't get up the win was just pushing
us against it I then came out and he

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:26,760
grabbed Cynthia and ran out the door and
it was John and Dalton waiting for us we

12
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,720
didn't know and had no idea who he was
he was a complete stranger yes

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,310
he's just bravest guy and a whole world
him and his son I mean height of a storm

14
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,870
trees are falling down
rain coming down like crazy the winds

15
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,400
were up to almost 200 miles per hour
they were telling us he just drove in

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,350
and out leaving to get us I just see the
roof line that way when we were running

17
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:59,400
and as a miracle didn't hit his truck
what had happened if he hadn't come I

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,660
really believe was we would have been
dead

19
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:11,850
just the level of destruction I mean
we're at least seriously injured so

20
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,190
we're very grateful John and his son
took these videos of the storm on their

21
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,070
way to the rescue he is now letting them
stay in his house and across the island

22
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,230
people like Eugene and Michelle have
also lost their homes to Irma the worst

23
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,540
storm that natives say they've ever
experienced on this island many say they

24
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,410
will stay to help rebuild but Michelle
and Eugene are not sure our extended

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,120
family as we call them you know then
friends that we made and shared things

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,060
but for years we want to stay with them
and rebuild and we start out lies

27
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:08,709
it's hard to get food water yes it took
us for now they are simply in shock over

28
00:03:08,709 --> 00:00:00,000
what they've lost everything counterfeit
good thing John
