45
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,407

00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,175
HATRED ON THAT CHANNEL.

47
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:21,480

00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,453

WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION.

66
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,010
THAT'S WHY THE MEDIA IS NOT

67
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,410

00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:01,888
BRINGING PEACE TO THE WORLD

75
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,557

76
00:02:04,557 --> 00:00:00,000
