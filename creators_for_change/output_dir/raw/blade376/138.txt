00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this isn't the</font>

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:05,520
most well produced video I've ever made

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,480
but um it was just an in the moment

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,639
thing I had to do I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> my high</font>

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,740
definition cameras as I taken a lot of

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,719
footage about what I'm about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,150
about and I guess I'll make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,990
when i get home to England and I'm able

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to upload the footage and edit it but I</font>

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give my initial thoughts</font>

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,980
because I'm I'm really really buzzing

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,219
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kearney in florida in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sarasota with</font>

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,350
my family who I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visit in Boston</font>

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,390
and the reason I'm here is because I'm

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,219
my parents wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I wanted</font>

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,800
for my birthday in February I said I

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,750
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet a man called Jacque</font>

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,390
fresco it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is who is</font>

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,660
Jacque fresco and to be honest I

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,969
wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a an</font>

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,860
explanation that would give them an

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,680
justice so um I guess what i can do is

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,039
and point you to a few links which i'll

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,559
put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the description jacque fresco is</font>

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,769
a 95 year old man who<font color="#CCCCCC"> has worked his</font>

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,049
entire life on something which is now

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,619
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Venus Project and all i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

28
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,990
to say really is this isn't about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">video of saying check it out and believe</font>

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,290
everything you see it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to have a</font>

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,570
look at it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be inspired</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

32
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">people often ask what inspires</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and</font>

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,240
since just before<font color="#E5E5E5"> christmas and this</font>

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,090
man's research had opened my mind and to

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,950
be honest I was so overwhelmed of it and

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,590
I got quite depressed not be up at four

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,150
in the morning and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to go on</font>

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,070
my live show just like a talk to people

39
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,740
because like we have to do something and

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,659
his works as an entire life and as I

41
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:46,979
said it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the Venus Project he is</font>

42
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,869
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> researched on a wide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> range of</font>

43
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,090
different disciplines he doesn't believe

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,680
in narrowing your field of view on on

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,860
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one project and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been just on</font>

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,530
psychology or just on engineering you

47
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,210
should actually have a general

48
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,770
understanding of everything because then

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,810
you can learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and you'll be more</font>

50
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,460
constructive in

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,250
variety and he's designed a circular

52
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,040
city which is self-sustaining and you

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,670
may ask why this is important because

54
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,560
the truth is regardless about happy we

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,510
are with life at the moment the question

56
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,020
I'd ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is can we really keep living</font>

57
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,080
at the current standard we we are today

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,030
because the truth is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a finite</font>

59
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,490
planet we can't keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever and</font>

60
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,730
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live with accordance to the</font>

61
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,470
carrying capacity of the world

62
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,580
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a lot of</font>

63
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,230
problems in society today things that

64
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,780
I'm working on at the moment I read in a

65
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,500
newspaper just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> month ago about how the</font>

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,860
British government was paying wind

67
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,630
turbine company's money hundreds of

68
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,840
thousands of pounds to stop producing

69
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,620
renewable energy because the production

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,620
of the energy brought down the price

71
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,270
because the more you supply of something

72
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price goes down and they didn't</font>

73
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,080
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so they paid these renewable</font>

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,410
energy factories or wind turbines to

75
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">stop producing because those producing</font>

76
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,530
it through other non renewable forms

77
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,060
their price was going down and it's the

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,460
same with farming<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know um</font>

79
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,860
governments will find a farmer if he<font color="#E5E5E5"> /</font>

80
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,380
produce a particular food or crop by

81
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,290
fighting him so actually a farmer if he

82
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,690
was producing<font color="#E5E5E5"> milk and would make more</font>

83
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,260
money producing a certain amount of milk

84
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,940
than if he produced moxa few produce

85
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,160
more he'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fined so he was making less</font>

86
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,380
money than if he produced that much so

87
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,090
it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be down here if that makes sense</font>

88
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,660
and being efficient is actually

89
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,760
detrimental to making profit I could go

90
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,440
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from now for the end of time</font>

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a conversation I'd love to</font>

92
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,920
have with all of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a on a live show</font>

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,780
of mine or something but I'm I went to

94
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,250
visit him in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Florida to</font>

95
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,330
our journey and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Venus Florida and it was</font>

96
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,550
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> six hour talk he took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his round he's</font>

97
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,650
designed the home she lives in which are

98
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,440
all circular<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their heated by the</font>

99
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,870
Sun and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put the</font>

100
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,149
footage up and he's 95 years old and

101
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,010
he's so on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boat and he just gets it</font>

102
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,960
there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I may not</font>

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,310
with with him but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

104
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,270
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that inspire you to think is</font>

105
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,500
education as I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> said before isn't</font>

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the transfer of information from</font>

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
one person to another it's inspiring

108
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,949
people to question and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-hour</font>

109
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,479
journey back home I was worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

110
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking my dad really because my dad's</font>

111
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,900
happy with life and I didn't want him<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

112
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,419
go there and sort of be shaken up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

113
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,090
don't know this thing direct stick like

114
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,090
what his job was saying net1 but he

115
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,160
definitely took something away which was

116
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,990
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of almost had</font>

117
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,039
two kids and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of it</font>

118
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,080
because although I research so much of

119
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,380
it it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just amazing and although he</font>

120
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,060
was down talking the way government's

121
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,039
run today or the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

122
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is no such thing as a gifted human</font>

123
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,729
being we are products of our environment

124
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,009
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you're a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> artist it was</font>

125
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,930
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you took a roots of life which</font>

126
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,479
led you to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good artist it wasn't</font>

127
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,400
because you were bored with an artistic

128
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,919
gene so to speak and we guessed this

129
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,259
topic from now the end of time but

130
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that it was about appreciating</font>

131
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,120
what is the realities of society and he

132
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,440
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about you know how</font>

133
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,270
inventions were never made by one

134
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,699
individual and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually stumbled</font>

135
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,130
across by someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm through trial and</font>

136
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,500
error you know he said the wheel when it

137
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,780
was invented<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't some guy he says</font>

138
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,639
his a wheel what do you think it was

139
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,169
probably when a tree fell over in the

140
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,330
forest and maybe fell on another tree

141
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,919
and when they went to it they realized

142
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,949
the tree rolled and they realized that

143
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:55,139
could actually be used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and</font>

144
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,159
then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they realized as they were</font>

145
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,960
rolling it it got stopped by a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

146
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,580
bark they would have shaved the bark off

147
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,830
and made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a smooth circle or in terms</font>

148
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">of making steps when people used to live</font>

149
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,490
in caves when they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> went up to</font>

150
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,380
the cave you would put your foot on the

151
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,289
vertical bits of rock and you'd go from

152
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,500
each bit not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> swype on the horizontal</font>

153
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,030
bits of rock he wouldn't step on the on

154
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,520
the vertical bits but over time it

155
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,530
wearing away would make steps and

156
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,889
therefore when he lived somewhere else

157
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,300
they would know to make steps to make it

158
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,250
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to those places so these</font>

159
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">are just Inklings of what he was talking</font>

Larry King it's 40 minutes long but it

165
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,650
was in 1974 when he was 16 something

166
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,139

heart to keep going um where was I um

170
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,740
yes so the 1974 interview with Larry

171
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,710
King<font color="#E5E5E5"> but don't assume that everything he</font>

172
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,509
says has to be taken you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that he's</font>

173
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,949
learned stuff because he says there's no

174
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,780
final frontier in life the example he

175
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,000
gives us a laptop you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't have the</font>

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,560
best laptop and that's it there's no

177
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,020
utopia you know once you've built the

178
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,990
best buy a thing based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your knowledge</font>

179
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,240
up to then you then find fault of it and

180
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,599
then you can improve it and that's how

181
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,479
society should work the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> interview</font>

182
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,909
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more recent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one with a new zealand</font>

183
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,990
a new zealand TV station which was

184
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,449
really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good and then is there any</font>

185
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:40,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">other ones i might put a lecture of when</font>

186
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,310
he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about expectations saying</font>

187
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,729
that in life and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you</font>

188
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,740
project and expectation about something

189
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,690
and it doesn't happen you may be

190
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,120
disappointed or hurt but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

191
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,650
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened in the real</font>

192
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,810
world is based on your expectation your

193
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,870
projections I just I when I see my

194
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,419
friends in bands or I see my friends in

195
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:09,039
the YouTube community I've gone to I've

196
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,139
gone to friends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the street and I just</font>

197
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,259
said if I could spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour talking to</font>

198
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,659
you about this but it would change the

199
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,610
way you see your life forever do you

200
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,930
want to know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of times they say</font>

201
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,610
yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are people I thought we'd</font>

202
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,020
never listens to me and by the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

203
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,759
it's changed their the way they see

204
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,849
their life and I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave on</font>

205
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,360
this court really conspiracy theorists

206
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,490
exists in the world you know people

207
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,409
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like those that rock the boat in</font>

208
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,839
question society is good to question

209
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,520
society but in a constructive way

210
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,320
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no point saying the government</font>

211
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,029
is if you haven't got a solution

212
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">this man has solutions which are just</font>

213
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,579
absolutely incredible this is not saying

214
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:49,310
that everything he

215
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,200
they should be implemented he's saying

216
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have some better come forward</font>

217
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,210
with it and my education awareness

218
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,279
project the universal solutions project

219
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,690
has really taken off in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past few</font>

220
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,560
months and the way I see it is educating

221
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,720
the population and giving people a

222
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,910
website that when st. bad happens they

223
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,650
can go to it and say here's all the

224
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,480
information here are potential solutions

225
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,070
based on research and not political

226
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,770
opinion they will go to that instead of

227
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,029
government and wondering why they're not

228
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">responding because if things do get ugly</font>

229
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">in society wouldn't it be better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font>

230
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">general population was educated because</font>

231
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,240
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of people feel oh I can't</font>

232
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,250
contribute I don't understand and I

233
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">think so many people out there</font>

234
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,170
underestimate themselves because that we

235
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,080
can all understand and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

236
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,339
do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to dedicate a month</font>

237
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:38,990
later this year want me to give out my

238
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">skype details and my email address and</font>

239
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,510
I'm gonna for a complete month dedicate

240
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,100
my time to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who wants to</font>

241
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,720
contact me and have a conversation I

242
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,490
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend that time talking to you</font>

243
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,470
about this because it makes so much

244
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,390
sense and I know we can change the world

245
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the better but it takes small steps</font>

246
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to begin with and then we can take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

247
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,800
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this man showed me</font>

284
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,030
try and tackle them this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about</font>

285
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,520
saying everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe everything this</font>

286
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,380
man says I would check out and blindly

287
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,290
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> questioned it it's good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to question</font>

288
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,210
in life because by questioning and if

289
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,490
you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites proven wrong it's like as</font>

290
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,770
I say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know being told that you're</font>

291
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,930
wrong doesn't mean anything if you're

292
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,030
proven that you're wrong or shown that

293
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,860
you're wrong it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've been</font>

294
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,270
showing the right way of doing it and

295
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can progress in the right direction</font>

296
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,170
and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just become such a better</font>

297
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,700
person I've become much more patient

298
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,830
with people because if people are

299
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,010
ignorant or if people for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example a</font>

300
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,590
racist than that I realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

301
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,000
product<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their environment the way</font>

302
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,620
they were brought up that's not to say

303
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,570
we should excuse it but keeping that in

304
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,550
mind we might have a bit more patience

305
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,650
with no patience but understanding with

306
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,220
people and we'll do what we can to show

307
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,900
them the right way but what the right

308
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,030
way is obviously subjective in many ways

309
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation I guess we can</font>

310
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">have for another time so if you also</font>

311
