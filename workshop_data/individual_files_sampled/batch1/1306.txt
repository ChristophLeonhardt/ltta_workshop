North Korea to close its nuclear test site and Kim jong-un says the world can watch it being dismantled Pyongyang wants to focus on economic growth after the historic summit with South Korea a marked departure from hostile rhetoric how will this play out though inside North Korea this is inside story hello there and welcome to the program I'm Nora Kyle leader Kim jong-un has promised to shut down North Korea's nuclear test site next month he reiterated the pledge during his summit with South Korea's president moon jae-in on Friday but there's no word on the future of his ballistic missiles program nor were they'll bow to demands from the US president to get rid of nuclear weapons altogether Cathy Novick has this report from Seoul the world saw the smiles and handshakes on Friday now the South Korean president's office is revealing more of what was said behind closed doors at the historic summit South Korea says Kim jong-un promised to close the punggye-ri nuclear test center next month and invited American and South Korean experts and journalists to inspect it days before the summit North Korea announced it would shut down the site of all six nuclear bomb tests kim referred to speculation that test explosions had so badly damaged the site it couldn't have been used again anyway she don't chairman Kim said when they come they will see that we have two bigger tunnels than the current test facilities and they are in good condition the willingness to allow visitors to the test center appears to be another concession before the planned summit with Donald Trump and the North Koreans but this is necessary precondition for any kind of negotiations because if they don't say that that they won't eventually to surrender their nuclear weapons nobody is going to talk to them moon phoned the US president to brief him on the inter-korean talks the declaration signed there included a broad reference to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Trump and moon agreed that more specific measures on getting rid of nuclear weapons should be discussed at the US president's meeting with Kim Kim jong-un is also reported to have said even though the United States is inherently hostile towards North Korea once they talk with us they will get to know that I am not the kind of person to launch nuclear weapons towards the south or target the United States across the Pacific South Korea says Kim intends to eliminate another sign of division by changing Pyongyang's time zone by half an hour to realign with the South North Korea set its clocks back three years ago saying then that Japanese imperialists had imposed Tokyo time when Korea was an occupied colony moon also briefed japan's Prime Minister and told Shinzo Abe a that he'd conveyed Japan's willingness for talks with North Korea a willingness Kim jong-un said was mutual Kathy Novick al Jazeera Seoul let's bring in our guests now and joining us in Geneva Tarek Rolf former head of the verification and security policy coordination office at the International Atomic Energy Agency and in Seoul via Skype Peter Ward a writer for NK news who researches the North Korean economy great to have you both with us thanks for joining inside story Tarek first of all how much of a big deal is it that Kim jong-un is shutting down this nuclear test site well I think this is to demonstrate now that he is serious in negotiating with the United States on North Korea's nuclear weapon program and by earlier announcing the halt of ballistic missile tests and further nuclear weapon tests and then adding to that the closure of the nuclear test site is to basically show that he is serious and he is putting some chips on the table okay so that's the why but how significant is this test site in itself I mean some people say that it's been damaged anywhere and can no longer be used so is this a significant move on the part of the North Koreans well the Bunge test site in North Korea has two portals there is the South portal which is the one apparently that has suffered damage or collapse according to Chinese news sources but they also have a West Portal so even if the South portal were disabled North Korea still has one portal or tunnel which has subsidiary tunnels in which further nuclear tests could be carried out but by announcing the closure of the test site North Korea becomes only the second country that has ever exploded nuclear weapons after France - a noun the closure of its nuclear weapon testing site okay does it have other testing sites in the country that we that we know or that we suspect off we don't know of any other testing sites normally these would be picked up by satellite because one either needs to dig horizontal tunnels or vertical tunnels to carry out nuclear weapon tests and these cannot easily be camouflaged okay beta Kim jong-un has said that inspectors can come in inspectors from South Korea inspectors from the US as well as journalists to see the shutting down of the site for themselves are you surprised to see North Korea opening up like that not especially I mean they have invited journalists and they've invited inspectors before and they've definitely invited journalists to you view not only a parades but also the demolition of the young beyond the tower at the younger nuclear sites so I mean it doesn't zone is doesn't know yes so I mean they have invited in journalists before to witness them supposedly dismantled nuclear facilities so yeah yeah it was between the two of us it was 2008 I believe it was still a decades ago isn't it it's a long time that no one has been in to look at these sites no accident and that's because dial-up broke down and the North pursued rapid acceleration of its nuclear and missile program especially over the last so why do you think at this particular point in time we're seeing these concessions being made I mean there are a number of reasons why they could be making these concessions I'm afraid I can't read human's mind and I don't have access to the corridors of power so I'm not absolutely I can't be certain about any of these reasons but one of them would probably be to get relief from sanctions so there's been an unprecedented rise in the intensity of sanctions with China actually implementing sanctions on the importation of oil into North Korea the export of North Korean coal both Korean textiles North Korean labor the Russians have stopped renewing visas for North Korean workers I mean so presidented neurotic economic blockade a North Korean exports have fallen off a cliff and the North Korean economy as yet does not show signs of really suffering but that might be a reason and look they were emphasizing the economy in their propaganda right now they're declaring victory in the nuclear component of their yunjin a tool development line and now they're saying they're going to focus all efforts on the economy so that might be one reason and the reason might be the threat of war the Trump administration president Trump had said that all options are on the table including military options rumors continue to swirl haven't apparently swallowed Washington about the idea of implanting those strike potentially or the possibility of having to forcibly denuclearize the country through an attack on nuclear facilities and that France might be consumed tarek um two potential reasons for making concessions there I have a big question do you think North Korea would ever actually fire a nuclear weapon well first of all I'd like to state that even though inspectors were there before these were from the IAEA and they were only inspecting civilian facilities so no international inspectors or personnel have ever seen or inspected any component of North Korea's nuclear weapon program other than dr. Siegfried Hecker who was shown there uranium enrichment plant and some plutonium some years ago secondly if North Korea is to denuclearize it needs to also bring in not only the International Atomic Energy Agency but also the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban Treaty Organization which is the only international entity that has the credibility to verify the closure of the North Korean nuclear weapon test site just because American and South Korean diplomats or officials might visit the site is not sufficient for international credibility with regard to your question about whether North Korea would ever fire a nuclear weapon I seriously doubt that I also seriously doubt that the United States would mount a pre-emptive attack on North Korea's nuclear facilities because North Korea is holding Seoul hostage with conventional weapons and there is no sure way of ensuring that North Korea's nuclear weapon capability could be wiped out in a pre-emptive attack and millions or thousands hundreds of thousands of South Koreans would be killed in a retaliatory non-nuclear non nuclear attack nevertheless the nuclear deterrent card has really worked hasn't it because we've it's brought Kim to the Chinese the South Korean and by the end of the month the US tables yes so in that sense Kim jong-un has been very clever and successful by continuing ballistic missile tests and nuclear weapon tests despite crippling international sanctions he announced after the last test in September after he announced that a thermonuclear device had been tested that the nuclear weapon development program was complete and he made the similar announcement after the long-range missile test that potentially could reach the United States that the missile program was complete and then he proceeded to make these overtures to South Korea and to the United States to come to the table and by offering to now officially to suspend missile tests and nuclear tests and to close the nuclear weapon test site it's basically to deal with the trust deficit that the United States South Korea and the international community has with regard to previous North Korean actions with respect to previous agreements that had been reached because Kim played a very clever diplomatic game here oh yeah absolutely I mean see the way that he played the Chinese and the Americans up against each other I mean I you could say that the Trump administration pursuing a trade war with China while trying to negotiate with North Korea as well may be a bit of an own-goal I'm not sure but I would say yes Kim as emulated his father and his grandfather in playing an absolute diplomatic blinder yeah I think I just want one further point and what I was saying earlier I think that another reason they may have stopped nuclear missile tests and come to the table so they actually do think their program is at a sufficient level they might be satisfied with the level of scientific you know different level of missile and nuclear domes as they are so there are other domestic that may be wearing on cubes monk okay we will explore the issue of denuclearization just a little bit more in a moment first of all I just want to bring in some economic facts because it is widely believed that sanctions brought kim jeong-hoon to the negotiating table the scarcity of reliable data however means that information on the extent of North Korea's economic pain can be rather contradictory sanctions introduced by the UN Security Council since September have targeted North Korea's main exports such as coal iron ore and textiles they've also cut the regime's imports of refined petroleum products by as much as 90% but defectors and recent visitors say consumer prices and exchange rates have remained stable and some analysts suggest the regime has adapted to international sanctions by adopting reforms that have made the economy more decentralized and productive say Peter we mentioned before that Kim had expressed this desire now to focus on the North Korean economy what do we know about how that economy is faring so the economy itself is done pretty well over the last 20 years last 15 years not 20 years it's recovered from the shock and shock of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the North Korean famine in which hundreds of thousands people died and they start to turn the corner in the early 2000s but what happened was markets increasingly came to dominate in many sectors of the economy in transport in mining even in foreign trade now markets illegal actual physical markets illegal and then almost 500 of them in the country but at the same time many market activities remain illegal so the sale of certain products the production of certain products inside state industry okay so the production of certain products is lots of illegal and then many forms of private enterprise are illegal so producing things inside your house is generally speaking legal so farming your own private gun or you know producing eggs or sowing you know soy garments inside your house is absolutely fine the moment you start working doing what a lot of North Korea pronounce doing which is register cards with state interest enterprise and start your own bus company haulage firm perhaps you know fortunate partnership stick to most manager and producing apartments smuggling and smuggling through a lot of these practices that still but under Kim jong-un there have been changes because coming and going and I'm just going to use the opportunity just to go and bring a Tareq bag in listening to this I mean it sounds like the economy is surviving and it's adapting and it's making ways to be self-sufficient so is that the general belief that sanctions are working or not well I agree with Peter that the economy has grown if we look at the report by the World Bank on the DPRK their economy grew a very small amount of 1.5 or so percent despite sanctions I personally know some people who very recently visited Pyongyang to speak with officials from the foreign ministry and other ministries they are frequent visitors if they can see changes on the streets more people are better dressed people have more cell phones there are more taxis restaurants are full of North Koreans eating and this is not just a show so the economy is somehow surviving normally a country that makes the decision to make a WMD program or weapons of mass destruction program they will tighten their belt to make available the resources that are needed such as Pakistan South Africa India and in the past yeah that was gonna be my next question I mean how much money goes into a WMD program well one can do it very extensively and one can also do it reasonably cheaply even though cheap is not cheap it's still several tens of millions of dollars but the North Koreans have only carried out six nuclear tests and maybe 40 or so in all ballistic missile tests so one could probably put an I'm a hundred million or 150 million although no one can be exactly sure this is an amount that North Korea can easily afford and it's brought North Korea to a position now where the President of the United States the strongest military power of the world is preparing to meet with the North Korean leader face-to-face and the North Koreans are portraying this as a meeting of equals okay so Peter of that money whatever the figure is is suddenly made available it's presumably going to be injected into the North Korean economy given that Kim jong-un has said that he wants to focus on it what changes do you think he actually wants to make so I think the Kim jong-un basically wants to there's a tension between economic liberalisation and social control a real tension and if you look at the reforms that have been implemented up until now at least the reforms I have been able to find communities so far interested in maintaining and expanding personal economic you know people to engage in market activities on a personal basis at learn houses or investing their own money into existing state-owned enterprises but he's also under his rule at least private enterprise means okay so we would sing potentially economic reforms there as Peter says Taric are we going to see any kind of reforms in the nuclear program well first of all if we look at Kim jong-un's New Year's speech he went into great detail about economic reforms and the sectors where he wants to reform the economy and build it up with regard to the nuclear program again it's the question of what does be nuclearization mean does it mean only the complete irreversible dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons or does it also mean dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear power and civilian nuclear program and on the other side does it also include the removal of US nuclear security guarantees and extended deterrence provided to South Korea and also to Japan in my understanding denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should mean they're removable the removal of all nuclear weapons whether these are North Korean nuclear weapons or nuclear guarantees provided by an external power such as the United States - to South Korea but South Korea will need civilian nuclear energy or nuclear power to power its development and if you remember in the past in 1994 there was a great framework between the United States and North Korea under which it was going to dismantle its existing nuclear power reactors and Korean energy development organization would build - like water reactors about 1,000 megawatts each but that deal eventually collapsed and then North Korea left the non-proliferation treaty in 2003 so now the demand of the international community is not only the dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons but also a return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear weapon state and the full implementation of International Atomic Energy safeguards on the civilian nuclear program and I would recommend a joint team of nuclear weapon experts from China Russia and the United States that would oversee the accountability and dismantling of North Korean nuclear weapons which is the only credible way and then finally the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty organization to be brought in to verify the closure of the nuclear test site and for the executive secretary of the CTBT or dr. elicina Zerbo to be consulted for technical inputs and also to have a direct face-to-face meeting with kim jong-un but do you think Kim jong-un has got any intention any real intention for complete denuclearization well it's still early days and I think the international community is becoming very impatient we've just had a few hours of direct meeting between the South Korean and North Korean presidents there's a lot of rhetoric flying around between Pyongyang and and Washington and then you have what's called the pundit area tour the think tanks and experts in the Washington Beltway all of whom are pontificating as to what needs to be done so I think we need to be patient this negotiation if it starts this going to take several months it will have many technical elements for example it took the Russians and the Americans under President Obama nearly two years to negotiate the new strategic reductions freely it took nearly 12 years for the joint comprehensive plan of action to be negotiated with Iran and the other countries so I don't think we need we should be impatient or expect too much too soon and I think and if the media can also play a very responsible role by damping down unrealistic expectations or irrational exuberance to put it in another way okay Peter Gill thought I saw you shaking your head when I asked that question do you think Kim jong-un is about to give up his nuclear weapons I mean you can look at their media as reasonably reliable signaling mechanism and so far they've been there was one reference to new nuclearization in the newspaper yesterday at summit there was they printed the payment declaration in full and there was only one reference I could find in six pages of their official newspaper so I don't see any serious commitments to denuclearization on the terms that's the Trump and moon administration's weaken that Xi Jinping president Chinese President Xi Jinping would like to see I see similar rhetoric to what we saw in the late 1980s in the 1990s in the 2000s which is that they are that they are they want to have denuclearization on all sides okay we're losing you again I'm going to have to just leave it there and go back to terik talk what do you think will be the best outcome of these talks on the Korea's Peninsula and absorb the upcoming talks with US President Donald Trump I think the best outcome would be for the North Korean leader and at present Trump to reach a political overall framework for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the TEC then the technical and legal experts can get to work over the coming months to draft an agreement that both sides can sign and in the meantime there can be confidence-building measures such as the visit by the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban Treaty Organization to the nuke weapon testing site inspectors from the IAEA to go to the non-military part of the North Korean nuclear program and as I mentioned a nuclear weapon experts team composed of Chinese Russian and American experts engaging with North Korean nuclear weapon ears to define the next steps and eventually once the warheads dismantled it's the nuclear material that is critical that would need to be sequestered and placed under IAEA seal so that that material can never be reused for nuclear weapons the absent nuclear material one cannot reconstitute their nuclear warhead this is just in the last minute that we have we're talking about big changes here how is the North Korean elite going to sell these changes to the people I don't think that will ever get that far down the road we didn't last time and if they were to deconstruct their nuclear program they would leave themselves open to a foreign attack and they don't want that and they would like to avoid that at all costs okay all right well thank you very much both of you for joining us we'll have to leave the discussion there of course we'll keep closely watching developments there in North Korea many thanks to
