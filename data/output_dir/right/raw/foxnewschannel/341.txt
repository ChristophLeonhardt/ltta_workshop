THE MOST IMPORTANT

26
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:50,237
INSTITUTIONS.

27
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:51,205
IN A SPLIT INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW,

28
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:51,939
ROY BLUNT, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE

00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:55,542
GOOD TO SEE THIS MORNING THANK

32
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:56,143
YOU FOR JOINING US.

33
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:57,778
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, MARIA.

34
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:58,779
MARIA: DO YOU AGREE THAT THE

35
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,180
FIGHT IS NOT OVER YET?

36
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:07,955
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE WHERE THE

37
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:08,689
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN WITH FROM

38
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,023
DAY ONE.

39
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:09,723
SENATOR SCHUMER SAID HE WOULD

40
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:11,158
DO ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP

41
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,859
BRETT KAVANAUGH FROM GOING ON

42
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,526
THE COURT.THEY ARE MAKING A

43
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:13,494
BIG MISTAKE.

44
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:14,228
HOLDING THIS INFORMATION,

45
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:14,962
ROLLING IT OUT IN THE MOST

46
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:15,596
UNFAIR WAY TO EVERYBODY

47
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,431
INVOLVED AFTER THEY HAVE HAD IT

48
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:19,433
FOR MONTHS.

49
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:21,135
NOT TALKING ABOUT IF WE GET IN

50
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:24,905
CHARGE WE WILL LOOK AT THIS IN

51
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:25,639
SOME OTHER WAY.

52
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,941
FRANKLY WHAT THEY'VE MANAGED TO

53
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:30,210
DO IS LEGITIMIZE THE REPUBLICAN

54
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:30,944
BASE IN A WAY THAT USUALLY THE

55
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:31,945
PARTY JUST WON A PRESIDENTIAL

56
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:35,482
ELECTION, IS NOT ENERGIZED IN

57
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:36,784
THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE.

58
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:37,551
BUT THE WAY REALLY CONTINUED TO

59
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,086
DO IS THIS UNFAIR, REALLY

60
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:43,957
TOTALLY UNREALISTIC BEHAVIOR OF

61
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:48,162
GUILTY ON UNTIL PROVEN

62
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:49,129
INNOCENT.

63
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,464
WHAT WE CAN DO TO STOP

64
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:51,365
POLITICAL OPPONENTS FROM BEING

65
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:57,471
ABLE TO DO WHAT VOTERS PUT THEM

66
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:58,138
IN PLACE TODAY.I JUST DON'T

67
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:58,872
THINK IT WORKS.

68
00:01:58,873 --> 00:01:59,506
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM.

69
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:00,240
FRANKLY, I THINK THE MORE THEY

70
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:01,909
TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS

71
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,077
THAT THE CONGRESSMAN APPARENTLY

72
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:04,144
HAS SAID, THEY CANNOT STOP THEM

73
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:11,151
AND THEY OBVIOUSLY, THINK THIS

74
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:11,885
IS A POLITICAL TACTIC THAT

75
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:12,352
WORKS FOR THEM.

76
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:14,354
I DON'T THINK IT WORKS AT ALL.

77
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:15,823
MARIA: WHAT DO THE MIDTERMS

78
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:16,523
LOOK LIKE AT THIS POINT FROM

79
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:16,990
YOUR STANDPOINT?

80
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,058
HAVE THINGS CHANGED, GIVEN THE

81
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:23,831
LEVEL OF HATE AND HACK ON THE

82
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:24,131
LEFT?

83
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:25,833
>> THINGS HAVE CHANGED, WE WILL

84
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:26,800
SEE IN FOUR WEEKS AND A COUPLE

85
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:27,468
OF DAYS HOW MUCH THEY HAVE

86
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:27,801
CHANGED.

87
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:31,004
IT IS CLEAR THAT THINGS HAVE

88
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:31,972
CHANGED AGAIN, CONSERVATIVE

89
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,373
VOTERS, REPUBLICAN VOTERS,

90
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:34,241
CONSTITUTIONAL CONSERVATIVES

91
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:35,943
ARE ENERGIZED LIKE THEY WERE

92
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:37,578
NOT BEFORE.

93
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,947
IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM

94
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:41,648
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT IS HOW

95
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:42,382
SHORT THE NEWS CYCLE IS AND WE

96
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:43,951
WILL SEE WHETHER THIS IS

97
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,819
SUSTAINED OR NOT.

98
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,386
I BELIEVE IT WILL BE.

99
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:50,057
I THINK THE TACTICS USED BY

100
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:51,825
DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE, THE

101
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,260
OBVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS,

102
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:53,861
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THAT

103
00:02:53,862 --> 00:02:56,163
COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE WERE

104
00:02:56,164 --> 00:03:00,200
PURSUING, JUST LOOK LIKE THE

105
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:05,506
POLITICS DOESN'T EVER END, IT'S

106
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:07,040
GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL AND NOW

107
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:07,708
THEY WANT TO CARRY IT INTO

108
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:08,208
DEARLY GOVERNING.

109
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,146
I THINK IT IS NOT GOING TO

110
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:16,150
WORK, JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS

111
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,286
PROBABLY THE MOST INVESTIGATED,

112
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,020
VETTED PERSON MAY BE IN HISTORY

113
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,489
OF CONFIRMATION PIT SEVEN

114
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,223
CONFIRMATIONS.

115
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:23,924
NOTHING THAT, AND BY THE WAY,

116
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:24,625
EVERY ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS,

117
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:27,494
EVERY ONE OF THOSE SEVEN

118
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:28,195
BACKGROUND CHECKS, QUESTIONS

119
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:33,967
ABOUT DRINKING OR HAVE THEY

120
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,335
EVER HEARD ANY THING THAT THEY

121
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:35,903
SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON.

122
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:39,106
ONE REASON ACTUAL BACKGROUND

123
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:39,940
CHECKS THEMSELVES NEED TO

124
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:44,144
REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL IS, YOU

125
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,179
NEVER WANT PEOPLE TO BE

126
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,913
HESITANT TO SAY, I DO NOT KNOW

127
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:46,647
IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT BUT I

128
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:51,285
HEARD THIS.THAT IS WHAT

129
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:52,052
HAPPENED WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH

130
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:52,452
SEVEN TIMES.

131
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:53,487
NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD ANYTHING.

132
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:55,489
MARIA: MEANWHILE, WHERE DOES A

133
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,057
CYNICAL NOW IN TERMS OF LACK OF

134
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:58,625
CIVILITY AND THESE ATTACKS?

135
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,027
SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN FLOODED

136
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:00,727
WITH HATE TWEETS.

137
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:02,196
I WILL READ YOU ONE OF THEM.

138
00:04:02,197 --> 00:04:03,964
I HOPE SOMEONE KILLS YOU.

139
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:14,374
I WILL NOT MOURN YOUR DEATH.

140
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:14,875
ANOTHER ONE SAYS.

141
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,143
I CANNOT EVEN READ THE REST, IT

142
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:17,177
IS ACTUALLY DISGUSTING!

143
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,645
HERE'S CHUCK GRASSLEY THAT

144
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:19,379
JOINED ME LAST WEEK WITH

145
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,047
MORNINGS WITH MARIE ON FOX

146
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,114
BUSINESS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS

147
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:21,615
TAKEN PLACE HERE.

148
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:21,949
LISTEN.

149
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,951
>> I ALSO THINK THAT THAT

150
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:25,319
RESISTANCE THAT HAS BEEN IN

151
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,190
EXISTENCE SINCE NOVEMBER 2016,

152
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,458
IS HEADQUARTERED ON CAPITOL

153
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:31,992
HILL WHEN YOU HAVE

154
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:34,228
CONGRESSWOMEN SAY THAT YOU GET

155
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:35,963
IN THE FACE OF ANYBODY THAT IS

156
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:39,967
IN THE CABINET.

157
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:40,667
WE HAVE SENATORS SAY, GET IN

158
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:41,034
THE FACE.

159
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:42,636
WE OUGHT TO BE SETTING AN

160
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:43,370
EXAMPLE OF CIVILITY AS LEADERS

161
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:51,945
IN PUBLIC SERVICE, THAT THE

162
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:55,949
RESISTANCE IS VERY MUCH, THE

163
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,087
MODUS OPERANDI.

164
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:00,787
MARIA: DOES LOOK LIKE GETTING

165
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:07,427
THINGS DONE EXECUTING AN AGENDA

166
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:08,195
WHEN YOU HAVE THIS DIVISION AND

167
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:08,495
HATE?

168
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:11,431
>> WE BACK TO GOTTEN A LOT DONE

169
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:11,865
THIS CONGRESS.

170
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:12,432
MARIA: YES, YOU HAVE!

171
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,734
>> THE BILLS AT THE RIGHT TIME,

172
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:15,035
THE FAA EXTENSION, THE OPIOID

173
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:15,736
BILL, INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE

174
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:17,804
FUNDING.

175
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:18,538
WE ARE GETTING A LOT DONE BUT

176
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,973
NO ONE IS ABLE TO SEE THAT

177
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:23,510
BECAUSE OF SO MUCH NOISE AND SO

178
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:26,880
MUCH COVERAGE OF THAT NOISE.

179
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:27,948
CLEARLY, I CHAIRED THE

180
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:33,920
INAUGURATION.

181
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:34,621
I WAS THERE AND IN CHARGE OF

182
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:34,988
THAT DAY.

183
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,156
I SAID, WHAT WE ARE REALLY GOOD

184
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:37,157
AT THE COUNTRY WHERE WE SET A

185
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:37,891
STANDARD FOR EVERYONE ELSE IS

186
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:38,625
THE TRANSFER OF POWER.

187
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:41,962
BUT THIS IS AN ELECTION WITH

188
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:42,863
THE SIDE THAT LOST, HAS NOT

189
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:43,964
BEEN WILLING TO ACCEPT THE

190
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:45,932
TRANSFER OF POWER.

191
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,968
TO BE THE RELIABLE QUESTIONER

192
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,469
OF WHAT IS GOING ON, BUT NOT TO

193
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,806
CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONAL

194
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,308
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE.

195
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:57,811
YOU KNOW, JUST TRYING TO GET

196
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:58,578
UNDER SECRETARIES OF THIS AND

197
00:05:58,579 --> 00:05:59,313
THAT OF THE OTHER CONFIRMED FOR

198
00:05:59,314 --> 00:05:59,980
THE SENATE HAS BEEN ALMOST

199
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:05,018
IMPOSSIBLE AND THE SUPREME

200
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:05,752
COURT JUST SHOWS HOW FAR THINK

201
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:08,255
THE OTHER SIDE IS PREPARED TO

202
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:09,690
TAKE THIS.

203
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:10,424
MARIA: AND BY THE WAY, IT SEEMS

204
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:11,958
LIKE THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT HAS

205
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:21,368
BROUGHT THE NEVER TRUMPERS --

206
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,102
EVEN THOSE THAT DID NOT ACCEPT

207
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:22,903
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC

208
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:23,970
INSIDE GOT TOGETHER WITH HIM

209
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:24,905
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT KAVANAUGH

210
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:28,875
WAS CONFIRMED.

211
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:29,810
IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS IMPROVED

212
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:30,177
RELATIONS.

213
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:31,311
IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT?

214
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:32,245
>> I THINK WE SEE WITH THE

215
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,748
PRESIDENT GETS DONE AS OPPOSED

216
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:38,719
TO MAYBE, THE WAY HE DOES IT,

217
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,153
IT IS UNBELIEVABLY STRONG

218
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:45,692
ECONOMY, TRADE BILLS SEEM TO BE

219
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:46,493
COMING TOGETHER.

220
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:47,194
THE ABILITY TO PUT PEOPLE ON

221
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:48,161
THE COURT THAT WILL LOOK AT THE

222
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:50,831
CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW AND

223
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:51,565
SEE WHAT IT SAYS.

224
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:55,969
I THINK THERE IS A SENSE AMONG

225
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,304
REPUBLICANS THAT THIS FIGHT IS

226
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,772
BETTER THAN YOUR PERSONAL

227
00:06:58,773 --> 00:06:59,973
FEELINGS ABOUT ANYBODY IN IT.

228
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:00,374
MARIA: SURE.

229
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,842
>> I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A

230
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:02,776
CONSOLIDATION AND THE PRESIDENT

231
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:05,779
HIMSELF, I THINK IS BEGIN TO

232
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,546
APPRECIATE WAYS HE IS NOT

233
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:09,783
BEFORE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT

234
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:10,517
YOU SUPPORT THE PEOPLE WHO

235
00:07:10,518 --> 00:00:00,000
SUPPORT YOU AND WORK WITH THEM
