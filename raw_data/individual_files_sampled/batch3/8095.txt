NOW. ♪ ♪ Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO TUCKER CARSON TONIGHT. DURING A ROUNDTABLE WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK A QUESTION ABOUT THE GANG MS-13. AS HE HAS BEFORE, THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT BLUNTLY. President Trump: WE ARE TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE COUNTRY, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD THESE PEOPLE ARE. THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE. THEY ARE ANIMALS. Tucker: IF ANYTHING, THAT'S A MILD DESCRIPTION. DOGS ARE ANIMALS AND A LOT OF THEM SLEEP ON THE BED. YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR MS-13. AND HUMAN BEINGS, YOUNG GIRLS. UNLIKE ANIMALS, THEY KILL FOR FUN, OFTEN WITH MACHETES. THEY TERRORIZE THE POOR AND THE VULNERABLE AND HAVE MADE EL SALVADOR THE MOST DANGEROUS COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. THERE IS LITERALLY NO DEFENDING THEM AND YET, THE LEFT IS DEFENDING THEM. THE PRESIDENT'S ATTIC BOAT TRUMP LASHED OUT AT UNDOCUMENTED MEETING CALLING THOSE TRYING TO BREACH THE COUNTRY'S BORDERS, ANIMALS. OVER JEFF BEZOS' VANITY PUBLICATION, THERE WAS THIS. TRUMP EVOKES A DUMB LIKE AN UGLY HISTORY OF DEHUMANIZATION. SO THE PRESIDENT IS A FOR CRITICIZING A VIOLENT STREET GANG. FOR HER PART OVER AT THE HOUSE, NANCY PELOSI RACED TO THE NEAREST MICROPHONE TO DEFEND THE DIGNITY OF MS-13. WATCH THIS. THERE IS A SPARK OF DIVINITY AND EVERY PERSON ON EARTH. WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYS ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE, THESE ARE ANIMALS, YOU HAVE TO WONDER, DOES HE NOT BELIEVE IN THE SPARK OF DIVINITY, THE DIGNITY OF EARTH AND EVERY PERSON? EVERY DAY, YOU THINK YOU HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND ALONG COMES ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF WHY THEIR POLICIES ARE SO INHUMANE. Tucker: THAT'S NOT JUST DISHONEST THOUGH, OBVIOUSLY. IT'S A LUNATIC. WHY WOULD THE LEFT TO BE DEFENDING THE COUNTRY'S MOST VIOLENT STREET GANGS? TRUMP HAS MADE THEM IRRATIONAL AS PART OF IT, BUT THE LEFT ALSO SENSES A THREAT TO ITS BASIC WORLDVIEW. IT'S A LIVING REMINDER THAT THE LEFT'S POSITION ON IMMIGRATION IS A LIE. THEY TELL YOU EVERY DAY THAT THE IMMIGRANT IS A FUTURE BRAIN SURGEON OR TECH FOUNDER, THEREFORE CONTROL IS UNNECESSARY. AND, MOST PEOPLE SEND THEIR PEOPLE HERE, AND THEY ARE NOT THE BEST. SOME OF THEM ARE GREAT, SOME ARE THOUGH AND SOME JOINT MS-13. THE SAME BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T ALL THE SAME. THAT'S THE POINT OF THE IMMIGRATION LAW. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AND WE SHOULD SORT THE GOOD FROM THE BAD. LEFT, I WOULD SUGGEST THIS MIGHT BE A REAL COUNTRY WHOSE ACTUAL CITIZENS HAVE INTERESTS WORTH PROTECTING. YESTERDAY ON TWITTER, THE GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN WENT AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S VIEWS ON IMMIGRATION AND ENDED HIS TWEET THIS WAY: "WE THE CITIZENS OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, ARE NOT IMPRESSED." CITIZENS OF THE ECONOMY COME UP THAT IT ALL. TO THE MODERN LEFT, YOU ARE NOT UN-AMERICAN WITH CULTURE AND HISTORY AND COLLECTIVE IDENTITY. YOU ARE A CITIZEN OF THE ECONOMY, A COG IN THE MACHINE OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM. AMERICA IS JUST ANOTHER PRIVATE EQUITY SCHEMED TO SOME. THEIR PLEDGE IS DIFFERENT THAN
