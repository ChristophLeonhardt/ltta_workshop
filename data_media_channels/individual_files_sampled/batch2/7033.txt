Jameel Hill is an anchor for ESPN she's gotten a little bit of trouble before for tweeting about how Donald Trump believes in white supremacy well there's a good reason for that he said during a all right white nationalist neo-nazi march in Charlottesville even after one of the neo-nazis had murdered someone that there was quote very fine people on both sides so she called him out for that and and has many other comments along similar lines we cover that story earlier and obviously we had her back she's absolutely right and it is provable and we showed you the half a dozen instances of clear incontrovertible racism from Donald Trump so jamia Hill did something similar this time but not about Trump let me read you the tweet and then show you a SPS reaction this is about Jerry Jones now it's obviously the White House has gone to a lot of the owners and said hey remember you guys are billionaire Republicans I don't know the internal conversations but probably had conversations about hey you know the taxpayers subsidize you guys it's called crony capitalism we Republicans love it and we've been practicing with you for a long time plus I've got trillion dollar tax cuts coming would you like some of that or would you like me to you know make sure that the NFL owners are left out I don't know that for sure okay you know what we'll have qit investigates maybe look into it see if we can find some facts for you guys okay but obviously what we can see from the outside is there were pressure put on so Miami Dolphins owner and and the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones came out and said that's it we're gonna make sure that the players will be spent is standing there the national anthem now remember Jerry Jones before the national anthem was played after Trump had originally done his attack on NFL players had gone and knelt with his own players again before the anthem but it was a powerful statement and they locked arms during the anthem so in Trump had criticized them Jerry Jones being the money-hungry coward that he is decided that of course he was going to back down and go for between money in principles money and fighting against racism said joke it's not even close give it a money show me the money okay so that's the direction Jerry chose when and I have much harsher words for him than Jamil held us but Jamil Hill said about that this play always works change happens when advertisers are impacted if you feel strongly about Jerry Jones statement boycott his advertisers whoa now to me I get it it's a logical way to fight back I've had my own opinions on whether they should be done the conservative talk show hosts generally I don't love that approach but that's okay to each his own that's her opinion god bless her heart it's a perfectly logical and rational to have one just like that if you care about this issue and of course ESPN is furious so they explained Jamil Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines what they didn't add but could have is look it's one thing you're gonna go out for the president and that's bad and we got some blowback from Republicans on it advertisers you talking about advertisers no no no now you've touched the face of God we had a great comedian on here Maz Jobrani and he made a great point he's sometimes goes in this comedy in the Middle East and he gets heat for it people say oh but you know you're not allowed to talk about Mohammed or or God or Allah or Islam when you go to the Middle East that's censorship how could you do comedy there despite the censorship and he said look he you said a show on Comedy Central and they would take out all the jokes about advertisers so he said art God is tied art God is the advertisers that you're not a lot of touch under any circumstances so she touches that third rail and he s parents like whoa no way suspended all right more from ESPN she previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet I don't think that their issue was her impulse I think that she thought it through she thought that was the best strategy in that case the fight back against the oppression of the players by the owners which is clear and demonstrated by Jerry Jones nothing about impulse there at all she thought it through and she did it that's not their problem their problem that is the money Lebowski all right finally they also said in the aftermath all employees were reminded of how individual tweets may reflect negatively on ESPN and that such actions would have consequences hence this decision now look ESPN as a company is allowed to set any policies they want and yes there's clearly lines that you can go past and then I would say that the company was within their rights to act that way now look first of all the companies within their rights act any way they like I don't have to agree with it though so all right let me go a little further I we're considering making Jimmy o Hill an offer here at TYT we've got TYT sports there we do unabashed irreverent outsider commentary meaning that we don't have to kiss the ass of the insiders luckily we don't have the NFL rights we chose not to have them it's so we can say any damn thing we like about the NFL or NFL owners or management or the athletes or any of the things that touch sports whether it's NFL NBA or anything else so look this is kind of a funny announcement I don't be overdramatic but so I'm gonna keep it with you guys I know it's funny that we're doing it on air but this is TYT and this is how we roll of course I have to look at more tape of jimmao Hill and we haven't called her yet so ESPN don't panic she hasn't violated her contract or anything she hasn't talked to us but we are very seriously considering making an offer to Jimmy O Hill because that is truth to power that's what we do at TYT so if ESPN and the rest of the mainstream media don't want you speaking truth to power there is a place for you it's called The Young Turks so Jame o hill as usual on this we have your back support independent media come join us the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
