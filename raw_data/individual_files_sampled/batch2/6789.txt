earlier this week there was an explosive piece written in BuzzFeed in regard to our Kelly and how parents have alleged or accused him of holding young women captive as sex slaves now one of the women who is allegedly held captive is jocelyn savage and she released a video claiming that no my parents are overreacting I'm here because I want to be here now whether or not she's telling the truth is up in the air it's something that a lot of people are questioning but I do want to show you two parts of the video so you can judge for yourself here is the first portion of that video that I'm in a happy place with my life and I'm not being brainwashed or anything like that you know it's just pencil point where it definitely has got out of hand so you know I just want everybody to know Mike Harrison and everybody in the world that I'm totally fine I'm happy where I'm at and everything is okay with me so you you are not being held against your will or doing anything that you do not want to do oh no not at all never been filming hostage or anything like that in a nature never so the accusations included that are Kelly would take their cell phones away and give them a different cell phone that they could only use with permission from our Kelly there were also accusations that they had to dress a certain way and you know turn their backs to men in the room so the men don't check them out just you know manipulation and control and the thing that makes these cases are these accusations extremely difficult is these women are of age they're not minors and if they're saying that they're there because they want to be there because there's consent then authorities can't do anything about it but our Kelly has had a pretty dark history involving women including having to stand trial after a video was i was going to say leaked which is not why is it a pun why would it be a pun because in the video he was seen urinating on a fourteen-year-old girl that he was engaging in sex acts with I don't know how he got away with that case but he got away with that case had something to do with like the process by which the video was made available technicality yeah so there's that there's the fact that he married singer Aaliyah when she was like 15 years old right and that marriage was annulled then what then released age ain't nothing but a number that's right that's right and so look again this is a difficult case because if the women say that they're there and it's consensual it's cops can't really do anything about it investigators can't do anything about it but whether or not you believe what she's saying I mean that's that's up to you in your interpretation yeah there's a lot going on here you saw a clip with a video later on in that video they asked so where are you ok we have that video ok so ok good this is that's the part but ok but before that she also says I'm 21 I'll be 22 and five days so I'm mature if you're talking about how you're gonna be a different age in a certain amount of days you're not as mature as you think you are like that's I'm 7 and 3/4 kind of talk oh you know anything to go back to 22 and be as immature as I was back then yeah those were good times but the the part of the video that I think was telling is what you're about to see so take a look at that and by the way for those of you who might wonder who's asking the questions it's someone from TMZ they had access to this interview and were able to ask these questions take a look are you currently in Georgia or where are you IH I'm not it no not I wouldn't want to speak on it are you with other roommates are you in free to go from where you are no I want to speak on that as well ok so yes those are the that's what red flags look like that kind of stuff it's like I would never felt like I was being held hostage ok can you leave the house ahh I can't I can't speak on like it is the fact that she does not answer that like a person and then it doesn't even know in which way she's allowed to not answer that question that is so troubling right what city she's in and part of that might be because in the original reporting from BuzzFeed and later by Rolling Stone and variety they outlined the different possible locations where people might be located including his rentals in Atlanta he also has a trump tower location and they have outlined who's where mm-hmm now regardless of if she thinks that she is an active participant in this and if she is okay but I mean the allegations are that there's like a 35 year old woman who teaches these 19 year olds how to have sex with him mm-hmm it's it's strange now I'm fine like there's a lot there's a lot to unpack but I think you can focus focus on the things that are like that is a giant red flag that leads me to not believe that these are consenting adults the way they assert they are in certain tiny chunks it's red flags like this when she says I can't say where I am and it's frustrating because there's really nothing that can be done if they're making statements saying that they're there because they want to be there like it's weird that ideally I hope they're all consenting me 19 through 20 year olds who are having like the weirdest P sex I hope that it's a weird world where I'm like that's the best-case scenario they're peeing on each other and everybody's happy yeah sure but I just can't believe that and there's other allegations over time like the people who are filmed having sex with our Kelly don't know they're being filmed now that's illegal that's the stuff where I'm like you broke a law you just don't live it's not just that you're living in a sexually eccentric lifestyle like I would be all in support of that I guess theoretically go for it if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch it without ads if you become a member TYT Network comm
