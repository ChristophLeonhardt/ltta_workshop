1
00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:03,843
WHERE HE HAS HIS TRUE POWER AS

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:06,546
WE HEAD INTO THE MID-TERM

3
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:06,946
ELECTIONS.

4
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:07,580
>> Neil: THANKS, CHAD.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,649
SHOE SHOULD DEMOCRATS BE WORRIED

6
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:10,483
ABOUT THIS?

7
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,318
THE PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN AT

8
00:00:12,318 --> 00:00:14,187
LEAST NINE CANDIDATES WHO HE

9
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:15,688
DEEMED WORTH SUPPORTING ELECTED

10
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,257
OR NOMINATED.

11
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:19,292
LET’S GO TO ASHLEY PRATT,

12
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:20,860
DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST RICHARD

13
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,064
GOODSTEIN AND CRTV HOST, ALLIE

14
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,397
STUCKEY.

15
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:25,632
WHAT DO YOU THINK, ALLIE?

16
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:27,834
>> WELL, I THINK THIS IS A VERY

17
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,202
INTERESTING CASE, ESPECIALLY AS

18
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:32,539
THE ONE THAT WE’RE SEEING IN

19
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,106
SOUTH CAROLINA.

20
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:34,207
WE HAVE SOMEONE THAT VOTED WITH

21
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:37,344
TRUMP THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME,

22
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:37,711
76%.

23
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:40,147
BUT LIKE THE MONOLOGUE SAID, HE

24
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:41,448
WAS VERY DEFENSIVE.

25
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:43,283
HIS CRITICISM OF DONALD TRUMP

26
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:44,651
AND MAYBE NOT VOTING WITH TRUMP

27
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,153
AS MUCH AS HE ORIGINALLY

28
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:46,486
THOUGHT.

29
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:48,856
I THINK ARRINGTON CAPITALIZED ON

30
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:50,624
THAT AS WELL AS HIS PAST

31
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:51,925
SCANDALS TO SAY HE DIDN’T JUST

32
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,794
CHEAT ON HIS WIFE, HE CHEATED ON

33
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:54,695
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

34
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:54,629
WHETHER OR NOT YOU LIKE WHAT

35
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:55,363
LARGELY STOCK DEAL.

36
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:56,063
WE’RE ON THAT.

37
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:58,332
I WOULD BE REMISS IF I WAITED A

38
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:00,401
MINUTE MORE DELAYING THAT TO

39
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:00,968
YOU.

40
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:02,770
RICHARD, LET’S GO BACK TO THE

41
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,006
BACKDROP FOR THESE DEALS HERE.

42
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:06,307
THIS ECONOMY AND THINGS PICKING

43
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:07,842
UP SPEED AND THIS NOTION THIS IS

44
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:08,676
A GREAT ENVIRONMENT.

45
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:11,546
NOT BEING MISSED IN POLLS, NOT

46
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:12,680
BEING MISSED IN NUMBERS.

47
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,216
MAYBE NOT BEING MISSED BY

48
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:16,651
AVERAGE AMERICANS THAT MIGHT

49
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:18,019
TAKE FROM DEMOCRATS THAT

50
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:18,853
SO-CALLED BLUE WAVE.

51
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:19,721
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

52
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:21,790
>> NEIL, I HOPE YOU GET YOUR

53
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,026
FAIR SHARE OF THAT $65 BILLION

54
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:26,928
OR WHATEVER THE ANYBODY IS.

55
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:30,198
LOOK, THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN A

56
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:30,932
BIND.

57
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,500
YES, YOU HAVE TO TOW THE TRUMP

58
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,569
LINE OR YOU RUN THE RISK OF

59
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,705
GOING AWAY LIKE MARK SANFORD.

60
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:40,675
ON THE OTHER HAND, ASK RICK

61
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:43,879
SACCONE, ASK ROY MOORE WHO LOST

62
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,680
TO DOUG JONES HOW MUCH DONALD

63
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,517
TRUMP DOES FOR YOU IN A GENERAL

64
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:49,951
ELECTION WHEN THERE’S DEMOCRATS

65
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,989
AND INDEPENDENTS VOTING, NOT

66
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,558
JUST PEOPLE THAT ARE SMITTEN

67
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:57,559
WITH DONALD TRUMP.

68
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:58,160
>> Neil: YOU’RE RIGHT.

69
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,761
THEY’RE MORE THE EXCEPTION THAN

70
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,329
THE RULE.

71
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,665
YOU CAN GO WITH COREY STEWART

72
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:10,739
AND LOU BARLETTA IN WEST

73
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,106
VIRGINIA.

74
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:13,342
THERE’S MANY POSITIONS,

75
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,210
GOVERNOR, SENATE, HOUSE, IT’S

76
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,645
UNMISTAKABLE THAT THE PRESIDENT

77
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:17,680
CARRIES SOME WEIGHT AND

78
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,281
INFLUENCE IN THESE ELECTIONS.

79
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,485
>> IN A PRIMARY, YES.

80
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:27,523
ASK BARBARA COMSTOCK.

81
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,425
SHE WON A PRIMARY AGAINST A

82
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,626
FRINGE RIGHT WING CANDIDATE THAT

83
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,328
SAID SHE WASN’T CONSERVATIVE

84
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:33,596
ENOUGH IN A DISTRICT THAT

85
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,765
HILLARY WON BY 20% IN 2016.

86
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:36,899
AND COREY --

87
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:39,535
>> Neil: NO, I’M NOT HERE TO

88
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,671
ARGUE POLITICS WITH YOU.

89
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:42,472
I DON’T CARE.

90
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:45,708
I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND

91
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,042
TRENDS.

92
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,511
I’VE SEEN AND SAY IT’S BETTER IF

93
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,113
YOU’RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE TO

94
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:52,649
HAVE HIS BLESSING AND HE HAS

95
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:53,149
YOURS, RIGHT?

96
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,817
>> ONLY IN A PRIMARY.

97
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:56,452
>> THAT’S THE POWER OF TWITTER.

98
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:57,720
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

99
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,622
CARETY ARRINGTON YESTERDAY

100
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:01,925
GETTING THE SUPPORT AROUND

101
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:04,227
4:00 P.M. WAS A HUGE BOOST FOR

102
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,963
HER, ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE

103
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:07,731
SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE HE WAS

104
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:09,065
WIDELY POPULAR DURING THE

105
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,468
PRIMARY HE WON THERE IN 2016.

106
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:14,170
SO I THINK AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON

107
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,838
THE STATE.

108
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:16,473
MOVING FORWARD, I DON’T THINK

109
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:17,440
DEMOCRATS WILL SPEND TIME IN

110
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,675
STATES LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA.

111
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,877
THEY’RE GOING TO BE GOING FOR

112
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:23,847
STATES THAT CAN SWING, THAT ARE

113
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:24,981
PURPLE.

114
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:27,150
TRUMP’S SUPPORT MAY NOT BE THAT

115
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,484
HELPFUL.

116
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:28,285
IF YOU’RE ON THE REPUBLICAN

117
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:30,220
TICKET AND YOU WANT HIS SUPPORT,

118
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,055
IT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL THAN

119
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:33,490
GETTING TWEETED AGAINST YOU,

120
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,425
WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THAT WORK

121
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:36,994
AGAINST PEOPLE IN THE PAST

122
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:37,761
WORKING ON THE REPUBLICAN

123
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,062
TICKET.

124
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:40,597
AT THE END OF THE DAY IN CLOSE

125
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,466
RACES WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE

126
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,867
WILLING TO SPEND MONEY, THOSE

127
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,068
REPUBLICANS ARE IN JEOPARDY

128
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,470
SUPPORTED BY THE PRESIDENT.

129
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,440
THIS WILL BE AGAIN, A VERY

130
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,742
ANTI-TRUMP DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM

131
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:53,043
GOING TO THE MID-TERM.

132
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,044
>> Neil: AND I THINK RICHARD

133
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:54,979
WOULD AGREE.

134
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,481
BUT ALLIE, I’LL ASK YOU FIRST.

135
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,883
IT’S THE ECONOMY.

136
00:03:58,883 --> 00:03:59,950
INVARIABLY IT’S THE ECONOMY.

137
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,754
I’M NOT SAYING OTHER EVENTS WHEN

138
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:05,423
IT COMES TO CONTROVERSIAL

139
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:06,457
CHARACTER THAT THEY WEIGH ON

140
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:06,791
PEOPLE.

141
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,193
BUT WITH THE ECONOMY PICKING UP,

142
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:11,095
MARKETS PICKING UP, NOT THAT

143
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:13,831
EVERY ONE PARTICIPATES IN THE

144
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:16,434
BIG MERGERS OR OTHERWISE, THIS

145
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,769
FRENETIC ACTIVITY THAT HAS

146
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,605
CLEARLY PICKED UP IS TO

147
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:21,973
REPUBLICAN’S BENEFIT FOR THE

148
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:23,307
TIME BEING.

149
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:26,043
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

150
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:26,978
>> EXACTLY.

151
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,580
BECAUSE IT BENEFITS THEM

152
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,981
IMMEDIATELY.

153
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,282
THERE’S INSTANT GRATIFICATION.

154
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:32,684
THEY CAN FEEL THE MONEY IN THEIR

155
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:34,085
POCKET OR SEE THE MONEY IN THEIR

156
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:34,852
BANK ACCOUNT.

157
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:37,555
IT AFFECTS THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES.

158
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,957
NORTH KOREA, GREAT.

159
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:41,426
GETTING TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION,

160
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:41,759
GREAT.

161
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,794
IT MIGHT NOT EFFECT SOMEONE’S

162
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,796
LIFE OR PAYCHECK IN THE WAY THAT

163
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:46,731
ECONOMIC ISSUES DO.

164
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:49,601
THEY SEE THE ECONOMY BOOMING AND

165
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,336
HOPEFULLY TARIFFS DON’T REVERSE

166
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:51,636
THAT.

167
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:53,305
BUT FOR NOW, THE ECONOMY IS

168
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:55,674
DOING WELL AND HARD FOR PEOPLE

169
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:56,508
TO VOTE AGAINST THEIR POCKET

170
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:57,409
BOOKS.

171
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,345
THAT’S WHAT WE’RE SEEING WITH

172
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,112
THESE CANDIDATES.

173
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:02,514
>> WHILE IT MAY BE ABOUT THE

174
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:03,415
ECONOMY AND THAT’S WHAT WILL

175
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:05,016
TURN OUT THE VOTE IN NOVEMBER,

176
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,251
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER

177
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:08,186
HERE IS THAT IT IS A MID-TERM

178
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,222
ELECTION WITH A REPUBLICAN

179
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:10,589
MAJORITY.

180
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,257
SO THAT DOES MEAN THAT THIS TIDE

181
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:14,726
WILL POTENTIALLY GO AGAINST

182
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:15,160
REPUBLICANS.

183
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,161
>> Neil: I DON’T DOUBT IT WILL.

184
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:18,363
HERE’S WHERE MY --

185
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:20,299
>> IT COULD HELPFUL OR MAY NOT

186
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:20,565
BE.

187
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:21,667
>> Neil: AND MY PREDICTIONS

188
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,335
COULD BE WRONG.

189
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,870
I HAVE NO DOUBT THE REPUBLICANS

190
