Shannon: A MAJOR UPSET IN NEW DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS NUMBER 4 IN THE HOUSE. JOE CROWLEY LOSING INTO A WIDE MARGIN TONIGHT TO A 28-YEAR-OLD BERNIE SANDERS ORGANIZER OWN DORSED BY THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA. 28-YEAR-OLD COURTEZ MIGHT BE THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. TONIGHT HOW DEMOCRATS HOPING FOR A POST-PELOSI ERA ARE LEFT LEADER LEADE LEADERLESS. THE FORMER ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT CLINTON MARK PEN AND DERRIK MARK, THIS IS A YOUNG WOMAN, THERE IS A TWEET SHOWING HER A YEAR AGO TENDING BAR. FAR-LEFT IDEAS. SHE UPENDED THE NUMBER 4 DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE. NOT EXPECTED TO WIN. HAS SOME STRONG VIEWS AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN THERE A LONG TIME AND SPENT $3 MILLION AND DIDN'T GET HIS VOTE OUT. THERE WERE 26,000 VOTES IN A DISTRICT THAT IS 90% DEMOCRATIC. IN REALITY, VERY FEW PEOPLE VOTED. SHE DID A GREAT JOB ORGANIZING. SHE WON. OTHER CHALLENGES IN THE LEFT IN CHICAGO WERE BEATEN BACK. HERE'S WHERE THE LEFT PICKED ONE DISTRICT. Shannon: HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WILL PLAY OUT IN THE FALL? IF SHE COMES TO CAPITOL HILL IT'S SOMEBODY WHO IS FAR LEFT. ENDORSED BY THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS. SHE'LL BE A BACK BENCHER THAT SHE WILL BE A HIT ON THE CABLE NEWS CIRCUIT AND A MEDIA CELEBRITY BUT NOT AN EFFECTIVE MEMBER OF CONGRESS. TURNING OVER SOMEBODY IN LEADERSHIP WHO COULD GET THINGS KNOW. I AM NOT HEART BROKEN. I THINK IT'S FUNNY THAT FRANKENSTEIN FRANKENSTEI FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER RETURNS. THE LEFT PREACHED TRIBUNAL THE LEFT PREACHED TRIBUNA PROGRESSIVE AND ONLY NEEDED TO SAY AND SUPPORT THE RIGHT THINGS. HE WAS NOT A MODERATE. THE IDEA OF A WHITE MAN REPRESENTING THAT DISTRICT WAS A BRIDGE TOO FAR FOR MANY. THEY LOST. I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. Shannon: MARK, WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT THIS? WE HAVE SEEN THIS PLAYING IN CALIFORNIA WHERE DIANE FEINSTEIN A LONG MAIN STAY WAS NOT ENDORSED BY HER OWN PARTY IN CALIFORNIA. THEY WENT WITH SOMEBODY MUCH FURTHER TO THE LEFT. WELL, MOST OF THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN BEATEN BACK. IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL SEASON, THE DEMOCRATS COME OUT WITH A PRETTY GOOD GROUP. THEY DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY RUN A THEY RUN IT FACED ON FULL EMPLOYMENT AND 4% GROWTH. BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND THIS WEEK WITH THE CRISIS AROSE, OVER WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER, THE CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS FROZE AND THE PRESIDENT HAD TO DO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHAT WAS THE DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION? TO OPEN THE BORDERS AND ANGER THE MOB TO KEEP PREVENT PEOPLE FROM THINKING. HOPE TO GOD WHATEVER VIOLENCE SPRINGS WITH AN ANGRY MOB WAITS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. THEY WANT TO KEEP IN THE MOB I DON'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. THIS IS A DYNAMIC YOUNG PERSON WHO OVERTHREW SOMEONE WHO WAS IN THE DISTRICT A LONG TIME. LOST A BIT OF TOUCH. THIS IS TRAFFIC NEW YORK POLITICS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF CONGRESSWOMAN SHE WILL BE. Shannon: MARK WROTE AN
