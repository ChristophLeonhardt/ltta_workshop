so I want to revisit something I said at the top of the show yesterday and I I admitted that I did think I had thought I used to think that some of trumps president Trump's anti media rhetoric was overblown and and even dangerous potentially but the media's handling of Brett Kavanaugh and that this whole story has been just so completely terrible that it's proven him right in every respect about everything he said about the media has been proven right they really are an enemy of the people to use a phrase that he's gone back to many times and it's a phrase that the media gets very upset when he says that but III think they've I think they've proven it they they they are so fully invested in their left-wing ideology they're so fully invested in you know those convictions that they cannot be ethical or honest or objective even if they even if they tried to be I don't think they could be and they don't try it they're not interested in trying so with the Cavanaugh scandal the media has just completely abandoned any semblance of objectivity or integrity or anything else this is not the first time they've done this they've done this before there are many examples let's just recall one other before we get to this one probably the most egregious example prior to this was Ferguson recall how the media in that case took the very first version of the story that they received and they repeated it and this is a story given to them by by the accomplice by Mike Brown's friend who had just robbed a you know helped in this strong-arm robbery and was obviously trying to cover for himself and that should have been obvious to any into any experienced journalist hearing the story of the friend who was got in trouble with the police for one reason or another you should think well let's this story might not be let's let's let's back up before we repeat this story let's let's back up here for a minute but they didn't do that they the story and they repeated it hands up don't shoot and so on and so forth and they kept repeating it as absolute fact even when it became clear even when it was confirmed that the story was false fabricated made up they still repeated it ad nauseam there were people burning down buildings because of the of the the false narrative that they constructed and they kept repeating it so what's happening now well now they are waging an all-out war an explicit smear campaign against Cavanaugh at the behest of the Democrat Party and for the purposes and no other purpose other than this and that is to keep a an abortion opponent off of the court and so that's what this is all about now what what else can you call them but enemies I mean there's certainly enemies to the truth they're enemies of decency they lie destroy distort they sow discord so what that's what enemies do you know that's what that's what an enemy of the American people that's what an enemy of America would do right that's what they that's what they try to do they they they they bring destruction and chaos which is what the media does and I don't think now listen because sometimes we can go too far in the direction we talk about fake news and we say well it's all fake news and everything they say is wrong and and they're just all the time just inventing stories out of thin air and know that that's that's not correct okay it's it's not you go pick up if you actually ever ever did decide to read the New York Times you're not gonna find cover to cover as it were nothing but total mythology that that's that's not how fake quote/unquote fake news works that's not generally how media bias works most of the time with media bias you know and you read a story you hear story in the news most of the time you can be pretty sure that 85 to 95 percent of what they're saying is basically true maybe even a hundred percent is true but mostly this is how I usually worked with media bias they're very selective in the stories they tell us and in the ways that they present those stories ok that's usually how media bias works but on occasion when they really feel compelled to it when they have a very strong ideological interest and also when they have a strong ratings interest as well and when those things intersect then it's game over but but on on those occasions they will they are willing to go with a completely made-up story not a story that they necessarily made up but a story that was given to them that was that is that it's very very likely fabricated so hands up don't shoot is one example of that where they were willing to go with a fabricated dangerous story and roll with it because of ideological reasons and because it was great for ratings and now they're doing the same thing with Brett Kavanaugh and especially with Julie sweating so that that's Exhibit A Monday night MSNBC aired an interview with with Julie sweat Nick the you know the third Cavanaugh accuser sweat Nick's story is totally ridiculous literally unbelievable in the sense that it cannot be believed she claims that Kavanaugh and his friends were members of an organized rape gang that would systematically drug and brutalize women at parties that those women including sweat Nagar self would continue attending despite knowing that they'd probably be raped okay that's the story that she tells the NBC News admitted they could not find a single person to corroborate her count they could not find a single person to substantiate anything she said they could not find a single other eyewitness there are no police reports there are no nothing from this period of time when you've got these apparently terrorist boys running around raping people left and right they also said that sweat Nix account had changed in the last week what she told NBC News was not completely consistent with what she had said through her lawyer avenatti just only a week ago yet they chose to err and this is talking of how the fake news things will thing works nobody is is claiming least not an irrational person is claiming that NBC News is the originator of sweat Nick's story no sweat Nick who appears to be a bit of a nutcase she she came forward with this story and they said let's go with it now these people at NBC News these are smart people these aren't stupid people they know what they're doing so they're just like you and I the first time they hear the story they're just like you and I they know that okay come on really before you even get into a lack of corroborating evidence lack of witnesses so forth before you two get into that they're gonna have the same reaction any other normal person with a brain would and they're gonna say really but and if this accusation came out against a liberal nominee for the Supreme Court or a liberal politician they would absolutely spike that story and for good reason I think they'd be justified in doing so because it's completely unsubstantiated and it is ridiculous on its face but here they went with it even though it is libelous despicable propaganda they reported it they presented it as hard news and so yeah fake news not only that but but as I mentioned yesterday sweat Nick on NBC was clearly regurgitating blatantly regurgitating stories that she had heard herself in the media the previous week so she you know she used certain key phrases she called Cavanaugh a quote sloppy drunk a quote mean drunk she said they he pushed girls into walls and all this stuff those are those are stories allegations descriptions that the media had been churning out and and reporting quote-unquote over the last week so she was taking those lines and those stories from the media and repeating it back to the media and they were then repeating it as if it was new information meanwhile the the rest of the left-wing media have been digging into these accusations that Cavanaugh threw ice at somebody at a party three decades ago originally now this is changed a little bit I think it was originally that he threw a beer on somebody and now then it was ice and then maybe it was a beer first and I became ice or an ice and I don't know it's it's all confused but he according to these people that are coming out through CNN and the left-wing media Cavanaugh was drunk at some point in his college years and he threw something at somebody okay CNN openly questioned whether Cavanaugh's ice throwing history should be disqualifying that was a question was asked by data by a CNN anchor to to Democratic senator Hirono who just as a side note this senator Hirono who I never was never on my radar prior to all this but apparently she's we're talking about one of the biggest hacks and Liars in all of American politics and and I didn't even really know about her but now she's kind of risen to the surface much like pond scum and anyway she she that's that's a metaphor I'm not saying she's pond scum I'm just saying she's in a way behaved like pond scum let's just say she was asked is this disqualifying and she said well this is why we need an FBI investigation okay this is why we need an FBI investigation is to find out whether there was weather weather ice was thrown then consider M Allison Camerata on CNN she someone came on on CNN a voice of reason came on CNN and said that well to talk about him throwing ice is quote a distraction it's a degradation of the debate Cammarata said this is what she said she said I disagree I think it's part and parcel of the entire thing I think that if you're known as a belligerent mean fighting drunk that's relevant I think that it's relevant to then a woman who says that you would corner her and put your hand over her mouth somehow that that I think makes more sense than if you were just a fun drunk who always fell right asleep okay so I think it is relevant now first of all I don't think a fun drunk as someone who falls asleep that's a lame drunk but put that to the side she is directly saying she's actually saying that a guy throwing ice when he's drunk thirty years ago is an indication that he might be a serial rapist that's what she's saying another side bar for a moment all of this hand wringing over Cavanaugh's alleged aggression as a teenage boy he's supposed fights that he got into or whatever it is also stupid in fact I would be more suspicious of a guy who never got into fights as a teenager than a guy who did because it's the most normal thing in the world most normal thing is for guy a you know men between the ages certainly starting interact well I don't my son is five years old you should see you should see now when it's when his little cousin comes over and they just they just beat the hell out of each other I mean all in good fun but as soon as they see each other they're on top of each other they're wrestling around either doing whatever that's what boys do and that doesn't change like that's how it is my son is in that age now I mean he was in that age essentially or Suzy came a day after he was born he was that he was that age and that's how it remains for like I mean into your well I mean into your 20s that's how it is so that that's normal and it's it it's especially as a teenager all it indicates is that there is a presence of testosterone in this person which again is normal I mean when I was a kid I mean I can think of so many exact I once I punched my friend in the head when I was a kid because he fouled me during a pickup basketball game and then he wouldn't admit that he fouled me and cuz I look I was that guy in pickup basketball every time I went for a shot I would I would say an one because I got fouled all the time all right I mean I was taller than some of the other kids I play with so they thought they had to foul me so but you know and I would always demand right like if I'm fouled and then of course he and finally he did so what I do it punched him in the head all right look and then he punched me back and and I don't know I was 15 years old 30 minutes later we were fine 30 minutes later we were we were hanging out it was fine we were laughing about it I mean this stuff happen all the time it's normal boys are aggressive physical this is what they do so what we would we would almost come to blows over over video games the big one over discussions like whether DC or marvel is the best we were play these we would play these pickup football games and the only reason we played them was it was really just an excuse to let out our aggression you know kid guys two of his teeth knocked out one time there was another time where you know I a guy was tackled and then I jumped on the dog pile after he'd already been tackled which I think is fair and pick up football I mean you of course you jump with the dog pile right yeah he was already down but we don't have reps so he was mad about that the next time I had the ball he came and I was going out of bounds he came and tackled me anyway out of bounds and I fell into a bush and I thought I broke my arm and so we got into a scuffle and then again 30 minutes later we're fine right this is your split boys do I'm not saying of course that any of that makes sexual assault okay I'm just saying that none of that can be considered evidence that a guy is a sexual assault er because it is so completely normal and I would say even healthy I'll put it to you this way a boy is going to get his aggression out one way or another and it's better to get it out by scuffling over pickup basketball games than to get it out through some other means like I don't know like a school shooting for instance I mean boys have this aggression and this sort of violence in them and that's one of the reasons why it's now I'm getting so sidetracked there but it's just important to me it's one of the reasons why we have why it's important to get kids into sports and football and basketball and whatever even soccer if you have to know not soccer but any other sport one of the reasons we do that is is because they have this aggression sort of violence in them and let's channel it through some in some healthy and competitive way and a fun way and that's why it's so intensely unfair to dig up this kind of stuff from a guy's teenage years you have no idea what it's like to have that raging testosterone going on unless you're a guy in which case you do know what it's like so stop acting shocked when you find out that Cavanaugh was a lot like you were at that age and I'm not talking about the sexual assault I'm saying I don't think the sexual assault happened I'm saying all this other stuff is not an indicator of sexual assault for the reasons that I'm describing so leaving the sexual assault with the uh that's uncorroborated substantiate talk about the things that are that are arguably substantiated where there's some kind of witnesses or whatever and all we have there is just he drank and he was and he could be aggressive like that's that's the only thing potentially that there's that there's corroboration for and so what so he's exactly like every other boy and you know what if Cavanaugh went to more parties than you did you might say well look I wasn't gonna you know when I was a fifteen-year-old boy I wasn't going to two parties and stuff like that well you know why it's probably only because you weren't invited to them or your parents wouldn't let you go but you would have gone I mean let's be honest you would have gone but you did do stupid aggressive things don't say you didn't you did and that doesn't make you our rapist and it doesn't make Cavanaugh a rapist and it's just it is so unfair and the people that are doing it they must know how unfair it is I mean maybe it's possible if you've got some maybe with some women if they've never been around guys that much and they have a really oblivious sense of what guys are like and if they're not a mother and they didn't have brothers like maybe there could be some women who are really actually surprised and shocked and scandalized to find out the cab you know Kavanagh made dirty jokes is your book and got into a fight in a bar like maybe there's some women because that's just not how they were but to any guy any guy no guy who's honest could say that they're surprised by that but all of the Cavanaugh coverage has been in this vein the left-wing news channels and newspapers they're acting as hitmen for the Democrat Party they're digging up even the most irrelevant accusations and rumors and they're reporting them as fact all of this stuff is just prejudicial there's there's a reason why okay there's a reason well and I know we're not in a court of law but ideally if we're if we're going for what's ideal what's fair the court of public opinion should adopt some of the principles that you find in a court of law and I'll tell you one of them one of those principles innocent till proven guilty should be one the other one is you cannot allow prejudicial and irrelevant evidence into the discussion so if this was in a court of law if Brett Kavanaugh was being tried on charges of rape which he's not and never will be because there's no evidence that there's no basis for it but if you were there is no way his lawyers are gonna let the lawyer and the judge there's no way the judge if it's a halfway competent judge the judge in that trial would never let this story about ice being thrown into the into the courtroom probably wouldn't let the stuff in the yearbook either because it's not relevant doesn't prove anything and all it does is it just prejudice as the jury up it paints a picture with irrelevant details and it exploits the naivete and the gullibility and the obliviousness of the jury so that if there is anyone on the jury stupid enough to say to themselves like Alison Camerata if Alison Cammarata was on the jury and she would say well he threw ice maybe he's a rapist like the court courtrooms know that there are people that dumb out there in the world and that's why they would never let that into the courtroom the prosecutor would love to put it in but defense attorney judge would never allow it for this reason you know the work the worst thing of all I think is that is that the media believes that they somehow have the right to behave this way and yet to remain free from criticism while they behave this way they chalk it all up to you know they had any attack against them they say is an attack on the First Amendment but they are the ones undermining the First Amendment by using it as a cover so that they can lie and slander they're the ones undermining the First Amendment by abusing it like this and they say that all this anti media sediment is in the country is just the result of President Trump no the anti media sentiment is the result of their own behavior people detest them because they behave detestably it's funny how that works people have contempt for contemptible behavior and the media has been nothing if not contemptible throughout this whole cabin saga thanks for listening everybody Godspeed
