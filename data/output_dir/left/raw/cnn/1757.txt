1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,100
I was not buying that stuff that show
with the owners kneeling with the

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,769
players or the arms locked up I wasn't
buying it because they're forgetting why

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,820
this whole thing has happened if they
want to stop it they want to know if the

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:23,460
players Colin Kaepernick's you have a
job and NFL for them to say we're all

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,340
United
but we're forgetting the reason why I

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,740
was hoping started but do you think it's
a do you think it's a black ball

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,260
situation 100% because of his cuz
because because people do not like what

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,620
he does what he did but now the whole
league I think it's a business I think

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,260
it's a business decision I think I I
believe that you own a business right

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,969
and you had the most qualified employee
right coming in which he is very

11
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,870
qualified shit you know do you get
really quick Matt does not to mess up

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,000
your flow 32 teams in the league oh
there any teams well he could be the

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,280
starting quarterback right now okay all
right yes yes but my point is if you if

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,750
you could hire that person and but at
the same time you had that fear that

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,830
word you may lose a large amount of your
clientele your client base I got it I

16
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,049
got answer for you I can support you
Branch Rickey

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:44,909
nobody else where somebody made the
decision okay Branch Rickey made the

18
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,560
decision after Mel says I've gotta hire
no matter what remember Bell says I'm

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,869
hiring Jackie Robbins okay so here I was
a business it was a business guess what

20
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,869
they made lots of money from it it was
risky at first but here's the thing

21
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,060
here's the thing where do we go in for
always gonna be tricky today where do we

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,020
see the horrors could be in a branch
rickey and get Colin Kaepernick a job I

23
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,119
want to just introduce Kevin that cos
got a job

24
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:16,989
where he is a leader of a movement he
made a decision to put his career on the

25
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:20,709
line
I salute Kalin consume I hate reading

26
00:02:20,709 --> 00:00:00,000
Plato playing football is what he'd do
that place
