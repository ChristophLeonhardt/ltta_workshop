my head is throbbing I haven't felt this dehydrated since my bachelor party because it turns out that salty delicious leftist tears are a diuretic and I believe I overdid it a little bit yesterday the left is very very angry they're tweeting all sorts of profanity at me and other conservatives Trump voters they're hysterical they're even more profane than usual because the new slightly more originalist Supreme Court majority could deal a blow to the fake constitutional right to abortion well to them I say sticks and stones may break my bones but we're gonna overturn roe v wade ha we will analyze the probability of restoring constitutional governance in other news racist Democrats racism finally starts to bite them back and then I call out Matt Walsh's globalism finally the mailbag I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show I I can't I can't I can't do it anymore with the Globes I'm sick of the Globes I can't no more Globes Matt Walsh is responsible for this this isn't matt Walsh's fault look I'm not opposed to stupid stick on my show I actually love it it makes up about 3/4 of my show but I'm sick of the globe's I am NOT a globalist okay the globalism is a false song and we're rid of it now because of this administration and President Trump if you haven't seen the Matt Walsh show is responsible for the just play the clip wit ends for good reason because a globe when you add a globe into the situation it immediately makes everything classier and more professional and more intelligent so even though I don't have a real studio or a real set I do have the globe and the point that I made was well yeah the other guys at the Daily wire they've got a studio they've got a set they don't have a globe though do they so who really has the most professional show with the daily wire that that was that was my argument anyway but after the show a lot of people informed me that actually Clavin does have a globe on his set I never noticed it before but I went back and I and I watched and yeah there is kind of off in the corner it's not displayed prominently like my globe but he does have a globe so this is what I'm gonna do I didn't want to have to do this but I'm going to add a second globe and so now I have the most Globes both in terms of globe quantity and also total global fall yoom and if it's really necessary for me to pull out the big guns and I and I'm kind of hesitant here because I well I don't mean the show off but if I really need to I also have this and I could do the entire show with this globe as well and what would look more professional or more intelligent than that okay but i won't i won't yeah unless it's really necessary so look like usual I'm watching the Matt wall show and I found this argument sort of convincing because I'll turn into the Matt Walsh show whenever I can't just talk to Paul bois I will turn into his doppelganger Matt Walsh and I will hear exactly the same voice and the same you know points of view but with more Globes so I thought this is kind of compelling I mean I've been into a lot of sort of pretentious homes and offices and they do they have globes and everything so but then I there was something about the Globes that I didn't want to be outdone you know I added the glows to my set there's something I didn't like about them I realized what it was do you know what this looks like yeah yeah it looks like a soccer ball that's what it looks like and it reminded me that basically on this globe every single place on here except for oh we're oh except for right there every place on that globe likes soccer except for that nice little spot right there you know that hope of that beacon of freedom and hope for the entire world that protects everybody from chaos and death that one right there doesn't like soccer so I'm done with the Globes the fall song of globalism is over Matt Walsh can keep his Globes I'm done we've got a lot to talk about today we've got so much to talk about this replacement for Justice Kennedy we've got the New York Times attacking the New York Times which is a beautiful thing a lot to celebrate why the Democrats are finally reaping the rewards of the awful racism that they've sown for a long time all of this is coming to a head in this Supreme Court fight we're gonna say who should be on who should be on the list who shouldn't be who should get the nomination who shouldn't a lot of people up for it right now we have Mike Lee the great Senator Mike Lee is up for it some conservatives are applauding that I'm a little I don't know if we should appoint a senator we will discuss all of that before we do that we got to make a little money honey what do you think these Globes are free we got a production budget isn't how completely blown out because of this stupid Matt Walsh gag so we got to think ring ring is a talk about safety talk about the 21st century you know ring is a the video doorbell company you've seen them all of your cool friends probably have it it's that video doorbell you go you click on it and it opens up a communication line between the owner of the house and you so if you're on either you're in the house you're at work you're on a beach in in Boca I don't know where you are and you can see the people who are outside you can talk to them all that video is uploaded to the clouds of some kind of bad guy wants to come up and either break into your house or steal your packages from you know whatever online shopping you've been doing you can see them even if they steal your ring video doorbell it's alright it's already in the cloud you can share it with friends it's what the neighborhood watch used to be now that is totally at passe and how to favor this is the new way to keep you and your home safe so i'll set this up because they sent me clips sometimes of ring in action a crazy-looking guy walks up to a home the first thing you hear is him kicking in the door but then ring kicks in hello hey leave my house I'm calling the police okay what you need to do hey hands my house stop now or I'm calling the police why would you tell me that because you're trying to push my door in leave now I'm calling the police okay that guy's not the police the police usually that guy had about 30% of his teeth I think the police have a higher tooth retention average so anyway it's it's really good I mean I'm joking about it it really is indispensable technology I love mine seriously all of my friends who bought houses use this technology it's so good and it's so inexpensive when you think neighborhood watch use to take up so much time it wasn't that effective so you know time is money this is really really inexpensive thieves just can't hide with ring stop crime before it happens and help make your neighborhood safer with ring right now you can save up to $150 on a ring security kit at ring comm slash and olds k no wles that is a huge discount on extremely reasonably priced technology to begin with go to ring.com slash Knolls k no wles $150 off when you go to ring.com slash anoles I really really like mine and you know I just feel safer with it and and you should to it so it's a wonderful piece of technology okay let's get to it before we get to the court and the real decisions here over who's gonna replace Justice Kennedy I've got to mention this this I almost I had to double down on my hangover because now New York Times editors are admitting that their paper is just pure garbage so Jill Abramson former editor of the New York Times she tweets out she says it kind of pisses me off that the New York Times is still asking who is Ocasio Cortez that was the Socialists who won the the Congress primary in Queens the other night when it should have covered her campaign missing her rise is akin to not seeing Trump's win coming in 2016 which by the way is obviously a dig at the New York Times because the New York Times didn't see Trump's win coming they didn't think it was even possible the Trump would win in 2016 they're lashing out at this and it confirms something that we've been talking about for a long time Jill Abramson is no conservative Republican but far from it but she's noticing the extreme drop in quality at the New York Times I think I said this yesterday the New York Times right now and occupy Democrats Facebook page or basically of the same quality I don't know the difference when it pops up in my newsfeed a New York Times headline or or some radical left meme I don't know which is which the New York Times now is funding this cartoon series of like fat cartoons of Donald Trump looks like ren and stimpy making out with vladimir putin and really graphic visuals in many ways the occupy democrats facebook page has better taste and more class than the New York Times does these days there it is isn't just conservatives pointing this out and this isn't just the normal tug and pull of left and right the left is finally recognizing that they themselves have hollowed out their institutions so what the left does is it comes into institutions and it destroys them we're seeing it at my dear old alma mater Yale is like the prime example at the universities the left goes into universities destroys them it did this to all of the mainstream media outlets and even the New York Times it is recognizing that that happened to itself it is a shadow of what it once was it doesn't do it doesn't serve its function in politics in society than it used to but don't take my word for it take Jill Abramson's word for it so now this will play in a little later with this court fight let's get to the court the left is so angsty right now they're so upset about Kennedy who is gonna replace Kennedy before we get into that I do have to point out a little conspiracy theory of mine it was one of the best memes that was going on around Twitter yesterday so Mitch McConnell is key here right Mitch McConnell is the key a couple nights ago a group of protesters came up to Mitch McConnell and his wife another administration official and they started heckling him and yelling and Mitch McConnell's wife told them stop messing with my husband here's the clip so the next day after a bunch of lefty protesters harass Mitch McConnell and his wife the swing vote on the Supreme Court retires and Trump is going to appoint an originalist that cocaine Mitch baby that you don't mess with cocaine Mitch that's where he got you know Don Blankenship was that guy he was running sort of against Mitch McConnell he was running this campaign against Senate leadership and against Mitch he called him cocaine Mitch and then when that guy lost Mitch put a picture of himself as Pablo Escobar he said thanks for playing this guy man don't mess with Mitch McConnell you know I love this a video of him kind of just sitting there and then then he just slowly looks up and smiles just then that little of McConnell smile and that's called a McConnell in now this is the sort of stuff don't mess with I don't know if he like made a deal with the devil for his powers or something but man guy seems to just control the universe with his finger so Democrats are threatening all sorts of stuff now they're saying we're gonna you know you and this and you and because you remember Mitch McConnell is the reason that we got Neil Gorsuch Mitch McConnell is the reason that Merrick garland Barack Obama's nominee to the court didn't make it onto the Supreme Court he said note we're not gonna sit him and so the Democrats are saying we're gonna do that to you and you're and now you're gonna see this and do it no but you know what you can do Democrats nothing you're totally totally screwed they can't do they have nothing at their disposal right now to stop this nomination and Democrat I am only rubbing their face in it because they have nobody to blame but themselves this was caused by Democrats in 2013 when Harry Reid invoked the nuclear option so the nuclear option was saying you no longer need more than a simple majority to confirm judicial nominees and Mitch McConnell warned about this he actually there he is cocaine Mitch Ward he said you are gonna regret this here's Mitch McConnell once again Senate Democrats are threatening to break the rules of the Senate break the rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate and over what over what over a quart that doesn't even have enough work to do the majority leader promised he promised over and over again that he wouldn't break the rules of the Senate in order to change them if you want to play games set yet another precedent that you will no doubt come to regret say to my friends on the other side of the aisle you'll regret this and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think sitting there like Tony Soprano or something you know like I think you're gonna regret this if it was me I wouldn't do it I wouldn't do it Harry mmm I don't think and so what they did Harry Reid pushes the nuclear option and that made it such that you only need a simple majority to get through judicial nominees except for the Supreme Court this didn't include the Supreme Court but of course at this point after he's gone to the nuclear option it's now up to Merrick garland and Harry Reid no longer has control of the Senate what is Mitch McConnell gonna do Mitch McConnell now the leader of the Senate he is a totally railroads Merrick garland he says we're not going to do it it's an election year and you can't make us do it so now we've got this you know we still have the majority in the Senate and I got to tell you something they're saying it's gonna be really hard to get Trump's nominee through because Susan Collins and other left-wing Republicans are gonna stop it you know liberal Republicans squishes they don't want an originalist judge I don't know about that there are a lot of Democrats who are in states with a lot of Trump voters and Trump is very popular right now and his policies are very very popular right now I'm not so sure that they'll be able to railroad him on a party-line vote what about Joe Manchin joe Manchin in West Virginia is he really reliable to to not support Trump's nominee Joe Manchin needs those Trump voters Claire McCaskill in Missouri John tester Montana they're in a really tough spot so it's true we've got to deal with Susan Collins and our squishes but what about their guys III don't know Trump is very popular right now there's that by the way he's like we're talking about almost record levels of popularity there's a new study out from Harvard Capps and Harris Trump rural rating is it 47% this is up two points from last month so think about what's been happening in the last month in the last month the mainstream media shows pictures of babies crying they're totally made-up pictures by the way but you know babies being ripped from their mother utter fiction and they put it on the cover of the Time magazine with Photoshop and you know there's it's so awful in that terrible and what happens to Trump's popularity it ticks up two points and that by the way that it's not like it went up with the Republicans a lot and down a little bit with the Democrats it went up six points among Republican voters it went up three points among Democrat voters and it went up ten points among Hispanics so you would think this is the moment yeah we're gonna demagogue Democrats are gonna make this all about race and blah blah blah it's gonna kill them with the Hispanic vote uh uh it went up 10 points so what are these guys gonna do these Senate Democrats are they really gonna say no no Trump we're gonna obstruct the whole way okay good enjoy your re-election campaigns guys good keep that up there that that'll probably work in this other this poll also showed 59% of Americans approve Donald Trump's handling of North Korea and 75% approve the Kim meeting three-quarters of Americans approve him meeting with Kim jong-un so okay guys run against Trump obstruct Donald Trump be my guest see how that works out for you the left is furious about this position they're not just the retirement of Kennedy not just that we're gonna get another originalist on the court they're furious because they can't do anything about it here's Chris Matthews well I don't think we're looking at their most the fresher history here of this 5-4 court of course as John mentioned Jon Meacham just mentioned they were the ones who'd throw the election through the election took it out of the hands of the Supreme Court down in Florida gave it to a george w bush and then of course they gave the gun people what they wanted in the Heller decision then they gave them money people that decision they wanted in the United Citizens United then of course just yesterday they gave the anti-immigrant people what if they this this Supreme Court this 5-4 Court has been Pro Republican pro-gun Pro money and against immigration anti-immigrant any anti-immigrant if you will and I think the Democrats as I said a few moments ago have to fight this tooth that now they have to use every process opportunity I had to stop this until next year we have a you senate we don't know where the next year's Senate will be Republican or Democratic dama dama nated but to give this to the Republicans when they control the Senate basically 51 or 52 49 really with John McCain perhaps not voting again to giving this last chance to pack the court 5-4 again hard conservative I again I say this the base will attack the leadership for this if they allow it to happen and they should because this is time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't reap the vengeance now with four and a half weeks four and a half months to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think they'll be under attack vengeance that's that is the left-wing agenda right now because listen to how he talks but first of all it's very hard because he just kind of mumbles and make some immigrant people and the money people and the blood blood with them know that this Court has ruled in favor of the Constitution usually it's ruled in favor of the Constitution it's it's it's ruled in favor of the gun advocates right because the Constitution is a gun advocate the Constitution protects your individual right to keep and bear arms it's ruled in favor of uh you know being able to donate money to political candidates right because the First Amendment allows you to donate money to political candidates because you have free political speech yeah of course duh duh but he look whatever they're as I said yesterday they're kind of coming clean here right they're saying it we oppose the Constitution we oppose they said he says that the the court is anti-immigrant it's not anti-immigrant it's Pro Constitution the constitutional as the legislature to legislate and the the executive to execute to execute those laws so they're but they're being honestly saying we're anti-constitution you're right the left base is anti Constitution anti-american and and he says the base is going to be really angry if the Democrats don't try to shut this down yeah they will but you know who's really unpopular in America right now the Democrat base the left that far left base which is holding the Democrat Party hostage is very unpopular so good do it put them on display put them all over TV that's great can't wait to see in November that'll be that's a great idea other other Democrats are pretty upset about this too a u.s. reprimand Boyle said quote the GOP theft of a Supreme Court seat by blocking Merrick garland is possibly the single most consequential political act of this decade the that it is it is the most consequential political act by the way it's not a theft of course we'll get to that in a second but Mitch McConnell was asked about this he said he said you know what in your career Mitch McConnell has been in government since I think 1628 in your career what's what's the most important thing you've ever done he said holding up the nomination of Merrick garland is the most consequential act of my career and that's absolutely true because it we get we got to give this guy credit for it he made it such that the conservative base was ready and raring to go to elect President Trump to deal you know maybe some people were skeptical of him he didn't have much of a political record but they went because it's it's so so mattered plus it gave us this Court which has given us wonderful pro-constitution pro-american decisions decisions on free speech religious liberty on life I mean really really good stuff poised to be another one you know if the if the conservatives who didn't want to vote for Trump had gotten their way we'd have two justices right now we'd have a 6-3 a left-wing majority on the court what would happen to your gun rights well we know Hillary Clinton told us they'd go away what would happen to your First Amendment rights Hillary Clinton told us they'd go away then left I mean and by the way the left isn't even hiding this anymore op-ed after op-ed politician after politicians think we need to censor speech this is a great win and we got to thank Mitch for that but to call it theft they're saying he's stolen it was unfair he stolen it's theft he where I wonder where Mitch McConnell got that idea from I threatened you I told you I would play this clip take it away Joe Biden it is my view that if a Supreme Court justice resigns tomorrow or within the next several weeks or resigns at the end of the summer President Bush should consider following the practice of a majority of his predecessors and not and not name a nominee until after the November election is completed well that's awkward isn't it the once and future candidate he's going to run again by the way Joe Biden he just is someone asked me I said are you gonna run for president in 2020 he said I really don't want to I really don't want to I've seen how terrible it I don't you don't want to you've been running for presidents since the 80s of course you are you kidding me you that's the job you've held in your life is trying to be President oh I don't want to that's what disingenuous politicians who have run for office who have already run for president multiple times they say I don't want to of course you want to you've just said you want to you want to do for 30 years yeah so but it's a little awkward because that guy is the one who created the premise for Mitch McConnell to hold up that nomination now look obviously this is just politics if you have the ability to stop that nomination if you have the political capital to do it and get your guy in you're going to do that that's just politics now the left is trying to use this they're trying to flip it right and say oh well we've got an election coming up it's a midterm election it's not a presidential election but whatever oh yeah we have a mint so you know Ezra Klein is saying it's hypocritical for Republicans to want this nomination to go through before the election Cory Booker is saying the same thing he's saying come on you've got you've got to do it yeah okay that's a stretch that is a real stretch fellas I'm sorry you know the only way that this works that the Joe Biden's speech or Mitch McConnell the way that they're able to hold up these nominations is if they have the political capital to do it if there's a Senate majority and they can stretch that political capital long enough to get through the election then they're going to do it Democrats don't have that right now they don't have the majority in the house they don't have the majority in the Senate they're not very popular the president is very popular it's not a presidential election it's a midterm election sorry you lose too bad and the other aspect here by the way when you hear people preening about this because I've noticed sometimes the the rank-and-file on the Left are doing this to their their I think they're genuinely outraged because they're ignorant sergej say what McConnell did this and we should they're right so I basically favor David Mayhew the political scientist David Mayhew I side with him here this guy one of the major accomplishments of his career that he demonstrated is something very simple but very profound which is that members of Congress are motivated basically solely by reelect every single decision that a member of Congress makes is made with regard to how it effects his chances at re-election that that you know it basically with a few exceptions I'm actually friends with some people who have served in Congress and there are exceptions that prove the rule but the rule broadly is that the people who go there are sociopaths they're just sociopaths egotist trying to make sure that they stay in power Madison James Madison wrote about this in Federalist 51 very clearly he said ambition must be made to counteract ambition meaning we're going to put all of the crazy sociopaths who want to take over the country we're gonna put them in a room and have them fight each other and therefore their ambition is going to counter one another that's what you see here but it is a total farce I mean it is naked politics and that's fine they can preen all they want that's kind of the purpose of the Senate and the Congress as the Federalist lays out but for people who are like regular people in the world you shouldn't fall for that you shouldn't take that seriously it's naked politics and and the Democrats don't have it right now they can't do it I suppose Joe Biden wanted them to hold it up in 92 maybe they could have had the political capital Devin I don't have it now and we did have it in the 2016 election and thank goodness we did because it preserved American liberty and it just knocked away a lot of nonsense that will give us the opportunity possibly to to maintain Liberty in America at least for a little while so the question on everybody's mind it's the title today the title today is just I took roe v wade and I flipped it upside down I overturned it is are we gonna overturn roe v wade the famous decision decades old now nineteen early 1970s the the decades-old decision that pretended that there's some constitutional right to abortion which obviously there is not there yet you know I sometimes reference I got to meet Scalia twice and he answered like every legal question I've ever had so I referenced this a lot but that you know if you want a law allowing abortion that's fine I mean it's wrong and evil and immoral and you'll probably burn in hell but but I suppose it's as a matter of Republican politics that's fine but you have to go and convince your fellow citizens your neighbors to agree with you and then you can pass a law and then you can have abortion what's really wrong to do the really legally wrong thing to do is to pretend that it's in the Constitution somewhere look in the Constitution and show me the right to abortion look in the Constitution and show me the redefinition of marriage to include but only include same-sex unions in addition to traditional unions to same-sex monogamous unions of two people find me that in the Constitution but not polygamous unions because that's not in there because they're just reading things they're inventing it in the Constitution there is no right to abortion in the Constitution roe v wade is one of the worst decisions if not the worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court and the question is now that we have the squish can it be gone who's sort of conservative a lot of the time but crucially sometimes he's pretty besides with the left will we be able to overturn roe v wade if there's an abortion case that comes up to the court will we be able to overturn it the question is Roberts Roberts clearly has an institutional view of the court he's worried about the institution of the Supreme Court if the people get too angry they could just do away with it someday so he sided with the Liberals on the on Obamacare for instance when it was obviously unconstitutional would he do that on roe v wade I don't know I mean he's a he's a conservative but he does have that institutional view and it might a wrong view of the institutional view could lead him down the path of not wanting to overturn it there is the question of story decisis the the legal idea that precedent matters you know that if something was decided a long time ago or has been reaffirmed that you have to give that some credit even even if perhaps it's on shaky legal grounds are we going to overturn you know you know I mean I guess the question on story decisis we ask this to Scalia to is how do you judge that you know I mean Justice Thomas Clarence Thomas doesn't seem to care very much about story decisis in a way that Scalia did and you know without story decisis you just have chaos you know very important rulings could just be totally upended left and right so you do have to have some view of the tradition of legal precedent but we asked him we said what about roe v wade and he said you know some decisions are so egregious that they have to be overturned even if that upsets story decisis and in some come to mind you know the Dred Scott decision saying that that black people can never be citizens in the United States well you know I actually sort of defend that decision because it not for the effect of it but what it did was it showed the American law to be as it was it showed the absurdity of the question of racial basis for slavery and so it spurred a revision of that what but you know obviously on its face just just awful consequences from that decision how about Plessy be Ferguson that maintains separate but equal but of course those separate things were not equal some cases are so egregious that you have to flip them and more than any you could point to roe v wade which has resulted in the deaths of millions and millions of babies and we kill a million babies a year because of roe v wade now if roe v wade were overturned that doesn't mean the abortions illegal it means that states would decide means that you know the New York and California if you want to keep killing your babies you pass a law that doesn't it doesn't say that there's a constitutional protection against abortion but it just says there's no constitutional right to abortion and now the another consideration of Susan Collins is she gonna make us just get another Kennedy basically another squishy non originalist justice maybe but as I said earlier I'm not certain of that I am certain of this whoever is nominated by Donald Trump for the supreme court needs to go into those hearings and when asked about roe v wade which he will be countless times say roe v wade has defined the law of the land and is the law of the land at his roe v wade is settled and that's all he should say about it because that's all true it is settled was settled forty years ago it is true that it's defined the law of the land all true until we overturn it and and then it won't be settled well it'll be unsettled and then we'll have a new settlement then we'll have a new law of the land but that's all that that person should say obviously we don't want someone to get borked because they've got the pro-lifers or what you know they went to Catholic Mass one time so they're clearly to pro-life or they've read the Constitution right go in there you say roe v wade is the settled law of the land you get a little smirk in there what was that smirks excuse me judge Pryor what was that smirk oh nothing hmm what what smirk what do you think about roe v wade Oh Ravi wait is in the settled law of the land no I saw that again no you didn't see anything that's what we need to do so the question is before we get to the mailbag now who should we get who they're good judges on the short list I'm not gonna pretend that I know everything about all these judges at all but I will talk about the ones who are getting a lot of discussion in the mainstream media Mike Lee terrific senator very conservative one of the best members of the US Senate a terrific politician in America I don't know that he should go to the Supreme Court I don't know that he should I don't know that in this particularly polarized time while conservatives are struggling to explain to Democrats that and if to explain to the left broadly that the Supreme Court is supposed to be nonpartisan that we favor originalist sand textualist s because they respect the letter of the law of the Constitution regardless of our political preferences that we're not nominating conservatives or Republicans were nominating original lists and here is an example of a difference a conservative justice would say that abortion is illegal because we want to protect life an originalist justice would say there's no protection there's no right to an abortion doesn't mean that abortion is necessarily illegal then does it their laws against murder you need a law against abortion that would be a difference between that kind of jurisprudence as we're trying to convince them of this difference as we're trying to maintain the integrity of the court I don't know that it looks good to a point a senator a conservative Republican senator not nothing against Mike Lee Mike Lee would be terrific on the court but we haven't had a senator serve on the Supreme Court since 1971 since Hugo black and that was the last year that we had a senator on the court and Hugo black was terrible member of the Klan Democrat and which is that sums I'm repeating myself a new dealer he voted for some of the worst decisions Wickard V filburn totally expanded federal power as a senator he vehemently opposed anti lynching legislation you know just absolutely terrible so I guess Mike Lee could be our version of that he's like the good version of a senator around the court but I just don't in this very partisan ideological moment I don't know week that we can do it obviously a Howard Taft William Howard Taft was both president and chief justice of the court he was president first and then until 2019 13 and then he was chief justice for the 1920s basically so I don't know I'm a little dubious on putting a senator on the court the the leading contender right now is William Pryor from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals listen Republican presidents have gotten burned before by judicial nominees I we need someone who is well we know about and we know a lot about and we can sort of rely on Pryor is that sort of rock-ribbed originalist I think from everything I know about him I also like that he's Catholic and I'll and it's not just my own Catholic bias coming out here Catholics make great justices Scalia Alito Thomas converted to Catholicism reverted to Catholicism Gorsuch is a cradle Catholic I think now he goes to a Protestant Church an Episcopal Church twice the liturgy half the guilt but still has that kind of Catholic upbringing the recent Catholic other Catholics to the reason the Catholics are good on the court is because it's a real institution that looks at tradition and you know is a horse's logic very very tightly and Catholics are known for this Catholics have been doing this for 2,000 years you know the Thomas Aquinas is a good example here long-standing institutions seriousness you know bringing ancient understandings of logic through into the modern world so they're very good at this and I so I do favor Catholics in that way plus Catholics like to wear weird long robes and stuff and go into a kind of old building so they're good at that another one who's being talked about is I'm wolf thought par he is a little younger than prior Pryor is 56 top AR is under 50 and he's on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals he's really tied with Mitch McConnell who have been extoling the virtues of the last couple days we know a little less about him so I don't know he could be terrific he could be great he's not a Catholic but I won't hold it against him I won't totally hold it against him Michael he's not a Catholic either one hold it against him but but I don't know we know a little less about him so I'm a little worried because we've been burned before we'll just have to see what happens but it would be terrific the Democrats really shot down Pryor last time because they said he was to rock-ribbed a constitutionalist would be really nice to drink up those tears if we got him this time wouldn't that now it would be I'd have to get like two ice packs next time before we get to the mailbag I know we're running out of time a little bit here as we're talking about demographics got to talk about that Democrat tribalism biting them Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is is campaigned on the slogan basically women like me aren't supposed to run for office she was you know the socialist one in Queens and was she talking about a left winger I don't think she was talking about that I think she's talking about her race and her gender and her demographics her you know sort of physical demographics she's 28 years old she's Hispanic and apparently this endowed you with super powers now if you're a Democrat you know just your sort of ethnicity or race your gender we saw this with Sotomayor speaking of the court when Sonia Sotomayor was nominated by Obama she said you know you need a wise Latina woman on the court as though you know that so now that now you know Antonin Scalia says you need someone who understands the Constitution and Sotomayor says you need a wise Latina woman yeah okay but what's great about this we're seeing this in a lot of races around the country not just in Queens at the Catskills this guy Antonio Delgado who's this Harvard and Oxford grad he's a black candidate he beat out six white Democrat candidates recently Maryland Democrats nominated Ben Jealous for governor a hundred fifty one women so far in this cycle have one House Democrat primaries that's twice as many as at this point in 2016 what that's showing us is that they're really digging into this racial and gender intersectionality you know we're gonna now look some some of these people are good candidates the the Harvard Oxford guy is obviously you know credentialed and qualified but it does seem that there's a real uptick in in those considerations and it shows the end of I in some ways the end of the Democrat Party because they're saying we're going to privilege race and gender you know people who aren't white men we're gonna privilege that over other you know other characteristics such as ideology you know it doesn't seem like that race in the Catskills doesn't look like ideology played much of a role in it you know it's it's Jerry Lee doing in to not the thought process but just the the looks the looks of things we're in a time that is passed logic we talked about after World War one this breakdown of logic and sense and art and now we're in this just like grunting tribalism and the Democrats are digging in more than anybody it looks like it's gonna bite them though because that's not a that's not a serious and logical way to make decisions you want to you want to pick a candidate not because of the color of their skin but because of the content of their character and their logic and their their platform on what they're gonna run on so we'll see it I can't imagine it's gonna help them we got to get to the mail bag before I get to that I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube in the last minutes here go over to Daily wire.com ten bucks a month 100 hours for an annual membership you get me at the end reclaim ensure you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mail bag by the way we've got a great daily wire backstage coming up that is gonna be on July 2nd I think we're doing that on the second yes July 2nd 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time we've got the guest Jordin B Peterson there so if you're a subscriber you get to go and you get to ask questions and we can do that but again none of it matters look you're gonna get a hangover so make sure you drink a lot of water during the next couple weeks but you need this vessel otherwise otherwise you're gonna drown go get the leftist ears tumblr daily wire comm we'll be right back with the mailbag we've got about six minutes here at the end so I'm gonna try to get a lot of mailbag questions in first question from Paul why does the Catholic Church insist that only men can be priests it's because the thurible czar very heavy they're very heavy it's hard to pick them up the smells in the bells you need a lot of muscles for that to work there's some other there are some other reasons too but that's what this question actually does come up a lot why why can't women be priests I think you're looking at it backwards first of all priestesses have been common to a lot of religions in antiquity and in the modern era you know before during and after the Incarnation it's not like this was unheard of and only and only we blessed moderns realize that women can do things that isn't what happened but Judaism rejected that and it seems that Christ and establishing the church did not want women to be priests either how do we know that well if he did the Virgin Mary would have been an ideal candidate to be a priest right at the sacrament of the Blessed Sacrament at the Eucharist she could have quite literally said this is my body this is my blood right it comes from from her the Christ comes from her from her womb but women and men have different roles in the church doesn't mean that women are lesser you'll remember who was the who were the first people to spread the gospel of the Resurrection it was women women realized that that Christ was resurrected but are they given a teaching function in the church no we know that from Saint Paul's epistles from first Corinthians from first Timothy they have different function we have nuns we have priests we have you know in and and women teach in Catholic schools it's not like they can't teach ever you know but in the church there is a different role to them of the Apostles the Apostles are men the apostles there are plenty of female disciples of Jesus were very close to him and the closest to Jesus is his mother obviously a woman when when Judas betrayed Christ and in Acts they the Apostles elected a new apostle in which it was just where we get apostolic succession from men and I think there's a reason for that if you ask the question why can't women I think you're looking at it from different ways you know when you're a priest you're serving the church and you're serving the bridegroom of the church Christ it is a service it's something you do it's not about the personal will and showing off and having a flashy title in or something it's about service and so if you're saying well I want that glory you're you're doing it wrong in the 1970s the the Church of England started to ordain women priests it was the beginning of the end of the Church of England I don't know if anybody goes there anymore it's like a husk of a husk now you know and it was there was a big split there was a lot of Anglo Catholicism that came out of that the the reason that women aren't priests in the church is that women aren't priests in the church and if someone is really enraged by this it probably says more about you than about the church and maybe you'll have to think where that rage comes from from Alicia hi Mikey hey Alicia I have enjoyed your comments on the Catholic Church and practices on a spectrum of 1 to 10 a one being guitar group modern and 10 being rig Orion chant what type of church do you prefer Alicia 11 from Brandon Michael you're nearing your prophecy 200th episode what steps have you taken to avoid your homeless dumpster living calamity you're married now where will that poor woman live you have to think about these things it has been weighing on me you know I love reading like Odysseus II and The Iliad sometimes the fates really can conspire against you the more you try to change your fate the the more you lead yourself into it I'm working on it it is true that 200th episode where I'm bearded and living in a dumpster it is coming up I'm some sleeping with one eye open at night I'm doing my baby if you have any thoughts please tweet them at me I've had to avoid that terrible terrible fate Fred we got a few more minutes from Corey dear sweet little ol Michael you said yesterday that the philosophical premise of owning your own body leads to modernism well I said that is part and parcel of modernism that's actually the philosophical premises of modernism or what leads you to think ridiculous things like you have your own body I'll continue with the question even with libertarians how does this lead libertarians to asking for consent to change diapered who owns your body if not yourself God which one there are several different interpretations of God at the Daily wire can I just pick my favorite it seems like a lottery ticket that is usually picked out for you by your parents your cell mate or your favorite conservative commentator COFF Clavin coughs real nice buddy these are genuine questions no sarcasm Cory first question who owns your body if not you God yes God you didn't make your body you're not responsible for creating your body you are not you do not belong to yourself it isn't just a total fiction and a fantasy to believe that you belong to yourself you have a will but your will is as a Tilos and as a purpose there's a purpose for your life and you don't just get to make it out of nothing and pick it out of thin air you can but your life won't turn out very well you you are do not own yourself this is why suicide is a sin you should don't own yourself you didn't create yourself you have no legitimate right to say I own myself and I can do with myself as I please including disregarding the moral order as for which God to choose from how do you choose which god very carefully very carefully that's how you choose which god you say that there are many interpretations of versions of God at the Daily wire I don't think that's true I suppose a Ben would disagree with Drew and I over the nature of the Incarnation and the resurrection sure that the second person of the Trinity maybe the third person too but if we were to describe God the Father I don't know that we would describe him terribly differently would we that's the first person of the Blessed Trinity I don't know if we were to describe the moral order that comes out of God that I don't know that we would describe it terribly differently would we a lot of people who want to justify atheism they they say oh there are so many different versions of God how can we know they're all people have different ideas not really not really I mean there are certainly heresies that people spout but I don't if you look at sort of the the myths the ancient myths and sort of the the ancient conversations that are happening between pagans and between people who believe in God I'm not so sure that there are different gods that come out even in even in the polytheistic pagan elisions I'm not sure that an image of God isn't at least lightly manifested that you can sort of see through the fog I don't really believe that it's why moral systems around the world are so similar you know I I've never heard a really a good argument for atheism I've never heard a serious person give a serious argument for atheism because they don't really exist so you might say well that's not clear I want to in answer I want it to be so clear and obvious which religion I should believe in and which God I should worship all shallows are clear you know or you can you do I don't know multivariable calculus are you really good at that or stochastic analysis or some sort of difficult you know higher in math are you really good at are you perfect at that no probably not you'll probably don't know very much about that beyond algebra if you're like the average American so if you don't know about that what why on earth would you think that you can grasp the nature of God just let just cuz just cuz there's a great story about st. Agustin was trying to explain the Trinity this is a legend that comes from st. Agustin although who knows maybe it happened I mean he was really racking his brain and he was walking along the beach and he saw a little kid pouring water with a seashell into a hole and he said to the kid what are you doing and he said oh I'm I'm gonna pour the whole ocean into this hole he said that's great you can't fit the whole ocean into that hole and then the kid turns to him and he says that's right and you can't fit the mystery of the Trinity into that finite head of yours and then all of a sudden that you know that child is transfigured and disappears I think it's a good you know it's a it's a legend about st. Agustin but it's a it's a good story you can't fit all of that into your head but just because you have finite intelligence just because you can't understand something doesn't mean that that it doesn't exist you know most of the things in the world none of us can't understand we have such a such a finite intelligence do we have time for one more we gotta go we gotta go okay sorry folks with some really good questions to talk about I will see you next week we had some really good guests coming up I don't want to spoil it right yet but we've got a lot to talk about today so we've got a lot to talk about next week with them in the meantime I hope that you guys can cure all of your left is tears hangovers make sure you get the tumbler I'm Michael nose this is the Michael Nolt show I'll see you Monday the Michael Nolt show is produced by seniya Villarreal executive producer Jeremy Borah senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising producer Mathis Glover and our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Jim nickel audio is mixed by Mike Cora Mena hair and makeup is by Jeshua alvera the Michael Noel's show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for word publishing 2018
