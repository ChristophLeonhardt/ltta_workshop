Shami your treadmill ami you one jump
through the window grab another burger
my bag is but I got a slappy going jump
on a Reich and make it smack you in the
head
go on one you won't stand up on that
pole and jump on your nuts
one tip that Cardinals know go to your
head you entered that whole bowl sweeper
on your head you won't do it
you won't stand still and piss yourself
that you want to do it going right there
you're up and scream as loud as you can
in front of all those people well you
won't do it
hey Jackson payback's a bitch
if you want jump over the counter itself
some chips what you want to do it
Jackson you might go behind the bar and
pour yourself a drink
you're a pretender there's a spar you
make a scene
