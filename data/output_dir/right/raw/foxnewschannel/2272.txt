THEY ARE NOT SITTING BACK IDLY.

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,549
AND THEY SET OFF MISSILES FOR

30
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,817

LEAVING THE NUCLEAR DEAL IN

00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:40,040
PLACE IF THE U.S. AND ALLIES CAN

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,078
ADDRESS IRAN'S LONG- TERM

43
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,046
BALLISTIC PROGRAM AND

44
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,081
DESTABILIZING BEHAVIOR.

LEARNED HAS REALLY SHOWN THAT I

49
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,496

50
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,865
>> Reporter:  ON NORTH KOREA.

51
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:06,700
TWEETING THAT HIS PENDING SUMMIT

52
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,269
WITH KIM JONG-UN SHOULD TAKE

53
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:11,472
PLACE IN THE DMZ AT THE SAME

54
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:15,509
LOCATION THAT THE KIM AND THE

55
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,845
SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT MET.

56
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:20,247
>> IT IS AN INTERESTING THOUGHT.

57
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:22,349
SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE LOOK.

58
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,754
AND I THREW IT OUT AS AN IDEA.

59
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:29,657
>> Reporter:  HIS ADVISORS RULED

60
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:31,892
IT OUT ON THE KOREAN PRESIDENT.

61
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:35,663
BUT HE LOVED THE IMAGE OF KIM

62
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:37,498
JONG-UN TO WALK ACROSS THE BOARD

63
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:39,266
TO THE SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT.

64
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,769
AND THINKS IT WOULD BE A MORE

65
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,470
POWERFUL STATEMENT THAN MEETING

66
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,073
IN THE THIRD COUNTRY.

67
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:47,775
>> I LIKE IT BECAUSE YOU ARE

68
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:48,108

69
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:50,311
AND IF THINGS WORK OUT THERE IS

70
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:53,113
A GREAT CELEBRATION TO BE HAD ON

71
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:59,687

00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:03,290
STEPS.

75
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,926
AND THAT IS ON MAY FIFTH.

76
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,228
AND PEYONGCHANG WAS 30 MINUTES

77
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:08,729
EARLIER.

78
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:13,534
A SMALL GESTURE AND ARE ONE

79
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:17,104
SOUTH CORP CORE ATTACHES

80
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:17,571

00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:30,050
>>  SOUTH KOREA WILL DISMANTLE

85
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,288
THE LOUD SPEAKER SYSTEM THAT HAS

86
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:37,825

THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT
