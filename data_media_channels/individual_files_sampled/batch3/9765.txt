DID JUST LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY DID FOR OTHERS. GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. HERE NOW THE AFOREMENTIONED ANDREW McCARTHY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU WROTE AN INTERESTING LENGTHY PIECE THAT GOES INTO THIS TIMELINE. YOU KNOW, FOR ME, BECAUSE THIS STUFF GETS CONFUSING, BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS WHETHER OR NOT THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG CAME FIRST, BECAUSE WAS THERE A CAME FIRST, BECAUSE WAS THERE A REASON TO INVESTIGATE. ONCE YOU HAVE INFORMANTS IN, THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ENTRAPPED. YOU DO HAVE TO WONDER, BECAUSE IT COMES DOWN, IN EVERY CASE WHERE THERE'S AN INFORMANT, WHERE PEOPLE PREDISPOSSESSED TO DO THINGS OR LOW-HANGING FRUIT IN THIS 14 POLICY TEAM, WE'VE RAISED QUESTION, SO WHY DON'T YOU OFFER THEM ON DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. PEOPLE ASK ALL HAVE A INSTITUTIONAL NORM WHERE HE DON'T, IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, OR IN INTELLIGENCE, BOTHER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS UNLESS THERE'S A REALLY GOOD REASON. SO I THINK WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF IT, THERE'S NO LAW THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T SEND AN INFORMANT VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE. SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET DOWN TO IN THE END IS DID THEY HAVE A GOOD REASON TO BE WORRIED. IF THEY DID HAVE A GOOD REASON TO BE WORRIED, WAS AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO SAY I'M NOW GOING TO LOOK AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AS IF THEY'RE IN A CONSPIRACY WITH RUSSIA OR WOULD IT HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE TO SAY THEY MAY HAVE A FEW ROTTEN APPLES IN THERE, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN EITHER INTERVIEW THE ROTTEN APPLES AND SEE HOW ROTTEN THEY REALLY ARE, OR MAYBE WE SHOULD TIP OFF SOMEBODY IN THE CAMPAIGN AND ASK THEM TO BE CAREFUL. THAT'S WHAT I FIND SO INTERESTING, FASCINATING, BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT THE MEETING, PRESIDENT OBAMA, SUSAN RICE, JIM CLAPPER. IT'S POSSIBLE, I THINK YOU WEREN'T 100% SURE WHETHER BRENDAN WAS IN THAT PARTICULAR MEETING WE LOOK AT WHO WAS IN THE OBAMA NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS, THEY PUT THE TIME FRAME HERE, WHICH I FIND PECULIAR, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE EASY TO KNOW, IS WHAT DATE DID A NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL PRINCIPALS MEETING HAPPEN. EVERYBODY ASKED ABOUT IT SAYS, YEAH, LIKE LATE SPRING. THAT GETS MY ANTENNAS UP WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED. IS THAT TIMETABLE SO IMPORTANT? THIS IS MONTHS BEFORE CARTER PAGE GOES TO RUSSIA, RIGHT, WHICH WE HAD BEEN TOLD WAS THE ORIGINAL LODGATION STORY THAT GOT EVERYBODY WHIPPED UP FOR THE INVESTIGATION, RIGHT? NEXT THING WE HEARD WAS PAPADOPOULOS. WELL, THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT PAPADOPOULOS UNTIL JULY/AUGUST, RIGHT? THIS MEETING, WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT CARTER PAGE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL HAPPENS ACCORDING TO THEM IN LATE SPRING. NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE THAT, THEY'D BE TALKING ABOUT CARTER PAGE OF ALL PEOPLE IN A NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING? CARTER PAGE JOINED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ON MARCH 21st. MANAFORT JOINED IT ON MARCH 29th. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE WAS ANYTHING THERE IN THE INTERIM OTHER THAN THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WHICH GETS YOU BACK TO THIS QUESTION. THERE WAS A CONVERSATION, ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT, THAT THEY SAID SHOULD WE HAVE A DEFENSIVE BRIEFING. SHOULD WE CALL THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND SAY, LOOK, LET'S PUT IT ON THE TABLE, HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CARTER PAGE. YOU KNOW, THEY ATTEMPTED TO RECRUIT HIM AT SOME POINT. THEN HE ENDED UP COMING ON TO THEIR SIDE. RUSSIA TRIED TO RECRUIT HIM, AND HE CAME ON TO THE INTELLIGENCE SIDE ON THE U.S. WHY DID THEY NOT DO THAT IF THEY WERE SO WORRIED ABOUT THE INFILTRATION OF RUSSIA AFFECTING THE ELECTION WHY DIDN'T THEY DO THAT? I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD TAKE A STEP OR TWO OR THREE BACK FROM SAYING TWO BAD GUYS HAVE JOIN THE CAMPAIGN, MAYBE THREE IF YOU WANT TO THROW GATES IN, BECAUSE HE HAS RUSSIA BAGGAGE TOO, SO I'M GOING TO ASSUME THEY MUST BE IN A ESPIONAGE CONSPIRACY WITH PUTIN TO STEAL THE ELECTION. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. I THINK IN A NORMAL PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, A NORMAL INVESTIGATOR'S OFFICE, OR A NORMAL PLACE WHERE THEY DO INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS HE WOULD NOT GO FROM YOU WOULD NOT GO FROM A FEW DISTURBING FACTS TO DEFCON ONE. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY. WHAT YOU HAVE TO WONDER, WERE THEY TRULY CONCERNED SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAD GROUNDS TO BE CONCERNED AND DID THEY AT THE SAME TIME PERCEIVE THIS COULD BE POLITICALLY USEFUL?
