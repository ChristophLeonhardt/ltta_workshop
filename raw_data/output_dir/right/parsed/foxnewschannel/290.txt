>> Reporter: WHEN HE UPDATE
YOU ON HURRICANE MICHAEL PRETE
IS ABOUT 40 MILES OFF THE COAST,
STARTING TO FEEL THE EFFECTS
NOW.
IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS
CATEGORY 4.
JUST TO REMIND THE PRESS.
HURRICANE HARVEY, IRMA, AND
MICHAEL ARE BIG STORMS.
IT WILL HAVE THE PANHANDLE COME
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, AND WILL GO
FOR GEORGIA.
IT WILL BE EXPECTED TO RAIN IN
CAROLINA.
COULD BE ADDITIONAL FLOODING.
FEMA IS LEANING FORWARD, AS WE
ARE -- IT'S READY TO GO.
VERY QUICK CONTACT WITH STATE
AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
ALSO THE GOVERNOR AND LOCAL
OFFICIALS.
MOREOVER, EVEN TO --
>> UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A
GULF COAST HURRICANE OF THE
WORST KIND BECAUSE ALL OF THE
ELEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH
HURRICANES COME INTO PLAY.
AS YOU SEE ON THE LEFT, THE
STORM SURGE ESTIMATES ARE
ANYWHERE BETWEEN NINE AND
14 FEET.
STORM SURGE IS GOING TO BE THE
WORST WHERE THE EYE MAKES
LANDFALL JUST TO THE EAST OR
SOUTH OF WHERE THE EYE MAKES
LANDFALL.
IT'S PROJECTED BETWEEN
PANAMA CITY COME UP LOGICAL.
NOT ONLY WILL BEING 14 FEET OF
OCEAN WATER AND COASTAL FLOOD IN
ADDITION, THEY WILL BE WAVE
ACTION ON TOP OF THAT WHICH IS
THE PRIMARY FACTOR OF WHY WE
EVACUATE, SIR.
COUPLED WITH THAT YOU'VE GOT
OVER 145-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS.
STRUCTURES BUILT BEFORE 2001 ARE
NOT DESIGNED TO HANDLE THAT TYPE
OF WIND, TYPICALLY.
IT UNFORTUNATELY WILL PUSH
THROUGH THE STATE.
WE ARE ASKING CITIZENS IN
SOUTHWEST GEORGIA, CENTRAL
GEORGIA, TO BE VIGILANT AND MAKE
SURE WHAT'S ABOUT TO COME.
THIS AREA IS GOING TO SEE A
CAT 1, CAT 2 STORM AS IT MOVES
INLAND.
WITH THE VEGETATION, WHAT WE ARE
ANTICIPATING IS A LOT OF DOWNED
TREES IMPACTING THE POWER GRID.
HERE AGAIN, WE ARE GOING TO SEE
A LOT OF DEVASTATION ALONG THE
COAST.
STRUCTURALLY, AND THEN AS IT
MOVES AND YOU ARE GOING TO SEE
POWER OUTAGES THROUGHOUT THE
STATE.
THEN, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE
GOING TO SEE RAIN FALL INTO
SOUTH CAROLINA AND
NORTH CAROLINA.
CAPE FEAR WAS PROJECTED TO START
RECEIVING FROM HURRICANE
FLORENCE TWO DAYS AGO, AND THIS
WILL EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM AND
ADD TO IT.
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THOSE
WATERS FROM RECEIVING A LITTLE
BIT BY FRIDAY.
>> President Trump: THEY ARE
REPORTING THIS IS ONE OF THE
MOST POWERFUL HURRICANES EVER TO
HIT OUR COUNTRY.
IS THAT ACTUALLY A FACT?
>> IN THIS AREA, IT WOULD BE THE
MOST INTENSE HURRICANE THAT HAS
STRUCK THIS AREA SINCE 1851, IF
I REMEMBER CORRECTLY.
>> IT'S A BIG STORM.
>> INTENSE.
FOR TO MAKE A VERY INTENSE.
>> President Trump: IS THE
WIND GOING TO BE THE PROBLEM?
>> STORM SURGE AND WINS.
THEY ARE GOING TO SAY HIGH IT IN
THEN MACY SUSTAINED CATTERY 1,
CATEGORY TWO TRAIN WINS HIGHER
GUSTS.
WE ARE EXPECTING A LOT OF DAMAGE
INLAND AS WELL.
WE HAVE GOVERNOR SCOTT, DOWN IN
FLORIDA, THEY HAVE BEEN LEANING
FORWARD AS WELL.
RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO IDENTIFIED
SHORTFALLS WHEN IT COMES TO
PREPOSITIONING.
WE HAVE TEAMS, EQUIPMENT, AND
PERSONNEL NOT ONLY WITH AN
EMBEDDED WITH THE STATE OF
FLORIDA STAFF AND SOME OF THE
LOCAL COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGERS,
BUT WE HAVE EQUIPMENT TEAMS
STAGED IN MAXWELL TO ATLANTA, TO
ORLANDO, READY TO MOVE IN, ONCE
THE PUSH THROUGH.
THEN WE CAN GET INTACT.
>> LISTEN, REALLY QUICKLY, 14
STATES, UTILITIES OF 14 STATES
ARE ALREADY READY, READY TO HELP
WITH THE ENERGY.
>> President Trump: ELECTRIC
COMPANIES FROM ALL OF THE
COUNTRY, THEY ARE LINED UP COME
AS SOON AS IT GOES BY.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING.
WE HAVE GOT FOOD SUPPLIES, FOOD
CHAINS WE ARE WORKING WITH ALL
THE STATES.
LET ME ASK YOU -- STARTING A
WEEK AGO, THIS WAS A SMALL STORM
IN AN AREA THEY NEVER THOUGHT,
AND THAT GREW INTO A MONSTER.
SPEAK OF THE FIRST INDICATIONS
FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE
CENTER STARTED COMING IN AROUND
SATURDAY.
THEY PICKED IT UP AND STARTED
RAISING THE FLAG THAT, HEY, THE
SYSTEM IS GOING TO GO FROM A
WAVE TO A DEPRESSION AND COULD
POTENTIALLY RAPIDLY INTENSIFY.
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS TYPICAL
OF THE GULF COAST.
WHEN THEY DO THIS, CITIZENS HAVE
LESS TIME TO PREPARE OR HEED THE
WARNINGS.
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT MANY
CITIZENS CHOSE NOT TO HEED THOSE
WARNINGS, BUT WE ARE PREPARED
WITH SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS TO
TRY AND GO IN AND DO WHAT WE CA
CAN.
>> President Trump: ANY
QUESTIONS?
>> Reporter: ARE YOU CONCERNED
CONCERNED --
>> WE WERE CONCERNED THAT WE DID
NOT LIKE THE LEVEL OF THE
EVACUATION ACTIVITY THAT WE WERE
SEEING.
GOVERNOR SCOTT KUDOS TO HIM.
HEALING FORWARD, USE THE NEW
EMERGENCY ALERT CAPABILITIES
THAT WE HAVE.
SENT OUT TEXTS, TEXT MESSAGING
LAST NIGHT.
LEANED FORWARD AND SAID "HEY,
GET OUT OF THERE."
WE WERE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO
REALLY TAKE THE STORM SERIOUSLY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DID HEED THE
WARNING, BUT THEN THERE ARE
THOSE THAT CHOSE TO STAY BEHIND.
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        F
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        R
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        T
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        R
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        S
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        O
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        D
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        R
UNFORTUNATELY, FIRST TO        S
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO IN AND
RESCUE THOSE WHO DIAL 911 AT
THIS POINT.
>> President Trump: I HAVE,
AND THEY ARE ALL EITHER
CONTACTED OR IN THE PROCESS --
HAD A LONG TALK WITH RICK SCOTT,
A GOVERNOR SCOTT OF FLORIDA.
VERY WELL CORNERED WITH ALL OF
THE STATES.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MUST BE
SAID IS IT'S NOT SO EASY FOR
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE, SOME OF
THE AREAS ARE VERY POOR.
NOT EASY FOR A PERSON WITHOUT
THE NECESSARY MONEY TO LEAVE.
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE
SENT BUSES.
WE HAVE SENT A LOT OF
DIFFERENT -- WE ARE DOING A LOT
OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO TRY AND
REMOVE PEOPLE FROM THE AREA.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY POOR
AND CERTAIN OF THOSE AREAS.
IT IS VERY TOUGH FOR THEM TO
LEAVE.
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU
ARE FINDING, I GUESS.
>> YES, IN SOME CASES -- WHAT WE
ASKED TO DO IS ASK PEOPLE WHO
MAY NOT HAVE THE MEANS ARE THE
MECHANISMS TO GET OUT OF TOWN TO
REGISTER WITH THEIR LOCAL
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES,
AND FLORIDA HAS BEEN PRETTY
ROBUST IN DOING THAT.
SO WE HAVE SOME IDEA HOW TO
PREPLAN FOR THAT.
WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO BE ABLE TO
SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE.
WHEN IT COMES TO GEORGIA, WE ARE
NOT EVACUATING FOR STORM SURGE
IN GEORGIA.
THIS IS GOING TO BE HIGH WIND.
WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET
WITHIN A FACILITY THAT CAN
WITHSTAND THE WINDS, AND TRY TO
SHELTER IN PLACE OR SEEK OUT
PUBLIC SHELTERS THAT MAY BE OPEN
IN SOUTHWEST GEORGIA.
>> President Trump: TAKE A
LOOK AT THAT, THE RED AREA
BASICALLY IS THE AREA THAT IS
GOING TO HIT PRETTY HEAVILY.
THAT IS A LOT OF SURE.
IT'S A LOT OF LAND.
>> THERE WILL BE STORM SURGE ALL
THE WAY DOWN IN TAMPA BAY.
AS YOU KNOW, IT IS VERY
LOW-LYING AND FLOODS VERY
EASILY.
TO GIVE YOU THAT IDEA OF THE
BREADTH OF ITS PAST, IT IS QUITE
LARGE.
>> President Trump: IS ALMOST
THE ENTIRE SIZE OF THE GULF.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT TOPICALLY,
IT'S ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE OF
THE GULF.
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT -- MAYBE
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT AT ALL.
NOBODY HAS SEEN THAT BEFORE.
>> OF THE EYE DIAMETER IS PRETTY
WIDE, WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, IS
NOT GOOD NEWS AS IT MAKES
LANDFALL.
SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY IT'S SIMILAR
TO AN EF THREE TORNADO MAKING
LANDFALL IN AREAS THAT ARE CLOSE
TO THE EYE.
>> Reporter: THE
INFRASTRUCTURE, IS THERE ANY WAY
THEY WOULD STRUGGLE TO DEAL
WITH --
>> NOT NECESSARILY.
IRMA DID NOT HEAVILY IMPACT THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE.
MOST OF THE HITS FROM IRMA WERE
IN THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF
FLORIDA.
THEN IT MOVED UP AND CREATED
SOME ISSUES IN THE JACKSONVILLE
AREA, NORTHEASTERN PORTION.
BUT THIS AREA, IT'S BEEN A LONG
TIME SINCE IT HAS BEEN HIT.
VEGETATION HASN'T BEEN STRESSED.
WE WILL SEE A LOT OF DAMAGE AND
DEVASTATION, UNFORTUNATELY.
WE HAVE TO SET THE CITIZENS'
EXPECTATIONS THAT THE POWER WILL
BE OUT FOR A WHILE.
FEMA'S ROLE IN THAT, AS A E WAS
SAYING, OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH
THOSE DIRECTORS -- WE WORK WITH
THE FLORIDA POWER LINES, THE
GULF POWER, THE SOUTHERN COMPAN
COMPANY, THE GEORGIA POWER TO
HELP FACILITATE THEIR AID TO
COME IN.
THEY'VE GOT POWER CREWS COMING
IN FOR MULTIPLE STATES ACROSS
THE COUNTRY THAT ARE ALREADY
PRESTAGED.
WE WORK WITH THEM TO DO WHAT'S
CALLED THE FIRST PUSH DEBRIS TO
GET THE ROADWAYS OPEN SO WE CAN
GET DOWN THE ROADWAYS TO START
FIXING THE POWER.
THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME.
>> 
>> President Trump: WE DON'T
KNOW.
I WAS GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA, IT
LOOKS LIKE THERE WERE THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE ALREADY LINED UP.
PROBABLY WE WILL DO THAT
TONIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN HERE AS
SOON AS WE CAN.
WE DON'T WANT TO INTERFERE WITH
ANYBODY, BUT WE WANT TO GO AS
