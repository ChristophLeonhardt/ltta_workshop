1
00:00:00,974 --> 00:00:02,375
BARBECUE, WORE RED, WHITE,

2
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:03,543
AND BLUE AND WAS WITH FAMILY

3
00:00:03,544 --> 00:00:04,477
AND FRIENDS.

4
00:00:04,478 --> 00:00:05,311
RELAXING DAY TO CELEBRATE

5
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:06,813
THIS GREAT NATION WE LIVE.

6
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:07,146
IN.

7
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:13,486
>> NOT RESISTING.

8
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:16,556
STEVE: MICHAEL MOORE AND

9
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,324
CHELSEA HANDLER AND BETTE

10
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:18,658
MIDLER.

11
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:21,561
>> USUAL SUSPECTS.

12
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:22,395
STEVE: TALKING ABOUT HOW

13
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:22,929
THIS IS A HORRIBLE

14
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,296
PRESIDENT.

15
00:00:23,297 --> 00:00:24,430
NOVEMBER IS COMING.

16
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,765
ROB REINER TWEETED THIS OUT

17
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:26,999
THE GREATEST GIFT WE CAN

18
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,637
BIRTHDAY IS THE SURVIVAL OF

19
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:33,706
DEMOCRACY VERSUS

20
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:34,607
AUTHORITARIANISM AND RACISM

21
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,509
ARE FIGHTING TO DESTROY IT.

22
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,276
NOW TIME FOR PATRIOTS TO

23
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,413
WE LOVE YOU, AMERICA.

24
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,217
>> THANK YOU, ROB REINER.

25
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:45,485
I WOULD SAY PATRIOTS ARE

26
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:47,353
STANDING UP AND HAVING THEIR

27
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:50,957
SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

28
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:51,891
STEVE: DRIVING THEM CRAZY.

29
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:53,793
>> DRIVING THEM ABSOLUTELY

30
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:54,127
INSANE.

31
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,194
HOLLYWOOD HAS ACTED ALMOST

32
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:57,530
AS A MEGAPHONE FOR THE LEFT.

33
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:58,464
NOT JUST HOLLYWOOD TWEETING.

34
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:00,133
THIS ALSO A TWEET FROM

35
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:01,801
KAMALA HARRIS ABOUT ILLEGAL

36
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:03,136
IMMIGRANTS IN SUPPORT OF

37
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:04,637
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

38
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:08,608
THIS GREAT NATION, OUR

39
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:09,475
TROOPS, THE MANY TROOPS THAT

40
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:10,676
ARE STILL ALIVE THAT FOUGHT

41
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:12,178
IN WARS, THEY WERE UNABLE TO

42
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:12,845
DO IT.

43
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:14,280
THEY DON'T DEFEAT THE NOTION

44
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,214
WHATSOEVER THAT WE ALL FEEL

45
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:17,316
THE LEFT IS UNAMERICAN AND

46
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:18,684
HOLLYWOOD IS JUST A MEGA

47
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:19,886
PHONE FOR THEM.

48
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:20,987
BRIAN: WHAT I THINK I FIND

49
00:01:20,988 --> 00:01:22,488
MOST DISTURBING I LOVE THAT

50
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:23,923
ROB REINER SAYS SOMETHING

51
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:24,657
POSITIVE ABOUT AMERICA

52
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:25,591
BEFORE HE CLOSED OUT.

53
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,160
FOR THE MOST PART ALL YOU

54
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:29,128
GET IS CRITICS AND ANGER.

55
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:31,631
THEY SAY AMERICA IS BASED ON

56
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:31,998
PROTESTS.

57
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:33,299
"U.S.A. TODAY" IN THE "NEW

58
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,800
YORK TIMES," THEY DON'T TELL

59
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,635
YOU ABOUT CELEBRATING BUT

60
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:36,903
HOW TO START YOUR OWN

61
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:37,236
PROTEST.

62
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:42,608
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

63
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,243
IT'S REALLY ABHORRENT

64
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:44,610
BEHAVIOR.

65
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:48,181
FURTHER AWAY FROM DEMOCRATS

66
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:49,315
AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE

67
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:50,917
LEFT AND MORE ON OUR SIDE.

68
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:51,951
THAT'S THE OPTIMISM.

69
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:53,753
THAT'S THE SILVER LINING IN

70
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:54,554
ALL OF THIS.

71
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:55,555
AINSLEY: THERE ARE BLACK

72
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,890
FEMALE LEADERS WHO ARE

73
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:58,758
CRITICIZED NANCY PELOSI AND

74
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,458
CHUCK SCHUMER FOR NOT

75
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,760
PROTECTING WHAT THEY SAY.

76
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:01,360
MAXINE WATERS.

77
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:02,895
THIS IS WHAT THE LETTER FROM

78
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:07,833
DISAPPOINTMENT OVER RECENT

79
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,502
FAILURE TO PROTECT

80
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:10,535
CONGRESSWOMAN WATERS FROM

81
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:11,270
UNWARRANTED ATTACKS FROM THE

82
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:11,904
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND

83
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:12,538
OTHERS IN THE G.O.P.

84
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,240
THAT FAILURE WAS FURTHER

85
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,174
COMPOUNDED BY YOUR DECISION

86
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:17,810
TO UNFAIRLY DERIDE HER AS

87
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,181
>> I ACTUALLY LOVED.

88
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:23,649
THIS BECAUSE THE LEFT

89
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,684
CREATED THE BLACK CARD.

90
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,785
AND NOW THEY HAVE TO SEE

91
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,752
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO

92
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:27,520
SOMETHING LIKE, THIS WHEN

93
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:28,854
YOU SAY THAT A BLACK WOMAN

94
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:30,323
CANNOT BE CRITICIZED

95
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,624
WHATSOEVER DESPITE WHAT SHE

96
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:31,924
DOES.

97
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,259
MAXINE WATERS WAS PATENTLY

98
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,593
WRONG.

99
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:38,464
REMARKS WERE UNCIVIL AND

100
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:39,999
INSPIRING HATRED TOWARD NOT

101
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:42,501
THAT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.

102
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:43,869
SO HE THIS WERE RIGHT TO

103
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,138
CONDEMN HEAR AND SHE WAS

104
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,540
ROUNDLY CONDEMNED ACROSS THE

105
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:47,840
BOARD.

106
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:51,444
SHE HAD SOME PEOPLE PLAY THE

107
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:51,844
BLACK CARD.

108
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:53,179
THEY HAVE TO CONTEND WITH

109
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,247
THAT THIS IS THE ENVIRONMENT

110
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:55,147
THAT THEY CREATED THAT I

111
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:56,315
SPEAK OUT AGAINST SAYING WE

112
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:58,684
SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE CIVIL

113
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:01,487
DESPITE THE COLOR OF YOUR

114
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:02,288
SKIN YOU CAN DO SOMETHING

115
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,322
WRONG IN THIS COUNTRY.

116
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:04,757
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE LEFT

117
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,492
EATING ITS OWN AND NANCY

118
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:07,693
PELOSI, I SAW RESPONDED AND

119
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:09,562
SHE ISSUED A STATEMENT

120
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:12,632
ESSENTIALLY BACKING MAXINE

121
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:18,904
SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE IS BLACK.

122
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:19,905
BRIAN: MOST GETTABLE SECTION

123
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,173
OF THE VOTING BASE IS GOING

124
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:26,812
DIFFERENTLY?

125
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:27,647
ANOTHER RELEVANT GROUP GOING

126
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:28,681
TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD

127
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:30,116
IN THE MID TERMS, WHO ARE

128
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:30,416
THEY?

129
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,117
>> ABSOLUTELY.

130
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,685
I MOST RECENTLY TWEETED THE

131
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:33,886
BLACK VOTE IS GOING TO

132
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:36,856
BECOME THE MOST RELEVANT

133
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:38,557
VOTE IN AMERICA BY 2020.

134
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:40,559
WE ARE SEEING A MAJOR SHIFT.

135
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,127
AINSLEY: WHY IS THAT?

136
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:42,228
>> THE CONVERSATION IS

137
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,595
DIFFERENT.

138
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,430
I THINK DIGITAL MEDIA HAS

139
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:44,930
ALLOWED FOR THIS.

140
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,198
FOR SO LONG WE WERE TRAPPED.

141
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,600
AND WE SAW THE VERSION OF

142
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,834
SOCIETY THAT CNN PROJECTED

143
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:49,235
TOWARDS US.

144
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,773
NOW WE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA.

145
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:54,807
NOW THEY ARE HEARING VOICES

146
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:58,311
WRONG FACTS THAT ARE COMING

147
00:03:58,312 --> 00:03:59,845
OUT OF THEIR TV SCREENS.

148
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:00,813
AND THEY ARE SEEING PEOPLE

149
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:03,582
VERSION.

150
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:07,820
YOUTUBE, ON FACEBOOK, ON

151
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:08,954
TWITTER USING DIFFERENT

152
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:09,855
SOMETHING THATS.

153
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,223
THERE IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR

154
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:12,692
BLACK EXIT FROM THE DEMOCRAT

155
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:13,893
PARTY AND THEY ARE GOING TO

156
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:15,194
HAVE TO ACTUALLY COMPETE FOR

157
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:17,797
THEIR VOTES IN 2020.

158
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:18,964
STEVE: WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS

159
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:19,998
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT

160
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:21,667
HAVE TO LOSE.

161
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:22,768
>> HE WAS CORRECT.

162
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:23,569
WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

163
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,470
TO LOSE AND EVERYTHING TO

164
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:27,239
GAIN AND WE'RE GAINING IT.

165
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,940
AINSLEY: CANDACE, YOU GREW

166
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:31,777
AINSLEY: DID I GROW UP TO

167
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:32,912
THINK THAT REPUBLICANS WERE

168
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:33,245
RACIST.

169
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,714
>> I DID.

170
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:35,414
AINSLEY: WHY DID YOU SWITCH

171
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:35,748
SPEARTS.

172
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:36,449
WHY DID YOU BECOME

173
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:36,849
REPUBLICAN.

174
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,950
>> IT WASN'T A WHY.

175
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:39,485
IT WAS UNDERSTANDING THAT

176
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,686
RACISM AS DONALD TRUMP WAS

177
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:42,788
RUNNING WAS BEING USED AS A

178
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:45,391
THEME TO TRAP TRUMP VOTERS.

179
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:47,226
HE WAS LOVED BY THE HIP HOP

180
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:47,526
WORLD.

181
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:50,296
EVERY SONG I LISTENED TO

182
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:51,697
GROWING UP CELEBRATED DONALD

183
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:52,665
TRUMP AND MAR-A-LAGO.

184
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,333
HE WAS THE GOAL.

185
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:55,601
THE MOMENT HE DECIDED TO RUN

186
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:57,870
FOR THE PRESIDENT MOMENT HE

187
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:03,342
BRIAN: HE WAS THROUGH THE

188
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:04,377
ROOF MINORITY AND HISPANICS.

189
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:06,178
>> WE LOVED HIM.

190
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:06,746
BRIAN: WHAT COULD THE

191
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:07,446
ADMINISTRATION DO BETTER TO

192
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:12,284
VOTES OF THE

193
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:12,952
