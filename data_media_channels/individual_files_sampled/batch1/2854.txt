the United States has been a world leader in aviation I thought this is a record that we should have to Dallas men left Love Field intent on setting a world record in a helicopter the record circling the world in 30 days in August of 1982 who man who's not a good friend of mine dick Smith who's Australian took off be the first man to fly helicopter around the world had a big announcement in the newspaper going to fly around the world and it is very simple I read it and in my mind this is what Americans did yeah we're the ones that go out and set these big records and so when I got back to work there's a message from my dad you know call me so I called my daddy because did you see the paper I said I did because what do you think I said dad we got to go beat him that's how it all began with only 13 days to prepare Ross Perot jr. and J Coburn left Dallas Texas on September 1st they flew a single-engine Bell Ranger to overtake an Australian who had already completed 24 days of flying in his own quest for the world record this is 1982 so the Cold War is still hot and so this is what made the trip difficult and this is why the trip had never been done before politics because you can get landing rights because the Russians refused a refueling stop Ross Perot jr. will try to land his round-the-world helicopter on the heaving deck of a freighter we had to land on a container ship off the Russian Coast and we asked the Russian some lettuce mm they wouldn't let us fly through Russia that was the difficult part and that's the part that almost kept us from getting ready guys hey Josh 30 days after the trip began Ross and Jay had circled the globe flying over 26 countries and 22 seas and oceans in their tiny crack several hundred people gathered to watch the historic event thought it was very exciting the rap chills to me when they landed it really made me glad I'm American I spent 30 days while worrying about them I'm glad you're home so I grabbed their crown a few weeks later they received the FAA gold medal from President Reagan it was an amazing 60 day period flying around the world and seeing the world of 500 feet is a truly unique experience thanks to the efforts of Ross and Jay another aviation first belongs to the United States
