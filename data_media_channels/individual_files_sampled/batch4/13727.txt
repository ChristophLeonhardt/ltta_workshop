I think the real the scourge the disease the infection in the modern church today is moral cowardice this is our great problem moral cowardice we are a Church of cowards and we can think of all the excuses that we want to explain away the problems that we're seeing but when it comes down to it I think if we look around us we can see plain as day that it is cowardice not not only cowardice but that is one of the main problems that we face is our own cowardice now in my piece yesterday I wrote about this and I used by way of contrast the story of John the Baptist a story that I hope is still well-known and and and famous among Christians and non-christians but John the Baptist as as you probably are aware was not afraid to call sin by its name he wasn't afraid to call sin out to call people to repentance that was what he did that was his his his mission so when when Herod invited him to the palace and confided in him and spoke with him John told Herod the truth he just told him a simple truth that's all he told Herod that divorcing his wife and taking his brother's wife was a sin and for speaking the plain truth and nothing but the truth he was thrown in jail and then of course eventually executed and that's how his head ended up on a platter he died because he denounced immorality he called it out and not just any mo in any immorality but but it was sexual immorality and so I think most American Christians they would look at that and they would probably say if they were if they were consulting with John the Baptist or if they were around back then with with the attitude they have now they would say to John the Baptist well it's none of your business what I mean you don't get involved in that it's none of your business don't be so judgmental love is love after all don't you realize John if Herod wants to get rid of his wife and and commits adultery with his brother's wife and so what what do you care leave and let live take it easy John I think that's what the modern Christian would say but that's not the view that John the Baptist took he didn't he didn't see it that way he looked at sin and he saw sin as something disgusting and toxic and lethal he saw it as something that har it harms not only the person who's committing the sin but it also harms everybody else how everybody who comes in contact with it is harmed by it there really is no such thing as a sin that's only that's that's kind of especially a sin that is that other people can see other people can witness those kinds of sin are not just are never just harmful to the person doing them they're harmful to everyone who sees it because of the effect and the scandal and the way that it might normalize the sin in a person's mind or make it seem not quite as bad so from John's perspective any sin had to be called out had to be identified had to be condemned had to be pulled up from the roots and destroyed and so John the Baptist was extremely extremely intolerant he was a man of extreme intolerance and so it's interesting then to note that Jesus Christ said that of all the men of all the mortal men on earth none have been greater than John the Baptist Jesus Christ identified John the Baptist as the greatest man and yet John the Baptist was very intolerant and he was even what what today we would call a doomsday preacher preaching Hellfire right and yet Jesus Christ says this was the greatest man which really seems like I mean it seems like a ringing endorsement of John's whole approach of his it seems like a ringing endorsement of John's intolerant approach that Jesus Christ said this is the greatest man so let's look at our case then while John the Baptist died in his for his defense of sexual morality for his defence of moral truth Christian's today in America and in throughout the West have given up we've given up our defense on both fronts and for really no reason there's we're not we're not facing any kind of real violent persecution but if you look at the polls you'll see that a majority of Christians endorse same-sex marriage divorce fornication and on and on in fact all of our all of all of the most popular sins in our society Christians are fine with them even even abortion has the approval of wide swaths of of American Christians and I'm not look I'm not complaining that because Christians struggle with these things that's not the point something like sexual immorality that's always going to be a struggle people have always struggled with that since the beginning of time but that's that's not our problem our problem is actually the opposite of that our problem is that we aren't struggling we don't struggle we've decide we've simply declared that these things are okay we've stopped struggling there is no struggle we've decided that the most popular sins our favorite sins aren't sins anymore so there's no struggle there's no repentance there's no it's one thing for us to sin and then to say oh my god what have I done forgive me help me that's one thing it's another thing to sin and say it's fine I'm fine doesn't matter it's just you know whatever this is how I want to live my life and I'm in a personal relationship with Jesus and in my relationship Jesus doesn't care about this okay because I've made up my own rules in my personal relationship it's my personal relationship have you noticed that many times when somebody I don't wanna get this is kind of a separate topic but when somebody cites their personal relationship with Jesus they'll often do it in a defensive way because they're kind of lackadaisical approach to religion has been called into question and then what they'll say notice the antic because there's nothing wrong with the concept of a personal relationship with Jesus in fact of course we should all have a personal relationship with Jesus in that our relationship we should we should it should be a an affectionate intimate relationship that we have with with with Jesus and there should be marked by love and by a deep knowledge and understanding right so there should be a personal relationship but if you notice when many times when people use this phrase notice the emphasis a lot of the time what they'll say is well this is my personal relationship with Jesus this is my personal relationship with Jesus the emphasis on my like this is something that I own it's mine it's on my terms I make the rules I set the terms and also notice that you know you go back to the Middle Ages go back to medieval times this idea of a personal relationship with Jesus that phrase didn't exist nobody said that yet Christian's back then had a very intimate almost mystical connection to God you look at gogo read st. Augustine's Confessions read how just intimate that is Christians today can't even conceive of God on those kinds of terms yet that's how that's how st. Agustin was connected with God and not through this idea of a personal relationship that didn't there wasn't any of that and I think and I think that this phrase although it speaks to a certain truth it has led some people astray because it gives them in the impression of this is a relationship that they have ownership over anyway so how do we account for this is it is it ignorant is that all it is but people don't understand if you talk to the average Christian and they say yeah whatever gay marriage divorce abortion let me do what you want it's all fine are they really ignorant are they really not they really have no understanding was or do they really think that the the biblical commands have some kind somehow expired do they really think that yeah I mean a thousand years ago or two thousand years ago this stuff was immoral it's not anymore because times have changed somehow and moral truths have just evolved somehow is that really what Christians think maybe some of them do but I think I think most of them if they're fooled it's because they fooled themselves and so I think in most cases it's simply a case of cowardice and I really have to wonder has there ever been a society plagued with so many Christians who are so unwilling to defend even the most basic teachings of their faith has ever been a Christian society that just cowered so completely under a threat that really is not severe at all I mean what are we what are we actually worried about what's what's that what's the punishment that awaits us if we stand up and declare the truth that we stand up and speak out forcefully for moral truth if we draw the line and say no that's wrong this is wrong this is right okay and here's the line if we do that what's gonna happen to us what are we worried about all the people who are so meek and mild and quiet and refused to say anything what are they worried is going to happen to them a reward that that maybe will will will lose some friendships that were meaningless anyway French if it's a friendship that you're gonna lose if you actually speak your mind then that's not a real friendship who cares about that friendship it's worthless let it go so is that what we're worried about going to lose some friends maybe we're gonna come things gonna be awkward in the family because we got there's some people in the family don't agree with us we don't want to set them who cares so what so what are we worried about worst-case scenario we might say well we will lose our jobs we'll lose our jobs if we were if we were serious Christians and if we speak out then we'll lose our job look okay that's um that's a more severe penalty I suppose but in the grand scheme of things what does that even matter in 50 years most of the people watching this or listening to this right now myself included most of us will probably be dead in 50 or 60 years and what's that kind of matter then you were able to hold on to a job who cares can't bring it with us into the next stage all this some financial security that we were able to attain for ourselves and hold on to by remaining silent in the face of cultural decay what good is that going to be is that is your financial security gonna mean anything when you're standing before Judgment Day there's something else to her to keep in mind here when I when I you know when I highlight the fact that so many Christians are terrified of denouncing sin against the sins against marriage sins sins of sexual immorality and so forth I'm not saying that our primary job as Christians is to oppose gay marriage or whatever that's that's not my point my point is that our culture has selected certain sins and put them up on a pedestal and then literally thrown them a parade and said this is wonderful everybody applauded this is the greatest thing let's celebrate and when our culture is doing that when it's literally throwing parades for sins and demanding that we celebrate and applaud certain sins but I think we as Christians have a choice to make we can we have two options we can either number one go along with it and applaud politely and say oh yes isn't this wonderful yeah so yes yes yes love is love III can't judge you mustn't judge you mustn't charge no no judgment yes yes wonderful so we can do that or the second option is that we can refused to applaud and say no this isn't right there's there are there are things that are morally true and morally untrue this is and I'm going to stand with the moral truth this isn't right I'm not going to applaud it this is sin and I think choosing that latter option which is the correct option it's as much about opposing the particular sin itself as it is about the basic principle the basic principle that were going to be honest and we're going to speak the truth no matter the topic so John the Baptist a vet died essentially because he denounced this the sin of Herod's but it's not like it's not like denouncing Herod's the the the sin of Herod's marriage and divorce and adultery it's not like that was John the Baptist greatest mission on earth it's not like that was the primary thing he was concerned about and it's not as though he wanted to die over that but it was just the truth that's all and so he died for the truth it's not like he wanted to die over that particular issue but he was willing to die over the truth plain and simple and when the truth is attacked I think we have to stand up in defense of truth it's not even really specifically defense of this issue although it is that but even more important it's just a defense in principle of truth and that is worth whatever the the penalty may be for it one other point here I think that um you our refusal to denounce sin to call out sin that's one symptom of our cowardice but I don't think it's the the primary symptom it's not the worst symptom the greatest symptom I think is that Chris is just the general fact that Christianity that faith in America has been kind of pushed out onto the fringes of existence with our permission and many times with our help faith has just been pushed to the side we've allowed our faith to be to be severed almost completely from what we consider to be normal life and we've allowed it to be relegated to these just sort of corners of society we have as I put on my piece yesterday we are a population of Christians yet we have built for ourselves an atheist society and now we use the secularism of society as an excuse to be secular ourselves and so if you want proof of our cowardice I would say that is the number-one proof right there it's not any one particular issue it's not any one particular sin it's just look around you in your everyday life and there is almost no evidence of Christianity in our culture as you go about your life we're all just walking around and living as if there is no God and that is that's many things but it is also cowardice so we can talk all we want about there was you know the the reclaiming faith in America the resurgence of faith in America but there's not going to be any resurgence unless there's a resurgence of courage in the church I don't think we can it's good for us to pray it's good for us to ask for God's assistance but I think if we're expecting a miracle if we're expecting God to come in and kind of like bail us out and to come in by divine miraculous intervention and to save our culture from the from final self-destruction if we're waiting for that if we're hoping for that I think we're hoping in vain I don't think God's gonna do that because even if and I could be wrong I can't speak to what God will do and won't do but I do know historically speaking when when a society gets the point where it's just rejected God and it's careening over the edge usually that's when God says alright have it your way you've you've made your point you don't want me okay and now your whole society is going to be destroyed because you destroyed it now you're going to reap what you sow and I think the reason why God at a certain point has to say that is because even if he did come in by divine intervention and rescue us from the cliff and set us on the right path again even if he did that because most of us are a bunch of cowards we would just lose we would quickly lose whatever whatever was gained by divine intervention anyway so we would have to keep on doing it over and over and over again rescuing us from the cliff as we do you rescues us and then we just run right back to it and over and over and over again so there's almost no point in a miracle until we have courage only courageous Christians can maintain and defend a Christian culture and only courageous Christians deserve to have a Christian culture so we right now have the culture that we deserve and it is a really terrible awful ugly culture if we want to change it we just we got to have some guts we got to stop being wimps to put it more simply you that's our hope is in having just a little bit of courage and a good you know the good thing is considering we're not under violent persecution and nobody is out there threatening to kill us or whatever if we if we stand for our faith the worst possible thing we could lose is our jobs which is I'm not downplaying that but that's nothing compared to losing your life considering that it doesn't we don't really need to have a lot of courage we don't need to have the same amount of courage that you need to have if you if you want to be a Christian in Afghanistan or Syria that requires a lot of courage that requires like this much courage we need to have only like this much this is this is how much courage we all need to have if we all had this much courage I think everything could change so that's all just that much thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
