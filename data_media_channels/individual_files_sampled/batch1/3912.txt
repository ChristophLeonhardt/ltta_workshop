there is one sign I think where it's clear that you should probably leave and that is you start doing bad work because you are so angry about your situation or frustrated and you never want to leave a position where you are fully capable and in the right role and you were really doing great work you should never leave a role where you're suddenly not doing a good job and you've become a bad teammate and the ad employee because you are so frustrated at that point it probably is best to just move on without a job so that they actually have a good memory of you and it's not negative
