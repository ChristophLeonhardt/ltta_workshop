“If it remains a hashtag
and it remains a movement,
then it’s going to die.
It’s got to become
a part of our lives —
that women should
no longer be in silence
about sexual assault.
It’s a crime.”
“This is a really unusual
moment in our history.”
“There’s sort of a magic
in the air,
that’s pushing systemic change.”
“I think that the Academy
can bring a little
pressure to bear
on agencies and studios.
You know, I don’t know
who else really can.”
“Tonight will be a continued
message, a voice.”
“Hollywood sets a standard
and it helps raise the bar.
And it has trickled out
into other fields.
But I think the focus
has to shift at this point.”
“I’ve been a feminist for years,
and we fought for many rights.
But slowly it moves.”
“As long as we continue to
support each other as women,
Time’s Up will never go away.
And as long as the
consequences remain,
you know, people will stop
doing what they’re doing.”
“As I become more
and more of a producer,
it’s very important
for me to continue
to make sure that
we hire not only
women in front of the
camera and as directors
but women as
cinematographers
and all the other
positions as well.
And I think we just have to do that
until we don’t have to do
it anymore. Until it’s equal.”
“You know, generally we need
to broaden the conversation.
So white, straight men
are asked to comment
on this on the red carpet.
You know, sometimes
it works out where
men talk about the craft,
women talk about the issues.
And I think men should be forced
to interrogate their identity.
I’m constantly interrogating
what it means to be a woman.
I’m constantly asked to figure out
what it means to be black.
I’m constantly asked to interrogate
what it means to be a lesbian.”
“If you study ancient civilizations
that have lasted a long time —
it’s because they put
women up in the society.
We held women up.
And I think that is something
that we can learn from.
And I think it’s a beautiful
thing, you know?
I love my mama.”
“It makes me very excited
for the new generations.
And I hope they don’t forget,
so they can appreciate the opportunities,
and they work harder than ever
so that we can be proven right.
That the female force,
it’s an untapped potential
that can really make
a difference everywhere.”
“There’s probably a lot of things
wrong about Hollywood,
but I stay away from that part.
And I don’t allow myself
to be in places I shouldn’t.
That’s how you fix it.
Know your surroundings.
And if you don’t know,
wear a chastity belt.”
“Legislation needs
to be passed;
people need to be
held accountable
for what they’ve done.”
“I can’t think of what the
legislative way would be.
But I always think of
same-sex marriage
as, like, that was a really —
they changed the law.
And I don’t know
what came first,
but the thinking
and the law changed,
and the world really
changed around that.
I hope #MeToo has
the same effect.”
“If we can continue
to find purpose —
and me at my
particular age —
purpose in
what we do.
That purpose, we carry that
translated into another way,
in which we deal
with ordinary citizens
and young actors
and young producers
and young directors
and young actresses
who are coming up.”
“Thank you so much.”
“Have a great night.”
