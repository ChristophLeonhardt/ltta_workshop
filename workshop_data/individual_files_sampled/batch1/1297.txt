my name is Katie Erina I'm a journalist at the intercept in these times and I'm in the stream I am from UK and you're in the stream today will the killing of a black female politician spur change in Brazil will discuss the impact of Rio de Janeiro Councilwoman Mary le Franco and the issues she championed she was elected in 2016 and became the only black woman in Rio de Janeiro city council Ariely Franco a 38 year old human rights activist was a vocal feminist and lesbian and a black Brazilian are born in a favela she was seen as a rising political voice for marginalized communities and people affected by poverty and violence last Wednesday shortly after leaving an event on black women's empowerment Franco and her driver Anderson Gomez were shot to death in what officials believe to be a targeted killing Franco was shot four times in the head since her death tens of thousands in Brazil have protested with the intent of keeping the social issues Franco cared about in the public eye so today we want to discuss the impact this story is having joining us from Rio de Janeiro is Cecilia Oliveira a contributing editor with the intercept Brazil in s√£o Paulo activist jameelah Ribeiro and in Austin Texas Kristen Smith associate professor of African and African Diaspora studies and anthropology at the University of Texas Austin welcome to the stream all of you I want to start online with the way that this incident has reverberated across the world Mariela Mariela Franco's name was mentioned nearly a million times online you can see it on my screen here and that since her death on March 14th 60% of that traffic came from Brazil the rest mainly came from the u.s. France Argentina and the UK really showing how global this conversation has gotten I want to share a tweet with some with you from someone who explains that this is stuff she says Mary Ellie and Anderson's deaths are so impactful because they were so brazen and cool intentionally squandering black favela LGBTQ excellence and hope with bullets she goes on to say that this killing of a black LGBTQ woman who did everything quote/unquote right to amplify marginal voices is perverse and that's why her name now uses the hashtag is resonating in Brazil and elsewhere jameelah when you see the impact that Mary Ellie's work has had and people telling these stories and sharing her work across the world what what do you think of that and and why do you think that that is yes Maria she was a very activist for us especially for black women black feminists in Brazil I I knew Maria Lee we have been together several times or for me it was very shocking and desperate to to know about her death but also Maria at least she had important to work on for Verizon received she was like a wage people from favela to to to to speak about the police violence and about the military intervention so I think people who shoot Maria Ali didn't imagine how she was important and impact of her death in a moment that black women in Brazil you can say that are leading the social movement so we are several women around Brazil speaking about these and and Padilla was an inspiration for a lot of these women but also I think how Mariela was important to people from favela huge Janeiro how Mariela was courageous to speak about all this kind of violence and and it's important to say that in Brazil you have these ideas you have this idea that it's not such a racist country that Brazil is not so violent the racial democracy myth created this idea that in Brazil it's not a racial problem or it is only a social problem but marianas example that it's a racial social and problem in Brazil in a country dating in each 23 minutes a young man is killed by the police so Mariela was doing this kind of genomic disk i/o violence so that's why I think people are so reservists reats every day we are having Riyadh's in brazil mobilizations every day because maria is piqued for us for invisible people for the people that are killing and some other video here i want to bring in some video from France Spain Germany these are all people are mourning the death of basically a local councillor in Rio Kristin when you see these pictures when you heard about what happened on March the 14th your initial reaction was what my my initial reaction was that I was devastated because I knew that she was much more than just a local council woman she represented in many ways the face of the kind of new black global global movement against police violence she represented the face of black feminism global black feminism she represented the face of young a young black woman's generation that's taking the lead in the fight against patriarchy and white supremacy and in all forms of oppression imperialism etc and so that's exactly why people around the world have really clambered in order to mourn her death because she was so much more than just a local council woman she she really was she was somebody who many of us could could relate to in the sense that she represents the face of young black activism right now and so for example the first thing I thought about giving my work around police violence was that this was this was really a message to all of us that organized against anti black police violence and I thought about the founders of black lives matter here in the United States all black queer women and so Mary Ellie was a black queer woman and so this is something that I think is so much bigger than a local issue in Rio and it's very much transnational in every way and so my first reaction was was really one of shock and dismay and mourning but also the recognition that this was this is about something much more than Brazil this is about something that really ties in to all of us I think Diego here on Twitter would agree he says this is a turning point specifically in Rio he says Madiha T's killing was brutal and she was such a light but he goes on to say Cecilia that there were massive protests more than a hundred thousand in Rio on Tuesday this is a new movement and this could be bigger than some of the protests we saw in June 2013 which were anti-government protests Cecilia I know that you knew Metis Eddie for about nine years and you were at one of those vigils marking her death on Tuesday what was that atmosphere like what was what was that like for you I think that the the first protest against this as a cushion was like a big grief everybody was really sad and crying because we felt like it's about us we we can be the next one and was terrible but when you see the the last protest like yesterday you can feel that we are stronger now we are here to be the next the next Mary Ally on the power so we have when Maria Lee was elected in 2016 we elect also in Belo Horizonte in the state close to Rio we have audio Karolina and we had another Mariela meteoroid hearing he'll he/she is pal Ilya so it's the time to be new Mary Alice on the power we lost Murray early but we are raising more Mary Alice the these people then who killed Mary Ali maybe they think that oh it's just Mary Ali and now it's gone and don't it's not this way we have more Mary Alice coming and this is election year in Brazil and we these people has to be prepared to see more money else in the power because we are stronger now can I just want to say something in response to that I think that that's that's just absolutely right I think that this was clearly a message that was being sent to all of us that working around to organize around these issues that all of us that are organizing for black women to all of us that are organizing against kind of oppression oppressive regimes of power and contrary to what her executioner's want this is not going to silence everyone this is just going to create more money Elly's and I love that I think that's really beautiful because what they want is to not have any more money at least but that's exactly the opposite of what they're gonna get I wonder but I think it's important to say yes we are creating more audience and it's wonderful but not only Maria is on the institutional politics you know Maria is in several places and I'm in several you know in doing important works not only police constitutional because it with you you know of course we need more black women and the parties being elected but it's important to say that for us is not easy in Brazil to you know to run and to be supported by the party so LC Silla said we have outer Carolina in Belo Horizonte but very important to say that our ecology area Catalina was elected because black women and her state organized it to poach outer karolina there despite of the lack of support of the parties in Brazil jameelah I'm so glad that you mentioned how difficult it is to become what she became a council woman this is a tweet we got from black women of Brazil that's the handle and they say first look at the overwhelming odds of her even becoming a Councilwoman in 2016 she was one of only five black women elected to a City Council out of four hundred and sixty thousand candidates we also got a comment from someone via video and she talks about that feat have a listen to Manuela Madi a nice murder matter so much not only because it's an attack on Brazil's democracy but also because it jeopardizes the movement for political renovation Brazil has been facing the biggest corruption scandal perhaps in the world for the last four years it has implicated over a hundred politicians and so if Brazil really needs this political renovation and she meant a really good movement because she represented black people and women were very poorly represented in Congress and in in in the federal and state governments in Brazil so it's a it's gonna be a struggle to find another person who is so representative of Brazilian people and who can meet this renovation that is so needed so Kristin she talks about how important this was to for representation purposes out of her causes what do you think this means for black women in situations like she was in to have seen the work that she did I mean I think that it's absolutely crucial because it's the kind of representation that really inspires other people to know that they can be more than what society tells them that they could be I mean that she was she was a teenager mother and she was someone who was from a favela and she was someone who was able to go to university was able to study was able to do things that black women have traditionally not been able to do in Brazil especially black women from her background and I think that that's absolutely critical and it's critical not just from a perspective of Brazil like again I want to say it's critical transnationally I mean this in so many ways she represents so many of us I was talking about her to my class which is on black women and here at UT the other day and I was talking about her being a teenage mother and I was talking about her growing up in a favela in a working-class community and I was talking about her going to university and getting her degree in sociology and then going on to run for office and all of those things and my students who are from Texas and many of whom have never left Texas could identify with that my black female students could identify with that and so what does that tell me what is that tells me that this is something that that is inspiring to black women everywhere and it's something that people are going to be able to look at her and look at her memory and say this is something that I can do and I'm not gonna let people who try to shut us up stop me from being what I want to be and I and I think that's really important and I but I also you know I really want to echo what Jamila said I don't want us to romanticize it though I don't want us to feel like everybody needs to be in the political parties and running for office that's not really what this is about I think this is really about what does it mean to speak truth to power what does it mean to stand up and say no you will not shut me up you will not silence me you will not you will not get rid of my voice I can speak up and I can be counted that's really what she represents more than just being a politician I mean I think it happened to be that politics was her way of doing her things but she could have easily chosen something else and still been as important and as consequential ladies I want to play this for you and for our audience this is Mary Ellie's Facebook page can you believe that on the day that she was murdered she did a facebook lives she streamed it and it was about the black empowerment of Brazilian women have a listen to it's in Portuguese but I want you to see it's the last time that we'll see her video possibly bizarre Salters exactly and central Andes minionese libraries you might be pointers ish the authorities you see now vibrant face on all of the protesters and the rallies her faces there Molly Ellie's face this powerful black resilient woman when she's looking at the empowerment of black Brazilian women Jamila what is her legacy in that field because there are so many issues that she covered and she care for and she fought for but for black Brazilian women what's her legacy yeah I think Marie Ellie's she was very important for us because she was very aware of the importance of intersectionality so Maria ich was a lesbian woman she was like woman poor woman and she was also trying to create space for trans people somebody else she's okay and we have spoke for us for a lot of us that in Brazil was chewing his bowl so I think it's very her legacy it's especially for young young black women in Brazil it's not to be threatening you know Mary Alice was very brave and it was a very and at the same time she was a very kind person and I think her legacy is the way that you can't be in silence anymore especially in the country that black women are still struggling and to be treated as human being so her legacies you know for all of us it's it's something that cannot be raised it although compared to the people here in Brazil are trying to create fake nails about her a lot of things they are saying about her that are not true but spite of all these things we're on it's national TV right now what's not true what's the fake news what are you talking about oh they are saying that Maria Ali was you know a drug dealer or something like that or she was married dealer that trust killed because she was involved with the way of the crime organized crime in Brazil you know he is part of you know even if she was everything how do you think that they are saying it's not a it cannot just fight her death but it's not true so they are trying to create a lot of fake news about her because they are very Alda mobilizations all the media coverage are certain away this conservative people are not enjoying all this the world is talking about morality so but despite of all these things that people are doing her legacy is done and you know she will be alive in our memories in our way to fight against racism and sexist in Brazil and you know part of her legacy people online are telling us is the fight against corruption and specifically police corruption this is windy Muse and Twitter who says in the case of Mary le many have rightfully argued that her murder was to send a message to poor people of color like herself and though she represented that they shouldn't speak up another person writes in on Twitter Sierra says it's been very somber and Brazil now there's still a lot of speculation as to whom the message was for and what it was supposed to say speaking of the killing but Mary Ali's death has also put the spotlight back on police brutality in particular against afro-brazilians and favela residents Cecilia this is one of the things that a lot of people are talking about the the fight against the militarization of Rio the fight against corruption in the police force where do you think that fight stands right now that's a important point because Marie Ellie has been working on this behind the lights for the last ten years because she used to work we are huge depth to here he is marcelo fresh and he's leading a commission that used to investigate the the huge militias here so marie le used to work with this and it's important to point that militia it's a big it's a huge thing in real it's impressive because militia here they elect people they have big big big commercials here so this is a huge thing here and it's important to point that we have this light in this point about militia but we had to to point that marie le also used to fight because this war this war on drugs of course it's make Vuitton's about police cops also and the drug dealers and the poor cops they was born in the same neighborhood they have the same they are the same kind of people they are for people living poor areas so the war on drugs in rio heel the st. people show in the in the in the same lines alright and so you see let me just share this with our audience this is mary le again from her twitter account and she tweets the day before she was shot dead another homicide of a young man who may be coming into the p.m. account matheus melo was leaving the church how many more do they have to die for this war to end and then the next day she herself became a victim al jazeera was reporting on her death mary Ellie's death last week and hannah hawkster had this little bite from the president of brazil have a listen to what he said about the crime around her killing brazil's president was quick to speak out to condemn the killing even though the two had disagreed over his recent plans to put the army in charge of security in rio de janeiro or a muddy edge the assassination of Councilwoman Marielle and her driver Anderson Gomez is unacceptable inadmissible like all the other murders that happen in Rio de Janeiro is truly an attack on the rule of law and on our democracy temer has promised to carry out a full and transparent investigation jameelah how much transparency has there been what do you know about the circumstances of malli Ali's death do you feel that the government is doing its best to keep everybody informed I don't believe that the government we investigate the way it should be because this government started after a coupe and this government defends the military intervention you Janeiro so I don't believe that they are they are going to solve that because Mariela was fight against a lot of politics up from justice government so I think it even you Gennaro even in the state government even in huge a NATO and the federal way I don't think so because it's important as you say that of course the military intervention Brazil which doesn't start now yes even in previous governments like you must government they started to put some they call pacification units in a lot of surveillance it doesn't starts now right at the end of the show here so if I if I asked you in a sentence to describe mariely what would be your sentence oh my god it's a difficult question I don't know maybe brave a ganache was a very brave woman very brave woman oh thank you so much Jamila and Kristin and Cecilia yeah the last word to black women of Brazil who says marry Ali gave her life to present the voice of a black woman that is rarely heard thank you very much to our guests thank you for watching us here on the stream Malik and I will be online see you there you
