MATERIAL REALITY OF THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS.

56
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:51,679
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO DO

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,114
ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO DO WITH THIS BOOK, I WANTED IT TO

58
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:54,315
WITH THIS BOOK, I WANTED IT TO BE A TOOL.

59
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,317
BE A TOOL. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE’S SO

60
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:57,952
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE’S SO MUCH THAT WE DON’T -- THAT

61
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,386
MUCH THAT WE DON’T -- THAT HAPPENS UNCONSCIOUSLY IN TERMS

62
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,789
HAPPENS UNCONSCIOUSLY IN TERMS OF HOW WE HEAR WOMEN’S ANGER,

63
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,026
OF HOW WE HEAR WOMEN’S ANGER, HOW WE -- HOW WOMEN MODULATE

64
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,495
HOW WE -- HOW WOMEN MODULATE THEIR OWN ANGER, HOW THEY TEMPER

65
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:09,296
THEIR OWN ANGER, HOW THEY TEMPER IT, HOW THEY CHANGE HOW THEY

66
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:10,998
IT, HOW THEY CHANGE HOW THEY SPEAK OR EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN

67
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,633
SPEAK OR EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO FALL INTO A NARROW

68
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,201
ORDER TO FALL INTO A NARROW WINDOW OF ACCEPTABILITY.

69
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,503
WINDOW OF ACCEPTABILITY. I THOUGHT ESPECIALLY WITH SO

70
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:16,838
I THOUGHT ESPECIALLY WITH SO MUCH MASS ANGER HAPPENING, THE

71
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:20,375
MUCH MASS ANGER HAPPENING, THE ANGER OF PROTESTERS, THE ANGER

72
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,143
ANGER OF PROTESTERS, THE ANGER OF CANDIDATES, THE ANGER OF

73
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:23,611
OF CANDIDATES, THE ANGER OF TEACHER STRIKERS, McDONALD’S

74
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:24,846
TEACHER STRIKERS, McDONALD’S WORKERS WHO WENT ON STRIKE LAST

75
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:25,947
WORKERS WHO WENT ON STRIKE LAST WEEK IN RESPONSE TO SEXUAL

76
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:26,748
WEEK IN RESPONSE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT, I THINK THAT THERE’S

77
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:28,950
HARASSMENT, I THINK THAT THERE’S SO MUCH THAT WE NEED TO REALLY

78
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,819
SO MUCH THAT WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE POLITICAL

79
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:31,953
THINK ABOUT THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCE OF WOMEN’S ANGER IN

80
00:02:31,987 --> 00:02:34,622
CONSEQUENCE OF WOMEN’S ANGER IN A WAY THAT WE’RE NOT TRAINED TO.

81
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:35,657
A WAY THAT WE’RE NOT TRAINED TO. AND ONE OF THE REASONS, ONE OF

82
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:36,724
AND ONE OF THE REASONS, ONE OF THE THINGS I SOUGHT TO DO WITH

83
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:38,526
THE THINGS I SOUGHT TO DO WITH THIS BOOK WAS TO SORT OF OUTLINE

84
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:39,961
THIS BOOK WAS TO SORT OF OUTLINE WHAT SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS AND

85
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,529
WHAT SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS AND WAYS OF HEARING AND WAYS OF

86
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:42,730
WAYS OF HEARING AND WAYS OF EXPRESSING AND WAYS OF

87
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:45,967
EXPRESSING AND WAYS OF DISMISSING WOMEN’S ANGER ARE SO

88
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,001
DISMISSING WOMEN’S ANGER ARE SO TO HELP US MAKE BETTER SENSE OF

89
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:47,535
TO HELP US MAKE BETTER SENSE OF THE WORLD.

90
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:48,536
THE WORLD. AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT’S

91
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,271
AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT’S PART OF WHAT IT DID.

92
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:51,672
PART OF WHAT IT DID. AND CHANGING THE WAY, PERHAPS,

93
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,074
AND CHANGING THE WAY, PERHAPS, THAT YOU HEARD THE HEARINGS LAST

94
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:53,374
THAT YOU HEARD THE HEARINGS LAST WEEK.

95
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,142
WEEK. >> WELL, AND PARTLY BECAUSE IT

96
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:57,479
>> WELL, AND PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN AMAZING COUNTERPOINT

97
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,680
WAS SUCH AN AMAZING COUNTERPOINT BETWEEN THE WAY THAT SHE WAS

98
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,281

THERE’S TWO HALVES HERE, THE WAY THAT WOMEN’S ANGER IS SUPPRESSED

107
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:13,995
THAT WOMEN’S ANGER IS SUPPRESSED BY SOCIETY AS THE BOOK TALKS

108
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:17,799
BY SOCIETY AS THE BOOK TALKS ABOUT, THE WAY IT CAN BE

109
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,435
ABOUT, THE WAY IT CAN BE MARSHALLED COLLECTIVELY FOR
