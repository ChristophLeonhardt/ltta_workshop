COMMENTS OF ONE OR TWO
COMMISSIONERS COULD SHOULD BE
TAKEN TO OVERCOME PHILLIPS
REFUSAL TO SELL A WEDDING CAKE."
>> Shannon: TOOK A BIG
DECISIONS DEALING WITH TWO HOT
BUTTON ISSUES, RELIGIOUS
FREEDOM, AND ABORTION FOR
UNDERAGED TEENS IN THE U.S.
ILLEGALLY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLITICAL
IMPACT WITH TYLER DEATON, SENIOR
ADVISOR OF THE AMERICAN UNITY
FUND AND TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT
OF THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL.
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Shannon: OBVIOUSLY, JUSTICE
KENNEDY POINTED BACK TO THOSE
COMMENTS BY COMMISSIONER AT THE
LOWEST LEVEL WHO WAS THE FIRST
TO LOOK AT THIS CASE.
LIKENING THE BACON OR DON MIKE
BAKER'S RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS TO
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED SLAVERY OR
TO NAZIS, THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR
THEM TO SAY COME ON THAT BASIS
ALONE, HE SHOULD NOT OF BEEN
SUBJECTED TO THAT DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST HIS RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS.
>> THAT ATTITUDE IS OUT OF
BALANCE AND SINCE THEN, THAT
COMMISSIONER IS NO LONGER ON THE
COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS
COMMISSION.
I THINK WHAT IT POINTS TO IS,
THOSE WERE HURTFUL STATEMENTS TO
MAKE ABOUT PEOPLE OF FAITH.
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF LGBT
AMERICANS WHO ARE ALSO HEARING
SOMETIMES HURTFUL THINGS SAID
ABOUT THEM, AND I THINK THAT ALL
OF US IS POINTING TO THE NEED
FOR US TO COME TOGETHER, COME
AND FIND SOME SORT OF A MIDDLE
GROUND, WHERE PEOPLE OF FAITH
AND LGBT PEOPLE CAN BOTH BE
RESPECTED BY THE LAWS AND CAN BE
OUT ON THE FREE MARKETPLACE
DOING THEIR BUSINESS AND KNOW
THAT THEY ARE FREE TO PURSUE
THEIR AMERICAN DREAM REGARDLESS
OF THEIR VALUES ARE REGARDLESS
OF WHO THEY ARE MARRIED TO.
>> Shannon: TODAY, JUSTICE
KENNEDY, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT
THE COURTS HAVE TO DECIDE THE
MEAT OF THIS CASE, HE SAID THERE
HAS TO BE TOLERANCE ON BOTH
SIDES FOR PEOPLE WITH GENUINE
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND AS YOU
SAID, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GAY AND
LESBIAN, WHO WANT TO BE IN
COMMERCE AND BUSINESS.
HE SAID IT WILL BE A DELICATE
QUESTION TO ANSWER.
WE KNOW ON THURSDAY, AND A
PRIVATE CONFERENCE, THEY WILL
CONSIDER THE CASE FOR
WASHINGTON'S FLORISTS, WHO
BASICALLY HAS BEEN PUT IN RUIN
BY WHAT SHE HAS FACED, A
LONG-TIME CUSTOMER OF HERS CAME
TO HER AND SAID, I WANTED TO DO
THE FLOWERS FOR MY SAME-SEX
WEDDING, SHE DECLINED.
THREE OTHERS, ACTUALLY.
THE FACT THAT THEY WILL CONSIDER
THAT CASE SAYS THAT THE COURT
ISSUE IS NOT DECIDED.
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.
NOBODY SHOULD BE SURPRISED BY
THIS, SHANNON.
THREE YEARS AGO, AND THEN A
CASE --
>> Shannon: WHICH LEGALIZED
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
>> RIGHT.
JUSTICE ALITO SAID THAT THIS
WILL LEAD TO THE VILIFICATION OF
THOSE WHO REFUSE TO ASCEND TO
THE NEW ORTHODOXY.
SO WE ARE SEEING THIS.
THIS IS EXACTLY WITH THE
COLORADO SO-CALLED CIVIL RIGHTS
COMMISSION DID, AND THAT WAS IN
THE OBAMA ERA, WHEN IT WAS
OPEN SEASON ON CHRISTIANS, AND
TO BE GREAT IF PEOPLE WOULD GET
ALONG BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN BECAUSE OF A COURT
DECISION.
IT WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE PEOPLE
DECIDE THAT, HEY, PEOPLE HAVE
DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS, BUT
WHAT WE ARE SEEING THESE WEDDING
VENDORS, LIKE JACK PHILLIPS, IS
THAT THESE ACTIVIST, LGBT
ACTIVISTS, ARE TARGETING THEM TO
MAKE EXAMPLES OUT OF THEM.
AS LONG AS THAT IS OCCURRING,
THESE THINGS WILL BE CHALLENGED,
YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE OF FAITH
PUSHING BACK AND IT WILL BE IN
THE COURTS, AND YOU ARE RIGHT.
UNDER THE ROBERTS COURT, THEY
HAVE HAD VERY NARROW DECISIONS
WITH LIMITED APPLICATION OF
THEIR DECISIONS, SO THIS IS NOT
SURPRISING.
BUT THIS THING IS GOING TO BE
BACK BEFORE THE COURTS AND
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT COULD BE
DECIDED THURSDAY.
THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE
FLORIST CASE.
>> Shannon: SOMETHING TELLS
ME, IF THEY VOTE YES ON THIS,
JUSTICE KENNEDY WON'T GO
ANYWHERE.
I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO STICK
AROUND OR BE A PART OF THE
CONSIDERATION OF A CASE IF THEY
MOVE FORWARD.
I WANT TO ASK YOU ALL ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT HAS FLOWN UNDER
THE RADAR.
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE CASE OF
UNDERAGE ILLEGAL WOMEN WHO COME
ACROSS THE BORDER, HERE IN THE
STATES, AND SEEKING AN ABORTION.
THE ACLU AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE
RALLIED FOR THEM TO SAY IT
SHOULD MATTER WHERE THEY ARE,
THEY SHOULD GET HELP WITH THESE
ABORTIONS, WHETHER THEY ARE HERE
ILLEGALLY OR NOT.
TODAY, THE SUPREME COURT VACATED
THE LOWER COURT RULING THAT
ESSENTIALLY SAID, YES, THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS TO HELP THEM
WITH THAT, OR WHEN THEY ARE IN
FEDERAL CUSTODY, IT HAS TO BE
ALLOWED.
BUT IT'S MOOT BECAUSE THE YOUNG
WOMAN WHO WAS AT THE CENTER OF
THAT CASE DID GET AN ABORTION.
THE ACLU SAYS THEY WANT TO STOP
FIGHTING ON THIS.
TWO SIDES HAVE WAITED FOR THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SAID, "WE
ARE PLEASED WITH THE SUPREME
COURT'S DECISION THAT SET ASIDE
A LOWER COURT'S DECISION."
THE SUPREME COURT AS HER.
WE MADE CLEAR THAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO
SEVILLA STATE ABORTIONS FOR
MINOR.
NARAL SAYS "EVERY WOMAN
I WANT TO GET A REACTION FOR
BOTH OF YOU.
TYLER, I WILL START WITH YOU.
>> THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING.
I THINK THAT MY ORGANIZATION,
BECAUSE WE ARE CONSERVATIVE
GROUP THAT DOES ADVOCATE FOR
LGBT ISSUES, I THINK THAT A LOT
OF PEOPLE END UP WONDERING IF WE
ARE WORKING ON OTHER SOCIAL
ISSUES, AND HOW WE FEEL ABOUT
THESE OTHER THINGS.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS IS
SOMETHING I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON.
BUT I DO THINK THAT HERE, IT'S
IMPORTANT TO TAKE A FULL AND
CONSISTENT PRO-LIFE POSITION.
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE LAST YEAR
THAT OUR GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO
DETAIN PREGNANT UNDOCUMENTED
WOMEN.
I THINK THAT AT THE CORE OF
THIS, WE ARE DETAINING PREGNANT
UNDOCUMENTED WOMEN.
WE SHOULD REVERSE THAT POLICY.
I THINK THE MOST PRO-LIFE THING
THAT WE COULD DO RIGHT NOW AND
THIS HAS BEEN ADVOCATED BY THE
CATHOLIC BISHOPS, SOUTHERN
BAPTIST CONVENTION, WE SHOULD
NOT BE DETAINING PREGNANT WOMEN,
AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS
PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH.
>> Shannon: TONY KIM A PART OF
THE PROBLEM THAT STEMS FROM
THESE CASES, THESE ARE
MINORS, IN MANY CASES, THIS
LEADS OFFICIALS WITH NO OTHER
CHOICE.
YOUR REACTION?
>> FIRST OFF, I COMMEND THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WE'VE
BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ON THIS.
THEY WERE WORKING VERY
DILIGENTLY TO FIND SPONSORS FOR
SOME OF THESE UNACCOMPANIED
MINORS.
THIS IS STILL AN ISSUE.
IT'S ONGOING.
OTHER COURTS, I THINK THERE IS
CONCERN THAT THEY WILL BE FORCED
TO FACILITATE THESE ABORTIONS IT
IN OTHER CASES.
I THINK THIS COURT DECISION IS A
VERY GOOD ONE.
I LOOK FOR THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT TO MAKE MOST OF THIS
BECAUSE THIS IS AN
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS VERY
COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE
SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE, ALL
HUMAN LIFE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT
SIDE OF THE BORDER, TRACKS, IT'S
CONCEIVED ON.
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD DECISION.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE MAKING THE MOST OF
IT.
>> Shannon: TONY AND TYLER,
THANK YOU BOTH ARE A VERY
