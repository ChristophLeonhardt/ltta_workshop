a really really creepy story out of a Portland a portland family this is from a ki ro panel seven up in Portland Oregon area a portland family contacted amazon to investigate after they say a private conversation in their home was recorded by Amazon's Alexa the voice controlled smart speaker that's not bad enough the recorded audio this family alleges was then sent to the phone of a random person in Seattle Washington because that person happened to have been in the family's contact list now that is really scary I don't have an Amazon device in my house but here's my phone I've got hundreds and hundreds of contacts so many that I've met over the years in business in law enforcement half of those people I don't know I don't speak to I'm just too lazy to go through my phone and purge those contacts it would be weird you know if he's scary it'd be creepy really inappropriate if a private conversation I had in my home was sent to one of those people what if I was talking about those people what if I wasn't being flattering of those people this is really creepy so the woman named Danielle this family asking Amazon to investigate they don't want to use their last name I don't want their photos out there which is why I tend to believe their story these people are I'm putting their names and faces out there looking for a payday they'd quote my husband and I would joke and I'd say I bet these devices are listening to what we're saying well Danielle seems like you're right now they say every room in their home was wired with the Alexa devices to control the heat and the lighting and a security system you know that's how they market their sixth and all-inclusive a home electronic solutions purity heat light a you see all that stuff but Danielle had two weeks ago their love for Alexa change that alarming phone call the person on the other line said unplug your Alexa devices right now you're being hacked that person was one of her husband's employees calling from Seattle so the random person that the message was sent to was one of the family the husband's employee goes on to say quote we unplugged all of them and he proceeded to tell us the employee that he had received audio files of recordings from inside our house at first my husband was like no you didn't and the guy who got the message said you sat there talking about hardwood floors and we said oh gosh you really did hear us Danielle listen to the conversation when it was sent back to her and she couldn't believe someone a hundred and seventy six miles away no he said she felt invaded it was an invasion of privacy and she's never plugging that device in again because she can't trust it now he called Amazon and an Alexa engineer investigated quote Amazon's she says quote but Amazon told her they said our engineers went through your logs and saw exactly what you told us they saw exactly what you said happened and we're sorry he apologized like 15 times in a matter of 30 minutes that he said we really appreciate you bringing us to our attention our attention this is something we need to fix now we heard about that that in that other data breach I forgot to breach that dater I don't know it was Snowden or that reality winner weirdo or but we learned that CIA was using devices or had the ability to backdoor in a devices to spy on Americans got Amazon very left-leaning and you guys watch me you know I am NOT a conspiracy theorist you know that but we know that the NSA spied on American citizen you have companies like Amazon that are very left-leaning that have these lucrative contracts with government agencies like the DoD do we really believe that a device like a lexan is all I'm gonna say we really believe that a device like Alexa wouldn't be used a spy of course it could I mean it's it's a big gigantic microphone it's almost like a joke like a comedy movie hey I'm putting a bug in your house and it's like one of those old brick cell phones of course those things could be turned on to listen remotely I mean that's pretty rudimentary technology which is why I don't have one I would never have one I want to bring you this content every day help me do that by subscribing to our premium service at www.mediaed.org onload the rebel app and go to fire Scott Israel com sign our petition as always thanks so much for watching you have a great weekend a great Memorial Day weekend I'll see you on Monday
