00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:25,625
WE'RE PASSING SO MUCH. 

14
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,662

LOOK AT THE VICTORIES WE'VE

20
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,337
AND TERRY, I DIDN'T SPEAK TO

00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:41,174

00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,710
PARTICULARLY HAPPY ABOUT ONE OF

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,578
DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE? 

25
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:46,312
I THINK YOU DO. 

26
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,847
I WANT TO THANK PAUL RYAN. 

27
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:54,754
I WANT TO THANK OUR GREAT 

28
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,187
CONGRESSMAN GLENN. 

29
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:55,588
WHERE IS GLENN? 

30
00:00:55,588 --> 00:01:00,260
GLENN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

31
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:00,760
GOOD JOB. 

32
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:00,993
GLENN. 

33
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:01,394
WHERE IS GLENN? 

34
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,062

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

36
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:05,197
GREAT JOB, GLENN. 

37
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:08,401
AND WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER 

38
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,302
OFFICIALS. 

39
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:19,212
BUT I HAVE TO THANK A MAN WHO I 

40
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:19,512
GAVE IT TO. 

41
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,481
IT'S LIKE HANDING OFF THE 

42
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,383
FOOTBALL AND HE RAN FOR 200 

43
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:23,850
YARDS THAT GAME. 

44
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,585
MOST PEOPLE COULD NOT HAVE DONE 

45
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:25,751
IT. 

46
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,620
TERRY AND I HAD HAVE HAD A 

47
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,053
GREAT RELATIONSHIP. 

48
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:30,723
AND TERRY WAS THINKING ABOUT 

49
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,357
DOING THIS. 

50
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:36,763
AND DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT 

51
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,098
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL  GUY. 

52
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:38,898
HE WAS IN MY OFFICE. 

53
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,268
A FRIEND OF MINE SET IT UP. 

54
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,271
HE SAID I WANT TO INVEST $50 

55
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,907
BILLION IN THE UNITED STATES. 

56
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,775
I SAID YOU DON'T MEAN 50 

57
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:50,042
BILLION. 

58
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:50,543
YOU MEAN 50 MILLION. 

59
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,912
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH A 

60
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:53,680
FIVE-MINUTE MEETING, 50 

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,080
MILLION. 

62
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,517
AND SO I THOUGHT HE WAS SAYING 

63
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,050
50 MILLION. 

64
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,120
I WANT TODAY MAKE IT QUICK. 

65
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,055
BUT I HEARD ABOUT HIM. 

66
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,290
HE ALONG WITH TERRY THEY'RE 

67
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,657
BEST FRIENDS. 

68
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,060
HE CAME OUT AND I SAID SO GOOD 

69
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,830
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO INVEST 

70
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,097
IN? 

71
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:14,801
HE SAID -- I SAID YOU CAN'T DO 

72
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,334
THAT FOR 50 MILLION. 

73
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:18,938
AND HE SAID NO I WANT TO INVEST 

74
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,438
50 BILLION. 

75
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:22,308
AND HE MISREPRESENTED TO ME. 

76
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:22,942
HE DID. 

77
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,078
BECAUSE HE SPENT MUCH MORE THAN 

78
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,046
$50 BILLION IN THE UNITED 

79
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,615
STATES. 

80
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,717
AND THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. 

81
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:38,958
AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO A 

82
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:43,763
LOT MORE. 

83
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,197
I WANT TO THANK MASSA. 

84
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:51,037
I WANT TO THANK HIM. 

85
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:57,944
COME UP HERE. 

86
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,545
HE DOESN'T PLAY GAMES. 

87
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,746
HE DOESN'T LIKE SMALL NUMBERS. 

88
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:01,581
ARE YOU PROUD OF TERRY. 

89
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,514
>> YES, I AM. 

90
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:03,549
>> SAY SOMETHING ABOUT TERRY. 

91
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,452
COME ON. 

92
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,387
>> TERRY IS MY BEST FRIEND. 

93
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:10,789
AND WE ARE THE BROTHERS. 

94
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:15,061
>> WHAT ABOUT ME? 

95
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:15,227
NO? 

96
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:16,829
>> OF COURSE. 

97
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,034
>> SO I PROMISED THE FIRST TIME 

98
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,069
THAT I MET PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST 

99
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:23,669
BEFORE YOU BECAME OFFICIAL 

100
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:23,970
PRESIDENT. 

101
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,370
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

102
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,442
>> I THINK I WAS THE FIRST CEO 

103
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:29,875
CAME TO CELEBRATE. 

104
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,710
>> THAT'S TRUE. 

105
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,144
THAT'S TRUE. 

106
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:31,344
AND. 

107
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,547
>> AND I SAID $50 BILLION 

108
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:41,887
INVESTMENT AND 50,000 JOBS TO 

109
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,289
THE UNITED STATES. 

110
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,159
BECAUSE I COULDN'T HAVE DECIDED 

111
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,361
SUCH A THING BEFORE THIS NEW 

112
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:48,661
PRESIDENT. 

113
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,831
BECAUSE I SAID, NOW I SEE THE 

114
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:56,435
PASSION, I SEE THE OPPORTUNITY. 

115
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:56,969
I'M MORE ENERGIZED. 

116
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,938
SO I MADE A PROMISE. 

117
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,440
AND NOW I'M VERY HAPPY. 

118
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,074
WE'RE MAKING GREAT SUCCESS. 

119
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:07,046
AND I SAID I HAVE ONE MORE 

120
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,282
THING TO PROMISE, WHICH IS 

121
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:15,655
FOXCONN. 

122
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,055
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

123
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:20,259
>> DID I NOT HAVE OFFICIAL 

124
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:20,892
OFFICIAL PERMISSION FROM TERRY 

125
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,628
BUT I PROMISED. 

126
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,664
>> YOU BROUGHT HIM ALONG. 

127
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:24,897
RIGHT. 

128
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,664
YOU BROUGHT HIM ALONG. 

129
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:32,105
>> I'M SO HAPPY TODAY THAT MY 

130
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,540
PROMISE CAME TO TRUTH. 

131
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,808
SO THIS IS A GREAT HISTORICAL 

132
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:36,809
MOMENT BECAUSE I THINK THE 

133
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:41,547
UNITED STATES DID NOT HAVE THE 

134
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,482
ECOSYSTEM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY 

135
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,049
LAST 20 YEARS. 

136
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:47,754
AND NOW THIS IS THE BEGINNING 

137
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,155
OF NEW ECOSYSTEM OF HIGH TECH 

138
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,957
MANUFACTURING BACK INTO THE 

139
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,691
UNITED STATES. 

140
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,166
>> THANK YOU. 

141
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,969
ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESS MEN 

142
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,171
OF THE WORLD ALSO. 

143
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:05,471
THOSE TWO. 

144
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,240
THAT IS SOME COMBINATION 

145
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,007
STANDING BACK STAGE. 

146
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:08,774
I SAID WHOA. 

147
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,943
BUT THEY LIKE EACH OTHER. 

148
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,179
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER. 

149
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,747
AND HIS 50 BILLION TURNED OUT 

150
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,516
TO BE 72 BILLION SO FAR. 

151
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,452
HE IS NOT FINISHED YET. 

152
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,654
AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE 

153
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,021
FOXCONN. 

154
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,157
SO BIG STUFF. 

155
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,392
I WANT TO THANK ANOTHER VERY 

156
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:26,725
SPECIAL MAN. 

157
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,861
I HOPE HE CAN HEAR ME BECAUSE I 

158
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,031
WANT HIM TO COME ON STAGE 

159
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,934
BECAUSE I HANDED THE BALL OVER. 

160
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,638
TERRY IS A FRIEND OF MINE. 

161
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,907
AND I RECOMMENDED WISCONSIN IN 

162
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,441
THIS CASE. 

163
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,909
AND I'LL BE RECOMMENDING OHIO 

164
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,610
AND I'LL BE RECOMMENDING 

165
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,245
PENNSYLVANIA AND I'LL BE 

166
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,613
RECOMMENDING IOWA AND I'LL BE 

167
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,449
RECOMMENDING -- BUT THIS IS 

168
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,183
SOMETHING THAT JUST SEEMED 

169
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:50,483
RIGHT. 

170
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,784
AND THE REASON IS THAT YOU HAVE 

171
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:57,056
A CAR PLANT IN A VERY NICE 

172
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:57,323
LOCATION. 

173
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:06,299
AND I FLEW OVER THAT PLANT WITH 

174
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,301
ANOTHER GREAT WISCONSINITE. 

175
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,069
I THINK HE IS AROUND HERE OR 

176
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:10,369
SOMETHING. 

177
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:10,937
HE'S A GREAT GUY. 

178
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,105
I SAID THAT WOULD BE A GOOD 

179
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,373
SITE. 

180
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:21,113
TE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SIZE 

181
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,649
IS ABOUT -- OF THAT SITE. 

182
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,118
THIS IS BIG STUFF. 

183
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,785
I HANDED IT OVER TO TERRY. 

184
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,320
I SAID THIS PLACE IS SUCH A 

185
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,988
GREAT PLACE. 

186
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,556
YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED THE 

187
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,326
OTHER DAY THEY TOLD ME, WHEN WE 

188
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:38,865
WON THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, IT 

189
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,399
HADN'T BEEN WON BY A REPUBLICAN 

190
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,134
SINCE DWIGHT D EISENHOWER IN 

191
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:42,334
1952. 

192
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,337
DID YOU KNOW THAT? 

193
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:44,970
AND I WON WISCONSIN. 

194
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,943
AND I LIKE WISCONSIN A LOT. 

195
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,345
BUT WE WON WISCONSIN. 

196
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,046
AND RONALD REAGAN, REMEMBER, 

197
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,715
WISCONSIN WAS THE STATE THAT 

198
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,018
RONALD REAGAN DID NOT WIN. 

199
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,754
AND THAT WAS IN 1952. 

200
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,090
AND I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE 

201
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,423
PEOPLE HERE. 

202
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:04,957
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE. 

203
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,894
I SAID TO TERRY, THIS WOULD BE 

204
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,228
AN INCREDIBLE PLACE. 

205
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,830
THEN I HEARD THE MAGNITUDE. 

206
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,131
THIS IS MAGNITUDE THAT NONE OF 

207
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:12,598
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. 

208
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,267
SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

209
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:14,967
SEE IT. 

210
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,838
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, THE 

211
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,271
ABSOLUTE BEGINNING. 

212
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,339
SOY HAD THIS INCREDIBLE COMPANY 

213
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,409
GOING TO INVEST SOMEPLACE IN 

214
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:23,709
THE WORLD. 

215
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,209
NOT HERE NECESSARILY. 

216
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,479
I WILL TELL YOU THEY WOULDN'T 

217
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,381
HAVE DONE IT HERE EXCEPT I 

218
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,982
BECAME PRESIDENT, SO THAT IS 

219
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:30,182
GOOD. 

220
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,018
BUT THEY WANT TODAY DO IT 

221
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:35,454
SOMEPLACE NOW IN THE UNITED 

222
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:35,687
STATES. 

223
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:38,491
AND I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF 

224
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,191
THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. 

225
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,893
TERRY CAME UP, FELL IN LOVE 

226
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,595
WITH THE PEOPLE, FELL IN LOVE 

227
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,730
WITH THE LOCATION, FELL IN LOVE 

228
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,866
WITH THE CONCEPT HERE. 

229
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,435
HE'S GOING TO MAKE ROBOTICS 

230
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:49,635
HERE. 

231
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,003
THEY'RE DOING MANY OTHER 

232
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,638
THINGS, INCLUDING FULL 

233
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,038
TELEVISION SETS. 

234
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:53,705
THEY'RE DOING MANY THINGS HERE. 

235
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,441
AND THEY WILL DO A LOT OF 

236
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:55,741
EXPANSION. 

237
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,543
BUT I HAD TO HAND OFF THE BALL. 

238
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,711
IN PRIVATE LIFE, YOU KNOW, YOU 

239
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,579
HAND OFF THE BALL AND SOMETIMES 

240
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,882
THEY DO A GOOD JOB AND 

241
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,283
SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE, WHAT 

242
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:04,550
HAPPENED? 

243
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,150
DIDN'T WORK OUT. 

244
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,985
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK OUT? 

245
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:11,857
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT 

246
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,325
THEY WERE DOING. 

247
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:14,326
AND SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS. 

248
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,962
THERE ARE VERY FEW GOVERNORS I 

249
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,630
COULD HAVE SAID GOOD LUCK 

250
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,499
YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD ONE OF 

251
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,400
THE LARGEST OPERATIONS IN THE 

252
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,235
WORLD, OVER 20 MILLION FEET. 

253
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:23,569
GOOD LUCK. 

254
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,404
I GAVE IT TO SCOTT WALKER. 

255
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,439
HE LITERALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO 

256
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,608
MAKE A PHONE CALL TO ME FOR THE 

257
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,410
LAST YEAR AND A HALF. 

258
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,645
HE IS AN UNBELIEVABLY TALENTED 

259
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,212
GUY. 

260
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,081
I'M TELLING YOU, SCOTT WALKER. 

261
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,817
SCOTT, COME HERE. 

262
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,186
IS SCOTT AROUND, PLEASE? 

263
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,054
SCOTT WALKER. 

264
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:43,554
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. 

265
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:49,629
COME HERE. 

266
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,063
>> WHATEVER HE SAID, HE SHOULD 

267
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:51,998
SAY. 

268
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,699
>> WELL, THANKS, MR. PRESIDENT. 

269
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,935
AS YOU MENTIONED, YOU GOT THE 

270
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:56,302
BALL ROLLING. 

271
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,105
FOXCONN WOULD NOT BE IN AMERICA 

272
00:08:59,105 --> 00:08:59,939
IF NOT FOR YOU. 

273
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,074
BACK IN APRIL 2017 WHEN YOU 

274
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,143
TOLD TERRY ABOUT NOT ONLY BEING 

275
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:10,950
IN AMERICA BUT TOLD THEM THERE 

276
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,650
WAS A GOOD SITE. 

277
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,017
HONEST TRUTH. 

278
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:14,286
WE SAID WE HAVE TO GET A BIGGER 

279
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:16,556
SITE THAN THAT BECAUSE THIS IS 

280
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,356
BIGGER THAN WE EVER THOUGHT. 

281
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,226
YOUR TEAM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, 

282
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,861
JARED, YOUR CABINET WAS HANDS 

283
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:22,828
ON DECK. 

284
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,395
GREAT TEAM EFFORT HERE. 

285
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:28,301
WE COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO 

286
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,602
HAVE FOXCONN'S 8K TECHNOLOGY 

287
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,438
LCD PANELS FOR THE FIRST TIME 

288
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,673
EVER OUTSIDE OF ASIA MADE HERE 

289
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,474
IN THE UNITED STATES, HERE IN 

290
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,109
THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. 

291
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,811
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

292
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,378
>> WE LOVE YOU. 

293
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:39,678
TAKE CARE. 

294
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:42,782
>> SO I GAVE SCOTT THE BALL AND 

295
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,384
HE CARRIED THE BALL. 

296
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,688
AND IF THAT WERE A FOOTBALL 

297
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,323
STANDARDS, HE RAN FOR ABOUT 

298
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,725
2,000 YARDS IN ONE GAME. 

299
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,159
SPECIAL GUY. 

300
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,526
SPECIAL TALENT. 

301
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,426
FORGET ABOUT SPECIAL GUY. 

302
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,462
HE IS A SPECIAL TALENT. 

303
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,332
SO I HOPE HE DOESN'T RUN 

304
00:09:59,332 --> 00:09:59,632
AGAINST ME. 

305
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,399
THAT COMMENT -- THAT COMMENT 

306
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,269
WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT ME. 

307
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,808
HE IS A SPECIAL TALENT AND A 

308
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,175
SPECIAL PERSON. 

309
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,910
AS FOXCONN HAS DISCOVERED, 

310
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,611
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO 

311
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,612
BUILD HIGHER IN GROW THAN RIGHT 

312
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,314
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. 

313
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,482
AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS 

314
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,485
MORE THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN OPEN 

315
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,085
FOR BUSINESS. 

316
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,321
BETWEEN OUR LOW TAXES, OUR 

317
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,189
CUTTING OF REGULATIONS. 

318
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,557
WE'RE NOT FINISHED WITH THE 

319
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,224
REGULATIONS. 

320
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,392
AND WE WILL HAVE REGULATION. 

321
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,826
BUT IT IS SENSIBLE REGULATION. 

322
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:32,732
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET THINGS 

323
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,132
APPROVED QUICKLY. 

324
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,499
OR DISAPPROVED. 

325
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,801
SOMETIMES IT IS GOING TO BE 

326
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,368
DISAPPROVED. 

327
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:37,069
WE HAVE CLEAN AIR. 

328
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,003
WE HAVE CRYSTAL CLEAN WATER. 

329
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,605
WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF THE 

330
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,740
THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO BUT 

331
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,775
WE'RE GOING TO SPEED UP THE 

332
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,041
PROCESS. 

333
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,976
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO 

334
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,844
BUILD A PLANT LIKE THIS, IT 

335
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:48,814
WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM 25 YEARS 

336
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,281
TO GET APPROVALS. 

337
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,350
25 YEARS. 

338
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,384
THEY GOT THEM ALMOST 

339
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:52,717
IMMEDIATELY. 

340
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,019
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD 

341
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:54,754
A LOT TO SAY. 

342
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,088
WE HAD TO GET GOING. 

343
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:56,655
AND THEY DID. 

344
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,190
AND HERE WE ARE. 

345
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,292
AND THEY'RE STARTING OTHER 

346
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,427
SECTIONS RIGHT NOW. 

347
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,962
SO WE'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 

348
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:03,429
MADE IN THE USA. 

349
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,364
IT IS ALL HAPPENING AND IT IS 

350
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:10,269
HAPPENING VERY, VERY QUICKLY. 

351
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:15,040
WE'VE CREATED 3.4 MILLION JOBS 

352
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,443
SINCE THE ELECTION. 

353
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,878
INCLUDING OVER 300,000 

354
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:19,612
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

355
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,314
AND AS YOU SAW THE RECENT POLL 

356
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,148
JUST CAME OUT. 

357
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:24,550
THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF 

358
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,719
HAPPINESS BY MANUFACTURERS IN 

359
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,156
THE HISTORY OF THE POLL, WHICH 

360
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,257
IS A REALLY OLD POLL. 

361
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,324
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ARE THE 

362
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:36,162
LOWEST THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN 

363
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:36,495
44 YEARS. 

364
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,363
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-

365
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,867
AMERICANS IS AT THE LOWEST 

366
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,400
LEVEL IN HISTORY. 

367
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,337
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR HISPANIC 

368
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,708
AMERICANS, THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 

369
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,075
HISTORY. 

370
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,343
UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG WOMEN, AND 

371
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,445
I'VE BEEN SAYING IT HAS JUST 

372
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,247
CHANGED TODAY, IS AT THE LOWEST 

373
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,683
LEVEL -- AND I'VE BEEN TELLING 

374
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,450
YOU 21 YEARS. 

375
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,586
IT IS NOW AT THE LOWEST LEVEL 

376
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,622
IN 65 YEARS AND IT IS GOING TO 

377
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,959
BE IN HISTORY VERY SOON. 

378
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,595
HISTORY SOUNDS EVEN BETTER. 

379
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,998
FOR THE WORKERS, AFTER 20 

380
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,599
YEARS, WAGES ARE RISING. 

381
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,302
REMEMBER I USED TO SAY THEY DID 

382
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,270
BETTER 20 YEARS AGO THAN THEY 

383
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,837
DID TWO YEARS AGO. 

384
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,973
NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO DO 

385
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:21,206
BETTER. 

386
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,975
AND THEY'RE HAVING THEIR CHOICE 

387
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,378
OF JOBS WHERE THEY CAN ENJOY 

388
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,780
WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 

389
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,950
A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT 95% 

390
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,651
OF MANUFACTURERS THEY WANT TO 

391
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,085
GET GOING. 

392
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,519
AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET GOING. 

393
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,990
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE 

394
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,625
THINGS HAPPENING IN THE UNITED 

395
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:39,858
STATES. 

396
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,260
BUT TO ME THIS IS ALWAYS GOING 

397
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,530
TO BE THE SPECIAL ONE. 

398
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,598
BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT ARE HIGHLY 

399
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,699
SOPHISTICATED, BUSINESS PEOPLE 

400
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,166
WHO HAVE COME OUT -- LOOK, I 

401
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,835
HAD A FRIEND COME OUT TWO WEEKS 

402
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,170
AGO BECAUSE HE HEARD ABOUT IT. 

403
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,405
HE IS A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED 

404
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,874
BUSINESS PERSON THAT YOU ALL 

405
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:55,074
KNOW. 

406
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,508
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. 

407
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:57,309
HE CALLED ME UP. 

408
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,545
AND HE WOULD LOVE TO TELL ME, 

409
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,078
IT IS NOTHING. 

410
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,414
HE'S THAT KIND OF A GUY. 

411
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,782
NOT REALLY A NICE GUY. 

412
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,852
BUT HE IS A GREAT BUSINESSMAN. 

413
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,321
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT HE IS 

414
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,591
SEEING. 

415
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:24,870
WE ARE DEMANDING FROM FOREIGN 

416
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,471
COUNTRIES, FRIEND AND FAUX -- 

417
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:29,642
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE LOST OUR 

418
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,009
COMPANIES. 

419
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,110
WE HAVE LOST OUR JOBS. 

420
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,645
THEY BUILD A PRODUCT, THEY SEND 

421
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:32,912
IT IN. 

422
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,280
THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO 

423
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,580
BEAUTIFUL. 

424
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,848
BECAUSE THIS IS AS GREAT AS 

425
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,416
THERE IS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 

426
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,051
AND WE DO IT WITHIN OUR 

427
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:39,718
COUNTRY. 

428
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,154
AND I JUST WANT TO LET YOU 

429
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,091
KNOW, WE PUT TARIFFS ON STEEL 

430
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:46,424
AND ALUMINUM. 

431
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:47,960
THOSE BUSINESSES ARE THROUGH 

432
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,226
THE ROOF. 

433
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,529
U.S. STEEL CALLED ME UP. 

434
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,731
THEY'RE EXPANDING OR OPENING 

435
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,133
SIX PLANTS. 

436
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,536
THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN 35 

437
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:58,904
YEARS. 

438
00:13:58,904 --> 00:13:59,705
GEORGETOWN STEEL IN SOUTH 

439
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:04,743
CAROLINA CLOSED FOUR YEARS AGO. 

440
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,644
CLOSED AND SHUTTERED. 

441
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,511
THEY'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 

442
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:06,912
600 PEOPLE THAT. 

443
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,482
IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE 

444
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,083
COUNTRY. 

445
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,451
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 

446
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,054
SO I WANT TO LEVEL OUT AND I'M 

447
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,288
DOING IT, LEVEL OUT THE PLAYING 

448
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:16,521
FIELD. 

449
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,991
AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU 

450
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,659
HEAR, SOME -- I MEAN, FRANKLY 

451
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:25,230
THE SMART PEOPLE LOVE IT. 

452
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,064
SOME PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND 

453
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:27,066
IT. 

454
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,035
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE TREATED 

455
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,839
FAIRLY WHEN OUR GREAT FARMERS 

456
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,040
IN IOWA, WISCONSIN, UPPER NEW 

457
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,343
YORK STATE, WHEN WE WANT TO 

458
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,477
SELL OUR DAIRY PRODUCTS INTO 

459
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:45,351
CAN BE DA, THEY CHARGE US 275%. 

460
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:45,551
275%. 

461
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,285
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING 

462
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,485
IS WE DON'T WANT YOUR PRODUCT. 

463
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,021
BECAUSE WHO IS GOING TO PAY 

464
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:49,254
THAT? 

465
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:51,489
SO WE'RE GOING TO LEVEL OUT THE 

466
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:52,023
PLAYING FIELDS, FOLKS. 

467
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:54,626
THEY SEND US A LOT OF STUFF. 

468
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:54,960
NO TAX. 

469
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,829
WE'RE GOING TO WORK IT OUT. 

470
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,064
IT IS GOING TO BE FRIENDLY. 

471
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,498
WE LOVE CANADA. 

472
00:14:59,498 --> 00:14:59,865
I LOVE CANADA. 

473
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:05,537
BUT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ITOUT. 

474
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,505
MEXICO, LAST YEAR MADE A 

475
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,042
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS PLUS 

476
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,412
THEY HAVE A 17% ALMOST VAT TAX 

477
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,679
THATY ABOUT. 

478
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,181
SO WE WERE BEHIND THE 8 BALL 

479
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:20,185
BECAUSE THAT TAX WAS THERE AT 

480
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:20,686
THE BEGINNING. 

481
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,922
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING WE 

482
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,956
WERE BEHIND THE 8 BALL. 

483
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,123
MEXICO WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL. 

484
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,092
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH 

485
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:27,692
A LOT OF PEOPLE. 

486
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:33,899
CHINA, I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT  

487
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,333
I THINK IT IS GREAT. 

488
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,168
AND THE PRESIDENT IS GREAT. 

489
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:40,539
HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE. 

490
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,641
BUT WE LOST $500 BILLION OVER 

491
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:49,815
THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. 

492
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,316
$500BILLION A YEAR. 

493
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:51,916
WE'VE HELPED REBUILD CHINA. 

494
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,018
SOME DAY THEY WILL SAY THANK 

495
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:53,218
YOU. 

496
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,821
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT 

497
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:56,087
ANYMORE. 

498
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,656
WE WANT TO HAVE A FAIR AND 

499
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,123
BALANCED SITUATION. 

500
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,392
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN 

501
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:00,725
IMMEDIATELY. 

502
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,461
BUT IT HAS TO BE FAIR. 

503
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,262
BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS NEVER 

504
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:08,333
DONE BETTER THAN IT IS DOING 

505
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:08,633
RIGHT NOW. 

506
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,701
EUROPEAN UNION LAST YEAR TRADE 

507
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:16,275
IMBALANCE, WE HAD A DEFICIT OF 

508
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,075
$151 BILLION. 

509
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:17,743
THEY SEND US MERCEDES. 

510
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:22,848
THEY SEND US BY THE MILLIONS 

511
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:23,115
THE BMWs. 

512
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,983
CARS BY THE MILLIONS. 

513
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,653
WE SEND THEM A BUSHEL OF CORN 

514
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,220
AND THEY REJECT IT. 

515
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,023
THEY DON'T WANT OUR CORN 

516
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,959
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR 

517
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:34,226
FARMERS. 

518
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,594
OKAY I UNDERSTAND. 

519
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,296
IF YOU DON'T WANT OUR 

520
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,330
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT, WE DON'T 

521
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,364
WANT YOUR CARS. 

522
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:40,766
IT IS NOT A COMPLICATED 

523
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,033
FORMULA. 

524
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,269
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND 

525
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:44,770
SAY LET'S TALK. 

526
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,574
FRANKLY DON'T TELL THEM I SAID 

527
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,742
IT BUT THEY ALREADY HAVE. 

528
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,978
DON'T EVER TELL THEM I SAID 

529
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:53,178
THAT. 

530
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,849
IT WILL SCREW UP MY 

531
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,216
NEGOTIATIONS. 

532
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,550
THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE. 

533
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,152
AND IT WILL WORK OUT. 

534
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:00,785
MANY, MANY OTHER CASES. 

535
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:02,421
WE ACTUALLY MADE A DEAL WITH 

536
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,355
SOUTH KOREA. 

537
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,522
WE TOOK THE DEAL. 

538
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:05,455
I EXPIRED IT. 

539
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:07,960
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DEAL. 

540
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,965
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE US 

541
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,367
250,000 JOBS DONE BY HILLARY 

542
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,136
CLINTON. 

543
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,936
SHE WAS RIGHT, IT DID GIVE 

544
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:19,371
250,000 JOBS. 

545
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:19,905
SO SHE WAS RIGHT. 

546
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,473
IT GAVE IT TO SOUTH KOREA. 

547
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,608
NOT TO US. 

548
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,176
THIS WAS NOT A GOOD DEAL. 

549
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:27,845
BUT WE HAVE RENEGOTIATED THE 

550
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:28,079
DEAL. 

551
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,214
AND SUBJECT TO SIGNING -- I 

552
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,582
ALWAYS SAY SUBJECT TO SIGNING 

553
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,449
BECAUSE LOTS OF THINGS HAPPEN. 

554
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,418
AND IF IT DID HAPPEN, THAT'S 

555
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:33,618
FINE. 

556
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:35,854
BUT WE MADE A NEW DEAL WITH 

557
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:36,521
SOUTH KOREA. 

558
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:39,057
WONDERFUL DEAL FOR BOTH. 

559
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,926
AND OUR FARMERS NOW ARE 

560
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:41,226
PROTECTED. 

561
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,961
AND OUR TARIFF WHICH HAS BEEN 

562
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,530
PAID FOR YEARS WHICH WAS 

563
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,065
EXPIRING HAS NOW BEEN EXTENDED 

564
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:51,470
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR 

565
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,137
TRUCKS. 

566
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,573
AT THE CENTER OF AMERICA'S 

567
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,207
ECONOMIC RESURGENCE ARE THE 

568
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,276
MASSIVE TAX CUT THAT'S I SIGNED 

569
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,443
INTO LAW SIX MONTHS AGO. 

570
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,646
WE SLASHED TAX RATES FOR 

571
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:05,417
INDIVIDUALS AND WE DID NUMBERS 

572
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:05,750
FOR BUSINESS. 

573
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,118
WE DID TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS 

574
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,053
AMOUNT OF WORK. 

575
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:12,090
AND IT IS THE LARGEST TAX CUT 

576
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,359
EVER APPROVED, EVER GOTTEN IN 

577
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,363
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

578
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,598
TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORM. 

579
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,934
INCLUDED IN THERE IS THE 

580
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,534
LARGEST DRILLING SITE 

581
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,803
POTENTIALLY IN THE WORLD AND 

582
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,205
ALASKA. 

583
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,339
WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL 

584
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,674
MANDATE WHICH IS GOING TO BE 

585
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,576
GREAT FOR THE PEOPLE HERE AND 

586
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,677
THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE. 

587
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:35,847
IN OTHER WORDS, WE GOT RID OF 

588
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:36,481
OBAMACARE'S INDIVIDUAL MANDATE 

589
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:39,384
WHERE YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF 

590
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,087
PAYING A LOT OF MONEY FOR NOT 

591
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,789
HAVING TO BUY HEALTH CARE. 

592
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,556
THINK OF THAT. 

593
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,123
THINK OF THAT ONE. 

594
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:51,296
YOU PAY A LOT OF MONEY NOT TO 

595
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,132
HAVE HEALTH CARE. 

596
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,634
SO IT'S GONE. 

597
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,037
MOST UNPOPULAR PROVISION IN 

598
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,105
OBAMACARE BY FAR. 

599
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:05,244
AND OBAMACARE IS LARGELY GONE 

600
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:05,544
NOW. 

601
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,411
AND WE'RE OPENING UP 

602
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:10,282
UNBELIEVABLE HEALTH KARA CROSS 

603
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:10,916
STATE LINES. 

604
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:11,349
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. 

605
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:11,950
REALLY GREAT HEALTH CARE. 

606
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,051
EVERYONE IS COMPETING FOR IT. 

607
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,920
ALL OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES 

608
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,924
ARE DYING TO GET IT. 

609
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,226
THEY ALL WANT TO COMPETE. 

610
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,362
THE COSTS WILL BE LOW. 

611
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,031
IT IS COSTING OUR COUNTRY 

612
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:26,298
NOTHING. 

613
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:26,564
NOTHING. 

614
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:28,967
IT IS BETTER THAN ANY FORM OF 

615
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:29,267
INSURANCE. 

616
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:31,069
WE HAVE ASSOCIATION AND THEN 

617
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,939
SECRETARY AZAR IS COMING OUT IN 

618
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,476
THREE WEEKS WITH A MASSIVE 

619
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,176
PLAN. 

620
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,845
WE DID REPEAL AND REPLACE 

621
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,245
OBAMACARE. 

622
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,713
ONE SENATOR DECIDED TO PUT THE 

623
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,513
THUMB DOWN LATE IN THE MORNING. 

624
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:44,116
AND THAT WAS NOT A GOOD THING 

625
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,585
WHEN HE PUT THAT THUMB DOWN. 

626
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,252
BUT WE HAVE MADE UP FOR IT. 

627
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:50,455
AND IN MANY WAYS MORE THAN MADE 

628
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,055
UP FOR IT. 

629
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:54,960
BUT THAT WAS A SAD DAY TO ME. 

630
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,360
BUT WE REPELLED AND REPLACED. 

631
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,996
NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT 

632
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,599
ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO BE 

633
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:00,832
BETTER. 

634
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,433
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO. 

635
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:07,472
TODAY WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS 

636
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,341
OF THE PRO-AMERICANA AGENDA. 

637
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,108
AMERICA FIRST. 

638
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,110
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

639
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,510
ALL THOSE HATS. 

640
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,182
GREATEST PHRASE EVER USED IN 

641
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:17,649
POLITICS, I SUSPECT. 

642
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:17,882
RIGHT? 

643
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:18,216
THE GREATEST. 

644
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,050
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

645
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,852
WHAT ARE WE USING IN TWO AND A 

646
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:21,152
HALF YEARS. 

647
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,921
CAN YOU BELIEVE TWO AND A HALF 

648
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:23,154
YEARS. 

649
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:23,421
SO SOON. 

650
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:33,832
YOU KNOW WHAT THE PHRASE IS, 

651
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,633
RIGHT? 

652
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:34,833
HUH? 

653
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,166
THAT'S RIGHT. 

654
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:39,103
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 

655
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:39,971
OF COURSE EXCLAMATION POINT. 

656
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,340
BECAUSE WE CAN'T SAY MAKE 

657
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:41,807
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

658
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,543
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE 

659
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,344
DOING, IT IS VERY SIMPLE. 

660
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,979
IT IS CALLED KEEP AMERICA 

661
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,147
GREAT. 

662
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,349
WE WILL GET YOU NICE HATS. 

663
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,285
MAYBE WE WILL MAKE THEM GREEN 

664
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:57,389
THIS TIME INSTEAD OF RED. 

665
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:57,622
GREEN. 

666
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:58,056
REPRESENTING CASH. 

667
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,258
THIS PLANT WILL MANUFACTURE 

668
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:03,428
STATE OF THE ART LCDs, ADDING 

669
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,831
AN AVERAGE OF $3.4 BILLION TO 

670
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,199
THE STATE'S ECONOMY EVERY 

671
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,866
SINGLE YEAR. 

672
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,334
AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW 

673
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,304
THIS BUT I UNDERSTAND LIFE AND 

674
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,071
I UNDERSTAND POLITICS, I GUESS 

675
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,606
-- OR I WOULDN'T BE HERE IN A 

676
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,208
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 

677
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,542
I MUST HAVE POTENTIAL, RIGHT. 

678
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,879
BECAUSE HERE WE ARE ALL 

679
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:21,380
TOGETHER. 

680
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,015
BUT I ASSUME THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

681
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,784
PROBABLY SAYING NO DEAL IS ANY 

682
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:27,052
GOOD. 

683
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,755
ANY DEAL YOU DO -- YOU KNOW, 

684
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:37,095
THE DEMOCRATS AS HEADED BY 

685
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,397
NANCY PELOSI AND MAXINE WATERS. 

686
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:40,398
THAT IS OUR NEW LEADER. 

687
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:41,900
ANY DEAL YOU MAKE, THEY HAVE NO 

688
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,700
IDEA WHAT THE DEAL IS. 

689
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,503
WE HAD A COUPLE OF THEM 

690
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,871
RECENTLY, A TRADE DEAL AND ONE 

691
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,973
OF THE DEMOCRATS GOT UP, THE 

692
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,406
DEAL DOESN'T WORK. 

693
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:50,308
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW THE DEAL. 

694
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,376
NOBODY EVER TOLD HIM. 

695
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,345
WE DIDN'T KNOW THE DEAL BECAUSE 

696
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,547
WE HADN'T EVEN NEGOTIATED IT 

697
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:55,914
YET. 

698
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,149
BUT HE WAS SAYING THAT'S -- 

699
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,483
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. 

700
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,918
THEY WILL ALWAYS CRITICIZE. 

701
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,486
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT DEALS 

702
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:01,787
EVER. 

703
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,054
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO. 

704
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:04,523
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT 

705
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,624
ANYBODY IS CRITICAL OF IT. 

706
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,559
I DON'T IMAGINE THEY COULD BE. 

707
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:15,066
I KNOW THAT TERRY IS INVESTING 

708
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,201
$10 BILLION IN THE STATE. 

709
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:17,569
$10BILLION. 

710
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:17,869
INCREDIBLE. 

711
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,871
SO EVEN AT THIS EARLY STAGE, 

712
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,774
THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THIS 

713
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:29,080
NEW PLANT ARE BEING FELT IN 60 

714
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,014
OF WISCONSIN'S 72 COUNTIES. 

715
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:30,281
ALREADY. 

716
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:30,615
DON'T WORRY. 

717
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,418
IN ANOTHER THREE WEEKS, IT WILL 

718
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:37,022
BE 72. 

719
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,624
FOXCONN HAS ALREADY CONTRACTED 

720
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,260
27 LOCAL WISCONSIN COMPANIES TO 

721
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,929
BEGIN CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAIN 

722
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:44,296
FACILITY. 

723
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,065
AS BIG AS THIS IS, THIS IS JUST 

724
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,701
A TOY COMPARED TO THE MAIN 

725
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:49,968
FACILITY. 

726
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,204
AND I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT 

727
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:56,708
FOXCONN INTENDS TO BUILD 100% 

728
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,111
OF THE FACTORY WITH BEAUTIFUL 

729
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,948
AMERICAN CONCRETE AND BEAUTIFUL 

730
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:03,681
AMERICAN STEEL MADE RIGHT HERE. 

731
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:06,918
SO IMPORTANT. 

732
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,220
OUR STEEL INDUSTRY, OUR 

733
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,321
ALUMINUM INDUSTRY, OUR SOLAR 

734
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,990
PANEL INDUSTRY, IT IS ALL 

735
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,357
COMING BACK. 

736
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:12,891
COMING BACK FAST. 

737
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,093
ONE OF THE MANY PEOPLE HERE 

738
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:19,631

739
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,266
FROM THIS PLANT IS CECILIA 

740
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:21,533
GRIFFIN. 

741
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,335

JOB IS GETTING TO PUT THESE 

841
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,112
TEAMS TOGETHER. 

842
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,414
IT IS ONE THING TO BUILD THEM. 

843
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,148
IT IS ANALYTICAL. 

844
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,017
WE LOOK AT PICTURES AND WE MAKE 

845
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,785
THEM INTO THE REAL THING IN THE 

846
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,118
REAL WORLD. 

847
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:03,855
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT, I NEED 

848
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,423
CURRENTLY 110 PEOPLE TO HELP ME 

849
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,157
EVERY DAY. 

850
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,992
AND THEY SHOW UP EARLY AND THEY 

851
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:10,061
GO HOME LATE AND WE SPEND TIME 

852
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:10,962
TOGETHER PROBABLY MORE TIME 

853
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,765
TOGETHER THAN WE SPEND WITH OUR 

854
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:14,032
FAMILIES. 

855
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,400
BUT THEY'RE THERE EVERY SINGLE 

856
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,736
DAY AND THEY DO EVERYTHING THAT 

857
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:17,969
WE ASK. 

858
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:22,040
AND WE GET THE JOB DONE ON 

859
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,240
TIME. 

860
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,975
AND THAT'S -- THAT'S THE PART 

861
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:24,775
THAT MAKES IT SPECIAL. 

862
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:28,380
SO WE GET TOGETHER OUT THERE 

863
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,680
EVERY DAY. 

864
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,248
AND WE MAKE SURE TO CARE FOR 

865
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,850
EACH OTHER, TAKE CARE OF EACH 

866
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,083
OTHER. 

867
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,719
WE ACTUALLY TREAT IT LIKE IT IS 

868
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,152
A FAMILY. 

869
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,722
IT IS A DANGEROUS JOB IN SOME 

870
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,089
WAYS. 

871
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,523
WE LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER. 

872
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:42,661
AND I JUST THINK THAT IT'S 

873
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,328
PROBABLY THE BEST THING. 

874
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,829
I HAVE REALLY BEEN DOING THIS 

875
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,399
SINCE I WAS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD. 

876
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,236

00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,036
VERY PROUD OF IT. 

929
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,404
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. 

930
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,540
AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND DO 

931
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:35,873
JUST AS GOOD. 

932
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:38,042
SO WE'RE GOING TO START WORKING 

933
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,176
ON THAT PROCESS. 

934
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:39,677
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED. 

935
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,178
AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO 

936
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:43,281
MAKE YOU VERY PROUD. 

937
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:49,654
SO JUST IN FINISHING, I WANT TO 

938
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,388
SAY THAT TODAY'S GROUND 

939
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,990
BREAKING IS ONLY ONE PART OF 

940
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,892
THE EXCITING STORY PLAYING OUT 

941
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,527
ACROSS OUR NATION, ALL OVER OUR 

942
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:57,095
NATION. 

943
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,030
CHRYSLER IS SHIFTING PRODUCTION 

944
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,497
FROM MEXICO TO MICHIGAN. 

945
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:04,435
TOYOTA AND MAZDA WILL BUILD A 

946
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,235
NEW FACILITY IN ALABAMA. 

947
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:06,036
BEAUTIFUL FACILITY. 

948
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:07,805
AND WE HAVE MANY OTHER 

949
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,840
COMPANIES COMING. 

950
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,740
NOT ONLY THE CAR COMPANIES. 

951
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,042
BUT THIS IS WHERE THE ACTION 

952
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:11,242
IS. 

953
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,177
I GO AROUND AND I SEE THE 

954
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:14,612
LEADERS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES 

955
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,114
AND THEY ALWAYS SAY 

956
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,082
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GREAT 

957
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,484
ECONOMIC SUCCESS THAT YOU'RE 

958
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,684
HAVING IN THE UNITED STATES. 

959
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:23,021
AND WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT IS 

960
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:27,158
ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE OF CHINA. 

961
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,659
AND MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OTHER. 

962
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:31,663
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK WE'VE 

963
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,197
MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS IN THE 

964
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:34,966
LAST YEAR AND A HALF. 

965
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,634
IT HAS PUT US IN THIS POSITION. 

966
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:38,169
AND WE'RE GOING UP. 

967
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,538
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING 

968
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,171
LIKE IT. 

969
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:42,140
WATCH THOSE GPD NUMBERS. 

970
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,310
WE STARTED OFF AT A VERY LOW 

971
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:45,543
NUMBER. 

972
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,645
AND RIGHT NOW WE HIT A 3.2. 

973
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,946
NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE 

974
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:49,413
N FOUR YEARS. 

975
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,749
BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO A 

976
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,017
LOT HIGHER THAN THAT. 

977
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,453
SO YOU WATCH THOSE NUMBERS. 

978
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,456
EACH POINT IS THREE TRILLION 

979
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,858
DOLLARS AND 10 MILLION JOBS. 

980
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:01,325
JUST REMEMBER THAT. 

981
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:02,026
EACH POINT. 

982
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,127
AND WE ALREADY HIT A 3.2. 

983
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,263
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE 

984
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:05,596
SEEING 4s. 

985
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:07,532
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE 

986
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:07,832
SEEING 5s. 

987
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,967
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO 

988
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:10,468
HIGHER THAN THAT. 

989
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,336
BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE SECOND 

990
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:12,804
TERM. 

991
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:13,004
OKAY. 

992
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,373
CAN I HAVE A LITTLE BREAK. 

993
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:17,175
RIGHT? 

994
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:17,508
RIGHT, STEVE? 

995
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:17,875
OUR SECRETARY. 

996
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,546
OUR GREAT SECRETARY OF THE 

997
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:21,813
TREASURY. 

998
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:22,146
RIGHT, STEVE? 

999
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,548
THAT'S MY PREDICTION. 

1000
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,051
I THINK THAT'S YOUR PROJECTION 

1001
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,518
TOO. 

1002
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,018
STEVE MNUCHIN. 

1003
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:28,786
THAT IS HIS PROJECTION. 

1004
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,721
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT, STEVE. 

1005
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:36,261
IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS 

1006
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,496
YEAR, AMERICAN COMPANIES $300 

1007
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,233
BILLION THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER 

1008
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,901
COME BACK TO THIS COUNTRY. 

1009
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,903
IT IS OVERSEAS PROFITS, 

1010
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,938
BRINGING THE MONEY BACK HOME TO 

1011
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,540
OUR COUNTRY WHERE IT BELONGS. 

1012
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,209
I THINK WE WILL HAVE THREE, 

1013
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,910
MAYBE FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS 

1014
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,811
BEFORE THAT WAS OVER. 

1015
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,380
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING THE 

1016
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,582
MONEY BACK FOR A LOT OF 

1017
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:57,949
REASONS. 

1018
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:58,482
NOW THEY'RE COMING BACK. 

1019
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:00,652
IN FACT APPLE AS YOU KNOW TERRY 

1020
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,755
MAKES A LOT OF THE PRODUCT, 

1021
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,188
LAPTOPS, IPHONES. 

1022
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:08,859
MAKES A LOT OF THEM FOR APPLE. 

1023
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:10,428
AND APPLE IS SPENDING $350 

1024
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:10,895
BILLION -- BILLION. 

1025
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:11,529
THERE'S ANOTHER CASE. 

1026
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:15,066
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH 

1027
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:15,399
350 MILLION. 

1028
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:19,003
BUT THEY'RE SPENDING 350 

1029
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:22,506
BILLION ON PLANTS ON BUILDING 

1030
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:23,006
AN INCREDIBLE CAMPUS. 

1031
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:25,843
AND TERRY IS HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 

1032
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,678
WE'RE ALSO RECLAIMING OUR 

1033
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:28,278
COUNTRY'S PROUD MANUFACTURING 

1034
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:28,512
LEGACY. 

1035
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:30,181
THAT'S WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT 

1036
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:34,786
THAT WE OPEN UP OUR STEEL MILLS 

1037
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,053
AGAIN. 

1038
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:39,257
WE NEED THAT FOR PURPOSES OF 

1039
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:39,557
DEFENSE. 

1040
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:45,429
WE NEED THAT FOR PURPOSES OF 

1041
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:45,663
LEGACY. 

1042
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:46,330
WE'RE RESTORING AMERICA'S 

1043
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,031
INDUSTRIAL MIGHT. 

1044
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,566
THANKS TO THE HARDWORKING 

1045
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,969
PATRIOTS LIKE YOU, WE'RE MAKING 

1046

BEFORE. 

1048
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,404
IT IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. 

1049
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,440
VERY SHORTLY IT IS ALL 

1050
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:55,740
HAPPENING. 

1051
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,240
YOU SEE IT HAPPENING.

00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,010

THAT IS OPENING THERE. 

1083
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:00,771
FOXCONN OF COURSE IS A
