MISCALCULATION. Melissa: GREG PALKOT IS LIVE IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA, WITH THE LATEST. GREG? Greg: MELISSA, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FOLKS HERE IN THIS REGION ARE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY THE BACK-AND-FORTH ABOUT A POSSIBLE SUMMIT BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. THEY HAVE A HUGE STAKE IN IT ALL. WE HEARD FROM THE CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY ON FRIDAY. THEY SAY THEY HOPE THE U.S. AND THE NORTH KOREA STAY PATIENT AND MEET EACH OTHER HALFWAY. AND PRESS AHEAD WITH DENUCLEARIZATION ON THE PENINSULA. REMEMBER, PRESIDENT TRUMP FEARED THAT CHINESE PRESIDENT XI GOT IN THE EAR OF KIM JONG UN AND CHANGED HIS TUNE. WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER ABE TODAY. HE SAID ABOUT A POSSIBLE CANCELLATION OF THE SUMMIT THAT IT WAS REGRETTABLE BUT THAT HE RESPECTED AND SUPPORTED THE DECISION. MOST IMPORTANT AGAIN TO GET RID OF THE NUKES FROM NORTH REMEMBER ABE IS A HUGE ALLY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. FOR KIM JONG UN, WE SAW HIM TODAY RIDING A TRAIN. AT LEAST STATE MEDIA PRESENTED IMAGES OF THAT. HIS REGIME, REMEMBER, EARLY ON FRIDAY SAID THAT THEY WOULD MEET THE U.S. FACE TO FACE, ANY TIME, ANYPLACE. THIS IS COMING AFTER THE REBUKE FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT IN SEOUL HAVE SO MUCH INVESTED. THEY WANT THE SUMMIT TO BE RESURRECTED. AS FOR THAT NUKE SITE EVENT, REMEMBER THAT ONE ON THURSDAY? SUPPOSED TO BE THE BIG NEWS? IT GOT LOST IN ALL THE EVENTS OF THURSDAY. WE HAVE NEW IMAGES FROM THE SISTER NETWORK IN U.K., "SKY NEWS." THEY WERE ONE OF THE TEAMS INVITED TO THE SITE SHOWING MASSIVE BLAST AT THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY AREA, TUNNELS AND PORTALS USED IN PAST NUCLEAR TEST. HITCH IS AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING, AS THE SKY COLLEAGUES PRESSED NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS ON THE GROUND ABOUT, THERE WERE NO INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS OR EXPERTS. THE REPORTERS COULD EXAMINE THE AFTERMATH, THEY COULD SEE WHAT WAS LEFT BUT THEY COULDN'T CONFIRM THE CLAIMS OF THE REGIME. REMEMBER, A COUPLE HOURS AFTER THIS HAPPENED, PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED OFF THE SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE. OR MAYBE HE DIDN'T.
