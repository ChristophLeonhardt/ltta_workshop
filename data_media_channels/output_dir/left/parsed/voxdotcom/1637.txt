god is good price at the pump continues
to go up gas prices have jumped 10 cents
over the past two weeks gas is $3.99 so
this dumb getting around it's on e4
empty like my wallet in a couple of
minutes I don't even need it
good news gas prices at their lowest in
the last three months and it's in part
because of a dip in oil prices when a
gas 308 tho dollars dansgame oh is so
good to me
268 holy crap this is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen in my life to the
federal government estimates that if
prices remained this slow us drivers
will save an additional five hundred and
fifty dollars next year I just filled my
tank up about $30
low gas prices spoiled me with 177 now

dollar ninety three for down the can
Singh crazy
