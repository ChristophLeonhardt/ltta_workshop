00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:47,027
NERVOUSNESS.

37
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:54,568
THAT CHARLES WOULD ATTACK --

38
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:56,937
HE WOULD SORT OF PREATTACK

39
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:58,939
ALL OF THE WEAK BOYS IN THE

40
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,409

APART.

42
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,744
>> HE FITS INTO A TRADITION

43
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,846
IF YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE

44
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,681
LIKE BO BUCKLEY AND WHAT BO

NEW REPUBLIC WRITER.

00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:21,195
IT WAS KRAUTHAMMER THE WORD

55
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:24,532
SMITH WHO COINED THE BUSH

56
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:25,566
DERANGEMENT SIN DRONEL.

57
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:28,636
AND KRAUTHAMMER WHO DEFINED

58
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:29,203
REAGAN FOREIGN POLICY.

59
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:31,038
>> HE INVENTED THE REAGAN

60
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:32,173
DOCTRINE NOT REAGAN.

61
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:35,876
IT CODIFIED WHEN A LOT OF

62
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:36,811
SORT OF FEELINGS THAT PEOPLE

63
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:37,812
ON THE RIGHT HAD.

64
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:38,979
>> KRAUTHAMMER TOOK PLENTY

65
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,081
OF FLACK FOR HIS STEADFAST

66
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:41,916
SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQ WAR.

67
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,584
AND WAS VERY TOUGH ON

68
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:44,785
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

69
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:46,654
YET, HE WAS EQUALLY

70
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:47,388
COMFORTABLE TAKING SWIPES AT

71
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:47,888
HILLARY CLINTON.

72
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:49,323
>> WHAT SHE NEEDS ARE LYING

73
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:50,858
LESSONS FROM HER HUSBAND WHO

74
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,626
IS ONE OF THE GREAT LIARS OF

75
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:53,260
ALL TIME.

76
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,962
TO DO IT WITH A SMILE AND

77
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:55,262
CHARM.

78
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:56,397
>> AND AT DONALD TRUMP.

79
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:58,165
>> PRESIDENTS DON'T TALK

80
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:58,866
LIKE THIS.

81
00:01:58,866 --> 00:01:59,900
THEY NEVER HAVE.

82
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,135
THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE

83
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:04,271
WHEN YOU ARE LIVING IN A

84
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,539
BANANA REPUBLIC.

85
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,475
>> HE PRAISED PRESIDENT

86
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:08,642
TRUMP AS WELL.

87
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,678
THE GAME FOR HIM WAS

88
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:11,912
PHILOSOPHICAL NOT PARTISAN.

89
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,380
HIS CONSERVATISM WAS NEVER

90
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,682
ABOUT GETTING REPUBLICANS

91
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:15,015
ELECTED.

92
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:16,550
HE RANGED WIDELY AS A WRITER

93
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,052
FROM HIS BELOVED BASEBALL TO

94
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:19,553
A CHEEKY COLUMN CALLED IN

95
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,222
DEFENSE OF THE F WORKED.

96
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:22,389
HE DICTATED HIS COLUMNS

97
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,757
BECAUSE HE WAS UNABLE TO

98
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,392
TYPE BUT RARELY SPOKE OF HIS

99
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:25,793
DISABILITY.

100
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,595
>> YOU ARE BY TRAYING YOUR

101
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:28,762
WHOLE LIFE IF YOU DON'T SAY

102
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:29,763
WHAT YOU THINK AND YOU DON'T

103
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:32,399
SAY IT HONESTLY AND BLUNTLY.

104
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,868
>> CHARLES COULD BE BLUNT,

105
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,636
BUT HE WAS NEVER NASTY.

106
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:37,771
A MARKED CONTRAST TO TODAY'S

107
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,940
ANGRY OUTRAGE, NAME-CALLING

108
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,376
BRAND OF PUNDIT TRI.

109
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,811
HE WAS TRAINED AS A MEDICAL

110
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:47,581
DOCTOR BUT HE USED A SCALPEL

111
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,749
NOT A SLEDGE HAMMER.

112
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,284
IN THAT SENSE, BRET, HE

113
00:02:50,284 --> 00:02:51,785
LIFTED EVERYONE'S GAME.

114
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:52,219
>> Bret: YEAH.

115
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:52,786
HE REALLY DID.

116
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:53,954
HE IS MISSED.

117
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:54,655

LEGACY.

126
00:03:07,868 --> 00:00:00,000
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER WAS 68.
