THIS IS AN AMUSING STORY,
BECAUSE SOMEONE THOUGHT DONALD
TRUMP WASN'T LYING TO THEM.
 IN THIS CASE IT
HAPPENS TO BE THE AUSTRALIAN
GOVERNMENT, A WHILE AGO HE MADE
A PROMISE TO THEM AND NOW COME
TO FIND OUT HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.
NO, REALLY?
BUT THEY ARE
GENUINELY SURPRISED, WHICH
AMUSES ME.
HUFF POST
REPORTING HERE --
THEY ARE ACCUSING HIM OF THAT
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE, LET'S
GIVE YOU 
THE 
DETAILS --
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
TIMES I HAVE TO SAY THIS --
TRUMP DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING HE
SAYS.
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS
FOR THIS.
ONE IS HE'S A
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR, HE WILL TELL
YOU ONE THING IN ONE MINUTE,
FORGET A YEAR LATER, A MINUTE
LATER HE WILL TELL YOU THE
OPPOSITE.
JUST YESTERDAY I DID A
STORY ON THE SHOW ABOUT HOW HE
CONTRADICTED HIMSELF WITHIN THE
SAME TWEET.
SECOND OF ALL, HE
DOESN'T HAVE ANY PHILOSOPHY OR
PRINCIPLES.
SO WHAT IS HIS
GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY ON ALUMINUM
TARIFFS?
HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
SO
WHEN HE PROMISED TO THEM THAT HE
WOULD EXEMPT AUSTRALIA, WHAT WAS
THAT BASED ON?
WASN'T BASED ON A
PRINCIPLE OF WE WILL EXAMINE
ALLIES BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S
BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY OR BETTER
FOR FOREIGN POLICY, AND AMONG
THE ALLIES WILL BE AUSTRALIA,
THE U.K., ETC.?
NO, HE DIDN'T
PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO IT.
YOU
KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S DUMB.
HE
DIDN'T THINK IF I GIVE AUSTRALIA
AN EXEMPTION I MIGHT HAVE TO
GIVE NEW ZEALAND ONE, IS THAT
GOING TO BE BASED ON REGIONS OR
ON ALLIES, HOW WILL I MAKE THOSE
DECISIONS?
NO, TURNBULL PROBABLY
GAVE HIM A COMPLIMENT, SAID HEY
MR.
PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE AWFULLY
LARGE HANDS, AND HE SAID THAT'S
IT, YOU ARE EXEMPT FROM THE
TARIFFS.
AND A YEAR LATER YOU
THINK IS GOING TO LISTEN TO
THAT?
NO, SOMEONE ELSE WILL COME
IN THE ROOM AND TELL HIM HE HAS
LARGE HANDS SO AUSTRALIA IS OUT.
NO ONE IS GETTING AN EXEMPT AND.
COMPANIES MIGHT, WHICH WILL LEAD
TO TERRIBLE CORRUPTION AS THEY
TRY TO CONVINCE THE GOVERNMENT
TO GIVE THEM EXEMPTIONS ONE BY
ONE IN A SYSTEM OF
INSTITUTIONALIZED CRONY
CAPITALISM, BUT THERE ARE NO
COUNTRYWIDE EXEMPTIONS, TRUMP IS
ALWAYS DIDN'T MEAN IT, WAS LYING
TO YOU, DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THE HELL HE WAS SAYING.
SO TOM
MCILROY SAYS ON TWITTER HERE --
YES, AND FACT AUSTRALIA, YOU
HAVE BEEN DUDDED, AS HAVE ALL OF
US.
THE AUSTRALIAN TRADE
MINISTER SAYS --
MMM.
I DO DECLARE, THAT ONE
STUNG.
IS DONALD TRUMP AND HIS
ADMINISTRATION TRUSTWORTHY?
OF
COURSE NOT, DON'T BE
PREPOSTEROUS.
AND I LIKE HOW
THEY GOT THEIR FEELINGS HURT.
THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT FROM
DAY ONE.
