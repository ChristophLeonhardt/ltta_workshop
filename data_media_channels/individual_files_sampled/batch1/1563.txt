in the aftermath of the killing of Jamaal keshavjee at the hands of Saudi government agents tech companies and their executives are distancing themselves from Saudi investment how each one of them makes that decision on their own I think is probably driven very much by their own moral conscience but also their understanding that other people are looking at them in their formal leadership positions for cues about what to do right now several tech leaders have already bailed out of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman investment conference including Google cloud CEO Diane Greene AOL founder Steve Case and uber CEO Daraa kasra shahe who said he was very troubled by reports of khashoggi g's death customer sakis public comments were seen as significant because the Saudi wealth fund holds a three and a half billion dollar stake in the ride hailing app Saudi Arabia has also invested heavily in Tesla Motors doordash the workspace company we work and others much of the Saudi money is funneled through the Japanese bank Softbank the world's largest investment fund so far Saudi Arabia has put forty five billion dollars into soft banks so-called vision funds and the crown prince says he'd like to double that amount soft banks chief Masayoshi Son apparently still plans to attend the Saudi investment conference even as tech companies recoil from the Saudis on ethical grounds it will be difficult if not financially impossible to unravel their Saudi ties a complex tangle of contracts stock preferences and legal obligations Thai companies hands in such matters ordinarily companies and financial institutions follow the lead of their governments but President Donald Trump's response to the keshavjee killing has been tepid and vacillating leaving corporations to find their own way in some ways this case is providing an opportunity for companies to really provide some moral leadership maybe at a time when they're not seeing or experiencing what they'd like to see from leadership in other sectors Silicon Valley corporations face a dilemma choosing between an ethical response to a shocking crime and the abundant funding that makes the tech industry flourish Rob Reynolds al-jazeera San Carlos California
