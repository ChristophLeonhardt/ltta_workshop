and joining us now live via Skype is Maxime Bernie the founder of the People's Party welcome back to the program it's nice to have you again thank you I'm very pleased to be with you well a lot has happened since we last spoke I think the last time we interviewed you was when you were running for the leadership of the Conservative Party and you missed that just by less than a percent tell me about your decision to break away from the Conservative Party and start the People's Party why didn't you stay in and try and fight for change from within and maybe be there if Andrew Shearer fails in the next election how come you decide to break away yeah I try it's a great question and I tried to pushed all right years a year after the leadership as you know I didn't win with 49% of the vote but at the end the grassroot people they like our bold ideas and what we what we want for the future of this country faison for principled individual freedom personal responsibility fairness and respect so after the leadership I try to have that be part of the platform of Party of Canada for the next election but I was not successful and I had a conversation a phone conversation we can do 10 days before I resign and he told me that the party was not that didn't want to take any of our ideas and so for the next third the next campaign for the next platform and in 2019 and after that you know I had two choices to stay in politics and or to go back to the private sector but I decided to stay in politics and fight for what I believe I wasn't able to see myself and running for the Conservative Party of Canada on a platform that I don't believe so we had the platform and so I decided to start the party and up to now it's doing very well now you outline the four principles of your party but those words are pretty general act freedom things like that I think a lot of our viewers like you they support you they love your style they love your principled stand but they also really want to win they really want to beat Justin Trudeau and and a lot of our viewers remember the great efforts to unite the right can I ask you on behalf of our viewers who like you but are skeptical of this decision those four principles you talked about I bet if Andrew Shearer were right here and of course he isn't right here because he refuses to talk to the rebels he would say he agrees with those four principles what's been the dairy cartel what are the specific differences between your People's Party and the Conservative Party because I can name that dairy cartel I think it's important one but what are the other differences but you know we want to have a debate on the equalization formula I think it's important for Canada it's important for everybody you know that formula is on fear and it is unfair also for provinces who are receiving money because if there is no incentive for these provinces to develop their own natural resources so I'm the only politician who speak about that and the only politician speak about getting rid of the corporate welfare and unserious when I was thinking about that it is not a slogan we want to be sure to abolish to around 5 billion dollars that the federal government is giving to big operation we want to stop that and Nord taxes for every single entrepreneur in this country we think that it is not fair to tax a small business entrepreneur in Calgary and using their money that money to give that to a big corporation like GM and poor body so we are very serious about that that's and also we want to have a debate about the L care system in our country we want to respect the Constitution we want to be sure that everybody would be all to have good good health care services by first of all stopping to tax Canadians and giving that money to provinces we want to lower the tax taxes at the federal level and let the province tax for their own responsibilities like health care so we and and provinces will have an incentive to develop a new way to to offer that services to their people so with maybe more private and other ways like in other country like like in France like in Sweden like in other European country where they have a better system that in Canada so politicians are free to have this kind of discussion so that's a big difference between our party and the other one were not afraid to have debate about that and and you know we will we will take the time to explain our policies to Canadians and and that's why we will be able to have support and the other part of your question was about being able to to be the alternative and I think we would be able to be the alternative because first of all we have a lot of support from former Conservative were coming with us but also from people who voted lipof said before people who voted for paul nafta and jean katie a couple of years ago because they believe in a balanced budget and lower taxes so that's in our plan to balance the budget in two years they are welcome in our party because they cannot see themselves in the Liberal Party of Canada right now and I had some people who voted MVP they said Maxine I want to join your party and you with you because you can't want to get rid of corporate welfare and you want to punish the cartel of supply management that is a regressive tax on the poor so we can attract these kind of people but also thirty percent of Canadian didn't vote at the resurrection because they don't believe in pollination anymore so I think we can have some of these people also so we have to prove - I have to prove to my former conservative colleagues that we will be the alternative and I think it's starting very well we're on the pool right now just in the beginning we just have to increase that and I can tell you that in couple of months from now we will be the alternative and if you want to beat the - oh gosh people will have to vote for us and not friend who she now it's interesting I was making notes as you talked about equalization reform corporate welfare reform health care a lot of those ideas remind me of the early days of the Conservative Party or more to the point the reform party in the Canadian Alliance it sounds to me like you're suggesting that the today's Conservative Party under Anders here is really a party of the establishment and not a party of insurgent ideas is that a fair assessment of your view absolutely it's a fair assessment they're liberal life you know that's why they don't have any idea they don't want to discuss either reform because they need to do pooling and focus group and after that they will come with a policy and they try to please everybody and in politics when you try to please everybody you don't please everybody so you know we believe in real conservative reform and that's what we want to do and that would be the only way for having a small gov a smaller government Ottawa and a government that will respect the people so that's a big difference between us and the liberal and the conservative and you're right the establishment at the conservative they they don't want to open these debate but Canadians they're ready for it and they know if we want to have a freer in a more prosperous country we'll need to have these kind of reform well let me ask you about one more area of politics because you know corporate welfare that should be pretty easy for any conservative to support reforms and and health care is no longer the third rail of politics that it was maybe 15 years ago because people know it's not working but there is one area of politics that I think the federal conservatives and almost everyone else in the country especially in the media is terrified to talk about and at least in English Canada and that is open borders immigration illegal immigrants and especially the Islamic nature and effect of some of these migrants whether it's the jab or the full face obscuring niqab in public or in courts these are subjects that I think people want to talk about but if they even ask basic questions or raise concerns they're called racist or whatnot now you've engaged in some of these conversations on Twitter is that part of your People's Party as well do you have views on immigration multiculturalism and integration and assimilation for sure it is part of our platform and I tweeted about that couple of days ago and you know we need we need to this country has been built with immigrants and immigrants that they share the Western civilization values and that's very important so I I don't want our country to be like in France actually right now in Europe where they have challenges with the integration of our new immigrants we don't want that in Canada so that's that is why we must have a debate about immigration and I will turn for a negation but I'm open with immigrants that will come here like the one in the past came here to share our Canadian values and our culture they will come to our country I want them to be able to have a job I want them to be more 20 greater society so that's why we need to have a debate on immigration but the other parties they don't want to have a debate about that you know and I think it's time to have this kind of debate you know my last interview with Andrew Shearer and I think it's why he never came back I asked him about some of the Syrian migrants and I said do you have do you have any views on that he said well we need to do security background checks I said that's true but a lot of things won't show up in a security background check and someone from Syria questions about cultural compatibility the Equality of men and women the treatment of minorities the separation of mosque and state I asked Andrew Shearer if he felt there ought to be any cultural fit test so not just a background police check obviously and he didn't answer me do you believe that we should have a test to make sure someone embraces Canadian value like the separation of mosque and state or the Equality of men and women I I couldn't get an answer out of Andrew sheered do you feel more confident on that question but first of all as you know killing each leadership campaign for the Conservative Party of Canada raised that issue and she said that we need a test so I'm open for ideas I don't know how we will we will be sure that these people that are coming here are sharing our values and our principle Western society values and principle so is it that by a test or another means I don't know I'm open for its suggestion somebody told me Maxine if you ask for a test they will tell you what you want to hear and it would be very difficult so I'm open to find the best way to be sure that people who are coming in this country are coming for the real reason and are coming because they want to be in a country that is free that it respect the rule of law the equality between men and women the distinction between the church and politics so that's important for us and I don't know what would be the best way to be sure that these people are coming because they share our values and they want to be in a freer country but what happen in the past if you look at the past 65 years 70 years people they were coming here and they were sharing our values so maybe we need to improve our system but we don't need to throw everything out and start from the beginning what we did couple of years ago the point system it's a good system if you we must improve it but I don't have the solution about it right now and I'm open that's why I'm doing this debate and I'm looking for for solution or ideas for from Canadians about it thank you I have just one more question on this and again even if you don't have a concrete answer just your the way you're thinking about it or your process is is useful to me I know that Justin Trudeau and Ahmed Hassan the immigration minister have talked about increasing the number of immigrants to Canada to 300,000 a year I've also seen regular opinion polls that have gotten sharper against that less than 10 percent of Canadians including according to the government's own polls support an increase do you have any thoughts on the actual number should it be where it is now around 250 should it increased to 300 should it be restricted Jim any views on that yes yes first of all you're right that the true government they want to ask we hundred and ten thousand people a year new Canadians then we'll increase that to three hundred and forty thousand a year in two years from now and they receive a report the Barton report and that report is asking for going up to four hundred and fifty thousand a year so what I want I want us to go back on the average that we had the average of immigrants that we had under Stephen Harper for the last the last ten years that we were in power that the conservative were in power so it's about two hundred and fifty thousand a year so I think we must go back to that number and being sure to integrate these people so that's my goal and the only politician who has a number all the other one the other one are afraid to have a number so around two hundred and fifty thousand a year I think it would be a good start and you know I'm in line with 49 percent of Canadians that they think that there's too much immigration in our country so you know these people I think they're right so I'm not afraid to say a number thank you for answering those policy questions I'd like to shift gears I'm grateful for your time I want to cover two more subjects with you I want to talk about two provincial election campaigns and ask your opinion about shifting politics and then I want to finish up briefly on the CBC because I know you've just put out a new statement on the subject but let me talk about the election a couple days ago in New Brunswick that the traditional parties the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals they each got about thirty percent of the vote but third parties got about thirty percent of the vote there there was the NDP they only got five percent they were the Green party got about 12% and there's a new party called let me get this right the People's Alliance which sounds similar to your People's Party it's right-of-center it has new ideas it's against corporate welfare it actually sounded very similar to you guys and they won the balance of power and they got I think 13% of the vote do you do you think that these old routines and customs that you either vote a Tory liberal Tory liberal give I was surprised by the news there have you been following that do you know anything about this third party the People's Alliance what do you take on that but first of all I didn't follow in either of the election over there but you know I started resolved and for me it's an indication that people are you know are fed up with the old parties that are saying almost the same thing and they're afraid to and we'll debate but the most important they want the use of people's money when I'm saying they the old parties they're using the people money to buy votes with poor special interest group they're doing that with the the cartel of supply management at the federal level so and that way of doing politics taxing people's and that people and actually not giving that money to a special interest group or having their support I think people are fed up with that and that's not the way that we would do politics we will we are doing politics for all Canadians for the people of our country that's why we are calling our party the People's Party of Canada so I think people it's it's a sign in New Brunswick and and for us it's looking very good because we are at or around 12:00 or son in the pool right now after three weeks and we we can we can just increase and I hope we will and will show to everybody that would be the right the right alternative the alternative in 2019 I want to shift to Quebec provincial election and I'm not expecting you to endorse one party or the other although if you want to let me know your thinking on that I find it fascinating because I think as an outsider and I don't speak very good friends so I I don't have a lot of information but it looks to me like Quebec has more this conversations about some of the cultural issues because Quebec has has their French identity that they're trying to keep a hold of so they think about it they talk about it they're worried about it some people would say Quebec was the first ethnic nationalist jurisdiction in North America in a way what do you make about the discussions in that campaign and what do you make of the rise of the coalition Avenir Quebec are they are they a like-minded party to you do they share some views I'd like your thoughts and I'm not looking for you to weigh in to that election although feel free I just want you to help teach the rest of the country what's going on there and can it apply to the federal scene yeah I don't want to interfere in provincial jurisdiction but what I can say the the coalition the currency live near Quebec the Catholic Coalition there their time in the poll right now with the liberal and we don't know what will happen in a week for now but yes you're right they opened a discussion about immigration and they're the only party who who is saying right now in Quebec that we must have a little bit less immigration and I think chemicals are used to that debate I think in English Canada we are having and I'm starting that the day also so the Coalition it's a kind of a right-wing party but for me being a right-wing in Quebec it's a it's a little bit a kind of a socialist party also I don't know what will happen but at least we have some discussion in Quebec about immigration and it's going very well nobody saying that the leader of like guy is a racist nobody is saying that and is having that know that open discussion so I hope that we can have that open discussion also in in Canada and and I'm starting that debate right now yeah I'm very jealous because it seems like even if the mainstream media disagrees with the CAC body and their leader they at least hear him out and report what he says and yeah they understand it's a legit even if they disagree with him they at least acknowledge it's legitimate position I'm jealous because I don't see that in English Canada do you agree that English Canada doesn't yet have the courage to have that same conversation but what I'm saying it's the mainstream media right I think they're they are not fair when we when we speak about that but you know people the credibility of journalists right now it is it is not as I I did was 10 years ago and people they can have their news you know you're very popular Ezra and people like to hear what you are saying and there's other maybe other social media and that's what I want you know we want to do we want to appear to the intelligence of people and and when the main history media they were saying Maxime is a populist politician I said maybe yes but I'm a smart populist politician because we have various policies and we bring something on the table for adding ring real debate that would be great for this country right why that's a very good point you make is that I think English Canadians are ready for that conversation but not the English Canadian media which leads me to my last series of questions and I thank you again for your time but I've I've watched you very carefully over the last month as so many Canadians have and one of I'll be honest one of my favorite things has been how you have been sparring with the mainstream media especially with the state broadcaster and I want to play a a couple of clips and you you surely know the ones I'm talking about when you write before you started the People's Party the CBC did a a hit piece on you and it was hosted by rosemary Barton there was another journalist involved let me play a very short clip and then I'm gonna read a tweet by rosemary Barton so let me just remind our viewers what I'm talking about I know you know Maxine yeah and then I'll like your feedback on this so here's a short clip from a CBC attack on you that tries to link you to a Ku Klux Klan protest in in Charlottesville take a look also significant is the timing Bernier chose to send his messages on the first anniversary of the riots in Charlottesville Virginia a milestone for people who believe whites are under some kind of cultural attack we did reach out to Maxine Bernier today to see if he'd talk rosy but he didn't respond just an absolutely insane non sequitur they're talking about you in Canada and they cook up this conspiracy theory that you're setting your timing based on something that happened in Charlottesville Virginia let me call you for your response in one second but I want to show just very quickly the tweets that were exchanged between you and rosemary Parton you wrote on Twitter and this is on August 16th you wrote just saw this report which implies a timing between my tweets last Sunday and some violent demonstration in the US how do you know that I chose to send my messages on the first anniversary of the riots in Strongsville this is despicable fake news and then rosemary Barton wrote back how do we know you didn't time to consign with that anniversary given you won't give any interviews to anyone about anything you tweet how about you answer some questions and defend your position in front of people then we can talk about what is fake thanks for watching and then you've wrote back they're just gonna go a couple more here you said whether or not I give interviews your job is to report facts not unfounded and calumny as speculation you admit you have no idea if there was a connection I tweet almost every day and was not even aware of this event in the US you were biased unprofessional and in the last comment by Rosamund Barton any politician worth his salt would have known of that anniversary I don't care what you tweet I do care that you won't answer questions about I report facts based on what people say and tweet the interview request stands and we can clear this all up anytime you like now I wrote I said that in my own dramatic voice Maxine but I have to say the mask fell off Rosario Barton for a moment and we saw her true nature as a radical partisan not as a pretend neutral journalist I was shocked by that exchange what do you think of it now that a month has passed it is crazy you know and yes you're right she was a radical partisan and that's a smear job that they tried to do and you know for me the CBC it's funded by us by people's money by Canadians and there's no place for that at the CBC if they want to your left is the partisan they can go on at the private sector and work for a but not work for our broadcaster but not at the CBC so that's why I proposed doing the leadership campaign a big reform of the CBC cutting their budget and asking the CBC to be like the PDS in the state and people who want to give money to a CBC would be able to do that and taxpayers won't be forced to give clean money to the CBC so it's a I was very disappointed the CBC when that happened well you are the first Member of Parliament that I can remember to in a any serious fashion challenge the CBC that's another thing that I think the Conservative Party of Andrew Shearer is afraid of I think they're afraid of talking about cultural issues and I think they're terrified of offending the media party but I think the CBC Maxime after that interview with you I think they doubled down let me show you this quick clip of Paul wells he's from I think he's still with McLane's if they're still around and and he wasn't just attacking you now he was mocking anyone who supports you look at this quick clip look there's no part of his stance on immigration and identity that his libertarian he wants to lead a libertarian party and he else wants to lead an anti-immigrant party his supporters on Twitter seemed to be that tiny Venn intersection of people who think it's great that Donald Trump is the President of the United States and people who think that Maxine Bernier would be like Donald Trump you you cannot have been paying much attention to max Bernie over the last 20 years to entertain that fantasy very far so basically his voter base right now is the stupidest people on Twitter and so we'll see how far that gets him no comment you know it's it's one thing for him to disagree with you that's fine it's another thing for him even to insult you and I suppose that's the price of politician pays but I think this the sneering scoffing at grassroots taxpayers and citizens and and the laughing at his own scoffing and and the other host they're saying well no comment I I don't think the CBC knows what they look like to ordinary people I think that they look imperious and condescending and frankly Maxime if the CBC were to do that every single day I think your support would grow just based on anger against the CBC you know you have to yeah like I said during a press conference I said when I gonna see when I will see a fake news I will call it a fake new and and Rosie that was fake news and the CBC if they are doing there that they are not helping themselves you know if people in the in their Tower in Montreal Toronto and Vancouver and I think other journalists who are dodging eyes who are working for a CBC and long turn in in the region they maybe not like that and they may be not proud of these people at the working with the CDC and not being a not being fair with everybody I want to ask you just one last question because you've stayed very long with us and I know you have many things to do but it is one last question about this using the CBC as an example but I think it goes to a concept called D platforming and I'm not sure what the French term for that is that's not debating your opponents that's trying to marginalize them ban them censor them and it's just I want to show you and you know what I'm talking about this is Wendy Ansley who used to be very prestigious at the CBC she used to be an anchor a newsreader I think she was well-regarded she didn't have particularly strong opinions but she has this new obscure show on Sundays that's really a conspiracy theory show from the left and they took a run at you saying you know asking if you're funded by the Koch brothers which of course would be illegal it's such a bizarre question it was a series of strange accusations but I want to show you something really weird because it references me actually and it I just I just want to play it our viewers probably know what I'm talking about I'd like your take on the new leftist approach of deep platforming and marginalizing opponents take a look at this but I but I do wonder if you've noticed that rebel media for example does seem to be fond of you it's been accused of course of being supportive of white supremacist views as relevant they have a million subscribers on YouTube hundred fifty thousand followers on on on Facebook do you want his support do you want his audience you know I want people who believe in our ideas and it can be people who are watching this show right now people were watching the Israel of it and the rebel rebel it can be people who are watching raju canada i you know by the way max you might just want to tell you i'm not a white supremacist I'm Jewish in fact our staff is of every race and background it's so weird she would say that and that sort of came out of the blue like you weren't talking about the rebel I you and I actually aren't even that close I mean I do like you but we we've actually had criticisms from our viewers that we haven't talked about you enough so I don't even know what she's talking about there I thought that was an attempt by the CBC to tell you who you should and shouldn't meet with who you should and shouldn't talk with the fact that we're a competitor of sorts to them makes it even more craven but I think it's weird that it's an acceptable line of questioning don't talk to him don't meet with them for a journalist to say that what do you make of that you know a because you're so good is right and you know you're a real competition for them and I think they're afraid a little bit but I don't know why out there politician are not going on your show I don't know why and Russia is not going on your show we know who you are you are a credible a proud Canadians and you can be proud of what you're doing right now you know it's a it's a news broadcaster you are all and uh and you have good guess and good people working with you and yes from different backgrounds you can be proud of that and and you know I said to the CBC at that time if I receive an invitation I will look at it and as you know I received the invitation and I'm with you and I'm very proud to be with you and you're doing a good job I know that sometimes you'll be against me as a politician on ideas and the other time you'd be for it or not but that's your job to do that and I appreciate that well thanks very much I appreciate the compliments I actually wasn't fishing for a conflict but it was nice of you to offer it I think you're right i mean we have criticized you i i personally said i would have wished for you to stay within the conservative party and I gave my reasons but you didn't and so we're gonna cover you as the news and you can say what you want to our people but I just thought it was odd that the it feels like there's a little club a little clique both in politics and in the media and you're not allowed to deviate from that little clique and you have done both maxime you've started your own party and you talk to rough rough hewn characters like like me and the rebels so you've you've broken two rules in Ottawa I am grateful for your time today and we've covered a lot of ground is there any other message that you would send to our viewers not because I am gonna email this video out to our people because I think they'll find a lot of it interesting they won't agree with all of it but if you had one last message to say that our viewers especially conservatives who feel like you should have stayed in the tent what would your sales pitch be to them after all our discussion if someone's paying attention now what would you say to them to close the deal but first of all I just want to say to you that for mere political correctness it is finished and we have to say what we believe and what I'm saying to the conservative who are staying within Russia right now and they're not really to be a part of our party just watch us and you know look at our platform readout platform and you'll see that we are the real alternative the real conservative alternative for this country and I hope that we'll be able to have your support in a near future and if you want to know what we believe in go on the website of the People's Party of Canada that see you have the platform and you'll be able to be a funding members also until the first of November so be part of history come with us and and all together will make this country great again well thank you very much Maxime Bernier founder the People's Party I've really enjoyed our conversation and I think you've given our viewers a lot to think about and hey I am glad that you come on the rebel because we are part of the national conversation just as much as well as Mansley is and I appreciate you taking the time with our viewers all the best to you sir thank you thank you bye bye well there you have it Maxime Bernier what do you think of that interview let me know send me an email to ezra at the rebel dog
