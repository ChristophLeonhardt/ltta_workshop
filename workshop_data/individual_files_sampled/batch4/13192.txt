okay so let's go back to these myths so myth number one the wage gap which you mentioned this is used by virtually every feminist scholar to suggest that America has some sort of superstructure of patriarchy what are the real facts about the wage gap does it exist and if so to what extent there is a gap of about 20 cents if you look at all men and all women working full time you will find this gap however it doesn't take into account relevant factors that offended you major in in college what profession are you in how many hours do you work per week when you do these controls the wage gap begins to narrow and in some studies it vanishes so if you look at majors college majors you will make more money on average if you go into I don't know petroleum engineering or naval architecture or metallurgy apparently make money after the PhD in metallurgy but if you go into early childhood education Social Work or women's studies MIT not as much so that counts and oh you know then we look well who majors in petroleum engineering it's mostly men I knew majors in early childhood education mostly women so that is not you know you have to take into account these relevant factors and what I see in study after study is they either don't do it or they play a little game like the American Association of University Women they will say oh yes it's true when you take relevant you know factors into control it narrows but there's still a gap and then they insist but of you know they'll say 12 censor $0.15 but but they don't take all of the relevant factors because there probably took 20 or 25 things I mean look at things like the danger of a job if you look at the the death gap it's almost all men I think it's 94 percent of fatalities in the workplace are men Labor Department data and every year you know so we've got about 5,000 people who died in the workplace almost all men so that's another thing they never look at the workplace is a totality what jobs are people doing and the gritty dangerous jobs you know have you've seen a woman like as a roofer or if you're in a high-rise building and there's some guy out there it's always the guy rushing the windows and you know so there's a you do get a pay premium for a danger you do get a pay premium for working odd hours or strange hours now when I debate them they'll say yes okay fine you're right but it's still discrimination because why is it that men take those jobs and women take their job so why are women's jobs degraded and so forth well that's an interesting question but they've now changed the focus of the argument because we're not talking about equal pay for equal work we're now talking about they sort of want comparable pay for similar work or you know or they want the society to you know do something about the fact that women do I mean the main reason women earn less is that when women have kids they tend to withdraw or you know work less and when men have kids they work more so they'll say well why is that that's sexism well again we're no longer talking about employers and we're no while are we talking about you know a wage gap that's because some evil employers are deliberately paying men more it's they change the ground but even when you go there and ask why do people do what they do and you know is it a sex role sort of thing that's a different set of arguments but even their their arguments are not persuasive because if I look at the patriarchy and say okay that's my hypothesis that we were we do what we do because we've all been conditioned under patriarchy and then I see the United States is less patriarchal then it's ever been women are constantly encouraged to do all sorts of things in schools little kids are encouraged to play with all sorts of toys but the kids insist the kids are the ones that you know are jet you know they stereotyped themselves and you even see the kinds of play little girls with dolls the feminists have been very upset by that because they think that that conditions them to be mothers and we should bond little boys with dolls well they've tried that and then the boys will you know turn them I've been did conferences where there they'll cry to say well yes I tried to use bubbles and dolls and get the boys to play and then they'd turn them into torpedoes you know this and and by the way that the gender feminists don't like it when I bring up you know any of us bring up those examples because they still think it's conditioning it's good well maybe it was conditioning that made them gender feminists I mean then we get into an argument free will and determinism and we changed the ground again into this meta an interesting argument about ultimate freedom of self-determination but I think that we have to at this point credit women with agency when they choose what they're gonna major in when they choose the field if they want to stay home with kids then I think that it's matron izing to suggest that they aren't responsible for their own life
