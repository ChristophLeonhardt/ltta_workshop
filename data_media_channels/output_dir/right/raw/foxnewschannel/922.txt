00:00:00,905 --> 00:00:01,372
DISTINCTION.

2
00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:02,040

10
00:00:08,446 --> 00:00:09,581
REVEALS AS WE JUST SAID THAT

11
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:10,515
IF JAMES COMEY, NO MATTER

12
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:11,616
WHAT YOU THINK OF HIS

13
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:14,419
POLITICS REPEATEDLY AND

14
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:15,386
DEMONSTRABLY BROKE PROTOCOL

15
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:18,456
AND ENGAGED IN INSUBORDINATE

16
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:18,823
BEHAVIOR.

17
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:19,757
TOM FITTON IS THE PRESIDENT

18
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:20,792
OF JUDICIAL WATCH AND HE

19
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:21,659
JOINS US TONIGHT.

20
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,995
TOM, YOU ARE MAKE A LIVING

21
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:25,697
FILING REQUESTS, FOIA

22
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:26,965
REQUESTS FOR GOVERNMENT

23
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:27,332
DOCUMENTS.

24
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:29,334
YOU HAVE A SHARP EYE FOR

25
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,169
WHAT'S BEEN DELETED FROM

26
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:31,536
DOCUMENTS.

27
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:33,771
ARE YOU CONFIDENT THESE

28
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:36,507
500-ODD PAGES ARE THE WHOLE

29
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:37,175
STORY OF THE INVESTIGATION

30
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:38,743
INTO THE CLINTON EMAIL

31
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:39,077
SCANDAL?

32
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:40,311
>> WELL, IT'S THE BEGINNING

33
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:41,446
OF THE STORY IN THE LEAST

34
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:43,681
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS

35
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:44,782
THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN

36
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:46,451
PETER STRZOK, CLINTON EMAILS

37
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:47,485
AND THE RUSSIAN

38
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:48,152
INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS YET

39
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:51,489
TO BE ANALYZED BY THE IG.

40
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:52,857
JUDICIAL WATCH UNCOVERED THE

41
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:54,025
CLINTON EMAIL SCANDAL.

42
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:54,959
IT'S UPSETTING TO SEE

43
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:55,994
DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF THE

44
00:00:55,994 --> 00:00:58,997
FBI AND DOJ BENDING

45
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:00,298
OVERBACKWARDS TO PROTECT

46
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:00,798
HILLARY CLINTON.

47
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:02,333
AND DEFERRING TO HER ON

48
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,868
VIRTUALLY EVERY ISSUE AND

49
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:05,436
DECIDING EARLY ON NOT TO

50
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:06,471
PROSECUTE HER AND JUST GO

51
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:09,374
THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF AN

52
00:01:09,374 --> 00:01:10,041
INVESTIGATION DESPITE ALL

53
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,509
THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAD

54
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:12,677
UNCOVERED THAT SHE KNEW WHAT

55
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:14,746
SHE WAS DOING WAS

56
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:16,714
INAPPROPRIATE, SHE WAS

57
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:17,548
WARNED BY HER NATIONAL

58
00:01:17,548 --> 00:01:18,349
SECURITY TEAM AND SECURITY

59
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:19,417
TEAM NOT TO DO IT.

60
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,352
AND THAT SHE DID IT TO AVOID

61
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:23,021
DISCLOSURE AND

62
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:23,488
ACCOUNTABILITY.

63
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:24,789
ALL OF WHICH GOES TO THE

64
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,057
HEART OF GUILT IN TERMS OF

65
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:27,225
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

66
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:30,094
HER INTENT WAS FOR

67
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:30,762
MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED

68
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:31,863
INFORMATION AND OTHER

69
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:32,664
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.

70
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:33,698
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

71
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:35,600
I THINK -- YOUR VIEWERS NEED

72
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,502
TO LOOK AT THE REPORT

73
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:37,902
THEMSELVES.

74
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:39,037
DON'T TRUST THE MEDIA

75
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:41,506
ANALYSIS OF IT BECAUSE.

76
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:42,173
>> Tucker: THAT'S FOR SURE.

77
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:44,242
>> THE DOCUMENTS SHOWS THAT

78
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,077
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT WAS

79
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:47,478
DESPERATE TO PROTECT HILLARY

80
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:48,112
CLINTON WHILE AT THE SAME

81
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,248
TIME AS THESE TEXTS INDICATE

82
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:52,617
WAS GEARING UP TO GO AFTER

83
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:53,518
DONALD TRUMP AT THE VERY

84
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:54,285
SAME TIME.

85
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:55,453
SO, WHEN YOU COMPARE AND

86
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:56,888
CONTRAST WHAT HAPPENED WITH

87
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:57,622
MRS. CLINTON, WITH WHAT WAS

88
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:59,857
GOING ON WITH HILLARY-BOY

89
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:00,925
PRESIDENT TRUMP OR THEN

90
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:02,193
CANDIDATE TRUMP, THESE SAME

91
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:04,629
PEOPLE WERE WORKING WITH THE

92
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:07,098
CLINTON CAMPAIGN, FUSION GPS

93
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:08,366
TO TARGET AND SPY ON THE

94
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,735
MAN.

95
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:11,436
>> Tucker: THAT'S AN

96
00:02:11,436 --> 00:00:00,000
EXCELLENT POINT.
