Trump could be criticized for a number of things but one thing is certain she tries to maintain his obligations his electoral obligations as for our meetings I believe that they are very beneficial they're very useful in Helsinki we spoke about things that both of our countries are interested in in 2021 for example the New START treaty is coming to an end are we going to prolong this treaty of course we want to do that all of the world is interested in that and if we don't start negotiations about that today by 2021 the new start will just will just stop its operation it will no longer be active there are other issues for example conflict resolutions yes we have contacts on other grounds on other areas but we need to cooperate in order to on issues such as Iran Syria Turkey with regards to other countries of the region Lebanon Egypt etc we need to talk about these issues on the highest political level I think that these are not second-rate problems second-rate issues that are important for example the Iranian nuclear program is it something that concerns only Iran or the u.s. of course not it concerns many countries of the world including Europe I think that the Iranian nuclear deal is is a very good and useful instrument of non-proliferation but this is an issue that needs to be negotiated but we need to have negotiations in order to negotiate you cannot discuss all things on the telephone as for the meeting I understand what mr. Trump said he is interested in holding this meeting and I'm ready to participate in such a meeting as well but we need to have the environment for that and we need to prepare for that we are ready we are prepared for such a meeting we are ready to invite mr. Trump to Moscow as well I invited him actually and I'm ready to come to Washington as well but as long as we have the environment to work together you
