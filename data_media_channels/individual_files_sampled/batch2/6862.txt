here's colin kaepernick it's nice to see that colin kaepernick is getting noticed by international organizations this is what GQ said about it he's since being named GQ citizen of the year Colin Kaepernick has received Sports Illustrated Muhammad Ali legacy award and east and more courageous advocate award from the ACLU and now Amnesty International has awarded Kaepernick with the highest distinction the organization has the ambassador of conscience award and here's some of his words he said how can you stand for the national anthem of a nation that preaches and propagates freedom and justice for all that is so unjust to so many of the people living there Kaepernick thirty years old said on Saturday ceremony racialized oppression and dehumanization is woven into the very fabric of our nation the effects of which can be seen in the lawful lynching of black and brown people by the police and the mass incarceration our black and brown lives in the prison industrial complex those how your you're not gonna you're not gonna hear a news reporter say that you're not gonna you're not gonna bid you're not allowed to hear that racialized oppression and dehumanization is woven into the very fabric of our nation and then he refers to the police killing unarmed black men all over the country as lawful lynching and that's exactly what it is concludes by saying meanwhile Kaepernick has completed his promised one million dollars in donations despite being blackballed by the NFL that nice so that's a that's a real that's real courage you want a Profile in Courage there it is that's it and now I don't know how now I'm a white guy so I don't understand the issues like a black person does or any minority rights I've had privilege right and so is Steve but I don't I don't understand why there aren't more I do understand why there aren't more African American athletes in football like standing up for him right now there were lots of people who were kneeling remember that that so what I guess we're gonna see if that's going to keep going get going on like that seem to happen I'm pretty through the year right did it happen with I don't watch football so I only saw it when the news reported it did it keep happening well can is really quickly Jimmy you're not watching football for a reason you're not watching it because you don't want to participate in this that's right well that's funny because there's other people boycotting football because of the kneeling is that funny yeah so you guys are both having the same thing but for 22 separate reasons but you know what this is why Kaepernick's decision is so courageous and I don't blame the other athletes for not stepping up because there's tremendous pressure to conform at all levels right you want to be a good guy you want to be a good employee you don't want to let down your fans you don't let down your your bosses you have other people who are saying hey come on let's just play the game right and so so you have to be able to be a jerk to some people and let other people down they care about to fight for greater cause and that's hard to do sometimes yeah and you know it comes at a great personal financial sacrifice I mean look there are 32 teams in NFL there may be at best 20 quarterbacks better than him right maybe maybe 25 he should definitely a starter at a minimum he should be a backup backup quarterbacks he could get anywhere between 7 and 10 million dollars a year and he's not getting that but he still donating a million dollars of his you know of his income well it's a go it's ironic that when Muhammad Ali he wouldn't go killed poor brown people in another country he said the South Vietnamese never did anything to me is my enemies are right here in the United States or the one denying me rights which was so powerful right and the guy like that to be able to say it and then he took it on the chin because they took his title away and he couldn't fight in the prime of his career Muhammad Ali the greatest boxer ever couldn't fight in the prime of his career they took that away from him cuz he wouldn't go kill people and George Carlin had a hilarious bit about it he was like no Bahama dolly makes his living beatin other people up but he won't kill people and government said well if you won't go kill people we're not gonna let you beat people up that's right that's a good point good point so here's colin kaepernick prime of his career risking everything for people for other people not for him let's do this for himself he's not he's not doing this he's not going out on strike for more money he's doing this he's doing a silent protest during the national anthem which was by the way recommended that he do that by a green beret a green beret told him to do it so one of the top criticisms of Kaepernick by his detractors is hey protests on your own time not not during work hours right that's that's just absurd we're having your rally during his work hours yeah we're playing the national and if they play the national anthem during your work hours you can have a reaction to it and and the so-called protest is basically just being quiet during this one thing when no one's working right so imagine that people at TYT came in and we made everyone stand for the for the Pledge of Allegiance or we have played a national anthem before a work started before and someone just doesn't stand they just melt yeah like all of a sudden that person is not working the person is protesting on our time no it's nobody's working they're just standing there just there most people are standing and some people are sitting and said we're kneeling said you were getting hotdogs some people are in the bathroom peeing hi like what so this this criticism where you pretend that you're not anti the movement you're just talking about when they should protest that's convenient for you is one of the oldest tricks they said they would say that the Martin Luther King yeah some rights movement why are you protesting today today's whatever today is Valentine's Day today is Mother's Day protests on some other day when it's less inconvenient if you enjoyed this clip of
