when before I began this interview steven crowder was in fact wearing pants he walked into the room not wearing pants to make me specifically uncomfortable more we do sell them since you haven't plugged my stuff you've been plugging psychologists at the lot of credit merchants or calm so here we are on the Sunday special with steven crowder who lacks pants and we will get to all of the questions for steven crowder we will ask him why indeed he feels that it is necessary and appropriate for him not to wear pants and thus to show his junk to the entire world but first let's talk a little bit about talk space the online therapy company that lets you message a licensed therapist from anywhere at any time look steven crowder could use a therapist and you might need to as well all

gonna have to do what I do four of those I'm so tempted to screw all of them up for you I know and you already had one so congratulations you did you did you did stumble a little bit I know well you know you actually ducking into my camera line and then pouring water into your own mug is always definitely a wonderful no no I just don't trust you look back at you dude I mean I'm the one wearing pants so all I can say is that when before we began this interview steven crowder was in fact wearing pants he walked into the room now wearing pants to make me specifically uncomfortable because as most people know I am deeply uncomfortable with the male body well I think you're deeply uncomfortable with the men and women of our armed services because this is what they wear they were ranger panties or they're known softies in the Navy so I don't know why I don't know why you would disrespect them that way our more we didn't tell them since you haven't plugged my stuff you've been plugging psychologists at a lot of credit merch store comm and of course everyone knows for the Mudd Club of it yeah if I were more of a patriot I'd be staring at your junk with with more enthusiasm but apparently I am not so all right let's jump into it let's jump into what you do for a living which is supposedly comedy allegedly so yes it's so steven crowder for those who know for a guy who's so smart that was redundant right off the supposedly allegedly let's try and curb back the flaw supposedly it says supposedly is not a legal term allegedly is but let's talk a little bit about how you got to where you are so he runs a show a lawyer present I mean a half age and Pilbara schmancer always I'm Jewish but you know the Crowder is sitting here and and people should know the way that I got to know steven crowder was in fact as his lawyer so many many years ago we got to know each other because I was recommended to Steven for some odd reason as somebody who might be able to negotiate a contract I think it was Andrew Breitbart well it was probably Andrew it's always Andrew which made no sense because it wasn't the kind of law that you did right but I can read a contract yeah and so anyone Jewish this is correct any trust at you and I remember that you went in and you weep Connery bad qualities right off the bat employer who's Jewish no no I said I don't know trusted me someone who could do this and I remember he said this guy you know I trust this this guy he's younger but he'll know how to take care of you ever we went in kinda like the Donald Trump we try to negotiate going in hi mm-hmm and we'd expect them to come back but they didn't right there we just know and I'm err I thought you were probably probably held some animosity toward me because you were like crap I should have come in lower because you know I was making so much more than you it's true you you are you were really earning at that point and then the first time that the first time that we met in person steven crowder came to my came to my condo yeah i can't remember why you were there at all I mean just so he heard this giant Canadian and he and were upstairs and I'm about to do a radio show or something yeah and you decided to demonstrate your Brazilian Jujitsu skills by putting me in a headlock and then there's a guillotine choke but you said you had a hernia only after I put you in the choke that's true I was like why don't you tell me before this and then I then I felt bad but only a little bit right but I didn't launch a lawsuit against you in that was the beginning of our French yes it was the beginning of our friendship the same thing he did my Fox News contract early on because yeah you know listen at that point I wasn't really obviously I wasn't looking for anything special but I remember I just said I know some people don't own the rights to their own names and I want to be protected I want to make sure that I maintain kind of my autonomy and you did you you helped to help me with that at that point that we enable I don't have a lot of negotiating power yeah but it was it was very helpful no it's always good that my legal skill was talked up the beginning of a show so I appreciate that well Stephen is indeed the creator and the host of louder with Crowder which is the most successful comedy comedy show on the right I think pretty clearly and obviously I mean he has a second-rate mug which we've allowed him to actually bring in here pour his water into obviously this right here the left is tears hot or cold tumblr is far superior to Apollo it has more bulk now sort of the reverse of our bots it employs a lot of Chinese children this is short and fat like me and this one's tall and skinny like you but in any case the the the the show is is takes a lot of work it's really worth watching so I wanted to ask let's get deep into the weeds with steven crowder from the very beginning how did you go from a misanthropic canadian child to a giant texan comedian in one short life you know it's it's I was always it's the only thing I ever wanted to do did you ever want to do anything else as a kid did you ever want to be a fireman or a policeman I mean I know your plan when I was interested in in like genetic science I was also a violinist so I thought about than that okay I was always very nice all the Asian is doing the violin you were like I was pretty violinist I know you were very good violinist but you know different to be honest with you it wasn't really about the race I don't think your parents were jamming piano keys into your neck if you missed a mr. note I have a lawyer right now happy actually his mommy's to slam the piano on his fingers talk about tech like he talks about it hits Tiger mom and he's brilliant at he's nice so he's an SMU law grad that's actually you know that's a funny story speaking of Texas so my half-asian lawyer bill rich from an SMU law grad when we did the show at SMU he was in there he was a part of the show he was in the crowd and we did a parody of say anything where he was holding up a boombox and in your eyes but Peter Gabriel was playing but he's walking in and there are these protestors and the other side of the street it was like there was a poultry like 40 people but one of them was his law professor he goes bill what do you say I'm in the show I'm protesting the show so I kind of assumed that in law you would have more conservative professors turns out I guess that's okay certainly not anymore yeah and maybe major law firms are very very much the left animal at one point I'll have to do a show where I talk about all my experiences in my interviews for for being a lawyer like I was at Harvard Law School and I was interviewed by 32 firms the way works at Harvard is that everybody shows up to recruit you because you're at Harvard Law School which means you're smart and so they then come to the they come to the Charles hotel but that was the self pat for sponsors I don't see how creative he is with the compliments that was a selfie yeah no it means you're smart it's smooth I tell you what's not smart is these generic chairs my back is gonna be strong I have to get up and stretch right in front of you well please do not and in any case 32 school 32 different firms came and recruited me and I went 1 for 32 on my interview specifically because I was right-wing and they saw in my resume that aydin's my books but in any case let's get back to you I want to I want to compliment you there because a lot this is one thing I know that bothers you and bothers me a lot people say all was because it was right-wing no in this case it's true because anyone out there who knows your background in law and listen I you know I I despise you of course all that but you are supremely qualified and it's clear that there was a bias against your political world I mean they pretty much said it yeah I know you could bother when people say well I didn't get accepted right because I was that was at Schenectady Community College and I bombed out so well no ha it's not because you were conservative it's the same thing with a lot of sort of conservative self professed comedians sometimes like I know every single conservative in the comedy any industry entertainment is very certainly comedy and a lot of people just say well it's because I was right-wing so well ha I guess because you're not there yet I don't need to say they're not good they're not there yet so in that case I want people to know that is entirely legitimate that it was because of your worldview and probably because you couldn't keep your mouth shut about it well so on my resume the the name of my second book was porn generation how social liberalism is corrupting our future in one particular interview with Gibson Dunn and Crutcher the partner who was interviewing people I walked in before I even sat down or said my name he said I walked in the door I remember this clear as day and he says it has always been my contention that conservatives and religious people in general have a freudian fear of sex can't even shook my hand yet and at that point it's like I'm not getting this job so go you know eff this guy and that was pretty much I mean ER we would also be improper verbage because wasn't Freud the guy who wanted to sleep with his mom he didn't have a fear of sex he thought that other people so I guess you're saying a Freudian complex yes I'm afraid of that that's what he was going for yeah in any case let's get back to the dark in that you completely avoided here what was how did you go from being a giant Canadian to a giant Texan and also did you always want to do political comedy or do pure comedy no I always just wanted to if you'd have asked me when I was 12 or 13 I would have said I want to be an Academy award-winning actor really that's what that truly would have been my dream I just wanted to act but I also always loved comedy I started writing stand-up when I was 14 to do actually the school talent show which ended up being cancelled so I just continued writing so the first time I did stand-up I think I was 17 but I had to cut down from about an hour of material to five minutes most people bomb their first time the only reason I didn't bomb was because I had so much material to edit back but don't ever know how corrupt obviously the academy is and that the awards didn't mean a whole lot I said okay what I want what do I want to do I was just talking about this with Dennis Prager not long ago I said okay if I can't be an Academy award-winning actor late-night host so it's like you know my my Safety's Harvard and at that point you know I don't know who your who's your favorite late-night host of all well time aside from yours truly hobbies not all time I wasn't Leno fan really yes ah I know ah breakin my heart see I was I was all about Letterman until later on when he came a grumpy man but early Letterman like the Larry bud Melman okay Rupert's deli that was real and more sophisticated yes in comedy yes I know okay that's the comedians want to do Leno because of the numbers and it was an easy interview but the comedians all respected Dave that was kind of the rule until again later on he's totally changed so early Letterman and I used to watch it every day my dad would tape it and put it on VHS and of course fast-forward the parts that we couldn't watch and I always just thought wow this is something really cool that I'd love to be a part of and I did stand-up for a long time I always think I wanted to entertain people and when I saw people like Nick DiPaolo do stand-up you know I'd get Conor I'd feel bad about myself because I would say I'm never going to be as good as Nick DiPaolo I'm a good stand-up comedian but a lot of the things I wanted to do like impressions sketches didn't work on stage and of course acting I couldn't do Stan it couldn't incorporate a lot of comedy not writers don't typically like you ad-libbing if people don't know out there so this really what I'm doing now is what I've always wanted to do we can incorporate all of it this is what I've always wanted to do and it's not really a right-leaning show but it's really a late-night show where conservatives don't need a fear being sucker-punched you know you have a bit of a harder job than I did to be honest with you because I get to be a political pundit who's occasionally funny but when you're in the comedic space when people affect you to be funny all the time yeah and your hit rate had better be really incredibly high do you feel a lot of pressure you having to be funny yeah I do and I think you know and I feel a lot of pressure not because it's like oh I better be funny or it'll it'll hurt my ego you know when you know this when you do these live shows I'm not a guy come up and give me his Navy Cross yeah and he said I had such bad PTSD and I was suicidal he said watching your show is what kept me saying because I was able to sort of consume the news I was able to digest it but I didn't want to kill myself you know we want we don't want to be the only show people watch we do more sourcing I think than anyone honestly we have we have a rule we have to have two completely unbiased sources for every claim that we make we put them on air you or a leftist source so as a matter of fact sometimes we'll actually have a source from Daily wire not like we can't used it we can use daily wire maybe we'll say daily wires bullcrap so we go to the PubMed study which you guys just saw back you know obviously we're summarizing but unfortunately people say it's not legitimate because you know your shekels and all that so yeah so I feel a tremendous responsibility if people are choosing law it was credited to be their last show before their head hits the pillow I have always said this to people who work for me I go listen they don't know the last show assume that everyone walking in is walking in for the first time and they've never seen your prior performances and earn it earn their dollar earn their laugh every single time that's how I tried to approach it and it really comes the pressure comes from more of a sense of responsibility in realizing how much this means to to other people which that's something I wasn't ready for honestly just doing when I was just doing stand-up and smoker clubs were drunks were mad at you were doing open mics you didn't expect someone would come up and say hey I didn't kill myself because of your show and I this is something I know you've you've touched and I think we've sort of stuck a chord in in culture right now we hear people are other all the time there is no group out there right now who have been other done anyone under the age of 35 whose right-leaning for a long time they feel really isolated they feel really alone and so obviously our show is a comedy show and yours is more like you said sort of political punditry is that the reality fairy commentary brilliant commentary uh it really does make people feel less alone and it means a lot to them so that's what the pressure comes from well let's talk a little bit of what your routine I'm gonna move these books because my mug is too dirty and so it's Wow running into them but yeah let's talk a little bit about your sort of routine getting ready for the show because I have my routine I get ready for it for you know because I'm in the news cycle all day long it doesn't take me that long to actually prep for the show because I'm in the news cycle I know what all the news stories are I know what all the clips are gonna be but for you you do that you do the once a week three-hour show which is the big extravaganza it's a 1 hour and 15 minutes yeah all three hours wouldn't used to be on radio but it's a little longer than the daily show okay so how often is the daily show is behind the paywall over at CR TV it's about a 44 minute clock like traditional shows and then on on Thursday we do one extra game right and but the amount of it the amount of time that you put into these shows is just extraordinary so what is the organization like for these shows so well to give you an idea you know I'm up 4:30 or 5:00 and I'm working by 5:30 writing the jokes right in the pitches because if I write 20 jokes maybe two will work and we have a couple that people know who help with some - Owen Benjamin comes in hourly and it's really helpful but really for the first for the first well three years we did it on Radio and then The Daily Show was just me and now Brautigan helps a lot he's a brilliant joke writer who writes for the website and then we go when we do the pitch meeting so I'll put in a bunch of material before the actual pitch meeting occurs which will occurred around 8:30 in the morning they go in add some of their ideas or see how they're going to delegate the tasks because will typically have like two sketches three or four photoshop's as far as original comedy bits and then some punchlines and then we do a dive in segments or meets every one is a different term for it nowadays where we're kind of staking out one topic that's what usually goes to YouTube that's the clip people see who aren't mug Club members and with that that's where you okay for we have it we have a beginning middle and end in a self encapsulated segment that people can digest and whether it's taking on the top five ar-15 myths you know of that day or it's taking on doing a rebuttal to whoever Vox or Young Turks we have to be really really meticulous about our research because we're actually held to a higher standard funny enough is comedians because I think the Jon Stewart comedian hat on journalist hat off you know actually kind of gave us less leeway on the right even though they give it to everyone on the left though Michelle wolf show got canceled right here but that I did oh my gosh who decided that was a good idea who did it I have no idea Michelle Wolf's immediate relatives apparently because that thing was just an abomination so I want to ask you in a second about you know the relationship between comedy and madness but first let's talk about your impending death so September is national life insurance Awareness Month if you listen to this show a lot you've heard me talk about how important life insurance is here's the thing 40% of Americans still do not have life insurance so if anything were to happen to you your family would be left perette that I have to pay for your coffin but they're poor because you were too stupid to get life insurance these days there's not an excuse for not having life insurance life insurance rates are at a 20-year low and it is easier than ever to

just a fragile balance but you can do the whole thing for yourself right now over a policy genius it's the easy way to compare and buy life insurance I've been meaning to do this the whole time you're doing that ad and I didn't want to screw it up for you so ok recall that these space heaters made to look like lights I have no idea it's very bizarre thing I design my own set the decorative choices that we make sometimes work for me dude I think I do this but it is think about this about the choices like you've seen like the wooden pallets a lot of time mm-hmm like oh it seems really it just seems very organic like who has a space with these simply sometimes I said that I'm going like these are cool what we really do is if we have a guess we really don't like them we after the show we strap them down we shine it really bright in their face yes and then we just beat them are those incandescent or the LEDs to look like an goodness I hadn't I don't know I don't know I actually like those bulbs but I do have an insurance question for you after the show no joke I like actually send me because as celebrities now it's a whole different it's a whole different ballgame oh yeah I had especially because you get death threats yeah the rest of exactly it's something very difficult I want it so let's talk about the death threats and all that you actually is a good transition so let's talk about the the fact that you do a lot of really controversial comedy so where do you draw line so you know there's a lot of talk these days about where comedians ought to draw lines as you mention Owen Benjamin owned Benjamin has been taken to task for using the n-word in one of his comedy routines yeah well where do you think it's appropriate to draw lines of comedians you think there should be any lines as a comedian obviously there are certain things that you want to even though you're the guy who paints Muhammad with menstrual blood as Bob Ross yes on camera where do you decide where those lines are and when is it appropriate to cross them okay that's a good example because context is more important than content let me let me let me preface this with I I don't know it was Phyllis Diller who said this for hose it might have been Dennis Miller who repeated it I don't know the original person who tuned this quote is attributed but basically nothing is off-limits except the helpless so in other words you don't go down to a you know special needs baby and ha unless you're a liberal and you want to abort a Down syndrome baby apparently they're okay with that so nothing is really off-limits now I have limitations as to what I'm comfortable doing and everyone will have their own line as a society I'm very uncomfortable with saying this is these are the list of appropriate words these are lists of inappropriate words like we were just talking about before honor DMX you know I was listening to his with the n-word mf'er b-word talking about killing people and the do we have to bleep me because well we can believe it okay is the word they bleep out it's the explicit version that's the one word they eliminate now going really these are the words that we're picking now and of course n-word would be included if he weren't black so it really is a political tool and I never want to play a role in that game that being said you know I think that's a good example so you talk about painting Mohammed and menstrual blood let's take the context of that that on its surface sounds bad granted right it sounds pretty bad but BuzzFeed's boldly the the land well women they're you know the fat pride feminists they were painting and menstrual blood and they had done a lot of you know of course always anti Krish anti sort of judeo-christian videos for a long time so we did a parody Bob Ross painting Muhammad and menstrual blood and it got worse when the Bob Ross estate threatened to sue us and then we drew them eating from a pile of a fecal matter next to Mohammed I think we never heard from them again we never seem to get what I've always said we're not necessarily a shark in the comment role but we can be a pufferfish we'll make them wish they picked somebody else even if we get torn off of every platform we'll make them wish that they picked somebody else that's kind of our motto so con contextually when you look at that you go oh this is satire this is parody we didn't just do it out of the blue it was featured on YouTube the women painting with menstrual blood we didn't start it we didn't we didn't start a trend to knew it was them so well they painted first blood not me what would he make of the of the merger of sort of comedy and politics so you're a comedian you label yourself a comedian everybody knows you as a comedian but you do see political actors president from is basically a stand-up comic most of what he does is political comedy disguised as politics and what this means is that he crosses lines that you will cross but people are not sure what to make of it are we supposed to take it like comedy or are we supposed to take it like politics is he just being politically incorrect as a comedian or is he just being a jackass I think he's thoughtless I think there's a big difference I mean there's there's no question that I know where the line is and I know how to walk up to it and dance on the line and pull it back you know if I cross the line it's very deliberate I don't think that's the case with President Donald Trump I genuinely don't think he knows but one thing that I do think is interesting about Donald Trump because obviously you weren't a big fan of his and in a lot of ways still aren't and I was not at all during the primaries in a lot of ways I'm still not I think we're seeing a transition with President Trump that you've seen with a lot of young conservatives who we reach I think he was a guy who gave to Democrats for most of his life who really just he was doing business in New York I don't really think it was a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat either no I think he was whatever he needed to get his latest structure with his name emblazoned across it erected um and I think what you're seeing now though is he's come in he thought the left would play ball a little bit and they've been so vicious which we've known them to be they've attacked his family personally we're not just ok screw you and he's becoming more conservative I think we're seeing a genuine transition of him becoming more right-wing kind of like I hate to say but venes are screwed later in life everyone can kind of be redeemed I think we're seeing with President Trump I do think there's some of that but how do we deal with the fact that he's not you're not toxic in the same way to young people so young people watch your show because they know you're a comedy guy right they're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt when you say something that's offensive because as you say you know what's offensive you know it's not and if you're being offensive it's generally being deliberately offensive right for comedic purposes President Trump just sort of says things yeah and he's sort of in and he's very toxic for young people I mean there's no question you look at the polls and among young people he's wildly unpopular how do you how do we continue to maintain lines or draw lines what do you think we are doing here's one thing I was like he's unpopular in a sense that a lot of your fans and my fans probably aren't huge Trump supporters that being said they do like that someone has sort of thrown the gloves off a little bit so I think it's important to look at how the question is being framed you know kind of gonna say oh and 90% of Americans are pro-abortion but then when you give him a cutoff where you show him a fetal chart they got a fetal development chart that changes right so I think with Donald Trump if you were to ask me are you a Donald Trump fan I'd probably answer no but if you were to ask me do you think that Donald Trump has done a relatively good job as president I'd probably say yes if you would ask me or prom I think we would both agree on this culturally definitely he's opened the door for conservatives to not be so ashamed of what they are even though he's not one of them but I don't think Marco Rubio would have done this I don't think even senator Ted Cruz I don't think chris Christie obviously would have gone after the media in the same way that Donald Trump has so I think even though this thing is squeaking is this being caught up on here is it okay all right all right fine I'm just making sure this I'm it's the replication it's not me I just wanna make sure you're okay - its no no no I'm making sure that people know it's not me it's my point then this is important for me it's not everything is about you there you go you can hear the squeak it's the check so I think that's what's important about President Donald Trump even I think even though people may not like him I think a lot of young people are happy to see the burdens the shackles of political correctness kind of be thrown off and he has helped pave the way for them so you live a very high stress lifestyle obviously to your show you're out in public a lot a lot of people don't like it you said that somebody put your drink on a plane so that it's been a party for you how do you how do you deal with the stress of that I mean I've I have my own ways of dealing with stress I go out and I kill a puppy but what do you do well what do you want to call your sponsor really quickly what was that the life engine no no no the help the second oh yeah yeah no I do go see a psychologist that's that's a real thing and I actually had a some good friends where you'll see four former UFC champions and I used to go see a psychologist when I was and I didn't get a lot out of it and the psychologist I go and see is actually a sports psychologist and executive psychologist it's really more about time management it's really more about okay how are you being disciplined about your rest you know I was talking with Dennis Prager about this you kind of have to fight against your nature and there is a lot of comedians are lazy I'm not one of those people I would border on paranoid as far as we actually just printed out just the jokes that we wrote less that I wrote last year and not including the research of the exhilarating pick it was it was thousands upon thousands upon thousands of pages just in jokes for the show that's including the ones that made it so it genuinely has helped me a lot seeing the kind of psychologist who's talked about how to schedule your life and taught me to be more disciplined about rest that's not always feasible but I realized I was running on you know four or five hours of sleep every single night and they're like okay you don't need to shoot for eight or nine just shoot for seven consistently shoot for a few five-minute breaks where you can do some that's not work-related because you know with what we do and I'm incredibly grateful I'm not complaining at all but with what with what we do you're never finished you just choose to stop right and there's always one more thing that's right and that is what's kind of difficult about it like last night I was getting back to the hotel I was taping a pregger you video I don't think about in the cat out of the bag it'll be out on Columbus Day and some things went late and I I was just going there's fifty things I have to do but I'm just gonna choose to stop that has been a big revelation for me it's okay to choose to stop at this point has your wife deal with all that so you're married how long married now six years okay so yeah a kids ending in the foreseeable future here you know it's funny you say that I would love to be to point my life where I could have kids and the things I've always had to work so much recently so that's one thing we're definitely working on is finding more balance so we are you know we don't have we don't have the daily wire budget we're not exactly running the Jim Henson budget that you have here in your heat lamps but you know getting you know getting sixteen I would take a a 12-hour day most days you know and maybe a ten-hour day here there outside of Sunday and I think I'd have more balanced life so it did they are in the future just not right how does my wife deal with all this I mean it's it's it's hard it's hard yeah it is hard my wife um she's very supportive you know she did she worked she was a vice president of a contract furniture company she frogged some chairs that don't squeak and she left the job and she's just kind of she doesn't work for me or the company full-time but she's really good in her personally people love her so for showing a guest around or if we need to help kind of book some travel she's been very helpful for her that's been really relieving I think this is with a lot of women you know they think they think they have to work their way up and she did she worked her way up in a company but realize that's not what you wanted to do it is hard on her it's just like probably well your wife is a doctor obviously indeed yes so that's the rumor and in a very a very attractive lady your wife you've done very well for yourself on and it with us with what we do because like I said especially my show is substantially at more of a workload to put a Daily Show like our a late-night show comedy shows have to be written it yes and and we do the sketches in the production you know it's not really difficult so it's kind of like we had Bryan Shaw World's Strongest Man on the show recently we had George daniel cormier current UFC heavyweight light heavyweight champion and it really is a partnership where their wives have to support them in a way that's not typical and weak I know some women are gonna be furious when they hear this but it is a volunteer role but my wife is kind of accepted that okay Steve's gonna need a little more support because he isn't even that if I don't help him with one she's not gonna take 20 minutes to eat and that comes down to you know when I'm done working listening to her making sure that her needs are met that's a really important thing if we're gonna bitch about feminism then we need to talk about being real men and that means yes but I know it sounds namby-pamby ting your wife's needs making sure that and that's just that's not just physically and financially we're talking about spiritually emotionally making sure that they feel heard that they feel safe um so it really has been a learning process and I will say that contra did some people who we know my wife's are very strong have you met my wife sure yeah well yeah that's right am i with you she's very stout on personality so for us there was a lot of clashing early on as opposed to some friends who were both Type B personalities where they never argued but some of these people just got divorced like what happened they never gone to marital counseling they never had a fight and the first fight was the blowout whereas my wife and I the arc is it was a lot tougher early on and it got easier do you think we both got any better at marriage or you just round off each other's edges a little bit I think we both we've both both now and listened to much DMX both we've both gotten better at marriage and communication for sure and and I think a big a big part of it is is a you know really learning that people inherently are selfish you know men struggle with pornography men always have for women the pornography is romantic comedy and The Bachelor right if he loves he'll love me just the way I am no man loves you just the way you are he loves you just he loves you as you are but there are things he doesn't like about you just like you know a woman won't try to change me woman is always gonna try to change you I don't have a problem with it means they're trying to better you now if you become the only one that you're working on if I'm working on me and she's working on me and that's a problem when we started our marriage there was a lot of that I was the project you know I needed a lot of work and now we've both both worked on ourselves and and learned how to communicate more effectively and I do think that is something that's really important you know in high pressure positions or high profile positions people mocked mike pence you know that's a good example a lot of people don't understand for example if you're alone in a car with a woman who's not your wife someone can snap a picture and it's a big deal even if nothing happened this is correct there are certain pressures that come with your position my position that a lot of people don't know this isn't the celebrity relating yourself from the possibility of sin is a definite yes in any position where you are prominent at all you've got to take the proper precautions you've got to determine what is a worthy risk and what isn't I know this is what what's a worthwhile risk for a guy who painted Mohammedan menstrual blood I got the irony is not lost but no my I wouldn't I wouldn't have been able to accomplish what we have you know what what moderate success we have and I'm grateful for with without my wife I have no doubt about okay so I want to talk to you a little bit about sort of your mental state and well then we'll get into some politics and social media and all the first answer correct dude I mean you're really catching on he's a quick learner

mean I'm decrypting all sorts of national security okay all right I think now we're using word I shot me I saw that I was not working for now certainly not certainly not doing now you're watching interdimensional vampire that's correct in any case let's talk about the fact you're a crazy person so as everyone can say you're a wild man and and this is not a rip on you this is just the nature partly of being in comedy that most people who are in comedy I've never met anybody who is a full-time comedian who doesn't have edges right who who doesn't have to be a wild man has to be on all the time yeah so what do you think is the relationship between comedy and mental health between comedy and being a wild person and having a normal life and still having to be on all the time trying to make people laugh gosh I don't want this to become a Barbara Walters where it becomes this interest that's yourself real later yeah with a lisp and a speech impediment we favorite tweet how does she get that work does anyone else know I mean who does she sleep with Barbara Walters I mean not gonna go really when she was young she was quite the dish so it's not that gross you're thinking of old Barbara Walters young Barbara Walters had to bear with it with the sitting u.s. senator from Massachusetts that's right yeah but that's not how she got the job so I do wonder that she got the job you know I I can't speak for all community but I can't speak for myself I was I was probably the kind of kid you hated in school you were probably rajanya throwing people in LA no no I actually had no athletic ability whatsoever I was a very late bloomer yeah well that I didn't actually on my driver's license I listed myself at 6 foot and you know what no my senior year of high school I was six foot one and a member competing in judo at 144 pounds wool and I didn't shave until I was like 2021 I just had peach fuzz and I ain't get chest hair until I was 24 the Crowder's are very late bloomers and the potential for being an angry late bloomer is scary and I'm a relative there's a lot of velocity now but I didn't pay attention at all maybe a point you were just like there's nothing there then all of a sudden yeah it happened very very late um think about when people this is one thing that really bothers when we talk about mental health and I've tried to be forthcoming with a lot of people out there because it seems the only time people talk about it is when it's virtue signal you know in Heath Ledger passes away it's like everyone's uh I mean I just I've struggled with this but where were you when this didn't happen right you were embarrassed to talk about it and so I've talked with parents with their kids and I say you know what's what's the advice you would give to my kids and I've seen them just react horrified by so don't go to college if you don't know what you want to do take some time figure it out when people say were you ever suicidal picture that someone like myself son up at school staring at a board in a way that I couldn't possibly learn in a socialist province for nine hours you try to want to wake up the next day and it was like I was I wasn't gonna David Carradine myself was nothing like that I just remember there were times in my life in high school I just thought like man I just I just wish I didn't have to wake up tomorrow in the sense that I just I hated my life so much it'd be like me saying you have to coach swimming starting tomorrow morning for the rest of your life you know cause at that point your life high school is everything you know grade school high school that's all you know so I'm not big on men in speedos so yes these arranger panties get it right our men and art into armed services they deserve our respect they deserve our respect then that's the route for you now you don't have any respect for anybody the other difference is that I would know that it was me in the end of that sentence not U&I U&I it says you and me you and I I have respect for him and women our armed services no-bid grammar is my space ranger panties are yours irregardless and allegedly let's go ahead I know you said supposedly in alleged only something only someone else who we know we use the word irregardless we both think is very smart that's where it was you said supposedly allegedly which I'll still argue is redundant because I don't think that's but give me that one okay there's someone we both know who we both really respect as smart and he said like you regardless four times yeah that's that's it's not an accident when you're sticking the landing like the fourth time irregardless you're going okay man you think that's a word so I really did um I think a lot of the time but we see as mental illness or mental affliction is just people process things differently because because once I went to college my first semester before I bombed out doing stand-up I was an A student also because I was studying film I was studying creative arts and I was in my element and I I did pretty well pretty quickly in the areas where I was interested in in the areas where I was interested see I was just redundant there because I'm trying to tread lightly here on the issue of mental health so with myself I think I just had to learn how I process information and I had to get very organized when people use us from ADHD and by the way I'm totally against obviously drugging up kids and putting them on Ritalin that being said I've actually done you know not just a questionnaire but EEG testing genetic testing we've done a lot of your that you're in the top percent it's not even close like super super severe and you know andrew breitbart obviously was a prime example of that there are people Winston Churchill would have been an example of that a lot of people are now you find just as many people by the way with ADHD or these in the gutter as you do great world leaders almost every great world leader to some degree or another was mentally afflicted whether it was bipolar or a DD and I don't know what you have I don't know what it is a computer wore tennis shoes syndrome I have no idea but so I think it's important to talk about with people because I think there are a lot of kids out there who who think there's something wrong with them and there's there's really not there's a lot wrong with our public education system today there's a lot wrong with the way we raise young men there's a lot wrong with the way we discuss mental health of the society but a lot of times there's nothing wrong with these people and I totally agree with a lot of that and mental illness runs in my family as well so I totally get where you're coming from we actually didn't get the full chronology of how you got from a socialist province in Canada where you wanted to kill yourself in a classroom - you've living in Texas and making I didn't want to kill myself I was hoping I would like get hit by a car like I would but I was actually hit by a car once and I'm like no I gotta go back to school the next day I'm gonna wait it was it wasn't as good as you thought it wasn't as good as I thought it would be there's real letdown it was a left bound by a rude french-canadian they're being drivers have you been in Montreal yes actually they will speed up to hit you they're very rude the very skilled drivers like in Europe but they're very mean drivers so um yeah I was born in Detroit which like it I've always said he just an accent give to Canada really and then raised in Montreal my mom was french-canadian was born raised in Quebec lived there from 3 to 18 and as soon as I was able to you know get to the States I was doing some films and stand-up and touring I did it immediately they have a stand up for you because you still do some standup but not as not nearly as much ill happens time as much when we do a show live show it's a full show you have to bring in the whole team I just did it recently had a yeah actually we both did that weekend right you kind of spoke and then I kind of do like 25 minutes of stand-up and then do it's like a hybrid between that in keynote I'm still feeling my way around with it but yet stand-up starting off was um you know I was just talking about this yesterday with Dennis Prager you know Stephen Harper was Canada's Ronald Reagan yep and I remember being at an overtime I met Stephen Harper I asked him if he Barack Obama's president asked him if while he would invade but that's in any case it wouldn't be a very long invasion right he said if he asked me if he said he said doesn't it make you a traitor I said not if you win well so that makes you a traitor when you're here if you're rolling the dice on that if you're gonna look at the statistical likelihood you know it's just a guy in a diesel playing with a shotgun but so I remember an open mic night when I was starting out doing CNF it was when he had gotten elected and all the comedians were bitching and moaning about Stephen Harper getting elected and now you have people like my friend Mike Ward who back then I'm sure would have been a liberal are now being put before human rights Tribunal's for speech for an unpopular jokes have you had him on your show at all no not yet no you know he his you know his joke was his joke was and there's an in French so I'm something might be lost in translation there was like a kid who had a make-a-wish in Canada was their equivalent and his make-a-wish was to be on Canadian Idol so here's the thing I guess it turned out the kid wasn't as terminally ill because he's still alive and he was really bad he was a really bad singer and so the guy this guy's bit Mike Warwick saying you know everyone was behind him and it was great but now he just won't die that was his joke it's a joke obviously and he was put before human rights tribunal Mike for $50,000 and lost and now he's in an appeal so a lot of these comedian I remember back then and thinking you idiots do you understand that there's only one political party in this country - technically there's because it's a parliamentary system but the NDP is just super far left liberal there's a liberal and NDP sarai we're getting to the minutiae of Canada nobody cares about the judges still wear funny wigs sometimes but the point is I remember they had a know they couldn't realize it all like back then they wouldn't be able to comprehend - Jordan Peterson that this compulsion of language and I remember at that open mic night going wow these people have no idea what's coming they have no idea that even if they're pro-abortion even if they want to smoke weed the flip side of the coin of Stephen Harper who also by the way helped to prevent the housing crisis in Canada who actually helped a middle class do pretty well whereas here they ended up footing the bill under Barack Obama four years Canada actually for the first time I think was hiring the economic freedom index but the freedom of speech it's not a constitutionally enshrined right and for me doing stand-up earlier I just I I wasn't really super political but I felt as though I had to speak I felt as though I had to argue with every single comedian George Bush sucks and they would at that plans like what John Kerry John Edwards she have any idea the alternative in places like Canada these people do want they want to jail you for speech and I felt like Chicken Little and no one was listening but now people are unfortunately and I think on for unfortunately because this Trudeau guy who's a national embarrassment if they legalized Bernie yes and some Bernie Sanders i handsome I mean you know pretty would be the word I would use I mean I bet you if you looked at that man's free testosterone count it would be non-existent and have you ever seen his wife singing at the podium no I will need only to show it to ya it's it's a national embarrassment I get a so viral on can of my french-canadian family who don't speak English played this for me when they were visiting but um I do think that if he legalizes we'd unfortunately he'll doesn't he'll win again because of like oh there's weed while people getting jailed for saying you know offensive jokes and that scares me so you went to college in the United States or in Canada Canada okay and then you and then you started doing stand-up head you end up in the United States why would let you in well I was born in Detroit right yeah and I've talked about this too big party eligible for the presidency unlike Ted Cruz right yes exactly exactly people would get that wrong where the guy is ineligible but you're not right is that something for president running for president sounds like a terrible job really watching watching these people first of all the quarters in the West Wing or when Trump whined about like the state of the West Wing you ever been in there it's really they offered us a tour when we did the change my mind and we didn't have time yeah it's it's shockingly small like the first time I heard Trump complain about the West Wing I was like what a jackass like complain about the West Wing meets the people's house and then I'm like wow this is like originally inhabited by munchkins like by actual tiny Oh I'm not I'm not a big human big and I was like ducking to get through doorways in stuff it's like going through one of the rooms that's not that's not been remodel at the Waldorf yeah this is terrible that's exactly right it's like that scene from Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory where they start off at one end of the room and by the time you get to the other end of the room everybody sort of crouching down and then Trump some big dude so I imagine he actually has to Crisco himself up you just wedge himself the doorways to get around then at that point the Crisco is incidental it's not to wedge himself through the doorway there's a multitude of uses and they get so so sorry to get back to your store you come to the United States you're from Detroit how did you get back in I was just I was just doing stand-up and funny enough that you bring this up my first man was a guy named Tony Camacho who was black in New York and the reason he brought me on as a client was because I ended my whole stand-up set on the n-word I ended it and we're thank you very much ladies gentleman and it was actually a bit it wouldn't work now to English but it was about French Canadians who would rap and you would actually hear French rap songs with English cuss words including the n-word and you would hear in the radio so be a bunch of friend and then just n-bomb and so it killed in Canada and he said man it takes a lot of guts for a very white guy like yourself to do that and I really enjoyed the bit and he would not be a conservative at all we used to but he you know he he was a Christian guy family values guy he was a conservative who didn't realize it so he brought me to the States and I just started doing you know stand-up some some really crappy clubs but got some pilots with MTV and then got some films and commercials and that took me full circle so I was in LA and back in New York and LA in New York again yeah it was it was always just stand up and act and then how'd you get out in like Fox News me how do you go from stands up and acting - yeah you know that story because you know should I do my audience doesn't yeah um how did did that start you know what you were doing YouTube videos you know what okay so that's this is this is the part that a lot of people don't know so there were no concerns on YouTube my brother and I had done some YouTube videos that had gone viral early on like 2006 there was a really bit I don't remember there was a rash of bad impression videos on YouTube early on like 100 more impressions in three minutes it's just some guy doing the Family Guy cast in Kermit the Frog this is terrible so we did a YouTube video where was called best impressions ever all caps and it was me doing really bad impression so my brother was my Ed McMahon laughing and the reason it went viral was because in the comments section you had people who like this is these are the worst impressions ever you suck you know go kill yourself then you had people saying this is satire you don't get it go kill yourselves then you had some people saying no actually these are really good impressions you guys are wrong and then you had some people who just thought got the joke but didn't think it was funny anyway so everyone started fighting and we learned wow this is how you make something go viral is you get something that strikes a chord but I didn't do anything politically until I would say 2008-2009 and at that point I just finished filming doing a Christian film in San Diego and I had done some episodes actually in an ABC Family show where that was an experience where I was actually talking with a guy on set about South Park he was talking about how much he liked it and he said some things that made me think he was conservative like in on the gag but then I just realize he didn't get the satire and he told on me to the direct rise like yeah I know I love the way they Lampoon the left liberals means like what are you talking about bro you don't get it like no no like Trey and Matt they were speaking at you like they can't stand liberals and he was like no man I don't think you know what you're talking about and as I supposed to have a multi series arc the character I think which opposed be named Jace and instead it was just like drunken frat guy number two like in two episodes so I learned very early on so after this my parents said okay you got you better have to get a job and I never I never had had to work a job before if I was going back to stay home and real I was going back to stay home because I was burnt out and I said okay how about this I'm going to for the next six months treat YouTube like a full-time job I'm gonna upload a video every week just put up a blue bedsheet in the wall and I actually messaged people every single day for six hours a day saying hey might want to check out my channel and responding and that's why I got the first 10,000 subscribers the first semi viral video was crazy Pete's abortion barn right that's one I actually read from the Planned Parenthood website because they sounded like a used car salesman and that was when I learned early on if I just actually read Planned Parenthood's transcript effectively it doesn't matter how offensive I am as a used car salesman selling abortions at half price and then the quran challenge and things sort of became viral and then Andrew I had heard Andrew Breitbart on the Dennis Miller show and just called him and you know Henry spoke with me for 30 minutes so he put up some of my old stand-up and people liked it so I started writing articles PJTV came along and I started working with them and then Fox News when I was working here at PJ chibi in Los Angeles they said hey do you want to come appear on our on our network and I said sure I didn't know by the way but we can talk about it now but I didn't know about the rivalry between O'Reilly and Hannity so Hannity called and I said yes and then the O'Reilly people called right afterward and I said yes and then they called back and said well hold on a second we didn't know you were doing Hannity have to pick one we're the bigger show I said well I gave him my word and then I was persona non grata yeah we all those of us who work in the industry I remember the world's biggest heist it was so terrible so um what happened was I think they brought me in to lose because I was on a debate when they first brought me in and I think it surprised a lot of people that I did relatively well I think they weren't used to sort of someone who was a little bit quicker as a comedian it's kind of just like fighting someone who's unorthodox and then they brought me back and brought me back and then when I started appearing on other news networks they didn't really know what they wanted to do with me they just knew they didn't want anyone else to have me so that's what they were paying for back then was exclusivity and it was four and a half years in my life I'm very grateful for the experience but I'm very grateful now to be doing what I what I want to be doing and did not have the muzzle on well I'm definitely gonna ask you about some of where your political perspective was formed and also you know the areas of your career we've gone serious mainly the they changed my mind stuff so I'm gonna ask about all that in just one second first let's talk about change because this dude right here doesn't have any pants but he could use some pants because come the hell on it's just terrible in every possible way if you are looking for quality jeans that look great fit great feel great and used to cost you hundreds of bucks Matan bow has

gonna mention either they their pants my waist is 33 but after about like 36 or 38 pants because they're made for men without legs well I mean which as you can clearly see is not a problem Wow you know if if I like and I should have put a ring on it I said yeah who says I'm not wearing a second ring let's continue with your question on my worldview good Wow Wow so let's talk about where your values came from those solid family values that we are on discussing right here so you grew up in Canada which is socialist America where connect specifically Quebec so where where did your conservative values come from so I was always you know as a Christian family now you but you're never just born a Christian you have to decide at some point just I would assume is probably this I mean you're culturally Jewish or your ethnic gotta buy an in a certain plane you're gonna buy out exactly yeah some point either say this is what I believe or not and the same thing with with being a Christian so I was raised in a Christian household though and then I started working really young and so my dad told me about taxes it was it was really that simple and I found that almost everyone I really liked or enjoyed later on in life I found was a conservative like John Stossel I used to wait for his give me a break segments laughs after TGIF in 2020 like he where he would just just take a steaming one he just drop it all over something like New York liberals and I even know what a liberal or conservative was a kid please give me a break you know he talked to this head of Navajo Nation the white man forced me to live this way and he said but you're wearing jeans and as a kid I was like I want to be this guy now if I could merge him and David Letterman so I inherited all ways kind of an individualist and I had a just like Woody Allen I had a general problem with authority so I think that just sort of culminated in what you see before you bogel before you how did you decide to your show is really split in an interesting way so mine is based on serious material and then I'll stray every so often and make joke or do a weird impression that's usually pretty bad but for you because they shade that first part of getting help is admitting you have a problem they're not all that bad they're not all that they're not all that bad Trump sucks my Obama is okay okay they're not all that bad okay being imitated your faces so it's active think that's actually the imitations of you are really actually not very insulting no there's not like chanc Weger which you saw when I actually invaded shanks panel as I think it's like you're like I don't I don't know which one to shoot because like we fight a man named Lana but her both the same there was a point in never actually sat down and he was going okay okay and his own audience started laughing at him but the stuff he was you just yo you look young in a bitter woman and sound and you speak quickly yeah so sorry your question so the question was how do you when do you decide to stray into serious territory so the change your mind stuff has become extraordinarily me mobile so we've all seen the memes various be our own company has taken me put me behind that desk of you that picture of you behind the desk with your feet up with it with the change my mind about some weird thing that's a PewDiePie has made fun of it like legitimately everybody has made fun of it how did you where did you come up with that idea number one and number two that's a pretty serious segment there's there's not a ton of humor in that when did you decide that you were gonna do kind of more serious material along those lines well I you know humans owned by others have been hated by others but never do yes yes I know I know exactly what you're talking about um it's always been a mix you know that was one thing I hate you know I feel I don't want to be put in a box because the truth is people come to the show to laugh to be entertained but people also really enjoy I mean our rule on our show is I tell people if you're if we are creating content or if I create content that does not meet this criteria cut it tell me to cut it it either has to be well first up it always has to be entertaining and it either has to be informative or enlightening and informative means you know we're breaking news like with the people who wanted to stab supporters at the University of Utah remember that call until I'm like hey listen they handed out a knife to us and handing out you're like they're they're handing out ice picks yes Ben you're security can like what do you have like here's the footage they're like oh my god and that guy from Nightline was following you no interest in the story at all there's a knife and ice picks we have a deal with the FBI so it's always been a mix I actually think our show has led to more arrests or charges than any other conservative program accidentally because of the research that we've done we've just kind of fallen into because we stay in character um so change my mind though you know what's funny that's basically I was turned down by every major conservative publisher I think there might be one or two out there who didn't when I pitched a book and back then it wasn't called changed my mind but it's what it's what has become changed my mind and they remember them the words actually being spoken conservatives don't by comedy they don't by funny books they by Obama doomsday books at this point I think at that point the book Obama the Obama blueprint was like really big so that's what people really wanted to do and it just wasn't what I wanted to do is I don't know there's anything wrong with the book I'm an insulting the book it just wasn't changed my mind and so if one thing to you know you're very sharp you're very very smart and it's it's formidable for people to watch you in a debate but I know that a lot of people can watch you or even sometimes myself I've had people say why I can't do that no on a second actually yeah you can particularly when it comes to a conversation with somebody whose mind can be changed almost people who are left don't they they haven't yet rationalized their positions now it is also very different when you have a microphone and a stage and I do or we're on cable news it's a different dynamic and we're always saying then I just wish that we could sort of capture these conversations that we have with people you know when I get whether I'm getting my hair cut or I'm in an uber I'll have these conversations with people and it'd be completely unedited so that people could see it's not that hard to do that almost anyone can do it you don't have to win an argument you just have to know how to rationalize your position that's really what it stemmed from and it just happened to strike a chord it's the exact opposite of everything we've been taught in media and I know in podcasting though there's this pride in like we don't have any kind of prep or show map or anything and they just but then they've gone for our rabbit trails you know about duck genitalia or whatever the hell it is we pick a topic and we stick to the topic we make sure the people rationalize their positions so there is a direction with it it's not completely random and haphazard but it's it's very genuine and I think that a lot of people just appreciated I was antithetical to what we've no media I couldn't tell you exactly why it's worked as well as it has honestly that's my hypothesis so you know I think both you and I have been into space where we've both been very irritated by the sort of star genus of conservative media by the fact that so much of conservative media seems stuck in a rut unwilling to kind of move out of that right what do you think that rut is how do we define it how do how do you break out of it how do you think that the conservative movement can move past its images stodgy because I mean you know me I'm better stodgy human being as it's possible to be I listen to classical music I go to synagogue on a regular basis I go home my wife would you synagogue apparently I mean I mean when we're not planning world domination there's pretty stodg if you're in last name weren't Shapiro that would sound incredibly anti-semitic what then I would just say synagogue is so stodgy I hate those synagogue attendees well I mean I don't mean you go there for parties but it's like the raves going on at the synagogue it's not just a bunch of glow sticks on a rabbi but by the same token obviously the conservative movement has it feels yes er stodgy or provocateur ish those are the only two yeah those are the only two medium in which people tend media in which people tend to work right you've got like the malian A+ I'm just gonna say stuff to say stuff and piss people off yeah and then you've got the Paul Ryan let me walk you to death right how does conservatism find a middle ground that actually appeals to a broader swath of people well first off I know that you really hate those sort of The provocateur ship if that's the word just for the sake of it and I appreciate that you've delineate between what we do and people who just go out there and say something you know racist I appreciate that because I don't listen we could get in hot water and I know that you know our heart and where we come from and our goal is never to actually just to denigrate people or even even necessarily I did know some of them like Bernie Sanders that's fine but yeah you know it's it's here's a solution what you're doing and what I'm doing and I think it'll actually the closing segment on this week's show this Thursday if we see people all the time say won't somebody do something I mean how many rooms did we sit in with these underground organizations I think the cats out of the bag with that one we're like where's a conservative late-night you know where's the answer to The Daily Show and I was at Fox pitching the show that I'm doing for day in and out for four and a half years and I'm just saying no it's not gonna work they paired me up with a guy who was like he was like 90 years old with four year old kids like that's Old Testament Abraham but I don't know I'm so bizarre and he like had these ideas like a monkey on rollerskates and what it is is just people and this is true I know I'm trying to remember together my time there people say well what isn't some why don't we have this isn't someone going to do something just be the guy who does something we're doing the show that we wish we wished had existed people told me there was no market for it I'm very grateful for the market that there there is for it and every time we gain a new subscriber a new mug club member we've raised the ceiling and we really are just incredibly grateful I think there are two ways to handle success to either become to either exalt yourself or to feel genuinely humbled by the responsibility of how much it means to people and and that's honestly I like when I got off stage at SMU I remember walking in the bathroom in like like crying a little because for me as a kid stand-up that was kind of a dream come true to have you know 2,700 people roaring and cheering like for someone else that didn't mean a whole lot but for me that was something that I thought about ever since I was a kid and you go oh what do i do from from here you know how do i hang onto this and this also and some of these people were crying because you know they left the left Islam and now they couldn't talk with their parents or giving me their Navy Cross so I it's just be the person who does something we're doing the show that we wanted to do and I know that you for a long time listen you did a lot of AM radio and you you appeared on a lot of a stool I didn't yes in a lot in a lot of trench but you finally just I know that you're going why doesn't somebody do some I know behind closed doors sometimes people who are more high-profile respectful you think they're idiots and I know that you're like man I'm ten times smarter than that guy yeah you you you are but this is just the way the system works right now and now you're doing it and now we're doing it so I just think for people how does it change it changes with what we're doing and hopefully more people out there doing it I you know I don't see many been Shapiro's in the horizon there are a lot of people who are young and smart they're there's no one else out there as far as young comedians that's what kind of worries me for me to retire I would love to pass that torch to somebody there's just it's gonna be ten years before sort of someone's come as hell to get out 31 but I can't I can't do this for that long oh really okay so how long do you think here I would love I would love to be able to train someone up you know within 10 years and have someone else be doing the tired 41 now retired but be able to you know be able to help the next youngest what's your tournament so lately you just decide not to do this as often or you do it occasion well yeah well again because I was pitching this showed it like I'm sure you probably pitched books that got turned down well you all you're getting published at what seven years old and nineteen but yeah okay yeah but you didn't look a day past fourteen so it was that see that's what really counts but um I would love to be the person who said to a young steven crowder this will never work change my not mind is not a book that people want late-night comedy is not something that conservatives want I would love to be the guy goes okay kid you're you're talented let's see how hard you work at it and let me you know be it be a wind in your sails here I'd love to be able to do that eventually you know it's it's really not about myself because if it dies with me then it's all for for nothing unfortunately there aren't many conservative I don't even say comedians but entertainers out there you know because the system kind of like you said it breeds sort of young CNN crossfire air at Tucker Carlson look-alikes when you go to a lot of these conventions and that's changing now that's changing a lot you're seeing a very you're seeing a much more diverse group of people like when I went to speak it yeah you're seeing a lot of alternative well you know people there with tattoos and Mohawks are seen a lot of people who are not afraid to at least to at least explore their options so that's what's important to mean I would really love to see some more people coming up notes they've got to earn it I think this is right I mean there's a cultivated skill set and I've seen it even with you because I've known you long enough me I've known you for a decade so I've seen how even in the time we've known each other your comedy has really progressed to the point where I mean you were always good but now you're just terrific in a way that you weren't a long time ago and that is through cultivation of skill and effort and I feel the same way about my own career and I've been doing this since I was 17 which means I've been doing this for 17 years now and I feel like I've gotten better at it because you put in the time and you get better you've got in so many reps in yeah exactly exactly like at a certain point you you really have to cultivate a skill it feels like the movement spends an awful lot of time promoting people who have not actually spent the time cultivating the skill yeah if you if you either mouthed the platitudes or alternatively if you troll when these are these are the two paths to fame and glory in the conservative movement which as you say a bumper sticker or you say something really truly just to get attention right and then you are celebrated by the people who are glad that somebody said something offensive right that's not I think where the future is amendment lies that's where I'm inspired to see you do so well because there was a period like you and I both know there was a period not that long ago where we thought our careers were in doubt because it was just the whole kind of trolli or bumper sticker slogan we both I remember talking a new phone oh yeah these conversations like man I don't know if this is the end of this where it's it's a bumper sticker or just saying something outlandish but that's not what we do and we're not gonna change who we are so you know your success I always I always sort of that if I seriously lived through your success from like man that I'm glad to see that someone can do what Ben does because he's doing what he wanted to for a long time it is more substantive it is not what media used to be and guess what people have been craving it that means a lot to me one of my one of my favorite films like we talked about we're talking about passing the torch he was he the Shootist was John Wayne's last film yep okay so if we who don't know it's about you know sky who'd wants to live out his last day I think he has cancer or pancreatic cancer it was it's a young Ron Howard and is it's a Gregory Peck and their whose or is it Jimmy Stewart knows Jimmy Stewart and who's a woman is it a net I can't remember I don't know anyway but the point is he goes to this town he's this famous Shootist you know he's a shootout artist and he wants he wants to live quietly but unfortunately a young Ron Howard lets the word out that this guy is in town and everyone wants to take their crack at him and at this point John Wayne has a death wish he wants to die so at that point he goes out publicly to the saloon and he can see all of the guys there who are ready to shoot him and it's a very powerful scene for me because it's the end of the movie the end of the film and um there's a shootout and at a certain point actually he shot everybody but there's I think one guy left with a shotgun trained on him and he pauses because he knows he could let this happen and he wants to die but instead he turns out and shoots the guy and finishes his drink and he's it's kind of melancholic and it's because he wanted to be taken out but he wasn't gonna give it to me and that's kind of how I want there to be someone else eventually but it's got to be someone who same thing I'm sure with you as you get older when you were tight it's got to be someone who you can entrust with what we've built and I think also it's a big space and I hope there are a lot of voices in it so I say I hope that you're wrong and that you're continuing to do this after you know after the age of 41 because come on but I just don't want to have to but okay so you have one more question for you I wanna hear your greatest fear for the country and your greatest hope for the country but for our
