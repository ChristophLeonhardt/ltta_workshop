1
00:00:00,941 --> 00:00:02,209
WHO REFUSE TO DO WHAT IS

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,276
NECESSARY TO SECURE THE

3
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:04,378
HOMELAND.

4
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:05,645
AND THAT'S THE ANGLE.

5
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:11,451
JOINING US NOW WITH REACTION

6
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:12,285
THE AMERICAN IMMIGRATION

7
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:15,155
LAWYERS ASSOCIATION.

8
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:17,891
ANATASIA I'M SURE YOU DISAGREE

9
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:19,860
WITH WITH A LOT OF WHAT I SAY.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,428
I'LL JUST LET YOU COMMENT.

11
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:22,996
>> AS I EXPLAINED EARLIER A

12
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:24,931
LOT OF THE COMMENTS ARE ON THE

13
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:27,634
POLITICAL CLIMATE ON ECONOMICS,

14
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,903
I'LL LIMIT MY COMMENTS TO THE

15
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:32,305
IMMIGRATION LAWS, AND HAPPY TO

16
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:36,243
DISCUSS THE POLICIES AND HOW

17
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,045
THOSE ARE --.

18
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:39,679
>> SO YOU'RE TELLING US WHAT

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,814
YOU WON'T TALK ABOUT SO LET'S

20
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:44,117
TALK ABOUT WHAT, WHY THERE'S

21
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:45,752
BEEN, AND I THINK WE HAVE A

22
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:47,521
GRAPHIC, A 10-FOLD INCREASE IN

23
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,556
THE CLAIMS FOR ASYLUM COMING

24
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:51,491
OUT OF THESE NORTHERN TRIANGLE

25
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:54,361
COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY

26
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:54,961
HONDURAS.

27
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:58,598
REQUESTS INCREASED 10-FOLD

28
00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:00,534
BETWEEN 2009 AND 2016.

29
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,069
WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS?

30
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:03,003
>> AGAIN, I MEAN THERE ARE

31
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:04,404
ISSUES IN THOSE COUNTRIES,

32
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:05,705
THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL

33
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:06,706
UNREST.

34
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,042
THERE HAVE BEEN JUST

35
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:14,147
TRADITIONALLY, THERE WERE AS A

36
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:15,982
RESULT OF DEPORTATIONS A LOT

37
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:17,884
OF THE PRISONERS THAT WERE IN

38
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:19,653
GANGS IN L.A. AND WERE

39
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:21,588
DEPOURED HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE

40
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:23,623
OF POLITICAL CHAOS IN THE

41
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,092
COUNTRIES AND WERE ABLE TO

42
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:27,661
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SYSTEMS,

43
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,497
WHICH LEADS TO VIOLENCE.

44
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:32,666
WE SEE A LOT OF THE ASYLUM

45
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,634
SEEKERS ARE WOMEN, AND

46
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:35,035
CHILDREN --.

47
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:36,069
>> A LOT OF THEM AREN'T.

48
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,605
A LOT ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN

49
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:40,607
AND VERY SYMPATHETIC AND WE

50
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:41,541
WANT NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS

51
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,043
TO HAPPEN TO ALL PEOPLE WHO

52
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:44,511
WANT A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR

53
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:45,512
FAMILIES BUT THE QUESTION IS,

54
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:48,115
UNDER OUR CURRENT LAW, AND

55
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:52,018
YOU'RE AN EXPERT AS AN

56
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:53,720
IMMIGRATION CASE WHEN I WAS A

57
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,988
DEFENSE ATTORNEY BELIEVE IT OR

58
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,858
NOT BUT THOSE LAWS REQUIRE AN

59
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:59,059
INCREDIBLE FEAR OF PERSECUTION

60
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:01,294
YET IN THE SURVEYS DONE, OF

61
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:03,263
THESE MIGRANTS, IN TRANSIT OR

62
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:04,865
WHEN THEY'RE BEING DEPORTED

63
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:08,401
BACK HOME, THEY OVERWHELMINGLY

64
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,203
STATE THEIR CONCERN IS AN

65
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:11,638
ECONOMIC ONE, AND YOU CAN'T

66
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:12,672
BLAME THEM.

67
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:15,408
IT'S HARD TO MAKE A LIFE IN

68
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:17,811
GUATAMALA OR EL SALVADOR.

69
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:19,713
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN BOTH

70
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:20,113
COUNTRIES.

71
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:21,081
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRIES

72
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:21,982
WITH ROTTEN GOVERNMENTS BUT

73
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:25,952
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION

74
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:27,154
WHERE WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF

75
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:28,155
THOUSANDS OF CASES BACKLOGGED

76
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:33,793
IN THE IMMIGRATION COURTS AND

77
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:34,828
FRANKLY WE'RE OUT OF PERSONNEL

78
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:36,863
AND MONEY AS FAR AS PROCESSING

79
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:40,133
THIS SO HOW WOULD YOU BALANCE

80
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,635
THOSE CONCERNS OF THE UNITED

81
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:43,436
STATES, WITH OUR OWN HOMELESS

82
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:45,005
PROBLEM, OUR OWN VETERANS ON

83
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:48,275
THE STREET PROBLEMS, OPOID

84
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:49,709
CRISIS, OVER CROWDED SCHOOLS,

85
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,578
WITH THE DESIRES OF FOREIGNERS

86
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:53,613
WHO COME HERE FOR A BETTER

87
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:53,914
LIFE.

88
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:56,249
>> I MEAN I THINK EARLIER YOU

89
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:58,718
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

90
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:01,755
CORRUPTION IN HONDURAS AND THE

91
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:04,090
DEMANDS PUT ON THESE OFFICIALS,

92
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,927
AND I THINK THAT WHAT IS

93
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:07,928
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN ALL OF

94
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:10,931
THIS, IS THE RULE OF LAW, IS

95
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,332
DUE PROCESS.

96
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,166
WHERE AMERICA, THE

97
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,067
CONSTITUTION IS VERY STRONG.

98
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,536
WE HAVE VERY CLEAR GUIDANCE

99
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:21,608
AND RULES ON WHAT WE ARE

100
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:22,676
EXPECTED, WHAT WE EXPECT TO

101
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:24,611
GIVE AS FAR AS LEGAL PROCESS

102
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,646
AND PROCEDURE, SO THAT IS

103
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:27,814
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK

104
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:29,616
WE SHOULD COMPROMISE ON, AND I

105
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:30,884
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PICK AND

106
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:33,086
CHOOSE WHO GETS DUE PROCESS.

107
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:35,555
THE FUNDAMENTAL PART OF OUR

108
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:35,989
CONSTITUTION.

109
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,324
>> RIGHT, WELL IT'S A

110
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:39,192
FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN FOR

111
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:40,093
AMERICANS THAT WE HAVE BORDERS

112
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:41,995
THAT ARE ACTUALLY ENFORCED,

113
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:44,631
AND LAWS THAT ARE NOT GAMD BY

114
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,967
ATTORNEYS WHO GO DOWN TO

115
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,969
MEXICO OR CENTRAL AMERICA AND

116
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,204
LITERALLY COACH PEOPLE AS TO

117
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:52,739
HOW TO MAKE THEIR CASE AND

118
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:53,540
MAKE THEIR CLAIM.

119
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,679
IT GOES FROM REPUTATION TO

120
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,114
ADVOCACY FOR POLICY CHANGE OR

121
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:01,848
ENTRANCE INTO THE UNITED

122
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,450
STATES DESPITE THE FACT A LOT

123
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,051
OF THE LAWYERS DON'T KNOW MUCH

124
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,519
IF ANYTHING ABOUT THE

125
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,487
BACKGROUND OF THE MIGRANTS.

126
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:09,522
I WANT TO PLAY A SOUNDBITE

127
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:11,224
FROM THE HOMELAND SECURITY

128
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:12,359
SECRETARY ABOUT WHO ELSE IS

129
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:13,460
TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS TO

130
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,927
AMERICA.

131
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,362
LET'S WATCH.

132
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:17,363
>> BORDER SECURITY IS NATIONAL

133
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:17,797
SECURITY.

134
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:19,399
WHAT WE SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF

135
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,602
HOMELAND SECURITY, WE SEE 15

136
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:23,670
TERRORISTS EITHER PLANNING

137
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,171
TRAVEL OR ACTUALLY TRAVELING

138
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,040
TO THE UNITED STATES EACH DAY,

139
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,375
KNOWN AS SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.

140
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,743
THAT MEANS THEY'RE COMING

141
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,611
THROUGH OUR LEGAL LAND PORTS

142
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:33,513
AND AIR.

143
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:34,681
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT

144
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:35,682
THAT?

145
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:37,784
THAT IN THESE CARAVANS, I MEAN

146
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:38,818
AGAIN IT'S A DROP IN THE

147
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:40,453
BUCKET COMPARED TO THE

148
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:42,055
THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF

149
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,490
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PROCESSED

150
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,458
INTO OUR COUNTRY SINCE LAST

151
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,794
OCTOBER, BUT IT'S THE VISUAL

152
00:04:47,794 --> 00:00:00,000
IMAGE I THINK THAT GETS A LOT
