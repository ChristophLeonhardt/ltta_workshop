whoa no way let me tell you about aspiration doctor you go to the head of the line by going to aspiration calm slash tyt you don't have to wait on the wait list there's free access to ATMs all across the world there's no monthly service speed I know just gets better ten percent of the revenue goes to charity I mean it doesn't get any more Lib than this and no funding of political campaigns or industry lobby so if you were looking for a progressive place to put your money I think we've got your answer for you aspiration com HR McMaster is likely to be ousted from the White House and he could be gone as soon as next month he is the national security advisor for Donald Trump and they have had a tiff or two over the Russia investigation and so as a result you know how Trump is if he doesn't feel like someone is being loyal to him that person's job is on the line according to reporting as early as next month in a move orchestrated by chief of staff John Kelly and defense secretary James Madison HR McMaster could be gone more most recently McMaster told a forum in Germany that Russian meddling in the election was incontrovertible and Trump did not like that in fact immediately after he tweeted the following general McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted by or changed by the Russians and that the only collusion was between Russia and crooked H the DNC and the Dems remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the Podesta Company okay so by the way of course most of that tweet is not true ok Muller did not conclude that there was that the election was not impacted he never said no one's concluded that and it's also in my opinion impossible to conclude that one way or another yeah so when I saw this news story I was a little surprised because I didn't realize McMaster was in this kind of trouble this so I even further when I first saw the headline assume that McMaster was pulling the chute and was like I gotta get out of here this place is a mess wouldn't blame them for that it by the way it is not normal for people to leave this quickly and from the administration and by an over and over and over again Primus and Spicer and smoochy and Bannon and McMaster etc so in the case of McMaster you taken over from Mike Flynn who of course has now pled guilty to perjury and his cooperating with a special counsel so just note for the record any other president Republican or Democrat Obama Bush Clinton if their national security adviser had been convicted and pled guilty it would be the biggest scandal of their administration right so and we're just like breeze past it like oh the former national security adviser is going to prison anyway so this national security adviser what did he do I mean he's not going to prison or anything like that it's certainly not anything as bad as Flynn so it turns out no he's not leaving voluntarily in fact they said they were talking mattis and John Kelly about McMaster is a good guy let's find him a soft landing so he's being thrown out and so they're trying to figure out what part of the military can we sneak him back into so we can get three stars or maybe even four stars and then retire with some degree of grace eventually etc right so why is he being kicked out it turns out just for saying that the Kalusha was incontrovertible that's it that apparently put Trump in a rage and he's like that's it I want him gone I want again but we do care how he's actually doing his job is he a good national security adviser has he helped you with foreign policy no he once said one sentence in public that by the way is true and everyone else in politics agrees to accept Trump and he's like that's right because of the he it's his ego ego it was obsessed with people feeling as though his election was illegitimate and it was influenced by foreign government that he didn't earn it he's obsessed with that and so yeah but Anna it's not just the ego you you're absolutely right he's so since skin I've never seen any person like this let alone a president or any official but it's also that he's in a panic over this in station if you can't see that you're trying not to see it right and so one of his top officials says one sentence he doesn't like about the investigation it's a third rail he's gotta go he's got to go by the way hope aches now gone and it turns out the trunk was in a rage that she said that everyone suppose she had to tell white lies to the president that's part of the reason she's leaving after the eight hours of testimony that she gave in the house and and that also touches on the investigation and they asked her about the investigation for eight hours she says one little thing that he doesn't like she's God how many people can you bury before you got no allies left so okay so this is my perspective this is speculation whatever but I always try to even if it's someone that I really don't like like Donald Trump I try to put myself in their shoes and try to think about how I would react if I were in his position now look I I do think that there was meddling by Russia we've had this discussion a million times I'm not gonna get into that again but let's say if we gave him to vent the benefit of the doubt and that it was a witch-hunt and that people Democrats primarily just want to get rid of him and this is what they're holding on to as a way a strategy to get rid of him if you feel like it's a witch hunt and then you have members of your own administration make comments that could even that could be interpreted in any way as attacking you or agreeing with the critics like I would be furious so if I was under investigation like that and someone here made a comment like McMaster did and I'm not really guilty of anything yeah I would I would be insanely angry about it it's like come on I need people on my team you know this is a witch-hunt who's on my team so that's me giving him the benefit of doubt but with that said it's the way he reacts that makes me agree with you that he's afraid right cuz he always goes to their Russia had no impact where she had no impact and then they're not forthcoming they lie about things and they get caught up in their lives it's just it's all very strange if he was forthcoming from the beginning if members of his administration were forthcoming from the beginning and he didn't react the way that he does react in those tweets then I don't know I would know you Ana you're being way overly generous to him I know you're trying to but so he's not a normal employer so first of all if he was normal important so let's say me right so Jimmy doesn't agree with me on Russia and and he and he said that right yeah if I were like oh I'm in a rage or hey I'm firing it right okay I'd be I'd be an ass right so but but that again would be whatever that's your run a company that's your choice you have whatever you want to do right but he's the president and that's the National Security Adviser for you to fire a person whose job is to protect the country because you didn't like what he said about you in one particular sentence that's cuckoo for cocoa puffs I know look I agree with you overall I agree with you I'm just trying to provide a different perspective I don't know why just for the sake of the conversation but one other thing I want to add look um maybe Trump just doesn't see the need for a national security adviser I mean he doesn't like national security briefings he doesn't think it's important he doesn't pay attention he spends all his time tweeting and watching cable news I mean obviously I think it's important to have these advisors but he doesn't value these people because it's not about Trump so he doesn't like North Korea's doing X yeah you know Afghanistan is doing why where's the word Trump in these sentences he doesn't care about the country he doesn't care about your security all he cares about is his own orange ass and then finally John Kelly just said right before we came on air you know he was running homeland security and when though all the shake-up happened at the White House he went over became she was staff and he's like man I that was a that was the dream job I wanted that job that was just to keep people safe and that's what I built my career for he's like so but we I wound up as chief of staff because I guess god I must have done something wrong and God wanted to punish me he said that yeah okay so now chief of staff is a much higher position the chief of staff is next to the president it's probably as important as it gets because he controls the President's agenda since Paul you know helps to set policy couldn't be more important for him to say God punished me by making Trump me Trump's chief of staff he's like where's the shoot where is the shoot I gotta get out of here he's gone yeah and by the way that Trump's gonna be furious about that Oh can't wait for the tweets okay so you'd be amazing right now the only reason why he might not immediately fire him is because that wasn't about the Russia investigation specifically right so it didn't touch his you know third rail but guys overall Hicks McMaster at Kelley trying to find a way get out that's why he criticized Ivanka Trump the other day saying she was playing government over at the Olympics with the North Koreans you know what's happening what I told you was gonna happen it's devolve evolving way quicker than people anticipated and like this it's like falling apart at the seams we're going on like oh it's no big deal this is one of the stories today I now McMaster is gone and hope Hicks is gone these are giant players in the administration any other administration that has the communications are right there and the national security advisors are going back-to-back days you'd be like oh my god what the hell is going on it's absolutely exploding I know that we got used to the explosions and the insanity but um this is a quicker pace it is devolving soon Kelly will be gone and then you'll have complete pandemonium and soon after that president pence okay you need to relax they totally disagree with you all right let's see what happens okay oh wait you're disagreeing with me so you're fired
