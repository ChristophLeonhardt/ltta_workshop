1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,770
The protests in Ukraine
that began in 2013

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,420
not only toppled
the government,

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,220
but also yielded countless
eyewitness videos.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,510
Day after day, protesters
and bystanders filmed

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,440
the rallies in Kiev against
Ukraineâ€™s president,

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,940
Viktor Yanukovych.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,140
They filmed attempts
by security forces

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,760
to break apart
the tent city

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,820
that was built 
in Independence Square,

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,850
and the clashes 
with masked police

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,320
that reached a violent 
tipping point months later.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,700
On Feb. 20, four police
and 48 protesters were killed

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,380
in one of the bloodiest hours
of European conflict

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,290
since the Cold War ended.

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,770
Now four years later, 
these videos

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,400
are being presented as
critical evidence against

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,960
Ukrainian policemen who
stand charged of killing

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,210
these protesters.

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,570
Working with incomplete 
ballistics evidence

20
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,270
and amid rumors and denials
about what happened,

21
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,450
prosecutors hoped that
a forensic analysis of the videos

22
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,440
would prove their case.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,560
They enlisted the help
of SITU Research,

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,510
an architectural firm in Brooklyn
with expertise in video forensics.

25
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,110
SITU analyzed hundreds
of videos assembled

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,880
by Ukrainian graduate student
Evelyn Nefertari to recreate

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,760
the shootings in
painstaking detail.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,130
First, they built a virtual
replica of Instytutska Street,

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,850
where most of the
protesters were shot.

30
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,040
Laser scanners
were used

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,190
to accurately reconstruct
the fine detail of buildings,

32
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,950
sidewalks and trees.

33
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,030
And they modeled
barricades and debris seen

34
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,890
in the videos of that day.

35
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,920
Videos show the Berkut,
a Ukrainian paramilitary force,

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,330
retreating along the street
from clashes with protesters.

37
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,400
The Berkut are wearing these
distinctive yellow armbands.

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,170
They take a position 
behind these barricades.

39
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,430
We'll focus here on the death 
of Ihor Dmytriv, a 30-year-old lawyer

40
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,160
who had joined the protest the day before.

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,840
He was with this group
of protesters, protected

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,000
by helmets and
homemade shields, who

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,820
followed the Berkut.

44
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,380
Moments later, he
was fatally shot.

45
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,950
His shooting was filmed
by three cameras, which

46
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,040
helped SITU determine his
precise position and that

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,903
of the cameras.

48
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,330
By analyzing the
sound of the gunshot,

49
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,200
experts approximated the
distance of the weapon

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,400
from the cameras, and
using their 3-D model,

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
analysts froze the
victimâ€™s exact position

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,850
when he was shot.

53
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,560
They marked the
entry and exit wounds

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,670
described in the
autopsy report

55
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,570
to indicate a
direction of fire

56
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,120
within a few
degrees of accuracy.

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,520
Overlaying this cone of
fire with the audio analysis

58
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,650
gave the experts an
approximate location

59
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,130
of the shooter.

60
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,690
Next, they examined
videos filmed

61
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,250
on either side
of the barricade

62
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,260
at the time of the shooting.

63
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,430
One shows the fatal shot and
a white puff of smoke rising

64
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,890
near the barricade.

65
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,030
And this is security
footage recorded

66
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,320
behind the barricade

67
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,580
within a minute
of that gunshot.

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,480
It clearly shows Berkut
police aiming and firing

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,890
at protesters

70
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,650
where experts say the
fatal shot was fired from.

71
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,770
Investigators repeated
the analysis for two

72
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,240
other victims.

73
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,320
Lawyers hope that
by making order out

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,220
of the chaos and
disinformation surrounding

75
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,270
that day,

76
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,530
this innovative analysis will
stand up to cross-examination

77
00:03:21,530 --> 00:00:00,000
in court.
