thank you I'd like to congratulate a really great World Cup one of the best ever from what everybody tells me one of the best ever and also redeemed itself doing so well I watched quite a bit in the United States we call it soccer and I want quite a bit of it and I watched the entire follow and the seventy finals and they were really spectacular games but it was beautifully done but congratulations on there most importantly we have a lot of good things to talk about and things to talk about we have discussions on everything from afraid to military to missiles the nuclear to chop traffic we'll be talking a little bit about China our mutual friend President Xi I think we have great opportunities together as two countries that frankly we have not been getting along very well for the last number of years I've been here not too long that it's getting close to two years but I think we will end up having been saying and I'm sure you've heard over the years and as I campaign that getting along with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing and I think the world wants to see us get along we are the two great nuclear powers we have 90 percent of the nuclear and that's not a good thing it's a bad thing and I think we hopefully can do something about that because it's not a positive force it's a negative force so we'll be talking about that among other things and with that the world awaits and I look forward to our personal discussion which I think begins now and then we're going to meet our whole team you have quite a few representatives on how to do and we all have a lot of questions and hopefully we'll come up with answers most importantly it's great to be with you thank you very much thank you thank you everybody
