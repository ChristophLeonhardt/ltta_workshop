we're here with the Nissan new mobility concept this is Nissan's vision for what we may need to drive around the cities in the future it's a small electric car has a top speed of 25 miles per hour and go 40 miles on a single charge it seats two one behind the other and I'm about to go try it out in Manhattan we're at 22 miles an hour 23:25 I got it top speed 25 got I love that electric motor torque man electric motor torque alright unfortunately these cars aren't for sale right now Nissan is conducting trials in San Francisco as with a little bit of a city bike sort of setup they have going on so hopefully this car makes it to market at some point but once it does make it to market let's get some windows windows things not particularly fast and it doesn't you know it isn't a great handling car but it's likable so this thing's got small tires unfortunately that means you feel every bump every pothole and in Manhattan it's a lot of potholes yes traffic jam sort of what this car is built for try the gym it's electric it doesn't waste gas it just sits here that's okay
