there's been a lot of hubbub over the Trump administration's treatment of the Michael Wolfe book so Michael Wolfe go recall is this journalist who's kind of sketchy I remember during the Bush administration there was a journalist named Kitty Kelly and Kitty Kelly came out with a couple of that were very gossipy about what had happened that one was about the Bush administration and others about the JFK administration and it was all very gossipy it was very hard to pack down what was true and what was false and it sounds a lot like Michael Wolf's book is the same way basically he was given large-scale access to the West Wing apparently by Steve Bannon who allowed him in and just let him sit on the couch outside the West Wing and as Wolfe says the West Wing is very small it is I've been there it's a pretty small area and the and they're constantly people of note walking by and so wolf would you sit there and then he would sort of buttonhole people and ask them questions and then he writes this book and this book is filled with kind of juicy anecdotes stuff about how Trump would make his own sheets he didn't trust other people to do his sheets and how he would eat KFC because he was afraid of being poisoned and how he would watch TV endlessly and fulminate about his aides and how he would just go crazy on a routine basis how everybody around Trump thought that he was a moron and a crazy person and how they would tell the public that he was a genius and then secretly they would tell Michael Wolfe that he was adult and all of this kind of stuff so what to believe in what not somebody first of all don't believe everything that you read in Michael Wolf's book as I said earlier I think that it should have been subtitled as told by Steve Bannon because it's pretty clear that Bannon is the guy who was spilling his guts to Michael Wolfe it was Ben and who just got blown up for spilling his guts to Michael Wolfe suggesting that all of his enemies in the White House were guilty of criminal conduct during the campaign that's what has led President Trump to go all-out against Steve Ben and now so he released his statement about Bandhan nuking him two days ago yesterday he came out and had the White House attack Bannon said that Breitbart should probably fire him sarah huckabee sanders was asked specifically whether Breitbart should consider a consider firing ban and here's what she had to say we were eager to call on ESPN to fire one of his sports casters for crew size President Trump and it wasn't just criticizing it different it should Breitbart part ways with Steve Batman after your comments in these books I certainly think that it's something they should look at and consider Brian thanks he said a couple things here number one of course the Trump administration feels this way second is it appropriate for the Trump administration to be dictating to an private news organization what exactly they should be doing with their own staffing the answer is no I opposed it when they when they told ESPN they should fire Janelle Hill or suspend rimmel Hill I feel the same way about ban and even though I think Bannon is is a turd of a human being I don't think that the White House should be telling private organizations how to run their business on the other hand since Breitbart is basically the press adjunct to the white house I guess that they can fire people who are in-house so I suppose the day they have a case to be made that they can fire Steve Ben and from the White House considering that it was basically just the press outlet for the Trump campaign during the campaign itself Bannon has not only lost the support of the White House he has also lost the support of the Mercer's first of course he lost the support of President Trump so very late last night President Trump slapped out at sloppy Steve over allegations in the book he said quote I authorized zero access to White House actually turned him down many times for author of phony book I never spoke to him for book full of lies misrepresentations and sources that don't exist look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and sloppy Steve okay first of all great nickname again second slow clap in two days for President Trump this is an excellent nickname this one goes up in the in the treasured Halcyon and the treasured wing of the Hall of Fame of Trump nicknames Raymond there's a little Marco and there's low-energy Jeb and sloppy Steve is really high up there I mean that's that's that'll stick that'll stick because Steve is a sloppy guy in a variety of ways so that is good stuff from Trump Trump came out today and he said that the Mercer's made a good move by getting rid of sloppy Steve so he's just gonna keep banging on this drum Bannon for his part is trying to kowtow before Trump which makes sense since the Mercer's came out and slammed ban and the Mercer's if you don't know are a very the number one funding family for the for the Republican Party essentially and they were the number one funders of President Trump during his general election cycle Rebecca Mercer is the is the woman who is largely responsible for deciding where the Mercer family money goes and she said I support President Trump and the platform upon which selected my family and I have not communicated with Steve Danon many months that have provided no financial support to his political agenda nor do we support his recent actions and statements that's a pretty rare statement from Rebecca who apparently tends to be rather reclusive in in public her father had disassociated from Breitbart and from Bannon back in early November so they've been basically cutting off ties for weeks now with Bannon there's a report that they've even cut off the funding for bandhans private security team so he's basically been isolated at this point has Bannon and that of course has led him to one conclusion he must hang on at Breitbart right it's the only thing that matters to Bannon right now he has to hang on at Breitbart if he loses his perch at Breitbart he's done as a human he no longer has the ability to get in good with Trump right the idea I think for Bannon is if I hang on long enough if I just hang out here long enough then at some point Trump will bring me back in the fold but Corey Lewandowski or Sam Nunn Berg or a bunch of other people I'm not sure that's the case I think that once you've burned your bridges with the with the president's children like all of them then you're going to eventually reach the point where there is no way for you to avoid being blown out basically I think that maybe or abandon is but Bannon feels like if I just stick around a Breitbart long enough and then something bad happens to Jared and Ivanka legally then I'll rush back in and Trump still has my phone number if he's no longer a Breitbart that's no longer an option so he's trying to hang on with the skin of his teeth Larry soul of who is Andrew Breitbart old business partner and best friend Larry refuses to get rid of Bannon is is my impression from the outside I don't have any inside information on that but if I had to guess that would make a lot of sense it was Larry who brought in Bannon in the first place out of I think personal weakness but in any case I'm the idea that he's gonna dump man and by the side of the road is unlikely I think the Mercer's would have to force the issue so Bannon is trying to hang on the way he's hanging on is basically by kowtow into Trump and then hoping that Trump bats off of him so here was Ben and yesterday after all these quotes come up about how Bannon thinks that Trump is a crazy person and is going to either be impeached or resign and how his children are all criminals now he comes out he says no no no Trump's wonderful Trump's great so he hears Bannon on Sirius XM radio I know because I know at least one person who listened to it which was apparently their entire audience so here here we go President I States is a great man you know I support him day in and day out whether going through the country given the Trump miracle speech or on the show on the website so I don't think you have to worry about that but I appreciate the kind words okay so the idea that he has been supporting Trump day in and day out is sort of bolide by the fact that he let this reporter into the White House who then proceeded to savage the White House from every conceivable angle so this brings us to the actual nature of the book the actual nature of the book it has a lot of problems the book is fire and fury again it is a it is a deeply gossip ridden account and there are a lot of problems with the book itself it has all of these sort of weird anecdotes and you don't know where their source - because wolf doesn't have any endnotes is my impression he doesn't say this is from my conversation with Steve Bannon in in the West Wing or this is from my conversation with Jared Kushner or this is from a conversation with Mike Pence it doesn't have any of those footnotes there's no way to tell what is true and what is not in these accounts but we know already and there are some things in this book that are just not true right we know there are accounts that are simply false there are certain descriptions of people that are just not true and in just a second I'm going to tell you about some of the instances in the book that are clearly untrue I mean I can personally attest to them being untrue in just one second but first I want to say thank you to our

the book that is not true in the michael wolf book fire and fury which is soaring on the bestseller charts here's about how we know their stuff that's not true so number one it says in the book that donald trump didn't know who john bainer was or the Speaker of the House that in conversations Trump had no clue who Boehner was when he was recommended as it possible is a possible chief of staff that's ridiculous I mean Trump has golfed with John Boehner John Boehner was the Speaker of the House for the first four months of Trump's presidential run basically the idea that that Trump that Trump has no idea who Boehner is is is really hard to to hold to scrutiny beyond that it's also ridiculous to suggest as the book does that Stephen Miller who is one of trumps top aides one of his speech writers can't put together a sentence I mean the guy did go to I believe Duke Law School if I'm not mistaken no Stephen did as well is not only that Stephen was also a Stephen is a policy wonk so there's an accusation that Stephen Miller is not in fact a policy wonk when it comes to immigration I've spent hours talking with him about immigration the idea that he is not a policy wonk is just asinine Miller didn't go to Zoopla rather he went to Duke itself so he's a smart enough guy to go to Duke which is a top college the idea that he can't write a sentence is silly there are other claims in this book that are being called into question there's a claim that Sean Hannity expressed his willingness to let Trump review questions in advance Hannity said that he never did that I don't know whether to believe that or not the interviews were friendly enough I don't think Shawn would have to do that right I mean Shawn could basically just hit a Trump listen I'm not gonna sandbag you and Trump would agree because Shawn would never stand back Trump so I'm not sure we'd have to actually offer to supply the questions another one of trumps top advisers and Friends Thomas Barrett said or the president he's not only crazy he's stupid but Barrett denies have her ever having made the comment the British publication claimed that the wolf book says that Tony Blair former British prime minister warned Jared Kushner during the campaign that British spies could have the campaign under surveillance but Blair calls that report a complete fabrication so here's what it sounds like Michael wolf did when he put together this book it sounds like Michael wolf basically sat in the hall and listen to Steve ban and tell tall tales around the campfire while roasting marshmallows and eating s'mores and then when they were done he just wrote down everything Steve ban and said and then he said you filter it out you the reader it's your job to try and determine what's true and what's false so you get a sort of ambiance of what like in the white house with all the chaos and all the craziness but it's not necessarily true that every individual story is true if that's the case then there's not much to the book and the truth is I'm not sure there's much to the book anyway just because I believe a lot of the tenem general tenor and tone issues that the book raises I believe that Donald Trump is not Phi Beta Kappa when it comes to policy I don't think the Donald Trump is is necessarily the most stable personality I mean but I thought all of that for the last two years I mean I've been saying that for years at this point I'm not sure how you look at his Twitter account and figure that this guy is is a is a Washington is a Washingtonian character it's like George Washington in his Stalinist in stalwart US like I just don't I don't see how you would possibly come away with that by watching Donald Trump for any lengthy period of time so what does the book add the answer is the book really doesn't add much at all except for a bunch of accusations by Steve Ben and that the media want to take seriously for purposes of trying to destroy Trump which of course is why Trump is going directly it Steve Bannon and directly and why Donald Trump should go directly it Steve Bennett right abandon is the guy who wanted to turn this into a self aggrandizing homage to him and it was a direct fail and I think that that makes you know I think makes perfect sense that Trump decides that he asked to strike back now the way that Trump strikes back had ban in which I think is correct is very different from the way that Trump strikes back at the book Trump is now participating in what we in the internet world called the Streisand effect so a few years back Barbra Streisand the legendary singer and crazed liberal she was she has a house on the beach down in Malibu and there was an environmentalist photographer who had taken some aerial photos of the beach and it included her house now you never would have known that it was her house it didn't label her house didn't have an arrow that said Barbra Streisand's house it was just a picture that included Barbra Streisand's house and the point of the photos was not to show where the rich and famous lived the whole point of the photos was to show coastal erosion right so the entire series posed by an environmentalist guy it wasn't by some right winger who was trying to stake out Barbra Streisand's house while she's selling feelings in the background that was not the idea here well what Barbra Streisand did is she got so mad that she sued the photographer for something like five million dollars there's something crazy she sued the photographer for an enormous amount of money claiming that he had violated her privacy rights while in launching the lawsuit she then made clear where was she lived so suddenly the photo which had been been viewed I think a grand total of like seven times ever by anyone was viewed by 1.5 million people people flooded onto the internet to see the pictures of Barbra Streisand's house and what she would be so touchy about that she'd sue some Rando for millions of dollars for exposing the photo well bana Trump basically did the same thing with this book so the book was gonna get coverage but Trump could have said all the same things I just said right Trump could have said listen Steve Allen's a piece of garbage and falsifies a lot of stuff this book is driven by Steve banners agenda but the book is full of falsehoods and we're not gonna talk about it anymore right we're just gonna leave it at that the books full of falsehoods we're done it's full of a bunch of crazy stories Steve Bannon has an agenda he's self driven he's garbage and everybody would have cheered and that would been the end of it because by the way Steve Bannon is garbage if I haven't made that clear already for the last few days so or for the last two years for that matter with that said and that's not what the Trump administration decided to do so Trump unleashed his lawyers on the publisher always a bad move he sends a letter to the publisher saying you are going to pull this book or I am willing to see you for defamation no okay so as I'm putting on my lawyer hat defamation against the President of the United States is not a thing okay winning a defamation suit as the President of the United States is not going to happen you are a public figure you're the ultimate public figure and even and I'm not sure he could prove anything that was maliciously and willfully false which is the actual statement you have to prove malicious maliciousness right like willful and malicious and his stefan defamation for a public figure that's the standard they willfully knew something was false and you maliciously published it anyway that is not going to happen for the President of the United States particularly since most people are going to believe a lot of the allegations that are in the book anyway including I would I'm sure members of the jury so that was stupid by doing that he basically handed a win to the author of the book again this is the problem with with trumps major a tendency to go after anybody who slaps him is that it puts him in weird positions where he's actually elevating the people who are slapping him now I think he could slap down Bandhan pretty safely because Bannon used to work for him Bandon was the barnacle on his butt so anytime Trump wanted to slap him he could write Trump could just destroy him with a single swipe and that's essentially what Trump has done it's a different thing when you're talking about a media member and it isn't great policy to have the president of the united states suing individual member of the media for the stuff that they write it's just not if Obama had tried to do this about Edie Klein for example the entire write would have gone nuts and I think rightly says so yeah I think that's bad policy by Trump I think that it's it's over the top go after Steve Bam and by all means since he's the one who's actually the leak he's the guy who's actually telling all of these tall tales out of school but going after the author who you allowed to sit around in the White House for day after day after day apparently for months that seems like a big mistake to me and again it creates a Streisand effect where suddenly like last night in DC there were people who are waiting outside bookstores at 12:15 at night for the early release of the book so the book was actually pushed up for days and the publisher released the book four days early specifically so that they could gain all of the all of the sales from all of the attention so that's something that from ought not to have done you know issuing a cease and desist to Bannon with with a violation of the NDA then non-disclosure agreement as I said yesterday that there's actually a legal case for that there's no defamation legal case for President Trump against Henry Holt and publishers against Michael Wolfe this particular author even though the author I think is making things up even though and or at least repeating tales that he has not bothered to verify Woolf by the way says this openly that this is not his style but he doesn't actually he doesn't actually verify the anecdotes that he's told he just sort of spills it out on the page and just assumes that everything is true so that is not called journalism that's just you being a tape recorder and that's essentially what Michael Wolfe did so is this gonna do lasting damage to the Trump administration that a lot of people say oh it's a bombshell inside the Trump administration just a bombshell is it though is it really do you really think that members of the Trump administration are gonna use their power members of the Trump cabinet or gonna use their power under the 25th amendment to suspend Trump from service for 60 days and then kick it to Congress where Trump will actually be impeached which is the actual process under the 25th amendment do you really think that's what's gonna happen here because it ain't gonna happen okay nobody in the West Wing is going to launch an impeachment move against Trump on the basis of he's crazy people knew who Trump was when they voted for him and people refused to believe anything that they don't want to believe I was talking with Andrew Klavan and with Michael Knowles yesterday or rather I was not my business partner Jeremy was and both Clavin and Knowles were insisting that this is all 40 mega mega mega chests and I'm just telling you it's not but if you want to believe that it is you're going to that it is so people are still believing about Trump what it is they want to believe about Trump and that being the case none of these new anecdotes are gonna change one single mind not one single person in the United States who didn't think Trump was already crazy is going to change their mind and not a single person who thought that Trump is brilliant is gonna change their mind based on Michael Wolf's book so the idea that is a bombshell that really ruins the administration you Kevin Williams it had a good line about this right you can't take down Trump with this kind of stuff for the same reason that you can no longer assassinate Abraham Lincoln right Ambra hem Lincoln's already dead right Donald Trump cannot be taken down by this stuff because people who perceive him to be crazy already perceived him to be crazy people who perceive him to be saying already perceived him to be saying he is what he is in my view right I don't think that he's the world's most stable guy I don't think that he has the character of a president that I would prefer but I will enjoy all of the policy wins that he's brought and I can live with that cognitive dissonance everybody else should learn to to and that's just the way that it works okay so I'm going to move on to Trump and pot in just a second I know that's not my recommendation that we all smoke weed to get through the next three years of this or the next seven years of the case maybe but before I get to that I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at blinds calm so you're looking around your house and you know it looks shabby but you don't know why well I'm gonna tell you why it's not just that you're in the

again use that promo code Ben so that everybody knows that we sent you okay so a big policy change or a sort of big policy change happened yesterday and all of the pot smokers and threads of pot smokers are just up in arms at the Trump administration or as I said earlier they are too busy staring at their own fingernails and finding them fascinating but when the pot wears off and before they've been able to re-up then they will be very very exercised about all of this and then presumably they'll eat a pizza smell tomorrow weed and go back to sleep but in any case okay when I make fun of people who smoke pot folks it's not because I think pot should actually be illegal it's because I think you're stupid if you spend all of your time smoking pot okay just that I think you're stupid by the way if you drink yourself into oblivion too but in any case here's what actually happened Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday rescinded is according to CNN a trio of memos from the Obama administration that had adopted a policy of non-interference with marijuana friendly state laws there's something called the Cole rule okay under the Cole rule it basically said Jim Cole was the former Deputy Attorney General the whole idea here was that the Justice Department was going to let the states do what they wanted to do it was it was sort of the equivalent of daca so if you remember deferred action for childhood arrivals program was Obama saying I'm going to use my prosecutorial discretion to instruct the DOJ not to actually prosecute cases for the so-called dreamers that's what daca was the executive amnesty well the Cole rule was basically the same thing for pot distribution so the move now from Jeff Sessions essentially shifts federal policy from the hands-off approach adopted under the previous administration to unleashing federal prosecutors across the country to decide individually how to prioritize resources to crack down on pop possession distribution and cultivation of the drug in states where it is legal so while many states would decriminalize or legalize marijuana use here in California they've decriminalized marijuana use and the that has obviously made California just a more wonderful place to live it was already wonderful and now just made it a more wonderful place to live so that everybody on the streets is smoking pot and the homeless people who live right outside your house can now get high in their spare time in any case the drug is still illegal under federal law which creates this conflict federal and state law now let me make my own position very clear on this I'm in favor of decriminalization of marijuana I have been for decriminalization of marijuana for years I believed the federal government and the state government spend far too much time and effort trying to go after marijuana and they do a terrible job of it it should still be heavily regulated for use under the age of 18 there is serious damage that is done to teenage brains by repeat use of marijuana the argument as to whether marijuana is a gateway drug is not exactly settled you know people have said it's not a gateway drug they sell that's just a myth the data on that are really mixed when I say they're mixed what I mean is that the vast majority of people who use heavier drugs did start off by using marijuana but it's not clear whether those people just had a tendency toward drugs in the first place and that drove them to use both marijuana and then have your drugs or whether they started with marijuana and they said I'm breaking the law anyway but I'm not getting high enough so now I'm gonna try heroin right that's not it's not clear exactly how that worked in any case that is it that's an argument that has not been fully debunked is the is the gateway drug issue but as somebody who's in favor of individual sovereignty and your capacity to make your own decisions as an adult including stupid decisions without government intervention I'm in favor of marijuana decriminalization I'm I'm more split when it comes to harder drugs that are more addictive things like heroin or things like cocaine there I tend toward legalization even for those drugs the truth but when it comes to things like angel dust or LSD that have actual externalities where it's gonna cause you to act in violent ways it actually changes how you act toward people as opposed to you just get high and you stay in your room all day and you and you drown in your own vomit like that seems to me that's mostly in a problem but if you are actually gonna get high and then go out and kill a child then yeah and then the drug makes it more violent it makes you crazy and hyper you know then then that's a different story that's my basic take on drug legalization and decriminalization with all that said the sessions is now reversing this Obama era rule so he said this is a return to the rule of law but he didn't go as far as some advocates worried that he would he didn't direct more prosecutions so here's what session said in a memo he said quote in deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute under these laws with the department's finite resources prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions these principles require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations of the crime the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution and the cumulative effect crimes on the community so naturally the media goes absolutely insane over this how dare Jeff Sessions he's done something terrible look at him now he's just going he's reading the drug war and that's all that this is okay that's not really what happened here as I say the Cole memo was this directive to federal prosecutors that basically said that the drug was still illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act but federal prosecutors could focus their resources elsewhere so long as the states didn't threaten other federal priorities such as distribution of drugs to minors and targeting cartels that's what the Cole memo did that's now been overruled the Attorney General rescinded the Cole memo and marijuana prosecutions directed that federal marijuana prosecution decisions be governed by basic principles of law so a bunch of people in Congress are alarmed oh no the DOJ is gonna come after us if that's the case I have an idea change the law right here's why sessions is actually correct so sessions is correct even if you agree with decriminalization of marijuana as I do sessions is not wrong the reason sessions is not wrong is that we have something called the executive branch the executive branch's job is to as you may have guessed execute it is their job to execute the law it is not their job to rewrite the law at will it is not the job of the federal executive branch to simply decide as Obama did that we're not going to prosecute entire classes of crime because I don't like the law or if that were the case then I would hope to get elected president and they just I would spend zero of the dollars allocated to me by Congress I just wouldn't do any of it I would just nullify everything the legislature did that's not what the executive branch is there to do if Republicans in Congress and Democrats in Congress have enough of a problem with pot policy from the DOJ maybe they should change the law maybe they should just get rid of the provisions governing marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act and let the states deal with it considering it's mainly a state problem in the first place I don't know why the federal government is really involved in any of this this came to a head and in a Supreme Court case called California v Raich in his back in 2003 in which there was the the federal Controlled Substances Act came up for a view before the Supreme Court because the state of California wanted to allow medicinal marijuana and the federal government was coming in to wresting people and people in California were saying well we haven't committed a federal crime right we were not involved in interstate commerce we're just growing marijuana to use ourselves right we're growing marijuana to use it in state and the Supreme Court wrongly in my opinion ruled that the state of California could not do that that it was a Supremacy Clause question that they were overruling the federal government I disagree with that decision I disagree with the federal government getting involved in these issues in the first place but it is not the job of the executive to nullify federal law it's the job of the legislature to change federal law that's basically what sarah huckabee Sanders said yesterday and I think that she's basically correct the president believes in enforcing federal law that would be his top priority and that is regardless of what the topic is whether it's marijuana or whether it's immigration the president strongly believes that we should enforce federal law the move that the Department of Justice has made which my guess is what you're referencing simply gives prosecutors the tools to take on large-scale distributors and enforce federal law the president's position hasn't changed but he does strongly believe that we have to enforce federal law okay so his basic idea here is that the only thing that matters in the end is that is that the executive branch does with the executive branch is designed to do which is to execute the law so just so there's no question that this is correct right this is this is basically correct no matter what you feel about marijuana so it's time for Congress to change the law I will say I think it is hilarious have left has responded to this and the left doesn't care about federalism in any other setting they don't care about states rights in any other setting they're anti they're actively anti states rights in every other setting like against it Cory Booker however says that this is an attack on our most sacred ideals like really this is what he says and so this is an attack on our most sacred ideals and the very purpose of the Department of Justice was just to protect Americans to elevate ideals of justice and to do right by people it is a failure of this administration who said as our president did during his campaign that he would honor what states are doing it's a betrayal of our Attorney General who gave a commitment to a Republican at least one looking member of this body but most significantly it is hurting it will hurt America you know her America it's our sacred principle that people should be able to smoke dope pretty sure that that was not actually a sacred principle like for anyone but apparently for Democrats babies in the womb not take red-hot sacred I'm glad that we now know the priorities this is this is exciting okay so we are going to get to the mailbag I also want to discuss this new FBI

SoundCloud iTunes YouTube subscribe leave us a review we always appreciate it we are the largest most most popular fastest-growing most incredible conservative podcasts in the nation yes every week feels like three it's just that much news and going on in any case the FBI has now launched a new investigation into Hillary Clinton the right of course is celebrating wildly that this is happening listen I think that if she did something she should go to jail I think she should have gone to jail for what she did in her exposing classified information in order to protect herself through her private server with that said I'm a little uncomfortable at the precedent that's being said that we are now going to spend years prosecuting prior administrations because if Trump thinks this is fun now if he loses in 2020 things are going to get extraordinarily dicey extraordinarily fast like Eric holds our here's the reality Trump DOJ isn't doing anything wrong by investigating Hillary because the holder DOJ was never going to investigate Hillary what we now live in a kleptocracy where the ruling cadre gets to prosecute the top prosecute its opposition and protect itself from prosecution right Eric Holder is responsible for Hillary Clinton getting off the hook that's the reality Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch are responsible for Hillary Clinton getting off the hook so Trump going back now and looking at this again or sessions doing it that would be in accordance with the rule of law but just be aware that when powershift and a will again republicans will not rule forever there will be some time in the future near or far at which democrats take power a lot of people are going to be put under the gun of the DOJ again because once you start using the DOJ as your personal tool to take revenge against your enemies things could go wildly wrong in any case the Justice Department has launched a new inquiry into whether the Clinton Foundation engaged in pay to play politics or illegal activities while Hillary served as Secretary of State FBI agents from Little Rock where the foundation was started have taken the lead in the investigation they've interviewed at least one witness in the last month law enforcement officials said additional activities are expected in coming weeks the officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity said the probe is examining whether the Clintons promised or performed any policy favors in return for largesse to their charitable efforts or whether donors made commitments of donations in hopes of securing government outcomes dissolve from the hill so one witness has said that the FBI is is acting an extremely professional and unquestionably thorough manner it will be interesting and fascinating to watch the same left that has been praising the FBI up the wazoo because of the Trump Russia investigation now flip and insist that it is politically driven so I'm looking forward to that very much again we'll have to wait to see what comes out from all of this my inclination is to believe that the FBI should have prosecuted Hillary the first time around in James Comey botched the investigation and did so in purposeful manner with all of that said it is not good that all of our politics is now caught up in the hands of the DOJ and the FBI and that's due largely to criminality but it's also due to the fact that the DOJ and the FBI have become politicized tools which is one of the reasons why Republicans are kicking back against Robert Mueller Steve Scalise the the House Majority Whip he came out yesterday and he said that the special counsel the the Mueller is now in question that his legitimacy is now question is we're now gonna play politics with every aspect of the federal government because we don't trust I think rightly so the DOJ or the FBI so Steve Scalise will challenge robert muller and presumably within the next five minutes the democrats will challenge the FBI here is your Scalise a plus you've seen through our oversight by the way in the house you've seen an exposure of what I think is a lot of corruption and real concerns that have been raised about the special counsel in fact just the credibility of the special counsel is very much in question because as you mentioned so many of the people that Mueller brought in are the people working on that we're very anti Trump in the campaign and still to this day I mean you can't have people in the Justice Department working on an investigation who have a predisposed all of this is a mess by the way because now that now the accusation is that Jeff Sessions over at the DOJ the accusation is that he was actually trying to lead a PR campaign undercover against James Comey even as he's recused himself from the Russia investigation in the middle of February and April and March and April so just yuck all the way around the DOJ in the FBI I've been politicized we don't trust them and so the the lack of trust in our public institutions continues to founder until we get into the business of electing politician it's really our fault we have to stop electing politicians who are corrupt and then using the FBI and the DOJ is to check on our own stupidity that's not going to work because the DEA and the FBI are guess what politicians okay time for some things I like and then some things I hate and then the mailbag so things I like today will only do one thing I like because we have to get to the mail back the thing that I like today is a biography that I'm reading on Johannes Brahms Brahms of course one of the great composer of all time and it's really illuminating very lengthy bogging for my chance Wofford and the the book really delves into who Brahms was a person Brahms really had an eye toward his toward how he perceived by future historians he burned a lot of his papers he didn't want people delving into his life Jennifer does a really good job of checking that out I don't have enough pronounced Jeon it might be on Swofford in any case he he does a very good job of delving into all of the details of Brahms biography so if you're into biographies of musicians I am we did Beethoven a couple of weeks ago this biography of Brahms is considered the classic so Jen or Yuans Wofford it's called Johannes Brahms a biography check it out okay time for some things that I hate okay so we'll begin with this idiotic suite that has 250,000 likes on Twitter okay it's a picture of the Doug Jones who's the Democratic the new democratic senator from Alabama and his son who happens to be gay and in Doug Jones his wife who is swearing in Doug Jones into the Senate and Mike Pence is standing there presiding over it because as the vice president he is the guy who presides over the Senate so Doug Jones is standing there and the gay son looks like he is giving side-eye to Mike Pence supposedly okay and Tareq Norman tweets photo of the decade Doug Jones being sworn in while his openly gay son quietly disintegrates the soul of Mike Pence this is so stupid for so many reasons number one if you think Mike Pence has never met a gay guy you are a moron okay Mike Pence is the vice president of the United States is the governor of Indiana I'm sure he's worked with gay people I'm sure he's friends with gay people the idea that Mike Pence has never met a gay person is just asinine beyond that this meme doesn't even make sense look at the guy's eyes he's not even looking at Mike Pence he's looking at his mom in this photo right the angle of the photo makes it look like Tim big us it is not ambiguous look at his eyes he is looking at his mother because his mother is the one who was swearing and his father at this point it's just but but again the people aren't so driven by confirmation bias that they want to believe that that Mike Pence is somehow threatened by the openly gay son yeah right I'm sure that's the case yeah good good job guys okay other things that I hate so there's a website called Mike it is a stupid website and Mike cuts a bunch of videos and ikmi see they cut a bunch of videos usually about sexuality in the most sort of abhorrent and the sensationalistic fashion they cut a video yesterday about sis men liking trans women it's a bunch of trans women meaning men who believe that they are women and some of whom have had surgery and makeup done to confirm this they are complaining that men when they find out that they actually have penises or our biological men are unhappy about this and that means that men must be afraid of their own masculinity so try to follow the logic here if you're a man who doesn't want to have sex with a man who has made himself up to look like a woman for the objective world and I'm not getting into their head maybe you believe you're a woman doesn't matter bottom line is does a man have a right to say I'm not into a penis and like is that is that okay still apparently not apparently this makes you gay so if you're a man who doesn't like a penis you're gay now I'm very confused by all of this here's here's the mic video it's it's not good the idea is that a guy dating a trans woman makes them gay than what you're basically saying is that a trans woman it's not a well okay stop it there for a second the I'm not saying that this person is quote-unquote playing dress-up I don't know what this person's mental condition is okay I would suggest this person is suffering from a delusion and I wouldn't suggest that that is a fact this person is suffering from a delusion this person is not a woman okay this person is not a biological woman this person may believe they're a biological woman they may believe that are very feminine man they may believe they're a trans woman that's not the same as a biological woman okay it's not that a man is the the guy who is looking at this person and saying that's a man and I'm not sexually attracted to that or the guy who initially takes a look before realizing that that's a man okay there's nothing that is wrong with that either morally or in terms of sensitivity dictating other people's sexual proclivities I thought was off the table a guy was until five minutes ago I would say I thought it was stay out of my bedroom now apparently it's get in my bedroom or you're a sexist right get in here right and take a look at this yeah no that's not the way that this works okay you don't get to dictate to anybody else how they act this is my problem with a lot of what's happening in the radical trans movement is not that these are people who are just saying leave me alone to live my life I'm fine with that do whatever the hell you wanna do you wanna get a surgery that's your problem you're an adult you want to go out and have hormone treatments I don't think it'll be great for you that's your decision anyway I'm not your doctor that's your problem go for it right I'm completely libertarian on this but it is my problem when you're suggesting that somehow I am NOT secure enough in my own masculinity when I say I'm not into your penis okay stop this is not logical it doesn't make any sense it's ridiculous it's it's actually rather tyrannical and it cuts counter to the entire privacy movement that you guys are trying to establish or you guys to or girls well whatever okay the whole thing is just silly and so we can play a little bit more of this chit but you're ready to pause it okay am twenty-fourths have been certain sis men who I find I like the showers random guys they know they're even in this shot their approach to trans women specifically is a very dismissive approach I think that their view on us is that of a weak boy they don't really see us as women so now you're so now you're a weak boy you understand they're challenging the masculinity of guys who don't want to have sex with guys hey Adam Carolla I had I had a line in in in I think it is his first book where he says that we're eventually gonna reach the point where we challenge the masculinity of boys who are not secure enough in their masculinity to be gay I remember Lee gonna say to young boys that if you want to show you a real man and that you're securing your masculine go over there and kiss another guy that'll show how secure you are in your masculinity like that's that's the way this is going we're pretty much there we didn't have far to go okay time for the mailbag let's just go to the mailbag because I can't do any more than alright so mailbag time Evan says dear Ben you say your son is young Tarzan do you think you will let him do self-defense like jiu-jitsu or Krav Maga when he gets older yes I hope he does it's one thing I wish I'd had growing up because I was smaller and slighter than the other kids in class I was also smarter and so this made for some bullying I wish I had known how to defend myself better so I could have beaten some people off that'd been good I canyon says dear Ben regarding foreign policy if you had to pick would you rather see America adhere to the principles of the monroe doctrine or the Truman Doctrine if neither of those completely satisfy you what would the Shapiro doctrine entail so for those who don't know the monroe doctrine basically suggests that the united states is going to keep the western hemisphere free of european influence of the Truman Doctrine says that we are going to defend democracy around the world anytime a democratic regime is threatened by non-democratic regime we're gonna back the democracy none of these completely satisfied me because I don't think that America's foreign policy interest ended in South America Latin America in Canada and the Truman Doctrine which suggests we have to defend democracy as a chief priority as opposed to America's liberty interests I don't think that that's exact enough I think it's a little too wilsonian for me so what I would say is that America's foreign interests lie in preserving our strength and our morality and that's a balance because they're going to be times when we have to preserve our strength by not being able to overthrow a regime that will cost us enormous amounts of time and treasure and men and blood but we will be strengthening them we will be strengthening the world if we stay strong right it's it's sort of the principle that if somebody is drowning you you have to make sure that you are not going to drown also at the same time so that you can save other people like there's the there is a balance here that I don't think has really taken into consideration with regard to the hardline Truman doctor I mean they're they're not like Hamas was elected by democracy is that a regime that we now have to defend I don't think so Rjay says dear Ben do you think it'd be a fair trade for Republicans to agree to amnesty for dreamers in exchange for an end to chain migration Eve Arif I plus the abolition of anchor babies well I mean I think that I'm not in favor of amnesty for dreamers as a blanket I think that amnesty for specific people who are in the country illegally and our benefit to the United States is the solution I don't know why I can't advocate for all of these things if you ask me would I make that exchange if that were the choice on the table right in the end to chain migration Eve Arif I let's say the wall and abolition of anchor babies I would probably say yes because that would now change the system so dramatically that you'd actually have a cut-off point but I don't think that that's what's on the table rachel says hi Ben I have three degrees but left academia to start a business with my husband the last time I went to dinner with old friends we all men someone living or dead with whom we'd like to have dinner I said Winston Churchill without exception everyone else at the table said Michelle a Barack Obama these are smart people well first of all I quibble how can so many academics be so stupid where politics are concerned well the answer is when you spend your entire life in a bubble you tend to believe that the only people who are worth talking to are the people who are sort of at the upper echelon of the bubble that's Michelle and Barack presumably you know the world's greatest and most beautiful and wonderful people again I quibble with the idea that I'll use Denis preggers model here I don't think that just because you're smart you're wise and obviously rains don't necessarily translate to your knowledge of values to wisdom or to any sort of historical knowledge 100 says haben my question is how and when should the welfare state be reformed and why hasn't the Republican and why haven't the Republicans initiated any new legislation regarding this so my understanding is that that's what they're trying now is that the next thing they're gonna try is a welfare reform that creates new work requirements for welfare I think that would be great I think that needs to be attempted as soon as possible I think welfare should also be devolved to the state level in federal welfare should basically be dismembered Nate says with your rising notoriety you seemed to have increasingly become the target of hit pieces and attacks obviously you don't have time to respond to them all how do you choose which ones to take on and how difficult is it to just ignore the rest well Nate that's a good question I would love to respond to all of the attacks on me and and the stuff that I do and right I have to determine sort of what the time investment is I have other things in my life so it's it's a balance between how quickly can I respond and how many people have read the hit piece am i elevating the hit piece that's full of falsehoods by even responding to it or is the thing just so damn long then I don't have time to pick apart this and then get into a mano a mano fight with some idiot who doesn't understand the points that I'm making and that's also the question once you respond to somebody then they respond to you and it turns into a firefight is that something worthwhile a Tracy says I watched your discussion with the Aruban thought it was great he does say one thing on which I have a question you stated you didn't see why the US would get involved in Syria's you didn't see what the u.s. his interest was there but you also described the US as the most moral force on the planet so we not have a moral interest in preventing an oppressive regime like Assad's from committing genocide and murdering his own people wouldn't you say that's a moral obligation thank you for considering my question I'm a new subscriber in a bit of a fangirl I appreciate it so here is my answer my answer is the same as it was earlier which is if we can do it without it costing us very much then we do it if we have to go in there with boots on the ground and tremendous expenditures of time and resources we have to determine how that fosters our interests and how much it sucks us dry right so if if that could pressure button now and the genocide in Syria you would I would everybody would but if the question is are we gonna send 20,000 troops in there to take out Assad or a hundred thousand troops in there to take out Assad and occupy the country is that something where America really has an interest is that is that something that we can do and this is a serious question to consider because there are awful horrible humanitarian crises happening around the world we have to determine as a country what the balance of costs and effects is in each of these tuitions you know the worst the the the atrocity the more America has an interest in stopping it for sure but we also have to take into account what exactly the class will be do we get sucked into another prolonged war in the Middle East where we really have no solid interests outside of presumably stopping Assad who fosters terrorism but not in the same way as Iran for example like if you had to change a regime and spend American resources doing it you'd have to start with Iran and then move on to Syria since Syria's a client state of Iran Morgan's you still prefer do you prefer still or sparkling water sparkling that is the answer for anyone of say in mind Eimer says are you more conservative than your father um you know hard to tell I would say that my dad is more conservative socially than I am probably I am more conservative than he is probably fiscally but I would say that my dad has he's new I would say that as I have you know taken a more prominent position and studied more my dad sort of gets his reading list from me a lot on politics so I'll read a book and I'll pass it on to my dad so his views tend to mirror mine in a lot of ways but not in every way Bru says what's the deal with red states receiving more federal dollars than blue states receive my liberal friends say blue states support the red welfare states how can I respond well the answer is get rid of federal welfare and won't be a problem the reason red states received more money than blue states on average is because there are more people in red state more poor people in red states and then blue states and they're also more military bases in red states than blue states so on a per capita basis more people are receiving aid in red states and blue states but it's not the red states that are voting for the federal welfare programs you dolt if you don't want to spend all that much money on red states I have an idea don't do it right guess what the red states agree they're not the ones who are voting for the additional welfare programs more in says dear Ben as a native from Massachusetts and a Fenway Park security guard I'd love to know your opinion of David Ortiz in the Boston Red Sox in general so I was for most of my childhood a Boston Red Sox fan secondarily I was a White Sox fan primarily and then a Boston Red Sox fan secondarily because I picked up all of my father's allegiances and he went to college in Boston with my mom well my opinion on David Ortiz is that he seems like a nice guy I am almost certain he was doing steroids you know it's amazing to me that he's been able to get away with with being the one guy who's sort of allowed to do it and everybody sort of knew he was doing it again this is opinion not allegations of fact so you know I I went from hitting 20 home runs a year for the Minnesota Twins to hitting 50 home runs a year for the Red Sox I don't think that sort of stuff just happens overnight plus he shared a doctor I believe with with was it Alex Rodriguez or poo holes in any case I am a big Red Sox fan I was I went down to Fenway Park and stood outside Fenway Park when they won the World Series in 2004 I like everybody else in Boston at the time stayed up all night watching the games with the Yankees so I'm a Red Sox fan and and load the Yankees a Jeffrey says been the Hebrew hammer Shapiro I credit Andrew Breitbart righteous indignation is my awakening tax to have tremendous respect for Andrews career it's a great book he seemed like he gifted an unique man I also admire you and your approach to the issues however my admiration of both of you has led me to be confused as to why Android elevates deep down into Breitbart news when you know Steve to be such a terrible guy why dad no Breitbart seemed to like Ben and back when he was alive all you implore him now was this an error in judgment by Andrew the answer is yes and it's also true that the relationship between Bannon and Breitbart was wildly exaggerated in the aftermath of Andrews death I spoke to Andrew you know before I worked there I spoke with Andrew Babb and I said who is this who is this guy because he was occupying some office space there's some abandoned office space and that was how they knew each other was Bannen was working on a documentary on Andrew because this is how abandoned ingratiates himself with powerful people as he try oh I'll make you famous with my documentary he did it with Palin you know Dick Morris he did with Michelle Bachman he's done with a wide variety of figures in any case there was a Andrew was occupying the office space and I said who's this Bannen guy he said but bannon's okay he's just kind of I said are you close to me said no I mean the answer was no he was not very close with Steve the exaggerated closeness with Steve was created as a mythical aftermath to Andrews death when Larry so loved was looking for somebody to take over the company and Steve made a strong push for it and Larry decided to make him the the chairman of the company I don't think that Andrew elevated Steve at Breitbart news I think Larry elevated Steve at Breitbart news Steve wasn't even working at Breitbart news until Andrew died he literally had no job at Breitbart news until after Andrews death so do I think Andrew made an error in judgment by bringing Stephen to the fold I do so I think that Andrew would have elevated Steve to anything remotely resembling this position no I think that's I think that's absurd Thomas says prior to the election you said you would say that our nation was a train headed for a cliff Hillier would greatly increase the speed of the Train Trump would slightly increase it would decrease the speed do you still feel this way and if so what's his President Trump needed you to turn the train around well I think that in one way he has in his decrease to speed dramatically in one way he is increased the speed so he has decreased the speed toward which we are heading toward the fiscal cliff with his regulatory policies what's really gonna kill us in truth is the entitlement programs those are just going to murder us and the entitlement programs are not only not gonna go away under Trump they may grow under Trump there's an article today in which Trump was asking why there can't be Medicaid for all so you know I think that we're still heading toward the cliff it's just a lot slower than it would have been and a lot slower than I thought it would be in one way we have elevated the speed of the Train and that is the the partisan politics and the hatred in politics has elevated to such an extent that if Democrats are elected again in the near future the blowback is going to be ridiculous right the only permanent changes that Trump has made are the courts and the tax cuts everything else can be reversed by the Democrats and it will be and not only will it be they won't go so far to the left that it will be wild it will be just insane and that's because of the partisanship that is that has been elevated and promulgated and pushed really really hard Chad says hey man I'm a longtime fan have you ever lost a political debate or in your opinion would you say your opinion was changed during a debate also I'm calling BS that you can benchpress 200 pounds Crowder will back me on this I know I can actually bench press 300 pounds I can't do it like a ton of times but I can bench press 200 pounds it has my opinion ever been changed during debate not during a debate I would say but I've there are many debates where people will give me facts that I haven't thought about before and I'll go up and look them up and see how that changes my opinion I would say that there are a couple areas in my career where I've changed my opinion pretty significantly I think legalization of marijuana is one of those and we talked about that today Christopher says I'm in the military and with the new policy that will allow transgenders to serve alongside me I will be forced to use pronouns in which I disagree including it functions outside of work they'll include our families such as Christmas or holiday parties like you I don't want my children to be confused I prefer to sacrifice myself on behalf of my children I feel like the sacrifice I make every day is enough and asking me to do what comes along with this beyond what I've conveyed is too much yes I could avoid these situations but milestones like me advancing to the next pay grade I don't want to have to exclude my children what should I do or how would you handle this well I mean I'm sorry that these are the rules that the military is pushing I really hope that Madison does it I hope that Trump undoes it and the courts that are something to stop this are acting way outside their brief I think it's absurd that the government should have any policy cracking down on your basic right to say whether someone is a male or a female it's just crazy it's just insane but if that's the policy of the military then I can't choose for you what to do I would say that we still need men and women serving in the Armed Forces and that you should use all of your power outside government in order to try and drive a try and drive a change in policy that will make you free or Jeffrey says Durbin do you think Abraham Lincoln was right to throw away civil liberties like habeas corpus temporarily during the Civil War to save the Constitution in the Union really difficult historical question I do wonder if Lincoln actually had suspend habeas corpus in order to win the Civil War or whether that was an overkill move by the president during a time of war that that happens a lot I mean that's not to blame Lincoln or say the Lincoln wasn't making a considered decision in light of the evidence but in retrospect there are lots of times during war when we go in virtually every time during war when he go overboard the Patriot Act was overextended during the Iraq war the the internment of the Japanese during World War Two was egregious the attempt to prosecute people under the Espionage Act by Woodrow Wilson was egregious every time there's a war there's a tendency to go overboard in how that war is Perez prosecuted and I think that suspension of habeas corpus difficult for me to believe that was completely necessary for Abraham Lincoln to do okay one more question final question okay final question Nick says I'm a 26-year old conservative who happens to be gay I get a lot of crap for being against gay marriage despite being gay when asked why I explained why religion has helped me moved to a good place morally over the last five years and how I stand for what I find morally good and I can say from personal experience the gay lifestyle has been a very negative an immoral one for me then I'm then I get told I'm bigoted because I hold the religious views in a political light do you know a better way to argue this and am I wrong for thinking this way when when do you as a person separate your religious beliefs from politics I don't think I can win it is a question of morality I don't think you have to separate your religious beliefs from politics and I think the attempt to do so is foolhardy the reality is we live in a judeo-christian system that was built on certain values those values are reflected in our politics now do you have to make an argument that is aside from religious Scripture in order to convince people yes is that the area where debate yes because I can't just argue from the Bible to somebody who doesn't believe in the Bible it doesn't make any sense and we're not operating from operating from a common framework of a fact I think that you can make a very solid case for the opinion that you have based not on the Bible but based on public policy and the value of marriage and the value of man-woman relationships for the upbringing and raising of chair of children and and serious problems in a certain aspect of certain types of the gay lifestyle more promiscuous aspects of gay lifestyle for example I think you can make a fine secular argument against all of those things I would recommend those are the arguments that you make as far as the implication that you're a bigot because you hold certain religious views I would suggest that anyone who calls you a bigot because you hold religious views that don't impact anyone else though those people are the actual bigots in the situation okay we have reached the end of a nearly endless week but don't worry we'll be back here on Monday and surely the world will still be on fire so we will see you then with the fire hose I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our
