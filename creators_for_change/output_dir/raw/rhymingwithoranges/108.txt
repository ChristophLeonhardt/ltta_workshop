00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,060
committed to setting out the tough

162
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,160
choices we are prepared to take so that

163
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,350
we can balance the country's books as

164
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">well as saving money by scrapping the</font>

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,190
renewal of the Trident nuclear

167
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,670
stop to the plans to introduce

168
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,790
nationwide identity cards which will

169
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,220
save the country a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money as well</font>

170
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,360
they also claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they've found armed</font>

171
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,460
15 billion pounds that they can save in

also committed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cutting spending but</font>

174
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,710
only when the economic climate is right

175
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,100
for it saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably be</font>

176
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,790
in 2011 or 2012 they want to introduce a

177
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,640
bank levy so that banks are can pay back

178
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the money that they received from the</font>

179
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,840
taxpayers their ultimate goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> being to</font>

180
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,210
break them up unto ultimately get them

181
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,190
lending again if I'm one hundred percent

182
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,620
honest economics is not my strong thing

183
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,310
I was rubbish at maths in school um so

184
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,930
if anybody wants to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more depth</font>

185
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,900
um in terms of their economic policy

186
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,790
then you can find a link to their

187
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,940
