1
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:09,262
>> President Trump: I'D LIKE

2
00:00:09,263 --> 00:00:10,130
TO THANK ANOTHER MAN WHOSE

3
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:12,566
PRINCIPAL LEADERSHIP HAS EARNED

4
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:16,069
A WIDESPREAD ADMIRATION.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,703
CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY

6
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:20,040
COMMITTEE, SENATOR CHUCK

7
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,074
GRASSLEY.

8
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:21,575
THANK YOU, CHUCK.

9
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:24,911
[APPLAUSE]

10
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:26,046
>> Martha: THAT JUDICIARY

11
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:28,048
CHAIRMAN WAS AT THE CENTER OF

12
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:31,952
THE STORM, WHO TODAY SPENT HIS

13
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:33,954
FIRST DAY IN THE ROGAN ON THE

14
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:34,287
COURT.

15
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:36,657
I SAT DOWN EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE

16
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:39,660
SENATOR IN THE VERY ROOM WHERE

17
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,094
KAVANAUGH AND FORD'S DRAMATIC

18
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:43,697
TERROR TESTIMONY PLAYED OUT.

19
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:45,832
GRASSLEY HAS SEEN 15

20
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:46,933
CONFIRMATION HEARING SINCE HE

21
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:48,669
JOINED THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

22
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,870
BACK IN 1981.

23
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:52,839
HE HAS NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,140
THIS.

25
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:55,976
>> LAST NIGHT THE

26
00:00:55,977 --> 00:00:56,977
PRESIDENT THANKED DEAL AT THE

27
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,478
SWEARING IN.

28
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,312
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRINCIPAL

29
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:01,281
LEADERSHIP AND HE SAID THAT YOUR

30
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:01,982
HANDLING OF THE CONFIRMATION

31
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:03,784
EARNED A WIDE SPREADING

32
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:05,886
ADMIRATION, BUT THIS WAS

33
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:07,854
CHALLENGING FROM THE GET-GO.

34
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:10,891
WHEN HE BEGAN THE FIRST HEARING,

35
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:11,658
KAMALA HARRIS AND CORY BOOKER

36
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,127
BOTH WANTED TO DEREGULATE RIGHT

37
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:15,128
OUT OF THE GATE.

38
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:19,332
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I'D LIKE TO ASK

39
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,201
QUESTIONS BEFORE I PROCEED.

40
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:23,637
>> I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE MYSELF

41
00:01:23,638 --> 00:01:26,173
OR ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES.

42
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:42,656
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS INCREDIBLY

43
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:43,223
POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENT.

44
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:43,957
>> IT'S VERY DIVIDED, BUT DON'T

45
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:44,624
FORGET AT THE GRASSROOTS OF

46
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,325
AMERICA IT'S DIVIDED AS WELL.

47
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:46,293
IF YOU WANT CONGRESS TO REFLECT

48
00:01:46,294 --> 00:01:47,494
THE GRASSROOTS, YOU SHOULDN'T BE

49
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:50,630
SURPRISED IF SOME OF IT

50
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:54,668
PERMEATES UP TO THEIR GOAL.

51
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:56,903
HOPEFULLY IT IS A BETTER EXAMPLE

52
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:59,272
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE

53
00:01:59,273 --> 00:01:59,639
SITUATION.

54
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,874
WHERE I STARTED OUT WAS TO MAKE

55
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,776
SURE THAT WE HAD A FAIR AND

56
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:03,477
THOROUGH HEARING, AND EVEN

57
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,147
THOUGH IT TOOK A LONG -- LONGER

58
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:08,482
THAN THE AVERAGE SUPREME COURT

59
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:10,317
JUSTICE TAKES BY ABOUT THREE OR

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,488
FOUR WEEKS, I THINK WE STILL HAD

61
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:15,188
A FAIR AND A THOROUGH METHOD

62
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:17,290
THAT I PROMISED THE PEOPLE AND

63
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,759
EVERYONE HAD A CHANCE TO VOICE

64
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,292
THEIR CONVICTIONS.

65
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:21,495
>> SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT THIS

66
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:22,496
PROCESS WAS MORE CONTENTIOUS OR

67
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:24,498
MORE VICIOUS FROM WHAT WE'VE

68
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:26,299
SEEN IN THE PAST?

69
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,669
>> IT WAS VERY MUCH MORE

70
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,070
CONTENTIOUS.

71
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,638
I DON'T WANT TO LEAD PEOPLE TO

72
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,473
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A WAY

73
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,475
CONGRESS IS GOING TO FUNCTION

74
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:40,080
INTO THE FUTURE, EXCEPT MAYBE ON

75
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,514
JUDGES, YES.

76
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,482
BUT LEGISLATION GENERALLY, NO.

77
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:45,519
WE CAN WORK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY.

78
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,586
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

79
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:48,655
THOSE WHO SAW WHAT WAS REVEALED

80
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:50,257
ABOUT JUDGE CAVANAUGH IN THE

81
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:53,660
FINAL HEARING THIS, AS TOO

82
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:54,261
POLITICAL, TO PARTISAN?

83
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:56,496
LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WAS THINKING,

84
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:57,898
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE INVOLVED,

85
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,432
THE ONLY THANKED THE REPUBLICAN

86
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,134
SENATORS WHO WERE PART OF THE

87
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:02,302
PROCESS.

88
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:03,703
WAS THAT A MISTAKE?

89
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:08,175
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE IN JUDGE

90
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:10,443
CAVANAUGH

91
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:12,112
AND KAVANAUGH'S HAD TO BUT I

92
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:13,046
THINK HE IS LOOKING INTO THE

93
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:14,681
FUTURE AND WHEN HE GOES TO THE

94
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,283
SUPREME COURT WHERE IT IS THIS

95
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:21,087
VERY WEEK, THERE IS AN -- I HOPE

96
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:22,489
BETWEEN THE REPUBLICANS AND

97
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,456
DEMOCRATS MEET TOGETHER AS PART

98
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:24,858
OF THE GROUP AND HE WILL BE PART

99
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,863
OF THAT TEAM.

100
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:32,065
AND WHEN HE EXPRESSED SO THAT A

101
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,867
FACT OF LIFE IN HIS SPEECH LAST

102
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:35,068
NIGHT, THE REPUBLICANS WERE

103
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:37,337
GENERALLY GOING TO AGREE WITH

104
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:38,805
HIM.

105
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:42,642
AND KNEW HE HAD THE

106
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,778
QUALIFICATIONS BOUND THE COURT.

107
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:45,912
AND THE DEMOCRATS KNEW HE HAD

108
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:46,880
THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE ON THE

109
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:47,714
COURT BUT THEY WERE GOING TO

110
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:49,716
MAKE SURE HE DIDN'T GET ON THE

111
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:50,116
COURT.

112
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:51,251
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF THE

113
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:53,587
ALLEGATIONS THAT CAME AGAINST

114
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:54,821
BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE MOST

115
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:56,056
EXTREME OF THE ONE THAT CAME

116
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:59,192
FROM JULIE'S WET NECK AND HER

117
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:02,028
ATTORNEY, MICHAEL AVENATTI.

118
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:04,297
WAS AT A TURNING POINT IN ALL OF

119
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:06,066
THIS, DO YOU BELIEVE?

120
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:08,034
>> I THINK WITH HIS REPUTATION

121
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:12,606
THAT HE IS ESTABLISHED AS A

122
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,642
LAWYER THAT THAT RAISED

123
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:22,883
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY.

124
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:24,684
THEY HAVE TO ALL BE TAKEN VERY

125
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,286
SERIOUSLY BECAUSE UNTIL RECENT

126
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:27,487
YEARS THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH

127
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:28,221
THOUGHT GIVEN ABOUT IT.

128
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:38,265
AND IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THE

129
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:43,303
ME TWO MOVEMENT HAS COME ABOUT

130
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:44,704
BECAUSE, IT DID BRING THE

131
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:45,906
CREDIBILITY THAT OUGHT TO BE

132
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:46,706
BROUGHT.

133
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:49,075
I THINK DR. FORD BROUGHT

134
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:51,177
CREDIBILITY TO THE WHOLE ISSUE,

135
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:55,649
AND BEYOND THAT, YOU KNOW, A

136
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,684
RACE OF QUESTIONS.

137
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:00,620
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN YOU LOOK

138
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:03,990
AT THE PROTESTERS, AND HOLDING

139
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,992
POSTERS THAT THEY SOME OF THEM,

140
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:08,895
LIKE OLD WHITE MEN CAN'T BE FAIR

141
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:09,429
ABOUT THESE ISSUES?

142
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,698
>> FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE ONLY

143
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:12,365
TWO OF US ON THE JUDICIARY

144
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,134
COMMITTEE THAT ARE OLD AND I'M

145
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:14,968
ONE OF THEM.

146
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:18,271
EVERYONE ELSE IS YOUNG.

147
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:21,174
SO I DON'T LIKE TO BRING RACIST

148
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,676
ISSUES AND TO ADD, I LIKE TO SEE

149
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:26,546
PEOPLE AS AMERICANS FIRST AND

150
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:32,819
ONLY AS AMERICANS.

151
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,689
AND YOU CAN BE BACK IN AND YOUR

152
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,089
BACKGROUND.

153
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,491
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO NOT DIVIDE

154
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:39,859
AMERICA, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK

155
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,227
THAT WE ARE ALL AMERICANS

156
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,730
BRINGING AMERICANS TOGETHER, NOT

157
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:44,264
SEPARATING AMERICA.

158
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:48,635
BUT I WISH WE HAD WOMEN ON THE

159
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:49,703
REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE JUDICIARY

160
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:52,706
COMMITTEE -- >>   CRITICIZED THE

161
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,441
OTHER DAY SAYING YOU COULDN'T

162
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:56,276
GET WOMEN TO BE IN THIS

163
00:05:56,277 --> 00:05:57,744
COMMITTEE IN THIS ROOM, MAYBE

164
00:05:57,745 --> 00:06:00,647
THAT'S TOO MUCH WORK.

165
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:04,818
>> I SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCEPTED THE

166
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,187
PREPOSITION THAT WOMEN ARE NOT

167
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,688
ON ON IT.

168
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:09,422
WE HAD TO FIND THREE MEN THAT

169
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:12,692
WOULD SERVE ON IT, BUT NOT

170
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,995
BECAUSE OF WORK, IT'S BECAUSE

171
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,296
THEY IDEOLOGICALLY DIVIDED.

172
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:17,497
AND ALSO FROM THE STANDPOINT,

173
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:20,300
THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE

174
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,668
MEET, ALMOST EVERY THURSDAY

175
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,236
DESCENDANTS AND SANCTIONS, WE

176
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:27,073
HAVE AN EXECUTIVE SESSION.

177
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:28,775
AND MOST DON'T HAVE AN EXECUTIVE

178
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:31,277
SESSION EVERY YEAR LIKE WE DO.

179
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,179
SO WHETHER YOU ARE A MAN OR

180
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,482
WOMAN THERE IS A LOT OF WORK ON

181
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:36,483
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

182
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:37,183
>> Martha: WILL THERE BE AN

183
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,753
EFFORT TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE

184
00:06:39,754 --> 00:06:40,854
DIVERSITY ON THIS COMMITTEE?

185
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:43,123
>> OF COURSE THERE WILL BE, AND

186
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,125
THERE SHOULD BE.

187
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:45,792
>> Martha: SUSAN COLLINS WHO

188
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:46,926
GAVE A SEMINAL SPEECH WHEN SHE

189
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:48,495
ESTABLISHED SHE WAS GOING TO

190
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,897
VOTE YES, IS BEING ROUNDLY

191
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:51,297
CRITICIZED.

192
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:52,365
SHE WAS CALLED A FAKE FEMINIST

193
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,901
AND NOW THERE IS $3 MILLION IN A

194
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:55,935
FUND-RAISING EFFORT AGAINST HER

195
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:56,536
IN MAINE.

196
00:06:56,537 --> 00:07:06,413
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

197
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:08,681
THAT CRITICISM IT'S ABSOLUTELY

198
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:11,251
ABOMINABLE THAT THEY WOULD SAY

199
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:11,951
THAT ABOUT HER FOR EVERYTHING

200
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:15,221
SHE STOOD FOR IN HER LIFETIME,

201
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:18,058
RELATED TO FEMINIST ISSUES.

202
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,627
SHE'S BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF

203
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:21,027
EVERYTHING.

204
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:23,296
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW

205
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,065
NARROW THE THINKING OF THE

206
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:27,300
OPPOSITION TO THE KAVANAUGH WAS,

207
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:29,302
THAT THEY WOULD SAY THOSE

208
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:31,471
EXTREMISTS AND ANTI-: POSITIONS

209
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:33,039
ABOUT A PERSON THAT HAS BEEN

210
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,175
WITH THEM MOST OF THE TIME.

211
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:37,844
>> TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY THAT

212
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:41,281
JUDGE CAVANAUGH WILL WEAR THE

213
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:41,648
ROBES.

214
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:43,083
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A

215
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:44,717
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COURT IN

216
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:47,487
ITS NEW COMPOSITION COULD IN THE

217
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:48,822
FORESEEABLE FUTURE OVERTURN

218
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:49,222
ROE V. WADE?

219
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:52,092
>> NO.

220
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:54,094
BASED UPON WHAT KAVANAUGH SAID

221
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:55,795
BUT EVEN IF KAVANAUGH HADN'T

222
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:59,299
SAID IT, A LONGER A PRESIDENT IS

223
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,302
IN PLACE THE MORE APT IT IS TO

224
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,702
SAY ESTATE.

225
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:04,637
>> EVEN IF THERE IS MORE

226
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,039
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS INFORMATIVE

227
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,576
ABOUT WHEN A FETUS FEELS PAIN,

228
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,643
WE HAVE LOTS OF NEW INFORMATION

229
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,579
NOW SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY

230
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,515
OF THAT COULD LEAD TO THE

231
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:18,251
REEVALUATION OF ROE V. WADE?

232
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,120
>> I THINK STATE LEGISLATURES

233
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:21,754
ARE OPERATING IN THIS AREA

234
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,922
TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS

235
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:26,926
MORE BASED UPON MODERN MEDICINE

236
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:29,462
AND THE SCIENCE OF LIFE, TO FIND

237
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:32,398
ANSWERS AND PAIN IS ONE OF THEM.

238
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,138
THAT YOU WILL FIND SOME STATES

239
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:40,340
AND LAWS BEING UPHELD, BUT THAT

240
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:46,079
IS WAY SHORT OF OVERTHROWING

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,479
ROE V. WADE.

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
>> NANCY PELOSI WOULD LIKE TO

243
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:49,649
SEE ALL THE FBI DOCUMENTS THAT

244
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,683
WERE CALLED FROM THIS

245
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:51,317
INVESTIGATION MADE PUBLIC.

246
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:53,086
THERE ARE A LOT OF HEADLINES

247
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:54,621
THIS MORNING ON THE EDITORIAL

248
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:56,322
PAGES THAT THE RESISTANCE SHOULD

249
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:58,124
NOT BACK DOWN, AND IF THERE IS A

250
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,425
CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA, THAT JUST

251
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:02,128
BECAUSE AND KAVANAUGH IS NOW ON

252
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,129
THE COURT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN

253
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,098
THAT THE FIGHT THAT IS

254
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:06,599
UNDERTAKEN TO KEEP HIM FROM

255
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
THERE WOULD BE GIVEN UP.

256
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,003
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE

257
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:11,704
WITH REGARD TO THAT?

258
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,907
>> I THINK THAT THERE IS, IF

259
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:17,110
DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER THE HOUSE,

260
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,145
THE NEW CHAIRMAN WOULD BE THE

261
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:20,246
NEW CHAIRMAN OF NEW YORK.

262
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,515
HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO THAT.

263
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:24,217
>> DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE

264
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:25,418
ENOUGH EFFORT TO TRY TO IMPEACH

265
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:28,821
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE THE I DON'T

266
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:32,492
THINK IT'S A WHITE SPEAK TO DO

267
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:34,727
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND IT

268
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:38,198
FOR A BASIS FOR IMPEACHING, BUT

269
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,267
DON'T YOU SEE ALL THIS TALK,

270
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:43,269
WHETHER IT WAS PRIOR TO

271
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,103
SATURDAY'S VOTE OR SINCE

272
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:45,004
SATURDAY'S VOTE, EVERY EFFORT

273
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,106
THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THE LAST

274
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:49,175
MONTH HAS BEEN TO DETRACT FROM

275
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:51,211
HIS OUTSTANDING QUALIFICATIONS

276
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:54,314
AND ACADEMIC BACKGROUND.

277
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:58,751
AND HIS 12 YEARS ON THE D.C.

278
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:00,486
CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, NOBODY

279
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:01,821
SAID THAT HE WASN'T QUALIFIED TO

280
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:02,088
BE.

281
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,958
SO WHEN THEY COULDN'T KEEP HIM

282
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,060
OFF THE BENCH, BY POINTING OUT

283
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:11,664
THAT HE WASN'T QUALIFIED, THEN

284
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:13,600
THEY THREW EVERYTHING AT HIM

285
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:14,067
THAT HE COULD.

286
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:16,069
THEY THREW IT ON THE WALL, IF IT

287
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,705
DIDN'T STICK ON A LONG, THINK OF

288
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,106
SOMETHING ON WEDNESDAY.

289
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,074
EVEN ON THE DAY THAT HE WAS

290
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:23,676
GOING TO BE DEVOTED TO THE

291
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:25,144
SUPREME COURT, THERE WERE STILL

292
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:25,878
PEOPLE DIGGING AROUND TO FIND

293
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,714
SOME REASON THAT THIS GUY

294
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:29,182
SHOULDN'T BE ON THE COURT.

295
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:31,284
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK THE

296
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:32,552
CHANGES IN THE FILIBUSTER RULES

297
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:33,786
FIRST FOR THE LOWER COURT JUDGES

298
00:10:33,787 --> 00:10:36,522
AND IT NOW FOR THE SUPREME COURT

299
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:37,290
JUDGES, IS THERE ANY TURNING

300
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,725
BACK FROM THAT?

301
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:40,126
COULD ANYONE GET THROUGH THIS

302
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:41,361
PROCESS IF IT REQUIRED 60 VOTES

303
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:47,834
IN A CREDIT?

304
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:49,736
>> THE TWO PEOPLE ON THIS COURT

305
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:52,105
WOULD NOT BE THERE IF IT WEREN'T

306
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:52,705
FOR 60 VOTES.

307
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:57,176
BUT BETWEEN 1789 AND 2001, THERE

308
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:58,711
WASN'T FILIBUSTERS OF

309
00:10:58,712 --> 00:10:59,312
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.

310
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:06,886
AND THEN, SHERMER -- WE TOOK THE

311
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:07,887
IDEOLOGY OUT OF IT.

312
00:11:07,888 --> 00:11:10,089
HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

313
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,157
GEORGE W. BUSH DIDN'T GET A

314
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:14,994
HISPANIC ON THE CARD.

315
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:19,098
IT'S A SAD PATTERN.

316
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,100
OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS CONTINUED BY

317
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,468
REPUBLICANS WHEN THERE WAS A

318
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:24,537
DEMOCRAT PRESENT AND IT

319
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:25,004
CONTINUES TODAY.

320
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:27,140
I WOULD LIKE FOR SOMEONE TO SIT

321
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:28,875
DOWN WITH ME THAT THE DEMOCRAT

322
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:30,543
AND SAY, WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF

323
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:30,843
THIS.

324
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:33,479
WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE

325
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,914
WAY THAT JUDGES WERE VIEWED

326
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:36,783
BETWEEN 1789 AND OF THE YEAR

327
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:40,253
2001 THAT IDEOLOGY DIDN'T PAY A

328
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:41,521
MAJOR ROLE.

329
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:42,322
IT WAS ONLY BASED UPON YOUR

330
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:44,357
CONFIDENCE AND YOU AND YOUR

331
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:45,091
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT.

332
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:46,693
IN OTHER WORDS, WERE YOU GOING

333
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:49,295
TO BE A JUDGE OR A SUPER

334
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:50,997
LEGISLATURE?

335
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:52,665
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WENT INTO

336
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,099
IT.

337
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,135
THIS THING HAS BEEN IN A SINCE

338
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:57,303
THEN.

339
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:59,505
SOME PEOPLE SAY GRASSLEY, YOU'RE

340
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:00,540
WRONG, LOOK AT THE WAY THEY

341
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,108
TREATED BOURQUE.

342
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,276
LOOK AT THE WAY THEY TREATED

343
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:04,043
THOMAS.

344
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:12,652
THEN THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME

345
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:13,286
COMMON SENSE PREVAILED AND

346
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:16,255
GINSBURG AND BREYER WERE

347
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:17,490
APPROVED ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY.

348
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:18,257
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN GEORGE BUSH

349
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:21,327
GETS ELECTED PRESIDENT, THE

350
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:22,528
SUPREME COURT DECIDES HE OUGHT

351
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:24,697
TO BE PRESIDENT, INSTEAD OF

352
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:29,035
RECOUNTING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

353
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:30,803
OF VOTES, AND THAT IS WHEN

354
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:31,704
SCHUMER GAVE HIS SPEECH AND

355
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:34,040
THAT'S WHY THE WELL HAS BEEN

356
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,408
POISONED SENSE.

357
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:36,709
>> Martha: LAST QUESTION.

358
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,111
MARY GARLAND IS SOMEONE THAT A

359
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,512
LOT OF PEOPLE POINT TO AS THE

360
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:41,547
BEGINNING OF THE MOST RECENT

361
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:43,449
POISONING OF THIS PROCESS.

362
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,518
IF THERE IS AN OPENING ON THE

363
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,820
COURT, IN THE ELECTION YEAR, IN

364
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,222
2,020, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE

365
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,524
SENATE SHOULD TAKE UP A

366
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:53,059
NOMINATION DURING THAT PERIOD?

367
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,727
>> IF I'M CHAIRMAN, THEY WON'T

368
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,763
TAKE IT UP, BECAUSE I PLEDGED

369
00:12:56,764 --> 00:13:00,900
THAT IN 2016, IF THE BULB IS THE

370
00:13:00,901 --> 00:00:00,000
SAME AS IT IS -- YOU KNOW OF
