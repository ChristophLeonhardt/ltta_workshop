Michell Barney a the chief brags it negotiated from the European Union has said that Britain must remain bound by Brussels red tape if we want to continue trading with the continent that's not bread suit Barney a certainly doesn't want to see Britain succeed it's quite obvious that he and the rest of the dictators and bureaucrats in Brussels want to make an example of the UK if Britain were to leave the EU and succeed then other member states might well follow suit in fact they would follow suit we're already seeing a shift in politics across Eastern Europe which is now reaching the West we can see that with the incredible results in Italy recently Britain leaving the EU is one thing but a Britain that becomes more competitive and independent and able to more effectively protect its citizens and allow for business and economic growth sets an example for the rest of the continent and that would end the gravy train for the political bigwigs dictators and hard left authoritarian ideologues who want to see a new USSR formed and the individual national identities destroyed so it should come as no surprise that Barney a has said that a future trade deal will require the United Kingdom to commit to EU standards forever we're not talking about transition period anymore we're talking about being stuck with the EU regulations permanently with no representation in Parliament that's not Briggs it that's just foreign dictatorship would the United States ever cede control over to Canada even the suggestion stirs crazy so why the hell would we even be considering ceding control to Germany and France we didn't vote Briggs it just strip away the admittedly meaningless voting rights we had while remaining bound by regulations being voted on by the EU signed up members this is the worst deal ever made sorry Trump but I think this takes the title from the Iran deal when speaking to MEP Xin a debate about UK environmental regulations he won that the European Union would be quote extremely vigilant in stopping attempts by the UK to change rules and regulations to compete with Europe now we own nothing to the European Union British taxpayers have given over five hundred billion quid so that he used since we joined so what exactly do we owe these people and somehow somewhere down the line British politicians have decided that we do owe them something we owe them our entire country No so in his speech Barney I also said quote if we make sure our partnership is based on a level playing field then we should have strongly mitigated the threat of brexit to EU environmental policy but we know that this isn't about saving the earth this is about stopping the UK from competing against Europe he said it himself he also claimed quote there will be no ambitious partnership without guarantees on fair competition social standards tax dumping and not least environmental standards so what's it going to take to actually leave the EU clearly the deal-making process isn't working when the other party in the process starts making demands that hurt the UK and give them the huge upper hand not just in competition in trade but allowing them to control an entire country's policies from overseas and it's time to walk away we should stop being taken advantage of our good nature can only go on for so long clearly the European Union won't give us a good deal and clearly they won't allow us to be competitive and leaving the process entirely going it on our own and letting the EU eventually return to us with their tail between their legs is an infinitely better option but the long-term reality is clear as well no country's ever going to escape the grip of this authoritarian monster until it's brought down completely this is no longer just brexit the EU must be totally destroyed in all European countries and its leaders held to account for decades of undemocratic rule and the destruction of Nations through catastrophic social immigration and economic policies only when the EU has been totally destroyed will we be free watch me and the rest of the rebel team on our brand-new app download it now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
