when Paul Ryan says listen I'm gonna keep my nose to the grindstone and do what I'm supposed to do he gets ripped on both sides it's pretty astonishing it's pretty astonishing and I think Meghan McCain made a really good point yesterday yesterday on the view there are a bunch of people who are all the left was cheering Paul Ryan being leaving a speaker of the house oh it's just so great that Paul Ryan is out because Paul Ryan is a shill and Paul Ryan hasn't stood up to Trump and all the rest of this stuff all these same Democrats who never stood up to Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton one iota and now it's about Paul Ryan who didn't stand up to Trump even though during the election cycle Paul Ryan actually did stand up to then candidate Trump in the middle of the election cycle and disinvited him from a particular event after the Access Hollywood tape and told all the members of his Republican caucus that he wasn't gonna be openly campaigning for Trump up til the election right but but this was not enough for the folks on the left they say that you know they're really happy that Ryan is going and make him McCain makes a good point she's listen if Ryan is not sufficient for you in terms of his sort of tenor then why exactly wouldn't people vote for President Trump the problem what do you want if Paul Ryan is but Paul Ryan is the greatest sin this is how we got Trump because if Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney and people like this are the worst kind of politicians then you deserve Trump because he is not either truly decent man that was trying to fight for democracy and conservative ideals and now what they did be left I have no idea okay good for Megan McCain this is exactly right when Megan McCain is saying here's exactly right you know the left sits around they wonder how did we get Trump how do we get Trump by calling Paul Ryan the worst by calling Mitt Romney the worst by suggesting that people who were decent were actually bad and then you know what the right did they said well maybe it was their decency that lost them the election maybe what we need is an indecent man who punches in order to win an election and then Trump won on exactly that basis and then you're wondering why the right has resonated to President Trump
