TV and newspaper journalists hammered Donald Trump with negative news stories last week and as a result Trump's poll numbers rose dramatically the journalists are baffled chief anchor of ABC News George suckle Apogee's said quote I can understand it I know I'm usually a hack for the Clintons who recently gave them $75,000 without telling my ABC bosses about it but when I report on Donald Trump I'm being a serious journalist no really look this is my serious journalist face see how serious it is so why won't anyone believe me I don't know what's going on unquote anchor an editor of the CBS Evening News nati ly Schmucker also said he was mystified that no one would believe his negative reports about Trump he told the reporters quote look at the suit and tie and this haircut this is the suit and haircut of a man who really seems to be on the up-and-up even when he skews the news so badly to the left that his own reporters don't want their stories appearing on his show also my diction it's impeccable how can you distrust someone with diction like mine I sound exactly like someone who's telling the truth unquote former NBC anchor Brian Williams now working at MSNBC for some reason issued a statement saying it is time for the public to listen to our negative Trump stories by myself first met Donald Trump while parachuting into Afghanistan with SEAL team 6 during our attempt to restore the rightful king of gnarnia while clearing terrorists out of caves in Tora Bora I met a strange blue creature whose soul had been atrophied by his attachment to a magical invisibility ring that creature was Donald Trump and anyone who thinks I'm making that up is no better than the ISIS soldier I had to strangle with my bare hands while reporting from the ground in Syria unquote according to Bob Woodward The Washington Post has assigned 20 reporters to investigate every aspect of Trump's life when asked if the post would also assign 20 reporters to Hillary Clinton Woodward said absolutely it takes that many just to carry the Train of her dress New York Times editor NAT Eli Schmucker no relation to the guy from CBS News it's just a common name among mainstream journalists issued a statement saying quote I know the time sacrificed every last ounce of credibility we had covering up for Barack Obama during his lies about Bill Ayers his lies about Reverend Wright the IRS scandal the Obamacare collapse the Benghazi scandal and his role in the deterioration of the Middle East but when we report on Donald Trump by golly we really mean it and finally CNN's Wolf Blitzer complained to a colleague saying quote during Hurricane Katrina I said boy oh boy George W Bush is to blame for that when Democrats destroyed the economy I said boy oh boy George W Bush is to blame for that now when I say boy oh boy Donald Trump is a bad guy everyone just thinks I'm the wolf who cried boy trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show I couldn't I couldn't resist I could only because we're so accurate all right Radio Free America is back on the air broadcasting from a satellite within my imagination far far outside of reality and the rest of the world we want you to subscribe to support the last voices of freedom on the air and also also because cuz Lindsey is always yelling at me that I don't promote myself enough over the weekend I'm you know I checked these ratings of the top news and politics podcasts on the air on iTunes and for a brief moment there we were number 50 one point ahead of the mighty Glenn back my friend Glenn back who's normally on a normal day is ahead of us but this was a so please subscribe and if you like the show put it on your Facebook page send it you know get get grandma on the blower and let's spread the news let people know alright we had a great weekend despite listen the the end of the Republic is not getting in the way of us having a good time and you know I have put off saying congratulations to our friend Ben Shapiro on the birth of this beautiful absolutely beautiful little boy this is a mystery of nature that Shapiro has kids who look like him and be are very attractive that doesn't make some absolutely it's the same thing with their sisters look like I mean they're beautiful I don't understand that it's like more than more than nature can explain hey can these things be yeah I don't know so we all went we all went to the bris which is a Jewish ceremony when you have a new kid you get together new sack feist a Gentile to your dark Jewish gods I think that's maybe I misunderstood what was happening I don't know and I have to just say before we get to the news of the day after I have to just say as we were sitting there because we were kind of the goyishe table we were the deputy Walker was there in force and and as I was sitting there I was thinking you know I haven't been invited to a Babylonian you know ceremony lately I don't I can't remember the name of their gods or duck or something like that but you know I haven't been invited to worship Athena or like any of the Jupiter or anything so all these guys from the alt-right all these dirtbags from the alt-right who have been hammering been with anti-semitic twit tweets and me too I mean I'm a Christian but I was born a Jew and I've never want anyone to think that I was trying to escape Judaism by embracing Christ that was totally different things so I welcome all your anti-semitism please please go ahead and attack me but but all those people should reflect for a minute that when this civilization passes away the Jews are still gonna be here yeah you might need them to put in a good word for you as the hordes of your civilization so be nice all right don't mess around all right we have to look at this I know I did the opening about this thing with the media but we really have to look at this this is one of the most revealing moments on the left it is just a revelation of what has happened to our institutions in general but to the news media more than anything else I mean they last week and into the weekend they hammered Donald Trump with everything they've got and just before I start I'm just gonna reiterate my own point of view is that I have really really deep misgivings about Donald Trump because of his tendency toward violence his call to beat up hecklers his sympathy with Putin is sympathy with the Chinese when they destroyed people in Tiananmen Square all those things make him anomalous to me they make the arguments the usual right-left arguments they eclipsed those arguments for me so I really have deep misgivings even though I haven't said I'm never Trump because something could happen that changes everything the rapture could come in as I'm floating into Anthony might want to stick it to you people stuck on earth voting for Trump that's where I spent however however if anybody anybody is making Trump look great it is the mainstream media they keep hurling this garbage at him and and they can't understand what doesn't stick the New York Times a former newspaper had this whale this creature or a cry of frustration how much bad press does it take to cost Donald Trump a news cycle that's the headline in the New York Times like a Friday how much bad press does it take with few exceptions Donald ray Trump's week in the news was a blur of unflattering reports his refusal to disclose his effective tax rate eclipsed an audio tape of him posing as his own spokesman that in turn upstaged reports about his former Butler saying racist violent things about President Obama which had already overtaken mr. Trump's waffling over his own call for a ban on Muslims entering the country but mr. Trump somehow seemed to win the news cycle anyway even just hear them like tearing out their hair at New York office he is the first candidate to truly take advantage of the fact we are an ad D society said Jay Tucker Martin a Republican communications strategist in Virginia he moves so quick and creates outrages so fast you almost forget what happened that total malarkey that is not what's happening at all what's happening at all is that the the messengers are worse than the message the people who are bringing the news are untrustworthy and the things that they are talking about the things they are talking about are largely nonsense I mean first of all the unfairness let's take a look Bob Woodward really did say that The Washington Post said proudly that the Washington Post had assigned 20 reporters to pick apart Donald Trump's life and here's Chris Wallace challenging him on that as saying that The Washington Post has 20 people working on every phase of Donald Trump's life that's correct we've announced a month ago that we're doing the book and we're gonna reduce stories is this evolved the equivalent effort will be made on hill it's traditional and I think particularly in this campaign which is one of those pivot points in the history of the country we need to tell people everything we can find out that means a massive effort are you making an equal effort because that's something that we're hearing from folks an equal effort on Hillary Clinton on earth yet well it's not necessarily the number of people it's who's working on it that question was no we haven't got to on Hillary why would why would we cover Hillary I don't understand what are you I'm sorry you're not speaking mainstream media now I don't go out they do not speak this language just totally unfair do we have the clip of Charlie Rose I think I sent in the clip of Charlie Rose interviewing one of Obama's speech writers right the guy who wrote this is the guy who wrote the line if you like your doctor you can keep it like just watch this from it there's Charlie Rose interviewing this speechwriter who looks like he's about 15 years old point is that do you have equal impact on Syria speeches because it's about style use of language I really like I was very the joke speech is the most fun part of this but the things I'm the most proud of were the more serious speeches I think healthcare economic speeches and I think if you like your insurance you can keep it major bill that's attacking the economy into the supposed to take Charlie Rose seriously if it's fine with him that they lie the New York Times ran a piece showing that they lied about the Iran deal it's fine that was fine but now we're supposed to believe them of about Donald Trump so let's take a look at some of these stories the first big one is Trump pretended during his divorce from whichever one it was his divorce he pretended to be his own PR guys and he calls up and it really is funny he calls up the Washington Post and he says like frankly his guy called himself John Miller I was like frankly this is John Miller and Donald Trump believe me is huge Bolognese like here's here's a clip of him pretending to be something keeps changing his story before he said it was a prank and now he's saying it never happened weird but let's compare it for just a minute to the stories about Mitt Romney tied is dogs caged to the top of the car which I'm sure was the best thing that ever happened to that dog that dog is probably still sitting around going you know I think dogs I they love the wind blowing over them so that and he bullied a kid in high school and we were supposed to care because that showed that showed he hated gay people because the kid had long hair I mean we're so used to these guys dynamiting Republican candidates with garbage while at the same time ignoring felonies from the Democrats true cruel felonies I mean the joke about the dog on the roof was that Barack Obama and his memoir said he ate dogs they ate dogs while in Kent Kenya so so I mean they just constantly do this oh who cares so who cares you know it's weird it's weird either that it's hilarious it's funny but I mean does it matter the country's in bad shape do we care that he didn't know nobody cares and here is their big one this one I love this is the this has been trending on the New York Times all weekend this is like their top story all weekend about how the hähnel Trump treated women okay well I'll read it's a little bit first before I comment on crossing the line it's called this is the objective New York Times crossing the line how Donald Trump behaved with women in private you know this is something that all men really want exposed as how they behave with women so you got 50% of the public that doesn't care and and women too or thinking that's in private it was in private all right Donald J Trump at this is the lead Donald J Trump had barely Metro Ann Brewer Lane when he asked her to change out of her clothes and then he goes on to this tell this completely you know kind of silly story about a model was at one of his parties at mar-a-lago and he asked her to put on a bikini or something like this and she was a model you know so she did it and he then went out and showed her off Denia all right and then he goes on after telling this hideous story about how this man asked a girl to put on a bikini Donald Trump and women the words evoke familiar cascade of casual insults sounds like I wrote it as a joke as the words evoke a familiar cascade of casual insults hurled from the safe distance of a twitter account a radio show or a campaign podium this is the public treatment of some women by mr. Trump for the presumptive Republican nominee for president degrading impersonal performed but the 1999 episode at mar-a-lago that mrs. brewer Lane described was different a debasing faced facing face-to-face encounter between mr. Trump and a young woman the accounts of these women many relate here in their own words reveal unwelcome romantic advances unending commentary on the female form a shrewd reliance on ambitious women an unsettling workplace conduct according to the interviews see because no one at the New York Times has ever actually had sex with a woman you know none of the men none of the men I should say have had sex they don't realize this is normal behavior among men and women we you know we tease each other and flirt with each other and rich men get a lot of girls being rich powerful men get a lot of girls and girls will step a little over the line for a rich guy we all know it's true they just don't know this is that you know really really this is like when when let's take a look just pause for a minute though and take a look at the woman herself who was involved in this story about putting on a bikini she was on Fox News they did take quotes from what I said and they put a negative connotation on he spun it to where it appeared negative I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump and I don't appreciate them making it look like that I was saying that it was a negative experience you knew them very well right you dated him for several months that's correct yes and he was never a never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way he never offended me in any way he was very gracious I saw him around all types of people all types of women he was it was very kind thoughtful generous you know he was a gentleman has ever been on a date I mean wait wait first first men with women I've never I've never heard of this they men who actually think they're men with women who think they're women no I've never seen this thing before reporting from Mars thing that we here on earth do so it's you know what it reminds me of a slightly tragic version of this it reminds me of during the war when george w bush was president every soldier who was killed was a front-page New York Times story of course every time an American soldier is killed it is a vast tragedy but it's not a new story soldier killed in war is not a new story that's what war is it's soldiers getting killed and killing other soldiers hoping to kill more of their soldiers then our soldiers get killed so that they surrender that's what war is and yet they reported it and then of course it all stopped I think something like 70 to 75 percent of the soldiers who have died American soldiers who have died in Afghanistan have died under Obama you wouldn't even know the Afghanistan war was still going on I mean it's been eight years of war under Obama because of his mishandling of the victory he was handed but you don't hear about that so this is that's not news here's another one that isn't news this was in the paper this is the New York Times today little is off-limits as Donald Trump plans attacks on Hillary Clinton's character who on earth would attack would you attack Hillary Clinton's character about this is this is the news this is front-page news on the New York Times that one candidate is going to attack another candidate's character or declare deadline here it is Donald J Trump plans to throw Bill Clinton's infidelities and Hillary Clinton's face on live television during the presidential debates this fall questioning whether she enabled his behavior and sought to discredit the women involved mr. Trump will try to hold her accountable for security lapses at the American consulate in Benghazi Libya and for the death of ambassador J Christopher it goes on and on as horrible as horrible shock that you know someone could attack Hillary Clinton sink Hillary Clinton it's and they wonder why his poll numbers go up they wonder why his poll numbers go up it's because they stink it's because we hate them and when anyone they attack becomes more attractive and not just to conservatives not just we all know you're lying even the left knows you're lying even the people who read the New York Times the six people who still read the New York Times you know get up and say oh they're horrible there are my prejudices confirmed that's what I love about the New York Times I love to see everything I believe spelled out in print on the New York Times because otherwise I might have to face the fact that none of it's true then there's the Butler story they're all shocked about the butler story Anthony's cynical I think his name is longtime Butler for Donald Trump very loyal loves loves Trump I mean he loves the and that that says something right there a guy works for him and he loves him so he's been treated well he posted nasty things about Obama on his Facebook page again from The Times the racially tinged posts by the butler anthony Senecal they were unearthed by mother jones far left-wing magazine on earth by mother jones you know this is a very big important investigative story they referred to mr. Obon Obama as a Kenyan fraud who should be hanged for treason and here's the quote with the last breath I draw I will help rid this America of the scum infested in its government Cenacle wrote last May saying that the president should be dragged from the white mosque and hanged from the portico count me in who cares who cares he's an ordinary guy he's not responsible for what his Butler says ordinary guy clearly ticked off about Obama went off on him you know if that was if that was Obama saying that if it was Trump himself saying that you know if it was somebody with responsibility saying that that would be a terrible thing to say that the president should be hanged but but an ordinary guy is the right to say whatever he wants so what happen at reflecting on Donald Trump at all and then there's this thing with his taxes okay so Trump refuses to show his taxes and you know I would prefer a candidate show his taxes you it's revealing but you know they're just looking for stuff to throw at him there you know they're just looking for a way to throw at him so George suckle up against as I call them the George Stephanopoulos is challenges Trump on this on these not revealing his taxes here it is I first asked you about this in 2011 and you said you would release your tax returns then you were thinking running for president when President Obama releases his birth certificate he did then you said you would release your tax returns when Secretary Clinton released her email she has turned over all the emails in her possession she didn't turn over all there's plenty missing I read yesterday where there are a lot of emails missing doctor I know she's a good friend of yours and I know you worked for him and you didn't reveal it but you know she did not turn over her emails there are a lot of emails missing there were emails from her staffers missing it's a game drum let me read you I know I read this on the air before let me you know George Devol Stephanopoulos did he was he worked for Clinton in the Clinton campaign he's in that documentary the war room he recently gave $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation and didn't report it didn't tell ABC about it here is a page from his own memoir right on the night of Clinton's re-election I read it before but it's worth repeating he says he comes in to say goodbye he's leaving the campaign because they've won and he goes in to say goodbye to Hillary Clinton quote this was our private goodbye she gave me a hug and held me at arm's length for an extra second a hand on each of my shoulders her eyes we smiled through the silence we had survived we had won all would be well I love you George Stephanopoulos said Hilary I love you too said George Stephanopoulos I walked out the door I mean it's very to tear comes to my eye this is the guy ABC Quincy candidate you know no corruption here I don't see any corruption I'm shocked shocked to find him asking hard questions of Donald Trump why would you listen to it alright let's get down though to a story today an op that in the story today in the paper today which tells you everything it reveals everything you need to know about the difference between the left-wing press which is almost all the press and the people who are supporting Trump it's an article called make America great again for the people it was great for already all right Donald J Trump has promised to make America great again and people have listened he is the presumptive Republican nominee he got there with that one consistent campaign imperative splashed across his website on loud red baseball caps on stickers yard signs and other slogan ready paraphernalia this is the one true unwavering message mr. Trump offers his supporters he may avoid direct answers on his taxes but he has never backtracked on the need to return the country to its previous glory which America is he promising to us if you ask his supporters they say life has gotten worse for people like them over the last 50 years it seems safe to assume that in the eyes of mr. Trump's overwhelmingly white male fans America was greater a half century ago indeed it was pretty great for them okay that so that's that is the point of view of the press now let me just you know and Obama actually was selling this too he gave the commencement speech at Rutgers over the weekend listen to him for a minute he's saying when you hear someone longing for the good old days take it with a grain of salt take it with a grain of salt we live in a great nation and we are rightly proud of our history we are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came before but I guess it's part of human nature especially in times of change and uncertainty to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked and the economy hummed and all politicians were wise and every child was well-mannered and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world guess what it ain't so the good old days weren't all that good all right and he went on to say in fact by almost every measure is a quote America is better and the world is better than it was 50 years ago or 30 years ago or even eight years ago well crap let's face it and this is this is the thing he's selling what he's selling is that his failed presidency his failed Obamacare his failed Middle East policy his failed economic response to the crisis you know it's great it's all great and this is what the New York Times are selling to but let's think about this for a minute cuz I'm not a nostalgia guy okay I am NOT I do not want America to return to her past greatness I want her to go forward into future greatness okay I'm not looking to return to the morality of the 1950s not at all I am NOT i but but morality 21st century morality I am looking for us to return to morality and 21st century morality is still going to be morality it's still going to involve sexual restraint it's still going to revolve involve the fact that freedom is better than slavery and that coercion is wrong and this is what the left wants the left one's absolute sexual freedom because they know it enslaves you they know you know people who want sexual freedom are like adolescents who want to drive the car I'm big enough to drive the car dad oh I cracked it up would you pay for it please you know that's people who want absolute sexual freedom is I'm can do anything I want oh could you pay for my abortion could you pay for my you know aids care could you pay for this and that you know it makes you a slave to the government the government knows that they want you to be as sexually free as possible freedom morality is still going to involve sexual restraint and it's still going to involve not coercing people which is the other thing the left wants they want to be able to tell you what to do what to say what to think they want to be able to tell you when you look at a man who says he's a woman he's a woman instead of a man they want you to to to control reality okay so I'm not looking to go backwards I am NOT looking to go backwards I'm looking to go forward into a new morality in a new situation or an old morality in a new safer situation let's put it that way an old morality in a new situation but America was greater in the 50s America was greater in the 50s than it is now it had just one world war two Europe its competitors main competitor was absolute ruin obviously Japan was in ruins it it was a great country we were unified in our basic premises you know we kind of all we had a consensus we had a consensus that has fallen apart people I think were happier and and black people were mistreated and you never underestimate how bad that was how bad legal segregation was I mean just for all for a minute just take the time to think of yourself as a black dad or mom turning to his six-year-old son or daughter and telling him why he can't use the same restroom as everybody else okay that's all you have to think about to know how bad that was we that was shame on us that was bad okay so the right the principle right says fix that we have a great country let's include these people that we've excluded let's not do that anymore no bad on us well let's stop and a greater percentage of Republicans voted for the civil rights bills than the Democrats because those Southern Democrats were the guys the Dixiecrats were the guys who were fighting for segregation and we're fighting for Jim Crow and you know that the Democrat has been the Democrats have been the pump the party of racialism from slavery to affirmative action to black lives matter you know it's the right who wants to say no the pluribus unum were all together so we want to fix keep the greatness and fix the bad stuff right that makes sense but the left the minute they got hold a minute they understood that we felt shame over segregation well deserved shame they have been using that to destroy the country they tell us the country is bad you don't believe me go read their textbooks go read their history books they say that the country has been a force for evil from its inception and that's the difference that's the difference between us when he says make America great again those of us who believe America is great and flawed because in all at all times there are flaws we think yeah you know America was great we want it to be great again they think America wasn't great it was only great for those white people all those nasty white people who were voting for Donald Trump and that's the difference and that's why his message is resonating despite his flaws as a human being and the press is falling flat and I have to say you know it's really the disturbing to me that the two worst people in America are running for the highest office in the land but if I'm here to be entertained and the one thing that's gonna be entertaining is watching Donald Trump roll over the mainstream media they so deserve it all right stuff I like that's today this week I'm gonna do great true crime stories because there are some great true crime stories and the first one speaks right into what we're talking about if you haven't read the devil in the White City by Erik Larson this is one of the best books published in the last ten years there's no question about it is riveting true life story about the 1893 Chicago World's Fair so it's 1893 when basically America is just rising up it's coming out of the you know the Civil War it's becoming this great industrial power the world the West is basically at its peak that is the peak of Europe 1893 all this Sun new technology and he's building this it's about the guy who built the architect was building the Chicago World's Fair he's building a world so wonders this is a display of wonders and in the midst of it this evil evil serial killer is operating with impunity and nobody knows he's there it's soon gonna be a movie I think with Leonardo DiCaprio but before that happens read this book because it is spectacular and it shows you this vision that in the midst of civilization we are still sinful creatures doing terrible things and it's not you don't tear down civilization to get to that bad guy at its heart you know you just go after the bad guy and you keep building civilization and that's the difference between the right and the left the devil in the White City great great true crime story terrific it's what it really is one of the best books of last ten years that's it that's it and the week is now beginning Radio Free America is on the air I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show come back tomorrow and we'll do it again
