1
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:11,863
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:13,731
I DON'T KNOW IF THE THIRD TIME

3
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:15,934
IS THE CHARGE BUT IT'S

4
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:16,334
INTERESTING.

5
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:19,037
NORTH KOREA'S LEADING MEETING

6
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:20,305
WITH THE CHINESE LEADER.

7
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:22,473
THE LAST TIME THE POW-WOW GOT

8
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:23,141
THE PRESIDENT CONCERNED.

9
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:25,944
BUT KIM JONG-UN IS GOING TO BE A

10
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,178
BUSY GLOBAL TRAVELER HERE.

11
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:31,349
A MAN THAT NEVER LEFT HIS

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,685
COUNTRY, SAY UNDER DURESS OR

13
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:34,452
ORDERS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

14
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:36,454
CALL IT, WILL BE MEETING WITH

15
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,422
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN THE FALL AND A

16
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:39,958
HOST OF DIGNITARIES.

17
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,160
HE'S SUDDENLY THE MAN ABOUT TOWN

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,595
AND PROBABLY NOT IN THE HERMIT

19
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:44,929
KINGDOM.

20
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:49,167
WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THIS,

21
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:49,534
REBECCA?

22
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:50,868
>> IT LOOKS LIKE KIM JONG-UN

23
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,370
WANTS A DIFFERENT REPUTATION.

24
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,606
SO HE'S SORT OF MAKING THE

25
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:56,274
ROUNDS.

26
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:59,877
THIS MEETING WITH XI IN CHINA IS

27
00:00:59,877 --> 00:01:00,311
INTERESTING.

28
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,579
IT SHOWS THAT NORTH KOREA

29
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,014
UNDERSTANDS HOW CRITICAL THAT

30
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:03,481
ALLIANCE IS.

31
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:07,352
CHINA IS REFERRED TO OFTEN AS

32
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:08,987
NORTH KOREA'S BIG BROTHER.

33
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:10,688
CHINA HAS TAKEN CREDIT FOR THE

34
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:12,490
SUCCESS BETWEEN THE SUMMIT WITH

35
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,191
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH

36
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,126
KOREA AND SO, YOU KNOW, LOOKS

37
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:17,395
LIKE NORTH KOREA IS DEBRIEFING

38
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:20,198
THE CHINESE AND THE CHINESE ARE

39
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:21,699
CERTAINLY GIVING THE NORTH

40
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,267
KOREANS SOME ADVICE ABOUT WHAT

41
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,270
TO DO NEXT, VIS A VIS THE UNITED

42
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,604
STATES.

43
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,706
THE NEXT STEP IS THAT THEY'RE

44
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:32,276
SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING MOVES TO

45
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:32,710
DENUCLEARIZE.

46
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,512
CHINA WILL BE GIVING THEM ADVICE

47
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,813
ABOUT HOW TO GO ABOUT THAT AND

48
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:39,017
WHAT TO GET OUT OF THE AMERICANS

49
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:40,051
IN RETURN.

50
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:41,252
>> Neil: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

51
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:44,155
THE NORTH KOREAS MIGHT OFFER

52
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:45,723
THEM ADVICE ON TRADE.

53
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:47,058
HOW DO YOU LINK THE TWO?

54
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:49,260
WE'VE GOTTEN TOUGHER WITH THE

55
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,995
CHINESE DESPITE THIS GREAT

56
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,930
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP THE

57
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,065
PRESIDENT TALKS UP BUT EVEN POST

58
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:56,968
THE MEETING, WE DUG IN OUR HEELS

59
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:58,703
AND THREATENED THAT EVEN IF THEY

60
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,139
WANT TO RESPOND TO THE NEXT WAVE

61
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,307
OF TARIFFS, WE'RE GOING TO COME

62
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:05,143
DOWN LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT.

63
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:06,177
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

64
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:07,478
SEEMS AS THOUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP

65
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,947
IS STILL GOING HARD ON THE

66
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:10,815
TARIFFS EVEN THOUGH WE STILL

67
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:14,719
NEED THE CHINESE TO COOPERATE ON

68
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,287
THE NORTH KOREA ISSUE.

69
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,689
SO -- AND CHINA IS THE ONLY

70
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:19,590
COUNTRY IN WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP

71
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,959
HAS SAID THERE MIGHT BE ANY SORT

72
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,762
OF BENEFIT IN RELAXATION OF

73
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:26,431
TARIFFS, THAT SORT OF THING, IF

74
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:28,099
THEY DO HELP IN THESE OTHER

75
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:28,399
AREAS.

76
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,334
HE'S NOT DONE IT WITH ANY OTHER

77
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:30,668
COUNTRY.

78
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:32,003
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

79
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:34,405
IT'S INTERESTING HOW HARD HE'S

80
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,840
BEING AND RELENTLESS.

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,542
YOU HAVE TO WONDER, SOMETHING

82
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,309
HAS TO GIVE.

83
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,611
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHINESE

84
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,780
CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON

85
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,181
NORTH KOREA.

86
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:45,716
THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN GUN TO

87
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:47,385
RELAX SOME OF THEIR TRADE

88
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:50,721
RESTRICTIONS LEADING UP TO THE

89
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,255
SUMMIT.

90
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,257
SINCE THEN, THE PRESIDENT SAID

91
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,026
THAT'S OKAY AS LONG ALWAYS THEY

92
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,060
CONTINUE TO HELP THE NORTH KOREA

93
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,360
ISSUE.

94
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,463
A LOT GOING ON THERE.

95
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,631
CLEARLY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL

96
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:01,032
NEGOTIATING.

97
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:02,834
WE'RE SEEING THE MIX OF THIS AND

98
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,837
ALL OF IT IS WRAPPED UP

99
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:06,237
TOGETHER.

100
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:08,706
>> Neil: I WONDER IF HE READS

101
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,141
THE COMMENTS LIKE JUSTIN TRUDEAU

102
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:13,244
IN CANADA WHEN HE FELT THAT HE

103
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:15,713
WAS SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY

104
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:18,983
THAN WHAT HE SAID AT THE G-7.

105
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,751
THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN DISMISSIVE

106
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:25,256
OF THE PRESIDENT SAYING THIS IS

107
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,991
RECKLESS, UNWISE.

108
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:28,893
I WONDER IF THAT STICKS IN HIS

109
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:29,227
GROIN.

110
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:29,861
>> IT MIGHT.

111
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:32,497
THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT THE

112
00:03:32,497 --> 00:03:34,599
TRUDEAU FLAP, TO ME THAT SEEMED

113
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,668
A LOT LIKE MESSAGING TO THE

114
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:38,436
NORTH KOREANS, WHICH IS THAT

115
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:39,070
DON'T --

116
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,071
>> Neil: REALLY?

117
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,372
>> ABSOLUTELY.

118
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:44,575
THE MESSAGE COMING OUT IS DON'T

119
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:45,643
TRY TO PULL ONE OVER ON

120
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:46,344
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

121
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:47,979
YOU HAVE THESE PRIVATE

122
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,181
CONVERSATIONS, YOU MAKE THE

123
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:50,548
PROMISES.

124
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:51,983
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL NOT

125
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,718
GOING TO STICK TO HIS END OF THE

126
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:55,586
DEAL PUBLICLY IF YOU DON'T STICK

127
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:57,155
TO YOUR END PUBLICLY.

128
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:00,691
THAT SEEMS A LOT LIKE MESSAGING

129
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:01,859
WITH NORTH KOREA.

130
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:02,793
>> Neil: AND WHAT IF IT'S

131
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:06,631
JUST -- SOMETIMES WE LOOK FOR A

132
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:07,832
METHOD OF THE MADNESS AND

133
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:08,699
SOMETIMES HE'S JUST MAD?

134
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,168
>> COULD BE.

135
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,502
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED

136
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,137
AS AN ANALYST WITH THE TRUMP

137
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:14,472
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT TO BE

138
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:16,274
OVERLY CONFIDENT BECAUSE

139
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,009
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DIFFERENT.

140
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,877
BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT --

141
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:21,646
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS JUST --

142
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:23,181
ALMOST ORCHESTRATED TO SOME

143
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:23,514
DEGREE.

144
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,650
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE

145
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,217
STATEMENTS FROM THE

146
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:27,251
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AFTER

147
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:27,552
THAT.

148
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,220
SO I DO THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT

149
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,254
WE'RE SEEING BETWEEN THE UNITED

150
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,323
STATES AND NORTH KOREA, I STILL

151
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,158
THINK THERE'S NEGOTIATIONS GOING

152
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:34,425
ON.

153
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,093
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL WILLING

154
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:38,462
TO THROW THE HAMMER DOWN IN THE

155
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:40,398
COMING MONTHS IF NORTH KOREA

156
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:41,832
DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE GOOD ON

157
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,467
ITS COMMITMENTS THAT IT MADE

158
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,168
DURING THE SUMMIT.

159
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,037
>> Neil: I'LL MAKE A BET WITH

160
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:46,704
YOU.

161
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:51,042
HE'S GOING TO SAY -- SOMEONE

162
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:56,514
SAYS SOMETHING CHILDISH ABOUT

163
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,317
HIM ON ANY LEVEL, TOMORROW WILL

164
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,852
BE A NIGHTMARE.

165
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:05,189
THE RESPONSE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER

166
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,690
SEEN.

167
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,227
IT WILL BE BORNE BY SOME SNIPPY

168
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:09,560
COMMENT.

169
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,128
>> IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF THESE

170
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:12,697
COUNTRIES TO PROBABLY TAKE HIM

171
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:14,966
SERIOUSLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE

172
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:15,366
DEFINITELY.

173
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,400
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

174
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,202
>> AND THE OTHER THING, WHAT

175
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,004
WE'RE SEEING WITH CHINA AND THE

176
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:21,505
NORTH KOREA ISSUE, A LOT OF

177
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:23,140
THINGS THE CHINESE WILL TELL AND

178
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,509
ADVISE THE NORTH KOREAS TO DO

179
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:26,544
VIS A VIS THE UNITED STATES ARE

180
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:27,979
THING THAT THE CHINESE WANT AND

181
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,313
THE NORTH KOREANS WANT.

182
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:30,314
THEY WANT THE UNITED STATES NOT

183
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,716
TO BE DEPLOYED IN SOUTH KOREA.

184
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:33,684
THEY WANT THE WAR GAMING

185
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:34,785
EXERCISES TO STOP, WHICH THEY

186
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:36,621
ARE ON A PAUSE.

187
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:38,122
THEY WANT THE MISSILE DEFENSE

188
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,790
SYSTEMS OUT.

189
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,659
SO THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP

190
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,627
