it's nice to feel at home in a place
you've always lived to finally know that
if someone ever did say your body is not
okay which one of us would be wrong it's
nice to move for fun because I like it
and not here in the back of my mind
should have got to this sooner
did you see that wobble did you see that
tremor to know that this body won't push
me forward but it also won't push me
back but I don't have to be enthusiastic
about what's in the mirror to know that
my body will no longer get in the way
that I now fully understand the
consequences are far fewer and I thought
they were for hating the way I look in
that dress and that if I want to do more
I don't necessarily have to weigh this
