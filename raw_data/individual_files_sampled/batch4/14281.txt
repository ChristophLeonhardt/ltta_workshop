is legalizing marijuana really a contentious issue among right-wingers well it can be it seems like conservative politicians are at odds with the voting population only one CPC MP longtime supporter of legalization Scott Reed voted for liberal bill c-45 that's the legislation that will make pot legally accessible to those of age but then you look at independent polling and it shows that the majority of Canadians are in support not only that but I got a little pushback from my fellow right-wingers on a recent piece that I did that weighed the pros and cons of this legislation does that mean I don't support legalization well I have Tim Owen leader of the Libertarian Party of Canada here with me we're gonna dig into a contentious issue amongst right-wingers it's gonna be a thing next summer of course I'm talking about the legalization of marijuana but first Tim I want to ask you about this phrase that you coined I want gay married couples to be able to protect their marijuana plants with guns that's pretty much everything that I want to hear from a politician but for our viewers that don't know much about your political stance can you kind of deconstruct that a little bit for them sure well a lot of people mistake that phrase as me promoting libertinism right the idea that I ought to be able to do whatever I want without any reciprocal responsibility or that I just want to be able to go get high and be left alone but the reality is that that you know it's a bit of a hook that slogan right you had the the bottom line of it it is I want to live in a society that gives people the freedom to make choices over their own property the over their own body I think that the best kind of society emerges from a government kind of substrate that is that is libertarian and and that people need to be free to make mistakes and they also need to be free to learn from the mistakes and to go on and flourish okay let's do this part issue what you just said kind of kind of gives people an idea of what you think oh I'll tell you what I think I think conservatives have it wrong I think marijuana is demonized it's kind of thought of as this gateway drug and and this drug that addicts kind of used but I can speak to this I am a medical cannabis user it has medical properties that doesn't mean that I ignore the fact that there are health concerns that come along with it I mean there are studies out there that outline how it can be dangerous to a developing brain but for me I kind of look at it as you know a pharmaceutical that's now going to be on offer over the counter what do you think yeah I mean obviously I agree I and to be honest with you I never realized how much of a medicine it was I didn't appreciate how much of a medicine it was into the last couple of years you know I've always been an advocate of listen you own your body if you own your body who has a right to tell you what you can and can't put into it and so I've always been in favor of it just from from a principled perspective of Liberty but you know I had the opportunity to testify as an expert witness in Allard versus Canada where a group of medical cannabis growers fought for their constitutional right essentially to grow their own medical cannabis and you know I was the expert witness from a public safety perspective because of my background as a as a paramedic and a fire Fire Department officer and so I rebooted series fire chief who said their complete safety hazard public safety hazard fire hazard mold hazard all these things but during that process I met so many cannabis users who said that it changed their life people that had been addicted to pharmaceutical opiates because they had an injury and and managed to get off of it because cannabis helped them deal with their pain and their symptoms the side effects weren't as dilatory us as as the opiates were I met people who had MS who were taking a whole host of drugs who used cannabis to help them cope with the day I have a nephew who has multiple seizures a day and the only thing that has found been found to work for him and give him any semblance of a life is Charlotte's Web which is a type of which is a cannabis product which actually has almost no psychoactive properties it doesn't make you high in other words but it gets rid of his seizures and so I started to see all the benefits what I saw was people with different different types of diseases and different symptoms working with growers and distributors to tailor-make a medicine that most closely fit their need and that to me this was a perfect example of how free market and medicine should work people are doing experiments on themselves with their own bodies trying to figure out what medicine is going to work best for them and I gotta tell you it was kind of beautiful and touching to see and to see the tears in the eyes of some of these people as they talked about how they've been able to manage their life because of this drug and how you know the government is threatening to take this away and remove their ability to manage their own health it was it was something else yeah and for me it's pretty it's pretty simple I use it for pain management and you know when I when I went into the the clinic I was thinking you know this is so it's so weird and I took for granted the medicinal properties as well but I mean it works for me so we both agree that this this needs to go through we both agree that pot should be legalized I did a video about legislation and I kind of got some flack for it but what the point of it was to kind of outline that the Liberals and the Alberta NDP aren't promising what they say aren't going to give us what they promised with this legislation they say you know we're going to keep it out of the hands of kids but you know they're not they're not bringing any punishment in for kids that have five grams with which equals like 20 joints or something like that they're saying you know they're going to take burden off of the legal system they say that they're going to make make a bunch of money but we had Minister Kathleen gamle come out and say that it's actually going to cost taxpayers to bring this legislation and so what do you think the way to bring this legislation in is the right way to bring it in right well I think you have to start with decriminalization right we got to stop putting people in jail who are essentially farmers and growers and and and users of this medicine but then the next thing we have to do is look at how you know what is the most responsive and responsible way to bring a product to market right is it is it through socialism where the government completely controls the means of production is it through crony capitalism where we give certain corporations monopoly rights to bring that to market but but exclude everyone else I think it's neither of those those are the two things that are on the table right now that the NDP and the Liberals are kind of squabbling over the details of but here's the option opportunity for conservatives and free marketeers to really get ahead of this game and say no this ought to be done in a condition of markets markets best regulate products they best regulate safety of products because store owners and producers of these products they can't simply can't flourish if they're not providing a safe and effective product and so what I would like to see is a complete free market to this I mean a government should be there to backstop the safety to provide regulations that protect minors but this should be left up to the people that are good at growing it and and that are there to serve the needs of their customers and and that's the proper way and that's the conservative message too and I mean if you if you meet some of these people that are growing it you know I was looking at doing an event I was down with my my candidate in Surrey White Rock and there's a number of conservative cannabis growers down there that are kind of hiding in the shadows because they're scared to come out and say anything because they they they they are conservative people but they know how they are stigmatized in conservative circles but these are people I mean I grew up on a farm in northern Alberta I know a farmer when I see one these are good people these these are people that are do not deserve to be Sigma ties and these are the people that I would prefer are in the market and leading the market I would prefer them as opposed to say Justin Trudeau's X campaign CFO who is a co-founder and major shareholder in tweed which is one of the few corporations that is getting of course license to print money by being able to have a license to grow cannabis so what is the conservative the principled right-wing stance to pot legislation in your mind well I would say you know typically conservativism from my perspective I think of free markets of capitalism and so that's the first thing but then I also think of social conservatism to a certain extent and and I would prefer to live in a socially conservative society myself and because of that I I know that you have to have freedom to sin right now government if you try to impose a social morally social order from on top it's it's you see the same results as when the left tries to impose morality the government gets this big hammer they tell you what you can and can't put into your body in terms of sugar or soft drinks or this food or that food or this product or that product and it creates a lot of negative unintended consequences and it gives government all this power and the result is often the exact opposite of what you you would expect to see so if you try to clamp down on obesity you tend to get more obesity if you try to clamp down on drugs you tend to get more of the problems associated with drugs drug addiction and criminality around them and so I would look to a place like poor chip orchha GLE where they decriminalized all drugs not just marijuana over a decade ago and I would say well look has the this social order become more conservative more of what social conservative want to live under or less and I would say it's become more of a socially conservative order addiction rates are down something like 50 percent there's far less crime and criminality because of decriminalization and the people that were once addicted have in a lot of cases been redeemed redeemed themselves pick themselves up gotten some self-worth and gotten jobs because they're not hiding in the shadows trying to avoid the club of the the moral Club of government so how do you bring that message to conservatives then I know it's a tough go at it like I said it is it is a contentious issue well you know I don't think it's it's as contentious or as tough as you might think you know when I was campaigning in Calgary Signal Hill some of my biggest supporters the the ones that were working hardest for me on the street were the ones that were we're going door-to-door for me were social conservatives and they they obviously had some questions for me because they they googled my name and they saw that me my want gay married couples protect their marijuana plants with guns but all it took was a five-minute conversation with them to say look I I agree with you I want to live in the same kind of society you you do and I I think that we've lost our way and it's because we've given government jurisdiction over morality and we're seeing it become corrupted as a result you know in terms of marriage I want government right out of marriage I don't want the government to be able to license marriage because now when the left gets government they're gonna tell you your church who you can and can't married and and it's the same with cannabis or anything else morality is best best emerges from the bottom up with what Edmund Burke called the little platoons right the church's the charity groups the family the community and when you live in a libertarian society and I mean that from the Edmund Burke perspective where society is built from the bottom up and people bear the personal but the personal cost of their own mistakes rather than forcing the cost of their mistakes onto others while you see a much more socially conservative order emerge people are thinking long-term they're not thinking about hedonistic activity and how they can get immediate gratification and so this is the message I think conservatives need to get out there and get ahead of and and turn the tide because we're gonna see also it's a negative unintended consequences for this and honestly I don't think it's that hard for conservatives to get that they grok this they did in my riding every single social conservative I talked to understood that yeah you're right as much as we've tried to legislate things from on high it hasn't worked it's probably backfired on us and now it's time to get back to true principled conservatism from the bottom up not the top down yeah you're probably right actually I was reading a poll 63 percent of Canadians support legislation so I guess sometimes we get mixed up that even though our politicians don't support it our conservative politicians don't Canadian citizens do Tim thank you so much for joining me it's always such a great pleasure to talk to you where can people
