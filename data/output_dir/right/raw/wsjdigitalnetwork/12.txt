00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:05,007
The US Army is researching an
anesthetic injection that could

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:07,369
be key in alleviating
symptoms of PTSD,

3
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:10,922
a disorder that impacts hundreds
of thousands of veterans.

4
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,999
Early clinical experience
with the shots,

5
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,739
known as
Stellate Ganglion Blocks,

6
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:16,434
have produced promising results.

7
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,535
With troops experiencing near
immediate relief of anxiety,

8
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:21,682
hyper-vigilance, and
other symptoms,

9
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:23,600
according to military
researchers.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,390
In the procedure, doctors
inject a local anesthetic into

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,624
the right side of the neck,

12
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:31,430
guiding the needle to the area
around the Stellate Ganglion.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,729
A group of nerves that is part
of a bridge between the brain

14
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:37,980
and the body, called
the Cervical sympathetic chain.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,689
This chain is part of
the nervous system that prepares

16
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:43,459
the body for
perceived dangers, and

17
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:45,702
regulates the fight-or-flight
response.

18
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:48,216
Sometimes, it can become
dysfunctional, or

19
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,896
activated inappropriately.

20
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:53,451
The SGB injection temporarily
blocks signals between the brain

21
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:54,570
and the body.

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,510
The precise mechanism for how
this assists with PTSD symptoms

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,150
is not fully understood.

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,260
But the SGB seems to reset
the sympathetic nervous system.

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,582
Doctors who have
administered the injections,

26
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:09,117
say they firmly
believe it works.

27
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:10,830
But the wider military
is waiting for

28
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,648
the results from a controlled
trial, currently under way,

29
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,390
before they endorse
the treatment.

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,060
The drug is marketed under
the brand name Naropin, and

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,520
costs less than $2.00 a dose.

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,290
Most patients require
just one injection, but

33
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,320
doctors say some return for
a second shot.

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,680
The shot is not
touted as a cure, but

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,690
researchers hope it can be used
to erase symptoms, so that

36
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,290
therapy and pharmaceuticals can
achieve long term achievements.
