00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:10,653

ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN

5
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:13,589
IN THE NEWS THAT HAS BEEN AROUND

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,589
IN THE NEWS THAT HAS BEEN AROUND

7
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:14,557
HIM ALL MORNING NOW AND THIS

8
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:16,759
IDEA THAT HE WENT TO THE

9
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:17,727
WHITE HOUSE TO POTENTIALLY

10
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,028
EITHER TENDER HIS RESIGNATION OR

11
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:19,028
EITHER TENDER HIS RESIGNATION OR

12
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:19,562
BE FIRED.

13
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,031
THIS IS FROM SARAH SANDERS RIGHT

14
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:22,031
THIS IS FROM SARAH SANDERS RIGHT

15
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,333
NOW.

16
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,701
AT THE REQUEST OF DEPUTY

17
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:25,435
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN,

18
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:25,435
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN,

19
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:28,371
HE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE HAD

20
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:29,906
AN EXTENDED CONVERSATION TO

21
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,908
DISCUSS THE RECENT NEWS STORY

22
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:33,042
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS AT THE

23
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,645
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY

24
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:37,347
AND HAD FULL SCHEDULED LEADERS

25
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:39,149
FROM AROUND THE WORLD, THEY WILL

26
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:39,149
FROM AROUND THE WORLD, THEY WILL

27
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,850
MEET ON THURSDAY WHEN THE

28
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,253
PRESIDENT RETURNS TO

29
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,088
WASHINGTON, D.C., THURSDAY.

30
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:46,323
>> Kennedy: HOW WE ARE, THAT

31
00:00:46,323 --> 00:00:48,525
PLAYS INTO MY THEORY THAT THIS

32
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:49,259
IS ALL TO GET KAVANAUGH OFF OF

33
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,130
THE FRONT PAGE.

34
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,265
THURSDAY IS A DUAL TESTIMONY

35
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,299
BETWEEN DR. CHRISTINE FORD AND

36
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:57,000
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH WHERE

37
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,702
THEY’RE BOTH GOING TO GO BEFORE

38
00:00:58,702 --> 00:00:59,436
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,

39
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,071
SHALL GO FIRST AND HE’LL GO

40
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:01,405
SECOND.

41
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:03,373
WILL PUBLICLY MAKE THOSE ON THE

42
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,141
MAKE ACCUSATIONS UNDER OATH THAT

43
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:05,141
MAKE ACCUSATIONS UNDER OATH THAT

44
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,643
HE WILL ANSWER TO THEM.

45
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:09,112
THIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC DAY,

46
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,081
INCREDIBLY PIVOTAL NOT ONLY FOR

47
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,750
THE SUPREME COURT BUT FOR JUDGE

48
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,517
BRETT KAVANAUGH’S FUTURE CAREER

49
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:17,921
AS A JURIST AND IF THIS IS

50
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:19,323
HAPPENING, IF ROD ROSENSTEIN

51
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:20,791
MIGHT RESIGN, MAKE IT FIRED ON

52
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,193
THURSDAY, JUST TAKES SOME OF

53
00:01:23,193 --> 00:01:23,594
THESE AWAY.

54
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:24,261
>> Christopher: WAS IN THE

55
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,362
NEWS THAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN

56
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:25,996
FIRED OR RESIGNED?

57
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:29,967
EITHER WAY, WAS KIND OF

58
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:30,901
UNDERCUTS A LOT OF THE REPORTING

59
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:30,901
UNDERCUTS A LOT OF THE REPORTING

60
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,336
AND I WONDER HOW MANY SOURCES

61
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:34,305
WERE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THIS

62
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:36,140
REPORTING PERIOD >> Harris:

63
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,274
THAT IS A JOURNALISM THAT I’M

64
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:42,346
TALKING ABOUT.

65
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:44,115
TO FIGURE OUT WHO KNEW WHAT AND

66
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:47,318
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING

67
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,352
FOX NEWS, KIND OF REPORTING IT

68
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:50,321
AS IT’S HAPPENING BUT WE ARE

69
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:51,856
TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES

70
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:52,590
BECAUSE OF THE ARTICLE THAT’S

71
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,559
COME OUT, BECAUSE OF THE

72
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,393
CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS THAT ARE

73
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:55,960
REPORTING SHOWED.

74
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,096
BUT YOU DID HAVE SOME THAT HAVE

75
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:00,631
JUMPED THE SHARK SO FAR.

76
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:01,332
>> Christopher: IS NOT A GOOD

77
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:04,736
LOOK FOR REPORTERS AND I DON’T

78
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,170
THINK JONATHAN SWANN DOES IS BUT

79
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,170
THINK JONATHAN SWANN DOES IS BUT

80
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,773
FOR A LOT OF THEM, THE BAR IS

81
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:09,774
ETHICS HERE, RESISTANCE HERE,

82
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:11,443
AND THEY’RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

83
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,912
WRITE HISTORY CLASSES ON THIS IN

84
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:13,912
WRITE HISTORY CLASSES ON THIS IN

85
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:15,113
THE FUTURE AND HOW JOURNALISM

86
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:15,814
CHANGED UNDER TRUMP AND IF IT

87
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:19,551
CAN NEVER COME BACK.

88
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:20,552
>> Harris: AGAIN, ALWAYS A

89
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:21,319
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY TALK TODAY

90
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:21,319
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY TALK TODAY

91
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,956
AND SOMETHING COMES AFTER.

92
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:26,057
>> Jessica: THAT’S WHAT I

93
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:27,759
THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

94
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,526
JONATHAN SWAN HAS BEEN GREAT AND

95
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:28,526
JONATHAN SWAN HAS BEEN GREAT AND

96
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:31,830
A LOT OF THINGS SO I DON’T THINK

97
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,830
A LOT OF THINGS SO I DON’T THINK

98
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,100
UNDERCUT HIM AS A REPORTER HERE

99
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,901
HAS BEEN QUITE CLEAR THAT CHIEF

100
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,536
OF STAFF JOHN KELLY IS QUITE

101
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:38,804
FOND OF HIM, SEEMS LIKE THAT’S

102
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:41,273
HIS LEAK.

103
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:44,176
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT

104
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:45,344
ROSENSTEIN WOULD GO IN THERE AND

105
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:45,344
ROSENSTEIN WOULD GO IN THERE AND

106
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,579
TALK TO HIM AND REMAIN IN THE

107
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:47,846
JOB.

108
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:48,714
THAT IT WOULD BE A CLEARING OF

109
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:50,983
THE AIR BECAUSE I THINK THE

110
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,551
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED

111
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:53,952
ENOUGH TIMES THAT FIRING JEFF

112
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:54,787
SESSIONS OR ROD ROSENSTEIN IS

113
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:57,356
INCREDIBLY BAD FOR MIDTERM

114
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:58,524
PROCESS AND IN NOVEMBER, THERE

115
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:02,327
WILL BE A FULL REEVALUATION.

116
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:03,462
>> Melissa: THAT COULD EXACTLY

117
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:04,997
BE WHY WE SAW THAT LEAKED TO

118
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:05,664
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" AT THE

119
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,732
PRESIDENT KNOWS IT WOULD BE

120
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:07,967
UNWISE TO FIRE HIM AHEAD OF THE

121
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:10,135
MIDTERMS AND THERE ARE THOSE

122
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:10,836
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT WHO ARE

123
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:11,704
LEAKING TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

124
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:12,738
AND TRYING TO GOAD HIM INTO

125
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,574
DOING IT THE SAME WAY.

126
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:16,842
>> Kennedy: SPEAKING OF LEAKS,

127
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:18,277
IF YOU HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT

128
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,712
STORIES CIRCULATING WITHIN THE

129
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:23,015
WHITE HOUSE AND YOU SEE THEM IN

130
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:24,216
FOUR DIFFERENT PLACES, YOU CAN

131
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:25,818
THEN SEE WHO WAS A SOURCE FOR

132
00:03:25,818 --> 00:00:00,000
WHICH PUBLICATION AND THIS MAY
