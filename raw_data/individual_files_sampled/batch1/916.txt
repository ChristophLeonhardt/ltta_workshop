I am family okay with Malika Bulow who is in Park City Utah we are wrapping up our coverage of this year's Sundance Film Festival hello there Malika hi fami thanks for that I am here alongside filmmaker Cody Lucic and indigenous activists courtesy Ozzy and Mark Tilson jr. so right now you are live in the stream and on YouTube and remember that if you want to add a comment you can do so live and we will try and get that comment right into this show hi I'm Robbie Barrett I'm a scientist from West Virginia I just moved to Silicon Valley and I'm in the stream the movement against construction of a multi-billion dollar pipeline across Native American territories last year sparked solidarity among ended indigenous peoples and civil rights activists in Akita the Battle of Standing Rock we get to see up-close the stories of those who gathered in the US state of North Dakota to say a no to the Dakota access pipeline have a look these things that I saw were in a dream that I had a honey a long time ago anyway my spiritual teacher was alive then and in this dream that I had him and I we were walking through a camp as we walked through this camp there was all these flags different kinds of flags and there was canopies and tents and they were many of many he was crowded and I asked him is this a powwow are we at a powwow where are we where are we what is this so the next day I woke up and I went to visit him and I explained the dream to him and I asked him his thoughts on it and he had no answer for me many activists known as water protectors were hospitalised over the course of the demonstrations injured by police officials trying to disperse crowds US federal courts repeatedly denied requests to suspend the project now in operation following an order last January from President Donald Trump to expedite its completion a number of water protectors were prosecuted for their actions and in the six months since the pipeline has leaked for multiple times helping us to unpack the legacy of Standing Rock and joining us via Skype in Tucson Arizona we have genuine a she's a Native American journalist who writes about indigenous affairs around the world she also cover the Standing Rock movement for Indian country but we're going to start a conversation with Malika who's in Park City thanks for me Kody you are the director of aqui cheats the Battle of Standing Rock and this has been billed as the only native made film about the uprising at Standing Rock tell us how it even came to be well I was actually already in North Dakota working on another production and when I had heard about what was going on over at Standing Rock I just said basically just dropped me off over there and so I got dropped off over there and I had run into a couple of relatives a couple cousins and some friends that were already there in camp so I kind of just fell right in the camp and I had my laptop and my camera with me so I just I just started doing these little small little video clips because I wanted to help to spread the message and get the word out and raise awareness about what was going on there and after I was there for about a week I actually got hit up by Sundance and by the redford Center and they actually asked me if I had heard anything about Santa Rock and I was like yeah I'm actually here right now and they're like what are you doing I said I'm making these little clips and they were like whoa can we see them and I said sure so I so I sent them to them and they were like wow these are great can we blast these across our networks and I said yeah and so I just want to take a pause there because they may not know the significance of this but the redford Center and the people behind this Film Festival don't often just go to people and say we want you that was that was that was the thing and so so after about a week went by we got millions of views on those clips that they did that they posted for us and after about a week went by they they came back and I said hey do you want to do a feature documentary out there and I was like no because you know I want to do these little clips and I want to fight and I knew if I was tied down to a feature-length documentary I wouldn't be able to release all those clips I would actually have to hold on to the footage through the whole time and so I said no and then some people started bringing it to my attention they're like you know Cody they don't normally reach out like that and and and then they kept reaching out to me and they were trying to stress the fact that there was you know all these other filmmakers that are gonna be coming out to these non-native filmmakers and they wanted they wanted to make sure there was at least one you know native film crew on the ground telling the story from the inside and it started to register in my head and then I seen 50 non-native filmmakers flocking out there all trying to tell the story and it was just cameras everywhere all across camp and tonight I just sort of came to the realization that this was a massive responsibility actually and now you're here we're in Park City the Sundance Film Festival and we are sitting next to two protagonists in your documentary why them how did how did you go about picking the people that so in thinking about how to frame this story of Standing Rock it was it was like standing rock became this sort of worldwide known like thing that was going on and people just started flocking there just to come there and take selfies and to say that they were there and to camp and to hang out and they weren't actually there to actually stop the pipeline and that would have been so easy just to pick one of those characters because they're like camera follow me around you know but I really wanted to find the characters who actually had something to do with fighting and stopping the Dakota access pipeline and this was a difficult task because a lot of these people you know they didn't really want cameras following him around were under constant FBI surveillance and so that was that was that was kind of difficult but then through time you know you had to earn trust and respect and yeah so that's kind of how I got to some of these characters yes so there was a lot of cameras you know what I mean there'd be days where a lot of people would be marching and shutting down construction and you have all these people non-native people just in your face you know with cameras and it's just like you're already in a high intense situation and so we actually started just kicking away people that were just really annoying you know and they were just trying to profit off of what we were doing and trying to benefit and push their own content without actually consulting us but after a while you start to see the same people showing up over and over and you you know you're like who's that guy I mean it took a while but I I actually have a question for Cody really because of the great risk that was involved my first encounter with Cody Luce which the director was was of him really kind of taking on a very combat style role with his camera his DSLR just days before what we called the treaty camp raid which was on October 27th 2016 and I saw him in this very kind of covert kind of way with his camera going to get some shots that could be really telling and in part of this narrative and Cody I just like to know you know what kind of risk did you feel like you were you were facing under this kind of militarized threat yeah so I mean there was always bullets whizzing by there was always you know percussion grenades going off sound cannons mace tear gas I mean I was I was tear gassed a couple dozen times mace directly in my by those nice cannons maybe five times I was shot with rubber bullets so there was all there was always that and there was there was also always this sort of like you know being the only native film out there and this huge conversation going on now about about natives taking back control of their own narrative is it's just it sort of came a huge conversation at this time also so there was a lot of weight on my shoulders as far as like telling the story properly you know because I think the narrative has has been for so long is that the reason why natives don't get to tell their own stories and why non natives get to tell them is because they're not as good of filmmakers you know that the non natives are better that's why they get the big budgets to tell all these all these big Hollywood movies and whatnot so so there was there was a lot of weight on my shoulders beyond just the bullets whizzing by out there on the front line you know and I mean there was like like for example for my hard drive we're out there camping you know and so I dug a little hole in the back side of my tepee where I'd stash my hard drives every day when I'd go out on action or whatever and then like I was talking about before just being able to film these characters who were actually doing something out there you know they didn't want cameras following them around you know I mean not only there was a there was a couple of requests from Cody Luce each to record some of our planning sessions I was like no that's that sounds really incriminating opens up a whole legal liability and I didn't want any cameras Ammar bear intimately but mark there was there was a lot of strategizing on camera there was a lot of you talking through this documentary it's a work in progress right now but I see that you're an integral part of what happened what could have perhaps been done better I want to share our audience a little clip where you are welcoming some well-known celebrities into the camp have a look at this this morning they actually showed up in force to shut down the blockade and warned that the camp is going to be rated good Mark Ruffalo and Jesse Jackson who showed up I don't think they wanted to do a high profile arrest of the Reverend Jesse Jackson it's scary and see people have guns on a public road where all people are doing is gathering there's no weaponry over there there's nothing of violence where do we live this can't be America that was taken just now you saw it and somehow they're able to scramble it data like text messages and phone calls are being monitored by law enforcement some dark dark dark stuff going on well when I see from your input into this film is that you are planning a war there are skirmishes there are battles there are conflicts but I didn't quite see Standing Rock as that until we went right inside what is the story that only this film is telling that we haven't seen from other filmmakers and from other journalists I think I think this is like a lesson on how movements work how movements don't work a path towards victory and how movements sometimes sabotage themselves very simply what we needed to do for victory is to continuously go at our enemies of the energy transfer partners who is building the Dakota access pipeline and it shows a lot of our struggles in our conflict that's not just necessarily outside forces it's almost as if the militarized police and the mercenaries were a force of nature that we were ready to fight that we were ready to combat that we were ready to outflank and outsmart but ultimately are defeated by our internal struggles yes can I put this to you Jenni this is coming a live comment on YouTube so watching this program on YouTube room says it doesn't matter how much the people protest the powers-that-be will always just sweep them aside that's a legacy question the impact does standing Rock go ahead Jenni what do you think yeah that really what I think most profound about the clip that was just displayed here because it really gets at the heart of the actual absence that was felt at Standing Rock at a most critical hour that footage came on the eve of what I had mentioned before was this this militarized raid of what was known as the treaty camp and the intensity was high the scrambling of all the digital equipment that was recorded by the indigenous peoples themselves there was really actually no media on the scene and I think that that is another strong narrative that I don't think we've come to really discuss as much is the importance of that social media played in this movement and how it really was a galvanizing force around the world I wanted to bring up this tweet here we got from someone named Indian viewpoint that's their hand oh and yes I know you wanted to get in there so I'll direct this to you they right I would say that the no DAP will struggle and of course that's that hashtag Dakota access pipeline is best viewed within the context of defending sovereignty and the right to defend the water and land not necessarily a civil rights issue so this was about sovereignty people said do you think it was framed in that way and do you think that that this film helped to change that framing well for a lot of people that I was there with from the beginning to the end we weren't there in thinking about civil rights or you know a big part of it was treaty treaty rights were being violated as they always have been but it was about the water you know we're all downstream it was a human rights issue you know we were fighting other people to fight for the those people so I think that was one of the biggest things that was consistently like spoken about between our own circles was that we're here for the water at the end of the day and that thought is actually backed up again by youtubers see Drake saying this is about water rights not a need for gas clean water and a clean environment is the right of all people mark I see you nodding I really want to get your take on this about the movement the Standing Rock movement Delaney Robert asks on Twitter again watching the show the Occupy movement and no dabble resistance both represent the effect of frontline encampments unpredictability fluidity in action implementation and tactics this is what standing rock has given the world agreed that was very articulately said and I agree I think for us I'm from Pine Ridge I'm Oglala Lakota on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation my family and most of my tribe drink the water that south of Standing Rock in south of the Dakota access pipeline we came up there to fight for our survival and primarily other people have many opinions about this but it comes back to reiterate well what jaws just said was it comes back to water we came up there to fight to protect the water continuously and always that's the heart of this struggle and there you can talk about treaties we can part incorporate issues around sovereignty and correcting the injustice is of the past but primarily this was us fighting for our existence for our survival and the right to have clean water you know may have just been won tribes fight for clean drinking water and to honor the treaties it was emblematic of what's been happening around the indigenous world for generations this collusion of government forces and and militarized policing I mean as we heard throughout the movement at Standing Rock it became so much more than just a pipeline and that's why in popular view Standing Rock is being seen as the greatest indigenous led movement of our modern times and I'm wondering with that kind of wait what these filmmakers feel like as this becomes a work in progress what kind of mark this needs to make because it is such a a token of a historical record yeah so I mean also ultimately when making this movie we were making it for the Native community for the indigenous peoples in mind we knew that it would you know that the other non natives would watch it other would like it but it was specifically being made for the indigenous people and it's because our generation we were all inspired by the aim generation the American Indian Movement the generation of our parents and our uncles in our in our auntie's and that has allowed us to be able to do what we're doing today we're sort of building upon what they lay down for us and so in this movie we're showing what we're doing now in this generation and so hopefully this film can help inspire the next generation that nine ten eleven to twelve year olds right now who will watch us and be like damn those guys are cool you know the out there fighting for our land and our water locking down you know scouting point over maps in the middle of the night you know so hopefully that's the that's the ultimate goal for this is to be able to help in inspiring the next generation Maura on Twitter she says it's very important to discuss the significance of indigenous films participation at the Sundance Film Festival and of course this being one of them they're actually eight indigenous led films here this year but I want to share this tweet from the Redford Center because this happened at the premiere on Wednesday Reference Center writes we'd like to share this moving scene from yesterday from yesterday's a caseta film premiere win standing lock water protectors featured in the film join the filmmakers on stage in song have a listen they write thank you to water protectors everywhere for enduring these fights and filling us all with help Cody what did that moment mean for you right there when we all walked up on stage it was to be filming all these water protectors and living with them and fighting with them and to be able to show this movie to them for the first time and bring them up on stage so it's not just me during the Q&A where I actually open it up to the audience who can ask any any one of them a question that they want to know I think oh good because because I did what I set out to do and I'm able to share this with everybody who was involved and not just try to be like me me me me you know but try to bring everybody up there also so that they have a chance to talk and people have a chance to talk with him mark there's a moment in the film where you are welcoming some veterans they are the veterans who stand for standing Rock there are thousands of people at the camp and they also are thinking that maybe maybe something could actually happen and you could achieve your aims have a look at the video thousands and thousands of people come throughout the country for this one moment and all they want to do is just step up we'll take a rubber bullet for you now what did we say no thanks there was a lot of people who really expected like the tide to turn at that point and basically it was just it was chaos and disorganization it was heartbreaking it was heartbreaking to have the numbers to have the vision to have the willing people everything in place all that we needed to do is simply go simply choose to win and then win well this is so painful to watch to hear to to watch being documented where we were standing right now where you were standing well now what's happened you you kind of caught me this is one of the most painful moments of my life that I take a deep personal responsibility in my failure has a leader and has somebody who very possibly we could have stopped the Dakota access pipeline currently the Dakota access pipeline is constructed and the water the oil is flowing underneath the Missouri River and there's been there's been several leaks already the fight continues the fight continues of going after other pipelines the final stage of the Dakota access pipeline is called the Bayou bridge pipeline and there are other pipeline fights throughout the country and into Canada and Mexico that are continuous and ongoing so the fight didn't end at Standing Rock it went elsewhere it has spread throughout the country I'm glad you actually said that I want to share two tweets with their audience the first is from Daniela alcaman she shares a picture of what the area looks like now all that remains were all the node apple camps once stood and and it is pretty remarkable but picking up on what you said mark there's also a tweet here from big Indian Jia C he writes the attacks on native lands have never stopped never dapple was an attack on native land Keystone the Keystone oil pipeline is an attack on native land he also mentions bears ears nuts here in Utah where we are today that's a National Monument designated by former President Obama and then drastically reduced in size under President Trump so this is an ongoing fight yes what is it you're keeping your eye on next for me personally it's uh there's only a few people that are there at the end of the day there was thousands and thousands of people showed up but at the end of the day dead of winter with holding a shield there's about ten of you and so it's about finding those people because they're across Turtle Island and building these people up and healing with them and starting over you know so I'm just wondering Cody when we're looking at impact I've got here from this signal from the Smithsonian Institute one of the signs from Standing Rock it is now going to be a part of the Smithsonian it's one part of their collections it shows the power solidarity as far as your work is concerned I know it's a work in progress your film what do you want to happen to it who do you want it to a building I want it to appeal to anybody who feels that they're hopeless that they can stand up in their own communities without weapons they can use their bodies they can figure out ways how to stop construction I have the hopes that it can inspire them so that they can do it in their in their own communities even just what the handful of people and I think as both of these two guys realized right here that sometimes are actually most the time we were way more effective with just with just a handful of people then when we had 10,000 people I'm just going to show you where you can see more showings of the battle standing Rock here on the Sundance Institute page it's still working progress it's not finished yet but keep a look out for it obviously thank you so much to all of our guests today and all of the filmmakers who joined us this week from the annual Sundance Film Festival and we look forward to hearing more about your films in the future until then you know we'll you'll find Mallika and myself will be online using hashtag a day stream thanks for watching
