the media are actively complicit in this anti-israel blood libel in this anti Jewish blood libel and they are actively complicit at this point in what amounts to a blood libel against Jews suggesting the Jews are indiscriminately shooting people on mass it is a lie it is not true hey here is tape of Palestinians attempting to breach the border fence Israel has been dropping leaflets all over Gaza saying do not try to approach the border fence or you will be shot that's because they've been using the border fence trying to break through the border fence in order to kill Jews yesterday they were saying openly there are Palestinians we're telling the press openly what their goal was it was so funny the press was trying to say well you guys don't really mean any of this stuff right you don't really mean any of this stuff on NPR one of the NPR anchors asked a Gaza and with a kite with a swastika on it why he was flying us kite with the swastika on it and he said the Jews go crazy when you mentioned Hitler so Steve Inskeep was the anchor he said he asked if he knows the Israelis are using the swastikas to discredit gazans right so the so NPR trying to change the story into well you know they're selectively choosing your kite with the swastika you know that's that's what they're doing here so what is the Gaza and se says it's what we mean we want them to burn they're not being subtle there's no subtlety here okay the Gaza Strip is filled with people who want is real destroyed and want to kill Jews and those people have elected people in the Hamas government in order to do just that if they don't like what's going on in the Gaza Strip well they're supposedly supposed to have elections now there are a lot of people who are peace-loving I'm sure in the Gaza Strip but not the people who are approaching the border yesterday those are not people who are interested in peace and they're certainly interested in being used as human shields by Hamas there is no question that this is what Hamas is doing they've admitted this hey here's here's this tape of Palestinians attempting to breach the border wall hey you can see that these guys are bringing sandbags toward the border wall and now you see this guy oh this kid they're sending out kids and teenagers to bring tires to the border wall and then burn the tires as a distraction is a smokescreen and then you can see all these guys hiding behind the hill they've been trying to go up to the border fence with bolt cutters and trying to cut through the border fence this is one of the things they've been doing also Israel had experienced yesterday a serious problem okay does this look peaceful process to you it's not peaceful prozis a giant clouds of black smoke that are coming from tyre fires that are being used to obscure the activities of people along the border hey the IDF the Israeli Defense Forces they tweeted out and they tweeted out tape of yesterday of shooting attack on Israeli forces you're told that Israel was firing on unarmed people the IDF tweeted out yesterday afternoon the IDF received intelligence the Kumasi operatives were preparing to cross through the security fence from northern Gaza IDF Special Forces arrived at the scene and eight armed terrorists hurled pipe bombs and grenades at the soldiers and the security fence and they've made the tape available for anyone to look at online but we're being told by the media that Israel is the real problem here Israel obviously is the serious issue all of the evidence is that Hamas is using human shields that Hamas is attempting to create headlines and they're doing just that they're doing just that they're happy to do just that according to the Israeli Security Agency Yahia usually is a Hamas member arrested on April 29th he told them now Hamas was instructing its activists to cut the fence that they want their activity to be seen quote in the international media as a popular uprising and not as a violent action led by its militants and the Hamas members are embedded in the general population for purposes of public relations another Palestinian terrorist captured by Israel said that quote Hamas militants in civilian clothes encourage children to try to cross the fence in order to steal IDF equipment in other words Hamas is using human shields they're using women they are using children they are trying to breach the fence their plan here is that they the operatives are not gonna breach the fence are gonna let women and children do it and then they're going to rush through into Israel and attempt to kill as many Jews as possible nevermind the Hamas has participated in an ongoing war with Israel since its election in 2006 they fought as their own 2006 2008 2012 2014 and now hey never mind that it must be the Israelis it must be these it must be Ivanka Trump this must be a bank of trumps fault you know before Ivanka Trump know this was happening before about the troubles like Hamas was an evil terrorist group trying to kill people it wasn't like they committed homicide bombings trying to murder people no no they would never do anything like that that would be crazy they're nice people they're really great by the way here's some here's some here's some of the protesters chanting death to America and death to the scientists yesterday very nice people instead to the Zionists yeah just charming charming folks by the way good indicator that you're not involved in normal protesting but you've got your face covered like that because you don't want the Israeli troops to know exactly who you are well the White House did the right thing here the White House said the Colossus is to blame so here's a rash shot from the White House doing the right thing what a difference between the Trump administration the Obama administration the Obama administration constantly looking for an excuse to blame the only democracy in the Middle East for defending itself but Raja not doing that at the White House good for him well we believe that you know Hamas is responsible for these for these tragic deaths that their rather cynical exploitation of the situation it is what is what's leading to these deaths and we want them stopped and that obviously is true Jared Kushner said the same thing yesterday at the Jerusalem embassy everybody was was aware that this is going on in Gaza and kosher said listen the people who are provoking violence are the problem that would be Hamas
