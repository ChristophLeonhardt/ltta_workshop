3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,170
and books so Barry<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contentious Oh Ted</font>

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">just oh oh I think we have sweet year</font>

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,610
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say youtubers talking writing</font>

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">books what's your immediate reaction oh</font>

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,619
I wish it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really wish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,380
and about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year ago it was actually</font>

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,050
very excited I was so excited because I

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,670
saw all of these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,310
opinion we're putting in a legit amount

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,560
of effort yeah um it turned out that

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,710
that was an injustice the sauce and and

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,290
slowly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the layers have been peeled back</font>

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,070
yeah and I just find it incredibly

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,379
despicable now I think part of the thing

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,230
the biggest factor that makes me hate it

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,489
is the volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it feels like every</font>

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,399
single bigger youtuber is publishing a

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,899
book yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to me just doesn't</font>

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,809
equate quality with quantity<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

22
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,750
balance seems off sounding like all the

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,640
way up like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can't possibly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be that</font>

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,549
many books that need to be published

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,210
from bigger youtubers yeah that are also

26
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,400
not for just money do you think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,619
think of it as celebrity which referees

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:14,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of cases I mean there are some</font>

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">exceptions that I think like Anna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hearts</font>

30
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">book it looks exactly yeah that's the</font>

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,280
thing there are definitely exceptions

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,439
yeah but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they get him with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">volume yeah its sheer volume and I think</font>

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,119
does everyone understand ya know it ties

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,430
it does it's awful if there's so many of

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,040
them the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them again</font>

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,110
exceptions all around but the majority

38
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,439
of them have this kind of memoir element

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that irks me yeah also I'm</font>

40
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,250
proud of myself for just using the word

41
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,520
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> tonight hurts me because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,229
majority of these people are in their

43
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,509
early 20s right maybe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their late 20s</font>

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,899
definitely in their 20s right um and in

45
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">my opinion it's bizarrely mmm snooty</font>

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,909
will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll say it nicely a suti to</font>

47
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,790
think that your life is already so

48
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,229
worthy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that these</font>

49
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,550
people have not accomplished things

50
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,440
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everybody has</font>

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,250
accomplished 12 year olds yeah

52
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen 30 40 like any age who have</font>

53
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,300
accomplished interesting and powerful

54
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,220
things but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something is</font>

55
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,620
taken away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's already at 25</font>

56
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,230
you think oh this is publishable yeah i

57
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,390
also just depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the tone of it is</font>

58
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was like a again it comes back to</font>

59
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,890
celebs<font color="#E5E5E5"> you was bio</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> creamy and I would</font>

60
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,570
just to expand on that a bit like a lot

61
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,500
of what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it is that</font>

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,780
celebrity autobiography to make the

63
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,580
publishing of smaller books and new

64
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,250
right yes which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very important this</font>

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,410
yeah is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pushed the publishing</font>

76
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,690
industry to actually have money yes to

77
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,870
then publish people who are like which

78
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,020
I've seen more art type stuff yeah I'm

79
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,550
like that no I don't usually get

80
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,320
published because it doesn't have the

81
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,989
promise of selling as much as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> square</font>

82
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,900
root just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting my pastoral um yeah no</font>

83

86
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I'm not saying that these books</font>

87
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,290
shouldn't be published because they do

88
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,560
you have a merit the industry not least

89
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,640
also there are people who do want to

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,410
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I just that is gonna be a</font>

91
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,510
value in it of itself but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

92
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,280
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like that yeah miley</font>

94
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,430
memoir that that feeling of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

95
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,320
to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a book and the book that i</font>

96
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,060

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a memoir of my life in my</font>

98
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,230
experience that to me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of goes</font>

99
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,450
against the spirit of what we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

100
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,220
on youtube money youtubers so much about

101
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,440
community in collaboration and whatever

102
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,790
your type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of videos whether they're</font>

103
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,050
challenge videos will put videos or

104
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,880
videos or whatever they may all go in

105
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way and I feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the book</font>

106
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,670
doesn't the books<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm seeing aren't</font>

107
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,200
celebrating that right what they're

108
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,910
celebrating is like this it's very

109
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,649
traditional way of talking about

110
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,170
ourselves and about celebrity yeah I

111
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,790
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually it's an interesting</font>

112
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,980
reflection of where I kind of feel

113
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,080
YouTube culture is going kind of has

114
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,870
become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a business and it has</font>

115
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,430
become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a self-centered thing</font>

116
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,080
where it's one person trying to build

117
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,570
their brand of and the solution she was

118
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,420
pushed yes no definitely has and so I

119
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,070
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there has kind of been a</font>

120
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,030
reflection of that in in this entire

121
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">annamma not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phenomenon but let me know</font>

122
