BY PHONE NOW AND AS PIERRE SAID,

84
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,772
WE HAVE SEEN A PATTERN HERE.

85
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,340
WE KNOW THAT ISIS HAS CALLED ON 

86
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,843
SUPPORTERS TO USE VEHICLES LIKE 

87
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,043
THIS.

88
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,679
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.

89
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,547
ISIS AND AL QAEDA HAVE URGED 

90
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:31,150
PEOPLE IN WESTERN COUNTRIES TO 

91
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,819
USE CARS, KNIVES, ANYTHING THEY 

92
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,556
CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON, AND TO 

93
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,657
CONDUCT ATTACKS AT SO-CALLED 

94
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,260
SOFT TARGETS, PLACES WHERE THE 

95
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,260
PUBLIC CONGREGATES, PLACES THAT 

96
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,762
ARE DIFFICULT TO SECURE.

97
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,564
SO WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

98
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,733
MOTIVE WAS BEHIND THIS ATTACK OR

99
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,367
THIS INCIDENT, BUT YOU CAN BET 

100
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:49,669
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE 

101
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,370
RAPIDLY TRYING TO, ONE, FIGURE 

102
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,439
OUT IF THIS IS TERRORISM 

103
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:53,672
RELATED.

104
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:54,974
AND IF IT IS, FIGURE OUT IF 

105
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,142
THERE ARE ANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT 

106
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,577
ARE WORKING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL.

107
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,646
>> AND PRESUMABLY THIS DID NOT 

108
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,114
SEEM TO BE A SUICIDE ATTACK.

109
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,448
THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN INTO 

110
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,884
CUSTODY A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM 

111
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,220
THE AREA WHERE HE HIT THOSE 

112
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,021
CIVILIANS, JOHN.

113
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,455
>> NO, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

114
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,657
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT IS 

115
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:12,558
SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL WHERE YOU'LL 

116
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,928
HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WILL CONDUCT 

117
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,562
THIS TYPE OF AN ATTACK, 

118
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:18,631
INITIALLY, AND THEN EITHER KILL 

119
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,034
THEMSELVES OR TRY TO CONFRONT 

120
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,868
POLICE OFFICERS.

121
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,768
SO THIS INDIVIDUAL IS FLEEING 

122
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:23,836
FROM THE SCENE, BUT THAT SAID, 

123
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,206
IT WAS A RENTAL VAN, IT SOUNDS 

124
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,142
LIKE HE TRAVELED -- THE DRIVER 

125
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,077
TRAVELED QUITE A DISTANCE DOWN A

126
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:31,844
SIDEWALK STRIKING PEOPLE, BOTH 

127
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,780
IN THE STREET AND ON THE 

128
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,280
SIDEWALK.

129
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,116
AND THE FACT THAT THE DRIVER IS 

130
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,550
ALIVE AND CAN BE QUESTIONED BY 

131
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,087
POLICE AND THEY CAN EXAMINE HIS 

132
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,022
ELECTRONICS, HIS PHONE, HIS 

133
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,825
LAPTOP, ANY OTHER TYPE OF DEVICE

134
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,259
HE MIGHT HAVE BODES WELL THAT 

135
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,463

IN A WHITE VAN, WHO MOVED ON TO 

142
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,376
THE ROAD AND PLOWED THEM DOWN.

143
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,779
WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE
