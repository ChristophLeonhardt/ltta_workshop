00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,370
why does time move forward is one of

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,810
those questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sounds like a good</font>

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,910
question but then you're tempted to give

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,219
the answer did you expect it to move

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,799
backwards the real issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not why does</font>

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,780
time move forward but why is there a

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">full why is there a difference between</font>

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,340
one direction of time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you call</font>

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,140
toward the future in the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction</font>

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,869
we call toward the past time is a lot

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,119
like space as Einstein has taught us and

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,289
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there in space in your</font>

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,359
space suit there'd be no difference

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">between different directions of space up</font>

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,320
down left right forward backward but

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,120
there's an obvious difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it</font>

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes to time future versus past and the</font>

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,879
answer is the same reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why here in</font>

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,520
your room unlike up there in space there

20

<font color="#E5E5E5">is an arrow of space there's a</font>

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference between up and down that's</font>

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,860
because we live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vicinity of a</font>

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,260
very influential object the earth<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,420
is pointing us downward that is creating

a directionality to space the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,460
is true with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Khan the reason why there's</font>

a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> an arrow pointing from the</font>

28
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,600
