1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,467
ED HENRY, I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO

2
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:02,902
BE HEADED HOME TOMORROW.

3
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:03,703
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR

4
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:04,070
HARD WORK.

5
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,640
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING LONG

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,908
HOURS.

7
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,878
JOINING US NOW FROM WASHINGTON,

8
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:12,512
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN JIM

9
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,680
JORDAN, RON DeSANTIS ON THE

10
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,214
MAN WE QUOTED, MATT GAETZ.

11
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:17,684
CONGRESSMAN JORDAN, LET ME BEGIN

12
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,084
WITH YOU.

13
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,687
DO YOU KNOW, AS I'VE HEARD

14
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,322
DIRECTLY FROM PEOPLE, SARAH HAS

15
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,524
HEARD, CATHERINE HERRIDGE HAS

16
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,224
HEARD OTHERS AND GREGG JARRETT

17
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:27,760
THAT IN FACT WE HAVE ROD

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,629
ROSENSTEIN THREATENING,

19
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,298
INTIMIDATING TO USE THE POWER OF

20
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,335
THAT OFFICE TO GO AFTER PEOPLE

21
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,769
TRYING TO DO THEIR JOB.

22
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,071
>> I BELIEVE IT HAPPENED.

23
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,706
I TALK TO FOLKS WHO SAY IT

24
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,473
HAPPENED, WHO WERE THERE.

25
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,341
IF, IN FACT, THIS DID TAKE PLACE

26
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,478
WHICH I THINK IT DID, THIS IS

27
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,312
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THREATENING

28
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,547
STAFFERS OF A STANDING HOUSE

29
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,314
COMMITTEE TRYING TO DO THEIR JOB

30
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,882
AND GET ANSWERS FOR THE AMERICAN

31
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:50,283
PEOPLE.

32
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,218
THIS IS AS WRONG AS IT GETS.

33
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,286
THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IT

34
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,021
RAISES IS WILL THE SPEAKER OF

35
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,290
THE HOUSE STAND UP AND DEFEND

36
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,058
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

37
00:00:59,058 --> 00:00:59,692
STAFFERS?

38
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,760
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IN MY

39
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,495
JUDGMENT IS TO BRING UP THE

40
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,098
RESOLUTION THAT THE THREE OF US

41
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,399
INTRODUCED, MR. MEADOWS AND

42
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,267
OTHERS INTRODUCED COME EARLIER

43
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,067
TODAY ON THE HOUSE FLOOR.

44
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,003
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.

45
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,337
WHERE IS THE SPEAKER ON THAT?

46
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,573
HONORS BEEN RON DeSANTIS.

47
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,610
>> THIS CONDUCT IS DISQUALIFIED.

48
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,646
HE CANNOT BE THE DEPUTY

49
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,480
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

50
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,282
HE'S THREATENING PEOPLE WHO WORK

51
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,283
IN CONGRESS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE

52
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,084
ARE DOING OUR JOB TO TRY TO GET

53
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,320
ANSWERS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

54
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,621
THE ARROGANCE OF ROSENSTEIN, FOR

55
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,491
MONTHS AND MONTHS, TO STONEWALL

56
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,693
AND STONEWALL, NONSTOP.

57
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,295
EVEN BASIC ANSWERS TO REDACT

58
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,664
INFORMATION, IT'S GOT TO THE

59
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,898
BOILING POINT, WE IN

60
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:39,833
CONGRESS NEED TO ACT.

61
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,902
I THINK HIS POSITION THERE --

62
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,304
POSITION THERE IS UNTENABLE.

63
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,706
>> Sean: WHEN I AM HEARING,

64
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,974
CONGRESSMAN GAETZ, ONE OF THE

65
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,077
REASONS ROD ROSENSTEIN IS DOING

66
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,579
A LOT OF THIS IS BECAUSE THERE

67
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,182
ARE SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS WITH

68
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,684
SPECIFIC DAYS AND SPECIFIC DATES

69
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,918
THAT MAY IMPLICATE HIM.

70
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,320
HAVE YOU HEARD THE SAME THING?

71
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,956
>> WE HAVE, SEAN.

72
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,724
ROD ROSENSTEIN IS INTERACTIVELY

73
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,026
CONFLICTED IN THIS INVESTIGATION

74
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,595
CONFLICTED IN THIS INVESTIGATIO

75
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,027
INVESTIGATION.

76
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:09,696
AS BRAVE PATRIOTS LIKE KASH

77
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,864
PATEL WORK HARD FOR THE CONGRESS

78
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,699
TO EXPOSE THE CORRUPTION AND THE

79
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,300
BIAS, THEN THEY ARE THREATENED

80
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,302
BY ROD ROSENSTEIN?

81
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,103
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

82
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,472
KASH PATEL WAS IN MY OFFICE,

83
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,907
CONCERNED FOR THE FACT THAT HE

84
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,075
COME AS A STAFF MEMBER, WAS

85
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,910
DOING HIS JOB AND THEN SOME

86
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,411
HIDEOUT DIFFERENT BRANCH OF

87
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,045
GOVERNMENT BRINGING THESE

88
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,013
THREATS UPON HIM.

89
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,381
LOOK, I AM SICK AND TIRED OF ROD

90
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,283
ROSENSTEIN'S GAMES.

91
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,651
I THINK WE NEED TO IMPEACH

92
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,585
ROSENSTEIN.

93
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,088
HE WON'T TURN OVER DOCUMENTS.

94
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:35,989
HE SIGNED A FISA RENEWAL GIVES

95
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,990
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

96
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,757
UNITED STATES AND FRANKLY IF WE

97
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,892
DON'T STEP UP AND DEFEND OUR

98
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,260
INSTITUTION, THEN WHAT GOOD IS

99
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,563
THE CONGRESS ANYWAY?

100
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,797
>> Sean: OKAY.

101
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,300
AND HE HAS HIS TEMPER, WHICH

102
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,068
HAVE ALL OF YOU HEARD ABOUT IT?

103
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,036
CAN YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD?

104
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,072
I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT.

105
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,040
I THINK CHAIRMAN NUNES IS BEING

106
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,943
PRETTY NICE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I

107
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,745
JUST ASSUME HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO

108
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,479
ON THE RECORD.

109
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,680
BUT TO USE THAT POWER WE ARE

110
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,482
TALKING ABOUT HERE, HERE IS WHAT

111
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,917
I'M HEARING CONGRESSMAN JORDAN.

112
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,385
IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE THE

113
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,286
PRESIDENT DEMANDS THESE

114
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,954
DOCUMENTS OR CONGRESS HAS THE

115
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,889
OPTION OF IMPEACHING HIM.

116
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,990
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE SPEAKER

117
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,125
TO STEP UP HERE.

118
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,962
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN DO WE

119
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,097
GET THE DOCUMENTS AND HOW DOES

120
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,532
CONGRESS DO ITS JOB IF THEY ARE

121
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,533
BEING INTIMIDATED THAT THEY ARE

122
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,303
GOING TO BE THE SUBJECT OF

123
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,305
HARASSMENT AND INVESTIGATION AS

124
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,141
RETALIATION FOR CONGRESS DOING

125
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,042
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY?

126
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:29,676
>> SEAN, YOU ARE RIGHT.

127
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,044
THERE ARE CERTAIN TOOLS WE HAVE

128
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,711
IN THE TOOLBOX.

129
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,513
THEY SHOULD ALL BE AT OUR

130
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,881
DISPOSAL TO GET THE INFORMATION

131
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,649
WE CONSTITUTIONALLY ARE ENTITLED

132
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,317
GET TO GET ANSWERS FOR THE

133
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,518
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

134
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,519
IT'S REALLY THAT BASIC.

135
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,921
I THINK THERE ARE TWO

136
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:41,488
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS.

137
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,923
THE FIRST ONE IS, THE REPORT

138
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,491
COMES OUT TOMORROW FROM THE

139
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:44,991
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

140
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:45,825
IT WILL HAVE PEOPLE IN THERE

141
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,929
THAT WILL BE CITED FOR

142
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:49,329
WRONGDOING.

143
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,263
WE'LL ROD ROSENSTEIN FIRE PEOPLE

144
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,065
WHO ARE CITED IN THE

145
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,500
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT FOR

146
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,134
WRONGDOING IN THE CLINTON

147
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,168
INVESTIGATION?

148
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,136
THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

149
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,137
IS WHAT I HAVE RAISED BEFORE.

150
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,506
WILL THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE

151
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,943
STAND UP AND DEFEND PEOPLE ON

152
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:03,677
STANDING COMMITTEES THREATENED

153
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:04,544
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE?

154
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,146
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO

155
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,280
BRING UP THE RESOLUTION.

156
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,315
IF THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH THE

157
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,149
DOCUMENT REQUEST AND THE

158
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,485
RESOLUTION, THEN LOOK FOR

159
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,086
EXACTLY WHAT MATT GAETZ TALKED

160
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,920
ABOUT, CONTEMPT AND IMPEACHMENT

161
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,654
ARTICLES IN THE TOOLBOX WE HAVE

162
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,290
TO GO TO.

163
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,325
FINALLY, THERE IS WHAT DEVIN

164
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,993
NUNES SAID, THE PRESIDENT CAN

165
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:20,726
SAY RELEASE THE INFORMATION SO

166
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,896
THEY CAN GET ANSWERS.

167
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,332
>> Sean: LAST QUESTION.

168
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:25,766
EXIT QUESTION.

169
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,067
CONGRESSMAN DeSANTIS AND

170
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,168
GAETZ, WE WILL START WITH YOU.

171
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:28,735
CONGRESSMAN DeSANTIS.

172
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,505
WOULD IT BE WEAKER, BETTER FOR

173
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,272
THE COUNTRY THAT THE PRESIDENT,

174
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,676
THAT HE DEMAND THE DOCUMENTS

175
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,278
CONGRESS HAS BEEN OBSTRUCTED

176
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,080
FROM GETTING, SHOULD HE

177
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,414
DEMAND?

178
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,882
>> I THINK SO.

179
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,517
JIM JORDAN, MARK MEADOWS AND I

180
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,251
SENT HIM A LETTER COUPLE WEEKS

181
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,185
AGO URGING HIM TO DO THAT.

182
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,788
HE HAD THE POWER AND I THINK HE

183
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,688
SHOULD DO IT.

184
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,891
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE THE

185
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,324
TRUTH ON THIS.

186
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,759
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TREATED AS

187
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,294
POORLY AS ANYBODY BY SOME OF

188
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:54,895
THESE JOKERS.

189
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,263
HE SHOULD DEFINITELY PULL THE

190
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,698
