PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our g7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that US tariffs were kind of insulting he will not be pushed around very dishonest a week our tariffs are in response to his of two hundred and seventy percent on dairy I believe that actually I believe that Trudeau was obsequious in person and only pushback bravely after Trump was gone I believe that there's only brave after the fact I believe it I mean this weird New York Times piece today shows how terrified Trump is of Trudeau is of Trump he literally practiced practiced hand shaking yet like a handshake trainer or some things before meeting Trump so so Trump is busy studying tough policy files trade files peace with North Korea files and Trudeau is practicing how to shake hands and then bragging about that to the New York Times I guess if you think that's bad look at our foreign minister listen to Christie real and talk about how she likes to really negotiate trade deals the European trade commissioner Cecilia malmstr√∂m and I call each other sisters in trade we sign our emails hugs yes we did well we sometimes send each other smiley faces in particularly difficult moments so yeah hugs I don't know if Trump is a hugger not sure if we've got the right people on the job here do you but again the goal was just do no harm just get through the weekend Trump's gonna forget about all of us when he goes to North Korea but Justin Trudeau couldn't help it it's now like it or not fair or not overreaction or not Donald Trump says he's coming for us and he's coming for the thing he actually cares about our auto industry and he's particularly focused on our dairy industry as the excuse he says it has a two hundred and seventy percent protective tariffs including new terrorists brought in by Justin Trudeau just two years ago bizarrely just as Trump was coming to power sure I thought that would be a good time to bring in more tariffs on the states so reckless but remember back to that first video I showed you this one justin has agreed to cut all tariffs all trade barriers between Canada and the United States why not just say right there yeah yes please thank you how on earth is a total free trade agreement no barriers not the dream outcome for Canada we're right next to the enormous US market we speak English like they do they are just across the bridge or the highway we are friends how on earth could we not make out like bandits here in fact those Quebec dairy farmers how could they not win with the massive US market for their fancy cheese well Trudeau refused he refused for weird reasons you heard Trump he wanted a Canada us deal get Mexico in their own deal no Mexico involved Trudeau refused that way were you vertically white knighting for the Mexicans Trump wanted a five-year deal to be renegotiated reviewed after five years Trudeau refused why the current deal has a six-month cancellation provision how is a five-year deal worse than one that can be cancelled in six months notice which by the way Trump is already formally given why are we nitpicking with this guy who just offered us free access to the world's most important markets why don't we say you know you're joking but we're in if you're in why didn't we do that that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on youtube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
