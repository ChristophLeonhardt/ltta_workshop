00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,530
never to write a poem up yes it's not

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:24,779
easy I thought you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wind beneath</font>

4
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,529
my wings but you're more like a bird

5
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,540
that was caught in the turbines I

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,870
thought of these bloodlines would be a

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,140
safe place to hide from the rain<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,660
like to play Jenga all this time I

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,950
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was growing that you were</font>

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,600
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling me apart I knew from the</font>

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,460
start that our towel is<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">pull the mesh I didn't realize it was</font>

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,370
gonna fall on<font color="#CCCCCC"> geek so I do what a man</font>

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,920
would do and I sat on the couch<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,600
played xbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my underwear I thought</font>

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you were the wind beneath my wings</font>

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,850
but you all have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cloud but my head</font>

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,920
was stuck in I knew that you will fall I

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,780
just didn't realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,960
big

21
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,120
it's all I like it's just that if you

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,440
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on I'm going to try to ignite</font>

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,510
this but like a likeness I've read this

24
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,520
you told but I Dinah recite you it's not

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I like your sister my family is</font>

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,420
having this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm kind of like</font>

27
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,790
to invite you I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

28
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,390
wind beneath my wings<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

29
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,810
turbulence and the seatbelt light went

30
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,940
up and some of the luggage fell out and

31
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,550
then you spilled your drink on my

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,150
but that's just what I get for wearing

33
00:02:01,150 --> 00:00:00,000
