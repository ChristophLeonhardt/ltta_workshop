Pete hagseth apparently is one of Donald Trump's favorite anchors he's on Fox and Friends often and now we can see why because just when you thought Fox couldn't get any worse and does anybody really think that just tune in on any given day they'll get worse Hector thinks innocent lives lost children yeah wait you think I'm exaggerating hold watch the video fifty than being members of Hamas we should separate out there could be some innocent Palestinians including children who were killed because some eyes they want them to go to the front of a located but there are some innocent people who died poor crossfire whatever it is children let's just yeah wow man innocent children who die yeah yeah he literally said that you just saw with your own eyes such a bad guy they really are in case you're wondering about what the facts are uh II D Henry there is saying hey come on we should actually care about innocent civilians so a little bit of credit there too ed Henry but that's a perfectly normal thing to say I mean we're happening um credit to people on Fox News for sayin murdering innocent children maybe not a good thing while other anchors disagree with them now in reality Fox News paints this is completely oh it's all the Palestinians fault and the poor Israelis they were just forced to kill those 60 innocent people and by the way if you're wondering if they actually are innocent or not we did long coverage for you guys we showed you the guys that are throwing the rocks and the burning tires we also gave you a first-hand reports from media outlets like the New York Times Doctors Without Borders who were there doing Human Rights and the United Nations all saying most of the people that were killed were unarmed civilians and there were hundreds of yards away from the fence had no chance of hitting that Israeli soldiers at all and it took the plastic bullets couldn't even reach them it took snipers to reach and kill those protesters now you're not gonna hear that on Fox News cuz they're busy blaming the Palestinians that's a really serious issue and we're gonna go back to that because he's gonna say even well you can't say worse things than that but you can't say equally reprehensible things in a second but we should surprised that Pete hexif does not care about innocent human lives given that this was another Fox News segment they had done earlier watch Pete and Clayton are facing off they're testing their skills with the axe who's gonna win this booth there was an axe in the middle of Manhattan if you're wondering if there was someone behind that target unfortunately the answer is yes watch a monstrously immoral and monstrously stupid luckily the blade of the axe didn't hit that guy he was hurt but he recovered he's okay now did no one on your gigantic staff think maybe we should throw an axe in case you miss in the middle of Manhattan and especially with guys behind the targets when asked to respond hexxus said yeah so now let's get back to serious stuff here he is more on israeli-palestinian situation Hamas but Aris what yes and die for us but there were two human being as a human being regardless of what the responsibilities the Harris is to blame there the innocent blood is on the hands of the terrorists who put the kid out to charge offense with no prospects right less you can see Pete as irate about this no people get fired up about it it's a total miss lot a lot of so he also blamed the guy God who got hit with a axe say it's his fault that he was standing in the way of my axe right it's almost that comical that proposition that I had to use snipers to kill people according to the UN 700 eaters away at seven football fields away because I they made me do it they made me do it the sniper in his scope saw a kid seven football fields away and said he made me do it he made me shoot him and kill him okay he's not done yet watch it's just we use vague words like Palestinians and innocence and it's like men and Hamas was to wipe Israel off them wait what is vague about the word Palestinian or the word innocent they were unarmed according to the by standards who were there okay the majority of the people who were shot and killed let alone the hundreds and according to its sources thousands who were injured the great majority of them were unarmed and hit by sniper fire but it's their fault for getting hit by sniper fire come Israeli Defense Forces according to pete hexif not me are so stupid that they would fall for the Hamas trap oh this is gonna help him us alright let's just kill the kids anyway oh maybe we shouldn't kill the kids Hamas made us do it right okay then let's talk about his thing about Hamas wants to wipe Israel off the map the Palestinian state is literally not on the map as Palestine because Israel will not allow it the occupation has gone on for how many decades now and then ironically the main talking point they use is they want to wipe us off the map what you have wiped them off the map you literally will not allow the Palestinian state and you have it under armed occupation and if anyone gets within seven football fields of a of a fence you shoot and kill them but somehow they're the ones killing civilians no no you literally killed civilians you literally will not allow them on the map you literally deny their existence and turn around go home I can't believe how they deny my exists well the United Nations and every other country recognizes Israel it exists it's right there and by the way for any of the Palestinians to say that Oh Israel shouldn't exist what a preposterous pipe dream it does exist and they're saving that for negotiations and it's a silly a negotiation ploy get past it already both sides should exist but there's only one side that is not only blocking the other side from existing but will kill anyone that dares to defy that but what does Fox and peat hexif say oh the civilians who wanted their freedom and were murdered
