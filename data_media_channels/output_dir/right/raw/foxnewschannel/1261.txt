1
00:00:01,226 --> 00:00:02,327
SORT OF A STRAIGHTFORWARD

2
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:03,495
APPROACH TO TELL THE PRESIDENT.

3
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:04,930
WE WANT SOMETHING DONE.

4
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,932
NO PROMISES, NO THINGS RULED IN

5
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:07,799
OR OUT.

6
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,868
HISTORIAN, EVAN THOMAS ON THE

7
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:11,403
SIGNIFICANCE THE LETTERS,

8
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:12,004
PERIOD.

9
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:15,040
EVAN, WE KNOW FROM THE PAST THAT

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,076
EVEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE, THE

11
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:19,678
WRITTEN WORD AND ACKNOWLEDGING

12
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:21,713
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

13
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:22,681
PEN-TO-PAPER MAKES A BIG

14
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,081
DIFFERENCE.

15
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:25,851
WE CAN GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO

16
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:29,021
J.F.K. AND HIS MEETINGS WITH

17
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:31,123
KHRUSHCHEV.

18
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:31,857
ENLIGHTEN ME.

19
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,425
>> IT'S PERSONAL.

20
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,594
DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS,

21
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:37,996
THE WORST CRISIS EVER, THE HEAD

22
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,498
OF RUSSIAN, KHRUSHCHEV WROTE A

23
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,400
PARTIAL LETTER TO KENNEDY

24
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,835
SAYING, HEY, WE CANNOT HAVE

25
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,771
WORLD WAR III HERE.

26
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:48,240
THE BUREAUCRATS WROTE ANOTHER

27
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,808
TOUGH LETTER AND KENNEDY CHOSE

28
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:52,678
TO ANSWER THE FIRST LETTER, THE

29
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,047
PERSONAL LETTER FROM KHRUSHCHEV.

30
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,349
THAT HELPED SAVE THE WORLD.

31
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,950
PERSONAL DIPLOMACY THROUGH A

32
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,753
LETTER HELPED SAVE OUR LIVES.

33
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:02,554
>> Neil: YEAH.

34
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:07,793
CHOOSING THE LETTER THAT THEY

35
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:12,731
DID PAVED THE WAY FOR

36
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:14,666
DEESCALATION.AND I REMEMBER

37
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:18,070
RONALD REAGAN AND GORBACHEV.

38
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,538
RONALD REAGAN WAS A FAN OF

39
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,506
WRITING A LETTER, CONVEYING HIS

40
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:23,442
THOUGHTS ON PAPER.

41
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:26,578
THAT APPROACH IS SOMETHING THAT

42
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:29,181
HE VALUED AND IT WAS

43
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:29,715
RECIPROCATED.

44
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,083
>> HE WAS.

45
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,185
REAGAN AND GORBACHEV MET IN

46
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:33,518
ICELAND.

47
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:35,187
GOT TO THE POINT IN THE PERSONAL

48
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:36,221
CONVERSATION WHERE THEY TALKED

49
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,390
ABOUT ELIMINATING NUCLEAR

50
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,191
WEAPONS ALTOGETHER.

51
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:39,791
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

52
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,761
YOU CAN SHEA THEY WENT TOO FAR.

53
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,229
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP

54
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,399
TOWARDS ENDING THE COLD WAR.

55
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,903
PERSONAL DIPLOMACY MAKES A

56
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,304
DIFFERENCE.

57
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:54,473
IT RATTLED DIPLOMATS.

58
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:55,907
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING WILL GET

59
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,541
OUT OF CONTROL.

60
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,243
IT'S SCARY TO HAVE THE

61
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,412
PRINCIPLES MEET.

62
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,280
SCARY TO SUBORDINATES.

63
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,283
WE KNOW IT CAN MAKE A

64
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:05,684
DIFFERENCE.

65
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:07,786
>> Neil: IT'S A RITUAL WHERE ONE

66
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:09,086
PRESIDENT HANDING OFF THE BATON

67
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,523
TO THE OTHER, WRITES A LETTER

68
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:15,694
AND LEAVE IT'S IT IN THE OVAL

69
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:17,996
OFFICE DESK FOR HIS SUCCESSOR TO

70
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:18,296
READ.

71
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:19,698
IT'S VERY POWERFUL.

72
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:21,500
DOESN'T GUARANTEE PEACE, HARMONY

73
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,434
AND LOVE BETWEEN THE TWO.

74
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,671
BUT IT IS A PROCESS THAT WE

75
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:26,855
HONOR

76
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,372
HONO

77
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:27,672
HONOR.

78
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,140
WHY IS THAT?

79
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,341
>> I THINK ESPECIALLY IN THE AGE

80
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,910
OF THE INTERNET, THE PERSONAL

81
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,844
LETTER IS MORE PERSONAL.

82
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:34,045
>> Neil: ABSOLUTELY.

83
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:37,215
>> THE LETTER I'M THINKING

84
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,619
ABOUT, L.B.J. LEFT BEHIND THE

85
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,154
BODY COUNTS IN VIETNAM.

86
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:45,157
HIS PERSONAL REACTION TO THE MEN

87
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:45,924
DYING.

88
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:48,393
RICHARD NIXON SAW THOSE.

89
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:53,799
IT HAD AN IMPACT ON NIXON.

90
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,568
THE PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS.

91
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,537
OTHER AUTHORS HAVE SAID THERE'S

92
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,005
A PRESIDENT'S CLUB WHERE THEY

93
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:01,606
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, BY

94
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:03,308
LETTER, SOMETIMES IN PERSON AND

95
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,643
IT'S A BOND THAT IS IMPORTANT.

96
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,378
IT'S LONELY BEING THE LEADER OF

97
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,446
THE FREE WORLD OR BEING A

98
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:08,780
LEADER.

99
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,981
YOU NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY

100
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,283
PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND YOU, BEEN

101
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:14,386
IN YOUR SHOES, BEEN THERE

102
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:14,719
BEFORE.

103
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,222
THAT IS WHY THESE COMMUNICATIONS

104
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,225
BETWEEN PRESIDENTS ARE

105
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:23,829
IMPORTANT, EVEN DIFFERENT

106
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,131
PARTIES.

107
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:27,432
IT'S JUST CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

108
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:29,568
THAT THE CONNECTIONS CAN BE MADE

109
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:32,737
BY LETTER, FACE-TO-FACE.

110
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:33,405
THEY'RE IMPORTANT.

111
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:34,773
>> Neil: THE LETTER THING IS

112
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:35,273
IMPORTANT.

113
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:38,577
WE LIVE TO YOUR VERY ASTUTE

114
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:39,010
OBSERVATION.

115
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,446
RUSHED TEXTS AND TWEETS AND

116
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:44,616
QUICK EXCHANGES ON THE PHONE.

117
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:45,984
A LETTER IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

118
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:48,253
SIT DOWN, YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

119
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:49,921
TYPE IT OR WRITE IT.

120
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:52,357
IN ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S DAYS, HE

121
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:52,858
WROTE THEM.

122
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,426
HE QUESTION QUITE A FEW PEOPLE.

123
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:59,064
NOT ON GENERALS WITH WHOM HE WAS

124
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:01,366
DISPLEASED, BUT WAR WIDOWS AND

125
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,300
MANY, MANY MORE.

126
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,270
AND THEY CARRIED LASTING IMPACT,

127
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,305
DIDN'T THEY?

128
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:08,006
>> SURE.

129
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:11,576
I MEAN, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

130
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:15,513
THE INTERNET IS THAT WE RAP OUT

131
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:16,947
THESE QUICK MESSAGES.

132
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:18,483
WRITING A LETTER LONG, MAKES YOU

133
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:19,017
THINK.

134
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:21,119
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

135
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,555
THOUGHT IS TOO OFTEN MISSING IN

136
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,157
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ANY OF US

137
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:31,329
IN THIS MODERN AGE.

138
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:33,865
WE WHIP STUFF OFF.

139
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:37,068
WRITING A LETTER HAS A HEALTHY

140
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,370
DELIBERATENESS OF IT.

141
00:04:38,370 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE TO STOP AND THINK,
