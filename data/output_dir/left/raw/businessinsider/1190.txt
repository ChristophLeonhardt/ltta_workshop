electoral system against our democracy

apparently because he has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal</font>

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,750
beef against me and why is that in the

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,260
fall 2011 they had quote parliamentary

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,080
elections which were so fought so a

though he had a parliamentary victory

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,340
and so I issued a statement that's what

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,649
secretaries of state<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do and I</font>

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,700
basically said based on independent

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,360
no mistake as the press is finally

00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,340
catching up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> facts which we</font>

18

desperately try to present to them

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,260
during the last months of the campaign

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,830
this is not just an attack against me

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,600
and my campaign although that

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,869
you added fuel to it this is an attack

23
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,979
against our country

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,190
I think there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no doubt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that when any</font>

00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,910
