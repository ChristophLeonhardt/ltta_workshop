Barack Obama spent an outsized portion of his presidency lecturing Americans about illegal immigration unilaterally suspended prosecutions of a wide swath of illegal immigrants through his executive amnesty meanwhile railing all about the evils of the Republicans he ripped Donald Trump's supposed xenophobia over from strict anti-illegal immigration proposals but Obama and Democrats don't actually care about illegal immigrants in fact they would actually prefer that illegal immigrants retain that status so they can be used as a political sword against Republicans the fact is on full display this morning after a senior policy adviser to Obama said Obama would not confer a blanket pardon on illegal immigrants Cecilia mu√±oz who's a domestic policy adviser she said quote I know that people are hoping for use of a pardon Authority as a way to protect people it's ultimately not for a couple of reasons one is the general pardon Authority is generally designed for criminal violations not civil but it also doesn't confer legal status only Congress can do that and so ultimately it wouldn't protect a single soul from deportation so it's not an answer here for this population that by the way was also true of Obama's deferred action for childhood arrivals and deferred action for parents of Americans program its daca and DAPA they didn't grant citizenship or prevent future deportations they merely stopped deportations here and now pardoning illegal immigrants would remove the legal pretext for deportation other crimes such as fraud if you're using a social security number that's false that would still be prosecutable but it might not be punishable with deportation in fact Obama could pardon those crimes as well removing all legal grounds for prosecution now this isn't making the case Obama should pardon illegal immigrants of course it would be the essence of lawlessness a gross abuse of the executive power but Obama hasn't typically cared about any of that in the past including on illegal immigration and that's the point Obama doesn't want to protect the illegal immigrants in any real way without giving them full voting rights he wants them to be stuck in limbo so Democrats can claim they're victimized by evil Republicans that's why Democrats did not push comprehensive immigration reform when they controlled both houses of Congress from 2008 to 2010 stop with the routine in which Democrats are deeply concerned about illegal immigrants as anything but political tools they simply aren't I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show tons to get to today here on the bench Shapiro and we will get to it all we have the mailbag coming up a little bit later you have to subscribe subscribe to daily wire comm become a part of the mailbag but we have lots coming up in the mailbag plus another epic things I hate lots of things to hate lately which is just makes me happy I know but first we begin by saying hello to our advertisers over at hint commies hint water so if you think that water is kind of boring because it kind of is if you are constantly looking for something that peps up the taste of water without adding the calories hint is the best way to go about doing that we got bottles of hint water and they are really fantastic it's it doesn't add any calories that's all natural it's organic and it has just a taste of flavor and it's really great it's watermelon peach mango grapefruit and many more and it's in I'm telling you like I drink it my wife drinks it my children drink it and they love it it's it's it's very difficult to go back to regular water after you've had hints and that's not because it's all written with sugar or anything it isn't it's because it's really good it's really refreshing you can down a bottle of this stuff like nothing and right now if you go to drink hint calm slash Ben drink hint calm slash Ben then you get their normal pack which is 24 which is 24 bucks for only $15 so you get it basically 1/3 off $24 to $15 you get pineapple watermelon Crisp Apple and Blackberry my personal favorite is I really like the blackberry I think it's really good so hint water is really good stuff you're gonna want to check it out and it is beware it is addictive I mean once you once you start drinking it it's it's difficult to stop drinking hint water excellent stuff alrighty so we begin today with a continuation of a theme a little bit from yesterday and that of course is this the situation with with carriers so one of the things that I've been preaching I'm going to continue to preach here is that we need to call out Trump when he's wrong and we need to compliment him when he's right I know the my good friend Andrew Clavin doesn't feel the same way I know Clavin I had this conversation off air just before the program I was talking about this carrier deal which I'll explain in just a minute and why I think it's a problem and he was saying yeah but overall Trump is doing a good job I said I may very well agree that overall Trump is doing a pretty good job but that doesn't require to ignore when he does things that are bad see that argument the Trump overall is good that's an election argument that's an argument that he's gonna be better than Hillary for example but Hillary's no longer in the picture now your obligation as a citizen is to make sure the President does as many things as you can get him to do that you want him to do right your obligation is to hold him accountable and he does things that are wrong as my obligation as a citizen - it's not my obligation to sort of sign off and just say oh well now he's been elected he's popular that means that he can do whatever he wants and so long as he gives me more good than bad I'm just gonna shut up and sit here that's not my job it's actually a non sequitur okay if you have a friend and your friend embezzles from you and your wife comes to you and she says you know your friend just embezzled so yeah but overall he's a good friend that's a non-sequitur that doesn't deal with the main issue which is that he just embezzled from you you might want to address the embezzlement if you don't want future embezzlement I would prefer to stop Donald Trump from ruining his presidency with bad policy than I would to just compliment him when he thinks that he does things that are bad I think the carrier deal is bad and let me explain why I think the carrier deal is bad so the best way for me to explain why I think the carrier deal is bad is number one let me explain to you hey let me say it state the problem the problem is not just that the carrier deal is bad for people who missed it carrier is an air conditioning and heating manufacturer located in Indiana they were gonna shift a thousand jobs to Mexico and another not and they say they're not going to basically because the state of Indiana offered them some tax incentives and also because Donald from threaten them that's basically what it comes down to according to the New York Times or others from Politico Jean moots a former Indiana lieutenant governor who sits on an agency board in Indiana he told POLITICO carrier turned down a previous offer from that board before the election that offered all these tax incentives for carrier to stay in Indiana he said he thinks the choice is driven by concerns from carriers parent company United Technologies that it could lose a portion of its roughly 6.7 billion dollars in federal contracts so in other words what happened here is that it cost carrier something like 65 million dollars to keep these jobs in Indiana and so the question was why would four or five million dollars of tax incentives from Indiana keep those jobs there and the answer is they wouldn't right Pence offered this to carrier before that's crony capitalism in and of itself but he offered it to them before carrier turned it down now Trump selected and suddenly there vers themselves they didn't reverse themselves because of Trump's regulatory and tax policy that be a good thing right that would be great if carrier said listen now the business climate is awesome we're staying right here that would be great that would be good Trump but it's bad Trump if from goes to them and says I'm threatening you if you leave then I am going to take all of this taxpayer money I'm not gonna spend it with you I wouldn't spend even more taxpayer money with your competitor because here's the thing right these every Defense Department technology contract every Defense Department contract by law has to go through a bidding process and that bidding process requires you to show that you can provide the best product for the cheapest so that means that presumably as the if a wall is obeyed then the Defense Department contracts with United Technologies were the best contracts that were available that's the whole goal of having a bidding process now Trump is saying I know that was the best deal available and it's still the best deal available but screw that I'm gonna spend twice as much money on some other company just to punish United Technologies because I want my headline from them and I want my headline right now I want the headline that says that I saved a thousand jobs so I can go around the country bragging about how I saved a thousand jobs this is called economic fascism it is and that's not that's not linked in any way to to fascism with regard to race or fascism with regard to religion economic fascism is an actual economic philosophy it's called corporatism that believes that the federal government should pick winners and losers and it originated in in Italy with with Mussolini this notion that the government should should pick winners and losers that basically corporate a corporation and corporatism they all they share the same root and that root is Corp right Corbett's corpse right wait they're talking about body right the idea is that the entire economy is like a body and the federal government any government should decide which parts of the economy should be which parts of the body so you don't want you don't want three hands you want two hands and that means that the government is going to decide which two companies should be those two hands this is very dangerous stuff it's top-down government-run economics and that always results in less useful economic development it results in worse business deals it results in spending more taxpayer money and results in more regulation none of this is good stuff and just because Donald Trump got a good headline out of it doesn't make it a good thing and just because you think that he got a good headline out of it because we want to keep jobs in America and so he was doing the right thing to keep jobs in America now we're gonna flashback now we're gonna flashback okay here's the flashback the flashback is to 2009 here's Barack Obama in 2009 is February 2009 right after he's elected and you're gonna see Barack Obama do the exact same routine at caterpillar this is in Peoria Illinois looks a lot younger obviously this is in 2009 February 2009 and conservatives ripped him a new one over this as well they should have yesterday Jim the head of Caterpillar said that if Congress passes our plan this company will be able to rehire some of the folks who were just laid off and that's a story I'm confident will be repeated at companies across the country companies that are currently struggling to borrow money selling their products struggling to make payroll but could find themselves in a different position when we started implementing the plan rather than downsizing they may be able to start growing again rather than cutting jobs they may be able to create them again that's the goal at the heart of this plan to create jobs and not just any jobs not just make work jobs but putting people to work doing the work that America needs done repairing our infrastructure modernizing our schools and our hospitals promoting so that's Barack Obama circa February 2009 talking about how caterpillar had pledged the daring keep the jobs there now the CEO of Caterpillar came out very shortly after he said well no we never promised that we were gonna do anything like that but the headline was already out Obama had already claimed the caterpillar was going to save all these jobs because of his stimulus package right and conservatives rightly went nuts in 2013 and Obama's State of the Union address he named checked calor at caterpillar they said look at all the jobs that I personally have saved by using the federal government as this cramdown mechanism by threatening people and cajoling people and giving them special stimulus packages look at all the jobs that I've saved including in places like caterpillar our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs in manufacturing after shedding jobs for more than 10 years our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three caterpillar there's bringing jobs back from Japan Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico and this year we'll start making Macs in America again birthdays we can burman then he would go on to suggest that we use the Department of Defense you may notice similarity use the Department of Defense to create programs to fund all of these places to continue to keep jobs in America right it was bad when this happened because number one he wasn't telling the truth you don't create jobs in America by redistributing income from taxpayers to companies you don't create jobs in America by giving special tax incentives to companies that would be more productive elsewhere that's not how you create jobs the way that you create jobs in America is by removing taxes and removing regulations and not removing taxes for one company removing taxes for all companies otherwise you are just granting special favors to one company at the expense of a competitor carrier is not the only air conditioner and heating manufacturer in the United States and when you grant them a special tax incentives sure you might save the thousand jobs there but how about all the people who have to pay the extra money for the stimulus how about all the people who are competing with carrier who are gaining jobs because they're doing a better job than carrier and building up their own jobs base and now they're screwed because they have to cut workers because they can't compete with carrier which is getting a thumb on the scale from the federal government and nobody wants to look at the the unintended consequences of government intervention ISM because it's too easy to see that specific headline carrier saves thousand jobs in Indiana but how is the question not what happened how did it happen the essence of fascism lies in somebody saying I did it it happened it's happened the fight against fascism relies on you saying ok I need to know how and whether that was good fascism relies on people saying the sausage has been created here is the sausage the essence of republicanism SMO our republicanism the essence of democracy is you saying how did the sausage get made and was that legitimate right that is you being a good citizen and so it's not being a bad citizen to ask how this happened and whether it's a good thing it's not being anti-american to make sure that the methods that were used to do this we're good and not bad and by the way you have to extend the logic out Paul Krugman who is an idiot on economics except for some trade theory Paul Krugman when he when he looked at this this morning he says well Barack Obama created you know more jobs than this you'd have to do what what Trump did you'd have to do that every day for every week for the next 30 years in order to save the number of jobs that Obama save in the auto bailout and to a certain extent he's right if you believe that stimulus if you believe that special incentives if you believe special giveaways save jobs then why not just blow it up and that's actually Trump's plan you talked about one trillion dollar infrastructure plan which is just another boondoggle these infrastructure plans are boondoggles this is populism it's not conservatism it's not conservatism it has nothing to do with conservatism and in a little while I want to talk about a Steven Moore piece that is really egregious here but I just want to show you how far we've come here's Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter circa 2009 ripping on president obama saying he's going to keep American jobs in America by granting stimulus discovered what was actually in this bill yep they were rejecting it in droves yeah so what I don't understand with all the bad nominees and the tax cheats and closing down Gitmo and weakening our defenses Barack Obama and a little over two weeks was as Victor Davis Hanson said on the verge of an implosion why would the rock that help him bail him out here and that's why he went on TV and started claiming we were going to go in the Great Depression if we didn't pass this massive socialist bill I I am as once again awed by the wisdom of the American people and a week ago this bill had like 80 percent support as of today it's 37 percent support and I don't think anybody's read the whole bill it's twice the size of war and peace but people just find out more and more what is in this bill and support for it is collapsing so Obama got there so you got in saying rightly about the stimulus bill the more we find out about it the more we don't like it and now today we have people saying we don't need to know what Trump did what does it matter what was in this deal why does it matter does it really matter at all there's it and that's that sort of what stephen moore says today stephen moore has this amazing piece a national review stephen moore is an economist for the wall street journal very free market guy supposedly and and he had peace today at national review in which he said that the era of reagan is over
