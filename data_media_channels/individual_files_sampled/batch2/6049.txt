so whoa Nelly let me tell you about Texas so first of all voting has begun in Texas so we had a Texas candidate on in rebel headquarters just now and and she explained you can go into the polls 7:00 to 7:00 every night every day okay 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. you could also do mail-in ballots I think the election goes through March 6 that's the last day of voting and then and then we find out who wins so there's better o'rourke who's running in the on the Senate side for the Senate seat on the Democratic side and he is already a popular progressive Democratic congressman you know other folks say they're good progressives in that race too please do your own investigations find out more about it I've interviewed better or or couple hours he's not a just Democrat but before the Justice Democrats existed before the movement started to stop taking corporate cash better work just unilaterally said I'm not taking PAC money so that he deserves a world of credit for that okay and I think he's gonna be Ted Cruz so but he'll probably easily win the primary so that's that's the less interesting part for the primers in the general election better Aurora versus Ted Cruz is likely to be a super interesting race oh I hope I hope he beats the hell out of Ted oh and I got some polling to show you that there's a good chance he will okay so really yeah no matter the looking at the picture of him like sadly sitting there in front of his campaigning on Election Day think about that white thing on his little would be great I mean let us let us for the first time in twenty eight go whisper over to a jury imagine on on election night we announce we're announcing all across the country we get the Kansas congressman Brett welder has just defeated Kevin Yoder right well they're all right know it and then let us then we go to Texas if get to play that soundboard down goes Ted Cruz down goes Ted Cruz I mean I don't mean the way he did for Trump earlier okay and I the whole I'm gonna have that picture flashing of him phone banking for her trunk yeah right god damn that would be amazing and then he loses anyway right yes right he did that with Trump so he would make sure he got the base so he would win the neck and if he loses anyway and he's still humiliated himself like that oh that's what it's really fun yeah I wanted to base themselves on man you man what are you gonna do about it get back on the phone sir Trump go ahead okay so by the way better work out raised them all small dollar donations yeah he out raised is Cruz who's taking non-stop corporate PAC money with small dollar donations okay now let me show you the the really interesting primaries which are the on the Congressional side on the house side so let's go to graphic six here so these are the just Democrats in Texas as you could tell there's a lot of them there's seven of them okay derek wroe has been a fighter in progressive circles for a long time Lindsey Fagan was just at on rebel headquarters today she is worked in the tech industry for a long time all these guys have established from Democrats against them Darnell Jones has been on everybody go check out youtube.com slash qit politics to see these interviews Adrian bell etcetera Trevino all these great people so but Laura Moser is the one that's been getting a lot of attention lately why now the the story that we broke here on The Young Turks and that by the way thank you again to all the people who contributed to our reporters because they broke the story was the d-triple-c memo that was sent to all the candidates and it asked them to do weird things like donate the great majority of their money to media like to use most of their money in mainly television but media overall now why why can't I just run a grassroots campaign why can't if why can't I do whatever I want with my money it's my money in my campaign right and then they gave him a list of consultants and said you're only allowed to use these consultants why how would wait a minute what if there's a consultant in Texas was wonderful and knows the Texas or knows my district etc no no you must use these consultants who are friends and allies of ours and some of whom were married to and some of whom we worked for before and will work for later so that is that's a terrible I mean memo is corruption defined in a lot of ways okay then it in what seemed to be a more innocuous part of the memo although I think it's preposterous as they said now remember no infighting in the primaries first of all that makes no sense it's a primary well how are you like boxing max no punching okay so that was already weird and irrational right but then what did they do to Laura Moser in Texas the d-triple-c wrote an opposition memo about a Democrat in a primary they only wrote two opposition memos so far one is against the Republican and the other one was against Laura Moser and then they released it publicly oh my god what happened not fighting during the primaries they never meant it it was all a lie to try to get progressives to unilaterally disarm they were never gonna stop fighting they were gonna pour their corporate PAC money in they were gonna do every dirty trick in the book and then they took it out of context quote that Laura Moser said about a different part of Texas hundreds of miles away and they're like she hates Texas and she's disqualified herself from ever winning this race what if she was the primary then the Republicans are gonna use that quote from the Democratic Party against her yeah if a progressive did that to an establishment candidate he'd be like what kind of a monster does this your Hey right but when it comes to fighting progresses there's no unity there's no reciprocity all there is is vicious smears and then on top of that because they are so deeply corrupt they said oh she funneled some of the money to her brother as and they made it seem like her brother just took the money and went home with it no she showed that he spent all the money on the campaign right right meanwhile directing money to their wives and husbands that are part of the memo the consultants in the memo right and it's it so there are obviously political differences here but they also hated the fact that she didn't use the consultants that they wanted her to use right yes the same consultants that they that love to take that campaign money and they make millions of dollars off these campaigns so I love the fact that she didn't go with those consultants and I love the fact that she's still fighting and by the way just to give you a few more details that that whole thing about taking her out of context drove me crazy in addition to what happened with all the consultant stuff she made a statement about how she likes living in big cities as opposed to small town she was comparing Paris Texas where her grandparents were from to living to be in to living in big cities which she prefers that doesn't mean that she hates Texas it would be like me saying I prefer to live in Los Angeles as opposed to Bakersfield doesn't mean I hate California Texas has several massive cities yeah but I would say in most people's cars like I lived in Texas for more than five years lots of people live in the cities it's not like Oh rural Texas is the only Texas or anything like that like there's a huge Austin culture huge Dallas culture Houston is gigantic it's insane to say that that's like elitist to prefer the cities in Texas her district is it a giant city it's it's one of the largest cities in the country so anyway I don't like Paris taxes cuz it's it's French so now here's the good news part of that and by the way if you're watching this we're doing this live election coverage on receipt we'll do it on almost all the election nights the nice the first night Arizona district that's why we're all here always check out a lot on election night a Tuesday night's TYT Network comm /live but if you're watching this later on YouTube or Facebook we'll put all those candidates links down below okay so make sure you check out Laura Moser and all the other candidates in Texas and see if you could help them okay but which gets to me to my point forty within 48 hours of the d-triple-c attacking Laura Moser sure a sixty thousand dollars so people are like I'll screw you and your stupid consultants in your goddamn corruption I'm going for Laura Moser so it totally backfired now when she was adjust stomach rat all along progressive change campaign committees like that said we're endorsing okay and a couple other groups now our revolution or they're like no that's it thank you for pointing out the real progressive in the race we appreciate it okay you could actually now have some progressive cancer on the country like hey Trudy troubles EQ you target me they're so dumb man an atom grew from p triple c said about d-triple-c on the show on when we did that story on friday he's like not only is a stupid in attacking a fellow Democrat doing it so publicly brazenly ridiculously but it's also counterproductive how could you not see that that will help give her campaign energy what's wrong with these people and yeah and also in terms of like if you totally ignore the corruption angle of having this predetermined list of consultants that we want you to go with if you're if you're running here whatever it's not just in the state level it's not just corrupt it's also stupid because in Texas is a place where we expect that at some point they've been saying for five 10 15 years at some point this is gonna flip because of changing demographics and you know people's values are changing everything and yet it hasn't okay if we just keep going with the same people who have gotten close but haven't been able to actually seal the deal and flip it maybe that's a recipe to never actually flip it maybe if we mix things up and try experiments at the in different congressional districts don't go with the same ad people at every single place then maybe you can actually win some of those instead of going with a flawed strategy that has up until this point continued to lose yeah last two things about it one of the Democrats that they're backing against sir is a former goldman sachs yeah oh yeah of course now look just Texas you need banks you need banks you gotta build things yeah yeah I hear there are good banks in the world anyway so so I don't know which what I'm talking about there so so seriously though look some of the the progressive candy is running against other Democrats all those Democrats aren't terrible people and I don't know the guy from goldman sachs so maybe he's a good guy etc right but but we do know who is uncorrupted right and he is taking plenty of corporate PAC money and other Democratic establishment people in that race are and and so they've now targeted a couple of different Justice Democrats the d-triple-c as Democratic Party yes that's not a coincidence the reason they target them is because they won't take corporate PAC money so then the d-triple-c goes well if you're not gonna use our consultants so you don't take corporate PAC money how the hell we're gonna make money I meet all my friends in Washington gonna make money so you win you lose what do I care what do I get out of it also in the moser race keep in mind that the Goldman Sachs candidate that's running against her in the primary openly said to the media that he was approached by the d-triple-c and they convinced him to run I mean that should say someone yeah Laura's been running the whole time and they're like you know that's why we got to get her out not hey we're worried about losing right we got to get her out because that's a progressive and that could because guys remember if if Bernie and progressives and uncorrupted candidates win and you stop the money in politics too unfortunate a lot of Democrats in in Washington that's not good news that means that's the end of the gravy train whereas if Trump wins or bad guy Republicans win they send you annoying emails telling you oh you got a donate to us you got to donate to us the the boogeyman is out there yeah so they might even make more money that way
