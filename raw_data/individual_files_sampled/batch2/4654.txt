America great again how could you have voted through yes Roseann he talked about jobs Jackie he said he shake things up we almost lost our house the way things are gone have you looked at the news because now things are worse not on the real news our country had very little pride look back see what was happening our country had very little pride even look at Rosie and I called her yesterday look at her ratings look at her rating I got a call from Mark Burnett he did the apprentice he's a great guy he said Donal I call just to say hello and to tell you did you see Rosen's raid existed while camping were they they were unbelievable over 18 million people and it was about us they haven't figured it out the fake news hasn't quite figured it out yet they have not figured it out and they haven't figured it out but they will and when they do they'll become much less fake joining us now editor of commentary magazine contributing editor at The Weekly Standard and columnist at the New York Post John pa'dar 'its John writes in the post that the Roseanna revival is a wake-up call for Hollywood also with us author an NBC News political analyst Anand geared artists and the president and CEO of the Messina group a former deputy White House chief of staff and campaign manager for President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign Jim Messina good to have you all on board John Fodor it's let's read from your new column you write in part this the premiere episode of the revival of Roseanne featured a working-class grandmother saying grace before dinner and concluding with thanks for making America great again and the show got the highest ratings of any Network program in six years one might also point out that the first Roseanne episode on Tuesday was absolutely sensational but of course the people who watched in droves couldn't have known the episode was going to be good what America might have known about the new Roseanne before tuning in was that it was going to be the very rarest of birds at this cultural moment a Hollywood product that wasn't going to use Trump as a punchline or use Trump or use a Trump supporter as a comic punching bag that is for sure Joe so I think what's most interesting here is to look not only at the gross ratings but where the show did spectacularly well the three top cities I believe were Tulsa Oklahoma Cincinnati Ohio and Pittsburgh in New York and Los Angeles it did not crack according to the New York Times the top 20 so what we are seeing here is a program that went right at the Trump voter and got the Trump voter there's been a lot of talk that this show is a way of us reaching out to each other and talking and coming to Concord the way Roseanne and her sister Jackie do on that episode but I'm not sure that's the real story here the real story here is if you serve an underserved cultural population something that it might like there are riches to be reaped and we're told always that Hollywood responds to the bottom line and to the almighty dollar and we'll see whether this lesson is learned and whether the networks and the movie studios decide to try to play in to the Trump voter instead of trying to alienate the Trump voter well you know anybody may be a one-off is like Mel Gibson and when when he did his movie his Easter movie it did extraordinarily well movie studios didn't want to pick it up and he made so much more money than anyone could have expected in The Passion of the Christ then you know we look at those cities John it reminds me of what Johnny Carson the advice Johnny Carson all always gave the other late night talk show hosts he said you know went on the coasts you win in the central time zone it's certainly in this case that happened to bear out in the ratings you just showed right and you know Thomas Edsel had a piece yesterday in the New York Times about the exit polling in 2016 which according to him wildly under counted a new survey studying the exit polls there was a wild undercounting of the white working-class vote in the 2016 exit polls and what that tells me is in part that people are still working off of bad data about what kind of that the Constitution of the United States electorate and the American people are making possibly pretty bad decisions about what will speak to them based on bad data John isn't there this is a very quickly I'm sorry isn't this brother when the number one show is NCIS isn't a big part of this news is the demo that watches appointment television that means when it's actually on the air we're ratings count are the more red state lower income lower education and yes when you put that on broadcast television l-3 television those numbers are always going to be higher I don't see there's that much news here other than there was a good show and a good revival that hits the audience that actually still watches broadcast television we can't extrapolate broadcast television to what the entire magic million dollar million population does I mean I think that's true but remember NCIS which is a you know cop show and those CBS procedural shows they're not particularly political whereas it was clear in the run-up to Roseanne and this fight she had with Jimmy Kimmel on Jimmy Kimmel show about how he had gone to liberal and she had stayed where she was and all of that there was a real signal that this show was going to play directly into the themes of the 2016 election and rather than turning off people that seem to have excited a lot of people well and also Jim Messina it has a it's what my former chief of staff and I always said back in 1994 1995 we said could you imagine what would happen if a center-right news network actually went on the air they would own fifty percent of the population it has to do with market share right now there aren't a lot of people in Rosanne space the show's space certainly do you think that has a lot to do with the 18 million people that that watched well look I don't think that I think we're getting a little excited I agree with Donna here if you look at those cities we just put up on the screen one of the cities that showed it very well and is the blue place of Chicago I mean let's not get out of hand roseann hat is a revival she has her audience people were excited about that that doesn't mean that demographically worse in some perfectly narrow casted Republican message here Roseanne is who Roseanne is and you know we are in an age of micro casting and she did really well with her demographic that includes blue stays that includes places like Chicago but it doesn't mean that suddenly we are sitting here talking about you know political genius I also love how the president wants to take credit for bringing the audience to them I mean he's up there crowing about this anything it feels like Stuart smiley on Saturday Night Live he's gotta sit up there and be like I'm good enough people like me this is all about me I love that whole thing sitting in Ohio talking about jobs and instead bragging about Roseanne's ratings was bizarre well also obviously when we're talking about Roseanne we also have to talk on and about some of the beliefs that she's tweeted out over the past several years whether it was about Seth rich or whether it was about info war conspiracy theories there's no doubt she has gone to the extreme of the political spectrum yeah I'm not a fan of Roseanne the person I did enjoy you know that that one episode that may be the only one I'll watch but I but I enjoyed it and I think it raised a truth and a question I think the truth that it that it illustrates is working-class white people make claim to be against identity politics but they actually crave identity politics they want to be part of it they want to be seen and witnessed the way women and people of color are demanding representation and part of it was great about the show the the apnea machine Maxwell House coffee prescription meds insurance it doesn't work football stitch kitchen towels there was an effort to kind of pay respect and pay attention to the details of a certain demographics life I hope those folks will understand that other people also want to be represented and that's what those demands and identity politics have been about I think the question the revival raises is is it only kind of demagogues like Donald Trump and peddlers of conspiracy theories like Roseanne who can speak to these people can there be good elevated smart thoughtful future oriented political leaders who can speak to these people make them feel witnessed see understood but actually elevate them and lead them to a better place instead of make them hate people and try to shut down the post-war global order yeah I just I got to say I'm with my friends brother Messina and brother Deutsche to some extent brother Scarborough here on this and I just if you think about what lesson does this have for Hollywood or for the television industry the network audience for not just appointment television but for network television is a shrinking audience that's increasingly confined to a certain demographic if you're Hollywood and you think about who do i how do I reach America you don't think about Network primetime television you think about streaming services and and online and and the way that the the way you giant huge rising demographic of young people increasingly racially diverse and politically diverse which is all turning off network television and yet you can find 19 million people who want to watch Roseanne because she's super famous this is a super famous show and they make really good television so you're gonna find 90 million people that's great all for it I thought the episode was really good too and actually amazingly it had my father's couch in the middle of the rows dad's house there's a whole story in itself hablas part of the reason why I loved it but but i but I just don't think it pulled some great lesson for my god Hollywood now should start to cater to a shrinking part of the market in a shrinking demographic that watches television in that way but Jim Messina let's now just bring it let's let's shift away from popular culture and chip towards political culture yeah you are a man who knows a fair amount about data and we've discussed something on this show to this morning I have not had a satisfactory answer yet Washington's and chaos the White House is in chaos Republicans are in a panic everything seems to be going wrong and be a Paul Ryan hasn't even in it figure out he's gonna run for reelection yet he's so worried about the blue wave yeah and yet for some reason in the midst of all of this Donald Trump's approval rates are going up how is that because he has a very solid base that is unmovable the only thing he's a 1/1 play football team but it's going up no he's moving up from the dead like he said will this give him credit for this moment he we've seen him at 35 right he has had upward movement in a lot of polling in the last couple weeks I've just confused you in the chaos given stormy Daniels right give him all are given everything what explains the fact that he has had a market not huge but noticeable upward tick over the last couple weeks the economy you look at this it's all about the economy I'm looking at voters who voted for Donald Trump from Barack Obama we're studying them in the battleground states over the course the last two years we have a weekly conversation with them and they literally move on Donald Trump on how they view the economy doing so the ups and downs of the stock market doesn't matter to them they're doing okay so he's doing okay and as long as he's not pissing them off too badly with tweets and the other stuff they're okay with him and they're gonna sit there until they think he's not focusing on the economy that's what I heard that reflects in Mississippi among voters who had voted for Obama than they voted for Bernie Sanders and then they ended up voting for Donald Trump and while they weren't super enthusiastic about him they felt that the economy was doing well and they could tell a difference in their paychecks because of the tax cut and I mean this said I hear time and time again when I'm outside of Washington or New York I hear time and time again no I don't like him his tweets drive me absolutely crazy but you know what the regulatory relief that the businesses they've gotten I know people who now have a job because some of the regulations have been lifted the tax cuts have helped other people I've gotten more money in my paycheck that's what I hear time and time again people may not like Donald Trump but they feel like his policies are making them better off economically John here's here let's John let's let's end where we began and that is with you talking about how extraordinary this was and actually I've got to say 18 million people watching network television stop the presses like on top of the Drudge Report that's big okay so let's we have this variation about how you know the future of entertainment is streaming services and young people in a more diverse America and that may be true but you know real hit on a streaming service gets three million people to watch this is right you know almost you know 18 million it'll be 20 million by the time the week is out with you know with delayed ratings and all of that and the whole point here is that pooh-poohing the now in favor of a glorious demographically liberal future is all well and good and look where it got Hillary Clinton in 2016 with this idea that if she spoke to the new people she could avoid and ignore the older people and the current people and you know ABC itself claims that it undertook a study of American culture after the November 2016 election to see where it was under serving and that this show is a direct outgrowth of that effort so you can say that it doesn't mean anything the ABC thinks it means something and it's going to program into this world that it decided to examine well you know though I mean the problem is of course there was the new coalition that Hillary Clinton went after ignored the old coalition now though we have the the problem is now turn 280° you have donald trump that's looking at the old coalition and offending the new coalition neither approach is a winning strategy now many 20 but the democrats definitely they they they forgot about those 18 million people who watched roseanne for sure and it's a good lesson john Fedora's
