1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
It's hard to overestimate just how much
broadband changed the internet. Back when

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,980
you had to connect to the internet using
dial-up, information traveled slowly.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,070
Pages took forever to load and watching
this video would have been impossible.

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,000
Today's internet is a completely
different creature, which is why it's so

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,869
puzzling that the last time Congress
passed a major legislation for

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,730
regulating the internet, it was 1996. And
so the task of regulating the Internet

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,488
has fallen to five unelected bureaucrats:
the Federal Communications Commission.

8
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,380
As the tools we use to access the Internet
have changed, they've had to decide what

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,460
kinds of rules the companies that
provide those tools should have to

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,620
follow. And now under a new commissioner
appointed by President Trump the FCC has

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,910
altered those rules in a way that could
fundamentally change how we use the Internet.

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,379
Take a deep breath. This decision will

13
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,370
not break the Internet. This decision
puts the Federal Communications

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,920
Commission on the wrong side of history.
It creates a free-for-all, that we have

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,159
not had on the Internet in the past and
that's very very dangerous. It's gonna be f****d.

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,320
What we're seeing here is the cable-ization of the Internet. This is a dark

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,189
day for innovation, this is a dark day
for small business, it is a dark day for

18
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,509
consumers. First, let's define what most
people mean when they talk about Net

19
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,590
Neutrality. A good working consensus
model that most would agree with is the

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,490
idea that Internet Service Providers
should treat all traffic more or less

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,960
the same on their network. This means the
companies whose wires and towers we use

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,740
to access the Internet,
can't block or slow down data from

23
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,030
certain sites or apps. They can't make
special deals to move certain data along

24
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,259
faster than everybody else's. Internet
content providers like Facebook, Google,

25
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,670
and Netflix - they love Net Neutrality
because it means that even if some of

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,110
their products, like streaming this video
for example, take up a lot more bandwidth

27
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,299
than others like email, Internet Service
Providers can't charge them extra for

28
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,520
getting all that data to our phones and
computers. Which is exactly why ISPs like

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,720
Comcast Verizon and AT&T hate it.
If they could charge Netflix and YouTube

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,090
extra for those big packets of data, they
could make a lot of money and now that

31
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,970
the FCC has scrapped the net neutrality
rules they almost certainly will. ISPs

32
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,530
will also be able to charge customers
more to access sites or apps that take

33
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,750
up more bandwidth. And some argue this
will mean more choices for consumers.

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,660
My sense is this will be fantastic,
right because my daughter chews through

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,410
my Verizon data cap every month and all
she ever does is Instagram. So if I could

36
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,500
pay like 20 bucks and get her a phone
that I can text with her and talk with

37
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,760
her, but would allow her to use Instagram
and get her off my standard data plan

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,500
that would be great. But by privileging
established tools like Instagram, these

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,090
plans could make it a lot harder for new
ones to break through. It's a time when

40
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,250
more than ever we want to encourage and
keep open a playing field for new

41
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,720
services, new platforms, to be able to get
in the game and provide a real

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,240
alternative.
I mean imagine a world in which we were

43
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,290
all still stuck with MySpace. I don't
think, you know, that's what we want, but

44
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,600
Net Neutrality is part of why that's not
what we have. Until 2005 Internet Service

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,890
Providers were classified as common
carriers which meant the FCC could

46
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,700
regulate them like phone companies. In
the Internet's early days these

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,750
regulations kept phone companies from
charging customers extra for using

48
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,850
dial-up services like AOL and when phone
companies started offering DSL broadband

49
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,480
service over their lines, common carrier
rules force them to let their

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,460
competitors use those lines too. Which
meant consumers had tons of choices when

51
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,500
it came to picking an Internet Service
Provider.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,330
A 2003 page from the Washington Post
lists 18 different DSL options for the

53
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,140
Washington, D.C. region. Today,
residents have less than half as many

54
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:03,610
choices. So what happened? In 2005 the FCC
did the same thing it did in 2017. It

55
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,630
said ISPs weren't common carriers and it
stopped regulating them like phone

56
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,210
companies and without that regulation
ISPs became virtual monopolies. Today,

57
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,440
two-thirds of Americans live in areas
with just one choice for high-speed

58
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,420
Internet.
And if their ISPs start blocking,

59
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,520
slowing down, or charging more as a
result of this rule change, their options

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,970
are to put up with it or go without the
Internet. Despite the fact that

61
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,260
majorities of both Republican and
Democratic voters support Net Neutrality,

62
00:04:33,260 --> 00:00:00,000
it doesn't look like Congress or the FCC
will be bringing it back anytime soon.
