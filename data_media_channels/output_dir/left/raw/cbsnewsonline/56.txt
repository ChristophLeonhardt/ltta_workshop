1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,335
AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE GOING 

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,169
THROUGH THE PROCESS TO MAKE 

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,137
SURE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT AND 

4
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:06,906
JUST RIGHT. I 

5
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,508
WISH THE DEMOCRATS COULD HAVE 

6
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,343
DONE THIS A LOT SOONER BECAUSE 

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,911
THEY HAD THIS INFORMATION FOR 

8
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:12,278
MANY MONTHS. 

9
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,114
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE WAITED 

10
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,748
UNTIL LITERALLY THE LAST DAYS. 

11
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:17,183
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT A LOT 

12
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:17,417
SOONER. 

13
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,686
WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, WE 

14
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,953
WANT TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. 

15
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:25,558
ONE THING I WILL SAY, AS I 

16
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:26,793
UNDERSTAND IT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

17
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,628
SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WITH 

18
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,564
SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND IT WASN'T 

19
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:32,832
EVEN BROUGHT UP AT THAT MEETING 

20
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,166
AND SHE HAD THIS INFORMATION. 

21
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,768
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, 

22
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,003
CERTAINLY, SHE WOULD HAVE 

23
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,872
BROUGHT IT UP AT THE MEETING 

24
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,106
AND NOT WAIT UNTIL EVERYTHING 

25
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,374
IS FINISHED AND THEN START THE 

26
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,342
PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN. 

27
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,678
WITH ALL OF THIS BEING SAID, WE 

28
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,847
WANT TO GO THROUGH THE FULL 

29
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,114
PROCESS. 

30
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,249
I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE 

31
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,083
U.S. SENATE AND THEIR 

32
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,451
PROCEDURES AND WHAT THEY ARE 

33
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,852
DOING AND I THINK THAT IS 

34
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,121
PROBABLY WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO 

35
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,257
DO, GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TO 

36
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,291
HEAR EVERYBODY OUT. I 

37
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,959
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND I 

38
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,194
BELIEVE THEY THINK IT'S 

39
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:01,594
IMPORTANT. 

40
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,030
AGAIN, HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT 

41
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,166
INTELLECTS AND ONE OF THE 

42
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,468
FINEST PEOPLE ANYBODY HAS 

43
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:08,701
KNOWN. 

44
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,736
YOU LOOK AT HIS REFERENCES AND 

45
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,804
HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE 

46
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,104
LIKE IT. 

47
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,172
WE WILL GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS 

48
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:17,577
AND GET IT DONE. 

49
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,011
IT DEPENDS ON THE PROCESS BUT 

50
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:20,880
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THE PLEA 

51
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,116
PROCESS -- I LIKE EVERYBODY TO 

52
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,018
BE HAPPY AND I WANT THE 

53
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,152
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY 

54
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,987
BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING 

55
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,222
SOMEBODY THAT IS GREAT. I 

56
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,825
WANT HIM TO GO IN AT THE 

57
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,926
ABSOLUTE HIGHEST LEVEL AND TO 

58
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,227
DO THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH 

59
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:35,427
THIS. 

60
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:39,232
IF IT TAKES A DELAY, IT WILL 

61
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:39,966
TAKE A DELAY. 

62
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,201
IT SHOULDN'T, CERTAINLY, V -- 

63
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,335
BE VERY MUCH. 

64
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,604
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP 

65
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,037
LONG BEFORTHIS. 

66
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:46,839
THEY HAD THE INFORMATION IN 

67
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,709
JULY, AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND 

68
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,444
THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO AND 

69
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,612
NOBODY MENTIONED IT UNTIL THE 

70
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,113
OTHER DAY. 

71
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:54,914
IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE THEY 

72
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:55,715
DIDN'T MENTION IT SOONER. 

73
00:01:55,715 --> 00:02:00,653
WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, IT 

74
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,257
WILL, I'M SURE, WORK OUT VERY 

75
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:04,457
WELL. 

76
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,559
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AN 

77
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,861
INDIVIDUAL THAT IS AS HIGH 

78
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,696
QUALITY AND INDIVIDUAL AS YOU 

79
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,062
WILL EVER SEE.

81
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,465

THINK HE'S VERY MUCH ON TRACK. 

88
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,150
IF THEY DELAY A LITTLE BIT TO 

89
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,387
MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS HAPPY, 

90
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,757
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS WANT TO

BE 100% HAPPY, THEMSELVES. 

92
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:39,559
THEY ARE DOING IT VERY, VERY 

93
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,293
PROFESSIONALLY. 

94
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:44,464

ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIS SUPREME 

112
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:20,766
COURT NOMINEE, BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

113
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:26,739
WAS ACCUSED BY A WOMAN OF 

114
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,940
HAVING ATTACKED HER AT A HIGH 

115
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,314
SCHOOL PARTY 30 YEARS AGO. 

116
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,582
IT NOW APPEARS THAT PRESIDENT 

117
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,849
DONALD TRUMP IS OPEN TO 

118
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,282
DELAYING THE VOTE. 

119
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,284
HE MENTIONED THAT IF THEY DELAY 

120
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,822
IT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS 

121
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,024
HAPPY, -- BUT HE DIDN'T SEEM TO 

122
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
BE AGAINST THAT IDEA. 

123
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,926
HE CRITICIZED THE DEMOCRATS FOR 

124
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:51,130
NOT MENTIONING IT SOONER. 

125
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,098
CORRESPONDENT PAULA REID JOINS 

126
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,866
US NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. 

127
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,835
SHE WAS IN THE ROOM. 

128
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,703
PAULA, THAT WAS A REMARKABLE 

129
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:57,970
EXCHANGE. 

130
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,872
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE OPEN 

131
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,074
TO DELAYING THE VOTE. 

132
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,276
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT IN SO MANY 

133
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,577
WORDS, BUT HE DID SAY IF IT 

134
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,444
WILL MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY AND 

135
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:10,683
SORT OF PAUSED. 

136
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,519
AS A POSSIBLE THEY MAY DELAY 

137
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,655
THE VOTE OVER THIS? 

138
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,188
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 

139
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:17,957
YOU SAW THE PRESIDENT EMBRACING 

140
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,290
THE PROCESS. 

141
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,494
HE OFTEN TIMES CAN BE 

142
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,063
COMPETITIVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE 

143
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,565
IS PRESSED ON SOMETHING 

144
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,533
IMPORTANT TO HIS LEGACY AND 

145
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:27,900
ADMINISTRATION. 

146
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,702
HE WAS ELECTED TO APPOINT 

147
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,470
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND NOW 

148
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,637
YOU SEE ONE UNDER SIEGE. 

149
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,841
WHEN REPRESSED THE PRESIDENT ON 

150
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,844
WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD BE OPEN 

151
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,078
TO DELAYING THE VOTE FOR A 

152
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,980
PROCESS OR TESTIMONY, HE 

153
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,183
WOULDN'T SAY YES BUT SAID IT 

154
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:44,951
DEPENDS, LET'S SEE. 

155
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,019
HE SEEMED VERY OPEN TO THE IDEA 

156
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,488
BUT HE ALSO CRITICIZED 

157
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,821
DEMOCRATS AND SAID THEY SHOULD 

158
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,225
HAVE COME OUT A LONG TIME AGO. 

159
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,893
DEMOCRATS HAVE MET WITH 

160
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,928
KAVANAUGH AT CERTAIN POINTS AND 

161
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,663
NEVER BROUGHT THIS UP. 

162
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:58,897
HE SEEMED CLEARLY FRUSTRATED 

163
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,933
BUT ONCE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 

164
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,667
BE HAPPY. 

165
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,703
HE SAID, QUOTE, IF IT TAKES A 

166
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,137
LITTLE DELAY, THEN IT TAKES A 

167
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,105
LITTLE DELAY. 

168
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,175
AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T KNOW IF 

169
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,209
THE CONFIRMATION VOTE WILL BE 

170
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,411
POSTPONED OR WHAT PROCESS THERE 

171
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:11,677
WILL BE. 

172
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:12,979
IT WAS INCREDIBLY SURPRISING 

173
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,249
FOR MANY OF US IN THE ROOM THAT 

174
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,752
THE PRESIDENT WAS SO OPEN TO 

175
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,453
THIS PROCESS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT 

176
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,120
SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT TO HIM 

177
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,688
AND HIS VOTERS. 

178
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,390
>> I AGREE. 

179
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,057
HE DID CRITICIZE THE DEMOCRATS, 

180
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,426
HE SAID, FOR NOT BRINGING THIS 

181
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,895
UP SOONER. 

182
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,297
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, THE 

183
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,833
ALLEGATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN KNOWN 

184
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,804
BUT THE ACCUSER DID NOT COME 

185
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,638
FORWARD PUBLICLY UNTIL VERY 

186
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:38,938
RECENTLY? 

187
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,872
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. 

188
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,507
SHE CAME FORWARD PUBLICLY VERY 

189
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,942
RECENTLY BUT IN THE LONG 

190
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:43,976
TIMELINE OF THE HEARINGS, HE 

191
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:44,844
SAID WE KNEW ABOUT THIS IN 

192
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:50,450
JULY, WHY IS THIS COMING OUT 

193
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,750
RIGHT NOW? 

194
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,619
HE DIDN'T DIG IN DEEPLY TO 

195
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,555
PARTISAN ATTACKS, HE SAID TO 

196
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,156
LET IT PLAY OUT. 

197
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,890
HE SEEMED VERY SUBDUED. 

198
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,359
HE HAD A BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE 

199
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,861
AND WAS SMILING AND CHATTING 

200
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,762
AND VERY CALM. 

201
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,498
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, HE 

202
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,434
TOLD ME HAD NOT SPOKEN WITH 

203
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,001
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TODAY BUT 

204
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:09,668
REITERATED HIS CREDENTIALS AND 

205
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:11,137
SAID HE WAS, QUOTE, ONE OF THE 

206
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,040
GREAT INTELLECTS AND SAID HE 

207
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,841
WAS ABSOLUTELY DAZZLED BY HIS 

208
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,241
RECOMMENDATIONS. 

209
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,778
IT APPEARS SOME OF THIS MAY 

210
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,479
COME FROM A PLACE OF CONFIDENCE 

211
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,348
THAT IF YOU ALLOW THE PROCESS 

212
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,484
TO PLAY OUT, ULTIMATELY, HE 

213
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,751
WILL GET THE JUSTICE CONFIRMED. 

214
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,521
>> HE SAID HE WAS ONE OF THE 

215
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,589
FINEST PEOPLE HE HAD EVER KNOWN 

216
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,289
AND DID DEFEND HIM. 

217
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:36,028
PAULA REID, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

218
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,530
>>> FOR MORE, I WANT TO BRING 

219
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,297
IN LEGAL ANALYST, RIKKI 

220
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:38,564
KLEIMAN. 

221
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:43,603
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. 

222
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,237
BEFORE WE GET TO MANAFORT, 

223
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,439
LET'S DISCUSS THE KAVANAUGH 

224
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:46,739
SITUATION. 

225
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,107
IT HINGES ON EVENTS THAT HAPPEN 

226
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,175
30 YEARS AGO. 

227
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,411
AT THIS POINT, IS IT ONE 

228
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,846
PERSON'S WORD AGAINST ANOTHER? 

229
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:55,681
>> IN ESSENCE, IT IS ONE 

230
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,782
PERSON'S WORD AGAINST TWO, 

231
00:06:56,782 --> 00:07:00,219
ULTIMATELY. 

232
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,655
WE HAVE THE FEMALE WHO IS 

233
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,389
SAYING THAT TWO MALES WERE 

234
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,357
INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT AND OF 

235
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,424
COURSE, THE SUPREME COURT 

236
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:13,199
NOMINEE, BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 

237
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:13,566
ALSO MR. JUDGE. 

238
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,534
NOW, MR. JUDGE, ACCORDING TO 

239
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:20,606
THE FEMALE, IT WAS THAT MR. 

240
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,143
JUDGE JUMPED ON THE PILE AND AS 

241
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,613
A RESULT, THE PILE OF THE THREE 

242
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,781
OF THEM FELL APART. 

243
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,949
SHE WAS NOT ULTIMATELY SEXUALLY 

244
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,251
ASSAULTED OR RAPED AT THAT 

245
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,219
POINT IN TIME. 

246
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,055
THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT 

247
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,725
LESSENS HER FEAR AS EXPRESSED BY

248
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:39,925
HER. 

249
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:40,760
DOES IT BECOME ONE PERSON'S 

250
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,394
WORD AGAINST TWO, AGAINST ONE? 

251
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:47,667
SHE TOOK A POLYGRAPH FROM A 

252
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,601
FORMER FBI CALLIGRAPHER. 

253
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,570
DOES THAT MEAN WE NOW HAVE TO 

254
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,804
SPREAD THE POLYGRAPHS AROUND? 

255
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,205
WHERE DOES IT STOP? 

256
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,975
>> HOW CHALLENGING IS IT FOR 

257
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,909
THESE CASES THAT GO BACK 

258
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,910
DECADES TO GATHER EVIDENCE? 

259
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,480
>> ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. 

260
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,213
UNLESS YOU HAVE REAL 

261
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,381
CORROBORATION, AND LET'S LOOK AT

262
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:12,024
THE MOST NEWSWORTHY -- IT HAS 

263
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,460
TO DO WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. 

264
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,594
AND, THE PREDATORY PRIESTS. 

265
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,897
WHAT HAD HAPPENED, WHICH WAS 

266
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,500
ASTOUNDING IN THOSE CASES, AT 

267
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
LEAST THOSE IN PENNSYLVANIA, 

268
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,435
WAS THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY 

269
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:22,702
RECORDS. 

270
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,836
THERE WAS RECORD KEEPING OF 

271
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:29,008
MOVING THE PRIESTS FROM PARISH 

272
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,709
TO PARISH. 

273
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,343
THEY WERE DETAILED RECORDS. 

274
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,212
ORDINARILY, IF YOU ARE LOOKING 

275
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,315
AT AN INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE 

276
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:36,948
THREE YEARS AGO, IT'S HARD 

277
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:37,182
ENOUGH. 

278
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:37,783
LET ALONE, 30 YEARS AGO. 

279
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,019
THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM 

280
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,658
WERE THE TWO MEN AND WOMAN, 

281
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,060
ACCORDING TO THE WOMAN. 

282
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,161
>> SO TOUGH. 

283
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,163
WHAT ABOUT THE CURRENT CLIMATE? 

284
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,932
YOU KNOW THE ACCUSATIONS THAT 

285
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:53,666
ANITA HIL MADE AGAINST 

286
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,000
CLARENCE THOMAS DID NOT PREVENT 

287
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,303
HIM FROM BECOMING A SUPREME 

288
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:57,703
COURT JUSTICE. 

289
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,106
DO WE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT TIME, 

290
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:00,740
NOW? 

291
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,907
YOU KNOW, THE #METOO MOVEMENT? 

292
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:02,942
WILL THIS COLOR THE WAY THIS 

293
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:03,576
WOMAN'S ACCUSATIONS ARE TREATED 

294
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,712
AS OPPOSED TO THE WAY ANITA 

295
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,212
HILL'S ACCUSATIONS WERE 

296
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:07,479
TREATED? 

297
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:12,818
>> I WOULD ASSUME SO. 

298
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,453
FOR THOSE OF US AT A CERTAIN 

299
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,087
AGE, WE REMEMBER PRECISELY 

300
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,322
WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE WATCHED 

301
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:22,028
THOSE HEARINGS INVOLVING ANITA 

302
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:22,929
HILL AND HER ACCUSATIONS 

303
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,462
AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS. 

304
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:23,930
THEY WERE RIVETING. 

305
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,864
THE COUNTRY WAS WATCHING THIS 

306
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,134
ON TV. 

307
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,168
AT THAT TIME, YOU ALSO WERE 

308
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:29,802
DEALING WITH ISSUES THAT HAD 

309
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:36,141
NOT COME TO THE FOREFRONT, 

310
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:36,408
PUBLICLY. 

311
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:39,011
IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF SEXUAL 

312
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:39,712
HARASSMENT AND IT WAS 

313
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:40,246
STATEMENTS OF SEXUAL 

314
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:40,546
HARASSMENT. 

315
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,781
IT WAS NOT AN ACCUSATION OF 

316
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:46,352
ATTEMPTED SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

317
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,286
HERE, YOU HAVE A MUCH MORE 

318
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,120
SERIOUS ACCUSATION, BUT YOU ARE 

319
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,221
IN A CLIMATE WHERE, NOW, THE 

320
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:58,597
WORD OF THE ACCUSER IS THE WORD 

321
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,498
THAT HAS BEEN BELIEVED ACROSS 

322
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,200
SOCIETY IN RECENT MONTHS OR 

323
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,301
SINCE HARVEY WEINSTEIN. 

324
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,270
THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT TRUE AT 

325
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,338
THE TIME OF ANITA HILL. 

326
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:08,574
>> A WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

327
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,942
HOW THAT FACTORS IN. 

328
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,478
NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO PAUL 

329
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,079
MANAFORT. 

330
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,315
HE ACCEPTED A GUILTY PLEA AND 

331
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,249
HAS A DEAL. 

332
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,551
HOW WILL THIS IMPACT MUELLER'S 

333
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,485
PROBE GOING FORWARD? 

334
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,353
>> BOB MUELLER HIT THE MOTHER 

335
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:21,553
LODE. 

336
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:22,555
WHEN YOU HAVE, FIRST OF ALL, 

337
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,456
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HE GETS. 

338
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,592
HE GETS A LOT OF MONEY. 

339
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:30,763
HE GETS MORE MONEY IN 

340
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,664
FORFEITURE, NOT ROBERT MUELLER, 

341
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,967
BUT THE U.S. TREASURY -- HE GETS

342
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,768
MORE MONEY FROM THE FOUR 

343
00:10:35,768 --> 00:00:00,000
PROPERTIES OF PAUL MANAFORT.
