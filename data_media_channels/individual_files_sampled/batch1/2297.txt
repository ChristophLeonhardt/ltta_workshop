there's a lot of really powerful women out there I would say I actually watched the show DVF um with Diane von Furstenberg and I love her because I just think she's such a strong and empowering female and you know she created this amazing line and it's just she's all about empowering other women and I look up to I guess there's a lot of females out there that are supporting other women and um you know instead of bringing other people down they try to bring each other up I really look up to people that are very confident and you know they use the confidence as motivation to push them further and they don't use it to kind of like slack off or get cocky
