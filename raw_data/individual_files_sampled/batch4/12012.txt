on Wednesday night Milo you innopolis stop by University of California at Berkeley to do his schtick leftist protesters joined by a large contingent of anarchist rioters promptly gave him everything he could ever hope for a riot complete with violent destruction of property large objects set on fire and the innopolis supporters beaten in the streets it was a vicious and disgusting display of just how fascist many on the campus left to become a few thoughts first the campus left has been engaging in the sort of fascism for at least a year not every campus leftist group engages in this sort of violence I spoke at Berkeley last year no problem but a shocking number of campuses have experienced this sort of fascist anti-free speech garbage the innopolis has been at the receiving end of these sorts of receptions at campuses dotting the country and the riots aren't really about you na police they're about the very concept of allowing someone on campus who the left considers radical last February I was met with a near riot at Cal State Los Angeles at Penn State students tried to break through locked doors to disrupt one of my speeches I was banned from DePaul in the aftermath of a student disruption against the innopolis and told that I would be arrested if I set foot on campus Jason Riley of the Wall Street Journal was disinvited by Virginia Tech before finally being allowed on campus so this stuff is happening all the time the academic left second of all has prepared the way for a lot of this campus fascism why is all this happening right now well because the campus left has built up a pseudo intellectual bulwark around such fascism they've told students they deserve safe spaces areas in which their ideas are not challenged in any way they forwarded the culture of microaggressions which urges students to see any speech they find offensive as a form of aggression to be countered by other aggression here's NYU professor Jonathan height on the phenomenon he says the recent collegiate trend of uncovering allegedly racist sexist classist or otherwise discriminatory microaggressions doesn't incidentally teach students to focus on small or accidental slights its purpose is to get students to focus on them and then real able the people who have made such remarks as aggressors as a professor at Cal State LA posted on his door before my speech there last year quote the best response to micro aggression is macro aggression this line of thought actually encourages evil as Professor Roy Baumeister writes an evil inside human violence and cruelty hypersensitive people who often think their pride is assaulted are potentially dangerous even when a neutral observer would conclude no serious provocation occurred it is still important to recognize that in the perpetrator he or she was merely responding to an attack colleges churn out and reward these oversensitive people third riding against speakers you consider radical it helps those speakers you idiots okay Annapolis his shtick it relies on opposition the clips from his features are all about triggering members of the campus left which by the way is the easiest thing in the world to do he relishes this publicity like or dislike Milo and I am certainly no fan if you know anything that I've said about him his provocateur stick only works if he provokes a response way worse than that which he's engaged in when the left shuts down his speeches when they riot when they engage in actual violence when they pepper spray those who come to hear him and hit them with metal poles all they're doing is legitimizing the innopolis in the public eye and making him the victim and selling him lots of books and making him lots of money President Trump has weighed in via Twitter he says that he will withdraw federal funds from UC Berkeley if they can't maintain free speech principles that's actually appropriate spray painting at killed Trump on walls smashing ATMs assaulting people that is not appropriate behavior in any civilized society and for those who are doing the spray-painting and the smashing and the assaulting to proclaim that they're anti-fascist is patently insane forget Ian appleís the issue is the left and they are out of control i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show okay tons to get to today in just a few minutes we're gonna be having on former assembly person from the state of California Mike Gatto he and I got into a Twitter spat a few weeks ago I'm gonna have it on to discuss that to talk capitalism owes Berkeley good guy and we'll be having around in just a couple of minutes we're also gonna be talking more about what happened in Berkeley and what that means plus Donald Trump was at the National Prayer Breakfast so what better time to talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger ratings on The Apprentice yes really this is the world in which we now live we'll get to all of that but first we have to say thank you to our advertisers over

trust them with that then you should trust lyft as well they are the best in the business okay alright so here we are another day another violent outburst and this is becoming more and more common across the country as I say I've been in the middle of these things actually half our staff has been in the middle of these things a lot of our staff was there at Cal State Los Angeles when there was a near riot last year when I spoke at Cal State LA and the question is what's driving this because the truth is the vast majority of people who are showing up to protest these things have never heard of Milo they've never actually seen anything Milo's done or seen anything that I've done or read anything that they've done they've sort of read headlines from salon or slate and that's about it they don't actually do their research if you actually actually wanted to stop Milo the easiest way to do it be to ignore him Milo is sort of like the doomsday monster the more electricity you shoot at him the more he absorbs it and expands if you actually ignored Milo he'd probably go away but the fact is that the left can't ignore Milo because they have decided that in the name of their safe spaces everyone they disagree with must be Ben so you have the mayor of Berkeley coming out beforehand saying that hate speech is not welcome in in his City and that marginalized groups being attacked by people like yin appleís that's something that he doesn't that he's not good with the only marginalized group in Berkeley are the people that the mayor doesn't like okay Berkeley is a haven for a lot of folks I mean there are a lot of people from a lot of different political Isles it's obviously left but I mean that is the place where you let your freak flag fry for a flyer I mean that's it that's basically their motto so the idea that you know there's people coming in who are gonna disagree with that and then they have to be shut out that sort of has bled down unfortunately it's it's blood it's now coming from the top so I think that the election of Trump has made the left in many ways fully insane to the point where civilized behavior is becoming less and less common this of course does not apply to everybody who's a liberal it doesn't apply to every Democrat but there is the strong string that's building up in the more extreme circles that say that violence is okay what they say is somebody's a Nazi violence against Nazis is okay therefore I can attack X right so this is why the other day there's a neo-nazi you know he's a white nationalist is probably fairer named Richard Spencer who's punched in the head on the street while he was doing an interview when so the internet Letta the internet lit up with is it okay to punch a Nazi and the answer is no it's not okay to punch a Nazi it isn't because by the same logic you can punch a Nazi you should be able to kill a Nazi right if you're violating someone's bodily integrity on the basis of their political viewpoint you are doing something uncivilized and wrong but there's an actual argument over can you punch the Nazi okay so a lot of left is great Richard Spencer got punched in the face that's just terrific and then they say well my low is Richard Spencer and then they say well Trump is Richard answer and they say well Shapiro is Richard Spencer and pretty soon is bled down to Mitch McConnell is Richard Spencer anyone I disagree with his Richard Spencer and Richard Spencer is Hitler therefore I can use violence against them Sarah Silverman tweeted today that she wants basically a violent uprising she says fascists should get overthrown well in will use the military to overthrow wake up and join the resistance all caps once the military is with us fascists get overthrown Mad King and his handlers go bye-bye an articulate statement from one of the world's most brilliant political commentators Sarah Silverman yeah and and she's not the only one who's saying this sort of stuff unfortunately we talked the other day about at the Screen Actors Guild David Harper got a standing ovation for saying that you were gonna punch people that you disagree with Joy Behar just yesterday she was she was on the view and on the view Whoopi Goldberg's already labeled Trump the Taliban so here's Joy Behar on the view saying the Democrats ought to bring a rhetorical gun to the knife fight I think their job is to look at what's being brought to them that's how it played out that you know the Democrats always go to a gun fight with a knife yeah let them go with the gun this time yeah the people are the only ones who suffer we need to keep moving forward it will help you fight the fights that are good like pick your battles if you really don't like this candidate fight against him okay so the point here is not that she actually means pick up a gun but this sort of violent rhetoric has has become much much much more common as I say that's not a good thing once the violent rhetoric becomes more common once you label your political opponents the enemy to actually be hurt and everything is on the table then that means you're gonna get a lot more of this sort of activity now I do want to say one quick thing about the Berkeley students not that my guess is that if you look at the footage of these these riots the rioters don't look like Berkeley students they don't look like kids who are lefties at Berkeley it looks like those kids are standing around then a bunch of anarchists came in from Oakland or from or from Berkeley or from San Francisco to make trouble they look like WTO protesters from 1999 smashing windows and looting and and doing this sort of stuff I don't want to blame all Berkeley students for the actions of a few but the problem is this sort of mentality is spreading well joining us now on the program I'm pleased to welcome former assembly person with state of California Mike get our theme is statewide candidate for office soon if I'm not mistaken what are you running for now I cited yet I think politics is a little bit up in the air right okay she's running for governor so my dad oh is is is a longtime assembly person from the state of California he and I got into a Twitter spat the other day and that's why I'm having him on so I think a good place to start is with what's happening in Berkeley what do you make of the of the hubbub of the chaos of what is a riot that happened in Berkeley last night well first of all I was in office when you were at Cal State LA last February and I want to apologize I want to start by apologizing on behalf of the state of California for what you went through I appreciate it thank you I mean nobody should ever when they're on a publicly funded campus that is paid for by taxpayer dollars have to have their free speech quilt you could argue maybe it's different on a private campus but that was a public campus where people sought to clamp down on your free speech the state of California owes you an apology too they sent that I can do it for the on behalf of the whole state okay I appreciate it and it's not your job to do it on behalf of the whole state obviously you didn't do it I only like to put responsibility where it lies but but I appreciate that so yeah I mean I think that the first place to start is that this is why I like having people who disagree on the show I'm gonna start doing this a lot more often now that we can have guests and I think that that's fun because it's fun to have the discussion and it's really negative what happened last night so what is so I won't let's before we get to what we were spouting over on the internet which was which was a lot of fun now would I do want to get to it cuz it's kind of a kick I I want to ask you Assemblyman gotta what do you make of how the hell should the Democrats treat the accession of President Trump so a lot of people see me going kind of nuts over there what do you think is the best way for Democrats to deal with this because obviously I think that the sort of extreme rhetoric and tactics not sure this is gonna be productive correct I was talking to a veteran Democratic Congress member from DC yesterday and he said you know think about it everything that Trump has done so far in office is designed to appeal to rural Pennsylvania and rural Michigan all the key areas of the swing states that Democrats lost and then by lighting cars on fire in Berkeley I'm not sure that we're gonna win those pots back well I appreciate the honesty and I think the obviously I think the Democratic Party could use more people like you and positions of power saying that because it seems like the Democratic Party is moving in a more extreme direction by embracing some of the candidates they're talking about for the DNC chairmanship there's that event a couple of weeks ago where the DNC chair candidates were saying things like as white people we have to sit down and shut up and and we have to we just have to listen to black people it's my job to shut out the other white people that seem to me geared toward lending the white middle-class voter in Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio or Wisconsin so okay so I want to talk a little bit about your broader worldview because the reason that we invite you on in the first place is because we got into this fight as I've referenced a couple of times on Twitter and the reason that that came up is because I wrote a piece about one of the one of the things that the talking point that folks on the Left have been pushing for quite a while this idea that the people at the very top of the income spectrum have way more money than everybody else that people who earned the 1% owned as much wealth as the rest of the world combined that the top 60 people owned as much wealth as 3.5 billion people and basically I wrote so what right the people at the top unless they stole it from the people at the bottom why is this a problem and I talked specifically about Bill Gates who's now about to become the world's first trillionaire apparently and and I said you know there there's hundreds of thousands of people who have worked for Microsoft they create a product that millions of people buy and makes their businesses better what what's the issue here and you then proceeded to tweet this so this is the tweet on feudalism so your screen is a gross over someone we're in person play this great is a gross oversimplification to akin to medieval mentality of kings and Nobles protected us in battle so nobility is awesome so maybe you'd like to explain where that comes from why do you think that and I asked you I asked you so what makes Bill Gates a medieval feudal lord well first of all I never gain as many Twitter followers or I never got my my my behind spanked as much as when I did so your followers are very very enthusiastic yeah but um but the point I was trying to make is this so I'm a traditionalist I believe it round there's a Democratic traditionalist I know that our founding fathers believed in small everything they believed in small government they believed in small concentrations of wealth they thought that if we had the return of nobility in this country that we'd be in a really bad place we looked like those countries in Europe that people had left we would have this great concentration of power it would start to seem like nobility and that's what that reference was and I do believe that there are times in history where the wealthy have more and they start to look like Russian oligarchs and nobody would disagree that Russian oligarchs are kind of like nobility they can control government they have the power of life and death in certain towns and in certain provinces and that's not good for our American Way about well you agree on the idea that Oleg Archy is bad obviously but I'm not comparing Bill Gates to a Russian Oleg I'm not saying abused to but but there is a saying that all great fortunes come from some crime and I don't think that's that's true though unless you can actually prove the crime it's a little bit of a slander to suggest that that people are engaged in crime just because they're wealthy there's a lot of companies that when they start out the regulations are not quite there yet and they act in a regulatory vacuum and in many cases they're taking resources that you could argue belong to society and they are exploiting them to their well unless you're talking about like people actually going into the Commons and drilling for oil in areas that's not owned for example then you know what resource do corporations like Google exploit or corporations like Microsoft exploit it seems to me that their employees are some of the happiest people on the planet seems to us that you know you and I have great technology because of companies like this and and seeing wealth as in an indicator a red flag for something criminal has occurred number one sort of lets people who are poor off the off the hook if they actually commit crime and number two says that wealthy people are actually the ones who are criminals when it seems to me that a lot of the people who are wealthy are wealthy specifically because they're engaging in lots of voluntary mutual transactions which is the way our economy works if it's not voluntary you and I are on the same side right if somebody's actually exploiting somebody else we don't disagree but if somebody is not exploiting somebody then what's the problem so you and I are both against the redistribution of wealth but my point was there's many ways to redistribute it so Rand Paul and Ron Paul both have said to audit the Fed and I've supported yeah I think the Federal Reserve which is it's a quasi governmental agency its appointed by the president the governors are appointed by the president I think that their policies have favored those who own locks lots of stocks and those who and lots of property sorry I favor like like the like the Paul's are of the returns of the gold standard you know I think the gold standard for a long time served our country just fine I actually have a return to the gold standard is well you know it's it's real money and it's tied to something that government can't create so I you can demo credit or understand this is Eris a Democratic traditionalist out there and I think I am one of them I mean I think there's nothing wrong with being a smaller government Democrat and I think there's also nothing wrong with saying that the federal reserve's policies have benefited those who I'm when you're lending money at next nothing and you're inflating these bubbles the people who tend to own those resources benefit from it so and we're in a weird way that's a redistribution of wealth - no I totally agree it's a redistribution of wealth by government and as I say I'm very libertarian on a lot of this stuff and that is keep the government out unless somebody's rights are actually being exploited now I don't wanna hit you over the head with your tweets but I'm gonna hit over the head with your choice so here's saying there's one more this is this is you talking about inherited wealth and again things get dicey on Twitter in a way they don't when we speak to each other face to face says I'm curious what the great grand children of the wealthy invented to wealthy invented to deserve it a smarter Ben Franklin railed against nobility so the implication here seems to be that the founders were against inherited wealth Benjamin Franklin did speak openly about the estate tax he likes the idea of an estate tax because European nobility was not quite the same thing as American capitalism producing people who are wealthy there's a merkin to a system in Europe where the government actually gave charters to specific friends if the government actually looks a lot more like what a presidents of both strikes have been doing actually lately we're you know it looks like the green jobs program or like Trump giving favors to a particular company which it looks like corporatism that's what old-school European nobility look like and in fact Ben Franklin when it came to his own distribution of wealth at his death Ben Franklin actually handed virtually all of his wealth to his children to give a thousand pounds to the city of Philadelphia a thousand pounds to the city of Boston and that was it right so it wasn't like he got reheat he liquidated all his wealth and said kids you're on your own right so are you again are you in favor of the idea of a high estate tax taking lots of money away from people who have already been taxed on that money because we don't want their kids having it so so I do take tend to take the Ben Franklin proach Thomas Jefferson was more of an extremist on the estate tax he didn't think that people should inherit much at all Ben Franklin actually wrote that he thought that the average middle-class person should be able to pass on their home even to homes three homes to their kids but he did think that there really really big estates should suffer some type of estate tax and I think the middle class should not be subject to an estate tax but I think the very very very wealthy the high-end there should be some estate taxes otherwise you just run the risk of our society devolve into a bunch of paris hilton's she's beautiful she's talent but you know it was like her great-grandfather founded something useful and she don't do much and that's what that tweet was was relating to well I mean listen I'm no Paris Hilton fan but I also don't think that I have the right to take away grandpa's wealth just because I don't want Paris Hilton to be doing Carl's jr. commercials yeah but but but that is a little bit of postmodern stuff that you might criticize if the left was saying it because because government does have the right to draw lines when we elect the government whether they're Democrats or Republicans we are saying please draw the lines I think an estate tax would be much more fair than an income tax I I think because you want to remove the income tax if you're in favor of removing the income tax in favor of a small estate tax then maybe I'm with you yeah our country survive for the first hundred fifty years on primarily three taxes there's a sin tax it was the Whiskey ten right there there was a state taxes and there were tariffs and I think if we could come back to some sort of system where weary looked at our tax code and said hey this is more fair we're going to break up large estates we're going to tax sins and we're going to rely on some sort of tariffs to punitive to penalize the worst abusers and of slave labor in third-world countries I think that would be a better system than what we have now okay that's interesting because you know the look I think it's immoral to tax people twice so if you're gonna have an income tax and then you're gonna steal money that I've already paid taxes on one of my I mean you have children and I assume yeah I mean how many kids you have I have two and a third on the way okay congratulations that's exciting so I have two hundred three and the end one of the reasons that I work really hard is because I would like to pass on lots and lots of money to my children so they're enough to work so hard which is part and parcel of the American Dream is not just I work hard I get ahead it's I work hard I get ahead so my kids don't have to work quite as hard to get ahead and when it comes to inherited wealth I think there's this this vast misnomer that the people who are the wealthiest in our society all of them inherited their wealth and actually when you break it down that's not really true like 35 fording to in 2012 there's the Forbes 400 and twelve thirty five percent of the Forbes 400 was born poor or middle-class 22% were born upper-middle class that means 57% were born either poor middle class or upper middle class 11.5% inherited more than a million dollars seven percent inherited more than 50 million so that would be Paris Hilton and 21 percent inherit enough money to just stay on the list right so that tax the 7% I mean when I got the tweets back from with with our exchange from your followers I mean a lot of people said hey I'm just a middle sky do you want to take my wealth the answer's no I do not want to take that wealth I'm the same way I work very hard that my children will have a better life and by the way I am NOT a career politician I I really have had jobs and I have a job now and I'm working very hard but um but I do think we do run this risk of returning to this this era of nobility if we don't break up the vast vast fortunes it's that 7% or 6% you talked about yes use me I don't think those fortunes should be broken up I think the key is to protect the system itself said that those fortunes can't impact government and that means having a smaller government in total because the problem is once you get to the point where the government can confiscate a state wealth you know that the government is so corrupt that there gonna be some estates that somehow escape and there's gonna be some estates they confiscate sales tax they confiscate it income tax they confiscate so many things we have to have tax we have to pay for the crumbling roads in LA that are never paved we have because I made a lot of money well it's not punishing you because you made a lot of money what it's trying to sort of is you're only hitting me if I'm really really wealthy yeah but I mean that listen that's that's how that's how a lot of tax codes are I mean I know they suck well they didn't they do but if you think that the wealthy guy who buys a Rolls Royce he pays more in sales tax than then someone like me who doesn't owner is a choice to buy that car right I mean right that's a little bit that's a little bit different now you're talking about you just look at the bottom line and you say okay you made more than 7 million you made you know 2 million the 7 million Duyck maybe you cut it off at a billion dollars but but the point is I just think I'm a traditionalist and I think our founding fathers believed in this system which was yeah you know you let the you let the person pass on three four or five houses their kids that's fine you let them pass on their cars and their bank accounts but maybe the person who starts to look like a Russian oligarch cuz they've got so much power and so much money we probably don't want that in America and by the way this type of this type of people ignoring this politicians in power ignoring this for so long is why Donald Trump won all these Midwestern states is because he actually talked to people and said look I'm going to try to return good jobs to do your class I think that's right I think it's also I think it's ironic that you say Donald Trump is an example of that because Donald Trump is actually part of that seven thank you so much for stopping by it really is a pleasure to have you and and it's always fun to have a cordial conversation with somebody with whom I disagree so thank you for for the time and thanks
