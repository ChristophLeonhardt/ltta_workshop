so upsetting okay well thank you very much everyone before we begin I'll just say that we're very well prepared from the incoming hurricane we have another one coming so we've done very well North Carolina South Carolina Texas Florida Puerto Rico so many places and we have another one coming and a big one much bigger than they anticipated a week ago seven days ago I heard for the first time there was a very small drop of weather that looked like it was forming and now it's pretty close to a category three if it's not already a category three so we are very well prepared FEMA's ready we're already spoke with Governor Scott spoke to everybody that you have to speak to and I think that hopefully we'll get lucky but maybe that won't happen but we're prepared I wanted to do this because nikki Haley ambassador to the United Nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job she's a fantastic person very importantly but she also is somebody that gets it she has been at the United Nations from the beginning with us right from the beginning and worked with us on the campaign it's been really a long time very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year at the end of a two-year period but the end of the year I want to take a little time off I want to take a little break she's been a very successful as you know governor of South Carolina for eight years and then she she did this and this is possibly even more intense with what's going on in the world and very dangerous and a lot of things but she's done a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we've solved a lot of problems and were in the process of solving a lot of problems at the beginning North Korea was a massive problem and now we're moving along it's moving along really nicely I can speak for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo he thinks the world of me key and so we're all we're all happy for you in one way but we hate to lose you hopefully you'll be coming back at some point but you want to just in maybe a different capacity you can have your pick but I just want to let you know so at the end of the year Nikki will be leaving and we'll be in constant touch I know that whenever you have any ideas you're gonna call me because you know all the players and that was really the thing I think she did best at the United Nations she got to know the players she got to know China Russia India she knows everybody on a very first name basis and they like her except for maybe a couple which is normal right they can't all like you but they do they really like her and I think maybe more importantly they respect her so Nikki I just wanted to tell you that we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss you nevertheless and you have done a fantastic job and I want to thank you very much well I want to say first of all I want to thank the president for just you know allowing us to come out and talk to you this way it has been in honor of a lifetime I you know I said I am such a lucky girl to have been able to lead the state that raised me and to serve a country I love so very much has really been a blessing and I want to thank you for that but I'm most excited look at the two years look at what has happened in two years with the United States on foreign policy now the United States has respected countries may not like what we do but they respect what we do they know that if we say we're gonna do something we follow it through and the president proved that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it's with NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether it's the trade deals which have been amazing they get that the president means business and they follow through with that but then if you look at just these two years at the UN we've cut 1.3 billion in the UN's budget we've made it stronger we've made it more efficient South Sudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming three North Korean sanctions packages which were the largest in a generation done in a way that we could really work towards denuclearizing North Korea the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country needs to understand you can't overlook all of the bad things they're doing you have to see them for the threat that they are I think you look at the anti-israel bias and the strike encouraged that the president showed in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we will put our embassy where we want to put our embassy you know all of those things have made a huge difference in the u.s. standing but I can tell you that it's the u.s. is strong again and the u.s. is strong in a way that should make all Americans very proud and I do want to say that it's not just the president I want to thank the family in general the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me I can't say enough good things about Jared Namanga jared is such a hidden genius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did what I've done working with him on the Middle East peace plan it is so unbelievably well done and Ivanka has been just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes that I wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they're in this administration I also just have to say certainly thank you to my family Michael is a saint and my two little ones I adore them anta team US UN you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it but they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America proud and so with that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good place and for the next ambassador to come in but it's a great day in the United States and I'm proud to have been part of the team now I don't have anything set on where I'm go I think that the main thing was I was governor for six years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand-year flood a church shooting a school shooting that was a lot and then to come in and do two years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be selfless enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so thank you mr. president it's been an honor of a lifetime and I will say this for all of you that are gonna ask about 2020 no I'm not running for 2020 I can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I look forward to supporting the president in the next election okay thank you you listed off a long list of accomplishments why would you want to leave that all behind is it is it really a personal decision because you've been away from your family for so long my family is very supportive so no there's no personal reasons I think that it's just very important for government officials to understand when it's time to step aside and I have given everything I've got these last eight years and I do think that sometimes it's good to rotate in other people who can put that same energy and power into it so there really is a lot of people are going to want to say there's a lot of reasons why I'm leaving the truth is I want to make sure that that this administration the president has the strongest person to fight it was a blessing to go into the UN with body armor every day and defend America and I'll always do that I'll never truly step aside from fighting for our country but I will tell you that I think it's time mr. president why make the announcement now as opposed to after the midterms Nicki's going to be staying til the end of the til the end of the year which will be just about two years and I just think and I was just as Nicky was speaking I was thinking when we came into office it was almost inevitable in the minds of many that we were going to war with North Korea if you ask President Obama I'm sure he'll tell you that was by far his biggest problem when we sat and met right here but that looked like a real problem Iran looked like a real problem there was a question of when would they take over the Middle East prior to my coming here and now Iran is fighting for their lives they've got riots at all their cities it's blowing up their inflation their economy is in tatters and at some point they'll probably come and want to make a real deal not to deal but they made the ridiculous deal that they made that was unacceptable to me and so we'll see what happens but what a difference between Iran when we first came I'd like to say the day before we came and also if you look at North Korea and then there was a deal that it was something that was it was a devastating potentially devastating problem and now the relationships are very good Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just left had a great meeting also was in China also spoke to many of the Asian leaders or went there and had some good meetings but had a really very good meeting with North Korea and Chairman Kim and we've just made a lot of progress and so many other fronts also and I think the world as Nicky said the world is really respecting the United States again much more so they haven't than they have in many many decades we are respected again that I can tell you very much respect and again and people want to be on our side even if you look at the votes in the United Nation votes that we would normally get no votes we're getting very strong votes now so I just want to thank Nicky and I thought this would be an appropriate way of doing it because when you write it out on a piece of paper that you know ambassador Haley will be leaving and you say nice things people say whoa what's going on this is the right way to do and when you really think somebody's done a terrific job I felt this was an appropriate way of doing it and we both liked it so I just want to thank the ambassador I just want to thank Nicky okay success well we have a number of people that would very much like to do it it's a great position and Nikki realizes them she's she's I think she's helped make it a much better position if you want to know that I think it's become maybe a more glamourous position than it was two years ago maybe I wonder why but it is yeah I mean she's made it a very glamorous position she's ready to a more important more importantly a more important position so we have I can almost say many people that want to do it and they're very good people and I'll be I'll be talking also to Nikki about that and to the general about that and my staff but we have many people that are are very very much interested in doing it not only I'm not frustrated I think it's incredible what's happening you're talking about North Korea it's amazing the way the media who you with so it's amazing the way that media says that you know for 80 years they couldn't do a thing and I'm what are we in three months of negotiation it's ridiculous as I've said about a thousand times she had no rockets lying you have no missiles flying you have no nuclear testing you have nuclear closings at closing up different areas of North Korea we're getting the remains back it's already started of our great heroes where we got our hostages back and I didn't pay one point eight billion dollars like the previous administration we got I paid nothing but I have agreed to meet and I have agreed to spend time but how long has it been since we left Singapore it was three months or so and people say that's that's the media saying like how Co would be negative let's see he's done really well how can we be negative oh are you disappointed with this bit I think the speed is amazing you have no nuclear tests you have no rockets and we have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim which is very important I like him he likes me the relationship is good Mike Pompeo had a very very good meeting I mean I spoke to him at length yesterday and he'll be coming back he'll be back tonight and so I've been just the opposite I think we've made incredible progress beyond incredible beyond a I don't think the some of the press I miss P as some of the president covers that accurately and right but some of the press really doesn't yes happening and we're setting that up right now that was part of the reason that Mike was going over to meet there setting up the meeting and we'll be announcing that probably a different location Singapore was fantastic but we'll probably do a different location he'd probably like that I'd like that too I think it would be good but we'll see what we're talking about three or four different locations timing won't be too far away we've made a lot of progress and this meeting really is - you know people don't realize the importance of the first meeting I mean we said point number one D nuclearization and for some reason the press doesn't pick that up but there was actually point number one they've agreed to deed nuclearization and they continue to agree and they continue now we haven't removed sanctions as you know people said what have we done we have it removed sanctions we have very big sanctions I'd love to remove them but we have to get something for doing well you know I don't want to embarrass anybody by asking I think eventually we're gonna have lots of meetings on US soil and on their soil by the way just you know that's a two-way street on their soil also I think that the country of North Korea is going to be a very successful country I think it's going to be incredibly economically successful and I want to make it that way I think it's going to be good other countries of their people entrepreneurs banks I will tell you they're calling wanting to go there and wanting to invest at some point when chairman Kim makes that decision I think he's going to unleash something that's going to be spectacular really spectacular and I think he knows it and I think that's one of the reasons that we're having very successful conversation I think he wants to get on with it yes excuse me I would say we'll name a successor I don't know within the next two or three weeks maybe sooner I have none no I haven't but I will be at some point I know nothing right now I know what everybody else does nothing yes what's your response to Hillary Clinton saying last night's swearing-in of Judge Cavanaugh was more political event that it was a national event I guess that's why she lost she doesn't get it she never did it I knew that a long time ago Hillary never got it that's why she lost anything else I think we're gonna do well well you people would say I guess if you saw there was a 5% drop off you'd say there's something wrong with the president you would say but now I'm going to Iowa tonight we have a big big crowd gonna make a big announcement tonight by the way in Iowa we're gonna be begging a very big announcement and I have to say the farmers are so thrilled with the us MCA the new agreement I don't use the word NAFTA because NAFTA was a disaster for our country and after we lost millions and millions of jobs thousands and thousands of factories and plants and bad for farmers and look what happened to our farmers over the last 15 years it's only gone down now they're gonna go up we just opened up Mexico we just opened up Canada and it's great for our farmers but I'm going to Iowa tonight and we'll be talking a little Evan all tonight and got some great things planned speaking of that I will say if you look at industries the steel industry in this country is back like nothing I've ever seen before in a period of six months since we started doing what I'm doing the steel industry has literally revived us steel is opening up eight plants new core is opening up everybody is the steel industry in our in our country is really really hot so it's been it should be great but I'll be going to Iowa tonight we have a very good relationship with China but you know they took out five hundred billion out of our country for many years each year and we just can't let that happen this should have been talked about by people in this chair for many years look for years and years they would take it out two hundred three hundred four hundred and even five hundred billion dollars a year we helped rebuild China if we don't do that China's not where they are right now and that's fine with me but we're not doing it any longer if they do that if they retaliate what does retaliate me they've already retaliated they've taken out five hundred billion dollars that's I think that's the ultimate retaliation now look China wants to make a deal and I say they're not ready yet I just say they're not running it and we've cancelled a couple of meetings because I just say they're not ready to make a deal we can't have a one-way street it's got to be a two-way street it's been a one-way street for 25 years we've got to make it a two-way street we've got a benefit also okay thank you any other questions so I just want to finish because this is really the pure reason for this as Nicky you've been fantastic you're my friend and I just on behalf of the country I want to thank you for a great job thank you thank you very much everybody
