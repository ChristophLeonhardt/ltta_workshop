00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,857
POLITICAL LOW ON THE OTHER SIDE

00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:09,491
OF THE ARGUMENT KEY G.O.P.

6
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:11,226
SENATORS SAY THAT RESIDENTS

7
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:13,762
REMARKS ABOUT BLASEY FORD ARE

8
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,964
APPALLING, UNACCEPTABLE AND JUST

9
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:15,531
PLAIN WRONG.

00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:18,367

YOU ARE DOING GREAT AND IT'S AN

22
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,383
HONOR TO BE WITH YOU.

23
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:36,619
I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE SHOW.

24
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,286
YOU'VE DONE AMAZING WORK ON

25
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,954
SUPREME COURT ISSUES OVER THE

26
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,656
YEARS AND YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE

27
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:41,023
VERY WELL.

28
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,491
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S EVER BEEN

29
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:45,294
THAT BAD OR THIS BAD AS IT IS

30
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:45,728
NOW.

31
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:58,440
THE SAD PART IS TO ME IT'S

32
00:00:58,441 --> 00:00:59,041
GETTING -- ONE POLITICS,

33
00:00:59,042 --> 00:00:59,675
POLITICIANS ARE SAYING GET

34
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:00,409
SAYING GET IN HER FACE AND THEY

35
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,143
ARE FOLLOWING SARAH SANDERS AND

36
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:01,810
KICKING HER FAMILY OUT OF A

37
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,444
RESTAURANT OR PAM BONDI OR

38
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,178
SECRETARY NIELSEN, THEN IT'S TED

00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,750
GET HURT HERE.

44
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:10,019
WE ARE AT A TIPPING POINT BUT

45
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,989
THE BIG CHALLENGE NOW IS THIS,

46
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,158
WHETHER AMERICA IS GOING TO

47
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,359
REMAIN A COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES

48
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,762
IN DUE PROCESS, THE PRESUMPTION

49
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:21,897
OF INNOCENCE, OUR CONSTITUTION,

50
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:23,966
THE RULE OF LAW, OR WHETHER OR

51
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:24,700
NOT GUILT BY ACCUSATION RULES

52
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:25,067
THE DAY.

53
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:27,803
AND WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT

54
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,038
PROBABLY BY FRIDAY, SATURDAY AT

55
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,739
THE LATEST, WHETHER OR NOT

56
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,976
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO STAND

57
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:35,778
UP AGAINST WHAT ARE ALLEGATIONS

58
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,746
THAT HAVE NO CORROBORATION,

59
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,382
INCONSISTENCIES.

60
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:41,116
IT'S A VERY CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR

61
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:43,285
THE COUNTRY IN MY VIEW.

62
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:45,020
>> Shannon: THERE ARE A NUMBER

63
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:45,654

00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:45,954
FENCE.

65
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:48,390
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE REALLY

66
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,024
WATCHING, A COUPLE OF KEY

67
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,226
DEMOCRATS AS WELL BUT THEY SAY

68
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:51,994
THEY HAVE A NEGATIVE REACTION TO

69
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:53,996
THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT AND HIS

70
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:54,563
RALLY.

71
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:55,998
HERE IS WHAT SENATOR LINDSEY

72
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:56,799
GRAHAM, A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE

73
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,100
PRESIDENT, HERE'S WHAT HE SAID

74
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:58,801
ABOUT THOSE COMMENTS FROM LAST

75
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:03,572
NIGHT.

76
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:04,306
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT THROUGH

77
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:05,374
A RENDITION THAT I DIDN'T

78
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,075
PARTICULARLY LIKE AND I WOULD

79
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:07,409
TELL HIM TO KNOCK IT OFF, YOU'RE

80
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,578
NOT HELPING.

81
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:11,413
IT COULD BE WORSE.

82
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:12,981
YOU CAN ACTUALLY KILL SOMEBODY'S

83
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:13,649
CAT AND PUNCTURE SOMEBODY'S

84
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,218
TIRES TO GET THEM TO SHUT UP.

85
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:16,952
>> Shannon: 'S REFERENCE THEIR

86
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:19,621
BACK TO THE CLINTON YEARS.

87
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:20,989
>> THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD.

88
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,591
KEITH ELLISON MORE RECENTLY.

89
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,425
IN THE CASE OF THE WOMAN THAT IS

90
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:24,793
ACCUSING HIM.

91
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,162
I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY OF THESE

92
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:27,896
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY

93
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,198
COMMITTEE OR ANY OF THE

94
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,499
DEMOCRATS CALL FOR AN FBI

95
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,533
INVESTIGATION INTO KEITH ELLISON

96
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:34,937
AND APPARENTLY THE WOMAN MAKING

97
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,438
THE ALLEGATIONS, HIS TEXT

98
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,474
MESSAGES, TAPE RECORDINGS,

99
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:39,875
DOCTORS REPORTS AND THEY SAY

100
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,211
NOTHING, OR IN THE CASE OF

101
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,278
BILL CLINTON, IF WE REALLY WANT

102
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,446
TO GO BACK TO PEOPLE EARLIER IN

103
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:46,715
THEIR LIVES, WE CAN GO BACK TO

104
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,284
WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS THE

105
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:51,520
ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE RAPE

106
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:52,154
ACCUSATION.

107
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:55,991
THE DOUBLE STANDARDS STINKS TO

108
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:56,792
HIGH HEAVEN.

109
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:57,693
YOU MENTIONED THREE REPUBLICANS.

110
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,928
THEY ASKED FOR THE FBI REPORT.

111
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,629
MY SOURCES TONIGHT ARE TELLING

112
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,331
ME THAT IT PRETTY MUCH JUST

113
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:02,965
REITERATES WHAT THE SENATE

114
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,768
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THEIR

115
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,335
CONCLUSIONS, WHAT THE

116
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,203
INVESTIGATION IS.

117
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,172
A MEMBER, THE FBI WILL NOT REACH

118
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:11,406
CONCLUSIONS.

119
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:12,141
THEY WILL NOT MAKE

120
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:12,608
RECOMMENDATIONS.

121
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,643
IF THAT'S THE CASE, HOW DID

122
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,178
THESE THREE REPUBLICANS

123
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:19,148
JUSTIFIED NOW MOVING THE BAR?

124
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:21,183
MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE THE PROPER

125
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:21,683
TEMPERAMENT.

126
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:22,351
>> Shannon: THEY ARE WORRIED

127
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,152
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE JUDGE

128
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:24,953
AND THE PROFESSOR IT APPEARS

129
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,189
HAVE NOT BEEN INTERVIEWED.

130
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,257
THEY SAY IT'S NOT COMPLETE

131
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:29,725
WITHOUT THOSE TWO, ALTHOUGH THEY

132
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,059
HAVE BOTH GIVEN HOURS OF SWORN

133
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,794
TESTIMONY.

134
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,694
>> THEY HAVE GIVEN HOURS OF

135
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,429
SWORN TESTIMONY.

136
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,264
UNLESS THEY HAVE SOMETHING NEW

137
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:36,398
TO OFFER WE ALREADY KNOW WHERE

138
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,132
THEY STAND, WE KNOW WHAT THEIR

139
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,169
STORIES ARE.

140
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,304
IN THE CASE OF PROFESSOR FORD,

141
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,972
SHE SAID THERE WAS AN EYEWITNESS

142
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,674
TO THE ALLEGED ASSAULT, THE

143
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:46,408
EYEWITNESS APPARENTLY AGAIN HAS

144
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,077
GONE ON RECORD SAYING IT NEVER

145
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:49,611
HAPPENED.

146
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,180
HER BEST FRIEND SAYS SHE HAS NO

147
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:53,415
RECOLLECTION OF EVER BEING AT

148
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,349
ANY PARTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS

149
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,618
HAPPENED OR WAS EVER TOLD ABOUT

150
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:58,787
IT OR EVER MET OR KNEW JUDGE

151
00:03:58,788 --> 00:03:59,588
KAVANAUGH.

152
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:02,424
IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN, WITH EACH

153
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:03,025
CASE, THIS IS PIVOTAL.

154
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:06,695
WE ARE NOT A COUNTRY -- WITH

155
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,030
COTTON THINGS WRONG IN THE

156
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:08,330
MEDIA.

157
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,366
A LOT OF OUR COLLEAGUES -- I WAS

LOCALHOST IN ATLANTA AT THE

160
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:13,802
TIME.

161
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:14,937
AND HE THANKED ME FOR NOT

162
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:17,506
RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.

163
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,842
WITH THE DUKE LACROSSE, UVA,

164
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:20,375

JUDGMENT.

169
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:26,648
IF THEY THINK THEY KNOW HOW

170
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,383
THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO WORK

171
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:28,984
OUT.

172
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,786
THERE'S BEEN A FULL -- NOW SEVEN

173
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,788
INVESTIGATIONS INTO KAVANAUGH.

174
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,223
HE HAS MADE A PASSIONATE DEFENSE

175
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:37,426
OF HIS POSITION AND WITHOUT ANY

176
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,126
CORROBORATION THIS MAN BELONGS

177
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:42,531
IN THE COURT AND THE RISK IS IF

178
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,433
THE REPUBLICANS NOW MOVE THE

179
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:45,634

TEMPERAMENT, NOT ABOUT THE FBI

182
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:49,238
REPORT.

183
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,005
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS THEY HAVE

184
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:53,976
NOW OPENED THE DOOR THAT EVERY

185
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:54,943
SINGLE PERSON EVER BROUGHT IN TO

186
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:58,380
ANY IMPORTANT OFFICE IS GOING TO

00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:06,054
FRANKLY THE BLUDGEONING OF THEIR

191
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:06,521
FAMILY.

192
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:07,155
>> Shannon: HAS GOING TO

193
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,423
HAPPEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

194
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,591
AISLE.

195
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:10,826
>> IT WILL GO BOTH WAYS.

196
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,027
>> Shannon: AS A WOMAN AND AS

197
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:13,428
AN ATTORNEY I DO THINK IT'S VERY

198
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:14,096
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE COME

199
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,364
FORWARD WITH THESE ACCUSATIONS

200
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,466
BUT THEN THAT WE DO HAVE DUE

201
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:18,000
PROCESS.

202
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,534
>> AS A FATHER OF A DAUGHTER,

203
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,270
SOMEBODY WHO HAS THREE SISTERS,

204
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:26,008
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I WAS

205
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,210
GLAD THE REPUBLICANS TOOK THIS

206
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,511
SERIOUSLY.

207
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:33,248
THEY DID THE RIGHT THING, BUT

208
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,183
THE EVIDENCE DIDN'T CORROBORATE

209
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:35,651
IT.

210
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,019
AT THAT POINT WE ARE A COUNTRY

211
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,122
THAT BELIEVES IN DUPE PROCESS

212
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:40,889
AND PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND

213
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,457
IF IT DOESN'T END UP THAT WAY WE

214
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,126
WILL HAVE GONE BACKWARDS IN WAYS

215
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:48,430
THAT I THINK WILL BE

216
00:05:48,431 --> 00:00:00,000
UNPREDICTABLE AT THIS HOUR.
