1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:02,828
>> Tucker: THAT WOULD BE

2
00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:03,428
SHOCKING.

3
00:00:03,428 --> 00:00:04,029
THANK YOU BOTH.

4
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:06,231
I HOPE YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

5
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:07,499
THOSE.

6
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:09,267
TED MALIK WAS AN INFORMER

7
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,169
ADVISOR TO THE DONALD TRUMP

8
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:11,536
CAMPAIGN.

9
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:12,304
IN MARCH HE SAYS HE WAS DETAINED

10
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,273
AT AN AIRPORT BY INVESTIGATORS

11
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,441
FOR ROBERT MUELLER WHO TOOK AWAY

12
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,644
HIS CELL PHONE AND ASKED ABOUT

13
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,478
HIS TIES TO ROGER STONE AMONG

14
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:19,911
OTHER THINGS.

15
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:22,914
HE IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE

16
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:24,583
BOOK "THE PLOT TO DESTROY TRUMP"

17
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:28,253
ABOUT THE DEEP STATE.

18
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,855
GIFFORD COMING ON.

19
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:30,322
>> GOOD EVENING.

20
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:30,989
>> Tucker: WHEN YOU SAY YOU

21
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,026
WERE DETAINED, THAT'S KIND OF A

22
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:34,826
REMARKABLE STORY.

23
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,862
TELL US THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF

24
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:39,197
THIS.

25
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:43,235
>> ESPECIALLY FOR YALE, OXFORD

26
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:44,236
BUSINESS PROFESSOR TO BE STOPPED

27
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:46,038
AT AN AIRPORT, TAKEN INTO A ROOM

28
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:50,709
AND ASK QUESTIONS BY THE FBI AND

29
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:51,643
HAVING THEIR PHONE UNDER A

30
00:00:51,643 --> 00:00:52,444
WARRANT SEIZED.

31
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:54,546
I WRITE ABOUT THIS IN THE BOOK

32
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:55,847
AS A POSTSCRIPT AND MY LAWYERS

33
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,082
TELL ME NOT TO CONFIRM OR DENY

34
00:00:57,082 --> 00:01:01,153
VERY MUCH ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I'M

35
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:01,887
STILL ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN

36
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,822
THIS CONVERSATION.

37
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:06,024
>> Tucker: I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

38
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,826
WHY WOULD THAT PUT YOU WITH

39
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:09,161
LEGAL PERIL IF YOU BELIEVE THE

40
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:10,862
GOVERNMENT OVERSTEPPED AND

41
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,864
DETAINED YOU -- THE LOGAN

42
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,066
AIRPORT IN BOSTON, RIGHT?

43
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:14,700
FLYING IN FROM ABROAD.

44
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,268
THEY PULL YOU ASIDE, TAKE YOUR

45
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:16,835
CELL PHONE AND ASK YOU

46
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:17,436
QUESTIONS.

47
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:18,370
YOU HAVE NO LAWYER PRESENT, IS

48
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,672
THAT CORRECT, DURING THIS

49
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:21,106
CONVERSATION?

50
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:24,309
>> NONE AT ALL.

51
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:26,478
>> Tucker: SO HOW -- WHY WOULD

52
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:28,246
YOU BE IN JEOPARDY BY EXERCISING

53
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:28,980
THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

54
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,282
EXPLAIN THE TRUTH?

55
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:33,852
>> I HAVE EXPLAINED IT AS A

56
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:34,853
POSTSCRIPT TO THE BOOK AND

57
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:35,554
ACTUALLY DETAILED IT AND I'M

58
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,955
TOLD THAT THE FBI IS NOT ALL

59
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:41,693
THAT HAPPY ABOUT THAT FACT.

60
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:42,828
THEREFORE, I'M NOT REALLY AT

61
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:43,595
LIBERTY TO SAY A WHOLE LOT MORE

62
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:47,232
ABOUT WHERE THIS STANDS AT

63
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,266
PRESENT.

64
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,635
>> Tucker: GIVE US A SENSE,

65
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:53,672
WHEN YOU SAT DOWN YOU HAD NO

66
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:54,005
LAWYER.

67
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:55,474
IT'S GENERALLY NOT ADVISED TO

68
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:56,308
TALK TO THE FBI WITHOUT A

69
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:56,675
LAWYER.

70
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:57,876
DID THEY JUST GRAB YOU IF YOU

71
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,177
GOT OFF THE PLANE?

72
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:00,145
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THEM WHEN

73
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:03,448
THEY DID?

74
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:06,685
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2

75
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:06,718
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2I

76
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:06,752
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2U

77
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:06,785
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2E

78
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:06,818
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2,

79
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:06,852
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2A

80
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:07,018
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2S

81
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:07,119
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2I

82
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:07,152
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2S

83
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:07,219
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2Y

84
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:07,252
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2A

85
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:07,285
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2D

86
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:07,319
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2T

87
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:07,352
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2E

88
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:07,586
>> THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2N

89
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,455
DIVIDED ME FROM MY WIFE AND THEN

90
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:14,392
SEARCHED MY BELONGINGS AND TOOK

91
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:17,863
ME TO A SEPARATE BUILDING TO

92
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:18,864
INTRODUCE ME TO TWO FBI AGENTS

93
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:20,632
WHO ASKED ME A SERIES OF

94
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:20,999
QUESTIONS.

95
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:25,637
ACTUALLY IT WAS QUITE CHIT

96
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:26,438
CHATTY FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

97
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,272
AS A FAN OF THE

98
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:27,973
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES THEY ASKED

99
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,442
ME WHAT I THOUGHT OF THEIR

100
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,109
VICTORY AT THE SUPER BOWL.

101
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:31,843
>> Tucker: THAT'S WHAT THEY

102
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:33,245
SAID TO MIKE FLYNN DURING HIS

103
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:36,648
CHIT CHATTY CONVERSATION.

104
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,250
THEY HAD A WARRANT FOR ALL OF

105
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,119
THIS, I ASSUME, IS THAT RIGHT?

106
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:41,853
>> CORRECT.

107
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:42,354
>> Tucker: OKAY.

108
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:48,827
WHAT DID THEY ASK YOU?

109
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,063
>> AS I SAID IN THE POSTSCRIPT,

110
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:53,431
THERE WERE VERY FEW SUBSTANTIVE

111
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:53,799
QUESTIONS.

112
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,468
SOME ABOUT INDIVIDUALS, WHAT MY

113
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,435
RELATIONSHIP WASN'T TO THE

114
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:58,103
CAMPAIGN.

115
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:58,737
THEY SEEM TO KNOW ALL THE

116
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:03,308
ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS.

117
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,643
>> Tucker: DID YOU CONSIDER

118
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,777
SAYING BUZZ OFF, I'M NOT GOING

119
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:07,813
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS?

120
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,581
>> I THINK HAD THEY GOTTEN ANY

121
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,551
MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN IN FACT

122
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,252
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE,

123
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:15,821
BUT THEY WERE FAIRLY BENIGN.

124
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,523
I'M A PATRIOTIC AMERICAN.

125
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,091
A COLD WAR ERA.

126
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:21,259
I WORKED IN THE

127
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:21,760
STATE DEPARTMENT.

128
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,161
I WAS THE TOP AMERICAN IN THE

129
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,297
U.N. IN GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, FOR

130
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:27,465
FOUR YEARS AT THE END OF THE

131
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:27,833
COLD WAR.

132
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,868
I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO

133
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:30,569
COOPERATE IN ANY INQUIRY.

134
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,438
I DON'T THINK I HAVE MUCH TO

135
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:34,239
ADD.

136
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:34,973
>> Tucker: WHY DO YOU THINK

137
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:37,209
THEY WANTED TO TALK TO YOU?

138
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,979
>> MY PUBLISHER THINKS THAT THEY

139
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,848
READ MY BOOK ON THE PLOT TO

140
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:43,615
DESTROY THE PRESIDENT, WHICH IS

141
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:48,653
IN FACT ABOUT THE CONSPIRACY --

142
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,689
THE FIRST IN AMERICAN HISTORY

143
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,457
SINCE 1783 AND THE NEWBURGH

144
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,426
CONSPIRACY THAT TRIED TO

145
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,193
OVERTHROW A SITTING PRESIDENT OF

146
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,697
THE UNITED STATES.

147
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,497
>> Tucker: WHY DID THEY ASK

148
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:02,868
YOU ABOUT ROGER STONE?

149
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,135
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

150
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:06,137
I'VE MET ROGER STONE THREE TIMES

151
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:06,671
I'VE MET ROGER STONE THREE TIME

152
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:06,972
TIMES.

153
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:07,739
HE DID WRITE THE FORWARD TO MY

154
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,641
NEW BOOK BECAUSE WE HAD THE SAME

155
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,475
PUBLISHER.

156
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,577
HE GAVE AN ADDRESS AT

157
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:13,345
OXFORD UNIVERSITY ABOUT EIGHT OR

158
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:16,380
TEN WEEKS AGO AND IT WAS A

159
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,182
PRETTY COMPELLING STORY ABOUT

160
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:20,151
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 2016

161
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:21,253
ELECTION AND WE HAD IT

162
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:21,653
TRANSCRIBED.

163
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,956
I HAD ATTENDED THAT LECTURE, AND

164
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,459
WE USED IT AS THE FORWARD TO THE

165
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:27,759
BOOK.

166
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,262
MAYBE THEY READ MORE INTO THAT

167
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:31,363
THEN IS THE CASE.

168
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:32,330
>> Tucker: WHAT DID THEY DO TO

169
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:32,731
YOUR PHONE?

170
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,498
YOU SAID THEY HAD A WARRANT FOR

171
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:36,468
YOUR PHONE?

172
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:36,801
>> YES.

173
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:40,038
THEY CONFISCATED MY PHONE AND

174
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:40,839
I'M TOLD IT'S BEEN RETURNED TO

175
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,840
ME AND I SHOULD BE RECEIVING IT

176
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,510
ANY DAY.

177
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,978
>> Tucker: THEY TOOK YOUR

178
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:47,379
PHONE AWAY?

179
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,848
HOW LONG HAVE THEY HAD IT?

180
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:51,483
>> SINCE THAT DAY, WHICH WAS

181
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:54,519
BEFORE EASTER.

182
00:04:54,519 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: I WOULD BE PRETTY
