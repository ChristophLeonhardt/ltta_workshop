TUNNEL TRUMP GAVE A SPEECH IN
REGARD TO OUR POLICY WITH CUBA,
AND OF COURSE IN HIS EFFORT TO
ROLL BACK ANYTHING THAT OBAMA
DID, HE HAS DECIDED THAT, NO,
LIFTING THE EMBARGO ON CUBA
ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.
HE GIVES INTERESTING REASONS AS
TO WHY HE THINKS THAT'S THE
CASE, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY ON
CANCELING THE LAST
ADMINISTRATION'S COMPLETELY
ONE-SIDED DEAL WITH CUBA.
OUR NEW POLICY BEGINS WITH
STRICTLY ENFORCING U.S. LAW.
WE
WILL NOT LIFT SANCTIONS ON THE
CUBAN REGIME UNTIL ALL POLITICAL
PRINTERS ARE FREED, FREEDOMS OF
ASSEMBLY AND EXPRESSION ARE
RESPECTED, ALL POLITICAL PARTIES
ARE LEGALIZED, AND FREE AND
INTERNATIONALLY SUPERVISED
ELECTIONS ARE SCHEDULED.
WE WILL
VERY STRONGLY RESTRICT AMERICAN
DOLLARS FLOWING TO THE MILITARY,
SECURITY, AND INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES THAT ARE THE CORE OF
THE CASTRO REGIME.
THEY WILL BE
RESTRICTED.
WE WILL ENFORCE THE
BAN ON TOURISM.
WE WILL ENFORCE
THE EMBARGO.
WE WILL TAKE
CONCRETE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT
INVESTMENTS FLOW DIRECTLY TO THE
PEOPLE, SO THEY CAN OPEN PRIVATE
BUSINESSES AND BEGIN TO BUILD
THEIR COUNTRY'S GREAT, GREAT
FUTURE, A COUNTRY OF GREAT
POTENTIAL.
IT'S FASCINATING, BECAUSE HE
THINKS WE CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH
CUBA.
I MEAN, THEY DON'T RESPECT
THEIR PEOPLE.
THERE ARE ALL
THESE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND
VIOLATIONS, WE CAN'T HAVE ANY OF
IT.
NO, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT, IT'S ALL ABOUT
PANDERING TO CUBAN VOTERS IN
FLORIDA SPECIFICALLY, AND TO
GIVE YOU QUICK STATS ON THAT, IN
FLORIDA CUBANS WERE ABOUT TWICE
AS LIKELY AS NON-CUBAN LATINOS
TO VOTE FOR TRUMP, MORE THAN
HALF SUPPORTED HIM DURING THIS
LAST ELECTION.
HE'S PANDERING TO
THEM, IF HE REALLY CARED ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THEIR OTHER
COUNTRIES HE'S DEFINITELY OKAY
DOING BUSINESS WITH.
LIKE TEXAS.
RIGHT, THAT ARE MUCH WORSE
WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN RIGHTS
ISSUES.
SAUDI ARABIA, FOR
INSTANCE, WHICH WE KEEP BRINGING
UP, IS TERRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO
HUMAN RIGHTS, AND IF YOU WANT TO
FOCUS ON WHAT THEY'VE DONE ON AN
INTERNATIONAL SCALE, FOCUS ON
YEMEN.
SAUDI ARABIA HAS
COMMITTED NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS OF
INTERNATIONAL LAW SINCE
COALITION AIRSTRIKE BEGAN.
CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED AND
WOUNDED, AIRSTRIKES ARE THE
SINGLE LARGEST CAUSE OF CIVILIAN
CASUALTIES IN YEMEN.
AND IN
THEIR OWN COUNTRY, THE
BEHEADINGS.
BABY HAD PEOPLE FOR
NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES, FOR
INSTANCE.
BUT THAT'S NOT A HUMAN
RIGHTS ISSUE, HE'S NOT CONCERNED
ABOUT THAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE
PROFITS FROM BUSINESS EELS WITH
SAUDI ARABIA.
IT'S NOT ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS.
I'M NOT GOING TO
SIT HERE AND PRETEND CUBA IS
PERFECT, THEY DON'T HAVE A
DEMOCRACY OR ALLOW ELECTIONS,
THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING UNDER
THE CASTRO START BACK BUT I ALSO
KNOW THAT THE EMBARGO DID NOT
WORK, AND IF YOU WANT ACTUAL
CHANGE IN CUBA YOU DON'T DO IT
BY SHUTTING THEM OUT AND
THINKING THAT'S GOING TO
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
OBVIOUSLY WE HAD THE EMBARGO
FOR DECADES AND IT MADE NO
DIFFERENCE.
THE EMBARGO JUST NEEDED TIME.
IF YOU JUST HAD A LITTLE
PATIENCE, THAT THING I
THINK WAS ABOUT TO KICK IN.
THE PANDERING IS UNBEARABLE.
I
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WORSE, THIS
PANDERING OR THE HOT SAUCE IN MY
PURSE PANDERING THAT HILLARY
DID.
BUT THE PANDERING DRIVES ME
CRAZY REGARDLESS OF WHO DID IT.
I UNDERSTAND, YOU AND I WERE
ON THE SAME PAGE REGARDING
HILLARY -- BUT THE HOT SAUCE
PANDERING IS JUST STUPID.
THIS
IS AMERICAN POLICY, THIS ROLLS
BACK ACTUAL PROGRESS.
ALTHOUGH
SIGNIFICANTLY, BECAUSE IT'S
TRUMP, IT'S MOSTLY A LIE.
FIRST
OF ALL WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT
INVESTMENTS AND MAKE SURE THEY
GO TO THE PEOPLE?
THAT MEANS WE
WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW
INVESTMENTS, BECAUSE ALL THEY
HAVE TO DO IS SAY IT WILL GO TO
THE PEOPLE.
CRUISE LINES,
AIRLINES, NOT AFFECTED BY THIS,
BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY SET UP.
THEY AREN'T GOING TO MAKE THEM
-- IT WON'T -- BE
CUBAN-AMERICANS GETTING TO GO
BACK AND FORTH AND WE ALREADY
KNOW FROM THE CUBAN AMERICAN
NATIONAL FOUNDATION AND ONE
CUBAN-AMERICAN LAWMAKER, HE SAID
THE POLICY WON'T BE ANYTHING
NEW, IT'S PRETTY WEAK AND THERE
WILL BE MANY IN MIAMI WHO DON'T
THINK IT WENT FAR ENOUGH.
BUT HE
HAD TO START A SPEECH, I AM
ENDING THE OBAMA -- YOU DIDN'T,
YOU ENDED ABOUT 21% OF IT.
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO, BECAUSE
IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
AND I'M
SURE EVERYONE ELSE, ESPECIALLY
THE FEW PROFESSIONALS IN THE
STATE DEPARTMENT WHO HAVE ANY
POWER NOW, ARE LIKE, NO, THIS IS
A TERRIBLE IDEA.
AND THE OBAMA
POLICY WAS MARGINAL, AND
SIGNIFICANTLY HAVANA'S EMBASSY
IN WASHINGTON AND OURS IN
HAVANA, THEY STAYED.
IF YOU WANT TO ROLL BACK THE
POLICY YOU SHUT DOWN THE EMCEES.
IT'S ALL PANDERING.
AND IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO GET US
TO STOP TALKING ABOUT THE
OTHER STUFF.
HE'S TRYING TO APPEAL TO A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE CUBAN
POPULATION IN FLORIDA THAT'S
VERY CONSERVATIVE, AND THAT HOLD
A GRUDGE FROM THE CASTROS.
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.
DONALD TRUMP CAN TALK ALL HE
WANTS -- HILTON HOTELS, CASINO
GAMBLING COMPANIES, CRUISE
SHIPS, AIRLINES, THEY ARE
LOOKING AT HIM LIKE, WOULD YOU
SHUT UP?
WE ARE DIVIDING UP CUBA
TO SEE HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE
THE MONEY, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO
GET IN THE WAY OF THIS.
DONALD
TRUMP CARES ABOUT PRISONERS
BECAUSE HE COULD BECOME ONE ON
ANY DAY.
HE'S LIKE, WE'VE GOT TO
MAKE SURE WE ARE NICE TO
PRISONERS BECAUSE I COULD END
UP IN THERE WITH THEM.
ANOTHER
THING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CUBA
AND COMMUNISM -- ALL IT WILL
TAKE IS A PHONE CALL FROM PUTIN.
HEY, DID I TELL YOU TO DO THAT?
THEN HE WOULD SAY, I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOT JUST PANDERING, THIS
ADMINISTRATION -- IT WAS THE
SAME THING WITH COMEY, WHEN THE
INITIAL STORY CAME OUT, THEY
WERE PROTECTING HILLARY'S --
THEY AREN'T EVEN BOTHERING TO
TRY TO LIE ANYMORE.
THAT USED TO
BE MORE CREATIVE AND PUT EFFORT
INTO IT.
HE'S A SLOPPY LIAR.
THIS ISN'T EVEN A GOOD TRY.
LIKE YOU SAID, BEN, THE MOMENT
HE SAID WE ARE STILL GOING TO
ALLOW THE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE
ALL THE CORPORATIONS SAID YOU
BETTER BELIEVE WE WILL ALLOW THE
INVESTMENTS --
MARRIOTT ALREADY HAS A HOTEL
THERE, THAT'S UNAFFECTED.
AND CUBA USED TO BE THE SPOT.
CUBA USED TO BE THE HOTSPOT TO
GO TO GAMBLE, HANG OUT, AND THEY
WANT TO BUILD THAT AGAIN.
OF COURSE THEY DO.
THE
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS
WANTED TO DICTATE WHAT GOES ON
IN CUBA.
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
WE ALLOWED AMNESTY FOR CUBANS
WAS BECAUSE THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT WAS HUFFING AND
PUFFING THAT THEY DIDN'T GET TO
HAVE BATISTA EMPOWER ANYMORE OR
HAVE A SAY OVER WHO WAS IN
CHARGE IN CUBA ANYMORE.
AND THE
WHOLE CUBAN AMNESTY THING, THINK
ABOUT THE DOUBLE STANDARD THERE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU COME
FROM A COUNTRY LIKE MEXICO WHERE
YOU ARE ALSO BEING PERSECUTED,
OR COMING FROM SYRIA WHERE THERE
IS EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT
TARGETING INNOCENT CIVILIANS
INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN --
DOESN'T MATTER, CUBANS GET
AMNESTY BECAUSE WE HAD
COMMUNISM.
BUT EVERYONE ELSE
BEING PERSECUTED AND WHOSE LIVES
ARE AT RISK DOESN'T MATTER.
BY
THE WAY, I LOVE CUBANS, THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH I DON'T LIKE
CUBANS AND THEY SHOULDN'T GET
AMNESTY, I'M JUST SAYING THE
DOUBLE STANDARD WAS RIDICULOUS
AND THE REASON IT WAS PUT IN
PLACE IS BECAUSE THE UNITED
STATES WANTED TO DICTATE WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN THAT
COUNTRY, AND THAT'S IT.
BATISTA WAS A TERRIBLE GUY.
THAT SAID, I WENT TO CUBA IN
1998, MY DAD WROTE A BOOK ABOUT
CASTRO, HE WAS THERE FOR A LONG
TIME AND THOUGHT WE
MISREPRESENTED CASTRO IN MANY
WAYS -- THAT SAID, HE'S A
COMMUNIST DICTATOR.
YOU WALK
AROUND AND ON THE STREET CORNERS
IN 1998 AND 99 WHEN I WENT,
THERE WERE GUYS WITH BERETS AND
MILITARY UNIFORMS HOLDING
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
I COULD
DO WHATEVER I WANT, I'M A
FOREIGNER -- I COULD STAY IN THE
NICEST HOTELS, I CAN GO OUT TO
BARS AND DRINK, THEY DON'T CARE.
THEY ARE WATCHING THEIR OWN
PEOPLE.
IT WAS SPOOKY.
BUT THEY
ARE 90 MILES FROM HERE, FROM THE
UNITED STATES, AND OBVIOUSLY
THIS IS A COUNTRY -- IF YOU
THINK WE ARE A POWER, THIS IS IN
OUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE, WE
SHOULD TRY TO EXACT SOME
INFLUENCE.
THAT'S WHAT THIS
POLICY WOULD HAVE DONE AFTER 57
YEARS OF THE DUMBEST, MOST
INEFFECTIVE POLICY.
IF IT
WORKED, IF THE EMBARGO HAD
WORKED AND IN 19 CITY SEVEN CUBA
WAS LIKE, WE CAN'T DO IT WITH
THE SOVIETS, WE ARE COMING
ABOARD, WE ARE SWITCHING -- BUT
IT DIDN'T EVEN WORK AFTER THE
SOVIETS FELL.
WE WERE TOO DUMB
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FALL OF
COMMUNISM.
THE WHOLE COUNTRY
DESPERATELY NEEDS A COAT OF
PAINT, IT GOT PAINTED IN 1959
AND NEVER AGAIN, THE PEOPLE WHO
SHOULD BE DYING TO GET IN OUR
SHERWIN-WILLIAMS.
THEY COULD
MAKE MILLIONS THERE.
THE CASINO BUSINESS WANTS TO
GO IN, AND IF THERE IS ONE
BUSINESS THAT WON'T BE BOTHERED
WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT'S THE
CASINO BUSINESS.
WE GAVE YOU A
CHANCE --
HOW DID YOU MESS THAT UP?
