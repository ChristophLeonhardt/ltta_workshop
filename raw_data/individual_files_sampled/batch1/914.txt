okay okay Honolulu I so lowly has just uh a microphone Oh Victor this is one a seventeen year old teenager who migrated from El Salvador in 2014 he's undocumented and afraid to show his face he agreed to speak with us only if we protected his identity so we've changed his name Quinta May porque si por que tavini Salvador cuando tavini porque yah yah yah yah yah yah we will not dinero until the entire eco mechanical dysuria Darwin in the pas de quoi de la fonda up a little hippo as that one is an unaccompanied minor a term given for kids who have crossed the US border alone hundreds of thousands of these minors have fled Central America in recent years to escape gang violence mm-hmm kids like Warren have been allowed to apply for asylum and other protections to remain in the US but in the last year their stories have been used to advance a political agenda by the President of the United States I have a simple message today for every gang member and criminal alien that are threatening so violently our people we will find you we will arrest you we will jail you and we will deport you it would accuse teens like one of being the very same gang members they were fleeing well know anything here Salvador to Sevilla que aqui time being a VM pandyas amazing no I know you from Medina por que supuestamente king of e ni upon D became a tranquilo porque differente meant in the game can you a personalized upon d eq latina mia do i use si puedo creer en mi casa y cap well I say tinning fault lines traveled to Long Island New York to examine how the Trump administration is using the fear of one gang to crack down on entire immigrant communities you this is a neighborhood park in Central Islip a town largely made up of immigrants 80 kilometers east of New York City almost a year ago this town would wake up to a tragic scene this is where in April 2017 for Latino teenagers were murdered by ms-13 they were reportedly lured into the woods and that's when they were attacked by the gang and killed a tional and local media would raise the alarm on what was happening here just seven months earlier two teen girls were found dead in the nearby town of Brentwood also victims of ms-13 the murders were brutal their bodies found disfigured creating real fear about the threat of gang violence here ms-13 is a gang that started in Los Angeles in the 1980s that today has a presence in Central America and several cities around the u.s. but it remains a relatively small presence here on Long Island in Suffolk County it's four hundred members according to police out of 1.5 million residents despite that shortly after the murders Donald Trump came here promising to liberate Long Island from ms-13 they have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful quiet neighborhoods into blood-stained killing fields their animals it was one of many speeches from the White House warning Americans about ms-13 here tonight our two fathers and two mothers and in January 2018 he invited the grieving families to be his guests for the State of the Union address these two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown he would use these murders to call for stricter immigration laws linking the violence to a wave of unaccompanied minors crossing the border in recent years many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal unaccompanied alien minors I mean clearly clearly the crimes that were committed in Suffolk County the individuals responsible for those atrocities should be brought to justice but you don't blanket an entire community and project this issue onto every young person tying it into immigration status and the unaccompanied minors you don't talk about those things in tandem in reality only a tiny fraction of these miners have been linked to ms-13 the u.s. Border Patrol says it's identified 56 suspected gang members out of more than 240,000 that arrived in the u.s. since 2012 but Trump's rhetoric resonated here in Suffolk County Long Island we just seen a surge in unaccompanied minors he tapped into a rising animosity towards immigrants paving the way for a government crackdown there was a an opening for people particularly law enforcement to begin to sway to the more conservative sentiment in the country and in the county to begin vilifying immigrants and put law enforcement as a savior we've arrested numerous individuals Suffolk County Police Commissioner Timothy Seanie seized the moment using tough talk in the media for his fight against ms-13 if you're an ms-13 gang member take a look behind me for every person here is 10 more and we are coming for you local and federal authorities would begin a joint law enforcement effort to arrest and deport ms-13 gang members this included working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice we started hearing kids report that so-and-so had been picked up and his parents didn't even know right like kids were just literally being disappeared over the summer there was like a three week period where we saw at least one parent walk into our office almost every day saying my son or my husband disappeared honestly what I was hearing sounded so far-fetched that I thought they were highs but lo and behold it was true young undocumented immigrants were heavily targeted in the operations in some cases police would make arrests for minor violations and then hand them over to ice Warren was sought last May for a small traffic violation when police asked he says he gave them his middle name the name he usually goes by yeah I put me you know given of all scientifically possible doses Yoshinoya made one of me Hyun ki k para ver difficulty mi nombre tak you are Maya I love you Gina lovely she is present of a lazy he was arrested for false impersonation a charge that was later dropped but he would spend hours being questioned about gangs Olivia came upon the area kono kimochi and I kept on dearly he enters a mansion Kannamma ke and can I take here a loop in the year records say that one admitted to being a gang member which he denies he'd been arrested before for carrying a pocket knife but the charges were dropped Lucchese application at among Apple are this year okay look up ian and ii really hit me assuming upon me the motto attacked across the meadow you kind of personal ugly police claimed he was part of an ongoing murder investigation and handed him over to ice he was taken to a high-security juvenile detention center several hours away from his home Veronica okay hey Solon say Rahul openness Allen even element in this millennia of novels ornament in solar sera Juan was among dozens of unaccompanied minors detained here on Long Island some of them would become part of a class action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union Paige Austin was one of the attorneys that worked on the lawsuit they were disappearing into the immigration detention system and it often took parents days or weeks to even figure out where they were much less to get them released and brought back home the minors were detained for months without a court hearing and then the second thing that was very disturbing was the lack of evidence to support the allegations that the government was making many of the symbols are the items that the government claims are signs of gang affiliation are in fact religious symbols or their signs of cultural pride the lawsuit forced the government to bring the minors in front of a judge who ruled there wasn't enough evidence to keep most of them to paint if they were suspected of committing a crime the police would arrest them and they would be in criminal custody the fact that they're in immigration custody means that local authorities were looking for some other way to detain them in the absence of any evidence of wrongdoing in late 2017 a judge ordered one's release saying there wasn't enough evidence to tie him to ms-13 it was almost six months after he was arrested in 99 he came across a hard in eyes even the piensa in his order himoto CNT marmatan into critical todav√≠a se todo lo que pase no creo que no homeopathic though okay we're with Felix he's undocumented and has asked us to protect his identity he says he fled El Salvador to escape death threats from ms-13 I was 14 when I decided to live a solid 14 I was 14 what was it like when you arrived I was happy I almost cried I was happy to be in a new country I was happy to see all this what I didn't know was coming for many young people like Felix who arrived here the reality is bleak they're likely to live in poor neighborhoods where schools have limited resources and don't have the means to help undocumented kids the first day at school was certain that get somebody else from not even from the contouring like CUDA speak Spanish huh who took me with them and said you know what I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna show you where you had to go they don't they don't care I did it Oh another you just coming and it's at these very schools where gangs have made their mark it wasn't until Felix arrived four years ago that he realized ms-13 was also here do you know anybody in a gang oh you do Felix says the gangs in El Salvador are brutal and often the only way to survive is to join them he says kids get pulled in the gangs here because they need the support during the spawn tree you know you had to pay rent you have to pay insurance car or whatever you had to pay you have and no feel to be worried about it and then if you can with the parent you para doesn't pay attention to you because they worry how to support their family if we fail to provide support networks for our kids they're gonna find their own support networks and unfortunately in impoverished communities gangs are the biggest support network there are said here to get that founded a local gang prevention program he says tougher law enforcement isn't the answer how do you declare a war on these communities when you've never attempted to enact peace when you've never come in and said here's an after school program or here's some additional social workers or here is you know and after school place where you could go hang out and and learn and and and and be a kid now kids can be labeled gang members in school giving teams like Felix more reason to be fearful things like the color blue flags from El Salvador and Honduras or certain country codes have been used to suggest gang affiliation so you won't wear a blue shirt because your concern you could get picked up by the police yeah wouldn't rush you're not even my Cortez no not shorts but how does it make you feel than to live with that fear that even just wearing some kind of color or some kind of shoes that you could get picked up and detained oh just like the it feels like we have an El Salvador now I feel like safe because I know there is nobody who's actually going to pointing my head with that calm I'm not going to know what he's gonna kill me but I out the same time I won't say because the police is going to call me for something for no reason do you are you afraid of ice of course what's your fear I have the food when they do go hungover out to my home are they gonna know that all right you're gonna ask for me or for somebody else and then we're gonna go back to Salvador that's my fear this mother would go through something similar last year to do a seder trabajo y Vita Culloden yang portulaca si yo ten√≠a nada para de la casa y seguir a lo la Patrona pasa Hey Yadier Oh take a cell opinion Kor we met as morel de in February 2018 she's asked us to hide her identity que paso de ESO no se yo Sarajevo yo no dicen yeah donde tu lugar on em choppiness over there come a los tres dias que Ella ten√≠a hi I'm Virginia her son who's legal aliases LVM was released by the government just days before we met her she didn't want us to speak to him out of fear for his safety now LVM had in april of 2017 been suspended from bellport high school for extending his middle fingers at another student the school allege that that was a gang sign and they suspended him his case would illuminate an alarming pattern students being suspended for alleged gang behavior in school were being picked up by ice shortly after bellport high school did not respond to a request for comment but attorneys believe this information and somehow getting to ice possibly through local police who often have officers in schools this says that he had self admitted to being a gang member it also says that he had gang tattoos and that he has been identified as a gang member by the Suffolk County police gang unit and he doesn't have gang tattoos and he never self admitted to being in a gang he's never admitted to being in a gang and he's never had any contact with the Suffolk County Police Department he also does not have a single tattoo anywhere on his body the immigration judge to whom this evidence was presented rejected these allegations and concluded that he did not pose any danger and yet he remain detained LVM is part of a new class-action lawsuit challenging the government's prolonged detention of immigrant youth Esmeralda would wait almost eight months to be reunited with her son a cuando voy a hablar con el que que lo que te dijo como esta que estaba bien man toda raba SE kalamos el siempre around you're wasted metal cover sir my love were tailors he okay general her pussy receipt for chaos a vehicle save upon our mom I'll see you may put in your euro we made multiple efforts to speak to ice but they declined our request for an interview in a statement the agency told us they specifically use immigration violations as a means to target ms-13 gang members and remove them as a threat we also reached out to several school districts whose students have been caught up in the crackdown none of them would speak to us but Timothy Seany the former police commissioner who's now a district attorney agreed to an interview he's a Democrat who's been criticized for working closely with ice under the Trump administration since September of 2016 we've made over 320 ms-13 arrests of over 220 individuals they're all gang members yes they're confirmed Gamemakers gang members but keep in mind whether they're gang members or not these are criminal arrests that we have to then go to court open court improve criminal charges against in the instance where we have reliable credible intelligence that someone is an ms-13 gang member and they're in our country illegally we will and we're not in a position to bring a significant state charge or bring a federal RICO charge we'll work with the Department of Homeland Security to detain them and for a Department of Homeland Security to commence removal proceedings against them Seanie says the cases they refer to ice are based on credible intelligence but the cases we've seen suggest otherwise the label here is you're an ms-13 member if you're Central American or Latino unless you can prove otherwise and the kid is like wait a second I'm being treated as a gang member by the school I go to I'm not a gang member I'm being treated like a gang member by the authorities I'm being treated now because of all these questions etc etc rival gang members might even be looking at me and asking and questioning whether or not I am a part of that gang and so I might as well join that gang right now if they see that you're working with Department of Homeland Security can you see how that would also erode their trust it's very important that folks in the community know that we are not targeting undocumented residents rather we're targeting gang members and we will provide protections to folks who have no immigration status whatsoever if they interact with law enforcement to provide information and and we're not going to not work with our federal law enforcement partners to target ms-13 to ask us other to ask us to do otherwise is reckless whatever the motive the crackdown on ms-13 by local and federal authorities has left little comfort in these communities what do you envision for your future here to be honest I don't know I'm afraid to think about it I might be here speaking to you today and I don't know if I weren't gonna be tomorrow I might be this I might be my country I might be working I might be somewhere else I don't know air another future and I get scared for those that were detained the experience hangs over them and these gang allegations while not proven could still hurt their chances for immigration protection center mekomo come us-ally Alec I go to put my uncle who was image in the center you know gentle memo communica moment easily Remington for one LVM and others who've been released by the government there's no relief from the fear of being taken again and forced back to a country they were trying to escape hostess avec de esto de facto mucho el como por que sera sera que bueno como se sus hijos como a ceramic a Cerritos a here elsevier como de primero to solace oh yeah I'll go solo por que tiran me okay the same see kind of ailment in the community but I'm gonna go out and look at behind Peter
