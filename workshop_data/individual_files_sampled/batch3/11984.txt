the u.s. is on high alert over a growing number of foreign ISIL fighters captured in Syria as part of a major combat action which is caused now over Washington urged its allies particularly Britain to pay more attention to citizens who have fled Europe to join the terrorist organization so out of the UK defense secretary said they should not be allowed to return home I don't think they should ever set foot in this country again they turned their back on Britain our values and everything we stand for they are the worst of the worst we're working with the Coalition on foreign fighter detainees and generally expect these detainees to return to their country of origin for disposition another British official suggested ironically that extreme measures should be taken several months ago this warnings began for a long time the Minister for international development said the only way to deal with returning fighters was you may recall to kill them he said for now ISIL fighters of UK origin return home of facing prison sentences France initiated a program for its part to try to deer adelies jihadis it's not been that successful it seems to have failed Paris has now also turned to sentencing militants as well meantime in Germany education and D radicalization programs are still in operation but those coming back are also facing trial and jail time it's a big problem what to do russiatooz got to face this in Russia the most dangerous former jihadists are imprisoned though in the past number did join D radicalization programs they've no clothes so it seems Tom time again country to country that kind of thing just doesn't work one controversial case has come to light in Russia one former ISIL fighters is that he escaped the terror group and turned himself into the Russian security services he then faced trial in Russia but was later released now the court explained that he was never involved in combat and also cooperated with the investigation after admitting his guilt this he's been given some leniency we managed to speak with him about his time in Syria I got interested and started reading forums and watching video online I was given a phone number of a person who could help me get to Syria he assured me that those who came could leave at any time and no one would be kept there but they immediately took away our documents and telephones it was a shock for me I felt helpless everything was different from what they told me okay whether under if you like false pretenses do you believe him do you not let's discuss this issue no answers winners political and social commentator and also Stephen Morrison English Democrats party hi guys thanks for your time this is a controversial subject this warning that these guys were going to come back at some point highly-trained some of them as well has been in the offing for years now hasn't it MOTU you first where'd you see it you know what do you do these people when they come back do you try and deer adelies them we sing time and time again that doesn't seem to work or do you throw them in jail for the rest of their lives it's it is a tough question it is a controversial question there are always going to be those that say these people have shunned Western democratic values the rules of law in this country and when those people have gone out there they committed heinous acts of terror at the same time we know that that is a more granular picture because some of the people who went out to Syria to Iraq to fight when out therei on humanitarian grounds who got sucked into the conflicts some went out of spouses some wealth children have been born out there some then change sides and end up ended up trapped out there so the difficulty we have is and that's what a lot of the Western countries I mean including countries like Indonesia and others there are hundreds of foreign fighters who have been captured by the Syrian democratic forces out there that are being held at the minute now initially Britain said we're going to make them stateless remove their passports not going to allow them re-entry other countries then said let's take a more enlightened approach some of the Nordic nations said let's try to repatriate them have characterization programs which in part have actually been quite successful in some areas at the same time then the US has now taken the lead and the US Secretary of Defense said foreign countries need to repatriate their own citizens yeah and deal with them using the rule of law the British plan if you take these guys passports away of their British citizens where were they're supposed to go ie not on our back doorstep mate well yeah well yeah I mean it's the ultimate form of NIMBYism which is the idea that we have foreign fighters some of them that there are some quite dark stories about interests in the West and in Syria that have helped these fighters get out there like the bethnal green schoolgirls that yeah the ISIS brides who are only 16 and we couldn't figure out how they go out there you know there are lots of different stories about what happens to these people if we make them stateless ostensibly they will stay out there they will keep breeding extremism terrorism and radicalization and they'll keep killing and they'll keep hating us so we have it's a problem have to deal with you can't hide from it but I feel there's not much sympathy for them from Stephen Morris Stephen no what would you like to see - let's talk about the British British passport holders first of all that have gone out there most saying some of the winner there with their families someone that went out there maybe they were brainwashed but I mean I suppose the argument is well how'd you know you weren't going to out there and go out there and fight end of the day if you're gonna join Isis what do you think should be done here practically well classically they shouldn't be allowed back here if they've committed crimes abroad then they should be dealt with abroad if the committed crimes in Syria they should be dealt with by the Syrian authorities or which authoritative Syria that's the problem is they should not come back here they should not come back here it's as simple as that because they've committed the crimes abroad so why should the taxpayer Fitz fought the bill for all this rehabilitation and all this thought and then probably they're in jail for quite a while that costs more money when these crimes have been committed abroad let the authorities deal with them under the rule of law in their days because they've got a British passport I suppose they're coming back home no the fat says just does that mean that I after a my laws apply to every country I go to know if you go to another country you obey their laws you break their laws you have to abide by their justice system and whatever punishment comes down you cannot fall back on this British passport say oh I committed atrocities abroad but I'll throw my British passport into the mix so I get sent back home oh no and what if the Situationist is or whatever abroad what if the the the jurisdiction the situation there the legal system in these countries is so sure they're not able to be dealt with take Syria take Iraq well there is a sympathy is the Syrian government there there is a Syrian come did the issue being there is that the Syrian government is not a friend they're not in the word olive half western supporting yeah the the West is supporting the the opposition now tours each whichever side gets them they're the one to deal with them did not our issue they've gone there to fight they've gone there to meet crying there they're not part of an armed force and not part of the peacekeeping force they've gone there as armed civilians to cause to cause havoc and to kill people they get caught they dealt with over there they do not come back here with girls so can i interject with just two two matters if that's okay absolutely if I can just interject with two matter target the first issue this firstly to say that the West has been supporting the opposition isn't strictly true because the British Parliament took the vote not too long ago to support President Assad with airstrikes in Syria to bomb Isis and opposition fighters so to say that we have a clear policy of supporting the opposition isn't right the Assad family have been allies to the West Assad kept met met with no no but met with I'm just saying in terms of national policy foreign policy Assad came here met with Blair met with the Queen they have him and his father were both pro West pro-democracy secularist interests in that country and the second point of order is this which is how do we know people have committed crimes without putting the evidence in front of them and putting them on trial just assuming people went out there so I'm in London regularly on trial here because regularly caught the first the first Brit to lose his life in Syria was a young lad from Portsmouth who was a street preacher he saw Assad committing heinous acts of genocide and war crimes and just brutalizing people and murdering citizens and civilians he'd murdered I think 20 or 30 thousand people by the time this young giant trying to show a different direction to the other side this guy went out there as a chef and he ended up getting embroiled in the confidence out there let me let me go to you regional point five okay some of the north and north african states were actually more pro-western than the towards the edge of all that labor went in and overthrew him and the actual people had to go and gone off a little bit the people that the West put in place now Assad the issue with this ad was it's like the phrase your enemies my enemy we all sleep we were there to go against ISIL back yet simple do you have another option others Stephen that other than saying these guys should not come back in is there any other practical way with your practical hats on you could see well okay if they do have to come back in here which that is the way it's gonna happen at the moment they have to be dealt with somehow can you see any other way other than saying no you're barred well there is a way but obviously the the UN is so weak it's laughable and the EU again is so weak they're just non-existent they should have had buffer zones there they should have had the UN peacekeeping force is making safe areas and so we could properly categorize these people rather than so okay these people going in to fight for whichever side these people fight any of Kurdish dissent against ISIL but now because they fighting for the Kurds the being classed as terrorists here it becomes a ridiculous situation the United Nations peacekeeping force should have been in there earlier the EU should have been annexed on the border of Turkey we should have had a peace and buffer zone there where the nations and people who were at British passports could have go to a safe haven left now these people have been fought these people have been caught fire I see all right Steve we got to leave it down afraid my friend we've we've got we're over time we're about to fall off the air Mohan said political and social commentators Stephen Morris English Democrats party Northwest Chairman thank you for your time
