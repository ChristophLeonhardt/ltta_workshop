hi I'm firming okay and I'm Malika Bilal and you're in the stream live on al-jazeera and youtube today Nicaragua anti-government demonstrations have turned into the country's deadliest protests since the 1980s well look at the continued violence and ask whether human rights are being protected in the two months since money Nicaraguans began calling for President Daniel Ortega to step down parts of the country have descended into heavy violence while peace talks have yielded a little progress for an end to the crisis protests began in April in response to a proposed overhaul of the country's pension system grievances quickly turned to Ortega himself as the people accused him of running a corrupt government some anti-government protesters armed with their own homemade weapons have clashed with police and pro Ortega paramilitary groups more than 200 people have been killed since April and despite the government's pledge to stop the violence human rights groups say protesters continue to be killed detained or even disappeared so to help us understand the situation in Nicaragua joining us on the set we have Latin America correspondent Manuel Arevalo he was covering the crisis in Nicaragua last week for al Jazeera in Managua Camilo the Castro he is a human rights activist and a journalist in Esteli in Nicaragua Steven Sefton he's a writer for tortilla consul that's a news site that identifies with the Sandinista National Liberation Front and we also have one sebastian tomorrow he's a leader of the main Civic Alliance looking to negotiate peace with the government we also invited members of the Nicaraguan government to share their perspectives but they have not responded to us but gentlemen it's good to have you here Steven this idea of trying to get a government response or trying to get an idea of how the government is dealing with this crisis how would you solve it out from your perspective well right from the start on April 21st about three days after the protests which were perfectly legitimate for the first 24 hours they were peaceful as as was correctly reported in the mainstream media but um after that they were taken over by extremely violent right-wing activists who are very well armed and very well prepared but despite the the violence of those first three days President Daniel Ortega on April 21st called for a national dialogue which was accepted by the right-wing business sector that was also involved in protests and then the following day Sunday April 22nd President Ortega requested the catholic church hierarchy to mediate the dialogue so right from the start the dialogue has been committed to fees and from april 23rd they instructed the police not to use live rounds and to keep a very low profile so I think the from my point of view the role of the government has been from the start to try and negotiate a peaceful solution to the crisis and unfortunately my feeling is that the opposition have been resolutely opposed to taking let me share this of you this is online from a nun who's also journalist and she summarizes this is a I'm using the translation here from Twitter a summary of the current situation in Nicaragua although from during the 21st to today they're already more dead injured imprisoned and disappeared 212 killed 1337 wounded 507 plus in prison so many issues here or one Sebastian Stephen says that the government is trying to negotiate in good faith but how do you describe this this listen that it's not even the latest list of what's been happening to some of the protesters in Nicaragua today I would like to denounce the brutality of the Ortega dictatorship brutality that I have seen with my own eyes this violence and brutality against innocent civilians is the reason why the popular uprising is not going to stop and this is not popular this is a popular uprising not arising from any political movement or anything like that and I want to emphasize one thing the killing the extrajudicial killing started April 19th it is not true that the elitsa occur later the extrajudicial killings I started the very first day of the revolt of the protest right now as we speak there has been 285 people dead this has been denounced by human rights organizations one of them is precisely the inter-american Convention on Human Rights which says that the responsibility of the state of Nicaragua the state of Nicaragua to who have violated fundamental rights including life personal integrity health freedom assembly expression and access to justice this is a the most important and relevant Human Rights Commission by the Organization of American States and have issue a very strong report blaming the State of Nicaragua as responsible for all these killings so the in in addition to that Amnesty International issue a report that says in the title here should to kill showing ample evidence of the extra judiciary killings committed by the Nicaraguan police force and thugs has been armed also by the government there is ample evidence of all these human rights violations so in other words we are at this moment living under an extraordinary circumstances of of a humanitarian crisis I want Sebastian I want to follow up and there was extraordinary circumstances that the list really that you detailed with a couple of experiences from our community about what they are seeing this is one person on Twitter who says we still don't know how many are detained or just missing or if they're still alive then there murrs grow every day we have 212 plus dead including little kids and just this weekend they shot a 15 month old in the head that was a sniper and it was caught on camera and we got a video comment from someone who mentions that same incident and and how it struck her this is deny she's a journalist in managua and this is what she told this dream one of the cases that affected me the most was the case of a 15 month old kid who died by a bullet wound in his head he was walking with his parents on the streets where when they apparently were attacked by paramilitaries or police and the baby died I think every new Carell one wants to see justice not only for this that but for the more than 200 deaths that have occurred in these two months so many the the incident done she mentions I pulled up on my screen here this is from Al Jazeera Nicaragua Andres baby among the five killed in fresh protests that's from June 24th it doesn't seem to gel with what we heard earlier from Stephen who mentioned that the police were told to keep a low profile I know that you just returned from Nicaragua but can you make sense of those two things for us sure so I made two trips within the last couple of months to Nicaragua one to visiting Messiah which were a lot of the most brutal fighting has been concentrated between anti-government demonstrators in the government and also most of my time spent and by now well the incident that you that we're learning about right now is not that different than another one that we heard about a week and a half ago where a house with the family of six was set on fire and two children of the age of two were killed inside that house the government has repeatedly denied any responsibility in both that incident as well as in the ongoing conflict saying that they're not using live rounds that they're not do you know participating in these claims of human rights abuse but the evidence compiled by human rights observers both from Amnesty International from the inter-american Human Rights Commission which prepared preliminary reports of the Organization of American States just last weekend I'll point to something completely different which is an ongoing systematic repression against peaceful demonstrators in Nicaragua and one of the conditions set by the Catholic Church Catholic Church is very influential in the they've been hosting this ongoing national dialogue that for better for wusses is is the only thing that's truly mediating this conflict the main condition of the Catholic Church for this dialogue to continue has been for the government of president Ortega to stop the heavy-handed to use the light term approach to anti-government demonstrators something that the government has failed to do which is why we've seen a continuation of the violence which is why we see very little progress being made in way of these peace talks Steven when one sebastian was showing the shoot-to-kill poster you said something and I didn't quite hear what it was can you repeat it what did you want to say yeah and what I want to say is that I'm the it's true that there are plenty of human rights organizations making these denunciations but none of those cases have been investigated and the the internationally in Tamara can Commission for Human Rights made their report based on information that they just accepted at face value from human rights organizations in Nicaragua that have a long track record over a couple of decades of being vicious anti-government opponents and a lot of a lot of the those cases are as you you're your reporter pointed out mainly pointed out disputed by the government now something Manny said that was very interesting was he talked about peaceful protesters now I have a question for Manny Manny could you please explain how it is that as a result of peaceful protests ten police officers have been killed and over 200 have been injured answer that question I'm not saying that there are not elements of criminal organizations that have infiltrated the the peaceful protests but overwhelmingly from my experience from my observation the people that are on the ground there are armed with slingshots are armed with rocks and they are our if you want to say that rocks are weapons sure they are armed and they're armed with homemade mortars which may be a less than lethal weapon I think that at the very best they are their fireworks launchers and these people are up against automatic weapons live rounds and snipers on Mother's Day on May 30th we were on the ground during one of the largest demonstrations that Nicaragua had seen up until that point half a million people marching on the streets of Managua at the very end of that march I actually don't remember how many were killed somewhere around a dozen people were killed when snipers opened fire on a crowd of civilians I want to point to the initial comment by Steven regarding the nature of the protest to talk about the origin of all this it is regretful that he the Nicaraguan government for years has labeled everybody who disagrees with and as extreme right-wing as part of an extreme right-wing conspiracy if you are on the streets to talk to people and see who's out there on the barricades in the universities who is protesting we're talking about people who are workers or students who are you know people generally concerned about what is happening in the country and this has been part of a pattern over the over the years that this government has been in power you know disqualifying people who have a different opinion and this is what it's definitely this is what is led to the situation because there's been a breakdown in the institutional framework that allows people to actually voice their opinion in a peaceful you know in a sit-in in voice their opinion and be heard and so what you have is a protest over a very you know a very legitimate issue with social security which was which could have gone on and ended without a problem but it didn't happen because the students who were on the street were immediately attacked and people reacted to that and they reacted to that because this has been going on for many many years and now it's escalated to the point where we have these you know hooded thugs on the street followed by the police going around killing people and this has been widely documented this is probably the most well documented rebellion in the history of Central America because everybody has cell phones everybody has homes that everybody has everybody has you know a gang of between five and six hundred people attacked um the the municipal office here in estelí they attacked it with Molotov cocktails with firearms and it's completely untrue even a lot of people are government followers it's been widely proven already that those people who attack that place including you know if you talk to the families of people who were killed during that you know we've been killed in Esteli i think you know you should go talk to those families students i knew one of the students that was killed and that individual orlando who's a great gun unfortunately was duped into taking part into that demonstration which involved the participation over between two and three hundred people from outside Managua who had nothing to do with esteli and they they did this group of between five and six hundred people I was here and and try to burn I think people are risking their lives because they they're being duped people are risking their lives because they believe in that in in Liberty because people are tired of the government running over there right I hear what you're saying about people being tired of their rights being really Stram papon I want to bring up a perspective that we don't see a whole lot of online I'll admit it was very difficult to find people who are pro Ortega at this point at least on Twitter during our outreach but we got this question from someone on Twitter saying could or take a be there all these years without people's support so we did find one woman her name is Regina Sandoval and she since deleted her twitter account after speaking with us on this she says I'm a native of Nicaragua and I've been visiting my country for the past 15 years and in the last ten years I've only seen positive improvements of course with much more to accomplish however I've never seen repression of any kind the economy was booming and tourists were flooding Nicaragua of course she is now an expat but one Sebastian I'm wondering about the support what our take what is left of it what are the polls saying what are you hearing from people well first of all it is true that certain economic sectors like the in the Twitter the dimension where we're doing extremely well however because of this crisis the tourist industry is simply God a million people came last year to Nicaragua to visit and because of this repression by the government by the police are bringing the country to a halt and and I want to mention something that is very important when unless the international was in the country and saw in life how snipers were shooting at the demonstrations on Mother's Day this is not something that I report that was written from from outside people from anything that I should actually saw the repression so so you know it's a and I think the explanation of all this popular revolt across all sectors of the society you have to understand that all sectors of society has been protesting for different reasons the environment the violations of human rights the violations of the right to protest to assemble it has been this has been a very repressive government that try to situation that didn't exist in reality let me just play the new state steve and i here i just want to move things on just a little bit i hear you want to come back and we will come back to you Manny you did a whole series of reports you just got back from Nicaragua one of your reports was about families calling for the release of detainees and I want to be very frank here about what you saw and what you reported on I'm gonna play this a little bit of this story here one of the stories that you did for Al Jazeera have a listen these desperate mothers cry out to prison guards for the release of their children Maria Saldana has been camped outside these gates for more than a week her son wielded was arrested after attending an anti-government demonstration at one point she chained herself to the fence begging for her son's release my son is innocent his only crime was holding up the flag of my country I believe this is why they're keeping him here money I hear the back and forth between Camillo and Stephen about who was responsible who's responsible for the violence who's hurt who's not hurt but the feeling is we were in Nicaragua amongst different communities what was it like it's tension especially in places like Messiah and cities like Messiah cities that have seen an extraordinary amount of violence over the course of the last two months people must inevitably be having some sort of psychological trauma from all of this there are daily attacks by paramilitary forces that are coming in - that are coming into the town and firing indiscriminately at civilians yes there may be individuals who are armed but overwhelmingly what we're seeing from from anti-government demonstrators most of them being very young teenagers often times is that they're not is that they're not armed and if I can just say something in regards to that snippet of my report on the detainees as a quick update the the gentleman that I was reporting on his name was wheel the wheel it's al Dania he has since been released he was held for 8 days after he was picked up after a after a protest and he was he was released along with another half-dozen detainees that were that were picked up during protests that sadly but still good news was the only bit of good news that I was able to report in my time in Nicaragua because there's still an unknown number of forced disappearances where people didn't end up in jail they simply disappeared there there's no way to know when it would ended up happening to a lot of these protesters yeah well I want to push this forward just a little bit more because while we have so many tweets on the protest tactics one of the things that people want to know about is negotiations and is the way forward this is Toyota on Twitter who says the president's greatest weakness is the fact that he is no longer nicaragua's worshipped Savior social media has united all Nicaraguans even former or taken followers that's why this is working there is no political party this is the People's Movement but on the other side of that is someone who thinks that Ortega is the perfect person for negotiations and will lead the country towards peace this is Francisco we've subtitled his response to us in Spanish have a listen to what he told us to pick up where Evo and sand on a solution delicacies rebel in Islamic Maharashtra total Apertura balloon tire he compromised in calm moment of protectant a deceptively sovereign the annual international have pass of fear me telepathy can permit en de el acompañamiento in collaboration the organization democratization line bacterium de la muerte yourself pissing in pipe in president Ortega al qussair two separate no Kiran Rekha no Sarah even leader political profound and meant to confirm a pillow cannot pass in Nicaragua so Camilo Francisco there says that the president is advancing the solution to the crisis I know that you're indirectly involved in the negotiation in the dialogue what do you make up a comment I think that the president will show willingness to bring pissed Nicaraguan he orders the paramilitary groups followed by the police to leave the streets he is the one that has the power to disarm these groups and the reason why he's not doing that is because he knows that if know these groups give him certainly certain protection because you know he's the head of the army and the police and you know he's sending these paramilitary groups out there and he and the government says they have nothing to do with them because he doesn't want to take responsibility for what is happening and everybody knows that these groups are being coordinated by mayors my secretary call secretaries of the president party of my ex military people and have been recruited to be part of these groups and you know the probes are in the videos all these groups they move into the neighborhoods and behind them comes the police so you know somebody has to explain to me how groups that have nothing to do with the government move around with the police to try to open up roads and and and and you know take people prisoners and and and fire you know indiscriminately against innocent people killing them and they are nothing to do with the government and I want to just bring out something that Stephen was saying about the government and what it's done in the last years you know I've been critical as a human rights activist and as a journalist of all governments in Nicaragua there is always room for improvement there's an obviously there in the economic front and you could say in the government you know did some things that were that did help the poor but you know you can't do that and and get rid of you know essential rights like the right to elect your leaders the right to to express your opinion the right to protest you know here you have a call in the last few years about you know media has been concentrated I've got less than one minute left I just want student to be out of respond to you just very briefly Steven go ahead it's like through the looking-glass listening to one Sebastian and Camilla I mean it's kind of the reverse of the truth in my opinion but that'll turn out I mean the investigations will turn up the truth in months to come and the political process will happen on in the next elections I'm extremely confident that the frente Sandinista will win the next election do you do you think Stephen and I'm sorry in order to do you think the president Ortega is going to announce whether or not he is in favor of early elections that's gonna be party to the government's negotiating team um it's perfectly possible that they'll bring forward the elections and but whenever they hold I'm sure that the even sounds like a ripe conversation for a next episode of Nicaragua on the stream but for now wrapping up Mallika for now the protesters demands remain toyota says or take us immediate resignation police forces and government guerrillas to stop repressing the people and justice for the murder among other things that's all the time we have thank you for watching Malika and I will see you online always on the string the next time take you
