when workers signed up to help at a migrant center near Brussels they knew the challenges they could face but now there are grim allegations of abuse and violence as stuff come forward with their stories they have no respect for the volunteers they take drugs in the morning and some say they might attack the women working at the center as soon as something happens everything is done to protect the refugees they always have an excuse because of their difficult past many refugees insult and threatened the stuff but nobody says anything on condition of anonymity workers also complained to local media that a colleague was attacked with a chair leg when we reached out to police Brussels for clarification they confirmed they'd been called by the center but stopped short of giving any details yes indeed we have already intervened at this centre the response teams were called three times over the past week in situations like these there are issues either between migrants or between the migrants and the organization itself they do not respect the rules or that sort of thing and that sparked conflict the NGO running the facility insists they haven't received any complaints from the workers at the center and says it fulfills its mission well I've been working on the ground for three years now and I literally have never seen anyone attack a woman they're obviously mentally ill people who insult others then the tension rises etc but I have never heard any threats honestly I have no idea to where this sort of information could have come from our team is 80% women this Belgium case isn't an isolated one a volunteer group here in France that helped migrants claimed they had faced similar issues they oversaw the distribution of food go into makeshift refugee camp in Paris for some 20 months until one day they decided to quit things got too dangerous for those volunteering from the beginning our mission was to serve hot drinks and bread and we've done this for 20 months every day during the last month though we started questioning our mission as we don't want our volunteers to be put in danger they have nothing not even tents they sleep on the ground and sometimes woken up by the police early in the morning they kick them in used tear gas to move them so when they come to us they're stressed and nervous twice last week we had to stop serving food to let the tension calm down this is something new for us so yes we're stopping officially some 62,000 refugees have crossed the Mediterranean to arrive in Europe this year it's not quite the crisis number as of 2015 but the problem still exists and isn't going anywhere soon and with volunteers struggling to help or given up entirely an even greater burden will fall on the authorities as they struggle to get a handle on the issue Murray Finnish na RT you
