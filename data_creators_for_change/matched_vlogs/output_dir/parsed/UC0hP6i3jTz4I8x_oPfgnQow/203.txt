try American candy videos and I've been
upset so the guys are making penny first

don't think a bit like this oh my
favorite breakfast shailu

seeing this video so oh they're big they
don't look what I thought they were
gonna be small we all look like this

this at first it looks good but what it
gets like if you chew it a lot
it has this weird flavor I don't like it
Irie irate swedish fish like six out of
ten okay the next one is Reese's Pieces
and I'm not a fan of peanut butter so
this is again an actual really good I
read it eight out of ten the next one is

peanut butter but I give this a 10 out
of 10
