1
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:14,210
>> YOUR TESTIMONY IS, BOB

2
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,911
MUELLER DID NOT KICK YOU OFF

3
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:16,979
BECAUSE OF A CONTEXT OF YOUR

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,514
TEXT BUT SOME APPEARANCE HE WAS

5
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:20,483
WORRIED ABOUT?

6
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:21,851
>> UP MY TESTIMONY, WHAT YOU

7
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:23,519
ASKED HIM WHAT I RESPONDED TO

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,554
WAS, HE KICKED ME OFF BECAUSE OF

9
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:25,888
MY BIAS.

10
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:26,856
I'M STATING TO YOU THAT IT'S NOT

11
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:28,157
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HE KICKED

12
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:30,359
ME OFF BECAUSE OF ANY BIAS, IT

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,560
WAS DONE BECAUSE OF THE

14
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,128
APPEARANCE.

15
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:34,130
IF YOU'D LIKE TO REPRESENT WHAT

16
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:35,598
YOU SAID ACCURATELY, THEN I WILL

17
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,434
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I DON'T

18
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:39,702
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID BEING

19
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:44,240
APPRECIATE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND

20
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:49,278
HOW AN FBI INVESTIGATION.

21
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:50,513
AND IN ADDITION TO DISAPPOINTING

22
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:51,914
MY DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES, SOMEONE

23
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:55,351
WHO WAS INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN

24
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:56,852
COLLISION DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS

25
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,421
ANY THERE, THEY ARE, WHY WOULD

26
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:02,692
YOU BE CONCERNED, WHY WOULD YOU

27
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:05,861
NOT BE ECSTATIC THAT THERE WAS

28
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,363
NO COLLUSION WHY WOULD YOU NOT

29
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:07,797
BE CONCERNED?

30
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:09,532
>> Sean: THAT WAS MORE OF THE

31
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,167
FIREWORKS AT TODAY'S EXPLOSIVE

32
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,569
HOUSE HEARINGS WITH THE

33
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,603
DISGRACED FBI AGENT PETER

34
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:15,137
STRZOK.

35
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,706
JOINING US NOW COME THE MENU

36
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:18,541
JUST SAW A COME HOUSE GOVERNMENT

37
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,243
AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN

38
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:22,111
SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN TREY

39
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:22,411
GOWDY.

40
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:24,547
GOOD TO SEE YOU, WELCOME BACK TO

41
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:25,448
THE PROGRAM.

42
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:28,150
AT THE HEART OF THIS I THINK YOU

43
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:30,119
CAPTURED IT HERE CONGRESSMAN,

44
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,189
AND THAT IS A BIAS.

45
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,125
THIS MAN WAS IN THE FOREFRONT OF

46
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:36,692
EVERYTHING.

47
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:39,729
DO YOU BELIEVE, AS I DO, THAT

48
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,364
HILLARY CLINTON HAD A RIGGED

49
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:42,932
INVESTIGATION, THAT SHE VIOLATED

50
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,600
THE ESPIONAGE ACT?

51
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:47,370
IT WAS A BIG CASE OF OBSTRUCTION

52
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:49,438
WITH THE EMAILS AND DELETIONS

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,306
AND A BLEACH BIT.

54
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:51,907
DO YOU BELIEVE AS I BELIEVE THAT

55
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:55,277
IN FACT HE WENT AFTER TRUMP WITH

56
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:57,913
A VENGEANCE BECAUSE OF A

57
00:01:57,914 --> 00:01:59,115
POLITICAL VIEW HE EXPRESSED

58
00:01:59,116 --> 00:01:59,515
OFTEN?

59
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:01,984
>> LET'S TAKE TRUMP FIRST.

60
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:03,953
BEFORE YOU EVER BEGIN

61
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,921
INVESTIGATING ALLEGED COLLUSION,

62
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:09,592
HE ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT

63
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:11,427
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BE

64
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,763
DESTABILIZING FOR THE COUNTRY.

65
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:21,103
INTERVIEW THE FIRST PERSON IN

66
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:21,470
AUGUST.

67
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:23,939
HE SAID, WE WILL STOP IT.

68
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,674
WE NEED AN INSURANCE POLICY, AND

69
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,710
THEN HE BEGAN TALKING ABOUT

70
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:28,444
IMPEACHMENT ONE DAY AFTER BOB

71
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:32,915
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION BEGAN.

72
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,116
SO, PETER STRZOK HAS A LEVEL OF

73
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:35,918
BIAS THAT WOULD MAKE IT

74
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,685
IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVERY PROSECUTOR

75
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:38,521
TO STAND IN FRONT OF A JURY AND

76
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:43,659
CONVICTING DONALD TRUMP BEFORE

77
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,195
THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS, HE'S

78
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:48,898
EXONERATING HILLARY CLINTON

79
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:49,598
100000000-0, THAT'S WHAT THE

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,101
VOTE OUGHT TO BE.

81
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,369
AND HE HADN'T INTERVIEWED HER

82
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,571
AND INTERVIEWED 30 OTHER

83
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:58,507
WITNESSES.

84
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:01,410
>> Sean: DID YOU BELIEVE THAT

85
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:03,512
HIS EXPLANATION WAS RELATED TO

86
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:06,949
NOT BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

87
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,825
HIS EXPLANATION OR THE 30 ODD

88
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:16,525
SOME DEMOCRATS.

89
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:18,961
60 DEMOCRATS HAVE VOTED TO MOVE

90
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:20,129
FORWARD WITH IMPEACHMENT ON

91
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:20,863
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND BOB MUELLER

92
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:22,965
HAD RELEASED HIS FIRST SINGLE

93
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:23,466
SOLITARY FINDING.

94
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:24,366
SO THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE UP

95
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,970
THEIR MINDS.

96
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,339
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON IN AMERICA

97
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,707
THAT DIDN'T THINK HE WAS BIASED.

98
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,977
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON IN AMERICA

99
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:37,713
THAT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW

100
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:38,747
INCREDIBLY DETRIMENTAL THOSE

101
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:42,117
TEXTS ARE TO ANY KIND OF SERIOUS

102
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:42,751
INVESTIGATION.

103
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,753
SO LOOK, I SPENT TEN HOURS WITH

104
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:47,790
HIM TWO WEEKS AGO ABOUT AN EQUAL

105
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,525
AMOUNT OF TIME TODAY.

106
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:51,126
HE JUST DOESN'T, HE THINKS WHAT

107
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:52,361
HIS PERSONAL OPINION IS ARE WHAT

108
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:57,666
THE REST OF US CALL BIAS.

109
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,135
>> I GUESS THAT IS WHERE THE

110
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,271
SIMILAR PEOPLE WHO GO TO

111
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:02,605
WALMART.

112
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:04,707
I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE

113
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,308
PEOPLE WHO LIKE WALMART.

114
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:08,711
I LIKE KMART AND COSTCO AND

115
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:09,979
TARGET.

116
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,248
YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT

117
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,450
THERE.

118
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:15,417
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, YOU ARE

119
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,586
A PROSECUTOR AND YOU NEVER LOST

120
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:18,654
THE CASE.

121
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:19,721
AM I CORRECT IN THAT?

122
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:23,359
>> YES.

123
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,368
PEOPLE AND SOME GOOD COPS.

124
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:35,704
>> WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT MORE

125
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:36,906
THAN ANYTHING ELSE HERE,

126
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,340
HILLARY CLINTON IS ALLOWED TO

127
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,943
TAKE THINGS THAT ARE SUBPOENAED

128
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:44,146
AND DELETE THEM.

129
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:46,415
USE BLEACH BIT ON THE HARD

130
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,952
DRIVES, BREAK UP THE SIM CARDS

131
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:52,354
AND, YOU CANNOT MISHANDLE OR

132
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:57,726
THINGS HAPPENED.

133
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:04,900
EARLY MAY AND THEY DIDN'T

134
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:08,337
INTERVIEW HER UNTIL JULY 2ND.

135
00:05:08,338 --> 00:05:12,575
AND THAT TO ME, DO WE HAVE EQUAL

136
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:13,909
JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW?

137
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,312
DO WE HAVE EQUAL APPLICATION OF

138
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:16,712
OUR LAWS?

139
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:19,548
>> AND THAT'S WHAT FRUSTRATES

140
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:19,882
PEOPLE.

141
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,417
THAT'S WHAT FRUSTRATES YOUR VOTE

142
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:23,319
VIEWERS WHO WONDER, WILL THAT

143
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,887
HAPPEN TO ME, TOO?

144
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:28,924
THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI AND

145
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:32,328
ANNOUNCE MY INNOCENCE BEFORE 20

146
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,329
SOME ODD INTERVIEWS HAVE BEEN

147
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:33,929
DONE.

148
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,531
THEY WERE REALLY CLEAR WHEN THEY

149
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:37,566
WENT INTO HER INTERVIEW, SHE'S

150
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,902
NOT GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH

151
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,909
INFORMATION WAS NEVER IN

152
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,311
JEOPARDY, EVEN FROM BEFORE THEY

153
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:50,145
INTERVIEWED HER.

154
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:50,946
I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE

155
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:54,917
THAT DEAL, I THINK THE FBI MAY

156
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,120
COME TALK TO ME AND THE ONLY

157
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,154
THING I HAVE TO DO IS TELL THE

158
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:01,390
TRUTH.

159
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:04,326
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL

160
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:07,630
THE TRUTH AND YOU CAN GET OUT OF

161
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,405
AND THAT WILL STOP HIM FROM EVER

162
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:23,178
BECOMING PRESIDENT.

163
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:29,218
AND, THEY ALSO HAD A CHANCE TO

164
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,720
QUESTION PETER STRZOK TODAY.

165
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,122
WHEN THEY CALLED -- THEY ASKED

166
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:35,257
THE PHI'S OBVIOUS QUESTIONS, I

167
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:39,528
CALLED THIS SINGLE BIGGEST ABUSE

168
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,964
AND POWER SCANDAL IN AMERICAN

169
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:42,297
HISTORY.

170
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:51,874
WAS PETER STRZOK AND OTHERS, AND

171
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,608
THEY IMPACT AN AMERICAN ELECTION

172
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:53,308
IN A WAY THAT THEY SAW FIT TO

173
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:55,911
HURT ONE CANDIDATE AND HELP

174
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:56,712
ANOTHER.

175
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:59,248
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN THE

176
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,315
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA?

177
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,250
>> A POLITICIZATION OF

178
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:02,518
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE END OF

179
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,352
US.

180
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,320
IF WE BEGIN TO VIEW THAT

181
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:15,330
WHERE WE ARE, THEN WE ARE

182
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:16,331
FINISHED AS A REPUBLIC.

183
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,701
I'M PROUD TO BE ON THE HOUSE

184
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:25,607
PFIZER ABUSE.

185
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:28,911
AND WE'VE MADE GOOD PROGRESS ON

186
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:31,113
WHAT WENT INTO THAT PFIZER

187
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:31,714
APPLICATION.

188
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:32,748
SO I KNOW THIS.

189
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,216
I KNOW THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS

190
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:35,551
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT

191
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:36,485
APPLICATION THAT WAS PRESENTED

192
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:39,154
TO THE JUDGE THAT WERE NOT, AND

193
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:46,962
INTERVIEWED 30 FACT WITNESSES.

194
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:48,764
SO IF THAT IS NOT A DICHOTOMY

195
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:51,166
WHERE WE WILL WITHHOLD

196
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,235
EXCULPATORY INFORMATION IN THIS

197
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:54,536
CASE AND NOT WITHHOLD ANY

198
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:55,704
PROSPECT OF PROSECUTION IN THAT

199
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:57,106
CASE, I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE

200
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:57,906
CANNOT BE LEFT WITH THE

201
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:01,677
CONCLUSION THAT IF YOUR NAME IS

202
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:07,116
NAME IS JONES OR SMITH.

203
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,752
>> Sean: WHAT YOU ARE SAYING

204
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:11,120
CONGRESSMAN IS REALLY SCARY TO

205
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:12,554
ME AND IT SHOULD FRIGHTEN EVERY

206
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:12,921
AMERICAN.

207
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:15,724
LET ME ASK YOU ONE LAST

208
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:18,293
QUESTION, WHAT NOW?

209
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,931
I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS

210
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:23,398
OVERWHELMING AND

211
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,366
INCONTROVERTIBLE FOR OBSTRUCTION

212
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,601
AND THE ESPIONAGE ACT AND A

213
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,536
NUMBER OF STATUTES THAT WE LAID

214
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:28,237
OUT HERE.

215
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:29,972
WHAT HAPPENS TO HER AND WHAT

216
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,573
HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

217
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:34,176
INVOLVED IN THE EXONERATION

218
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:38,113
BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION TO

219
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:38,714
IMPACT THE PRESIDENTIAL

220
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:44,153
JUDGES TO GET WARRANTS TO SPY ON

221
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:44,853
AMERICANS AN OPPOSITION PARTY

222
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:47,923
CANDIDATE REPRESENTATIVES.

223
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:50,359
>> THIS IS WHERE I GET MYSELF IN

224
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,493
TROUBLE BECAUSE ALL OF THE

225
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,962
PRINCIPAL DECISION-MAKERS NOW

226
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,736
ROD ROSENSTEIN, CHRIS WRAY.

227
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:02,738
IT'S NO LONGER LORETTA LYNCH AND

228
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:04,540
ERIC HOLDER AND JIM COMEY.

229
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,743
IT'S OUR FOLKS.

230
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:09,845
IF THEY HAD SYSTEMIC ABUSE OR

231
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:11,713
POTENTIAL CRIMINALITY, THEY HAVE

232
00:09:11,714 --> 00:09:13,115
AN OBLIGATION TO PROSECUTE IT.

233
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,550
MY FEAR IS WHEN YOU HAVE THE

234
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,785
HEAD OF THE FBI STAND UP IN

235
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,353
FRONT OF THE ENTIRE WORLD AND

236
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:19,154
EXONERATE HER THE WAY JIM COMEY

237
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:20,122
DATA, I DON'T KNOW A PROSECUTOR

238
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,160
SO OUR OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT

239
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:27,362
WHETHER OR NOT SHE VIOLATED THE

240
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:30,332
ESPIONAGE ACT, I THINK JIM

241
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,467
COMEY -- THEY RUINED IT BY NOT

242
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,469
INTERVIEWING HER SERIOUSLY.

243
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,104
THEN THEY RUINED IT BY THAT

244
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:36,939
UNPRECEDENTED PRESS CONFERENCE.

245
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,941
SO WE WILL NEVER KNOW THE ANSWER

246
00:09:38,942 --> 00:00:00,000
TO YOUR QUESTION.
