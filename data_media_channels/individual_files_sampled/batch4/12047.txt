this question comes from subscriber james who wants no been assuming trump keeps on this similar trajectory to his first two years are you planning to vote for trump in 2020 yeah be heard not about from if he continues on similar trajectory I've said this I've said this before my I had three chief concerns with President Trump when he was candidate Trump one is that who'd not govern conservative because he had said a bunch of crap all over the place there was no guarantee of learn who's gonna be yeah that has been alleviated he's governed extraordinarily conservatively problem number two I had with him is that he was going to Seoul suck the Republican Party and drive them to embrace positions and ideas that I found abominable some of that has happened but it's already happened and it's not gonna be alleviated again by me not voting for him because what's happened has happened and now we're already there so it's a little bit like okay now that now the car is in the river now what do you do right it's not the same thing and in fairness that has been far less severe s first war for sure so I was worried that the entire party was suddenly going to embrace tariffs and the entire party was going to suddenly embrace the idea being soft on Russia or and like take the worst aspects of his rhetoric and then apply those broadly and I don't think that that's been the case among most Republicans in fact I think most Republicans correctly see Trump as more of a vehicle for Policy Priorities than as a thought leader which makes sense cuz thought leaders need to have thoughts so that always meant like really especially polls of young people show that this is not how young people think so that's been alleviated and then concern number three is the one that's still very much on the table and that is the toxification of the Republican brand by President Trump with growing demographic groups in the United States it's obviously true with women it's not quite as obviously true with black folks and Hispanics yeah well it it might be all but the evidence there is kind of skimpy but at the very least it's not really the question is is a deepening damage that already existed with those groups maybe maybe not with women it certainly isn't with young women with young people young people do not like President ROM I mean this is just a fact like millennial generation folks are not fans of President Trump every poll of Millennials ever shows that Trump runs very very poorly among Millennials again the question is is the damage already done and the answer there is kind of yes I mean he's President of the United States if I would hold my vote I don't understand how that's actually changing that especially when I'm standing out here critiquing all the same stuff that other Millennials are critiquing right I'm sitting here saying it's actually bad when he says that women are horror spaces it's kind of when guys the porn stars while they're married it's gross and yucky and I've said before he treats women like garbage because he does treat women like garbage like we all know this this is not a big shock but is any of that so the calculus has changed I'm always happy to change my actions based on the evidence that has changed and several pieces of evidence changes governance has changed and there's a difference between being a candidate and doing stuff and being president and that stuff now being set in stone and the ground itself has changed the ground itself has shifted so I'd be surprised he'd have to do some some more egregious stuff for me to consider not voting for him and just too interesting let's hear your question what do you do once the car is in the water you go home and change your clothes to establish an alibi
