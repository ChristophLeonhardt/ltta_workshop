special counsel robert muller zeroing in on president Trump's business interests in this newspaper war going back and forth like a pendulum the New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmitt report Muller is using his subpoena power to demand documents including some related to Russia from the Trump Organization they write in part quote the order is the first known instance of the special counsel demanding records directly related to president Trump's businesses the breadth of the subpoena was not clear nor was it clear why mr. Muller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents the subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation which mr. Trump's lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now will drag on for at least several more months back in July the president spoke with Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt about this exact legal scenario listen again I can't answer that question because I don't think it's going to happen in today's White House briefing the White House was asked about the New York Times report and if the president still considered this investigation of his finances crossing a kind of red line as we've maintained all along and as the president has said numerous times there was no collusion between the campaign and Russia for specific questions regarding the Trump Organization I would refer you to them but we're gonna continue to fully cooperate out of respect for the special counsel we're not going to comment the Trump Organization did weigh in the company's lawyer issued the following statement it reads since July 2017 we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations including the special counsel and is responding to their requests this is old news and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today here to talk more about it tonight we welcome kETK back to our broadcast the veteran journalist and anchor for BBC World News America Frank feel is back with us former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence who in the past has worked for Robert Muller among others Rick Stengel returns former Undersecretary of State for public diplomacy public affairs as well as the former managing editor of Time magazine also happens to be Nelson Mandela's biographer but more on that at a later date all three are also MSNBC analysts welcome to you all goes without saying Frank they didn't asked they didn't ask they subpoenaed these documents a distinction of great interest to you I know well Brian many experts have already said that there's a strong obstruction case already involving the president so if you've got that why would you then ask pretty please for the Trump Organization to turn over what they can if you suspect they might not be cooperating so you want to lock them in lock them down do it with a subpoena that commands their cooperation another distinction I'm gonna that you explained for me and our audience the documents some of them are about Russia not all what what could that mean for the other requested documents so there's a couple of reasons why this is a significant subpoena first clearly it could show past dealings business dealings with Russia that that clearly would go toward possible masking of monies money laundering that might have gone to the campaign from Russia maybe a violation of the emoluments clause to the Constitution may be evidence of obstruction may be finally shedding light on why the president wants the Special Counsel inquiry to go away because it might show shady business dealings or even debt problems with Russia but but going beyond that going beyond Russia could be showing evidence of other compromise other foreign entities involved in this picture so the the bottom line is the Special Counsel is a prosecutor he's going to keep going if he sees violations of law and he's not going to restrain himself to one country only if he sees other influences and compromise as possible to ktk who has the unenviable job of describing our country to the world on a daily basis caddy we've thrown together a collection of comments Donald Trump has made about business interests or lack thereof with Russia we'll watch it together and talk about it on the other side I'm all over the world but we're not involved in Russia I have nothing to do with Russia folks okay I promise you I never made I don't have any deals with Russia I have no dealings with Russia I have no deals in Russia I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we've stayed away and I have no loans with Russia I have nothing to do with Russia I have no investments in Russia none whatsoever I don't have property and Russia Kaddi it sounds like he has nothing to do with Russia those are his comments based on his own underpinnings perhaps all the more reason why this document subpoena may be a scary thought right I guess if the president has no dealings with Russia really has no dealings with Russia the stash papers that Muller is going to get from the Trump Organization is going to be extremely small right I mean that was what you'd expect none of us think that is the case it does seem that over the years the Russians have dangled the prospect at least of business deals or loans in front of Donald Trump we know that he has traveled that he's been interested in having a Trump Tower built in Moscow and the question I guess for the special prosecutor in the context of this investigation surrounding the 2016 election campaign is was there some financial Mis dealing between the Trump Organization and Moscow that would have given Moscow some kind of leverage over the Trump administration where were President were the Trump to become president that could have gotten some kind of a quid pro quo when it came to policy dealings that is one of the areas that it seems that the Malheur investigation is looking into Rick I wasn't kidding when I talked about the difficulty of Caddy's job explaining our country especially these days to the rest of the world much as you at the State Department for a while where our public face around the world the expression the whole world is watching from the Chicago riots comes to mind as we have a story later tonight about the president allegedly making stuff up when talking to the Canadian Prime Minister all of this matters people can hear it and see it you know that that story about what he said that you know where he actually confessed to lying to a world leader I mean we used to also wondered did he know he was lying even when he was lying well today he confessed that he actually knew he was lying but you know to go back to the rest of story I I have to say with Muller subpoena today I began to think you know maybe he actually ran for president so he could finally build that hotel in Moscow he heads basically that's been a white whale for him for 15 or 20 years I'll have a hotel in Moscow and for a man who is very imprecise with his language he is very precise when he's talking about Russia he's always talking in the present tense I have no investments in Russia but he's had a cascades of Russian money over the years there's Russian development deals that he's been involved in and he's always wanted to have that hotel there so I agree with both with what Frank and Caddy said I mean Muller is looking at are their connections this is the collusion case that is forcing Donald Trump's hand as president do they have compromise on him do they have leverage over him and that's something that's disturbing to go back to your original question to the whole world if Russia has leverage over the president of the United States hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to
