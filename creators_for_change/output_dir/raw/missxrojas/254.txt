19
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,960
just got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture of the person you</font>

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,760
were bringing over and you supplied a

21
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,620
picture but of course the picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

22
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,660
have to be of you yourself it could have

25
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,530
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> came over in this boat very cramped</font>

26
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,270
and comfortable conditions they have

27
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">these pictures with them of the men that</font>

28
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,780
they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me of course when</font>

29
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,399
they get there the men don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any way</font>

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,980
resemble that they don't resemble the

31
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,719
images the picture brides come over with

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,730
a promise of wealth and a life of ease

33
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,700
and luxury but just as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> husbands and</font>

34
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,830
sutures were lying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the way they</font>

35
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,840
looked they were also lying about their

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,970
position as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also tracks the</font>

37
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,830
change in attitude towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Japanese</font>

38
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">and also in the way they see themselves</font>

39
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,049
as the war begins and and as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

40
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,299
involvement in the war as well spurs on

41
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,070
the second book when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> emperor was</font>

42
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,049
divine focuses on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> family who has sent</font>

43
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">to an internment camp in the USA during</font>

44
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the war so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it chronologically kind of</font>

45
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,180
follows and you get the sense that it's

46
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,280
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that the woman of this</font>

47
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">family the mother that she could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easily</font>

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,110
be one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman in here it's hard to</font>

49
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,460
tell because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my favorite</font>

50
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,740
things about these books in that the way

51
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,060
they're written the writing style

52
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,700
doesn't use any names and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

53
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,790
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> book uses a collective we in front</font>

54
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,740
of pretty much everything and there is a

55
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,229
point at<font color="#CCCCCC"> which that we shifts and the</font>

56
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,090
function<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that shifting weed the way</font>

57
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,890
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes you feel about those groups</font>

58
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,320
like that's quite jarring and also in a

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,210
way signifies how they're kind of

60
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,369
written out of history and and how it's

61
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,770
up to all of us to bring up these parts

62
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,719
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history as well because whether you</font>

63
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,508
live in the US or anywhere else in the

64
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">world this is part of a collective</font>

65
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,770
history and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a collect</font>

66
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,080
to retelling of it it's worth reading

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,980
all the way through to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

68
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,600
acknowledgments especially in the case

69
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,970
of the burglar in the Attic because some

70
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,370
of the language that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is used and you</font>

71
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,400
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is very consistent with the</font>

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,140
language of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

73
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,300
little bit more recent I guess expands

74
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,860
the breadth of the political message of

75
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,450
the book as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're quite short at</font>

76
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the books and they fit easily in bags</font>

77
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,660
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trains and no under your arm or</font>

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,660
something they were really tremendous

80
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,030
they really stunned me actually I would

81
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,340
recommend Julie asuka's the budget in

82
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,930
the attic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when the emperor was</font>

83
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,490
divine but guys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see on</font>

84
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,900
