RISING TOXIC GAS.
ERIC: PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE ARE
TOLD, WILL HAVE A PHONE
CONVERSATION TOMORROW WITH NORTH
KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG UN.
THIS, OF COURSE, FOLLOWS THEIR
HISTORIC SUMMIT TRYING TO RID
THE REGIME OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THE PRESIDENT DID SAY THAT
ANOTHER ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED
DURING THEIR MEETING, THAT OF
HUMAN RIGHTS.
BUT CRITICS ARE SAYING HUMAN
RIGHTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
PROMINENT DURING THE SUMMIT AND
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT TOUGH
RIGHTS ABUSES.
HERE IS HOW HE RESPONDED ABOUT
THAT.
>> YOU HAVE SPOKEN SO
PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO OTTO
WARM BEER'S DEATH.
>> YEAH.
>> IN THE SAME BREATH, YOU'RE
DEFENDING KIM JONG UN'S HUMAN
RIGHTS RECORD.
>> YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE A
NUCLEAR WEAPON DESTROY YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY, OKAY?
>> WELL --
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT, I
DON'T WANT TO SEE A NUCLEAR
WEAPON DESTROY YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY --
>> HOW CAN KIM LOVE HIS PEOPLE
IF HE'S KILLING THEM?
>> I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT.
I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE FACT
THAT WE SIGNED AN INCREDIBLE
AGREEMENT, IT'S GREAT, AND IT'S
GOING TO BE GREAT FOR THEM TOO.
ERIC: SO WHAT ARE THOSE ABUSES?
PROFESSOR WALTER HATCH JOINS US
FROM COLBY COLLEGE IN
WATERVILLE, MAINE.
HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE HUMAN
RIGHTS RECORD OF KIM JONG UN?
>> WELL, FIRST, THANKS FOR
INVITING ME ON, ERIC.
I WOULD SAY THAT THE HUMAN
RIGHTS RECORD IN NORTH KOREA IS
PERHAPS THE WORST OF ANY COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD.
IT'S TRULY ATROCIOUS.
ERIC: ANY COUNTRY?
THE WORST?
>> YEAH.
I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER THAT
HAS A WORSE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.
THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS UP TO
200,000 PRISONERS DETAINED AT
ANY ONE TIME IN FOUR DIFFERENT
GULAGS AROUND THE COUNTRY.
PEOPLE ARE EXECUTED RIGHT AND
LEFT FOR BEING POLITICAL
DISSIDENTS OR SIMPLY NOT BEING
SUFFICIENTLY LOYAL TO THE
REGIME.
KIM JONG UN HAS HAD HIS UNCLE
EXECUTED, HE'S HAD HIS OWN
BROTHER MURDERED.
THIS IS NOT A NICE REGIME.
ERIC: YEAH, TALK A BIT ABOUT
PRISONS.
WE HAVE SOME PICTURES OF THOSE.
THEY'RE CALLED CONCENTRATION
CAMPS, AND THERE ARE EVEN
REPORTS THAT IF YOUR GRANDFATHER
DEFIED THE REGIME, DEFIED KIM'S
GRANDFATHER, THREE GENERATIONS
OF A FAMILY COULD BE IMPRISONED
FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES IN THESE
POLITICAL PRISONS?
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST
REMARKABLE THINGS.
IT'S NOT JUST INDIVIDUALS, BUT
ENTIRE FAMILIES ARE DETAINED.
AND DURING THESE INTERROGATIONS
THAT ARE CONDUCTED, TORTURE IS
ROUTINELY USED.
WOMEN ARE RAPED.
AGAIN, THIS REGIME IS
EXTRAORDINARILY BAD IN ITS HUMAN
RIGHTS RECORD.
AND THERE'S AN OFFICIAL POLICY
OF DISCRIMINATION, THE POLICY
THAT THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME
USES IDENTIFIES PARTICULAR
GROUPS -- CHRISTIANS, LANDLORDS,
PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEN AS SOMEHOW
ADVANTAGED ARE UNDER ESPECIALLY
CLOSE SURVEILLANCE.
BUT, IN FACT, EVERYBODY IS
SURVEILLED CLOSELY IN NORTH
KOREA.
ALL -- IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH,
AND VERY FEW PEOPLE DO HAVE
ACCESS TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR
THE INTERNET -- ALL OF THOSE
KINDS OF COMMUNICATIONS OR
ELECTRONIC ACTIVITY ARE
ROUTINELY MONITORED BY BUREAU 27
OF THE STATE SECURITY.
THIS IS A REGIME THAT TAKES NO
CHANCES WITH ITS PEOPLE, THAT
BROOKS NO DISSENT OR EVEN MILDLY
QUESTIONING BEHAVIOR.
FINISH.
ERIC: STATE DEPARTMENT HAD A
PRETTY SHOCKING REPORT.
LET ME READ YOU SOME OF THAT.
IT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGES
IN, QUOTE: KILLINGS, FORCED
LABOR, TORTURE, RAPE, FORCED
ABORTIONS AND OTHER SEXUAL
VIOLATION.
FORCED LABOR AND MASS
MOBILIZATIONS, REEDUCATION
THROUGH A LABOR EXAMPLE CAMPS,
ETC., ETC.
MANY OF THE COUNTRY'S HUMAN
RIGHTS ABUSES UNDERWRITE THEIR
REGIME'S WEAPONS PROGRAM, AND IT
CONTINUES BY SAYING THAT
INCLUDES THE FORCE LABOR AND
THOSE MASS MOBILIZATIONS,
REEDUCATION AT THE LABOR CAMPS
AND AND OVERSEAS LABOR
CONTRACTS.
THOUSANDS OF NORTH KOREANS ARE
SENT ABROAD EVERY YEAR TO WORK
IN SLAVE-LIKE CONDITIONS EARNING
REVENUE FOR THE REGIME.
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS?
DOES THE PRESIDENT RAISE THIS
FURTHER, STRONGER IN HIS
CONVERSATION TOMORROW WITH KIM,
OR SHOULD IT BE RAISED ON A
LOWER LEVEL?
YOU KNOW, HE SAYS PRIMARILY THE
GOAL IS DEALING WITH NUCLEAR
WEAPONS, BUT WHAT SHOULD WE DO
TRYING TO CHANGE THIS BEHAVIOR?
>> RIGHT.
WELL, THIS'LL SOUND ODD COMING
FROM THE DIRECTOR OF A HUMAN
RIGHTS PROGRAM, YOU KNOW, AT
COLBY COLLEGE, I DIRECT THE OAK
INSTITUTE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
BUT I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE
PRESIDENT, WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
ON THIS, THAT HUMAN RIGHTS
PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE FRONT AND
CENTER OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS.
WE'RE TRYING, AFTER ALL, TO
BROKER SOME KIND OF PEACE
AGREEMENT OR DISARMAMENT PLAN,
TRYING TO PERSUADE KIM REGIME TO
IMPROVE ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD,
I THINK, WOULD NOT BE FRUITFUL
AT THIS POINT.
ERIC: DO YOU THINK --
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF
DISCOURSE OR RHETORIC THAT'S
COME FROM OUR PRESIDENT WHERE
HE'S PRAISED KIM JONG UN AS
SMART AND TALENTED AND FUNNY,
HAS SAID THAT HE HAS THE BEST
INTERESTS OF THE NORTH KOREAN
PEOPLE IN MIND, THAT HE LOVES
HIS PEOPLE, THAT HE WANTS TO
TAKE CARE OF THEM.
THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE
PATENTLY FALSE, AND I DON'T
THINK THEY DO ANYTHING BUT
LEGITIMIZE ONE OF THE WORLD'S
MOST BRUTAL DICK A TODAY TO
HAVES -- DICTATORS.
ERIC: AND FINALLY, OTTO
WARMBIER, THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS
BASICALLY MURDERED IN PRISON.
SHOULD THE PRESIDENT OR THE
ADMINISTRATION AT SOME POINT
BRING THAT CASE UP?
IT IS CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S
HEART, WE ARE TOLD, TO PROSECUTE
THE KILLERS OF OTTO WARMBIER?
TELL KIM TO PROSECUTE THIS YOUNG
MAN'S MURDERERS?
>> AGAIN, I HATE TO SOUND COLD,
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT MAKES
THE MOST SENSE RIGHT NOW TO PUT
OTTO WARMBIER'S CASE ON THE
TABLE.
WE COULD ALSO, I MEAN, THIS IS
WHAT PRIME MINISTER ABE OF JAPAN
HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR, IS TALKING
ABOUT THE ALMOST 20 PEOPLE FROM
JAPAN THAT WERE ABDUCTED,
ACTUALLY KIDNAPPED FROM JAPAN BY
NORTH KOREAN INTELLIGENCE IN THE
LATE '70s AND '80s.
I MEAN, THERE'S SO MUCH THAT A
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT COULD
INSIST ON, BUT I THINK THAT
NEEDS TO COME AFTER SOME KIND OF
MOVEMENT TOWARDS NORMALIZATION
OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO
HAS ILL COUNTRIES -- HOSTILE
COUNTRIES.
ERIC: PROFESSOR WALTER HATCH OF
COLBY COLLEGE, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ERIC: PERHAPS THEY'LL FOCUS ON
THE NUCLEAR ISSUE RIGHT NOW, AS
