there's a new Elementary School in Winnipeg and one of the first orders of business was to figure out how to alter Halloween so that it no longer resembles Halloween just wait'll you hear how uper sensitive educates our acting like vampires when it comes to sucking all the fun out of childhood so the principle of sage Creek school Marc Poirier says that since this Winnipeg school encompasses kindergarten to grade eight this makes celebrating Halloween problematic why you ask well the older grade seven and eight kids might dawn really horrific costumes which might scare some of the younger kids and the lower grades can't have that no sir not as we continue to build our brave new realm of snowflake nation so the way the kids at Sage Creek school will celebrate Halloween this year is by embracing something called tie and scarf day yeah they're going to wear ties and scarves to school on the 31st oh what fun most parents are livid with an initiative to fix a problem that doesn't exist after all why would anyone want to eradicate the fear factor from Halloween isn't Halloween all about being scary you know it reminds me of that classic se TV sketch monster chiller theater presents count Floyd's have yourself a scary little Christmas oh poor count Floyd how he would try so hard to deliver scary content yet fail miserably so when something actually scary did happen on a show well it was akin to receiving a gift from God check it out and don't forget to put on your 3d glasses no no I think the kid from deliverance was right at one point though and that is when you're negotiating settlement it's imperative that the Lucy what's the matter oh that's good that's oh oh that's right Lucy that's scary when the kid from deliverance scared you that was a good thing too because you're on a show called have yourself a scary little Christmas and yes Halloween can make for a delightfully scary time but back to sage Creek school let's just suppose the unthinkable did happen and a grade one kid teared up thanks to someone wearing a Wolf Man mask doesn't this make for one of those so-called teachable moments you know the idea of a teacher taking the soon to side and calmly explaining that Halloween is all about make belief that there's no such thing as monsters what am I saying that that might require a little extra effort and besides the teachers only recently got back from their brief 10-week summer vacation so instead we have tie and scarf day a sad pathetic reminder of the day formerly known as Halloween and it's yet another indicator of how busybody educates continue to engineer a bubble wrap society at the expense of having fun here are some more recent initiatives to prove my premise item Cape Breton victoria regional school board has banned school dances for students in grades 6 to 8 Donnie Holland acting coordinator of school services says officials decided there were better activity options that were more age-appropriate said Holland it's not so much that we're saying dances are evil and then he went on to imply why dances are well kind of evil gee sounds like the plot line for food loose item administrators at the Mercer County School District in Washington State have banned the game of tag Oh correction they haven't actually banned tag outright they've only Bend the use of tagging while playing tag but how can one play tag if the kid who is it can't tag the kid who isn't it but as the school district notes sternly students are expected to keep their hands to themselves the shanell behind this is to ensure the physical and emotional safety of all students item travel the foreign lands can make for an educational experience but alas the Peel District School Board in Ontario has canceled overseas trips to Europe due to safety concerns and what is so unsafe about countries such as the Czech Republic Italy and Austria well terrorism of course you know the drill the school board has a moral and legal obligation to protect the kids bla bla bla bla even though the odds are being killed by a terrorist attack on a plane are approximately 25 million to one in other words folks who are about twice as likely to win a lotto 649 jackpot than becoming an Isis casualty in fact of these Pele district educates even check the actuary tables in terms of potentially deadly activities they discover terrorism is way down the list for example drowning in a bathtub is 685 thousand to 1 fatally slipping during a shower is 812 thousand to one dying in a car accident is 19 thousand 1 please don't tell the Peel District Board knobs any of these stats they might ban their students from bathing showering and riding in cars item I've saved the best or is that the worst for last Eleonora Heights public school in Sydney Australia has been unnecessary noise apparently some people are triggered by noise so instead of these sonic victims wearing earplugs or noise cancelling headphones the school has outlawed cheering and clapping as a way of expressing approval for achievement students can now only show their admiration by engaging in silent cheering approved silent cheering includes fist pumps in the air wiggling on the spot or pulling an excited face let me give this a whirl Oh bottom line methinks Pink Floyd was right some 30 odd years ago when they opened or the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies hey folks we have an all-new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
