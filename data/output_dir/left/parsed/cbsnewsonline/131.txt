INVESTIGATION. 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL GOES IN AND 
TAKES A LOOK AND FIND OUT FOR US
IN THE COMMITTEE AND FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT REALLY 
HAPPENED. 
HE DID HE WENT IN AND SPENT A 
LOT OF TIME INTERVIEWING MANY 
PEOPLE. 
HE DID CHASTISE YOU. 
I UNDERSTAND YOU EXCEPT THAT 
ADMONISHMENT. 
YOU FOUND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE 
WHATSOEVER OF POLITICAL BIAS IN 
THE DECISION MADE IN THAT 
INVESTIGATION AND A DIRECT 
QUOTE OF WE DO NOT FIND 
DOCUMENTS OR TESTIMONY OF 
PROPER CONSIDERATIONS MADE. 
TO LISTEN TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS 
YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE FBI 
WHICH I HAD ALWAYS FELT WAS 
MADE UP OF CONSERVATIVE LAW-
ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE HAD 
MAGICALLY BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO 
A LEFT-WING ORGANIZATION. 
THAT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING. 
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
PEOPLE WHO WERE IN CHARGE YOU 
HAVE PEOPLE APPOINTED BY THE 
PRESIDENT THAT ARE NOT 
DEMOCRATS. 
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT ROBERT 
MUELLER IS NOT A DEMOCRAT. 
THESE ARE NOT POLITICAL 
DECISIONS MADE BY POLITICAL 
OPERATIVES.  
THEY SHOULD BE FOLLOWING THE 
EVIDENCE. 
I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT IF 
YOU HAD WANTED TO HARM AND 
INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU COULD HAVE 
LEAKED INFORMATION THAT THE 
INVESTIGATION WAS ONGOING. 
NONE OF THAT CAME OUT. 
WE ASKED THE LEADERS OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FBI 
ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS AN 
INVESTIGATION OF MR. TRUMP 
PRIOR TO THE ELECTION AND WE 
WERE TOLD THEY COULD NOT 
COMMENT ON IT WHICH WAS IN FACT 
THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. 
YOU SHOULD NOT COMMENT ON AN 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. IF YOU 
FIND SOMETHING YOU HAVE AN 
INDICTMENT. 
IF YOU DON'T FIND SOMETHING YOU 
SAY NOTHING. 
THAT IS WHERE MR. COMEY  
ERRORED. 
HE DAMAGED THE CAMPAIGN OF ONE 
OF THE CANDIDATES. 
THE REST IS HISTORY. 
I THINK THIS HEARING IS 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE 
HAD THIS KIND OF CIRCUS OF 
TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THE 
INVESTIGATORS WHEN THAT IS 
ALREADY DONE. 
I URGE THAT WE MAKE SURE THE 
ACTIONS WE TAKE DO NOT CREATE 
FURTHER DIVISIONS IN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED A FEW 
MONTHS AGO THE TOP LEADERSHIP 
IN INVESTIGATORS OF THE FBI AND 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAVE 
POLITICIZED THIS INVESTIGATIVE 
PROCESS IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRATS 
AND AGAINST REPUBLICANS 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
UNTHINKABLE A SHORT TIME AGO. 
IS THAT TWEET SUPPORTED BY THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT? 
>> NO. 
>> NO, IT IS NOT. 
I WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE ON THE 
COMMITTEE WHO BELIEVE IN THE 
RULE OF LAW, WHO UNDERSTAND 
THAT OUR COUNTRY WILL BE 
DAMAGED IF WE ALLOW POLITICAL 
DIVISIONS TO ATTACK OUR LAW-
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO 
UNDERCUT INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE 
WILL BE HARMING OUR COUNTRY IN 
A WAY THAT OUR ENEMIES 
INCLUDING RUSSIA HOPE WE WOULD 
DO. 
THAT'S WHY THEY INTERFERED IN 
OUR ELECTION. 
TWO CAUSES HARM, CREATE DIVISION
AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND 
AMONG US HERE IN THE HALLS OF 
GOVERNMENT. 
I WOULD ASK THAT WE TAKE YES, 
FOR AN ANSWER. 
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATED THIS MATTER. 
HE FOUNDOUT THERE WAS NOT 
POLITICAL INFLUENCE. 
WE WAIT FOR THE RESULTS OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
I PRAY THAT WE FIND OUR 
PRESIDENT WAS NOT INVOLVED. 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT NEWS FOR 
OUR COUNTRY. 
IF THAT IS THE FINDING I WILL 
ACCEPT IT NOT INVESTIGATE IT. 
I HOPE THAT WE CAN PUT OUR 
PARTISANSHIP AT THE DOOR. STEP 
BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE THAT WE 
ARE FINDING OURSELVES NOW. 
I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS HEARING 
WHICH I THINK SERVES NO GOOD 
PURPOSE FOR OUR COUNTRY COULD 
BE BROUGHT TO AN END. 
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM TENNESSEE MR. 
DUNCAN. 
>> THANK YOU, QUICKLY I WOULD 
LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH 
THE OUTSTANDING OPENING 
STATEMENTS MADE BY THE CHAIRMAN.
THEY WERE THE FINEST OPENING 
STATEMENTS I'VE HEARD IN MY 30 
YEARS OF CONGRESS. 
WELL MR. STRZOK WILL STUBBORNLY 
OT ADMIT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE 
KNOWS IS EXTREME BIAS  I FIND 
IT AMAZING THAT HE CAN SIT HERE 
AND SAY THAT HE WAS NOT BIASED 
IN ANY WAY THAT WOULD AFFECT 
HIS INVESTIGATIONS. 
IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I 
WANT TO READ THE WORDS FROM THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHO WROTE 
THAT THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION 
WAS THE WAY IT WAS CONDUCTED WAS
INCONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL 
INVESTIGATIVE STRATEGY AND GAVE 
RISE TO ACCUSATIONS OF BIAS AND 
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. 
I WOULD GUESS MR. STRZOK KNOWS 
CHRIS, WHO SPENT 24 YEARS WITH 
THE FBI  AND RETIRED AS THE 
HEAD OF ALL CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATIONS. HE WROTE THE IG 
REPORT PRESENTS JARRING EVIDENCE
OF POLITICAL BIAS BY THE FBI 
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BUT FAILS 
TO ADD ALL UP TO COME TO THE 
INEVITABLE CONCLUSION THAT 
POLITICAL BIAS WAS THERE. 
THIS IS LIKE SAYING ONE PLUS 
ONE EQUALS ZERO. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO THINK 
THEY HAD SOME SORT OF BIAS OR 
ANIMOSITY TOWARDS YOU? 
>> I DISAGREE WITH THE 
CONCLUSIONS. 
I CAN'T SPEAK TO MOTIVATIONS OF 
BIAS WHATSOEVER. 
I KNOW OF NO BIAS I THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL. 
>> CHERYL ATKINSON, THE 
NEWSPAPER WROTE EARTH SHATTERING
FINDING ON TRAN34 BY THE 
GENERAL CONFIRMS CITIZENS WORST 
FEARS A HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT 
AND OFFICIAL ALLEGEDLY 
CONSPIRED TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME 
OF THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION. 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
YOU KNOW THAT JUDGES WHO HAVE 
MINIMAL BIAS ARE REQUIRED TO 
RECRUIT THEMSELVES FROM A CASE. 
DO YOU THINK FBI AGENTS HAVE 
SOME SORT OF SPECIAL TREATMENT? 
>> I WOULD SAY THAT FBI AGENTS, 
JUDGES, ALL ARE EXPECTED AT 
WHATEVER THEIR PERSONAL 
BELIEVES THAT THEY SENT -- SET 
THOSE BELIEVES INSIDE. 
>> YOU DON'T BELIEVE YOU ARE 
ENTITLED TO A LOWER STANDARD. 
>> I AM HELD TO THE HIGHEST 
STANDARD AND I ABIDED BY THAT. 
>> YOU TOLD THE CHAIRMAN THAT 
YOU DID NOT THINK YOU SHOULD 
HAVE HER CRUISE YOURSELF IN 
THIS CASE. 
-- RECUSE YOURSELF IN THIS CASE.
>> I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE 
IN KEEPING WITH THE HIGH 
STANDARDS OF THE F PI. 
>> I THINK THAT -- FBI. I THINK 
THAT THEY HAD POLITICAL RAM 
HAITIANS AND -- RAMIFICATIONS 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOU TO HER 
CRUISE YOURSELF AND MOVE ON TO 
OTHER WORK. 
THERE ARE MANY OTHER CASES HE 
COULD HAVE WORKED ON. 
>> I DISAGREE WITH YOU. 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN NECESSARY FOR ME TO DO 
THAT. 
I THINK EVERY DAY WITH THE 
INVESTIGATION AND WHEN I WALKED 
IN THE DOOR THE ENTIRETY OF MY 
ACTIONS WAS DEDICATED TO 
PURSUING THE FACTS WHEREVER 
THEY LIVE. 
MANY TIMES -- 
>> AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND 
GUILTY THEY APOLOGIZE AND SAY 
THEY ARE SORRY AND TRY TO GET 
PROBATION. 
MANY TIMES PEOPLE THINK THOSE 
APOLOGIES ARE SET MORE IN HOPES 
OF GETTING PROBATION AND REGRET 
THAT THEY HAD BEEN CAUGHT 
RATHER THAN A SINCERE APOLOGY. 
DO YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD 
APOLOGIZE IN ANY WAY TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR THE THINGS 
YOU EXPRESSED? DO YOU HAVE A 
REQUEST -- REGRET? 
>> I DON'T AGREE WITH THE 
CHARACTERIZATION OF MY VIEWS AS 
BIAS. 
I CLEARLY ARTICULATE AND I HOPE 
WHEN YOU HEARD ME IN MY OPENING 
STATEMENT WHEN I TALKED ABOUT 
MY REGRET TO THE PEOPLE THAT I 
LOVE IN MY FAMILY WHEN I TALKED 
TO THE WAY THAT THESE TEXT HAVE 
BEEN USED AGAINST IT THE EYE 
WHEN I RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS 
ABOUT USING A PHRASE, YES, 
THOSE WERE NOT INTENDED AS 
DIRECT ANIMUS TOWARDS ANY SET 
OF PEOPLE. 
I HOPE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND I 
SINCERELY REGRET THAT. 
>> TIME HAS REQUIRED -- EXPIRED.
>> THANK YOU, FOR MONTHS 
REPUBLICANS HAVE INCREASINGLY 
USED CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT 
AUTHORITY TO UNDERMINE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL MUELLER'S  
INVESTIGATION. 
THEY HAVE CALLED FOR HIS 
INVESTIGATION TO BE SHUT DOWN. 
WHY? 
IT'S CONCERNING NATIONAL 
SECURITY AND IT SEEMS TO BE 
SUCCESSFUL. 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL HAS 
OBTAINED FIVE GUILTY PLEAS AND 
INDICTED 18 OTHERS. 
INCLUDED IN THESE INDICTMENTS 
AND CONFESSIONS MICHAEL FLYNN, 
PLED GUILTY TO LYING TO THE 
FBI.  
RICK GATES, PLED GUILTY TO 
CONSPIRING AGAINST OUR COUNTRY. 
GEORGE, PLED GUILTY TO MAKING 
FALSE STATEMENTS TO OUR COUNTRY 
AND THE FBI. 
I AM NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE 
REPUBLICANS WANT TO SHUT DOWN. 
DO THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL'S UPCOMING 
TRIALS AGAINST CAMPAIGN MANAGER 
PAUL MANAFORT? 
ONE OF THESE TRIALS IS GOING TO 
BEGIN HERE IN VIRGINIA. 
A GRAND JURY APPROVED A SET OF 
32 COUNTS OF TAX FINANCIAL AND 
BANK FRAUD. CHARGES AGAINST MR. 
MANAFORT AND ON FIGURE 16, A 
FEDERAL GRANT JURY -- GRAND 
JURY APPROVED FIVE OTHER 
CHARGES AGAINST MR. MANAFORT 
AND MR. GATES INCLUDING AND I 
QUOTE "CONSPIRACY AGAINST 
UNITED DATES" IN THIS 
INDICTMENT COMING FORWARD I 
WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE FROM IT. 
>> THE DEFENDANT TOGETHER WITH 
OTHERS INCLUDING GATES, 
KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY 
CONSPIRED TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED 
STATES BY IMPEDING, IMPAIRING, 
AND DEFEATING THE LAWFUL 
GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS OF 
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. 
NAMELY THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF 
TREASURY. 
TO COMMIT OFFENSES AGAINST THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
SINCE THIS INDICTMENT GATES, 
HAS PLEADED GUILTY. 
HE IS NOW COOPERATING. 
HE INCLUDED IN HIS STATEMENT 
MANAFORT ENGAGED IN A VARIETY 
OF CRIMINAL SCHEMES. 
GATES IS PART OF THAT WORK FOR 
MANAFORT KNOWINGLY AND 
INTENTIONALLY CONSPIRED TO 
ASSIST MANAFORT IN CRIMINAL 
SCHEMES. 
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU MR. 
STRZOK, TO BE CLEAR  MR. GATES, 
IS SWEARING UNDER OATH THAT HE 
IS IN HIS GUILTY PLEA AND HE 
CONSPIRED WITH MR. MANAFORT IN 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>> I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE 
STATEMENT OF FACTS. 
I WILL STIPULATE TO WHAT YOU 
ARE READING. 
>> IN A FEW WEEKS MR. 
MANAFORT'S TRIAL DATE IS SET TO 
BEGIN. 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TEAM OF 
PROSECUTORS WILL PRESENT THEIR 
EVIDENCE. I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW 
ANYONE IN THIS BODY ARE IN THIS 
COUNTRY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
MR. MANAFORT AND HIS CO-
CONSPIRATORS WOULD EVER WANT IN 
ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM, TO HALT 
THIS TRIAL FROM GOING FORWARD. 
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON WHY 
ANYONE WOULD WANT TO HALT THIS 
TRIAL FROM GOING FORWARD? 
>> I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY. 
>> Reporter: THANK YOU, I YIELD 
BACK. 
>> Reporter: I YIELD TO MR. 
CUMMINGS. 
>> I MAILED -- YIELD. 
>> IN THE SPIRIT OF TRANSPARENCY
WE ALL WANT TRANSPARENCY HERE. 
I WOULD OFFER FOR THE 
CHAIRMAN'S CONSIDERATION THIS 
BODY'S CONSIDERATION RELEASING 
THE FULL TRANSCRIPTS THAT WE 
HAD IN THE 11 HOUR CONDITIONS. 
WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
INTERVIEW MS. LISA PAGE, FIRST 
SINCE THE TEXT MESSAGES WERE 
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO 
WITNESSES.  
WE CAN SCRUB THAT INTERVIEW FOR 
PERSONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION 
THAT MIGHT BE EMBARRASSING 
BEFORE WE DO THAT WITH THAT 
I'LL YIELD BACK. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN RECOMMENDATION 
IS TAKEN. WE WILL DEFINITELY 
TAKE THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT. 
>> I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD 
GIVE THE FBI THE OPPORTUNITY 
FOR REDUCTION OF ANYTHING THAT 
WOULD IMPACT THE NATION'S 
NATIONAL SECURITY. 
I THINK THAT IS EXTREMELY 
IMPORTANT AND I HOPE THE 
GENTLEMAN WILL ACCEPT. 
>> I WANT TO THANK, HIM FOR 
TRYING TO WORK THESE THINGS OUT 
IN FULL TRANSPARENCY. 
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THIS 
COMMITTEE WILL APPRECIATE IT. 
>> DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
NORTH CAROLINA SUGGEST SOLELY 
ON THE TESTIMONY TO AGENT 
STRZOK? 
WOULD WE APPLY THAT SAME 
PROCESS  AND THE SAME STANDARD 
TO THE PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED 
TESTIMONY OF ANDREW McCABE WHO 
WAS EXAMINED IN A SIMILAR 
ENVIRONMENT? 
>> I THINK IN THE SPIRIT OF 
TRANSPARENCY WE NEED TO LOOK AT 
ALL INTERVIEWS TO LET THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE JUDGE FOR 
THEMSELVES. 
I THINK THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH 
MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM MARYLAND. 
>> I YIELD BACK. 
>> MR. SMITH FOR FIVE MINUTES. 
>> I YIELD MY TIME FOR MY 
FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE. 
>> AGENT STRZOK  PRESIDENT TRUMP
HIRED FBI DIRECTOR JIM COMEY. 
THAT SAME DAY  YOU AND A LAWYER 
EXCHANGED TEXT ON THE TOPIC. 
AT 8:14 P.M. 
THAT DAY YOU TEXT MS. PAGE AND 
SAID WE NEED TO OPEN THE CASE 
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING ON NOW 
WHILE ANDY IS ACTING. 
IS THAT ANDY McCABE WHO HAS 
SINCE BEEN FIRED AND REFERRED 
BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL? 
>> IT IS. 
>> WHAT CASE ARE YOU REFERRING 
TO OPENING THAT ANDY IS THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI? 
>> TO GET INTO THAT WOULD 
RELATE TO ON GOING 
INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY I AM 
NOT AUTHORIZED TO DISCUSS 
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS. 
>> LET ME SEE IF I COULD GIVE 
YOU A QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER. 
YOU SENT FORMER TEXT TO MS. 
PAGE AND HER RESPONSE TO YOU AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THAT PAGE ARE 
LOOKING AT IS WE NEED TO LOCK IN
AND THEN THERE IS A BLACK MARK 
WERE SOMEONE'S NAME HAS BEEN 
REDACTED. 
WE NEED TO LOCK IN REDACTED IN 
A FORMER CHARGEABLE WAY SOON. 
WHOSE NAME IS BLOCKED OUT? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
I NEED TO SEE THE ORIGINAL 
TEXT. 
>> I DON'T KNOW EITHER. 
HERE IS WHAT ELSE I DON'T KNOW. 
IF THE PERSONS WHOSE NAME HAS 
BEEN REDACTED IS REPUBLICAN OR 
DEMOCRAT. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE BLOCK, 
BROWN, OR WHITE. 
I DON'T KNOW THEIR RELIGIOUS 
BELIEFS OR SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS. 
I DON'T CARE. 
I DO KNOW DECISIONS ABOUT WHEN 
AND WHETHER TO OPEN 
INVESTIGATIONS AND WHEN AND 
WHETHER TO CHARGE PEOPLE WITH 
CRIMES AREN'T SUPPOSED TO 
DEPEND ON WHO'S SITTING IN THE 
DIRECTOR'S CHAIR OR ON 
POLITICAL DECISIONS, OR ON 
POLITICAL AGENDAS OF FBI AGENTS 
AND LAWYERS. 
IF A TRUMP HATING FBI AGENTS 
AND A TRUMP HATING LAWYER HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT IMPEACHING TRUMP 
AND STOPPING TRUMP WITHIN HOURS 
OF HIM FIRING THEIR BOSS IF 
THEY START TALKING ABOUT 
OPENING AN INVESTIGATION NOW 
THE ANDY, IS ACTING IN THAT 
SOME PERSON NEEDS TO BE LOCKED 
IN IN A FORMAL CHARGEABLE WAY 
SOON, I KNOW, AS A FORMAL U.S. 
ATTORNEY I KNOW THAT WHOEVER IS 
THE SUBJECT OF THAT CASE THAT 
WAS OPEN NOW NOW THAT ANDY IS 
ACTING AND WHOEVER YOU AND MISS 
CHANGE -- PAGE WOULD HAVE HAD 
THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES VIOLATED. 
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED 
OF DUE PROCESS. 
MY SECOND QUESTION TO YOU YOU 
COULD NOT ANSWER. 
LET'S GO FOR A THIRD QUESTION. 
ON PAGE 400 OF THE IG REPORT 
SOMEONE TELLS THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL THERE IS A BRIGHT LINE, 
A BRIGHT INVIOLABLE LINE 
BETWEEN WHAT YOU THINK 
PERSONALLY AND BELIEVE IN THE 
CONDUCT OF YOUR OFFICIAL 
BUSINESS. 
WHO SAID THAT? 
>> I BELIEVE I DID, SIR. 
>> YOU DID SAY THAT. 
I HEARD YOU SAY SIMILAR THINGS 
LAST WEEK, AND TODAY. 
YOU SAID IT CLEARLY YOU SAID 
UNEQUIVOCALLY IN YOUR OPENING 
REMARKS THAT YOU NEVER CROSSED 
THAT INDELIBLE LINE IN 26 
YEARS. 
EARLIER TODAY IN RESPONSE TO A 
QUESTION YOU SAID I TOOK MY 
PERSONAL BELIEF OUT OF EVERY 
OFFICIAL ACTION. 
YOU ARE ASKING US TO BELIEVE 
THAT WHEN YOU SAY THINGS LIKE F 
TRAP AND STOP TRUMP, AND 
IMPEACH TRUMP THAT THOSE ARE 
JUST PERSONAL BELIEFS. 
WHEN YOU SAY THOSE THINGS YOU 
NEVER CROSSED THAT WINE. 
THAT RIGHT INVIOLABLE LINE AND 
ALLOWED TO IMPACT YOUR OFFICIAL 
CONDUCT. 
THAT IS WHAT THIS COMES DOWN 
TO. 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO 
BELIEVE? 
>> I AM ASKING YOU TO BELIEVE 
AND I'M OFFERING EVIDENCE. 
THE IG REPORT SAYS THERE IS 
BEEN NO ACTIVE BIAS FOUND 
ANYWHERE. 
>> UNDER OATH YOU HAVE BEEN AS 
CLEAR AS A BELL ON THAT. 
YOU HAVE READ IT OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN. 
BECAUSE OF THAT I'M EMBARRASSED 
TO ASK THIS QUESTION. 
OF THE APPROXIMATELY 50,000 
TEXT MESSAGES THAT I HAVE SEEN 
WITH YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS LIKE 
STOP TRUMP, IMPEACH TRUMP, 
CONFIRM ON THE RECORD THAT NONE 
OF THAT OCCURRED ON AN OFFICIAL 
AT THE EYE DEVICE OR OFFICIAL 
OF THE EYE TIME. 
-- FBI DEVICE OR FBI TIME. 
>> YOU MEANT TO SAY THAT WHEN 
YOU NEVER CROSSED THAT LINE YOU 
MEANT TO SAY EXCEPT FOR 50,000 
TIMES HUNDREDS OF TIMES A DAY 
WHERE I WENT BACK AND FORTH 
EXPRESSING MY PERSONAL OPINIONS 
OF OUT TRUMP AND STOPPING 
TRUMP, AND IMPEACHING TRUMP, ON 
OFFICIAL FBI BONES AND OFFICIAL 
FBI TIME. 
OTHER THAN THAT -- PHONES AND 
OTHER OFFICIAL FBI TIME OTHER 
THAN THAT THERE BEAMING WITH 
PRIDE ON HOW CLEARLY YOU HAVE 
DRAWN THAT LINE. 
ARE YOU STARTING TO UNDERSTAND 
WHY SOME FOLKS OUT THERE DON'T 
BELIEVE A WORD USED DAY AND WHY 
IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING THAT 
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE ARE AT THE 
CENTER OF THE THREE HIGHEST 
PROFILE INVESTIGATIONS IN 
RECENT TIMES THAT INVOLVE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THAT YOU 
WERE IN CHARGE OF AN 
INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATING 
GATHERING EVIDENCE AGAINST 
DONALD TRUMP A SUBJECT THAT YOU 
HATE AND THAT YOU WANT TO STOP 
 
DO YOU SEE WHY THAT MIGHT CALL 
INTO QUESTION EVERY THING YOU 
HAVE TOUCHED ON ALL OF THOSE 
INVESTIGATION. 
I AM DONE WITH THIS WITNESS. 
I YIELD BACK. 
>> THERE ARE SEVERAL QUESTIONS. 
>> THERE ARE SEVERAL STATEMENT 
I ONLY HEARD ONE QUESTION. 
>> I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE 
MIGHT THINK THAT BASED ON THE 
REPRESENTATIONS IN THE MEDIA. 
I AM GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY 
PUBLICLY. I'M GLAD TO HEAR 
PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR THE 
RECENT -- RELEASE OF MY PRIVATE 
INTERVIEW. 
PEOPLE CAN JUDGE FOR 
THEMSELVES. 
WHO I AM AND WHAT I SAID ON THE 
FAX. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING 
MISREPRESENTATIVE. 
ABSOLUTELY I CAN UNDERSTAND 
THAT AND I'M GLAD THAT THE 
FACTS ARE COMING OUT. 
I NEVER, AND I AM UNAWARE OF 
ANY CASE BEING OPEN THAT 
REPRESENTED SOME VIOLATION OF 
SEVERAL LIBERTIES -- CIVIL 
LIBERTIES AND DUE PROCESS 
RIGHTS. 
I'VE NEVER DONE ANY ACTIVITY OR 
OPENED ANY CASE WITH REGARD TO 
THAT. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTEXT 
DURING THE TIME THAT THE 
DIRECTOR HAD BEEN FIRED, WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THAT 
HAD OCCURRED BECAUSE OF A 
MEMORANDUM WRITTEN BY THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE CLINTON 
INVESTIGATION AND THE DAYS 
AFTERWARDS PIVOTING RUSSIAN 
DIPLOMATS HAD A HUGE BURDEN 
TAKEN OFF THE SHOULDER. 
THE PACE AND SEVERITY AND THE 
FACTS THAT WERE UNFOLDING. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 
>> IN THAT REGARD BEFORE THINGS 
CHANGE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO US. 
>> TO YOUR RESPONSE HOWEVER, 
AND THE INTEREST OF FULL 
TRANSPARENCY AND TO MR. 
RADCLIFFE'S POINT WERE YOU 
AUTHORIZED THE RELEASE OF ALL 
OF THE OTHER TEXT MESSAGES THAT 
HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED TO THE 
CONGRESS TO THIS POINT? 
>> I WOULD AUTHORIZE THE 
RELEASE OF ANY WORK-RELATED 
TEXT MESSAGES OUT MESSAGES. 
>> EVEN THOUGH YOUR TESTIMONY 
IS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER LET 
YOUR WORK INTERFERE WITH YOUR 
PERSONAL OPINION. 
>> THAT IS EXACTLY MY 
TESTIMONY. 
>> HOW ARE WE GOING TO KNOW 
THAT UNLESS WE SEE THOSE TEXT 
MESSAGES? 
>> SO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, 
VERY CAREFULLY, AN INDEPENDENT 
BODY WENT EXHAUSTIVELY THROUGH 
THE ENTIRE OF THAT BODY AND 
FOUND THERE WERE NO ACTS OF -- 
>> ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WILL YOU 
AUTHORIZE RELEASE OF THEM TO 
THE YOU TAITS CONGRESS? 
>> NO, SIR. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, POINT OF 
INQUIRY, I'M TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND HIS ANSWER. 
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL DID NOT SEE 
WHAT HE IS CLAIMING TO BE HIS 
PERSONAL TEXTS THAT THEY WERE 
REQUESTED AND HE DELIVERED WHAT 
HE SAID WAS BUSINESS RELATED, 
SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, 
NO ONE HAS SEEN ANYTHING THAT 
HE DETERMINED, MR. STRZOK 
DETERMINED WOULD NOT BE 
DELIVERED BECAUSE IN HIS 
OPINION THEY WERE NOT BUSINESS 
RELATED, I HAVE A NUMBER OF 
TEXTS IN FRONT OF ME THAT I 
WOULD SAY WERE VERY PERSONAL 
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT 
UNDOUBTEDLY HE WOULD HAVE 
OBJECTED TO TURNING OVER. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN MAKES A VERY 
GOOD POINT. 
HE MAY WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THAT WHEN HE IS SHORTLY 
TO BE RECOGNIZED. 
BUT FIRST WE'RE GOING TO 
RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM 
TEXAS, MS. JACKSON LEE FOR FIVE 
MINUTES. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
I'M SORRY MY COLLEAGUE WALKED 
OUT BEFORE MR. STRZOK COULD 
GIVE HIS ANSWERS. 
I HATE NO ONE. 
I DO NOT HATE THE 
ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESIDENT, 
MY COLLEAGUES. 
IN FACT, I LOVE THIS NATION. 
I HONOR THIS NATION. 
AND SO I BELIEVE IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE STAND ON THE 
FORCE OF TRUTH IN THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
IN THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE TWO 
COMMITTEES, IT IS UNFORTUNATE 
THAT NONE OF THESE COMMITTEES 
JUDICIARY OVERSIGHT HAVE 
DECIDED TO PURSUE MORE PRECIOUS 
OR MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAN 
ASKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S 
E-MAILS WHICH HAVE BEEN WELL 
DOCUMENTED THAT THERE WAS NO 
CRIMINAL IMPACT AND IN ESSENCE 
SHE WAS VINDICATED BY THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT AND 
BY OTHER REPORTS. 
UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS BECOME A 
FISHING EXPEDITION. 
WHAT WE HAVE NOT DONE -- WHAT 
WE HAVE NOT DONE IS INVESTIGATE 
THE CHILDREN BEING STOLEN AWAY 
FROM THEIR FAMILIES, NOR HAVE 
WE LOOKED AT OUR PRESIDENT 
MEETING WITH MR. PUTIN GETTING 
HIS ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW 
WHILE OFFENDING OUR NATO 
ALLIES. 
FOREIGN POLICY SCHOLARS ARE 
AGHAST THAT THIS PRESIDENT -- 
>> EVERYONE, WELCOME BACK TO 
CBSN, I'M REENA NINAN. 
YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO F.B.I. 
AGENT PETER STRZOK'S TESTIMONY 
ON CAPITOL HILL WHERE HE'S BEEN 
GRILLED ABOUT ANTI-TRUMP TEXTS 
THAT HE SENT DURING THE 2016 
ELECTION. 
STRZOK WAS PART OF THE MUELLER 
PROBE BUT WAS DISMISSED AFTER 
THOSE TEXTS WERE REVEALED. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE ON 
THIS HEARING IN JUST A MOMENT. 
>>> WELL, WE BEGIN THIS HOUR 
WITH FALLOUT FROM THE 
PRESIDENT'S NATO SUMMIT AND HIS 
UPCOMING TALKS WITH AMERICA'S 
CLOSEST ALLY, ENGLAND AND ITS 
FIRST VISIT TO THE COUNTRY 
SINCE TAKING OFFICE. 
YOU SEE HIM THERE ARRIVING WITH 
THE FIRST LADY. 
THIS WAS EARLIER. 
TOMORROW THE PRESIDENT WILL 
ALSO MEET WITH BRITISH PRIME 
MINISTER THERESA MAY AND ALSO 
THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND. 
BUT WIDESPREAD PROTESTS ARE 
EXPECTED. 
AND THIS COMES AFTER A SERIES 
OF TENSE MEETINGS AT THE ANNUAL 
NATO SUMMIT. 
MR. TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY 
SLAMMED ALLIES FOR NOT DOING 
THEIR FAIR SHARE. 
WELL, THIS MORNING HE PRESSURED 
THEM TO INCREASE DEFENSE 
SPENDING WHILE REAFFIRMING THE 
U.S.' 
COMMITMENT TO THE ALLIANCE. 
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SUGGESTED 
THAT THEY AGREED TO HIS FUNDING 
DEMANDS. 
BUT NOW SOME LEADERS ARE 
SAYING, NO, THAT WAS ACTUALLY 
NOT THE CASE. 
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD 
TO SAY. 
>> AND THE UNITED STATES' 
COMMITMENT TO NATO IS VERY 
STRONG, REMAINS VERY STRONG, 
BUT PRIMARILY BECAUSE EVERYONE, 
THE SPIRIT THEY HAVE, THE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY'RE WILLING 
TO SPEND, THE ADDITIONAL MONEY 
THAT THEY WILL BE PUTTING UP 
HAS BEEN REALLY, REALLY AMAZING 
TO SEE IT, TO SEE THE LEVEL OF 
SPIRIT IN THAT ROOM IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
>> JOINING ME NOW RETIRED 
GENERAL PHILIP BREEDLOVE. 
HE'S A FORMER SUPREME ALLIED 
COMMANDER OF EUROPE WHICH IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF NATO 
MILITARY OPERATIONS. 
HE'S ALSO A CYFHER BRIEF 
EXPERT. 
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING 
YOU US. 
IT WAS JOB TO MAKE SURE THE MEN 
AND WOMEN OF NATO WERE PROPERLY 
FUNDED, MADE SURE THEY HAD THE 
SUPPORT THEY NEEDED. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON PRESSURE 
POINTS THAT THEY DON'T MEET 
FUNDING COMMITMENTS? 
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 
THAT WE DO BRING OUR ALLIES TO 
A POINT WHERE THEY'RE INVESTING 
MORE IN THEIR MILITARIES, AND 
I'VE BEEN NOTED TO SAY BEFORE 
THAT SOMETIMES I DON'T TOTALLY 
AGREE WITH THE TACTICS, 
TECHNIQUES OR PROCEDURES THAT 
OUR PRESIDENT MAY USE, BUT THE 
BOTTOM LINE IS IN I WANT 
LECTUAL HONESTY, WE HAVE TO -- 
INTELLECTUAL HONESTY, WE HAVE 
TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHERE OUR THREE 
PREDECESSORS HAVE FAILED, THIS 
PRESIDENT HAS MOVED THE NEEDLE 
ON INVESTMENT BY OUR NATO 
ALLIES. 
THERE'S STILL A LOT TO BE DONE 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS 
MORNING'S EMERGENCY MEETING WAS 
ALL ABOUT, TO GET SORT OF A 
RECOMMITMENT TO SPEEDING UP 
THAT INVESTMENT TO THE 2% OF 
G.D.P. 
LEVEL. 
>> SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE 
GIVING THE PRESIDENT A WIN ON 
THE SCOREBOARD FOR GETTING THAT 
MILITARY SPENDING INCREASED A 
BIT. 
BUT IN PARTICULAR, YOU'VE ALSO 
SAID THAT ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT NATO IS 
ACTUALLY THE SOLIDARITY AMONG 
THE DIFFERENT NATIONS. 
DO YOU THINK THAT SENSE OF 
SOLIDARITY HAS BEEN BLUDGEONED 
BY THE PRESIDENT? 
>> SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY 
KEY QUESTION BECAUSE WHEN ASKED 
IN THE CYPHER BRIEF AND OTHERS 
WHAT I THINK WOULD BE A 
SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT, ITEM ONE IS 
ALWAYS THE SOLIDARITY OF THE 
ALLIANCE,
