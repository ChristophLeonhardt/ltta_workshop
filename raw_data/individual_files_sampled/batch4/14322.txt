allowing censorship for having dissenting ideas that's pretty suicidal isn't it for a perpetual minority here's my framing in the Jewish news let me quote he says were they describing him they say you can add mark Freeman to the list of people who think it's time to resurrect section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act or something like it in order to combat hate speech the controversial section which addressed online manifestations of hate speech was repealed in 2013 but not too long ago a representative of the free speech group n Canada suggested that it was time for Canada to introduce a new law and dress hate speech that came after reports that the federal government was considering introducing legislation that would revive section 13 that pen Canada extremists that was mentioned there that's Omar Muallim a Muslim supremacist who has called for the censorship of the rebel and of me personally and mark Freeman's good to go with that you're just a bit more from the story those are changes that frame and would welcome both federally and in the province of Ontario Freeman who served as Deputy Attorney General of Ontario from 2000 to 2004 said that in recent years there has been a troubling resurgence of hate propaganda and the vilification of minority groups in Canada that's the situation that cannot be allowed to continue if we want to hold true to our core Canadian principles that place a high value on the dignity and worth of all human beings he said just a little bit more hate speech is on the rise hate speech is a form of poison we regulate poison in all kinds of speech that carries harm this is the kind of speech that carries danger he said almost done Freeman who also served as the president of the narrative front Canadian Jewish Congress made his views known in the panel discussion that looked at the future of Canadian law in the absence of section 13 okay enough from him but look at that and look at him he's a holdover from another era from the 70s or in the 80s maybe when government could censor things when when to communicate you had to have a physical printing press or a TV station now try censoring anything today in the this world of the internet and smartphones you'll never outlaw hates by the way let alone communication because hate is an innate emotion that every one of us has it's abnormal to never feel the emotion of hate you can't pass a law to ban an emotion and one man's hate speech is another man's passionate speech that's why we regulate harmful actions like hitting people or threatening people with violence but merely hating well how does it fit into our legal system but here's my point it's 2018 now the Muslim population of Canada is want 1.5 million people and it's young and aggressive and confident and it believes in itself canada's jews like mark freeman 350,000 low birthrate high intermarriage very few were actually religious too too many jews being jewish is a bit like a club maybe once a year you go to a synagogue but probably not it's a loose affiliation with no enduring or transcendent meaning imagine then that an aging out-of-date Jewish ethnic politician like Mark Freeman would actually get his way here and would bring back a hate speech law who do you think would use that hate speech law and who do you think that hate speech law would be used against I've often said that Jews have a suicidal gene in them we do things against our own interests there are hardcore left-wing Jews who are for open border migration of Muslims who are anti-semites even terrorists and here you have an old Jewish political hack who couldn't be more eager to bring in censorship laws it would immediately be used against us against eyeness against any righteous Gentile concerned about Sharia law or terrorism to answer my earlier question they would all be Muslim complaints always against Jews our scientists like I was like mark Stein was that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
