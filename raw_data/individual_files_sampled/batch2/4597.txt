another top story tonight involves the president United States reportedly threatening to retaliate against national security veterans because they criticized him this is not normal and we should note it is being done in plain sight today the White House admitted it has plans to revoke security clearances based on what certain people have said about democracy politics and Trump which of course would be their First Amendment right here is White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders depicting the exercise of those free speech rights as quote politicizing public service the president is threatening to punish Brennan and Comey and clapper for saying things about him that he doesn't like the president is exploring these mechanisms to Raziel remove security clearance because they've politicized and in some cases actually monetized their public service and their security cleanse clearances no I think you are creating your own story there the former Intel chief James clapper responding today I think this is just a very very petty petty thing to do I think that's a terrible president's and it's a very sad commentary keyword there is abuse you have an intelligence chief saying president Trump is abusing his power over classified information to basically punish dissent which of course builds on Donald Trump's very unprecedented public attacks on many former officials if you look at clapper he sort of admitted that they had spies in the campaign I think James Comey has got a lot of problems if you look at what he did if you look at all of the lies the tremendous lies I think James Comey has got a lot of problems it's been terrible you look at Brennan you look at clapper you look at Hayden you get Comey you look at mccabe take a look at all of the shenanigans that have gone on very hard to have confidence in that group i have no confidence in a guy like Brett and i think he's a total lowlife i have no confidence in clapper here are six of the former national security officials the white house is targeting their our intelligence and FBI officials plus former CIA director Brennan who full disclosure is now an analyst for NBC News but the most important thing here that those people may have in common is they are all witnesses against the president in an open criminal probe Comey McCabe and Brennan for example involved in critical Russia meetings during Donald Trump's transition so this move may actually be even worse than potentially punishing them for what they have said this may be an attempt out in the open to discredit them over what they saw and what they could potentially tell prosecutors I'm joined now by Michael Steele a former RNC chair and David Priest former CIA intelligence officer who has given Bob Muller the morning intelligence briefing and is the author of the president's book of Secrets David is this appropriate it's not appropriate and it's not historically precedented because we don't have examples of former officials in the national security arena being attacked by removing security clearances so that they can't continue to talk to their old colleagues about classified matters I can think of only one example and that was the example of sandy Berger who is the national security adviser back for Bill Clinton and he had a three-year suspension of his security clearance but that was for a very specific act he was caught removing materials from the National Archives when he was going over them for the 9/11 Commission and then he lied to investigators about what he did with those documents he remove I didn't he put like those documents in his socks or something it was rumored that he put them in his socks and underwear later on it came out it was a suit pocket but either way he's smuggling documents out so there is a similarity there which is his security clearance was removed and he was unable to do things in classified spaces well and Michael Steele else is different okay okay the only thing that go in the suit pocket when you're coming out of the archives is a nice well-placed hankie like the one you have today my friend you've got it baby now let me stipulate this Michael there are people who've left government that are being perfectly political in their remarks take a look at some of Jamie's commis latest electoral advice he says Democrats don't lose your mind and rush to the Socialist Left all people who believe in this country's values must vote for Democrats this fall I'll tell you Michael I think that strikes me as a rather political an absurd statement people have all kinds of values and make up their own mind about their vote so let's stipulate that James Comey is firing off like he's in a nice blog comment section but certainly whether one agrees with that or not it shouldn't be grounds for a security clearance several these officials say they don't have clearances to be revoked right now that the White House didn't do its homework but what do you think well unless there's a regulation or some guideline for former individuals in there at that position that they cannot participate in public discourse because they have access to classified information you're talking about individuals in their free speech rights you may not like what mr. Comey says or mr. clapper or anyone else has to say but that doesn't just because they served as a former DNI or a former national security adviser or whatever doesn't preclude their free speech rights once they leave that position it has nothing to do with their responsibilities under current law and regulation to be a part of that network of individuals who get continued classified briefings so this has boils down to one simple thing the president is pissed because these folks are out there talking smack about what he's doing at the White House day you know he doesn't like it he can't strike at them because he does that they don't work for him so he can do the one thing though go at the one Nexus they have to his administration and if you will and that is that they still get these classified briefings right I think that makes perfect sense Michael what you're saying and it goes to the fact that this seems to be at times a very emotional president who is breaking the rules and doing things that experts say undermine national security because there's something that as you put it makes him upset he's also reportedly upset about a current LJ's professional who said I think what was on his mind I don't think he was saying anything that wasn't true at the time but the White House is you know reportedly very upset over mr. Coates comments here take a look I do want to say we have some breaking news the White House has announced on Twitter that Vladimir Putin is coming to the White House in the fall that's gonna be special now coach says my admittedly awkward response in no way meant to be disrespectful or criticize the actions of the president all awkward laughter aside Michael this country's gone to war over the misuse and politicization of intelligence or pressure on the intelligence agencies to come up with results to please the president so isn't this bad yeah it is I mean I think the fact that you have you know someone of his stature not involved in the conversation he's getting from a reporter that the president has made a decision that he should be involved in what kind of reaction do you expect him to have if he's gonna sit there and pretend that he knows that this was about to take place with Putin and then when folks like you and others do their job and find out well no you didn't know that he's caught in a lie so he did the right thing now he's got to walk it back but it's still to your pointer it goes to the underlying truth of this administration the pressure that you're seeing now put on you know special access to the White House through security briefings or pushing back on the DNI has to do with the pressure that's coming from the investigation by robert muller this thing is getting tighter the president is reacting and and being very reactive to it in a way that I think he's showing a lot more than he probably would want to otherwise ari let me build on something Michael said which is on the dan coates point dan coates is a an exemplary human being he's one of the nicest people that I've that and in fact in his confirmation hearings to be DNI the main objection raised to him being gay and I was are you gonna be tough enough to bang heads together to get things done in the Intel community because it was admittedly awkward on stage is not the fault of Dan Coates that's the fault of the White House which let him go onto a stage in a live event without even telling him not only what had gone on in the Helsinki meeting which he said he had not been informed about but without telling him that there was going to be this policy announcement about the visit all of the awkwardness should be on the part of the White House officials that put him in that position rather than on dan coates himself you make a great point about the the projection he didn't play himself he was played by his bosses who didn't do them the basic professional process of mentioning as you say a giant intelligence matter that was going to be announced David priests michael steele thank you both hey I'm already melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
