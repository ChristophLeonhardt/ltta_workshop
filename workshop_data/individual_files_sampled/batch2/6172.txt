senators Jeff Flake and Chris Coons were on 60 minutes and fleek said something really interesting about what key would do if he were seeking re-election now he was specifically commenting on the FBI investigation involving Brett Kavanaugh and if you can recall flake did something pretty remarkable last Friday when during the Senate Judiciary Committee's voting session on Kavanagh he called for this FBI investigation now it was after two sexual assault victims approached him and confronted him at an elevator but nonetheless here's what flake had said during this session to vote for Kavanagh as confirmation and I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week in order to let the FBI continue to do an investigation limited in time and scope to the current allegations that are there and limit in time to no more than one week so that was unexpected it was surprising and he was asked about it while appearing on 60 minutes and here is what he had to say senator flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this if you were running no you're not a chance not a chance no no because politics has become too sharp too partisan there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive I think that that's both super obvious and in a sense a startling admission at the same time so it's and I know that the interviewer there is doing a good job of drawing out the answer and so I don't think he's actually startled but it frames it that way and in a lot of the conversations on television it is assumed that these are good honorable people that are actually have their own opinions on our acting based on their ideology and principles rather than political expediency and that is a super annoying and I've ously massively wrong assumption and here here you have two senators are Republican and Democrat both you know nodding their head to this and the Republicans saying if I was up for election of course I would have done the dishonorable thing of course I would have done the thing that I don't believe it of course I would have tried to block the truth of course of course so it's it's just and then why do so why do I say it's a startling admission because you the politicians almost never admit it this is flake on his way out going what did you guys think we were doing of course we're not gonna ever reach across the aisle and so this is why like it's so frustrating Anna because when Obama was president for eight years we said on this show stop trying to reach across the aisle why because we're doing likewise or will punish you if you do that no because it is obviously not reciprocal and anyone paying a modicum of attention to politics in today's environment understands that the Republicans will never reciprocate because it's and it is a ridiculous naive proposition that they have real principles and that they're making decisions based on anything but politics and by the way a lot of political expediency it's not just about the votes it's about whatever their donors told him to do that's the people who determine whether they're gonna get elected more than anyone else so for Obama I they have played into that force for about six out of his eight years as president was atrocious that he was wrong I don't know if he did it on purpose and he was just winking and nodding like haha play along because I actually want the Republicans to halfway win or if he was really that ridiculously naive and the entire Democratic establishment went along with that and the entire media went along with that can I get an apology now you were wrong and we were right the Republicans were never ever going to bend and it is about politics it's never about their principles so having beer summits with them is this honestly the dumbest biggest waste of time so one thing that I have so many thoughts on this so one thing that stood out to me about flakes decision and his actions on Friday was see it already internally realized that he wanted the FBI investigation he actually decided to step outside with senator Coons and discuss it with him and so as you know Coons is a Democrat and there are actually genuinely friends which I did not buy into before but I looked into it further and they are their friends and and the fact that they're willing to work together you know would give me some hope if flake didn't give up right I look and I don't agree with flake on 99% of things but the fact that he's willing to look at a situation like this through the eyes of a human as opposed to a Republican it is a good thing now let me just put that aside real quick no I know but it's just again he's saying I wouldn't have done that I wouldn't have done the right thing if I was seeking reelection so so let's address that as you guys know when it comes to Kavanagh like I've mentioned the corporate donut donors he's a very business friendly corporate friendly judge and I think that's one of the main reasons why there's this you know urgency to push him through that in addition to the fact that he would probably help Trump in this whole Moeller investigation but there's also a third issue here right and that is the voters Jake you shared that survey that poll that showed that the majority of Republican voters would still want to confirm Brett Kavanaugh even if he did do this even if he was found guilty of these accusations what does that mean I mean they're doing this based on partisanship right they're not they're not doing this because they think that Brett Kavanaugh is a good guy or that they don't genuinely think that these accusations are horrible they're doing this because Kavanaugh is their guy and they're gonna support him no matter what and so what are lawmakers supposed to do when voters are like this yeah and and now here's where the media will again do false equivalency and they'll say well you guys are driving people to the left no no we're driving to them to the center based on actual polling there's a giant difference between my Republican donor told me I have to fill in the blank start a giant war give a giant tax cut to the rich make sure Cavanaugh is approved because he votes with corporations nearly every single time comes up and is one of the most draconian judges against employee rights in the whole country so appealing to those donors and by the way a lot of Democrats to do likewise it's totally different than actually appealing to your voters well my voters don't want me to because Social Security and Medicare yeah of course you should be responsive to that it'd be crazy not to be responsive to that by the way a lot of the mainstream media and the corporate Democrats do push you to be non-responsive to your voters they go how dare you we need bipartisanship not on anything that would helped Americans but on things that would hurt America's it would be true bipartisanship to cut Social Security and Medicare but the left doesn't want a student know 84% of the country doesn't want you to that's a poll that's reality that's etc now the Republicans on the other hand driven almost purely by corporate donor interests say no no no no no based on what those billionaire and and and multibillion-dollar corporations won that is a completely different animal so please stop having disingenuous conversations and I laid this out as a marker now flake just admitted it now we all know it's not what do you think flakes different do you think that the other Republicans are more principled no one in their right mind believes that right so will the media now adjust and go oh well of course the politicians are doing things I'm based on politics right and based on their donors wishes not based on what their voters want no they will never admit it they will ignore this this is the last time you'll see it in the meat in the mainstream media I mean look I see a little more of a willingness to call out the politics but definitely not the corporate donors you you hear very little talk if any talk about corporate donors and how much they influence these lawmakers to do the things that they do but one other thing that flake touched on that I thought was interesting was the issue of perjury now Kavanagh has been accused of lying on multiple occasions let's just focus purely on the last hearing that happened involving dr. Blasi Ford totally minimized his drinking lied about the Renata alumni reference in his yearbook I mean one lie after the other and so flake was asked you know what do you think about this what if he's found to have lied what would you do let's take a look if judge Cavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over oh yes I would think so no I don't believe them yeah yeah I mean look it's a totally fine line of questioning it's this you know fits good a job is mainstream press is gonna do I know I I'm sorry for that sounds kind of sending but look and and you wouldn't get the interview otherwise let's just keep it real too but if I was asking Jeff Flake questions and and there's a reason why he wouldn't come and do an interview with me I would say well okay senator flake you really believe that the devil's triangle is a drinking game or do you think that perhaps judge Cavanaugh lied about it you really believe that the Renata alumnus is a reference to how much they respected that one woman that 14 guys referenced in their yearbook do you really believe that or do you believe that might have been perjury do you really believe that his you know references to I mean you can go on and on ralphing a poof whatever doof whatever it is right do you believe any of those things do you believe that his drinking was not in excess when almost all of his classmates say that he regularly drank to excess and was stumbling drunk and aggressive and when he when he drank we have all these witnesses who counted that he claims it's just a normal drinker I mean look this that switch drives me crazy about Cavanaugh and what leads me to believe that he's lying about everything because he didn't have to lie about any of those things right no one cares if you drank a lot in college I know you're trying to protect yourself well if I drank a lot and I might have blacked out you might think that I did this thing I understand that whole context but if he said look guys I didn't do the sexual assault but yeah I drank way too much in college no one would have cared but he's a natural liar and he has said you know let alone two political eyes the Pickering Manuel Miranda lies from earlier hearings so it's not sure that flake thinks lying would disqualify him I guess what he's alluding to if I'm going to be generous to him is if he lied about the sexual assault then that would be disqualifying and yes if they prove that I would imagine it would be disqualifying for a lot of people not just play right yeah I mean look if that's what he's being specific about it wasn't clear and that answer but remember that senate judiciary committee vote happened the day after that special hearing involving dr. Blasi Ford's testimony and it was so clear that he was lying in that case so clear I mean there were so many references by the way one reference that you know we just didn't have time to get to last week when we covered all of his lies was that he kept reiterating that when he was 18 at that point in Maryland it was legal to drink no it wasn't no it wasn't at that point the law had already changed to 21 and older yes see that's exactly what I'm talking about what it what a ridiculous lie because it's such a minor issue in this case quite literally who cares you drank is a minor no one cares why does he lie about that no cuz I'm I did everything right I did I was a choir boy I didn't drink excess I didn't drink when I was a minor I never worked the law why cuz he's lying at least lying about this this and this I mean I'm again it's not a great guy to quote but James Comey now iPad saying when you're an investigator little eyes usually our indication of much bigger lies and he lies about every little thing when he doesn't need to it's almost like an instinct I think I've seen that somewhere else before Trump so but look I this FBI investigation it's we're all on the edge of our seats the whole country I think is on the edge of our seat if they do a real one my guess is they will expose many different lies here look I'll give you a sense of what's coming up next they're talking to Debbie Ramirez the one who made allegation about him exposing Cavanaugh exposing himself to her and putting your penis in front of her face while they were drinking she thank you a list of the people at the party hmm if they get one person to confirm that that's exactly what happened bad news for Cavanaugh now look if they get no.1 and people say we were at the party and it didn't happen good news for Cavanaugh so we're all night of our seat two easy ways following Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos
