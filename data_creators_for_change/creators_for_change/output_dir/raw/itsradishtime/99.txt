00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
hi friends so NASA just announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,570
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be opening up astronaut</font>

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,850
applications to the public and thousands

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people are going to apply to be</font>

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">launched into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the vastness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and emptiness</font>

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,660
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the universe but why though</font>

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,750
admittedly I haven't always understood

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,359
the human obsession with space there may

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been a not so nuanced essay that I</font>

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,850
wrote in fifth grade arguing that the

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,980
government pull funding from NASA and

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,320
put it into education and I certainly

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not explain to you any of the</font>

14
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,820
major plot points of the original Star

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,489
Wars trilogy despite having seen them

16
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,910
all maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than once I can sing the</font>

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,190
Ewok song though but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wonder</font>

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,940
what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in us as a collective species</font>

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,390
that inspires this fascination white art

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,239
and track and study these tiny shining

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,850
specks in the sky why strap ourselves to

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,039
explosives and launch ourselves into

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,770
cold and darkness sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> two very</font>

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,350
disastrous effects there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,899
science to science right here right so

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,770
why space now I've dug myself into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,450
of a Wikipedia cavern where I've become

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,060
like highly obsessed with the original

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,090
mercury 7 space bros like that first

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,130
guinea pig cruel Americans to launch

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,110
themselves into orbit and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

32
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,020
this like bravado and self-importance

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,970
that must have motivated those first

34
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,750
missions we built<font color="#E5E5E5"> this grand like</font>

35
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,390
fantastical story about what's out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

36
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,759
and how would conquer the universe and

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,799
who would get there first think about

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,040
how someone like Alan Shepard the first

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,460
American in space would possess the

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,610
nerve like sitting in a tin can<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

41
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,369
spacecraft having wet his pants because

42
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,619
the people at NASA kind of forgot to

43
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">even consider that that might be a thing</font>

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,420
still have the confidence in this whole

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,360
bananas project to just start off like

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,860
why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just fix your little</font>

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,140
problem and light this candle I wrote

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,940
that by the way

49
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,400
on a picture of the freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 rocket and</font>

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,470
put it above my desk to try and steal a

51
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,270
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of that bravery and keep it</font>

52
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">for myself but then I see that famous</font>

53
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,570
photo<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the blue marble taken the crew</font>

54
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,750
of the Apollo 17 that became legendary

55
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,750
in its<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to unify us all you know</font>

56
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,670
because from way out there in the cosmos

57
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,580
there's just this tiny swirly sphere

58
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,340
that has all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on it all of us and</font>

59
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,380
there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's such a trope</font>

60
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,730
that like two people separated by

61
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,040
unimaginable distance can both look up

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,530
at the same night sky and be seeing the

63
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,480
same thing and share some sort of

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,330
connection and experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so maybe</font>

65
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,030
we go to space to assert our power<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,370
courage and vastness but on the other

67
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">side just ahead turn away we see how</font>

68
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,540
small we are insignificant even and

69
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,610
deeply dependent on one another I've

70
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,290
never had a deep understanding of space

71
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,690
I'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there and I definitely</font>

72
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,610
have more of a fascination<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

73
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,200
people who go there than the thing

74
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,270
itself but I think I have a better sense

75
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,150
now that whatever it is that we see out

76
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,040
there whatever we believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> about space</font>

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,320
and why we study it is deeply human so I

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,239
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know in the comments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,040
think about space would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ever apply</font>

80
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,110
to be an astronaut if your space person

81
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,090
please tell me what most excites you

82
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,160
