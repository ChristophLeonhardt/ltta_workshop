survivors it's been getting worse man imagine how he's going to be now now that he knows he has the votes but anyway he tweeted this morning about some of the activists who've been speaking out against Kavanagh he said this the very rude elevator streamers are paid professionals only looking to make senators look bad don't fall for it also look at all the professionally made identical signs paid for by Soros and others these are not signs made in the basement from love you hashtag troublemakers don't forget the best part hashtag troublemakers there he's talking about the protesters in general but specifically the two women who spoke with Jeff Flake last week and in a way that I can't even imagine how you could do it just very honestly openly talked about what had happened to them about their own experiences with rape and assault and so their elevator screamers paid professionals so I want you guys to talk specifically about this but also let's just bear in mind this is another example of the President of the United States the most powerful force in the world just makes up conspiracy theories it just says him doesn't care to find out what's the evidence that they're paid professionals that they're doing this that all of this protest is not organic at all these women are lying about their sexual assault like imagine if Obama had said things like that about the tea party or whoever of course he didn't do it Ben suit or he wore a tan suit or if he did a terrorist fist jab with his wife or something like that so we just accept it we have a conspiracy theorist as president that's awesome but we still have not gotten used to this kind of casual form of talking to us like from the Oval Office I just haven't gotten used to that still just even there and not even getting into what do you say if things just looking at this message I have not used to that young there was the fireside chat and this is like the fire sale chat like okay the garbage fire chat garbage yeah the dumpster fire disaster fire truck the dumpster fireside chat okay back to one you remember the fireside chat these are the dumpster fireside chats and that's what it is yeah we uh I know that that some people are like you know what why do you guys get so bothered by this or whatever part of the frustration is seeing it play out after spending 18 months desperately trying to get people to realize how bad things would be under Donald Trump and now seeing it every day and not being able to just put our heads in the ground and pretend that it's not happening but to see and I tweeted something about this yesterday that we as a culture just we look for the worst examples of humanity and we shower them with wealth and power and fame even making them the most powerful person in the executive branch elevating them to the most powerful positions in the judicial branch people like Lindsey Graham these are the most powerful senators in the world they are the worst people that we can find and to also have it shouted in her face every morning as this guy continually attacks again I guess even I like we're doing this story he's all he's doing here is attacking victims of rape the president united states is saying these goddamn rape victims are getting in our faces and I'm not gonna take it anymore that is what our president spends his day doing and that was when he thought he might not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh god only knows tonight or tomorrow when he does a rally what he is gonna say about Christine Blasi Ford like it up until this point it's been his supporters in the media and on Twitter who are calling them lying sluts but is it impossible to the president United States would tweet that that his son is gonna tweet that enthusiastically after this don't rule it out don't rule it out well cuz I kind of like that everyone almost like a large majority of what I've seen they don't want you to be not supporting a sexual assault victim so that's why everyone's sort of kind of turning like a different corner and manipulating the conversation into what I don't believe them if they were real they would be worth listening to if she were telling the truth she would be worth listening to and then we can have a different discussion on Kavanagh it's these two women were telling the truth I would listen to them and they would deserve my respect but everything I'm doing is okay because they're bought and paid for they're lying even Jeff Lincoln that interview with the Atlantic said you know kind of like alluded to the idea that they were politically motivated you know and so they're it's all kind of like um no no listen we're not bad people we don't believe them if we believed them if they were telling the truth this would be a whole different conversation in its just go listen to the elevator screamer just go back right now and listen to the elevator screamer a is she's like screaming uncontrollably does she look like oh did she sound like a paid shill she sound like a Paige children how how good how well would you have to be paid to actor that well I don't know I get paid less as a Jew in media I have a helicopter spoke with Soros on the side that I jump in I actually run up and just grab it's hovering and I grab the bottom and we just kind of go away into the into the nothing you're doing well I'm a page chill thank you by the way for mentioning the Soros angle cuz I actually forgot about that mostly it's about the the hating the women who've been raped there's there's a little bit of anti-semitism there to abuse that this is further abusing you know survivors slash victims of horrible behavior horrible things yeah it's kind of awful it's all I have this even come out of your mouth for anyone but that's what percent they but that's how it works it is the media savvy of the other side here's what happened with Christine Blasi Ford she gave a devastating series of statements responses to questions during that her testimony devastating but it wasn't as viral as like beer I like beer do you like beer I love beer do you right and there's and so what happened in that case in the case of Christine Bazzi for and in the case of these women who confronted Jeff Flake and gave on both of undeniably moving of course they're serious of course they're real statements yeah in the face of that all that Trump did was wait 48 hours yeah that's all he did totally and was like Oh Christine Blasi Ford uh where was she blah blah blah where was she upstairs or downstairs sherry sent upstairs you piece of crap she said it so many times so many times he said but he says you're gonna listen to me now rehash it because it's been 48 hours with the women who confronted flake Oh it's been 48 hours now their elevator screamers paid for by Soros yeah hating me and he's surrounded of course by people who are never gonna disagree with him on literally anything and as he but let's let's just briefly go back to the beginning of this national nightmare when he descended down that golden elevator he was descending to a bunch of paid supporters they paid $12,000 $50 a head to bring people in to cheer for him now eventually he would get enough you know racists and bigots and all that to come enthusiastically to his things but at that point he actually paid a group $12,000 people forget about that and so again it's projection as it so often is but I don't want to leave you with his comments I want to leave you with the response by one of the two women that was actually talking to Jeff Flake in that video as annamaria arkillo who said no one can pay for someone's lived experiences the pain the trauma and the rage that I expressed when I spoke with Senator Jeff Flake and an elevator were my own and I held it for more than thirty years to protect the people I love from it so thank you again annamaria for what you did I'm sorry that unfortunately you and so many others will continually be victimized by this absolute garbage human that we've made president the TYT Plus app is now available on iOS and Android download to get more TYT content at TYT comm slash app
