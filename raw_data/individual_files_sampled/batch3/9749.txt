OR DRAMA IS NEARING ABOUT. LELAND VITTERT HAS SOME INSIGHTS GO. BUT FIRST, FROM CAPITOL HILL, WHERE THE ACTION IS TONIGHT. CHAD, THE MAJORITY LEADER WHICH McCONNELL THAT FIRST STEP, HE WENT TO THE FLOOR TO MOVE FORWARD THIS CONFIRMATION VOTE, SO WHAT KIND OF TIMELINE? THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL INITIATED A FOUR-DAY PROCESS. HE'S REPEATEDLY SAID HE WANTS TO HAVE THE CONFIRMATION VOTE THIS WEEK. SO WE HAD TO INITIATE THIS PROCESS TONIGHT BEFORE MIDNIGHT AND WHAT HE DID HERE ON CAPITOL HILL IS FILING AN EFFORT TO LIMIT DEBATE. HE FILED THAT TONIGHT BURIED BY SENATE RULE, THAT NEEDS A DAY TO LAY OVER SO TOMORROW IT LAYS DORMANT AND THAT IT RIPENS LIKE A FRUIT ON FRIDAY. THAT MEANS IT'S AVAILABLE FOR A VOTE. THAT'S THE PROCEDURAL VOTE TO CUT OFF DEBATE. IN THESE 51. IN THE OLD DAYS, LASTER, 2017 WHEN THEY WERE DEALING WITH NEIL GORSUCH MITCH McCONNELL LOWERED THE BAR TO END FILIBUSTERS. IT USED TO BE 60, IT'S NOW DOWN TO 51 SO IF YOU HAVE INVOKED IT ON DAY THREE, FRIDAY, VOTED TO CUT OFF DEBATE, THEN A 30 HOUR CLOCK BEGINS TO RUN. THAT'S ALL THE TIME THAT THE MINORITY THAT OPPONENTS OF THE NOMINATION CAN CONSUME UNTIL IT CULMINATES IN A CONFIRMATION VOTE PROBABLY ON SATURDAY, 30 HOURS THEREAFTER. THE SENATE RULE SAYS YOU VOTE ON IT ONE AFTER YOU COME IN SO IT'S POSSIBLE THEY COULD HAVE COME IN FRIDAY MORNING AT 12:01 AND HAVE THAT PROCEDURAL VOTE AT 1:01 ON FRIDAY MORNING. Shannon: YOU AND I MAY BE HERE DOING THIS IF THAT HAPPENS ON FRIDAY NIGHT. WHERE DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND WITH VOTES ON EITHER SIDE NOW? IS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT THE MATH. YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THAT MANY TIMES BEFORE. LOOK AT THE TRIO. MITCH McCONNELL IS TO KEEP THE TRIO OF JEFF FLAKE, LISA MURKOWSKI, SUSAN COLLINS TOGETHER. IF HE KEEPS THEM TOGETHER HE GETS TO 51. IF HE LOSES ONE OF THOSE THREE HE'S RIGHT AT 50 AND MIKE PENCE, THE VICE PRESIDENT WOULD BREAK THE TIE. WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRATS? IT'S GENERALLY NOT BOUGHT THAT ANY DEMOCRAT WOULD VOTE TO CONFIRM BRETT KAVANAUGH UNLESS REPUBLICANS CAN DELIVER THE GOODS. THEY CARRY IT AND GET THEM ACROSS 51. I TALKED EARLIER WITH JOE MANSON, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA, HE IS IN PLAY. LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HIS BOAT. I'M LOOKING AT THE GENTLEMAN AS AN ADULT, 31 YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICE. I'M LOOKING AS A FATHER, AS A PERSON IN A COMMUNITY, HOW HE INTERACTS WITH HIS COMMUNITY. I'M TRYING TO PUT THE HUMAN SIDE TO IT. SO JOE MANCHIN IS IN PLAY. I WOULD ALSO LOOK AT HEIDI HEITKAMP, DEMOCRAT FROM NORTH DAKOTA. THOSE OF THE TWO MAIN OPERATIVES AND THE DEMOCRATS THAT MIGHT BE IN PLAY TO VOTE FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH. Shannon: HOW TENSE ARE THINGS ON CAPITOL HILL WITH ALL OF THIS GOING ON? WITH HER QUITE A BIT BUT WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING THERE AND THE MEMBERS AS WELL. IT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY SUPERCHARGED. PROTESTERS IN THE HALLWAY. EXPECTING MORE PROTESTERS TOMORROW. U.S. CAPITOL POLICE ESCORTING SENATORS TO AND FROM THE CAPITAL WHEN THEY HAD TO COME IN VOTE. WE HAD A STORY BRICK TONIGHT WHERE AN UNPAID DEMOCRATIC INTERN FOR SHEILA JACKSON LEE HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY THE U.S. CAPITOL POLICE FOR DIOXANE THREE OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. HE WAS CAUGHT IN A CAPITOL HILL OFFICE LAST NIGHT AND ARRESTED AT HOME BY THE U.S. CAPITOL POLICE TODAY. YOU HAD MITCH McCONNELL SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THESE PROTESTERS HARASSING REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN THE HALL AND THEN YOU HAD CHUCK SCHUMER, THE MINORITY LEADER BASICALLY GOING RIGHT UP TO THE EDGE WHERE HE ALMOST CALLED MITCH McCONNELL A LIAR. HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO USE THAT WORD, HE IS USING FALSEHOODS, HE SAID. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SORT OF LANGUAGE ON CAPITOL HILL BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS VERY OFTEN. THE REASON THIS NOMINATION IS DANCING ON THE TIP OF A PEN, IT COULD GO EITHER WAY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH 49, 50, 51 VOTES. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO TENSE.
