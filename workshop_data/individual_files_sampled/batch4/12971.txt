senator bernie sanders loon bag of vermont has been the leading voice in the United States for socialized health care it's called for such a policy amounts to this tweet he issued last night quote people who can't afford health care do not deserve to die this of course has nothing to do with policy and everything to do with an immature worldview that suggests that government contain every unfairness in life of course no one deserves to die because they can't afford health care but no one deserves to die for any reason other than their own evil criminality people don't deserve to die of cancer people don't deserve to die in car accidents people don't deserve to die peacefully in their beds in old age as Clint Eastwood says an Unforgiven deserves got nothing to do with it the question in public policy isn't one of motivation nobody right or left believes that poor sick people deserve to die the question is has the best increased access to health care the right believes that increase in supply is necessary in order to create competition and therefore lower cost and increase quality this means deregulation the Left believes that current supply must be redistributed one of these used in every single area of life has generated more access to wealth and health one of these uses generated less if there is a question of morality attendant to health care it isn't whether people deserve death based on cost whether health care providers can be forced to serve people at a loss and whether doing so will help more patients in the long run but Sanders simplistic Kindergarten sloganeering convinces a lot of people who refuse to acknowledge the decent intentions of their ideological opponents it's not designed to achieve better health care it's designed to slander people who disagree about the method for achieving better health care without violating the rights of others i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show okay so we have a lot to get to today up tune including president Trump is now tweeting about Amazon and we're going to talk about the media fight and we're going to talk about Trump care so lots and lots of things to talk about but before we get to any of that I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at legacy box so if you are looking to preserve your memories your childhood memories you want your parents to preserve

terrific terrific service so glad they exist and of course use that legacy box / comm / pen so they know that we set you okay so yesterday there was a lot of hubbub over the sort of media fight that took place at the White House so Trump care and all of its vagaries have now receded into the background because honestly who wants to talk about all of the infighting over what amounts to a significant cut to Medicaid future growth but accepts Obama care central premise I mean like nobody cares about the details of Obama care all they know is they don't like whoever touches it which is why the polls today are showing 12 percent of Americans in favor of the Senate health care version Trump care so we'll get to all of the the hubbub surrounding Matt but the truth is both the right and the left would much prefer it's much more entertaining to talk about the media fights that are currently happening so Trump keeps saying that the media are fake news and the news keeps saying that Trump is a fake president so both of them are equally the well I wouldn't say they're equally wrong I think that the news is more fake than Trump is a fake president obviously Trump is the president and media do sometimes report fake news but what you really have right now is this piece of Kabuki theater where the only people who benefit are the partisans on both sides and I'm speaking as someone who is quite partisan right I'm a conservative I'm very partisan on behalf of my viewpoint but this whole kind of ridiculous play theater slap fight between media and Trump is silly and the reason it's silly is because the media are going to do it the media are going to do Trump's going to do it Trump is going to do none of this is going to change Trump wins points from smashing the media around the media win points by smacking Trump around and nothing changes and then we just bitch about it that's basically the way this dynamic works so yesterday was perfect example of this you have Sarah Huckabee Sanders who is in for Sean Spicer Sean Spicer has been relegated to the outhouse he's been locked there actually by President Trump after Sean Spicer didn't do a good enough job firstly relegated into the bushes then you relegated him to the outhouse Oh Sarah Huckabee Sanders has now taken his place in the White House press briefing room but naturally we're allowed to take this press briefing which is which is nice I mean it's nice to be able to see the stuff visually so Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the is doing this and she's asked about a story we discussed at length yesterday the CNN story that accused Anthony Scotto Moochie is a trump associate of associating with evil Russian banks and it turned out that that story was complete crap there was nothing of substance to it CNN had to retract the story they fired the reporters who were involved in the story and so Sarah Huckabee Sanders is asked about this and she just uses it as an opportunity a legit opportunity to go after the press with both barrels here she goes III don't know that it's that the response isn't good enough for the president I think it's the constant barrage of fake news directed at this president probably that has garnered a lot of his frustration you point to that report there are multiple other instances where that outlet that you referenced has been repeatedly wrong and had to point that out or be corrected there's a video circulating now whether it's accurate or not I don't know but I would encourage everybody in this room and frankly everybody across the country to take a look at it I think if it is accurate I think it's a disgrace to all of media to all of journalism I think that we have gone to a place where if the media can't be trusted to report the news then that's a dangerous place for America and I think it is a place that you're totally right about all of us right she's totally right about all of this everything Sarah Huckabee Sanders says right here about the media's coverage of Trump is exactly right they put it forward a bunch of fake news they violated their own journalistic standards in order to do so they're out to attack Trump they're out to get Trump and pushing this Trump Russia collusion hoax for a year now even if Russia interfered in the election which they probably did and then when I say probably I mean they almost certainly did because I haven't seen the underlying evidence but I believe our Intel community which says that they did but even if that happened there's no suggestion evidentiary that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia at least haven't seen anything yet so at the year of hubbub for ratings and then of course she was referring back to the James O'Keefe video of a CNN producer talking about how CNN had been pumping up the Trump Russia stuff in order to generate future ratings in order to generate better rating so she's totally right about all of us and then she goes too far here is what Sarah how to be gender says next if we make the slightest mistake the slightest word is off it is just an absolute tirade from a lot of people in this room but news outlets get to go on day after day and cite unnamed sources use stories without sources have you know you mentioned the thermo G story before they had to have reporters resign okay so again this part is now a little bit crazy because it is one thing to say that they report stuff violate their own ethical standards and all that I totally agree totally agree the media is wildly biased they hate Trump and they're out to get to her all true all true but then when she says well if we get anything a little bit wrong everybody goes crazy well you are the White House you are the president I mean not to not to try to be too fair-minded here but there were those of us on the right we're pretty critical of President Obama I remember because I was one but I mean we were on top of President Obama as well we should have been the President of the United States deserves scrutiny and then she says news outlets go on day after day and they excite unnamed sources they use stories about sources okay again the White House does is to the White House leaks routinely to the press the White House uses anonymous sources a little bit if a critical and then she says that the CNN story they had to have reporters resign well that conflicts with the idea that news outlets don't see any ramifications for it they do right I mean if news outlets have to fire their reporters because of the blowback after they'd write a bad story that is a that is a ramification that is a form of accountability you may not think it's enough you may think they were pressured into it but it doesn't really matter bottom line is to pretend the media is not being held accountable by people like me people like you watch the show people like the president is just silly okay so but Sarah Huckabee Sanders is into scoring points with the Trump administration rather score points off the media then actually promulgate good policy at least openly like some good policies happening but it's all happening behind the scenes so what did this do this prompts a guy named Brian Karam of Sentinel newspapers so I guess in a playboy reporters reporter for Playboy and I would make a joke about a playboy reporter being in the White House briefing room asking questions except that we've had a number of weird people in the White House briefing room asking questions and President Trump has a picture of himself on the cover of Playboy in his office so I can't really mock that too much anyway Brian Sentinel newspapers he meant pipes up and he goes on just this rant against Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the White House what you're implying everybody right here right now with those words you do this administration has done that as well why in the name of haven't any one of us right or replaceable and any one of us if we don't get it right the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read it I think you have been elected to serve for four years at least there's no option other than that or added to ask you questions prime your to provide the answers and what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at if they see once again the president is right and everybody here is fake media and everybody in this room is only trying to do their job okay so the he says that and this enforce was viral the entire meeti rescues aren't champion now he is our champion yeah except for the faculty because everybody's just your friends do their job we're all just trying to do our job yes but what you consider your job to be is getting from right I mean your job is not just to cover the news for a lot of the media the job is to get from get that moment where you can finally fulfill that leftist fantasy that trump is gonna be thrown out on his ample posterior right out of the White House and into primum right so this who does this benefit okay who does this benefit well first and foremost it benefits this reporter who gets to become a hero on MSNBC he goes on MSNBC right after this and he talks about how brave he was now again I think that this is not particularly brave because bravery entails undergoing some sort of risk okay saying saying things to Sarah Huckabee Sanders is not exactly like Martin Luther King in Selma brave it's mostly like you mouthing off men getting celebrated on MSNBC which is which is virtue signaling okay here he is being feeded they basically give them a medal over on MSNBC this guy are they tellers that that's that's why we're here is to try and find out and there have been what got me when you asked about what got me rankle it's the fact that they sit there and say we're dishonest in the media and we're being dishonest well there's consequences but I have yet to hear anyone from this administration is even admit a mistake and so it's a little hard to take because the people in that room I have a healthy respect for I've been coming and going in this room since off and on since the Reagan administration there were you know those people I have held up as heroes some of the people that were here in addition there are reporters who have given their lives to get news to the public and it be just labeled as dishonest and fake media rankles me and I you know maybe I lost my temper at that moment but it it was a long time coming it was six months I would like to see that taken off the in just taken off the table and let us talk about real issues let us ask our questions quit hitting us with fake media I mean everyone including Breitbart that's in there has been respectful they've asked questions and the administration is not often been forthcoming with what I would say are factual answers so yeah I'm a little Kannada then cuz yeah yeah sure I believe about I have a thing cuz magic I bet says love it like it's got it was a human unrepaired up button oh international cemetery ah zero zero okay so this is to who benefits first of all the media benefit from this perception that they are speaking truth to power right goes all the way back to Sam Donaldson doing the same thing with Ronald Reagan back in the eighties and then who else benefits will trump benefits obviously because we on the right we hate the media we think the media are totally full of crap but does anyone benefit in terms of policy well not really because it turns out all the Acolytes of the media don't trust Trump all the Acolytes do Trump don't trust media and so we have nothing to talk about really and the fact is that bad media performance happens on both sides it does happen on both sides like I would prefer I said this before I've said this many times I would prefer a left media to cover Trump and a right media to cover Obama because whoever is most in opposition to the president seems to me the person who is most likely to actually keep that president being held responsible like I would rather have tough questions being asked than this question from lifestyle I've said is a Laura Ingraham publication here's a life set reporter asking question yesterday he was the new the CNN's erroneous story about Anthony scaramouche II does the White House believe there are other russia-related stories from major elements that have not been retracted and are just as false including the February 14th story in The New York Times about collusion between some Kent Lane and Russia which James Comey called into question which many believe the CNN story was based upon does the White House now believe the news media have an obligation to review stories on the Russian Trump issue and retract question we source story okay I mean it's a it's particular though here's a softball tear I just enjoy write it name all the stories you think have been bad over the past year again did all that what we have to understand is consumers of media's the media have an agenda Trump has an agenda and their real agenda here is to play play this lap by game or both of them win points off of each other that doesn't mean you should trust the media over Trump it doesn't mean you should trust Trump over the media it means you should trust the facts for the fact and understand the game is being played on both sides is much more about scoring points than it is about actually achieving truth well before we go any further honestly thank you to our sponsors over at Indo chinos so if you want a suit that just looks the best a suit can look you need

is a little more insidious believe it or not then even in politics so I am an advocate of the position that Andrew Breitbart used to take which is a cultures upstream of politics meaning that more people are impacted by their views on politics by culture than they are by actual politics like there's a select group of people who listen to this show and it's thank God big and growing but it is not nearly number of people who watch sports for example or the number of people who watch Entertainment TV the fact is that if you look at views even among Republicans from the time that Modern Family premiered on gay marriage canal there's like a thirty point drop in the number of people who disapproved of gay marriage in the Republican community between Modern Family premiering and now because people tend to follow culture people tend to imitate culture and imbibe culture this is where the media bias is really the worst because in politics there are some checking mechanisms right I am a check and balance on the media president Trump is a check and balance on the media Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a check and balance on the media you yourself is consumer you are aware of media bias so you are now a check and balance on the media this is not true when it comes to cultural areas when it comes to cultural areas there is no check and balance because most of us don't even want to think about the fact that the left is infiltrating all of the areas of culture that we inhabit and trying to twist them to their own viewpoint so for me one of my pet peeves is sports so I am a huge sports fan I particularly enjoy baseball and basketball although I do like football as well but the three big sports are my sports I wish I knew more about hockey because I've been to a couple hockey games and they're wonderful but I don't know enough about it to be a big fan I don't know enough for the players I'd really have to sort of engross myself in it but in any case I'm also a tennis fan so I like tennis and there's been a controversy that is now broken out that is just ridiculous and stupid over Serena Williams so we talked about this a little bit yesterday John McEnroe he's of course one of the great men's players of all time he came out and he said Serena Williams a great player but Serena Williams is not as good as men right Serena Williams is a girl and that prompted Serena Williams to begin tweeting about it because she was now very very very very very very mistress demonstrates again how things work in the in the sports media everything has to be politicized so she tweets out Dear John I adore and respect you but please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based I've never played any one ranked there nor do I have time respect me and my private is I'm trying to have a baby good day sir I don't understand what her having a baby had to do with the question he was asked his direct question we played it yesterday he was asked a direct question about where Serina would rank and he said she is the best female player of all time and people so why not the best player of all time and then the media asked him to apologize to hear the CBS anchors were angry at McEnroe asking him to apologize for it I felt in need from however unfortunately and probably probably defend myself I don't know just say what I really felt I mean which is about what I think she would be I think you're referring to the fact that I said she'd be about 700 in the world yeah I've got a solution Gail though because I know that you're friendly with Sarina and I think I believe yesterday right now I'm just waiting I would like to apologize no you really do need to answer Charlie's pool what was it I didn't learn you're right I wasn't a library to do this yeah it wasn't necessary it was not nothing new alacrity I didn't know what I didn't know it would create you know giddy no John if anybody ever I've said this now I'd be richer already thanks no apology just arena really I've listened I would be happy to apologize arena yell if that makes you feel better anyone I think Serena's incredible I don't want anything to go wrong with Serena because she's pregnant I don't want to upset her or whatever it was she's I think she was doing it tongue-in-cheek as well and I think the deeper the whole thing's ridiculous this whole thing is just ridiculous as in insane okay it's totally that you've got the CBS anchors berating and badgering over something that is obvious perfectly obvious again Serena Williams did play a a practice match but I went like two hundred and third in the world from one game off of him one okay like no I'm sorry she is not as good as the men because she is a girl and that is just she's amazing she kicked my ass but that has nothing to do with whether she would be on the professional men's sort in fact you know who has said this in the past you know his heaven-sent some woman named Serena Williams your Serena Williams on David Letterman a couple of years ago actually it's funny because marry he all he was been joking about myself and him playing a match and I'm like Andy seriously like are you kidding me cuz for me tennis in men's and women's centers are completely almost two separate for it so I'm like if I were to play Andy Murray I would lose six oh six Oh in five to six minutes maybe 10 minutes because there's no enduro and honestly completely it's a completely different foursome in our lot faster and me and they did they serve harder than hit hi she's a different game and I love to play women's tonight I only want to play girls I don't want to be in beers I would not do the tour I wouldn't do really seen any justice so Andy's stop it yeah we're not I'm not going to let you kill me okay so there she is admitting it okay because it's true because it's true doesn't stop those GPS anchors from going after max how dare you suggest biological reality that's just terrible actually my favorite thing of the night last night is a christina hoff sommers so the the factual feminist friend of mine she was tweeting out she was tweeting up I guess it was book segments from some feminist queer theory book and and there was a segment from some woman who thinks she's a man as transgender man talking about how she had given birth and the oh the whole piece was a man kids birth and so I tweeted back what via the urethra like how would that work and it's passing a hell of a kidney stone right there because the fact is that men can't converse gang only women can give birth but visibly you speak basic biological truths to now and suddenly you're it's a problem like I'm up in Canada right now I'm over in Toronto because I'm gonna give a speech tonight and Jordan Peterson who we're going to have to have on the show when when studio is finally set up totally Jordan Peterson has basically been reamed out by his own university by the government for having temerity to say things like men are men and women are women this is the way that we are moving and in the media the media are pushing that as hard as they possibly can and then of course they are firing every conservative they can get their hands on Britt McHenry who was a controversial figure because there's a video of her getting angry at some sort of car attendant at one point she was fired and she came out yesterday she said he s been fired me because I'm conservative which is perfectly plausible she said I mean I've been openly conservative look how that ends it up is what she tweeted out yesterday which is correct okay ESPN will fire people who are openly conservative whether you're talking about Mike Ditka or Curt Schilling it doesn't seem to matter Curt Schilling's great sin you recall with the Curt Schilling at one point had said that Isis was like the Nazis they fired him right Mike Ditka's great sin is that he didn't support President Obama oh just so terrible unbelievable but this is how culture bleeds down into politics and that's why we have to fight back against it no sports should be left to sports they should not turn into the political whims of the of the radical left that's really stupid okay we're going to continue by talking about the latest on Trump care plus some things I like things I hate and some Bible talk but for that you're going to have to subscribe so go over
