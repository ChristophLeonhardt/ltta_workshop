in the realm of creativity and original thinking most people believe that there's a trade-off between how much work that you get done and then how creative you are right so you should do a few things perfectly or you could be the kind of person who you know turns out a bunch of singles but never hits a home run and that's actually false so the the single best predictor of person's creativity across science the arts if you're an inventor or an entrepreneur is just the volume of ideas that you generate creativity kind of works like an evolutionary process and so if you're gonna try to get to something really novel or you know even slightly original you just need to have lots and lots of options on the table and many of those will be dead ends and and just really poorly thought-out ideas but the more you generate the more of those possibilities you'll consider and so one of the more interesting stats on that is that creativity works a lot like being a hitter in baseball if you're at a point where you can even get to like a you know a 300 batting average and three out of ten ideas are good you're actually way ahead of most creative people in your field and so it turns out that if you really wanted to push that far you wonder like how many ideas do I need if I'm in a brainstorm to solve a problem and most people when I work with executives on this they say 10 to 20 is their target you know max out novelty until you get to at least 200 ideas so multiply your target by 10 or 20 and then you're in good shape
