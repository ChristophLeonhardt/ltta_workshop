British historian has criticized universities in the UK for promoting a positive thinking about communism he claims the pros and cons of the system are being scaled the same it's not just historians but the British media also are developing something of a Red Scare mentality as of late much was made of the Prime Minister wearing a bracelet featuring a frida kahlo a communist known for concerns about the poor elsewhere a BuzzFeed science editor was forced to lock down her social media account due to abuse after writing that she wants communism for Christmas nevertheless the claim by the historian came in response to a statement by the head of a Marxist society at one London University lolly told a BBC programme that communism was never given a charge to develop in the Soviet Union and therefore didn't fail well we spoke to her ourselves and she believes academics speaking out against communism and missing the point I think it's completely hypocritical and very typical of academics like him to kind of passionately you know talk about the deaths under the Soviet Union but I think this is you know very much selective outrage we look at you know the way the economy is right now particularly in Britain wage growth is the lowest it's been since the Napoleonic Wars so it's really not surprising that young people are starting to question this economic system that isn't actually offering them anything so there's definitely been a surge towards more Marxist ideas because they make sense I think people are questioning capitalism because they can see through the hypocrisy of politicians and bankers and academics according to a new opinion poll nearly a quarter of young people view global businesses as a threat that's compared with just 9 percent of view communism as a danger to the world a few in a lolly again feels the media has a biased view towards communism the media in general obviously don't paint Marxism or socialism or really any kind of left-wing politics in a positive light and that's because obviously and you know Media is owned by certain group of people and the media is owned by a billionaire class and that have certain interests they want to protect I think people can think for themselves and I wouldn't take their headlines as a general opinion of the British population
