okay so biggest news ever some big news of the day of course is that President Trump goes over to Singapore and he meets with Kim Jong Lou now I want to begin with this kim jeong-hoon is the world's worst dictator he's a piece of human debris he is garbage okay he has killed his uncle his ex-girlfriend his brother-in-law I believe he's killed all those people within the last couple of years he held his uncle at an airport using VX nerve gas he has 25 million people living in his slave state he has 200,000 people living in his gulags he is just sheer garbage and he is generation number three of sheer garbage in the Kim family a North Korean defector talks a little bit on television yesterday about the people in North Korea in the fact they don't even know that they're slaves because they've never seen the outside world in order to understand how horrible North Korea is you have to understand that at night when you take a photograph from space of North Korea versus South Korea South Korea is all lit up like a Christmas tree and North Korea there's one light and is it Kim Jong Un's Palace legitimately hey here is what a defector from North Korea said about North Korea how bad was it in North Korea when you were there it's hard to say because I mean I thought like I never knew my country was isolating people in North Korea they don't know that they are slaves that's why you know if we don't know you are slaves how do you demand to be free okay so bottom line is that this is a slave state it is run by one of the world's most evil families and the world's most evil human being at this point in time now the reason I point this out is because people are treating the summit with a bit of frivolity they're treating it as a giant celebration a coming-out party for kim jeong-hoon and that it's completely inappropriate the only reason that we're meeting with kim jeong-hoon is because he's been testing his nuclear weapons and because his family has been pursuing nuclear weapons and lying about it to the west over and over and over again unless we forget these lies have been continuous and repeated okay the Kim family has lied no less than eight times since 1992 to the American government about denuclearization eight times so before everybody gets on their high horse about all Trump and finally got them to promise denuclearization they have promised you nuclearization more often than as many nights as there are Konica he has promised he nuclearization I mean he has promised you nuclearization essentially every other year the family has every other year since 1992 and we're supposed to pretend that his current promise means something well Trump tweeted in the run-up to the meeting that critics were were selling him short he said the fact that I'm having a meeting is a major loss for the USA the haters and looters losers we have our hostages testing research and all missile launches has stopped and these pundits who have called me wrong from the beginning have nothing they can say we will be fine okay just to point out here yes we got some hostages back so did Barack Obama in 2014 that is just historical fact as far as testing and research and missile launches have stopped we have no way to verify whether researchers stopped testing has stopped at the nuclear mountain because they imploded their own nuclear mountain and their missile launches have stopped because they don't want to set off president Trump in the run-up to the meeting right that's that's the idea here and President Trump then continues and he says meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly but in the end that doesn't matter we will all know soon whether or not a real deal unlike those of the past can happen the truth is usually a president of the United States does not get together with a foreign adversary to sign an agreement until there's an agreement to be signed until there's something real and decent and long-lasting and verifiable to be signed but the goal of these negotiations is cvid okay complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization or dismantlement okay CVID they're not really even talking about that right now they're not really even talking about that this was the big question was President Trump going to be handing kim jeong-hoon a public relations victory by going going over and hanging out with him or was he gonna get some serious concessions now we don't know the answer to that yet and this is my note of caution we don't know yet so what you're hearing from a lot of folks on the right is triumph Nobel Prize everything great has already happened nothing great has happened in fact right now the ledger is stacked in favor of Kim jong-un because we just handed them a massive PR victory we'll go through the PR victory and all the mistakes that were made over the last 36 hours and handing them a PR victory now all those mistakes turn to gold if Kim jong-un actually wants to denuclearize so if the White House knows something that we don't if the White House actually has some sort of verifiable regime of dismantlement coming then this is the greatest move of all time if they don't then it's a debacle okay there really is no in-between there's no in-between position where Trump goes over there and makes nice and plays kissy face with Kim Jong hoon and doesn't get anything out of him where it's not a debacle and on the other hand if he gets what he wants out of kim jeong-hoon then obviously everything is justified but right now everybody is jumping to their various positions you got folks on the right and they are jumping to the position that Donald Trump has done something masterful to masterstroke its genius its mega Magna 3d underwater chest upside down right and how do we know that well because Trump's doing it right if Obama has done the same thing we would have gone nuts but if Obama had gone over to Singapore and hung out kim jeong-hoon and stacked the American flag alongside the flag of North Korea we would have gone crazy because the flag of North Korea is the modern-day equivalent of the swastika they imagined that Kim Jong Lunas Hitler and you understand a little bit better why it might not be a great idea to have all these photo ops with a guy without receiving any sort of serious concessions in the first place so on the right they're jumping to everything is great everything's gonna be fine no downside all terrific and on the Left they're jumping too this is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of the world the same people who are insuring Obama for signing the world's worst nuclear deal with Iran are now saying the president Trump has done something terrible by meeting with Kim Jong hoon even though the real concessions made at this meeting are not particularly strong right he didn't actually commit to virtually anything he given to a few things none of them are good but we don't know yet yeah I spent I say a lot on the show I spend a lot of time on my show saying let's wait for the evidence to come in and there's another case where I'm gonna say let's wait for the evidence to come in but we can say that President Trump gave up something very serious in these in this in this photo-op he gave up the idea that America as the freest country on the face of the planet and most powerful country on the face of the planet has the capacity to talk down to Kim Jong we should be talking down to him he's a tin-pot dictator piece of crap he's a horrible human being been legitimizing him and pretending that he's a normal person and that this is a normal regime and then we gotta have normal relations with this normal regime without any serious concessions being made I don't know why the president says that I honestly don't I don't know why this wasn't done from lower level negotiators I don't know why this wasn't done through Mike Pompeo I don't know why this wasn't done through the CIA there are plenty of ways to negotiate these deals having the president show up for a nice back rub with Kim jong-un doesn't seem to me like like a worthwhile cause now you have to understand the level of reality TV that was involved in this from the very start you have you have Dennis Rodman on TV crying so Dennis Rodman showed up in Singapore wearing to make America great again hat this is nutcase okay he's been going over to to North Korea for years back in 2014 a guy named Donald Trump tweeted that he never would have said the dominant that Dennis Rodman should go over to North Korea and hang out with Kim jong-un it's why he's glad he fired him from Celebrity Apprentice now Dennis Rodman is actually at this event and then he starts crying on TV while talking about how he is sponsored by some sort of pot Bitcoin company over the ductless I was sitting up protecting everything and I believe it on Korea and when I went home I can't go home I couldn't go home for 30 days and could hope but I kept my head up high brother I knew things gonna change I knew it I was the only one I never had no one to hear me I didn't know what had to see me but I took those bullets I took all that I took everything everyone came at me and I'm still standing today is a great day for everybody SATA for everything it's a great day and he said he's standing there talking about pot coin calm and Chris Cuomo humoring him okay when Dennis Rodman says it's a great day that doesn't necessarily mean it's a great day it could just mean that he took LSD like we just don't know it's Dennis Rodman okay so all of this happens Kim jong-un and Donald Trump walk out and here is the historic moment everybody says it's historic they always say historic as the historic is good historic just means historic meaning that it makes history but lots of things were historic Neville Chamberlain was historic and so was so as opening China right lots of things are historic here's what it looked like when President Trump met with Kim jong-un for the first time as we see President Trump getting prepared to walk to center stage and there it is the first handshake between the United States President positive right now you can see the danger in in this in this image okay and the image is of course a bunch of American flags stacked up against a bunch of North Korean flags if those were swastikas everybody would understand this okay symbolism matters and I guess we play Kim jong-un as though he is some sort of joke is that he's just a fat boy who's a joke okay there's an element of that but the guy also happens to be a mass murderer like an actual mass murderer so in any case President Trump says that he is happy to get the guy to the table and then he says that he felt foolish with doing the fire and fury rhetoric but he had to do it he told this to Sean Hannity he says that you know that's the way that you get Kim jong-un to the table in the first place I think without the rhetoric we wouldn't have been here I really believe that you know we did sanctions and all of the things that you would do but I think without the rhetoric you know other administration's I don't want to get specific on that but they had a policy of silence if they said something very bad very threatening and horrible just don't answer that's not the answer that's not what you have to do okay so I agree with president Trump's harsh rhetoric I agree with President Trump harsh rhetoric with regard to kim jeong-hoon I don't think that it was his harsh rhetoric that brought Kim jong-un to the table I think that was the South Korean administration which has been extraordinarily open toward kim jong hoon and basically brokered this deal so I like the harsh rhetoric I have no problem with the fire and fury rhetoric with regard to Kim jong-un it doesn't bother me one iota in fact I'd like more of that more of the harsh Trump rhetoric less of the kissy kissy face for me because I just I'm not a big fan of how this went so in just a second I'm going to explain to you what exactly went down in this deal because I have the document in front of me what exactly was signed and why it basically is a giant nothing burger for the moment first I want to say thanks to our sponsor is over at puppy spots so welcoming a puppy into your home is is incredibly rewarding I know that my sister

what the deal says it says Donald Trump of the United States of America and chairman kim jeong-hoon of the state affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held first historic summit in Singapore on June 12th 2018 president Trump and chairman kim jeong-hoon conducted a comprehensive in-depth and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new u.s. DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula president Trump committed to provide security guarantees to DPRK and chairman Kim jong-un reaffirmed his firm an unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula let's stop there for just a second okay what that means is that President Trump made commitments that he would not actually involve the United States in joint military drills with the South Koreans and Kim jong-un said I'm gonna do the same thing my dad and my granddad promise and I'm gonna lie about it that's not a promising start now listen I know maybe there's more to come maybe there's more to come but I need to see the evidence there's more to come before I start getting excited about its deal that basically is weaker than prior deals in fact is that the joint comprehensive framework that was come up with in 2005-2006 is stronger than this deal convinced that the establishment of new u.s. DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world and recognizing the mutual conference building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula president Trump and Kim jong-un state the following and here we get to the actual four basic principles of the deal principle one the US and the DPRK commit to establish new u.s. DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity as someone doesn't mean anything to the United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula okay again that doesn't mean anything three reaffirming the April 27 2018 Panama and John declaration the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula commits to work toward complete denuclearization is actually a weaker promise and has been made in Prior agreements and then for the United States and zpr can commit to recovering pio wmia remains including the immediate immediate repatriation of those already identified and then there's a bunch of language about how much fun they had together there's nothing new here and one that Trump has been pumping the hardest is the PIO wmia language the suggestion that we're gonna bring home the remains of all these POWs in Mis that's great except that this has been a Korean promise for legitimately 30 years Korean officials have been promising between to do this since the 1980s between 1996 and 2005 u.s. North Korean search teams conducted 33 joint recovery operations and recovered 229 sets of American remains that program was actually discontinued for a time because North Korea insisted we pay them bribes in order so that we could gather the bones of the American dead some Americans were referring to this as bones for bucks weary continued it in 2011 and then we stopped again in 2016 so the deal itself is no great shakes so what that means is that the only way for this to be a success is if it is a first step now in order for it to be as success as a first step two things have to happen Trump can't give up too much upfront and second there must be an actual thing that we get on the back end now I want to talk about what Trump gave up here in just a second so let's begin President Trump does this press conference last night he's obviously very pleased with himself he's obviously very excited because this is the historic moment it's the moment the world came together it's his nobel-prize-winning moment because he went and just as Nixon went to China Trump went in Singapore okay so Trump starts off and this is one of the problems so the big wins that President Trump handed the North Koreans were a couple fold there a few of them so first off there was the the so first off there was the Trump praise for Kim Jong hoon okay and there there was plenty of it so it begins with president from talking about how talented Kim Jong hoon is now I understand this is from stick I get it like I understand President Trump is trying to build relations what are you gonna go over there and yell at him that he's a dictator mass murderer no but you also don't have to say that he's the world's most wonderful guy I understand again this is Trump stick he says this about everyone during first meets them but it's not good and just the same way it was stupid when President Bush said that he looked into Putin's eyes and he saw his soul I think this is idiotic here's President Trump saying that Kim Jong moon is very talented he said this sort of nonsense before well he is very talented anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough I don't say it was nice or I don't say anything about it he run it very few people at that age you can take one out of 10,000 probably couldn't do it okay he's a dictator who legitimately murders political dissidents that's not the language the presidents of the United that shameful language the presidents of the United States should not be using that language about one of the most evil people on planet earth I don't care whether it's obama or bush or Clinton or Trump that's not the language you use with kim jeong-hoon and then President Trump goes further he actually starts talking about all of the concessions he would like to make to Kim jong-un some will materialize some will not but none of this none of the signals strength to come jong-un it actually signals weakness to Kim jong-un at some point I have to be honest and I used to say this during my campaign as you know probably better than most I want to get our soldiers out I want to bring our soldiers back home we have right now 32,000 soldiers in South Korea and I'd like to be able to bring them back home but that's not part of the equation right now at some point I hope it will be but not right now we will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money unless and until we see that the future negotiation is not going along like it should okay so so Trump's made some sort of concessions here one of the concessions is that we're going to hold off on joint military exercises with South Koreans this apparently surprised the South Koreans he said that these exercises were quote-unquote very provocative okay that's the language that that Kim Jong hoon probably said to Trump these are provocative exercises they're not provocative exercises they're joint military exercises they're not meant to provoke a response from North Korea they're meant as a warning to North Korea the president shouldn't be talking in those terms about joint military exercises and then he starts talking again about how wonderful Kim jong-un is he talks about how Kim jong-un really wants to get something done I think he wants to do things I think he wants to you'd be very surprised very smart very good negotiator wants to do the right thing I believe it's a rough situation over there there's no question about it and we did discuss it today pretty strongly I mean knowing what the main purpose of what we were doing is Dino king but discussed it in a pretty good length we'll be doing something on it it's it's rough it's rough in a lot of places by the way not just there but it's rough and we will continue that and I think ultimately again brushing off human rights abuses in North Korea as it's rough in a lot of places it's it's this is not a good look from the presidents of the United States now the reason I'm being critical is because what President Trump is trying to do here obviously is butter up kim jeong-hoon like really butter him up the idea here is we'll make Kim jong-un feel so about himself that he'll give up his nuclear weapons I'm deeply skeptical kim jeong-hoon falls for this but clearly that's what Trump is trying to do to put the best possible spin on it for Trump that he doesn't like Kim jong-un but he's trying to manipulate Kim jong-un he's trying to butter him up I think the most buttery thing that he said actually was not during this press conference we'll get back to the clips from the press conference in just a second it's clip 19 where he was with Greta Van Susteren and apparently decided that we were going to do an episode of the dating game but oh but um but um here he is describing his potential date kim jeong-hoon really he's got a great personality he's a you know funny guy he's a very smart guy he's a great negotiator he loves his people not that I'm surprised by that but he loves his people and I think that we have a you know the start of an amazing deal with Anna Dean nuke North Korea it's going to start immediately and a lot of other things are happening he loves his people don't you understand he loves his people just like to serve man right from from Twilight Zone he they also the aliens loved their people to eat them okay Kim jong-un has kept his people in a state of abject slavery for legitimately decades and he loves his people how is that helpful how is that helpful okay so if he butters know again all of this is contingent on something really big has to happen at the other end if not this is the President of the United States lying town and playing dead for the worst dictator on planet Earth we'll get to more of President Trump statements on all this plus the blowback in just a second the media blowback is hypocritical and I'll talk about that but first I want to say thanks to our sponsor is over at policy genius if you have a car you have car insurance and if you have a home you have home insurance if you're alive you should have life insurance because once you die it's too late and then your family is screwed right because then you didn't get all the life insurance you needed and now they're left without any money at all that's why policy genius has made it easy for you to search for

disability insurance and renter's insurance and health insurance all the insurance you'll need governor policy genius.com to get that insurance and insure your family is taken care of ok so back to president Trump's press conference so president Trump continues by talking about how he and here President Trump is talking about the media hypocrisy so a lot of people are saying well why is this any different than when Obama was trying to make concessions to the Cubans of the turanians and Trump rightly is saying listen the deal that I'm cutting right now isn't making more concessions than anything Obama did and this is one of the great ironies of this particular political moment is that all the people who thought that Obama was just terrible for the Iran deal are cheering wildly president Trump meeting with Kim jong-un and massaging his back and all the people who are really really angry and President Trump for doing this on the left were wildly ecstatic about President Trump back massaging the mullahs in Iran and then there are those of us who say listen it's bad when Obama back massage the mullahs and it's bad when Trump back massages Kim Jong loon is bad when Obama kisses the butt of some of the worst people on earth and it's bad when Trump does that as well there'd better be some sort of payoff on the other end here's Trump going after the media however Jennifer when you look at all of those things that we got and when we got our hostages back I didn't pay 1.8 billion in cash like the hostages that came back from Iran which was a disgraceful situation what took place so we've gotten a lot so when I hear somebody in the media say that President Trump has agreed to meet like it's not a big deal to meet I think we should meet on a lot of different topics not just this one and I really believe a lot of great things can happen okay it is a big deal to me it is a big deal to mate okay it's a big deal to meet for the North Koreans may not be a big deal for Trump to me but it's the United States he has the prestige and power of the United States sitting behind him granting meetings to some of the worst people on earth is a bad idea there's a reason that President Trump for example hasn't been willing to meet with members of the Muslim Brotherhood there's a reason that he's not willing to meet with the leadership of Iran everybody understands this on an innate level president Trump understands it too he's brushing off the meeting is a big nothing because nothing has happened yet but that's exactly the point nothing has happened yet so why are you meeting what is the point of this meeting and when I say that there's been triumphalism surrounding his meeting I mean I I mean coming from the Trump administration so president Trump tweets out this video he's 18 he tweets out this video of a compilation of himself meeting with kim jeong-hoon i'll describe it to you and you can hear the music underneath because all this triumphal music is though something great has been done again nothing great has been done yet maybe something will be done but so far all I've seen is the President of the United States walking arm-in-arm with one of the worst people on planet Earth and then flattering him as a wonderful smart guy yeah that's not great to me I'm waiting for the great part to come I understand that maybe this is the setup well I need the punchline before I start laughing otherwise I'm just gonna be angry at the setup cuz I don't like the setup very much Trump though is touting the setup as though this is some sort of big win the problem with this video is that if you cut it shot-for-shot with the same music you could play it on Pyongyang TV in favor of kim jeong-hoon here's what the video sounds like so you can see Trump walking into the venue and then you see him shaking hands with kim jong hoon and both of them smiling and trumping very warm and the triumphal music everything's just spectacular then then walking along some sort of portico together and then sitting together and and Trump smiling at him and then and then Mike Pompeo coming in and shaking has a kinder than both of them very smiling then sitting across the table and the hopeful music Rises oh and then they're both waving to the crowd come gentlemen smiling they're walking together in the gardens okay none of this is useful the point of this meeting is supposed to get kim jungeun to understand do you actually need to make concessions because if you don't make concessions we're gonna kick the living bleep out of you right that's what this meeting was supposed to be not President Trump going in there and making nice that we can then claim that we've won some sort of victory diplomacy is not a victory diplomacy is a tactic just because you are being diplomatic does not mean that you did anything wonderful it depends what's on the other end of the diplomacy Obama did this routine - this is my original complaint about Trump meeting with Kim Jong hoon I said it at the time go back and listen to the tape I've been saying it for weeks saying that you're gonna meet with somebody makes the diplomacy the chief goal the diplomacy is never the chief goal now they're a bunch of people today who are making the same argument that Obama made about Iran well what would you have him do you go to war with North Korea no I wouldn't have them go to war with North Korea I would have his lower level negotiators making clear to the North Koreans what the deal should be and then when it's time for Trump to actually then he gets to walk in and sign a big piece of paper but preliminary handing the sort of legitimacy and kindness to kim jeong-hoon is not useful I mean speaking of legitimacy and kindness your President Trump has been saying for a long time that one of the keys here is that he's used very harsh language with regard to North Korea that if North Korea violates then we may have to use fire and fury well yesterday he basically took fire and fury off the table here as president from talking about how if we went to war 30 million people would die which is essentially taking military force off the table effectively this is the press conference they the quote beginning Seoul Seoul has 28 million people think of that and it's right next to the border it's right next to the DMZ it's right there I mean if this would have happened I think you know I've heard Oh a hundred thousand people I think you could have lost 20 million people 30 million people this is really an honor for me to be doing this because I think you know potentially you could have lost you know 30 40 50 million people the city of Seoul one of the biggest cities in the world is right next to the the border okay so the fact that he's saying this is effectively taking the option off the table which is not a good idea idea right mean there should be no options off the table obviously and president Trump's whole shtick here when it comes to foreign policy is you never give away your hand and maybe we'll hit you with a club and maybe we'll give you a carrot but you never give away your hand here's President Trump tipping his hand and that's not particularly smart it's just it's it's not particularly bright and I'm upset with him for having done it obviously unless unless I keep saying unless because we don't know what the unless is so we have to hold off judgment unless there's some sort of big concession by the North Koreans and then this this I thought was the funniest part of the press conference so Trump showed Kim a tape apparently I've seen the tape now it's it's this highly produced little tape with a big narrator voice with with the big narrator going Trump Kim can they make peace and then a bunch of pictures of people playing basketball and people dancing and singing and then a bunch of pictures of missiles and all this kind of stuff it's pretty it's pretty amazing but Trump talks about you know the tape and what he showed Kim he says that was a version of what hey I can that was a version of what could happen what could take place as an example they have great beaches you see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean right boy look at that baby wouldn't that make a great condo behind and I explained I said you know instead of doing that you could have the best hotels in the world right there think of it from a real estate perspective you have South Korea you have China and they own the land in the middle how bad is that right it's great but I told him I said you may not want to do what's there you may want to do a smaller version of it or you know and that could be although I tell you what he he looked at that tape he looked at that iPad and I'm telling you they they they really enjoyed it I believe here's the point the United States does not have to engage in a charm offensive with North Korea were the most powerful country in the history of the world by a factor of 10 there's legitimately no reason we have to engage in a charm offensive when we're telling a tin-pot dictatorship to give up their nukes the charm offensive stuff if it works then I'm happy to say the president Trump did something unprecedented and massive and wonderful but if it doesn't then all that happened is the President of the United States made a tin-pot dictator look like somebody who's actually worth the time and I'm not seeing that again you know President Trump's language here has been I don't think useful I think it's been counterproductive again I'm willing to withhold judgment I'm willing to withhold judgment he he says that he is ready to trust Kim jong-un this is the third clip from from the ABC interview of Stephanopoulos he says that he's done a lot of deals and and I think that I might be able to trust Kim jong-un again not sure why I've done a lot of deals with a lot of people and sometimes the people that you most distrust turn out to be the most honorable ones and the people that you do trust they are not the honorable ones so we are starting from a very high plane we're starting from a very good relationship this has been a very big day in terms of the world I think it's been maybe a lot of people are saying it's just all historic right and everybody's talking about how historic it is historically good historically bad we don't know yet we don't know yet but I will say this the media who are treating this with grave skepticism I wish they treated the Iran deal with the same grave skepticism and conservatives who are treating this as an unmitigated triumph I wish that they had treated this the same way they treated the Iran deal the deal is not a deal until there is a deal okay this is true of every deal in business and in politics there's no serious deal that's been made all that's happened so far is that Trump has offered an unrealistic tater ship on planet Earth put their flag alongside the flag of the United States you know many Americans died to keep that North Korean flag from flying over South Korea 50 thousand Americans died to keep that flag from flying over South Korea that means that we're gonna fly it alongside the American flag they're damn well better be a good reason and it can't just be because Trump wants a photo-op there has to be an actual good reason and that means actual denuclearization I hope that's what the Trump administration has in its back pocket I suspect that it is not from speaking to many people with with knowledge of the situation I suspect that it is not but if it is then more power to them and all this ends up being a coup it ends up being the greatest thing ever and I pray that it is if not it ends up being a debacle and Obama Essex debacle worse in in some ways then then anything except for the Iran deal on the Obama Ledger okay so I want to talk about Bill Clinton and how Bill Clinton continues to get

podcast in the nation so meanwhile President Clinton continues to get away with everything he made some comments the other day that went largely unremarked upon by mainstream media he said in an interview that sexual misconduct norms have changed how have they changed President Clinton explained I in general I think it's a good thing yes I think it's a good thing that we we should all have higher standards I think the norms have really changed in terms of what you can do to somebody against their will how much you can crowd their space make them miserable work you don't have to physically assault somebody to make them you know uncomfortable at work or at home or and their other just walking around ok so um the standards have changed about how much you can do with somebody against their consent yeah I love that the follow-up question here is not well what was the standard with wanita Broderick what was the standard with Paula Jones what was the stander with Kathleen Willey my favorite part of all these interviews with Bill Clinton is the James Patterson the best-selling author maybe of all time is sitting next to him just looking egregiously uncomfortable just looking like he wants to crawl into a hole and die it's pretty spectacular but Bill Clinton again still a respected voice on the left and then we wonder why people don't take the media seriously we wonder why wouldn't media ask critical questions about North Korea everybody blows them off maybe it's because they're a bunch of hypocrites maybe it's because they're ridiculous now speaking of ridiculous this story is amazing so Jack Dorsey is the head of Twitter he was he tweeted out that he had ordered a bag of sandwiches from chick-fil-a so he tweeted out boost chick-fil-a and then it showed a image of how much money he has spent at chick-fil-a he spent like 30 bucks at chick-fil-a and then he was called on it by Soledad O'Brien who immediately said this is an interesting company to boost during Pride Month Jack because it's Gay Pride Month this month which if you didn't if you didn't know congratulations it's Gay Pride Month and then Jack responded you're right completely forgot about their background he never should have shopped at chick-fil-a during Gay Pride Month it's basically like gay Ramadan now it's during this month you mustn't we're gonna fast from all of the Christian owned companies during gay Ramadan Gay Pride Month no one no one must ever shop from chick-fil-a a company that has never discriminated against homosexuals in any way but whose owners are against same-sex marriage anybody who Shops at chick-fil-a is violating the precepts of Gay Pride Month because the Gay Pride jihadis are gonna come after you and insist that you do repentance very very important stuff from Soledad O'Brien the best part of this is that Soledad O'Brien did an event in 2012 sponsored by chick-fil-a so she was happy to take the cash from chick-fil-a but now she's very upset the Gay Pride Month it's sanctity it's sanctity has been violated by the evil that is tweeting out that you shop to check the way to get a sandwich and then people wonder why people voted for president Trump you know as critical as I am of President Trump from time to time the fact is that the left does nothing but push people into president Trump's camp with social cultural more issues like this you know I like a lot of president Trump's policy I don't like a lot of President Trump's rhetoric some of the things President Trump does like this North Korean summit I think are foolhardy and problematic but when you have an entire group of people who insist that I cannot shop at the chicken sandwich shop of my choosing because that might offend homosexual people for no reason at all it sort of makes me think maybe I'll just vote for the guy who's not doing that maybe I'll vote for the guy who doesn't take that stuff particularly seriously pretty amazing stuff there from from Jack Dorsey I love the Jack Dorsey has to acknowledge that so it took Jack Dorsey like months and months and months to punish Louis Farrakhan by taking away his verification on Twitter he shouldn't have taken away his verification he shouldn't ban him either I think it's good Liu's Farrakhan is out there he reminds us how scummy human beings can be he's just piece of garbage but that said Jack Dorsey has been a number of people from Twitter but not Louis Farrakhan so he still hasn't been Lewis Farrakhan but he's never gonna shop at chick-fil-a during Gay Pride Ramadan so that's that's very exciting stuff okay meanwhile speaking of ridiculous stuff the Tony Awards happened last night and they were on Sunday night and they were particularly replete with anti Trump rhetoric foolishness so we talked about this a little bit yesterday but Robert DeNiro dropped an f-bomb on the air he decided that to show what a hero he was he was going to say F Trump in front of a crowd of people who hate Trump because that's really careless I mean the approval rating for Trump in this room is negative 37% like it's not even that there is no approval rating I mean it's 100% disapproval and and so he did something really brave he went out there and ripped Trump in front of all these people at the Tony Awards I'm gonna say one thing Trump standing ovations standing ovations set up Trump well you know what and I love how they stand and they cheer and he's and then he goes like this he gives like the big two fists up and he like pumps his fist as though he's actually succeeded in making Trump not president anymore that by shouting F Trump Trump is no longer the president it's in the Constitution if Robert De Niro goes on stage and Chad and shouts F Trump about you then that means that we can we can safely remove the president from office and then of course Andrew Garfield got up the guy from spider-man that not the not the new one that's good the old one that's bad he he got up and he started talking about how everybody should abandon everybody should basically bake cakes for the gays if if they are asked to do so for a gay wedding and such we are all sacred and we all belong so let's just bake a cake for everyone who wants a cake to be baked except for Christians Christians are not sacred and they are not there they they do not belong Christians do not belong and as I proposed yesterday I believe that Andrew Garfield should actually act I will write a play about the Christian Baker's who were discriminated against by the Colorado Commission on civil rights and Andrew Garfield can play the lead he can play the Christian Baker and I will raise the money to do that and he should have to do that because he should act for whoever whoever wants him to act I mean it's a free market it's an open open society he should I demand his services and his services I shall have Andrew Garfield's and then it got even better of course this this actress from a new a new musical about Harry Potter I guess she says that President Trump should not come to see the show he should be banned from the show so Andrew Garfield says that a Christian Baker should have to service a same-sex wedding but this actress says her name is Noma du mezzo NE she says that Trump should not be able to come to her play so yeah there's no double standard here at all should the president come see the Harry Potter Harry Potter in the curse child no thank you anybody else yeah anybody else yes but not him not him so there's here's a question the question is why is it that the Tony Awards like the Oscars like the enemies have catered so specifically to one segments of the population now the easy answer is they're all a bunch of leftist and they hate the right that's true but that doesn't explain why they've been allowed to get away with it so the Tony Awards do not get big ratings the Tony Awards got something like 6.3 million total viewers by way of contrast Game four of the NBA Finals which was down this year and drew twice that drew twelve point nine million viewers and few Americans have actually seen the shows featured at the Tony's basically Broadway attendance for musicals has been effectively stagnant since 2006 2007 nobody's seen any of these plays so why is it that the Tonys are so far out of the political mainstream well the reason is because of an element called renormalization so renormalization is this weird thing where a small group of people can impact a large group of people so here's how it works you have a family of four one of the members of your family is a vegetarian so instead of you having to cook two separate meals you just cook a vegetarian meal for everyone all right so now all four people have to have a vegetarian meal now that family goes to a party there are four families there and only one of the families is vegetarian well the person is throwing the party may think well you know I really don't want to cook two meals so I'm just gonna make the entire thing vegetarian so one person who's vegetarian can convert an entire group of people into eating vegetarian at a particular meal well the same thing happens when it comes to Broadway there are motivated niche groups who only go to the theater if their particular group is catered to and these happen to be hardcore leftist groups particularly and so those shows are what tends to be produced because they figure that everybody else is coming to Broadway we'll see whatever it is that is provided in the same way that the meat-eater will eat the vegetarian meal a bunch of people who don't care about these news shows will go to see the news shows cuz they're there for Broadway anyway and that's how Broadway remains liberal continues to make money it's only exposed of course on the Tonys when millions of people watch it when millions of people see this liberalism and this leftism put on full display in front of the entire country and they find it completely off-putting but that's how the market actually allows for Broadway and Hollywood remain so left even while they alienate huge swaths of the country okay so time for a couple of things that I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like my kid has been I'm gonna talk a little bit of Star Wars here because there's a big news story about Kathleen Kennedy so there's there's a lot of talk about there Kathleen Kennedy who's the head of Lucasfilm is going to step down from the Star Wars franchise and she's gonna step down as the head of Lucasfilm and I am going to talk about that in just second first I want to talk about how much I like Star Wars because I like Star Wars so much that my kids are familiar with all the music their favorite has been this rendition for a little while my two-year-old son particular this may cause a channel war he loves cello Wars okay cello Wars is that there's this group of guys they're called the piano guys and they did this version of the Star Wars music and it's just for two cellos and basically there's a little bit of background music I believe from a synthesizer or a piano and it's pretty cool so it's pretty fun you can get all their music on iTunes they have a lot of good stuff so go check out the piano guys I really enjoy a lot of their music this thing has several million hits on on YouTube for good reason it's pretty well produced okay so I'm gonna talk about Star Wars and Kathleen Kennedy and the stuff I hate but first one more thing that I like so this was pretty awesome so I was walking on Saturday on Shabbat I was walking around with my family and we walked past a little league baseball field and I had to stop and watch little league baseball because literally baseball is the best okay and as we were walking by the Little League baseball field the teams were going out there and they were lining up and I didn't realize this is what they do in little leagues I played in Jewish little leagues so usually we don't do any of this particular stuff although I think that we definitely should what they were saying oh they line up both teams right the opposing teams on the third base line and the first base line and then they had all the kids repeat this mantra I trust in God I love my country and will respect its laws I will play fair and strive to win but win or lose I will always do my best that's all American stuff it's just great unfortunately all those principles are under attack from both some folks on the left and some folks on the right particularly when it comes to playing fair and striving to win and to him your best I think that those principles are particularly under attack in today's modern era unfortunately but these sort of values do have an outcome and that outcome is stuff like this so yesterday this is just a beautiful video there was a high school pitcher who was pitching against I guess it's his it one of his best friends since he was a kid and his best friend played for another team from another high school and this last pitch wins him the high school his that the winning team now gets to go to the state championship in high school baseball and what you're going to see in this video is the is the pitcher strikeout the batter and then his teammates rush to celebrate on the mound and before they can he goes and gives his best friend a hug and comforts him about striking out and then he finally goes and he celebrates with his with his teammates that's just great that's just great I mean that's sportsmanship and that's decency and we're lacking a lot of that in in today's modern politics okay time for a couple of quick things that I hate okay so the thing that I hate Michelle wolf is awful okay she's awful she was awful and she did the White House Correspondents Dinner and she is awful now so she has a show on Netflix which nobody will ever watch we'll never know the ratings because that's not how Netflix actually makes its money they make their money off subscriptions of course so Michelle wolf did this routine in this video where she plays a person who is submitted to the op-ed page of the New York Times and the op-ed editor of the New York Times it turns out is an actual clown but she's not gonna rip the op-ed editor of the New York Times for being too left no she's gonna rip the op-ed editor of the New York Times from being too right and she specifically didn't go after Barry Weiss Barry Weiss is the only semi conservative columnist at the New York Times and it's Ross dude hat and and David Brooks who's not really very conservative at all and Barry Weiss and Michelle wolf goes after Barry Weiss because after all there are certain opinions that are bad capital ba-dee bad and they must not be allowed to be given room on the on the pages of the New York Times he was Michelle wolf being a complete cretin supposed to be damnit enough Barry Weiss your opinion suck they're bad opinions bad do you even realize what you're doing people look at your papers a trusted source for informed opinions but instead you're validating these back two points of view maybe it's time you leave do not validate the bad points of view people michelle wolf is right Barry Weiss had an opinion so has Barry Weiss ever defended pizza gate of course not that's asinine Barry Weiss's has written about a wide variety of issues some of which are not particularly Pro right-wing by the way and there isn't a shovel saying these are bad opinions bad understander much a bad opinion bad opinion and you don't deserve space in the newer times now listen do I think they're legit bad opinions yes I think that legitimate racist opinions are bad for example I think there are plenty of legitimately bad opinions I think the opinion that rape is a wonderful thing that's a horrible opinion right there are plenty of horrible opinions Barry Weiss does not fall outside the Overton Window but according to Michelle wolf she does because according to show up the only people who should be on the pages of the op-ed of the New York Times are people that Michelle wolf personally agrees with now the great irony of this is that Barry Weiss weren't a full column defending Michelle wolf after the White House Correspondents Dinner dinner so apparently her bad opinions include defending Michelle wolf pretty amazing stuff okay now meanwhile other things that I hate so I have to talk about this briefly there's a whole upstate of people who are now defending Kathleen Kennedy Kathleen Kennedy is the head of Lucasfilm and the reason that they are defending Kathleen Kennedy is they say that Kathleen Kennedy is doing a wonderful job as the head of the Star Wars universe she's not doing a bad job pay no attention to the failures of so low pay no attention to the last Jedi pay no attention to any of that stuff she is doing awesome and you know we do it with how we know she's doing awesome because Kathleen Kennedy is super woke and the real reason that kept that Star Wars is failing right now that Star Wars is having some trouble the real reason that Star Wars is is is feeling the pain is because of these toxic fans now does this sound familiar does it sound sort of like what people said about Hillary Clinton Hillary isn't failing because Hillary sucks Hillary's failing because everybody's deplorable that's exactly what all these colonists are saying so there's a guy named Mark Barnard and who writes for The Hollywood Reporter he says that all of these toxic fans quote hate everything the new Star Wars stood for hated what they saw as a social justice warrior remix of the Star Wars they grew up with and they hated trans rose this would be the this cat this actress what's her what's her first name kaydee trami who plays Rose in the last Star Wars movie which is a garbage part most of all because they decide to choose the avatar that all that was all that was wrong with the franchise those fans minority but allowed one found there them and the very thing they used to love those who chose this particular vein of the dark side emboldened by the faceless intoxication of the internet went hard on Tran racist invective misogyny rape and death threats all hurled in her constantly unrelentingly turn transforming what had been a Cinderella story the last Jedi was trans first major film into a modern-day nightmare okay so if you think that this group of reddit trolls who are like all up on Tran that that is what is causing Star Wars to fail you're an idiot okay the real reason that Star Wars is failing is not because of any of that stuff because if it was because of that stuff you would expected solo to do fine the solo wasn't filled with as much sjw nonsense the real reason that Star Wars is failing is because Kathleen Kennedy is terrible at her job okay the Lucasfilm story group is that the reason she's being defended again is because she's super woke the New York Times had a piece a few weeks ago talking about Kathleen Kennedy's Lucasfilm story group but they say quote they wanted to tell beautiful stories fulfill the expectations of loyal fans and create meaningful female characters the Lucas group story group is entirely female the times gushes today the Lucasfilm story group is a diverse outlier in Hollywood five of its members are people of color the team includes four women in seven men a new unpublished analysis of Star Wars film shows striking progress in the representation of gender and race now I don't care about any of that stuff I care whether the movies are good but the press cares about that stuff and that's why they have to defend Kathleen Kennedy from her bad creative decision-making the reason that Star Wars has failed is because they basically had two choices on relaunching the Star Wars universe one would be fast forward 50 years when all the original characters are gone and then you lose the nostalgia but at least you've relaunched the universe or two you recast the original characters and you pick up a Return of the Jedi left off but instead you chose door number three which is bring back all the original characters kill them off in the stupidest possible ways and then try to make backwards looking nostalgia films about characters you've already destroyed like solo I can't imagine why that was a giant fail Kathleen Kennedy should go but the media is gonna try and save her because she's a woman and she's a woke woman at the ads that's all that matters okay quick explanation of a federalist paper since we didn't do so yesterday so Federalist number 32 we are up to we can do this very quickly Alexander Hamilton wrote Federalist 32 this is a continuation of his discussion about the taxing power of the federal government and what he says is that the state and federal we'll be able to have concurrent taxing powers so there's a lot of worry at the state level that if the federal government can tax that that will prevent the state from taxing and Hamilton assures people that's not the truth he says this exclusive delegation or rather this alienation of state sovereignty would only exist in three cases where the Constitution in Express terms grants an exclusive authority to the Union were granted in one instance in authority of the Union and another prohibited the states from exercising the like Authority and we're a granted authority to the Union to which a similar Authority in the States would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant in other words unless the Constitution explicitly rules out that a state can do something the state can still do something so this is his argument and then he says states can tax their citizens he says there is plainly no expression in the granting clause which makes that power exclusive in the Union there's no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the states from exercising it in other words stop worrying so much that the federal government's going to tax everybody and States won't be able to Hamilton was right about this both the feds and the states now to tax people out of existence that's very exciting stuff and that's because of the growth of the federal government far beyond what Hamilton ever could have foreseen or approved okay we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest updates hopefully we'll have some good news from the Trump administration in terms of actual concrete steps that the North Koreans will take to denuclearize otherwise it was not a great day but maybe it will be a good day
