00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:15,726
SENATOR BROWN.

7
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:17,728
BUT THE #MeToo MOVEMENT

8
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:18,796
TAKING CENTER STAGE IN THE

9
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:20,030

00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:25,068
KAVANAUGH THEY TURN A BLIND

14
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:27,004
EYE TO ONE OF THEIR OWN.

15
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,005
SENATOR BROWN.

16
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:28,939
BROWN'S EX-WIFE TESTIFIED

17
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,741
UNDER OATH HE ABUSED HER.

18
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:32,142
THE COURT RECORDS PROVE IT.

19
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:33,644
RESTRAINING ORDER ISSUED TO

20
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:34,845
PROTECT HER WHICH BROWN

21
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:36,246
VIOLATED PHYSICALLY AND

22
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:37,614
VERBALLY ABUSING THE MOTHER OF

23
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:44,254
HIS CHILDREN.

24
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:45,989
END THE HYPOCRISY.

25
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,625
CALL HIM AND TELL BROWN TO

00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:49,059
RESIGN.

00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,360
>> Ed: WE ARE JOINED BY THE

28
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:51,862
MAKER OF THE AD.

29
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:53,297
GOOD EVENING, MARY.

30
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:54,598
SOME PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT AND

31
00:00:54,599 --> 00:01:01,572
SAY THAT IS A TOUGH SHOT.

32
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:02,773
BUT YOU BELIEVE THAT THE

33
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:04,107
DEMOCRATS WENT AFTER JUSTICE

34
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:07,110
KAVANAUGH NOW, AND WHAT IS

35
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:09,012
GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR

36
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:09,680
THE GANDER.

37
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:11,648
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE TO END THE

38
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:12,015
HYPOCRISY.

39
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:13,217
THEY ARE OKAY WITH CERTAIN

40
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:14,885
THINGS IF IT'S DEFENDING THE

41
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:15,319
RIGHT PERSON.

42
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,753
IF YOU LOOK IN THIS SITUATION

43
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:20,357
WHERE YOU HAD SENATOR BROWN

44
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:22,259
AND THE TORE DEMOCRATS

45
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,994
FIGHTING AGAINST THE NAM

46
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,762
MISSION TO OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH

47
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:26,830
AGAINST UNCORROBORATED

48
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:28,465
ALLEGATION.

49
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:31,702
BUT IN THIS CASE, SHERROD

50
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:34,872
BROWN HAS DOCUMENTED IN COURT

51
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:38,442
FILINGS OF HIS NOW EX-WIFE.

52
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:40,811
IT'S HYPOCRISY AND TIME FOR

53
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:41,712
BROWN TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

54
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:42,379
FOR THE ACTIONS.

55
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,047
WE ARE CALLING FOR HIM TO STEP

56
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:44,515
DOWN.

57
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,415
>> Ed: OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE

58
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,517
TALKING ABOUT THE COURT

59
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:48,652
RECORDS COMPARED TO UNCOB

60
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:53,123
RATED EVIDENCE THAT WAS

61
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:55,792
BROUGHT AGAINST KAVANAUGH.

62
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:57,728
THE DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING THIS

63
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,662
AD.

64
00:01:58,663 --> 00:02:00,163
RESPOND TO THAT.

65
00:02:00,164 --> 00:02:01,398
>> YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT

66
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,065
ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

67
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,767
I WANT TO SET THE RECORD

68
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:04,134
STRAIGHT.

69
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:05,502
DIVORCE CAN BE DIFFICULT AND

70
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:10,274
OURS WAS NO DIFFERENT.

71
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:11,842
BUT THE POLITICAL ATTACKS GWEN

72
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,176
OUR FAMILY ARE WRONG.

73
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:15,712
NOT ONLY AM I GLAD TO SHARE

74
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:17,014
FOUR WONDERFUL GRANDCHILDREN

75
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:19,917
BUT I COULDN'T BE PROUDER TO

76
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:22,152
HAVE SHERROD BROWN AS A

77
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:22,486
SENATOR.

78
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:26,256
I UNDERSTAND POLITICS CAN BE

79
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:27,658
NASTY BUT JIM SHOULD BE

80
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:28,058
ASHAMED.

81
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:28,992
>> Ed: THAT IS SENATOR

82
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:30,360
BROWN'S EX-WIFE.

83
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,695
YOU SAY THERE ARE DIVORCE

84
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:32,763
RECORDS TO SUGGEST THERE WERE

85
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:36,600
SERIOUS PROBLEMS HERE.

86
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,535
SHE IS TRYING TO SAY YOU

87
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,269
WEREN'T THERE AND I DON'T KNOW

88
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,870
WHAT HAPPENED.

89
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:41,004
THINGS WERE SAID AND DONE IN

90
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:42,839
THE MIDDLE OF THE DIVORCE

91
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,374
PEOPLE ARE NOT PROUD OF PULLED

92
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,242
OUT OF CONTEXT.

93
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:50,247
HOW DO YOU RESPOND?

94
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:51,748
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT THE COURT

95
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:53,083
PAPERS THAT WERE FILED COURT

96
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:54,384
IN THE DIVORCE PROCEEDING.

97
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,053
AND IT WAS ALLEGED IN THE

98
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,554
DOCUMENTS HE WAS ABUSIVE TO

99
00:02:57,555 --> 00:02:57,921
HIS WIFE.

100
00:02:57,922 --> 00:02:59,623
THERE WAS A RESTRAINING ORDER

101
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,391
AT ONE TIME AGAINST BROWN WHEN

102
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:07,364
HE WAS STILL MARRIED TO HER.

103
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:08,632
HE VIOLATED THE RESTRAINING

104
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:09,066
ORDER.

105
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,767
WE ARE GOING TO THE PUBLIC

106
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:11,134
DOCUMENTS.

107
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:12,269
NOW THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD.

108
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,905
WE ARE IN THE "ME TOO" ERA AND

109
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,506
THE VICTIMS ARE COMING OUT AND

110
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:17,174
SPEAKING UP.

111
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:18,709
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

112
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,880
VICTIMS HAVE A VOICE.

113
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:25,315
IN THE PAST BROWN DISMISSED

114
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,484
THIS AND CALLED IT A FAMILY

115
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:29,453
MATTER IS UNFORTUNATE.

116
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:31,788
WE WANT TO EMPOWER THE VICTIMS

117
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:32,656
TO SPEAK OUT.

118
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:35,359
WE ARE PULLING INFORMATION

119
00:03:35,360 --> 00:00:00,000
FROM COURT PROCEEDINGS AND A
