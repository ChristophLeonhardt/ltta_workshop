TODAY OR TOMORROW'S MEETING WILL TURN OUT. JOE WILSON, THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY. Jon: U.S. MILITARY OFFICIALS SAY MORE THAN 70 TALIBAN LEADERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE PAST WEEK IN SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN. THE TOP U.S. GENERAL IN AFGHANISTAN SPEAKING TO REPORTERS RIGHT NOW AT THE PENTAGON UPDATING A WAR THAT HAS STRETCHED MORE THAN 16 LONG YEARS. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JENNIFER GRIFFIN JOINS US FROM THE PENTAGON RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD FROM THE TOP U.S. GENERAL JOHN NICHOLSON, IN SIX MONTHS. THAT PRESS BRIEFING JUST WRAPPED UP AS WE SPEAK. U.S. OFFICIALS TELL ME THE INCIDENT YOU REFERENCED IN THE INTRODUCTION TOOK PLACE OVER THREE DAYS. U.S. MARINES TAR G *ETED WHAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE A MEETING OF TALIBAN LEADERS FROM ALL OVER AFGHANISTAN. THEY FIRED ROCKET ARTILLERY ON THE COMPOUND AND CLAIM TO HAVE KILLED MORE THAN 50 LEADERS LAST WEEK. A TALIBAN SPOKESMAN SAYS THIS IS U.S. PROPAGANDA. LAST MONTH THE U.S. MILITARY LAUNCHED THE SECOND LARGEST NUMBER OF AIR STRIKES IN THE PAST 6 1/2 YEARS, MORE THAN 500 AIR STRIKES IN APRIL ALONE. FAR MORE THAN IN IRAQ AND SYRIA DURING THE SAME PERIOD AS THE WAR AGAINST ISIS WINDS DOWN THERE, THE AIR STRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN IS RAMPING UP. RECENTLY U.S. DRONES KILLED DOZENS OF TALIBAN FIGHTERS ATTEMPTING TO TAKE OVER A WESTERN PROVINCE. IN JANUARY JETS ARRIVED IN KANDAHAR TO PROVIDE MORE COVER FOR AFGHAN TROOPS REDOUBLING EFFORTS TO GO AFTER THE TALIBAN'S LARGEST REVENUE SOURCE, NARCOTICS. DOZENS OF DRUG LABS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. TALIBAN ATTACKS CONTINUE, HOWEVER, ESPECIALLY IN THE CAPITAL KABUL WHERE TODAY A SUICIDE BOMBER WITH NINE OTHER ATTACKERS TRIED TO ENTER THE INTERIOR MINISTRY BUT WAS STOPPED BY AFGHAN FORCES. THERE ARE DOUBLE OF NUMBER OF TROOPS THERE SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. GENERAL NICHOLSON'S REPLACEMENT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED. SCOTT MILLER THE HEAD OF JOINT SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND WILL TAKE OVER IN NOVEMBER. HE WILL BE THE NINTH U.S. GENERAL IN 17 YEARS OVERSEEING
