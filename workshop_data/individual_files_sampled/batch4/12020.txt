speaking of me too we talked about this a little yesterday Alyssa Milano sent out a tweet which launched this huge social media campaign it's all over Facebook and Twitter she said and this is in response to the Harvey Weinstein scandal it turns out he raped like every aspiring actress in all of Hollywood and this is a widespread problem in Hollywood for a very long time now it's all coming to light people are talking about the horrific incidents that have happened to them and she tweeted out and said if you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write me too is replied to this tweet there's the problem this there are a few problems with this slacktivism with this hashtag activism but the first is in her launching it she says if you've been sexually assaulted or harassed those are categorically different things those are categorically different they're both bad we should stop both I suppose one is a is a heinous crime one is assaulting somebody's soul as well as their body violating their Liberty and the other is being rude and untoward and you know maybe the guy at the office winks at his secretary that's all terrible - quite different than rape and to conflate those two is offensive and disrespectful toward the victims of actual rape now a men are virtue signaling back because that's how the internet works with the hashtags hashtag I will and hashtag how I will change so here are just a few of them hashtag I will promote women's voices believe survivors and work to end rape culture and purity culture two sides of the same patriarchal coin how I will change I will listen to women more closely seeking to understand before seeking to be understood then if it helps I will act I will listen more learn more acknowledge more in support more I'm willing to have more courageous conversations or use those courageous words how courageous how I will change means acknowledging my own capacity for harmful behavior and taking responsibility for unlearning that toxicity I don't really take issue with the premise here that man can be dogs and they should behave themselves I take issue with the supposed prai's the shock the earnestness of the tweeters I think it's mostly feigned I think it's fake but some might be real because these people are utopians and they think that mankind can be perfected with just a few more regulations a little less freedom a little more effort that isn't going to happen and living in delusion will help nobody so let's dispel some of the delusion around this we begin with the courageous conversations what is courageous about echoing the dominant cultural meme what is courageous about saying you're always right I'm always wrong whatever the left tells us is true even if the statistics are spurious that's true I'll believe anything there isn't a rape culture in the United States that was one of the allegations there was a rape culture there is no rape culture in the United States rape happens because we're fallen people and crime happens and murder happens and awful things happen and will always happen because we're not going back to the Garden of Eden this isn't an earthly paradise and human nature isn't perfectible that's going to happen but you know the rape culture is this Pakistan that's a rape a culture that institutionalizes and through its own cultural mores creates venues in which rape is approved of that is a rape culture there is no approval of rape in the United States the to tweet a trending hashtag alleging rape culture undermines the rape culture right it undermines your own claim it's a defeater for your ridiculous argument the the hashtags too are empty virtue signaling it is saccharine it is it is a it's slacktivism that accomplishes nothing it reminds me of I don't know if people remember this Kony 2012 did you remember in 2011 or 2012 there is this I remember Michael do you remember this it was everywhere Kony 2012 he was some warlord in Uganda and some filmmaker said we're gonna stop Kony this year and then every little dummy on Twitter and Facebook posted about it and they felt they were doing something they felt they were accomplishing something they accomplished nothing he's still at large it's it is a useless it is to make yourself feel good to give the impression of doing something it I've heard this described about smoking cigars and I will acknowledge it the nice thing about smoking is you feel like you're due something but you're really just sitting down and not doing anything that's slacktivism Michelle Obama did this she held up a sign when those girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria the sign said no joke hashtag bringbackourgirls that's the Sun this is the courageous piece of paper or hashtag your husband is the President of the United States if you want to bring back the girls you can bring back the girls now perhaps the issue isn't as simple as all of that perhaps there are geopolitics at play that complicate things don't pretend that your hashtag is doing anything it's accomplishing absolutely nothing also don't tweet about it if you're a guy don't tweet I will I'm with you I these guys these like fake feminists sensitive earnest nice guys there are like the creepiest guys around do not but they are creeps I would not let my fiance near any of them they are women do not believe them the the feminist men protest too much methinks next if you've been raped go to the police go to the police do not go to your professor do not go to your administrator on campus do not pass go do not collect $200 it is a serious crime it is possibly the most serious crime if it has happened make sure that it is prosecuted to the full extent of the law we have a system for prosecuting crimes it's called the criminal justice system it's not the sort of crime to be dealt with by campus tribunals this leads into another aspect though we have a criminal justice system to protect the rights of the accusers but also to protect the rights of the accused so the people who have had a crime committed against them and also those of a accuse of doing it these campus tribunals have been absolutely demolishing the due process rights of the accused in in countless cases but a lot of the tweets that have been coming with I will or I you know this is what I will do they say that we'll always believe the people who allege that they have been raped Hillary Clinton said this during the campaign which is quite ironic because she smeared the people who alleged rape against her own husband someone might ask why would anyone make up a rape why would anyone they've been raped if they haven't I don't know it's pretty weird man but it does happen in just the last eight years there have been five instances five major instances of this presumably many others there was obviously the rolling stone uva rape hoax this was a major story in rolling stone a girl alleged she had been gang-raped at a fraternity it didn't happen the story absolutely fell apart they had to retract the whole thing at UC Santa Cruz a few years ago a girl paid someone on Craigslist to beat her up and then she alleged that she had been raped that also fell apart in 2013 a University of Wyoming student posted a rape threat against herself in a campus Facebook group that also was uncovered but not before it caused a lot of anxiety to the campus community a lot of other people 2009 a hospice Hofstra student had consensual sex with five guys at once her boyfriend found out and said you look like you've just had sex with a lot of guys and she said I've been raped he said go to the police she said no that I don't need to and then they went to the police anyway they arrested these guys they threw them in jail only because there happened to be a video of this event why don't want to know what were these guys let off the hook for it because it the video showed that it was consensual but nevertheless the allegation was made it could have ruined these guys lives in 2013 a University of Florida student falsely claims she was raped in a parking lot then she said it was false but intended to show a greater truth so she it was a complete lie but then it was the lie was meant to serve the greater truth and then later she admitted it's because her parents were pressuring her to graduate from college and she probably wasn't going to do that conservative columnist George Will was accused of not taking rape seriously in a letter by four Democratic senators because he made these exact same points and he responded in exactly the right way he said he said he takes a sexual assault and rape much more seriously than they do you know some would prefer it if professors and campus tribunals dealt with this crime some would prefer it if judges juries and executioner's dealt with it we in the latter category are taking this issue much more serious and the people who are engaging in frivolous slacktivism are doing nothing but hurting a very serious issue
