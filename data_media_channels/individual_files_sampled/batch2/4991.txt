I have known Kanye a little bit and I get along with Kanye Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country okay he sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country he sees by the way female unemployment women unemployment the lowest has been in now almost 19 years he sees that stuff and he's smart and he says you know what Trump is doing a much better job than the Democrats did Donald Trump is basking in the glow of one one celebrity's acceptance the same week that he's skipping a big celebrity draw the White House Correspondents Dinner the black tie affair affectionately known as nerd prom that features an annual parade of a listers journalists and politicians in a campaign fundraising email Trump explained his no-show saying quote why would I want to be stuck in a room with a bunch of fake news liberals who hate me instead trope will be hosting a campaign rally in Michigan for his diehard supporters back with me Jonathan Tara and Jimmy and joining the table is tor a host of the podcast the tarisha which is darn good and everybody should be listening to it so okay it's right to come to you on this turks does this whole Kanye thing I think it feels weird a lot of people he dropped a new single of course of course in conjunction to last night right and was not like we don't know what you mean like you're using nonsense words Englanders they stuffed the cream and then the other one he has a lyric in it that says I know Obama was heaven-sent but ever since Trump want it proved that I can be President we apply it oh let's play it let's go Trump wants a clue that I could be president I feel the obligation to show people new ideas and if you wanna hear - right here take the mayor to breathe again how the negative reception raka gave it a new direction so that tells me that this means an obligation to stay on the beam he tweets on Wednesday you don't have to agree with Trump but the mob can't make me not love him we're both we have both have dragon energy I don't know that is he's my brother I love everyone I don't agree with everything everyone does that makes us individuals we have the right to have an infinite father he's being loved bombed by the right who said shut up and seeing was this calculated was this all because he's dropping a single backdrop I mean sure I mean it's calculated like let's get some attention but I'm still trying to unpack what he really believes he's not saying he believes any of Trump's actual ideas but he likes his persona he likes the way that he can be sort of rude and an egotistical in public and that co-signs Kanye's way of beings were rude and egotistical in public and in the song he talks about that he has transformed Magga it's not that easy to transform a symbol just because Kanye puts on a hat doesn't make the Hat different right we still know what Magga means it does not include kanye it does not include us right is there's no empathy valga it's quite cold-hearted and hateful toward us and it's not about him being a free thinker it's about him free thinking his way to an ideology and co-signing analogy that is very hateful and hostile toward us his fans so what are you doing about what does he do I mean we were talking about this road we were had we were having a sort of behind the scenes on this tear and you had a very interesting thought on what he might be doing and why I think he was triggered by Kendrick Lamar getting the pilot surprise Kanye sees himself as this great intellectual as this creative genius as this person that has brought all the social commentary to the fore and so I think that there's a few things going on here I think that triggered him but I also think this was premeditated I mean if you look at the lyrics he clearly was planning some sort of media blitz around around this whole make America great in Trump and this is not his first foray with Trump he did it when he had the blonde hair the matter with Trump at Trump Tower I think Kanye is very similar in Trump to Trump in many ways I think he tries the master manipulate the media in order to make himself more relevant because let's face it in recent times he's not as relevant as he used to be dipped in the media in and of itself it's not the problem right Trump manipulated the media on behalf of white supremacy is the problem yeah that point though you have jay-z winning a Peabody Award for his excellent series on you know that the horrors of imprisonment as a teen of teenagers being in prison in New York and working on all these you know films and art installations and being really sort of celebrated of course being mr. Bay doesn't hurt either no but I am a huge Daisy fans let me just caveat that but you do have jay-z who's super relevant right now you have Kendrick Lamar just want appeal it sir could this just be competitive sort of desire to be relevant yes and it has a whole Dancing with the Stars jay-z is lauded as a visionary and looked at in a very respect respectable and respectful way and here you've got Kanye West the blond hair the blue contacts standing in that gilded Lobby with Donald Trump doing all this of my first thought was when he sent out those tweets was when's that album coming out yeah and then I just found out from you guys that it will two songs two songs just out yeah look I think if President Trump cuz there's word apparently that President Trump wants to have Kanye West dinner all you have to do is just say something nice about the president you get invited over but here's what I hear here's what I would say mr. president if you're going to invite someone to dinner someone black to dinner at the White House how about you invite James Shaw jr. the Waffle House here oh yeah a man who has shown more compassion more humility more what's the word I'm looking at and our more empathy this young man who saved lives yeah set up a GoFundMe page for the for the benefit of the of the survivors and then the family of the slain who is paying for the funerals of the slain that man James Shaw jr. has shown shown more grit and courage and Eric american-ness the President of the United States I wish the president spent more time he hasn't even tweeted about him hasn't talked about right yeah and and that's what I think the president should be spending his time on that's who I think he should be having dinner with yeah not Kanye this bid for relevance let me get Jimmy in here because Jimmy I old enough to remember when the right went absolutely you know they went off the rails angry that dot that a one President Barack Obama had common to the White House the idea that he would have rappers over to the White House was a terrible idea the idea that somebody like LeBron James will talk about politics was met with shut up and sing now all of a sudden the right is they could not be more giddy they are giddy that Donald Trump is friendly with Kanye West that Kanye West loves him welcome to the civil rights era of the GOP how new it is look I want to be remarkably clear about something I had to look up who Kanye West is oh and and and I'm sorry I don't I don't know his music or anything apparently he's married to someone famous too but but let me let me be clear about something as the only white person on this panel I don't care what Kanye West thinks or if he agrees with Donald Trump that is his First Amendment right which I will defend until his dying days good what I do care about is how Donald Trump treats african-americans and black Americans people of color and if Kanye West is blind to that that's Kanye West blind that's not mine I just think it would be smarter if the president would like to have African American celebrities behind him with him standing near him he does exactly what Jonathan Capehart did said which is bring an actual hero up as opposed to someone who thinks they're a hero yeah I have to come to you though on this you know Turei because I don't know how much people are conversant you know Jimmy said he's not converse was Kanye but I'm conversing with hip-hop's longtime relationship with Donald Trump Oh Donald Trump has been a fixture in the lyrics of hip-hop songs he's I believe when rap genius added up it was like two hundred and sixty-six times his name has been referenced over the years Trump used to open up Marlo go to the puppies of the world to the Russell Simmons of the world it's not like he's unknowns dog did roast of him I think it's one 2011 he used to kind of dovetail with hip hop and then so it's ironic though he's been dropped by hip hop cold turkey except Kanye I mean what is this about well I mean you know until recently we were not fully clear how deeply white supremacist and racist he is I mean when he was just this New York tabloid figure it was fun I remember a video from Tupac from like the nineties saying like yeah I want to be like Trump but he already means I want to be rich and just be my own person and not follow anybody's rules but now this modern white supremacist Trump Bull Connor Trump this is not something that we can just casually support yeah and Kanye is giving comfort to somebody whose policies and whose ideas are hostile to us and aggressively hostile and to say nothing of the other conservative pundit who he's lauded now he's given a big cosign to now she'll be on Fox News all the time this is problematic Connie has used the fame that we have given him to support somebody who is aggressively against us yeah what are we to make of that how we just continue to just support Kanye without going but who do you support yeah is that me maybe he's look I don't know he could find a brand-new audience I mean the right is over the moon so happy to have him right so now he has a whole new fan base amok with that hug Trump supporters right no they don't no they don't they don't no they don't have a whole new fan base he does not they don't know who he is away from losing them anyway I remember when he criticized Taylor Swift and said Beyonce was more talented than Taylor's right and I remember the write went nuts yeah I mean they were apoplectic when he did that so if he says something like chance the rapper who came out and sort of supported Kanye and now he's issued this response explaining that he was supporting Kanye not supporting Trump yeah now all of these people who followed him on Twitter because they thought he was aligned with Kanye and aligned with Trump all these people on the right have now unfollowed him in are attacking him right so if he says if Kanye says anything that runs afoul of the agenda that the right head then they're gonna back away from him yeah all right well thank you Jonathan Capehart Tara Dell and turay and jimmy williams thank you guys for trying to explain this to us coming up at the top of the hour new reports but Donald Trump is considering making his chief of staff John Kelly wait for it the next Secretary of Veterans affair that would be his third job in
