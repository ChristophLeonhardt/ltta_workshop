SECRETARY, JIM MATTIS, EXPERTS AT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. MELISSA: WE HAVE ENGLISH NOW. YOU CAN LISTEN TO IRAN SUPREME LEADER. THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC IS NEVER BEEN AFTER NUCLEAR WEAPONS. YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT ROUHANI. NNUCLEAR WEAPONS AND OTHER WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION HAS NO PLACE IN IRAN'S SECURITY AND DEFENSE DOCTRINE AND CONTRADICT OUR CONVICTIONS. THIS IS FROM THE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER. WE CONSIDER NUCLEAR WEAPONS IRRATIONAL AND IMMORAL. WELL, TONIGHT I AM HERE TO TELL YOU ONE THING. IRAN LIED. BIG TIME. AFTER SIGNING THE NUCLEAR DEAL IN 2015, IRAN INTENSIFIED ITS EFFORTS TO HIDE THE SECRET NUCLEAR FILES. IN 2017, IRAN MOVED ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON'S FILED TO A HIGHLY SECRET DISTRICT IN SOUTHERN TEHERAN. THIS IS WHERE THEY KEPT THE ATOMIC ARCHIVES RIGHT HERE. FEW IRANIANS KNEW WHERE IT WAS. VERY FEW. AND ALSO FEW ISRAELIS. NOW FROM THE OUTSIDE, THIS WAS AN INNOCENT LOOKINGLY COMPOUND AND LOOKS LIKE A DILAPIDATED WAREHOUSE. BUT FROM THE INSIDE IT CONTAINED THE IRANIAN ATOMIC ARCHIVES AND LOOK BIGGER THAN THIS. AND IN A GREAT INTELLIGENCE ACHIEVEMENT A FEW WEEKS AGO, ISRAEL OBTAINED HALF A TON OF THE MATERIAL INSIDE OF THESE VAULT AND THIS IS WHAT WE GOT. 55000 PAGES, ANOTHER 55000 FILES ON 183 CD'S. EVERYTHING YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE, IS AN EXACT COPY OF THE ORIGINAL IRANIAN MATERIAL. YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW WHERE ARE THE ORIGINALS? THEY ARE NOW IN A VERY SAFE PLACE. THIS IS WHAT THE FILES INCLUDED. INCRIMINATING DOCUMENTS, INCRIMINATING CHARTS. INCRIMINATING PRESENTATION AND BLUE PRINTING. INCRIMINATING VIDEOS. AND MORE. WE'VE SHARED THIS MATERIAL WITH THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED STATES CAN VOUCH FOR ITS AUTHTENSITY. AND WE'LL SHARE IT WITH THE OTHER COUNTRIES THE ATOMIC INTERNATIONAL AGENCY. WE'LL TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF THE MATERIAL. WE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT IRAN HAD A SECRET NUCLEAR PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT AMAD. WE CAN PROVE IT WAS A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO DESIGN, BUILD AND TEST NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE CAN ALSO PROVE THAT IRAN IS SECRETLY STORING PROJECT AMAD MATERIAL TO USE AT A TIME OF ITS CHOICE TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THIS IS WHAT PROJECT AMAD'S SPECIFIC GOAL WAS CREATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THIS IS AN ORIGINAL IRANIAN PRESENTATION FROM THE FILE AND THIS IS THE MISSION STATEMENT. DESIGN, PRODUCE AND TEST FIVE WARHEADS, EACH WITH TEN KILOTON TNT YIELD FOR INTEGRATION ON A MISSILE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ PH ARSEE TO READ THIS HERE. THIS IS SPECIFIC GOAL OF PROJECT AMAD. THAT IS LIKE FIVE HIRO SHIMMA BOMBS ON THE MISSILES. THIS IS AN ORIGINAL IRANIAN SPREADSHEET. YELLOW CAKE. AND CENTERFUDGE AND TEST. AND WHEN WE ANALYZED WHAT IS IN THE ARCHIVES. PROJECT AMAD HAD FIVE KEY ELEMENTS OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON'S PROGRAM. I WILL TAKE THEM ONE BY ONE. FIRST ELEMENT IS DESIGNING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THIS IS AN ORIGINAL IRANIAN ILLUSTRATION OF A WEAPON. AGAIN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ PH ARSI TO UNDERSTAND. THAT IS ENRICHED URANIUM. THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE YOU FIND IN THE CORE ENRICHED URANIUM. AND THAT IS PUTTING ALL OF THE COMPONENTS TOGETHER. THAT'S THE FIRST COMPONENT. SECOND COMPONENT, DEVELOPING NUCLEAR CORES. THIS IS A PHOTOSHOWING THE CASTING PROCESS AND A CAST METAL CORE FROM THE ARCHIVES AND HERE IS A SECRET UNDERGROUND FACILITIES THE IRANIANS ARE BUILDING TO PRODUCE THE NUCLEAR CORES. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS. THIRD COMPONENT. BUILDING SYSTEMS OF A MEASURING DEVICE FOR IMPLOSIONS. AND THIS IS A SIMULATION OF A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION. FOURTH ELEMENT. PREPARING NUCLEAR TEST. THIS IS A MAP OF FIVE POTENTIAL AREAS FOR NUCLEAR TEST IN EASTERN IRAN. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. AND FIFTH. INTEGRATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON MISSILES AND THIS IS A DESIGN FOR A NUCLEAR PAY LOAD FROM THE ARCHIVE. HERE IS THE WAR HEAD. AND HERE IS THE BOMB. AND I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT IRAN IS EXPANDING THE RANGE OF BALLISTIC NUCLEAR CAPABLE MISSILES STARTING WITH A THOUSAND KILOMBETERS AND NOW RYAD. TEL AVIV, MOSCOW, BUT THEY ARE WORKING ON FAR, FAR GREATER RANGES. THEY ARE PLANNING MUCH LONGER RANGE MISSILES TO CARRY NUCLEAR WEAPONS. SO THESE FILES CONCLUSIVELY PROVE THAT IRAN IS IT BRAZENLY LYING WHEN IT SAID IT NEVER HAD A NUCLEAR WEAPON'S PROGRAM. THE FILES PROVE THAT. AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. IRAN WAS FACED WITH MOUNTING PRESSURE IN 2003 FOLLOWING THE GULF WAR AND IT WAS FORCED TO SHELVE PROJECT AMAD BUT NOT THE NUCLEAR AMBITIONS. AND SO IRAN DEVISED A PLAN TO DO TWO THINGS. PRESERVE THE NUCLEAR KNOW HOW FROM PROJECTA MAD. AND NUCLEAR WEAPON'S CAPABILITYINGLY THAT CAME FROM THE TOP LEADERSHIP OF IRAN. THIS IS ANOTHER DOCUMENT FROM THE ARCHIVE. THIS IS FOLLOWING THE NEW DIRECTIVE OF THE IRAN'S MINISTER OF DEFENSE, TODAY HE IS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND FOLLOWING THE NEW DIRECTIVE OF IRAN'S MINISTER OF DEFENSE, THE WORK WOULD BE SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS: COVERT AND OVERT. A KEY PART OF THE PLAN WAS TO FORM NEW ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTINUE THE WORK. THIS IS HOW DR. HEAD OF PUT IT. REMEMBER THAT NAME. HERE IS HIS DIRECTOR. THE GENERAL AIM IS TO ANNOUNCE THE CLOSURE OF PROJECT AMAD. BUT SPECIAL ACTIVITIES, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, SPECIAL ACTIVITIES WILL BE CARRIED OUT UNDER THE TITLE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOW HOW DEVELOPMENT. AND IN FACT, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IRAN PROCEEDED TO DO. IT HAS CONTINUED THE WORK IN A SERIES OF ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE YEARS, AND TODAY IN 2010 AND 2018 THIS WORK IS CARRIED OUT BY SUPON. THAT IS AN ORGANIZATION INSIDE OF THE IRANIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY AND YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN IT IS LED BY THE SAME DOCTOR FAK I DOCTOR FAK IRI DOCTOR FAK IRIZA DOCTOR FAK IRIZA D DOCTOR FAK IRIZA D EH DOCTOR FAK IRIZA D EH. IRAN PLANNED IN THE HIGHEST LEVELS TO CONTINUE WORK RELATED TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNDER THE DIFFERENT GUISES AND USE THE SAME PERSONNEL. I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF IRAN'S NUCLEAR WEAPON'S RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT CONTINUED AFTER PROJECT AMAD. YOU REMEMBER THE FORDO FACILITY? IT WAS A SECRET ENRICHMENT FACILITY UNDERGROUND THAT THE IRANIANS BUILT UNDER A MOUNTAIN. YOU DON'T PUT THOUSANDS OF CENTRIFUGES UNDER A MOUNTAIN TO PRODUCE MEDICAL IOTONIGHTS. YOU PUT THEM ONE REASON. ENRICHMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. BUT FORDOW WAS DESIGNED FOR NUCLEAR PROSPECTS AS PROJECT AMAD. THIS IS AN ORIGINAL IRANIAN BLUE PRINT MUCH FORDOW AND IRAN CONTINUED TO BUILD YEARS AFTER PROJECT AMADDENEDED AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. THAT'S THE ENTRANCE AND IT GOES UNDER A MOUNTAIN. YOU WILL ALSO NOT BE SURPRISED IRAN INSISTED ON KEEPING FORDOW AND AMAZINGLY THE NUCLEAR DEAL ENABLED THEM TO DO IT. BUT THIS CAME WITH A HITCH. IRAN WAS REQUIRED BY THE IEA TO COME CLEAN BY THE NUCLEAR DEAL, TO COME CLEAN TO THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY ABOUT THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. THIS WAS A CONDITION FOR IMPLEMENTING THE NUCLEAR DEAL. IRAN HAS TO COME CLEAN. SUE ON DECEMBER 2015 IA EA PUBLISHED THE NUCLEAR ASPECT. THIS IS THE REPORT. THIS WAS IRAN'S CHANCE TO FULLY AND THEY COULD TELL THE TRUTH AND WE HAVE A SECRET PROGRAM AND IT IS OVER AND WE SHELVED IT AND IT DOESN'T EXIST AND WE DESTROY IT DOESN'T EXIST AND WE DESTRO DESTROYED THE MATERIAL. IRAN SAID IRAN DENIED THE EXISTENCE OF A COORDINATED PROGRAM AIMED A SPECIFIC NUCLEAR DEVICE AND DENIED THE EXISTENCE OF THE AMAD PLAN. AND THE MATERIAL PROVES OTHERWISE. THAT IRAN AUTHORIZED AND INITIATED AND FUNDED PROJECT AMAD. AND AIMED AT A DEVELOPMENT OF A NUCLEAR DEVICE AND THIS IS ANOTHER DOCUMENT FROM THE ARCHIVES AND IT WAS A MASTER PLAN OF PROJECT AMAD. IRAN SAID TO THE IAEA, NO WORK WAS CONDUCTED WITH MULTIPOINT INITIATION. THIS SCIENTIFIC TERMINOLOGY IS SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCTION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY. NO WORK HAS BEEN CONDUCTED WITH MPI TECHNOLOGY IN HEM FEARICAL GEOMETRY. THIS IS IT A FABRICATION. IRAN CONDUCTED EXTENSE ITCH WORK WITH MPI. HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS PROVE. IT AND IRAN SAID TO THE AGENCY, THAT IT HAD NOT EXPECTED WORKS DESIGNED FOR A NUCLEAR DEVICE. BUT THE FILES AGAIN SHOW IT IS IT A LIE. IRAN CONDUCTED METALLURGICAL WORK FOR A NUCLEAR DEVICE. THERE IS PLENTY MORE IN THE ARCHIVES. AND SO WHAT I HAVE SHOWN YOU TONIGHT IS A FRACTIONS OF THE TOTAL MATERIAL THAT WE HAVE. BUT EVEN FROM THIS SAMPLE YOU CAN DRAW FOUR MAIN CONCLUSIONS. FIRST IRAN LIED ABOUT NEVER HAVING A NUCLEAR WEAPON 'PROGRAM. 100,000 SECRET FILES PROVED THAT THEY LIED. AND SECOND, EVEN AFTER THE DEAL, IRAN CONTINUED TO PRESERVE AND EXPAND THE NUCLEAR WEAPON'S KNOW HOW FOR FUTURE NUCLEAR WORSE. WHY WOULD A TERRORIST REYEEM HIDE AND METICULOUSLY CATALOG THE SECRET NUCLEAR FILES IF NOT TO USE THEM AT A LATER DATE? THIRD, IRAN LIED AGAIN IN 2015 WHEN IT DIDN'T COME CLEAN TO THE IAEAN ON THE NUCLEAR DEAL? AND FINALLY, THE IRAN DEAL, THE
