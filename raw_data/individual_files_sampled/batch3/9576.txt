AND FLIPPED THE SENATE SEAT FROM BLUE TO RED. LET’S GET BACK TO THE QUESTIONS. Bret: GENTLEMEN, IF YOU WOULD, WELCOME BACK, IF YOU WOULD PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU WOULD SUPPORT MITCH McCONNELL FOR REPUBLICAN LEADER IN THE SENATE. Bret: WE NOTED YOUR . WE GOT THAT. YOU’VE BEEN A BENEFICIARY OF GROUPS, WHY WOULDN’T YOU SUPPORTED? MITCH McCONNELL HAS AN EVEN ASK FOR MY SUPPORT. I THINK IT’S WAY TOO PREMATURE. I THINK CANDIDLY MITCH McCONNELL DESERVES A DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR BEING ABLE TO HOLD A SUPREME COURT SEAT OPEN SO NEIL GORSUCH COULD BE ON THE SUPREME COURT TODAY. WHAT I’M INTERESTED IN DOING IS GETTING THROUGH THE NOVEMBER ELECTION BRINGING A MUCH-NEEDED REPUBLICAN VOTE TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THEN WE WILL SEE WHO’S RUNNING FOR SENATE. I’M NOT RULING ANYBODY END, I’M NOT RULING ANYBODY OUT. NOBODY HAS ASKED FOR MY SUPPORT. WHAT I WOULD DO IS MAKE A DECISION ON WHO IS GOING TO LEAD THE SENATE TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT TRUMP AGENDA. Bret: I’M NOTICING YOU ARE NOT RAISING YOUR HAND EITHER. I’M NOT THE PRODUCT OF THE LIBERAL ESTABLISHMENT. I THINK THAT’S WHY YOU ARE SAYING ALL THE CONSERVATIVES COME OUT FOR ME. I’M GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AFTER WE GET THROUGH THE GENERAL ELECTION, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I WAS THE ONE RECRUITED BY THE LIBERAL ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE OF HIS VERY QUESTIONABLE RECORD. ONCE AGAIN, OBAMACARE SUPPORT, CAP AND TRADE SUPPORT. DONATING TO JOE MANSON HOLDING A FUND-RAISER AT HIS HOUSE. THAT’S NOT THE WEST VIRGINIA VALUES. WE NEED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON. B1 LET ME STAY WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT THANK YOU. UNFORTUNATELY PATRICK MORRISEY CONTINUES TO SPEW HIS ALLIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS. THEY SAID DON’T BRING OUT ANY PAPERS. WE HAD POLITIFACT AND ALL THE THINGS THAT PATRICK IS SAYING, SUPPORTING HILLARY, PLANNED PARENTHOOD, CAP AND TRADE. POLITIFACT WENT THROUGH EACH AND EVERY ALLEGATION AND SAID FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE AND UNFORTUNATELY PATRICK THINKS IF YOU KEEP SAYING IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN PEOPLE WILL THINK IT’S TRUE. PATRICK MORRISEY, POLITIFACT, EVERYBODY HAS DEBUNKED EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID. YOU STOOD NEXT TO ME AND ADORES ME THREE YEARS AGO AND SAID I WAS RIGHT FOR WEST VIRGINIA. WHAT’S DIFFERENT NOW? EVAN, I DIDN’T KNOW AT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO LIE SO MUCH AND AS MERGERS OR WEARABLE BACKGROUND. I WON’T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN. Martha: MOVING RIGHT ALONG, AN ENDORSEMENT FROM STEVE BANNON. PRESIDENT TRUMP RECENTLY SAID MY LOVE TO SPEAK ABOUT McCONNELL? Martha: YOU WILL. HE SAID WHEN HE WAS FIRED HE NOT ONLY LOST HIS JOB, HE LOST HIS MIND. THE LAST PERSON THAT STEVE BANNON ENDORSED WAS ROY MOORE. IS THIS AN ASSOCIATION THAT YOU’RE PROUD OF? I SAID AT THE TIME THAT IT HAPPENED WHEN HE WENT AFTER TRUMP I THOUGHT IT WAS REPREHENSIBLE. YOU DON’T GO AFTER FAMILY MEMBERS. YOU JUST DON’T DO THAT. THOSE ARE JUST NOT WEST VIRGINIA VALUES. AND WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS THAT WE HAVE A BROAD ARRAY OF SUPPORT SPECTRUM. SENATOR TED CRUZ, SENATOR RAND PAUL. WE HAVE WEST VIRGINIANS FOR LIFE. WE HAVE ALL THE PRINCIPAL CONSERVATIVE LEADERS PACKING MY CANDIDACY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THERE’S A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY RECORD GOING AFTER OBAMA’S OVERREACH AND HIS RECORD AND THIS IS A FACT, RALLYING FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND WORKING SIDE-BY-SIDE ON THE OBAMA TEAM. IT TOOK HIM FIVE YEARS TO GET OFF THE BARACK OBAMA TEAM. THAT’S OPPORTUNISM, NOT PRINCIPLE. Bret: WE WILL GET THERE. CONGRESSMAN JENKINS, DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND AND WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR IN 2008? I WILL TELL YOU I DID NOT VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON. I AM PROUD TO REPORT THE REPUBLICAN. THEY WENT BACK AND FACT-CHECKED AND LOOK AT EVERY COMMENT I EVER MADE AND SAID PATRICK MORRISEY IS LYING. THE PROBLEM IS PATRICK MORRISEY WON’T LOOK AT THE CAMERA, WON’T LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA AND SAY WHY HE DID NOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT IN THE MAY PRIMARIES. HE’S THE ONE WHO SAID PUBLICLY DONALD TRUMP WASN’T MY FIRST CHOICE. WHO WAS YOUR FIRST CHOICE? LET ME BE CLEAR, AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. THEN THE ONLY CANDIDATE ON THE STAGE WHO NOT ONLY HAS VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP AT THE CONVENTION AND IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. WE SAID WE COULDN’T BRING PAPER UP BUT I WAS ONE OF ONLY FIVE PEOPLE IN WEST VIRGINIA TO BE PART OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. PEOPLE THAT ARE TRUSTED TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT GET TO BE IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. BUT EVAN JENKINS, WE KNOW IN 2008, IN 2007 ACTUALLY HE RALLIED FOR HILLARY CLINTON. HE SUPPORTED JOHN KERRY FOR PRESIDENT. IT’S A VERY LIBERAL BACKGROUND AND YOU SAID YOUR PHILOSOPHY WAS PROGRESSIVE MAINSTREAM BACK IN 2003. WHAT CHANGED WITH YOU? WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR IN THE MAY PRIMARY IN WEST VIRGINIA? I ENDORSED AND VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR? I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT AND THAT’S WHY JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN I SAT NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT AND EVAN WAS THERE AS WELL, THAT WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. WE WORK TOGETHER. I WAS PROUD TO RUN ADS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND SUPPORTED HIM AT THE CONVENTION. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE EVAN SUPPORTED HIM THE DAY BEFORE THE PRIMARY. THAT’S NO PROFOUND COURAGE. Bret: TO YOUR WISH YOUR. CAN I GO AHEAD AND COMMENT ABOUT SOMETHING? YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL? THEY TALKED ABOUT IT ENOUGH THAT I THINK I CAN CLARIFY. Bret: BOTH THESE GENTLEMEN MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE RULES THAT YOU COULDN’T BRING PAPER, PROPS. YOU ARE GOING TO BRING PROPS AND WE HAD TO KIND OF TAKE THEM AWA AWAY. YOU HAD THESE HATS THAT SAID DITCH MITCH. HE WANTED TO WEAR ONE OF THESE HATS. IT WAS AGAINST THE RULES. SO WE SAID NO TO THAT, BUT YOU HAVE CALLED THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER A HOST OF DIFFERENT NAMES, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY COCAINE MITCH, IN REFERENCE TO AN ALLEGATION THAT DRUGS WERE FOUND ON THE SHIP IN 2014 OWNED BY HIS FATHER-IN-LAW. HERE’S THE QUESTION. IF YOU ARE ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE AND MITCH McCONNELL IS THE MAJORITY LEADER, HOW WILL YOU GET ANYTHING DONE FOR WEST VIRGINIA? HE WILL BE THE MAJORITY LEADER. LET ME CLARIFY THAT BOTH OF THESE GUYS ARE RIGHT. THEY ARE BOTH LYING. ANYBODY THAT TELLS YOU THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GO TO WASHINGTON, D.C., AND DRAIN THE SWAMP AND DON’T KNOW WHETHER THEY WILL VOTE FOR MITCH McCONNELL ARE NOT IS NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH BECAUSE McCONNELL HAS TO GO TO DRAIN THE SWAMP. WHEN HE WENT TO D.C. 35 YEARS AGO THE NATIONAL DEBT WAS $2 TRILLION AND NOW THE NATIONAL DEBT IS $22 TRILLION. $20 TRILLION WHILE MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN THERE. HE HAS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH CHINA. HIS FAMILY IS VERY POWERFUL IN CHINA AND VERY POWERFUL IN THE UNITED STATES. ONE OF THE FATE OF THE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO FACE IS ECONOMIC DEALINGS WITH CHINA WHERE THEY NOW HAVE THE $358 BILLION SURPLUS OVER US AND TRADE. HE’S ALSO GOING TO FACE ISSUES ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND A WHOLE SOURCE OF OTHER THINGS. MITCH McCONNELL WAS ONE OF THE FEW SENATORS THAT VOTED AFTER TIANANMEN SQUARE NOT TO HAVE PUNITIVE ACTIONS AGAINST CHINA FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THEY KILLED 500,000 500T TIANANMEN SQUARE. YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHAT HE’S DOING. IF HE WANTS SOMETHING ELSE COMING HE INTERFERES WITH ELECTIONS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. HE IS INTERFERING WITH THIS ELECTION. HOW ARE THESE GUYS GOING TO STAND UP WHEN HE TELLS THEM TO SIT DOWN WHEN SCHUMER TELLS JOE MANCHIN TO SIT DOWN, WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE HOLDING FOR HIM FOR HAVING ELECTED THEM. THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE SO MUCH POWER IS THEY CONTROL THESE SUPER PACS AND IF THESE SUPER PACS THAT THESE GUYS ARE AFRAID OF AND THAT’S WHAT JOE MANCHIN PROBABLY MEANS WHEN HE SAYS THAT SCHUMER IS TOO POWERFUL. McCONNELL IS NO DIFFERENT. IF THEY TELL YOU THEY’RE GOING TO DRAIN THE SWAMP BUT THEY DON’T KNOW IF THEY WILL VOTE FOR McCONNELL OR NOT, CAN’T BE TRUE. Bret: LET ME JUST CLARIFY HERE Bret: LET ME JUST CLARIFY. WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL’S FAMILY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FATHER OF THE CURRENT SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP’S SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION, THE FATHER WHO YOU CALLED A CHINA PERSON. SHE IS A KEY DECIDER IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WHICH MIGHT BE A BIG DEAL IN WEST VIRGINIA. HOW DO YOU GET ALONG AND GET THINGS DONE BY SLINGING INSULTS LIKE THAT? I’M NOT GOING TO D.C. TO GET ALONG, SO THAT WILL BE A FAILURE BECAUSE I DON’T INTEND TO GET ALONG. I INTEND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THIS IDEA THAT CALLING SOMEONE A CHINA PERSON I’M AN AMERICAN PERSON. I DON’T SEE THIS INSINUATION BY THE PRESS THAT THERE’S SOMETHING RACIST ABOUT SAYING CHINA PERSON. SOME PEOPLE ARE KOREAN PERSONS SOME OF THEM ARE AFRICAN PERSONS. IT’S NOT ANY SLANDER THERE. BUT BOTH FAMILIES ARE VERY POWERFUL IN BOTH COUNTRIES. I’VE PREVIOUSLY BEEN ON THE BOARD OF FOUR OR FIVE MAJOR CORPORATIONS. YOU DO NOT SEND FAMILY MEMBERS OUT TO NEGOTIATE PURCHASES AND DEALS WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. IT’S CALLED A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. Martha: WE WANT TO GET A QUICK ANSWER IF WE CAN FROM EACH ONE OF YOU ON THIS. RIGHT NOW THERE IS A BIPARTISAN BILL IN CONGRESS TO PREVENT PRESIDENT FROM BEING ABLE TO FIRE ROBERT MUELLER, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IN THE INVESTIGATION. IN OTHER WORDS, SHOULD THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL? MR. MORRISSEY FIRST. THE PRESIDENT IS THE HEAD OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND I DO THINK HE HAS A LOT OF SAY OVER WHO WAS IN HIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. WITH RESPECT TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, I THINK IT NEEDS TO COME TO AN END. IT’S A WITCH HUNT. WE NEED TO STOP THAT. Martha: DO THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD FIRE ROBERT MUELLER? I THINK THIS SHOULD COME TO AN END. IF IT CAME TO AN END VERY QUICKLY THAT WE WOULDN’T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL THIS ENDLESS STRING OF ACCUSATIONS. IT’S DISTRACTING TO THE PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD THINGS FOR WEST VIRGINIA AND OUR COUNTRY. DEREGULATING THE ECONOMY, GOOD SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. HE’S DOING A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS. I THINK THAT’S A SIDESHOW AND IT SHOULD COME TO AN END. Martha: PFISTER TRINKETS, BIPARTISAN GROUP THAT GOT TOGETHER, THEY WOULD LIKE TO RESTRICT THE PRESIDENT ON THIS, WHAT DO YOU SAY? I AM VERY CLEAR, AND THIS INVESTIGATION NOW. I’VE SEEN THE DOCUMENTS, I’VE SEEN COMEY’S OUTRAGEOUS LEAKS. I HAVE SEEN THE WITCH HUNT THAT HAS GONE AFTER THIS ADMINISTRATION. THE DEMOCRATS CAN’T GIVE UP ON THE RESULTS OF 2016. THEY ARE FIGHTING THIS ADMINISTRATION EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND THIS INVESTIGATION NOW. Martha: MR. BLANKENSHIP? I HAD A LITTLE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THEY LIE A LOT TOO. IT’S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY GOES ON IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE YOU WONDER WHERE THIS COUNTRY IS GOING, IT’S REALLY CRAZY. THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE ENDED BEFORE I GET THERE IN JANUARY, SO IT SHOULD BE OKAY. Bret: TO EVERYONE ON THE STAGER, ASK A QUESTION TO EVERYONE, THIS IS ON THE ISSUE OF COAL. SENATOR JOE MANCHIN IS WORKING WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO PROTECT THE COAL INDUSTRY BY INVOKING A NATIONAL SECURITY LAW DECADES-OLD MUCH LIKE THEY HAVE DONE FOR THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE SENATOR ON THAT? MR. BLANKENSHIP? ON THE TERRACE? Bret: TRYING TO PROTECT THE COAL INDUSTRY USING THAT SAME WALL. I THINK THAT THE PROTECTION HAS TO BE USED VERY CAREFULLY. I DO AGREE WITH IT IN THIS CASE. WE GOT SO MANY PRODUCTS COMING IN THE U.S., WHETHER IT’S STEEL, COAL, WHATEVER. THE HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT AREN’T BEING PAID INTO A GREAT EXTENT THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF THAT. ALL THE WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN VICTIMS PURCHASES DO NOT PAY ANY TAXES FOR THE ROADS, THEY DO NOT PAY TAXES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. THEY DO NOT PAY TAXES FOR YOUR MEDICAL CARE SO WHEN YOU BUY THAT PRODUCT IT LOOKS INEXPENSIVE BUT IT’S ACTUALLY VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IF THOSE PRODUCTS WERE BEING MADE BY AMERICAN WORKERS THEY WOULD BE PAYING TAXES THAT WOULD HELP BALANCE THE BUDGET, HELP PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE, HELP GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND FIX THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. IT’S A VERY DANGEROUS, SLIPPERY SLOPE TO GO DOWN AND THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ANALYTICALLY AND IT NEEDS TO BE A SITUATION WHERE ALL 132 COUNTRIES ARE LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT TO CONSIDER END OF THE PRODUCTS NEED TO BE LOOKED AT INDIVIDUALLY AND WE NEED TO TAX THE PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN MAKE COST-EFFECTIVELY HERE AND PROVIDE AMERICAN JOBS. Bret: ON THE SAME THING I THINK WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE TO BRING COAL BACK. HERE’S WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. UNDER BARACK OBAMA HE HAD AN ABSOLUTE ASSAULT ON COAL MINERS JOBS AND WHEN I GOT IN IN 2013 I SUED THE EPA. BY 2016 WE HAVE THAT HISTORIC SUPREME COURT WIN STOPPING PRESIDENT OBAMA’S TOP INITIATIVE. THAT WAS A BIG WIN. WE SAVED THOUSANDS OF COAL MINER JOBS. A LOT OF DAMAGE WAS DONE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THEY BASICALLY TRY TO FORCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE UTILITIES TO FORCE UTILITIES TO CLOSE DOWN, STOP BURNING AS MUCH COAL. I DO THINK WHETHER IT’S LOOKING AT ISSUES OF NATIONAL SECURITY OR MY RECENT PROPOSAL, WHICH IS GOING TO JURY RIG, SPIT UP THE AMOUNT OF THAT COAL PRODUCTION IN OUR COUNTRY BY RELIEVING THEM OF SOME OF THE REGULATORY BURDENS IN PLACE AT THE EPA, WE SHOULD DO ALL OF THE ABOVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WEST VIRGINIA HAS A CHANCE TO RECOUP BECAUSE IT WAS A WAR ON WEST VIRGINIA. Bret: LET ME ASK YOU THIS JUST QUICKLY. IF YOU DID THAT, HOW DOES THAT MATCH UP WITH YOUR SMALL CONSERVATIVE VALUES, SMALLER GOVERNMENT? WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING HERE. DO YOU THINK SENATOR TED CRUZ ARE CENTERED AROUND PAUL WOULD BE FOR DOING WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING? I THINK THAT ALL OF THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH GETTING BACK TO A PLACE ONE BARACK OBAMA SAYS HE’S GOING TO PUT A WHOLE INDUSTRY AND COAL MINERS OUT OF BUSINESS, ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS GET BACK TO SOME LEVEL PLAYING FIELD TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW COAL MINERS TO MIND AGAIN. I THINK IT TAKES ENSURING THAT THERE WILL BE MARKETS. I’M THE MOST FREE-MARKET GUY HERE ON THE STAGE BUT I WOULD SAY THIS, WHEN YOU HAVE DAMAGE THAT IS INFLICTED THAT IS SO SEVERE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN MINE AND SELL COAL AGAIN. I THINK YOU ARE GIVING JOE MANCHIN WAY TOO MUCH CREDIT. YOU ARE REPEATING EXACTLY WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO THINK. THE PROBLEM IS JOE IS NOT A FIGHTER FOR COAL. HE SAYS ONE THING AND HE DOES ANOTHER. JOE MANCHIN SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA. JOE MANCHIN FOUGHT HARD TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON. HE IS CAUSING OUR PAIN. I STOOD THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE SIGNED THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT SAVED ONE-THIRD OF ALL THE COAL MINING JOBS IN AMERICA. THAT’S MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND WE ALREADY SEE THE RESULTS WITH LESS REGULATION, JOBS ARE COMING BACK. IT’S UNBELIEVABLE. PATRICK MORRISEY TALKING ABOUT LIMITED GOVERNMENT. HE TOOK A PLEDGE IN A CAMPAIGN TO ELIMINATE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. WE ARE IN MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA. HUNDREDS OF JOBS RIGHT HERE UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO FUND A FUTURE FOR COAL. WE DON’T NEED TO ELIMINATE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, WE NEED TO FIND A COLD FUTURE. THESE ARE IMPORTANT JOBS. Bret: WE HAVE TO HEAD TO BREAKER. VERY QUICKLY. I FIND IT VERY RICH THAT THE
