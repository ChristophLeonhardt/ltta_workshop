with the new administration coming in there's some question over what the Justice Department will do the the federal government is so far taken a pretty hands-off approach to states that legalized even though marijuana is illegal under federal law are you concerned about what the federal government might do there and what sort of mess would that create if the federal government decided that it wanted to enforce laws against marijuana in states that have legalized well it could create as much of a mess as the Attorney General wanted to create if the president held still for it I'm it's pretty clear the Attorney General thinks that or at least he said he thought that the administration was doing the wrong thing by acquiescing in these state license violations of federal law I assume that the career staff there is giving advice and he may actually already know this that didn't have much choice why is that because there are 4,000 DEA agents worldwide there were 500,000 state and local cops if a state doesn't want to enforce its cannabis laws the federal government really can't step into those shoes and again this is hard constitutional doctrine the federal government may not require a state to make something criminal or to help enforce a federal law so yeah if if the Justice Department wanted to shut all the legal markets down they could do that within weeks at very low resource cost they go in to the state regulatory agencies they get all the latest applications which I think are public record but if not they can subpoena them they take that pack of applications to the nearest US federal district court and say your honor here of people who have signed an application for permission to commit a federal felony put Pleet please and join them from doing so that injunction issues let even hearing familiar on the other side and then use the contempt power to enforce it so they could destroy the legal market overnight but they just replaced it with an illegal market if if if Colorado and Washington reacted by repealing their cannabis laws then instead of a tax and regulated market you'd have an untaxed and unregulated market and you could you could have the pleasure of sending some people to prison but you couldn't do anything about it so my guess is that's the advice that the new Attorney General get from his staff and that they will acquiesce as the Obama administration acquiesced in something they can't stop
