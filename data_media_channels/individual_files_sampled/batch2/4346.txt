yeah I just think it it's not like they had history to look at right well you know the fingers what they know let us hope that something good comes out of this but yesterday for anybody that has spent any time understanding how North Korea plays the United States and the West yesterday wasn't a surprise at all we've always been concerned here that there's been a belief inside the White House even before they got sworn in that history was going to start on January 20th 2017 they were contemptuous of history contemptuous of being told this is how history is unfolded in the past and said well you guys don't get it everybody's getting it wrong but the problem with not knowing history is what John almond here I think it's condemned to repeat it you working from that's Santayana I believe yeah exactly and as the New York Times Jerry Mullaney points out this wavering is not new for North Korea it's a return to form the United States reached a landmark agreement supposedly with North Korea in 1994 Nobel Peace Prizes were handed out for that but it collapsed in 2002 after North Korea admitted that they had actually used that agreement to build their clandestine nuclear program and enrich uranium and that's worth drawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty North Korea agreed then hey okay we'll take part in the six-party talks to the United States and regional powers and they promised in 2005 what sounded like they were promising over the past week or two it's been going so fast but they promised to abandon nuclear weapons and all existing nuclear programs but the following year it conducted a nuclear test its first nuclear test in 2008 Washington dropped North Korea from its a list of state-sponsored terrorist why I have no idea but they agreed to send the north economic aid in return for disclosing and disabling nuclear facilities guess what within a year football after once a provocative behavior North Korea said it would permanently pull out any nuclear of any nuclear disarmament talks and the communist regime the repressive communist regime we started its nuclear program after pressure from the Obama administration a deal was struck in February 2012 and the plan to provide food aid and halt operations at its young bin nuclear reactor to permit inspectors to verify that it suspended its nuclear missile programs within a month North Korea threatened to launch a satellite killing the agreement so we could this has just been going on and on as we've been saying since 1991 and if you would look at history you would be a little more what's the word careful about being braggadocious about the development and you'd be also be humble about the possibility right of actually getting a deal but John Heilemann Donald Trump charged into a room he wasn't even a meeting he wasn't even supposed to be at he said let's get this summit together got the summit together and let us hope I'll restate let us hope that North Korea follows through this time for the first time but again the way that they have approached as we've said from the beginning makes these sort of a dust-up happen yeah I mean there's a reason why when the transition was taking place and President Trump and President Obama or President Elect Ron the President Obama were still speaking to each other you know President Obama said this is the hardest problem you're gonna face it's the most dangerous problem not just the most dangerous most threatening problem but also the hardest one to solve and that was hard-won wisdom because President Obama had had had seen what had come before him and when then what happened to him and I think Donald Trump appreciated the first part that North Korea was the most dangerous and most threatening problem right and he clearly wants to try to solve it it's like he's he's I he does want to fix this problem and yet he didn't hear the other part which is that it's the hardest problem and if you understood the complexity of it and the history you would have known that just fits wagging words those are two what you've just used two words Willy and I I mean this Donald Trump has an aversion almost he's allergic he's allergic to to complexity and allergic to history he doesn't know history he doesn't want to know history people around him are contemptuous of history his closest aides his family members they believe that they can remake history they believed that they could go into the Middle East and just like that it would be easy to fix they told me it was going to be crazy look at this panel and you look at the pictures that are coming out of the Middle East that here we are a year and a half later this is what they were telling me during the transition was going to be so easy to fix because everybody that went before them were fools and idiots that they knew how to run a real estate company in New York they certainly could take care of a 4,000 year Christ and that's why you make decisions like quickly moving the embassy which leads to some of the pictures we're seeing right here meanwhile people who have dealt with this problem are talking about North Korea former CIA director John Brennan an NBC News senior national security Intel analysts responded to the news with this statement quote this turn of events is unsurprising since Donald Trump seems enamored with a fire aim ready policymaking process that's fraught with pitfalls as well as potential disasters not sure when if ever mr. Trump will realize that he's not the smartest man or even the best negotiator in the world indeed far from it Jeremy bash let me go to you on this they North Korea also mentioned Libya giving up its nuclear program and said it met a miserable fate it referenced directly John Bolton what did you read into the activity I'm you surprised at all about what North Korea did yesterday well the statement by Kim kye-gwan the first vice minister in North Korea was really stunning Willy took a direct shot a retort fired a rhetorical missile directly at John Bolton basically said his involvement in this process is undermining sort of an understanding that they thought they had which is that they were not going to have to give up their nuclear weapons and I think you know the all of the theatrics about the summit and the meeting and the and the Nobel Prize discussions aside substantively this statement pointed to a very significant possibly unbridgeable difference between the US and North Korean sides basically the North Koreans are saying we are not going to engage in unilateral nuclear disarmament and of course the US position is is that full denuclearization has to be the outcome of these discussions when the reaction I had Willy is that the president is sort of like that guy at the school auction who always has his hand up you know when ego is involved he's gonna overpay ya and and I've been critical from the start actually going all the way back to 2007 of Barack Obama's eagerness to strike a deal with Iran saying wad meet with the leaders no preconditions Hillary Clinton rightly criticized him for saying that Republican leaders rightly can criticize him for saying that I think conservatives the conservatives that are still out there are skeptical of Donald Trump being so desperate for a meeting with kim janghoon that he would lay no groundwork this is a sort of thing that we conservatives have always been skeptical of going back 40 50 years people are people who support Donald Trump are writing blogs this morning talking about Trump and what a genius he is for North Korea they weren't even born when we saw what Ronald Reagan did at Reykjavik which liberals hated the press hated Europe hated and yet we conservatives believe Reagan's tough negotiations against Mikhail Gorbachev there and in the coming years ended the Cold War that's how we conservatives think you negotiate like Reagan you negotiate like Nixon you take a tough tough line and you take a tough line for a very long time and then you get concessions here's Donald Trump bumbling in he wasn't even a good deal maker in New York City that's why he was nine billion dollars in debt right he bumbles in like we've always accused liberals of bumbling in in negotiations with Communists and tyrannical regimes and this sort of bumbling is exactly what conservatives have always been fearful of we're always skeptical especially of Communists communist regimes and yet Donald Trump bumbles in this this is not a surprise to us real conservatives this I think I know nikki Haley is going to have to say what she has to say at the United Nations but this is not surprising to nikki Haley she comes out of the tradition of Ronald Reagan as do i as do so many other people that are not surprised by this at all right and I think you know what what Trump thinks just to try to filter it through his mind to the extent that that's ever possible I think he would say well I was tough with North Korea and what he means by that is he sent some tweets that said fire and fury a little Rocket Man and that to him is taking a tough line that he paved the way for these negotiations by being tough tougher than anybody had ever been before tougher than Barack Obama with Kim jong-un and I think that tells you a lot about what he how he measures toughness toughness for him is sending a provocative tweet is some histrionic rhetoric where I think conservatives like yourself people who are from the Ronald Reagan School and even the George Herbert Walker Bush school with respect to international negotiations recognize that rhetorical flourishes of that kind can be effective sometimes but that's not the measure of toughness in a negotiation you can't just yelling at someone he's a day trader right what Ronald Reagan did over decades towards Soviet Russia what Richard Nixon did for decades against the entire communist movement Donald Trump compressed literally into a couple of once and thought he could send out a few nasty tweets and that would somehow send the same message that Ronald Reagan streaked against communism and Richard Nixon's strength against communism starting with Alger Hiss and going all the way through his meeting in 71 with Mao Donald Trump thought he could somehow supplant that with a few angry tweets and so never forget in the White House him patting Jared on the back and saying look at Jared he's gonna solve peace in the Middle East he's gonna bring peace to the Middle East and just slapped him on the back and she's like that would do it I'm sorry you can't I it's hard it's well I was just thinking to myself my god are you freaking kidding me and I was it was one of those moments where I was like what planet am I on I'm in the White House and he's playing at his son-in-law who's 35 mm-hmm has never done it thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and
