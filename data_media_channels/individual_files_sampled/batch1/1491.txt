I am for me okay and you're in the stream today a growing number of Muslim Americans have hit the campaign trail ahead of midterm elections this November and some are saying that could be history in the making well speak with a few of those candidates to hear about the ups and downs of running for public office and their efforts to change the political status quo we are live on YouTube so do you try to leave your comments and questions in the chat but first hit samaya Toba a journalist and former streamer who suggested Today Show I pitched this show because as a young Muslim growing up I feel like I didn't have a lot of role models in the political sphere and today that's totally changing there are so many young Muslims especially young Muslim women getting involved and I think that's really encouraging to see because I'm hoping it will encourage Muslim communities to go out and vote and I'm hoping it will encourage young Muslims to throw their hats in the ring and run for public office Americans will head to the polls this November to vote in midterm elections and for some Muslims in the US that presents an opportunity to transform activism in the street into policy The Associated Press news agency reports that a wave of Muslim Americans across the country are making bids for public office inspired by the desire to not only challenge negative perceptions about their community but shake up the political landscape of course running for office isn't easy but some like michigan congressional candidate rashida sleep are on track to make history although she's running unopposed in her home state pelleve could become the first muslim woman elected to congress we're happy to welcome rashida to leave to the stream but she's not the only Muslim American candidate looking to shake up the system in November Tahira a month Luba dude is an attorney hoping to represent to the first congressional district of Massachusetts in Arizona Deidre Abood is campaigning for a seat in the United States Senate and with us on set Hoda hawa is the director of policy and advocacy for the Washington dc-based Muslim Public Affairs Council or impact welcome everyone to the stream thank you thank you I want you to look at these three ladies these political candidates look at them what does this tell you about America when you see then all lined up together looking at these women I am hopeful there is not a lot I think for us to be celebrating these days but looking at these women looking at their dedication their commitment to wanting to see a change in America in our political landscape and then really taking on that leadership role to be those leaders makes me very very hopeful let me share a headline with you and this is on Boston Globe and it says with hope and a he Japp the hero amateur were done aims to catch anti-incumbent wave in western Massachusetts that is such a cheesy headline hope and a hijab anymore ladies that you have had to deal with suffer under alliteration which you could please stop already with the Muslim American label Rashida you go first well I think that you know my district is a little bit different and the media coverage is in a little bit different just because I've been a activist in Detroit for so long it has been more about me being kind of a loud you know bullhorn caring woman that so happens to be Muslim or in some cases people say Muslim but I think that it has been an incredible journey I really haven't you know gotten this kind of so-called like attention in the media in regards to be a Muslim but more about being a little bit more aggressive or maybe sometimes people called it combative which was unfair approach to public service and I've been an activist I've been marching against injustice all over the city and where I grew up and I think that was more of a big pushback as being a woman and I think it's harder I mean you know for my Muslim eyes that wear the hijab like my sister it's always the first thing that people talk about even though my sister is you know she's a poet she's you know challenging issues around domestic violence and all these other things as her career people first see that and I think that's always been something she struggles with like I'm so much more than that but yeah I it is frustrating because we actually care so deeply about public service and about elevating the voices of our families that so many of them happen to be non-muslim but people want to focus on that and it's okay in some sense because I'm so proud of it plus it's kind of getting your face Trump statement is the muslimah and and kind of challenging the rhetoric that's been coming out of administration but I'm incredibly proud to be among these women who have so much courage because it takes so much courage to run so online Tahira there are people that say saying that you have an added burden to just being a Muslim woman wears hijab running for office if it could get more burdensome than that this is donna austin a corporate stream gasps and she says Tahereh for Congress as a black Muslim woman faces potential challenges not only because of her race and because of her gender but also prevalent public Islamophobia that informs much of the current public political discourse she goes on to say but you were more than your demographic identity you're also a capable attorney community advocate with years of experience and solid policy post positions that we've often have difficulty analyzing black women candidate in his way because of our difficulties with race and gender so she adds on being african-american on top of all of that what's your take on that Malika I agree that it is it's sort of a trifecta and I talk about that a lot going back to the Boston Globe article with the headline with hope and he jab when we posted it on social media and engage with some of our constituents particularly women who are not Muslim we started saying that the hijab does have superpowers and we totally embraced the idea that the hijab has superpowers it's interesting because I'm running in a district that of course is predominantly white depending on what what statistic you read it's between 75 to 81 percent white and so the question about my identity comes up quite a bit but I think is that most people when they get over whatever the shock might be of seeing me they recognize that we have a universal message we have lots of commonality and that overcomes that that initial sort of shock of who is this person why is she running what does she believe and can she represent me when looks and dresses and presents that way Deirdre I'm just wondering about how you are dealing with your identity your faith identity your identity as a politician and the attention that he's being focused on you because of your identity well funny enough locally in the media it was always the Muslim candidate no matter what I mean they would say you know I a male entrepreneur is running and then they would say and the Muslim candidate we've actually had an evolution in Arizona where the local media doesn't do that anymore they actually call me an attorney which is you know what they call everybody else and nationally that has not been the case nationally every story seems to be about the Muslims running or the Muslim women running or you know somehow if I'm not Muslim I wouldn't even you know get their attention but out on the campaign trail what we've also seen an evolution because I'm the only person in this race really I'm from both parties that is running on my values and being truthful and transparent accessible and accountable on the values and we've never had that in Arizona so especially from a Democrat so it really is changing the conversation in Arizona away from whether or not I'm Muslim or whether or not I'm dressing although we made a dressing part of it you know we have a host shoe thing we have I wear color most people would like to dress like me so we embraced that but because we were willing to stand up for our values and and really get out and talk to the people and engage them and answer their questions whatever they were be respectful even stand up to white supremacist and deescalate them then we really earned the respect so that we earned the votes you know of course this is a conversation that we're centered on in the United States but our audience is global and so this is resonating with people outside as well we got a video comment from someone named Ozma Malik and she's a candidate for Toronto's City Council and she's also billed as the first hijab wearing woman elected to office in Canada was for the Toronto District School Board and these are the things she says that she faced have a listen I was the first to job wearing Muslim women to be elected to public office in Canada ever and it wasn't easy I was the target of a vicious hate campaign even in one of the most diverse places in the world I was attacked for who I am and the work I'd done on human rights where people came together pushed back against the hate and fought for a shared belief in a city that works for everyone and now I'm running to be city councilor at Toronto City Hall I believe we need new voices at City Hall so that she explains what happened to her based on the research and and what you know about candidates running here in the States is this more common than not you know I think it probably is common and I would love to hear the ladies who are actually running and their perspective you know there is a really interesting intersection I believe between gender race and sometimes F Nick origin in the spotlight that's put on these candidates can sometimes be you know it's it's intense and it's extreme and I don't feel that other candidates are also put in that same situation but I do believe going back to Tahoe a statement about the job being a superpower you know there's something about American Muslims there's something especially about American Muslim women who are you know becoming the leaders who are the leaders for today and for the future who are saying you know what all of that noise aside I'm still going to take this on and I'm still going to be dedicated because I am fighting for justice for my community for my district for my country sure candidates how they wanted to ask you that question how would you respond Rashida I know you yes you start in Taylor then you can go second yeah so I love that we talked about the hejab having superpowers I think that's so amazing to kind of embrace and and and twist it to something that's right I I personally think could be a possibility because I always say that you know Trump being in office just everything that's happening is kind of living this bat-signal for women but women of color not just Muslim eyes but I see more Latinos running I seen more women from different kinds of backgrounds just coming up and stepping up and running for office but I can tell you from somebody there's just one my Democratic nomination and and just seeing the kind of intense attention I've been getting it has been it's been hard I you know my team is actually keeping me away as much as they can from social media of some of the the painful kind of attacks on me I think a lot of people should know I'm also Palestinian you know my mind do you mind do you mind sharing some of those because I think this is the reality check that what it means when you run and you come from a particular community and you're representing people who may not know about your background one example well one example is you know automatically thinking because I'm Palestinian there's somehow you know anti-semitic which is so unbelievable because I'm sorry so those are the kinds of things of like I'm not gonna support you you're gonna promote Sharia law but also using derogatory terms like the B word towards me or you know people when watching certain kind of comments a lead to almost just just pure anger and frustration that I could be a possibility in our country which I think you know overwhelmingly there has been more hope inspiration and light that has come from my election and the other noise that you see people want to concentrate on that people want to focus on that it's really hard to understand that we are actually much much more overwhelmingly you know population just more positivity that's coming but yeah it has been hard for me to get that much shawl at once within just literally I don't know if you know how to like within few minutes of winning to get that kind of pushback again not from my own district not from the people that elected me not here from the backyard of you know in my in Detroit and Metro Detroit area it's been people from around the country and even around the world that have attacked me already late and putting labels on me assuming various things that you you know the stereotypical things that you think of somehow I'm an American somehow that I'm so somehow gonna be pushing my feet I'm sure Rashida I promise to hear that she would get in but I'm gonna go to hearer via your campaign announcement because it gives me tingles just playing it to hear up for Congress let's press play I've decided that we need representation that reflects that someone is hearing someone is experiencing someone is listening someone is engaging someone is qualified interested willing relentless persistent brave fearless and beholden to no one but her community to hear you're up against somebody who is very well-established they have a lot of money what made you decide I have to run I decided that we needed to run I needed to run because our district was really lacking in zealous representation especially on the heels of the Trump of the Trump election and when I made that decision it was well respected people embraced it and we have been on fire ever since I launched in December our primary is September 4th and we have just gained so much traction and enthusiasm that um I just believe that we're unstoppable and with the help of the this community in this district we're going to win I I completely believe that this is this is our reality mm-hmm I like that enthusiasm and that passion there we're seeing it online from others as well we got a tweet from Phaedra's side and she was one of the five Democratic candidates for the primaries for Congress also in Michigan phaidor's wrote this I learned in this process that the community is paying attention they want to be engaged they're ready to vote but they also want to see their voices reflected and feel heard it's not just our job to engage but politicians need to stop writing them off or taking them for granted and Deidre she continues by saying because we need to change the narrative and not allow our community and our issues be defined by others as it's been for far too long and if we're not at the table we are on the menu so keeping that in mind Deidre what is it that you are bringing to the table why did you run for office in the first place I announced in April 2017 when I was announcing against a established Republican and no one had a clue that he was gonna choose not to run opening up the seat later in the year and then my opponent in the Democratic primary decided when he announced that he wasn't gonna run that she would run easy pickins but I had already established six months of raising the expectations for this office of denouncing that our US senators were not having town halls weren't answering questions weren't accessible gave zero information to the people and hadn't even visited the 15 counties of Arizona much less the tribes so I stayed in the race because my opponent continued to do exactly what senator flake was doing so basically we were getting the exact same thing we weren't gonna raise the expectations even though we were going to have a Democrat in office and that's what this has to be about if it was about getting around and having these conversations about the real things that matter you know criminal justice health care net neutrality separation of religion and state these were all important issues and people needed to talk about it but we also only need to talk about are we as Democrats and are we reflecting those values or are we willing to trade them for us oppose it when did your own social you take your constituents through what it is like to campaign this is Deirdre 2018 and this was last week and you're knocking on doors what is the reality of campaigning for you well first of all we made social media a big platform and we made it very transparent everywhere I go everywhere I do we're pretty much online in some way we even Facebook live all of my speeches we also have the campaign chronicles which are snippets of little conversations but generally you know people meet you where you are so if you meet them with a smile and and inclusion then they'll respond to that and we've had a few like in fact that day when I was door knocking we had a man who his wife was Democrat he was Republican he was not happy that we were at the door and he said you know Democrats were running the country and he was very upset he was closing the door and I said but we love you still and he opened up the door and said oh I wasn't talking about you personally Nelson and I didn't think that you were I was just reminding you that in the end were all a community it's that community and that aspect here that people are picking up on this is Venus on Twitter who says there are more Muslims running for office than any other time after 9/11 and that seems relevant and she's referencing stats from The Associated Press but keeping that in mind we got a video comment from Mohammed Aguila who talks about what that stat has meant for average everyday Americans on the ground who are now invigorated to go campaign for you all and for other candidates this is what he told us about what it was like to be out on the streets getting the vote out you saw leaders you saw a man's stepping down from the mimbar and knocking on doors he saw them making calls he saw them working on the polls I mean you meet us on nuke lobbies in the street knocking on doors you saw them working at the polls as well and then we would literally pull people out of the message and make sure that they went to vote I mean we had literature created in in Bengali as well as or two as well as it Arabic I mean everyone literally just came together for a common cause and with that we had precincts that actually ran out of ballots we have redefined what it means to be Muslim in America so he talks about women in full-faced veils prayer leaders being pulled out of Hamas to go get out of the boat how important are those efforts and is that different is that striking to you it's incredibly important in fact a few a recent Pew study just released announced that nearly two-thirds of American Muslims are dissatisfied with the direction of the country today and I think that it's so incredibly important and I think it makes a very powerful statement that while we may be dissatisfied with the direction we're doing something about it we're not just sitting back we're not letting things happen we're not you know sitting we're not we're not on the menu we're sitting around the table and we're part of those policy making discussions and I think it's important to ensure that the faith community is involved in the civic and the political process I think for too long our community has been overlooked and now we're starting to see this push and again yes well we have may while we may have a lot of men who are running for office to I think that the the banner is being led by American Muslim women and I think that that is a powerful perception it's it's a myth-busting exercise so that people are not continuing to have that stereotype in their mind that American Muslim women or Muslim women in general are are treated differently in the faith and certainly not as Americans and I'll just jump in as an aside because you mentioned men running for office as well that we there are also two male Muslim members of Congress already Andre Carson and keith Ellison to hear it for Congress I want to ask you this all right I've on your on your Twitter feed not seniors and I just spoke about the campaign our vision a connective ability to shape our future it's a beautiful day and then this picture is so striking we have this seniors we have you there there's a lot of diversity in this picture or maybe there isn't a lot of diversity pens how you see it what was that like it's that picture I met with some seniors in a part of the district the district is very large and that sort of that scene is not an uncommon scene but when we get over the sort of shock value of what I look like what I present like the reality is that we connect on a commonality that is that is almost tangible people love our message they love the energy that we bring and the identity that I have as a Muslim woman only helps me to connect with folks just in a more universal way so the fact that in this district we've been able to get the momentum that we've gotten comes because we lead and we serve with a place of from a place of love and people respond to that and it's been electrifying I'm just wondering about the political alignments how you know headed when sister Tahira says a place of love it's so true what happen in a room with even you know predominantly white communities just seeing that picture it reminds me of some of the parts of my district yeah it really is you know like people like us don't you know you don't hear Penn members of Congress talking about coming from a place of love you don't hear members of Congress even talking about that and talking about being really truly real and trying to connect people connect with people on a human level when I see Deidre on the door I'm thinking how powerful that direct human contact is irreplaceable you know when they have eye contact with you when you're talking to them I mean Deidre Terra probably know this you're there just looking at you and they're like wow there's my door but even more than that they're connecting with us at a level that is so extraordinary that I feel like that when I hear pastor of african-american pastors say this in my district he says we're not divided Rita we're just disconnected was she a whole type of love I guess evening by getting out there is that we're connecting all right so Rashida into here and did I hear you all connecting there's a little clip I want to play and this comes from Deirdre promotional video have a listen we have to come to back together as a society I think people are very tired I think that they want to attack issues and stop attacking each other and I think that that I am ready the message that we're picking up from our guest today Malika is very different from some of the news that we hear around the United States in terms of that partisanship that's out there what are you seeing online I'm seeing a lot of love and support for people better in your districts and maybe not this is Matthew who says go Deirdre give them a run for their money inspire young Arizonans Mohammed says what an honor to have Rashida representing her district in Congress were very proud and me an says miss Tyra a Melua dude is a wonderful human being with a proven track record thank you so much guests Rashida to hear a theatre holder as well we really appreciate your time here on AJ stream we will always be online see you there take everybody
