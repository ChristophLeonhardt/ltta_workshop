1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,603
JOE: THE QUESTION IS "WHAT'D YOU

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:04,003
MISS?"

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:08,341
SCARLET: THE FED FACES TO

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,910
SEPARATE PATHS.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,178
WE HAVE THE CHART THAT EXPLAINS

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:12,712
THEIR APPROACH.

7
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:19,819
JOE: HOW MUCH LONGER CAN THE

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:23,789
HOUSING RUN CONTINUE?

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,358
MATT: IS CLIMATE CHANGE

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,126
MAGNIFYING THE DANGERS FOR

11
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,561
HOUSING.

12
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,463
36 U.S. CITIES COULD BE

13
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,466
COMPLETELY LOST.

14
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:39,739
SCARLET: WE BEGIN WITH MARKET

15
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:40,540
MINUTES.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,542
AND X IS SETTING RECORD HIGHS,

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:53,786
CLOSING NEARLY.

18
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,688
JANET YELLEN MAY OR MAY NOT GIVE

19
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,457
AN INDICATION OF WHAT THE FED

20
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,224
SEES AS THE NEXT RATE MOVE.

21
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,828
JOE: VERY QUIET MARKET AHEAD OF

22
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,098
THAT MEETING.

23
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:05,999
UTILITIES AND STAPLES LAGGING ON

24
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:06,566
THE WAY UP TODAY.

25
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:12,171
MATT: TAKE A LOOK AT THE WINNERS

26
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:12,839
AND LOSERS FOR THE DAY.

27
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:17,811
BEST BUY, MASSIVE WINNER.

28
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:25,952
I BELIEVE IT IS UP $6.43.

29
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:33,893
SCARLET: UP 20%.

30
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:34,727
TOLL BROTHERS ALSO GAINING AFTER

31
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,129
BEATING ON EARNINGS.

32
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:40,066
MONSANTO GAINING ON REPORTS THAT

33
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,070
THE M&A ACTION COULD COME

34
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,138
THROUGH.

35
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:52,011
I ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU MYLAN,

36
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,415
WHICH SHOWS YOU THREE DROPS.

37
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,182
CONGRESS IS GETTING SERIOUS

38
00:01:56,182 --> 00:02:00,186
LOOKING INTO THIS PRICING ISSUE.

39
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,721
THEY HAVE DRASTICALLY BOOSTED

40
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:10,163
THE PRICE.

41
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:17,203
NOW IT IS 600 FOR A PAIR.

42
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:22,375
SCARLET: YOU NEED A PAIR

43
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:22,875
EVERYWHERE.

44
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:27,280
MATT: $1200 IS THE LEAST YOU CAN

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,448
SPEND IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE

46
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,215
NEW ALLERGIES.

47
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:37,390
JOE: I HAVE BEEN DEADLY ALLERGIC

48
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:47,333
TO PEANUTS MY WHOLE LIFE.

49
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,101
LOOKING AT GOVERNMENT BOND

50
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:48,868
MARKETS, HIGHER YIELDS ACROSS

51
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,538
THE CURVE IN THE U.S.

52
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,440
VERY MINOR HIGH YOUR YIELDS,

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,309
VERY QUIET ACTION AND U.S.

54
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,445
TREASURY MARKETS AHEAD OF JANET

55
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,583
YELLEN'S SPEECH ON FRIDAY.

56
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,686
ONE PLACE OR WANT YOU TO KEEP

57
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,720
YOUR EYE ON IS PORTUGAL.

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,292
LOOK AT THAT.

59
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:13,659
3%.

60
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:16,596
THAT IS PRETTY JUICY.

61
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,965
THERE ARE ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT

62
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,032
A POTENTIAL DOWNGRADE, SO KEEP

63
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:20,666
AN EYE ON THOSE YIELDS.

64
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,637
SCARLET: A BIG MOVER TODAY WAS

65
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:35,180
THE SOUTH AFRICA RAND.

66
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,982
THERE IS A LOCAL NEWS REPORT

67
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:40,653
THAT A POLICE UNIT ORDERED THE

68
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,422
FINANCE MINISTER TO REPORT TO

69
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,592
ITS OFFICES.

70
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:47,760
THIS REPORT RAISE CONCERNS OF A

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,730
RIFT BETWEEN THE FINANCE

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,799
MINISTER AND PRESIDENT JACOB

73
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,199
ZUMA.

74
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,970
MATT: WE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT

75
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,571
THIS FOR A WHILE.

76
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:05,044
SCARLET: GORDON HAVE COMMITTED

77
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:05,812
THE TREASURY TO SPENDING CAPS

78
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,446
OFF AND DEBT REDUCTION.

79
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:11,117
JOE: CHECK OUT OIL.

80
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:15,054
WE KEEP GETTING THESE HEADLINES.

81
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,290
MAYBE THE PRODUCERS WILL STEP IN

82
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:17,990
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT

83
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,726
OVERPRODUCTION.

84
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:22,562
PERHAPS SOMETHING WITH IRAN THIS

85
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,265
TIME.

86
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:25,998
WE ENDED UP JUST OVER 1%.

87
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:29,936
SCARLET: LET'S TAKE A DEEP DIVE

88
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,573
INTO THE BLOOMBERG.

89
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:37,210
I'M LOOKING AT TREASURIES.

90
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,445
WHO WANTS TO GET AHEAD OF JANET

91
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,215
YELLEN SPEECH?

92
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,184
VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT BEFORE THE

93
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:49,955
SPEECH.

94
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:50,756
THIS IS THE TIGHTEST MONTHLY

95
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:53,393
TRADING RANGE FOR THE 10 YEAR

96
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,229
SINCE 2006.

97
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,532
IN AUGUST, IT'S AT 16 BASIS

98
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,502
POINTS.

99
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,505
IN JULY, 31 BASIS POINTS.

100
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,408
IN JUNE, 41 BASIS POINTS.

101
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:15,982
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO JUNE FOR

102
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,417
A SMALLER TRADING RANGE IN 2006.

103
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:22,555
MATT: 32 CONSECUTIVE DAYS

104
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,189
WITHOUT A BIG SWING.

105
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:26,592
JOE: IT'S QUIET.

106
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,762
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE U.K.

107
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,563
IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE

108
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,098
THAT VOTE.

109
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,100
WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THE

110
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,771
ECONOMY FALL.

111
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,909
SOME DATA IS NOT THAT BAD.

112
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,510
THE BLUE LINE ON THIS CHART IS

113
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,613
THE ECONOMIC SURPRISE INDEX FOR

114
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:52,018
THE U.K.

115
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,852
THAT COULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE

116
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,488
DATA HOLDING STEADY, BUT DATA

117
00:05:55,488 --> 00:06:04,196
WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED.

118
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:04,964
WHY DO MANUFACTURER EXPORT

119
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,935
ORDERS PICK UP?

120
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,771
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE WEEK POUND

121
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:21,046
-- WEAK POUND.

122
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:26,185
MATT: IT WASN'T AN APOCALYPSE.

123
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:26,819
AT LEAST NOT YET.

124
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,956
JOE: THERE WILL BE ONE DAY.

125
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:34,126
MATT: I'M HAVING A LOOK AT

126
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:40,466
STOCKS.

127
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,068
WHAT IT SHOWS YOU IS THAT U.S.

128
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,705
STOCKS, THE WHITE LINE -- SORRY,

129
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:50,076
THE BLUE LINE TRACK VERY CLOSELY

130
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,843
GLOBAL TECH STOCKS, THE WHITE

131
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,045
LINE.

132
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:57,783
THE POINT IS THAT THE PINK LINE,

133
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:02,989
WHICH IS ALL GLOBAL STOCKS,

134
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,224
DOESN'T TRACK EITHER ONE.

135
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:09,061
U.S. STOCKS ARE TRACKING TECH

136
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,529
STOCKS BETTER THAN GLOBAL STOCKS

137
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,230
ARE TRACKING TECH STOCKS.

138
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,768
JOE: HERE WITH US TO DISCUSS THE

139
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,937
STOCK MARKET AND TODAY'S ACTION

140
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,338
IS OLIVER RENICK.

141
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:23,809
OLIVER: I THINK THE CHART IS

142
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,778
PRETTY INTERESTING.

143
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,579
AS THE FIRST TIME I AM SEEING

144
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,183
IT.

145
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,050
THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT

146
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,622
TECH COMPANIES RIGHT NOW.

147
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:41,427
MATT: THIS CHART COMES FROM

148
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,497
CHARLES SCHWAB POSTED IN THE

149
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,633
BLOG EARLIER.

150
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,536
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.

151
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:55,608
OLIVER: LOOKING AT TECH STOCKS,

152
00:07:55,608 --> 00:08:04,883
A LOT OF INTERESTING STUFF.

153
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:07,687
WHEN YOU LOOK AT VALUATIONS, THE

154
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:15,561
WAITING IN TECH STOCKS,

155
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,065
COMPRISING 21% OF THE BENCHMARK.

156
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:19,932
THAT NUMBER DOES NOT VACILLATE A

157
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,800
HUGE AMOUNT.

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,538
SINCE THE RUN UP, THEY ARE 21%

159
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,642
OF THE INDEX, SO THERE ARE

160
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:37,982
STARTING TO BE SOME QUESTIONS.

161
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:40,318
THEY ARE CALLING INTO QUESTION

162
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:40,986
SOME OF THE EARNINGS AND

163
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:41,453
VALUATIONS.

164
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:42,922
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EARNINGS

165
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,892
BACKDROP, IT IS VERY STRONG.

166
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:53,232
JOE: ONE OF THE THEMES OF THE

167
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,033
MARKET IS HOW LITTLE VOLATILITY

168
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,036
THERE IS.

169
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:02,942
ONE CHART WE HAVE HERE, S&P 500

170
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:03,676
AND IMPLIED CORRELATIONS AT

171
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:20,125
THEIR LOWEST LEVEL SINCE BREXIT.

172
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:26,232
>> THIS IS A BLOOMBERG FUNCTION

173
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:33,372
EVERYONE SHOULD USE.

174
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:38,710
YOU CAN TRACK THIS.

175
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,545
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO

176
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,915
MAKE MONEY IN STOCKS, THIS IS AS

177
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,784
IMPORTANT AS ANY INDICATOR THAT

178
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,219
THERE IS.

179
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:52,191
IT HAS NOT GONE BACK UP.

180
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,993
THE PROBLEM IS WHETHER INVESTORS

181
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,294
CAN GO IN AND PICK THE RIGHT

182
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,130
STOCKS.

183
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,601
SCARLET: IT'S A CORRELATION

184
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,402
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES,

185
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,236
NOT ASSET CLASSES?

186
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,238
OLIVER: CORRECT.

187
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:14,213
JOE: I CHARTED AGAINST THE VIX,

188
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,383
WHEN YOU SEE THE SURGES IN

189
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,083

00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,834
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT 10 YEARS OR

566
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,370
20 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE, SEA

567
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,171
LEVELS WILL PERHAPS ONLY RISE BY

568
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,275
A FOOT, MAYBE TWO FEET IN SOME

569
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:12,216
AREAS THAT ARE LOWER.

570
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,652
IT IS SUCH A SHORT TIME HORIZON

571
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:16,587
THERE THAT THE REAL IMPACT WILL

572
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:20,792
COME IN THE FUTURE.

573
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,559
GIVEN THAT IT IS SUCH A LONG

574
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,062
HORIZON, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE

575
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,130
ARE YET PREPARED FOR HOW MUCH

576
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,634
DAMAGE WATER WILL CAUSE TO

577
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,101
COMMUNITIES RIGHT BY THE OCEAN

578
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,503
AND HOW MUCH MONEY WILL BE LOST

579
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:36,507
IN ALL OF THIS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN

580
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,174
THAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE

581
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:38,976
CONSERVATIVE.

582
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
WERE LOOKING AT THE CURRENT

583
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,411
HOUSING STOCK IN THE CURRENT

584
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:44,014
DOLLAR VALUE.

585
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:44,849
IF YOU THINK ABOUT CONSTRUCTION

586
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,753
INTO THE FUTURE, WE WILL TILT

587
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,955
MORE HOMES AND MORE EXPENSIVE

588
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,090
HOMES, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE

589
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,922
COAST, AND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE

590
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:53,658
AFFECTED BY THIS.

591
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:57,928
>> 100 YEARS IS A LONG TIME

592
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:58,329
HORIZON.

593
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,933
IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THAT MOTHER

594
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:09,740
NATURE WILL GIVE US A FEW HINTS?

595
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,980
>> ABSOLUTELY.

596
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,015
THE FLOODING IN LOUISIANA RIGHT

597
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:27,325
NOW IS A REMINDER THAT GLOBAL

598
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:31,328
WARMING IS HAPPENING.

599
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:34,265
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS ONE OF

600
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,066
THE SIDE EFFECTS AS TEMPERATURES

601
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:40,571
ARE RISING.

602
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,372
IN THE FUTURE, WE CAN EXPECT

603
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:47,444
MORE OF THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.

604
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:49,246
THERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW

605
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:50,281
MUCH HAVOC RISING WATER LEVEL

606
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:54,352
CAN CAUSE IN A COMMUNITY, HOW

607
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,119
MANY HOMES AFFECTED, AND HOW

608
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:55,720
MANY LIVES AFFECTED.

609
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,557
>> WE SHOW THE TOP FIVE CITIES

610
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,492
WITH PROPERTIES MOST AT RISK.

611
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,361
LOUISIANA FLOODS EASILY.

612
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:09,467
FOR EXAMPLE, NEW YORK, BOSTON,

613
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,134
MIAMI, FORT LAUDERDALE,

614
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,302

615
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:15,739

616
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:17,575
THESE ARE POPULOUS AREAS WITH

617
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:22,213
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES.

618
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,114
YOU DON'T TYPICALLY SEE FLOODS

619
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:23,948
AFFECTING APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN

620
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:24,415
NEW YORK CITY.

621
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:28,386
>> LOUISIANA IS A TOP STATE THAT

622
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,222
WILL BE AFFECTED, BUT OTHER

623
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:31,989
STATES WILL BE EVEN MORE SO

624
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:32,390
AFFECTED.

625
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:41,465
NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA, HAWAII.

626
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,501
IN FLORIDA, ONE OUT OF EIGHT

627
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,468
CITIES WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH

628
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:50,508
FLOODING, AND 300 CITIES ACROSS

629
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,242
THE U.S. WILL LOSE MORE THAN

630
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,110
HALF OF THEIR HOUSING STOCK TO

631
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,615
RISING SEA LEVELS IN THE FUTURE.

632
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,617
THESE ARE VERY POPULOUS AREAS

633
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,718
THAT WILL BE AFFECTED, THEREFORE

634
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,588
WE WILL ALSO SEE A TRILLION

635
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:05,356
DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE HERE.

636
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,627
SCARLET: WHAT KIND OF

637
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:15,065

638
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:16,267
FLOOD INSURANCE AS BECOME

639
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,034
SOMETHING MUCH MORE CRITICAL

640
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:17,802
THAN IT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY.

641
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:22,139
>> RIGHT.

642
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:22,907
WE ARE STARTING TO PAY MORE

643
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,976
ATTENTION TO THIS.

644
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:35,852
IT IS A VERY CONTESTED TOPIC.

645
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:39,390
ARE WE OVER INSURING, UNDER

646
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,658
INSURING, IS THE COST CAPTURING

647
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,859
THE WHOLE COST OF THE SYSTEM

648
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,495
ITSELF, WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD BE

649
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,697
PAYING MORE AND FLOOD AREAS.

650
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:50,234

GROWTH AT THE LOWER END OF WHAT

753
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:42,713
WE CALL NEW HOMES.

754
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:47,417
>> THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST

755
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:48,151
HIGHLY VALUED HOMEBUILDERS.

756
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:52,522
SCARLET: WHAT IS AT RISK OF

757
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:53,390
CHANGING NEXT, DEMAND OR SUPPLY?

758
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,961
>> DEMAND IS THERE, SO IT HAS TO

759
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:58,462
BE SUPPLY.

760
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:01,565
FOR US TO GET TO 800,000, WE

761
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,399
WILL HAVE TO SEE SIGNIFICANTLY

762
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:02,833
MORE SUPPLY.

763
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:08,405
JOE: ONE OF THE BIG DISCUSSIONS

764
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:09,206
IN HOUSING IS THAT THERE IS SO

765
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,241
MUCH INTEREST IN TOP-TIER

766
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:16,479

ARE THERE ARE SIGNS THAT IT IS

771
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:29,660
SPREADING, GROWTH OUTSIDE THOSE

772
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,127
MARKETS?

773
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:36,300
>> THE COASTAL AREAS HAVE

774
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,234
STARTED TO RECOVER THE WORST

775
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,602
WHEN WE HAVE DOWNTURNS, THEN IT

776
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:39,169

INTERESTING?

779
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,709

CALIFORNIA, PHOENIX, NEVADA --

783
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,827
THEY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO

784
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:04,628
BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE A LOT OF

785
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:05,262
FORECLOSURES THERE.

786
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,966
>> WE HAVE A REGIONAL RAKE DOWN

787
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:12,069
THE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL.

788
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,869
THERE HAS BEEN REAL GROWTH IN

789
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:16,306
THE SOUTH AND WEST.

790
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,774
THE MIDWEST IS NOT DOING AS WELL

791
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,243
AS THOSE TWO REGIONS.

792
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,077
THE NORTHEAST IS BELOW THE ZERO

793
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:20,510
LEVEL.

794
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:24,114

PICK UP IN THE NORTHEAST.

799
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,362
THE SOUTH HAS THE MAJORITY OF

800
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,164
THE LAND, AND SOME IN THE WEST.

801
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,533

806
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,542
>> THE FURTHER WEST YOU GET, THE

807
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:53,177
LESS AFFORDABLE.

810
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,554
THESE ARE EXPENSIVE PLACES TO

LIVE.

812
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:08,258

813
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:09,560
SOME OF THE INLAND AREAS ARE NOT

814
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,328
THAT RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE.

815
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:15,432
COMPARED TO THE SOUTH, THEY ARE.

816
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:22,939

00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:26,576
WHAT DO PEOPLE GET WRONG THE

820
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:27,444
MOST WHEN THEY LOOK AT THIS

821
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:28,445
HOUSING CYCLE?

822
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:32,850
>> I THINK THE FIRST THING THEY

823
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,683
GOT WRONG WAS THAT THOUGHT IT

824
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:37,688
WOULD RECOVER QUICKLY.

825
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,957
I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE HAD

826
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:41,658
EXPECTED WITH A SLOW STEADY

827
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,794
RECOVERY.

828
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,462
I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE PEOPLE

846
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,849
THERE ARE GOOD EXPLANATIONS OF

847
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,118
WHY CERTAIN SEGMENTS HAVE

848

SOME OF THE ADVOCATES SAY THAT

911
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:57,500
IT PROVES THE OPPOSITE, THAT IT

912
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,268
PROVES HOW WIDELY AND GLOBALLY

913
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:04,507

914
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,308

TRANSPARENCY?

919
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,889

WAS DOING AS SECRETARY OF STATE

921
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:25,729

923
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,966
PROVE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE

THIS.

937
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:15,145
>> SURE, BUT CERTAINLY THEY DO.
