the ten cities that the Trump administration has essentially constructed in order to detain migrant children and separate them from their parents is costing us quite a bit of money in fact according to reports the cost of holding migrant children in newly created tent cities is about seven hundred seventy five dollars per person per night and part of the reason why is because you are essentially constructing these tents or putting up these tents and then you have to have infrastructure to keep the kids alive including air conditioning you need medical workers and you need security now okay I'm gonna interrupt Anna to say I guarantee you there's right-wingers now going what do they need air conditioning for all is so fancy it's only a hundred degrees in the desert they don't need that what do they need medical workers for anyway later on you know we're gonna talk a little bit about what some of these Trump supporters think about the policy of separating the the miners from their family it's amazing the the type of cruelty that some people in America will justify now by contrast it costs about two hundred fifty six dollars per person per night to hold children in permanent HHS facilities like Casa Padre in Brownsville Texas and detention centers like the one run by u.s. customs and immigration enforcement in Dili Texas that's dilly dilly Texas oh okay that cost about two hundred and ninety eight dollars per resident per night per resident per night per prisoner per night that's really what it means yeah so look as usual it's a knucklehead move you just don't need the tent cities they look terrible from a point of optics I don't mean that they're not pleasant to look at I mean I don't know one is comfortable with the idea of us having tent cities of refugees inside the country and Casa Padre has the cage that's the one we shown you and all the media is showing you before but at least they're inside of a building that's got air conditioning in it or and they get the meals and said you don't have to reconstruct everything so there's a host of bad options here but the 10 cities is the worst option and it costs the most so it makes no sense at all ok now let me read your comments G lo wrote in on Twitter the tent cities are big old Arpaio dog-whistle it's not a mistake that's a great point I was actually a tiny bit naive in that story and thinking well it's more expensive and it's bad optics no the optics is the feature not the bug great point G low Thank You Gabi Marie Morita along similar lines says the tan city's costing the most might be the entire point wonder what contractors Isis utilize yeah yeah it's a money-making scheme I know a Nana made a similar point - I'm getting educated a lot today by you guys hey Peter Hamby ricin on youtube superjet it brings incredible disgust to hear how Corey Lewandowski has no empathy to kids with special needs let alone from countries they're from to him they're worthless if not born perfect and it's shades of a you know another country and another time yet again Mary Dudley finally says I'm a member and I watch every day just donate a hundred bucks to wolf dash pack.com things have to change we're in the upside down Mary thank you thank you thank you for doing that and for being a member look we are operating a lot of these operations out of here right and there is not much other media help and media it makes a huge difference so the fact that we built this up and can reach people I hope is really helpful to the progressive cause we're gonna cover all the June 30th campaigns by the way this weekend there's gonna be some drives to bring toys to the kids who are detained we're gonna stream those on our Facebook page facebook.com slash The Young Turks if you remember you make all that possible and get all our shows by the way the postgame very soon at the beginning of next month we're gonna move it back to only members okay so T y-t-dot-com slash joined to become a member get all of our shows and by the way for audio podcasts you got Nina Turner you got array you got Jimmy door you got all these things all the progressives are here home of the progressives so come join us at TYT calm sighs join two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos you
