1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,820
What’s astonished me
about Donald Trump

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,440
is how effectively he’s
managed to take his opponents'

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,800
strengths and turn
them against them.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,720
It’s a type of political
jujitsu that we saw back in 2004

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,330
when John Kerry was
being "Swift-boated."

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,680
John Kerry is no war hero.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,850
I know John Kerry is lying
about his first Purple Heart.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,500
-It was shocking at the time.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,780
And what we’re seeing now is, is
that on steroids.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,680
John McCain, he is a war hero.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,980
He’s a war hero

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,490
’cause he was captured.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,200
I like people that
weren’t captured, O.K.?

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
I hate to tell you.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,650
The world
has turned upside down

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,690
if Donald Trump
is accusing people

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,940
like this of not
having integrity.

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,590
Whether it’s Jim Comey –

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,650
He’s a showboat.

20
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,650
He’s a grandstander.

21
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,310
– or Rod Rosenstein

22
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,550
These people have the biggest
conflicts of interest I’ve ever seen.

23
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,730
Or Robert Mueller, who
have spent their lives working

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,160
to uphold the rule of law,

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,400
he doesn’t care.

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,190
It’s not to say that
James Comey is a saint

27
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,800
or that Rod Rosenstein has never
made a mistake in his life.

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,230
It’s to say that I don’t
think anyone can dispute

29
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,610
that these men are people
who have devoted their lives

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,290
and their careers
to upholding the law.

31
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,720
And they are being
attacked on those grounds

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,830
by the least law abiding
president we’ve ever had.

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,300
Should Donald
Trump be impeached?

34
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,690
I hope not. Because I think
impeaching and removing

35
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,480
Donald Trump from office
would let the American people

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,200
off the hook.

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,040
There’s just no way,
short of Donald Trump

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,579
eating live babies
in the Oval Office,

39
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,370
There is no way he’s
going to be impeached.

40
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,490
There aren’t the
votes in Congress.

41
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,670
The American people are going to
have to deal with this problem

42
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,750
by showing up at the polls,
by expressing their values,

43
00:01:45,750 --> 00:00:00,000
and by voting in people who
will uphold those values.
