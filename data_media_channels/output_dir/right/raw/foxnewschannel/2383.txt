1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,805
ACTIONS.

2
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:10,213
WE START WITH YOU TONIGHT, BUSY

3
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:11,009
EVENING.

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,911
SO MANY INTERESTING MOMENTS IN

5
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:14,813
THAT INTERVIEW THAT YOU JUST DID

6
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:15,318
WITH JAMES COMEY.

7
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:18,617
WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU?

8
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:19,998
>> Bret: FIRST, THAT HE

9
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:25,724
ACTUALLY SHOWED UP HERE AT THE

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,126
GETTING UPDATES, SO WE SHIFTED

11
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:27,529
THINGS AROUND.

12
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:33,031
WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME WAS ONE,

13
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,335
THAT HE SAID TO THIS DAY HE

14
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:37,236
DOESN'T DEFINITIVELY KNOW THAT

15
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:38,714
THE DOSSIER WAS FUNDED BY THE

16
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:41,840
DNC AND HILLARY CLINTON.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,296
I FIND THAT FASCINATING, I FIND

18
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:45,444
IT INTERESTING.

19
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,846
I THINK AS YOU ARE PRESENTING

20
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:48,953
THE DOSSIER AS A REASON TO

21
00:00:48,953 --> 00:00:53,755
SURVEY ALL CARTER PAGE TO A FISA

22
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:59,410
COURT, WHY DON'T YOU KNOW?

23
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,159
IT'S UNVERIFIED AND SALACIOUS,

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,016
BUT IT'S FUNDED BY YOUR

25
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:03,365
OPPONENT.

26
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,018
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

27
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:05,717
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT REALLY

28
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:08,221
STRUCK OUT.

29
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:08,846
>> Martha: I AGREE.

30
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:12,871
IT WAS LIKE A DEER IN HEADLIGHTS

31
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,426
LOOK.

32
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,029
I HAVE NO IDEA, WE SHOULD LOOK

33
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:16,428
INTO THAT.

34
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:18,430
THIS IS THE HEAD OF THE

35
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,282
INVESTIGATIVE BUREAU OF THE

36
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:19,983
UNITED STATES.

37
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:22,535
THE USE OF QUESTIONS THAT

38
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:23,861
ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO KNOW, SO

39
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:27,993
YOU HAVE THIS DOCUMENT.

40
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,788
WHERE DOES IT COME FROM, WHO

41
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:30,192
GENERATED IT?

42
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:33,496
HE BASICALLY SAID I WAS TOLD IT

43
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:34,697
WAS A LEGITIMATE SOURCE AND THAT

44
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,698
WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM.

45
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:40,803
THE FBI DECIDED NOT TO BRING HIM

46
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:43,806
ON, SO THEY MUST'VE KNOWN

47
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:45,804
SOMETHING WAS UP WITH HIS

48
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:47,511
CREDIBILITY.

49
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:49,908
>> HE GOT FIRED BY THE FBI FOR

50
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:55,414
LEAKING TO THE MEDIA.

51
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:56,894
THE OTHER THING THAT STUCK OUT

52
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:58,817
TO ME WAS ABOUT THE LEAKING OF

53
00:01:58,817 --> 00:01:59,646
THE MEMOS.

54
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,648
AGAIN, HE PUSHED BACK ON THE

55
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:02,399
WORD LEAKED.

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,324
I TRIED TO GET FBI PROTOCOL AND

57
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:06,778
THE DEPLOYMENT THAT HE'S DONE

58
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,328
ABOUT WHAT A LEAK IS.

59
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:15,234
ED WAS WORD PRODUCT.

60
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:16,835
HE SAID HE GAVE IT TO A GOOD

61
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,437
FRIEND, BUT IT TURNS OUT HE WAS

62
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,443
ALSO WORKING AT THE FBI.

63
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:21,640
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

64
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,043
WHAT WAS HIS JOB?

65
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:27,949
HE WAS A GUY THAT YOU GAVE STUFF

66
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:28,247
TOO?

67
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:31,403
HE ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE MEMOS

68
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:32,404
WHICH WERE NOW CONSIDERED

69
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:34,506
CLASSIFIED MEMOS WENT TO THREE

70
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:34,953
OTHER PEOPLE.

71
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,908
WE KNOW THAT THE FBI HAD TO

72
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:41,414
SCRUB THE COMPUTER OF ONE OF

73
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:43,362
THOSE PEOPLE AFTER THAT BECAUSE

74
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:44,062
OF INTELLIGENCE.

75
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:51,974
WHERE THIS GOES, I DON'T KNOW.

76
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,225
>> Martha: IT WILL BE

77
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,403
FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT THE IG

78
00:02:55,403 --> 00:02:56,781
FINDS BECAUSE THAT IS A MAJOR

79
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:03,435
FORM OF CONTENTION RIGHT NOW.

80
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:06,488
HE WAS MUCH ROUGHER ON HIM THAN

81
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:07,239
JUST THAT AND JAMES COMEY SAID

82
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:08,887
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

83
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,669
THOSE ARE MY PRIVATE MEMORIES.

84
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,597
IT WAS A DIARY THAT I WAS

85
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:15,348
PUTTING TOGETHER AND IT WAS MY

86
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:17,896
LIFE AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, BUT

87
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:22,955
THEY WERE GENERATED ON THE FBI'S

88
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:25,404
PAYROLL AND COMPUTERS.

89
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:31,013
I WONDER, WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS

90
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:32,764
ACTUALLY THE CASE IN THE MINDS

91
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,067
OF THE IG?

92
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,716
>> WE DON'T KNOW, BUT WHAT WE DO

93
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,618
KNOW IS IT'S GOING TO BE COMING

94
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,198
OUT SOON ACCORDING TO LAWMAKERS

95
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:43,275
ON THE HILL, THEY THINK IT'S

96
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,122
GOING TO BE EXPLOSIVE BECAUSE

97
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,832
THEY BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A

98
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:46,224
LONG TIME.

99
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,430
THE OTHER THINGS THAT STRUCK ME

100
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,637
ABOUT THE INTERVIEW IS WHAT HE

101
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:53,737
SAID AT THE END, THAT HE WAS

102
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:54,833
STILL THE FBI DIRECTOR TONIGHT.

103
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,740
LISTENING TO THIS MEDIA ROLLOUT

104
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,443
IN THIS BOOK, WHICH HAS DONE

105
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:05,344
VERY WELL, HE HAS NOT SHIED AWAY

106
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,446
FROM SAYING THE PRESIDENT IS

107
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:08,617
MORALLY UNFIT, THAT PEOPLE

108
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:09,454
SHOULD VOTE THEIR CONSCIOUS, BUT

109
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:16,654
NOT VOTE FOR THIS GUY.

110
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:18,457
YET, HE SAID AS OF TONIGHT, HAD

111
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,411
HE NOT BEEN FIRED, HE WOULD

112
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:25,017
STILL BE WORKING.

113
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:26,665
HE WAS STILL BE WORKING WITH

114
00:04:26,665 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS PERSON.
