that your Embassy of coming public I am something okay I'm also from Nigeria and you're also in the stream today the latest Marvel installment maybe the most political entertaining and provocative yet it storm box offices a week ago smashing records and filling theaters with eager viewers of all ages it has won praise from critics and celebrities and audiences alike and it has also sparked a huge reaction from black people or over the world this is black panther we I waited my entire life for this the world's gonna start over burn it all what happens now determines what happens to the rest of the world so this ain't your grandma's Disney film it has a mostly black cast a black designer a black director and it cost around about two hundred million dollars and on the African continent viewers celebrated this fictitious nation of Wakanda and its depiction as a wealthy and influential superpower while many are celebrating the movie it has also sparked wide-ranging debates some are talking about the tension they say it depicts between black Africans and black Americans others have been mode the power that the United States wields over Africa Anna's politics Yummy's a journalist in Nigeria and centers some of his thoughts one of the big talking points you'd say are the gender dynamics in the movie the woman were given really prominent roles the politics of what kinda itself you know that bears debate in a discussion questioning the the self-sufficiency policy whether or not there is international trade what the economic model of the fictional country is and also local politics you know inside inside of a country we saw some control how much of the high-tech advancement washes down to regular attendance didn't appear to be so much in the movie itself even though there's only so much you can you know fit into two hours but I think that for Africans the fact that this high scale movie draws a lot of inspiration from real African cultures from Ethiopia to South Africa to Kenya and even for myself as a Nigerian that was really good to see on screen so much to talk about today with me chicka adore is a journalist based in Dakar Senegal in Los Angeles Suren sensei is an activist writer cultural critic no certain Keys a is creator and illustrator of quasi the first South African superhero comic book series adjusting Holland right here in the studio author Black Panther who is the black panther greetings guests or candor forever and also there will be spoiler alert so if you haven't seen this film yet I don't know what you do put your fingers in your ear close your eyes run out the room save this for later Jesse yeah what has happened with this film it's an amazing worldwide phenomenon no one really expected this movie to be as big as it is right now but it's it's taken over the entire movie landscape and it's changing entertainment in America and around the world forever oh yeah Chicka in Senegal do you agree I definitely agree I mean all across the continent here there is a glorious applause and that applause it's roaring it's deafening it's beautiful and I just hope that we can say this moment from much much longer on here we've got Tunde right in dambo and she's at the young african she says here the atmosphere was energetic especially one of the major stars tonight Korea she's in barbarian two now both cinemas are still sort out for Black Panther tickets let's go to South Africa and know you so well you know how did South Africans receive this film I think the first roll call for the whole experience was the fact that South Africans went out to the theatre twisting their cultural regalia that was something you've never seen ever so let me just show you something here this is Danai gurira and the piece of new young go and they are here dressed to impress at one of the South African premieres so right when you hear this when you see different countries across the African continent people around the world celebrating this film your reaction is what I absolutely think it's amazing I think it's really incredible and super important to number one see the depiction of even though this is a fictional you know country of fictional African nation I do think it's really important to see the depiction of an African nation as you know a superpower as technologically advanced I do think it's really cool to see people kind of taking pride in their culture and dressing up in their their native garb and stuff to go see this movie I think that's really important and I think that it's amazing to see what that is doing for people on the continent as well as for continent Africans that live here in the US and as well for for people that are African descent that want to feel that connection back to Africa I do think that that's really important and I agree that it is it's really a cultural moment that is kind of changing the landscape of a movie going I don't know if I agree that it's an unexpected moment it did have a budget of 200 million dollars like Marvel and Disney a lot into this project they threw a lot behind the marketing campaign like this so I wouldn't say that I feel like this is unexpected but I do think it's super important for people to see I will also say though that as a black American I personally didn't feel like it was for me necessarily but I do think it's awesome to see what black people around the world are taking from this film the only reason why I would say was a little unexpected because we're seeing the place is still selling out we're still seeing people who can't get into it believe me they want your money if they had known they needed more theaters they would have had them ready so I think it's even surprising the people at Disney how well is doing not only in America but around the world Benjamin Caesar says on Twitter that panther is nothing short of hype I'm sorry to say they will still be struggling and disenfranchised black men women and children from the southside of Chicago to the back streets of santen Baltimore along after the hype has died down sugar this movies about saying Africa is in it's our time to shine and for people like me who were made fun of as a child for being African this is almost like a sweet vindication like we're finally being seen as cool so this is not about trying to change infrastructures across the world for black people it's just saying it's our time to shine and this actually I think is a moment that we've been waiting for for a long time for the past I would say three years we have been seeing black culture displayed from greatness this is part of the unapologetically black movement there's also the factor that our children who are watching this are also having their entire frame of reference we entire lives and who they actually are changed forever I think that's the biggest no control from that is the fact that forget us and our politicians grown-ups but what our kids get is cultural representation and understanding of the an appreciation of the soft in a way that's never been seen before especially not in this large magnitude Serengeti you guys so would you guys agree then that this is not for black Americans because you just went to say like you know that this is like a really huge a moment for you as an African and especially like as someone that was teased for being African and stuff like that so like that's not for us black Americans who try to explore their ancestral identity I think this is a moment that African Americans can be like hey it's not just about the movie I think that you have to go beyond say a great movie I want to see us move beyond and actually have African Americans exploring their African identity investing in the continent adopting African names looking into African history is actually beginning of what could be as far as but what about those of us that don't have any interest in that we're fine with our culture and our roots of the descent of American chattel slavery we feel like that's our roots we feel like this is our country we've made our own culture here wonderful for people that do want to go back and reconnect to their roots and find their African culture but for a lot of us that's not something we're interested in and we feel like we need to handle what's going on in our own backyard here in America in terms of the treatment of black Americans here before we necessarily go back to the continent you know it's like our boat is sinking here but people want us to like stop bailing out water or Barbeau here to look across the pond like we need to worry about our iceberg here here's a great thing that this movie is doing it's actually bringing about these conversations here as well as around the world just this past Saturday I let a discussion of over a thousand people who came to talk about Black Panther and that's discussion turned into a discussion of what we as African Americans can do here in America as well as how we can help other people around the world so it's not a discussion it's not the movie features African characters with an African American as the antagonist but the discussion that's going on right now is not just about Africa it's about african-americans as well and what we can and should do here at home and in other places as well let me show our viewers what a fictional cunt country of Wakanda is like and then lawyers I'll come right back to you this is what condor from black pants that have a look what do you know about what Canada takes those Shepherds cool outfits how much more you hiding feelings about panther but films equally about Wakanda what seats of childhoods French people we ask the answer to you know when he's sitting on that throne where commas wounds have been out since its inception it's the best-kept secret in the world because they have something that worked once we have this natural resource that kind of thrives off of they mine it the technology it's very sought-after by anybody who's ever come in contact with it Black Panther has to look out for an entire nation and also consider that nation's place and how they affect the rest of the world to see an African country with kings and queens and warriors it's so inspiring it's just an incredible world to occupy Louis oh this depiction of Wakanda an African country what did you make of that Michael B Jordan is sitting right there in a sweatshirt that says like Lost Tribe okay like Michael B Jordan like like chadwick boseman Ryan Coogler who are all so black Americans African Americans they've talked extensively about how they feel like you know african-americans black Americans on loss he's sitting there wearing a sweatshirt that says lost tribe you know they've talked so much about you know we were lost so we need to reconnect and we need to go back and I feel like the film was definitely filmed with this kind of biased perspective of course it's there are in their perspective but this biased perspective of black Americans and this is why I wanted to go to no yes this is a very specific African versus african-american tension in the film Laurie said what did you make of Wakanda as a representation of various African countries you know I think it was a valiant effort number one there's so many cultures that we both of the African continent and to be able to match them up and put them together in one setting in one movie and create this melting pot of a city I think was a triumph and their in their sense big shout out to the costume designers for the movie going back to the fact we all the the patient between the Diaspora community elders that african-american community in Africa as well I think the the movie itself is a screen bay with the Oakland Oakland scene where Kamala supposedly grew up and the conversation day that takes place also getting this you know it's amazing technological you know spacecraft sort of like landing in there and having this lovely weird and unexpected type of dialogue that you that the the locals over they are having now with with an African tribe it's quite amazing that the dial to develop that that that's sort of happening there I think the draw out of that has to be positive I think conversations with our brothers and sisters in the States has to be you know facilitated in the positive sense and not just sort of like push back on each other I think that's counterintuitive especially when you have a celebratory piece like this that doesn't necessarily take away from anyone but actually just you know attempts to bring these people together and tell you know great african story and we didn't in the american story let's not forget that you know black panther was created in the states 1919 1966 so it was a huge opportunity to some huge undertaking and i know i included is a thing i'm not saying just let me share this with you sotiria and says everything boils down to black versus black physical fights in this movie the black community deserves a lot better the black community also celebrating this film when many of them but also the black community deserves better do you see that well actually I did not see that because in the past in these superhero movies the black communities weren't even represented at all you barely saw anyone of color in the in previous superhero movies to the fact that the two major characters are both people of color to me isn't a bad thing and we have to keep in mind this first of all this is a movie this doesn't represent everything we see this is entertainment but it's good entertainment where we can see ourselves reflected not only as the hero but the antagonist which I have to say I've been part of several conversations where kid under the hashtag kill monger was right so I mean there so I mean kill ma I'm totally clean kill monger but the lovechild of cuba we can have this conversation about these two different perspectives in our own community and that's a positive thing that's not a negative thing that we can talk about these things let me just show you here this is a piece of chicken you wrote you're trying to grapple with why are Africans so enamored with Black Panther here you are going to see a screening in Senegal you are dressed up for an article that you were writing I'm impressed but I'm thinking about the way that women are portrayed in this film let me show a little bit of clip a little clip first of all this is the warrior women of what kinda have a look the door mulashi are women who ledged their lives to the throne and to the security of the kingdom my character Okoye is the general of the Armed Forces as a whole Okoye represents the old guard and tradition while my character and the key are two challenges traditionally you get to decide what kind of King you check how realistic is this portrayal oh of Africa I'm running actually is the past not the present there is this dialogue this conversation Africa that before christianity and islam came into africa women were actually more empowered that they held roles where they're actually leading their communities so i think that this is kind of an homage to Africa's past and also we know that this these the door in Malacca actually looks like the da homie Amazonians of present-day been in but I think again this is not really representational of what women are holding positions are in today we're still struggling women in Africa take positions of leadership but in its past we do have stories that they did help hold up spaces where they were able to actually have control and domain and in areas of society education so I think that's what this is about mm-hmm serene did that speak to you at all no did it again for me personally as a black American I still don't feel like this is representative of me or my culture we can only assume that kill Mara's girlfriend who he shoots in the head is the only black American woman that we be represented in this film and she doesn't even have a name she barely has any dialogue we never see kill mongers black American mother we never really even find out what happened to her yet again this is getting more into the idea of that this was you know purely African representation and that's fine but you don't then get to tell us black Americans that this is some piece of like amazing radical filmmaking for us when we when it's not when we're not represented when when it's not indicative of our culture even getting into the idea of like you know a monarchy and we're you know we're born into a monarchy and they represent being you know dedicated to the throne and this and that here in this country we don't even have that you know like we don't even we don't even stand for that we don't even stand for blindly following a monarchy and I think there was also some classes and lead us under photos in this movie about you know you have to be the African ability to matter and to have value someone else touched on briefly you know do we ever find out how this is affecting regular condoms how is this technology is this Capitol trickling then we not have money because at the end we need to childhood buying buildings in Oakland and stuff like that and none of that's really discussed and we're just off the post can I ask you for those African Americans who duties Africans do you think that this movie would make a difference at least in their mentality of accepting Africans as just regular human beings I think that everyone should be accepted as a regular human being I also think that a lot of Africans take being teased very personally because they don't understand that teasing and roasting and stuff like that is a part of our black American culture and a lot of the ways in which we bonded with each other is through teasing and roasting as a subset of hub slavery you know we're all poor we're all slaves we're gonna joke about it this is how we're going to bond I think for a lot of Africans that's not their culture and a lot of them come here and instead of trying to understand our culture and understand the way that we do things here instead they want us to change to adapt to them I think a lot of that is also a superiority complex which we can get into and I think in a lot of ways not to be rude but a lot of Africa's impair the bridge and get over it when it comes to being teased in the third grade carrying a chip on your shoulder for the rest of your life and hating black Americans but then telling us we need to get on board with the jump in quickly I think it's also very important to to to sort of like pick up on the tone of the movie remember this is a superhero movie and it's you know it's exposing our best qualities whether or not you're African or African American I think what Kim Cuong here is the fact that it's a sort of gray to repeat now hang on and it's not in any case and in any case I mean this is a property that's existed years before our sensibility has evolved to this today it's so it's so great that it's got like the you know Okoye way and then in the role that she changed in the story but otherwise I mean these characters were you know where stabbed this decades ago I think it's very hard to a to to attack a movie that is adapted from a property that this is a very long time for our own sensibilities and grown-ups remember that we might not be you know the target market may be how kids may be might draw something more important from this then we with our you know the only thing I want to add on is that you know it's hard to make these judgments from a movie that has been cut down to such a small time period now when you get into the novels when you get into the comic you actually get to explore a lot more of these conversations T'Challa actually in the future marries an african-american woman it's very storm it's just how the spends time in America actually we get to actually see some of these other questions that we're talking about reflected on the printed page it's hard to get all of that into a movie that's limited to such a short amount of time when we get to see the director's cut I bet you a lot of the stuff we're talking about now it's going to be included in there and what's cut out but if you want more information about that kind stuff you go to the printed page you can just bring this in guess cuz I've got two minutes left I just want to bring in some more thoughts from the community Nia checks says this film is one of the marked steps in recent times to unite both the African and African Diaspora audiences hope marked changes will begin from the fanfare around this movie so so many different perspectives everybody's bringing their own perspective their own background to this film I think the bottom line actually though will be money this is upper Yemi aje okay doesn't matter what we think is like how much money is this film going to make here's the executive vice president of Genesis cinemas and they've been promoting this film big-time have a list of what he had to say amazing people are coming in costumes indifference of regalia it's unbelievable companies are paying for their staff you know they repeat visits I'm so excited it's more than a movie it's become a movement you know we sort of we hope that it continues till end of the year what kind of forever let me leave you with one last thought thank you very much panel there's been a fascinating conversation which it could go on for a little bit longer sumaya says that this film gives both africans and children of the asper a chance to see their homeland in an alternative universe where we weren't drained of our resources and colonized for decades it is the ultimate fantasy fulfillment so many interesting conversations to be had around a Marvel film I think that is the biggest shocker for me thank you for Jessie Chicka Suren Laurie so we really appreciate your time your comments your enthusiasm we will bring this conversation online we will see you at hashtag eight a stream thanks for watching everybody it's easy
