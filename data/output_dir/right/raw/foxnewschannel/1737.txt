COME OVER HERE AND THEY

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,728
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AND THEY

4
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:11,829
ARE DRAGGING US DOWN,

5
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,330
BECAUSE WE ALL COME FROM

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,164
IMMIGRANTS, INCLUDING YOU

7
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:14,665

SKILLS.

10
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,168
WHAT EXACTLY ARE HER SKILLS.

SHE DOESN'T KNOW HER OWN

21
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:37,921
DOESN'T KNOW THIS COUNTRY'S

HERSELF TO RESEARCH MY

FAMILY HISTORY IN HOPES OF

GOTCHA MOMENT, A GOTCHA

ANGLE TO VALIDATE ILLEGAL

IMMIGRATION AND OPEN BORDERS

37
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,076
AND WHAT SHE FOUND WAS

38
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,244
REALLY SHOCKING, GUYS.

39
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:01,612
SHE FOUND THAT MY FAMILY,

40
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,914
WHO CAME HERE IN THE 1800S

41
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:06,216
FROM NORWAY AND GERMANY THAT

42
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,719
THEY SPOKE NORWEGIAN AND

43
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,052
GERMAN.

44
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:10,220
AND REALLY WHAT SHE DID IS

45
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,855
PROVE THAT MY FAMILY CAME

46
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:12,589
HERE LEGALLY.

47
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:14,324
BUT WHAT SHE WAS HOPING TO

48
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,860
DO WAS TRY TO CALL ME A

49
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,329
HYPOCRITE FOR BELIEVING IN

50
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,898
MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION.

51
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:22,533
AGAIN, SHE FAILED MISERABLY.

52
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:23,667
BUT THIS REALLY ISN'T WHAT

53
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,769
SHE CALLS RESISTANCE

54
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:26,236
GENEALOGY.

55
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:27,971
IT'S ANOTHER INDICATION OF

56
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:29,673
TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

57
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,808
I REALLY AM HAPPY THOUGH

58
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,409
THAT SHE HAS SUCH A

59
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,677
FASCINATION WITH MY FAMILY

60
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,578
HISTORY AND I'M HOPING THAT

61
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:36,079
SHE WILL TAKE ON ELIZABETH

62
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,382
WARREN'S NEXT.

63
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:39,283
BRIAN: THAT WOULD BE VERY

64
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:39,683
INTERESTING.

65
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,918
TOMI, A COUPLE OF THINGS.

66
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:42,820
THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE

67
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,621
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ILLEGAL

68
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,824
IMMIGRATION AND IMMIGRATION.

69
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:48,859
ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE SIGNS

70
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,127
THE GUEST BOOK AND SAYS I

71
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,228
WOULD LIKE TO STAY.

72
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:52,596
HERE'S MY CREDENTIALS.

73
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:55,666
THE OTHER SNEAKS IN.

74
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,867
THEY MIGHT PEOPLE A WAY IN

75
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,168
AND THERE IS A WRONG WAY IN.

76
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,470
AND FOR THEM TO GO THAT DEEP

77
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,306
IN YOUR BACKGROUND, YOU HAVE

78
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:03,674
GOTTEN UNDER THEIR SKIN TO A

79
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,209
LEVEL YINK WAS POSSIBLE.

80
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,343
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU THAT

81
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:10,547
BOTHERS THEM SO MUCH?

82
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,648
>> IT'S NOT JUST ME OR

83
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,283
ANYBODY WHO ADVOCATES FOR

84
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:14,485
MERIT BASED IMMIGRATION OR

85
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:15,686
HAS AN ISSUE WITH OPEN

86
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:16,053
BORDERS.

87
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,788
AGAIN, JUST LIKE YOU SAID,

88
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:19,656
THEY DON'T SEEM TO

89
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,658
UNDERSTAND THAT WE, ON THE

90
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,126
RIGHT, BELIEVE IN

91
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:23,594
IMMIGRATION.

92
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:24,695
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE A

93
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:26,129
NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND I

94
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,131
AM PROUD OF MY HERITAGE.

95
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,666
HOWEVER, I DO BELIEVE THAT

96
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,069
THE IMMIGRATION CRISIS OF

97
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,604
TODAY IS APPLES TO ORANGES

98
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:35,672
WHAT IT WAS IN THE 1800S

99
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,074
WHEN IMMIGRANTS CAME TO THIS

100
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,709
COUNTRY LEGALLY.

101
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,844
WERE DOCUMENTED, WORKED FOR

102
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:41,745
THEMSELVES, ASKED FOR

103
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,846
NOTHING AND BUILT A LIFE AND

104
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:43,313
A FAMILY.

105
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,915
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

106
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,849
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS

107
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,251
OF TODAY THAT WE MUST DEAL

108
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:47,718
WITH.

109
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:48,852
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO

110
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:51,088
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHATSOEVER.

111
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,756
BRIAN: DID YOU PROVIDE THEM

112
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,291
WITH D.N.A. 23 AND ME.

113
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,759
I CANNOT BELIEVE THE DETAIL

114
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,127
ON YOUR BACKGROUND THAT THEY

115
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,530
WERE ABLE TO GET.

116
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,898
>> WELL, I DON'T HAVE TO.

117
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,733
SHE DID ALL THE RESEARCH FOR

118
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,669
ME.

119
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:06,403
APPRECIATIVE.

120
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,104
AINSLEY: JOY SAYING WHAT ARE

121
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:07,971
YOUR SKILLS?

122
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:09,206
IT'S BEYOND RESEARCH.

123
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,207
IT IS PERSONAL.

124
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:14,711
IT IS MEAN.

125
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,813
>> OF COURSE THIS IS

126
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:18,248
CLASSICAL JOY BEHAR.

127
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,483
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK JOY

128
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,051
BEHAR WHAT HER SKILLS ARE

129
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:22,019
BECAUSE PERHAPS WE COULD

130
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:22,753
SWAP STORIES.

131
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,655
I KNOW I WATCH JOY AND SEEMS

132
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,023
LIKE A HIGHLY SKILLED LADY

133
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:27,925
BUT FOR HER TO ATTACK ME

134
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:28,759
THAT'S REAL INTERESTING.

135
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,327
THOSE IN GLASS HOUSES SHOULD

136
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:33,330
NOT THROW STONES.

137
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,064
STEVE: MEANWHILE, ONE OTHER

138
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,232
THING THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

139
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:36,967
HAS THIS HEADLINE, BREAKING

140
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:37,935
UP IMMIGRANT FAMILIES.

141
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,202
THIS ALSO HAS TO DO WITH

142
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:39,603
IMMIGRATION.

143
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:43,907
A LOOK AT THE LATEST BORDER

144
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:44,374
TACTIC.

145
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:45,175
CLEARLY, AS WE HAVE HEARD

146
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,143
FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

147
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,578
THE UNITED STATES, TOMI,

148
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:48,512
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS

149
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,546
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

150
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:50,614
ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION

151
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:53,750
LAWS WHERE THE LAST DURING

152
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,455
THE OBAMA YEARS NOT SO MUCH.

153
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,425
>> DURING THE OBAMA YEARS

154
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:02,392
CATTLE CALL TO COME INTO

155
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:03,927
THIS NATION ILLEGALLY.

156
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:04,628
FURTHERMORE, THIS IS THE

157
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:06,463
AGAIN THE LEFT'S ATTEMPT AT

158
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:07,364
EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL.

159
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,298
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO STATE I

160
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:09,066
DON'T KNOW IF THEY

161
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:09,833
UNDERSTAND THIS OR NOT BUT

162
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,901
IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR

163
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:11,768
FAMILIES TO BE BROKEN UP

164
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,437
WHEN YOU CROSS THE BORDER

165
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:14,504
ILLEGALLY, HERE'S AN IDEA,

166
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,872
DON'T CROSS THE BORDER

167
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:16,974
ILLEGALLY THEN YOUR FAMILY

168
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:18,942
WILL SURELY STAY TOGETHER.

169
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:19,676
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE LEFT

170
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,810
CAN'T THINK OF, THIS BUT

171
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,878
THEY WOULD RATHER TRY TO

172
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,480
TELL US THAT WE HATE

173
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,281
FAMILIES AND WANT TO BREAK

174
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,616
UP FAMILIES, WE ARE

175
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:26,883
HORRIBLE, WE ARE DESPICABLE.

176
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:28,151
NO WE WANT TO ENFORCE

177
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,386
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW

178
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:30,554
WHICH IS WHY TEXAS CYSTS IN

179
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,289
THE FIRST PLACE, BUT, AGAIN,

180
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:33,557
THE LEFT CANNOT SEEM TO

181
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,392
UNDERSTANDING THIS CONCEPT.

182
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:36,059
STEVE: WELL, AND THE UNITED

183
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,394
STATES IS TRYING TO ENFORCE

184
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:38,795
OUR BORDER REGULATIONS DOWN

185
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:39,329
SOUTH.

186
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:40,364
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

187
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,498
YEARS IT HASN'T BEEN SO

188
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:41,798
MUCH.

189
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,467
THEN THE NEWS OUT OF ISRAEL

190
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,968
YESTERDAY WAS THE FACT THAT

191
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,870
THE ISRAELIS WERE PROTECTING

192
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,606
THEIR BORDER AND THE

193
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:50,307
PALESTINIANS UNDERSTOOD THAT

194
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:51,808
THERE COULD BE TROUBLE BUT

195
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:52,876
NONETHELESS THEIR LEADERS

196
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,611
SAID GO AHEAD, YOU KNOW,

197
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:55,679
BREACH THE BORDER.

198
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,913
CLIMB OVER THE WALL BECAUSE

199
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,115
THE ISRAELI SOLDIERS HAVE

200
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,784
RUN AWAY.

201
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:04,021
>> WELL, AS WE SEE ISRAEL

202
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,222
CLEARLY DOESN'T PLAY AROUND.

203
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,590
EVERY NATION HAS THE RIGHT

204
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,691
TO ENFORCE THEIR BORDER.

205
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,026
EVERY NATION HAS A RIGHT TO

206
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:10,027
PROTECT ITS CITIZENS.

207
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,461
I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE.

208
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:12,929
YOU DON'T LOCK YOUR DOOR

209
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,097
BECAUSE YOU HATE THE PEOPLE

210
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:14,431
OUTSIDE.

211
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,132
YOU LOCK IT BECAUSE YOU

212
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:17,401
BELIEVE IN PROTECTING THE

213
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,569
PEOPLE INSIDE.

214
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:20,037
BORDER.

215
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,705
BUT THE LEFT WOULD RATHER US

216
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:23,273
HAVE OPEN BORDERS.

217
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:24,374
AGAIN, THAT'S A THREAT TO

218
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,643
OUR SAFETY AND SECURITY AND

219
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:28,045
WE THAT BELIEVE IN LEGAL

220
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,212
IMMIGRATION AND WE THAT

221
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:30,313
BELIEVE IN BORDER

222
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,281
ENFORCEMENT WILL NEVER STAND

223
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:34,651
FOR THAT EVER.

224
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:35,385
BRIAN: TOMI, ON BEHALF OF

225
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:37,421
THE PEOPLE OF NORWAY AND

226
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,423
GERMANY, WE THANK YOU FOR

227
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,057
YOUR PARENTS.

228
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:42,092
TOGETHER HAVE YOU BECOME A

229
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,060
FINE HUMAN BEING.

230
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,194
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

231
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:45,629
I APPRECIATE IT, GUYS.

232
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,531
STILL WAITING FOR ELIZABETH

233
00:05:47,531 --> 00:00:00,000
WARREN'S GENEALOGY, THOUGH.
