we have the newspaper industry right now which one would have thought would have had a good opportunity online they have the competency of news and and so forth and yet the entire industry is just getting shelled and has experimented on line but it's not saving them why is it that incumbent industries and companies have such a hard time doing what you and what a lot of other entrepreneurs have been able to do well luckily they do have a trouble trouble doing it because that creates opportunities for the rest of us but yeah I'm always amazed at that because on the outside it just seems so obvious that if you were Time Warner you should have done startups in the internet space and fun of them 10 years ago and they didn't so it's a series of things one is they are always worried about protecting their current business and so that often gets in the way that happens all the time secondly they have trouble hiring the right people they don't they can't create a whole new pay structure where you're going to pay people much less and give them more upside so if Time Warner approached me and said Kevin why don't you start a business with in Time Warner I would never even consider it there's not enough upside and so the really good people aren't going to go do that and so it's going to be hard to be successful there so they have trouble getting the talent they have trouble managing it they have trouble moving fast enough and taking chances and so the combination of all those things means that they they don't do it if they do what they do it really poorly I think one of those interesting things for me is that I looked once at the top 50 websites online and none of them were new startups that occurred in a big media company out of the top 50 and it's still true today because certainly in the news business there are CNN has very big web presence Bloomberg as it went so a lot of the traditional media providers but what I meant there is that date there are a couple examples that are owned by big media companies CNN ESPN are good examples that where they took their existing brand and put it online so at least they were able to do that no one was able to create anything new online that where they didn't have the existing brand name which is what we all have to do when we do a start-up and so they've abdicated that entire space and they'll continue to do it
