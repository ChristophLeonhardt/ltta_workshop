to most people the phrase Jesus loves you is such an encouraging truth and even if you're not religious even the suggestion that the creator of the cosmos unconditionally loves you is it the very least encouraging but if you own 75% of all search engine ads in the United States like Google does then this phrase is both banned and inappropriate why on earth would it be banned because it mentions the name Jesus I'm Ben Davies is pure Hollywood before dia publishing company was informed the advertisements for their website quote would not be allowed based on Google's policy of religious beliefs and personalized content it goes on to say the disapproval resulted from the fact that the items in the ad and on the CPH website referred to Jesus and/or the Bible unquote say it ain't so a Christian publishing company mentioning Jesus in the Bible crazy in an ever-changing competitive marketplace like publishing companies all of them must stay innovative and most importantly be profitable to stay afloat unless you just say your publishing company involves green energy then theoretically you'll get tons of taxpayer dollars from the US government to stay afloat I'm looking at you Tesla but if you're a Christian publishing house based in America I don't think you're gonna get that kind of help which makes this even more problematic when you're not allowed to advertise freely to properly market what your product is this puts you in an extreme disadvantage to other companies who are allowed to market and advertise their content freely what's more is it's not like Google is changing its name to ask Jesus when an ad pops up saying click here to learn more about Jesus Christ and yet somehow allowing a company to sell books to Christians about Jesus and then mentioning what their books are about violate some type of religious neutrality policy that Google has but then they can still advertise like other publishing companies they just have to mention things and only use phrases that we think are PC enough that's like telling the NFL yeah you can use advertisements here for the big game on Sunday but you can't mention the name football that violates our sports neutrality policy that would be super offensive to basketball and that soup-kitchen sleep-inducing sport we call soccer so just say sports click here don't worry your fans will figure it out and finally this is just problematic because this is how it always starts you know you can't pray there that's super offensive even see the name Jesus online that's inappropriate too you know that billboard you paid for to advertise your church yeah it kind of offends me so you're not allowed to do that either it is just such a slippery slippery slope censorship leads to the rollback of religious freedom which can lead to religious isolation and even worse so why don't we just trying to take a stand here and spread the words not let this get any worse I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood if you haven't done it already you can now download the rebel media app that way you have access to the entire rebel lineup and can take it with you wherever you go you
