earlier this month former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russian government officials and the question since then has been will Donald Trump who has been over the past year incredibly even perhaps suspiciously protective of Michael Flynn will Donald Trump pardon Michael Flynn now today the press asked Donald Trump about this and here is what he said about Michael about Michael Flynn would you consider a pardon for Michael Flynn I don't want to talk about pardon so Michael Flynn yet we'll see what happens let's see I can say this when you look at what's going on with the FBI and with the Justice Department people are very very angry I love people people seem to always agree with him well he references them it's odd you know when it came out today's Sebastian Gorka said that people very few members of his cabinet agreed on moving the embassy in Jerusalem so even if people don't agree even when he says people agree with polls came out today I think 63% of the country believe that his campaign had illegal contact with Russia during the campaign now you can say that they've been misinformed or whatever but it is simply not the case that everybody agrees with and the FBI is historically mismanaged it's what you say too when things are closing in on you too if you're a child you say you know but you know Jimmy did it - and so did Steven so did doc you know it's the same thing and it keeps close oh I just want to be absolutely clear I don't again I don't know for this petition against 2 million 10 million or 100 million it'll make a difference but but whatever we can do ok if he pardons anyone related to the Russia investigation he should be impeached that afternoon yes days like that is mass diminishes me there should be no question about it so we did this petition a while back and and and let's keep it going it's called to you it's that tea white tea network.com slash pardon okay if Donald Trump pardons anyone from his campaign or administration involved in the Russia investigation he should be impeached immediately the ad or fires Muller or fires rod rod rod Romans or isn't science Muller's then fired yeah and I might have a different one on that but look number one eat tell your most importantly tell your Congressman your Senators to sign this petition okay and tell them you sign the petition send it to them do whatever you got to do or do it in a way that you're comfortable with but the main thing here is going to be unfortunately Republicans in Congress be no actually that's not that's only a little true every Democrat should go for immediate impeachment immediate but I'm not positive they're going well a lot of Democrats right now are signing today Carol shea-porter of New Hampshire signed on to Steve Cohen's impeachment articles five articles of impeachment also did it with Al Green it's I mean there's they're Democrats are coming forward even though the leadership doesn't yet want them to and I think look I think we all need to be clear both as individuals and especially members of the media what the red line is on this it's both the parties is also firing Muller because if we care not just about this particular issue but if we care about ever having any accountability over what the president does then this has to be the red line if you surrender on this if you allow him to get away with this - shut - to do clear obstruction of justice then you will never have an untainted investigation of presidential corruption Allah get illegal acts any of that from then on because we will have made clear as a country that we are okay with that if it's our guy or if we like him or if we just we don't really care about the issue that he can shut down any investigation no matter how terrible the acts are yeah and so there's two layers to this first of all you can't let Trump get away with it because he's just saying I'm above the law I and and and if he's pardoning these guys in circumventing justice and obstructing justice what the hell is he covering up that means he definitely definitely did it we know but that's okay it proves it beyond any reasonable doubt and that and God knows what he promised Putin and God knows what Putin's got over him we can't have an American president reporting to a leader of a different country he spoke favorably about Putin in that press conference we're just Watson and if you're conservative and you let our leader be controlled by some other country's leader you're not a conservative you're just a you're just a pathetic pathetic beta male who says oh yeah Dear Leader says it and I have no mind of my own you're a weasel that's what you are you're a conservative is supposed to stand up for freedom America our Constitution rule of law and you'd be shredding that but most importantly putting Trump aside the second part is more important than what John just referred to if we let any president say I'm gonna end any investigation of me then we don't have a functioning democracy anyway if Bill Clinton fired Ken Starr that would have been ridiculous immediate impeachable offense when Richard Nixon fired Archibald Cox that was the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency because then Republicans said this is too much they didn't have social media and it's still worked out that way so there has to be but on the other hand that was before money flooded into politics and remember Nixon also passed the EPA and OSHA etcetera because progress is really really strong back then so now the real question is those Republicans again the Democrats if you don't have the courage for this and to be fair the Democratic leadership which I'm not often fair to okay it's one thing to hold your powder keep your powder dry now but if he does the part right well then that's what you kept the powder dry fool right right and you should marshal every single Democrat in the House and the Senate to demand impeachment within 24 hours okay to start the proceedings within 24 hours now on the Republican side they're gonna have to figure out what the hell they're gonna do with their 35% base because right now Trump has is around 35% it was 51 36 by the way the the generic congressional ballot the other day in the same poll that showed the president I think at 32 percent yeah that one was real clear politics an average of polls around 37 so a ballpark of about you know mid 30s right so those mid 30s they don't care they let's just call it as at least 25% let alone the 35% overall they if they found out Trump is is literally serving Putin he he reports to it we've got the PP tape he's got the goals he says okay here's all the American interests I sold out to Russia are you happy with me boss twenty five percent of Americans would still say apps yes Donald Trump yes because that they're authoritarian by nature they believe to bow down to a higher figure and so and and that is the Republican base so Republican politicians are gonna have to decide country or politics and if they hold and they say nope we're the majority we're gonna end the invent we're gonna let trump and the investigation we're gonna shred the rule of law and we don't care because we don't want to anger our base well then we have a massive constitutional crisis and then Russia will have succeeded beyond its wildest dreams because remember the original point wasn't yet necessarily to get Trump elected it was to cause chaos and boy would we have chaos if a president says I don't care about the law I will never apply the law and then one party says you need to apply the law and other party says nope we're now we just threw away the Constitution you just watch the video by the Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
