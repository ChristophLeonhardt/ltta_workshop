who was stopped from entering the Alberta Legislature by an armed sheriff with a gun who was banned from the United Nations global warming conference not once but twice and who was I hate to say it again punched at a rally at the steps of the Alberta legislature by an NDP activist I present to you Canada's most censored journalist our friend Sheila Gunn read the Alberta bureau chief for the rebel Sheila nice to see you again hey Ezra thanks for having me I never thought of myself that way but I suppose it's true when you lay out the case like that well tell me another journalist I mean occasionally journalists get into some sort of conflict with authority occasionally police have some search warrant for information a journalist might have about a crime or a terrorist and you could call that censorship maybe I guess it's more revealing sources I don't know if that's that's a the same as censorship I cannot think of another Canadian journalist in the past five years who has been banned from a legislature banned from the United Nations or physically attacked the worst I see are some journalists who when they're on the street someone walks by and shouts a profanity and the police and the rest of the media community swarmed to their aid oh there was a profanity shouted at the journalist but not once twice three but four times you've faced censorship I got a question for you Sheila has any free speech group any journalist group in Canada ever reached out to you never no one's never not even once and you know sometimes when we approach these journalistic organizations looking for help they just completely ignore us like some of them did when we reached out for help to try to get access to the UN climate change conference they just didn't really even bother to respond to us that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra lavance show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on youtube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always to interview today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
