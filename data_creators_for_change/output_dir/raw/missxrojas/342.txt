good monday if you're watching this

<font color="#E5E5E5">video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm expecting something about</font>

fraternities and sororities I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about 21st century greek life</font>

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more about the ancient</font>

7
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,190
mythological kind lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices I've</font>

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,809
made recently have reminded me quite a

9
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,969
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Sisyphus suppose was a king he</font>

10
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a king of Corinth and in a scene</font>

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,480
reminiscent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one episode of</font>

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">Friends Hades once came along showing</font>

13
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,650
him some handcuffs and it was very

14
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,779
slightly asked Hades to demonstrate how

15
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,699
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> used now Hades being all hey</font>

16
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,500
look at the cool new thing I have used

17
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,630
them on himself to show Sisyphus then

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,219
Hades who was of course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> god of the</font>

19
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,020
underworld and you know in control of a

20
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,730
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to do with death was kind</font>

21
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,829
of out of action for a while there was a

22
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,899
period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> when no one could die it</font>

23
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,610
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they avoided situations</font>

24
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,379
involving death it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> more that they</font>

25
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,899
literally physically could not die the

26
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,340
wall didn't become a magically safe

27
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,200
place it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just became a very immortal</font>

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,670
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then after that whole site</font>

29
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,899
that was completed he was of course

30
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,760
punished at some point because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they hear</font>

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,079
it aren't particularly happy about

32
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,180
looking up Hades Hades himself wasn't

33
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,949
too thrilled and so everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

34
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,660
goodbye to the first in ancient Greece

35
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,309
in mythological Greece especially

36
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,019
funeral rites were the most important

37
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,489
thing in the world ever it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

38
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">different in 21st century culture either</font>

39
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,150
the history of the way we treat our dead

40
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the importance of the way we allow</font>

41
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,780
others in the respect and the time to

42
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,010
bury their dead that's been something

43
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,350
hugely emphasized over the past 10 and

44
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,270
20 years we've now moved past a time

45
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,950
where a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two of the Unknown Soldier will</font>

46
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,780
suffice this is of course is most<font color="#E5E5E5"> keenly</font>

47
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,640
shown in the US where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire back the</font>

48
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,560
bodies of soldiers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that itself is</font>

49
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,720
thought to be such a strong strong image

50
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,640
that during the war in Iraq Jonas can

51
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,290
actually show photographs of the coffins

52
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,030
arriving any way back to ancient Greece

53
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sisyphus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> artists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wife not to bury him</font>

54
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,329
not to place a coin under his tongue

55
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,189
because when you crossed a river<font color="#E5E5E5"> Styx</font>

56
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,960
need a coin for the ferryman and thence

57
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,790
this first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to Persephone and said</font>

58
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,259
I you know I didn't have a proper

59
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,450
funeral like everything's just gonna be

60
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,159
messed up my whole fate is gonna be

61
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,140
screwed up could you please just bring

62
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,490
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to life for a little bit so I could</font>

63
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,950
go have a funeral sorted and then you

64
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,110
know I've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back I'll come right back</font>

65
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the land of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dead which of course</font>

66
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,070
you didn't do after Persephone granted

67
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,869
him that much out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of life then Sisyphus</font>

68
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,579
was cool to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ganon because he'd spent so</font>

69
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,170
much time tricking the gods they weren't

70
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,250
particularly happy about it and they

71
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,020
punished him again forcing him to spend

72
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,270
his lifetime pushing a gigantic boulder

73
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,830
up a hill ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the top and</font>

74
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,410
have it Rob

75
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,210
down again now to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been thinking</font>

76
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,280
about this a lot does sound a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

77
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,080
melodramatic what many parts of my life

78
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,850
feel like peaks and troughs I wouldn't

79
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that they feel quite as bad as</font>

80
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,990
pushing everything up a hill<font color="#E5E5E5"> only tap it</font>

81
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,460
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back down again and that's the kind</font>

82
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,020
of person who loves to write to do this

83
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,450
for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single thing like check email</font>

84
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,830
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> crave that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of</font>

85
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,600
accomplishment of finishing things that

86
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,700
moment of I've done one thing what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

87
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,200
next thing and you can either view that

88
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,850
as completely different or exactly the

89
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,290
same as Sisyphus for me there were

90
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">always more hills to climb but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am at</font>

91
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,340
least completing one task no desk I got

92
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,870
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> gumtree and i got it for about 10</font>

93

pounds cheaper than it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed on the</font>

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">website the advancement says that it</font>

95
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,610
came dismantled<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to this girl's</font>

96
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,560
flats pick it up it wasn't dismantled

97
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,210
I'd rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than being a normal person</font>

98
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,310
and asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a screwdriver or calling</font>

99
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,350
a cab or calling my friends for help I

100
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,930
thought well I'll carry it I'll carry it

101
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,360
three miles three miles walk through

102
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,700
london no big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I look back in there</font>

103
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,620
and think what stupid decision to make

104
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,630
and I completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack common sense in</font>

105
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,730
that situation I carried it back but I

106
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">got bruises and i got like small</font>

107
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,490
blisters on my hands and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would have</font>

108
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,960
been so much easier to ask for help

109
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,850
asking for help or something I've grown

110
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,380
a lot better<font color="#E5E5E5"> at but it's still something</font>

111
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,240
i find difficult and part of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

112
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,430
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want something to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be my task</font>

113
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,780
in my accomplishment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love</font>

114
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,310
accomplishing things with friends i love

115
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,900
accomplishing things with a team but

116
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,340
occasionally you want something that's

117
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,110
your own and for me at least things like

118
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,000
running things like walking things like

119
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,890
carrying desks three miles those

120
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,900
physical tasks are the ones that feel

121
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,880
strangely satisfying to achieve them by

122
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself of course other people had a</font>

123
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,390
hand in that of course everyone who's

124
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,910
ever helped anything vaguely related to

125
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,410
my physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> health has a hand in that</font>

126
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,150
but for me to be able to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> my body in</font>

127
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way and have a definite success</font>

128
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,650
point which is reaching the flap with my

129
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,090
desk those tasks do you feel a little

130
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit like you've pushed a boulder up a</font>

131
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,370
hill as a once and for a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very small</font>

132
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,800
fraction of time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boulder has just</font>

133
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,570
stayed<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and the boulder that rolls</font>

134
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,520
back again isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite the same one as</font>

135
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,989
you pushed up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place so I've</font>

136
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,489
been thinking of have been considering

137
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I've been wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does Sisyphus</font>

138
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,459
gets stronger and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does his body</font>

139
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,830
change in relation to pushing that

140
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,989
Boulder up and down<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time does</font>

141
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,940
his physical body changed as their

142
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">Boulder changed as the topography of the</font>

143
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,529
area change what is at<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

144
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,260
exact process repeatable the easy answer

145
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be mythology</font>

146
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,950
and made up stories and you know gods

147
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,540
and stuff there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else in it</font>

148
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,070
as well I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something else is</font>

149
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,630
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see when you do grow a</font>

150
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,310
little bit even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the boulder does roll</font>

151
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,840
back down all the importance of giving

152
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,910
your body physical challenge or the fact

153
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,530
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should appreciate the variety</font>

154
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,480
of experience we have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our lives or</font>

155
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,340
maybe simply that you shouldn't ask

156
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,350
Hades to wear handcuffs but yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

157
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,940
where my thoughts are this monday<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font>
