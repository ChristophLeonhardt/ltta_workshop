you want to pay a lot of attention to
how much interest the other person shows
in you how much they're listening how
much they're able to understand the way
that you feel and how much they're
willing to empathize with you the way
you could test it would be to gently
criticize behavior draw attention to it
and say you know you weren't very nice
to that waiter another quality of
narcissists is that cannot tolerate any
kind of criticism so if you draw
attention to this and she says oh you
know gosh I just had a really bad day
I'm sorry that you're right that was
rude that's a good sign it's not a
narcissist but if she gets very
defensive and starts attacking you in
return that's a good indicator
