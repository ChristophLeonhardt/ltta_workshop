following Trump's decision to cancel the White House celebration of the Philadelphia Eagles there was a lot of spin in the right-wing media about who these players are and what they've done in fact there was a misrepresentation of them kneeling during the national anthem throughout the season which did not actually happen not a single player kneeled during the national anthem throughout the season there was one player who did in the preseason but he didn't even play in the regular season so now with that said keep in mind that Fox News specifically ran still images of Eagles players kneeling and they represented it as them kneeling during the national anthem when in reality they were kneeling during prayer way before the national anthem even played why would they do that hmm gee yeah I wonder why okay also after Trump falsely implied the players of the Philadelphia Eagles protester during the national anthem Fox News aired a segment that further Trump's trumps lies and I'll give you an example by the way the the specific segment that I talked about earlier has been scrubbed from the records it's nowhere to be found online they did issue an apology because the criticism was overwhelming but there were similar narratives playing out in other shows so let's take a look at Fox and Friends the president's very simple on this he says there are certain things that you do when you are invited to the White House you go when you go proudly when the national anthem plays you stand and you put your hand over your heart not really not if you have nine instead of 70 that is an outright disrespect to the president wonder if any of the members of the Gold Star families yesterday at that event would have said we don't want to come to the White House look there's a difference right same thing with the Warriors I don't feel like I want to go I don't like this president he spent the whole season criticizing the president there seems to be a disconnect between the net people in the NFL and the American public so ultimately the president realizes the people are probably on his side this mayor of fragile egomaniac what does he understand about the Eagles weren't gonna show up nine players are showing up ultimately though this historically is a non-political event okay can I just let me give you context on that cuz that is not really true now a lot of people a lot of athletes have started not showing up at the White House because Donald Trump attacks them so he made it political it's not like hey I didn't like the president cuz it was a stance towards Puerto Rico which is a fair thing to say no in the case of the NFL he said you all should be fined or maybe fired if you speak out in a way that I don't approve of which by the way is political correctness and and so you blame people for not showing up to a guy who wanted them fired if they dared to speak out as an American and then he called them unamerican let alone Chris Long donating every check that he gets and all the games to charity let alone the work Jenkins and others on the Eagles have done Carson Wentz has raised money for the people of Haiti these are all like amazing guys and he has the nerve to call them on American and but it's not just about Trump other people have not shown up to meet presidents before and I that one famous case that I'm going to tell you about where Fox was on the exact opposite side but before you get to that I did not know this Larry Bird apparently skipped a visit with the Ronald Reagan okay now Larry Bird's a hero to a lot of those folks but they don't know his actual views okay and so now I remember in my lifetime when I first noticed it to be honest was mark Chmura who made a big deals a tight end for the Packers they won the Super Bowl and he said I will not go see Clinton because he thought Clinton was had the wrong morals and you know Monica Lewinsky affair and all that whole thing such more made a big deal about it at the time the right wing was like what a patriot March of our eyes that does not surprise me at all and they're like that is what a true American does he makes sure that he does not go and see the men who sullied the White House and imagine what their reaction would be if Clinton took some sort of action against the player right who who decided to protest and not go to the White House for the celebration just imagine what their reaction would be like that's the part that gets to me like right now the right wing is wholly supportive of our president taking punitive action against anyone who disagrees with him and by the way it goes further than this whole NFL story he's threatened to take press credentials away from media that criticizes him he can't handle any criticism which is a scary thing to consider as as someone who's the president of the United States he's supposed to be criticized by the media the media is supposed to hold him accountable for his actions by the way a disastrous ending to that March murder story shamora the man who was worried about Bill Clinton's morals later charged with sexually assaulting his 17 year old babysitter she's now he was acquitted but did say at the end it's probably things I shouldn't have been doing as a married grown man okay but he was worried about Bill Clinton's morality and if you were worried about Bill Clinton's morality wait to the yellowed of Donald Trump so finally you might be wondering why did Fox News apologize they almost never apologized they almost never correct a story well a lot of the players they were showing were white okay this is my thesis what the there on the record for correcting the story and saying they were wrong but it wasn't just they were white the reason they were on a knee the Fox pretended it was because it was during an anthem but the real reasons that they were praying so guys like Zach Ertz the tight end for the Eagles like wait you're gonna get on me for praying before a game and all martinis for praying before the game saying what kind of propaganda is this now I don't know hurts just politics at all right but when you have all the players saying you're criticizing us for praying all of a sudden and a lot of those players again are mixed black white etc and maybe mixed in Democrats Republicans and and and the word gets out and all the local papers in New Jersey and and and Philly covered it all of a sudden price is like yeah okay fine okay fine we were pretending it was an anthem but it wasn't whether it's our honest mistake yeah by the way I wanted to read a few tweets to you from the who kept pushing this narrative that it's all because they didn't stand for the national anthem first charlie kirk who spreads ridiculous nonsensical propaganda on to college campuses and pretends like he's an incredibly smart person tweeted the following if you refuse to stand for the national anthem you have no business being honored at the White House by our president so in other words he is supportive of elected officials you know punishing people who refuse to show honor to them kind of like what dictators do right don't dictators do that isn't that something that you were concerned about under the Obama administration and secondly I thought that the Conservatives on campus who are most worried about freedom of speech oh my god ben shapiro didn't get paid twenty thousand dollars from you students to get speaker I'm worried about free speech you know and and their argument which by the way this is a correct argument is that on publicly funded college campuses free speech matters right you can't have you know the administration banning certain forms of speech just because they don't like it and I agree with that but guess what else is funded by taxpayer dollars the White House government government is paid by us the American people so we have the right to exercise our free speech and criticize the president or decide to kneel during the national anthem if we want to raise awareness about a legitimate issue of police brutality in the country he's very smart like that's what you hear over and over again they keep perpetuating this nonsensical talking point about how smart these young conservatives are yet they're hypocritical at the very least and incredibly uneducated on what our Constitution is and what the freedom of speech means what the First Amendment means and what our protections are so we different we are consistent we defend the conservatives right to go speak at those universities now Charlie Kurt do you understand and all other so-called intellectuals know that anybody is actually calling Charlie an intellectual but Candice Owens called him the smartest person she's ever met oh wow no to be fair he might be the smartest person Candice has ever met that's Joe okay it's a really low bar anyway so Charlie do you understand that the president threatening punitive action including legal action and financial action against the NFL owners and the players if they don't find or fire the players for speaking is actually a core First Amendment issue that is the government taking action to prevent your free speech and yes the Supreme Court has ruled over and over again physical acts like taking a knee or raising your fist or even staying in the locker room yes that is an expression of speech it's a very obviously political speech they're making a political point about police abuse right so the reality is if you're against that you should never ever mention free speech again because you do not understand the concept at all and you're not in favor of the First Amendment and one more tweet from Britt McHenry this is my favorite can't wait for Eagles players to use this as an opportunity to virtue signal that's all we need to read I just wanted to read the virtue signal there is nothing more apparent or there's no better example of virtue signaling than talking about how you are more patriotic than everyone else because you support standing during the national anthem they always project always over and over again you are virtuous signaling in your tweet your tweet is an example of virtue signaling and I missed that and I love that you caught wrapping yourself in the flag is as virtue signaling as virtue signaling gets I'm very patriotic everyone I need to let everybody in the world know that I would stand during the national anthem and I would punish people if they refuse to do so and by the way you conservatives you're sure you're tougher than the Philadelphia Eagles you want to get in the ring with them and see what happens I don't counsel it but hey have at it Hoss two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below
