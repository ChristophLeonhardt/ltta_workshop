3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:11,698

00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,367
PRESIDENT TRUMP: THIS IS SUCH A

00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:14,234
BIG DAY.

6
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:15,669
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A MAN OF

THAT'S NOT JUST BRILLIANT BUT

00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:35,756
TOTALLY.

13
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:36,556
IN A VICTORY LAUGHING, TRUMP HAS

14
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:37,924
A MIDTERM TO GET THROUGH AND

15
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:38,492
LAID OUT THE CHOICES.

16
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:39,426
PRESIDENT TRUMP: YOU ALLOW THE

17
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:42,129
WRONG PEOPLE TO GET INTO OFFICE,

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,498
THINGS COULD CHANGE.

19
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:45,365
THEY COULD CHANGE AND THEY COULD

20
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:45,766
CHANGE FAST.

21
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:49,169
YOU DON'T HANDLE MATTERS TO AN

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,672
ARSONIST AND YOU DON'T GET POWER

23
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:54,841

HE HAS MORE.

28
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:03,016
PRESIDENT TRUMP: DEMOCRATS WANT

29
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:07,754
TO SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE YOUR

30
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:09,056

BORDERS.

36
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:25,038
DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME THE PARTY

37
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,405
OF CRIME.

38
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:26,440
THEY BECOME THE PARTY OF CRIME.

39
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,475
THINK ABOUT THAT.

40
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:29,643
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF LAW

41
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:30,644
AND ORDER AND JUSTICE.

42
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:36,283
GREG: PARTY OF CRIME.

43
00:01:36,284 --> 00:01:37,250
HE JUST GAVE THE REPUBLICANS

44
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:38,218
THEIR TALKING POINTS AND THEN,

45
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:38,952
OF COURSE, THE NICKNAMES.

46
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:48,462
PRESIDENT TRUMP: LEAKY JOE BIDE

00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:53,934

HE WON'T CHANGE.

53
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:13,019
AND THEN I'M PRETTY SURE HE DID

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,954
SOMETHING NO OTHER AMERICAN

55
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:14,721
PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN HISTORY.

56
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:15,555
HE THANKED A GUY NAMED WEEK.

65
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,075
AND YET, I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

66
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:35,909
ABOUT THE SPACE FORCE AND IF

67
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,077
THAT IS WHERE IT IS AT.

68
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:38,512
PRESIDENT TRUMP: SPACE FORCE.

69
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:42,315
THAT IS WHERE IT IS AT.

70
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:42,783
THAT IS RIGHT.

71
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:44,484
THAT IS WHERE IT IS THAT.

72
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:44,851
[LAUGHTER]

73
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:51,224

VICTORY LAPS, LET'S FACE IT.

75
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:54,561

79
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:58,064
>> ABSOLUTELY.

80
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,033
THEY'RE HAVING FUN BUT CONTRAST

81
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:04,471
THE PEOPLE WITH THOSE AT THE TOP

82
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:06,773
RALLIES AND THOSE PROTESTERS AT

THE MALL IN WASHINGTON DC.

84
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:10,610
I DON'T LIKE ELEVATORS WHEN

88
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,518
HOPEFULLY THE STUFF WON'T WORK.

89
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:19,352
THEY'RE NOT STOPPING THE

90
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:21,054
SCREAMING BUT LEFT-WING

KAT: GREG, I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT

111
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,757
OF THINKING AND I THINK I HAVE

112
00:03:57,758 --> 00:03:59,960
FIGURED OUT WHY TRUMP HOLDS ALL

113
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:04,831
THESE RALLIES.

114
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:05,198
GREG: WHY?

115
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:05,899
KAT: MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY

ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING OR THEY

117
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:09,336
HAVE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE,

118
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:10,136
WHAT DO THEY DO?

119
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,172
THEY GO HAVE A DRINK.

120
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,541
GREG: RIGHT, RIGHT.

121
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,942
KAT: TRUMP DOES NOT DRINK.

122
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:18,912
HE'S BUILD VENUES FOR THE PEOPLE

123
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:19,913
WHO LOVE HIM AND ALLOW THEM TO

00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,314
CLAP AND CHEER WHILE HE TALKS

125
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:22,182
ABOUT IT.

[LAUGHTER]

127
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:30,757
GREG: THAT CREATES THE SAME

128
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:34,694
FEELING OF BEING DRUNK.

129
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:35,128

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

135
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:55,048
GREG: TYRUS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

136
00:04:55,049 --> 00:05:00,554
SAYING THIS TRUMP TRUMP REFUSED

137
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:01,888
TO GIVE IN AND BACKED HIM AND

138
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:02,822
THAT'S BECAUSE ALL HE DOES IS

139
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:03,123
FIGHT.

140
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:04,257
HE LIKES TO FIGHT AND GAVE THE

141
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:05,959
REPUBLICANS THE ENERGY TO FIGHT

142
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,627
AND THAT IS WHY I THINK HE

143
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,896
DOESN'T STOP.

144
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:12,265
HE DOES THIS VICTORY LAP AND

145
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,166
START GOING AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE

146
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,669
BECAUSE HE WILL QUIT.

147
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,636
TYRUS: HERE'S THE BUZZ KILL ON

148
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:19,539
THIS.

149
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,241
I THINK HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE

150
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:21,541
HAPPY.

151
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,309
KAVANAUGH ALWAYS SHOULD HAVE

152
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,779
BEEN VOTED AND IT WAS NEVER --

153
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,948
WE HAD TO WHETHER THE

154
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:32,252
ALLEGATIONS BUT AFTER THE FBI

155
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:33,386
IMITATION IT WAS CLEAR THERE IS

156
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:33,987
NO COOPERATIVE EVIDENCE.

157
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:34,854
THE REASON FOR HIM NOT TO BE PUT

158
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:35,221
IN.

159
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:40,894
BUT I'M ALL FOR GOING TO A

160
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:41,895
FOOTBALL GAME AND WINNING THE

161
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:42,729
WRESTLING MATCH WHEN YOU

00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:44,664
YOU GO BACK THROUGHOUT THE REST

164
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:48,268
OF THE DAY.

165
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,269
MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN YOU DO

166
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,537
CELEBRATE AND YOU GO ALL IN

YOU ARE WRITING CHECKS THAT WE

170
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,277
THE WHITE HOUSE WITH HIS

173
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:05,051
SMILE AND CALLED IT A DAY.

174
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:08,021
WE GO TO THE BARS AND GO BACK TO

00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,923

CHECK HE WROTE WITH THE OTHER

178
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,326

179
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,095
FOR ME, I WISH I'M ALL FOR THE

180
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:16,096
VICTORY LAP BUT THE TRASH

181
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:18,431
TALKING IS GETTING TO THE POINT

182
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:19,432
WHERE IT'S CAUSING ISSUES FOR

183
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,266
THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM AND

184
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,101
STAND BY HIM THE MOST.

185
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:23,637
GREG: A GUY IN A RED HAT TONIGHT

186
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:24,704
IS MORE LIKELY TO GET BEAT UP.

187
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:31,144
TYRUS: YES, BECAUSE THE USE THE

188
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:32,078
EXCUSE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT

189
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,481

GREG: WILL HAVE YOU ON REMOTE

204
00:06:58,806 --> 00:06:59,639

WE CAN'T STAY CELEBRATING FOR

213
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:23,763
TOO LONG.

214
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:24,998
THIS IS A MARATHON NOT A SPRINT.

215
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,099
DEMOCRATS PARTY SAID IF THEY

216
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,167
TAKE BACK THE HOUSE AND THE

217
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,168
MIDTERM ELECTIONS THEY'RE MOVING

218
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:28,835

HIM AS A JUDGE.

223
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:40,246
OBVIOUSLY, THERE WOULD BE NO

224
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,114
SUPER MAJORITY BUT THE DEMOCRATS

225
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,282
ARE STILL RUNNING ON THE

226
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,183
PLATFORM AND REALITY AS WE KNOW

227
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:44,217
IT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH THEM.

228
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:45,285
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO NOT

229
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:45,852

230
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:49,456

234
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:55,462
FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE.

235
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:57,397
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.

236
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,232
THEY CAN'T DRIVE AWAY.

237
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:01,568
THERE STARING AT -- IN YOUR

238
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:01,968
WINDOW.

00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:06,539
KAT: SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO LET

240
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:06,806

00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:13,012

243
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:13,880
TYRUS: BUT IT'S WORTH DRIVING

244
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:14,914
WITH A PRETTIER AND TALLER

245
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:15,815
GIRLFRIEND IN FRONT OF THEIR

246
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:16,116
HOUSE.

247
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:17,183
I'M SORRY, I KEEP TURNING THIS

248
00:08:17,184 --> 00:00:00,000
WAY.
