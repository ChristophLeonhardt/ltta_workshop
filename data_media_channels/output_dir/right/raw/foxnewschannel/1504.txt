1
00:00:01,405 --> 00:00:03,107
NOW, AS I SAY, THEY MAY NOT

2
00:00:03,107 --> 00:00:04,608
RISE TO THE LEVEL OF JAMES

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,644
BOND, BUT THEY ARE SPYING.

4
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:08,312
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK

5
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:09,279
ABOUT JAMES CLAPPER COMING

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,214
OUT NOW AND TALKING ABOUT

7
00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:15,452
THE FACT THAT ARE

8
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:16,487
THE FACT THAT AFTER I LEFT

9
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:17,454
GOVERNMENT SERVICE I HAD MY

10
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:18,255
OWN DECISION TO MAKE.

11
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:21,425
I HAD NOT PLANNED TO WRITE

12
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:22,459
ANYTHING AFTER EXPERIENCING

13
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:23,394
THE ELECTION AND BEHAVIOR BY

14
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:24,395
AND THE IMPACT OF THE TRUMP

15
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:27,898
ADMINISTRATION, I CHANGED MY

16
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:28,198
MIND.

17
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:31,302
>> I THINK HE HAS A PERSONAL

18
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:32,503
ANTIPATHY FOR DONALD TRUMP

19
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:35,005
SHARED WILDLY AMONG CERTAIN

20
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:35,673
PROFESSIONALS, CERTAINLY

21
00:00:35,673 --> 00:00:37,141
JOHN BRENNAN HAS THAT

22
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:38,676
FEELING AND ONE CAN

23
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:39,410
CERTAINLY IMAGINE JAMES

24
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,277
COMEY DOES AS WELL.

25
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:41,846
THERE IS THAT MOTIVATION.

26
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:42,813
YOU HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY

27
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:45,316
AT WHAT CLAPPER HAS SAID HE

28
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:46,617
IS NOW CLAIMING AS YOU

29
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:47,785
MENTIONED TO ERIC SWALWELL

30
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:48,786
THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE

31
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:51,956
DECISIVE IN THE ELECTION.

32
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:53,357
I WORRY ABOUT A MAN WHO WAS

33
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:55,192
ONCE CONSIDERED A SERIOUS

34
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:55,926
INTELLIGENCE ANALYST

35
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:58,729
REACHING THAT CONCLUSION

36
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:59,630
BECAUSE ALL THE DEEP DIVES

37
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,698
THAT HAVE BEEN DONE INTO

38
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:01,866
WHAT THE RUSSIANS DID DURING

39
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,267
THE ELECTION HAVE INDICATED,

40
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:07,004
YEAH, THEY TRIED WHAT THEY

41
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,940
SPENT AND WHAT THEY DID WAS

42
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,342
UTTERLY DWARFED BY ALL THE

43
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:12,376
OTHER EFFORTS AND SPENDING

44
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:13,778
AND ADVERTISING ALL THE

45
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:14,679
OTHER MESSAGING AND

46
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:15,580
CAMPAIGNING THAT WAS DONE ON

47
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:21,185
BOTH SIDES OF THAT CAMPAIGN

48
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,320
IT ASSUMES UNBELIEVABLE

49
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,254
SOMEONE COULD COME TO THE

50
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:24,722
CONCLUSION THAT WHAT THE

51
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:25,890
RUSSIAN IS NOT AS BIG AS

52
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,492
THEY WANTED IT TO BE,

53
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:28,960
PERHAPS THEY THOUGHT WAS BIG

54
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,794
BUT ACTUALLY MINUSCULE THAT

55
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:30,962
THAT COULD HAVE MADE THE

56
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:31,362
DIFFERENCE.

57
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:39,437
IT'S JUST NOT PLAUSIBLE.

58
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:40,004
>> Martha: CHARGED 13

59
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:40,938
DIFFERENT RUSSIANS WITH AN

60
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:43,007
T. TEMPT TO GET AN ACCOUNT

61
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,909
AND THEY WANTED TO

62
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:45,276
INFLUENCE.

63
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:46,778
TAKE A PIECE OF ANOTHER BOOK

64
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:47,979
BY JAMES CLAPPER.

65
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:48,780
ANOTHER PIECE OF THE BOOK

66
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,781
AND PUT IT ON THE SCREEN.

67
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,984
OF COURSE, THE RUSSIAN

68
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,585
EFFORT AFFECTED THE OUTCOME.

69
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:55,520
SURPRISING EVEN THEMSELVES.

70
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,754
THEY SWUNG THE ELECTION TO A

71
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:57,388
TRUMP WIN.

72
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:58,656
TO CONCLUDE OTHERWISE

73
00:01:58,656 --> 00:01:59,857
STRETCHES LOGIC.

74
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:02,293
COMMON SENSE, AND EXTRA

75
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:04,896
DUTIES TO THE

76
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:04,929
EXTIES TO THE

77
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:04,963
EXTRES TO THE

78
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:08,066
EXTRAS TO THE

79
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:08,098
LETRAS TO THE

80
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,099
LESSAS TO THE

81
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,133
LESSTH TO THE

82
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:09,199
LESSTHANO THE

83
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,232
LESSTHAN 8THE

84
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:09,267
LESSTHAN 80,E

85
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,603
LESSTHAN 80,000 VOTES IN THREE

86
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:12,570
KEY STATES SWUNG THE

87
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:12,937
ELECTION.

88
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:13,838
I HAVE NO DOUBT MORE VOTES

89
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:15,239
THAN THAT WERE INFLUENCED BY

90
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,041
THIS MASSIVE EFFORT BY THE

91
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,442
RUSSIANS.

92
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:18,576
SOMEHOW HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO

93
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:20,011
GET INTO THE HEAD OF 80,000

94
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:21,312
VOTERS AND EVEN MORE THAN

95
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,580
THAT, REALLY HE KNOWS THAT'S

96
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,516
WHY THEY VOTED THE WAY THEY

97
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:24,782
DID.

98
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:25,817
>> THE PROBLEM WITH SAYING

99
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:29,254
HE KNOWS SOMETHING LIKE THAT

100
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:30,188
IS FIRST OF ALL I PRESENTS

101
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:30,955
NO EVIDENCE.

102
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:40,665
HE CALLS IT MASSIVE.

103
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,334
HE OUGHT TO KNOW HOW VAST.

104
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,535
YOU CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT

105
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:47,139
IS GOING ON ON THE MINDS OF

106
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,174
COUNTLESS VOTERS AS THEY

107
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:50,809
MAKE UP THEIR MINDS HOW TO

108
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:51,109
VOTE.

109
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:52,711
IF THERE HAD BEEN SOME HUGE

110
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:55,180
ISSUE INVOLVING RUSSIA THAT

111
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,884
HAD BEEN CENTRAL TO THE

112
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,018
CAMPAIGN AND ARGUED

113
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:00,819
THROUGHOUT AND THE RUSSIANS

114
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,287
HAD PULLED SOME KIND OF

115
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:02,888
INTELLIGENCE STUNT WHERE

116
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:03,856
THEY MADE IT APPEAR THE

117
00:03:03,856 --> 00:03:05,290
FACTS WERE ONE WAY AND IN

118
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,191
FACT THE FACTS WERE THE

119
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,426
OTHER, YOU COULD KIND OF

120
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:08,360
MAKE THAT ARGUMENT.

121
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,428
NOT ON THIS EVIDENCE.

122
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:12,464
THAT'S DISTURBINGLY SILLY.

123
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:13,131
>> Martha: IT'S INTERESTING

124
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:17,169
TO ME BECAUSE IN THE INTLOWS

125
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,170
HE IS DOING HE WILL LAY THIS

126
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,175
OUT AND SAY I KNOW THIS NOW.

127
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:23,909
I'M DEFINITE AND CERTAIN

128
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:24,643
ABOUT IT.

129
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:25,677
HOW YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T HAVE

130
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:26,411
ANYTHING TO SUBSTANTIATE IT

131
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:30,516
OTHER THAN THE NUMBER OF

132
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:31,416
TWITTER ACCOUNT THAT WERE

133
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,484
OPENED AND THE LIKE.

134
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:36,588
BUT THEN WHEN ASKED HOW HE

135
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:38,023
THINKS HE SAYS PUTIN WAS

136
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:38,824
ABSOLUTELY INVOLVED.

137
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:39,992
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THAT HE

138
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:41,260
SAYS THAT'S CLASSIFIED.

139
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,661
I CAN'T GET INTO THAT.

140
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:43,295
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

141
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,596
THINK ABOUT THIS, MARTHA.

142
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:45,564
HE EVEN SAYS IN THE COURSE

143
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:46,732
OF THE THINGS HAVE YOU CITED

144
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:47,833
THERE SOMETHING ABOUT HOW A

145
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,134
LOT OF MESSAGES THAT WERE

146
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:50,135
COMING OUT OF THE TRUMP

147
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:50,969
CAMPAIGN WERE THE ONES THAT

148
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,071
THE RUSSIANS WERE PROMOTING,

149
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:53,472
RIGHT.

150
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,972
>> Martha: RIGHT.

151
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:54,973
>> HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD

152
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,041
YOU EVER BE ABLE TO TELL

153
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,744
WHICH OF THOSE MESSAGES IF

154
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:00,045
THEY ARE MIRRORED BY THE

155
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:02,548
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND ALL ITS

156
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:03,515
UTTERANCES ARE ONES PEOPLE

157
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:04,950
BELIEVED AND NOT THE ONES BY

158
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,820
THE RUSSIANS OR VISA VERSA.

159
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,925
IT'S AN EXTRAVAGANT CLAIM HE

160
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:13,993
WILL ONE WELL BEYOND THE

161
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:15,127
KNOWLEDGE OF INTELLIGENCE

162
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:15,461
OFFICER.

163
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,661
AND CITES NO EVIDENCE FOR IT

164
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,264
THIS IS A MAN, MARTHA, WHO

165
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:20,333
HAS HAD HIS TROUBLE SHAKING

166
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,067
HANDS WITH THE TRUTH IN THE

167
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,837
PAST AS HAS BEEN NOTED

168
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:25,772
INTERESTINGLY ON THE VIEW,

169
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:27,040
GOING BACK AND FORTH, OH,

170
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,774
WAS I TALKING ABOUT

171
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:28,841
SOMETHING ELSE.

172
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,609
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY EXPLAIN

173
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,843
WHAT THE OTHER THING HE WAS

174
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:31,644
TALKING ABOUT WAS.

175
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:33,479
>> NOT ONLY THAT MARTHA, THE

176
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,814
QUESTION THAT RON WYDEN

177
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:39,285
ASKED HIM ABOUT SPYING ON

178
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:41,054
AMERICA WAS VERY BROAD, VERY

179
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,088
GENERAL, SPOKE OF NO

180
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:43,156
PARTICULAR PROGRAM AT ALL.

181
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,223
SO, WHEN HE SAYS HE IS

182
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:45,058
SPEAKING ABOUT ANOTHER

183
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,659
PROGRAM, WHAT OTHER PROGRAM?

184
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,528
PROGRAM WAS BEING MENTIONED.

185
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:49,929
HE WAS ASKED A BROAD BASED

186
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,964
QUESTION AND HIS ANSWER WAS

187
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:52,565
ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

188
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:56,102
>> AND HE SAID, YEAH, NOT

189
00:04:56,102 --> 00:00:00,000
WITTINGLY, OR UNWITTINGLY,
