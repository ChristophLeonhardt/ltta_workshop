FREEDOM. I'M LELAND VITTERT. NOW BACK TO THE "YOUR WORLD" SPECIAL. YOU'RE A VET, YOU WAIT AND YOU WAIT A LONG TIME STILL. IS THAT TRUE? THAT IS CORRECT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE HILL DID A REPORT ON THIS JUST IN MARTHA V.A. HAD BEEN CAUGHT SENDING FALSE REPORTS ABOUT WAIT TIMES. WE KNOW THAT VETERANS ARE STILL WAITING ON AVERAGE LONGER FOR CARE, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT FIXING WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE. Trish: V.A. WHISTLE-BLOWER SCOTT DAVIS SPOKE TO NEIL AND CONGRESS ABOUTED. PASSING BILL TO GIVE OUR VETERANS MORE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE OUTSIDE THE V.A. LET'S GO TO VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, SCOTT TAYLOR. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. Trish: SO ARE YOU HAPPY? HAPPY ABOUT WHAT? ABOUT THE BILL THAT WE PASSED? Trish: YEAH, YEAH. IS THIS GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR VETERANS TO GET A DIFFERENT KIND OF CARE, BETTER CARE. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY, YEAH, I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT IT WILL. IT'S A GOOD BILL. IT WILL TAKE QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF FOCUS FROM THE INCUMBENT SECRETARY AND FOLKS LIKE MYSELF TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS. ABSOLUTELY. IN MY OWN V.A., MY BIG HOSPITAL THERE HAS IS A ONE STAR OUT OF FIVE STAR IN TERMS OF WAIT BACKS AND CALL BACKS. THAT'S WHAT A VETERAN SEES. WE HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT. THIS BILL WILL DEAL WITH THAT WE HAVE TO EXPEDITE HIRING. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT BUREAUCRACY. IT WILL HAVE TO HAVE RIGOROUS OVERSIGHT AND DETERMINED FOCUS TO GET IT IMPLEMENTED. REPRESENTATIVE, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE THAT ARE "YOUR WORLD" WORRIED THIS WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THE HOSPITALS THEMSELVES? THE V.A. COULD BE MORE COMPETITIVE, OFFER BETTER CARE, MAYBE NOT. LET ME SAY WE NEED A WHOLE CULTURE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE NEED TO BE CUSTOMER SERVICE ORIENTED FOR VETERANS IN THE V.A. THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICS GOING ON ON THE LEFT. LIKE OKAY, YOU'RE PRIVATIZING THE V.A. IT'S THE DUTY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO CARE FOR OUR VETERANS WHEN THEY COME BACK. THERE SHOULD BE MORE PRIVATE OPTIONS OUT THERE. THERE'S PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT NEED THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO SUPPLEMENT THE V.A. AND/OR COMPETE IN SOME AREAS. THERE'S SOME AREAS THAT QUITE FRANKLY NEED THE V.A. TO HELP THEM IN THEIR PRIVATE CARE. MORE OPTIONS, PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IS A GOOD THING RATHER THAN A BAD THING. Trish: SO HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN YOUR VIEW? THE CONGRESS HAS HAD A YEAR TO GET THIS THING IMPLEMENTED. AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE, THE V.A. IS A VERY BIG BUREAUCRACY. YOU CAN SPEND A CAREER TRYING TO FIX IT. I'M NOT UNDER ANY ILLUSIONS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT AND FIGHT TO GET IT DONE. HOPEFULLY WITHIN A YEAR. BUT THAT WILL TAKE FOCUS AND A LOT OF OVERSIGHT. Trish: WHAT HAPPENS IF NOT AS MANY REPUBLICANS ARE IN THE SEATS COME 2018 AND YOU'RE STILL WORKING TO GET THIS IMPLEMENTED AND UP TO SPEED? ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL THAT YOUR PROCESS WILL BE DERAILED? I WOULD HOPE NOT. I THINK THAT AGAIN, MORE OPTIONS IN GETTING THESE WAIT TIMES DOWN. THERE SHOULD BE A DESIRE BY BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO GET THIS DONE. I DON'T THINK WE'RE MOVING WE'RE PRIVATIZING THE V.A. AS A POLITICAL THING. I HOPE TO WIN MAJORITY. IF WE DON'T, I THINK THAT THEIR RHETORIC OF PRIVATIZING THE V.A. WILL BE DOWN PLAYED, NOT SAYING IT ANYMORE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT VETERAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, VETERANS ARE PRESSURING TO MAKE SURE THIS IS IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S PROPER OVERSIGHT TO GET IT DONE. THERE'S A DESIRE TO REDUCE THE WAIT TIMES AND TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS. Trish: CONGRESSMAN, YOU'RE A FORMER NAVY SEAL. I'M SURE YOU HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT HAVE COME HOME AND FOUND A CHALLENGING SITUATION. NOT JUST IN TERMS OF FINDING A JOB AND FIT BACK INTO SOCIETY IN TERMS OF THE HORRORS THEY HAVE SEEN BUT TO ALSO GET THE PROPER MEDICAL CARE. HOW MUCH OF YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND YOUR FRIENDS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAS INFLUENCED YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SEE THIS CHANGE AND DESIRE TO PUSH IT THROUGH? IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THAT UNBROKEN LINE OF PATRIOTS THAT HAVE STEPPED FORWARD ON BEHALF OF THIS NATION. I HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING SOME OF THE MOST ACTIVE VETS IN THE NATION. I HAVE TONS OF FRIENDS THAT ARE IN THE V.A. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE DEAL WITH EVERY DAY IN MY DISTRICT. IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.BUT IT'S AN HONOR OR THE ME TO DO SO. ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY AND MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND, WE WISH NOTHING BUT THE BEST OF THE OUR VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. Trish: REPRESENTATIVE TAYLOR, MY DAD IS A VETERAN AND HE RELIES ON THE V.A. CARE. I HOPE YOU DO ALL YOU CAN FOR
