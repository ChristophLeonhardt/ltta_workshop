>> GOOD AFTERNOON.

6
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:20,519
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR RIGHT

00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:23,356
YOU SEE HIM GREETING STEEL 

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:23,889
WORKERS FROM PITTSBURGH.

00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:24,690
EVERYBODY.

00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,325
I'M HONORED TO BE WITH OUR

00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:28,528
INCREDIBLE STEEL AND ALUMINUM

00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,902
VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE.

25
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:40,974
YOU KNOW THAT.

26
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:41,608
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE REASON

27
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,610
I'M HERE.

28
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,813
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU.

29
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:51,918
I ALSO WANT TO THANK SECRETARY 

30
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,786
MNUCHIN, AMBASSADOR LIGHT 

31
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:57,190
HOUSER, PETER NAVARRO, MIKE 

32
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,559
PENCE, OUR GREAT VICE PRESIDENT.

33
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,592
THEY'VE WORKED SO HARD ON 

34
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:03,129
GETTING THIS GOING AND GETTING 

35
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:03,396
IT DONE.

36
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,629
AND PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO 

37
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,366
REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.

38
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:11,838
WE HAVE TO PROTECT AND BUILD OUR

39
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:12,438
STEEL AND ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES.

40
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:14,440
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SHOWING 

41
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,007
GREAT FLEXIBILITY AND 

42
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,609
COOPERATION TOWARD THOSE THAT 

43
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,412
ARE REALLY FRIENDS OF OURS, BOTH

44
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,046
ON A TRADE BASIS AND A MILITARY 

45
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,715
BASIS.

46
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,618
A STRONG STEEL AND ALUMINUM 

47
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,286
INDUSTRY ARE VITAL TO OUR 

48
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:29,389
NATIONAL SECURITY, ABSOLUTELY 

49
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:29,689
VITAL.

50
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,490
STEEL IS STEEL.

51
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,824
YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T 

52
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,726
HAVE A COUNTRY.

53
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,760
OUR INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN 

54
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,765
TARGETED FOR YEARS AND YEARS, 

55
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,732
DECADES, IN FACT, BY UNFAIR 

56
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:40,400
FOREIGN TRADE PRACTICES LEADING 

57
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,072
TO THE SHUTTERED PLANTS AND 

58
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:46,439
MILLS.

59
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,610
THE LAYING OFF OF MILLIONS OF 

60
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,414
WORKERS, AND THE DECIMATION OF 

61
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,847
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES.

62
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,048
AND THAT'S GOING TO STOP, RIGHT?

63
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:59,919
IT'S GOING TO STOP.

64
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,220
THIS IS NOT MERELY AN ECONOMIC 

65
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,457
DISASTER, BUT IT'S A SECURITY 

66
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:04,724
DISASTER.

67
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,025
WE WANT TO BUILD OUR SHIPS.

68
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,927
WE WANT TO BUILD OUR PLANES, WE 

69
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,829
WANT TO BUILD OUR MILITARY 

70
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,797
EQUIPMENT WITH STEEL, WITH 

71
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,633
ALUMINUM FROM OUR COUNTRY.

72
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,068
AND NOW WE'RE FINALLY TAKING 

73
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:22,208
ACTION TO CORRECT THIS 

74
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:22,976
LONG-OVERDUE PROBLEM.

75
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,711
IT'S A TRAVESTY.

76
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:26,813
I'M DEFENDING AMERICA'S NATIONAL

77
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,980
SECURITY BY PLACING TARIFFS ON 

78
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,580
FOREIGN IMPORTS OF STEEL AND 

79
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,918
ALUMINUM.

80
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,620
WE WILL HAVE A 25% TARIFF ON 

81
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,422
FOREIGN STEEL AND A 10% TARIFF 

82
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,994
ON FOREIGN ALUMINUM.

83
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,896
WHEN THE PRODUCT COMES ACROSS 

84
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:44,831
OUR BORDERS.

85
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,836
IT'S A PROCESS CALLED DUMPING.

86
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,472
AND THEY DUMPED AT ANY TIME ON 

87
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:57,810
ANY NATION ANYWHERE IN THE 

88
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,379
WORLD, AND IT DROVE OUR PLANTS 

89
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,313
OUT OF BUSINESS.

90
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,414
IT DROVE OUR AFFECTS OUT OF 

91
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,415
BUSINESS.

92
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,350
AND WE WANT A LOT OF STEEL 

93
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,517
COMING IN TO OUR COUNTRY, BUT WE

94
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,586
WANT IT TO BE FAIR AND WE WANT 

95
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,689
OUR WORKERS TO BE PROTECTED, 

96
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,490
EXCEPT, FRANKLY, OUR COMPANIES 

97
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,928
TO BE PROTECTED .

98
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,296
BY CONTRAST WE WILL NOT PLACE 

99
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,597
ANY NEW TAX ON PRODUCT MADE IN 

100
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:19,098
THE USA.

101
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,833
SO THERE'S NO TAX IF A PRODUCT 

102
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,001
IS MADE IN THE USA.

103
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,170
YOU DON'T WANT TO THE PAY TAX, 

104
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,473
BRING YOUR PLANT TO THE USA.

105
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,109
THERE'S NO TAX, WHICH WILL WE 

106
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,511
WILL BENEFIT FROM THE MASSIVE 

107
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,279
TAX CUTS WE HAVE IN PLACE.

108
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,148
WE HAVE PASSED THE LARGEST TAX 

109
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:35,715
CUT PLAN IN THE COUNTRY'S 

110
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,752
HISTORY.

111
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,253
AND THAT HAS CAUSED REALLY 

112
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,488
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS BETWEEN THAT 

113
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,790
AND REGULATION CUTTING, AND I 

114
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,792
THINK MAYBE REGULATION CUTTING 

115
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:47,760
EVERY BIT AS MUCH.

116
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,063
AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO ON 

117
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:50,830
REGULATIONS, BUT WE'VE CUT MORE 

118
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,465
THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IN 

119
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,934
HISTORY SO WE'RE URGING ALL 

120
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,803
COMPANIES TO BUY AMERICAN.

121
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,437
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT, BUY 

122
00:03:58,437 --> 00:03:58,805
AMERICAN.

123
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,673
THE ACTION THAT I'M TAKING TODAY

124
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,742
FOLLOWS A NINE-MONTH 

125
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT 

126
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,281
OF COMMERCE, SECRETARY ROSS, 

127
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,015
DOCUMENTING A GROWING CRISIS IN 

128
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,351
OUR STEEL AND ALUMINUM 

129
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:15,922
PRODUCTION THAT THREATENS THE 

130
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,589
SECURITY OF OUR NATION, AND ALSO

131
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,458
IS BAD FOR US ECONOMICALLY AND 

132
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,392
WITH JOBS.

133
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:23,829
THE AMERICAN STEEL ALUMINUM 

134
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,130
INDUSTRY HAS BEEN RAVAGED BY 

135
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,633
AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN TRADE 

136
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:27,900
PRACTICES.

137
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,302
IT'S REALLY AN ASSAULT ON OUR 

138
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,238
COUNTRY.

139
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,607
IT'S BEEN AN ASSAULT.

140
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,708
THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

141
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,744
OTHER COUNTRIES ADDED PRODUCTION

142
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,345
CAPACITY THAT FAR EXCEEDS 

143
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,846
DEMAND, AND FLUTTERED THE WORLD 

144
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:45,151
MARKET WITH CHEAP METAL THAT IS 

145
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,386
SUBSIDIZED BY FOREIGN 

146
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,053
GOVERNMENTS, CREATING JOBS FOR 

147
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,088
THEIR COUNTRY AND TAKING AWAY 

148
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,723
JOBS FROM OUR COUNTRY.

149
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,357
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR

150
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:53,526
A LONG TIME, A LOT LONGER THAN 

151
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,694
MY POLITICAL CAREER.

152
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,963
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR

153
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,597
MANY YEARS.

154
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,698
FOR EXAMPLE, IT TAKES CHINA 

155
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:02,267
ABOUT ONE MONTH TO PRODUCE AS 

156
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,036
MUCH STEEL AS THEY PRODUCE IN 

157
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:04,670
THE UNITED STATES IN AN ENTIRE 

158
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,807
YEAR.

159
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,942
BECAUSE WE'VE CLOSED DOWN SO 

160
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,111
MUCH CAPACITY.

161
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,915
PLANTS CLOSED ALL OVER THE 

162
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:16,949
UNITED STATES, AND SOME PLANTS I

163
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,417
SEE MASSIVE PLANTS FROM 4,000 

164
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,152
YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE WORKING IN

165
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,721
A YOU LITTLE CORNER OF THE 

166
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:22,988
BUILDING.

167
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:23,922
WE'RE GOING TO GET THOSE 

168
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,191
BUILDINGS OPEN AGAIN AND 

169
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,894
PRODUCING AGAIN.

170
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,528
THAT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT THING

171
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:28,895
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

172
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,398
AND THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STOP.

173
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,035
ALUMINUM IMPORTS NOW ACCOUNT FOR

174
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,771
MORE THAN 90% OF THE PRIMARY 

175
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,138
AMERICAN DEMAND.

176
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,941
OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, 

177
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,008
NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICAN 

178
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,610
RAW STEEL COMPANIES HAVE GONE 

179
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,914
OUT OF BUSINESS.

180
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,849
MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE STEEL

181
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,350
JOBS HAVE DISAPPEARED.

182
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,419
SIX PRIMARY ALUMINUM SMELTERS, 

183
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,255
WHICH IS A BIG DEAL, HAVE 

184
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,926
PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN SINCE JUST

185
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:00,393
2012.

186
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,560
THE ACTIONS WE'RE TAKING TODAY 

187
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,764
ARE NOT A MATTER OF CHOICE, THEY

188
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,532
ARE A MATTER OF NECESSITY FOR 

189
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,402
OUR SECURITY.

190
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,769
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE 

191
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:11,403
NATIONAL SECURITY BENEFITS OF 

192
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,505
THIS ORDER.

193
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,941
YESTERDAY IN ANTICIPATION THAT 

194
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,776
WE WOULD BE HERE TODAY, U.S. 

195
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:19,745
STEEL ANNOUNCED ITS REOPENING A 

196
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:22,949
MILL IN ILLINOIS, A BIG ONE, AND

197
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,416
RECALLING 500 WORKERS 

198
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,153
IMMEDIATELY.

199
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,921
THAT'S GOING ON ALL OVER 

200
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:29,489
COUNTRY.

201
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,489
BY THE WAY, IT WENT ON WITH 

202
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:36,295
SOLAR PANELS, WHICH WE DID THREE

203
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,497
MONTHS AGO, AND WASHING 

204
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,964
MACHINES, WHERE THEY WERE 

205
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:41,968
DUMPING WASHING MACHINES ALL 

206
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,501
OVER OUR COUNTRY, AND NOW 

207
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,871
THEY'RE EXPANDING PLANS TO MAKE 

208
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,406
WASHING MACHINES.

209
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,575
A SKILLED, TRAINED WORKFORCE IN 

210
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,944
STEEL IS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF 

211
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,514
AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND 

212
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,381
MUST BE PROTECTED.

213
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:59,919
AFTER THE SIGNING OF THIS 

214
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,353
PROCLAMATION, CENTURY ALUMINUM 

215
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:04,290
IN KENTUCKY, IT'S A GREAT 

216
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,426
COMPANY, WILL BE INVESTING OVER 

217
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,795
$100 MILLION TO UPGRADED THEIR 

218
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:12,364
MILITARY GRADE HIGH-QUALITY 

219
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:13,299
ALUMINUM PRODUCTION WHICH IS 

220
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:13,933
ALSO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR

221
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:18,538
NATIONAL SECURITY.

222
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,373
THAT'S 150,000 ADDITIONAL TONS 

223
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:22,842
OF ALUMINUM.

224
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,743
THINK OF IT.

225
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,778
THIS IS A CLOSED PLANT AND NOW 

226
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,482
THEY'RE DOING 150,000 TONS.

227
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,150
PRODUCTION AND AN ADDITIONAL 300

228
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,685
WORKERS AND ULTIMATELY MANY MORE

229
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,252
HIRED IN THE GREAT STATE OF 

230
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:37,423
KENTUCKY.

231
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,192
A PACKAGE OF SOMETIMES $90,000 

232
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,260
PER WORKER.

233
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,063
OUR GREATEST PRESIDENTS ALL 

234
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,198
UNDERSTOOD FROM WASHINGTON TO 

235
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,101
LINCOLN TO JACKSON TO TEDDY 

236
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,136
ROOSEVELT, THAT AMERICA MUST 

237
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,105
HAVE A STRONG, VIBRANT, AND 

238
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:53,772
INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURING BASE.

239
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:57,710
HAS TO HAVE IT.

240
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,444
PRESIDENT McKINLEY, WHO FELT 

241
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,647
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS, 

242
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,683
COUNTRY WAS VERY, VERY 

243
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:03,983
SUCCESSFUL.

244
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,084
WE ACTUALLY OPERATED OUT OF CASH

245
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:11,190
FLOW, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.

246
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,458
THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF OF THE 

247
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,325
REPUBLICANS HE SAID MADE THE 

248
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:16,195
LIVES OF MASSES OF OUR 

249
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,997
COUNTRYMEN SWEETER AND BRIGHTER 

250
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,833
AND BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER.

251
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,502
IT IS THE BEST FOR OUR 

252
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,137
CITIZENSHIP AND OUR CIVILIZATION

253
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,239
AND OPENS UP THE HIGHER AND 

254
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:30,643
BETTER DESTINY FOR OUR PEOPLE.

255
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,679
MANY POLITICIANS LAMENTED THE 

256
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,948
DECLINE OF OUR PROUD INDUSTRIES 

257
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,850
AND DENOUNCED GLOBAL CAPACITY.

258
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,184
BUT NO ONE TOOK ACTION.

259
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:40,885
ALL OF OUR POLITICIANS SAW WHAT 

260
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:41,988
WAS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY.

261
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,289
I'VE SEEN IT FOR 25 YEARS I'VE 

262
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,324
BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT.

263
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,893
I TALKED ABOUT JAPAN, TALKED 

264
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:48,794
ABOUT CHINA.

265
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,428
BUT THE POLITICIANS NEVER DID 

266
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:49,828
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

267
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:53,499
BUT NOW THEY ARE.

268
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,068
OUR FACTORIES WERE LEFT TO ROT 

269
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,871
AND TO RUST ALL OVER THE PLACE.

270
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,940
THRIVING COMMUNITIES TURNED INTO

271
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,907
GHOST TOWNS.

272
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,877
YOU GUYS KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

273
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,512
NOT ANY LONGER.

274
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,080
THE WORKERS WHO POURED THEIR 

275
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,086
SOULS INTO BUILDING THIS GREAT 

276
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,788
NATION WERE BETRAYED, BUT THAT 

277
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,156
BETRAYAL IS OVER.

278
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,590
I'M DELIVERING ON A PROMISE I 

279
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,191
MADE DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND 

280
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,294
I'VE BEEN MAKING IT FOR A GOOD 

281
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:23,396
PART OF MY LIFE.

282
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,766
IF I EVER DID THIS WORKS I NEVER

283
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,033
THOUGHT I WOULD, I SAID LET'S 

284
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,969
RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND LOOK WHAT 

285
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,705
HAPPENED.

286
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,472
AND PART OF THE REASON IT HAND 

287
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,141
IS YOU, AND MY MESSAGE HAVING TO

288
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,544
DO WITH YOU, AND OTHER MESSAGES 

289
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,746
ALSO, SECURITY, MILITARY, THE 

290
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,548
WALL, THE BORDER, A LOT OF GOOD 

291
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:42,882
MESSAGES.

292
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,085
BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST 

293
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,352
IMPORTANT.

294
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,922
MY MOST IMPORTANT JOB IS TO KEEP

295
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,025
AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE.

296
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,693
AND PEOPLE AS YOU KNOW, WE JUST 

297
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,296
HAD APPROVED A $700 BILLION 

298
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,365
MILITARY BUDGET, THE LARGEST 

299
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,201
EVER, $716 BILLION NEXT YEAR.

300
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,570
THAT MEANS NOT ONLY SAFETY, BUT 

301
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:04,903
IT MEANS JOBS.

302
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,139
IT ALSO MEANS THE USE OF STEEL 

303
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,475
FROM OUR COUNTRY.

304
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,611
BUT IF THE SAME GOALS CAN BE 

305
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,846
ACCOMPLISHED BY OTHER MEANS, 

306
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,315
AMERICA WILL REMAIN OPEN TO 

307
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,584
MODIFYING OR REMOVING THE 

308
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,918
TARIFFS FOR INDIVIDUAL NATIONS 

309
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:22,421
AS LONG AS WE CAN AGREE ON A WAY

310
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,923
TO ENSURE THEIR PRODUCTS NO 

311
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:28,561
LONGER THREATEN OUR SECURITY.

312
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:34,633
SO I'VE PUT AMBASSADOR WHITE 

313
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,935
HISER IN CHARGE NEGOTIATING WITH

314
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,236
COUNTRIES THAT SEEK AN 

315
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,171
ALTERNATIVE TO THE STEEL AND 

316
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,005
ALUMINUM TARIFFS.

317
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:45,210
THE FACT IS WE'VE BEEN TREATED 

318
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,913
SO BALDLY OVER THE YEARS BY OTHR

319
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:48,180
COUNTRIES.

320
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,083
WE'VE BEEN TREATED VERY BADLY BY

321
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,518
OUR POLITICIANS, BY OUR 

322
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,152
PRESIDENTS, PEOPLE THAT 

323
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,286
REPRESENTED US THAT DIDN'T, 

324
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:54,887
FRANKLY, KNOW WHAT THEY WERE 

325
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,624
DOING.

326
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,959
AND WE LOSE $800 BILLION A YEAR 

327
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,329
ON TRADE.

328
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,599
EVERY YEAR, $800 BILLION.

329
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,367
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG 

330
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,335
TIME, $300 BILLION, 

331
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,170
$400 BILLION, $500 BILLION, GOT 

332
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,641
UP TO $600 BILLION.

333
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,644
AND IT KEEPS GOING, BUT IT'S 

334
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,278
GOING TO START CHANGING, HAS TO 

335
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,446
CHANGE.

336
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,414
WE'RE NEGOTIATING NOW WITH 

337
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:22,614
CHINA.

338
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:25,017
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A BIG 

339
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:25,350
NEGOTIATION.

340
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,051
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYTHING'S 

341
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:27,353
GOING TO COME OF IT.

342
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,587
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL, 

343
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,688
PRESIDENT XI, I FORGET GREAT 

344
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,158
RESPECT FOR, A LOT OF RESPECT.

345
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,026
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYTHING'S

346
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,795
GOING TO COME OF THAT, BUT WE'RE

347
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,531
GOING TO CUT DOWN THE DEFICITS 

348
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,165
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

349
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:45,104
WE HAVE A DEFICIT WITH CHINA OF 

350
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:51,911
AT LEAST $500 BILLION, AND WHEN 

351
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:56,215
YOU ADDENT -- OUR RELATIONSHIP  

352
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:01,220
CANADA AND MEXICO, WE'RE 

353
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,787
NEGOTIATING RIGHT NOW NAFTA.

354
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,088
AND WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OFF THE 

355
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,223
TARIFF ON THOSE TWO COUNTRIES TO

356
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,460
SEE IF WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE THE 

357
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,695
DEAL ON NAFTA.

358
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,398
NATIONAL SECURITY IS AN 

359
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,532
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT DEAL.

360
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,334
THIS WILL FIGURE INTO THE DEAL 

361
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,503
AND WE WON'T HAVE THE TARIFFS ON

362
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,738
CANADA OR MEXICO F. WE DON'T 

363
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:29,415
MAKE THE DEAL ON NAFTA AND IF WE

364
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,115
TEMPE

365
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:35,220
TERMINATE THE DEAL WITH NAFTA, 

366
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,323
AND WE'LL START ALL OVER AGAIN 

367
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,791
OR WE'LL JUST DO IT A DIFFERENT 

368
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,593
WAY.

369
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,294
BUT WE'LL TERMINATE NAFTA, AND 

370
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,195
THAT'LL BE IT.

371
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,564
BUT I HAVE A FEELING WE'RE GOING

372
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,098
TO MAKE A DEAL WITH NAFTA.

373
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:46,999
I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR A LONG 

374
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,333
TIME.

375
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,168
WE EITHER MAKE A DEAL OR WE 

376
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:49,468
TERMINATE.

377
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,670
IF WE DO, THERE WON'T BE ANY 

378
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,640
TARIFFS ON CANADA AND THERE 

379
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,908
WON'T BE ANY TARIFFS ON MEXICO.

380
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,042
ONE OTHER THING.

381
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,777
SOME OF THE COUNTRIES THAT WE'RE

382
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,781
DEALING WITH ARE GREAT PARTNERS,

383
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,849
GREAT MILITARY ALLIES.

384
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,083
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

385
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,552
THAT VERY STRONGLY.

386
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,887
THE TARIFFS DON'T GO EFFECTIVE 

387
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,823
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 15 DAYS.

388
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,791
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHO'S 

389
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,026
TREATING US FAIRLY, WHO'S NOT 

390
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,561
TREATING US FAIRLY.

391
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,964
PART OF THAT'S GOING TO BE 

392
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,331
MILITARY.

393
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,534
WHO'S PAYING THE BILLS, WHO'S 

394
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:23,969
NOT PAYING THE BILLS.

395
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,939
WE SUBSIDIZE MANY RICH 

396
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:27,640
COUNTRIES.

397
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,510
IN SOME CASES THEY DON'T PAY 50 

398
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,511
CENTS ON THE DOLLAR, AND WE HAVE

399
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,080
TO STOP THAT.

400
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,183
AND THAT WILL ENTER INTO THE 

401
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:38,951
EQUATION AS WELL.

402
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,419
I SAW A TWEET THAT JUST CAME IN 

403
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:45,124
FROM ELON MUSK WHO'S USING OUR 

404
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,160
WONDERFUL SPACE FACILITIES AND 

405
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,462
DID A GREAT JOB THREE WEEKS AGO.

406
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,097
HE SAID, FOR EXAMPLE, AN 

407
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:57,569
AMERICAN CAR GOING TO CHINA PAYS

408
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:58,570
25% IMPORT DUTY.

409
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,474
BUT A CHINESE CAR COMING TO THE 

410
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:07,680
UNITED STATES ONLY PAYS 2.5%, A 

411
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,113
TEN-FOLD DIFFERENCE.

412
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,749
AN AMERICAN CAR GOING TO CHINA, 

413
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,320
THINK OF THAT, PAYS 25% IMPORT 

414
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,553
DUTY.

415
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,489
SO WE SEND OUR CAR OVER THERE, 

416
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,590
PAY 25%.

417
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,995
THEY SEND THEIR CAR OVER HERE, 

418
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:23,295
2.5%.

419
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,197
THAT'S FROM ELON, BUT EVERYBODY 

420
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:25,965
KNOWS IT.

421
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,733
THEY'VE KNOWN IT FOR YEARS AND 

422
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,300
NEVER DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

423
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,769
IT'S GOT TO CHANGE.

424
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,704
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A 

425
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,606
RECIPROCAL TAX PROGRAM AT SOME 

426
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,275
POINT SO THAT IF CHINA'S GOING 

427
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,877
TO CHARGE US 25% OR IF INDIA IS 

428
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,612
GOING TO CHARGE US 75% AND WE 

429
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:43,081
CHARGE THEM NOTHING, IF THEY'RE 

430
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:46,351
AT 50 OR 75 OR 25, WE'RE GOING 

431
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:47,586
TO BE AT THOSE SAME NUMBERS.

432
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,222
IT'S A MIRROR TAX.

433
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,890
SO THEY CHARGE US 50, WE CHARGE 

434
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,791
THEM 50.

435
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,458
RIGHT NOW THEY'LL CHARGE US 50, 

436
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,760
WE CHARGE THEM NOTHING.

437
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,129
DOESN'T WORK.

438
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,799
SO THAT'S CALLED A RECIPROCAL 

439
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,734
TAX, A MIRROR TAX, AND WE'RE 

440
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,771
GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF THAT.

441
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,706
THE FIRST YEAR WE'VE REALLY SET 

442
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,273
THE STAGE.

443
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:12,044
A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH -- 

444
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:12,978
STRUCTURALLY WE HAD TO GO 

445
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,647
THROUGH CERTAIN PROCEDURES IN 

446
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,583
ORDER TO GET TO THIS POINT BUT 

447
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,752
NOW WE'RE AT THIS POINT.

448
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,120
AMERICAN COMPANIES HAVE NOT BEEN

449
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,654
TREATED FAIRLY.

450
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:23,922
AND SOME AMERICAN COMPANIES, 

451
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:24,823
FRANKLY, HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

452
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,658
IT AND GONE TO OTHER COUNTRIES 

453
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:30,562
AND DEVELOPED IN MEXICO, MASSIVE

454
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,064
AUTOMOBILE PLANTS, TAKING OUR 

455
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,332
JOBS AWAY AND TAKING OUR 

456
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:35,968
COMPANIES DOWN TO MEXICO TO MAKE

457
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:36,869
THE CARS.

458
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,871
AND THEN THEY SEND THEM RIGHT 

459
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:40,505
ACROSS THE BORDER WITHOUT TAX, 

460
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:42,875
WITHOUT ANYTHING.

461
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,377
SO WE LOSE THE JOBS, THEY MAKE 

462
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,579
THE CARS, THEY GET ALL THE 

463
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,047
BENEFITS, THEN THEY SELL THE 

464
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,983
CARS BACK INTO THE UNITED 

465
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,216
STATES.

466
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,352
SO WE'RE CHANGING THINGS AND WE 

467
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:55,754
HAVE A LOT OF GREAT 

468
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:56,087
RELATIONSHIPS.

469
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,756
I THINK COMPANIES ARE GOING TO 

470
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,125
BE VERY HAPPY IN THE END.

471
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:00,993
I THINK THAT COUNTRIES ARE GOING

472
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,995
TO BE VERY HAPPY.

473
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,632
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW GREAT 

474
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:06,932
FLEXIBILITY.

475
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,900
AND, AGAIN, MANY OF THE 

476
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,835
COUNTRIES THAT TREAT US THE 

477
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,469
WORST ON TRADE AND ON MILITARY 

478
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:15,406
ARE OUR ALLIES, AS THEY LIKE TO 

479
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,475
CALL THEM.

480
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,477
SO WE JUST WANT FAIRNESS.

481
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,645
WE JUST WANT FAIRNESS.

482
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:24,850
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 

483
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,884
RECIPROCAL, AND I THINK IN THE 

484
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,186
END WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF

485
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,889
GREAT JOBS, WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF 

486
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,724
GREAT COMPANIES ALL COMING BACK 

487
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:34,560
INTO OUR COUNTRY.

488
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,695
YOU SEE IT THE OTHER DAY 

489
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:37,863
CHRYSLER ANNOUNCED THEY'RE 

490
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,633
LEAVING MEXICO AND CAMOMING BAC 

491
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,402
TO MEXICO WITH A BIG PLANT.

492
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,671
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN A LONG 

493
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:45,971
TIME.

494
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,272
BECAUSE I SORT OF GREW UP WITH 

495
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,941
THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE, I KNOW A 

496
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,743
LOT ABOUT THE STEEL INDUSTRY AND

497
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,078
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE ALUMINUM 

498
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:53,378
INDUSTRY.

499
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:54,813
WE'LL BRING THEM BACK.

500
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,914
I THOUGHT MAYBE A FEW OF YOU 

501
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,416
WOULD LIKE TO SAY A COUPLE 

502
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:58,951
WORDS.

503
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,019
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT 25 MILLION 

504
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,587
PEOPLE WATCHING, SO DON'T WORRY 

505
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:02,921
ABOUT IT.

506
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:03,889
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING?

507
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:04,189
COME ON UP.

508
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,358
HOW ARE YOU?

509
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,560
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, PRESIDENT 

510
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,729
TRUMP ANNOUNCING AFTER YEARS OF 

511
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,262
AMERICAN WORKERS BEING BETRAYED 

512
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,832
BY THE DUMPING OF FOREIGN STEEL 

513
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,500
HERE CALLING AN ECONOMIC AND 

514
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,467
NATIONAL SECURITY DISASTER, HE 

515
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:19,938
IS NOW IMPOSING 25% TARIFF ON 

516
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,842
IMPORTED STEEL, 10% TARIFF ON 

517
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,242
IMPORTED ALUMINUM.

518
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,978
I WANT TO GO TO JOHN CARL.

519
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,045
ONE OF THE POINTS THE PRESIDENT 

520
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,781
MADE IS HE'S KEEPING A CAMPAIGN 

521
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:30,382
PROMISE, THAT IS TRUE.

522
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,950
HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR

523
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,484
A LONG TIME.

524
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,987
BUT THE PROCESS OF GETTING THERE

525
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,855
INSIDE THIS WHITE HOUSE SOMEWHAT

526
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:37,122
CHAOTIC. 

527
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:41,560
>> HE'S BEEN ENTIRELY CONSISTENT

528
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,461
ON THE ISSUE OF TRADE AND 

529
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,229
TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO FIGHT 

530
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,464
WHAT HE CALLS UNFAIR TRADE.

531
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,498
BUT THE PROCESS INSIDE THE WHITE

532
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,867
HOUSE, GEORGE, HAS BEEN ANYTHING

533
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,668
BUT CONSISTENT.

534
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,738
THEY'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE MAP.

535
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,372
WE WERE GIVEN SOME GUIDANCE 

536
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,241
EARLIER SUGGESTING THIS WAS NOT 

537
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,943
HAPPENING TODAY, AND SUDDENLY IT

538
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,945
WAS ON THE SCHEDULE, IT IS 

539
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:00,479
HAPPENING.

540
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,547
WE WERE TOLD IT WAS GOING TO BE 

541
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,281
ACROSS THE BOARD ON EVERY 

542
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:02,814
COUNTRY.

543
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:06,852
NOW YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT 

544
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,452
TALKING ABOUT EXEMPTIONS, AT 

545
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,653
LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM FOR 

546
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,422
CANADA AND MEXICO.

547
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,023
BUT THIS WAS A HIGHLY 

548
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:12,690
CONTROVERSIAL DECISION WITHIN 

549
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,459
THE WHITE HOUSE AND WITHIN THE 

550
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:14,859
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

551
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:15,493
>> THE PRESIDENT GETTING A LOT 

552
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:16,728
OF PUSHBACK FROM THE SPEAKER OF 

553
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,697
THE HOUSE, PAUL RYAN, AND A 

554
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,932
MAJORITY OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS. 

555
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,300
>> IN FACT, JUST A FEW MINUTES 

556
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,235
AGO RYAN ACTUALLY SAID THAT HE 

557
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:24,869
IS STILL TRYING TO GET THE 

558
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:27,906
PRESIDENT TO CHANGE HIS MIND ON 

559
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:28,106
THIS. 

560
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,909
>> MEANTIME, REBECCA JARVIS IS 

561
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,810
HERE.

562
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,744
THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE POINT 

563
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:33,411
THAT HE THINKS THIS IS GOING TO 

564
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,880
BRING BACK JOBS, MOST ECONOMISTS

565
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,617
SAY IT WILL COST MORE JOBS 

566
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,284
BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON THOSE 

567
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,519
WHO CONSUME STEEL AND ALUMINUM. 

568
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,755
>> ALMOST ALL ECONOMISTS BELIEVE

569
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,524
THIS, GEORGE.

570
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,191
33,000 STEEL AND ALUMINUM JOBS 

571
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,928
GAINED HERE, BUT 179,000 

572
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,129
MANUFACTURING JOBS POTENTIALLY 

573
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,364
LOST TO THESE TARIFFS.

574
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,498
AND THE REASON IS THAT BY 

575
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:55,166
INCREASING THESE TARIFFS, THAT 

576
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,601
INCREASES THE COST OF DOING 

577
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,036
BUSINESS FOR ANY COMPANY THAT 

578
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,905
DEALS IN STEEL AND ALUMINUM.

579
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,909
IMAGINE CAR COMPANIES, HOME 

580
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,310
BUILDERS THAT USE PRODUCTS TO 

581
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,278
BUILD HOMES.

582
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,512
THOSE PRODUCTS GET MORE 

583
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,247
EXPENSIVE FOR THE COMPANIES TO 

584
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:10,115
CREATE AND CAN ULTIMATELY DRIVE 

585
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,517
UP COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. 

586
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,118
>> WHEN THIS FIRST CAME OUT LAST

587
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,389
WEEK, THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TOOK

588
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:17,889
A DEEP DIVE ON FRIDAY. 

589
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:18,556
>> THEY HAVE STABILIZED, AND ONE

590
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:20,225
OF THE FEARS IS THE RETALIATION.

591
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,760
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN AS IT GOES 

592
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,694
AROUND THE WORLD?

593
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,163
WE'VE HEARD FROM CHINA, THE 

594
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:27,232
EUROPEAN UNION, THAT THEY WOULD 

595
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,501
RETALIATE IF WE HIKED THOSE 

596
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,802
TARIFFS ON THEIR PRODUCTS.

597
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:34,239
IN PARTICULAR, HOW SPEAKER RYAN 

598
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,810
WILL IN HIS HOME STATE, HARLEY 

599
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,845

00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:45,450
THE EU, BOURBON, BLUE JEANS AND 

601
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:45,783
MOTORCYCLES. 

602
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:48,853
>> SECRETARY TRADE REP NOT 

603
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:50,622
THERE.

604
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,890
GARY COHN HAS ANNOUNCED HE'S 

605
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,191
LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. 

606
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,093
>> HE WAS OPPOSED TO THESE 

607
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,762
TARIFFS, FOUGHT THEM THROUGHOUT 

608
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:59,164

AND HE WARNED THE PRESIDENT IT 

611
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,334
WAS NOT JUST BAD POLICY, BUT 

612
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,802
THIS WOULD HAVE BAD 

613
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,870
REPERCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE 

614
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,304
