1
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:29,600
“Mom and Dad moved
from the farm in 1985."

2
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,230
“It has been empty since then.

3
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,810
Yeah.

4
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,950
That’s a long time.

5
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,450
If they had sold the farm and
we went back and drove by it,

6
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,710
I don’t know how I’d feel.

7
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,630
There would still be
a sense of possession

8
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,180
because it was
part of your life.

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,460
Not that you would own
it, but you would still

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,334
feel that it shaped you."

11
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:06,900
“It would be really
hard to give up.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,690
Very, very hard.

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,880
One of the favorite
places is the front step,

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,010
sitting there talking
to Mom and Dad.

15
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,580
Talking to my sister, talking
to friends, pet the cat.

16
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,770
Yeah.

17
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,718
That’s one of my
favorite places I think.

18
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:32,160
Mom’s ashes — we
sprinkled some ashes

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,550
there because of
all the chats."

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,830
“I think Dad was one of
those lucky people who

21
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:48,110
was born in a place he
really was happy to be.

22
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,080
And I don’t know if
everybody gets that in life.

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,040
He loved prairies.

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,190
He loved the farm.

25
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,470
As he got older, I
think he recognized

26
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,210
he really loved us a lot too.

27
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,070
The farm was very important.

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,020
It was very important to him.

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,700
We were important, but I think
he just kind of relied on Mom

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,625
to deal with raising us."

31
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,190
“I think he thought
he had to be stern.

32
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,872
And as he aged, he learned
that didn’t have to be so."

33
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:37,150
“After Mom died I went to
the post office in town.

34
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,600
And the gal who
works there said,

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,310
‘I’m so sorry about your mom.’

36
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,220
She said, ‘When I first
moved to this town

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,850
your mom was one of the
first people who spoke to me

38
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,650
and made me feel welcome.’

39
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,710
Then she said, ‘Your
mom was so direct.’

40
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,210
Yeah.

41
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,250
My heart was
breaking at the time,

42
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,320
but I kept thinking
don’t forget that word.

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,612
Direct, direct, direct.

44
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:05,160
[laughter]

45
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,740
“Mom WAS so direct! And
it was one of the most

46
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,804
delightful things about her."

47
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,100
“I could ramble on
about them, but that

48
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,688
summarizes some of it.

49
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,200
In my mind I always thought,
maybe we would go back.

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,251
But when you’re
younger you always

51
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:32,500
think you could do everything.

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,520
You really could
do everything.

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,978
You could live in Europe for
a while and have a house here.

54
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,180
Time doesn’t work
out that way."

55
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,060
“And a 16-hour drive
is a long ways to go.

56
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,540
Doesn’t fit in the same
way that it used to."

57
00:03:56,665 --> 00:04:03,600
“I miss the solitude,
being able to see the sky.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,520
I miss the weather.

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,060
Not that it’s all good, but
when you live with no wind

60
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,800
you miss it."

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,387
“The sound of the
cows calling."

62
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,760
“I miss friends.

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,339
Lots of laughter.

64
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,230
When it was really cold
the telephone wires —

65
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,310
they sang.

66
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,390
It was a beautiful
resonant sound.

67
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,320
And there was that
long-distance sound of a car

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,790
way far away and then it
coming closer, and closer,

69
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,560
and closer, and closer.

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,900
And then, whoosh.

71
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,950
And then that disappear.

72
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,560
And on a long
weekend Mom would

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,480
be like, ‘Oh, the traffic.

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,345
Oh, the traffic.’"

75
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:53,440
“Mom said sell it.

76
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,790
I remember her saying that.

77
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,840
Get it cleaned up.

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
That was the way she operated.

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,190
And Dad’s was a
little more veiled

80
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,330
in that he said, ‘They’re
not making any more land.’

81
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,256
And you kind of drew
from that maybe you

82
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,380
should keep it for a while.

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,260
Our wild and crazy hope is
that somebody from the family

84
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,611
said I’d like to go and
live in Saskatchewan."

85
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,260
“I think for a
long time you’re

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,320
comfortable not
thinking about it,

87
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,460
and then you start to realize
that you will have to make

88
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,536
decisions about things —

89
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:39,500
about possessions,
about objects.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,660
But there’s a certain
amount of excitement

91
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,273
about the concept
of saving something.

92
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:55,560
When you go there there’s this
sense of situational bearing

93
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,920
that always feels stable.

94
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,990
The sky looks the
same and the land

95
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,280
looks the same because
the contours don’t change.

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,730
But everything’s
a little rougher.

97
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,870
Everything’s a little worn.

98
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,460
Certain things
are disappearing.

99
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,410
When we go home we
go to the cemetery.

100
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,100
You just walk around
and you remember people.

101
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,800
It’s a comfort.

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,590
And sometimes when I’m
here walking with the dog,

103
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,560
and the moon is
out here, I think

104
00:06:35,560 --> 00:00:00,000
it’s shining on them too."
