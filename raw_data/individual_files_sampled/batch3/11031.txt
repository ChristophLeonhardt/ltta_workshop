the situation around Syria was one of the issues the Russian Foreign Minister addressed during a media conference after the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York that Russ was Kelly mobin during the press conference we heard a lot from the Russian Foreign Minister he made wide-ranging comments about different parts of the world now I had the opportunity to ask the Foreign Minister a question I asked him about the fact that right now the USA says that its forces in Syria which are there without the permission of the Syrian government it says that they're only there to ensure the defeat of the ISIS terrorists but at this point now they're saying that with - it draw them would strengthen the Syrian government the internationally recognized legitimate government of Syria so I asked Sergey Lavrov about this kind of mixed message coming from us leaders and what it's like and he gave me this response yet so stupid incidentally the lack of a fundamental commitment to our agreements is typical of current US diplomacy including the reasons why the Americans stay in Syria Rex Tillerson repeatedly stated that their only goal in Syria was the defeat of ISIL now they've got far more ambitious plans another topic that came up during the press conference was the jcpoa that was pointed out that the situation in the negotiations of North Korea could be affected if the USA is to withdraw from the Iran deal now Lavrov was directly asked about the the fact that that Trump and others have questioned and talked about holding the USA out of the Iran deal this is what he had to say about the jcpoa chillest the joint comprehensive plan of action was centered on Iran stopping its military nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of anti Iran sanctions a similar deal is now being tabled for North Korea but if the Iran deal is seen to mean nothing how can we expect the DPRK to prove a similar deal that could be retracted any moment it seemed one of the overall themes of Lavrov remarks was Russian Russia's efforts to stabilize the world and reduce the level of terrorism and instability around the world in different regions he voiced some criticism of US leaders and some frustrations but over all the theme was an effort to kind of get along with countries around the world and create stability in parts of the world that have been unstable and plagued by terrorism violence and extremism
