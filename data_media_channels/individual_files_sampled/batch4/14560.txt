I care about this because this is being normalized this is on now this is how it is now not just in banana republics and I wouldn't quite call Brazil open and then a banana republic though its last presidents seemed intent on making it that but everywhere assassinations and they tend to have one thing in common they're against conservatives pin for town I suppose he wasn't even conservative by any measure in fact he was a flamboyant gay man in Holland but he was murdered for criticizing Islam and not a month goes by when he revealed errs doesn't have a murder plot against him also in Holland but you don't have to look over season you don't have to look for murder you can look for attempted murder here's Steve Scalise a Republican congressman who was targeted because he was a Republican he was shot by a left-wing activist named James Hodgkinson here he is on a walker returning to Congress a conservative Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was attacked so badly he was sent to hospital for days Donald Trump jr. Ivanka Trump Jared Kushner all of Donald Trump's family they all declined Secret Service protection they all said no no I don't need it I'm used to being famous and rich and I don't can take care of myself but the Secret Service insists because there have been so many threats of violence against them not just planned plots but opportunistic violence people who just encounter them on the street in a restaurant on an airplane or as leftist Democrat Maxine Waters put it even at a gas station a hundred people here that maybe no one does anything a thousand people here that what if a million people here that is one in a million gonna actually kill someone hey let me put it another way imagine if your Republican told grassroots supporters to physically get right in the face of citizens it would be shocking but it was pretty cool when cool Obama said remember this I want you to argue with them and get in their face get in their face said how Canadians talk it's a no Americans talk you get right in your neighbors face how you do it Richard Spencer who is a racist was punched in the face on the street by a leftist activist and there is his eardrum broke instead of being condemned it became a new thing it became a meme a slogan a standing order Hollywood loved emember this monster submits the hypocrisy and the casual violence of certain individuals and institutions we will as per Chief Jim hopper punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy oh they all cheered a punch some people in the face some people who Nazis I think Richard Spencer would probably deny he's a Nazi but that's the thing we're told that anyone everyone is far-right these days if they're not far left so that means punch anyone in the face if you simply don't like them call them a Nazi afterwards to give yourself an excuse here's senator Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao who just happens to be a visible minority they're just walking down the street being shouted at hounded no violence here but if that happens a hundred times will it happen one time with a knife well scenario style that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra lavance show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
