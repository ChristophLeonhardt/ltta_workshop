1
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:14,291
ROB: ONE STEP CLOSER TO SETTING

2
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:18,328
THE STAGE FOR THE MIDTERM

3
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:18,695
ELECTIONS.

4
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:22,499
MAJOR VICTORIES FOR BOTH PARTIES

5
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:25,468
AND CANDIDATES FOR NOVEMBER, AND

6
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:27,504
FORMER POLLSTER FOR THE

7
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:31,408
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, CHRIS

8
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:32,107
WILSON, STARTING WITH INDIANA.

9
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:34,911
AND HOW MUCH MONEY MATTERS.

10
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:40,984
IT SEEMS LIKE INDIANA MONEY

11
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:41,418
MATTERS TO DO.

12
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:44,721
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BROAD

13
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:47,123
VIEW REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT TO BE

14
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:49,092
EXCITED ABOUT HIM COMING OUT OF

15
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,962
THE SENATORIAL COMMITTEE, THEY

16
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:52,462
HAD A GREAT NIGHT.

17
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:57,400
PRETTY MUCH IN EVERY RACE.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,205
A CONSERVATIVE BUSINESSMAN,

19
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:02,839
CONSENSUAL THE SUCCESSFUL

20
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:03,540
BACKGROUND, AND A MAINSTREAM

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,075
CANDIDATE AT THE SAME TIME.

22
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:11,481
HE IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL

23
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:15,986
POLITICIAN, JOE DONNELLY IS

24
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:16,686
VULNERABLE, MORE PEOPLE WENT

25
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:17,387
HIM, MORE DESERVE REELECTION

26
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:21,258
THEN DOES.

27
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:21,992
WHEN YOU LOOK AT TURNOUT, MOST

28
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:23,927
REPUBLICANS OVER 2014, THE LAST

29
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:27,764
MIDTERM ELECTION, TURNOUT HAS

30
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:30,200
BEEN DOWN, MORE THAN IT WAS FOR

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,567
DEMOCRATS.

32
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:35,171
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE RESULTING

33
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:35,505
INDIANA.

34
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:36,239
ROB: THE RICH BUSINESSMAN TREND

35
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,440
CONTINUES.

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,677
A CHANCE OF DEFEATING DONNELLY,

37
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:41,378
SENATE SEAT REPUBLICANS WANT.

38
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:45,282
>> BRON GIVES REPUBLICANS THE

39
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:45,949
LAST CHANCE, IT IS A TOSSUP.

40
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:53,123
IF NOT, A LITTLE BIT OF A SLIDE

41
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:53,823
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS TRENDING

42
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:54,357
NATURE OF THE STATE.

43
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:54,991
ROB: I WAS THERE IN OHIO

44
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,459
SPEAKING WITH VOTERS, THE

45
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:56,993
RESULTS NO SURPRISE.

46
00:01:56,993 --> 00:02:03,066
RENACCI.

47
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:10,840
>> REPUBLICANS GOT WHAT THEY

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,174
WANTED.

49
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:11,808
REPUBLICANS LED IN EVERY

50
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:12,475
STATEWIDE RACE IN TURN OUT.

51
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:16,613
I KEEP GOING BACK TO THAT SECOND

52
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:17,314
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO

53
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:17,981
MAKE THE CLAIM WE HAVE THE

54
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:19,783
ENTHUSIASM ON OUR SIDE AND LAST

55
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:22,952
NIGHT SAW THAT TREND REVERSED.

56
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:26,423
OHIO IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE.

57
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:27,123
THE SOLID BACKGROUND, ONE OF

58
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:29,693
THESE SITUATIONS WHEN YOU LOOK

59
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:35,565
AT RECENT POLLING, INCUMBENT

60
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:36,299
SENATORS SAID MORE PEOPLE -- IT

61
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:38,468
IS AT BEST A TOSSUP.

62
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:39,102
REPUBLICANS PICK THIS UP.

63
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:43,773
ROB: REPUBLICANS LOVE HIM BUT

64
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:44,507
MANCHIN COULD BE A REPUBLICAN IN

65
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:44,974
ANY OTHER STATE.

66
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:49,079
DOES HE HAVE A CHANCE OF BEATING

67
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,412
MANCHIN?

68
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:54,284
>> MANCHIN IS IN WEST VIRGINIA

69
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:54,751
BUT IT IS EARLY.

70
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:55,251
ROB: I APOLOGIZE.

71
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:58,555
DOES HE HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING

72
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:01,925
THE SENATE?

73
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:02,325
>> HE DOES.

74
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:06,429
IT HAS GOT TO BE A TOSSUP

75
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:12,335
BECAUSE OHIO IS MUCH LIKE

76
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:13,036
INDIANA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

77
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:16,106
TURNOUT GAPS REPUBLICANS LED IN

78
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:16,806
EVERY STATEWIDE RACE IN TURN

79
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:17,073
OUT.

80
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:17,807
THAT A HUGE FAN FOR DEMOCRATS

81
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:22,812
THAT THEY ARE IN TROUBLE.

82
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:27,584
>> I WAS SO EAGER TO GET TO WEST

83
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:27,951
VIRGINIA.

84
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:28,651
SEEMS LIKE PATRICK MORRISSEY

85
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:29,085
JUST SURVIVED.

86
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:29,753
OF AN DRAGONTEMPLATE, DON

87
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:35,258
BLANKENSHIP HAD A LEAD BUT

88
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:35,959
MORRISSEY JUST SURVIVED THIS

89
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:36,259
THING.

90
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:42,031
>> I WOULD DISPUTE THAT BECAUSE

91
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:42,665
I KNOW PATRICK MORRISSEY.

92
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,266
HE IS AN INDEFATIGABLE

93
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:43,666
CAMPAIGNER.

94
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,401
I NEVER MET SOMEONE WHO WORKED

95
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,735
AS HARD.

96
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:46,269
HE CAME FROM BEHIND.

97
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,507
BLANKENSHIP HAD TO LEAD, HE GOT

98
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:53,376
IN FRONT, THE PRES. GOT

99
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:58,948
INVOLVED, AND HIS SON TWEETED

100
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:04,988
OUT, LET'S GET BEHIND, JENKINS,

101
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:05,722
AN INTERESTING STRATEGY WITH THE

102
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:06,423
DEMOCRATS, THEY TRIED TO BEAT

103
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:07,190
JENKINS, THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN

104
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,725
DRIVING JENKINS'S NUMBERS DOWN

105
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:15,298
BUT HE IS THE ONE CANDIDATE WHO

106
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,031
CAN BEAT MANCHIN WHO IS IN REAL

107
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:16,366
TROUBLE.

108
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:17,100
HIS OPPONENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC

109
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,173
PRIMARY 14-1, GOT A LITTLE MORE

110
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:23,740
THAN 65% OF THE VOTE.

111
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,441
A HUGE HARBINGER THAT HE HAS

112
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,175
REAL CHALLENGES NOT ONLY WITH AS

113
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:25,942
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER COULD BE A

114
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:30,980
REPUBLICAN, THAT DOESN'T GET HIS

115
00:04:30,980 --> 00:00:00,000
BASE EXCITED AND REPUBLICANS GO
