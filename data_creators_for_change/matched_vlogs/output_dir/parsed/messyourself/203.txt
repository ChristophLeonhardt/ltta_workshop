more reacting to sad animations now in
my last sad animations video I didn't
cry okay so I have found some even
sadder ones in the hopes that I share
did and cry alright the first animation
we're gonna be reacting to is called the
bad egg alright now all I know is that
this is kind of scary but also kind of
sad ok let us watch it or I all I know
from this animation that was made five
years
Oh your dolls can be scary but we're not
mine we're not doing scary we're doing
sad okay we've got a little bug and
another bug okay check one taxi okay
where is this going oh no he looks evil
Oh
sharing his food with his brother Oh his
buddy worm out of his mouth
oh no and how he wants more oh the poor
the poor didn't get any worms oh shit Oh
No oh he's angry what he's imagining
what it's gonna be like sharing the
worms with it with the three buds oh
he's like oh no no no
gunshot no who's shooting got a shoo-in
what's going on the mother's back oh no
the mothers gonna flip out the mother's
children just died cuz this blood killed
it the couple look how cold it is he
spent all this time trying to get these
worms
oh she sees the missing kids she's like
don't tell me she's gonna get do not
tell me she's gonna get no no the Hawks
earth provides enough to satisfy every
man's need but not every man's greed
Mahatma Gandhi Oh snagged the bud was so
greedy that it killed it his brothers
and sisters and that his mom died so now
how is it gonna fit for itself that's
that's it good that was a good animation
man good message good why do you kill
the baby family also the next animation
we're gonna watch is the pitbulls doll
animation now this video has like nearly
30 million views okay I heard it makes
you cry okay so this one's gonna be very
hard for us let's see if we can not cry
all right we first start off as a
picture of a little kitty what's good
what's going on there oh no his mom died
oh this is always sad to be us petit
Chou oh no it's French
oh no what okay you've got me intrigued
oh good music oh there's a picture of
the bump on up there oh this is this is
sad okay is it gonna show like what it's
like living without mom oh man it must
be so hard living without a mom jeez
okay so I'm scared where this is going
because oh okay this is gonna turn sad
eventually and I'm scared
when's it gonna turn sad I'm actually
scared he's like yes yes shut up Susan
okay just eat your food
oh it's a bunch of kids Oh dad sad oh
the children try to tear or mom you
stupid kids try scary
I'll get you wait why is she coughing
at least the kids are okay but I think
the dad is struggling that time so we
and one day and once upon a time there
was three cats the end what a great
story sad he's missing his wife and the
kids
realizing that - it's not the same
without mummy it's not the same man the
fact that cats just makes it even more
sad
oh no why is she coughing no don't cover
this bloody girl's gonna die if she dies
the doctors here
okay okay I'm sure we'll be fine
everyone stay calm she's probably just
got the pussy cat flu okay okay oh what
Oh what
why is she clucking um doctor cat to me
straight
it's not good man she's got the cracking
flu the crackin flu I don't know what
that is but that makes me sad
No okay I think she's still in hospital
I don't think it's because she's dead
right
I hope not anyway oh she's trying to
cheer up daddy oh this is so this is so
cute
I really hope that the daughters okay
okay she's still alive but she's she's
under um life support oh no no no no get
a doctor and get a doctor and now get a
doctor and now doctor do something do
something

waiting outside this is sad I don't want
her daughter to die Oh God
why is so sad yeah did he cats what she
has because she coughed on him
she's all alone what did he do is that
it don't know about say it there can't
be it but that was it oh my god okay
what the hell like most of these sad
animations have like a message behind
them but I don't understand why anyone
would make that that was just sad it had
no message or anything it was just a
family where everyone died oh my god
that is so sad alright the next
animation we're gonna be reacting to is
called Aurora okay then now it's won
many awards okay I'm leaving all the
down the description down the stuff down
below blah blah blah okay let's watch it
oh it won the silver world medal for
best student film category the animation
school presents a car driving down the
highway
remember this is meant to be sad so
we've got a dad and a child
okay
and that Charles falling asleep I'm
worried no good why do I do this to
myself why is it so sad okay
there's something about a dad at a child
oh damn look at this high-quality
animation damn
where are we on a boat now
is this happening for real
Oh a child stranded is he gonna go
ghetto
is this
I'm not sure this is this is actually
happening I think he's just imagining it
in his head find your door oh no oh no
she's alive she's alive she's alive
is she alive come on
grab on
go pull away pull away
go
No is she gonna survive Oh No
Savoy come on you could do it you could
do it you could do it you can do it
did she survive is she no don't tell me
she oh is she okay
or is this meant to be heaven it's meant
to be heaven
oh god that's terrible they both they
both died that's so sad
and the and the dad was I guess the dad
jumping out of a ship to save his his
daughter is like the equivalent of him
not wanting to leave her and die alone
and for him to survive Oh God about that
okay that okay first off animation was
very high quality very good and secondly
that was very sad Jesus Christ or the
next animation we're gonna react to is
take me home now I think this is about a
doggy that wants to be taken home let us
watch it
all right take me home with a little
doggie on the side okay we've got a
doggie in a can now I hope this isn't
too sad I hope that bogie gets to a nice
family okay that my money's on that all
right let's just leave as that the dogs
are gonna find a nice home and live
happily ever off okay
ah kennels are so sad I've actually been
to a few kennels and it's actually like
really sad you just want to take all the
dogs home are this girl's going to take
the dog come on see it's such a shame
because you can only take one dog home

rest of dogs haven't got homes but at
least this one is gonna find a new home
that is so cute
we'll just say that wasn't sad oh that
was cute that was heartwarming listen
guys I've got a recommend why not adopt
a like a homeless dog or a cat at
shelter rather than getting like a
kitten or something like that okay you
guys got a give animals a nice new home
okay let's move on to the next one all
right so the next animation is a pretty
short one in just 30 seconds but I
believe it was made as like a commercial
type project there were a bunch of
students I think it was at the VI a
university college okay and let's see if
we can tell what the sort of message is
just in these 30 seconds all right so at
a guy with a cracked face his dad just
hit him
Oh No oh gosh
oh gosh okay I think that Swedish I
can't read that put that okay that was
really short but I guess that kind of
shows you don't know what's going on
behind some people you know they put on
a brave face but deep down they're kind
of broken inside so if you ever feel
like you ever been mistreated you know
you can get some help okay mess
yourselves here okay you guys need to be
happy okay all right this next animation
is called dead friends okay now this is
kind of short too
let's see why is so sad all right so
we've got an old run-down town if
zombies zombie why is that be sad zombie
is why oh what's that oh don't oh oh no
oh no to talk good friends with this guy
and how is it rugby oh no don't tell me

dogs there Oh God okay the dogs eating a
man okay
that's quit i scratching this belly
rubbing the dog
Oh
they can't go
okay
it's just weird okay okay okay all right
maybe that wasn't as sad while actually
I thought the dog was gonna die and then
it was be really sad but no the dogs
happy being a zombie like like its own
okay that was a weird what I'm sorry
about that one alright now the next
animation we're going to be watching is
called the animals life now I believe
this is about animals and stuff okay
