you know folks it's one thing to look a gift horse in the mouth it's another to kick its teeth in I'm referencing the gift from millennia Trump to a twitch of a librarian in Massachusetts who turned down the gift and actually called the gift racist the gifting question was books by dr. Seuss now I could go on but Ezra has already done a fantastic rant about that and I urge you to check it out so I think I'll respond to this story in a very dr. Seuss Ian way in other words rhyming couplets now a gift is a gift and that much is true unless the gift is from a Trump then that gift won't do and if the person who receives the gift is a lefty librarian then that gift will be looked upon like so much carrion from a barbarian oh it's true it's true check out Liz Phipps or Oh when Milania gave her some books Liz screamed oh no the dr. Seuss books Liz said are so terribly racist as for Millenia ugh she's a trump might as well be a rapist apparently The Cat in the Hat seems like a dirty rat on crack just look at that face obviously the caricature of a black so it is that Seussian books are racist in 2017 which was not the case a few years ago so what does it all mean for you see here's librarian Liz herself decked out like a cat what cat you ask why it's the Cat in the Hat what was kosher during Obama's reign is suddenly Haram now regime change in Washington you see has given Liz a cow and so it is that a librarian has morphed into a social justice warrior good heavens she even snubs the first lady can it get any gory ER and who you ask would employ such a hypocritical fool who ayats you of course because Liz works at a public school even though that twit will be globally embarrassed this much is true she'll continue our public sector employment because she's not quite through for in the eyes of librarian Liz these days white is black and up is down that's what she tells herself because she thinks the nation's now ruled by a clown thus it will be revisionist history she'll be preaching behind many a closed class door even though this progressive really should be reading 1984 in the meantime lobotomize Liz will surely herself pin a book to get over this hump how does this title sound for Liz and her idiotic ilk let's all dump on Trump for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies so sorry to cause yet more unintended frenzies hey folks we have a whole new fall lineup of shows that check it out go to the rebel dot media slash shows you
