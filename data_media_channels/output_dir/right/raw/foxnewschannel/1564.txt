31
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:56,884
I THOUGHT WHAT THE SECRETARY

32
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:58,953
LAID OUT WAS EXACTLY THAT, WAS

33
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:00,688

00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:13,334
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT COMES

40
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:13,768
NEXT?

41
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:14,702
THIS IS WHAT COMES NEXT.

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,688
IRAN IS BEING WOULDING WITH

52
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,059
PARTNERS FOR THE POST-U.S.,

53
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:38,392
JFCPOA.

54
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:39,927
HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

55
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,295
LOOKS LIKE EUROPE WANTS TO STAY

56
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:42,797
IN THE DEAL AND IRAN WILL STAY.

57
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,732
ARE YOU MAKING EUROPE MAKE A

58
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:46,834
CHOICE, AND ARE THEY DECIDING

59
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:47,868
IRAN OVER US?

60
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:51,138
>> YOU KNOW THE SILVER LINING OF

61
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,840
THE IRANIAN THREAT WE ALL AGREE

62
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,442
THAT IT'S A THREAT AND WE ALL

63
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:57,245
AGREE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS

64
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:59,614
ITS GOTTEN OFTEN TIMES WORSE

65
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:03,351
SINCE THE JCPOA WAS SIGNED.

66
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:05,086
IRAN'S BEHAVIOR IN THE REGION

67
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:06,921
HAS BECOME WHO ARE UNSTABLE AND

68
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,021
MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH MISSILES

69
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,389
LANDING IN SAUDI ARABIA.

70
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,726
AS WE FAN OUT AND ENGAGE OUR

00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:13,160
PARTNER COUNTRIES AROUND THE

72
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,462
WORLD, AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT,

73
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:15,296
AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE

74
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:17,098
U.S. GOVERNMENT, WE'LL BE MAKING

75
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:17,932
THAT CASE.

76
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:19,433
I THINK WE'LL FIND A LOT OF

77
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:20,401
AGREEMENT AMONG OUR PARTNERS.

78
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,402
BRIAN: NOT YET.

79
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:22,870
THEY'RE REALLY TICKED OFF YOU

80
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,237
LEFT.

81
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,872
ALTHOUGH IT IS HARD FOR ME TO

82
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:26,407
SAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE

83
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,242
STAYED, THAT WE SHOULD HAVE EVER

84
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:29,877
GOTTEN INTO IT IN THE MEANTIME,

85
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,712
IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE SENATE

86
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,314
AND HOUSE DIDN'T HAVE MAJORITIES

87
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:34,515
THAT SUPPORTED IT.

88
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:36,550
SENATOR SCHUMER AND SENATOR BEN

89
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,052
CARDIN DIDN'T SUPPORT IT.

90
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:39,620
FUNDAMENTALLY, HAVE YOU GOTTEN

91
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,921
DEMOCRATS ON BOARD WITH YOUR NEW

92
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,622
TOUGH POLICY?

93
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:43,324
>> LOOK I THINK THAT IS EXACTLY

94
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:45,092
WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN FORGET OR WANT

95
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:47,862
TO FORGET IS THAT THIS IRANIAN

96
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:49,230
NUCLEAR DEAL WAS SUBMITTED TO

97
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,535
CONGRESS AS AN AGREEMENT BECAUSE

98
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,771
TREATY.

99
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:59,206
THAT WAS A BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION

100
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:00,408
TO WEAK TERMS IN IT.

101
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:01,776
I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE

102
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:03,477
WILL BE A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR

103
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:05,246
THIS NEW APPROACH.

104
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:07,214
I THINK PEOPLE OFTEN PLAY

105
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:08,082
POLITICS WITH THIS.

106
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:09,483
PERHAPS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE

107
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,618
OF THE AISLE.

108
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:12,186
BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE

109
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:13,654
SUPPORT AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

110
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:14,455
BRIAN: WE'LL SEE.

111
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:16,957
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, YOU WANT TO

112
00:03:16,957 --> 00:00:00,000
PUT PRESSURE BACK ON THEM, THAT
