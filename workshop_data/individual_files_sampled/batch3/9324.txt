GREG AND JESSE AND KIM GUILFOYLE. WE ARE LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY. IT IS A WEEK FULL OF OUTRAGEOUS AND OVER THE HILL COMMENTS FOR ROSEANNE AND HER SHOW. AND IF IVANKA TRUMP CHOSE TO HAVE THE MOST OBLIVIOUS TWEET. THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL PHOTO OF YOU AND YOUR CHILD. ONE MOTHER TO ANOTHER. DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR DAD'S IMMIGRATION PRACTICE YOU . HE LISTENS TO YOU. PUT ON SOMETHING TIGHT AND LOW CUT AND TELL YOUR AND TELL HIM IT WAS AN OBAMA THING AND SEE HOW IT GOES. Dana: THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THE COMMENTS WERE VILE AND VICIOUS AND SHE RESPONDED SHE CROSSED THE LINE. BUT MICHAEL MOORE CALLED IT A BRILLIANT RANT AND SALLY FIELDS IS SHOWING SUPPORT WITH A VULGAR TWEET OF HER OWN. AND CATHY GRIFFIN GOING AFTER SARAH SANDERS. THE PRESIDENT POINTED TO THE MEDIA SAYING HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND NO BODY ADDRESSES IT. WHERE WAS THE APOLOGY FOR KATHY GRIFFIN GOING ON A PROFANE RANT OF THE PRESIDENT ON THE VIEW AFTER A PHOTO OF HER HOLDING THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD. DON'T CALL FOR ME AND FOR F- SAKE TAKE A COLD READING CLASS AND MAYBE YOU WILL NOT STUMBLE SO MUCH AND THERE IS HEAVY METAL BAND, PUNK BAND. AND THAT WAS DROPPED FROM THE MUSIC FESTIVAL FOR JOKING ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING. THAT AT LEAST THEY WERE COUNTRY FANS. Dana: SO IT'S THURSDAY AND TGIF TOMORROW AND QUITE A WEEK FOR ALL OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS. GREG, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO YOU AND BRING IT BACK TO EARTH. WHAT IS GOING ON? Greg: IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE ON AN OUTRAGE SUPER HIGHWAY AND DRIVEN BY EMOTION THAT CREATES MOMENTS AND PEOPLE SAY THING AND IN THOSE MOMENTS IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SCALPS, RIGHT? AND THEN IF I DON'T LIKE YOUR POLITICS, I WILL GET YOUR SCA L, VICE VERSA AND COMPANIES FIRE PEOPLE AND SUSPEND AND THEY SEE THE PITCHFORKS AMASSING AS A MOB. BUT HERE IS THE THING, YOU KNOW, SAMANTHA BEE APOLOGIZED AND I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD ACCEPT AN APOLOGY EVEN THOUGH NO ONE WILL RETURN THE FAVOR TO ME. Geraldo: I APOLOGIZE. Greg: PEOPLE ARE COMING AFTER YOU AND WAITING FOR YOU TO SLIP UP AT ANY MOMENT AND THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PAID MILLIONS THAT HAVE SPONSORS THAT WAIT FOR US TO SCREW UP SO THEY CAN GO AFTER YOUR ADVERTISERS AND LIVELIHOOD AND CAREER. BUT WE DON'T DO THAT. I WOULD NOT SAY THAT TO SAMANTHA BEE. SHE APOLOGIZED AND THAT IS FINE. BUT I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INDUSTRY OF KNIVES WAITING FOR ALL OF US. WE HAVE TO DO IT BACK TO THEM AND IT WAS A MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. WHY DON'T YOU STOP THAT. YOU MEAN ALL OF US. PEOPLE ARE PAID TO MONITOR FOX NEW AND WAIT FOR TO YOU SAY SOMETHING. Geraldo: MY GOODNESS, GREG, THE C- WORDS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE WORD. IT IS DISGUSTING AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING FOR A PERSON TO SLIP UP. THIS WAS NOT A SLIP UP. IT WAS A ASSAULT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. Greg: YOU ARE SAYING, I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT THE APOLOGY EVEN THOUGH NO ONE WOULD ACCEPT OURS. Dana: I WOULD SAY THE WAY WE ARE ALL RAISED THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. Geraldo: ACCEPT THE APOLOGY. Dana: WHEN ROSEANNE BARR HER TWEET AND APOLOGY AND SAID I WAS ON AMBIEN AND TRIED TO BLAME THAT. THIS WAS SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW IF SAMANTHA BEE INTENDED OR WROTE IN THE SCRIPT THE C- WORD. Geraldo: IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS SCRIPTED. THE CROWD LOVED IT. Dana: IS THAT WHY PEOPLE DO THIS? Geraldo: GREG SUGGESTED BEFORE THE SHOW MAYBE SHE PRE-MEDITATED THIS BECAUSE HER RATINGS WERE LAGGING. I ASKED ABOUT HER RATINGS. TO ME, THIS IS IT A LARGER PROBLEM, AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT IVANKA, I THINK THAT TO ATTACK IVANKA FOR HER FATHER IS UNFAIR. REMEMBER YOUR TENURE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE KIDS. THIS IS NOT A KID. THIS IS A FULLY MATURE WOMAN AND ENTREPRENEUR. Dana: JUST WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. Geraldo: FOR NO PAY AS HER HUSBAND IS. THEY ARE BRILLIANT AND MOST UNDERESTIMATED IN WASHINGTON AND EASY MARKS FOR PEOPLE LIKE SAMANTHA BEE TO BE SNOTTY AND ATTACK AND TRY TO TEAR DOWN. AND I THINK THAT THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTELY PRE-MEDITATED AND I BUY IN GREG'S POINT PARTIALLY IT WAS PRE-MEDITATED BECAUSE OF THE RATINGS AND LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME. AND NUMBER TWO, TO USE THIS VICIOUS. I MEAN THE C WORD. IT IS LIKE ROSEANNE. SOME PLACES YOU JUST CAN'T GO ANYWHERE. WE HAVE EVOLVED PAST THAT. Dana: THERE WERE QUICK DECISIVE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ROSEANNE AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WILL BE FOR SAMANTHA BEE. Jesse: NO, THE MEDIA WILL SAY SHE MOVED ON AND ON TO THE NEXT MARK. COULD BE GREG, WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR IT. Greg: I THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY RIGHT. Jesse: I DON'T THINK THE CWORDS EQUIVALENT TO THE N WORD. NOT TO SAY IT IS NOT BAD. BUT I WOULD NOT EQUATE WHAT ROSEANNE SAID TO SAMANTHA. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SLICE OR DICE IT. BUT NOT AS UGLY AS THE N- WORD. SHE'S LOOKING FOR ATTENTION AND LIKE A CRY FOR HELP. SHE'S NOT A TALENTED COMEDIAN AND NOT ON THE COLBERT. SHE IS A MANTHA BEE LIST. AND SHE IS TRYING TO BE FILTHY. AND I ASK PEOPLE AT FOX NEWS AND THEY DO ALL OF THE NUMBER CRUNCHING. GIVE ME A LIST OF OTHER NASTY STUFF SHE SAID. I HAVE THREE PAGES OF DEROGATORY SEXUAL SLURS SHE USED AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP FAMILY AND ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. Greg: DON'T BE A TEASE. Jesse: IT IS ALL BAD. AND SOME OF THE WORST STUFF SHE RESERVED FOR THE WOMEN. KELLY ANN CONWAY. AND F - SARAH SANDERS. WHETHER CHELSEA HANDLER AND SAMANTHA BEE. THEY SAVE THE WORST FOR THE WOMEN. WHETHER IT IS MELANIA, OR IVANKA OR SARAH SANDERS. THEY GO NUTS ON THESE PEOPLE. THEY ARE MAD BECAUSE THEIR GIRL DIDN'T WIN. AND I FEEL LIKE THE COMEDIANS WENT FROM BEING FUNNY TOANGRY. AND I LIKE THE WORD SNOTTY. WE ARE WATCHING ADULT MEAN GIRLS ALL OF THE TIME. AND I THINK COMEDIANS HAVE A HARD JOB, YOU WANT TO BE FUNNY BUT NOT TOO UNPOLITICALLY CORRECT OR DID I OFFEND ANYBODY. BUT COMEDY SHOULD BE FUNNY AND THIS IS NOT FUNNY. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS HAVING A PROBLEM AND SHE IS TURNING INTO A MEAN GIRL SEEING WHAT SHE CAN SAY. THIS HAD TO BE SCRIPTED AND PEOPLE HEARD IT. AND THIS WAS A NETWORK DECISION TO RELEASE THIS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS IT AN OFF THE CUFF. Jesse: NOT A LIFE SHOW. AND EVERYBODY ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP BRASS KNEW IT. THEY HAVE TO LOOK HOW THEY HANDLE IT. AND THEN PEOPLE JUMP AND SAID IS THERE A IDEOLOGICAL REASON? GET FIRED AND NOT. WE LIVE IN A DAY AND AGE AND NOT TOLERATE MEAN AND NASTY STUFF. THAT IS NOT FUNNY MEANT TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BAD OR BE RACIST, YOU HAVE TO DO IT ACROSS THE BOARD. Jesse: I DON'T THINK SHE WILL BE CANNED. CBS IS NOT THINKING THEY WILL LOSE. SHE MAY GAIN VIEWERS. ROSEANNE, I THINK PEOPLE WOULD TURN IT OFF. I WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE APOLOGY. THERE HAS TO BE A POLICY HERE AND NOT ONE PERSON SAID SOMETHING HEINOUS AND DISGUSTING AND THEY LOSE THEIR JOB. AND ANOTHER PERSON KEEP THEIR JOB AND GET PROMOTED THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. Greg: IT GOES BACK TO WHAT CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER SAID IN THE '80s. THE RIGHT THINKS YOU ARE WRONG AND THE LEFT THINGS YOU ARE EVIL. AND THAT DEFINES THE SELECTIVE OUTRAGE AND MEANING THAT SOMEONE CAN GET AWAY SAYING SOMETHING HEINOUS ABOUT YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE EVIL. BULLPEN I SAY SOMETHING DISGUSTING ABOUT ANY LIBERAL THEY WILL GO HOW CAN YOU DO THAT? THAT IS DISGUSTING AND YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PERSON. IT IS THAT DIVIDE. THEY THINK YOU ARE EVIL AND WE THINK THEY ARE WRONG. AND THAT CREATES THE CULTURE. Jerry: MAKING EXCUSES. Greg: YOU ARE THE BAD PERSON. Jesse: THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA IS SO RIGHTOUS THEY ALLOW FOR THINGS LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN. Dana: WHAT ABOUT THE SELF POLICING OF YOUR OWN SIDE? Greg: YOU MENTIONED THE BAD AND NO AFFECTS. THEY MADE A JOKE ABOUT THE SHOOTING OF THESE PEOPLE AND SAID THEY WERE COUNTRY MUSIC FANS. AND TO THAT LIBERAL FAN, COUNTRY MUSIC FANS ARE RACIST RED NECKS AND THE JOKE IS OKAY AND THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. Geraldo: I THINK IT IS ANOTHER POINT HAVING TO DO WITH TIMING. I MADE MY SHARE OF GAFFES AND THE TIMING OF YOUR APOLOGY IS CRITICAL. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU APOLOGIZE AS SAMANTHA BEE AS ROSEANNE DID HOURS AFTER YOU TALK TO YOUR PR MORE THAN AND MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND SEEN THE AUDIENCE REACTION, I GIVE THAT LITTLE CREDIT. AND I DON'T IN ANY WAY, IT DOESN'T ABSOLVE THE SIN. IF YOU DO IT IMMEDIATE. AND OH, MY GOD I SCREW UP AND HIT THE SEND BUTTON AND I WISH I COULD GET THAT BACK. AND IF THERE IS A SPONTANEOUS APOLOGY WHERE IT COMES FROM THE SOUL AND YOU ARE YOUR OWN POLICEMEN AND MONITOR AND RESPONDING TO YOUR OWN MISDEED
