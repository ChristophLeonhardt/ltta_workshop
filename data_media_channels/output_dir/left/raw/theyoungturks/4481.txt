1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,380
NEW PARENTS ARE TRYING OUT THE
LATEST TREND IN HAVING BABIES.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,570
THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING KNOWN
AS LOTUS BIRTH, WHERE THEY KEEP

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,370
THE PLACENTA ATTACHED TO THE
BABY FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,400
TIME, SOMETIMES DAYS,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,520
AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS IS
THAT IT HELPS IMPROVE THE BABY'S

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,550
IMMUNE SYSTEM, AND HAS ALL SORTS
OF POSITIVE PHYSICAL BENEFITS.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,970
NOW, ACCORDING TO ATTENTION,
THERE'S A RAPIDLY GROWING TREND

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,469
AMONG NEW BIRTH PARENTS, WHERE
THEY ARE DELAYING THE COURT

9
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:36,690
CUTTING FOR DAYS, ALLOWING THE
PLACENTA TO DETACH ON ITS OWN.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,499
SO, WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS IS
A NERVOUS FATHER COMES IN AND

11
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:45,569
CUT THE UMBILICAL CORD, BUT IN
THIS CASE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN.

12
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:48,600
ACCORDING TO THOSE WHO PRACTICE
AND ADVOCATE FOR IT, LOTUS BIRTH

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,749
FACILITATES AN INTENSE BOND
BETWEEN MOTHER AND CHILD; IT'S

14
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:54,749
ALSO CLAIMED TO HELP BABIES
BITE OFF INFECTIONS,

15
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:57,420
SEVERE JAUNDICE, AND IMMUNE
SYSTEM DISEASES BY KEEPING

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,219
THE BABY ATTACHED TO THE
MOTHER'S BLOOD.

17
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,210
HOWEVER, THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF GYNECOLOGISTS SPEAKING

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,489
OUT AGAINST IT,
AND THEY SAY THAT THIS ACTUALLY

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,690
INCREASES THE CHANCE OF
INFECTION.

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,979
AMY TUTOR, A GYNECOLOGIST WHO
BLOGS AS SKEPTICAL OB, CALLS

21
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:15,469
LOTUS BIRTH A BIZARRE PRACTICE
WITH NO MEDICAL BENEFIT AND

22
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:18,859
CONSIDERABLE RISK, PARTICULARLY
MASSIVE INFECTION, AND A STUDY

23
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,549
IN 2016 FOUND AT LEAST ONE LOTUS
BIRTH BABY HAD TO BE READMITTED

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,539
TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER HER LIVER
EXPERIENCED SOME PROBLEMS.

25
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:29,969
SO, I AM THE MOST OPEN-MINDED
MAN IN AMERICA, EVERYBODY

26
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:30,969
KNOWS THIS.

27
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:31,969
DEFINITELY.

28
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,200
WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING OR
UNDEREMPLOYMENT, BUT

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,680
ANYWAY, LET'S MOVE ON.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,109
SO, AS I WAS READING THIS STORY
I THOUGHT, WELL, LOOK, HAVING

31
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,721
CONNECTION TO THE MOTHER'S
BLOOD, THERE'S A REASON WHY YOU

32
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:49,150
HAVE THE PLACENTA INSIDE THE
WOMB IN THE FIRST PLACE,

33
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,229
THERE COULD BE SOME LOGIC TO
THAT.

34
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,289
BUT I THOUGHT, COUPLE DAYS?

35
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:57,789
THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

36
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:03,649
AND THEN, ONE WOMAN SAID THAT,
IRON AND STEM CELLS ARE

37
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:04,789
DELIVERED TO THE BABIES STORES.

38
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:09,690
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S AN
ENGLISH VERNACULAR, I DON'T KNOW

39
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,239
WHAT STORES ARE, BUT THAT'S OKAY
I'M PROBABLY IGNORANT ON THAT.

40
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,709
BUT I WAS LIKE, DELIVERING
IRON AND STEM CELLS, MAYBE,

41
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,709
MAYBE, BUT THREE DAYS IN?

42
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,030
PROBABLY NOT.

43
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,860
AND THEN THEY SAID, OH IT ALSO
HAS METAPHYSICAL BENEFITS, AND I

44
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,860
WAS LIKE, I'M OUT.

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,890
THIS IS NONSENSE, TOTAL GARBAGE,
THERE'S NO WAY.

46
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,120
BUT EVEN THEN, THE GYNECOLOGIST
THAT YOU QUOTED, ANA, SAID THAT,

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,390
FOR A COUPLE HOURS THERE IS SOME
LOGIC IN KEEPING THE PLACENTA,

48
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,300
EVEN THOUGH IT'S KIND OF GROSS.

49
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,450
YOU HAVE A ROTTING PIECE OF
HUMAN WHATEVER ATTACHED YOU

50
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,450
ARE BABY.

51
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,050
IT IS ROTTING, IT IS ROTTING.

52
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,110
THEY SAY LIKE, YOU CAN CURE IT
WITH SALT.

53
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,519
DON'T CURE IT WITH SALT, HAVE
YOUR BABY.

54
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,000
YOU KNOW WHAT WILL MAKE YOUR
BABY HEALTHY?

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,190
TAKING CARE OF IT, NOT KEEPING
A ROTTING PIECE OF HUMAN

56
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,500
TISSUE ATTACHED TO IT.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,190
YEAH, AND IT'S WEIRD, AND THE
LOTUS, IT SOUNDS 単

58
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,189
IT SOUNDS LIKE A YOGA THING.

59
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:18,390
YEAH, WHICH IS THE FIRST WAY I
KNOW IT IS STRANGE, AND NOT

60
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,190
MEDICALLY SOUND.

61
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,530
YOU SEE THE PICTURES OF THE
MOMS, THEY ARE CARRYING THE

62
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,799
BABY, AND YOU SEE THE SACK 単
IT'S TOO MUCH WORK.

63
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:30,799
IT IS STRANGE.

64
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,330
THERE'S A REASON WHY GOD
INVENTED HOSPITALS.

65
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,079
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET
AT ME, AND THEY ARE GOING TO

66
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,599
SAY, NO, AND I HAVE FRIENDS WHO
ARE DELIVERED IN THE WHOLE

67
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,000
THING, WITH THE MIDWIFE AND THE
BATHTUB, AND IT WAS IN LIQUID.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,470
IF I WERE WEALTHY, BUT I WOULD
DO IS, I WOULD TURN MY BATHROOM

69
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,299
INTO A SPA-LIKE HOSPITAL
SITUATION.

70
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,299
I WANT A MIDWIFE THERE.

71
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:02,840
NO OFFENSE TO MIDWIVES, BUT YOU
ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,140
I WANT TO DOCTOR.

73
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,140
WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

74
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,170
WHAT IF I'M LOSING TOO MUCH
BLOOD?

75
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,079
WHAT IS MY BIG LIFE 単 WHAT IS MY
MIDWIFE GOING TO DO?

76
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,030
CALL THE DOCTOR.

77
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,310
IN NO WAY IS ANYONE I KNOW
GIVING DELIVERED 単

78
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:26,360
GIVING BIRTH WITHOUT A DOCTOR
RIGHT THERE.

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,830
FOR THE DOCTOR BEING IN A
DIFFERENT BUILDING, NO WE

80
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,100
ARE NOT DOING THAT.

81
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,340
SO, I KNOW THERE IS A WHOLE
RANGE, AND GOD BLESS YOU IF

82
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,500
YOU DO THAT RANGE, AND WE
ARE PROBABLY BEING TOO

83
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,490
JUDGMENTAL, BUT THE LOTUS BIRTH?

84
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,100
DON'T DO THAT.

85
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,340
THE PLACENTA, IF YOU WANT TO
KEEP IT FOR A COUPLE

86
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
MINUTES, COUPLE HOURS.

87
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,910
IF YOU WANT TO EAT YOUR
PLACENTA.

88
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,910
NO!

89
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,010
SOME WOMEN DO IT.

90
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,080
OR HAVE A HOME BIRTH, THAT'S
FINE.

91
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,120
BUT DON'T KEEP IT PASSED A
COUPLE HOURS, BECAUSE IT'S

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,780
DEAD CELLS AT THAT POINT,
AND THEY DON'T PASS ON

93
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,590
NUTRIENTS, THEY PASS ON
INFECTION.

94
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,040
YOU ARE GOING TO HURT YOUR KIDS,
SO I DON'T CARE HOW NICE IT

95
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,370
SOUNDS, LOTUS BIRTH, DON'T DO
IT, YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE

96
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,880
POOR KIDS SICK.

97
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,790
REMEMBER, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO
BELIEVE IN SCIENCE.

98
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,330
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF BIRTH I'M
IN FAVOR OF?

99
00:05:16,330 --> 00:00:00,000
SCIENCE BIRTH.
