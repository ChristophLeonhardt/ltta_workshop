1
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,910
when it comes to patent research you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,680
either pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of lawyers a lot of</font>

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">money or you could research things on</font>

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,670
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> using crowdsourcing today</font>

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,590
we're pleased to welcome Cheryl Malone

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,050
she's the founder<font color="#E5E5E5"> and CEO of article one</font>

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,150
partners and her<font color="#E5E5E5"> startup does just that</font>

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,429
so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the details tell</font>

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,140
me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little about article one partners</font>

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,290
what you guys do how it works what we do

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,270
is work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the global community</font>

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,520
reaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 million scientists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,800
technologists and they research the

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,379
validity of patents in English and in

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,050
eight other languages via foreign

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,300
language portals an article<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so how</font>

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,190
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these people are there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and who</font>

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,930
are they are they lawyers are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex</font>

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,730
lawyers are they housewives who are they

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,360
for our community we call them<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisors</font>

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280
who have given<font color="#E5E5E5"> us information about</font>

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,550
their backgrounds 57% have advanced

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">degrees scientist industry academics</font>

24
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,030
students perhaps some housewives<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,350
all have an interest in technology

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,970
research and they're incentivized

27
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,820
through card sourcing to provide us with

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,630
evidence about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the validity of patents</font>

29
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,890
excellent so you launched about six

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,110
months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our startup conference how</font>

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,340
have you grown in the last six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,860
what's happened to article one partners

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,650
so startup 09 was a catalyst for article

34
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,329
one we had launched about<font color="#E5E5E5"> six months</font>

35
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,119
prior and we had tremendous validation

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,939
from the VC community through<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup in</font>

37
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,460
the last six months we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> just completed</font>

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,409
a funding round through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private</font>

39
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,540
investor we've doubled our staff

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,360
including hiring a president with over

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,759
25 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of experience in the patent</font>

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,490
space and a former acting president of

43
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">North American sapient we have six plus</font>

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,820
fortune 100 clients and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 clients and</font>

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,219
we are at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> place where we're extremely</font>

46
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,040
excited about our growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and success</font>

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,600
great and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the internet</font>

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,340
will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shape patent law going</font>

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,600
forward do you think it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,360
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to debunk prior patents or do you</font>

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,389
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

52
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,950
you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to get</font>

53
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,220
trickier what's going to happen so

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,750
directionally the use of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as</font>

55
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,300
a resource for gathering information is

56
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,910
the way to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's being validated</font>

57
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,760
on our platform industry is talking

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,709
about article<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and this method</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

59
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,959
doing validity research they're also

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,450
talking about academic approaches that

61
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,000
are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar and the ability to</font>

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,160
uncover this information efficiently and

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,230
cost-effectively so it's extremely

64
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,410
exciting and are the individuals who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

65
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,470
doing the research for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are they as</font>

66
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,030
accurate or is trustworthy I would say

67
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,950
is you know hiring this expensive law

68
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,600
firm how do you kind of make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

69
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,420
their reputation is solid so we've been

70
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,250
fortunate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get feedback from our</font>

71
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">clients and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have about a thirty three</font>

72
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,590
percent weight of invalidity on our

73
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,930
research projects and we're not

74
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,239
comparing ourselves to law firms I did

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,850
competitive way we enhance the work that

76
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,310
law firms can do and assist them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

77
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,230
producing<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-quality work so maybe not</font>

78
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,910
replacing them as much as complimenting

79
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,030
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly great and are there any</font>

80
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,180
specific cases in the year or so you've

81
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">been around or specific industries or</font>

82
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,959
verticals where your research has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

83
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,239
getting a lot of attention or has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

84
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,700
particularly successful so there's a

85
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,380
number of industries which are highly

86
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,540
patent sensitive telecommunications for

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,640
example semiconductors pharmaceuticals

and in each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those industries or</font>

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,440
community has found evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

show patents to be invalid in one recent

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,500
not really focused

107
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,810
that at all so our community has looked

108
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,300
at those technologies and have has

109
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,180
produced results which have been helpful

110
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,740
to industry any specifics I can't go

111
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">into specifics great and you know one of</font>

112
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,790
the reasons we're here is to kind of

113
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,160
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how the startup contest</font>
