00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,035
“It is our duty to fight
for our freedom.

2
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:17,745
It is our duty to win.

3
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,475
We must love each other

4
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:23,285
and support each other.

5
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:25,685
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”

6
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:37,312
“Trump can’t read.
Trump can’t read.

7
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:39,832
All he does is watch TV.”

8
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:54,936
“Tell me what democracy looks like.
This is what democracy looks like.”

9
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:59,870
“Show me what democracy looks like.
This is what democracy looks like.”

10
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,360
“And together let’s make sure all
young girls everywhere

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,379
know that they have a voice.

12
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,510
They can use it. One
woman’s voice is powerful.

13
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,740
But all of our voices are
completely unstoppable.”

14
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:16,581
“Well I went down to the White House

15
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:20,523
and I took back what he stole from me.”

16
00:01:44,056 --> 00:00:00,000
“Women’s rights are human rights!”
