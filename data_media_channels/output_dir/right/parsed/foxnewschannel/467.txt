>> SO, WE WON.
WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS HAPPENING
THAT ARE GOOD.
WE HAVE TO DO WELL IN THE
MIDTERMS.
THIS THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY.
>> PRESIDENT HAD A RALLY IN
WHEELING.
IT WAS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL
STOPS ON HIS MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN RALLY SCHEDULE AS THE MID
MIDTERMS ARE JUST FIVE WEEKS
AWAY.
JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS KEVIN
McCARTHY.
HE IS LIVE FROM ROANOKE,
VIRGINIA.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK.
>> WE'LL TALK WITH LINDSEY
GRAHAM ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE.
I WONDER WHAT TOOK PLACE AROUND
THE KAVANAUGH HEARING IMPACTED
THE MID THERM ELECTIONS.
YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE
COUNTRY AND RAISING A LOT OF
MONEY.
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?
>> WELL, WHEN YOU DO HAVE
LINDSEY GRAHAM ON, THANK HIM.
SO MANY PEOPLE SAY TELL LINDSEY
GRAHAM THANK YOU.
WHAT HE SAID IS WHAT MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS WERE THINKING.
I'M FINDING PRIOR TO THE
KAVANAUGH HEARING THE INTENSITY
LEVEL WAS ON THE DEMOCRATIC
SIDE.
MORE DEMOCRATS WERE WANTING TO
VOTE THEN REPUBLICANS.
REPUBLICANS THOUGHT THERE WASN'T
A NEED.
IN THE LAST WEEK THERE HAS BEEN
A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT.
PEOPLE ARE UPSET.
NOT JUST HOW KAVANAUGH WAS
TREATED BUT DR.  FORD.
THEY HELD THIS LETTER
ACKNOWLEDGED YOU GOT -- IT.
THE INTENSITY HAS INCREASED.
FOR ALL OF YOUR VIEWERS.
IF THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES AND
THINK ABOUT NOVEMBER 7th.
IF WE WORK UP AND THE DEMOCRATS
TOOK THE MAJORITY WHAT YOU
WATCHED LAST WEEK WILL BE
INTENSIFIED FOR THE NEXT TWO
YEARS.
WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAVING SOCIAL
SECURITY.
IT WOULD BE HEARING AFTER
HEARING AFTER INVESTIGATION AND
INVESTIGATION.
THE ECONOMY WOULD COME TO THE
STOP.
THAT'S AWE VIEW OF WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN.
>> ANY IDEA THINGS CHANGE THESE
LAST FEW WEEKS WHEN WE SAW THE
LEFT RAMPING UP ATTACKS.
YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELINGLY
SPEAKING WITH VOTE IRES.
THIS WEEKEND YOU WERE AT
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT SAY ABOUT
THAT AND ARE YOU SEEING THAT
REACTION AND NUMBERS MOVE.
OVER THE PROCEEDING WEEKS A LOT
OF PEOPLE SAY IT'S IN THE BAG.
HAS THAT CHANGED.
>> I THINK IT'S CHANGED
DRASTICALLY.
WE LOOK AT THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS.
THAT'S INCREASED.
WE LOOK AT VOLUNTEERS COMING IN.
REPUBLICANS ARE AT A
DISADVANTAGE.
DEMOCRATS HAVE TWO LIBERAL
DEMOCRATS.
YOU HAVE MIKE BLOOMBURG WHO
PROMISED $80.
TOM WHO HIGHWAYS SPENT $120
MILLION.
HE BRAGGED ABOUT HIS LIST BEING
LARGER THAN THE NFL.
THEY ARE GIVING YOU A WINDOW
INTO WHAT THEY WOULD DO.
>> NONE THE LESS.
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN
TERMS OF MONEY RAISING.
WE WERE SUCCESS.
RERAISED -- WE RAISED $15
MILLION.
THAT'S WHY HOW DO WE EQUAL THE
PLAYING FIELD?
RESULTS VERSES RESISTANCE.
THE RESULTS ARE BETTER THAN THE
LAST 50 YEARS.
MORE JOBS THEN PEOPLE LOOKING
FOR.
THE LARGEST PAY RAISE ON
MILITARY IN NINE YEARS.
FUNDING THE MILITARY BACK FROM
IN CUTS UNDER THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE V.A.
OR THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE BILL
THAT JUST PASSED THE HOUSE AND
SENATE.
WE HAVE 112 PEOPLE THAT WILL DIE
TODAY BECAUSE OF ADDITION.
THE SAD PART IS NOT ONE DEMOCRAT
VOTED FOR THAT TAX BILL.
NOT ONE IN THE HOUSE OR SENATE.
THEY ALSO RESISTED IT.
THEY RESISTED ALLOW PEOPLE TO
KEEP MORE OF THEIR OWN MONEY.
>> WE KNOW NANCY SAID IT'S JUST
CRUMBS.
WE JUST SAW THIS PAST WEEK
ANOTHER GDP OF BETTER THAN 4%.
WE ARE KICKING OFF THE EARNING
SEASONS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE AT
22%.
EARNINGS AND GROWTH IS ANOTHER
STRONG QUARTER.
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT GOES TO
SOME OF THE RALLIES.
IT ENERGIZES HIM TO HERE IT
PEOPLE.
LET'S RUN A BIT OF THIS.
>> ALL OF THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS
KNOW IS HOW DO YOU OBSTRUCT AND
DESTROY.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO
WILLIAMS
WELLIAMS
WE AIAMS
WE AREMS
FIND OUT.
WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT
THIS NOVEMBER SO WE CAN ACCEPT
YOUR COUNTRY AND FREEDOM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> CONGRESSMAN, GO THROUGH THE
SPECIFIC RACES YOU ARE LOOKING
AT THAT ARE CLOSE OR YOU BELIEVE
ARE STRIKING IN THIS MIDTERM
ELECTION?
>> WELL, I'M IN VIRGINIA.
ONE RACE IS BARBARA.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT 41 OPEN SEATS
WHERE REPUBLICANS HAVE RETIRED.
I LOOK UP IN MINNESOTA.
IN THE DELIEUTENANT AREA.
WE ARE AHEAD.
I LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IF
YOU LOOK TO FLORIDA ONE OF THE
MOST CHALLENGEDS IF YOU LOOK ON
PAPER IS IN THE MIAMI AREA.
HE HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBERS.
THEY FOCUS ON THE DISTRICT.
IF YOU GO ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU
HAVE A TIGHTER THEN NORMAL
SENATE RACE.
OR GO TO CALIFORNIA WERE YOU
HAVE 14 HOUSE REPUBLICAN
MEMBERS.
HILARY CARRIED HALF OF THOSE
DISTRICTS.
ED RECOGNIZE IS RETIRING.
WE HAVE AN OPEN RACE.
THE IMMIGRANT CAME.
THEIR DEMOCRATIC COMPONENT HAS
BEEN ACCUSED FOR SEXUAL
HARASSMENT.
I NEVER HEARD EITHER OF THEM
STAND-UP FOR HER OR COMPETE
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THEIR.
IF YOU GO ACROSS CALIFORNIA,
IT'S COMPETITIVE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS MIKE IS
WRITING THE MILLION DOLLARS
CHECKS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA
TRYING TO INFLUENCE WHAT
CALIFORNIA HAVE TO VOTERS
BELIEVED.
>> THERE ARE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST
MR.  ELLISSON.
YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THAT.
NEEDLE ON ASSOCIATE
NEEDLE ON SSSOCIATE
NEEDLE ON SOCOCIATE
NEEDLE ON SOCIAIATE
NEEDLE ON SOCIALATE
CONGRESSMAN, YOU MOVED THE
NEEDLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA
CONVERSATION.
MANY FEEL THEY AREN'T GETTING A
FAIR SHOT.
THEIR CONSERVATIVE VOICES ARE
NOT BEING HAROLD.
I KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.
YOU MADE SURE THE CEO OF TWITTER
TESTIFIED.
THIS PAST WEEK YOU HAD A MEETING
WITH THE CEO OF GOOGLE.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT
MEETING?
>> I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE BIAS
THAT COMES ACROSS IN SOCIAL
IMMEDIATE.
WE WATCHED THEM WHERE THEY SAT
THEIR AND SOME CRIED TEARS.
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THEIR
OWN MEMOS OF A SILENT DONATION
OF HELPING AND USING THE
INTERNET.
HOW CAN GOOGLE USE THAT.
90% OF ALL SEARCHES GO THROUGH
GOOGLE.
95% OF THE PEOPLE DROP OFF WHEN
IT COMETS -- COMES DO THE SECOND
PAGE.
I SAT DOWN WITH THE CEO.
WE SPOKE ABOUT PRIVACY ISSUES
AND THEIR WORK WITHIN CHINA AND
WORK WITH THE MILITARY.
IT WAS A GOOD MEETING.
HE PLEDGED TO COME BACK TO A
HEARING.
GOOGLE HADN'T BEEN THERE BEFORE
AND I HAD GREAT CONCERN.
WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
IT COMES TO TWITTER OR AMAZON OR
FACEBOOK.
THESE ARE GREAT INFLUENCE.
TWO-THIRDS OF ALL ADULTS GET
THEIR NEWS FROM THE INTERNET.
WHEN YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS AND
AFTER WE HAD THE HEARINGS WE
FOUND CONSERVATIVES THAT WORK IN
THE BUSINESSES.
THEY HAVE SPOKEN UP.
A SENIOR ENGINEER PUT TOGETHER
HIS OWN GROUP.
HE FELT LIKE HE COULDN'T SPEAK
HIS OWN BELIEVES.
YOU HAD JACK, THE CEO THAT SAID
THAT'S THE WISE YOU
THAT'S THE BISE YOU
THAT'S THE BIAE YOU
CONSERVATIVES WEREN'T SAFE.
THAT'S THE BIAS YOU HAVE TO
STOP.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY.
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T TO BRING
THE SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHERS FROM
SILICON VALLEY INTO WASHINGTON.
>> WILL YOU BE ABLE TO MAKE A
CHANGE HERE?
DO YOU BELIEVE GOOGLE WILL MAKE
CHANGES?
IF YOU GOOGLE GOP CALIFORNIA
IDEOLOGY IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT CAME UP WAS NAZIISM.
SOMEONE PROGRAMMED THE ALGORITHM
OR DO YOU THINK LEGISLATION WILL
MAKE THE COMPANIES SMALLER.
>> I EXPECT CHANGE TO HAPPEN.
TO SAY MY PARTY WAS NAZIISM.
NOT THE PARTY OF LINCOLN OR
REAGAN.
THEY SAY THAT HAS TO DO WITH
WIKIPEDIA.
I MED WITH HIM TWO WEEKS AGO
WHILE OUT OF SESSION.
AFTER THAT MEETING, I DIDN'T
REQUEST IT.
HE WENT BACK AND WROTE A LETTER
ABOUT NOT PUTTING THEIR BELIEFS
BEFORE THE COMPANY.
THEY HAVE TO STOP THE BIAS
THROUGHOUT.
WE WATCHED JACK DOORCY SAY THEY
WEREN'T SHADOW BANNING.
THEY DID SHADOW BAN.
THEY ARE LIVING IN A BUBBLE.
THE ALGORITHM IS THERE.
THEY WILL GIVE YOU FOUR
