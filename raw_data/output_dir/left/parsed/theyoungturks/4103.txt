THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ANNOUNCED
THAT THEY ARE PARTING WAYS WITH
STEVE BANNON, THE CHIEF
STRATEGIST OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.
[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM] DOWN GOES BANNON!
WHAT NOW?
WHAT NOW?
OKAY, OF COURSE WE ARE
NOT REALLY SURE THAT WE GOT HIM.
THERE'S AN EXCELLENT CHANCE HE
GOT HIMSELF, ALONG WITH THE
ENTIRE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
I
THINK TRUMP STILL THINKS HE'S ON
THE APPRENTICE, HE HAS TO FIRE
SOMEONE EVERY WEEK.
AT ALMOST EVERY FRIDAY.
SCARAMUCCI WAS OUT ON A MONDAY,
EVERYONE ELSE IS OUT ON A
FRIDAY.
USUALLY IN A NORMAL
ADMINISTRATION THE NEWS CYCLE
STARTS TO DIE DOWN, AND BY
FRIDAY THERE IS VERY LITTLE NEWS
TO COVER, BUT NO, WITH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION FRIDAY TENDS TO
BE AN EXPLOSIVE NEWSDAY, AND THE
WEEKEND GETS MORE EXPLOSIVE.
LET
ME GIVE YOU BACKGROUND AND
CONTEXT OF WHAT IS GOING ON
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DRAMA
AND IT'S VERY GOOD.
LET'S START
FROM THE BEGINNING, THE WHITE
HOUSE RELEASED A STATEMENT TODAY
INDICATING THEY WERE PART WAYS
WITH STEVE BANNON, SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS RELEASED THAT
STATEMENT AND 
SAID --
OF COURSE EVEN THOUGH
BANNON'S GONE THERE ARE SOME
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS
STILL LEAKING TO THE MEDIA, AND
THEY SAY IT WASN'T A MUTUAL
DECISION, I'LL GET TO THAT IN A
SECOND, BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME
FORESHADOWING OF THIS.
EARLIER
IN THE WEEK WHEN DONALD TRUMP
GAVE HIS SUPER QUESTIONABLE
PRESS CONFERENCE ON
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH QUICKLY
DEVOLVED INTO COMMENTS ABOUT HOW
WHITE SUPREMACISTS ARE BAD JUST
LIKE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT ARE BAD,
HE ALSO TOUCHED ON STEVE BANNON
--
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR CHIEF
STRATEGIST, MR.
BANNON?
I NEVER SPOKE TO MR.
BANNON
ABOUT IT.
DO YOU STILL HAVE CONFIDENCE
IN HIM?
LOOK, I LIKE MR.
BANNON, HE'S
A FRIEND OF MINE.
BUT MR.
BANNON
CAME ON VERY LATE, YOU KNOW THAT
TIME I WENT THROUGH 17 SENATORS,
GOVERNORS, AND WON ALL THE
PRIMARIES, MR.
BANNON CAME ON
LATER THAN THAT, AND I LIKE HIM,
HE'S A GOOD MAN, HE'S NOT A
RACIST, I CAN TELL YOU THAT,
HE'S A GOOD PERSON, HE GETS
UNFAIR PRESS IN THAT REGARD, WE
WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
MR.
BANNON BUT HE'S A GOOD
PERSON AND I THINK THE
PRESS TREATS HIM FRANKLY VERY
UNFAIRLY.
AT THAT POINT HE WAS GONE.
TRUMP IS SUCH A MADMAN THAT
THERE'S SOME CHANCE HE WOULD
HAVE RETAINED HIM, BUT ANY OTHER
PRESIDENT WHO SAYS WE'LL SEE
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT GUY,
THAT DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN
MADE.
ALSO IT IS RUMORED THAT IT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED EARLIER
ANYWAY.
AND ALSO, MR.
BANNON?
BANNON BANNON FO-FANNON --
THERE'S SUCH A DISTANCE.
I ALSO THINK HE'S A LITTLE
SCARED OF HIM, BECAUSE HE HAS
THAT BREITBART, ALT-RIGHT
CONTINGENT.
HE ALMOST NEVER CALLS ANYONE MR.
ANYTHING.
IF HE WAS SCARED THEN --
THAT CONTINGENT IS GOING TO
WAR, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN
A SECOND.
SO THAT'S WHY THE
CONTEXT OF STEVE BANNON'S
CALLING ROBERT KUTTNER AT THE
AMERICAN PROSPECT AND SAYING THE
THINGS HE DID IS FASCINATING,
I'M NOT SURE IT'S THAT RELEVANT
ANYMORE, BUT IT'S FASCINATING AS
TO -- BECAUSE HE SAID THAT AFTER
TRUMP SAID WE'LL SEE ABOUT MR.
BANNON.
THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS
THAT PLAYED INTO THIS EVENTUAL
OUTCOME, AND I WANT TO TOUCH ON
ALL OF THOSE FACTORS NOW.
FIRST
OF ALL, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
BANNON HAD A VERY TENSE
RELATIONSHIP WITH SEVERAL
MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S
ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING JARED
KUSHNER, SOMEONE WHO HE BELIEVES
IS THIS GLOBALIST, AND BY THE
WAY, PEOPLE WHO WRITE FOR
BREITBART HAVE BEEN CRITICIZING
KUSHNER PRETTY AGGRESSIVELY.
AND
THERE'S ALSO GARY COHN, THE
NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL
DIRECTOR, AND H.R. MCMASTER.
BANNON USED TO BE PART OF THE
SECURITY COUNCIL BUT WAS
ESSENTIALLY KICKED OUT, AND H.R.
MCMASTER HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THAT, SO BANNON HAS BEEN
PRETTY SALTY ABOUT 
THAT SINCE IT
OCCURRED.
ALSO --
ALSO IN REGARD TO 
TRUMP --
ONLY THE PRESIDENT GETS TO
MAKE PERSONNEL CHANGES, SO WHEN
BANNON SAID I'M GOING TO FIRE
THIS GUY OR PUT THAT PERSON IN
PLACE, THAT DEFINITELY GOT UNDER
TRUMP'S SKIN, THAT TOUCHES HIS
EGO, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN
THE WORLD.
IT'S NOT OVERLY
IMPORTANT NOW THAT BANNON IS OUT
AS TO THE CHRONOLOGY, THIS WHOLE
IDEA THAT BANNON WANTED TO
RESIGN ANYWAY ON AUGUST 2,
THAT'S TOTAL B.S., IGNORE THAT
COMPLETELY, HE FOUGHT IT ALL THE
WAY TO THE END, AND IT APPEARS
BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF THE
REPORTING THAT HE WAS FIRED
TODAY AND IS A FACE-SAVING
GESTURE THEY SAID WE WILL LET
YOU CALL IT A RESIGNATION.
BUT
NOW, IRONICALLY BECAUSE HE WAS A
HUGE LEAKER, THEY ARE LEAKING
ALL OVER THE PLACE GOING, IT
WASN'T A RESIGNATION, HE WAS
FIRED.
MY SENSE OF IT, MICHAEL,
IS THAT IF TRUMP HADN'T MADE UP
HIS MIND HE WAS CLOSE TO IT
BEFORE BANNON GAVE THAT
DISASTROUS INTERVIEW TO THE
AMERICAN PROSPECT --
THAT THE IRONY, IT CAME FROM
GIVING AN INTERVIEW TO A FAIRLY
LIBERAL PUBLICATION.
SO IN A SENSE, WE GOT HIM.
THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING.
AND
IF THAT WASN'T IT IT WAS JOHN
KELLY COMING IN AS OTHERS HAVE
DONE AND WHAT THEY CALL TRUMP
WORLD, DOING THE SAME THING.
TRUMP, IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE
YOU JUST PLAYED, ANA, HE SAID WE
WON A LOT OF PRIMARIES, WE GOT A
LOT OF GOVERNORS, BEFORE BANNON
GOT HERE.
BUT TO BANNON'S CREDIT
HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB IN THE
GENERAL ELECTION OF FINDING OUT
WHERE TO GO IN FINDING OUT WHAT
THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T VOTE IN
THE PRIMARIES OR IN PAST
ELECTIONS, OR REALLY JUST WANTED
DONALD TRUMP TO BE THERE, WHERE
THEY WERE, AND HELPED TARGET
THAT ELECTION.
HE WAS AN
EFFICIENT LEADER AT THAT TIME,
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH TRUMP HE
COULD DISPOSE OF PAUL MANAFORT
WHO WAS COMING IN TO CLEAN HOUSE
AND MAKE EVERYTHING WORK -- IF
JOHN KELLY THINKS HE'S GOT A JOB
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, HE
COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG.
TRUMP,
IT'S SEE YOU LATER AND THAT'S
THE END OF IT WITH THESE PEOPLE.
LEWANDOWSKI COMES IN ONCE IN A
WHILE.
ULTIMATELY I THINK HE WILL DO
IT TO HIMSELF AT THE END.
OKAY
DONNIE, YOU'RE FIRED.
BUT THAT'S
FOR ANOTHER DAY.
BUT TO YOUR
POINT, MICHAEL, WHEN HE TALKS
ABOUT THOSE STATES HE WON
WITHOUT BANNON, THAT'S HIM
SAYING REMEMBER, IT WAS ME, NOT
MR.
BANNON.
THE NUMBER ONE OFFENSE IN
TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL
GET YOU FIRED IS HURTING HIS EGO
IN ANY WAY. AND IF YOU TAKE
CREDIT FOR ANYTHING IN TRUMP'S
ADMINISTRATION HE WILL FIND A
WAY TO FIRE YOU, AND I THINK
THAT PLAYED A ROLE IN HIS
EVENTUAL FIRING.
I ALSO THINK,
THOUGH, THAT THERE WAS A FEAR --
OR NOT JUST A FEAR, I THINK
THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE, THAT
BANNON WAS ONE OF THE LEAKERS,
AND I DON'T THINK THAT AMERICAN
PROSPECT INTERVIEW -- LOOK, SOME
OUTLETS REPORTED ON THAT
INTERVIEW AS IF BANNON PULLED A
SCARAMUCCI AND DIDN'T KNOW THAT
IT WAS NOT OFF THE RECORD.
BANNON ISN'T AN IDIOT, HE WORKS
IN THE MEDIA.
HE KNEW IT WAS ON
THE RECORD, HE KNEW IT WOULD GET
REPORTED, I THINK THAT WAS HIM
FLEXING HIS MUSCLES TO SHOW
TRUMP, I HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE
IN MEDIA.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
QUESTION.
THAT'S A PERFECTLY
GOOD HYPOTHESIS.
I HAVE TWO
OTHERS, WHICH I HAVEN'T MADE UP
MY MIND BETWEEN.
ONE IS THAT
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU KNOW
SOMETHING IS GOING IN A CERTAIN
DIRECTION, AND I'VE SEEN
ATHLETES DO THIS A MILLION
TIMES, YOU WILL SUBCONSCIOUSLY
THROW IT.
HIM GOING ON THERE,
NOT CLARIFYING THAT IT'S OFF THE
RECORD, AND SAYING ALL THIS
STUFF, IS A WAY OF THROWING IN
THE TOWEL, I'M DONE WITH THIS.
POSSIBLE, I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S
DEFINITE.
AND I KNOW THAT'S POP
PSYCHOLOGY, I GET THAT.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE
WOULD'VE PICKED THE AMERICAN
PROSPECT TO THROW THE FLAG IN.
THE OTHER THING HE MIGHT HAVE
DONE, BECAUSE HE'S NOT AS DUMB
AS TRUMP -- TRUMP WOULDN'T HAVE
THOUGHT ANY OF THIS THROUGH, IF
TRUMP DID IT I WOULD SAY HE'S AN
IDIOT, HE CALLED THE GUY AND
THAT'S IT -- IS HE KNEW HE WAS
GETTING FIRED, HE SAW THAT PRESS
CONFERENCE, HE KNEW THAT WE'LL
SEE MEANS YOU ARE DONE, SO HE
DOES THIS SO HE IS A FIG LEAF
FOR WHY HE GOT FIRED LIKE
SCARAMUCCI AS OPPOSED TO, YOU
ARE TOO RACIST, YOU ARE TOO THIS
OR THAT, AND YOU WERE SHOWN THE
DOOR.
THIS SEEMS LIKE I SCREWED
UP THAT ONE LITTLE THING AND
THAT'S WHY I GOT FIRED,
OTHERWISE I HAD IT.
THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS,
THAT STUFF DOESN'T MATTER
NOW THAT HE'S GONE, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IS THAT
HE'S GONE.
HE'S GONE, AND WHAT I
SPECULATE HE WILL DO NOW THAT
HE'S GONE I THINK IS WAY MORE
RELEVANT.
I KNOW IT'S ONLY
SPECULATION, BUT PEOPLE BELIEVE
THAT BANNON WILL GO RIGHT BACK
TO BREITBART, WHY WOULDN'T HE?
HE STILL HAS INFLUENCE OVER THE
REPORTING THAT TAKES PLACE
THERE, WHICH IS WHY THEY BEEN SO
CRITICAL OF EVERYONE IN THE
ADMINISTRATION THAT BANNON
DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH.
I THINK THE FACT HE'S GONE IS
GREAT NEWS FOR THE COUNTRY FOR
SEVERAL REASONS.
NUMBER ONE IS,
HE'S THE FATHER OF THE ALT-RIGHT
MOVEMENT, A WHITE NATIONALIST
MOVEMENT, HAVING THAT GUY IN THE
WHITE HOUSE WAS TOXIC, AND IT'S
A GREAT RELIEF THAT HE'S GONE.
THE SECOND IS THAT HE'S WAY
BRIGHTER THAN TRUMP, AND IF HE
HAD DONE HIS EXACT POPULIST
STRATEGY -- NOT POLICY WISE,
POLICY WISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
DISASTER -- BUT POLITICALLY IT
HAD SOME CHANCE OF WORKING.
IF
YOU WENT WITH AN ECONOMIC
NATIONALISM LIKE HE TOLD KUTTNER
AT THE AMERICAN PROSPECT, IT'S
AN UGLY FORM OF POLITICS BUT ONE
THAT HAS POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY AT
A TIME OF POPULIST RAGE.
NOW
WITHOUT HIM TRUMP HAS NO CHANCE
OF PULLING THAT OFF, AND NOW
HE'S SURROUNDED BY GOLDMAN SACHS
GUYS WHO THE COUNTRY BASICALLY
HATES.
AND NOW HE'S BASICALLY
TAKING SOME OF HIS ALT-RIGTH
BASE WITH HIM.
EVEN IF THEY
AREN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR A
DEMOCRAT, A LOT OF THEM SAID
THEY WILL STAY HOME.
AND THAT
WAS THE PROBLEM THE DEMOCRATS
HAD.
SO IT'S JUST A GIANT
WIN/WIN FOR US IN THE COUNTRY
THAT BANNON IS OUT BECAUSE
POLICY WISE THEY WON'T GO
IN AS BAD A DIRECTION
WITHOUT HIS GUIDANCE, AND
POLITICALLY I THINK IT DOES
SERIOUS DAMAGE TO TRUMP.
THAT IS TRUE.
AFTER REINCE
PRIEBUS LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE I
SPOKE TO SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO SAID THERE'S
ALWAYS A CALCULATION THEY MAKE,
THEY SIT DOWN AND THEY SAY HOW
MUCH IS THIS GUY OR THIS WOMAN
THAT HURT US FROM OUTSIDE?
THERE
WAS ALWAYS THE FEAR THAT STEVE
BANNON LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE
UNDER BAD CIRCUMSTANCES, AND
IT'S BAD FOR THE ADMINISTRATION
BECAUSE HE WILL GO OUT AND JUST
WAGE WAR AGAINST THEM AND SAY
WHAT THE SECRETS ARE, ETC., AND
AFTERWARDS TODAY BANNON GAVE AN
INTERVIEW AND HE SAID HE IS
GOING TO WAR, BUT HE'S GOING TO
WAR WITH THE OPPONENTS OF THE
WHITE HOUSE.
HE'S GOING TO SPEND
HIS TIME GOING AFTER THE
OPPONENTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
WHICH YOU CAN BELIEVE HE WOULD
SAY TODAY, BUT WATCH HIM IN A
WEEK OR A MONTH OR THREE MONTHS,
BECAUSE MOST LIKELY HE HAS A
CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED AND HOW IT HAPPENED.
BUT MAYBE NOT.
HE HAS LIVED IN
THE SHADOWS IN SOME RESPECTS,
NOW HE'S GOING TO COME OUT.
YOU
CALLED HIM THE FATHER OF THE
ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT, I WOULD SAY
HE'S MORE OF THE GODFATHER.
HE
CULTIVATED IT, AND HE MAY BE
MORE DANGEROUS NOW.
OF COURSE HE WILL ATTACK THE
LEFT.
HE AND I NEVER HAD
INTERACTIONS, WE MET ONCE AT THE
RNC -- OF COURSE HE DOESN'T LIKE
THE LEFT, BUT HE HAS HAD EIGHT
MONTHS OF WARFARE AGAINST GARY
COHN AND JARED KUSHNER AND ALL
THE GUYS HE CALLS GLOBALISTS,
ESPECIALLY H.R. MCMASTER, HE
WILL GO TO WAR AGAINST THEM.
IT'S LIKE CIRSEI -- I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THE WHITE WALKERS, I
WILL GO AFTER MY OPPONENTS IN
WESTEROS FIRST.
SPEAKING OF
WHITE WALKERS, AND STEVE BANNON
YOU HAVE A HELLUVA WHITE
WALKER AND HE JUST WALKED OUT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE.
