PREPARATIONS, LET'S LISTEN. 
>> RIGHT NOW I'M 100% FOCUSED 
ON FLORENCE AND THAT'S EXACTLY 
WHERE OUR ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE 
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE LIFE 
SATE MISSIONS. 
WITH THAT -- SAFETY MISSIONS. 
WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVITE 
IN OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. 
FLORENCE EXCUSE MANY I. YEAH. 
>> WOULD YOU SAY THOUGH DO YOU 
FEEL CONFIDENT THAT YOU ARE 
FOLLOWING THE STATUTES AND THE 
LAWS AS IT RELATES TO THE USE 
OF THE. 
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET TO FLOYD 
-- FLORENCE EXCUSE ME. 
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO FLORENCE. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO PUSH FORWARD 
AND CON CONCENTRATE ON THE LIFE 
SAFETY ISSUES. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WE WILL HAVE TIME FOR Q&A AT 
THE END. 
THANKS FOR THAT. 
>> THANKS GUYS. 
GOT LINDA? 
ALL RIGHT. 
ALL RIGHT. 
SO IN REGARDS TO FLORENCE, JUST 
BECAUSE THE WIND SPEEDS CAME 
DOWN INTENSITY OF THE STORM 
CAME DOWN TO CAT 2, PLEASE 
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN. 
THE STORM SURGE FORECAST 
ASSOCIATED WITH THERE STORM HAS 
NOT CHANGED. 
IT HAS REMAINED THE SAME AND 
HERE'S WHY. 
AS THE SYSTEM'S ENCROACHING ON 
THE COAST THE WIND FIELD IS 
EXPANDING SO WHAT YOU ARE GOING 
TO START SEEING IN A MATTER OF 
HOURS AND IN THE NEXT COMING 
HOURS IS THESE WIND BANDS THAT 
FAR PRECEDE THE CENTER OF 
CIRCULATION ARE GOING TO START 
PUSHING WATER UP AGAINST THE 
COAST BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, UP 
THE BACK BAY AND INLAND AREAS. 
STORM SURGE IS NOT A PROBLEM 
JUST ALONG THE COASTLINE. 
IT'S GOING TO BE A MAJOR 
PROBLEM. 
WAY UP INTO THE STREAMS AND 
TRIBUTARIES THAT COME OUT OF 
SOUND AREAS THAT PUSH UP INTO 
THE SOUNDS. 
LIKE THE PIMLICO SOUND ON THE 
WEST SIDE OF THE SOUND. 
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS STORM. 
STORM SURGE IS WHY YOU HAVE 
BEEN PLACED UNDER MANY OF YOU 
HAVE BEEN PLACED UNDER 
EVACUATION AND WE ARE ASKING 
CITIZENS TO PLEASE HEED THE 
WARNING. 
YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT. 
THE OCEAN IS GOING TO START 
RISING. 
ALONG THE COAST. 
AND IN THE BACK BAY AND INLAND 
AREAS AND THE SOUND AREAS 
WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS. 
YOUR TIME TO GET OUT OF THE 
THOSE AREAS AND STORM SURGE 
INUNDATION IS COMING TO A 
CLOSE. 
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THAT ENOUGH. 
WITH THAT, THE OTHER THING 
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS NOT 
ONLY ARE WE GOING TO SEE HIGH 
WINDS, 110-MILE AN HOUR 
SUSTAINED WINDS COMING UPON THE 
COAST, THE WIND FIELD IS LARGE. 
THERE ARE HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS 
THAT EXTEND FAR OUT FROM THE 
CENTER OF CIRCULATION. 
THAT WILL NOT ONLY INUNDATE THE 
COAST BUT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE 
SOME HIGH INLAND WINDS AS THE 
STORM STARTS TO COME IN AND 
PUSH INTO THE COAST. 
COUPLED WITH THAT IS COPIOUS 
AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL AS THE 
SYSTEM IS PULLING A LOT OF 
MOISTURE OUT OF THE OCEAN. 
AND YOU ARE ALREADY SEEING RAIN 
BANDS COME ALONG THE CAROLINA 
SHORELINE AND UNFORTUNATELY, 
THESE RAIN BANDS ARE GOING TO 
BE WITH US FOR SEVERAL DAYS. 
WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW -- THE 
FORECASTERS ARE BASICALLY 
INDICATING FEET OF RAIN. 
NOT INCHES. 
IN PORTIONS OF THE CAROLINAS 
AND INTO VIRGINIA. 
SO THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS 
STORM. 
INLAND FLOODING KILLS A LOT OF 
PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO 
SEE. 
SO PLEASE REMEMBER THAT. 
THE OTHER THING IS THAT I WANT 
-- I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW 
THAT FEMA AND OUR FEDERAL 
PARTNERS HAVE FULLY 
PREPOSITIONED IN SO FORTH OF 
OUR STATE AND LOCAL -- SUPPORT 
OF OUR STATE AND LOCAL 
PARTNERS, HERE AGAIN WE ARE 
HERE TO HELP THE GOVERNORS 
ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IS A TEAM 
SUPPORT. 
AS THE -- SPORT. 
AS THE SYSTEM PUSHES THROUGH 
RIGHT NOW. 
LARGELY FOCUSED ON LIFE SAFETY 
AND SUPPORTING MASS CARE AND 
EVACUATION MOVEMENT,. 
AS THE SYSTEM PUSHES THROUGH 
STARTS TO EXIT THE CAROLINAS 
AND VIRGINIA AND YOU KNOW, THE 
THREAT CEASES. 
WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON 
STABILIZING WHAT WE CALL 
COMMUNITY LIFELINES. 
FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE GOT TO 
QUICKLY UNDERSTAND THE DAMAGE 
THAT'S BEEN DONE TO THE 
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THE 
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. 
THE POWER SYSTEMS. 
AND WE ARE POSITIONING AND HAVE 
BEEN POSITIONED FOR MULTIPLE 
DAYS NOW TO BE READY TO GET 
THOSE CRITICAL LIFELINES BACK 
UP AND STABLE AS QUICKLY AS WE 
CAN. 
BUT LET ME SET THE 
EXPECTATIONS. 
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS STORM. 
WE CALL THEM DISASTERS BECAUSE 
THEY BREAK THINGS. 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO 
BREAK. 
THE POWER IS GOING TO GO OUT. 
IT COULD GO OUT FOR A NUMBER OF 
DAYS AND MANY WEEKS IT'S HARD 
TO SAY AT THIS POINT. 
SO NOT ONLY THAT, BUT MANY OF 
YOU WHO HAVE EVACUATED FROM THE 
CAROLINA COASTLINES ARE GOING 
TO BE DISPLACED FOR A WHILE. 
PARTICULARLY WHERE THE AREAS 
RECEIVE THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF 
STORM SURGE. 
SO YOU KNOW, WE NEED PEOPLE TO 
GET THEIR MINDSETS RIGHT. 
THAT DISASTERS ARE VERY 
FRUSTRATING. 
AND IT TAKES TIME TO GET THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE BACK UP AND 
RUNNING BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO 
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO PUSH 
FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO 
GET THINGS BACK UP AND WORKING 
ALONG WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS 
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO OWNS 
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CRITICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S GOING TO 
BE IMPACTE. 
WITH THAT, I WANT TO QUICKLY 
TURN IT OVER TO OUR PARTNERS 
OVER AT NOAA. 
DR. JACOBS AND DR. GOLDSTEIN. 
TAKE IT AWAY. 
>> Reporter: FLORENCE IS A 
CATEGORY 2 HURRICANE WITH 
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS OF 110 
MILES AN HOUR. 
IT IS MOVING NORTHWEST AND IS 
PRESENTLY CENTERED 170 MILES 
EAST/SOUTHEAST OF WILMINGTON, 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
AND 220 MILES EAST OF MYRTLE 
BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA. 
FLORENCE IS A VERY LARGE 
HURRICANE. 
HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS EXTEND 
OUTWARD 80 MILES FROM THE 
CENTER. 
AND TROPICAL STORM-FORCE WINDS 
EXTEND NEARLY 200 MILES OUT 
FROM THE CENTER. 
FLORENCE IS FORECAST TO SLOW 
DOWN AS IT APPROACHES THE 
COAST. 
SO EVEN TODAY AS WE SEE OUTER 
RAIN BANDS FROM FLORENCE MOVE 
INTO THE OUTER BANKS OF NORTH 
CAROLINA, LANDFALL IS NOT 
EXPECTED FOR ANOTHER 36 HOURS. 
SOMETIME FRIDAY AFTERNOON, 
FRILL EVENING OR EVEN EARLY 
SATURDAY -- FRIDAY EVENING OR 
EVEN EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. 
THE SHORE SLOW MOVING -- SLOW 
MOVING VERY LARGE HURRICANE 
WILL BRING STORM SURGE AND 
HURRICANE FORCE WIND THREAT TO 
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA AND 
SOUTH CAROLINA INTO THE 
WEEKEND. 
IN NORTH CAROLINA, WE'RE 
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE PIMLICO SOUND AND THE 
PIMLICO AND NEUSE RIVERS WHERE 
NINE TO 12 FEET OF STORM SURGE 
ARE FORECAST. 
AND THE BEACHES FROM THE OUTER 
BANKS TO THE WILMINGTON AREA 6 
TO 9 FEET OF STORM SURGE ARE 
FORECAST OVER SEVERAL 
ASTRONOMICAL HIGH TIDE CYCLES. 
AS FAR AS RAINFALL, WE'RE STILL 
FORECASTING 20 TO 30 INCHES 
POSSIBLY 40 INCHES OR MORE 
ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN NORTH 
CAROLINA AND NORTHEASTERN SOUTH 
CAROLINA. 
IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THAT, 
THERE'S ALSO A TORNADO WATCH IN 
EFFECT FOR EASTERN NORTH 
CAROLINA TODAY AND TOMORROW. 
THE NEXT ADVISORY FROM THE 
NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER WILL 
BE ISSUED AT 11:00 EASTERN 
TIME. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I JUST LIKE TO TAKE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO EMPHASIZE THAT 
THE EXPANSE OF THIS STORM. 
SO THE TROPICAL STORM-FORCE 
WINDS EXTEND OUT 200 MILES AND 
THE HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS 
EXTEND OUT 80. 
THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY LARGE 
STORM AND WHEN IT SLOWS DOWN 
WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THIS 
EXPANSIVE WIND FIELD WILL PILE 
UP WATER ALONG THE COAST AND 
THE FORM OF A STORM SURGE. 
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RAIN. 
AND AS THE STORM SLOWS DOWN, 
THERE'S GOING TO BE LOTS OF 
COASTAL FLOODING AND WITH THAT 
COMBINED WITH THE ONSHORE FLOW 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD FOR 
THIS WATER TO EVACUATE. 
SO YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INLAND 
FLOODING. 
I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE CORE 
OFFICERS FOR FLYING SEVERAL 
FLIGHTS INTO STORM COLLECTING 
DATA TO IMPRESUME THE FORECAST 
SCALE THE MODELS. 
IN ADDITION TO THAT ALSO LIKE 
TO THANK THE AIR FORCE FOR 
PROVIDING RECONNAISSANCE 
FLIGHTS AS WELL. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
THANKS DOC. 
ALL RIGHT NEXT WE HAVE OUR 
PARTNERS WITH THE AMERICAN RED 
CROSS. 
CHARLIE ENGLISH TO GIVE US AN 
UPDATE ON THE MASS CARE EFFORTS 
UNDERSTOOD WAY. 
-- UNDERWAY. 
>> THANK YOU ADMINISTRATOR LONG 
AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE 
YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR 
INCLUSIVENESS OF OUR FAITH 
BASED AND PRIVATE NONPROFIT 
PARTNERS ON THE TEAM. 
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
THAT. 
THE RED CROSS AND OTHER PRIVATE 
NONPROFITS CONTINUE TO PRESTAGE 
RESOURCES IN THE THEATER OF 
OPERATIONS IN THE ATLANTIC 
AREA. 
JUST LIKE TO SETTLE A LITTLE 
EXPECTATIONS IF THE PUBLIC HAS 
NOT EXPERIENCED STAYING IN THE 
SHELTER IN THE PAST, YOU'LL BE 
SAFE. 
BUT CONDITIONS ARE SPARTAN SO 
WE'D ASK YOU TO BRING YOUR 
TOOTHBRUSH AND YOUR PILLOW AND 
OTHER COMFORT ITEMS WITH YOU. 
AND WE'LL KEEP YOU SAFE UNTIL 
THE STORM PASSES. 
AND THEN POST-LANDFALL AND POST-
IMPACT WILL BE A MORE 
COMFORTABLE SITUATION FOR YOU. 
ALSO LIKE TO TAKE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT THIS 
STORM IS A SIGNIFICANT EVENT. 
OUR RESOURCES WILL BE 
STRETCHED. 
IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH NOT 
TO BE IMPACTED BEWOULD LIKE -- 
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU 
CONSIDER BEING A VOLUNTEER. 
YOU CAN DO THAT AT REDCROSS.ORG 
OR ANY OTHER OF THE OTHER FINE 
AGENCIES THAT YOU CHOOSE TO 
VOLUNTEER WITH. 
THANK YOU. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
AND FOLKS, ONE OF THE MOST 
POWERFUL ARMS OF THE WHOLE 
COMMUNITY IS THE NON-
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE 
THE RED CROSS AND HERE AGAIN 
WHEN THE STORM PASTS THIS IS 
ABOUT A NEIGHBOR -- PASSES THIS 
IS ABOUT A NEIGHBOR HELPING 
NEIGHBOR. 
IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO GET 
INVOLVED AND NOT IN YOU KNOW 
THE CAROLINAS BUT YOU ARE 
LOOKING TO GET INVOLVED TO HELP 
OUT THE SITUATION, ONCE THIS 
THING IS PASSED, GO TO 
INFOAD.ORG OR REDCROSS.ORG. 
SO THANK YOU AGAIN. 
NEXT UP, WE HAVE OUR PARTNERS 
WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF 
ENGINEERS MR. RAY ALEXANDER. 
>> THANK YOU ADMINISTRATOR

AS FAR AS DAMS THERE ARE FIVE 
CORPS OF ENGINEER DAMS IN 
VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA. 
ALL HAVE SUFFICIENT FLOOD

ANY EFFECTS OF FLORENCE OF 
THOSE DAMS ARE MITIGATED. 
AND IN TERMS OF NAVIGATION, 
CLOSELY WORKING WITH OUR

IN PREP RATION FOR THE STORM 
THE COAST GUARD IS TAKING THE 
FOLLOWING ACTIONS. 
THE PORTS OF WILMINGTON AND

HAZARDOUS. 
SO PLEASE STAY IN A SAFE 
LOCATION WHILE COAST GUARD AND 
OTHER PARTNERS ASSESS THE 
DAMAGE AND LET YOU KNOW WHEN 
IT'S SAFE TO DO SO. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
NEXT UP WE HAVE THE OFFICE OF 
DISABILITY INTEGRATION 
COORDINATION AT FEMA. 
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT 
FOR FEMA TO HELP OUR PARTNERS 
DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO 
RENDER THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF 
FUNCTIONAL ACCESS NEEDS THAT WE 
CAN. 
NOT ONLY DURING THE RESPONSE 
PHASE BUT ALSO AFTER THE 
RECOVERY PHASE. 
SO LINDA, PLEASE WOULD YOU SAY 
FEW WORDS? 
>> THANK YOU. 
ICS CAUSE MANY I -- EXCUSE ME. 
GOOD MORNING. 
SIR, AS THE DISABILITY 
COORDINATOR AND DIRECTOR OF THE 
OFFICE OF DISABILITY 
INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION, 
OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ENSURE 
THAT FEMA'S PROGRAMS AND 
SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO AND 
AUXESESSABLE TO PEOPLE WITH -- 
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITH 
DISABILITIES BEFORE, DURING AND 
AFTER DISASTERS AND IN TERMS OF 
FLORENCE IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE 
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR 
PARTNERS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL 
LEVEL AT THE TERRITORIAL AND 
TRIBAL LEVEL. 
WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND 
AGENCIES LIKE THE RED CROSS AND 
HHS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WITH 
DISABILITIES HAVE WHAT THEY 
NEED DURING EVACUATION AND 
DURING SHELTERING AND PRE- AND 
POST LANDFALL. 
SO PART OF OUR COORDINATION 
EFFORTS ARE TO ENSURE THAT WE 
ARE IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH 
OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO 
ENSURE THAT ANY UNMET NEEDS 
THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 
HAVE DURING EVACUATION OR 
SHELTERING AND IN TERMS OF 
RESPONSE AND RECOVERY ARE MET. 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY 
COORDINATE WITH OUR STATE AND 
LOCAL AND FEDERAL PARTNERS TO 
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WITH 
DISABILITIES WHO ARE IMPACTED 
BY THE STORMS HAVE WHAT THEY 
NEED TO SAFELY EVACUATE. 
THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED 
NOT SHELTERS. 
AND THAT THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY 
RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM THE 
EFFECTS OF THE DISASTER. 
>> THANK YOU LINDA. 
APPRECIATE THAT. 
THEN FINALLY OUR NEXT UP -- 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
RANDY CHEATHAM. 
>> THANK YOU MR. LONG AND GOOD 
MORNING, MY NAME IS REGGIE 
CHEATHAM THE DIRECTOR OF THE 
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. 
EPA. 
IT'S THE LEAD FEDERAL AGENCY 
FOR INLAND RELEASES OF OIL AND 
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES THROUGH 
EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTION 10. 
UNDER THE NATIONAL RESPONSE 
FRAMEWORK. 
IN ADDITION TO REQUESTS FOR 
ASSISTANCE FROM OUR STATES, 
TRIBES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
PARTNERS, SOME OF THIS THINGS 
THAT EPA IS CURRENTLY DOING 
PRIOR TO HURRICANE FLORENCE IS 
TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF 
PREPARATION AT CHEMICAL, OIL, 
AND PRODUCTION FACILITIES THAT 
MAY BE IN THE PATH OF THE 
STORM. 
AND TO IDENTIFY ANY RELEASES 
AND DISCHARGES OF HAZARDOUS 
SUBS STANCES OR OIL CAUSED BY 
THE STORM. 
THE AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED SITES 
UNDER SUPERFUND RISK MANAGEMENT 
PROGRAM AND THE FACILITY 
RESPONSE PLAN PROGRAM FOR OIL 
THAT MAY BE IN THE CONCURRENT 
PROJECTED PATH OF THE 
HURRICANE. 
AND WE'RE TRYING TO ASSESS ANY 
PRE-LANDFALL CONCERNS. 
IN ADDITION, WE'RE WORKING WITH 
THE STATES TRIBES AND LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS TO IDENTIFY 
DRINKING WATER AND WASTE WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAY BE IN 
THE CURRENT PATH OF THE STORM. 
WE HAVE ISSUED FOUR FUEL 
WAIVERS. 
THE PURPOSE IS TO HELP ENSURE 
THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE FUEL 
SUPPLY AND GASOLINE IN THE 
AFFECTED AREAS UNTIL THE NORMAL 
SUPPLY TO THE REGION CAN BE 
RESTORED. 
CURRENTLY EPA'S EMERGENCY 
OPERATIONS CENTERS THAT 
HEADQUARTERS HERE IN 
WASHINGTON, D.C., IN EPA REGION 
3, PHILADELPHIA, AND EPA REGION 
4, ATLANTA, GEORGIA ARE ALL 
ACTIVATED. 
WE HAVE TEAMS OF ON SCENE 
COORDINATORS AND EQUIPMENT 
READY TO DEPLOY. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO COORDINATE 
WITH AND SUPPORT OUR FEDERAL, 
STATE, TRIBAL AND LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AS NEEDS 
ARISE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> AND THEN LAST UP, OUR FEMA 
SPANISH LANGUAGE UPDATE. 
DANIEL GARCIA -- 
 
>> ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO 
PULL AWAY FROM THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE BUT WHAT WE'RE 
TEARING IS THAT SOMETIME 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON IS WHEN THEY 
EXPECT THIS HURRICANE TO MAKE 
LANDFALL. 
IT'S STILL AT A CATEGORY 2. BUT 
YOU KNOW, THAT STILL MEANS THAT 
IT'S GOING TO BE A RAINMAKER SO 
THE WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN A 
LITTLE BIT AND IT'S REALLY JUST 
SORT OF A ONE MILE AN HOUR AWAY 
FROM BEING CATEGORY 3. THE 
WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN BUT THE 
STORM SURGE AND FLOODING STILL 
A MAJOR RISK. 
>> SO LET'S GET MORE ON THIS 
FROM MOLA LENGHI JOINING US NOW 
FROM WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
WHAT'S THE WEATHER LIKE WHERE 
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW? 
IT'S HARD TO TELL. 
BUT IT LOOKS SO FAR CALM. 
BUT WE KNOW THAT FLORENCE IS 
APPROACHING THE COAST. 
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT VLAD. 
AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE 
PICTURES HERE, IT IS CALM. 
IT'S STILL RELATIVELY MILD AND 
YOU KNOW WE'VE NOTICED 
CONDITIONS STARTING TO TURN A 
LITTLE BIT HERE IN THE LAST 
FIVE, SIX HOURS. 
WIND GUSTS STARTING TO PICK UP 
HERE AND THERE. 
THE SUN HAS COME OUT ONCE OR 
TWICE. 
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, ABOUT 24 
HOURS FROM NOW, WE ARE 
EXPECTING TO REALLY BE IN FULL 
SWING HERE AS FLORENCE IS 
EXPECTED TO MAKE LANDFALL. 
>> WHAT ARE OFFICIALS SAYING 
ABOUT THE RISKS OF TRYING TO 
RIDE OUT THE STORM? 
WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW A HANDFUL 
OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT'S 
EXACTLY WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO. 
>> Reporter: YEAH, OVERWHELMING 
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ALONG THE 
COASTLINE UP AND DOWN 
THROUGHOUT NORTH AND SOUTH 
CAROLINA ESPECIALLY IN THE 
VULNERABLE COASTAL COMMUNITES, 
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY F 
PEOPLE HEEDED THE WARNINGS AND 
THEY HEEDED THE ADVICE. 
AND THE MANDATORY EVACUATIONS 
AND EVEN THE VOLUNTARY 
EVACUATIONS. 
AND THEY HEADED INLAND. 
THEY MOVED WEST AND THEY GOT 
OUT OF TOWN. 
YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A 
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 
RIDE THE STORM OUT AND 
ACCORDING TO THOSE PEOPLE YOU 
KNOW, WE'VE FOUND A COUPLE AND 
SPOKE TO A COUPLE. 
IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW, BECAUSE 
THEY'RE BEING NAIVE ABOUT THIS. 
OR THEY'RE BEING IGNORANT OR TO 
THE STORM OR YOU KNOW, SEEKING 
OUT SOME YOU KNOW, TWISTED 
SENSE OF ADVENTURE OR ANYTHING 
LIKE THAT. 
BUT THEY WANT TO BE CLOSE TO 
THEIR PROPERTIES. 
THEY DON'T WANT DO ABANDON WHAT 
THEY OWN. 
THEY WANT TO PUT EYES ON THE 
DAMAGE. 
THEY WANT TO BE FIRST ONES TO 
RESPOND TO THE DAMAGE OF THEIR 
PROPERTIES. 
BUT AGAIN, OFFICIALS ARE NOT 
MINUTING ANY WORDS ABOUT -- 
MINCING ANY WORDS ABOUT THIS. 
WE HEARD EVERYTHING OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS FROM THIS 
IS A MONSTER OF A STORM TO A 
CATASTROPHIC POTENTIAL STORM. 
THE POLICE CHIEF OF 
WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH WAS OUT HERE 
A FEW MINUTES AGO. 
AND WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHAT HE 
WAS -- WHAT HIS OFFICERS ARE 
TELLING THE FOLKS WHO DECIDED 
TO STAY BEHIND. 
IS THAT THEY WERE GETTING NEXT 
OF KIN NAMES. 
TO NOTIFY THEIR NEXT OF KIN IN 
THE EVENT OF THEIR DEATHS. 
SO THESE FOLKS ARE NOT IN TERMS 
OF THE OFFICIALS THEY ARE NOT 
MINCING ANY WORDS AND THAT'S BY 
DESIGN. 
THEY WANT TO SCARE PEOPLE INTO 
MOVING. 
THEY'D RATHER SCARE THEM AND 
HAVE THEM MOVE INLAND THAN HAVE 
THEM AND THERE NOT BE A STORM 
THAN HAVE THEM STICK AROUND AND 
YOU KNOW, PERHAPS POTENTIALLY 
SUFFER THE WORST. 
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE 
THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO 
HAVE FIRST EYES ON THE DAMAGE. 
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
HOLD BACK A STORM SURGE OR A 
FLOOD IN YOUR HOUSE. 
AND PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO GET TO YOU TO HELP YOU 
IF THAT HAPPENS. 
>> Reporter: YEAH. 
MAN IS NO MATCH FOR MOTHER 
NATURE. 
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. 
IT'S BETTER TO WAIT IT OUT. 
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 
BUT THE RATIONALE THAT WE GET 
FROM FOLKS IS THEY DON'T WANT 
TO ABANDON THEIR PROPERTIES. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STORM 
SURGE. 
I MEAN HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO 
ANYBODY WHO HAS DECIDED THAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO RIDE THIS OUT? 
WHAT THEY WILL DO IF THAT STORM 
SURGE HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF HOURS? 
>> Reporter: WELL, AGAIN, THIS 
GOES BACK TO WHAT WE WERE JUST 
TALKING ABOUT. 
THERE'S NEVER REALLY GOOD A EX-
- REALLY A GOOD EXPLANATION, 
THEY HAVE AN EXPLANATION AND 
FOLKS THAT WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
WILL FIND HIGHER GROUND. 
PERHAPS GOING UP ON TO THE ROOF 
YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THOSE SORT 
OF IMAGES WITH KATRINA AND WITH 
HARVEY. 
AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER STORMS. 
WITH YOU KNOW PEOPLE GETTING TO 
THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE 
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. 
THE WATER STARTS MOVING IN SO 
QUICKLY THAT THEY'VE GOT YOU 
KNOW, THEY GOT TO GO TO THE 
ROOF. 
SO IF THAT'S YOUR YOU KNOW IF 
THAT'S YOUR PLAN, THEN THAT'S 
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT FIND 
YOURSELF IN A LIFE-THREATENING 
SPOT. 
SO YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS WHAT 
PEPLE CAN DO, THERE'S NOT A 
WHOLE LOT YOU CAN DO ESPECIALLY 
YOU KNOW THE SOME OF THE AREAS 
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. 
SOME OF THE WORST EXPECTED 
STORM SURGE AREAS. 
THERE'S TALKING ABOUT 
POTENTIALLY 9, 10, 11 FEET OF 
STORM SURGE. 
NOW YOU CAN BOARD UP THE 
PROPERTIES AND YOU CAN PUT 
SANDBAGS DOWN. 
YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE COASTAL 
COMMUNITIES AND BEACH 
COMMUNITIES, YOU KNOW STATES 
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DONE 
A LOT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO 
MITIGATE YOU KNOW A LOT OF 
BEACH DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO 
MITIGATE SOME OF THE STORMS BUT 
A 10-FOOT STORM SURGE? 
MAN IS NO MATCH FOR MOTHER 
NATURE. 
THERE'S NOT A LOT YOU CAN DO IN 
TERMS OF PROTECTING YOURSELF. 
>> ALL RIGHT MOLA LENGHI 
REPORTING FOR US AT NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
>>> ALL RIGHT LET'S TURN TO 
ADRIANA DIAZ JOINING US LIVE 
NOW. 
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR  
LOCATION? 
>> Reporter: I'M IN 
JACKSONVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA. 
THIS IS THE NEW RIVER BEHIND ME 
AND IT LEADS ABOUT 10 TO 20 
MILES THIS WAY TO AN INLET THAT 
LEADS TO THE ATLANTIC. 
>> SO YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE WATER IS ALREADY PRETTY 
HIGH WHERE YOU ARE. 
IS THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS 
RIVER IS PROBABLY GOING TO 
OVERFLOW ITS BANKS? 
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 
WHERE I'M STANDING THIS DOCK IS 
GOING TO BE UNDERWATER. 
GOING TO BE THE EARLIEST AREAS 
ONE OF THE EARLIEST AREAS TO 
FLOOD. 
AND WE WENT OUT ON THE WATER 
YESTERDAY WITH WILDLIFE 
OFFICERS WHO WERE JUST LOOKING 
FOR HAZARDS ON THE WATERWAYS. 
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT EVEN 
THOUGH THIS ISN'T THAT CHOPPY 
YET AND YESTERDAY WAS EVEN LESS 
CHOPPY. 
THEY SAID NORMALLY THIS WATER 
IS AS SMOOTH AS GLASS. 
SO JUST IMAGINE THE DIFFERENCE 
THAT IT IS AND WHAT'S HAD TO 
HAPPENED TO START CREATING THIS 
MOVEMENT. 
I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE THE WIND 
RIGHT HERE. 
THIS REALLY WASN'T MOVING MUCH 
WHEN WE WERE HERE YESTERDAY. 
AND JUST IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, 
THE WIND HAS REALLY STARTED TO 
PICK UP. 
IT'S BEEN DRIZZLING JUST A 
LITTLE BIT THAT'S WHY I HAVE 
THIS RAIN JACKET ON. 
BUT THAT'S BEEN OFF AND ON. 
BUT YOU CAN TELL THINGS ARE 
STARTING TO CHANGE. 
>> SO WE KNOW THAT THE 
HURRICANE HAS BEEN WEAKENED TO 
A CATEGORY 2. DOES THAT LESSEN 
THE THREAT OF STORM SURGE FOR 
THE RIVER THAT IS BEHIND YOU 
THERE? 
>> Reporter: WELL, EVEN THOUGH 
IT'S LESSENED TO A CATEGORY 2, 
SO THOSE ARE STILL SUSTAINED 
WINDS OF ABOUT 110 MILES PER 
HOUR, THE PROBLEM WITH THIS 
STORM IS THAT THE WIND FIELD 
HAS ACTUALLY WIDENED. 
SO OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT WILL 
MAKE STORM SURGE WORSE THAN IT 
WAS BEFORE. 
SO THEY'RE EXPECTING UP TO 13 
FEET IN SOME PARTS OF THE 
REGION. 
AND THAT IS MAYBE EVEN WORSE BY 
THE MORE THAN 20 INCHES OF RAIN 
THAT'S ALSO EXPECTED. 
>> SO WHAT ABOUT -- YOU TALKED 
TO PEOPLE -- FROM WHAT WE SEE 
RIGHT IS THERE BUT ARE THERE 
HOMES IN THE AREA AND THE 
RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THAT 
AREA, HAVE THEY BEEN TOLD TO 
LEAVE OR WHAT'S THEIR 
SITUATION? 
>> Reporter: RIGHT. 
SO WE'RE IN ONS LOW COUNTY. 
A -- ONSLOW COUNTY. 
THERE'S A MANDATORY EVACUATION. 
WOE SAW PEOPLE STILL OUTSIDE 
THE HOMES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE 
BOARDING UP. 
BUT OTHERS LOOK LIKE THEY PLAN 
TO STAY. 
WE SPOKE TO SOMEONE WHO WAS 
ACTUALLY WORKING ON HIS 
SAILBOAT AND GETTING THE SAIL 
DOWN TO TRY TO MINIMIZE 
MOVEMENT WHEN THE STORM DOES 
COME. 
THAT SAILBOAT IS ANCHORED AWAY 
FROM HOMES AND THAT PERSON TOLD 
US THAT THEY PLAN TO STAY. 
HE SAID YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY 
THAT THE NEWS MEDIA CRIES OF 
OF, BUT HE CITIZEN -- WOLF. 
BUT HE HAS SAYS IN HIS 
EXPERIENCE EVERY STORM IS THE 
BIGGEST STORM AND THEN THE 
STORM COMES AND GOES AND IT'S 
NOT THE BIGGEST STORM. 
HE'S HEDGING HIS BETS AND 
ROLLING THE DICE AND HE'S 
STAYING HOME. 
I SAID WELL OFFICIALS SAY YOU 
HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE. 
HE SAID WELL, I'M TAKING 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR MYSELF AND 
MY FAMILY. 
AND HE SAID THAT STORM IS 
MOVING RELATIVELY SLOWLY AND I 
THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO OUTRUN IT 
IN MY CAR IF IT COMES TO THE 
POINT WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S 
COMING THIS WAY AND THEY HAVE 
TO STILL GET OUT OF DODGE. 
THAT'S WHAT ONE PERSON TOLD US 
AND WE'VE FOUND SEVERAL PEOPLE 
WHO ARE STAYING. 
SOME PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP AN EYE 
ON THE PROPERTIES AND NOT TOO 
FAR FROM THE BOATS. 
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT'S 
GOING TO THAT BAD. 
WHATEVER THE REASON OFFICIALS 
DON'T AGREE. 
THEY WANT EVERYBODY OUT OF HERE 
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. 
>> I DON'T GET PEOPLE. 
WHAT'S TAKING A COUPLE OF DAYS 
OFF AND GETTING OUT OF TOWN? 
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S A BIT OF A 
HASSLE. 
BUT -- 
>> YEAH ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE 
CHILDREN. 
I MEAN, YOU KNOW ALSO YOU ARE 
IN AN AREA -- SORRY GO AHEAD. 
>> Reporter: WELL -- I WAS JUST 
GOING TO SAY THAT THE GENTLEMAN 
I SPOKE TO SAID YOU KNOW, IT'S 
NOT JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS. 
YOU GET OUT OF TOWN AND YOU MAY 
NOT BE ABLE TO COME BACK FOR 
WEEKS. 
WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES ARE 
ALSO EXPECTED. 
THREE MILLION HOMES AND 
BUSINESSES MAY BE WITHOUT 
POWER. 
SO NOT THAT STAYING HOME WILL 
AFFECT THE FACT THAT YOU MAY 
LOSE POWER. 
BUT LEAVING FOR SOME PEOPLE. 
THEY THINK THAT IT MIGHT EXTEND 
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WILL TAKE 
THEM TO GET BACK. 
>> ALSO IN AN AREA THAT HAS A 
NUMBER OF MILITARY BASES.
>> Reporter: THEY DID NOT 
REQUIRE A MANDATORY EVACUATION. 
THOUGH MANY, MANY MARINES DID 
LEAVE. 
WE SPOKE TO ONE MILITARY WIFE 
WHO IS PROBABLY RIGHT NOW ON 
THE ROAD MAKING HER WAY TO 
BOSTON FROM ALL THE WAY DOWN IN 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
BUT OTHERS ARE STAYING. 
MY COLLEAGUE MARK COOPER SPOKE 
TO A GENTLEMAN WHO IS STAYING. 
HE SAYS HE'S NOT TOO CONCERNED. 
THE HEAD OF CAMP LEJEUNE SAID 
THAT THEY ARE PREPARED. 
THEY HAVE FOOD. 
THEY HAVE PREPARATIONS. 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT 
THE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN WHO 
ARE GOING TO STAY THERE. 
SO THAT IS OF COURSE A CONCERN 
AND IN VIRGINIA, THEY ALSO HAVE 
TO DEAL WITH ENORMOUS NAVY 
SHIPS. 
AND SO WHAT THEY DID A FEW DAYS 
AGO WAS ACTUALLY MOVED THOSE 
OUT TO THE ATLANTIC WHERE 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CIPHER FROM 
THE STORM -- SAFER FROM THE 
STORM THAN IN THE PORTS. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
>> THANK YOU ADRIANA. 
>>> AS EXPECTED HURRICANE 
FLORENCE IS ALSO CAUSING MAJOR 
ISSUES FOR TRAVELERS ALONG THE 
EAST COAST. 
ACCORDING TO FLIGHT AWARE, MORE 
THAN 800 FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN

AND NEARLY 600 HAVE BEEN 
DELAYED AS THE DAY GOES ON, 
THAT NUMBER OF COURSE IS 
EXPECTED TO GROW. 
>> SOME AIRLINES HAVE REDUCED 
FARES AND ELIMINATED SOME FEES 
FOR LAST-MINUTE TRAVELERS
