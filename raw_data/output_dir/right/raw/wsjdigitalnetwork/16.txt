00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,100
As an M&A reporter, you learn that scoops don’t heed social calendars,

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,520
so when I catch wind of one of the biggest scoops of the year,

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,340
naturally, I’m already halfway to my best friend’s wedding.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,280
It’s a summer Friday,

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,960
and we’re driving to the rehearsal

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,700
when a source calls and says that Warren Buffett

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,180
is about to make the biggest deal of his career

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,260
by buying Precision Castparts for $37 billion dollars.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,680
I have my friends pull over

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,740
so I can get out of the car and call my editor,

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,260
and we immediately start planning.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,240
Obviously, the timing isn’t great,

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,840
and when we arrive at the venue where we’re supposed to be rehearsing,

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,260
I’m off working instead.

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,340
Meanwhile, my editor, Dana Cimilluca,

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,820
is hunting for other sources to confirm what I’d been told,

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,020
and soon I’m pressing my sources too

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,460
because we don’t want to get scooped.

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,100
By the time we’re at the rehearsal dinner,

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,700
my phone is dangerously low on battery.

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,020
The only power outlet is in the women’s bathroom,

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,440
so I lock myself in there and continue making calls all night,

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,760
though without much luck.

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
The next morning, I get up early to keep at it.

25
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,340
Eventually, the ceremony is getting really close,

26
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,320
and I’m with the bridal party getting ready

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,780
when I finally get a call back from a source.

28
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,980
He confirms the deal, and adds, “Your Bunny has a good nose,”

29
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,990
which is an inside joke on Wall Street.

30
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,640
So I call my editor to get everything ready to go,

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
and he actually has to park his kids at a fast food play area

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,960
just so he can publish as soon as possible.

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,220
We break the story on Saturday afternoon

34
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,280
and it runs on page one of Monday’s paper.

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,180
And by that afternoon,

36
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,880
I’m already working on the next scoop,

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,840
because that’s what it takes to break eight of the 10 biggest deals of the year.

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,780
Oh, and by the way,

39
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,120
it was a really beautiful wedding.

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,380
My name is Dana Mattioli,

41
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,040
and I’m a Mergers & Acquisitions Reporter

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:00:00,000
at The Wall Street Journal.
