a branch of Norway's Student Union is in trouble for hosting an offensive party at the weekend the Nazi themed event included a menu with a picture of Hitler and drinks named blitzkrieg and outfits partygoers were greeted by doorman in SS uniforms and barbed wire fencing are being put up on the walls visitors were also given mock visas with an image of Hitler on them the party led to a furious backlash online eventually the Trondheim Student Union apologized and closed down the event then released a statement saying the unions got nothing to do with fascism and that the party was intended to mock Nazism an anti-fascist campaigner we spoke to says parties like these should always be unacceptable when the Nazis were expelled from Norway shocking that all those lives that were lost trying to keep the Nazis out that people the students in there would have so little respect and I think that people dressing up as SS uniform having outfits cocktails and death camp cocktails are not really a joking matter it's not about political incorrectness it's about making sure that we remember the people that lay down their lives so that the Nazis couldn't rule inside Norway and couldn't rule anywhere I think that we have to make sure that people respect those traditions as well
