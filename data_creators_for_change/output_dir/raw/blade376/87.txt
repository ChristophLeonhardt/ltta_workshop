00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
what is the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to</font>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,859
mind when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say the name move where if I</font>

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,029
was to say it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> but without the</font>

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,750
creepy voice Mitt Romney this man

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,429
believes he has what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes to be</font>

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,679
Barack Obama in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next American</font>

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,660
presidential elections<font color="#E5E5E5"> I truly believe</font>

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,279
that Mitt Romney and the Republican

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,230
Party<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nominated him or an insult to</font>

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,210
democracy in America oh so you're an

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,789
Obama supporter miles that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wrong and</font>

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,369
for two reasons one I'm not US citizen

13
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,080
and therefore on allowed to vote and to

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,210
I don't really see it as supporting him

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,159
when I just see him as the lesser of two

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,660
evils but let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with one</font>

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">person at a time all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right Mitt Romney</font>

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,559
he is known for<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a flip-flopper</font>

19
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,629
which means he has stood on both sides

20
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,120
of many many issues this includes the

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,100
economy I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> never supported the</font>

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,809
president's recovery act are at the

23
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,260
stimulus no time<font color="#CCCCCC"> nowhere know how I</font>

24
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,840
think there is need for economic

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,940
stimulus<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare well that's what we</font>

26
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,739
did in Massachusetts and that is we put

27
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,180
them together in exchange and the

28
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,489
president's copying that idea I'm glad

29
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,789
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear that Obamacare is bad news and</font>

30
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,500
if I'm president of the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,510
will repeal it and immigration I don't

32
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I've ever hired an illegal in my</font>

33
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,350
life we heard a lawn lawn company to mow

34
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,360
our lawn and they had illegal immigrants

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were working there and to me</font>

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,689
integrity is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important</font>

37
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,490
parts of one's character the fact that

38
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,799
Mitt Romney changes his mind on so many

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,830
issues so often makes me believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

40
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,100
vote for him is a wasted vote but yes it

41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,630
can be argued<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is no guarantee</font>

42
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,880
that any presidential candidate will

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,880
fulfill their promises one selected but

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,829
you can get some indication of how good

45
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,810
they'll be or how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their promises</font>

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,820
they'll fulfill by looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their</font>

47
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,159
track record and to me Mitt Romney's

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,250
track record is just schizophrenic and

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,659
you know what one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the saddest parts</font>

50
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,030
about the Republican Party is well at

51
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,610
least to me it's that there are so many

52
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,829
valid criticisms that could be made

53
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,920
about Obama's administration but the

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">Republican Party in Mitt Romney just</font>

55
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,030
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tackle any of them</font>

56
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">for instance barack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obama passed a</font>

57
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,500
massive bailout of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wall Street at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

58
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,199

59
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,360
officials from prosecution for torture

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,860
Obama blocked you

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,450
Human Rights investigations at

62
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,160
Guantanamo and he has cracked down on

63
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,020
government whistleblowers more than any

64
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,210
president in history and on the years

65
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,340
eve last year he signed the National

66
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,650
Defense Authorization Act giving the

67
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,350
military the ability to detain any US

68
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,240
citizen suspected of terrorism links

69
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">indefinitely without evidence and</font>

70
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,370
without trial but yes it would be very

71
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,200
naive of me to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,700
Republicans would have brought up any of

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">those issues because they would have</font>

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,410
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the same thing I actually</font>

75
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,120
really wanted Ron Paul to win the

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,220
Republican nomination this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

77
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,770
that's not necessarily because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree</font>

78
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,600
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything he says but because</font>

79
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,489
seeing him take on Barack Obama in the

80
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">presidential debates would bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

81
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,890
forefront issues that Barack Obama<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

82
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,380
Mitt Romney would happily sweep aside

83
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,180
issues like civil liberties and the

84
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,040
perpetual wards but the establishment

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,600
would never let it<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen though there</font>

86
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,520
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear examples of voter fraud going</font>

87
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,370
on and democratically elected delegates

88
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,340
were undemocratically unseated at the

89
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,410
RNC because they were Ron Paul

90
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,000
supporters then we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,220
presidential debates which are run by a

92
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,239
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporation called the CPD which</font>

93
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,519
is the Commission on<font color="#E5E5E5"> presidential</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Democratic National Committee's they</font>

97
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,070
get to decide who takes part in the

98
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,680
debates and what questions get asked so

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,690
is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any hope for third parties like</font>

100

libertarian Gary Johnson I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

101
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">so many people ask me why I should have</font>

an opinion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. presidential</font>

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,769

war drums for another Middle Eastern war

110
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,060
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> naturally going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel concerned</font>

111
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,500
about this presidential elections

112
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,230
