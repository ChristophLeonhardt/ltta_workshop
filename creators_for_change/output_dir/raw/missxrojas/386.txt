4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,620

pancake Taylor tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be</font>

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,730

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,740
x 48 out but generally when I'm making

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">pancakes is like a one-to-one ratio so</font>

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,400
i'll be making one they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating one</font>

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,230
this time I pissed myself a little bit

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,290
because there's like five bad boys over

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,030
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that pancakes though so</font>

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,989
even though they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not particularly</font>

16
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:49,010
stretch as they flow you up for the

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,360
whole day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> student budget it's</font>

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,680
quite nice to eat small little things

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that pull you off the whole day and I</font>

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,559
have cucumber in there so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just eat</font>

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,090
your cucumber like that's that's

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,020
nutrition right as an avid reader<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as</font>

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,610
a bookseller the second thing i can do

24
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,680
is book recommendation i lo<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Hunger</font>

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">Games what should I read next well if</font>

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to stick with a dystopian stuff</font>

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would recommend divergent by Veronica</font>

28
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,920
Roth if it's the concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,270
more than anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may be the maze</font>

30
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,950
runners if it's the teen fiction star

31
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,390
you like about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it while still wanting it</font>

32
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,710
to be a dystopia then I would suggest

33
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ugly series starting with uglies</font>

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,700
pretty specials and then extras that a

35
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">spice got westervelt if you like the</font>

36
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,580
fact that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really messed up then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

37
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,080
would recommend unwind by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Neal</font>

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shusterman I'm trying to read more</font>

39
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,869
classics what would you recommend there

40
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:28,070
are so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors that people think</font>

41
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,420
they've read but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually read</font>

42
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,860
Jane Austen is I think one of the

43
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,810
funniest writers of all time mansfield

44
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,130
park is on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find particularly</font>

45
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,040
funny emma is extremely good prejudice

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,990
is a story that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then you go</font>

47
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,280
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the text you read it and there's</font>

48
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,080
so much more in there so the whole body

49
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">of Jane Austen I would say and then also</font>

50
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,530
Charles Dickens full of detail full of

51
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,420
richness definitely full of humor

52
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,470
imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've been really eff</font>

53
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,580
scott Fitzgerald but have you read

54
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,260
Faulkner I only started reading focalin

55
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,180
quite recently and it was an experience

56
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,650
and amazing and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to read them</font>

57
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">all over again in terms of modern</font>

58
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,860

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">richard yates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is written it's just</font>

61
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,020
absolutely brilliant<font color="#CCCCCC"> i capture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

62
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,730
castle by do dismiss well nothing's

63
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,530
quite like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and quite as brilliant as</font>

64
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,209
it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> always try things by nancy</font>

65
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,800
mitford such as love<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a cold climber</font>

66
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,209
and a thing with the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling of the</font>

67
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,980
virgin suicides as you put it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

68
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,150

69
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,830
get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that strange weird</font>

70
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,060
feeling that it has going on also

71
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,409
because it's such a brilliant book class

72
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,849
i would recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> middlesex which is</font>

73
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,680
also by<font color="#E5E5E5"> jeffrey jealousies and i think</font>

74
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,180
is even better oh it's also just really

75
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,379
good in different ways the other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

76
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,550
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend which i talked about in</font>

78
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,670
laughter<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stephen mill houses that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

79
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you asked about short</font>

80
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,550
stories as well another thing i can do

81
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,780
which i haven't always been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

82
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,550
is be honest with myself and sort of

83
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,290
know myself for example every night

84
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,950
before I go to sleep I set the alarm

85
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,180
my bed which makes a really annoying

86
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,250
noise so then I also set six alarms on

87
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,019
my phone and put it far away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my bed</font>

88
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,489
so has to get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bed to turn it off</font>

89
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,110
the other thing related to being honest

90
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,640
with yourselves to do with money I am

91
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,080
self funding as a student which means

92
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,760
getting loans and grants and that sort

93
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,959
of thing which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that after the</font>

94
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,790
first kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two weeks of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year then</font>

95
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,709
I just avoid my bank account the feeling

96
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,120
of going<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto internet banking and</font>

97
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,650
checking my balance actually terrifies

98
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,870
me fills me with horror horror in order

99
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,610

100
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,769
