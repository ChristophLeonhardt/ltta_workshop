1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,280
in the last year this has really become

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,950
a reality on a major scale in Lancaster

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,549
California<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe how big the</font>

4
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:15,690
installation is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much power it</font>

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,670
produces how does that compare to fossil

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,470
fuel power production what we did was

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,109
take the concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having multiple</font>

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,060
mirrors track<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of software</font>

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,010
and made a prototype on our own roof top

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,630
on this building right here we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,130
mirrors tracking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roof about six</font>

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,349
months after our concept then we went

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">out to the desert and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we rented some</font>

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,739
land and we built a facility with 500

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,270
mirrors to test whether it would work at

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,910
full scale that test worked so in the

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,770
middle of 2008 we began construction of

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,290
a 24,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> mayor facility which is about</font>

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,309
an hour away from here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Lancaster</font>

20
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,980
California those<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 thousand mirrors all</font>

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,450
shine their sunlight each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about</font>

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">one square meter but the size of a</font>

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,930
plasma<font color="#CCCCCC"> screen TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mirrors are about that</font>

24
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,760
size and shape they all reflect their

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,350
sunlight to a single central tower this

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">is on 20 acres of land so imagine a</font>

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,730
field 20 acres it used to be a farm used

28
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,800
to be a carrot farm 20 acres of carrot

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,290
farm now have 20 acres of mirrors all

30
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,150
shining<font color="#E5E5E5"> their sunlight to a single spot</font>

31
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,780
that spot gets so hot it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would instantly</font>

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,549
melt steel steel would instantly be

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,960
dripping down to the ground if we

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">weren't running water through it very</font>

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,770
fast to cool the steel but turn the

36
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,020
water<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steam that power plant puts out</font>

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">five megawatts of electricity so 24,000</font>

38
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,549
mirrors on 20 acres produces<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">megawatts of electricity we are now</font>

40
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replicate that all over the</font>

41
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,630
world and we have orders all over the

42
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,159
world right now and how much electricity

43
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,380
is five megawatt five megawatts is

44
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,630
enough to power<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 4,000 homes an</font>

45
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,040
electricity that we're making at that

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,869
plant right now we're selling to

47
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,640
Southern California Edison<font color="#E5E5E5"> Southern</font>

48
