Vatican City
Pope Francis releases a landmark encyclical
on the threat of human-caused climate change.
It’s the first time the Catholic Church
has endorsed the science behind global warming.
He warns that a lack of environmental action
will have “serious consequences for all
of us.”
The encyclical criticizes world leaders for
failing to take action.
It’s hoped the Pope’s message will inspire
a “bold cultural revolution” on how we
treat the Earth.
“Human beings, while capable of the worst,
are also capable of rising above themselves,
choosing again what is good, and making a
new start...”
