1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,139
>>PATRICK MEEHAN IS A
REPUBLICAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA, I

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:06,910
WILL TELL YOU HOW HE WAS ACCUSED
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, HE DID A

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,220
SETTLEMENT, ALTHOUGH HE CALLED
IT SEVERANCE, AND THAT IS A

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,340
LEGITIMATE DISPUTE, AND THIS IS
THE KIND OF STORY THAT BEGINS

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,410
WITH A HA-HA BUT LET'S HEAR THE
WHOLE STORY FIRST.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,410
THE NEW YORK

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,930
TIMES REPORTED IT, AND THEY
EXPLAINED --

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:45,749
>>LOOK, I'M NOT SHY ABOUT SAYING
HA-HA, I JUST DID IT IN THE LAST

9
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:49,589
STORY ABOUT THE EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS WHO ARE NOW SAYING

10
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:53,059
FAMILY VALUES DON'T MATTER
BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP, AND BOY

11
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,670
THIS HAS HA-HA WRITTEN ALL OVER
IT.

12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,670
HERE IS A GUY IN CHARGE OF

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,129
ETHICS FOR THE REPUBLICANS, AND
ONE LEADING THE CHARGE ON THE

14
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:04,140
ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, IT
TURNS OUT HE USED TAXPAYER MONEY

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,979
TO SETTLE A CASE.

16
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:08,049
BUT LET'S BE
FAIR, LET'S DIVE INTO THE

17
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:09,810
DETAILS AND FIND OUT THE WHOLE
STORY --

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:30,170
>>I'M GOING 
TO QUOTE AT LENGTH

19
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,579
HERE THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE

20
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,240
PHILLY PAPERS AS WELL BECAUSE
THEY DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,490
COVERING 
THIS --

22
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:54,229
>>SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU
SOME OF THE 

23
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,229
DETAILS OF THAT

24
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,869
LETTER BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE THE
LETTER, HE IS THE ONE WHO GAVE

25
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,170
IT IN, IT'S A MIXED BAG.

26
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,299
NOW,
HIM GOING HOSTILE IS A

27
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,920
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,930
ALL THESE ARE
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES, YOU MAKE THE

29
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,720
CALL ON HOW YOU VIEW IT, BUT LET
ME KEEP GOING --

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:18,670
>>OKAY.

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:31,381
SO, THEN HE GOES AND
STARTS TALKING TO THE REST OF

32
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,300
THE PRESS ONCE THE NEW YORK
TIMES BREAKS THIS STORY.

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
SO IS

34
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
ANY OF THIS TRUE?

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,550
IT TURNS OUT A
LOT OF IT IS TRUE --

36
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:52,600
>>NOW, WHETHER YOU BELIEVE HIM,
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY, BUT HE

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,090
SAYS YEAH, I WAS INTO HER, BUT I
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

38
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,370
DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH OUR
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP.

39
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,370
MMM,

40
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,760
NOT SO CREDIBLE.

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,120
SO HE SAID, NOW
TALKING TO THE PHILADELPHIA

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
INQUIRER --

43
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,400
>>MMM, OKAY, THAT IS
PROBLEMATIC.

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:19,570
LOOK, I 

45
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,570
DON'T KNOW

46
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,380
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT HUG, AND
MY ULTIMATE CONCLUSION HERE IS

47
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,571
GOING TO BE TO LET THIS ACTUALLY
PROCEED IN TERMS OF AN

48
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:30,210
INVESTIGATION THAT THE ETHICS
COMMITTEE IS DOING, AS THEY

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,900
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH
AL FRANKEN, WE WILL SEE HOW IT

50
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,890
TURNS OUT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
ALL THE DETAILS.

51
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,890
SHE'S NOT

52
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,130
TALKING, HER BEING UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THE SITUATION IS

53
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,220
UNDERSTANDABLE, SHE HAD TO USE
HER OWN PRIVATE LAWYER WHICH SHE

54
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,820
DIDN'T HAVE MONEY FOR, IT
APPEARS BASED ON THE REPORTING

55
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,680
SHE TOOK ALL THE SETTLEMENT
MONEY AND BASICALLY GAVE IT TO

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,090
HER LAWYERS AND LEGAL COSTS,
ETC., SHE HAD NOTHING TO GAIN

57
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,450
HERE SO THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT
CONTEXT AS WELL.

58
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,450
BUT IF IT'S A

59
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,750
HUG WHERE HIS HANDS WANDER,
GONE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO.

60
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,750
IF IT'S

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,430
A LONG HUG, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
MAKE OF THAT AND THAT IS WHY THE

62
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,010
DETAILS ARE INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT.

63
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,250
NOW, THE LETTER.

64
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,250
SO

65
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,990
MEEHAN FINDS OUT THAT SHE IS NOW
DATING SOMEONE ELSE.

66
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,990
HE DOESN'T

67
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,900
LIKE THAT, AS YOU WILL SEE HE
HAS ADMITTED TO THAT A LITTLE

68
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,540
LATER TOO, AND ONE OF THE THINGS
HE DOES IS WRITE HER THIS

69
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,350
LETTER.

70
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:42,230
WHAT IS IN IT?

71
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,200
HE SAYS
--

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,280
>>NOW, THAT'S WEIRD TO CALL HER
A PARTNER BUT SHE'S AN IMPORTANT

73
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,170
PART OF THE OFFICE AND IT IS
ARGUABLE THAT THEY WERE PARTNERS

74
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,540
IN THE OFFICE IN THAT SENSE.

75
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,991
HE
SAYS SHE WAS THE GATEKEEPER IN

76
00:04:56,991 --> 00:05:01,720
THE OFFICE, NOT SOME LOW-LEVEL
STAFFER THAT YOU WOULD THINK IS

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,030
EVEN WEIRDER TO CALL A PARTNER.

78
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,910
BUT THIS IS WHERE I BEGIN TO

79
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,690
PAUSE IN THIS STORY, I WANTED TO
DO THIS STORY BECAUSE I WAS

80
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,760
LIKE, PERFECT, A REPUBLICAN IN
CHARGE OF ETHICS AND SEXUAL

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,600
HARASSMENT WHO USED TAXPAYER
MONEY TO SETTLE SEXUAL

82
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
HARASSMENT.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,620
I THOUGHT THE LETTER
WAS GOING TO BE DAMNING, THOUGH.

84
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,460
IT WAS MORE SCHMOOPY THAN
ANYTHING.

85
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,130
BUT AS A BOSS, DON'T

86
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,310
BE SCHMOOPY WITH SOMEONE WHO
WORKS UNDER YOU, BY THE WAY.

87
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,310
BUT

88
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:40,190
IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I WAS
EXPECTING.

89
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,190
HE WENT ON TO SAY --

90
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:52,040
>>YOU SEE WHERE HE'S GOING WITH
THAT, THAT ISN'T GOOD.

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
TELLING

92
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,640
HER AS WE TRAVEL TOGETHER IN
THIS PATH, MAYBE OUR WHOLE STORY

93
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,030
ISN'T WRITTEN YET -- DON'T DO
THAT.

94
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,360
TERRIBLE IDEA, IT'S

95
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,410
TOTALLY WRONG.

96
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,410
NOW --

97
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:15,200
>>I BELIEVE THAT 
HE WANTED TO

98
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,590
KEEP THE ISSUE PRIVATE, FOR A

99
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,440
LOT OF REASONS.

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,780
THE WHOLE POINT
OF, LIKE, YOU ARE MY SOULMATE,

101
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,330
YOU ARE THIS AND THAT, I'M SO
INTO YOU, BUT I WANT TO REMAIN

102
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,750
LOYAL TO MY WIFE -- BUT THAT'S
WHY I PAUSE HERE.

103
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,370
BECAUSE

104
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,740
WHETHER HE WANTS TO REMAIN LOYAL
TO HIS WIFE OR NOT, THAT'S

105
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,180
BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE, HE'S A
REPUBLICAN, I DON'T AGREE WITH

106
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,510
HIM ON ANYTHING, BUT I DON'T
CARE IF HE FELL IN LOVE WITH

107
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,780
SOMEONE ELSE.

108
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,389
FALLING IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE WHO WORKS

109
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,410
UNDERNEATH YOU IS A DIFFERENT
ISSUE, AND THAT'S WHY I THINK

110
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,230
THIS IS A DIFFERENT SCENARIO
HERE.

111
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,230
HE EXPLAINED --

112
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,580
>>COME ON, COME ON.

113
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:07,740
IF SHE HAD
SAID YES, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN

114
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,370
ALL OVER IT, IT'S SUPER OBVIOUS
FROM THE LETTER AND EVERYTHING

115
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,639
ELSE.

116
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,910
I GET IT, YOU'RE MARRIED,
YOU HAVE THREE KIDS, YOU HAVE TO

117
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,910
BACKPEDAL.

118
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,910
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

119
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,910
AND IT'S THE SAME THING I SAID

120
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,910
ABOUT CLINTON.

121
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,760
ALL MY GOD, HE
LIED ABOUT SEX -- WHAT ELSE WAS

122
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
HE GOING TO DO?

123
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,830
OH, I SLEPT WITH
MONICA LEWINSKY, I WANT THE

124
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,330
WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW.

125
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,000
SO
BACKPEDALING, I GET IT IN REGARD

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,120
TO HIS WIFE.

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,000
ALSO --

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,699
>>THIS IS THE ONE I CALL THE
MOST B.S. ON.

129
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,699
I DON'T KNOW WHAT

130
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,900
HE DID, IT SEEMS LIKE HE YELLED,
THAT'S WHY HE NEEDED AN

131
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
INVESTIGATION.

132
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
WHAT DID HE YELL?

133
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,710
WHAT DOES ROUGH MEAN?

134
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,710
BUT THE

135
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,810
EXCUSE THAT I WAS UNDER A LOT OF
STRESS BECAUSE OF A VOTE -- NO,

136
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,520
HE GOT PISSED THAT SHE HAD A
BOYFRIEND, HE WAS IN LOVE WITH

137
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,360
HER, SO HE TOOK IT OUT ON HER.

138
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
THAT'S WHERE IT APPEARS TO

139
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,090
DEFINITELY CROSS THE LINE, BUT
ONLY FROM THE THINGS WE KNOW,

140
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,060
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HER SIDE.

141
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,979
HENCE AN INVESTIGATION, ALL

142
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,300
RIGHT --

143
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,970
>>NO, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
DOMESTIC ABUSE SITUATION.

144
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,970
NOW,

145
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,210
THERE'S NO CHARGE THAT HE HIT
HER OR TOUCHED HER OTHER THAN

146
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,120
THE HUG SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR
ABOUT THAT, THAT'S WHY THIS IS

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,930
NOT NECESSARILY AN OPEN AND SHUT
CASE.

148
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,040
IT MIGHT STILL BE ONCE YOU

149
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,679
GET INTO THE INVESTIGATION, BUT
THE WHOLE TALK ABOUT YOU TAKE IT

150
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,698
OUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE YOU CARE
ABOUT, THAT'S TERRIBLE TALK.

151
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:39,698
HE SAID --

152
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:50,319
>>I GET IT, DUDE, YOU'RE
TOTALLY IN LOVE.

153
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,519
OKAY --

154
00:08:52,519 --> 00:09:05,480
>>THAT PART OF THE 
STORY SEEMS

155
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,149
VERY CLEAR.

156
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,149
AND I DON'T WANT YOU

157
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,170
TO TAKE THESE WORDS IN THE WRONG
WAY -- HE WAS SMITTEN WITH HER.

158
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,570
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WAS
INNOCENT, YOU DON'T GET TO BE

159
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,140
SMITTEN WITH SOMEONE AND ACT OUT
ON IT.

160
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,140
YOU CAN BE SMITTEN IN

161
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,550
YOUR OWN HEAD ALL YOU WANT, BUT
YOU DON'T GET TO ACT OUT ON IT.

162
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,499
SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ACT OUT
IN THIS CASE?

163
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:26,730
LET'S GET TO THAT

164
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,730
--

165
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:39,930
>>DUDE, YOU DON'T TELL ANYONE
YOU ARE A SOULMATE UNLESS YOU

166
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,399
WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.

167
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,920
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ARE PASSING

168
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,889
SOME PERSON ON THE STREET, BY
THE WAY, YOU ARE MY SOULMATE --

169
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:50,290
NO, NO, I DON'T WANT TO EVEN
TALK TO YOU, JUST GOING.

170
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,320
OF

171
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,790
COURSE THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY TO
SOMEONE WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE

172
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,529
WITH THEM.

173
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,529
ANYWAY --

174
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:06,290
>>WHY WOULD YOUR BOSS NEED
ANY TIME FOR HIM TO ACCEPT THAT

175
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,929
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

176
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,670
FIRST OF
ALL, WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF HIS?

177
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,529
SECOND OF ALL, WHY DOES HE NEED
TO PROCESS THAT FOR SO LONG?

178
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,100
THIS PART OF THE STORY IS SUPER
CLEAR --

179
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:23,459
>>NO, DUDE, YOU SHOULD REPAY IT
NO MATTER WHAT.

180
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,899
LOOK, I GUESS IF

181
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,230
IT WAS A SEVERANCE, THAT IS IN
THE PURVIEW OF THE HOUSE AND HIS

182
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,519
JOB.

183
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,639
BUT IT'S A SETTLEMENT, I
DON'T CARE IF YOU DID IT SO YOUR

184
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,980
WIFE WOULDN'T FIND OUT OR
WHATEVER, THE TAXPAYERS HAVE

185
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,240
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,819
IF IT'S
A SETTLEMENT YOU SHOULD PAY IT

187
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,269
NO MATTER WHAT THE ETHICS
INVESTIGATION CONCLUDES.

188
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:43,269
OKAY --

189
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:50,339
>>THIS IS THE NEW YORK TIMES
EXPLAINING THIS, SOME PEOPLE GET

190
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,930
ON HIM FOR THIS AND SAY HE'S A
HYPOCRITE --

191
00:10:51,930 --> 00:11:01,839
>>NO, ON THAT ONE I WILL DEFEND
HIM.

192
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,839
I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS

193
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:03,839
HE'S A HYPOCRITE.

194
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,519
IF HE HAD DONE
ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE THEN YES,

195
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,540
HE WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS,
TERRIBLE HYPOCRITE.

196
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,540
AND HE COULD

197
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
STILL BE A HYPOCRITE.

198
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,889
IF THE
INVESTIGATION FINDS OUT THAT

199
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:20,000
THAT HUG ISN'T A HUG, MORE THAN
A HUG, THAT HE'S A HYPOCRITE.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
OR

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,749
HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND PUT
HER IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE AND

202
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:35,230
HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT -- THAT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOOD WORK

203
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,480
HE DID ON THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE,
AND BY THE WAY I HAVE NO LOVE

204
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,939
FOR THIS GUY, I DO AGREE WITH
HIM AT ALL ON POLICY OR

205
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,779
POLITICS, WITH THE GOOD WORK HE
DID ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISN'T A

206
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,999
THING YOU COUNT AGAINST HIM,
IT'S A THING YOU COUNT FOR HIM.

207
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,809
BACK TO MEEHAN, WE ARE ALMOST
DONE HERE --

208
00:11:49,809 --> 00:12:05,410
>>A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET
ABOUT THAT TOO, BUT HE'S SAYING

209
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,069
SHE INVITED THE COMMUNICATION.

210
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,309
BUT A LOT OF THE HEADLINES ARE

211
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,309
MISLEADING.

212
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,170
THEY SAY SHE WAS
INVITING IT -- HE DIDN'T SAY SHE

213
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,629
WAS INVITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT,
HE SAID SHE WAS INVITING THE

214
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:15,629
LETTER.

215
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:18,920
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
TRUE, MY GUESS IS IT ISN'T, BUT

216
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,259
AGAIN YOU NEED THE INVESTIGATION
TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AND HE SAID

217
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,869
IT HURT HIM THAT SHE WASN'T
COMFORTABLE WITH ANY OF THIS.

218
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:30,319
FINALLY, HIS LAST QUOTE IS --

219
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:37,189
>>NOW, HE MIGHT GENUINELY
BELIEVE THAT, AND THEN REALIZE,

220
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:45,089
NO, IT IS WRONG FOR A GUY WHO IS
THE BOSS OF A WOMAN AT WORK TO

221
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,589
SAY, BY THE WAY, YOU ARE MY
SOULMATE, AND THEN GET ANGRY

222
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,369
WHEN SHE DOESN'T RECIPROCATE,
AND TO MAKE HER SO UNCOMFORTABLE

223
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:52,499
SHE LEAVES WORK.

224
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:55,670
AND I THINK
THAT'S WHY THIS IS INTERESTING

225
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,459
AND PRODUCTIVE ANYWAYS.

226
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,300
BECAUSE
I THINK GUYS LIKE MEEHAN,

227
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,980
SOME OF THEM, GENUINELY DIDN'T
KNOW THAT WAS THE WRONG THING TO

228
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,300
DO. AND IF YOU ARE AT HOME
GOING, NO WAY, THAT'S CRAZY, I

229
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,399
UNDERSTAND THAT.

230
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,989
BUT TRUST ME,
SOME OF THEM DON'T UNDERSTAND

231
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:15,050
THAT.

232
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,019
I WAS JUST IN LOVE WITH
HER, WHAT ARE YOU GETTING ON ME

233
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,019
FOR?

234
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:19,660
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T PUT
HER IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE

235
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,420
YELLING AT HER BECAUSE SHE HAS A
BOYFRIEND, THAT'S CRAZY.

236
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
AND IT

237
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,160
MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THAT.

238
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,649
THERE
ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES, YOU

239
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,499
HAVE TO BE FAIR TO EVERYONE
INVOLVED.

240
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:32,350
I DIDN'T FEEL GOOD

241
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,050
ABOUT THIS STORY, IT WASN'T A
STORY I WALK AWAY THINKING, WHAT

242
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,310
AN AWFUL HYPOCRITE.

243
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,310
I WALK AWAY
THINKING HE SHOULD REPAY THE

244
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,621
MONEY, THEY SHOULD DO AN
INVESTIGATION OF HIM AND FIND

245
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:48,329
OUT WHAT EXACTLY HE DID AND
PERHAPS REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE

246
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:53,209
IF SOME OF THIS IS PROVEN OUT,
BUT IT'S NOT A THING WHERE I GO,

247
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:57,529
WHAT A MONSTER AND HE SHOULD BE
TARRED AND FEATHERED AND NO ONE

248
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,299
SHOULD EVEN BOTHER TO DO AN
INVESTIGATION.

249
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,299
LOOK, EVEN IF HE

250
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:08,239
IS KICKED OUT, THE CONVERSATION
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY ONE

251
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:14,259
SITUATION LIKE THIS, WHERE GUYS
LIKE MEEHAN GO, RIGHT, I DIDN'T

252
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,239
REALIZE IT WAS MAKING HER
UNCOMFORTABLE, YOU MIGHT THINK

253
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:21,240
THAT IS DISINGENUOUS AND IN THIS
CASE IT MIGHT BE, BUT AT LEAST

254
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,850
FOR PEOPLE TO START THINKING
THAT WAY SO THEY KNOW, DON'T DO

255
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,649
THAT TO SUBORDINATES, DON'T USE
YOUR POWER IN THAT WAY, BECAUSE

256
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:31,720
YOU ARE AFFECTING THEIR CAREERS.

257
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,160
AND EVEN IF HE NEVER GETS IT,

258
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,999
IF WE HAVE THE CONVERSATION
NATIONALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

259
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:43,959
WILL BE AT LEAST AWARE OF THE
SITUATION THEY WERE NOT

260
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,019
ADEQUATELY AWARE OF BEFORE.

261
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,019
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE MOVEMENT

262
00:14:47,019 --> 00:00:00,000
IS GREAT.
