GOING TO BE A MEDICAL STUDENT WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY YOU CAN PRONOUNCE ALL THOSE WORDS VERY WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT. NOW TO OUR OTHER TOP STRIKE OF A HUGE FOREIGN POLICY WEEK FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. HISTORIC OPENING OF U.S. EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM IS MET WITH VIOLENT PROTESTS ALONG ISRAEL'S BORDER WITH GAZA. DOZENS OF PALESTINIANS ARE DEAD, AND THOUSANDS MORE REPORTEDLY INJURED. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO MOVING FORWARD TO TRY TO DENUCLEARIZE NORTH KOREA. EARLIER IN JERUSALEM, THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE CROWD WITH A VIDEO MESSAGE PRAISING OUR COUNTRY'S FRIENDS AND ALLIES OUR COUNTRY'S FRIENDS AND ALLIE ALLIES. ISRAEL IS A SOVEREIGN NATION WITH THE RIGHT LIKE EVERY OTHER SOVEREIGN NATION TO DETERMINE ITS OWN CAPITAL. YET FOR MANY YEARS, WE FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OBVIOUS. THE PLAIN REALITY THAT ISRAEL'S CAPITAL IS JERUSALEM. THE UNITED STATES REMAINS FULLY COMMITTED TO FACILITATING A LASTING PEACE AGREEMENT, AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE STATUS QUO AT JERUSALEM'S HOLY SITES, INCLUDING AT THE TEMPLE MOUNT, ALSO KNOWN AS AVRAM AL SHARIF. Dana: SAYING THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE VIOLENCE RESTS SQUARELY WITH HAMAS. CHECK OUT PETER ALEXANDER. WE BELIEVE HAMAS IS RESPONSIBLE. IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY BEYOND THAT ON THE ISRAELI AUTHORITY? WE BELIEVE HAMAS IS AN ORGANIZATION IS ENGAGED IN CYNICAL ACTUALLY BEEN TO THESE DEPTHS. Dana: STARTING WITH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DAY OR SOME IN THE MEDIA'S TAKE ON IT. Jesse: KIND OF AN ASININE INNUENDO THAT THEY ARE MURDERING INNOCENT CIVILIANS. INSULTING. HE IS BETTER THAN THAT BECAUSE HE'S A PRETTY DECENT REPORTER, SO I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THAT. WHAT IS MAKING TRUMP SO SUCCESSFUL IS HOW HE BECAME SUCCESSFUL AS A BUSINESSMAN IN THESE TRANSLATING INTO BEING A POLITICIAN. HE IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND HE IS A MAN OF ACTION. THAT'S WHY HE IS RACKING UP THESE TANGIBLE VICTORIES. IN 1995, CONGRESS PASSED OUR RELOCATION ACT FOR JERUSALEM. IT TOOK THREE PRESIDENTS WHO DID NOTHING AND STOOD BY NOW. IVANKA AND JARED ARE THERE TODAY FOR THE OPENING, AND THIS COINCIDING WITH THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE CLASHING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BLOWUPS AT THE BORDER. THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED BECAUSE JERUSALEM I BELIEVE IS THE THIRD MOST HOLY CITY FOR ISLAM. THAT WILL BLOW OVER, AND YOU'LL GET THE PEACE PROCESS BACK ON TRACK. I THINK JERROD IS DOING A PRETTY NICE JOB. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE KUSHNER ACCORD. HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE THAT DONE, MAYBE ANOTHER NOVELL PEACE PRIZE THAT JUAN CAN BE ENVIOUS OF. I THINK THE PRESIDENT, WHEN HE DOES THESE THINGS, IT'S BECAUSE HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT OFFENDING THE STATUS QUO. I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WITH HIM DEFEATING THE CALIPHATE OR THEM, THE NATO COUNTRIES PONYING UP THEIR FAIR SHARE. OR TEARING UP NAFTA ARE RENEGOTIATING NAFTA. THESE KIND OF THINGS, HE DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE BALL BACK. HE ALSO SAYS THE OBVIOUS. JERUSALEM IS OBVIOUSLY THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. IT'S OBVIOUS WE NEED A BORDER WITH MEXICO. IT'S OBVIOUS CHINA IS STEALING JOBS. IT'S OBVIOUS NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AND NOW HE'S DOING THAT WITH THE MAXIMUM CAMPAIGN OF PRESSURE OR DIPLOMATICALLY, MILITARILY, EVEN THROUGH TWITTER. HE HAS BROUGHT THEM TO THE TABLE. THEY ARE GOING TO END THE KOREAN WAR. I THINK THEY ARE TOTALLY IMPLODING THEIR UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TESTING FACILITY. THEY ARE SEALING OFF THE ENTRANCES. IT'S A HUGE STEP, RELEASING THE HOSTAGES IS A HUGE STEP. NOW YOU HAVE THIS SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE. IT LOOKS POSITIVE. WE'LL GO IN THERE WITH CLEAR AND OPEN EYES. I THINK "THE FIVE" SHOULD MAYBE GO TO SINGAPORE AND BROADCAST. WE COULD ALL MAKE THE TRIP. Dana: DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT VENEZUELA WHILE WE ARE AT IT? MUCH EVERYPLACE. I WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH OTHER PRESIDENTS DOING NOTHING. I THINK THIS PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO SAY, THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT THERE WOULD BE MASS PROTESTS AND VIOLENCE THAT WAS AWESOME OF TODAY BUT IT'S NOT THE PARADE OF HORRIBLES PEOPLE ANTICIPATED, KIMBERLY. IT'S POSSIBLE THE PEACE PROCESS COULD GET BACK ON TRACK. THERE'S A BETTER PATH FOR THE PALESTINIANS IF THEY WANTED. THE OTHER THING THAT HAS CHANGED IS ALSO YOU HAVE NOW OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SAUDI TELLING THE PALESTINIANS YOU NEED TO GET ON BOARD WITH WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN HERE. IF YOU WANT A TWO-STATE SOLUTION, STEP UP. Kimberly: I THINK YOU MAKE AN IMPORTANT POINT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOMENT IN AMERICAN AND ISRAELI HISTORY IN TERMS OF HOW IT AFFECTS THAT AREA OF THE WORLD, IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS FOR SO LONG. I THINK THIS WAS A REALLY POWERFUL MOVE FORWARD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THE MORAL AND POLITICAL COURAGE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH THE PROMISE HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE AND HE FULFILLED IT. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL COMMIT TO BE A PERSON OF YOUR WORK, AS IT RELATES TO DEMONIC RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRY. IF YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU MAKE A PROMISE, YOU WANT TO WRITE I'M VERY HAPPY THERE WASN'T A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE. PEOPLE WORRIED THINGS WILL HAPPEN IF THIS OCCURRED. IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP NOT ONLY WITH ISRAEL BUT THE INVERTED STATES, THE SAUDIS BEING ON BOARD, AND NOW LET'S GET THE PALESTINIANS TO THE TABLE AS WELL. WHY NOT TRY? THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. Dana: THERE WAS SOME VIOLENCE. 51 PEOPLE HAVE DIED. THEY SAY THOUSANDS ARE INJURED IN ADDITION. MAYBE WE WILL FIND OUT MORE IN THE COMING DAYS. Kimberly: BUT DUE TO HAMAS. Juan: NO, THEY WERE SHOT AND KILLED BY ISRAELIS. Dana: WERE THE ISRAELIS DEFENDING THEMSELVES? Juan: THEY WEREN'T. Dana: HAMAS DOES TRY TO MAKE SURE THE MEDIA IS COVERING IT IN THAT WAY. Juan: YOU GUYS ARE SO ONE-SIDED I AM SURPRISED YOU DON'T FALL OFF THE EARTH. IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S SO CLEAR WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE ISRAEL IS ON THE OTHER SIDE LITERALLY OF A FENCE. THESE PEOPLE, YOU'RE 35,000 PEOPLE. IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN HAMAS, YOU TRY TO LINK IT TO A TERRORIST GROUP. IT'S AN EXPRESSION OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT THEY ARE BEING RUN OVER AND RUN OUT OF LAND AND PROPERTY THAT WAS ONCE THEIRS AND THAT THERE IS NO LONGER HOPE FOR A TWO-STATE SOLUTION. NETANYAHU HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR. PRESIDENT TRUMP IT LOOKS LIKE BY MAKING THIS HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE MOVE DOESN'T CARE THAT THE POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEL POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEB POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAET POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEW POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEE POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEW POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAER POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEE POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEG POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEI POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEG POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAET POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEO POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEB POTENTIALLY AS WE LOVE ISRAEE THE FORCE THAT NEGOTIATED SOME KIND OF PEACE. THAT BROUGHT FINALLY SOME PIECE TO THE MIDDLE EAST. INSTEAD WE HAVE ISRAEL FIRING AT IRAN IN SYRIA. SYRIA UP IN FLAMES NOW. WE HAVE UNSETTLED SITUATION HERE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS. WHAT HAVE WE DONE? WE ARE NO LONGER SEEKING PEACE. NETANYAHU APPARENTLY CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS. THE PALESTINIANS FEEL GREATLY AGGRIEVED, AND HAMAS NOW HAS MORE MARTYRS AND YOU HAVE EXTREMISM FUELED. I AM INCREDULOUS THAT YOU SEE THIS AS GOOD. Dana: I DO THINK Greg: I CAN RESPOND. Dana: I HAD A GOOD POINT. IT ISN'T IN ISRAEL IT'S IN ISRAEL'S INTEREST TO CALM THE VIOLENCE. SO THEY CAN LIVE SIDE-BY-SIDE IN PEACE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE BELIEVES THE STATUS QUO WAS ACCESS TO THE HOLY SITES IN JERUSALEM SHOULD REMAIN. I DON'T THINK IT'S AS BAD AS JUAN WAS SAYING. Greg: I WANT TO STEP BACK AND DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, EXACTLY WHAT THIS SAYS, WHICH AS WE BEGIN ON ONE SIDE AND WE END ON THE OTHER SIDE. THIS IS A PRISON. THIS ENTIRE ISSUE IS A PRISON OF TWO SIDES. EITHER ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO EXIST OR PALESTINIANS ARE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. THERE IS NO OTHER SIDE. THE INTENSITY OF MEDIA COVERAGE ON THIS ISSUE IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING AND INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. THE PUBLIC IS NOT AS INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE AS THE MEDIA MAKES IT OUT TO BE. THIS IS WHY WE DON'T HAVE ANY MIDDLE EAST EXPERTS. WE HAVE MORE MIDDLE EARTH EXPERTS AND MIDDLE EAST EXPERTS. YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN, THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE PROGRAMMING POTENTIAL WITH RETALIATION. YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU SEND UP THESE BALLOONS FILLED WITH BOMBS, YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT ON CAMERA, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. DOES THIS DISPLAY OF VIOLENCE ON THE SUFFERING THAT OCCURS HAVE ANY EFFECT IN THE LAND WERE FOUR DECADES OF VIOLENCE HAS BEEN HAPPENING ANYWAY. CLASHES ERUPT EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE JADED AND CONFUSED ABOUT THIS AREA. I RESIST THIS IDEA THAT IT'S A TWO-SIDED THING. THE SOLUTION HAS TO ADMIT THAT THE CURRENT WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS IS GOING NOWHERE. IT'S GOING NOWHERE. AS LONG AS THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE VIOLENCE, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE VIOLENCE. Dana: THE QUESTION OF JERUSALEM IS NOW OFF THE TABLE. Kimberly: NOT TO MINIMIZE THE VIOLENCE AND LOSS OF LIVES, WHAT HAPPENED TODAY. THE PREDICTION WAS THIS WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC AND WIDESPREAD AND CREATING AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF
