00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:09,539
HOUSE.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,507
JERMAINE WRIGHT OF CALIFORNIA

00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:11,241
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, DARRELL

7
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:12,008
ISSA.

8
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:14,711
HE SITS ON THE HOUSE FOREIGN

9
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:15,445
AFFAIRS AND JUDICIARY.

10
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:16,146
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.

11
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:21,785
THE HARDEST GUIDE TO FOLLOW.

12
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:22,385
YOU TALK ABOUT THE FREE

13
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:29,893
TRADERS.

14
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:30,894
THE FACT THAT HE IS AT THE

15
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:31,628
PRESIDENTS SIDE TELLS YOU THAT

16
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:32,362
TARIFFS ARE THE TOOL TO GET TO

17
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:32,762
FREE TRADE.

18
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:35,965
HIS VERY BEING IN THE

19
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:37,467
MINISTRATION SAYS THAT.

20
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:38,301
MARIA: ABOUT ISSUES ON CHINA

21
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:39,002
SPECIFICALLY?

22
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:39,669
THIS COULD GO ON FOR YEARS,

23
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,969
RIGHT?

24
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:40,670
DEALING WITH A DICTATOR FOR

25
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:41,971
LIFE, HE DOESN'T CARE.

26
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:43,273
>> WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO

27
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:43,973
MAKE CHINA DO WHAT THEY SAID

28
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:46,576
THEY WERE GOING TO DO.

29
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:47,310
I WAS IN CHINA A FEW WEEKS AGO

30
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:55,952
FOR THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM

31
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:56,252
THERE.

32
00:00:56,253 --> 00:01:01,891
AND XI TALKED ABOUT TAX CUTS

33
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:02,859
AND DID 45 MINUTES OF A SPEECH

34
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,593
NO ONE BELIEVED BUT IT SOUNDED

35
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:03,960
GREAT!

36
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,928
YOU HAVE TO HOLD CHINA

37
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:07,897
ACCOUNTABLE TO WHAT THEY SAY

38
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:08,665
THEY'RE GOING TO DO, NOT WHAT

39
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,432
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING.

40
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,400
WHICH INCLUDES SPYING ON US,

41
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:11,468
STEALING TECHNOLOGY, BULLYING

42
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,470
THEIR NEIGHBORS, THE MILITARY

43
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:16,139
ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH CHINA

44
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,209
SEAS.

45
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,076
THERE IS AN OLD EXPRESSION THAT

46
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:22,512
IN AMERICA WE ONLY DO TWO

47
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:22,946
THINGS WRONG.

48
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:24,147
AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL.

49
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:24,848
IT IS WHAT WE DO AND WHAT WE

50
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,951
FAIL TO DO.

51
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:31,321
THE LAST COUPLE OF

52
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:32,055
ADMINISTRATIONS FAILED TO TAKE

53
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:35,959
CHINA ON.EVERYONE IS EXPECTED

54
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,095
BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT IS

55
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:39,829
TAKING CHINA ON.

56
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,130
I WOULD RATHER MAKE THE MISTAKE

57
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:41,898
OF TAKING CHINA ON THAN THE

58
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:42,665
GUARANTEED MISTAKE OF NOT DOING

59
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,967
IT AND ALLOWING THEM TO

60
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:44,701
CONTINUE TO GROW WITH A FALSE

61
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:45,101
ECONOMY.

62
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:47,437
MARIA: GIVEN THAT WE DO SO THE

63
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,673
NEW USNCA, DOES NOT EMPOWER THE

64
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:52,141
PRESIDENT TO HAVE A UNIFIED

65
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:54,844
FRONT AGAINST CHINA?

66
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:55,979
HE IS WORKING WITH THE

67
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,113
EUROPEANS TRYING TO DO ANOTHER

68
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:59,883
DEAL ON TRADE WITH THE EU AND

69
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:00,450
THE SAME WITH JAPAN.

70
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,651
HE NEEDS ALLIES TO GO UP

71
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:04,153
AGAINST, DOESN'T HE?

72
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,089
>> HE DOES, BUT WE WILL NEVER

73
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,523
HAVE THEM.

74
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:07,457
THE FACT IS, THESE TRADING

75
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,192
PARTNERS WILL BE OUR TRADING

76
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:09,692
PARTNERS.

77
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:11,127
MOVING FACTORS FROM CHINA TO

78
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:11,961
SOUTH KOREA AND VIETNAM AND

79
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:13,396
OTHER PLACES WILL BE PART OF

80
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:15,899
THE SOLUTION THAT CHINA CANNOT

81
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,466
GET ITS ACT TOGETHER.

82
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:18,801
BUT THE COURAGE OF AMERICA IS

83
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:19,802
NOT FOUND IN EUROPE.

84
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:20,503
THE COURAGE OF AMERICA IS NOT

85
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:23,006
EVEN FOUND IN JAPAN.

86
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,675
HIS PEOPLE TAKE WHAT CHINA IS

87
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:26,743
DOING WRONG AND EVEN TALK ABOUT

88
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:27,510
THE WTO COMPLAINTS.

89
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:31,381
THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO JOIN US

90
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:32,115
AND AGGRESSIVELY DO IT THIS

91
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:32,649
PRESIDENT IS DOING.

92
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,383
AND THAT IS OKAY.

93
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:34,050
WE CAN THINK OF ALL OF THE

94
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,152
TIMES IN WHICH AMERICA LED AND

95
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:39,289
IT WAS LONELY.

96
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,056
BUT AT THE END OF IT ALL,

97
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:41,691
PEOPLE SAID WE ARE SURE GLAD

98
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:42,025
YOU DID.

99
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,192
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING

100
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:43,960
WITH TODAY.

101
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:44,561
I DO NOT WANT TO RAISE

102
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,796
EXPECTATIONS THAT SOMEHOW THE

103
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:48,164
EUROPEANS WILL GET -- IT IS NOT

104
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:50,266
IN THEIR DNA.

105
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,067
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE

106
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:51,734
SAME ALTERNATIVE TRADING

107
00:02:51,735 --> 00:00:00,000
PARTNERS THAT WE ARE.
