DANA PERINO, GREG GUTFELD, JESSE WATTERS, AND JUAN WILLIAMS JESSE WATTERS, AND JUAN WILLIAM JUAN WILLIAMS. THE WHITE HOUSE IS FIGHTING A BRAND-NEW BATTLE TO COMBAT INTERNAL LEAKS. PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKING A TWITTER TO BLAST STAFFERS FOR THE LATEST UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES. THE LEAKS COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ARE MASSIVE OVER EXAGGERATION PUT OUT BY THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IN ORDER TO MAKE US LOOK AS BAD AS POSSIBLE. WITH THAT BEING SAID, LEAKERS ARE TRAITORS AND COWARDS, AND WE WILL FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE!" KELLYANNE CONWAY IS WARNING BIG CHANGES ARE COMING AND THESE LEAKERS COULD BE KICKED TO THE CURB. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF LEAKS. SOME EXIST TO HER COLLEAGUES. SOME EXIST BECAUSE THEY DISAGREE WITH POLICIES. BUT NONE OF THEM ARE HELPFUL. I WILL SAY SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON IN THIS WHITE HOUSE BUT NOT AS BADLY AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING. IT'S NOT SO MUCH LEAKING. IT IS USING THE MEDIA TO SHIV EACH OTHER. YOU HAVE THE BLESSING OF COMING TO WORK EVERY DAY IN THIS WHITE HOUSE. DO YOU EXPECT PERSONNEL CHANGES? I DO. Kimberly: STRONG WORDS COMING NOT ONLY FROM THE PRESIDENT BUT HIS STAFFERS. HE'S VERY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE AT A TIME LIKE THIS YOU WANT TO BE FOCUSING ON ACCOMPLISHMENTS, GOALS, CAMPAIGN PROMISES FULFILLED. ALL THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THEN YOU HAVE THESE LEAKS WHICH MAKES IT FRUSTRATING. Jesse: AS COMEY SAYS, THERE'S A LOT OF WEASEL MOVES BE MADE AND THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE AND THERE'S REASONS FOR THAT. PRESIDENT TRUMP RINGS OUT THE BEST AND WORST IN PEOPLE BECAUSE HE ENCOURAGES COMPETITION WITH HIS STAFF. THE AN OUTSIDER BUSINESSMAN, HE BROUGHT IN 1,000 DIFFERENT FACTIONS. FAMILIES, LOYALISTS, CAMPAIGN PEOPLE, INSIDERS, MILITARY, IDEOLOGUES, NONIDEOLOGUES. WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY FACTIONS COMMIT ARE GOING TO HAVE THE DIVERSITY OF OPINION. TRUMP DEVOURS TV AND PRINT MEDIA OBVIOUSLY. ONE OF THE WAYS YOU INFLUENCE HIM IS TO LEAK. HE IS ALSO A TALKER. HE TALKS TO A THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY. HE'S ON THE PHONE, CALLING PEOPLE, AND HE'S EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL AND SPEAKS COLORFULLY AND BLUNTLY. A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN'T RESIST THE URGE TO LEAK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID. PEOPLE ARE INSPIRED TO LEAK. Kimberly: SO MONEY. Greg: A PHRASE FROM 1990. Dana: HE IS OUR YOUNGEST GUY. Jesse: AND THE INSTITUTIONS IN D.C., THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS IN LOVE WITH THE PRESIDENT. WE KNOW THAT COMEY HIMSELF HATED TRUMP PERSONALLY, THE FBI PEOPLE TOO, AND BAN LEAKED IN ORDER TO SIGNAL THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. I THINK JOHN KELLY TRUMP CAN SAY LOOK AT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA AND DIMINISH THEIR CREDIBILITY. OF THE SAME TIME, THERE IS FAKE NEWS. THERE IS LEGIT LEAKS. THERE'S FAKE NEWS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOURCES THAT ARE UNNAMED, UNVERIFIED, UNSUBSTANTIATED COMING FROM THIRD-RATE PLAYERS WHO HAVE AXES TO GRIND. THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE, YOU NEVER HAVE THIS PROBLEM. NO ONE LEAKED BECAUSE THEY WERE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE PRESS. EVERYTHING THAT CAME OUT OF THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE WAS SPUN POSITIVELY. Kimberly: THERE YOU GO, A WATER LOG FOR YOU. DAY NOW, PLEASE TRY TO MATCH THAT. Dana: MATCH IT? I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AIR TO SAY THOSE THINGS. Kimberly: MONEY. Dana: WHEN I WAS THERE, I WOULD SAVE THE WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS TEAM WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPER OR LEADING "THE FIVE," I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORTIFIED. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE NEWS. YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT TO BE THE NEWS. HE IS THE NEWS. THIS IS PART OF HIM. THE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS IS WITH THIS NEWS, THAT MUST MEAN THINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD ELSEWHERE. WE ARE NOT LEADING WITH OTHER DRAMATIC THINGS. WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ISRAEL AND GAZA IN THE NEXT BLOCK. I THINK THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF THEY ARE TALKING TO SOMEBODY IN THE MEDIA AND YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF A THRILL WHEN YOU SEE YOURSELF QUOTED, EVEN IF IT'S ANONYMOUSLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOMEONE THINKS YOU ARE IMPORTANT. THE REPORTERS KEEP GOING BACK. THEY ARE NOT FAKE. THEY ARE JOURNALISTS REPORTING THE STORY. THE PRESIDENT CALLS THEM TRAITORS. I WOULD ASSUME IN A SMALL GROUP LIKE THE ONE THEY HAVE, THEY PROBABLY KNOW WHO IT IS. I THINK MAGGIE FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES" KIMONO FOR TWEETS YESTERDAY WAS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE COMPLAINING MOST ABOUT THE LEAKS ARE ACTUALLY THE LEAKERS. I DON'T KNOW WHO IS GETTING FIRED. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PERSON WHO USUALLY COMPLAINS THE FIRST AND THE LOUDEST AS THE LEAKER. Kimberly: SO INTERESTING. OR SHOULD WE SAY MUY INTERESANTE OR SHOULD WE SAY MUY INTERESANT INTERESANTE. Greg: I AM NOT SURE IF IT'S A LEAK. I VAGUE ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WORKING AT MAGAZINES AND STORIES THAT GET OUT. PEOPLE DON'T CALL UP A REPORTER. THEY VENT OR THEY GO TO A BAR AND THEY TALK LOUDLY. THAT'S WHAT I DO. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS, TO JESSE'S POINT, THIS INTERESTING STUFF HAS COME OUT. TRUMP IS THE SHOW. HE IS THE SHOW. PEOPLE COME OUT AND THEY TALK ABOUT STUFF AND THEN THAT GETS PICKED UP. IT HAPPENED TO ME A LOT OF TIMES WHEN I USED TO WORK AT MAGAZINES. I WOULD TELL SOMEBODY A STORY AND IT WOULD BE IN THE MAGAZINE. WHY DID I TELL THAT TO THAT GUY BECAUSE HE GOT DRUNK AND THEN HE TOLD SOMEBODY ELSE AND IT ENDS UP IN PAGE SIX. THAT I HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF. Kimberly: THAT IS THE PINOT NOIR GAME. Greg: I THINK IT IS PEOPLE VENTING AND GOSSIPING. I DON'T THINK IT'S ACTUALLY Dana: DON'T THINK THAT ONE WAS, THE ONE ABOUT SENATOR McCAIN? Greg: I THINK SOMEBODY WALKED OUT AND WAS JUST DISGUSTED BY THE JOKE, WALKED OUTSIDE, SO I CAN'T BELIEVE DIDN'T CALL A REPORTER BUT SAID TO SOMEBODY ELSE, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THIS PERSON SAID. Dana: THEY HAD THREE SOURCES. Kimberly: THEY PROBABLY BACKED IT UP. OBVIOUSLY HAS TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE, THERE ARE PEOPLE TALKING AND IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO A POSITIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT, JUAN, FOR ANY ADMINISTRATION, WHETHER IT IS OBAMA OR CLINTON OR BUSH OR WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU ARE TRYING TO FOCUS ON GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. THIS IS A DISTRACTION. Juan: SEEMS TO ME ON SO MANY LEVELS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. TODAY IS THE FALLOUT FROM THE NASTY COMMENT ABOUT SENATOR McCAIN. YOU SAY OH, MY GOD. IT'S A LEAK. IT'S TERRIBLE. GUESS WHAT. THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT WAS SAID, AND THE FAILURE TO APOLOGIZE PUBLICLY FOR IT, SO IT'S LIKE LET'S PUT ON THE SHOWS IN THE ACT AND THE MASK AND WE WILL PRETEND THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. THE STORY IS THE LEAK. THE LEAKS HAVE BEEN THERE ALL ALONG. I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE LEAK. IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK I THINK THAT PRESIDENT, MAYBE IT WAS THIS WEEK, THINGS GO SO QUICKLY. THE PRESIDENT WAS TWEETING ABOUT THIS CHINESE COMPANY AND THE NEGOTIATORS WHO WERE TRYING TO MAKE A DEAL ON TRADE FOR CHINA. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? WHY THOUGHT IN THE PAPERS? YOU THINK ABOUT, HIS LIGHT SCHEDULE IN THE MORNING, EXECUTIVE TIME, THAT'S A LEAK. GEE, I DON'T KNOW. ROB PORTER, JOHN KELLY. HOW ABOUT HIS NASTY COMMENT ABOUT PEOPLE COMING FROM AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN, EL SALVADOR. HOW ABOUT JUST LAST WEEK, KIRSTJEN NIELSEN. SAYING SHE WASN'T GOING TO RESIGN. THEN JOHN KELLY CALLED HER AND ASKED HER NOT TO RESIGN. Greg: JUAN, YOU HAVE DRIFTED SO FAR. Juan: YOU ARE THE ONE WHO WAS OFF IN SPACE AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT. Greg: I NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. Juan: THESE STORIES ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE TRYING TO CHANGE THE STORY. THE WHITE HOUSE DOES NOT WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT SENATOR McCAIN. THEY WANT INSTEAD TO PRETEND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS UNDER SIEGE BY HIS ENEMIES. Greg: THAT IS WHAT I AM RESPONDING TO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY I AM OFTEN SPACE. THE POINT, THE IMPORTANT POINT, YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE THE ELEMENTS. THE LEAK FROM THE LEAKING. THE LEAK, A JOKE TOLD IN PRIVATE, THAT'S A SEPARATE STORY PRIVATE, THAT'S A SEPARATE STOR STORY. YOU CAN BE UPSET, JUAN, ABOUT SOMETHING SAID PRIVATELY OR OFF-CAMERA THAT ENDS UP IN THE PRESS. BECAUSE THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU AND IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND IT HAS HAPPENED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU SEE SOMETHING NEW BECOMES A BIG STORY BECAUSE SOMEBODY LEAKED IT. THE POINT OF THIS STORY ISN'T ABOUT THE ITEM ITSELF WHICH IS THE JOKE. IT'S ABOUT HOW SOMETHING PRIVATE BECOMES A PUBLIC STORY. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. Kimberly: THAT IS WHAT HE IS UPSET ABOUT. THE PRESIDENT IS UPSET HE CAN'T SEEK PRIVATE COUNSEL OR HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITHOUT SOMEBODY LEAKING IT. ANYBODY WOULD BE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THAT. THAT'S THE POINT OF THE WHOLE SEGMENT. GENERAL KELLY TOOK PEOPLE'S PHONES WAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, HAND SIGNALS, WHATEVER. THE POINT IS, STUFF IS GETTING OUT AND IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. Dana: ONE OF THE REAL DANGERS IS THAT IT DOES RUN THE RISK OF CHILLING CONVERSATION SO THAT IF YOU GO INTO A MEETING. YOU ARE IN THE ROOSEVELT ROOM AND YOU NEED TO KICK AROUND IDEAS FOR POLICY TIME, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE WHO SAYS I'M AFRAID TO SAY SOMETHING IN THIS MEETING. I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT LIKE THAT ABOUT SENATOR McCAIN BUT IF YOU SAY THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE OF XYZ, AND YOU ARE SHOOTING THE BREEZE IN YOUR BRAINSTORMING, AND IT GOES IN THE PAPER, IT RUNS THE RISK OF THE PRESIDENT NOT GETTING HIS APPOINTEES' BEST ADVICE. Greg: I WANT TO ADD TO THAT THAT I DO THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT CONVERSATION BEING CHILLED IS IMPORTANT. BUT WE HAVE TO ADMIT WE HAVE TOLD JOKES. EVERYBODY TELLS A SICK JOKE PRIVATELY. THEY MAY NOT REMEMBER THAT THEY DID BUT THEY HAVE. WE ARE SETTING A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. ALL OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE ARE TASTELESS. Dana: WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM TOOK THE JOKE. WHATEVER IT IS THEY DON'T LIE, SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM, THEY WERE WILLING TO GO OUT AND DO THAT. THAT'S A BIGGER INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM. Greg: YOU COULD SAY THE JOKE IS AWFUL. Juan: IT WASN'T A JOKE. Greg: IT WAS A BAD JOKE. Juan: NOBODY EXCEPT YOU WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS A JOKE. "JUST ABOUT DEAD," NOBODY TOOK IT AS A JOKE. IT WASN'T REPORTED AS A JOKE. MY POINT IS THAT WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT TALKS A GREAT DEAL. HE TALKS TO PEOPLE HERE AT FOX NEWS APPARENTLY REGULARLY. Greg: WHO ARE YOU REFERRING TO? Juan: I DON'T KNOW. I CAN GO ON EITHER SIDE OF ME. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PEOPLE IN THE KNOW WHO ARE STRONG REPUBLICANS, KARL ROVE SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS THE BIGGEST LEAKER OF ALL BECAUSE HE TALKS. WHEN I AM SAYING YES WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING CONFIDENCE. THESE ERIC TRUMP'S PEOPLE. HE BROUGHT THESE PEOPLE IN. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE POOR PRESIDENT. THE POOR PRESIDENT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. Greg: I NEVER SAID POOR PRESIDENT. Kimberly: HE IS TRANSPARENT. HE LEAKS ON TWITTER. HE TELLS EVERYBODY WHAT HE THINKS AND WHAT IS FEELING. HE IS THE PRESIDENT. THE OWNER AND THE KEEPER OF THE INFORMATION, SO IF HE WANTS TO TALK TO A REPORTER, MAGGIE HABERMAN OR SOMEBODY, RUDY GIULIANI, WHAT EVER COME OF THIS IS WHAT HE DOES. THIS IS HOW HE OPERATES. Juan: A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A HISTORICAL RECORD GAP BECAUSE THINGS ARE SO STRANGE RIGHT NOW IN THE WHITE HOUSE. Kimberly: THERE SHOULD BE A RECORD BECAUSE IT'S STRANGE? Juan: PEOPLE WANT THE HISTORICAL RECORD TO BE CLEAR. IT'S LIKE THE PHONE CALL WITH THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER. NO PROBLEM. TURNS OUT IT WAS A BIG PROBLEM AND SOMEBODY LEAKED IT BECAUSE THEY WANT OF THE WORLD TO KNOW THIS IS THE WAY HE TALKS TO OUR ALLIES. Greg: I HAVE WITNESSED THINGS SAID IN THIS COMPANY THAT PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
