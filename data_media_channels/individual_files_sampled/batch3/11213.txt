in less than two years my administration has accomplished more than almost any Administration in the history of our country America's so true didn't expect that reaction but that's okay Iran's leaders so chaos death and destruction they do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations instead Iran's leaders plundered the nation's resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond the or going tragedy in Syria is heartbreaking our shared goals must be the de-escalation of military conflict along with a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people in this vein we urge the United Nations LED peace process be reinvigorated but rest assured the United States will respond if chemical weapons are deployed by the Assad regime
