>>> NOW REPORTING GEORGE 
STEPHA
STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR 
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A SERIOUS 
ACCIDENT IN MIAMI FLORIDA.
THAT IS THE SCENE OF FLORIDA 
UNIVERSITY, A BRAND-NEW 
PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE JUST BUILT 
OVER THE WEEKEND COLLAPSED IN 
THE LAST HOUR.
IT'S ON 109th AVENUE AND 8th 
STREET IN MIAMI, TRAPPING A 
NUMBER OF CARS AND PEOPLE 
UNDERNEATH ACCORDING TO THE 
FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL.
THERE ARE SEVERAL FATALITIES 
CONFIRMED AND FIVE OR SIX 
VEHICLES TRAPPED UNDERNEATH.
THIS IS A BRAND-NEW BRIDGE, JUST
FINISHED OVER THE WEEKEND, THIS 
SATURDAY.
WE ACTUALLY CAN SHOW HOW THE 
950-TON BRIDGE WAS BEING PUT UP 
IN THOSE FINAL HOURS.
BUT YOU SEE THE DEVASTATION 
RIGHT THERE, THE BRAND-NEW 
BRIDGE HAS JUST COMPLETELY 
COLLAPSED ONTO THE CAUSEWAY, IT 
WAS APPARENTLY A BRIDGE 
CONNECTING VARIOUS PARTS OF 
CAMPUS TO OFF CAMPUS HOUSING AND
I WANT TO BRING VICTOR ON THE 
PHONE IN MIAMI.
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US?
>> WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE 
SCENE.
I JUST SPOKE WITH A SOURCE WHO 
SAID THEY JUSTIN STALLED THAT 
PART OF THE BRIDGE THAT CONNECTS
THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL 
UNIVERSITY TO THE CITY OF 
SWEETWATER ON SATURDAY, THE BIG 
PORTION THAT GOES ACROSS 8th 
STREET.
IT WASN'T OPEN JUST YET.
IT WAS SET TO OPEN AT SOME POINT
IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR.
THIS WAS A PROJECT BETWEEN FIU 
AND THE CITY OF SWEET WATER.
THEY RECEIVED A GRANT TO BUILD 
IT AND THEY PUT THAT UP VERY 
QUICKLY.
JUST ON SATURDAY IS WHEN THEY 
PUT UP THE PORTION THAT 
COLLAPSED AND IT CAME CRASHING 
DOWN.
AT LEAST SIX CARS TRAPPED 
UNDERNEATH PER MIAMI-DADE FIRE 
RESCUE. 
>> WE'RE SEEING ON A SPLIT 
SCREEN, IT WAS PUT UP IN A FEW 
HOURS, VERY QUICKLY, USING 
ACCELERATED BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION 
METHODS BUT IT ONLY BEEN IN 
OPERATION NOW FOR A COUPLE OF 
DAYS.
AND OF COURSE FLORIDA 
INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY VERY 
LARGE CAMPUS, 55,000 ENROLLED 
STUDENTS.
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
THAT AREA IN MIAMI?
>> IT IS A VERY BUSY AREA, THAT 
UNIVERSITY HAS ALREADY GROWN 
OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS.
IT'S BECOME ONE OF THE LARGEST 
UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY THAT
AREA RIGHT NOW IS ABSOLUTELY 
SPRAWLING.
TO THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
HAPPENED THERE, IT'S JUST 
DEVASTATING. 
>> I KNOW YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY.
I WANT TO TALK TO SCOTT WHITHERS
ON THE PHONE AT FLORIDA 
INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY.
TELL US WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. 
>> GEORGE, THEY ARE PUSHING US 
BACK.
I WAS 100 FEET.
I CAN SEE AT LEAST FOUR CARS AND
DIFFERENT SIZES LIKE A MINI VAN,
LOOKS LIKE A LARGE PANEL TRUCK 
IS ALSO JUST SMUSHED UNDERNEATH 
THIS.
THIS IS A BRIDGE AS VICTOR WAS 
SAYING THAT WAS UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION.
YOU CAN STILL SEE SOME OF THE 
SCAFFOLDING ON THE SIDE.
THERE ARE CRANES ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE BRIDGE.
I TALKED TO SOME OF THE 
WITNESSES THAT SAID THEY DIDN'T 
HEAR ANYTHING, THEY DIDN'T SEE 
ANYTHING LEADING UP TO IT.
IT JUST FELL.
AND FELL VERY QUICKLY.
I TALKED -- THERE ARE SOME OF 
THE POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRE 
RESCUE PEOPLE HERE, THEY ARE 
SAYING THAT THERE ARE CONFIRMED 
NEY TALTSS FATALITIES ON THE 
SCREEN.
THIS IS A BUSY ROAD, 8th STREET 
IN SOUTHWEST MIAMI.
IT'S OVER -- IT CONNECTS SAY 
BRAND-NEW PARKING GARAGE OVER TO
THE OTHER SIDE THEY ARE STILL 
TAKING STRETCHERS IN AND 
BRINGING PEOPLE OUT.
ONE WOMAN WAS SITTING UP AND 
TALKING TO THE PARAMEDICS AND 
SHE WAS OKAY.
THERE'S NO WAY SOME OF THE 
PEOPLE MADE IT OUT OF THESE 
CARS. 
>> STAND BY, I WANT TO BRING IN 
T
TAEON NA PAGE.
YOU SAW THE BRIDGE GO DOWN?
>> YES, I LIVE AT 109 AND IT 
FELL AS IF THERE WAS AN 
EARTHQUAKE.
ME AND MY ROOMMATE JUMPED UP AND
LOOKED OUTSIDE.
S
SLNS I LOOKED OUTSIDE I SAW DUST
FLYING AND KNEW THE BRIDGE HAD 
COLLAPSED.
THERE WAS ONE CAR ABLE TO GET --
I GUESS THEY JUST HAD MISSED THE
BRIDGE AND THE BACK END OF THE 
CAR WAS SMASHED AND THE SCREAMS 
COMING FROM THE CAR WAS 
TERRIFYING.
I WATCHED EVERY ONE STARTED 
SPRINTING TOWARDS THE SCENE AND 
IT WAS SO SCARY BECAUSE IT 
HAPPENED SO FAST. 
>> THIS HAPPENED IN A MATTER OF 
SECONDS. 
>> A MATTER OF SECONDS. 
>> AND WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE, 
WE'RE NOW SEEING RESCUE WORKERS 
ON TOP OF THE BRIDGE.
DID YOU SEE ANYONE ON THE BRIDGE
OR WAS ALL OF THE DANGER 
UNDERNEATH AS IT COLLAPSED?
>> NO, THERE WAS WORKERS ON THE 
BRIDGE.
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO DIG 
PEOPLE OUT FROM UNDER THE 
BRIDGE.
I WATCHED THEM DIG A HOLE AND 
PULL SOMEONE OUT.
I WATCHED PEOPLE -- TWO PEOPLE 
HAD TO HAVE CPR PERFORMED ON 
THEM AND THERE'S STILL LIKE 
THREE CARS COMPLETELY SMASHED 
UNDER THE BRIDGE THAT THEY 
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO. 
>> THREE CARS THEY WEREN'T ABLE 
TO GET TO.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT 
YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE HOW MANY 
INJURED THERE MIGHT BE?
>> I KNOW THAT FOR SURE THERE 
HAS TO BE AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE 
DEAD.
ONLY BECAUSE THAT IS HOW MANY 
CARS WERE UNDER THERE, THERE'S 
NO WAY ANYONE COULD SURVIVE 
THAT.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE -- I KNOW
I WATCHED HELICOPTERS BE FLOWN 
IN.
THERE WAS A FEW PEOPLE FLOWN 
OUT.
I DON'T KNOW.
>> AND YOU SAY IT FELT LIKE AN 
EARTHQUAKE.
HOW CLOSE ARE YOU TO THE BRIDGE?
>> I'M ON THE 15th FLOOR.
I LIVE ON THE 15th FLOOR OF THIS
APARTMENT COMPLEX.
SO THAT -- I WAS PRETTY FAR UP 
AND BASICALLY RIGHT OVER THE 
INTERSECTION. 
>> AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
HAPPENED OR NO?
>> NO, I COULD ONLY THINK THAT 
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A 
MISCALCULATION OF SOME SORT, A 
FATAL ONE AT THAT. 
>> THANK YOU FOR QUICKLY CALLING
IN TO US AND SHARING YOUR STORY.
WE APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION 
YOU'RE ABLE TO GIVE US.
WE HEARD FROM RICK SCOTT THE 
GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA SAYS HE'S 
SPOKEN WITH THE MIAMI-DADE 
POLICE CHIEF ABOUT THIS 
COLLAPSE.
WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL
THROUGH THE DAY.
WHAT KIND OF PRESENCE ARE YOU 
SEEING THERE ON THE O SCENE?
>> GEORGE, YOU NAME IT IT'S 
HERE.
WE HAVE MIAMI-DADE FIRE RESCUE 
AND LOCAL POLICE.
30 TO 40 ACTIVE VEHICLES RIGHT 
WHERE I'M AT.
THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT A LOT OF 
ACTIVITY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT
WERE -- THE PEOPLE THAT WERE 
TRAPPED UNDER THE CAR -- THE 
CARS ARE STILL UNDER THE BRIDGE.
THERE WAS NO ONE WALKING REALLY 
OVER BECAUSE IT WASN'T OPEN TO 
THE PUBLIC YET.
SO ALL OF THE ACTIVITY NOW IS 
FOCUSED ON AS THE WOMAN WAS 
SAYING ON THOSE CARS -- I CAN 
STILL SEE THEM, THEY ARE 
PANCAKED UNDER THIS BRIDGE.
AND PRIMARILY, IF YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THIS BRIDGE, THE NORTH 
SECTION OF IT IS WHERE IT 
APPEARS MOST OF THE COLLAPSE 
BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF CRUMBLED.
THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF IT IS 
ALL IN ONE PIECE LEANING DOWN 
ONTO THE ROAD.
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL IF 
THERE WAS A SUPPORT BEAM IN THE 
MIDDLE HOLDING THIS UP.
IT'S A VERY WIDE ROAD AND 
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SPACE SPORE
A SUPPORT BEAM IF THERE WAS ONE 
THERE.
THAT WHOLE SECTION FROM THE 
MIDDLE OF THE ROADS TOWARDS THE 
NORTH END IS GONE.
IT'S ALL DOWN.
I'M SEEING THIS LARGE PANEL 
TRUCK AND IT'S BEEN COMPRESSED 
DOWN TO MAYBE 2 OR 3 FEET.
IF YOU KNOW WHAT SIZE A PANEL 
TRUCK IS, IT'S JUST SMASHED.
>> THAT CAME DOWN WITH SUCH 
POWER.
>> EXTREME POWER AND CAME DOWN 
QUICKLY.
THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO SAID IT 
WAS INSTANTOUS AND IT WAS LOUD 
AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD
DO.
IT WAS PANDEMONIUM THEY ARE 
TELLING ME AND THEY RAN AS 
QUICKLY AS THEY COULD TO TRY AND
HELP BUT THE PEOPLE PINNED UNDER
IN THEIR CACARS, THERE WAS NO W 
TO GET TO THEM. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN.

COLLAPSE IN MIAMI FLORIDA,
