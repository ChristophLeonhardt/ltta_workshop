CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU SAW?

13
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,804
>> IT'S ABOUT AS BAD AS IT GETS.

14
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,574
I WAS THERE FRIDAY, PANAMA CITY.

15
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:29,379
HERE IN JACKSON COUNTY, YOU SEE

16
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,249
TREMENDOUS DEVASTATION IN THE

MAIN STREET, DOWNTOWN.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,591
I WAS IN ANOTHER ROOM.

00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:42,125
FIREFIGHTERS CAME OVER TO BE

20
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:42,559
HELPFUL.

21
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,395
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT LIES

22
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:46,163
AHEAD.

23
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:54,104
PEOPLE NEED TO POWER BACK.

24
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:56,006
IT'S ABOUT REBUILDING THE ENTIRE

25
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:56,406
GRID.

26
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:59,209

AND THE SOUTHEAST GET IN THERE

30
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:12,322
AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN.

31
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,056
LOOKS FROM THE IMAGES WE'VE SEEN

32
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:13,757
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE IT WILL

33
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:14,491
TAKE WEEKS, MONTHS, MAYBE YEARS

34
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:15,192
FOR THEM TO GET BACK ON THEIR

35
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:15,759
FEET.

00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,267
START TO GET POWER ROLLING IN.

40
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:25,636
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE COMMITS

41
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:28,071
A TOTAL REBUILD OF THE SYSTEM.

42
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,239
THERE IS STUFF EVERYWHERE.

43
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,940
MANY OF THESE STRUCTURES, YOU

44
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,308
CAN EVEN TURN THE POWER ON

45
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,643
BECAUSE IT COULD START A FIRE

46
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:33,443
AND HURT SOMEBODY.

47
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:35,112
YOU'VE GOT A CLEAR IT ALL OUT

48
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:35,646
FIRST.

IT'S A MULTIPLE WEEK EVENT,

50
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,815
MULTIPLE MONTHS AND IT WILL GET

51
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,850
BETTER EVERY DAY.

52
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:43,654
RIGHT NOW, IF THEY CAN GET POWER

53
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:45,222
AND BETTER COMMUNICATIONS UP AND

54
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:45,989
RUNNING, CELL PHONES WORKING AND

55
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,659
THE LIKE, EVERYTHING ELSE STARTS

56
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,459
TO FLOW.

ROUND-THE-CLOCK TO GET POWER

61
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,299
RESTORED AND THEN LONG-TERM, YOU

62
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,034
WORRY ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE

63
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:00,637
AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY.

64
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:01,538
FORESTRY INDUSTRY, PEANUTS,

65
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,207
COTTON CROP THAT WAS WIPED OUT.

66
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,008
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T

67
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,309
GOING TO MAKE ANY MONEY THIS

68
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,612
YEAR IN MANY CASES.

00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,647
THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE THAT WILL BE

70
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,315
HERE LONG AFTER THE POWER IS

71
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:12,883
RESTORED AND EVEN SOME

72
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,419
STRUCTURES ARE REBUILT.

00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:18,221
THOSE ARE MY FOLKS IN THE

75
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,022
PANHANDLE.

76
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:20,290
WATCHING THOSE COMMUNITIES COME

77
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,091
TOGETHER, THEY ARE TOUGH AND

78
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:22,726
THEY WILL ASSIST EACH OTHER.

79
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,161
NEIGHBORS WILL STEP IN BUT THEY

80
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:25,862
HAVE A LONG, HARD PATH TO GO.

81
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:28,665
I WANT TO ASK YOU PUT THE OTHER

82
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,666
TOP STORY ABOUT SAUDI ARABIA.

83
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,602
THINGS ARE CHANGING.

84
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:33,303
THE PRESIDENT TODAY, AFTER A

85
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:34,838
CALL WITH THE KING, SAID HE

86
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:37,274
ABSOLUTELY DENIED IT.

87
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:37,974
HE HAS SENT SECRETARY OF STATE

88
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,410
POMPEO THERE.

89
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,846
TRYING TO GET TO THE TRUTH.

90
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:44,614
THE PRESIDENT MADE MENTION OF

91
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:45,816
POTENTIALLY ROGUE KILLERS.

92
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:46,616
IT'S LANGUAGE THE PEOPLE THINK

93
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,452
THEY HE MAY HAVE GONE DIRECTLY

94
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:51,421
FROM THE SAUDI ADMINISTRATION.

95
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,623
YOUR DEMOCRATIC COUNTERPART IN

97
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,626
"HEARING THE RIDICULOUS QUOTE

98
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:57,794
ROOM KILLER THEORY WHERE THE

99
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:59,730
SAUDIS WOULD GO WITH IT,

100
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:00,731
ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY THEY

101
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:01,465
WERE ABLE TO ENLIST THE

102
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,033
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

103
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,668
AS THEIR P.R. AGENT TO FLOAT

104
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:05,035
IT."

105
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:05,969
THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD SOME TOUGH

106
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,470
TALK.

107
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:07,204
I KNOW YOU HAVE AS WELL.

108
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:09,506
HOW DO WE GET THE VIOLENCE WAS

109
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:11,174
ON EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO

110
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:13,443
JAMAL KHASHOGGI?

111
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,444
>> HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

112
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:15,712
HE WALKED INTO THAT BUILDING AND

113
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:17,647
THERE'S NO VIDEO OF HIM WALKING

114
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:18,014
OUT.

115
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:18,682
EITHER HE IS STILL IN THERE

116
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:20,617
SOMEWHERE OR HE'S DEAD.

117
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:21,451
THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY

118
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,018
EXPLANATION FOR IT.

119
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,854
IF THERE IS VIDEO OF HIM LEAVING

120
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:24,888
THE FACILITY, I THINK COMMON

121
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,623
SENSE TELLS YOU THE SAUDIS WOULD

122
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:27,257
HAVE PRODUCED IT.

123
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:28,558
WHO DID IT AND HOW THEY DID IT,

124
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,860
WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO ASSUME

125
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:32,329
THE WORSE AND WE WILL SEE

126
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,063
THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION AND

127
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:33,697
INSIGHT THEY ARE PROVIDING

128
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,832
OTHERS WILL PROVIDE, WE WILL

129
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:40,303
KNOW MORE.

130
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,037
THE TURKS CLAIM THEY HAVE AUDIO

131
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,606
AND POTENTIALLY VIDEO.

132
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:44,007
IF THAT'S TRUE, WE WILL KNOW

133
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:44,474
ABOUT IT.

134
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,442
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO

135
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:46,376
IN THESE CASES IS TO WAIT FOR

136
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,844
THE TRUTH TO COME OUT AND WAIT

137
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,079
FOR THE EVIDENCE TO BE PRESENTED

138
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,481
AND WAIT FOR THE FACTS TO BE OUT

139
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,449
THERE BEFORE WE MAKE ANY

140
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:52,916
PRONOUNCEMENTS.

141
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,084
WE ARE DEALING WITH FOREIGN

142
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:55,685
GOVERNMENTS HERE, NOT JUST

143
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:56,086
INDIVIDUALS.

144
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:57,888
WHAT I HAVE SAID AND I WILL SAY

145
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:58,688
AGAIN, IF, IN FACT, THE SAUDIS

146
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,891
LURED HIM IN THERE AND THEN

147
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,259
KILLED HIM AND THEN DISPOSED OF

148
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,193
HIM AND HAVE BEEN BASICALLY

149
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,861
SITTING ON IT, IT'S GOING TO

150
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,130
HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE U.S.-SAUDI

151
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:07,564
RELATIONSHIP.

152
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:09,199
I CAN TELL YOU FROM A

153
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,700
CONGRESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE, IT

154
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:11,668
MOST CERTAINLY IS AND IT'S

155
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,870
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY ARE AN

156
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,672
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

157
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:16,339
MIDDLE EASTERN STRATEGY TO

158
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,106
CONSTRAIN IRAN.

159
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,708
THAT CANNOT ALLOW US TO OVERLOOK

160
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,010
SOMETHING AS HORRIFIC AS THIS

161
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:20,710
IF, IN FACT, THAT'S WHAT

162
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,311
HAPPENED.

163
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:22,078
I DO BELIEVE EVENTUALLY WE ARE

164
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,214
GOING TO KNOW ONE WAY OR THE

165
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:24,915
OTHER.

174
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,629
THEY HAD HINTED THIS WEEKEND

175
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,463
THERE WILL BE REPERCUSSIONS

176
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,065
AGAINST ANYBODY WHO CAME TO

177
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,066
FALSELY ACCUSE THEM IN THE

178
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,067
SITUATION COME AS A WAY TO FIND

179
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:44,668
OUT THE FACTS.

180
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,236
THERE'S BEEN TALK OF HIKING OIL

181
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:47,838
PRICES AND THOSE KINDS OF

182
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,672
THINGS.

183
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:50,073
YOU KNOW HOW INTERTWINED WE ARE.

184
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:51,174
I ASKED THE PRESIDENT LAST WEEK

185
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:52,075
ABOUT STOPPING ARMS SALES.

186
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,276
IF SOMETHING THERE'S BEEN

WHAT CAN CONGRESS DO IF IT TURNS

189
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,250
OUT THE SAUDIS ARE RESPONSIBLE:

190
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:03,320
>> THE ONE THING WE HAVE DONE IS

191
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:10,327
WE HAVE TRIGGERED A GLOBAL

192
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:14,030
MAGNITZKY INVESTIGATION.

193
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:14,831
IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT.

194
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:16,199
PEOPLE IN THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT

195
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,334
ENJOY ACCESS TO THE U.S. AND

196
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:19,035
GLOBAL MARKETS IN ORDER TO ENJOY

197
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:20,070
THEIR WEALTH.

198
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,471
THE ARMS SALES GETS A LOT OF

199
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:23,506
ATTENTION AND THAT MAY NEED TO

200
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:23,840
HAPPEN.

201
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,141
LIMITING THEM OR CUTTING THEM

202
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:26,843
OFF BUT ULTIMATELY THE SAUDIS

203
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:28,845
CAN BUY WEAPONS FROM SOMEONE

204
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:29,412
ELSE.

205
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,513
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT WHEN HE

206
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:30,881
SAYS THAT.

207
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,515
THAT MAY BE ANOTHER THING WE

208
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:33,450
LOOK AT.

209
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:34,718
THE DEEPER DYNAMIC IN ALL THIS,

210
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:36,419
IT'S NOT FOR THE OIL.

211
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,187
AMERICA PRODUCES OIL AS WELL AND

212
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:38,688
WE ARE ABOUT TO BE THE WORLD'S

213
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,156
LARGEST PRODUCER IF WE AREN'T

214
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:40,624
ALREADY.

215
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,791
I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE HERE

216
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,661
BECOMES WITH THE ROLE THEY PLAY

217
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:45,462
IN OUR MIDDLE EASTERN STRATEGY.

218
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:47,097
THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK

219
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,432
WISELY HAS BUILT THEM AS A KEY

220
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,534
LINCHPIN AGAINST IRAN IN THEIR

221
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:52,269
OMISSIONS IN THEIR EXPANSION IN

222
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,270
THE REGION.

223
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,538
THAT'S ENDANGERED NOW.

224
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,642
IF THEY DID THIS, IT MAKES IT

225
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:00,043
IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO WORK WITH

226
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:01,611
THEM IN THE SHORT TERM UNTIL

227
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,812
SOMETHING IS DONE ABOUT IT.

228
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:03,680
THAT'S A FACT.

229
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,882
OTHERWISE, HOW DO WE CRITICIZE

230
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:09,019
OUR ADVERSARIES AROUND THE WORLD

231
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,819
FOR MURDERING AND JAILING PEOPLE

232
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,422
IF WE OVERLOOK IT WHEN OUR

233
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:12,856
ALLIES DO IT?

234
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:15,058
IT IS A MESS ALL THE WAY AROUND.

235
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,426
I WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED FOR

236
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,128
THAT MAN AND HIS FAMILY BUT ALSO

237
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,663
FOR GEOPOLITICAL REASONS.

238
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:20,964
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

239
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,465
WE'LL HAVE TO ADDRESS IT.

240
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,466
>> Shannon: WE WILL STAND BY

241
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,701
AS WE WAIT TO GET THOSE FACTS.

242
00:06:24,702 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN THE
