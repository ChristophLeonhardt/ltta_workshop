Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump the son-in-law and daughter of the President of the United States respectively said that going to work in the White House was a big sacrifice right you know they've been given up millions upon millions of dollars in profits they were sacrificing their own companies to go work for Donald Trump is unpaid advisers they were not gonna take a dime of taxpayer money which hey that's great you don't need the money right once it turns out in the first year and a half of Donald Trump being President of the United States these two combined Jared and Ivanka pulled in eighty two million dollars according to financial disclosure reports eighty two million dollars for being unpaid advisors through your businesses that you are still both very much involved in now here's the thing back when Jimmy Carter was elected president the man owned a peanut farm peanut farm that made a little bit of money Republicans made him sell it so that he couldn't somehow use the office of the presidency to profit off his peanut farm Jared and Ivanka are both very much involved in their current businesses while also serving within the White House if vodka Trump is one at least what 13 new trademarks from China that she is now profiting from Jared Kushner got massive financial deals from several different people after meeting with them in the White House they are using their positions of power within the Trump administration and Trump family to enrich themselves yes this is illegal but no nobody's going to do a damn thing about it why because nobody ever does a thing about anything illegal that has happened during this administration and I'm not talking about the collusion all that crap I'm talking about the average everyday crimes that this administration seems to be committing Scott Pruett has broken the law at least four separate times in the last month at least that's when they were revealed four times illegal activity one month nothing nothing Jared and Ivanka very clear legal violations here nothing Donald Trump emoluments Claus nothing there is a lawsuit on that god only knows where it's gonna go but seriously folks every single week we are hearing a new story about somebody in this administration using their office to enrich themselves or bolster their connections or abuse the power of their office and nothing here in just a few of the areas where Jared and Ivanka were making millions of dollars in the last 18 months here five million from Jared Kushner properties in Jersey 3.9 million for Ivanka from her stake in the Trump International Hotel in DC where diplomats stay and people like that they don't have to but they do because they want to make Donald Trump happy and so they all get a profit from that five million for Ivanka from her clothing and accessories lines which no doubt have seen a boost ever since she became whatever it is the unpaid advisor thinks she was actually gonna be first lady at 1.2 million - Ivanka from some kind of weird payroll corporation the Donald Trump the Trump Organization whatever owns because she was listed as a consultant for the last year so right here and those are just a handful it goes up to 82 million we know that a vodka trumpet was at least listed as a consultant while she was also a White House adviser and that's not how things work how much more is it going to take how much more criminal activity with the evidence is it going to take for someone in this government to stand up and say I demand your resignation right now not later now because that's the point we're at if we let this behavior go if we continue to normalize it or even just act like it's not happening it's going to get so much worse and yeah we've had Democrats calling for investigations but at this point we don't even necessarily need them we need these corrupt jackasses in the federal government to step down immediately before they continue or further destroy these institutions that were once seen as respectable positions of power and influence here in the United States today they're nothing more than just some positions where Trump and his closest allies can make a quick buck by bolstering their own business and screwing over everybody else
