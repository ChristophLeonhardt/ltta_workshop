hours after signing an executive order that halted his it's his administration's very hideous and unpopular policy to separate migrant families from their children room at the southern border at the rally he mentioned the executive order almost as an afterthought so the Democrats want open borders let everybody come in let everybody pour in we don't care let them come in from the middle-east let them come in from all over the place we don't care we're not gonna let it happen and by the way today I signed an executive order we're going to keep families together but the border is going to be just as tough as it's been they won't admit it but president Trump's executive order yesterday was a big reversal watch both he and it was huge on Ursel Jeff session announced it in April and the president called it a law many times by the way defended I do have to say this because I there are people out there that I saw yesterday saying still saying that this is Barack Obama's law no that's a lie it is that that is his falsus as actually people who believe that Neil Armstrong didn't walk on the moon I mean you really you have got to take the scales off your eyes that the president was lying to you saying time and again that only the Congress could fix this they've been falsely stating today's that only Congress could fix the problems and that the Democrats would have Linda listen as Jesus said let those who have ears to hear hear hear is the president until these loopholes are closed by Congress it is not possible as a matter of law to detain and remove whole family units who arrived illegally in the United States Congress and the courts created this problem and Congress alone can fix it Congress is the one that needs to fix this it's a law passed by the United States Congress there's only one body here that gets to create legislation and it's Congress our job is to enforce it and we would like to see Congress fix it once again it's Congress's job to change the law I hate the children being taken away the Democrats have to change their law that's their law the Democrats forced that law upon our nation I hate it to the laws and that's a democrat bill that's democrats wanting to do that and they could solve it very easily by getting together but they think it's a good election point but that's the law and that's what the democrats gave us and i say it's very strongly the Democrats fault their obstruction there they're really obstructionist and they are obstructing who having a lot of problems with democrats they don't want to vote for anything this has been going on for 50 years longer this has been going on under President Obama on to President Bush this has been going on for many many years we're gonna see if we can solve it this is not something that happened just now you look at the images from 2014 I was watching this morning and they were showing images from 2014 they blow away what we're looking at today and that was not doing this that was during the Obama administration I saw images that were horrible yeah of course it's unbeliev I just got to go through this Willie I can't do it the president says he can't do it he can't I can't I can't drink the water he can't in this policy the Jeff Sessions announced they were starting in March Kirsten Nelson says it is not possible Congress and the courts created the problem only Congress and the courts can fix it Sarah Huckabee Sanders the Democrats did it the Democrats have to change it this bill this law we can't change it Obama did it Bush did it again this is objective objectify ibly you can look at this everything that Kirsten Wilson said there was a lie everything that Sarah Huckabee Sanders it's not a misstatement a lie everything Sarah Huckabee Sanders said there was a lie everything the president said there was a lie everything that the administration's been saying about this is a lie this is a decision Donald Trump in Jeff Sessions made and they executed it and yesterday the president proved that he is a liar on this and that Kirsten Nelson went out and lied for him and Sarah Huckabee Sanders went out and lied for him and everybody in the administration that has said he couldn't fix this or liars remember Kirsten Nielsen said this is not a policy this is not even a policy well then they came back the next day and they said it wasn't poverty men that have been trotted out to talk about this and another thing because she said was when she was asked whether this policy was intended to send a message to people deciding whether or not to come into the country and she said I am offended by that question I am deeply offended well meanwhile Jeff Sessions Stephen Miller and many others have said yes this is a tough deterrent this is one of those it's a tough to turn and by the way we should point out I know we'll get into it but there are still 23 hundred or so kids separated from their families this executive law does nothing about them they are still sitting in limbo we don't know how they'll be Union and and Heidi one of the things there's so many disturbing elements of this but what would we be saying if Russia sees 2300 children and if Russia didn't allow the world to see pictures of babies being incarcerated toddlers being incarcerated young girls being incarcerated the centralized state of Donald J Trump is refusing to allow the press and by extension Americans to see what condition toddlers are being incarcerated in in the United States of America babies are being three-year-old girls are being incarcerated this is something that rwan would do this is something that Putin would do this does not happen in the United States of America and I would like anybody that supports Donald Trump to tell me why why is there a news blackout why can't we see what these young babies at what the incarceration looks like and if there was ever a moment that we as a nation should realize what it means that we are retreating from our traditional role as a beacon of human rights the internationally it is what is happening on our own soil and you're right Joe we still have not gotten in to find out what the conditions are and now we're talking about potentially moving these children to military-style camps we don't have any kind of clarity as to what's going to happen after 20 days because we still have this Flores agreements and to your point about the Orwellian world we're in Ileana ros-lehtinen said it best when she said it's like the arson now trying to play firemen I mean we just go back rewind seriously like 24 hours the President himself saying you've got to take the kids yeah and then sitting in the Oval Office and hoping that the world and the nation now views him as this benevolent leader who's rolling back 60 years of bad policy no it's 60 days of horrific public and you asked if a man had done it he is this started with Jeff Sessions the Attorney General just got to announce that in your paper we're going to have which just proved everybody that followed it was lying but so this is what's so fascinating I guess the most intense trumpets may say well they're in our country illegally as I have stated talking it again really conserved when it comes to immigration I think borders mean something I the international law international order is fantastic but I'm a big believer in in borders and boundaries and nations but that said even political prisoners have protections under the Geneva Accords even political prisoners we have a right yeah for inspections i even even if we treat but we even have cameras going in the guantanamo there show Gitmo so we get a look at the prisoners we get a look at the conditions right now there's a news blackout Richard and I'm just wondering again help us put this in better perspective we know the United States doesn't pay this way we're toddlers are incarcerated and the press is not allowed to show Americans what the situation is and infants are incarcerated and the press is not allowed to see wait where does this happen has this ever happened in the United States is this what happens in Russia where they seize children and put them in a black hole I expect it's only a matter of time before International someone calls for international inspectors and NGOs to come into the United States to inspect how we're doing on on Human Rights grounds and the rest and building on heidi's point one of the most important things in foreign policy is not what diplomats do it's the example we said as a society the quality of our society the quality of our politics the strength of our economy so this is a major international setback we've gone a long way from being the shining city on a hill they say one other thing if you're that concerned about your borders and we should be we should be yeah we should be doing more in places like Guatemala Honduras El Salvador we have got to try to do things down there so people do not feel pressured or compelled to flee to the United States we dramatically reduced immigration from Mexico how it was called NAFTA we helped grow the Mexican economy we work with the Mexican by the way by the way don't tell President Trump and his supporters that one of the reasons why we had negative immigration flow into the United States over the past several years under the Obama administration was because NAFTA was working so well that actually people were flooding back to Mexico because their economy is growing the plan Colombia had a tremendous impact on the strength of its institution so if we really want to protect protect our borders the way to do it is not by separating families one of the main tools we have is to strengthen the police forces in these countries to improve their economies to do something about corruption deal with it at the source we will then find ourselves where we don't have to make these awful policies you mentioned international bodies inspecting what's happening here one of the things I've been struck by is that is what Congress has done in responses which is they've jumped into a legislative debate that probably is not going to end with actual legislation passing but they have not as far as I can tell launched an investigation an oversight investigation about how this policy came into effect but more critically which I think we've sort of glossed over a little bit here how 2,000 350 or so families were torn apart by our government and more importantly how our government seems either incapable or incompetent to put those letters back where are the children now Sam how their they are together and how could the White House announced this yesterday and not have an answer - how are you gonna reunite these children who were ripped in some cases from mothers who wills RS feeding them else the answer is either that they are morally callous about this or that they are incompetent about this and they don't have tracking trove and about but we think about if we think about government tragedies in our lifetime the idea that a government could be responsible for separating two thousand three hundred fifty families itself and actually took and then incapable of fixing it is up there among one of the great tragedies of a government institution that I'm really really I'll tell you what I mean you know I've been in it whatever this is for 25 years between Congress and and and the media and the only other instance I can find not 9/11 because that was an attack from an outside force but Katrina this is the this this the closest thing to that I'd see this Katrina and you know I was on the west coast with my daughter we're taking a father-daughter trip across the west coast quite ironic that there I am able to spend time with my girl and other parents along the the southern border don't know where their two-year-old daughter is their three-year-old daughter is and I mean it's it really is unspeakable but as I was calling back home and talking to mica talking to everybody else I heard anguish on the other side of the phone lined up friends and family that reminded me of what they were saying during Katrina well because it's playing out in front of your eyes right it's on TV it's not some hidden crisis it's something we can watch on TV like Katrina we were watching and saying I was this happy Audrey live and why isn't our government doing a difference and I thought about the Katrina analogy law - that was a natural decision to make this is a human again not to put too fine of a point on it it was a natural disaster made so much worse by human in action yeah and also by you the corruption new in New Orleans should not have flooded and those people should not have been in that users not deliberate yeah those are acts of omission this is more acts of commission right and this is this is qualitative it so Jonathan Lemuria part of the reason to a question of why the Trump administration wasn't prepared better and what to do with these twenty three hundred kids who today are not seeing their parents and we don't know when they will if some of them ever will is that it happened so quickly just some of your reporting on this Donald Trump coming yesterday morning and saying all right let's do an executive order the chief of staff John Kelly and others saying we can't do it like this it can't supersede law etc etc how did this come to be Donald Trump saying he wanted to get it done before he got on the plane to Minnesota right we're days of the president saying this couldn't be done this way that he would say incorrectly that it couldn't be done by executive order that it had to be Congress and it really seemed like the White House was trying to pressure Capitol Hill to so they would come up with some sort of solution so the president would not seen it's having to reverse himself on this and then eventually he did cave to public pressure and as much as the White House is trying to spin this as this is sort of a benevolent act the Trump is ending what Obama started and this is of course incorrect you know this is something they changed I think it's very striking last night at that rally in Minnesota how he makes barely a mention of this executive order who reverses the policy and instead spends so much of that rally really hammering home he's very tough hardline immigration stances as if he's sort of proving that his bona fides on that issue the issue that he thinks got him the White House the issue why he was willing to have this fight in the first place these recent days and our reporting he was telling people around him that he thought this would be as good cultural war kind of victory here akin to the NFL players kneeling for the national anthem you know Jonathan you saw the polls it seventeen percent supported this policy Donald Trump was working the seventeen percent on this policy this is a people think this guy is is such a brilliant politician he's not he's boiling it down it's it's one of the great miss Reed's I think of recent American political history the guy lost to Hillary by 3 million electoral votes he got elected against one of the worst campaigns and one of the worst campaigners and modern American history they didn't even show up in Wisconsin barely they descend Barak Obama to Michigan on election day this guy is not a great political mind he he knows how to poke people and insult people but he has been playing a 17-percent hand for a week and a half and his poll numbers will drop from it and already we've seen the ballot tests between Republicans and Democrats are breaking the Democrats way his poll numbers had ticked up before this crisis and as we know Trump off so often just he aims all of his policies at his base and I think this also shows us in recent days how much of it he is he's sort of a lone wolf he's flying solo on a lot of these decisions there are very few voices around him that can tell him no mr. president you shouldn't do this and I think we're gonna get to this later that includes members of his own family and this is a decision that he went with you know the of course there are people like Stephen Miller John Kelly who were advocating for as well but at the end of the day this was Trump's decision and he was very frustrated yesterday that it was also going to be seen as his reversal and we're gonna be talking about a vodka and Melania being the two people the report said last night that were working to get him to change the policy yeah I actually had an exchange with her yesterday which we'll talk about still ahead on Morning Joe what was Ivanka's role in all of this we didn't hear from the top White House advisor whose focus was women and families and babies until after her father issued the executive order Plus Michael Cohen steps down from his role at the RNC and throw shade at the president's policy was in recess I think it's over really Mike made towards professor would always say as he was setting you up for the kill in torts class you'd say you ought to see this next question coming at like a freight train out of the Mist and at that point in coward because you knew that professor Pierson was coming at your horn it comes Michael : and but here's Michael Kahn you should be able to see what Michael Cohen's still in that psycho Freight with investigators you're watching Morning Joe we'll be right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the
