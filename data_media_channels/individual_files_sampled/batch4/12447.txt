President Obama is about to become the world's leading sponsor of terrorism how by signing over 150 billion dollars in checks to the Iranian mullahs the same moas who routinely chant death to America and death to Israel the same mullahs responsible for over a thousand dead American soldiers in Iraq the same moas currently conquering Iraq and Syria and Lebanon and Yemen I'm Ben Shapiro this is hard wire President Obama's Iran deal it's a disaster for the United States it's a disaster for Israel it's a disaster for all of America's other allies in the Middle East it's a piece of anti-semitic garbage it's designed to make Iran a regional power and then after making it a regional power to give it a nuclear weapon the clock is ticking here's the best-case scenario within 10 years Iran the most dangerous terrorists ponder on the planet will have a surging economy and international legitimacy not only that they'll then be able to get nuclear weapons and during that decade Iran will become the most powerful force in the Middle East one of the most strategically valuable regions on the planet the around who explicitly does nothing to curb Iran's terrorist activities around the world including the wars of conquest and their funding of terrorist groups in Libya and the Palestinian Authority in Lebanon and as far south as South America after that as the deal comes to its conclusion Iran will now use the nuclear technology they already have and they'll build a nuclear weapon consequence-free here's the worst-case scenario the Iranians take the cash they pursue regional dominance they pursue terrorism and then they develop nuclear weapons secretly anyway now the deal provides no safeguards for monitoring Iran's nuclear development compliance under the deal Iran gets to inspect its own military sites its own military sites that's where they're allegedly developing nukes furthermore Iran gets three months or more to hide its nuclear activity if it objects to an inspection and even then there's no guarantee the international community does anything about it the Iran deal even guarantees that the United States entity allies will teach the Iranians to protect their nuclear development from outside sabotage namely from the Israelis so if anyone wants to stop them from going nuclear the United States will help Iran stop the people trying to stop them from going nuclear so why is Obama pursuing such a bad deal there are two reasons first Obama has long sought to make Iran a regional power everybody who's comparing Obama to Neville Chamberlain in his surrender to Hitler that's kind of unfair to Chamberlain at least Chamberlain wanted to stop Hitler from taking over the continent Obama wants the Iranians to take over the Middle East or at least to become a direct counterbalance to Israel and Egypt and the Saudis that's been his goal since 2008 when he reached out to the Iranians to negotiate while George W Bush was still in power in December 2014 Obama said that Iran could be a quote very successful regional power that would be good for the United States that would be good for the region and most of all it would be good for the Iranian people and to that end president Obama has become the chief propagandist for the Iranian regime he's told members of the press and the Jewish community that Iranian anti-semitism is just for public consumption it's nothing to really worry about it's just internal politics they don't really worry about internal politics in Iran folks it's a tyranny his Radio Free Europe they recently ran a puff piece on Qasem Soleimani that's the commander of the Iranian codes force responsible for the murder of a thousand American troops so your taxpayer dollars they're being used to push Iranian propaganda there's a second reason the President Obama wants to deal with Iran and like Jews very much President Obama has been using openly anti-semitic language in his defense of Iran he and his surrogates have accused deal opponents of dual loyalty to Israel and selling votes to lobbyists even Democrats like Chuck Schumer he specifically personally stated that unspecified lobbyists had dropped millions to stop him that's the myth of the Jewish money and then he accused his opponents of getting America into the Iraq war in the first place a false accusation specifically directed at Jewish neoconservatives the Iran zeal it's rotten from stem to stern if threatens America's allies in the region and since Iran can develop long-range missiles in a few years under the deal it threatens Europe and the United States directly unfortunately Democrats have been lining up behind President Obama instead of standing on principle and cowardly Republicans paved the way for Obama's deal by passing a bill requiring two-thirds Senate Majority to stop the deal in relying on the constitutional treaty power that would have allowed that deal to be stopped with just one third of senators it's not too late though if we act now and if we don't tens of thousands of people will die at Iran's hands funded by the United States with or without a mushroom cloud
