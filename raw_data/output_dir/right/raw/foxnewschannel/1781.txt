ALL RIGHT.

00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:05,919

ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF

WATCH THIS.

17
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,798
>> AND SO HERE WE ARE IN THE

18
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:21,434
MIDST OF AN EPIDEMIC OF

19
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:23,036
DISHONESTY IN AN ENDLESS

20
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:24,104
BARRAGE OF LIES.

21
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:25,539
THE SEAT IN GOVERNMENT ISN'T

22
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,307
SOMETHING TO JUST SHRUG YOUR

23
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:28,241
SHOULDERS AT.

24
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:29,242
WHEN ELECTED OFFICIALS SPEAK

25
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:30,677
AS THOUGH THEY ARE ABOVE THE

26
00:00:30,677 --> 00:00:31,945
TRUTH, THEY WILL ACT AS

27
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:32,746
THOUGH THEY ARE ABOVE THE

28
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:34,948
LAW.

29
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:37,017
>> THAT WAS AT RICE

30
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,019
UNIVERSITY IN HOUSTON ON

31
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:39,452

00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:42,856
MEANT TO UPLIFT AND INSPIRE

34
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:43,190
PEOPLE.

35
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,893
HERE TO DEBATE IS OLYMPIC

36
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:48,061
MEDIA UNITED STATES FRANKS

37
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,597
AND JASON ANTHONY NICHOLS.

38
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:51,498
THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING

39
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:51,831
WITH US.

40
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:56,102
>> THANK YOU.

41
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:56,703
AINSLEY: LET ME ASK YOU

42
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:57,470
FIRST, I WILL START WITH

43
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,338
YOU, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF

44
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:58,738
THAT SPEECH.

45
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:00,140
>> YOU KNOW, THE FIRST HALF

46
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,842
OF IT HONESTLY, I WAS

47
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:03,210
HESITANT.

48
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,913
IT SEEMS TO FALL FAIRLY

49
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:07,714
STEREO TYPICALLY COMPARING

50
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:08,915
HIM TO REGIMES.

51
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:09,983
COMPARING HIM TO DICTATORS,

52
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,418
THE PRESIDENT, OF COURSE,

53
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:12,586
WHO I'M REFERRING TO.

54
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:13,954
THE SECOND HALF OF IT,

55
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:15,522
ACTUALLY I WAS QUITE

56
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:15,956
HEARTENED BY.

57
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:17,991
BECAUSE I BELIEVE

58
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:18,758
MR. BLOOMBERG IS CORRECT

59
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:20,126
WHEN HE SAYS IF YOUR LOYALTY

60
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:24,664
IS TO LEFT OR TO RIGHT, THEN

61
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:26,433
YOU ARE TAKING TRIBE OVER

62
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:26,766
COUNTRY.

63
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:28,335
THAT, I THINK, IS SPOT ON IN

64
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:31,137
TERMS THE PARTISAN TOXICITY

65
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:32,205
GOING ON IN OUR POLITICAL

66
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:32,739
SYSTEM TODAY.

67
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:33,907
FIRST HALF NOT GREAT.

68
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:36,676
SECOND HALF PRETTY GOOD.

69
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:37,711
AINSLEY: JASON, WHAT DID YOU

70
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,746
THINK IN THE I THINK THE

71
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:40,847
FIRST HALF YOU ARE TALKING

72
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:42,549
ABOUT KATIE IS THE EPIDEMIC

73
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,718
OF DISHONESTY HE SAYS IS THE

74
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:45,852
WORST THREAT FACING AMERICA

75
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:46,886
NOT TERRORISM AND NOT

76
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:48,054
COMMUNISM OR THE OTHER

77
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:48,388
ISSUES.

78
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:50,724
HE SAID IT WAS THE EPIDEMIC

79
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:51,992
OF DISHONESTY AND SAID

80
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:52,826
POLITICIANS WHO CAN'T TELL

81
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,361
THE TRUTH.

82
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,395
YOUR THOUGHTS, JASON?

83
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,097
>> I THINK WE ARE IN A SAD

84
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:58,198
MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY

85
00:01:58,198 --> 00:01:59,199
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN

86
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,800
EPIDEMIC OF DISHONESTY AND

87
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,269
EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE

88
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:03,503
AUTOMATICALLY KNOWS IT'S THE

89
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:04,504
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

90
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:05,939
STATES THAT HE IS REFERRING

91
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:06,306
TO.

92
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:10,009
I THINK WHAT IS HE TRYING TO

93
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,177
TELL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, I

94
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:12,412
THINK CAN YOU GATHER RIGHT

95
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:13,513
NOW THAT CAN YOU REACH

96
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,982
SUCCESS BY BEING DISHONEST.

97
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:17,917
THAT YOU CAN EVEN REACH THE

98
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:18,485
PRESIDENCY THAT WAIT A

99
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:19,152
MINUTE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT

100
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:21,054
WHO HAS TOLD 3,000

101
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,656
FALSEHOODS IN UNDER 400

102
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:22,956
DAYS.

103
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,157
SO I THINK WHAT IS HE TRYING

104
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:26,393
TO SAY IS INTEGRITY STILL

105
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:26,726
MATTERS.

106
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:27,861
THAT THE VALUES THAT YOU GOT

107
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,829
FROM YOUR MOTHER, WE JUST

108
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,497
CELEBRATED MOTHER'S DAY,

109
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:32,132
THAT THE VALUES THAT YOU GOT

110
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:33,633
FROM YOUR MOTHERS THAT WERE

111
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,068
REINFORCED IN YOUR CHURCHES

112
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:36,336
AND MOSQUES AND SYNAGOGUES

113
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:37,304
ARE STILL IMPORTANT.

114
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,338
AND THEY ARE STILL GOING TO

115
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:41,074
LEAD YOU TO-TO LEAD A

116
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:41,741
SUCCESSFUL LIFE.

117
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,276
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A

118
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:46,513
NEGATIVE MESSAGE.

119
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:47,180
AINSLEY: KATIE, COMPARE HIS

120
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,215
SPEECH TO MIKE PENCE'S

121
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:49,549
SPEECH.

122
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,051
HE WAS SPEAKING AT HILLSDALE

123
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:52,252
COLLEGE HE SAID YOU ARE

124
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:53,586
BEGINNING YOUR CAREERS AT A

125
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:54,521
TIME OF GROWING AMERICAN

126
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:55,989
ECONOMY AND RESTORED

127
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,290
AMERICAN STATUE AT HOME AND

128
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:57,624
ABROAD.

129
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,025
I THINK WE HAVE A SOUND

130
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:00,260
BITE, A CLIP OF THAT SPEECH.

131
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,860
LISTEN.

132
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,996
>> ON THE WORLD STAGE,

133
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,431
YOU'VE SEEN AMERICA

134
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:05,832
EMBRACING OUR ROLE AS LEADER

135
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:06,833
OF THE FREE WORLD.

136
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,801
AT HOME BUSINESSES LARGE AND

137
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,704
SMALL ARE GROWING AGAIN.

138
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:11,438
AGAIN BECAUSE PRESIDENT

139
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:12,339
TRUMP AND OUR ENTIRE

140
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,373
ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN

141
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,008
ADVANCING THE VERY

142
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:15,675
PRINCIPLES THAT YOU LEARNED

143
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:16,876
HERE IN THE HALLS OF

144
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:19,346
HILLSDALE COLLEGE.

145
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:20,046
AINSLEY: KATIE, COMPARE

146
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:20,647
THOSE TWO SPEECHES.

147
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:21,748
>> OF COURSE, THE VICE

148
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:23,550
PRESIDENT WAS CERTAINLY MORE

149
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,718
OPTIMISTIC AND

150
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:25,185
FORWARD-FACING.

151
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,353
I WILL ALSO SAY I WAS SO

152
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,954
HAPPY TO SEE HIM AT

153
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,789
HILLSDALE WHICH IS MY ALMA

154
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:30,090
MATER.

155
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,191
I DO THINK THAT IT WAS.

156
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:32,559
I MEAN, AMERICANS AND

157
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,460
AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE NEVER

158
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,928
BEEN IN A BETTER PLACE.

159
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:35,962
IT'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER

160
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:37,430
TIME TO BE AN AMERICAN THAN

161
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,733
RIGHT NOW.

162
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,634
WAGES, TAX CUTS, JOBS.

163
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,136
EVERYTHING IS GETTING BETTER

164
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:45,705
AND CONTINUES TO GO ONWARD

165
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:46,573
AND UPWARD.

166
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:48,341
IT WAS NICE TO SEE HIM

167
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,110
REMINDING PEOPLE OF THAT.

168
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,777
AINSLEY: JASON, IS IT TIME

169
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:51,845
TO STOP THE IDENTITY

170
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:52,212
POLITICS?

171
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:54,047
>> WELL, I THINK WE CAN

172
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:54,848
CHALLENGE SOME OF THE THINGS

173
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:55,982
THAT KATIE JUST SAID ABOUT

174
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:56,783
THE TAX CUTS.

175
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,184
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

176
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:58,985
ACTUALLY GOING TO GIVE US

177
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,221
ANY KIND OF SUSTAINED WAGE

178
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,856
INCREASES OTHER THAN JUST

179
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:03,656
ONE-TIME BONUSES.

180
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:06,292
WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT

181
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:07,160
IDENTITY POLITICS.

182
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,228
YOU KNOW, DO I THINK THAT WE

183
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:09,696
NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE

184
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,064
DIVISIONS AND THE FRACTURE

185
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:12,932
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR NATION.

186
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:14,934
WE NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING

187
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,669
THUS FAR THIS PRESIDENT

188
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:19,172
WE ARE MORE DIVIDED, MORALE

189
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,572
IS LOWER IN THIS COUNTRY

190
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:22,475
THAN I CAN RECALL IN MY

191
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:23,109
ENTIRE LIFETIME.

192
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:24,711
I THINK WHAT WE ACTUALLY

193
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:26,479
NEED IS A CHANGE.
