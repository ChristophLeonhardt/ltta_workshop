this is a very serious conflict of interest at where it's going to come up is when the travel ban is constantly challenged in court well I think this is a very serious problem that the six countries which the travel ban applause all countries that are quite poor and do not have financial dealings with the Trump Organization this is a very serious conflict of interest and where it's going to come up is when the travel ban is constantly challenged in court as lacking a reasonable basis lawyers for plaintiffs who want to challenge the travel plan are going to argue and I think it was a very good argument that this was an arbitrary order that does not have any link to the national interest because first the countries were a lot of tourists have come from are not on the land ah and the countries on the list have sent you of any people of the United States who have committed acts of terror and furthermore the countries that are doing business with the Trump Organization or not on the list that's not a legitimate basis of which to put a list together for countries that could be subject to a travel ban so this is going to create serious constitutional due process issues for the government when they litigate to defend the travel ban and that's going to be on top of before is the First Amendment free exercise of religion class because they made because there is still abundant evidence that this travel ban is targeted as Muslims
