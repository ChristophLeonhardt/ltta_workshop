- Hey, everyone, I'm Hallease Beast,
a digital storyteller and video producer.
- Hey, and I'm Mr. Hallease.
I am a fan of Aqua Lungers,
which is made by WarpedCore Studios
and available on Steam, and I'm a nurse.
(Hallease laughs)
- Wow, and this is the Beast Cast,
your favorite aunt and uncle
talking about all things married life,
and things like such as.
- Roll the music!
(electro punk music)
- So, Mr. Hallease mentioned Aqua Lungers.
That is our friend Diego's video game
that he came out with.
He built the whole thing from scratch
and we're just like, we're
fans of just him, so.
- And it's a fun game.
- It's like legitimately a good game.
If you follow this channel,
then you have seen Diego before.
Anyway, we can't. (laughs)
- I'm just saying--
- Well, we can.
But you know, they wanna get
to the meat of the content.
- He's a good dude.
- He is a very good dude.
- Today's content, or today's topic is.
- Yes, so today's topic,
in true clickbait fashion, and
riding a wave, if you will.
We're discussing Will Smith
and Jada Pinkett Smith's--
- Red Table.
- Red Table Talk episode.
Because why not, you know?
Those of y'all listening,
these podcast episodes
end up on YouTube as well.
But if you watch Will Smith on YouTube,
he literally did like a
crossover platform situation
in one of his vlogs.
And essentially cross-promoted
not only his YouTube channel
but also Red Table Talk,
which is his wife's show
that is on Facebook.
And so for me as a video
producer watching it,
like watching the whole
crossover of two different
essentially arenas in
content creation, I was like,
Dag, y'all did that, you know? (laughing)
So purely from the production
perspective, mad respect.
I wanted to talk about, there
was a point in that episode
that they discussed that
hit me that I wanted to like
dive in with you a little
bit in relation to us.
And so I'm gonna play it
so y'all can hear/see it.
- You know how, I'm a scientist.
So everything is science for me.
- Yes.
- I read somethin' when
we first got together
that the most successful men
in history have been married.
- Right.
- Right?
- Right.
- And for me, I knew that
I would squander my life
if I was runnin' around.
- Yeah.
- Right, okay.
- The way my mind works, I
can only excel for a woman.
- Aw!
- Like I can't--
- Aw!
(laughing)
- I think a lot of men
are like that, though.
I think women are true motivators for men.
- And the one thing that I
think has been the greatest
motivator and asset for me with you
is your absolute refusal
to accept anything from me
other than the best that
I could possibly be.
- Right, and vice versa.
- The Aw! from Willow?
- That's his daughter.
-  Yeah.
- No, I'm just hearing the
Aw, and it's like, well,
so you're Aw-ing--
- That's a little
condescending. (chuckles)
- It is condescending and
I'm sorry that it is, but.
- No, her, she is a little
condescending in that.
- So I don't think that is condescending,
I just think that is naivete.
Because she's like, Oh, well, my.
I'm hearing like a romantic thing
and I'm hearing a romantic
thing coming from my dad.
Your father figure is
kind of like who you base
and who you compare other males into.
Man, this is--
- That's true.
- This is another podcast episode.
- Which is true, yeah.
- Anyway, but she was
like, Aw, that's so cute.
And it's like, yeah, but,
if you listen.
- If you really listen.
- Or if you listen to like
everything else that we heard,
and again, that's all editing,
but everything else leading up to that
was how there was friction
and there was stuff going on.
And then just like,
this one romantic thing.
Aw!
- Yeah.
I found it very interesting
'cause I could see that parallel
with you and I as well.
I feel like once the
more serious we became,
the more serious you became
about your own trajectory
and where you were trying to go.
- You mind if I take first crack at this?
- No, 'cause the other
thing I don't wanna reduce
the reason why you've had the trajectory
of a career you've had is
because you got married.
I don't wanna reduce it to that, either.
I just wanna see how much of
it really was a factor for you.
- So initially I didn't
think that I fell under that.
That I also found that a
woman, or like my partner,
was a strong motivator for me.
But then you reminded me, No,
remember when we got married.
And then the brain remembered.
Oh, right, I worked that much harder.
There was that much more
drive to get something done.
So there's intrinsic and extrinsic factors
into why that's true, for me at least.
So intrinsically, within
the marriage itself,
just between the two partners.
Your life decisions affect two people now.
So regardless of how much
communication you have
between you and your spouse,
you are always gonna feel
that there's kinda this
unspoken like expectation.
That you know, again, it's not
just my life, it's our life.
And so it's not just my
income, it's our income.
And so regardless of
whether they're saying,
Oh, well we don't have enough money,
or you know, It'd be nice
if we had this or that.
And like beyond materialistic stuff.
You just feel like, Am I
doing enough for our unit?
Excuse me, and at the time
when we first got married,
the answer was obviously No.
(Hallease laughs)
But and then if you look extrinsic,
like external to the marriage,
then there's the family.
So it's not necessarily my
family, it's more your family.
And again, not that there was
any pressure or expectations,
but there was the perceived pressures of,
How are you providing for my daughter?
And again, all of this is very, you know,
very hetero or whatever.
And then aside from that,
there's society.
- Right.
- So it's like, How are y'all doin',
What are you doing?
- And when they say, How are y'all doing,
there's this unspoken understanding
that most people are
coming at that from like,
if they're asking me it's more like,
Are you as the wife being
provided for, you know?
That's like the perception,
the projection that's onto you.
- From the male perspective,
it's, How are you providing
for your family or unit or whatever.
And again, we talked about
this last night at dinner.
Talking about the perils of maleness.
(Hallease laughs)
You know, it's like, (moans).
- It must be so hard being a man. (laughs)
- Just having the burden of
carrying around male genitalia.
(Hallease laughs)
It's just like, it wears on you.
Having all of that privilege.
- I know!
But there is something, which
is why feminism is important.
Because then it becomes, it's not about,
Oh, well just women need to be on top.
No, it's about pulling away some of that
pressure and strain that is not necessary.
It's not necessary for you
to feel this way as a man,
what you need to provide
to me as your wife,
if anything at all, you know?
Equality, part of that is
like, it will trickle up,
it will help you. (laughs)
- So what really like,
aside from you know,
there's like internal
and external factors.
It's really like being in a
marriage holds up a mirror
to your life.
If someone holds up a
mirror to you in a marriage,
and you do not see...
It shouldn't be like, Oh, I see my flaws.
It should be like, Oh, I see the ways
that I should be improving.
But yeah, so it's not like me feeling like
I need to be the pinnacle, I
need to be like the fulcrum,
the thing that like holds
everything up, right?
But it's, Am I contributing
as much as I could?
No, do I have the drive to do better, yes.
Do I have the means of doing better, yes.
I have the mental faculties
and I have the education.
And the ability to get student
loans or whatever, but.
(Hallease laughs)
Like I have the means, I know
which resources to tap into
to achieve this.
Do I have the drive to achieve it, yes.
Then do it.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It's good to smeet you.
- (laughs) It's good to smeet you.
Thank you for checking in on
this Beast Cast videocast.
If you don't know already,
you can support this
Beast Cast in a few ways.
The first being,
let the ads play.
- Let 'em play out.
We know they're ridiculous sometimes.
- Very ridiculous.
- We know there's a lot
of propaganda out there.
We know there's some ridiculous stuff
bein' pushed onto you.
But if the spirit moves you.
- It does help.
- Let 'em play out.
- Yeah, it helps a lot.
Another thing you can
do is like this video.
That helps as well.
The other thing you can
do is support the channel
on Patreon so that way we can continue
to push out these Beast Casts weekly.
Every little bit helps.
There's no minimum to what you can give
but you can set a monthly max.
So you know, let it work
within your budget, amen.
And then finally, the other
thing if the spirit moves you,
leave a comment below, good or bad.
'Cause criticism is
how you grow, you know.
I always want things to get better.
I don't want people to just blindly
like everything, you know.
If you have a critique...
Comments below, please leave it.
- But again, keep it constructive.
- Constructive criticism.
- Right, if you're gonna talk
about, like, racist things.
(Hallease laughs)
You can do whatever.
- People gonna do what they do, love.
- We will see it.
- People gonna do what they wanna do.
- Well yeah, sure.
- You can't.
People gonna do what they wanna do.
- Just reaching out into the ether,
be positive about it, if
you're gonna do somethin'.
We appreciate it.
- All right, okay, cool.
(Hallease laughs)
- The complete opposite is
gonna happen, cool, right?
- Back to the Beast Cast!
- Whoo!
- For me in my career,
marriage was not the catalyst
for me to push myself.
I always had, I'd been
already doing it, you know.
And you had, too.
'Cause you had already
achieved quite a bit,
considering where you had come from
and what you had, you know.
Like, considering your circumstance.
- Dangit, I keep hitting this.
So I mean, I had already, I
had graduated from my college.
- Yeah, he went to, you went to.
You should say that.
You went to Notre Dame, that's a big deal,
considering you're from a
border city, a border town.
You grew up in a more
or less middle class.
- See, but so all of that,
like I had to break away from.
This is like, Oh I
graduated from Notre Dame.
But like to what, like
what did I get out of it?
I had a bachelor's degree.
And it was from Notre Dame.
Notre Dame is what it
is, but it's not an Ivy.
And it's like there's all these
little detractions, right?
But I graduated, moved back
home, worked as a uniclerk.
But I did that for six months
and then saved up enough money
to move to San Antonio.
Found a job in San Antonio
that was just gonna be
the placeholder while
I went back to school.
And I wanted to go back,
get a biology degree, so
I had enrolled at UTSA
to take science courses,
to build up my resume,
to get into med school.
That's what I was trying to do.
But that fell through and
I ended up treading water
in that call center for
a little bit longer,
and just thinking,
Well how can I manifest
this into something?
And then you came along.
Another opportunity had popped up
for me to move into not
administration in a call center,
but like slightly above
like the underlings
that are toiling away
(Hallease laughs)
on the phones.
And we could've stayed here
but it was better for
you to move to Austin.
And so doing a tabula rasa,
like a clean slate thing
in Austin was like, Okay,
I'm back in healthcare
as a uniclerk because that's
the experience that I had.
What can I do to do something with this?
And so there was a drive
but it had stalled.
And then there was that
kickstart again of looking myself
in the mirror, What am I
contributing to the marriage?
My wife is trying to be
successful with stuff.
Is this all I can be?
(Hallease murmurs)
No, so...
Again, it's just like
that self-reflection.
- So would you say that
money is the big motivator
for you then?
- Enabling us to have a level of comfort,
that's what it was.
- Okay.
- To me.
But, yeah, so I don't wanna say
again, that the marriage or that you were
what jump-started it for me.
It was just confronting my inner demon.
Confronting my issues of saying like,
I know that you're not
happy with where you're at.
And I know you wanted to do better.
You've wanted to do
better for two years now.
So then do something about it.
- So not settling.
- And the other thing, not settling.
And the other thing is,
when we were dating.
We had come on this conversation before,
and you had said if you
ever got to the point
where you were just complacent
and you had no drive,
I don't know if I could be with you.
- Did I say that to you?
- You said that to me.
- Oh! (laughs)
- Well, 'cause essentially it's like,
well if you ever--
- Dang, I was cutthroat. (laughs)
- Well no, I mean, but you made sense.
- Which is true, I can't be
with someone who's complacent.
- Right, so if I woulda just
stayed at a call center,
- Oh yeah, I woulda been like...
- And become like a call center manager,
and then whatever.
- Yeah, no.
Well, not even that, it's not even about--
- One, I would've hated myself.
- Well no, it's not even about
where or what you would be.
It's just like, if your drive
is to be the best call
center manager you can be--
- Then do it.
- Then, okay.
I can support that drive.
For me it was more just like,
I don't care what you wanna do
with your life, you just need
to have the drive and do it.
- Oh so now you remember!
Now you remember.
(Hallease laughs)
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- But so that was the other impetus,
that was the other spark.
- Dang, I said that?
- Sorry, so I kind of
took the reins there.
- No, that's fine.
I mean, like I just wanted
to talk to you about it.
Because the way I heard
that was just, like.
I don't know if it's just men,
especially someone like Will Smith.
I mean, he's always had drive.
He was already on Fresh
Prince before he met--
- I just thought that.
- Yeah, he was already on Fresh Prince
before he met Jada, right?
So he already obviously
had motivation, obviously.
But the fact that he feels like
the motivation came from her,
rather than of his own accord,
even though it's obvious
if you see the trajectory of his career,
he already had it, you know?
Why her?
Or like, why is he reducing
his own motivation to her?
- That might've just been the
fact that he's playing to,
which audience are you playing to?
- Mm, okay.
That's a fair point.
- Who listens to Red Table?
- Yeah, it's gonna be
mostly women, I mean.
- Right, but you elicit the same response
that his daughter had.
Which was you hear this wholesome man,
this like, I mean, essentially
America's sweetheart.
- Yeah, yeah totally.
- As a man.
This really approachable, like, dude.
And he says, Oh I would not be able to,
like I would've squandered my life, like,
looking for something,
if I wasn't with you.
Something along those lines.
- Well squandered, he's talking
about like if he was playing
fast and loose and just
having women, and you know.
- Or just like not being in a
stable relationship, I guess.
- Right, yeah.
- And then his daughter
cooed at it, and she said,
-  Aw.
- And that's the reaction--
- That he wants everyone
watching online to have.
- And again, we're not saying
that he's manipulative, but.
- No, that could genuinely be.
- If you see how well
catered all of this was,
and your point--
- Yes. (laughs)
- How am I, like I expect it now.
Like that's probably what he did.
- Right, and he even mentions in part two
where they talk about he is very,
he talks about how he was very aware
of how his family is
perceived by everybody.
Which, to his credit,
you should be, you know.
If you have that much
clout around yourself,
unfortunately, you need to
be self-aware, you know.
- Right, everything you say--
- Everything you say and do--
- Will be worked over
with a fine-tooth comb.
- Does matter, so you
have to have that level
of self-awareness in your life.
Even with us, like,
we're nobody. (chuckles)
And I am still self-aware
of what I represent.
- I am a somebody.
- To you.
- I am a strong, independent woman.
(Hallease laughs)
Who plays Aqua Lungers.
Aqua Lungers out on Steam.
- Stop it. (laughs)
But I'm very much aware of just
how I am perceived by everyone.
- I mean, so okay, let's do the feminist,
let's play this from a
feminist spin then, right?
- Okay, yeah.
- So why is he saying that
a woman has to be an object
of like manipulation?
- Oh!
- So it's like,
Oh, well, I find that I work best
through like, with a woman.
Not necessarily pushing
me, but like for a woman.
And it's like, that sounds
like it should be empowering
to a woman--
- But it's not.
- But it's really more like
you're just using them.
- Which, that's gonna be the next thing
I was gonna bring up.
- For your own gain, sorry.
- When she, when they talk--
No but yeah, when she talked about.
Yeah, I cut you off, I'm sorry.
(Hallease chuckles)
- Coffee.
- When Jada talks about how they met,
and how she had bought
a ranch in Baltimore.
And then he called and was
like all slick about it.
Well, you're seeing me now.
And she was like, Okay,
and just flew right back.
And never stepped foot on that ranch.
And Willow talks and mentions
like, Oh, well you know
I know that growing up with you now.
I know that life that
was something you wanted.
And then she didn't pursue it.
And true, it's of her own,
she made a choice, right?
We all make choices.
But it for me it spoke to a certain level
of how much women in general,
especially once they get
married, feel this pressure,
whether the spouse is actually
presenting that pressure
to them or not, to bend and
lose a bit of themselves.
- Homogenize to like, yeah.
- Yeah, to lose a bit of themselves.
'Cause I could see, you
know and she of course,
you know, the beauty of time, right?
She's like, Well, yeah, I
lost it, but what did I gain?
And of course, you know, her
daughter's sitting right there.
And she is happy about that, and her son.
But it is like, that was a life
you wanted for yourself, you know?
- What's a good example of that
is you possibly staying in L.A.--
- Mm-hm.
- If you weren't married
or like in a relationship.
And then also the last name thing.
'Cause that bothered you, too.
- Dude, that bothered me a lot!
- If you wanna talk
about those two things?
- I think I even, if you go
back far enough on my channel,
there's a video about it. (laughs)
- Oh, you slammed me on the
channel way back when, cool.
- I didn't slam you, I just--
- Link in the video above.
- (laughs) Yeah, so, yeah.
When I was in my undergraduate at UT,
the whole entire reason I went to UT
was for their film school.
And the whole reason I went
to that specific film school
was because they offered a
domestic study abroad program
where you could fly to L.A.
and spend a semester in L.A.
interning, learning the
business, and all that.
And the idea being that
like, ideally you'd do that
as one of your last semesters
and you'd just stay out there.
And you've spearheaded
yourself to start a career.
- This is the University of Texas,
not the University of Tennessee.
- Sorry.
- The UT.
- Sorry, the University
of Texas at Austin.
- Right, the proper one.
And then just start a
flame war with Tennessee.
- (Hallease laughs) Stop it!
So yeah, I had been studying
to do this UT L.A. program
for a while and then I met you.
And I remember that was
a point of (chuckles).
I remember that was a point of
contention for us for a bit,
was that I already, I remember
I let you know from the jump,
like, I'm still going to L.A.
That's not, I'm not changing
that just because I met you.
Even though I love you very much
and I want this relationship to work.
I will be very, I know I will resent you
if I don't go and try, you know?
And you were not okay for,
I mean, you got over it.
Leading up to me going, 'cause
it was like, I'm going, so.
- And I don't necessarily know.
So it wasn't you leaving that bothered me.
It was the prospect or the idea
that you would not come back.
Like you would go there
and either you would
like fall in love with the city,
fall in love with the culture,
or like find a really good job.
And then, like you would
not come back and so then.
It got in my head, and there's like,
Oh well, I don't need to stay here anyway.
Like, I'll just move
over there if need be.
- Right, yeah.
- But that also led me to proposing,
which I still contend was not a trap.
Like it was not me ensnaring you.
I still say that I was just
showing you my commitment.
(both laugh)
I was just showing you
my commitment in that,
it's like, I am serious
enough in this relationship
that there is something for you here.
Regardless of whether--
- Where here is?
- Whether you're coming
back to San Antonio.
Like, I am committed to you.
So if you're gonna stay in L.A.,
I will go to L.A. and find a job.
And I believe that's what
I had told you on the phone
at some point.
- Right, it was.
So fast forward, I went out
to L.A. already engaged.
And so that definitely painted
a color of how I saw L.A.
And you know, whether L.A.
had worked out or not,
what I ended up coming back from that was,
I do not regret going out there, you know.
I do not regret doing that for myself,
'cause it was a vision I'd
had for myself before you.
And it was something I
had worked so hard for
to build towards myself.
And for me it was, like, tying
it back to Will and Jada,
like knowing that Jada
never even got to experience
that life for herself.
And it was something that she obviously,
actively wanted to pursue.
Where it's like, you stopped acting.
You made the money you wanted to make,
stopped acting, and set yourself up
to have the life you wanted.
And you didn't even get
the opportunity to do that,
of your own choice, but still.
You missed it, you know what I mean?
- Right, so she could've just said,
Sure, but you're coming to me.
- Make it work.
You're coming to me or we're gonna do
some distance situation,
something, you know.
- But they were both very young
in the relationship, anyway.
- So were we, though.
- Well yeah, but you do stupid things.
- Well, yeah.
- Well I'm not saying what
she did was stupid, but.
I'm sure she might have
done things differently
had it been Jada as she is now
as opposed to Jada back when it happened.
- Yeah, totally.
So that was a bit that we,
that was a stint that we went through,
of one of us having
motivation and like dedication
to an idea regardless of the other person
that we wanted to pursue.
And then also, yeah, when
we finally did get married,
I definitely had like an
internal conflict with myself
on the name change.
Because I think a lot of it was because
I had defined myself.
I didn't realize how much I was...
Like, just with the name change,
how much you're forsaking your family.
- Well, how much your
identity is tied to that.
- Yeah, to your name, you know.
- 'Cause you had brought up,
well would you change your name?
And I was protective of it, too.
- Yeah, you were like, No!
And I remember telling you, like--
- What a part of the patriarchy, right?
(both laugh)
Idiot!
- Past you!
Also and I remember
breaking it down to you.
Like, yeah, I mean, you see
yourself as a Narvaez, right?
It's like, I am a Clemons, though,
that's not leaving me just
because I'm married to you.
I'm still who I am.
I don't wanna forsake my family.
- Right, so would you?
Okay, so what was the
compromise that you did?
- So the compromise.
Well it wasn't necessarily a compromise.
It was just something
my mother told me to do
because of the way Social Security works,
which is very frustrating.
So my full name is technically,
my last name is technically
Clemons Narvaez.
- No hyphen.
- No hyphen,
but there's a space.
But that wasn't a compromise,
that was a technicality. (laughs)
- Oh, and so I'm sure that
I know that your opinion
of it is still the same.
Would you do the same thing
if you could do it over again?
- Hindsight now, yes.
- Oh you would still do it.
- I would still do it.
Only because--
- What?
- I'm gonna explain why, though.
Because from an artist perspective,
Hallease Narvaez sounds
better than Hallease Clemons.
That's it, that's the
only reason. (laughs)
- If y'all are furrowing
your brow at home,
I am doing the same thing.
- I'm not gonna lie to you.
Artistically, like as an artist.
So many artists change their names, right?
- But I mean, if y'all
want a justification
that Mr. Hallease is a monster,
I mean, I guess this episode is that.
(Hallease laughs)
That we were gonna put
that out for prosperity,
or what do you call
it, is that prosperity?
- But so here's another reason why though.
- Now what's my (chuckles) sorry.
- No but here's another reason why,
if I could go back I wouldn't change--
- Posterity!
(both laugh)
Doing something for posterity.
It's gonna kill me,
someone's gonna correct me.
They're like, No, stupid!
You graduated from where?
- Oh my God.
- Idiot!
- But yeah, another reason
why if I could go back
I would still keep it,
is because I realized later on
that having Hallease was my
way to still keep my identity
but also acknowledge the commitment to you
that I had, too.
- Honoring the past, but--
- Honoring the past, but
acknowledging my new future.
So Hallease, for those
of y'all who don't know,
I go by my middle name, which is Hallease.
And that's my grandmother,
I was named after her.
And so, yeah, going by that
is like a way to always honor
where I've come from and
maintain that identity.
But and also recognize that I
am part of a different family
too, now, Narvaez.
And have that, too.
So in hindsight, yeah, I would still
go by Narvaez or whatever.
- Excuse me?
(Hallease chuckles)
Or whatever.
- Or whatever, yeah.
But it's tough, man,
workin' through all that.
From the feminine perspective.
'Cause I mean like, you didn't
have to think about that.
- That's the whole point
of getting married.
It's just like this big
social show of force, that...
Acknowledge before God
and all the other people
who effectively are the
god in your community,
and dictate who and what you are.
- Ooh, gettin' deep.
- Then it is known to them
that you are now merged as one being.
- One flesh.
- If you try to break it apart,
we still gonna talk behind your back.
Oh, she was with that man, that nasty man
that made her do things,
change her last name, ugh!
- You had some difficulties
when I was entertaining
the idea of not changing my name.
- But I also, so you said
I didn't have to go through
the same thing.
But you had asked me
and like propositioned,
if I would actually
legitimately change my name.
And so there was a couple days
where I was actually thinking about it.
Like, it wasn't the same level of distress
that you went through.
At least, like I'm not comparing it.
- No, but.
- But internally, it was...
- Yeah, you were like,
Oh, well damn. (laughs)
- I mean, we had even
like thought about it,
like what if we just changed
our names completely?
- Yeah, didn't we entertain that?
We were like, what if we just
came up with a new name then?
Yeah, but then we were like,
No, we're not ridiculous like that.
We can't take it that
far, that's too much.
- Well I mean it's like, it's two people
coming together as one, so
like we could've done that.
- We could've.
Our families were already like,
these people are (laughs).
- We eloped.
- We were already a lot for
both sides of the family
to deal with, we were
already a lot. (laughs)
- Whatever, man.
- We didn't need to push it.
- Leave and cleave.
- (laughs) Check that episode out.
- So, in summary.
- In summary.
- Mr. Hallease is a monster.
(Hallease laughs)
Will Smith used his wife for
his own gain, I did, too.
We're all flawed as far as men, and...
- No, in summary.
In summary, it's hard. (laughs)
In summary, you have outside forces.
- And inside forces.
- In summary,
and inside forces.
Full circle.
- That was my idea.
- Yeah, well it's like, you have...
No one's right,
I think is what the summary is.
- Is that just what we're gonna
come to every single episode?
- Well, it's just like you're just people.
You're just trying to
figure it out, you know.
And you have a lot of outside forces
as far as like social
structures and things like that
you have to deal with.
And either you conform to them,
or you make a concerted
effort to push past them.
And much of our story is
pushing past them. (laughing)
Sometimes begrudgingly.
To me, at the epicenter of
what I feel like my job is
as your wife...
Is to help you to be the best
version of yourself, right.
That's what I define being a wife as.
Nothing else.
- And I feel the same.
- How do you define being a
partner in a relationship?
What does that mean to you?
- And think about the
influences that you have
with other people.
- Yeah, what do you
expect from your partner
because of social constructs and culture.
And are those things actually good,
or do you think they might
be actually detrimental?
But anyway, you know, for what it's worth,
Will and Jada, thanks.
We'll see y'all next week, bye!
- Goodbye!
(Hallease laughs)
