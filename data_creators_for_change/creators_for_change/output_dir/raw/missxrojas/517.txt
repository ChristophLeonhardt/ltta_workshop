that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite an important s it was</font>

43
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,560
worth like forty percent or something

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,350
and it's just a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pressure on</font>

45
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,000
oneself I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really deal with it and</font>
