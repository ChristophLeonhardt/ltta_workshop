of all the topics Thanks hearing that I want to talk about this is the one I chose to make a video about but it's true that I'm animated by it because I actually think that it is a significant injustice and it is in defense of a guy I do not like at all I think it's a terrible guy his name is representative Joe Barton he is from Texas he's a congressman who has had 17 terms there he's not really a congressman from Texas he's a congressman from ExxonMobil the fossil fuel industry oil and gas industry give him a ton of money and he does exactly what they tell him to do and he's enormous ly corrupt in the in the way that all these congressmen are systemically corrupt and he seems to revel in it so why am i defending him he's caught in a so-called sex scandal first of all I don't think there was anything scandalous about it almost at all other than what the woman did to him so now there's a lot of really justifiable issues going around about outing men who have abused their power etc and we've talked a lot about that on the show but in this case this woman did not work with the congressman at all they had a five-year consensual relationship she was plenty of age there was just nothing wrong with the relationship I mean look he was there's some question as to whether he was technically divorced at the time I think that he it's he hooked up with other women as well and certainly some of that was while he was separated but not divorced from his wife this woman in particular might have been while he was still married to his wife that's his business that's not my business he shouldn't want on family values of course that's hypocrisy and and to some degree he does the Family Research Council backs him completely as a person of family values etc on the other hand during the Clinton scandal he said I don't give a fig about who he's sleeping with and what his wife were and him do that's their personal life now of course he said he was opposed to Clinton because of the lying under oath doesn't seem to care that much about Jeff Sessions lying under oath and and on and on it goes but that's normal level of hypocrisy so if you're wondering so what's going on so where's the scandal part well apparently she had a picture of him naked that he had sent her during the good times I suppose and even worse or depending on your perspective more outrageous whatever he had sent her a picture of him or video brief video under a minute of him masturbating first of all guys out there don't send anybody a video of you masturbating especially if you're in any way a public figure it will almost certainly come out okay now anyway it's a private matter and he didn't break the law and so then she threatens to send that video out apparently and why cuz she caught him cheating on her as well you guys are married they had sex twice and a five-year period that doesn't exactly sound like a relationship besides which none of that is our business threatening to send that stuff out publicly is potentially revenge porn totally unacceptable if if a guy had a video of a female congressman doing something like that and released it he would almost certainly be arrested almost certainly that is a private matter and that should not be release at all and by the way it's also illegal to publish that and guess who did for a brief period of time Infowars put that up now I don't know what their beef with Joe Barton is excuse the pun didn't mean that anyway but you can't put revenge porn on your website and that this sounds like almost the definition of it so as much as I enormous Lee disliked you apart not only this is fair to him at all now all of a sudden he's being lumped in with other people in the category of sexual harassment or whatever that some are doing that so we're not doing that I don't think that's fair at all for the people that are lumping him in there and and so look no matter what we do guys we have to be fair about what the facts of the situation are so in this case if he's a hypocrite on family values great and and call him out on that as as we are but overall it doesn't look like he did anything wrong legally or in the workplace and it sounds like she if she's the one who released it she did something significantly wrong if you ask me morally and ethically and perhaps legally and for Alex Jones and his web site who published it they also appear to be in some degree of legal trouble and if you're a right winger who thinks the revenge porn is terrible or great I don't know I don't know what your views on it are but it's a terrible thing to put out there whether it's revenge porn against a woman or against the man or even against a Republican I despise so be fair be consistent be principled in this case I don't think Joe Barton is the bad guy he is in a lot of other cases but not this case and I think that the people who put that out there and then who published it should honestly I mean it's it's against law they should be investigated it's totally wrong
