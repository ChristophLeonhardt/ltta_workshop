1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
this is one of those subdivisions just
off of Interstate 45 that has been here

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,510
in the town of Dickinson that has been
flooded out by the floodwaters that came

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,340
in overnight and this is an area where
we have seen boats criss crossing and

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,199
you know the images here that you're
seeing speak for themselves is just how

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,850
devastating the floodwaters and this is
an area where people went to bed last

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,019
night thinking that they were going to
be high and dry in one of the areas

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,460
where they were gonna be better off to
withstand the intense rain that was

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,910
coming in the floodwaters that was
coming down but you can see just how

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,820
much water the folks in this
neighborhood have taken on so many

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,539
people with their own boats have been
coming through this neighborhood pulling

11
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,120
people out that actually right now it is
incredibly quiet in fact not many people

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,920
if maybe only a handful by this time in
the day have are still are still in here

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,410
we have seen a couple of rooftops where
you can tell people have used axes to

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,909
punch their way through the Attic and
onto the roof top of their homes and

15
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,500
crazy enough in some of these places you
can still see like the porch light is

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,090
still on in some of these in some of
these homes the electricity still on but

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,500
you can just see how much water is in
this neighborhood everyone almost every

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,060
car submerged water you can see when you
look in through the windows the

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,490
furniture tossed around in inside the
floodwaters this is a little

20
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,340
neighborhood just adjacent to interstate
45 in the town of Dickinson you know

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,390
what as odd as we said here in Drive
Austin was telling us you know you have

22
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,670
to be incredibly careful when you're
driving through these neighborhoods he

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,049
on one of his last trips through here
Frederica he said he got lodged on top

24
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,909
of a on top of a car that was hard to
see but here you know navigating we are

25
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,659
we are into the trees that is how high
we are here in this water probably seven

26
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,310
eight feet of water in some places as
you know every car you've seen you're

27
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,199
submerged countless cars submerged you
can see that the water inside the home

28
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,060
here you can actually see look it's over
here to your right

29
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,390
if we look at these cars you can see the
coolers where people were managing their

30
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,319
way trying to get to higher ground push
their cars closer to the edge of the

31
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,580
rooftop so they could climb from their
cars onto the onto the rooftops Coast

32
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,060
Guard teams have been coming into this
neighborhood as well throughout the day

33
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,100
fredericka and and rescuing people you
can see here we are at the top of the

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,940
street signs at the intersection of
meadow court and Meadow Lane here so you

35
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,160
can see just how much water and this is
going on and on through through all of

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,180
this you look back into the there's a
bayou that stretches throughout this

37
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,070
back part of this neighborhood and you
and you can you can see just how

38
00:02:50,070 --> 00:00:00,000
dramatic the the pictures are here from
this neighborhood
