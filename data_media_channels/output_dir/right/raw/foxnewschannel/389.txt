00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:06,126
>> Shepard: BREAKING NEWS COMING

2
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:06,993
IN NOW.

3
00:00:06,994 --> 00:00:08,595
THIS IS A LIVE PICTURE AND THE

4
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:10,764
CAMERA IS ON A SWIVEL AT THE

5
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:11,231
MOMENT.

6
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:14,401
WE'VE GOT QUITE A RUCKUS.

7
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:18,371
LISTEN.

8
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:20,006
ARRESTS ARE BEING MADE.

9
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:23,276
THIS IS THE HEART SENATE OFFICE

10
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:27,847
BUILDING IN D.C.

11
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:31,451
PHILIP A. HART SENATE BUILDING

12
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:33,954
AND LOCATED AT SECOND STREET

13
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:34,721
NORTHEAST BETWEEN CONSTITUTION

00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:35,589
AVENUE AND C STREET.

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,258
A LOT OF PROTESTERS HAVE BEEN

16
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:38,625
OUT THERE.

17
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:39,993
THEY MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE

18
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:40,427
BUILDING.

19
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:42,162
THE POLICE JUST A SHORT TIME AGO

20
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:43,897
AS WE WERE WATCHING WHILE YOU

21
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:46,433
WERE IN COMMERCIAL ORDERING

22
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:49,236
EVERYBODY TO CEASE AND DESIST, I

23
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:49,569
SUPPOSE.

24
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:55,342
THEN BE AGAIN MAKING ARRESTS.

25
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:57,077
THEY'RE MAKING NUMEROUS ARRESTS

26
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:58,812
AS THE NEWS IS BREAKING.

27
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:01,314
THAT'S A LOOK UP TO THE CENTER

28
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:02,682
OF THE BUILDING.

29
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:04,818
THERE'S A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN

30
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,186
CONGREGATE AND HERE THAT AREA

31
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:06,453
IS.

32
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:09,456
LISTEN TO WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT

33
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:20,166
OF CHAOS IN THERE.

34
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,370
[CHANTING AND SHOUTING].

35
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,438
THERE'S BEEN PROTESTS, OF

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,210
COURSE, AS EXPECTED AND

37
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:30,977
ORGANIZED FROM MINUTE WHEN IT

38
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:32,178
WAS CLEAR THAT THIS VOTE WOULD

39
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:32,846
GO THIS WAY.

40
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:35,548
THE PROTESTERS ARE OUT AND ABOUT

41
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,550
ALL OVER THE DISTRICT THIS

42
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,685
AFTERNOON, I'M TOLD.

43
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:40,253
THE SENATE COULD MAKE A FINAL

44
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:42,455
DECISION AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING

45
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:44,758
HERE BY SATURDAY, MAYBE SUNDAY

46
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,093
IF THIS PRELIMINARY VOTE GETS

47
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:48,461
UNDERWAY AS SCHEDULED.

48
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:51,698
THE PRELIMINARY VOTE -- LET'S

49
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,233
GET TO CHAD PERGRAM WHO IS LIVE

50
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,634
ON CAPITOL HILL WHAT ARE WE

51
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:55,201
THINKING HERE?

52
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:56,536
>> I'VE BEEN TOLD IN THE PAST

53
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:58,038
TEN MINUTES, THEY WOULD EXPECT

54
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,375
THIS PROCEDURAL VOTE TO COME

55
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:03,376
SOMETIME IN THE LATE MORNING

56
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:05,111
TOMORROW BUT BEFORE LUNCH.

57
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:06,413
WHEN HAPPENS WHEN YOU VOTE TO

58
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:08,448
CUT OFF A FILIBUSTER IN DEBATE?

59
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,449
IT TAKES 51 VOTES.

60
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,686
IT INITIATES A 30-HOUR CLOCK.

61
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:15,689
SO LET'S SAY THEY VOTE AT 11:00

62
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:15,955
A.M.

63
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:19,159
IT TAKES 30 MINUTES TO HAVE THAT

64
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,826
ROLL CALL VOTE.

65
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:24,230
THEY CLOSE IT AT 11:30 AND COUNT

66
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,332
30 HOURS PASSED THAT.

67
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,434
THAT WOULD GET TO 5:00, 6:00

68
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,235
SATURDAY NIGHT IF THE DEMOCRATS

69
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,704
BURN ALL 30 HOURS.

70
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:32,739
YOU CAN MAKE THE SUNRISE IN THE

71
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,307
WEST IF YOU GOT UNANIMOUS

72
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:34,641
CONCERT.

73
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:36,076
THEY CAN MOVE IT UP OR BACK IF

74
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:39,879
ALL 100 SENATORS AGREE.

75
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,515
WHAT IS UNKNOWN IF THE DEMOCRATS

76
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,317
WILL USE THEIR TIME ONCE IT'S

77
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,553
PUT IN MOTION SOMETIME TOMORROW,

78
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:46,853
SHEP.

79
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:47,620
>> Shepard: THESE DEMONSTRATIONS

80
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:49,055
NOT UNEXPECTED I GUESS.

81
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:51,558
>> RIGHT, THIS IS A BIG

82
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,726
NOMINATION, TENSIONS ARE HIGH

83
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:53,026
HERE.

84
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:54,694
A LOT OF PROTESTERS IN THE

85
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:55,061
BUILDING.

86
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:57,263
I WAS OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL.

87
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:58,998
THEY PUT UP A BARRICADE AROUND

88
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,735
THE CAPITOL THAT ONLY PEOPLE

89
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:03,837
WITH HARD PASSES CAN GET IN OR

90
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:04,437
OUT.

91
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:06,039
THEY'RE ESCORTING SENATORS TO

92
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,073
AND FROM VOTES.

93
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:10,076
I FOLLOWED LISA MURKOWSKI FROM

94
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:10,410
ALASKA.

95
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:11,478
SHE LEFT THE SKIFF WHERE THEY

96
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,714
WERE BRIEFING SENATORS ON THE

97
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:15,615
FBI REPORT.

98
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:17,117
I TOOK THIS PASS THROUGH THE

99
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:18,651
BASEMENT OF THE CAPITOL, THROUGH

100
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:20,320
THE VISITORS CENTER AND CAME OUT

101
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,688
ON THE HOUSE SIDE.

102
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:22,856
THAT'S WHERE I TALKED TO HER

103
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:24,257
ABOUT 1 1/2 HOURS AGO.

104
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:25,825
SHE SAYS THAT SHE HAS NOT YET

105
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:27,627
MADE A DECISION.

106
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:30,363
SHE DOES SAY THAT IT IS DECISION

107
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:30,663
TIME.

108
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:32,632
WHAT WE THINK THE MATH IS RIGHT

109
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:33,967
NOW, AT A MINIMUM, MITCH

110
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,535
McCONNELL WILL GET 50 VOTES IN

111
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:36,436
THIS NOMINATION.

112
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:41,541
IF HE GETS COLLINS, JEFF FLAKE,

113
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:45,678
MAYBE LISA MURKOWSKI.

114
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,715
IF HE'S 50/50, THE PRESIDENT

115
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:51,918
HAVE BREAK A TIE.

116
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,719
NEVER HAS A VICE PRESIDENT

117
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,387
BROKEN THE TIE.

118
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,156
IS THAT YOUR NOT TALKING ABOUT

119
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:57,557
JOE MANCHIN.

120
00:03:57,558 --> 00:04:00,393
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO BE THE 51st

121
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:00,693
VOTE.

122
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,262
HE SIGNALLED YESTERDAY THAT HE

123
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:03,530
MIGHT BE LEANING IN THAT

124
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:04,898
DIRECTION, BUT WE'RE NOT SURE,

125
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:05,198
SHEP.

126
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,132
>> Shepard: IF IT'S A DONE DEAL,

127
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,634
IT'S A POSSIBILITY AGAIN.

128
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,135
HE'S IN THE SKIFF STILL LOOKING

129
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:09,669
AT THIS.

130
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,471
CHAD, STAY WITH US, IF YOU

131
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:11,771
COULD.

132
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:13,807
WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE

133
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:14,274
DEMONSTRATIONS.

134
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:16,776
THE ARRESTS APPEAR TO BE

135
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:19,078
HAPPENING IN SOMEWHAT ORDERLY

136
00:04:19,079 --> 00:00:00,000
FASHION.
