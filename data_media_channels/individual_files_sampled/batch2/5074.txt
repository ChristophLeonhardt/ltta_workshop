in addition to North Korea Russia was a big topic at that joint news conference yesterday following days of mixed messages from the White House President Trump yesterday discussed where the administration stands on adding new sanctions on Moscow for its continued support of the Assad regime we will have that is a question there has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump we had a very very severe we were talking about it a little while fight in Syria recently a month ago between our troops and Russian troops and that's very sad but many people died in that fight but Russia will tell you there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump that comment came after President Trump's new director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow said that UN Ambassador nikki Haley had some momentary confusion in his words when she announced new sanctions would be imminent over the weekend Haley responded to that stating simply with all due respect I don't get confused and could lo reportedly later apologized to Haley yesterday Trump spoke about having could lo on his team and Haley was asked about being on Trump's team I'm very happy to have Larry Kudlow with us he's a special man he's been a friend I've been on this show many many times over the years and we've had a lot of fun together we haven't always agreed but I know this lately Larry's she said it's perfect there in case you couldn't see the text on the screen again Donald Trump talking about Larry Kudlow he likes them to the extent that Larry Kudlow yeah and agrees with them and can we also just dispel this the president I have been the toughest on Russia that anyone has I mean I would like to talk to some Republican members of Congress to see if they agree I mean fact-check not true well you know what we just saw and heard Richard a message discipline is important obviously for a President of the United States we just saw there was no message discipline here so what's the level of concern in the world of diplomats around the world about the potential meeting between the president and the leader of North Korea in that he would glibly agree to something during the course of the negotiation that we would have no intention of carrying out well I thought you're gonna go somewhere else that they would glibly agree or not take out the word glibly that he would agree to terms worse that we might carry out and the feeling is McDonald Trump essentially there's no Givens there's no assumptions and there's very little that sacred so a lot of the tenets of American foreign policy that have served us pretty well for three-quarters of a century there's tremendous concern in places like Japan and South Korea excuse me that he could put those on the table and that's that's the real concern Josh what do you see when you watch the nikki Haley Donald Trump back and forth over the last several days as someone who's been inside the White House and has had to discipline a message and roll out sanctions and make some kind of announcement on a Sunday show as nikki Haley did what how did that happen in this case how could that possibly happen well I certainly can't speak to the inner workings of the Trump administration but they're I think they're a couple of things that jumped out at me the first is nikki Haley doesn't go on a Sunday show without doing some prep right so she clearly had some conversations probably with folks at the National Security Council that gave her an indication that these sanctions were coming I'm also confident that she wouldn't have leaned into them so heavily if she wasn't given serious assurances at a high level that they actually were coming soon the other thing that jumped out to me about this is you noted that mr. Kudlow apologized to her he apologized to her by saying well apparently ambassador Haley wasn't given all the relevant information so it's not just that she was confused she was totally out of the loop right that's not really the way that I think that my guess is she didn't really appreciate the apology apology either I think she took the right approach of basically trying to let this die and if we know anything about the Trump White House's they'll be some new scandal today that overshadows this disagreement but it is an indication that to me like of larry cudlow who has not served in government is already showing evidence of that he's having a hard time mounting a united front here he's used to being in charge of his own television show not being part of the team and you talk you talk loosely he's on TV hang and you know he just does had a word like confuse the other part of this that I think that is important is there continues to be we continue to see the seams of the Trump administration policy on Russia President Trump continues to being pushed by people at a high level whether it's his UN Ambassador or other officials in the National Security Council who are telling him if we actually want to crack down on serious use of chemical weapons we need to put pressure on Russia to get them to make him stop and president Trump is unwilling to do it so it's not that he is tougher than anybody on Russia if anything he is weaker than anybody on Russia and that's been true since the first day of his administration I should be selectively tough I mean some of the sanctions are significant the fact that the United States finally agreed to provide defensive articles lethal defensive articles to Ukraine something the Obama administration wouldn't do to me it was a significant step the major gap is in any response to what the Russians have done to the meddling in the American election and then more recently the reaction to chemical so it's all over the place Russia policy everyone hold these thoughts we're just getting started here still ahead on Morning Joe president Trump relatively restrained when talking against turday about Rob Rosenstein but his allies on Capitol Hill are digging in follows new warnings that the Deputy Attorney General could soon face impeachment proceedings if he doesn't meet Republican demands thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
