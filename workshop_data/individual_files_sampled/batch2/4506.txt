thing one tonight on his very first trip abroad as president Donald Trump got a hearty welcome in Saudi Arabia a country where all forms of protest are banned something no one seems to have told his Commerce Secretary there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there not one guy with a bad placard the mood was a genuinely good mood can you imagine that not a single protester in Saudi Arabia a genuinely good mood it'll be a very different mood in Britain next week where tens of thousands are expected to protest Trump's first UK visit since taking office opposition to the president in Britain is so robust nearly 2 million people signed a petition opposing an official state visit and Trump canceled a planned visit earlier this year amid fears of mass protests but as of now he will be showing up in London next Friday for the long overdue visit and one Brit has prepared a special form of protest designed to get under Trump's skin which he says is specifically tailored to bother a man who feels no shame that's thing too in 60 seconds so Donald Trump is headed to the UK for the first time as president next week and today London Mayor Sadiq Khan gave the go-ahead to a unique former protest a 20 foot tall inflatable orange baby with the face of the president which will float over Britain's Parliament during Trump's visit as tens of thousands take to the streets to protest his presence the balloon was specifically designed to get under Trump's skin organiser Leo Murray saying quote moral outrage has no effect on Trump because he has no shame he's immune to it but he's a tremendously fragile ego so ridicules ineffective former protests so we want to make sure he knows that all of Britain is looking down on him and laughing at him could be a rude awakening for a president who doesn't really seem to understand how he's viewed by our friends across the pond I think I'm very popular in your country let's not be too hasty mr. president no but I believe that I really do I believe so much fan mail from people in your country they love my my my sense of security they love what I'm saying about many different things hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
