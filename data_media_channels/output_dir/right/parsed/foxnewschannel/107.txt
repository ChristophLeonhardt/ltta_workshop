MCCOWAN TEXAS, A FEW FAMILY
UNITS COMING ACROSS.
LET ME TOUCH ON THE IMAGES WE'RE
SEEING FROM GUATEMALA.
SECRETARY POMPEO HAVING A
MEETING WITH MEXICAN OFFICIALS.
THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND
IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS HERE ALSO
PLAYING A PART IN THOSE TALKS.
WHEN YOU TALK TO OFFICIALS DOWN
HERE, THEY'RE OPTIMISTIC TO SEE
THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION FROM
THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IN
ATTEMPTING TO ASSIST IN KEEPING
THAT CARAVAN FROM REACHING OUR
BORDER WHICH IS HUNDREDS OF
MILES FROM WHERE I'M STANDING.
AS YOU SEE FROM THAT RIVER IN
GUATEMALA, IT'S VERY POROUS,
MUCH LIKE THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY
RIVER HERE THAT MIGRANTS HAVE
BEEN COMING ACROSS ALL DAY.
THEY ARE STREAMING 500, 600
OFFICIALS DOWN THERE TO STOP IT.
THEY HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES.
OFFICIALS VERY ENCOURAGED TO SEE
THEM TRY AND HELP IN A WAY THEY
HAVEN'T REALLY HELPED THAT MUCH
IN RECENT HISTORY IN TRYING TO
STAVE OFF THE OVERFLOW OF
IMMIGRANTS COMING.
DANA?
>> Dana: GRIFF, WHAT IS IT LIKE
WHERE YOU ARE?
IT LOOKS CALM, BUT I KNOW THOSE
AGENTS HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL.
>> Reporter: IT'S BEEN VERY BUSY
ALL MORNING LONG.
WE HAVE SEEN FOUR OR FIVE
DIFFERENT GROUPS.
WE'VE MADE ARRESTS OF 20, 30,
35.
OFFICIALS TELL ME THE AVERAGE
NUMBER OF ARRESTS, ILLEGAL
CROSSING ARRESTS IN THIS SECTOR
OF THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY IS OVER
640 A DAY.
IT IS AN UNBELIEVABLE
OVERWHELMING NUMBER.
SINCE THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE
FAMILY UNIT THAT HAS JUST COME
ACROSS BECAUSE I CAN'T SHOW YOU,
THEY'VE SEEN A 300% INCREASE.
SO EVEN BEFORE THAT CARAVAN GETS
HERE, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A
FLOODING BORDER RIGHT HERE AND
OFFICIALS TRYING TO GET THIS
UNDER CONTROL WILL HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THINGS LIKE THAT CARAVAN,
SHOULD THEY SHOW UP.
SO OUR VIEWERS UNDERSTAND, IF
YOU SHOW UP AND CLAIM ASYLUM,
YOU WILL BE GIVEN A FAIR
HEARING.
THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE SOME OF
THE CARAVAN MAY DO.
WHEN YOU HAVE 640 ILLEGAL
CROSSERS EVERY MORNING THAT
BORDER PATROL HAS TO CHASE, IT'S
QUITE A TASK AND ONE THE
ADMINISTRATION IS RIGHT TO
