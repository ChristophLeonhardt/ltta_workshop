MUELLER.

00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:18,885
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE FORMER 

14
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,119
DEPUTY CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN OF THE

FALSE STATEMENTS IN THE RUSSIA 

20
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:27,493
PROBE.

21
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:28,828
HE HAS BEEN INDICTED, CHARGED 

22
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,997
WITH SEVERAL COUNTS OF FRAUD, 

23
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,365
CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE UNITED

00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:41,374
WANT TO GET ALL THE DETAILS NOW 

31
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,808
FROM OUR CHIEF JUSTICE 

32

CORRESPONDENT PIERRE THOMAS.

33
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:44,243
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.

34
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:46,713
RICK GATES, FORMER DEPUTY 

35
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,847
CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR PRESIDENT 

36
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,148
TRUMP'S ELECTION BID, IS TODAY 

37
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:49,949
PLEADING GUILTY.

38
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,885
TWO COUNTS, FIRST HE'S PLEADING 

39
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,319
GUILTY FOR ENGAGING IN A 

40
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,787
CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED

41
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:55,988
STATES GOVERNMENT BY NOT 

42
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:57,423
REPORTING FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS 

43
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,058
THAT COULD BE TAXED, AND FAILING

44
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,027
TO REGISTER AS A FOREIGN AGENT 

45
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,529
FOR WORK ON BEHALF OF UKRAINIAN 

46
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:04,730
OFFICIALS WHO HAD CLOSE TIES TO 

47
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,598
THE KREMLIN.

48
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,932
GATES IS ALSO PLEADING GUILTY TO

49
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:08,534
ONE COUNT OF LYING TO A SPECIAL 

50
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,136
COUNSEL ABOUT THE NATURE OF WORK

51
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,638
DONE FOR THOSE UKRAINIAN 

52
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,005
OFFICIALS.

53
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,173
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL OFFICE 

54
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,474
CLAIMS THAT GATES ENGAGED IN 

55
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:18,044
THIS CONSPIRACY WITH PAUL 

56
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:18,577
MANAFORT, TRUMP'S FORMER 

57
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:19,078
CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN.

58
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,512
MANAFORT HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY 

59
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:22,381
BUT NOW ONE OF HIS PRINCIPAL 

60
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,784
BUSINESS PARTNERS IS SET TO BE 

61
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:25,418
AND COOPERATING WITH THE SPECIAL

62
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,655
COUNSEL.

63
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,655
SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE 

64
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,224
ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR 

65
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:31,491
MANAFORT.

66
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,891
>> UNDER THE DOZENS OF CHARGES 

67
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:34,493
HE WAS FACING BEFORE TODAY'S 

68
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:35,528
PLEA AGREEMENT, HE COULD HAVE 

69
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,864
FACED YEARS AND YEARS IN PRISON.

70
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,898
WHAT SHOULD HE EXPECT NOW?

71
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,401
>> WELL, HE FACES AT LEAST UP TO

72
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,236
20 YEARS IN PRISON UNDER SOME OF

73
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,270
THOSE PREVIOUS CHARGES.

74
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,905
BUT BY OUR CALCULATIONS, HE'S 

75
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,608
LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE MAXIMUM OF 

76
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,943
BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN YEARS IN 

77
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,310
PRISON, GEORGE.

78
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,444
>> THAT'S THE MAXIMUM.

79
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,246
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE 

80
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,013
RECOMMENDATION OF THE SPECIAL 

81
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,148
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.

82
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:55,448
>> EXACTLY.

83
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,150
WE EXPECT THAT HE'S GOING TO 

84
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,084
COOPERATE, GEORGE, AND THAT 

85
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,586
COULD GIVE HIM MUCH MORE LENIENT

86
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,219
TIME, AS WELL.

87
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,487
>> OKAY, PIERRE, THANKS VERY 

88
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:01,854
MUCH.

89
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:03,655
WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF LEGAL

90
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:04,790
ANALYST DAN ABRAMS.

91
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,958
RIGHT NOW THE BIG QUESTION WITH 

92
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,193
THIS AGREEMENT WHAT DID HE GIVE 

93
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,127
TO ROBERT MUELLER TO GET IT?

94
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:09,794
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY 

95
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:10,895
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS DEAL 

96
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:11,464
UNLESS THEY FELT GATES HAD 

97
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,031
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO 

98
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,833
OFFER THEM.

99
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,001
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING OUT 

100
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,037
THERE, WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS IS 

101
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,806
SO THEY CAN HELP GET HIS FORMER 

102
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,006
BOSS.

103
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,041
BUT MUELLER ALREADY HAD -- 

104
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,241
RIGHT.

105
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,676
SO MUELLER MAY NOT HAVE NEEDED 

106
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,643
GATES FOR MANAFORT.

107
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:26,179
SO THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO THE 

108
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,380
REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION.

109
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,215
WHICH IS, WHAT ELSE MIGHT GATES 

110
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,284
BE ABLE TO OFFER?

111
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,452
HE WAS THERE.

112
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,152
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION.

113
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:36,389
HE TLFS DURING THE TRANSITION.

114
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,090
HE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP MUELLER 

115
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,627
PUT SOME OF THESE PIECES 

116
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,030
TOGETHER, WITH REGARD TO THE 

117
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,131
COLLUSION THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL

118
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:45,898
PART OF THIS CASE.

119
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,533
>> NOW WE HAVE THREE TOP 

120
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,668
OFFICIALS, THREE OFFICIALS IN 

121
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,305
THE CAMPAIGN WHO'VE ALL GONE NOW

122
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,107
WITH ROBERT MUELLER.

123
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,308
MIKE FLYNN, GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS 

124
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,676
FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER, RICK 

125
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,545
GATES, DEPUTY CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN.

126
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,112
>> AND EACH ONE OF THEM ARE 

127
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:01,514
GOING TO BE OFFERING INFORMATION

128
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,482
THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FEELS 

129
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:05,585
IS IMPORTANT NOT IN SOME MINOR 

130
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,719
ISSUE, BUT YOU MAKE THESE KINDS 

131
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,587
OF DEALS, BECAUSE THE SPECIAL 

132
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,189
COUNSEL THINKS THAT THEY CAN 

133
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,991
OFFER INFORMATION.

134
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,026
THEY CAN TESTIFY AGAINST CERTAIN

135
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,393
PEOPLE.

136
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,329
THEY CAN OFFER TIMES, AND DATES,

137
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,697
AND PHONE CALLS, THAT ARE 

138
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,631
RELEVANT TO THIS INVESTIGATION.

139
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,999
AND SPEAKING OF THAT, I THINK 

140
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,033
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONE 

141
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,035
OF THE TWO COUNTS THAT GATES IS 

142
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:25,338
PLEADING GUILTY TO IS A FALSE 

143
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,506
STATEMENT MADE THIS MONTH.

144
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,606
>> JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

145
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,909
>> WHILE THEY WERE TRYING TO 

146
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,910
NEGOTIATE THIS DEAL.

147
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,211
WHICH SHOWS YOU THAT THEY ARE 

148
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,180
SAYING, HE WAS LYING TO US EVEN 

149
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,448
AS WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 

150
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:36,649
THIS.

151
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,251
>> NOW THERE IS A MAJOR 

152
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,285
DEVELOPMENT IN THE RUSSIA 

153
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:39,618
INVESTIGATION.

154
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:40,319
MUCH MORE TONIGHT ON "WORLD NEWS

155

156
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,556
HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON.

157
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,091
>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 

158
00:03:45,091 --> 00:00:00,000
REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
