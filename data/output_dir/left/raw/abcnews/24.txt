1
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,325
THIS WILL BE A LONG AND PAINFUL 

2
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:43,263
TIME FOR THESE PARENTS AS THEY 

3
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,664
WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH WHAT HAS 

4
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,533
TO BE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE 

5
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,302
THEY'VE EVER DEALT WITH.

6
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,504
WE MOURN WITH THEM.

7
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,308
WE MOURN AS FELLOW TEXANS.

8
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,379
BUT WE MUST COME TOGETHER AS ONE

9
00:02:59,379 --> 00:02:59,646
COMMUNITY.

10
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,548
AT THIS TIME OF ENORMOUS 

11
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:02,815
SUFFERING.

12
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:07,486
AND SHOW THE VICTIMS AND 

13
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:09,656
FAMILIES THE SUPPORT THEY NEED.

14
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,891
WE APPRECIATE ALL THE FIRST 

15
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,192
RESPONDERS WHO HAVE ALREADY 

16
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,261
STEPPED UP TO HELP RESPOND TO 

17
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,329
THIS CHALLENGE.

18
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,031
AND WE LOOK TO GOD TO GIVE THE 

19
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,601
FIRST RESPONDERS AS WELL AS THE 

20
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,202
VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES THE 

21
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,971
GUIDANCE THEY NEED IN THE COMING

22
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,440
DAYS AND WEEKS, AS WE WORK TO 

23
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,175
CONTINUE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

24
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,776
WHAT HAPPENED AND VERY 

25
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:31,410
IMPORTANTLY WORK TO RESPOND TO 

26
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,213
THIS CHALLENGE.

27
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,550
I ASK THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO

28
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,086
JOIN TEXAS IN MOURNING THE LOSS 

29
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:44,690
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, THESE 

30
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:44,957
STUDENTS.

31
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,826
AND TO OFFER YOUR PRAYERS IN 

32
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:49,095
SUPPORT OF THESE FAMILIES.

33
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:53,333
AND I ASK EVERY PARENT OUT 

34
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,867
THERE, WHEREVER YOU MAY BE, TO 

35
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:55,401
HOLD YOUR CHILDREN CLOSE 

36
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,403
TONIGHT.

37
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,037
AND LET THEM KNOW HOW MUCH YOU 

38
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:06,079
LOVE THEM.

39
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,014
NOW, WE HAVE TWO GOALS GOING 

40
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:12,218
FORWARD.

41
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,154
THE IMMEDIATE GOAL IS TO WORK IN

42
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,791
THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THIS 

43
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,326
CATASTROPHE, AND GATHER EVIDENCE

44
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,295
AND INFORMATION THAT'S NEEDED TO

45
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,830
ENSURE THIS CRIME WILL BE 

46
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,965
PROSECUTED APPROPRIATELY.

47
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,600
WHILE ALSO WORKING TO ENSURE WE 

48
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,002
PROVIDE THE FAMILIES AND VICTIMS

49
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:33,906
AS WELL AS ALL THE CHILDREN AT 

50
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,642
THIS SCHOOLS AND ACROSS THE 

51
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:39,512
DISTRICT WITH THE SUPPORT, 

52
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,115
RESOURCES, AND COUNSELING THEY 

53
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,416
NEED.

54
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,117
SECOND, WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN 

55
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,419
JUST PRAY FOR THE VICTIMS AND 

56
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,653
THEIR FAMILIES.

57
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:50,723
IT'S TIME IN TEXAS THAT WE TAKE 

58
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:56,295
ACTION TO STEP UP AND MAKE SURE 

59
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,930
THIS TRAGEDY IS NEVER REPEATED 

60
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,698
EVER AGAIN IN THE HISTORY OF THE

61
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,735
STATE OF TEXAS.

62
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,103
SO, BEGINNING IMMEDIATELY, I'M 

63
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,872
GOING TO BE WORKING WITH MEMBERS

64
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,574
OF THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE, BUT 

65
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,943
ALSO MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES 

66
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:15,515
ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF TEXAS

67
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:20,119
TO BEGIN WITH ROUNDTABLE 

68
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,421
DISCUSSIONS, BEGINNING NEXT 

69
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:28,127
WEEK, WHERE WE WILL ASSEMBLE ALL

70
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,397
STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK IMMEDIATELY

71
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,732
ON SWIFT SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT 

72
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,134
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS FROM EVER 

73
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:35,902
HAPPENING AGAIN.

74
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,737
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM PARENTS, 

75
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:42,308
STUDENTS, EDUCATORS, CONCERNED 

76
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,978
CITIZENS, FROM THOSE WHO HOLD A 

77
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,346
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT IN HIGH 

78
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:47,579
ESTEEM.

79
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,114
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM EVERYBODY 

80
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:51,884
WHO HAS AN INTEREST IN WHAT HAS 

81
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:55,588
HAPPENED TODAY SO WE CAN WORK 

82
00:05:55,588 --> 00:06:00,392
TOGETHER SO WE CAN PUT TOGETHER 

83
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,162
LAWS THAT ENSURE OUR SCHOOLS ARE

84
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:03,963
SAFER PLACES.

85
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,365
THESE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE 

86
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,933
BACKGROUND CHECKS, AND KEEPING 

87
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,569
GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE 

88
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,372
WHO POSE AN IMMEDIATE DANGER TO 

89
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,975
OTHERS.

90
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,512
PROVIDING MORE RESOURCES TO OUR 

91
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:19,912
SCHOOLS.

92
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,548
AND PROVIDING RESOURCES TO 

93
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,785
ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

94
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,020
BEHIND GUN VIOLENCE, WITH A 

95
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,858
FOCUS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE.

96
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,995
IT ALSO MEANS PERHAPS EXPANDING 

97
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,230
A PROGRAM WHERE THERE ARE WAYS 

98
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,666
OF MEASURING MENTAL HEALTH 

99
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,301
CHALLENGES OF STUDENTS, AND 

100
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,670
BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO

101
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,741
MAY POST A RISK AND LOOKING TO 

102
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:53,779
DEPLOY THOSE STRATEGIES IN 

103
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:54,346
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE 

104
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:55,648
STATE OF TEXAS.

105
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,084
AFTER A CATASTROPHE LIKE THIS, 

106
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,185
THE ANSWERS ARE NOT ALWAYS 

107
00:06:59,185 --> 00:06:59,886
IMMEDIATE.

108
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,354
BUT THEY WILL COME WITH US 

109
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:01,754
WORKING TOGETHER.

110
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,924
I WANT TO COVER SOME OF THE 

111
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,959
DETAILS OF WHERE WE STAND RIGHT 

112
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,660
NOW.

113
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,094
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WILL BE 

114
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,430
PROVIDING UPDATES LATER.

115
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,200
I MENTIONED THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN 

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,603
IDENTIFIED AS BEING DECEASED AND

117
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,838
WOUNDED.

118
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:23,509
AND WE WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON

119
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,244
THAT LATER ON.

120
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,647
WE ARE STILL, LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

121
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,849
STILL IN THE PROCESS OF 

122
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,587
UNDERTAKING BOTH SEARCHES AND 

123
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,756
INVESTIGATION OF THE ENTIRE 

124
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,091
SCENE, AS WELL AS OTHER 

125
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:39,358
LOCATIONS.

126
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,295
THEY HAVE WARRANTS OUT CON

127
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,530
CONCERNING THE PERSON 

128
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,899
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOOTING, 

129
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,200
WARRANTS TO SEARCH TWO 

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,467
RESIDENTS.

131
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:52,371
THE REASON WHY THERE IS SOME 

132
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,074
SLOWNESS IN BEING ABLE TO 

133
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:55,675
UNDERTAKE THE SEARCHES IS 

134
00:07:55,675 --> 00:08:00,245
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR 

135
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,482
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES INSIDE THE 

136
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,116
RESIDENTS, THEY WANT TO MAKE 

137
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,719
SURE THEY CAN ENTER THEM WITHOUT

138
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,021
ANYONE BEING HARMED.

139
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,923
ONE REASON FOR THE CONCERN IS 

140
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:14,994
THAT DIFFERENT KINDS OF 

141
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,230
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HAVE BEEN 

142
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,497
DETECTED.

143
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:23,469
ONE WAS A CO2 DEVICE, ANOTHER 

144
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,673
WAS A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL.

145
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,544
BOTH IN A HOME AS WELL AS A 

146
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:31,944
VEHICLE.

147
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,645
THERE'S ALSO A SEARCH WARRANT 

148
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:43,956
OUT FOR THE VEHICLE OF THE 

149
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:44,389
SH

150
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,157
SHOOTER.

151
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:45,457
A

152
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:48,093
WE ALSO KNOW INFORMATION ALREADY

153
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,763
THAT THE SHOOTER HAS INFORMATION

154
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,298
CONTAINED IN JOURNALS ON HIS 

155
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:55,234
COMPUTER AND A CELL PHONE THAT 

156
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,302
HE SAID, NOT ONLY DID HE WANT TO

157
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,938
COMMIT THE SHOOTING, BUT HE 

158
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:00,839
WANTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE AFTER 

159
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:01,807
THE SHOOTING.

160
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,476
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, HE GAVE 

161
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,345
HIMSELF UP.

162
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,115
AT THE TIME, HE ADMITTED HE 

163
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,583
DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO 

164
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,986
COMMIT THE SUICIDE, THAT HE 

165
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,556
WANTED TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE 

166
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,824
EARLIER.

167
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,627
HE'S COUURRENTLY AT THE SANTA F 

168
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,861
POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY'RE 

169
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:26,665
WORKING WITH THE FBI AND TEXAS 

170
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:29,435
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, 

171
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,438
ATF, AND THE GALVESTON POLICE 

172
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:35,174
DEPARTMENT AND SHERIFF'S OFFICE.

173
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,376
THIS WILL BE HANDLED 

174
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:39,912
COLLABORATIVELY, BY BOTH FEDERAL

175
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:48,421
AND STATE PROSECUTORS.

176
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:48,721
S

177
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,924
SO YOU'LL KNOW, THERE ARE ONE OR

178
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,459
TWO OTHER PEOPLE OF INTEREST 

179
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,028
BEING INTERVIEWED.

180
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,964
ONE WAS A PERSON WHO WAS AT THE 

181
00:09:58,964 --> 00:09:59,164
SCENE.

182
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:07,206
WE WANT DEFINITIVELY SAY WHETHER

183
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,108
OR NOT THERE WAS SOME 

184
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,776
INVOLVEMENT, WE WANT TO MAKE 

185
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,413
SURE THEY'RE ADEQUATELY 

186
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:14,747
INVESTIGATED.

187
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,948
AND THERE'S ANOTHER PERSON THAT 

188
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,816
WE HAVE CERTAIN INFORMATION, WE 

189
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:20,419
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'LL BE 

190
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:25,891
FULLY INTERVIEWED TO MAKE SURE 

191
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,228
THERE IS MORE INFORMATION TO BE 

192
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:29,628
GLEANED.

193
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,131
AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD, THE 

194
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,399
WEAPONS USED IN THIS ATTACK, 

195
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,535
THERE ARE TWO WEAPONS.

196
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:42,808
ONE WAS A SHOTGUN, AND THE OTHER

197
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,977
IS A .38 REVOLVER.

198
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:47,346
NEITHER OF THESE WEAPONS WERE 

199
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,981
OWNED OR LEGALLY POSSESSED BY 

200
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,750
THE SHOOTER.

201
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,018
IT'S MY INFORMATION THAT BOTH 

202
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,688
WEAPONS WERE OBTAINED BY THE 

203
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,989
SHOOTER FROM HIS FATHER.

204
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,191
IT'S MY INFORMATION AT THE TIME,

205
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,428
THE FATHER LEGALLY OWNED THESE 

206
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,028
WEAPONS.

207
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,630
I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION WHETHER

208
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,335
OR NOT THE FATHER WAS AWARE THE 

209
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,069
SON HAD TAKEN THE WEAPONS FROM 

210
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,337
THE FATHER.

211
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,641
I DO WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE 

212
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,942
MULTITUDE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 

213
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,210
AGENCIES WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 

214
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,979
IN THIS PROCESS.

215
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:24,650
THE SANTA FE POLICE DEPARTMENT, 

216
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:30,389
GALVESTON SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AND 

217
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:39,598
THE FBI AND ATF, THE GALVESTON 

218
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:43,169
POLICE DEPARTMENT, HARRIS COUNTY

219
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,672
SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AND OTHERS.

220
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,373
TWO THINGS WE'RE WORKING ON AS 

221
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,442
WE SPEAK.

222
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:53,979
ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PARENTS

223
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,750
ARE GOING TO BE NOTIFIED AS 

224
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,650
SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE.

225
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,887
ONE THING THAT DEPENDS UPON IS 

226
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:08,994
HOW SWIFTLY THE CRIME SCENE IS 

227
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:09,495
GOING TO BE DEALT WITH.

228
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,430
THE CONCERN BEING FOR THE 

229
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,899
POTENTIAL OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES 

230
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,802
ON THE CRIME SCENE.

231
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,402
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE 

232
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,638
WORKED ON IN A SHORT PERIOD OF 

233
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,506
TIME.

234
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,774
SECOND, VERY IMPORTANTLY, THE 

235
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:26,211
NECESSITY OF PROVIDING 

236
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:30,182
COUNSELING TO EVERYBODY 

237
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:30,449
INVOLVED.

238
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,886
CERTAINLY COUNSELING FOR THE 

239
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,289
LIVING VICTIMS AND FAMILIES, AND

240
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,758
ALL OF THE STUDENTS IN THE 

241
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,093
ENTIRE DISTRICT.

242
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,328
I KNOW RESOURCES ARE BEING 

243
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:46,231
PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY FOR THAT,

244
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:46,698
AND ALSO BY THE STATE.

245
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,634
AND WE WILL HAVE WHATEVER AMOUNT

246
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,504
OF COUNSELORS THAT THE SCHOOL 

247
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:53,271
DISTRICT NEEDS.

248
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:55,507
I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

249
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:59,244
VISIT WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT 

250
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,780
WHO HAS BEEN HELPFUL WITH THE 

251
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,017
RESPONSE AND THE INVESTIGATION, 

252
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:13,292
AND I THANK HER FOR THE SUPPORT.

253
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,961
AND WE'VE RECEIVED PHONE CALLS 

254
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,163
FROM THE PRESIDENT AND VICE 

255
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:22,301
PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF 

256
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,870
HOMELAND SECURITY, AND THEY ALL 

257
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,905
HAVE PLEDGED SUPPORT.

258
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,240
AND TED CRUZ AT THIS TIME WILL 

259
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,941
TAKE THE MIKE. 

260
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,410
>> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR.

261
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,845
THANK YOU FOR YOUR STRONG 

262
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,279
LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE, 

263
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,981
PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS.

264
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,716
ONCE AGAIN, TEXAS HAS SEEN THE 

265
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,352
FACE OF EVIL.

266
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,420
>> SENATOR TED CRUZ, SPEAKING 

267
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,722
THERE AFTER WE HEARD THAT 

268
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,389
LENGTHY STATEMENT FROM THE 

269
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:47,126
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, GREG ABBOTT.

270
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,694
A LOT OF INFORMATION THERE FROM 

271
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,262
THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS.

272
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:55,067
HE REFERRED TO THE SHOOTING IN 

273
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:59,571
SANTA FE, TEXAS, AS HEINOUS AND 

274
00:13:59,571 --> 00:13:59,771
EVIL.

275
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,840
TEN PEOPLE KILLED, TEN PEOPLE 

276
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,574
WOUNDED.

277
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,876
RIGHT NOW, HE INDICATED POLICE 

278
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,578
ARE SEARCHING THE HOME OF THE 

279
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:06,845
SUSPECT.

280
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,216
HE SAYS THEY'RE MOVING SLOWLY, 

281
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:14,220
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED THERE 

282
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,559
MAY BE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ON THE 

283
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:20,759
SCENE.

284
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,094
SEARCHING MANY SCENES THROUGHOUT

285
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,997
THE AREA, CONCERNED ABOUT 

286
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,167
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

287
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,068
HE SAID THEY'VE FOUND SEVERAL 

288
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,338
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

289
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,775
AND THE SUSPECT HAD INFORMATION 

290
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,844
ON JOURNALS AND CELL PHONES 

291
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,979
SAYING HE PLANNED TO CARRY OUT 

292
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:47,952
THE ATTACK, AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO 

293
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:48,286
KILL HIMSELF.

294
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:51,489
BUT ULTIMATELY, HE TURNED 

295
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:51,991
HIMSELF IN.

296
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,126
RIGHT NOW, THE GOVERNOR SAYS THE

297
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:58,230
POLICE ARE INTERVIEWING TWO 

298
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,998
PEOPLE OF INTEREST, ONE PERSON 

299
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:03,068
WHO BEHAVED SUSPICIOUSLY AT THE 

300
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,636
SCENE, AND ANOTHER WHO MAY HAVE 

301
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:04,937
INFORMATION.

302
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,973
AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T KNOW 

303
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,642
WHETHER THIS WAS A LONE GUNMAN, 

304
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:13,845
OR WHETHER HE HAD ASSISTANCE.

305
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:15,947
ONE FINAL SET OF DETAILS FROM 

306
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:18,217
THE GOVERNOR ABOUT TODAY'S MASS 

307
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,785
SHOOTING, IT WAS CARRIED OUT 

308
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:24,423
USING A SHOTGUN AND A .38 

309
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,725
REVOLVER, BOTH TAKEN FROM THE 

310
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,028
SUSPECT'S FATHER, WHO OWNED THEM

311
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,261
LEGALLY.

312
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:37,769
WITH US HERE ON THE SET, CHIEF 

313
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:38,036
BOB BOYCE.

314
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,505
AS YOU LISTEN TO THE GOVERNOR, 

315
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:42,007
WHAT STUCK OUT TO YOU?

316
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,977
>> THE FACT THAT HE ACQUIRED THE

317
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,144
GUNS FROM HIS FATHER, THEY WERE 

318
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:47,846
IN THE HOME.

319
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,116
THE SHOTGUN AND .38, NOTHING TOO

320
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,885
SUBSTANTIAL ABOUT THE GUNS, BUT 

321
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:57,156
HE HAD ACCESS TO THEM.

322
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,124
AND THE SUICIDE INTENTION ON THE

323
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,526
PERPETRATOR, THAT MEANS THEY GOT

324
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,028
INFORMATION FROM HIM, THEY SPOKE

325
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,431
WITH HIM.

326
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,098
HE'S SPOKING WITH THEM.

327
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:11,470
AND THE ACTIVE SHOOTER PROTOCOL,

328
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,239
HOW QUICKLY WAS THE OFFICER 

329
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:14,673
THERE?

330
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,141
>> THE SCHOOL OFFICER?

331
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,409
>> YES.

332
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,778
AND WAS THERE ANY AMMUNITION ON 

333
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,613
HIM, THAT HE COULD HAVE SHOT ANY

334
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,580
OTHER PEOPLE?

335
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,083
>> AND COULD LIVES HAVE BEEN 

336
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,520
SAVED IF THE RESPONSE WAS 

337
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:28,787
SPEEDIER. 

338
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,189
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

339
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,724
BUT WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW. 

340
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:36,461
>> WHAT DOES THE PROLIFERATION 

341
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,697
OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES SAY TO YOU?

342
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:43,302
>> WELL, THE MOLOTOV COCKTAIL, 

343
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,238
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED BUT VERY 

344
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,339
EFFECTIVE.

345
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,042
AND THE CO2, IT WAS PLANNED.

346
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:52,978
SO, WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THEY 

347
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:53,979
KNEW AT THE TIME.

348
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:58,050
>> AND I WANT TO BRING IN FORMER

349
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,154
DALLAS POLICE CHIEF, DAVID 

350
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:09,494
BROWN, WHO HIS NOT ONLY FROM 

351
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:13,198
TEXAS, BUT DEALT WITH A SHOOTING

352
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,967
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

353
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,134
LISTENING TO YOUR GOVERNOR 

354
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:19,838
SPEAKING ABOUT THE SHOOTING, 

355
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,406
WHAT DETAILS STUCK OUT TO YOU?

356
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:24,910
>> THE TYPE OF WEAPONS STUCK OUT

357
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,111
TO ME.

358
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,281
SHOTGUN, AND HANDGUN, REVOLVER 

359
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,582
HANDGUN, REALLY SPOKE ABOUT THE 

360
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,551
KIND OF, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU 

361
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,218
NORMALLY SEE.

362
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,120
NO AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

363
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,723
AND WITH TEN VICTIMS, THERE HAD 

364
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,792
TO BE A SLOWER RESPONSE.

365
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,495
AND THERE HAD TO BE SOME 

366
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,764
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALLOWED HIM 

367
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,333
TO NOT ONLY FATALLY KILL TEN, 

368
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,670
BUT ALSO WOUND TEN ADDITIONAL 

369
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,172
PEOPLE.

370
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,506
THERE LIKELY HAD TO BE SOME 

371
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,810
RELOADING, AND TEACHERS, STAFF, 

372
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,712
AND THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER 

373
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:05,383
WHO WAS WOUNDED, THAT TIMELINE 

374
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,885
WILL BE IMPORTANT AS WE LISTEN 

375
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,454
TO THE INVESTIGATIVE OUTCOMES OF

376
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,957
WHAT HAPPENED AND THE SEQUENCE 

377
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:12,524
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

378
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,760
HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO USE A 

379
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,428
SHOTGUN, WHICH IS NOT AN 

380
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:20,899
AUTOMATIC WEAPON, AND CAUSE SO 

381
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,234
MUCH GRIEF FOR ALL OF US TO 

382
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,036
LISTEN TO THIS, AND AT THE SAME 

383
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,471
TIME, THE SECOND PERSON OF 

384
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:29,608
INTEREST, OR MAYBE EVEN ANOTHER 

385
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,276
PERSON THAT THEY'RE 

386
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,145
INTERVIEWING, ALL OF THAT WILL 

387
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,514
REVEAL MORE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT, 

388
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,050
AGAIN, THAT WE MAY FIND 

389
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,317
SHOCKING.

390
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,618
>> MOST SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN THIS

391
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:43,088
COUNTRY ARE CARRIED OUT BY LONE 

392
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,224
GUNMEN.

393
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,727
SO IT WILL BE UNUSUAL IF THIS 

394
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,063
SUSPECT HAD ASSISTANCE.

395
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:54,933
BUT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF FOCUS

396
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,369
ON THE POLICE RESPONSE TO THE 

397
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:57,636
SHOOTING.

398
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,172
THANK YOU BOTH.

399
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,809
AND MARCUS MOORE, ON THE GROUND 

400
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,711
AT SANTA FE, GIVE US A SENSE OF 

401
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:08,680
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND HEARING 

402
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,715
RIGHT THERE. 

403
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,716
>> Reporter: WELL, DAN, IT'S A 

404
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:13,652
DIFFICULT SCENE HERE JUST 

405
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,389
OUTSIDE THE PLACE THAT MANY HERE

406
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,890
IN SANTA FE CALL THE GYM.

407
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,827
IT'S A FORMER SCHOOL CONVERTED 

408
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,130
TO A GYM.

409
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,765
THIS IS WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE

410
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,735
BEING REUNITED WITH STUDENTS.

411
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,671
WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE 

412
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,305
PLACE, A NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND 

413
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,205
FAMILIES ARE WALKING BACK AND 

414
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:35,640
FORTH, AND PEOPLE LOOKING FOR 

415
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,475
THEIR RELATIVES WHO THEY SAY 

416
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:38,977
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRACK

417
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:39,278
DOWN.

418
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,947
I TALKED TO ONE FAMILY WHO SAID 

419
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:45,450
THEY HAD A LOVED ONE WHO WORKED 

420
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,385
AT THE SCHOOL, AND HAVEN'T BEEN 

421
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:50,956
ABLE TO REACH THEM.

422
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,458
A VERY SOMBER MOOD HERE, WHERE 

423
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,594
SO MANY ARE COMING TO GET 

424
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:55,961
INFORMATION.

425
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,796
AND A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE 

426
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,132
MEDIA HAVE BEEN SHOWING UP HERE.

427
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:04,870
AND THE PARKING LOT AT THE LOCAL

428
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,306
GROCERY STORE IS WHERE THEY'RE 

429
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,241
PARKING, AND WALKING ACROSS TO 

430
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,043
HOPEFULLY FIND INFORMATION ABOUT

431
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,811
THEIR LOVED ONES.

432
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:19,918
SANTA FE IS A CITY OF ABOUT 

433
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,953
13,000 PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF 

434
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:22,287
HOUSTON.

435
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,590
AND THE SCHOOL ONLY HAS AN 

436
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,427
ENROLLMENT OF 1,400 STUDENTS.

437
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:33,331
BY TEXAS STANDARDS, IT'S A 

438
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:35,367
RELATIVITY SMALL HIGH SCHOOL.

439
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,702
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS

440
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,003
HERE, IT HITS THE COMMUNITY 

441
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:39,771
EXTREMELY HARD.

442
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,440
WE'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO A NUMBER

443
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,342
OF STUDENTS WHO, ONE GENTLEMAN 

444
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:47,846
TOLD ME HE WASN'T EVEN AT SCHOOL

445
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,549
TODAY, AND AT 7:30 A.M., HE GOT 

446
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,920
A MESSAGE FROM A FRIEND 

447
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,622
DESCRIBING WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

448
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,224
SOMEONE PULLED THE FIRE ALARM, 

449
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:04,496
AND THEY STARTED TO EVACUATE THE

450
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,797
SCHOOL.

451
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,600
AND TALKING ABOUT THE COMING 

452
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,403
STEPS GOING INTO NEXT WEEK, ONE 

453
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,372
STUDENT SAID NO KID SHOULD EVER 

454
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,639
BE AFRAID TO COME TO SCHOOL.

455
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:19,344
AND WE ENDED THE INTERVIEW THAT 

456
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:19,510
WAY.

457
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,677
DAN?

458
00:21:19,677 --> 00:21:23,582
>> MARCUS MOORE, FROM SANTA FE, 

459
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:23,782
TEXAS.

460
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,584
AND THE PLACES WHERE THE 

461
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:29,388
FAMILIES REUNITE AFTER A 

462
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,891
SHOOTING, CAN BE SO FRAUGHT, 

463
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:37,028
TENDER, INCREDIBLY SAD.

464
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,596
WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS PLAY OUT 

465
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:39,731
BEFORE IN THIS COUNTRY.

466
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,900
THERE'S SORT OF A GRIM 

467
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,369
CHOREOGRAPHY, WE SEE AFTER ONE 

468
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:44,769
OF THESE EVENTS.

469
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:48,573
THE BREAKING NEWS, THE SORT OF 

470
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,409
IMAGES YOU'RE SEEING, WITH A 

471
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:52,344
MASSIVE POLICE RESPONSE.

472
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,247
AND THE DEBATE ABOUT WHAT TO DO.

473
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,849
AND WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT 

474
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,950
DEBATE BEING JOINED BY THE 

475
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,752
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, GREG ABBOTT.

476
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:04,255
HE SAID WE NEED TO DO MORE IN 

477
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,057
THE STATE OF TEXAS THAN JUST 

478
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:06,324
PRAY.

479
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,860
WE NEED TO STEP UP AND MAKE SURE

480
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,695
THE TRAGEDY IS NEVER REPEATED.

481
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:14,166
HE'S CALLING FOR A SERIES OF 

482
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,101
ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS, WITH 

483
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,336
TEACHERS, PARENTS, AND 

484
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,070
EDUCATORS.

485
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,774
AND HE SAID HE WANTS TO MOVE 

486
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:23,909
TOWARDS SWIFT SOLUTIONS.

487
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,912
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLICY 

488
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:29,514
IMPLICATIONS WITH CECILIA VEGA, 

489
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,748
STANDING BY AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

490
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:32,818
RIGHT NOW.

491
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,486
AFTER THE SHOOTING IN PARKLAND, 

492
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,021
FLORIDA, AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS

493
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,491
THE FIFTH FATAL SCHOOL SHOOTING 

494
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,491
IN AMERICA SINCE PARKLAND.

495
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:42,594
AFTER THAT SHOOTING, WE SAW THIS

496
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,363
BIG PUSH LED BY THE STUDENTS AND

497
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,466
CULMINATING IN THE MARCH FOR OUR

498
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,868
LIVES IN WASHINGTON, WITH BIG 

499
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,102
CALLS FOR CHANGE.

500
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:53,238
AND WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM THE

501
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,139
PRESIDENT TODAY.

502
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,107
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE WE MAY BE ON

503
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:58,676
THE CUSP OF ANOTHER DEBATE LIKE 

504
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:01,613
THIS, AND PERHAPS HEADED TOWARDS

505
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,181
SOME SORT OF ACTION?

506
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,683
>> Reporter: YOU'RE RIGHT.

507
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,951
THIS IS A SADLY FAMILIAR DRILL 

508
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:09,888
IN OUR COUNTRY, FOR THIS WHITE 

509
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,088
HOUSE.

510
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,123
AND WITH THAT COMES THE FAMILIAR

511
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:12,491
RESPONSE.

512
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,358
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SUPPOSED TO 

513
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,460
BE TALKING ABOUT PRISON REFORM 

514
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,828
AT AN EVENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, 

515
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,197
AND HAD TO BEGIN THE REMARKS FOR

516
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,865
THE FIFTH TIME, ADDRESSING THE 

517
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:23,468

518
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,436
SHOOTING, TALKING ABOUT THIS 

519
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:29,341
MASS SHOOTING IN TEXAS.

520
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,942
HE SAID THIS HAD BEEN GOING ON 

521
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,577
FOR TOO LONG IN OUR COUNTRY.

522
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,613
YOU MENTIONED THOSE PARKLAND 

523
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:34,980
STUDENTS.

524
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,914
THEY WERE HERE AT THIS WHITE 

525
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,416
HOUSE, ONE OF THE MOST VISCERAL 

526
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,918
IMAGES THAT WE'VE SEEN OUT OF 

527
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,818
THIS ADMINISTRATION.

528
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:42,654
THE PRESIDENT GRIEVING WITH 

529
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,155
THOSE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS

530
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:46,957
IN THE WAKE OF THAT SHOOTING.

531
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,794
AND PROMISING BIG CHANGES WITH 

532
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:52,330
GUN CONTROL, BACKGROUND CHECKS, 

533
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,467
RAISING THE AGE LIMITS FOR 

534
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,301
PURCHASING A FIREARM.

535
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:58,937
THEN MANY WOULD SAY HE BUCKLED 

536
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,373
TO PRESSURE FROM THE NRA, AND 

537
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,843
BACKED DOWN FROM MANY OF THOSE 

538
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:05,110
PROMISES.

539
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,515
WE'RE HEARING TODAY FROM CHORUS 

540
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:15,587
OF STUDENTS, WITH CALLS FROM 

541
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,088
ACTION, SAYING WE DON'T NEED 

542
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,492
YOUR PRAYERS, WE NEED SECTION.

543
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:24,362
AND EMMA GONZALEZ OF PARKLAND 

544
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,665
SAID, SANTA FE HIGH, YOU DON'T 

545
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,832
DESERVE THIS.

546
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:30,435
YOU DESERVE MORE THAN THOUGHTS 

547
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,772
AND PRAYERS.

548
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,840
AND WE'LL SUPPORT YOU BY RAISING

549
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,878
UP YOUR VOICES.

550
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,613
THIS HAS BEEN THE RESOUNDING 

551
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,980
CALL FOR ACTION.

552
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,950
BUT HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT

553
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,584
AGAIN, AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN VERY 

554
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:47,084
MUCH ACTION. 

555
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:49,654
>> CECILIA VEGA, THANK YOU.

556
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,922
LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THIS.

557
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,158
THE INCIDENTS ARE TOO COMMON IN 

558
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:58,597
