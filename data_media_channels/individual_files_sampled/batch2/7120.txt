a GOP lawmaker is reviving legislation that would essentially legalize silencers in the United States now silencers are currently legal but an individual who wants to obtain them has to go through quite a bit of obstacles in order to do so and part of the reason why is because silencers silenced guns and they're oftentimes used by criminals so making them widely available is probably not the best idea now representative Jeff Duncan had originally presented this bill but after the shooting involving representative Scalise they decided to kind of retire it for a little while and now they're bringing it back now Duncan introduced the silencer provision in a broader bill known as the sportsmen heritage and recreational enhancement act or share act because assassins are sportsmen so you know okay so what is his argument in favor of the silencers because here's the reality law enforcement against legalizing or making these silencers easier to obtain right blue lives matter okay so who loves matter cops don't like it it's used by really bad guys out there criminals so what's his reasoning he's like well you know the thing is these hunters go out there they're hunting it's loud and I really want to make sure I protect their hearing I kid you not that is the excuse that he's giving which is unbelievable and by the way this isn't just a Republican thing there are four Democrats who have co-sponsored this legislation I'll give you their names in just a second but you know I'm also concerned about your protection for hunters which is why I would recommend this oh yeah yeah that looks good or this some good beets or something or here's another one let's take a look all right here's a hunter modeling one of these devices oh yeah it looks like his ears are safe okay we're ear mussing the hunters okay look here's the thing this is nonsense and that excuse just further reinforces my feelings of how nonsensical this is and in terms of the Democrats who have supported this you have representative gene green from Texas representative Henry Cuellar from Texas representative Colin Peterson Representative Peter DeFazio really DeFazio is very progressive that's disappointing to say that yeah so okay the part of the story that amazes me actually is as I pointed out it's not where America it's not like you can't buy a silencer if you want to assassinate someone you can we believe in weapons and all sorts of weapons it just takes you a little longer so what the government says is hey you know what you got to submit for fingerprints and take a photograph in order to purchase a silence and it might take all the way up to nine months now the people who don't want to be fingerprinted and have their picture taken when they're buying a sensor other people who are usually going to murder someone now if you're gonna go shoot deer and you're really really concerned about your hearing and the beach thing is not working and etc okay then okay golly gee you know when I think it a little bit ahead here and if yet what conservers always tell me about warrantless wiretapping and other things is if you haven't done anything wrong you got nothing to worry about right why are you planning to kill someone okay then why do you guys need silencers it's there has to be a better reason like if your protection is the only reason you have and there are already devices that people can just easily buy you need to come up with a better reason bro weapons are generally like you know they're quiet firearms are really loud to wear the headphones just don't work so all of our good Americans who carry firearms for protection and hunting purposes I mean that they're so loud in their ears it just doesn't it doesn't happen they need they need silencers for their things because they're cooler Americans it's a toy thing as all this you know how much cooler is if you have a gun with a silencer on it and you show off to your friends hey chicks up yeah I'm cool sure thing they want to make money manufacturing things stop with this what you're doing with the whole weapons or just fire I'm sorry for the defamatory language or the gun okay okay no but Jer is exactly right they saw it in the movies they want to buy another cool toy and I hear your brother when I hear the movie you know what I might even have it here okay it sounds cool and I think so okay I'm gonna give a real struggle fart alright fair enough that's your interpretation and you want to buy those toys in the matter values Lauren all those those but sometimes those toys are used by really dangerous men and sometimes they kill cops so I think it's okay if we have your fingerprints if you're shooting deer you won't not gonna have any issues with it at all but if your gun is used to murder someone at least we know who the assassin is not too much to ask for but for these guys what do you mean man it impinges on my freedom I'm a sportsman and I'd also snowflake with really bad hearing can we also just finally accept the fact that Republican lawmakers and the NRA only pretend to support cops because in reality they're in favor of armor-piercing bullets which cops are obviously against they're in favor of these silencers which cops are obviously against they don't care about blue lives matter either they care about profits because in America profits always always are considered more important than human lives regardless of who you are or what you do for a living that's such a great point and I'll end on this so when black lives matter does a protest that apparently in dangerous cops with their voices but when people buy armor-piercing bullets and and silencers that cops are worried might murder them that apparently is not a real issue so bullets that can kill cops not an issue people saying hey please stop killing us in a protest which is protected by the First Amendment that's the real issue so those are the guys that Fox News's Center calls terrorists the guys who buy the silencers and the armor-piercing bullets I don't know if you know this but a lot of people who man guys wearing armor it's usually the cops okay but those guys who are intending to buy things that normally kill cops of good Americans good patriotic Americans insane priorities help us build independent media become a member of the Turks TYT Network comm /join
