my grandfather and father were born in
North London in Tottenham and so it was
in my blood to follow on from there
I've been a football fan for as long as
I can remember really I think it was the
1998 World Cup the river first got me
into football
I'm liking the fact that I've been to
Russia over the last four years quite
frequently but some of the fans have
never been there before
CAC for hot there but absolutely miles
away I mean Anglian headed that was

Vin's yet a man named Bosh Wellfleet
ride
I don't really understand where the
safety concerns have come from there's
been a lot of bad press I can't take
everything too seriously I'm gonna go I

I could see when I went to the
Confederations Cup competition last year
as a retired police officer the not only
over the police but the army was in
cooperation with each other to enhance
the security measure
from be jealous of Brian because he's
going and you know what if you've got
big enough Trump I can sleep in the
truck
