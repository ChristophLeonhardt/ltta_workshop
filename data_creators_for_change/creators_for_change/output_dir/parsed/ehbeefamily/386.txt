some good friends of ours are going away
for a few days and they asked us to
watch their cat we don't know anything
about cats we don't have any pets we
kind of don't really know what to expect
we've never had pets I mean you've had a
goldfish I had a fish when I was a kid
but I didn't do anything it lived a long
time though your goldfish
I had a pet tarantula and we called it
mr. teeth and it didn't last very long
because my sister left the window open
and it died yeah it's no good yeah and
we get a lot of comments saying you guys
need okay but guess what we have we have
monkeys we had no experience so when
people tell us get a patent get a pet
get a pet we actually went and cats it
cats out sound okay uh there were some
there are some ups and downs of being a
cat owner most ups mostly ups but as
soon as we walked in it's like a punch
in the face like face-melting
hitting me Mel
it's like if my medium-sized the
dinosaur went in a litter box
no five litter boxes in a house and then
just left but nonetheless
we found a cat and the monkeys got to
know the cat gave very friendly mr.
monkey did you eat like banged on a on a
cup pin when he was banging on the tin
the cat need to come over and we've
never had a pet before so this is the
first time they gave us instructions
feed the cats here's the food so as soon
as you did that had to come over
everything was fine naturally what do
you do when you go over to see a cat you
have a evil villain challenge
later I couldn't help but notice the
smell was still lingering yes we had an
investigate
clearly the problem was lousy litter I
can't even explain the smell and mr.
monkey said we must tidy up the steak so
I naturally what on my phone is started
searching around for a solution and I
found it and it looked at the cat seemed
to enjoy it yeah he got in there right
away you got her right away boom boom
boom boom and we all kind of cheered
around the cat when that was happening I
think that was a little awkward for the
cat do you like burying it or something
I've never been so impressed with kitty
litter if I was in the bathroom I don't
know how I'd feel about for human beings
clapping while I was in the bathroom cat
was in the house pretty easy
cats are pretty easy they're pretty
chill they're self-sufficient they the
kind of mind their own business
