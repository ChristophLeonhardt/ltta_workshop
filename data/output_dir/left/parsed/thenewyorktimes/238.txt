“Mr. Zuckerberg, would
you be comfortable
sharing with us the name of the
hotel you stayed in last night?”
“Um —
no.”
“If you’ve messaged
anybody this week,
would you share with us
the names of the people
you’ve messaged?”
“Senator, no,
I would probably not choose
to do that publicly here.”
“I think that may be
what this is all about.”
“In 2015, we heard the report
that this developer
Aleksandr Kogan had sold data to
Cambridge Analytica.”
“Did you or senior
leadership do an inquiry
to find out who at Facebook
had this information
and did they not have
a discussion about
whether or not the users
should be informed
back in December of 2015?”
“Senator, in retrospect,
I think we clearly
view it as a mistake
that we didn’t inform people.
And we did that based
on false information
that we thought that
the case was closed,
and that the data
had been deleted.”
“So there was a decision
made on that basis
not to inform the
users. Is that correct?”
“That’s my understanding, yes.”
“I assume Facebook’s
been served with subpoenas
from the special
counsel Mueller’s office.
Is that correct?”
“Yes.
Actually, let
me clarify that.
I actually am not
aware of a subpoena.
I believe that there may be.
But I know we’re
working with them.”
“Thank you.”
“If I buy a Ford and it
doesn’t work well
and I don’t like it,
I can buy a Chevy.
If I’m upset
with Facebook,
what’s the equivalent product
that I can go sign up for?”
“The average American
uses eight different apps —”
“O.K.”
“— to communicate
with their friends
and stay in touch with people —”
“O.K.”
“— ranging from text apps —”
“— which is —”
— to email.”
“Which is the same
service you provide.”
“Well, we provide
a number of different services.”
“Is Twitter the
same as what you do?”
“It overlaps with a portion of what we do.”
“You don’t think you have
a monopoly?”
“It certainly doesn’t
feel like that to me.”
“O.K.”
“Do you need to look
behind shell corporations
in order to find
out who is really
behind the content
that’s being posted?
And if you may need to look
behind a shell corporation,
how will you go
about doing that?
How will you get
back to the true,
what lawyers would
call ‘beneficial owner’
of the site that is putting
out the political material?”
“So what we’re going to do is require
a valid government identity
and we’re going to
verify the location.
So we’re going to do that,
so that way someone sitting
in Russia, for example,
couldn’t say that
they’re in America
and therefore able
to run an election ad.”
“But if they were running
through a corporation domiciled
in Delaware, you wouldn’t
know that they were actually
a Russian owner.”
“Senator, that’s— that’s correct.”
