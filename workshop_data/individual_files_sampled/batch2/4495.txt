senator patty Murray senator thank you for joining us we've been talking about this the the desire certainly we're hearing a number of Democratic activists part two for the party to fight this thing your colleague though there in the Senate Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut he said a few minutes ago the Senate should do nothing to artificially delay the vote on the next SCOTUS nominee do you agree with that approach well Steve here's what I know the next Supreme Court nominee is going to decide and be a major decision maker on things I care deeply about whether it's access to health care a woman's right to choose our clean air right to privacy the list goes on and this is a monumental decision change for our country that we all have to get into this battle on we have to make sure that this nominee gets all the scrutiny they can we have to look at every option that we have and at the end of the day Mitch McConnell needs to remember that he made the decision not to have this kind of consequential decision made till after an election and I believe in the golden rule and I think everyone should be calling Mitch McConnell and telling him to do unto others as he has done to himself and that we need to make this decision after this election okay that gets to what you're describing there gets to I the question I'm trying to figure out here from a Democrats perspective if you have an instinct to fight this to scrutinize this maybe to stop this the tools that you have at your disposal to do that are those tools political court of public opinion ratchet up pressure make people aware of the stakes or are those tools legislative is there something are there a series of steps that you could take as a legislator to stop it from that standpoint it will be difficult we will look at everything we have but what I do know can make a difference is all of your listeners calling their senator and saying this decision is important I care about a woman's right to choose I care about the quality of air that I breathe I care about the right to privacy I can about how people are treated in this country no matter who they look like or where they're from I care about our country immensely I want you to hold off on this decision till after the people have spoken in November and if that doesn't work we have to make sure that whoever this nominee is has the intense scrutiny and every single senator is held accountable for their vote what's the endgame here though because Donald Trump no matter what happens in November stays as president it's possible we just showed the map up there it's possible Republicans even emerge from November with 53 54 votes ultimately are you going to have to settle for Donald Trump putting somebody on this Court there's no doubt that this president is going to put forward a nominee that is going to make decisions that change the course of our country so every one of us every one of your listeners need to weigh in about what's important to them as we evaluate who he sends over we have a yes or no vote here at the end of the day after everything else is done and we need every senator to know that people are watching what matters to them what the issues are and how they will be evaluated on that vote one tool that you and your party do not have at your disposal now is the filibuster it is forcing Republicans to come up with 60 votes for this nomination that was killed off last year because Democrats chose to filibuster the Gorsuch nomination Republicans chose to invoke that nuclear option and go back five years earlier in 2013 Democrats when they were in the Senate they did a bit of the the nuclear option on other judicial nominations and Mitch McConnell said back then in 2013 when Democrats partially did away with the filibuster he said you will regret this someday do you now look at this situation not having the filibuster having the president in this position and say you do regret tinkering with the filibuster five years ago well what I can say is that we told Mitch McConnell that the decision to not have a filibuster should never impact the Supreme Court because they are at the end of the day lifetime employments decisions where you have nowhere else to go so these people are absolutely critical on vital issues and they should take sixty votes and now the Republicans are moving forward on a nominee that is going to show this country why that's so important so that's why this is so important that we all have an opportunity to weigh in with our senators who wherever you are or whoever your senator is to say I'm watching I'm counting on you to protect my right to make my own health care choice if I'm that woman I'm counting on you to put a nominee in that will protect my ability to buy insurance if I have a pre-existing condition I'm counting on you to make sure that my children if they have asthma have clean air to breathe I mean the list is long and everyone needs to not just talk about the process that is critical but was what is important are the issues that will change if a president's nominee is going to go through that changes the course of our history today all right senator patty
