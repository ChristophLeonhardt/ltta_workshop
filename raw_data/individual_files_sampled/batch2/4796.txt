Israel welcome back to Morning Joe Mike Barnicle John Heilemann and Elise Jordan are back on set and joining us now from Capitol Hill we have member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska good to have you on the show this morning good morning and what's the I didn't did I forget my Cavanaugh tattoo so fast senator mica has been saying nice things about you on Twitter I can't be true if you did if you looked at snapshots overnight your your ratings are plummeting in Nebraska she said nice things this morning and a couple newspapers are suggesting that you resign now but you will not survive any Republican primary with the support of people like me and make us stop trying to help how many people say that to me personal you dog that would you would you want to get him your daughter's numbers and so can I just ask you something because you know Donald Trump has been attacking Alabama and he's been saying that word um say in our schools second class but you know senator I don't ever remember the Crimson Tide canceled the game because of the shower Wow so you went there didn't you you did that yeah I'm a fraud Nebraska canceling football games because of a rain shower there's a lot there's a lot that's wrong right now but I get I'm claiming dibs on the next segment because we can talk Cavanaugh later but first we're gonna trash talk football yeah we're the winningest team in the last 50 years no my wife my wife regularly reminds me that Alabama might be the winningest team in the last ten yeah I just want to say - I've been happily sleeping next to a University of Alabama alum who talks like she has marbles in her mouth Homer on see you do you call her a total idiot like Trump called sessions or usually she's calling me the total idiot so do you guys she ever does she ever go down to you guys ever go down to Tuscaloosa you know we've only been to one game since we've been married cuz usually there's a Nebraska game on most of those same weeks she's going down this fall and you guys are taking a bye week so she is she's been wait women submit to your husband's is this what this is about no she's been converted she's been converted to the truth logical football is just alive all right so we'll we'll go ahead and talk about Cavanaugh I I'll ask you the same question that we asked the senator from Hawaii which is can we ever look forward to a time after Merrick garland and after you know the Republicans killed the filibuster for the Supreme Court after Harry Reid killed the filibuster for federal judges in general can we ever look forward to a time when a president can appoint somebody who's qualified to sit on the Supreme Court and we can get 80 or 90 votes not because it feels good but because that's the way it's supposed to be advice and concern yeah and then so what we need is we need to distinguish between basic civics and jurisprudence about what the purpose of the Supreme Court is fits there and policy fighting we should fight about policy a $15 minimum wage a lot of people are in favor of it I think it would have negative unintended consequences reasonable people should argue about that they should fight about that we shouldn't be having protests about the Supreme Court and frankly we shouldn't be having so much protest in front of the Supreme Court which we've had now for 30 years because it's become a substitute political body because the Congress doesn't do its politics right and so we transfer so much power to the executive branch into the judiciary because the Congress is impotent senators Assets willie geist I want to ask you about your willingness to criticize the president at times when you feel it's appropriate a couple of days ago when the president went on Twitter and question the Department of Justice over a couple of indictments of Republican congressman you came out and said this is not a banana republic this is not how justice is carried out the Justice Department effectively not there to protect the president of United States we haven't seen a lot of that frankly over the last couple of years aside from senators who may be leaving town in a couple of months and that is direct criticism of the President of the United States and we've heard publicly and privately from Republicans who say it's just not good politics at this point to cross president Trump because he's popular in my district or he's popular in my state what's your view of that yeah I did I didn't run for office for short term popularity I ran for office because I'm worried about the long-term health of our country and a lot of times people say and Twitter is swallowing so much of our news right now people say oh well this or that is just talk well actually why you want talk and why you want debate is because those norms are what keep us from violence and so the things that the president said on Sunday attacking the Justice Department and asking for politicized justice that's really really dangerous stuff because in our country we believe that justice is blind I came here because I want to drain the swamp I don't care whether the congressman who's doing insider trading or embezzling campaign funds or is indicted for this or that I don't care whether they wear a blue or a red jersey I want fewer of those people around and it seems to me if you want swamp draining you don't want two tears of justice for the majority party and the minority party I want people who work at the Department of Justice to believe in the rule of law so senator why do you think it's been so difficult for your Republican colleagues both in the Senate and the house to do what you do almost every time you see a norm being violated or a line being crossed and that is to criticize the president I'm not really sure why a lot of people around here make a lot of their decisions but I think most people in both parties right now their main long-term interest in Washington is their own incumbency and that's not really what I'm not interested in I'm worried about the future of cyber I'm worried about the future of work I'm worried about the collapse of social capital as the digital revolution undermines local community most of the stuff I care about isn't right versus left it's past versus future I'm the second or third most conservative person in the Senate by voting record and I don't hide any of that but most of what I care about isn't stuff that we're actually debating in the Congress so I'm not really that interested in incumbency I'm worried about the country my kids are gonna grow up in 10 or 15 years from now and so when something's true and it's big and it's important and frankly what the president did on Sunday was big and true and dangerous I'm gonna speak about that because that's actually why I ran for office not chiefly because of Republican versus Democrats so senator let's talk about Republican versus Democratic stuff obviously sort of the ghost of Merrick Garland's nomination is hanging over Bret Cavanaugh's hearing fairly or unfairly depending on what what what tribe members riding here first of all and you think that's fair secondly did Republicans make a mistake not giving Merrick garland a chance to talk in their offices and to talk in front of the Judiciary Committee and at least getting up or down vote so I think here we get to a place where it becomes Hatfields and McCoys really quickly right so I want to acknowledge that this works better if we have an hour and a bunch of beer but you can always go back to the prior send to the prior send to the prior Sen but where we really are right now is there has been a tradition going back to World War two that people are not confirmed to the Supreme Court in a presidential election year that's just been the tradition and that really comes most fundamentally even though it's a tradition going back to 1945 it comes most directly from the mid to late 1980s when every Supreme Court nomination sense has been politicized going back to the Bork hearings in 1987 we have a situation where you can predict the craziness that was going to happen here yesterday the lunacy of the way we do protests at these hearings is because people think these are made-for-tv events to scream in a tribal way I think we should be doing a lot more of what Cavanaugh said yesterday which is noting as his opening statement did it's gonna be swallowed by other news I get that but he noted something really important which is that the Supreme Court has no aisle there's not a right on the left side of the court there aren't caucus rooms where you meet as the red team justices and the blue team justices Cavanaugh talked about a team of nine and I think we need to get back to a place where our kids and basic American civics understands why you put on a robe and when you're a judge and that's because it's a modest role it's not to be pro-environment or pro coal it's not to be Pro Republican and Pro Democrat it's to be Pro rule of law and you put on a black judge to cloak all of those prior policy preferences because it's a unique role to be a judge and we need a team of nine where we don't see them as a republican or democratic justices a senator listening to you and and you know you clearly you've just expressed that you're worried about the long-term future of the country you're worried about the short-term future of the country change is sweeping this country right now it's it's obvious in the headlines that we read each and every day yesterday in Massachusetts and the Democratic primary Mike Capuano 20 a veteran of the house last week a young city councilor from Boston Dianna Presley hurt one of her themes was change can't wait and as voters look at you and every other candidate on the ballot I'm wondering about the issue of term limits do you believe in term limits heck yeah it's the first piece of legislation I introduced the first day I was here January 3rd or 4th 2015 I went and introduced a constitutional amendment for term limits promptly got called to the principal's office about two hours later because it was viewed as criticism of all the incumbents but if I could pull a lever that fired all 535 people including myself I'd do it in a heartbeat we need change but the real question has changed toward what because all that's really happening right now in American politics and this has been a decade and a half in the coming obviously the president injects a new kind of chaos directly into the veins of America but this isn't really 2016 to the present stuff we've been heading here for a couple of decades all that really happens every election is you try to figure out how you can mobilize more intensity to be against and so we just go Yang and yang screaming against whoever the party is that's in power because nobody around here and either these parties really has a long-term vision for the country we're entering and the reality is our kids I'm a former college president so I think a lot about the world from the perspective of 18 year old or 22 year old kids heading out into the world they're gonna change jobs three times in the next decade there isn't going to be lifelong employment anymore McKinsey has a whole bunch of interesting studies about what digital disruption is going to do in terms of creating a Lance economy where everybody's mostly doing side hustles we need to rethink the social compact for age 35 and 40 and 45 and 50 if your industries are gonna cease to exist all of that stuff is big and we need change but we actually need a whole bunch of long-term policy thinking and neither of these parties are talking about any of that they're talking about how they can scream that the other people are bigger Devils than we are it's not good enough so senator we have somebody else from the deep south that that talks probably like your wife major marbles exactly Donald Trump would say Elise Jordan from what what party Miss Sally Springs mom how is Miss apologize for talking slow and funny this is actually kind of a complicated question because I honestly don't know the answer to it but you were talking about how Congress has ceded all their power to the executive it's part of the problem with this politicized Supreme Court confirmation process you're talking about how Congress isn't debating issues that are actually affecting the future of Americans such as social capital and digital and cyber and a host of other things what can be done as someone who is in the Senate to actually help the Senate work on issues that affect Americans instead of this political it ization of literally everything that they touch yeah so I mean one basic thing we should do is we should actually have a budget and appropriation process that's real not fake in the last there was a rework of the law that governs the budgeting process in 1974 and it worked for about four years but in the 40 years since then Congress has only passed at least 30 a budget that spends at least 30 percent of the public's money on a regular order budget four times in the last 39 years and so with the fiscal year that ends September 30th one thing we can do from the Congress is have a real budgeting process that tells the truth about entitlements because that's where all of our money's actually going the public thinks it's a wasteful bill here or it's some inefficient thing there or it's the food stamps program or it's the military it's really long term and Komets chiefly around retirement as life expectancies going to grow so that's something that should come from Congress but I want to tell you the truth that really we're not gonna fix this stuff without presidential leadership to help focus the country's vision and the country's attention on what those challenges are and so I think the next two or three presidential elections are really going to be critical to having the public understand why the Congress doesn't do its job and right now what happens is almost every bill that's passed here is you know a thousand pages long and it's got three or five hundred undefined terms and you punt it to an executive branch agency that is supposed to define those terms and finish the law really it's supposedly regulations but it's really law writing inside the executive branch only a president can help the American people understand that right now we don't do our campaigns about anything big we just do them about screaming and it's why we have to do better all right Ben Sasse thank you so much for being with us Ben of course from the state that hasn't won a national championship I'm not ready to leave yet what was 1997 was yeah we were yes
