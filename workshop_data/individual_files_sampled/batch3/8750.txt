AS WELL. WE'LL GET BACK TO DAVID LEE MILLER WHEN WE CAN. Bill: BRIAN YENIS MADE HIS WAY TO THE HOME OF BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON IN CHAPPAQUA NEW YORK, AN HOUR'S DRIVE NORTH OF MANHATTAN. BRIAN, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE? RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ABOUT A DOZEN CAMERAS HERE. THE NEWS HELICOPTER IN THE AIR CIRCLING THE CHAPPAQUA HOME OF THE CLINTONS. IT IS BEHIND TREES AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT. THEY BOUGHT THE HOME NEXT DOOR BACK IN 2016 SO THAT THE SECRET SERVICE COULD BETTER PROTECT THIS PROPERTY. THERE IS AN EIGHT-FOOT FENCE AROUND IT. THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW THUS FAR. BILL CLINTON, THE PRESIDENT, WAS HOME AT THE TIME. HILLARY CLINTON IS CURRENTLY IN FLORIDA. SHE WAS IN FLORIDA WHEN THIS DEVICE WAS MAILED. AND SHE HAS BEEN THERE CAMPAIGNING FOR DONNA SHALALA WHO IS RUNNING FOR THE HOUSE IN FLORIDA. FROM WHAT WE KNOW THE POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE WAS INTERCEPTED IN AN OFFSITE FACILITY BY SECRET SERVICE AND WE'VE BEEN REPORTING IT ALL MORNING. THIS DEVICE DID NOT GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE HOME. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A LITTLE CONTEXT HERE. I WAS JUST UP HERE YESTERDAY REPORTING ON THE POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT WAS SENT TO THE HOME OF GEORGE SOROS, THE MEGA DONOR AND BILLIONAIRE DEMOCRAT SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. THE SOROS HOME IS JUST 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM THIS HOME HERE FROM THE CLINTON'S HOME. FROM THAT DEVICE A U.S. OFFICIAL TELLS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE DEVICE THAT WAS SENT HERE TO THE CLINTON HOME AND ALSO THE DEVICE THAT WAS SENT TO GEORGE SOROS. THAT DEVICE THAT WAS SENT TO THE SOROS HOME WAS DESCRIBED AS RESEMBLING A PIPE BOMB. EXPLOSIVE COMPONENTS IN THAT BOMB AND ALSO POWDER THAT WAS FOUND, EXPLOSIVE POWDER THAT WAS FOUND IN THE MAILBOX OF THAT HOME. THE MAILBOX WAS FAR AWAY FROM GEORGE SOROS'S HOME. IT IS A COMPOUND THERE. THE SECURITY BROUGHT IT TO A WOODED AREA. ATF AND F.B.I. EXPLODED THAT DEVICE SAFELY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW THE SURVEILLANCE THEY WERE LOOKING AT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AT THE SOROS HOME TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE PACKAGE WAS HAND DELIVERED OR SENT VIA THE MAIL. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT WHEN WE FIND OUT. THE FACT THAT THIS PACKAGE WAS SENT HERE TO CHAPPAQUA AND INTERCEPTED AT AN OFFSITE FACILITY MAKES IT SEEM THAT POTENTIALLY THAT PACKAGE WAS SENT THROUGH THE MAIL. THE GEORGE SOROS HOME IT WAS FOUND INSIDE A MAILBOX AND LOOKING AT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A THIRD EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK IN TWO WEEKS. LAST WEEK ON OCTOBER 11th A MAN WAS ARRESTED FOR BUILDING A BOMB IN HIS BASEMENT AND HE HAD PLANS ON BOMBING THE NATIONAL MALL IN D.C. Bill: JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU WERE AT SOROS'S HOME. DID INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY GOT GOOD EVIDENCE FROM THE PACKAGE IN THAT MAILBOX? FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND, WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM WITH OUR SOURCES THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO AT LEAST KNOW THE COMPONENTS OF THIS BOMB, WHICH THE FACT THAT THEY SAFELY DETONATED IT MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO POTENTIALLY TAKE PHOTOS AND ANALYZE THIS BOMB BEFORE THEY SAFELY DETONATED IT. THE FACT WE WERE ABLE TO KNOW THERE WAS POWDER IN IT SAYS THEY WERE ABLE TO AT LEAST GET SOME INFORMATION FROM THAT. NOW WE HAVE THE U.S. OFFICIAL TELLING THE ASSOCIATED PRESS NOT OUR REPORTING BUT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTING THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE DEVICES SENT TO THE
