ISN'T ENOUGH. Bill: MORE THE COME FROM THE HILL. Sandra: LET'S BRING IN OUR HEADLINER NEWT GINGRICH. FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "TRUMP'S AMERICA" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. MR. SPEAKER, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING AND YOU'RE HELPING US KICK OFF THE WEEK. IT WILL BE ALL ABOUT KAVANAUGH AND THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION. WHERE DO YOU SEE IT GOING? WELL, FIRST OF ALL CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FIRST YEAR. IT HAS BEEN VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL AND I ALWAYS ENJOY BEING WITH YOU AND BILL. Sandra: THANK YOU. LOOK, I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR IF PEOPLE ARE HONEST AND THEY LOOK AT FOLKS LIKE SENATOR BOOKER SAYING YOU ARE COMPLICIT WITH EVIL IF YOU'RE FOR KAVANAUGH. THEY LOOK AT SENATOR SAYING MEN SHOULD SHUT UP AND YOU SEE WATERS SAYING DRIVE THEM OFF THE STREET. YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATTERNS HERE. THE REAL QUESTION IN THE 2018 ELECTION WILL BE WHAT KIND OF AMERICA DO WE WANT TO BECOME? THE LEFT I DON'T CARE WHAT THE F.B.I. COMES UP WITH, IF THE F.B.I. COMES OUT AND SAYS THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH DID ANYTHING WRONG THE DEMOCRATS WILL PROMPTLY SAY AND SHIFTING TO WHAT ABOUT DRINKING? WHAT ABOUT THIS? WHAT ABOUT THAT? I THINK YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THEY ARE ENGAGED IN A SEARCH AND DESTROY MISSION AS LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID THE OTHER DAY THAT'S DELIBERATE, NOT AN ACCIDENT OR GAME. THEY WANT POWER, AS PRESIDENT LINCOLN WARNED IN HIS COOPER UNION ADDRESS, THEY WANT RULE OR RUIN. AND IF THEY HAVE TO RUIN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM THEY'RE PREPARED TO RUIN IT. YOU ARE LIVING THROUGH IT. I THINK REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT TO GET AWAKE AND UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT SOME GAME AND IT IS NOT BECAUSE SENATOR SCHUMER IS CONFUSED. IT IS A DELIBERATE, VICIOUS, WILLFUL CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. Bill: TWO THINGS I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH OUR VIEWERS HERE. I THINK TECHNICALLY THE CLOCK IS RUNNING ON THE ONE MARK, MCCONNELL CAME TO THE FLOOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND SAID 51 REPUBLICANS HAVE VOTED YES TO ADVANCE THE MOTION. WHICH WOULD MEAN IF IT STARTED ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON THIS COMING FRIDAY THAT'S WHEN WE START TO GO INTO THE SENATE PROCEDURES WHICH WOULD TAKE US PROBABLY THROUGH THE WEEKEND I'M GUESSING WHICH WOULD SET US UP FOR THE FOLLOWING MONDAY OR TUESDAY BASED ON THE CALENDAR. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU AGREE OR NOT. ORRIN HATCH SENT OUT A TWEET QUITE FASCINATING THE SEE THE SUDDEN INTEREST FROM SENATE DEMOCRATS AFTER THEY PREVENTED THE F.B.I. FROM INVESTIGATING FOR SIX WEEKS. BILL CASSIDY CHARACTERIZED IT A DIFFERENT WAY. BEAR IN MIND WHAT THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS AND THE #METOO MOVEMENT. HE SAID THIS, MR. SPEAKER. DEMOCRATS HAVE WEAPONIZED THE #METOO MOVEMENT WHICH IS AWFUL. IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO STOP THE SORT OF BEHAVIOR WE'VE SEEN LIKE HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND BILL COSBY. NOW IT'S WEAPONIZED. ONE PERSON MAKING A CLAIM WHICH SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DR. FORD, SHE STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT. NO ONE ELSE CORROBORATES. Bill: THERE IS A LOT IN HERE AND TAKE IT IN A MOMENT. GIVEN THE WAY THE LAWYERS FOR DR. FORD REALLY NEGOTIATED WITH CHUCK GRASSLEY TO GET HER BEFORE THAT COMMITTEE, DO WE THINK THAT DR. FORD'S ATTORNEYS WILL ALLOW THIS F.B.I. INTERVIEW TO HAPPEN? OR WILL THEY SET CONDITIONS UP FOR THAT INTERVIEW? WHICH IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IF THAT HAPPENS THIS BLOWS PAST THIS COMING FRIDAY. I THINK THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBLEM. THEY ARE FACED WITH THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY FIRST OF ALL, ANY TWO REPUBLICANS CAN STOP PROCEDURE ON FRIDAY. MCCONNELL MAY HAVE SCHEDULED IT BUT IF FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER. ANOTHER ELEVATOR INCIDENT. INCIDENT AT A RESTAURANT. WHO REPUBLICANS GO I'M NOT SURE, THEN FRIDAY DISAPPEARS, TOO. SECOND, REMEMBER, THIS WHOLE THING IS VERY WEIRD. SHE WAS APPARENTLY HIDING AT HER PARENTS' BEACH HOUSE IN DELAWARE, WHICH DEMOCRATIC STAFFERS KNEW THAT. THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A MANIPULATED, DELIBERATE PROCESS DESIGNED, FRANKLY, TO DRIVE IT PAST THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS AND TO KEEP KAVANAUGH OFF OF THE CURRENT COURT WHICH STARTS TODAY. SO I'M VERY DOUBTFUL THAT WE'RE SEEING ANYTHING LIKE FAIR PLAY OR THAT ANYBODY SHOULD RELAX AND BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING HAS BEEN AGREED TO AT THE PRESENT TIME. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL LET HER TALK OR NOT BECAUSE THE F.B.I. IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT BY THE WOMAN PROSECUTOR FROM PHOENIX WHO CAME AND INTERVIEWED HER, SHE IS PRETTY DEVASTATING IN SAYING YOU KNOW, SHE COULDN'T CORROBORATE THIS, THIS OR THIS. I JUST TWEETED OUT THE ENTIRE LETTER SHE SENT THE REPUBLICANS AND YOU LOOK AT THAT. THE FACT IS DR. FORD PROBABLY HAD SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HER. THE QUESTION IS, IS HER MEMORY 36 YEARS LATER ACCURATE AND SHE HAS ZERO CORROBORATION AND A WHOLE LOT OF HOLES IN HER STORY. YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO TAKE ON THE PERSON IN A DIRECT WAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT THE CURRENT APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, BUT AT WHAT POINT DO YOU ALLOW THIS GUY, THIS FATHER, THIS HUSBAND, THIS SON TO BE DESTROYED ON THE UNSUPPORTED ALLEGATION OF A SINGLE PERSON ABOUT A HIGH SCHOOL INCIDENT 36 YEARS AGO FOR WHICH SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER ZERO CORROBORATION? AND I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH. IF THE F.B.I. COMES BACK AND SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG, THE DEMOCRATS BY FRIDAY WILL HAVE FIVE NEW CHARGES. Sandra: MR. SPEAKER, YOU STARTED OUT BY SAYING REPUBLICANS NEED TO WAKE UP. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE REPUBLICANS DO HERE? NOW WE'RE WEEKS AWAY FROM MID-TERM ELECTIONS. WHAT SHOULD BE THE STRATEGY? I THINK OTHER HE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD. THE 2018 ELECTION IS ABOUT WHICH AMERICA DO WE WANT TO BECOME. DO WE WANT TO BE AN AMERICA WHERE PEOPLE RUSH INTO YOUR RESTAURANT AND INVADE YOUR PERSONAL SPACE. AN AMERICA WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE SMEARED AND DESTROYED ON TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED BEHAVIOR? DO WE WANT TO BE AN AMERICA WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS USED AS A WEAPON TO MAKE YOU CHANGE YOUR LIFE? THAT'S WHERE THE LEFT IS. YOU HAVE A CHOICE. YOU SEE THIS THIS MORNING, BY THE WAY, IN THE GREAT NEWS ABOUT THE DEAL WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. YOU HAVE A RESULTS-ORIENTED TEAM LED BY TRUMP AND A RESISTANCE-ORIENTED TEAM LED BY PELOSI AND SCHUMER. REPUBLICANS OUGHT TO SAY WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN FROM FENTANYL AND OPIOID DEATHS. THE DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE. THEY ARE WILLING TO HAVE A TOTALLY OPEN BORDER EVEN IF IT MEANS MORE FENTANYL AND OPIOID DEATHS. WE NEED TO BE AS BLUNT, EMOTIONAL AND DIRECT AS OUR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS OR THEY'LL RUN OVER US. Bill: YOU WROTE A PIECE ABOUT THE BLUE WAVES IN GEORGIA. I WANT TO SHARE A CLIP FROM THE "WASHINGTON POST" ARTICLE, NUMBER 6. THE QUESTIONS FACING DEMOCRATS AND SOME REPUBLICANS AS THE CAMPAIGN BEGINS IN EARNEST, SHOULD THEY ATTACK TRUMP OR CRAFT A MORE UPLIFTING MESSAGE OF THEIR OWN, END QUOTE? THIS HAS BEEN DEBATED NOW. IT IS CRUNCH TIME TO MAKE A DECISION. WHAT DO THEY DO? WELL, IF THE DEMOCRATS CAN'T GET AWAY FROM BEING THE RESISTANCE PARTY IT IS WHAT THEY SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS ON, IT STARTED ELECTION NIGHT. AND MY PREDICTION, I DID THIS I WROTE A SMALL PAPER THAT'S ON AMAZON ON THE 2018 ELECTION AND I STARTED BY LINKING TO AN INTERVIEW I DID WITH MEGYN KELLY TWO WEEKS BEFORE AT THE ELECTION LAST TIME WHEN EVERYBODY KNEW TRUMP WAS GOING TO LOSE. PEOPLE TEND TO FORGET THIS. EVERYBODY KNEW TRUMP WAS GOING TO LOSE. I THINK THE ODDS ARE EVEN MONEY, ELECTION NIGHT 2018 WILL BE AN EVEN WORSE SHOCK FOR THE LEFT THAN 2016 WAS. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT OPEN BORDERS. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT TOLERANCE FOR FENTANYL ON OPIOID DEATHS. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT GIANT TAX INCREASES. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT TO SEE MOBS RUNNING AROUND INTIMIDATING AND PEOPLE AND I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE WEAK GOING INTO THE LAST FIVE WEEKS. Sandra: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT BLUE WAVE. THE BLUE WAVE OF LIBERAL FUNDING. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU HAVE BILLIONAIRES OUT HERE WRITING $100 MILLION CHECKS WHICH IS AN EFFORT. I'M AN OPTIMIST ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE SAW IT HAPPEN IN SOUTH TEXAS IS A STUNNING VICTORY IN A DISTRICT WE HAVE NOT HAD IN THE STATE SENATE IN 139 YEARS. WE WON IN A DISTRICT 63% HISPANIC. WE WON A VICTORY ON BIG ISSUES BECAUSE WE HAD A GREAT CANDIDATE WHO FIT THE DISTRICT, CAMPAIGNED ON BIG ISSUES. HE SAID I WANT TO CONTROL THE BORDER TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE HE SAID I OPPOSE THE DEMOCRAT EFFORTS TO TAX-PAID ABORTION. I WANT LOWER TAXES, MORE TAKE HOME PAY, MORE JOBS. HE LIKES THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A HALF CENTURY AND THE DEMOCRAT HAD NOT MUCH TO BALANCE THAT OFF WITH. IF YOU RUN AS THE PARTY OF TAX PAID ABORTION, THE PARTY OF AN OPEN BOARD. LOOK AT GAVIN NEWSOM RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN CALIFORNIA. HE WANTS TO GET FREE HEALTHCARE TO ANY IMMIGRANT. THAT'S A MAGNET FOR EVERY SICK PERSON ON THE PLANET TO GO TO CALIFORNIA SO CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS CAN PAY FOR THEM AND IT WILL DESTROY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS IS THE MINDLESS STUFF YOU GET FROM THE LEFT.
