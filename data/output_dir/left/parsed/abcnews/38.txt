COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR

THE DATES AND TIME LINE FOR THIS
RESIGNATION HAVE IN THE YET BEEN
ESTABLISHED.
WE ARE EXPECTING A STATEMENT 
FROM SARAH SANDERS MOMENTARILY.
INDEED IT IS TRUE, SHE HAS 
RESIGNED.
I'VE GOT A FEW STATEMENTS FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES SAID HELP IS OUTSTANDING 
AND HAS DONE GREAT WORK FOR THE 
LAST THREE YEARS.
SHE'S AS SMART AND THOUGHTFUL AS
THEY COME.
A TRULY GREAT PERSON.
I WILL MISS HAVING HER BY MY 
SIDE.
WHEN SHE APPROACHED ME ABOUT 
PURSUING OTHER OPPORTUNITIES I 
TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD.
I'M SURE WE'LL WORK TOGETHER 
AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.
CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY 
RELEASED A SIMILAR STATEMENT 
PRAISING HOPE HICKS WORK AND 
HOPE HICKS HERSELF HAS A 
STATEMENT WE JUST RECEIVED.
THERE ARE NO WORDS TO ADEQUATELY
EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I WISH THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION THE VERY BEST AS 
HE CONTINUES TO LEAD OUR 
COUNTRY.
GEORGE, WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR 
DETAILS ON THIS.
YOU MENTIONED RIGHT OUT OF THE 
GATE THIS COMES A DAY AFTER HOPE
HICKS HAD THAT NEARLY NINE HOUR 
TESTIMONY WITH CONGRESSIONAL 
INVESTIGATORS ON CAPITOL HILL AS
THEY ARE INVESTIGATING QUESTIONS
ABOUT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE.
IT ALSO COMES IN THE WAKE OF 
THIS HEADLINES IN THE "NEW YORK 
TIMES" THIS MORNING HOPE HICKS 
TOLD THE INVESTIGATORS AT TIMES 
SHE HAS HAD TO MAKE WHITE LIES 
ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES.
WE DON'T KNOW THE REASON FOR 
HOPE HICKS RESIGNING.
MY COLLEAGUE JOHN CARL IS HERE 
WITH ME RIGHT NOW, I THINK HE'S 
GOING TO COME IN AND HELP OUT ON
THIS REPORTING AS WELL BECAUSE 
THIS NEWS IS JUST BREAKING, 
GEORGE. 
>> I WANT TO BRING THAT TO YOU 
AND OUR CHIEF JUSTICE 
CORRESPONDENT.
JOHN, LET ME BEGIN WITH YOU.
AS I SAID AT THE TOP.
HOPE HICKS HAS BEEN THERE FROM 
THE VERY BEGINNING, STARTED OUT 
SORT OF AS AN AIDE DECAMP.
ROSE TO COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
SHE HAS BEEN BY HIS SIDE HOUR 
AFTER HOUR AFTER HOUR EVERY 
SINGLE DAY OF THIS PRESIDENCY. 
>> ABSOLUTELY EVERY STEP OF THE 
WAY DURING THIS PRESIDENCY, 
GEORGE.
GOING BACK TO THE DAWN OF THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
SHE WAS ONE OF A HANDFUL OF 
STAFFERS WITH THE PRESIDENT EVEN
BEFORE HE DECLARED HE WAS 
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
SINGLE HANDEDLY HANDLING HIS 
COMMUNICATIONS.
BY HIS SIDE AT TRUMP TOWER, BY 
HIS SIDE DURING THE TRANSITION 
AND BY HIS SIDE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
HOPE HICKS OFFICE AND YOU KNOW 
THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE WEST WING 
WELL, HOPE HICKS OFFICE EVEN AS 
SHE TOOK ON COMMUNICATIONS 
DIRECTOR WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE 
OFFICE. 
>> SHE'S BASICALLY IN THE OVAL 
OFFICE SUITE.
WE SEE HER THERE WITH FORMER 
STAFF SECRETARY ROB PORTER.
SHE HAD A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP 
WITH HIM.
HE WAS FACING HIS OWN QUESTIONS 
ABOUT HIS OWN BACKGROUND, A 
BACKGROUND OF DOMESTIC ABUSE.
SHE FACED QUESTIONS IN HER ROLE 
THE INITIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT 
THAT RESIGNATION AN HIS 
POSITION. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AND SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THE 
RESPONSE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD A CLEAR 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST, ONE OF THE
MANY THINGS IN RECENT WEEKS SHE 
HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
>> LET'S BRING IN PIERRE THOMAS.
ALMOST NINE HOURS BEFORE THE 
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 
YESTERDAY, THE FACT HOPE HICKS 
WAS BY THE PRESIDENT'S SIDE FOR 
SO MANY HOURS AND DAYS AND WEEKS
SINCE HIS PRESIDENCY BEGAN MEANS
SHE'S OF SPECIAL INTEREST AS 
WELL TO THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
ROBERT MUELLER.
SHE SPENT TWO DAYS MEETING WITH 
HIS INVESTIGATORS.
OF PARTICULAR INTEREST THERE IS 
HER ROLE IN HELPING THE 
PRESIDENT DRAFT THIS STATEMENT 
ABOUT THAT FAMOUS TRUMP TOWER 
MEETING AND HIS SON DON JR.'S 
INVOLVEMENT, WHICH WAS HIGHLY 
MISLEADING. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.
YOU RECALL SHE'S ENDIRECT 
CONFLICT WITH THE FORMER 
SPOKESMAN FOR TRUMP'S DEFENSE 
FUND AND COUNCIL.
BASICALLY CAROLLO SAID HELPED 
WRITE THE STATEMENT, IT WOULD 
NEVER GET OUT THE REAL REASON 
FOR THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING.
IT WAS DESIGNED TO GET NEGATIVE 
INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY 
CLINTON BUT THEY WROTE THE 
STATEMENT WHICH MADE IT APPEAR 
IT WAS ABOUT RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS.
HE BASICALLY MADE THE CASE THEY 
KNEW FULL WELL THAT'S NOT WHAT 
IT WAS ABOUT BUT PAID THE 
STATEMENT ANYWAY, GEORGE. 
>> MUCH MORE ABOUT THE 
RESIGNATION OF HOPE HICKS.
LET'S LOOK AT ALL OF THE 
TURNOVER IN THE FIRST 14 MONTHS.
PRESIDENT LOST NATIONAL SECURITY
ADVISER SEVERAL COMMUNICATIONS 
AIDES, PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE 
HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF NOW HIS 
CLOSEST PERSONAL AIDE HOPE HICKS
