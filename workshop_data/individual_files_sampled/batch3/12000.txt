and the establishment isn't alone in bashing Russia as they suppose threat to America that's what's also on the minds of tech giants like Facebook Twitter and Google as revealed when the three testified to Congress it seemed to me you were each a little bit vague about oh yes we found hundreds or whatever I'm asking specifically where any of those other countries besides Russia that we're using your platform inappropriately it should be a yes or no I don't have that details I know we definitely work to detect and repel it I know this but where any of them other foreign entities other than Russia I would have to have my team follow up with you on D so you came prepared to help the Democrats establish about Russia but you can't point out any other country is that right congressman we've put public statements okay well let me go tweet you're not answering the question let me go to miss Downes how about on Google that did you detect any other countries besides Russia our security team is trained to protect our services from foreign until we're going to get to answer my question I my guess would be that our security team are you here to guess reaching our security from other foreign governments as well but that information is held confidentially even internally are you only here to do to condemn the Russians thank you how about you mr. pickels be prepared to identify any other foreign countries we're just here to help with Democrats blast Russia after 70 years of Russia helping Democrats make these decisions based on how it leads because you're very good at dodging and refusing to answer the questions so while the US Congress may be obsessed with alleged Russian meddling ordinary people seem far more concerned with other issues rather painfully close to home the latest Gallup poll shows the most important problem for Americans is their current government immigration takes second place racism and the economy are also a worry Russia is one of the least important issues with less than half a percent naming Moscow despite the hysteria whipped up by the mainstream media we can now go live to Ted raw leading political cartoonist columnist and author now the Congress hearing seems to confirm that tech giants are only looking for Russian meddling do you think it's right that companies should only search for interference from Moscow well I'm not even sure the United States is really in a position effectively or morally to complain about any interference in this election considering the fact that the United States medals in the Foreign Affairs and elections of countless other countries that a long history of doing so and even at this point occupying several other foreign countries and has very client states all over the world but if we do accept the idea that the United States is uniquely positioned to complain about electoral interference its internal affairs obviously if you're if you're honest about it you're looking for interference from any possible source whether it be public or private whether it's the governmental or corporate whether it be Russia or any other state actor or non-state actor so things just on Russia at this point given the fact that this investigation has now been going on for over two years and the only quote/unquote evidence that we've seen so has been just he's so-called intelligence community and their official mouthpieces in Washington but no actual evidence has actually been presented to the American people probably I would probably be starting looking almost pretty much knew where except Russia at this point I would think that the Russia would have come out by now and what do you think about that Gallup poll that really shows that regular Americans are much more concerned about other issues and yet those seem to be ignored yeah well I mean I have two immediate reactions the one thing is it's really sad the American people have a representative democracy and people are the citizens of a representative democracy how to write the government discuss the issues that they care about not distractions that they don't care about and it is true that Americans are perennially concerned about issues like rising in inequality the difficulty of finding a high-quality job even in the economy with relatively low unemployment health care and so on and these issues are really not being addressed in any kind of meaningful way by the Congress or for that matter by the White House in the meantime this is just a distraction it is also kind I think something that if either running the Democratic National Committee I would I would be concerned about when you are only you focused on an ad that doesn't seem to really resonate with voters the voters are going to think you're out of touch and tone-deaf and that's what happens in Hillary Clinton in 2016 she was perceived that way and she lost that election more than Donald Trump won it and they're heading towards a repeat of that kind of performance in the 2018 midterms and possibly in 2020 do they continue down of course you
