Derek you know on this outrage question where it all came from very early on in the book you say this is firstworldproblems that there is a sociological function that when people have it too good they need something to complain about and then you also talk about the doomsday cult of global warming and I've always noticed the environmentalist movement really launched into full form after the fall of the Berlin Wall after the Cold War ended after our actual existential threat ended the left just made one up it just invented one out of whole cloth oh is all of this outrage just an aspect and a consequence of our luxury and our decadent society a large part of it is when the Berlin Wall fell in the Soviet Union went away the Left lost they were basically rooting for that side so they needed to come up with another way to oppose capitalism and individual liberty and that was a ready-made one there with the environment what better way to scare the crap out of somebody than to say you're destroying the planet we are destroying the planet we must now cede our Liberty our property to the government in order to save the entire planet and of course if you remember the nineties in the early 2000s Al Gore was running around going those 10 years 10 years or it's too late if we don't do something now it'll be too late well that came and went and we haven't I'm in New York I didn't take a gondola to my hotel we are not flooded the storms that we were promised didn't happen they weren't more frequent they weren't more powerful so rather than what a normal human being would do when something like that goes wrong and reflect like hey maybe I was wrong about this they decided smartly from a diabolical point of view to extend the time frame it used to be ten-year predictions now its 100-year predictions you Michael Knowles if you predicted come Friday the world will end and you get a bunch of followers Saturday morning you're gonna have some explaining to do but if you decide no no in a hundred years the world will end well you can't prove that but more importantly you can't disprove that and now if you look at the climate change studies they are 100-year predictions they talk about the year 2100 because nobody will be around to recognize that they were full of it that they were lied to but we must act now of course the answer is always now whether it was clot with global cooling in the 50s which was a bready for Dan was writing about it in the 50s or global warming in the 80s and 90s or just generic climate change we always must act now in the solution ironically was always the same very curious no matter what the problem was the solution was the same which would cause a normal person to go that's weird when the problem was the exact opposite the solution was the same so they again they have to scare the hell out of you or something like that a question like that might occur to you
