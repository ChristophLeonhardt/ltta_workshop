1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,560
UNDER OATH.

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:02,160
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

3
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:04,129
WHERE ARE WE?

4
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,163
IS THE STORY MOVING FORWARD

5
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:07,732
WHERE WE MIRED IN AN ANGRY X

6
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:13,138
NOT WANT TO BE IS HAVING HIS

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:13,905
CURRENT ATTORNEY FIRING BACK AT

8
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:15,507
HIS LONGTIME ATTORNEY.

9
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:18,944
IT'S NOT A HEALTHY SPOT FOR TEAM

10
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:20,779
TRUMP BECAUSE MICHAEL CULLEN WAS

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,547
A TRUSTED FIXER AND ATTORNEY AND

12
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,916
CONFIDANT FOR MANY YEARS FOR

13
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:25,684
PRESIDENT TRUMP PRIOR TO HIM

14
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:27,786
BEING PRESIDENT AND IF HE HAS

15
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:29,888
DECIDED IT IS IN HIS INTEREST TO

16
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:31,189
FLIP ON TRUMP WHETHER HE'S

17
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,257
TELLING THE NEW TRUTHS OR

18
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:33,224
INVENTING NEW STORIES TO HELP

19
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:38,229
HIS OWN SELF, SAVE HIS OWN SKIN,

20
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,698
AND THAT IS A WAR OF WORDS THAT

21
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,766
IS NOT PARTICULARLY HELPFUL TO

22
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,572
GIULIANI GO ON TV AND PURSING

23
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:48,540
WHETHER CERTAIN RECORDINGS CUT

24
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,808
OFF AT A CERTAIN TIME AND ASKING

25
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,177
WHY THAT'S THE CASE, NOT A

26
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,746
HEALTHY SPOT.

27
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:55,447
>> Harris: 'S A OF DEVELOPMENT

28
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:57,882
TODAY THAT WE'VE SEEN, AND THAT

29
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,552
SOMEWHAT COMING FROM GIULIANI

30
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:01,519
AND OTHER REPORTING AND THAT IS

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,655
THERE MAY NOT BE ANY OTHER TAPES

32
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:04,856
OF THE PRESIDENT'S VOICE ON

33
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:05,156
THEM.

34
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:07,726
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF TAPES

35
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:08,460
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION HOW MANY

36
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,763
PEOPLE WAS HE RECORDING?

37
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:12,197
WE DON'T KNOW.

38
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:12,864
>> Kennedy: YOU DON'T KNOW.

39
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:18,336
GIULIANI IS CLEARLY TRYING TO

40
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:20,572
CAST SO MUCH DOUBT ON THE TAPES

41
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:22,140
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE

42
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,742
DOCTORS AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY

43
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:24,542
TAPES, THEIR DIGITAL RECORDINGS

44
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,144
SINCE HE RECORDED THEM WITH HIS

45
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:26,978
PHONE, IT'S NOT LIKE HE HAD A

46
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,589
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO CHOP THAT

47
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,757
STUFF UP ON YOUR PHONE.

48
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:39,891
I DON'T KNOW WHY CNN WAS IT MORE

49
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:51,936
LOVE TO PLAY THE WORLD ANYTHING

50
00:01:51,937 --> 00:01:52,971
THEY COULD DAMAGE THE PRESIDENT,

51
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:56,941
BUT WE ARE GETTING SO FAR AWAY

52
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:57,876
FROM FOCUS AND OBJECTIVITY AND

53
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:00,745
IT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING

54
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,382
TO SEE, IS TALKING ABOUT THE

55
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:05,784
PRESIDENT ENOUGH TO DAMAGE HIS

56
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:07,585
REPUTATION THAT HE IS ULTIMATELY

57
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,553
REMOVED FROM OFFICE?

58
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:09,320
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE AIM OF MANY

59
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,493
YOUR SCREEN BECAUSE THAT IS THE

60
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:17,696
WHITE HOUSE AND OF COURSE, WE

61
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:19,631
ARE WAITING FOR ITALY'S

62
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:21,266
PRIME MINISTER TO JOIN OUR

63
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,772
HE WILL ARRIVE, THIS IS VERY

64
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,907
TRADITIONAL AND SO WE ALWAYS

65
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:30,975
LIKE TO CAPTURE THESE PICTURES

66
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:31,776
WITH A HAPPEN.

67
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,778
AS A PARTICULARLY SPECIAL AND

68
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,880
INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS MAN

69
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,949
CONTE IS SUPPOSED TO BE OR HAS

70
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,885
SAID TO BE THE CLOSEST ALLY

71
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:41,486
SUPPORTER OF OUR CURRENT

72
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:43,188
PRESIDENT IN EUROPE.

73
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:45,390
SO THIS WILL BE ONE TO WATCH,

74
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:46,591
THEY WILL HAVE A BILATERAL

75
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:47,892
MEETING, THEY WILL HAVE A NEWS

76
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:48,593
CONFERENCE A BIT LATER AND WE

77
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:51,396
WILL COVER IT AS IT HAPPENS HERE

78
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:51,830
ON

79
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:52,363
ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

80
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:54,132
SO THAT IS OFF TO THE LEFT OF

81
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,266
THE SCREEN AS YOU LOOK AT YOUR

82
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:57,302
TV AND I JUST WANT TO REFERENCE

83
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:58,570
THAT.

84
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:00,371
THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A

85
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,440
QUIET FROM DEMOCRATS ON THIS.

86
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,141
CHUCK SCHUMER IS ALWAYS OUT

87
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,844
THERE SAYING SOMETHING.

88
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:11,883
SITUATIONS WHERE YOU SIT BACK

89
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,818
AND LET THE ATTORNEYS THAT

90
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,489
THEMSELVES ON PROVERBIAL FIRE?

91
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,690
>> Adrienne: I THINK A LOT OF

92
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:21,659
BE COMING TOWARD AN END.

93
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,794
IF YOU HAVE SO MANY THINGS THAT

94
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,663
ARE CULMINATING THAT INSIST THAT

95
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,632
IS COMING TO AN END.

96
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:28,266
>> Harris: I HAVEN'T HEARD

97
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,201
DEMOCRAT SAY THAT.

98
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:31,936
>> Adrienne: THE WAY THAT HE

99
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:32,704
IS INTERVIEWING WITNESSES, THE

100
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,572
WAY THAT HE'S BRINGING THEM.

101
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:36,174
YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DON'T ASSUME

102
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:36,541
ANYTHING.

103
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:40,378
BUT IT WOULD NOT BE A CRAZY

104
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,179
ASSUMPTION TO THINK THAT THIS IS

105
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,948
NOT COMING TO AN END SOONER

106
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,550
RATHER THAN LATER.

107
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:47,352
HOWEVER, ON THIS PARTICULAR

108
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,320
POINT, RUDY GIULIANI IS DIGGING

109
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:50,855
HIS OWN DEATH, SO WHAT ARE THEY

110
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,958
WANT TO STEP INTO IT?

111
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:54,659
HE IS CONSTANTLY CONTRADICTING

112
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,226
HIMSELF ON TELEVISION.

113
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,495
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, HE CALLED

114
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:59,264
MICHAEL COHEN AN HONEST MAN.

115
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:00,398
>> Harris: HE DID NOT KNOW

116
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,132
ABOUT THIS TAPE AND THAT'S WHAT

117
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:03,334
HE'S BEEN SAYING.

118
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:03,968
>> Adrienne: NOW HE'S

119
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:04,969
DISPARAGING THE CREDIBILITY OF

120
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,336
THE TAPE.

121
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:06,838
I THINK THE LAST PERSON WHO

122
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,573
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CURRENT

123
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:09,908
ATTORNEY WOULD WANT TO CRITICIZE

124
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:10,809
IS MICHAEL CULLEN.

125
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,681
MICHAEL COHEN KNOWS A LOT.

126
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:17,749
IT'S BEEN HIS ATTORNEY FOR

127
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,750
YEARS.

128
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
>> Kennedy: THEY WERE SO

129
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:20,552
TERRIFIED AND OBVIOUSLY THE

130
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,219
PRESIDENT AND HIS ASSOCIATES

131
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,921
KNOW THE CONTENT OF THE MEETINGS

132
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:33,464
YOU WOULD COME UP WITH RADIO

133
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:33,798
SILENCE.

134
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:37,969
NOT NECESSARILY FROM DEMOCRATS.

135
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,670
>> Harris: WHATEVER IS

136
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:41,172
GETTABLE, HE WANTS IT.

137
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:42,240
SPEAKING WHENEVER I HEAR THE

138
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,309
CLINTON CLEANER OUT THERE

139
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,745
DEFENDING THE TRUMP, MY EARS, I

140
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,881
JUST FEEL LIKE I WANT TO WATCH

141
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:50,982
THEM OUT WITH SOMETHING BECAUSE

142
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,884
IT'S ALSO TAWDRY.

143
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:54,819
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID EARLIER OVER

144
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,422
THE WEEKEND WHEN HE SAID I'VE

145
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,423
BEEN A LAWYER FOR A LONG TIME

146
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,157
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A LAWYER

147
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:02,527
BEHAVE THIS WAY TALKING ABOUT

148
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:03,962
COHEN AND THE FACT THAT HE

149
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:04,529
RECORDED ALL OF THESE

150
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,598
CONVERSATIONS WITH CLIENTS AND

151
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,132
NOW HE'S SAYING THE REASON WHY

152
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,534
HE DID THIS IS BECAUSE HE LIKE

153
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:10,235
TO RECORD THINGS RATHER THAN

154
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:13,204
TAKING NOTES.

155
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:25,316
HE HAS SAID THAT IT IS ACTUALLY

156
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,287
DEVICES THAT PEOPLE MIGHT RECORD

157
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,155
TO HELP TAKE NOTES.

158
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,957
IT MAKES IT EASIER

159
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:33,558
CONTEMPORANEOUSLY.

160
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,759
YOU CAN GET AN ASSISTANT TO HELP

161
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,764
YOU TRANSCRIBE.

162
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:43,368
THEY SAID IT WASN'T UNCOMMON.

163
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,335
>> Guy: IS AN INTERESTING

164
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:45,136
CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT THE

165
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:45,870
TAPE BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S

166
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:48,373
VOICE ON ONE OF THEM.

167
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:49,507
>> Harris: WOULDN'T YOU TELL

168
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:50,208
THE PRESIDENT THAT YOU WERE

169
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,377
RECORDING HIM IF HE WERE HIS

170
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:52,744
CONFIDANT?

171
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:54,345
>> Guy: YOU ASSUME TRUMP WOULD

172
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:55,480
BE UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET TO LEARN

173
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,648
THAT HE WAS SURREPTITIOUSLY

174
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,782
RECORDED BY HIS OWN ATTORNEY AND

175
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:00,885
THAT TAPE IS NOW LEAKING TO CNN.

176
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,153
AS A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.

177
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:07,325
TODAY ON OUR NETWORK AND ANOTHER

178
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,527
ONE SAYING THAT COLLUSION IS NOT

179
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:11,763
A CRIME.

180
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:14,799
WAS IS A CHANGE OR A PIVOT FROM

181
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,134
THERE IS NO COLLUSION.

182
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:16,834
AND I'M SITTING HERE WATCHING

183
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:23,975
A NEW LEGAL STRATEGY?

184
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:24,842
THEY HAVE INSISTED AND SWORN TOP

185
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,144
TO BOTTOM THERE WAS NO

186
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:28,379
COLLUSION, AND IF THE PRESIDENT

187
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,182
TOP LAWYER NOW IS OUT THERE

188
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,183
CEDING THIS MESSAGING ON

189
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,184
