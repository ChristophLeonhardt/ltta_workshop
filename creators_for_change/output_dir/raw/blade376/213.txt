00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,080
sometimes in life<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are important</font>

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,940
things we'd like to say to particular

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think in the case that I'm</font>

4
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about it can range from good to</font>

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,390
bad by using vlogging by putting

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,430
yourself out there in public you could

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,410
actually address you know these things

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say to people</font>

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,320
without actually saying their name now

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,570
this may make you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask what would be the</font>

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,180
point of that well I guess if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,649
give you the two ends of the spectrum

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,170
then maybe you'd begin to understand

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,930
there will be people in life that have

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,690
had a huge positive impact on you and

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,610
you may like to show your appreciation

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,899
in a public<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain but without giving</font>

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,910
their name it would you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> shield them</font>

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,340
from embarrassment and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,170
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them the credit they deserve</font>

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,690
without you know putting them too much

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,339
on the spot the other end of the

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,140
spectrum is those that have had a

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,119
negative impact on your life the people

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to you</font>

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,040
directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps in any other medium you</font>

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,210
wouldn't be able to have contact with

28
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,640
but you can stare right into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera</font>

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,970
and just speak your mind I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by</font>

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,189
not giving their name actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows</font>

31
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,380
you to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue and without</font>

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,659
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> them any real credit and of</font>

33
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">course when they see the video and look</font>

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">down at how people respond to that I</font>

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,030
think it would give an interesting

36
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,799
perspective of you know where they stand

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,950
in society due to their actions I hope

38
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made sense this could be a really</font>

39
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,329
lame idea but I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually got two</font>

40
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,490
examples and I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> also be interested to</font>

41
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,159
see your video posts of who you would be

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,960
speaking to you can talk to just one

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,509
person directly good or bad or you may

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,100
want to do what I've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in you know</font>

45
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,960
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you one good and one bad you</font>

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,409
know keep the balance enjoy

47
00:02:12,350 --> 00:00:00,000
