THE FOUNDING OF OUR BRAVE U.S. 

5
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,676
ARMY AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT 

6
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,178

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,613

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,415
AND IF I DO SAY SO, I DON'T 

10
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,183
THINK HE LOOKS A DAY OVER 35. 

11
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,587
WITH THAT, I'LL TAKE YOUR 

12
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,623
QUESTIONS. 

13
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,457
>> SARAH, THANK YOU. 

14
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,993

HAVE READ SO FAR. 

18
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,199
AND HAVE YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY 

19
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,969
TO DISCUSS WITH THE PRESIDENT 

20
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,470
THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL'S 

21
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,605
IDEA OF SUING THE TRUMP 

22
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,706
FOUNDATION TO HAVE IT SHUT DOWN 

23
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,140
IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 

24
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,310
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED ON 

25
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,212
THE IG REPORT EARLIER TODAY. 

26
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,615
>>> AND IT REAFFIRMED THE 

27
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,216
PRESIDENT'S SUSPICIONS ABOUT 

28
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,584
COMEY'S CONDUCT AND THE 

29
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:57,056
POLITICAL BIAS AMONG SOME OF 

30
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:01,761
THE MEMBERS OF THE FBI. 

31
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,563
AS TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION, THE 

32
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:08,234
PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED ABOUT 

33
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:08,434
THIS. 

34
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,001
SPECIFICALLY EARLIER TODAY. 

35
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:09,802
THE FOUNDATION RAISED $18 

36
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,938
MILLION WHILE GIVING $19 

37
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,507
MILLION TO CHARITY WHILE 

38
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,507
VIRTUALLY HAVING ZERO EXPENSES. 

39
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:17,377
THE PREVIOUS NEW YORK AG WHO 

40
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,747
WAS FORCE TODAY RETIRE IN 

41
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,781
DISGRACE MADE ITS STATED 

42
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,816
MISSION TO ADVANCE HIS OWN 

43
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:25,818
POLITICAL GAIN AND THE CURRENT 

44
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,220
ACTING NEW YORK AG HAS STATED 

45
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,688
THAT BATTLING THE WHITE HOUSE 

46
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,825
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB SHE 

47
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:33,926
HAS EVER DONE. 

48
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,262
THAT SOUNDS OUTRAGEOUSLY BIASED 

49
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:36,796
AND PROBLEMATIC. 

50
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,498
AND VERY CONCERNING. 

51
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,065
CECILIA. 

52
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,499
>> IN THE STATE OF THE UNION, 

53
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:41,801
THE PRESIDENT HAD HARSH WORDS 

54
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,569
FOR NORTH KOREA. 

55
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,838
HE SAID NO REGIME HAS OPPRESSED 

56
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:47,607
ITS OWN CITIZENS MORE BRUTALLY 

57
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,141
THAN NORTH KOREA. 

58
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:54,480
WHY IS HE NOW DOWNPLAYING NORTH 

59
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,582
KOREA'S HORRIFIC ATROCITIES. 

60
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:58,651
>> HE HAS NOT DOWNPLAYED. 

61
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,353
HE HAS RAIDED THE HUMAN RIGHTS 

62
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,224
RECORDS AND SOME OF THE ABUSES 

63
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,292
OF THE REGIME ON A NUMBER OF 

64
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:06,592
OCCASIONS. 

65
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:07,760
HE RAISED THEM AT THE SUMMIT 

66
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,632
THAT TOOK PLACE EARLIER THIS 

67
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:12,832
WEEK. 

68
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:13,466
THE FOCUS WAS DENUCLEARIZATION 

69
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,170
AND THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF WHAT 

70
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,637
TOOK PLACE THERE. 

71
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,606
>> ON FOX NEWS HE SAID A LOT OF 

72
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,975
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE REALLY 

73
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,275
BAD THINGS. 

74
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,711
HOW IS THAT NOT DOWNPLAYING THE 

75
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:26,012
ATROCITIES. 

76
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,513
>> THAT IS A FACTUAL STATEMENT. 

77
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,081
PEOPLE HAVE DONE BAD THINGS. 

78
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,116
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T IGNORED 

79
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,384
THE BAD THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN 

80
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,986
DONE BY THE NORTH KOREAN 

81
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,219
REGIME. 

82
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,487
HE HAS DIRECTLY CALLED IT OUT 

83
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,256
ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AS YOU 

84
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,257
YOURSELF MENTIONED AND HE 

85
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,626
BROUGHT IT UP AT THE SUMMIT AND 

86
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,262
AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE SUMMIT 

87
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,263
WAS TO FOCUS ON 

88
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,631
DENUCLEARIZATION AND LOOKING 

89
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,564
TOWARDS THE BRIGHTER FUTURE. 

90
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,400
THAT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 

91
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,435
TRYING TO DO. 

92
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:49,701
MARGARET. 

93
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:50,202
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

94
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:51,871
CAN YOU CONFIRM THERE IS A

00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,773
MEETING TODAY THAT THERE ARE 

96
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,306
CHINESE TARIFFS COMING 

97
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:54,573
TOMORROW. 

98
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,242
AND THERE WAS A REPORT THAT 

99
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:56,575
SOMEWHERE -- 

100
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,611
>> THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 

101
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,413
WE WILL GO ONE AT A TIME. 

102
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,548
FIRST YES THERE IS A TRADE 

103
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,250
MEETING TODAY. 

104
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,318
IN TERMS OF ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS, 

105
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,321
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED WHEN WE 

106
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,788
HAVE SOMETHING TO ANNOUNCE. 

107
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:12,725
>> THE THIRD PART OF MY 

108
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,161
QUESTION, THERE HAS BEEN A 

109
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,629
REPORT THAT 800 TO 900 CHINESE 

110
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,232
PRODUCTS WILL BE ON THE TARIFFS 

111
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:19,432
LIST. 

112
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,401
IT SEEMS LIKE QUITE A HIGH 

113
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,837
NUMBER, EVEN THOUGH I GUESS THE 

114
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:25,571
HIGHEST NUMBER IS 1300. 

115
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,373
IF THAT NUMBER IS HIGHER THAN 

116
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,310
IT REALLY IS, COULD YOU TELL US 

117
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:30,510
NOW? 

118
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,211
>> WELL, I'M NOT MAKING ANY 

119
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:32,578
ANNOUNCEMENTS. 

120
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,547
IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO GIVE 

121
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,915
DETAILS OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT 

122
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,216
WE'RE NOT READY TO MAKE. 

123
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,285
WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL, WE WILL 

124
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,119
KEEP YOU POSTED. 

125

ANY DETAILS. 

127
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:43,823
>>> DAVID. 

128
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,292
>> TWO QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T 

129
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:46,492
MIND. 

130
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,427
THE PRESIDENT SAID EARLIER THIS 

131
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,396
WEEK THAT HE DID SPEAK WITH KIM 

132
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,497
JONG-UN ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 

133
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:51,730
ABUSES. 

134
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,299
CAN YOU TELL US EXACTLY WHAT 

135
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,069
AREAS OF CONCERN THEY TALKED 

136
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,602
ABOUT? 

137
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:59,172
WAS IT THE WORK CAMPS, TORTURE, 

138
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,342
PUBLIC EXECUTIONS, THE LACK OF 

139
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,075
FREEDOM RELIGION, PRESS, 

140
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:03,542
WOMEN'S RIGHTS. 

141
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:04,543
WHAT DID THEY TALK ABOUT. 

142
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:06,546
>> THEY COVERED A NUMBER OF 

143
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,379
DIFFERENT TOPICS. 

144
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,981
A COUPLE THAT YOU LISTED. 

145
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,017
I'M NOT GOOD TO GET INTO ALL OF 

146
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,919
THE DETAILS OF THE PRIVATE 

147
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,252
CONVERSATION. 

148
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,554
BUT AS THE PRESIDENT HAS 

149
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,422
PUBLICLY STATED HE BROUGHT UP 

150
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,860
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF THE 

151
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,828

IS SEPARATED FROM HIS THIRD

00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,139
WIFE. 

160
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,540
HAS THIS BECOME TOO BIG OF A 

161
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,942
DISTRACTS TO THE POINT THAT THE 

162
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,510
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO GET 

163
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,143

I'M NOT AWARE OF A CALL AND

00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,152
ACROSS THE BORDER. 

189
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,154
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL EARLIER 

190
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,921
TODAY SAID THAT SOMEHOW THERE 

191
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,525
IS A JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS IN 

192
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:25,825
THE BIBLE. 

193
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,094
WHERE DOES IT SAY IN THE BIBLE 

194
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,563
THAT IT IS MORAL TO TAKE 

195
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,697
CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR 

196
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:32,565
MOTHERS? 

197
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,000
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THE 

198
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,036
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COMMENTS OR 

199
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,004
WHAT HE WOULD BE REFERENCING. 

200
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:43,609
I CAN SAY THAT IT IS VERY 

201
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,944
BIBLICAL TO ENFORCE THE LAW. 

202
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,946
THAT IS REPEATED A NUMBER OF 

203
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:47,813
TIMES THROUGHOUT THE BIBLE. 

204
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:48,180
HOLD ON, JIM. 

205
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,581
IF YOU WILL LET ME FINISH. 

206
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:52,251
AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT 

207
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,486
ON THE ATTORNEY'S COMMENTS THAT 

208
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:53,853
I HAVEN'T SEEN. 

209
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,021
>> YOU SAID IT IS IN THE BIBLE 

210
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,122
TO FOLLOW THE LAW. 

211
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,690
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. 

212
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,159
AND I KNOW IT IS HARD TO 

213
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:00,960
UNDERSTAND EVEN SHORT 

214
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,427
SENTENCES, I GUESS. 

215
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,931
DON'T TAKE MY WORDS OUT OF 

216
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:05,198
CONTEXT. 

217
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,332
BUT THE SEPARATION OF ALIEN 

218
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,434
FAMILIES IS THE PRODUCT OF THE 

219
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,802
SAME LEGAL LOOPHOLE THAT'S 

220
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,603
DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO CLOSE. 

221
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,437
AND THESE LAWS ARE THE SAME 

222
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,506
THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR 

223
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,406
OVER A DECADE. 

224
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:17,777
AND THE PRESIDENT IS SIMPLY 

225
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,244
ENFORCING THEM. 

226
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,679
>> TO TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM 

227
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,278
THEIR PARENTS. 

228
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:21,814
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE HORROR THAT 

229
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,149
THESE CHILDREN ARE GOING 

230
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:23,416
THROUGH. 

231
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,050
>> ENFORCE THE LAW. 

232
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,117
>> WHEN THEY COME ACROSS THE 

233
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:27,253
BORDER WITH THEIR PARENTS AND 

234
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,488
THEY'RE SUDDENLY PULLED AWAY 

235
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,354
FROM THEIR PARENTS? 

236
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:30,389
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING 

237
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:30,589
THIS. 

238
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,124
>> BECAUSE IT IS THE LAW AND 

239
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,158
THAT'S WHAT THE LAW STATES. 

240
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:34,760
>> YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE TO DO 

241
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:34,960
THAT. 

242
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,360
>> YOU'RE RIGHT. 

243
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,496
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE LAW. 

244
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,031
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS ACTUALLY 

245
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,267
CALLED ON DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS 

246
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,034
TO FIX THE LOOPHOLES. 

247
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,169
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED TO 

248
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,104
COME TO THE TABLE, FAILED TO 

249
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,073
HELP THIS PRESIDENT CLOSE THESE 

250
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,840
LOOPHOLES AND FIX THIS PROBLEM. 

251
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,309
WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A 

252
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,576
PROBLEM. 

253
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,444
THE PRESIDENT HAS TRIED TO 

254
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,613
ADDRESS IT A NUMBER OF 

255
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:53,913
OCCASIONS. 

256
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,414
WE LAID OUT A PROPOSAL AND 

257
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,049
DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO DO THEIR 

258
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,951
JOB AND FIX THE PROBLEM. 

259
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:00,552
PAULA, GO AHEAD. 

260
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,087
>> SORRY, JIM. 

261
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,088
I GAVE YOU ENOUGH TIME. 

262
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,123
>> THERE IS NO LAW THAT 

263
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,224
REQUIRES THAT FAMILIES BE 

264
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,427
SEPARATED AT THE BORDER. 

265
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,529
THIS WAS THE ADMINISTRATION'S 

266
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,031
CHOICE TO CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE 

267
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,366
PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THE 

268
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:15,635
BORDER ILLEGALLY AND SEPARATE 

269
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:15,868
FAMILY. 

270
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,702
WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION FIND 

271
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,170
THIS WAS NECESSARY AND IF IT 

272
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,505
DOES NOT HAVE AN EFFECT, WILL 

273
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,272
YOU CONTINUE THE POLICY. 

274
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,507
>> AGAIN, THE LAWS ARE THE ONE 

275
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,775
THAT'S HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS 

276
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,477
FOR OVER A DECADE AND THE 

277
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,378
PRESIDENT IS ENFORCING THEM. 

278
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:29,482
WE WOULD LIKE TO FIX THE BROKEN 

279
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,717
SYSTEM THAT OUR IMMIGRATION AND 

280
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,651
FIX OUR IMMIGRATION PROBLEM. 

281
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,353
HOWEVER, UNTIL DEMOCRATS ARE 

282
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,721
WILLING TO ACTUALLY FIX THIS 

283
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,755
PROBLEM IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE. 

284
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:40,226
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT 

285
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:40,459
FIXED. 

286
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:40,659
JILL. 

287
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,794
>> IT DOESN'T TAKE 

288
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,095
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS POLICY 

289
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,298
CHANGE IN HANDLING THEM AS 

290
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,998
CIVIL MATTERS TO CRIMINAL. 

291
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:49,435
>> IT IS NOT A POLICY CHANGE TO 

292
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,803
ENFORCE THE LAW. 

293
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,671
THAT HAS BEEN THE 

294
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,772
ADMINISTRATION POLICY SINCE THE 

295
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,807
DAY WE GOT HERE. 

296
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,475
IT HAS BEEN OUR 

297
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,075
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY -- 

298
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,645
>> SAID IT WAS A DETERRENT. 

299
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,314
DETERRING PEOPLE FROM COMING 

300
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:01,781
HERE ILLEGALLY. 

301
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,349
>> OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD 

302
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,483
THE SAME POSITION SINCE WE 

303
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,985
STARTED ON DAY ONE THAT WE WERE 

304
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
GOING TO ENFORCE THE LAW. 

305
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,387
I KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING THAT 

306
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,156
WASN'T HIGH ON THE PRIORITY 

307
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,958
LIST IN THE PREVIOUS 

308
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,325
ADMINISTRATION. 

309
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,694
BUT IT IS ON OURS. 

310
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,995
WE'RE COUNTRY OF LAW AND ORDER 

311
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,698
AND ENFORCING THE LAW AND 

312
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,331
PROTECTING OUR BORDERS. 

313
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:21,500
WE WOULD LIKE TO FIX THE 

314
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,800
LOOPHOLES. 

315
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,369
IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO GET 

316
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,236
SERIOUS ABOUT IT, THEY'RE 

317
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:25,338
WELCOME TO COME AND SIT DOWN 

318
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,272
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND DO 

319
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:26,705
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 

320
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:29,709
>> DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EMPATHY 

321
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,276
-- COME ON, SARAH. 

322
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,144
YOU'RE A PARENT. 

323
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,780
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EMPATHY WHAT 

324
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,448
THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. 

325
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,116
>> SETTLE DOWN. 

326
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,884
I'M TRYING TO BE SERIOUS. 

327
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,919
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU 

328
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,188
YELL OUT A TERM. 

329
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,724
>> THEY HAVE -- THESE PEOPLE 

330
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,091
HAVE NOTHING. 

331
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,826
>> BRIAN, I KNOW YOU WANT TO 

332
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,427
GET MORE TV TIME. 

333
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,729
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. 

334
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:51,230
GO AHEAD, JILL. 

335
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,764
>> ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

336
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,300
IT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION. 

337
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,867
THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING. 

338
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,936
THEY COME TO THE BORDER WITH 

339
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,202
NOTHING. 

340
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,005
AND YOU THROW CHILDREN IN 

341
00:08:59,005 --> 00:08:59,238
CAGES. 

342
00:08:59,238 --> 00:08:59,639
YOU'RE A PARENT. 

343
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,407
YOU'RE A PARENT OF YOUNG 

344
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:01,674
CHILDREN. 

345
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,275
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EMPATHY FOR 

346
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,243
WHAT THEY GO THROUGH. 

347
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,043
>> JILL, GO AHEAD. 

348
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:07,012
>> TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU. 

349
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:09,882
DOES THE PRESIDENT REALLY 

350
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,185
BELIEVE THAT IS PART OF RUSSIA 

351
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,288
BECAUSE PEOPLE SPEAK RUSSIAN. 

352
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,022
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT KIM 

353
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:16,322
JONG-UN -- 

354
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,757
>> LET ME ANSWER YOUR FIRST 

355
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,024
QUESTION. 

356
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,125
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY COMMENT 

357
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:19,425
LIKE THAT. 

358
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,594
I KNOW IT HAS BEEN REPORTED BUT 

359
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,195
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON A 

360
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,497
PRIVATE CONVERSATION THAT I 

361
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,097
WASN'T A PART OF. 

362
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,866
THAT I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION 

363
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,032
ON. 

364
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:27,533
THE SECOND PART. 

365
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,467
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT KIM 

366
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,102
JONG-UN TOLD HIM THAT NORTH 

367
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,838
KOREA WAS WORKING TO DESTROY A 

368
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,308
MAJOR MISSILE ENGINE TESTING 

369
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:36,541
SITE. 

370
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,042
IS THAT THE SOHAI SITE. 

371
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:41,279
>> WE WILL HAVE SPECIFIC 

372
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:41,546
DETAILS. 

373
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:42,047
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE 

374
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:45,417
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND WILL 

375
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,785
GET YOU THAT DEFENSE. 

376
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,187
>> EARLIER THIS YEAR THE 

377
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,189
PRESIDENT SUGGESTED THAT THE 

378
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,557
DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL HOROWITZ 

379
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,659
WAS, QUOTE, AN OBAMA GUY. 

380
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,627
HOW DOES THE PRESIDENT VIEW 

381
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,862
HOROWITZ TODAY AND DOES HE FEEL 

382
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,865
THIS INVESTIGATION WAS 

383
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:00,132
THOROUGH. 

384
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,467
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT THINKS 

385
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,635
THAT THIS REPORT REAFFIRMS THE 

386
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:08,941
SUSPICIONS THAT HE HAD ABOUT 

387
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,174
COMEY. 

388
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:10,676
AND THE DIRECTOR WILL HOLD A 

389
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,446
PRESS CONFERENCE LATER TODAY 

390
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,647
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO 

391
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,216
TUNE IN FOR THAT. 

392
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,485
>> THE TEXT MESSAGE BETWEEN 

393
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,020
PAGE AND STRUCK ULTIMATELY THE 

394
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,888
FBI AGENT STRUCK SAID WE WILL 

395
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,424
STOP IT AND HE WAS REFERRING TO 

396
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:25,991
CANDIDATE TRUMP BECOMING 

397
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:26,291
PRESIDENT. 

398
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,561
DID THE PRESIDENT HAVE ANY 

399
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,295
REACTION TO THIS INFORMATION 

400
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,330
WHEN YOU SPOKE WITH HIM AFTER 

401
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,497
HE WAS BRIEFED TODAY. 

402
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:34,100
>> CERTAINLY AGAIN CAUSES A 

403
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,799
GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN. 

404
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,002
AND I THINK POINTS OUT THE 

405
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:37,937
POLITICAL BIAS THAT THE 

406
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,438
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TALKING 

407
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,307
ABOUT AND HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY 

408
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,108
MENTIONED FROM THIS 

409
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,976
ADMINISTRATION THAT WE FOUND TO 

410
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,611
BE A HUGE PROBLEM AND WE'RE 

411
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,179
GLAD THEY'RE LOOKING INTO IT. 

412
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,480
>> SARAH, THANK YOU. 

413
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,216
DID THE PRESIDENT OR ANYONE 

414
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,118
ELSE USE FUNDS FROM THE TRUMP 

415
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,652
FOUNDATION TO PAY FOR PERSONAL 

416
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:54,586
BUSINESS OR CAMPAIGN EXPENSES. 

417
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:59,492
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THAT 

418
00:10:59,492 --> 00:10:59,859
TAKING PLACE. 

419
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,792
>> CAN YOU DEFINITIVELY SAY NO. 

420
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,494
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF IT. 

421
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:03,829
I WOULD HAVE TO GET MORE 

422
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,162
INFORMATION. 

423
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,498
BUT I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE 

424
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,799
TRUMP FOUNDATION FOR THAT 

425
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,199
SPECIFIC POINT. 

426
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,468
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT 

427
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:09,901
THAT SPECIFICALLY. 

428
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,036
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID SEVERAL 

429
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,371
MONTHS AGO HE DOESN'T THINK 

430
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,706
MICHAEL COHEN IS GOING TO FLIP. 

431
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,940
IS THAT STILL THE CASE. 

432
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,374
>> I'M SORRY. 

433
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,910
I DIDN'T HEAR THE LAST PART. 

434
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,811
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED 

435
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,346
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THAT HE 

436
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,881
DOESN'T THINK THAT COHEN IS 

437
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,281
GOING TO FLIP. 

438
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,381
DOES HE STILL THINK THAT IS THE 

439
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:23,582
CASE. 

440
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,618
>> I WOULD REFER YOU BACK TO 

441
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,220
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENT. 

442
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,855
JOHN. 

443
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,623
>> TWO QUESTIONS, SARAH. 

444
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:31,923
THANK YOU. 

445
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:35,795
FIRST, THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS 

446
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,932
ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS AND IN 

447
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,134
DETAIL ABOUT EPA HAD SCOTT 

448
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,702
PRUITT DOING THINGS THAT BORDER 

449
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,671
ON THE UNETHICAL AND ALMOST ON 

450
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,940
A DAILY BASIS REPUBLICAN 

451
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,910
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CALLED FOR 

452
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,310
HIS RESIGNATION. 

453
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,611
WHAT IS HIS STATUS WITHIN THE 

454
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,779
ADMINISTRATION AND DOES THE 

455
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,082
PRESIDENT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 

456
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:57,983
HIM TO REMAIN AS ADMINISTRATOR? 

457
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,052
>> CERTAINLY WE HAVE SOME AREAS 

458
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,854
OF CONCERN AND SOME OF THESE 

459
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:02,187
ALLEGATIONS. 

460
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,389
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY PERSONNEL 

461
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,058
ANNOUNCEMENTS AT THIS POINT. 

462
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,861
>> MY SECOND QUESTION IS, 

463
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,096
CONGRESSMAN MARK SANFORD BLAMED 

464
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,566
THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET AS THE 

465
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,769
FINAL STRAW IN HIS DEFEAT, 

466
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,636
MAKING HIM THE SECOND 

467
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,104
REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBER TO GO 

468
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,138
DOWN IN DEFEAT. 

469
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,775
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN 48 

470
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,677
YEARS A SITTING PRESIDENT HAS 

471
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,979
OPPOSED A MEMBER OF CONGRESS OF 

472
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:27,679
HIS OWN PARTY. 

473
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,616
DOES THE PRESIDENT INTEND TO 

474
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:31,817
SPEAK OUT FOR PRIMARY 

475
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,485
CHALLENGES TO OTHER CRITICS OF 

476
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:34,620
HIM WITHIN THE CONGRESS? 

477
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,254
AND IF SO, WHO? 

478
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,723
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY 

479
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,457
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ANY CANDIDATES 

480
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,259
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY OR MAY 

481
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,327
NOT ENDORSE AND WOULDN'T BE 

482
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,795
ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT FROM THIS 

483
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,465
VENUE EITHER. 

484
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,199
>> SORRY. 

485
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:47,666
THAT'S RIGHT. 

486
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,602
I'LL COME BACK TO YOU. 

487
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,403
>> TWO QUESTIONS. 

488
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,838
FIRST, ON THE TWO IMMIGRATION 

489
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,340
BILLS THAT THE HOUSE IS 

490
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,674
CONSIDERING, DOES THE PRESIDENT 

491
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,176
HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR ONE OVER 

492
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,644
THE OTHER OR ARE BOTH JUST FINE 

493
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:58,911
WITH HIM? 

494
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,179
AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE. 

495
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,580
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY 

496
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,716
LAID OUT A PROPOSAL THAT CLOSES 

497
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,551
THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES AND 

498
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,886
PROVIDES THE RESOURCES TO 

499
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,920
SECURE OUR BORDER. 

500
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,487
IF THE PROCESS LEADS TO A 

501
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:10,256
EMERGENCY ROOM APPROXIMATE 

502
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,523
MENTAL SOLUTION AS OUTLINED BY 

503
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:13,826
THE PRESIDENT WE WOULD SUPPORT 

504
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:13,992
IT. 

505
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:15,660
>> HAS HE LOOKED AT IT. 

506
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,529
>> WE LAID OUT TO WHAT WE WANT 

507
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:17,863
TO SEE. 

508
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,432
IF IT LEADS TO A PERMANENT 

509
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,533
SOLUTION, WE WOULD SUPPORT. 

510
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:24,904
>> YOU BLAME THE DEMOCRATS FOR 

511
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:33,846
NOT CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES. 

512
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:34,580
REPUBLICANS CONTROL BOTH 

513
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:34,914
HOUSES. 

514
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,315
THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT. 

515
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,783
SO DON'T REPUBLICANS TAKE SOME 

516
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,651
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 

517
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,051
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 

518
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,653
>> IF A HANDFUL OF DEMOCRATS 

519
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,854
WANTED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, 

520
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,389
WE COULD QUICKLY GET IT DONE. 

521
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,022
BUT THEY DON'T. 

522
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,090
AND THEY HAVE REFUSE TODAY COME 

523
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,725
TO THE TABLE AND ACTUALLY BE 

524
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,294
PART OF A SOLUTION INSTEAD OF 

525
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,730
JUST PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES 

526
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,232
AND ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT? 

527
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED 

528
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,903
NUMEROUS TIMES TO GET RID OF 

529
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:58,971
THE FILIBUSTER. 

530
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,206
>> THERE ARE A MAJORITY OF 

531
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,007
REPUBLICAN SUPPORTING FIXING 

532
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:02,374
THE LOOPHOLES. 

533
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,209
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO LOOK AT 

534
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:04,409
THEM. 

535
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:05,344
WE LAID OUT A PROPOSE TOTAL TO 

536
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,080
DO THAT AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT 

537
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,580
CONGRESS, PARTICULARLY 

538
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,449
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WILL COME 

539
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,386
TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY FIX THE 

540
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:14,619
SYSTEM. 

541
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:15,186
>> SO REPUBLICANS TAKE TO 

542
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:16,155
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 

543
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:16,889
IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS AT THE 

544
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:17,122
BORDER. 

545
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,190
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO FIX 

546
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,356
IT. 

547
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,392
WE HAVE LAID OUT A NUMBER OF 

548
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,994
DIFFERENT PLANS AND PROPOSALS 

549
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,329
THAT WOULD CLOSE THESE 

550
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,631
LOOPHOLES AND WE CONTINUE TO BE 

551
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,466
READY AND WILLING TO WORK WITH 

552
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,134
CONGRESS TO GET IT DONE. 

553
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:29,635
>> TWO QUESTIONS. 

554
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,502
ON IMMIGRATION, WHAT DOES THE 

555
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,271
PRESIDENT WANT TO SEE THE HOUSE 

556
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,772
OF REPRESENTATIVES DO IN THE 

557
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,072
NEXT WEEK? 

558
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,407
>> AGAIN, WE HAVE LAID THAT 

559
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:35,607
OUT. 

560
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,776
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A 

561
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,678
PERMANENT SOLUTION TO FIX THE 

562
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,548
LOOPHOLES AND SECURE THE 

563
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:42,982
BORDER. 

564
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:43,549
>> ON DACA. 

565
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,883
JUST ON THE UPCOMING VOTES, IS 

566
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,485
THERE A PARTICULAR BILL THAT HE 

567
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:46,718
FAVORS. 

568
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,420
>> AGAIN, HE WANTS TO SEE ALL 

569
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,888
OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS 

570
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,958
THAT WE LAID OUT SEVERAL MONTHS 

571
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,325
AGO ADDRESSED. 

572
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,626
AND IF ANY OF THE LEGISLATION 

573
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,295
COMES TO THE TABLE THAT WOULD 

574
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,262
CREATE A PERMANENT SOLUTION 

575
00:14:57,262 --> 00:15:00,432
THAT DOES THAT, THEN WE WOULD 

576
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,533
SUPPORT IT. 

577
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,168
>> ON THAT, THE PRESIDENT'S 

578
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,636
THREAT OF TARIFFS, DOES THAT 

579
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:08,474
MEAN THAT HE WILL WITHDRAW FROM 

580
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:12,611
NAFTA IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 

581
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:12,811
DAYS. 

582
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,279
>> SEVERAL GOP LAWMAKERS TODAY 

583
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,882
HAVE CALLED FOR A SECOND 

584
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,282
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

585
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:19,551
WOULD THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT A 

586
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,619
DEVELOPED INQUIRY INTO THE 

587
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,854
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT AND 

588
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,355
THE FURTHER CONDUCT OF THE FBI 

589
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,724
OR DOES THIS SETTLE THE MATTER 

590
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,459
FOR ALL TIME. 

591
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,795
>> THIS CREATES A GREAT DEAL OF 

592
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:30,062
CONCERN. 

593
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,731
WE'RE GOING TO TUNE INTO THE 

594
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,298
DIRECTOR'S COMMENTS THIS 

595
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:33,598
AFTERNOON. 

596
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,667
CERTAINLY THERE ARE A LOT OF 

597
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,237
THINGS IN THE REPORT THAT NOT 

598
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:43,475
ONLY WORRY THOSE OF US IN THE 

599
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,843
ADMINISTRATION BUT SHOULD WORRY 

600
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,412
AMERICANS THAT IT WAS INJECTED 

601
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,946
INTO A DEPARTMENT THAT 

602
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,648
SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY BIAS. 

603
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,217
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE 

604
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,385
THAT PETER STRUCK SHOULD STILL 

605
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,987
HAVE A JOB AT THE FBI. 

606
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,021
>> I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM THAT 

607
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,222
QUESTION BUT I WOULD GUESS NO. 

608
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,758
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 

609
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:03,262
OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

610
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,930
THAT ARE REPORTEDLY EYEING THE 

611
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,463
EXITS INCLUDING YOURSELF. 

612
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:06,999
CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT 

613
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,533
TO EXPECT? 

614
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:09,268
ARE ANY OF THOSE OFFICIALS 

615
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,437
LEAVING AND WHAT IS THE PLAN TO 

616
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,237
REPLACE THE HIGH LEVEL PEOPLE. 

617
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,206
>> THERE IS NOT A NEED TO 

618
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:14,539
REPLACE THEM. 

619
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,008
AS I STATED LAST NIGHT IN A 

620
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,610
TWEET, I THINK CBS GOT A LITTLE 

621
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,344
AHEAD OF THEIR SKIS, 

622
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,413
PARTICULARLY SINCE THEY PUT OUT 

623
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,714
A STORY ABOUT MY THINKING 

624
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:23,916
WITHOUT EVER ACTUALLY TALKING 

625
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,482
TO ME. 

626
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:26,752
IT SEEMS IT WOULD BE A LITTLE 

627
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,420
PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF 

628
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,953
PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS. 

629
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:29,955
I DON'T HAVE ANY TO MAKE. 

630
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,224
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I SHOW UP 

631
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,125
HERE EVERY DAY. 

632
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:33,692
I LOVE MY JOB. 

633
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,861
I'M GLAD TO WORK FOR THE 

634
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:36,161
PRESIDENT. 

635
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,796
AND EACH AND EVERY DAY I'LL 

636
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,997
PRAY FOR CLARITY AND 

637
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,466
DISCERNMENT ON WHAT MY FUTURE 

638
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:40,766
LOOKS LIKE. 

639
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,534
RIGHT NOW I THINK THE COUNTRY 

640
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,635
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD AND I'M GLAD 

641
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,237
TO BE A PART OF THAT PROCESS 

642
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,739
AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO 

643
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:48,207
MY JOB. 

644
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,377
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 

645
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,377
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 

646
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:53,344
>> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS PRESS 

647
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:55,781
SECRETARY THERE SAYING SHE IS 

648
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,515
PRAYING FOR CLARITY AND 

649
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,017
DISCERNMENT AS SHE DETERMINES 

650
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,352
HER FUTURE THERE BUT WOULDN'T 

651
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,987
FOLLOW UP ON THE REPORTS THAT 

652
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,455
CBS HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT SHE 

653
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,358
AND HER COLLEAGUE RAJ SHAH MAY 

654
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,595
BE HEADING FOR THE EXIT DOORS 

655
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:09,795
SOON. 

656
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,163
BUT THE BIG REALLY OVERARCHING 

657
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,763
STORY TODAY IS THE INSPECTOR 

658
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,898
GENERAL'S REPORT THAT WAS 

659
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,300
RELEASED CONDEMNING THE FBI AND 

660
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,637
THE WAY THAT FORMER FBI 

661
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,938
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY HANDLED 

662
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:20,338
THE CLINTON CASE. 

663
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,340
THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

664
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,007
TAKEN ON IMMIGRATION. 

665
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,077
THE PRESS SECRETARY SAYING THE 

666
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:25,844
PRESIDENT WANTS A PERMANENT 

667
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,378
SOLUTION ON IMMIGRATION AND THE 

668
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:27,878
CRISIS THERE. 

669
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,249
BUT REALLY THE BIG FOCUS TODAY 

670
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,785
IS EXACTLY HOW THE INSPECTOR 

671
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:34,552
GENERAL'S REPORT WAS RECEIVED. 

672
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:38,257
IT REAFFIRMED SHE SAYS, SARAH 

673
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,458
HUCKABEE SANDERS, THE 

674
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,026
PRESIDENT'S SUSPICIONS ABOUT 

675
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,327
COMEY'S CONDUCT AND THE 

676
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,030
POLITICAL BIAS OF THE FBI. 

677
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,131
THAT WAS THEIR TAKE-AWAY. 

678
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,266
WE'RE FOLLOWING JAMES COMEY WHO 

679
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:49,201
RELEASED AN OPINION REPORT A 

680
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,736
SHORT TIME AGO ON THE NEW YORK 

681
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,905
TIMES SAYING THIS REPORT, THE 

682
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,739
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT WAS 

683
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,243
WRONG BUT IT WAS GOOD FOR THE 

684
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:58,744
FBI. 

685
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,812
PAUL A I WANT TO BRING -- I 

686
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,147
WANT TO BRING IN PAULA REID. 

687
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,483
I WANT TO START OFF WITH THE 

688
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,050
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT. 

689
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,553
GIVE US A SENSE OF RECAPPING 

690
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,820
THE WHITE HOUSE'S POSITION AND 

691
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,389
WERE YOU SURPRISED BY THEIR 

692
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:10,789
TAKE TODAY. 

693
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,023
>> NO. 

694
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,293
THEY TRIED TO ARGUE THIS REPORT 

695
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:14,993
VINDICATED THE PRESIDENT'S 

696
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:15,794
CONCERNS ABOUT CERTAIN PEOPLE 

697
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,497
WITHIN THE FBI AND HOW THEY 

698
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,098
HANDLE THE BOTH THE 

699
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,165
INVESTIGATION OF THE PRIVATE E-

700
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:24,636
MAIL SERVER OF HILLARY CLINTON 

701
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,838
AND THE ORIGINS OF THE RUSSIA 

702
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:27,139
PROBE. 

703
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:27,539
THAT IS NOT TRUE. 

704
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,541
THE PRESIDENT HAS CLAIMED THAT 

705
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,542
THE INVESTIGATION WAS BOTCHED 

706
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,644
OR RIGGED BUT THE OFFICE OF THE 

707
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,779
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT 

708
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,148
BIAS DID NOT IMPACT THE CLINTON 

709
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:36,515
INVESTIGATION. 

710
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,216
THAT HER INTERVIEW BY THE FBI 

711
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,484
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 

712
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:40,219
ATTORNEYS HAVE REPEATEDLY 

713
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,355
CRITICIZED THEY FOUND IT WAS 

714
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,225
APPROPRIATE AND THERE WAS TRULY 

715
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,493
NO MR.IBLE CASE AGAINST HER. 

716
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:53,632
THE WHITE HOUSE'S SPIN TODAY IS 

717
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:59,805
THAT THE OIG REPORTS VIN DID I 

718
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,674
RATES THE PRESIDENT -- 

719
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,241
VINDICATES THE PRESIDENT'S 

720
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,544
POSITION BUT IT IS THE 

721
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:05,811
OPPOSITE. 

722
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,412
>> THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

723
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,781
CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM 

724
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,716
THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER. 

725
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:13,151
A REPORTER PRESSED HER ON 

726
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:13,718
SAYING YOU'RE A PARENT. 

727
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:15,320
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS. 

728
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,155
THIS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION 

729
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,156
WE'RE TRYING TO GET AND SARAH 

730
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,658
HUCKABEE SANDERS SAYING THE 

731
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,260
PRESIDENT IS JUST ENFORCING THE 

732
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,926
LAW OF THE COUNTRY. 

733
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,129
FIRST AVENUE, IS IT THE LAW OF 

734
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,230
THE COUNTRY TO SEPARATE AND 

735
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,698
WHAT DID YOU MAKE ON HER 

736
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,899
RESPONSE ON IMMIGRATION TODAY. 

737
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:28,499
>> LET'S BE CLEAR. 

738
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,035
THE LAW OF THE LAND DOES NOT 

739
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:30,869
REQUIRE THAT YOU SEPARATE 

740
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,038
PARENTS AND CHILDREN AT THE 

741
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:33,271
BORDER. 

742
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:34,506
THE CHANGE THAT HAS BEEN MADE 

743
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,807
BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS 

744
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,410
THAT THEY HAVE DECIDED THEY ARE 

745
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,911
GOING TO PROSECUTE EVERYONE WHO 

746
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:41,146
IS APPREHENDED BY THE 

747
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,380
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

748
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,216
THAT CROSSES THE BORDER I 

749
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:44,449
WILLLY. 

750
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,652
WHEN YOU PROSECUTE ANYONE IN 

751
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,953
THIS COUNTRY, YOU ARE SEPARATED 

752
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:48,619
FROM YOUR CHILDREN. 

753
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,689
THAT IS A POLICY CHANGE THAT 

754
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,592
THE ADMINISTRATION MADE BACK IN 

755
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,092
APRIL. 

756
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,827
BEFORE THAT, THESE ILLEGAL 

757
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:59,131
BORDER CROSSINGS WERE TYPICALLY 

758
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,364
HANDLED AS CIVIL MATTERS. 

759
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,167
YOU WERE CITED AND GIVEN A 

760
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,568
COURT DATE AND SOMETIMES YOU 

761
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:03,935
WERE DETAINED. 

762
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,305
THERE WAS A CHANGE HOW THE 

763
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,071
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION APPROACHED 

764
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:07,271
THIS. 

765
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:08,507
THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY THEY ARE 

766
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,208
ENFORCING THE LAW AND THIS IS 

767
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,276
THE FAULT OF THE DEMOCRATS. 

768
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,245
WHAT REPORTERS WERE TRYING TO 

769
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,646
GET AT, DOES THE ADMINISTRATION 

770
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,081
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS OWN 

771
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,016
POLICY AND WHAT THIS IS DOING 

772
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,951
TO FAMILIES AT THE BORDER? 

773
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:20,919
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 

774
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,621
SECURITY CHIEF HAS SAID ON THE 

775
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,790
RECORD THEY ARE DOING THIS AS A 

776
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,359
DETERRENT TO DETER PEOPLE FROM 

777
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,059
COMING HERE ILLEGALLY. 

778
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:31,430
AGAIN THERE, HAVE NOTHING 

779
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,363
ILLEGAL ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE 

780
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:32,597
DOING. 

781
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:33,799
IT SEEMS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

782
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,066
DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE 

783
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,468
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EFFECT 

784
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:36,968
OF THIS POLICY CHANGE. 

785
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,737
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO 

786
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:38,970
GET AT. 

787
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,871
SOMEONE TRIED TO PLAY ON THE 

788
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,806
FACT THAT SARAH HUCKABEE 

789
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,806
SANDERS IS A MOTHER. 

790
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,875
DO YOU HAVE ANY EMPATHY, DO YOU 

791
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,978
HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS 

792
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:47,211
POLICY? 

793
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:47,645
SHE WASN'T BITING. 

794
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:49,247
SHE KEPT FALLING BACK ON THE 

795
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,082
TALKING POINTS WHICH THIS IS 

796
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,184
THE LAW OF THE LAND AND THEY 

797
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,186
WILL ENFORCE IT UNTIL DEMOCRATS 

798
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,420
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 

799
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,989
THIS IS A POLICY DECISION BY 

800
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,624
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO 

801
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,126
APPROACH ILLEGAL BORDER 

802
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,127
CROSSINGS AS CRIMINAL MATTERS. 

803
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,362
NOW A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS 

804
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,329
WILL BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 

805
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,264
THEY BELIEVE THAT IS A CRIME 

806
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,066
THAT NEEDS TO BE PROSECUTED. 

807
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,201
SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTY 

808
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,335
WITH THE MORALITY OF SEPARATING 

809
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,670
PARENTS FROM THEIR CHILDREN. 

810
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,407
>> I WANT TO ALSO ASK YOU, SHE 

811
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,708
CAME FORWARD ABOUT EPA SCOTT 

812
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,111
PRUITT WHO HAS A HOST OF 

813
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:19,644
ALLEGATIONS AROUND HIM. 

814
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,080
SHE SAID THEY MAY HAVE 

815
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,347
CONCERNS. 

816
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,615
IS THAT A CHANGE FROM THE WHITE 

817
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:23,948
HOUSE'S TAKE? 

818
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,116
WHAT DID YOU TAKE FROM THAT. 

819
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:27,486
>> I WOULD DESCRIBE THAT AS A 

820
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,056
MICRO CHANGE, A MICRO MOVEMENT 

821
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,290
IN THEIR HISTORICALLY PRETTY 

822
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,593
ROBUST DEFENSE OF THE EPA 

823
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:34,826
CHIEF. 

824
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,829
HE HAS A LAUNDRY LIST OF 

825
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:38,262
INVESTIGATIONS AND 

826
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:38,629
CONTROVERSIES. 

827
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:39,398
THE GENERAL QUESTION IS WHAT 

828
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,732
DOES IT TAKE TO GET FIRED. 

829
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,902
SO FAR THEY SAY THEY HAVE NO 

830
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:44,603
PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS BUT 

831
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,871
THEY SEEM TO BE MOVING, EVEN 

832
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,205
JUST A LITTLE BIT, TO BE 

833
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,173
CONCERNED ABOUT THE THINGS 

834
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,174
RAISED ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR. 

835
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,110
>> SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT CBS'S 

836
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,913
ORIGINAL REPORTING LAST NIGHT 

837
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,149
THAT SHE MAY AND HER COLLEAGUE 

838
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,584
MAY BE LEAVING AT SOME POINT. 

839
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,351
SHE DIDN'T DENY IT. 

840
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:03,120
>> SHE DID NOT DENY IT. 

841
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,723
SHE TOOK SOME CHEAP SHOTS AT 

842
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,191
OUR COLLEAGUE WHO BROKE THAT 

843
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,825
STORY WHO HAD THAT SCOOP. 

844
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,327
SHE TRIED TO SUGGEST THAT SHE 

845
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,930
WAS OUT OVER HER SKIS BUT SHE 

846
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,097
DID NOT DENY IT. 

847
00:22:13,097 --> 00:00:00,000
SHE S
