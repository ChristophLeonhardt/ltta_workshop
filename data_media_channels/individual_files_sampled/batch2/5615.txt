clearly this looks like a boilerplate from columbine which some of these shooters have done you know you have a trench coat arms and the guns maybe another actor with the fatigue pain actor so you know you do have some echoes of that and some of these guys let's bet on you know prior killers so I think you might have a little boilerplate actions of obsession there the fire alarm the trench phone you know the bombs all that could be there and you've got a great discussion with the fellows there I have some great points and I think you're right on every occasion your infamy drives so many things watching this they want to be the person who kills the most that drives some of it and we got to be conscious of that so you know I like to see the killer's name on the charging documents and you know just for the law enforcement to get what they need agree that you know these are keep harping on who they are I tend to just call them the killer the loser I don't really want to hear their name anymore
