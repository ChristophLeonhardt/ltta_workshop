so over the last few years I've become convinced that there is something or someone in the spiritual world who can be usefully referred to as the devil and what I mean by that is I think there is a conscious force in the spiritual realm that underlies physical life a conscious force that is advocating for evil in the world and evils handmaiden slavery as opposed to God who is the source of human freedom and the good now I don't think that Satan is some red guy with horns and a tail and cloven hooves anymore that I think that God is an old man with a long white beard these are images we use to focus our minds and yes because of the site-based prejudice of our evolved bodies we sometimes let these images override the unseeable spiritual truth which is harder to imagine all the same I find that if I assume there is a devil life becomes more predictable and my view of life becomes more realistic and that's a kind of evidence when a mathematical equation correctly predicts physical events like the path that light will take over a long distance that's evidence that the equation is true and in the same way when a same person's spiritual observations allow him to accurately predict and explain human behavior that's evidence that is spiritual conjectures bear some relation to the actual spiritual truth and we know I'm a sane man because I've been insane and I can tell the difference so one of the things I've observed about the devil is that he's very good at turning the victims of evil into the servants of evil it's one of his favorite tricks the victims of child abuse become child abusers the victims of racial hatred become hateful racists the victims of violence become violent and turn and so on because he's a spiritual creature Satan doesn't care who does the hating as long as the hating gets done now we've been talking all week about ideas versus the idea of identity and silence versus truth speakin leftism which is a distorted slave philosophy of racism and sexism and hatred loves to jump on true ideas and brand them according to leftist categories to call them racist and sexist or hateful in order to bully truth-tellers into silence so for instance I oppose modern feminism because feminism opposes femininity which i think is a great human good that helps complement and balance masculinity and helps preserve some of our most important values through the generations and so I get accused of looking down on women and not believing they should have equal rights and free choices which is absolutely untrue I think women generally speaking are different from men and will choose and live different lives and I celebrate that but I also believe they have the same individual rights and a range of individual variations and freedom of choice the same freedom of choice that men have I oppose racism because I know that every person is created in the image of his creator and that we honor our Creator by honoring his image in mankind so when I say there's high crime in black neighborhoods which is true or that Haiti is a hellhole which is true I'm not saying that's because of the color of the people there it's because of ideas and culture and corruption a lot of which by the way have been sold to the poor and powerless in those places by the rich and powerful of all different colors now many of these ideas of spirituality truth and love have been developed and preserved through the years by white men and I'm grateful to white men for doing that and I won't waste time honoring bad ideas simply because they come from some minority or women but I don't think it's the whiteness of the men that gave them their ideas I think history moves in all kinds of mysterious ways and in the end it's only the ideas that matter let me show you what I mean using the little book I like to call the Bible because that's it's named after the fall of man God chose to re-enter the world through the Jews and God loved the Jews for carrying that burden which obviously wasn't easy but just before Jesus showed up on the scene John the Baptist a Jew came to his fellow Jews and said to them listen don't be so proud of being Jews because God can make Jews out of the stones on the ground in other words he was saying it's not your race that makes you great it's the truth you've been allowed to carry oh and by the way here comes Jesus to spread that truth to all the races of the world we Americans or Westerners if you like likewise have been granted the privilege of carrying a great truth to the world the essentially Christian truth that individuals have dignity and equality of rights but God can make Westerners out of the stones on the ground and happily over the last 200 or so years those truths have been spreading to all kinds of people around the world now as always it's an open question whether those ideas will keep spreading right now it's Islamic extremism and hateful leftism that oppose them so I'm going to stand on the side of those truths whether my opponent happens to be a black man or a nasty woman or a white guy who thinks it's his skin color that makes him ever so special to my mind those who speak for hatred and slavery whether they're white supremacists or black lives matter bigots those who speak against our rights whether it's a homosexual thug persecuting a Christian Baker or an Islamic thug persecuting a gay man and all those who try to silence debate whether they're leftists or other leftist all these have got the wrong ideas the right ideas individual freedom equality of rights and love of each other and love of a loving God who is our Creator and the source of every good thing right ideas must be defended fearlessly so that we can chase the devil back to his safe space which is hell trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we also sing see Topsy the Zipit easing its hooray Harada lash or the way these weeks go by so fast Henry Olson is here today

and some of those precious tears will spill you know one of the things I really do believe is we can tell we can sort of tell who the good guys are by who is spreading information and who is trying to keep information from the public and today I just was watching the way everybody is reacting to this FBI story now I have not made up my mind about exactly what is happening to the FBI and I have absolutely no doubt that there are Republicans who are seizing on suspicious stuff at the FBI to try and hamper Bob Muller robert muller in his investigation of the make-believe russian thing I mean the make-believe Russia I think it now seems that Robert Muller is investigating obstruction of justice without having proved that there's actually a crime to obstruct which apparently is legal apparently you can accuse somebody of obstructing justice without their actually being a crime to obstruct but it just seems ridiculous to me at this point on the other hand he does seem to be moving forward very quickly he's made overtures to the President himself who I assume will be the last guy that he would do it but who he would talk to before coming to a conclusion but Andy McCarthy over at National Review has been talking about this and he's just you know he's a former federal prosecutor so he has really good insights in this and he points out the fact that I have said something like this but he has done it in a much more informed way he points out the fact that Obama is the head of the snake here the guy who would have been responsible for instanced for ditching the Hillary Clinton investigation would not have been the FBI and would haven't been Peter struck it would have ultimately been Obama and he says you know he's talking about the fact that in the Peter struck emails with his mistress Lisa page they were having this adulterous affair which I noticed everybody nobody in the mainstream media talks about that was why they were sending back these text messages back and forth they pointed out that blandly sinister Attorney General Loretta Lynch did know in spite of what Comey had told Congress that Lynch did know that Call Me was going to clear Hillary and when she met with Bill Clinton on the tarmac and that famous meeting she knew that and she was basically passing that on that you were on the in the clear that we don't know that but that's what it looks like right now so all this leads back to Obama and here's Andy McCarthy talking about this at National Review he says after the New York Times broke the story that Hillary Clinton had this secret email server just after the New York Times broke the news about Clinton's email this is the State Department John Podesta obviously atop Obama adviser and Clinton's campaign chairman emailed Cheryl Mills Clinton's confidant and top aide in the Obama State Department to suggest that Clinton's emails to and from the President Obama should be held not disclosed because of executive privilege which is really interesting in and of itself but at the time the House Committee investigating the Benghazi jihadist attack was pressing for production of Clinton's emails and as his counselors grappled with how to address his own involvement in Clinton's misconduct Obama went on CBS and gave the following interview we have this this cut Hillary Clinton use an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State at the same time everybody else learned it through news reports were you disappointed let me just say that Hillary Clinton is and has been an outstanding public servant she was a great Secretary of State for me the policy of my administration is to encourage transparency and that's why my emails for blackberry that I carry around all those records are available and archived and I'm glad that Hillary is instructed that those emails that had to do with official business need to be disclosed well you say that you have the most transparent administration every said it again just a couple of weeks ago how does this square with that well the I I think that the fact that she's going to be putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need so he didn't hear about this through until it came out in the press but we know this to be a lie because under a pseudonym he had sent almost 20 emails to Hillary Clinton on her secret server so right after the interview aired now I'm reading Andrew McCarthy again at National Review Clinton campaign secretary Josh Sherwin email Jennifer Palmieri and other senior campaign staffers stating Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out Hillary Clinton was using her personal email when he saw it on the news Sherwin's alert was forwarded to mill shortly afterwards and agitated Mills emailed Podesta we need to clean this up Obama has emails from Clinton they do not that do not say state gov have they don't have the mailing order on it so listen all I'm saying about this I don't know what happened and Obama was a master at going on TV and basically giving instructions to his underlings on TV basically because he went on to say remember she had no intent so she wasn't doing anything criminal that was what Obama said on TV and then of course that was what how Peter struck the guy who writes these text messages that was how he rewrote commis statement about hillary clinton that she had no intent and therefore it wasn't criminal which isn't legally true so all of this stuff is just to say look i don't know what happened yet and it but it does it does stink it smells bad in any reporter any real news reporter would do what we saw Bret Baier do yesterday was whoa whoa just just about run this by me again what's going on we send people that they would send people to ask questions listen to the way the mainstream media by which I mean the networks play this ABC didn't cover it for three days CBS and NBC did cover it but this is how they cover this is cut number 6 as Muller's investigation moves along the campaign to undermine him is also moving full steam ahead Republicans are seizing on the revelation that the FBI failed to preserve many text messages during a critical five month period during a Russia investigation Senator Chuck Schumer says the focus on text messages is an attempt to divert attention away from the Moller investigation and as the Russia investigation gets closer to the president he is escalating his fight with the FBI specifically over some missing text messages between two former members of the Special Counsel Robert Muller steam so are the missing text messages from December 2016 to May 2017 really a bombshell Democrats call the GOP attacks desperation so she said I love that one where she says as the investigation gets closer to the president we don't know that you know we don't know whether it's getting closer to the president any meaningful way except that he wants to interview him and and then you know the president ups his feud with the FBI which is also not true the president's been actually kind of quiet about this though he has pointed out some of this and so and trey Gowdy has been very fair trade gaudy has never attacked robert muller but he says he wants to know what's in this and you would think Shearer reportorial intellectual curiosity would move these guys to want to know I just want to compare that which was essentially cover-up that was just running interference for the Democrats and the FBI that was ABC and CBS 2 a that was a CBS and NBC doing an ABC did the same thing after a silence of three days when a compare that to Donald Trump and listen Donald Trump has said dumb stuff you know stuff about Obama's birth certificate even he says he didn't believe that at the time but but he did say it he said all that stuff about Ted Cruz's father he says he has said things that have lowered his credibility and made it seem like he doesn't care whether he's speaking the truth or not but he has also been incredibly open and transparent he will stand in front of the press anytime and yesterday he walked into a background meeting surprising the press and they started peppering him with questions about whether he would talk to Robert Muller if Robert Muller wanted to talk to him so I just want to play this because it is it is really it's only audible it's only audio I think but it really is hilarity you know trumpet is most hilariously Trumpy as he talks about this play cut one first I'm looking forward to what so ever there's no obstruction whatsoever and I'm looking forward to it I do worry when I look at all of the things that you people don't report about with what's happening if you take a look at you know the five months worth of missing texts that's a lot of missing texts and as I said yesterday that's prime time so you do sort of look at that and say what's going on you do look at certain texts where they talk about insurance policies or insurance where they say the kinds of things they're saying be concerned but I would love to do that I'd like to do it as soon as possible so he's ready to talk I wouldn't talk to Robert Muller by the way because anything you slip up anything you mistake you can be accused of perjury you can be accused of lying to the FBI you talk to him under oath Trump said he talked to him under oath if his lawyers would let him if I was a lawyer I wouldn't let him because even if you slip up you're the president if they're out to get you they can make it look like perjury but we're gonna go to Henry Olsen just one minute I just want to play one other thing because it is Trump again at his hilariously Trump is making fun of the press because they will not they will not point out that Hillary spoke completely without you nobody took any notes nobody swore her in and the press says I don't know what happened I wasn't there and this is I believe I don't know like I don't know what happened but he is acting like a man with nothing to hide and he is running rings around the press who are doing everything because they are doing everything to hide the fact that the Obama administration which we do know we do know this the Obama administration was a corrupt administration that basically ran the federal government like the Chicago city government Henry Olson is a senior fellow at the ethics and Public Policy Center think tank in Washington DC his pre-election predictions of 2008 2010 2012 2014 were praised for their remarkable accuracy is 2016 predictions which was a black swan were more actual accurate than virtually any other major analyst or commentator he writes regularly for American greatness and his latest book is the working class Republican Ronald Reagan and the return of blue-collar conservatives conservatism obviously can find it on amazon.com he is one of my favorite observers of elections have we got there he is you know I haven't got him on the screen in front of me there you go but at least I can hear you how you doing it's good to see you I'm good to see you I'm doing great how about you I'm doing very well thank you it's been one of the most interesting political years I can remember so it's have been so much fun to actually get to comment on it so let's start with the book again Ronald Reagan and the return of blue-collar conservatism you save it in the book the Trump has recaptured Reagan's magic and you're not uncritical of trumpet let's start with that how is that true how is it true the Trump is recaptured Reagan's madly yeah what Reagan's magic was was talking about the average person of America and putting their hopes their fears their desires their lives at the center of his politics he wasn't talking about helping them by helping other people like helping entrepreneurs or job creators he spoke directly to them and that's what Trump does had his best is that when Trump was running he was focusing on the average person who felt that they had gotten a raw deal from both parties over the past two decades and he said I'm gonna bring you back I'm the person who's understand you I'm the person who's gonna put you at the center of my politics and that meant that he was the first person since Reagan to carry areas that are dominated by that sort of person the five states in the Midwest that everybody but a couple of us were shocked that he ended up carrying because he was able to talk to them in a way that no Republican since Reagan had and that is a very different and the kind of Reagan mythology was that he supported the trickle-down idea that he was going to help the corporations and the corporation's would help people but that was really imposed on him that was not the way he talked to people and he always supported the kind of safety net that keeps you know middle-class people from falling into the under glasses you always supported that right right now he always supported it in fact during his presidency he expanded in some ways he increased taxes in a couple of ways in order to support the existing programs particularly his 1983 Social Security deal which can 36 years 35 years later is still the deal that has financed our basic retirement program Reagan always talked about workers he always talked about the average person he always rejected even in his autobiography in 1989 in American Life he rejected efforts to paint him as a supply-side he said that he never fully understood what it was and exactly what all greet all their tenants and then he returned to the fact that he had been saying many things to supply siders embrace decades before they ever went to college and then we're talking about your book the working-class Republican Ronald Reagan and the return of blue-collar conservatism available on Amazon you then say that some of trumps policies are actually the opposite of Reagan's what what do you mean well you know that when Trump is talking about eliminating and things like NAFTA you know Reagan was a free trader but a fair trader and Reagan actually came up with the idea that became NAFTA when Reagan announced his presidential campaign in 1980 he talked about creating what he called a common market between Canada America and Mexico nobody had proposed it before Ronald Reagan so when Trump focuses on tariffs and protectionism he takes a Reaganesque insight which is that the economy has to work for all people and takes it to an extreme that Reagan would never have taken that - ok ok on the immigration front let's leave Reagan out of it because things change over time but you know Trump Trump seems to be saying as far as I can make out what Trump is saying at this point he seems to be saying you know he's going to let the dreamers stay but he really wants high security which was represented by this wall and into chain migration and into lotteries for diversity right it seems to me that he is standing right where the core of the American public is standing and that that yeah basically our elites don't stand there is that is that a fair I think that's a very yeah I mean that if you were to take the center of American public opinion it would be don't give the people who stay here citizenship but let them have legal residence don't deport them but make sure that this doesn't happen again which is to say have real border security have real employment security and make sure that the people who come here want to contribute and not live off the welfare or the social safety net and that's what ending chain migration is about is that rather than bringing in grandma grandpa and your uncle people who maybe 68 and require social support make sure that the people who are legally allowed to come here or people who can produce for the American economy on the basis of their skills and their works out and not simply have one person's ability to come here create ten legal rights to come here whether or not those people do want to or can produce for the American Society so so if companies got that right if he's got the people right on this one what obviously you can't speak for them but what in your opinion are guys like Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake and Victor what are they talking about why are they taking this position I think it's different for different people that the ideological libertarian position which is where Jeff Flake has always been is basically open borders is one that says that citizenship doesn't matter we shouldn't look to somebody coming from our country any differently than somebody who's already there so for Jeff Flake he's just acting as an ideologue for the Democratic Party you have the political desire to have open borders which is say they believe it's in their political advantage to continue to have less skilled migration come into the country and to have more and more people who are not necessarily immediately acclimatized to the American point of view so you have different reasons that coalesce around a similar policy perspective okay before we talk about the midterms I just wanted to get your assessment of Trump's first year I mean I I feel there seems to be this division between Trump the person and and the fact of his accomplishments which seem to be conservative accomplishments that any normal conservative could appreciate and they seem out there seem to be a lot of them how do you feel the first year is gone for him I think the first year economically has been pretty much what you would expect from the intersection between a Cruz and a Jeb Bush administration it's been definitely right-of-center it's been definitely Orthodox Republican most of the stuff that scared people has was not done on the foreign policy again despite a style of diplomacy I doubt that Cruz would have called Kim Jong is being both tough but willing to negotiate and we're still nado we're still upholding our commitments so even on foreign policy it hasn't been that much different it's been strangely conventional yeah now the only thing that has been unconventional is just this form of communication certainly the Twitter stuff do you think electorally is that hurting him or helping him it's largely been hurting him you think saying got that yeah I mean I don't think the use of Twitter is a bad thing and I don't think going after the media as long as it's done in the way that he in the clips that you just aired yes but what he's been doing is fighting battles he didn't need to fight and picking on people that are really either beneath the dignity of the President or doing it in a way that's beneath the dignity of the president and that's been hurting him now if he were to go through a year where he didn't comment on Mika Brzezinski alleged faceless or taking issue yeah basketball players father for not being grateful enough you might very well see people focus more on the accomplishments and on the personality but so far I think Twitter is the major reason why he's at a forty percent approval rating as opposed to a forty five or forty eight percent of Wow Wow you know Dan Henninger wrote a column I think was last week at The Wall Street Journal where he said that the resistance the strategy of the resistance now comes clear as the midterms joven to site basically and the strategy is make him so personally hateful that people will ignore his accomplishments and vote against him for that reason in your opinion looking forward is that working right now it is working right now that if I were gonna look at the midterm right now I would say it's gonna be a very good year for the Democrats that the only question is the degree of gain I'd say it's 50/50 if they win the house but even if they don't do be such a narrow majority for the Republicans that it would be difficult to pass anything meaningful they would lose Republicans would lose a number of the governorships in blue or purple states that they hold right now and the historic opportunity to gain 5 6 7 Senate seats which is the what is presented with with a highly favorable map would be frittered away so that maybe they gain a seat or two but you know gaining a seat or two when you're fighting on nine Democrat ELLs states that Donald Trump will on would be considered a massive defeat it is there still time to change that there is but I think it mainly has to come from the president that it's going to be extremely difficult for Republicans in Congress to run apart from the president in part because the president dominates the agenda and secondly because of our extreme partisanship that a lot of Democrats tried to run away from Obama but even Democrats who opposed Obamacare got swept up in the 2010 tide because it didn't matter that they had voted no it was the party they wanted to punish if Donald Trump can focus less on division and more on things that bring people together and he can communicate in a more presidential manner he can get his approval rating up into the mid-40s as opposed to thirty nine forty percent yeah well then I think it could be actually a fairly decent midterm you know single digit losses in the house four or five Senate seat gain holding your own and governorships that would be considered a victory because president's almost always do poorly in their first midterm the only question is the degree if it's just a historic mild loss that would be a massive win for the president so that's right you're essentially confirming what some some never Trump errs or whatever you want to call them some of the conservative anti Trump errs have said that the the president is is maybe doing good things now but long term he is hurting himself simply by being himself is that is that fair well there's elements of himself that help him a lot that if the president you know the sort of things that you just played that his banter with the press has not annoyed people it's the stuff where he's unduly personal where he's unduly picking on people who don't deserve to be picked on and doing it in ways that are frankly crude and if the president can't talk frankly and honestly like a normal person and show anger when it's appropriate but not be mean and vindictive that's a different person and that I think would work in his favor but that's not what we saw in 2017 yeah yeah yeah if they if the Democrats were in the house do you think they'll actually go for impeachment yeah I do do you think yeah I I go for a Pietschmann I think that articles will be filed and they will begin to have hearings because it is in it will satisfy their base and it's in their narrow political interest to continue to do it whether they will pass those articles out is another matter but I do think that they will file articles and Nancy Pelosi will give an authorization to have impeachment hearings because it keeps the focus on the personality of the president which is what they want to do going into 2020 uh-huh one of the things that Reagan said I remember after I can't remember where was one of the elections when the Democrats won he said don't worry because they can't help but govern from the left and they'll destroy themselves do you think do you think that oh I know this is a long-term question and I'm only asking you to speculate now I will not hold you to it but do you think that a a win of the house for the Democrats may actually keep Trump in power for another term oh yeah absolutely look the reason Donald Trump is in office is because about twenty percent of Americans didn't like either he or Hillary Clinton and they waited till the end but they decided that they would rather have Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton and the $64,000 question for Democrats is was that because of Hillary's personality or is that because of Hillary's policies that's essentially the question that Republicans have had to face you know they their answer to Mitt Romney was it was the man not the message and then everyone who carried ran on the Romney message lost a Donald Trump in the primaries because guess what it was the message not the person and I think the same thing I think the same thing is true with the Democrats is that if they nominated somebody else who was basically on the Clinton platform but not Hillary Clinton that they would find exactly the same thing happened to them has happened to the Republicans after 2012 Wow I gotta say Henry every time I talk to you about this every time I read your

trust as a doctor he's treating these what guy admires these are essentially little girls these are teenagers teenage girls who have worked so hard to get to the Olympics there are dedicated athletes there representing America there their girls is in like I said like 13 years old we have worked so hard and he is the athletic doctor for the u.s. Olympic team and under the guise of helping them he is molesting them and he's doing this for years and years and there's hundreds of them and it you know it is basically what's its monstrous its monstrous I know it you don't even want to go for all the words because they're they're meaningless against the level of evil so he and he he basically cut a deal where he pled guilty and all the women stood up now now they're women they stood up and told their stories so they had a chance to voice what had happened to them and tell what had happened to them and at the end of this judge Rose Marie a Kalina I believe it's pronounced acceptable Authority pronouncing a Kalina she sentenced him to 40 40 to 175 years in prison and this clown Nasser gives her a document and she made a big show of it that's what I'm getting at she made a big show other thing that Nasser gave her a document where basically he kind of whined and said well I pled guilty because I had to and you know there's what was a hell hath no fury women as a woman scorned I mean this is what he's talking about these little girls that he molested hell has no and so the judge took this document and threw it away and then read this guy the riot act and it's caused a controversy here's is a kind of a little series of clips where she basically says well let let her say I'm a judge who believes in life and rehabilitation when rehabilitate as possible I have many defendants come back here and show you great things they've done in their lives after probation after parole I don't find that's possible with you your decision to assault was precise calculated manipulative devious despicable I don't have AdWords because you're survivors have said all of that I don't want to repeat it sir I'm giving you 175 years which is 2100 months I just find yourself orange I I need everyone to be quiet I sell temple powers I told you I'm not nice so you know you couldn't it's kind of hard to hear is not the greatest audio but she was basically saying I'm signing your death warrant your irredeemable you cannot be redeemed and you know almost making she took the paper that he sent her and just threw it away and so the left of course went into paroxysms of delight at this about the female judge standing up for the females and it was kind of like part of this me to stuff it was just like a too much of a it was too good to resist and so the right in kind of reactionary mode came out and said that she had even though of course they agreed with the fact that the guy should be put away for life he is evil saying that but she had disgraced herself by basically playing to the cameras and saying he was irredeemable no one's irredeemable and and gleefully saying I've signed your death sentence and the right was attacking and I have to say that on this one I got to go with the left more than that there's a long long tradition of judges after the trial is done after they all everything has been handled in the proper way ripping into evildoers and letting them know what they think and letting them know why they're being sent away and I think she was right in the mainstream of that judicial tradition she had every right you might have thought you went too far maybe she was playing to the cameras very possible but the idea you know with all the things we have to think about the that this monster got slapped it's not I'm not even all these a minute sleep over that and I think the right maybe overreacted to the left Glee you know I'm not saying she's a movie star I'm not saying you know it's the greatest judge ever I'm just saying like you know judges ripped these guys because they're evil they're evil and they're speaking for our society and they're letting the society know that no we do not accept this goodbye so long nice to know you're out of here and I you know I was totally on her side in this one stuff I like I you know usually with stuff I like I like to talk about cultural things books novels TV shows movies and like music but I read this book that I finished my son-in-law gave me this for Christmas and I read it I finished it over the weekend it's called the strange death of Europe immigration identity Islam by Douglas Murray now I think Rob but we haven't Douglas long as he come on we haven't scheduled him yet okay he's gonna come on next month probably and so we'll get to talk to him about it but I highly highly recommend this book it is brave book Douglas Murray is associate editor of The Spectator a British Conservative journal he writes frequently for a variety of other publications including the Sunday Times in The Wall Street Journal he's an experienced debater and has spoken at the British and European Parliament's and at the White House this book is about obviously immigration identity in Islam it's about a lot of the things I've been talking about this week some of them were just informed by the ideas in this book and the way he talks he talks without hatred and yet he talks with blunt brutal honesty about this policy since World War two of allowing Muslims to come sweeping into Europe even though the public didn't want it even though the public consistently said it didn't want it to happen and he talks the first half of the book I would say roughly is is it it's not easy reading as factual it's just telling the history and I think is worth reading it reading that part to get through it the second part where he starts to talk about the sense in Europe that maybe the European idea the Western idea is over is so moving and so intense and so well observe and honestly talked about he talks a little bit I think on one of our stuff I like I talked about Michelle we look back and his submission which is a wonderful wonderful novel which I highly recommend which talks about a lot of the same things and dramatized a lot of the same thing but there's one passage in here I want to talk about where he talks about the fact he talks as a lot of intellectuals were talking about you've heard me talk about this from a slightly different perspective a lot of intellectuals are talking about the death of Christianity the loss of Christianity has weakened the West and yet and yet intellectuals still can't believe and he talks about how he says it was in the 19th century it actually was well I guess it was at the very beginning of the 19th century when the romantics started to believe that yes God might not be there anymore but art can replace prophecy and that they called it the transition from the mirror to the lamp Shakespeare said that art should hold the mirror up to nature but now the New Romantic artist said we have a lamp inside us we're kind of talking to you and prophesying to you and that's it goes back to Plato really who said that artists are kind of dumb you know we shouldn't listen to artists when they give their Oscars speech but when they're informed by the muse they do create a truth through their art and that was that was what Plato said about artists he didn't like artists very much because he said because they say truthful things when informed by their muse we tend to trust them to say other things but when they're talking without their muse when they're giving their Oscar speech they're idiots and I think that was part of it but he did believe that they were informed by a muse the romantics kind of came back to that idea that they weren't holding a mirror up to nature they were shining a lamp on it and giving us new truths and that was going to replace the truths of religious revelation and the Bible and it didn't work it collapsed especially I think we could say it collapsed with the Holocaust and with the Nazis who had come from one of the great cultures that believed in this and led the way Germany had led the way and a lot of romantic thought and vogner believed in this and it all came crashing down and he says perhaps I'm reading now from Douglas Murray's the strange death of Europe he says perhaps it was the realization that art had failed in this way that persuaded so many contemporary artists to stop aiming to connect to any enduring truths and to abandon attempt to pursue beauty or truth and instead to simply say to the public eye and down in the mud with you certainly there was a point in 20th century Europe when folded silver feathers when the aim of the artist and the expectation of the public changed it was evident in the way in which the public approach to art moved from admiration to disdain technical ambition significantly diminished and often disappeared altogether and he tells this one story that just moved me so much he was in he was in an art museum let me see if I can get find this I once while want he says while wandering somewhat aimlessly and underwhelmed through an art gallery I heard the strains of spam in Allium which is by the famous medieval composer Thomas Tallis he was a tutor Eirik composer he heard the strains of spam in Allium and made my way towards the sound suddenly I realized another reason why the earlier galleries had been so de populated all the other modern art galleries are de populated everyone had migrated toward this sound installation by Janet Cardiff it consisted of 40 speakers arranged in an oval and each speaker relayed the voice of a singer in the choir and in the center people stood and they were mesmerised the couples held hands and one pair sat embraced it was deeply moving though also striking that people thought the achievement was Janet Cardiff's the woman who had set up the speaker's rather than Thomas Tallis's and he mentions I mean it's such a touching idea that this medieval composer spoke to these people but what they thought was important was the arrangement of the speakers and Thomas Tallis also of course shows up as Douglas Murray talks about this he shows up in 50 shades of grey he's mentioned in these books which are all about you know whipping each other and they had basically sadomasochism and it's this degradation of this thing the art that contained these ideas just like the people who've contained these ideas was not great because of the the artists it was great because of the ideas the thoughts the vision that it contained in the experience of that vision that has been what made Western arts so brilliant so incredibly brilliant from 1500 to 1914 about and that that really was it really was the high point of human artistic creation it was just unbelievable so we are going to end with Thomas Tallis with his Magnificat and you can hear a little bit of that I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show the Clavin this weekend begins stave it off by binge listening to another kingdom of performed by
