1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,720
Armagh is now the strongest hurricane to
ever plow into the leeward islands

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,670
yesterday we mentioned only hurricane
Allen from 1980 was stronger in recorded

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,650
history for the Atlantic by five miles
per hour

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,770
irma today however has surpassed Allen
by continuing to churn for over 24 hours

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,050
with winds above 180 Alan never did that
we are going to get in closer now and

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,260
take a look at this massive eye that was
23 miles in diameter

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,539
yesterday expected it to swallow up
Barbuda st. Martin Anguilla

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,680
communication is out power is out until
the back edge slides through these

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,610
islands aircraft will not be able to get
up to assess the damage from above

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,510
I'm sure civil emergency management
crews are on the ground trying to assess

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,890
the damage but we have had no contact
the system is moving at 16 miles per

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,719
hour remember Harvey only moved to 2 or
3 we could out lock it but on Barbuda if

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,800
you look at the winds gusts 118 27 131
151 154 155 and then the instrument

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,039
broke
that's how massive the storm is 4 to 6

15
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,180
foot storm surge on the northern coast
of Puerto Rico the center is now 55

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,100
miles from San Juan hurricane force
winds are spreading across the island so

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,790
again heavy amounts of rain mainly in
the mountainous areas could cause

18
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,170
obviously some landslides flash flooding
and a concern on the coastline warnings

19
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,880
now in the Turks and Caicos they're
expecting a storm surge of 20 to 25 feet

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,420
because they're going to be in the north
and northeastern quadrant that's where

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,240
the winds and the winds are going to be
a little stronger in those surf waves as

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,280
they crash into that area here is the
change now from last night until this

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,110
morning the National Hurricane Center
shifted the center notice where we have

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,369
our little category 4 in southern
Florida shifted about 60 to 70 miles

25
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,780
eastward they have left the cone of
uncertainty stretching west that gives

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,310
us that window if the system decides to
edge that direction but they also have

27
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,479
extended that cone of uncertainty
further eastward which may now tell us

28
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,890
if it's continuing to trend eastward
maybe we're looking at a landfall either

29
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,960
on a Miami along the east coast of
Florida or into the Carolinas let's

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,780
break it down a little closer for you
and look at these spaghetti plots

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,830
another change is this yesterday more of
the models mu

32
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,240
denne to cuba the higher terrain with
the mountains over 6,000 metres would

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,350
shred the system down and maybe break it
down to a category 2 most of the models

34
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,790
do not interact with Cuba now so it
sustains its strength over the very warm

35
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,650
waters still sometimes Saturday a turn
to the north and now with that shift

36
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,770
eastward
it looks like Monroe County miami-dade

37
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:40,650
right on Miami maybe even making its way
along the coast possibly back over water

38
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,760
around Cape Canaveral slides into
Savannah Georgia if I show you quickly

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,600
what the models are doing again let's
just go ahead and pull up the US and the

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
European they're on top of each other
right now let's put this into motion

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,950
you're going to see no interaction with
Cuba here is landfall near Miami it

42
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,630
continues to make its way northward both
models carry it back over water then

43
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,950
into Georgia and the Carolinas we've got
an interesting situation right now we're

44
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,350
setting up because we now have Jose back
behind the system as a hurricane and

45
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,550
another one but just to remind you of
what Matthew did along the coastline 15

46
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,390
billion dollars in economic losses and
that was just off the coast guess what

47
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:24,630
Katia just became a hurricane in the
southern Gulf of Mexico we have three it

48
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,940
has not happened since 2010 when we had
Carl Julia and Igor I believe it was but

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,220
Jose may become a major category follow
suit and come very close to those

50
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,780
northern islands again of the Lesser
Antilles before turning northward this

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:00:00,000
is getting crazy with
