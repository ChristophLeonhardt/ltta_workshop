1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,601
IT'S EXCEEDINGLY UNLIKELY THAT 

2
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:01,801
-- 

3
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:02,168
>>> ALL RIGHT. 

4
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,837
RIGHT NOW SENATE MAJORITY 

5
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:04,871
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL IS 

6
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:12,212
HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE ON 

7
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:12,879
THE CONFIRMATION OF JUSTICE 

8
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:13,179
KAVANAUGH. 

9
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:13,513
LET'S LISTEN. 

10
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,482
>> THE OFFICIAL SWEARING IN OF 

11
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:15,915
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. 

12
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,786
WITH THAT I WILL BE HAPPY TO 

13
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,687
THROW IT OPEN. 

14
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,889
>> SENATOR, YOU SAID ON FOX 

15
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,090
NEWS, ASKED ABOUT MERRICK 

16
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,392
GARLAND, DO YOU SEE A SITUATION 

17
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:27,760
IN WHICH ONE PARTY CONTROLS THE 

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,195
WHITE HOUSE AND ONE PARTY 

19
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,197
CONTROLS THE U.S. SENATE WE 

20
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,900
COULD GET A SUPREME COURT 

21
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,466
JUSTICE THROUGH? 

22
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,202
>> OF COURSE. 

23
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,871
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT EXACTLY 

24
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,173
WHAT THE TRADITION IS IN A 

25
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:40,974
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR WHEN 

26
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,642
YOU HAVE A SENATE IN THE HANDS 

27
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,945
OF ONE PARTY AND THE WHITE 

28
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,381
HOUSE IN THE HANDS OF ANOTHER. 

29
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,884
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR IS 

30
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,787
WHAT WE HAD IN 202016 -- 2016. 

31
00:00:54,787 --> 00:01:00,459
YOU WOULD HAVE GO BACK TO THE 

32
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,196
1880s A VIRGINIA CAN ANY OKAY 

33
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,431
-- VACANCY WAS FILLED BY A 

34
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,767
DIFFERENT PARTY FROM THE 

35
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,067
PRESIDENT. 

36
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:12,872
YOU RECALL FROM 2016 THAT JOE 

37
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:13,305
BIDEN VOLUNTEERED. 

38
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:14,974
WE DIDN'T HAVE A VACANCY IN 

39
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,242
1992, A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR IN 

40
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,043
WHICH THERE WAS A PARTY IN 

41
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,411
CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE, A 

42
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,780
DIFFERENT PARTY IN CONTROL OF 

43
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,682
THE SENATE BUT JOE VOLUNTEERED 

44
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,251
THAT IF A VACANCY OCCURRED THEY 

45
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:25,852
WOULDN'T FILL IT. 

46
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,688
YOU PLAY RECALL FROM OUR 

47
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,190
DISCUSSIONS IN 2016 THAT CHUCK 

48
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,027
SCHUMER AND HARRY REID SAID 18 

49
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,395
MONTHS BEFORE THE END OF THE 

50
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,298
BUSH 43 PRESIDENCY THAT IF A 

51
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,199
VACANCY OCCURRED THEY WOULDN'T 

52
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:40,466
FILL IT. 

53
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:43,803
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE WAS A 

54
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,104
DEMOCRATIC SENATE AND A 

55
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:45,637
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. 

56
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,074
SO, WHAT I DID WAS ENTIRELY 

57
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,943
CONSISTENT WITH AMERICAN 

58
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,711
HISTORY GOING BACK TO THE 1800s 

59
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,146
OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A VACANCY 

60
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,414
OCCURS IN THE MIDDLE OF A 

61
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:56,316
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR AND 

62
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,919
YOU HAVE ONE PARTY IN THE WHITE 

63
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,923
HOUSE AND ANOTHER PARTY IN 

64
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:04,423
CONTROL OF THE SENATE. 

65
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,191
>> ARE YOU FEARFUL AT ALL ONE 

66
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,793
DAY DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK THE 

67
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,529
SENATE THAT THEY COULD SAY TO A 

68
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,364
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, WE WON'T 

69
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,598
DO ANY NOMINATIONS IN ANY YEAR? 

70
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:13,499
>> THEY COULD. 

71
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:17,003
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE 

72
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:17,537
SUSTAINABLE POLITICALLY. 

73
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,937
IT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD ARGUMENT 

74
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:19,272
TO MAKE. 

75
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,573
I NOTICE ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 

76
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,775
SENATORS SAID IF THEY GOT THE 

77
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,843
SENATE BACK THIS YEAR, THEY 

78
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,113
COULD NOT DO ANY JUDGES FOR THE 

79
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:32,451
NEXT TWO YEARS. 

80
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:37,490
I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS POLL 

81
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,024
-- WORKS POLITICALLY. 

82
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,493
EVERYBODY KNEW IF THE SHOE WAS 

83
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,962
ON THE OTHER FOOT THEY WOULDN'T 

84
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:43,396
FILL THE VACANCY. 

85
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,399
EVERYBODY SMILED BECAUSE YOU 

86
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,900
KNEW IF IT WAS A DEMOCRATIC 

87
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,702
PRESIDENT AND -- I MEAN A 

88
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,471
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT AND A 

89
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,838
DEMOCRATIC SENATE THEY WOULDN'T 

90
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,539
HAVE FILLED THE VACANCY. 

91
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,374
>> SENATOR, WHAT IS YOUR 

92
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,976
MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 

93
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,778
ANGRY ABOUT THIS CONFIRMATION, 

94
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,411
THE PEOPLE BANGING ON THE DOORS 

95
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,580
OF THE SUPREME COURT, PEOPLE 

96
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,882
THAT YOU SAY ARE IN YOUR FACE. 

97
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,250
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM? 

98
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,517
>> LOOK. 

99
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:08,488
I HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR THE 

100
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,423
KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT JUSTICE 

101
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,692
KAVANAUGH WAS ACCUSED OF BUT I 

102
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,496
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND 

103
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,299
EVERYBODY THAT THERE WAS NO 

104
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:19,799
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE. 

105
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,271
I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE ETHICS 

106
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:25,704
COMMITTEE IN 1995. 

107
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:29,075
WHEN I INVESTIGATED AND LATER 

108
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:33,313
MADE THE MOTION TO EXPEL FROM 

109
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,881
THE SENATE SENATOR BOB PACKWOOD 

110
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,816
CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE 

111
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:41,120
COMMITTEE OF MY PARTY ON THESE 

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,921
KINDS OF ALLEGATIONS. 

113
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,123
I SAID DURING THE ROY MOORE 

114
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,893
SPECIAL ELECTION, I BELIEVED 

115
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,193
THE WOMEN. 

116
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,195
THERE WERE MULTIPLE -- AMPLE 

117
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:53,333
EVIDENCE, MULTIPLE EXAMPLES 

118
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:53,900
OVER AND OVER AND OVER. 

119
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,173
SO, I DON'T THINK THIS MEANS IN 

120
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,041
ANY WAY THAT THE REPUBLICANS OR 

121
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,176
AMERICANS IN GENERAL CONDON 

122
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:07,980
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR BUT IT 

123
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,681
MUST BE PROVEN. 

124
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,648
AFTER ALL, THIS IS AMERICA. 

125
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:13,886
>> WOULD YOU SAY THE COUNTRY IS 

126
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:14,887
OVERLY DIVIDED? 

127
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,957
>> LOOK, WE GO THROUGH THESE 

128
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,223
PERIODS. 

129
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:21,494
WE HAD BIG FIGHTS OVER OTHER 

130
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,696
THINGS AND THE COUNTRY WILL BE 

131
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:23,996
JUST FINE. 

132
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:27,200
>> WHAT IS THE PROSPECT FOR THE 

133
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,202
MIDTERMS NOW POST KAVANAUGH. 

134
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,570
WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 

135
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,671
>> THAT IS AN INTERESTING 

136
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:31,938
QUESTION. 

137
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,973
WE HAVE NOTICED, BY THE WAY, 

138
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,875
SOME ENERGY PICK UP ON OUR 

139
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,275
SIDE. 

140
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,811
I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT 

141
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,014
THE DEMOCRATS ARE QUITE 

142
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:47,487
ENERGIZED AND HAVE BEEN FOR 

143
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,787
SOME TIME. 

144
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,922
THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO SEND THE 

145
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:50,790
PIPELINE A MESSAGE. 

146
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,223
THEY ARE ENERGIZED. 

147
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:53,926
WHAT I THINK THIS HAS DONE FOR 

148
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,695
US IS PROVIDE THE KIND OF 

149
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,196
ADRENALIN SHOT THAT WE HAVE NOT 

150
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,499
BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO 

151
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:03,102
ACHIEVE IN ANY OTHER WAY. 

152
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,836
SO, WE SEE THAT MOVEMENT. 

153
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:07,306
I NOTICED ON CBS YESTERDAY 

154
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,375
THEIR BATTLEGROUND TRACKER POLL 

155
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,177
HAD OUR CANDIDATE IN TENNESSEE 

156
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,244
UP BY EIGHT POINTS. 

157
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:14,747
I HAD NEVER SEEN A SURVEY LIKE 

158
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,716
THAT IN TENNESSEE IN RECENT 

159
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:16,949
WEEKS. 

160
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,284
WE THINK THERE IS EVIDENCE, 

161
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,953
LAWRENCE, THAT THIS WILL BE 

162
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,188
HELPFUL TO US NEXT MONTH. 

163
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,890
>> DO YOU THINK THIS WILL 

164
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,794
PREVENT YOU FROM FACING ANOTHER 

165
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,895
PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN 2020? 

166
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,161
>> LOOK. 

167
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,798
I DID JUST FINE IN THE PRIMARY 

168
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,331
THE LAST TIME. 

169
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:35,735
I WOULD REMIND YOU GUYS I 

170
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,172
CARRIED 118 OUT OF 119 

171
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:39,872
COUNTIES. 

172
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,640
I'M NOT AFRAID OF A PRIMARY. 

173
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,709
I THINK I HAVE DEMONSTRATED 

174
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:44,910
AGAINST A CREDIBLE CANDIDATE. 

175
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,282
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT. 

176
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,117
>> NOT AFRAID BUT SOLIDIFIES 

177
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:51,784
SUPPORT. 

178
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:52,685
>> ANYBODY CAN FILE. 

179
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,052
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY. 

180
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,088
AND I'M SURE I WILL HAVE -- ONE 

181
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:59,058
THING ABOUT BEING IN THE JOB 

182
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,795
I'M IN, YOU GET A LOT OF SLINGS 

183
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,095
AND ARROWS. 

184
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:03,729
YOUR APPROVAL RATING TAKES A 

185
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,298
BEATING FROM TIME TO TIME AND 

186
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:07,700
THAT IS A GOOD RECRUITMENT TOOL 

187
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,301
FOR THE OTHER SIDE. 

188
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,203
I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE 

189
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,471
TO GET A CREDIBLE CANDIDATE AND 

190
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,474
I WILL BE READY TO DEAL WITH 

191
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:14,640
IT. 

192
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,942
>> WHAT TOUCHING THIS MEANS 

193
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,275
FOUR LEGACY. 

194
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,877
WE LOOKED AT A SITUATION WHERE 

195
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,112
THE COURT COULD HAVE BEEN A 

196
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,013
LIBERAL COURT INTO 2016. 

197
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:25,184
YOU MADE A BIG GAMBLE ON 

198
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:25,784
HOLDING UP PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 

199
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:26,118
VACANCY PICK. 

200
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:28,688
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS 

201
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:28,955
FOR YOU? 

202
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,090
I TALKED TO PEOPLE THAT SAID 

203
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,593
THIS PUTS YOU IN CONSERVATISM 

204
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,127
TO ENSURE THAT THE SUPREME 

205
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:37,263
COURT IS CONSERVATIVE FOR 

206
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:37,897
GENERATIONS TO COME. 

207
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,866
HOW DO YOU THINK HISTORY JUDGES 

208
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,500
YOU. 

209
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,601
>> HARD TO JUDGE YOUR OWN 

210
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,168
LEGACY BUT I THINK IT'S THE 

211
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,570
SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING 

212
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,777
THAT I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN IN 

213
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,077
MY CAREER. 

214
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,411
THE COURT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST 

215
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,480
WAY YOU CAN HAVE A LONG-TERM 

216
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,848
IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY. 

217
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,986
THE ONLY THING WE DO WITH 

218
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:00,486
LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS. 

219
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:00,953
I LIKE THE TAX BILL. 

220
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,156
I LIKE WHAT WE DID ON 

221
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:04,489
DEREGULATION. 

222
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:05,791
BUT AS SOON AS THE POLITICAL 

223
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,094
WINDS SHIFT WE WILL BE BACK ON 

224
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,295
THE TAX CODE. 

225
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,698
I REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE '86 

226
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,900
TAX REFORM ACT LASTED FOUR 

227
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,601
YEARS. 

228
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,470
AND, SO, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A 

229
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,839
LONG-TERM IMPACT AND ALL OF US 

230
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,409
WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT, THE 

231
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,513
SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT WAY TO 

232
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,747
DO IT IS JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. 

233
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:31,217
MY PARTY HAS NOT BEEN IN THAT 

234
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,485
POSITION ALL THAT LONG. 

235
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,319
GO BACK 100 YEARS. 

236
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,591
20 OF THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS 

237
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,292
HAVE REPUBLICANS HAD THE 

238
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,494
PRESIDENCY, HOUSE AND SENATE AT 

239
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,194
THE SAME TIME. 

240
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:43,496
THESE OPPORTUNITIES HAVE NOT 

241
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,764
COME ALONG THAT OFTEN FOR US. 

242
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,500
I DO THINK IT'S THE MOST 

243
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,002
CONSEQUENTIAL THING THAT I HAVE 

244
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:50,469
BEEN INVOLVED IN. 

245
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,773
>> SOME ARE BLAMING YOU FOR 

246
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,675
BREAKING THE SENATE AND KILLING 

247
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:55,975
DEMOCRACY. 

248
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,877
WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE THE 

249
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:01,013
OTHER VIEW OF WHAT YOU HAVE 

250
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:01,681
DONE? 

251
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,551
>> THEY CAN SPEAK FOR 

252
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:05,851
THEMSELVES. 

253
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:10,022
THERE IS NOTHING DONE BROKEN IN 

254
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:10,656
OUR DEMOCRACY. 

255
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,456
YOU HAVE SEEN IT ON DISPLAY. 

256
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,792
JOHN MEACHAM WROTE A WONDERFUL 

257
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,193
BOOK WITHIN THE LAST YEAR I 

258
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,695
RECOMMEND CALLED THE SOUL OF 

259
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,195
AMERICA. 

260
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,898
WHAT HE DOES IS -- DID YOU READ 

261
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:19,899
IT? 

262
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,199
YOU SHOULD. 

263
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,203
I MEAN, IT TAKES US THROUGH OUR 

264
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,473
LOW POINTS AND ONE OF MINE THAT 

265
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:31,377
I WOULD CITE BECAUSE IT WAS THE 

266
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,513
DEMOCRATS, WOODROW WILSON 

267
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,846
DEBUTED BIRTH OF A NATION IN 

268
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,216
THE WHITE HOUSE WHICH LED TO 

269
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,619
THE RESURGENCE OF THE CLAN IN 

270
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,552
THE 1920s HERE IN AMERICA. 

271
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:44,490
SO, HE KIND OF GOES THROUGH THE 

272
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,392
VARIOUS LOW POINTS IN AMERICAN 

273
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,094
HISTORY AND HOW WE RECOVERED. 

274
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,296
THE COUNTRY WILL BE FINE. 

275
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,063
JUSTICE SCALIA SAID EVER TEN 

276
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,300
HORNED DICTATOR IN THE WORLD 

277
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,334
HAS A BILL OF RIGHTS. 

278
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:59,271
WHAT PROTECTS AMERICA IS THE 

279
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:02,041
SEPARATION OF POWERS. 

280
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:02,641
AND THE GENIUSES WHO FOUNDED 

281
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,609
THIS COUNTRY ASSUMED THAT 

282
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,111
PEOPLE WOULD DO THE WORST 

283
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:05,344
THING. 

284
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,947
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALL THESE 

285
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:08,714
DIFFERENT CHECKS AND BALANCES 

286
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,315
IN PLACE. 

287
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,283
SO, THE COUNTRY WILL BE JUST 

288
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:11,516
FINE. 

289
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:14,787
I THINK A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE 

290
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,689
WHO HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED OTHER 

291
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,291
LOW POINTS THINK THAT WHATEVER 

292
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,461
PROBLEMS WE ARE HAVING AT ANY 

293
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,496
GIVEN MOMENT ARE UNIQUE. 

294
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,663
LISTEN, THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR AS 

295
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,899
SIGNIFICANT AS WHAT WAS GOING 

296
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,501
ON IN THE '60s, FIGHTING 

297
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,036
THROUGH THE WHOLE CIVIL RIGHTS 

298
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:34,774
ISSUE AND COMING OUT IN THE 

299
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,107
RIGHT PLACE. 

300
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,608
I'M POSITIVE AND UPBEAT ABOUT 

301
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:37,042
THE COUNTRY. 

302
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,177
I KNOW EVERYBODY ISN'T BUT WE 

303
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:40,112
WILL BE FINE. 

304
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:44,517
>> THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SAID 

305
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,519
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WAIVER FROM 

306
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,190
BRETT KAVANAUGH, QUOTING THAT 

307
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,192
YOU ARE TOUGHER THAN MULE  . 

308
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,026
>> THAT IS STRONG. 

309
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,698
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHY I FELT 

310
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,664
STRONGLY ABOUT IT. 

311
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:05,171
>> YOU HAD A PERSON'S LIFE 

312
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,472
BEING DESTROYED HERE BY 

313
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,072
UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATIONS. 

314
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:12,010
I THOUGHT WE OWED IT TO JUDGE 

315
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,813
KAVANAUGH TO VOTE. 

316
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,814
HE WANTED A VOTE. 

317
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:19,852
IMAGINE WHAT WITHDRAWAL WOULD 

318
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:20,252
HAVE LOOKED LIKE. 

319
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,088
IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE 

320
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:22,688
CONCEDING THE ALLEGATION. 

321
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,924
SO, I FELT LIKE WE OWED IT TO 

322
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,293
HIM AND TO THE COUNTRY TO WORK 

323
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,896
OUR WAY THROUGH THIS AND I WAS 

324
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,197
ALWAYS OPPOSED TO WITHDRAWAL. 

325
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:33,599
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE 

326
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,401
PRESIDENT WAS IN FAVOR OF 

327
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,502
WITHDRAWAL EITHER, BUT THE 

328
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,937
MOMENT THAT EVERYBODY WOULD 

329
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:38,904
HAVE HAD SECOND THOUGHTS 

330
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,942
OBVIOUSLY WAS AFTER DR. FORD 

331
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,242
TESTIFIED. 

332
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:43,742
SHE WAS VERY CREDIBLE. 

333
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:45,711
I DID TALK TO THE PRESIDENT 

334
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,413
AFTER THAT AND MY SUGGESTION 

335
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,815
WAS WE BOTH AGREED SHE WAS VERY 

336
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,082
CREDIBLE. 

337
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:59,124
MY SUGGESTION WAS THAT THIS IS 

338
00:10:59,124 --> 00:10:59,391
HALFTIME. 

339
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:02,695
LET'S SEE WHAT IT LIKES LOOK AT 

340
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,597
THE END OF THE GAME. 

341
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,999
I THINK AFTER JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

342
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,900
TESTIMONY EVERYBODY FELT BETTER 

343
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,703
ABOUT HIM AND OUR ABILITIES TO 

344
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,839
PREVAIL AND WE HAD THE FBI 

345
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,141
INVESTIGATION AND THE 

346
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,275
PARAMETERS WERE DETERMINED IN 

347
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,676
MY OFFICE FRIDAY A WEEK AGO. 

348
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,511
I HAD THE SENATE REPUBLICAN 

349
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:22,081
MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY 

350
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,017
COMMITTEE THERE AND SENATOR 

351
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,354
COLLINS, SENATOR MURKOWSKI AND 

352
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,424
SENATOR MURKOWSKI, SENATOR 

353
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:33,225
COLLINS AND SENATOR FLAKE 

354
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,026
BASICALLY AGREED AMONG THE 

355
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,228
THREE OF THEM WHAT THEY THOUGHT 

356
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,696
THE SCOPE OF THE FBI 

357
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,397
INVESTIGATION OUGHT TO BE. 

358
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:38,730
THREE POINTS. 

359
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:45,905
NUMBER ONE, IT NEEDED TO BE 

360
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,573
DONE WITHIN A WEEK BECAUSE HE 

361
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,974
HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED SIX TIMES 

362
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,609
IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER. 

363
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:55,614
TALK TO ANYBODY THAT DR. FORD 

364
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,716
MENTIONED AND NUMBER 3, 

365
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,018
RAMIREZ, TALK TO RAMIREZ AND 

366
00:11:59,018 --> 00:11:59,918
ANYBODY RAMIREZ MENTIONED. 

367
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:04,924
ALL OF THAT WAS DONE WITHIN THE 

368
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:05,925
SEVEN DAY PERIOD. 

369
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,426
AND LAST THURSDAY THE THREE OF 

370
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,195
THEM AND LOTS OF OTHER MEMBERS 

371
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:13,299
WENT DOWN AND LOOKED AT THE FBI 

372
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:13,532
FILES. 

373
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:13,899
IT'S ONE FILE. 

374
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,633
THE REASON THOSE AREN'T COPIED 

375
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,302
IS THEY ARE NOT THE PROPERTY OF 

376
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:16,936
THE SENATE. 

377
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,839
THEY ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE 

378
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,107
EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND IT'S 

379
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,041
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. 

380
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,410
EVERYBODY WHO WANTED TO READ 

381
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,545
THE FBI REPORT COULD AND MANY 

382
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,012
DID. 

383
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,147
WE STAYED IN ALL NIGHT 

384
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:28,414
THURSDAY. 

385
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:34,954
ANYBODY WHO WANTED TO READ THE 

386
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,254
FBI REPORT COULD. 

387
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:37,923
THAT LED TO FRIDAY'S VOTE. 

388
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,025
TWO OF THE THREE MEMBERS AGREED 

389
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,727
TO SUPPORT -- DECIDED TO 

390
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,865
SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH BECAUSE 

391
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,534
THEY FOUND THE SUPPLEMENTAL FBI 

392
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,938
REPORT, NUMBER 7, THE 7th FBI 

393
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,341
REPORT CONVINCING THAT THERE 

394
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,107
WAS NO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE. 

395
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:59,545
>> YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE IN 

396
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,045
YOUR FACE PROTESTERS. 

397
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,547
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR 

398
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,581
SECURITY OR THAT OF YOUR 

399
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,583
COLLEAGUES. 

400
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:10,689
>> I WOULD RATHER NOT TALK 

401
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,056
ABOUT SECURITY. 

402
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,492
ITCHING THE TACTICS WERE 

403
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,761
HELPFUL TO ME IN UNIFYING OUR 

404
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:16,061
SIDE. 

405
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,930
I THINK THERE WERE TWO THINGS 

406
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,101
THAT INSPIRED OUR PEOPLE TO 

407
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,068
CONFIRM THIS NOMINEE. 

408
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,837
ONE, PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. 

409
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,672
THERE WAS NO CORROBORATING 

410
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:28,140
EVIDENCE. 

411
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,178
NUMBER TWO, THE TACTICS WERE 

412
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,011
DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE. 

413
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,580
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

414
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,081
PEACEFUL PROTESTERS AND PEOPLE 

415
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,951
TRYING TO GET IN YOUR FACE AND 

416
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:43,622
TRY TO INTIMIDATE YOU AND SCARE 

417
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:43,989
YOU. 

418
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:49,128
WE HAD A FEW EXPERIENCES HERE 

419
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:49,495
IN LOUISVILLE. 

420
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,264
I THINK THOSE WERE THE TWO 

421
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,064
THINGS THAT HELPED US SUCCEED. 

422
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:55,134
AND I THINK IT WAS AN IMPORTANT 

423
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,235
MOMENT FOR THE COUNTRY. 

424
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,503
I KNOW EVERYBODY DOESN'T SEE IT 

425
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,407
THE SAME WAY BUT THAT'S THE WAY 

426
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,107
I SEE IT. 

427
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,310
>> SENATOR, YOU SAID THAT SHE 

428
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,643
WAS CREDIBLE. 

429
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,645
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT SHE WAS 

430
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:07,146
CREDIBLE. 

431
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,915
THEN THE PRESIDENT MOCKED DR. 

432
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,750
FORD ON ONE OF HIS SPEECHES. 

433
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,253
MANY SAY THAT SENDS A BAD 

434
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,154
MESSAGE FOR WOMEN ACROSS THE 

435
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:16,421
COUNTRY. 

436
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:17,556
>> I'M TRYING TO THINK OF HOW 

437
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,258
MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TRIED TO 

438
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:29,067
GET ME TO COMMENT ON 

439
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:29,567
PRESIDENTIAL COMMENTS. 

440
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:29,935
GOOD TRY. 

441
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,437
IN 2016 I BELIEVE YOU SAID WE 

442
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,605
WILL HOLD THIS OPEN BECAUSE 

443
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:34,940
IT'S A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 

444
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,442
YEAR, WE WILL LET THE PEOPLE 

445
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:38,777
DECIDE, GIVE THEM A CHANCE. 

446
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,980
NOW, AM I CORRECT IN SAYING 

447
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,781
THAT, WELL, SINCE WE HAVE A 

448
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,749
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT AND 

449
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,485
REPUBLICAN SENATE WE COULD 

450
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,152
CONFIRM A NOMINEE IN 2020 -- 

451
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,887
>> I JUST WALKED YOU THROUGH 

452
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:49,688
THAT. 

453
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,822
I WILL GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. 

454
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:54,894
>> THE TRADITION GOING BACK TO 

455
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,597
THE 1880s HAS BEEN THAT IF A 

456
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,099
VACANCY OCCURS IN A 

457
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,601
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR AND 

458
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,703
THERE IS A DIFFERENT PARTY IN 

459
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,272
CONTROL OF THE SENATE, THAN THE 

460
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,406
PRESIDENCY, IT IS NOT FILLED. 

461
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,477
I WALKED YOU THROUGH THAT A 

462
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:11,777
MINUTE AGO. 

463
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,613
SO, WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WILL 

464
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,314
BE A VACANCY IN 2020. 

465
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,016
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WILL BE IN 

466
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,151
CHARGE OF THE SENATE. 

467
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,186
>> BUT THE KEY THERE IS THAT -- 

468
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,623
>> THAT HAS BEEN THE TRADITION 

469
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,526
GOING BACK TO THE 1880s AND DO 

470
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,629
I NEED TO QUOTE JOE BIDEN, 

471
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,463
CHUCK SCHUMER AGAIN? 

472
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:37,870
>> YOU THINK THAT IS FAIR? 

473
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,303
>> IT'S PRACTICAL. 

474
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:38,671
THINK ABOUT IT. 

475
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,574
THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT AN 

476
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,010
OPPOSITION PARTY IS GOING TO -- 

477
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,446
IN CONTROL OF THE SENATE WILL 

478
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,014
FILL A SUPREME COURT VACANCY 

479
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,884
INCURRING IN THE MIDDLE OF A 

480
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:52,484
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR. 

481
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,688
THAT'S WHY IT HADN'T HAPPENED 

482
00:15:56,688 --> 00:16:01,794
SINCE THE 1880s. 

483
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,361
I WILL TAKE ONE MORE. 

484
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,097
>> THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL THING 

485
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,798
YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN. 

486
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,133
IS THIS YOUR GREATIST VICTORY 

487
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,000
YOUR TIME IN THE SENATE? 

488
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,570
>> I THINK OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO 

489
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,737
MAKE THOSE KIND OF 

490
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:13,071
OBSERVATIONS. 

491
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:14,339
I THINK THE COURT PROJECT HAS 

492
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,341
BEEN MY NUMBER ONE PROJECT FOR 

493
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:21,080
THE LAST TWO YEARS, TWO SUPREME 

494
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,215
COURT JUSTICES, 26 CIRCUIT 

495
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,883
COURT JUSTIZE MY NUMBER ONE 

496
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:25,784
PRIORITY AND, SO, OBVIOUSLY I 

497
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,186
FEEL IT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, 

498
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:33,158
THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I DO 

499
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,893
FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. 

500
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:39,964
>> Reporter: DID YOU WATCH THE 

501
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:41,100
FOOTBALL GAME, SENATOR? 

502
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,433
LOUISVILLE -- 

503
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,901
>> OH, GOODNESS GRACIOUS. 

504
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:47,773
WE ARE OFF THE RECORD NOW, 

505
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,675
RIGHT? 

506
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:56,582
REMINDED ME OF RON COOPER, OH, 

507
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,116
NO. 

508
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:57,649
NOBODY IS FILMING RIGHT? 

509
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,650
>> THEY ARE STILL ROLLING. 

510
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,419
>> I WATCHED IT ON TV. 

511
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,720
I WAS STILL IN WASHINGTON. 

512
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,721
>> ALL RIGHT. 

513
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,892
YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

514
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,928
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 

515
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,497
McCONNELL TAKING QUESTIONS FROM 

516
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:11,896
LOCAL REPORTERS. 

517
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,900
THE QUESTION IS DIRECTED AT THE 

518
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,201
SPEAKER RANGED ON JUDGE 

519
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,603
KAVANAUGH ALTHOUGH YOU HEARD 

520
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,771
HIM JOKING WITH SOME OF THE 

521
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:20,873
REPORTS ABOUT FOOTBALL BUT 

522
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,574
QUESTIONS SURROUNDING JUDGE 

523
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,675
KAVANAUGH AND WHAT COULD 

524
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,011
POTENTIALLY HAPPEN IN 2020 

525
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:26,712
DURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 

526
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,012
YEAR DEPENDING ON WHICH PARTY 

527
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,280
IS IN CONTROL OF THE CONGRESS 

528
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,217
AND WHICH PARTY IS IN CONTROL 

529
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,285
OF THE PRESIDENCY. 

530
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,185
IN 2020, LEADING UP TO THE 

531
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,120
ELECTION THE REPUBLICAN 

532
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,989
PRESIDENT WILL BE IN CHARGE OF 

533
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:37,356
THE PRESIDENCY. 

534
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,191
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

535
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,492
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE UPCOMING 

536
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,828
MIDTERMS TO SEE WHERE WE END UP 

537
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,464
AT THE OTHER END OF THAT. 

538
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,132
MITCH McCONNELL SUGGESTING THAT 

539
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:47,799
REPUBLICANS ARE MORE GALVANIZED 

540
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,702
THAN EVER BECAUSE OF THE WAY 

541
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,671
THAT THEY FEEL, REPUBLICANS, 

542
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,173
THE MAJORITY LEADER FEEL THE 

543
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,139
WAY JUNG KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED. 

544
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:58,811
SO, HE SAYS THAT WHILE THERE IS 

545
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,078
A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM ON THE 

546
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,014
DEMOCRATIC SIDE HE BELIEVES 

547
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,716
THERE IS A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM 

548
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,019
GENERATED OVER THIS BATTLE OVER 

549
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:07,452
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. 

550
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,153
WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW WHAT 

551
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,922
HAPPENS WITH THE SPEAKER AND 

552
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,490
