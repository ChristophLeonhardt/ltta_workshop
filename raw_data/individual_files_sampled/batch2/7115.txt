Turkish officials and investigators are slowly but surely leaking more details about how khashoggi was allegedly murdered by Saudi officials now Jamal Khashoggi was of course a u.s. resident who was writing columns for The Washington Post he was living in self-exile out of fear that the Saudi officials would come after him and murder him and if we are to believe the Turkish investigators Saudi officials did murder him as he was going into the Turk the Saudi consulate in Istanbul now we're learning more details about how this murder was allegedly done and it's very gruesome so according to the latest report in The New York Times Saudi agents were waiting when Jamal khashoggi walked into their country's consulate in Istanbul mr. Khashoggi was dead within minutes beheaded dismembered his finger severed and within two hours the killers were gone to me the most troubling part I mean every part of his or if eclis troubling they couldn't tell if his fingers are severed while he was alive or after he was dead the the head and the other limbs they that's what they brought the bone saw for and and presumably to be able to carry him away easier and conceal it but the fingers there's no reason to cut those after he's dead likely they cut him while he was still alive so the Turkish authorities say that they have audio recordings of what happened and so as a result they can hear who was present and what they said now according to the new york times after khashoggi was shown into the office of the saudi consul the agency's khashoggi almost immediately and began to beat and torture him eventually cutting off his fingers again we don't know if they cut off his fingers while he was alive or dead now the Consul was present according to these audio recordings and objected he allegedly said do this outside you will put me in trouble and one of the saudi officials responded with if you want to live when you come back to Arabia shut up remember they can escape goes somebody right because the the guy who very very very very likely ordered it is the leader of Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or now apparently bonesaw Salman and and so they're not gonna turn around and go yeah the monarch did it that's not how monarchies work so they'll have to say that they took stern action once they found out who the rogue killer was so I don't know if they'll pin it on the console because he objected for like one second in the middle of the murder about where they killed him not whether they should kill him or they'll pin it on somebody and right now everybody on that 15 person team has to be incredibly nervous because somebody's gonna get a scapegoated and likely they'll kill that guy too because they don't want him hanging around even if it's in a Saudi prison because he knows the real story so and remember as we spoke about on a previous show both the New York Times and Turkish investigators identified several of the 15 Saudi officials who were present and so if people know who they are and they also know that these individuals have close ties to the Saudi royals who knows what's in the future for them and it's it is a scary thing to consider so another thing to keep in mind is that one of the people one of the Saudi officials who was there and who was ID'd was a Saudi doctor he was a medical professional and as the agents cut off Khashoggi 's head and dismembered his body the doctor did have some advice he told them listen to music as he donned headphones himself that was what he did to ease the tension when doing such work the doctor explained and so the doctor had published work in dissection so maybe that's what he was referring to there but either way it's just incredibly gruesome and to know that the US government is gonna try to cover up for the Saudi officials or for the Saudi royals is incredibly discouraging and terrifying a couple more things here the first of all and the doctor you don't get picked to be the doctor on the 15 person assassination team by accident so it might have been autopsies he was referring to or it might have been other beheadings it's not like the Saudi and doesn't do beheadings they do beheadings they do real fundamentalist version of Sharia law there's actually a lot of different variants of Sharia law and some are benign and some are terrible and the Saudi government practices a terrible kind the same kind that Isis practices and we go all we have to start a war with Isis and defense contractors got to get paid and we got to cause chaos in the Middle East well Saturday Arabia has very very similar conduct as Isis in terms of fundamentalist Sharia law beheadings public torture etc right an oppression of anyone living under their rule incredibly similar ideology but hey they're an ally and they got oil and they back Israel in us against Iran Wow so understand what you're dealing with here this is not likely to be the first time that the that it beheading has happened under the rule of Saudi Arabia this particular reign okay secondly animation the Turkish government doing slow leaks here why now that this is what other outlets can't really talk about this is our analysis but I will give New York Times credit for getting as close as they can it's because the Turkish government has not received their end of the bargain so I told you what the American government has gotten so far the Turks gave us pastor Brunson The Saturdays gave us a hundred million dollars that we asked for help in Syria they all happened at the same time and that's all we're told there are coincidences of course preposterous there are deals being made behind the scenes to assuage this situation but apparently the Turks have not and I said yesterday on the show so far publicly we haven't seen what the Turks have gotten and then they need to get something and they're holding the audio recordings in their back pocket as leverage you can see the show yesterday's show you can see me saying that and today they're leaking stuff because apparently they didn't get their end of the bargain so I love what the New York Times said about it they talked about how the investigators in Turkey are actually very well respected and so is their intelligence organization but the press unfortunately is not very free in Turkey used to be but not on this current government so then they explain the quote so the resumption of closures about mr. Kershaw B's disappearance is more likely to reflect a decision by the Turkish president than a burst of muckraking zeal it's exactly right it isn't like wow we find something how I got the leak no airdog office comes ingress alright they didn't give us the money we wanted or whatever it is that we wanted leaked this part leaked that part tell them about the fingers tell them about the beheading because they have the tapes right okay and they're holding onto the tapes as their last card look if the Saudis don't give us what we want whatever it is we release the tapes so that's the negotiation that's happening behind the scenes and finally there is one other negotiation going on independent of this but related to it our own TYT investigative reporting team broke the story the State Department is actively seeking US contractors to aid Saudi Arabian prison officials Wow oh boy and so apparently this is for the female prisons I hope we don't teach them to sever fingers while their people are still alive I hope we don't teach them that any of this torture is acceptable we've done torture in the past I'm sorry enhanced interrogation right right I guess Dick Cheney would also call this enhanced interrogation you know very enhanced interrogation what happened to khashoggi so check out that story we'll have a link down below for another great job by Ken clip and sign on TYT investigates but if we are giving aid and comfort to the Saudi government whether it's in executing that war in Yemen in covering up this crime or training him on prisons we should at a bare minimum reconsider that and and for sure make absolutely positive that we're teaching them the right things I mean it's as I say it it sounds preposterous they're not gonna listen to any right things it's a dictatorial government but somebody's gonna make money off this contract that's what's gonna happen thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a TYT member today for more exclusive content join now at TYT dot-com /join
