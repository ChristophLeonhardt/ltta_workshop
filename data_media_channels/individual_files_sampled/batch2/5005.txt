and we'll get to our top story which is that president Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani is not ruling out the possibility of a second meeting in 2016 about Russians peddling dirt to the honestly this family should step in throw grandpa from the Train all right he needs to go home that's a good movie about that money to stop people right someone needs to Stefan or you know what actually just Ferris Bueller Save Ferris I think people need in Washington decide in the Potomac save Rudy somebody close to Rudy needs to just take it you're interviewing Rudy you really need to be embarrassed if you don't have a follow-up that makes sense I've watched a couple of the interviews and it's been painful I'm sorry it's pathetic I don't know yourself actually good do you like really that's all they had do you laugh purple I love the laughing nervously wondering how exactly they can let him get away with it because it's so obviously painful anyway so anyhow something he raised us a five-minute wind-up for us now to give you the news I did four and a half incorrectly numerous television appearances yesterday by Rudy Giuliani he told The Daily Beast last night that he was heading off a story from the New York Times quoting from the report Giuliani said the journalists included Maggie Haberman who had reached out to the alleged pre-meeting meeting Giuliani said he and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow spent a great deal of time on Sunday trying to run the story down Giuliani said that he believes they managed to quote shut it down and help kill the story yet speculated the journalists had also found other reasons not to run the item for her part Maggie Haberman told The Daily Beast we don't talk about sourcing and wouldn't now but I have lost the threat of what the former mayor is talking about yet in his third and final Fox News interview yesterday it was like a trilogy Giuliani rams like the Arnon are much follow up at all just wow and he backed off his flat-out denials that senior Trump aids had discussed the Russians offer in an earlier meeting it wasn't another meeting that has been leaked but hasn't been a public yet okay I was a meeting an alleged meeting three days before according to calling according to the leak he says it was a meeting with Donald the junior with Jared Kushner with Paul Manafort with eight possibly two others in which they out of the presence of the president discussed the meeting with the Russian we checked with their lawyers the ones we could check with which was for the six that meeting never ever took place it didn't happen there's no there's no second meeting here it's highly unlikely I always have to leave the option open as a lawyer in case they come across with something that really startled us or feels some of the things that we feel are important run that clip again I actually look to the words try and listen to exact not what is right and what what's he saying here we'll hear it here let's look at it here we go maybe it'll make sense there's no there's no second meeting here it's highly unlikely I always have to leave the option open as a lawyer in case they come across with something that really startled us or fills some of the things that we feel are important another round I think Willie can translate what a joke is a friend of mine my drinks are free Rudy Giuliani is debating himself debating himself so it in the morning on CNN he raised the idea of the second meeting that came out of the blue to a lot of people I said what second meeting he put that on the table he says to preempt a New York Times story that we haven't seen yet and Maggie Haberman says I don't know what he's talking about then 12 hours later at night on Fox News he's shooting down the idea that he raised earlier that morning on CNN it's a debate all in his own the best part is he did it to kill a story that he just single-handedly brought to life yeah right but none of us were talking about that story he is talking about the story but again when he says well we shoot it down just in case we don't know about something that they know whether they did it or not Mike well it's just like Donald Trump lying about adoption getting everybody together on Air Force One to cover up the real meaning of the Don jr. meeting which Don junior said his father didn't know about get a little perjury issue there if in fact we find out that Donald Trump did all these people who say it's no big deal if Donald Trump knew about the meeting it's a big deal for Don junior because he committed perjury if that's the case but it's you know it's just like Trump lying about that meeting means that something went on in that meeting that they wanted to hide and and and now you've got Rudy saying well but but you know we're not gonna say it didn't happen because we don't know if they're not what you think do know whether it happened or not this is both incredibly taxing and incredibly tedious to have this put upon us this early in the day I mean he begins one of those segments by talking about a meeting that took place in the very same segment in the very same 30-second clip we played he goes from there was a meeting there was a meeting that occurred that we wanted to get out to get ahead of the news on it and in 10 seconds later he's calling it an alleged meeting as if the meaning that he district for it didn't take place I mean what time of night was he interviewed for that that's my question I don't know we have some questions yeah good one some of the worst vo of Rudy Giuliani I think I've ever seen we need to actually winning some glamorous look at that come on let's get some shots what's he doing with his reign I've seen that now for a couple we world series is that he's pulling in it or something my ID do we need to play it again you have any idea what he was saying and what would have your follow-up been had you been interviewing him well actually I think we could play even more because not only did he then confirm a meeting that none of us were talking about but he actually fleshed out some of the details in those meetings which was that apparently Michael Cohen may have been in Donald Trump's office when Don junior came and said hey we're about to meet with the Russians so he seemed to corroborate that and he also put gates potentially in the pre planning meeting which would be HUGE if true since as we all know gates Rick Gates who is Paul manna force business partner has been cooperating with a special counsel for several months which means that we don't have to rely just on Michael Cohen for this information that Rick Gates may have confirmed it and Muller may have known about it for a long time but the bottom line is that what we're seeing here is that the number of conspiratorial meetings around the Russians is increasing and so is the circle of Trump officials Trump campaign officials who participated in these conspiratorial meetings well at least he has Paul man afford citizens well there's that the first trial in the special council probe kicks off today with jury selection for a Paul Manafort the president's former campaign chair is accused of hiding at least thirty million dollars that he made before his days with Trump as an unregistered foreign lobbyist for Ukraine and its former pro-russian president we're told the prosecution plans to call 35 witnesses including agents from the FBI Treasury Department and IRS to show how man afford allegedly stashed his wealth in overseas banks to avoid paying US taxes last week a member of Robert Muller's team said he does not anticipate a government with witness will quote utter the word Russia during the trial but if mana Ford is convicted the special counsel could use it as leverage for him to talk about anything he knows pertaining to the Trump campaign and Russia the trial is expected to last about three weeks mana Ford also faces a separate trial on similar charges in Washington in September so Richard on call for him yeah and the question everybody has is why is he not pled yet he has seems to have absolutely no defense they've got him dead to center and after he goes through this in Virginia they know death Road in DC short answers I have no idea but there's so much apparent evidence against him that you either he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison or he's going to have to do some sort of a deal and again I don't know the you know I'm not a lawyer unlike you I am NOT a lawyer what the sequence has to be here but but clearly they've got a lot on mister metaphor yeah clearly they do and you know it's interesting thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the
