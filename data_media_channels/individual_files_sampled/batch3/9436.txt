Laura: NOW THE CLAIMS OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S THIRD ACCUSER, JULIE SWETNICK, ARE SO OUTLANDISH THAT WE WERE SKEPTICAL FROM THE START. THAT DOUBT SEEMS TO PRESSURE HAS NUMEROUS OF STORIES FROM HER PASTOR TRICKLE DOWN, ONE FROM OUR NEXT GUEST, RICHARD VINNECCY, THE EX-BOYFRIEND OF SEVEN YEARS, CLAIMING SHE THREATENED HIM AND HIS FAMILY. WE ARE JOINED IN A TELEVISION EXCLUSIVE BY MR. VINNECCY, ALONG WITH HIS LAWYER, MR. HANSON. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. RICHARD, WHAT ARE YOUR MOTIVATIONS FOR COMING FORWARD NOW? YES, THERE HAVE BEEN POLITICAL ISSUES. I WANT TO TELL THE TRUTH. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I CAME. Laura: NOW, YOU CLAIM, RICHARD, THAT MS. SWETNICK THREATENED YOU AFTER YOU BROKE UP WITH HER. WHAT TYPES OF THREATS THREATS ARE YOU ALLEGING? SHE BASICALLY CALLED ME MANY TIMES AND SAID YOU WILL NEVER, EVER SEE YOUR UNBORN CHILD ALIVE. AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO OVER THERE, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU GUYS. Laura: SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO KILL YOU? YES. AND THAT HAS TOLD ME A LITTLE BIT. Laura: WELL, YOU TOLD POLITICO ORIGINALLY, RICHARD, THAT SHE THREATENED YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR BABY. CORRECT. Laura: BUT YOU MENTALLY UNBORN CHILD, IS THAT RIGHT? I MEANT THE UNBORN CHILD. I WAS NOT MARRIED AT THE TIME WHEN THIS HAPPENED. Laura: DID SHE EVER DISCUSSED WITH YOU IN YOUR SEVEN YEAR RELATIONSHIP, FROM 1994-2001, THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, OR DID SHE MENTION EVER HAVING BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED? NEVER, NEVER ONCE SHE MENTION THAT TO ME. JUST TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING, SHE NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THAT AT ALL. Laura: DID SHE HAVE A POLITICAL BACKGROUND? WAS SHE INTERESTED IN POLITICS? NOT THAT I KNOW OF. YOU KNOW, SHE WAS ALWAYS WANTING TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO IMPRESS ME. SHE WAS EXAGGERATING EVERYTHING. IF ANYBODY KNOWS JULIE, EVERYTHING THAT CAME OUT OF HER MOUTH WAS JUST EXAGGERATIONS. SHE NEVER MENTIONED THAT TO ME AT ALL. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE. I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE HER MAKING THESE ACCUSATIONS BECAUSE SHE HAD NEVER, EVER MENTIONED THAT TO ME AT ALL. Laura: NOW, YOU FILED A RESTRAINING ORDER IN MARCH OF 2001 AFTER THESE THREATS. YOU SAID IN REPEATED PHONE CALLS TO YOU, THREATENING YOU, AND YOUR UNBORN CHILD AND YOUR FAMILY. BUT YOU NEVER FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT. YOU NEVER APPEARED IN COURT. IF YOU WERE SO THREATENED BY JULIE SWETNICK, YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND, THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU FOLLOW THROUGH? THAT IS A QUESTION THAT EVERYBODY IS ASKING. THE REASON I DIDN'T WAS BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SEE HER AGAIN. I TALKED AT THAT TIME TO MY FAMILY, AND WE DECIDED NOT TO DO ANYTHING. NOT TO FOLLOW THROUGH. I AM NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON, I KNEW THE TYPE OF PERSON JULIE IS, AND I WAS AFRAID, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. SO I JUST DECIDED TO LEAVE IT ALONE. I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO AWAY BECAUSE AT THAT TIME, THE ONLY THING I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WAS MY FAMILY. WE CHANGED OUR NUMBERS AND MOVED, AND THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT WE DID. AND WE NEVER HEARD FROM HER AGAIN. AND AFTER YOU CAME FORWARD AND THAT INITIAL INTERVIEW WITH POLITICO, DID YOU HEAR FROM ANY OF HER REPRESENTATIVES? OR DID YOU HEAR FROM HER AT ALL? NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. Laura: YOUR OWN CREDIBILITY HAS BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION, AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS, BY HER LAWYER, MICHAEL AVENATTI. HE APPEARED EARLIER TONIGHT ON CNN. LET'S WATCH. HER BOYFRIEND SAYS SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED, THAT IT'S A CREDIBILITY THING. SWETNICK CAN'T BE TRUSTED. IS THIS A THREAT TO YOU? NO, IT'S LUDICROUS, CHRIS, FIRST OF ALL. ONE LAWSUIT WAS FILED. IT WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED. THE CLAIMS BY HER EX-BOYFRIEND, I MEAN WHO DOESN'T HAVE AN EX-BOYFRIEND OR AN EX-GIRLFRIEND WHO MIGHT SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT THEM? Laura: WELL, AND EX-BOYFRIEND, YOU KNOW. IF BREAKUPS ARE BRUTAL, RIGHT? THEY CAN BE BRUTAL. IN YOUR CASE, IT WAS REALLY NOT FUN. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY YOU DON'T LIKE HER BECAUSE YOU WERE WITH HER FOR SEVEN YEARS AND THAT IT ABOUT ENDING. YEAH, THAT'S A LIKE I SAY BEFORE, IF ANYBODY KNOWS THE JULIE SWETNICK I KNOW, IF YOU ASKED ME PERSONALLY IF I BELIEVE HER, I DON'T BELIEVE HER. PERSONALLY, I DON'T BELIEVE HER. I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE HER. NOBODY KNOWS JULIE SWETNICK BETTER THAN ME. AND THE FACTS ARE THAT I KNOW HER. THAT IS WHY I CAME HERE TO TELL THE TRUTH. I KNOW HOW SHE IS. Laura: WELL, YOU WERE WITH HER FOR SEVEN YEARS. YOU ARE DESCRIBING HER LIKE SHE IS A TOTAL NIGHTMARE, BUT HE SPENT SEVEN YEARS WITH HER. FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS, WE HAD A NICE RELATIONSHIP. WE WEREN'T TOGETHER FOR SEVEN YEARS. WE WERE TOGETHER OFF AND ON FOR SEVEN YEARS. THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS, ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF, AND THEN ANOTHER COUPLE OF YEARS WE WERE IN BETHESDA. IT THEN TRANSFERRED TO PANAMA. I CAME BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER. WE WERE SEEING EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE. BUT THE MORE I SAW HER, THE MORE I SAW HER, I BASICALLY EXPERIENCED WHAT SHE WAS DOING. I JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT, AND THE FACT THAT SHE WAS LYING TO ME, SHE PRETTY MUCH TALKED ABOUT EVERYBODY. SHE TALKED ABOUT LAWSUITS. SHE WAS TRYING TO AT ONE POINT, I REMEMBER SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS FILING A LAWSUIT, HARASSMENT LAWSUIT AGAINST AMERICAN AIRLINES. I SAID YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP THIS LAWSUIT THING BECAUSE IT IS RIDICULOUS. SHE WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT HER FAMILY. SHE WOULD EVERY TIME WE WOULD GET INTO A FIGHT, SHE WOULD GET RIGHT IN MY FACE. SHE WOULD ASK ME TO HIT HER. I MEAN, THAT'S JUST REALLY WEIRD. MOST OF MY FRIENDS DID NOT LIKE HER. IN FACT, I CAN TESTIFY ABOUT THAT. Laura: HOLD ON, RICHARD. HOLD ON. SHE WAS LIKE "HIT ME?" WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT? I DON'T KNOW. FOR ANY MINOR ISSUES THAT WE HA HAD, SHE WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO MY FACE. THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS LIKE OH, MY GOD. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. SHE WOULD GET RIGHT IN MY FACE. SHE WOULD SAY "HIT ME." HIT ME, RICHARD. SHE WOULD SAY REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO MY EX-BOYFRIEND. I WOULD JUST WALK AWAY. IT WAS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO ME. Laura: RICHARD, RICHARD. I KNOW YOU'VE HAD SOME FINANCIAL ISSUES IN THE PAST, AND YOU HAVEN'T SHIED AWAY FROM THAT, CORRECT? YOU'VE BEEN UNDERWATER ON A MORTGAGE, YOU'VE HAD YOUR OWN ISSUES. THAT IS CORRECT. Laura: WHEN YOU WATCHED HER TESTIFY LAST WEEK, WHEN SHE WENT THROUGH THE VERY HEARTFELT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HER AT THE HANDS OF WHAT SHE SAID WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH, WAS WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND? WHEN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WAS THINK SHE SO CREDIBLE, SHE SO BELIEVABLE, YOU KNEW HER FOR SEVEN YEARS. WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WHEN I FIRST HEARD HER, HER NAME MENTIONED ON TV, I'M THINKING OH, MY GOD, . Laura: SHE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T EXCUSE ME, REFREEZE. SHE DIDN'T TESTIFY. WHEN YOU HEARD HER COME UP WITH THESE ALLEGATIONS THE HIDEOUS ATTACK IT, A GANG RAPE, A SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU HAVE BEEN WITH HER FOR SEVEN YEARS. DID SHE EVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT GANG RAPE? NEVER. NEVER. WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING. SHE NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THIS TO ME AT ALL. Laura: RICHARD, MARSIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TONIGHT.
