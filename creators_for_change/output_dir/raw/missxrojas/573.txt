years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> it raises a lot of</font>

93
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,120
philosophical questions about you know

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,070
people's ranking importance in society

95
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,070

99
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,140

I mean one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the universities I want to</font>

101

to 30,000 people apply for english

105
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,600
literature to studying English

106
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,970

107
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,680
matt from making self stand out and it's

108
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,670
just aa terrifying today was today was

109
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,870
like my first proper day of school

110
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,430
except what cover my lessons were

111
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,680
cancelled and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've officially dropped</font>

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,849
over females

113
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:23,419
no going back and here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

114
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:24,530
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course outlines for all</font>

115
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,180
subjects and philosophy you in

116
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular we do things like political</font>

117
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">philosophy would do mill on liberty and</font>

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,069
then we have a synoptic unit which is

119
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:34,900
like a four-hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> essay and then in</font>

120
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,190
English as well we do things like we're

121
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing Hamlet appropriate and John Clare</font>

122
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,370
and our synoptic unit is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a war poetry</font>

123
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,220
and then we do unit which is like

124
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,199
comparing text and you get to pick this

125
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,120
text which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course work which I'm</font>

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">really looking forward to so that's cool</font>

127
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,050
but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what strikes me this amount of</font>

128
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,009
reading and going to have to do next

129
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,810
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I read a lot already but</font>

130
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,190
this is just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be out as well</font>

131
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,060
anyway is that really much else to say

132
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,990
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Haley teleport here right now it's</font>

133
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">not very far it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a few miles or so</font>

134
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:17,360
oh well oh boy does not to say that I

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,889
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have so much fun with everyone</font>

136
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,360
who I did me up with today we did a

137
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,039
little a science museum for about 15

138
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,270
minutes they were closing everything

139
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,849
such a shame one day I will relive my

140
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,349
childhood and gather properly we went to

141
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,569
lots of places and my feet<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of</font>

142
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,310
hurting because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked really</font>

143
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,889
impractical shoes sometimes all the time

144
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,590
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let go ahead is this rooty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

145
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,500
know how much you can tell but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

146
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,830
kind of shaking it to get into the light

147
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,469
yeah not as many big thick 2-inch roots

148
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:48,979
as they were before which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good</font>

149
00:05:48,979 --> 00:00:00,000
thing if you ask me
