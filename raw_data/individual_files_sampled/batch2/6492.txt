happy Monday I'm gonna be a painful male feminist allied guy on the internet today and say a couple things about Serena Williams losing the US Open against Naomi Osaka because I read a couple articles on tennis and now I'm a tennis expert so Serena got penalized the air for a practice called coaching which is when your coaches in the stands guiding YouTube it closes the net and other tennis stuff which for some reason is apparently illegal during Grand Slam so the famous umpire Carlos Ramos docked serena point and then when serena reacted by slamming her racket later on and calling him a thief he dr. two more points costing her the game now was serena coached her coach says she didn't see it even though he was trying to signal her but apparently everyone does this which makes this a case of selective enforcement even though the umpires call was accurate but the two additional calls made the umpires bias much more apparent by the way i unlike ninja play video games was looming all the time on my twitch which is a sidebar but definitely makes me a hero and also brave but back to the story i thought he took a game for me but I've seen other men call other umpires several things Serena's right well Carlos Ramos seems like the classic hard-ass ref there have been plenty of identical high profile incidents where he wasn't nearly as hard on the players involved here's Djokovic at the French Open for example in an argument with the same umpire no points docked here's Djokovic again with Ramos at the Wimbledon finals this year yells at him no points talk here's Nick Kyrgios at the French Open getting a warning by Ramos for yelling at a ball boy and then screaming at Ramos just the warning no penalty here's Andy Murray getting only one code violation for calling Ramos stupid fears in the dog getting a warning for threatening him God tennis has so many weird rules but if there's one thing that's consistent it's that people get really mad at Carlos Ramos but there is another inconsistency here while all the penalties Ramos imposed on Serina were technically legitimate the question is whether these rules are similarly enforced against other players as a black female athletes arena has historically been subjected to different treatment from being booed and hearing the n-word screamed at her to facing excessive scrutiny for her outfit choices which is part of the reason why she was featured on the now infamous Nike commercial to begin with only a couple weeks ago her full body cat suit was banned from the French Open but in 1985 a full body cat suit received praise when an white war won during Wimbledon I can't get over how ridiculous these rules are in tennis also I mean just look at this cartoon depicting Serina as a minstrel guard tune anyway my point is this kind of double standard exists in all aspects of life from the workplace to policing and even professional sports lacks enforcement in certain instances but not in others is usually a sign of implicit bias the rules aren't fair if they're not applied evenly the bias of overcorrecting sarena while being lenient on others is similar to the bias for example cops exhibit when arresting black people that's why in both instances you hear calls for order rather than calls for justice from those who unwittingly benefit from upholding the status quo force arena and many other women this double standard also exists off the courts when men are emotional they're passionate heroes when women are emotional they're hysterical ultimately what I feel bad about the most here is the fact that 20 year-old Naomi Osaka's victory against her childhood idol is now forever tainted by conversations about Carlos Ramos I'm a psalm piker if this double standard offends you please share this video with your friends and also please leave your thoughts in the comment section below for a longer conversation please join my twitch I'm live every day from 7 p.m. Pacific to 10 p.m. Pacific and if you want to fund independent media please go to T YT comm slash join to join our membership and this has been the breakdown want to see more videos like this well then subscribe to the T YT channel below also don't forget to become a TYT member you can get access for as little as $4.99 a month also download the TYT Plus app on your phone or head over to TYT dot-com /join today
