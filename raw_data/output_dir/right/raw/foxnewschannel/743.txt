1
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:34,792
>> Martha: ANY MINUTE,

2
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:35,493
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SET TO TAKE

3
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,193
THE STAGE IN SOUTH CAROLINA TO

4
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:36,894
RALLY VOTES FOR GOVERNOR HENRY

5
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:37,528
McMASTER, WHOM HE STRONGLY

6
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:37,895
SUPPORTS.

7
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:38,629
BUT WHILE WE WAIT FOR THAT, MARK

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,330
WARNER REPORTING LAY JOKING TO

9
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,499
SAYING "IF YOU GET ME ONE MORE

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,199
GLASS OF WINE, I WILL TELL YOU

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,867
STUFF ONLY BOB MUELLER AND I

12
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:43,167
KNOW.

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:43,868
IF YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN WILD

14
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:44,602
STUFF SO FAR, BUCKLE UP, IT WILL

15
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,269
BE A WILD COUPLE OF MONTHS."

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,936
SO DOES HE KNOW SOMETHING WE

17
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:46,237
DON'T?

18
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:46,937
HERE NOW IS JONATHAN SWANN, A

19
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:47,605
NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER.

20
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:48,139
WHAT ABOUT THAT COMMENT BY MIKE

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,172
WHAT ABOUT THAT COMMENT BY MIKEA

22
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:48,405
WHAT ABOUT THAT COMMENT BY MIKEK

23
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:48,739
WARNER?

24
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,406
>> JOKES ASIDE, HE PROBABLY

25
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:50,107
KNOWS VERY LITTLE COMPARED TO

26
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:50,508
BOB MUELLER.

27
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,242
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HIERARCHY OF

28
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:51,976
PEOPLE THAT KNOW, IT'S NO SECRET

29
00:00:51,977 --> 00:00:52,676
THAT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

30
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,377
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NEAR THE

31
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:54,578
POWERS THAT BOB MUELLER HAS, AND

32
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,279
PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE HAVE

33
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,415
JOKED TO ME THAT THEY DON'T KNOW

34
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,450
PROBABLY 50% OF WHAT BOB MUELLER

35
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:00,384
KNOWS.

36
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:01,986
SO THERE ARE PROBABLY VERY FEW

37
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:03,587
THINGS THAT JUST HE AND BOB

38
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,592
>> Martha: HOW SIGNIFICANT IS

39
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:10,995
PETER STRZOK AND HAVING HIM IN

40
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:11,996
FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE ON

41
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:12,596
WEDNESDAY?

42
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:15,132
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A HUGE

43
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:15,533
DEVELOPMENT.

44
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,967
HE HAS SAID HE IS WILLING TO

45
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:22,706
>> I THINK IT WILL BE ONE OF THE

46
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,342
MOST POLITICALLY EXPLOSIVE

47
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:27,845
HEARINGS CERTAINLY OF THE YEAR,

48
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:29,113
PERHAPS THE LAST COUPLE OF

49
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:30,147
YEARS.

50
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:33,184
WE HAVE A LOT OF MEMBERS WHO ARE

51
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:35,386
DEEPLY ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE.

52
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,354
PEOPLE LIKE JIM JORDAN, MARK

53
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:39,523
MEADOWS, THEY WILL BE VERY WELL

54
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:41,625
PREPARED AND VERY AGGRESSIVE IN

55
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:42,526
THEIR QUESTIONING, EVEN TREY

56
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:44,595
GOWDY WHO HAS BEEN MUCH MORE

57
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:45,863
MODERATE GENERALLY SPEAKING AS

58
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,364
OUTRAGED BY THIS ISSUE.

59
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:49,900
SO HE'S GOING TO COME UNDER

60
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,601
INTENSE QUESTIONING.

61
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:53,237
AND THERE IS A A LOT OF MATERIAL

62
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,405
TO WORK WITH.

63
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,639
>> Martha: TREY GOWDY HAS BEEN

64
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,208
VERY RESPECTFUL OF ROBERT

65
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,642
MUELLER AND HIS PROCESS, HE

66
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:00,144
HASN'T WANTED TO CRITICIZE THAT

67
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:01,445
IN ANY WAY.

68
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:02,780
BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT IG REPORT

69
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:05,549
HE WAS QUITE CLEAR THAT HE WAS

70
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,817
HORRIFIED BY THE WAY THAT THIS

71
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:10,321
HIGH LEVEL FBI AGENT WAS TALKING

72
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:11,555
ABOUT THE CASES THAT HE WAS

73
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:12,923
COVERING.

74
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,958
HERE'S A QUOTE FROM CHERYL

75
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,659
ATKINSON, WHO WROTE A COLUMN

76
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,730
ABOUT IT IN "THE HILL" TODAY.

77
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:22,566
SHE WRITES, "THE EARTH

78
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:26,704
HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL ALLEGEDLY

79
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:28,472
CONSPIRING TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME

80
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:31,175
OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION."

81
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:33,577
AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE IG

82
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:34,678
INVESTIGATION, HE WOULD LIKELY

83
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,117
TRUMP TODAY.

84
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,652
THOUGHTS ON THAT?

85
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:44,355
>> ANY FAIR READING OF THAT

86
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:45,489
REPORT, A READER WHO IS NOT

87
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,359
COLORED BIPARTISAN OBJECTIVES,

88
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,995
IF YOU JUST READ THE REPORT WITH

89
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:52,263
INTELLECTUAL HONESTY, YOU'LL

90
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,565
FIND THINGS IN THERE THAT HE HAS

91
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,766
SAID PRIVATELY THAT ARE

92
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:56,166
DISTURBING.

93
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,801
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE IN A

94
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,103
SENIOR INVESTIGATOR.

95
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:01,238
I CHALLENGE ANYONE TO SAY THAT,

96
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,173
AFTER A FAIR READING OF THAT

97
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,742
REPORT, THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE.

98
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:06,577
THAT BEING SAID TO COME UP THERE

99
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:11,382
AS AN INVESTIGATOR TO PUT HIS

100
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:12,983
THUMB ON THIS, BECAUSE IT'S

101
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,184
CLEAR WHERE HIS MIND WAS.

102
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,186
IT'S CLEAR WHAT HE WANTED TO

103
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:17,388
HAPPEN.

104
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:18,789
THE MISSING PIECE IS THE ACTION.

105
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,190
>> Martha: EVERYONE IS

106
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:21,325
FAMILIAR WITH THE TEXT MESSAGES,

107
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,994
WE CAN PUT THEM ON THE SCREEN.

108
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,429
THE ONE WHERE HE SAID, TRUMP IS

109
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,831
NEVER GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT,

110
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,799
RIGHT, RIGHT?

111
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,502
AND THE RESPONSE FROM PAGE, NO,

112
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,803
WE WILL STOP IT.

113
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:36,173
ACTUALLY THAT WAS THE OTHER WAY

114
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:36,774
AROUND.

115
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:37,474
STRZOK WAS ANSWERING THEM.

116
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:41,345
AND THE ONE WE SAW I TELL MIKE A

117
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,579
LONG TIME AGO.

118
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,581
I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T TAKE THAT

119
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:45,950
RISK, IT'S LIKE AN INSURANCE

120
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:46,617
POLICY IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT

121
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:48,185
THAT YOU WILL DIE BEFORE YOUR

122
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:48,452
40.

123
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,554
SO THE QUESTION IS, HOW DID HE

124
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:55,359
ACT ON THAT?

125
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,328
AND I THINK ONE OF THE

126
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,762
INTERESTING THINGS IS GOING TO

127
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:00,164
BE AT THE QUESTIONS THAT GO

128
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:00,564
AROUND.

129
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,533
HOW DID YOU TREAT THE TWO

130
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,200
INVESTIGATIONS DIFFERENTLY?

131
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,202
BECAUSE HE WAS CENTRAL IN THE

132
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,503
HILLARY INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS

133
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:09,139
BEING CENTRAL IN THE

134
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,807
TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

135
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:11,775
AND OF THE TREATMENT APPEARS TO

136
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:12,977
BE VERY DIFFERENT.

137
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:15,179
>> YES, BUT DIFFERENT IN A WAY

138
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,981
CERTAINLY DURING THE CAMPAIGN

139
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:18,983
SEASON THAT WAS ACTUALLY

140
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:19,782
ADVANTAGEOUS TO DONALD TRUMP.

141
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,218
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT

142
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:21,986
DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WAS

143
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:23,420
UNDER THE STATION DURING THE

144
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,789
CAMPAIGN AND WE SURE KNEW ABOUT

145
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,323
THE HILLARY CLINTON

146
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:26,957
INVESTIGATION.

147
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,859
SO THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE WHERE

148
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,994
THERE IS A MISSING LINK.

149
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:32,796
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THAT

150
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:33,998
HILLARY'S PEOPLE WERE

151
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,433
INVESTIGATED, AND THE FACT THAT

152
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:41,572
THEY BEGAN PUTTING TOGETHER THAT

153
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,840
SHE WAS GUILTY BEFORE THE EVEN

154
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:44,508
SPOKE TO HER, I WOULD IMAGINE

155
00:04:44,509 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL GET QUESTIONS ASKING AND
