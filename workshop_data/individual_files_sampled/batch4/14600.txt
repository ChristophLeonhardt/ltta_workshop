say did you know that today is our third birthday at the rebel we were launched on February 16 2015 out of the ashes of the Sun News Network that was killed by the government's TV regulator here's the very first video we did taped in my living room it was a pretty humble beginning but we've done a lot since then because of you in fact we've broadcast more than seven thousand nine hundred videos since then hundreds of millions of views well on the way to two billion minutes of video watched and from around the world whether it was Sheila GaN reads reporting from the UN global warming conferences in Morocco and Germany or our visit to the beleaguered Christian community that our Isis targeted for ethnic cleansing in Iraq or our work covering the islamification of the United Kingdom we've gone pretty far from my living room but our heart is in Canada whether it's been our coverage of Rachel Notley and the NDP destroyers in Alberta or Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals who turned the once-great Ontario economy into a have-not province or a refusal to join the cheerleading squad for Justin Trudeau and his socks we're not afraid to say the emperor has no clothes it's not just that we're conservative it's that we're the only people even talking about certain issues we were the first to ring the alarm bell about m103 Trudeau's censorship motion against Islamophobia when so many so-called conservatives were going along with the carbon tax we held the line most conservative politicians and conservative journalists are terrified to criticize Canada's open border immigration or the proliferation of niqab xand hijabs not us we're even making friends where people least expected which is why so many people want to silence us Rachel Notley sent her armed sheriff to stop us the Prime Minister's senior a Gerald buds called us Nazis just for mocking Trudeau's people kind gaffe that's an outrageous slur against me given that I'm Jewish in fact the hill times annual survey of Ottawa insiders says the rebel is the media that they most want to silence in Ottawa now our budget is one one thousandth the size of the CBC's but they just can't stop talking about us so I'm wondering why do you go on rebel media after after charlotte's you don't think we should talk to people and write Justin Trudeau himself obsesses over us when it comes to civil discourse when it comes to the kinds of back and forth that happens in this house it's a real shame to see the Conservatives using lines straight out a rebel magazine and rebel webcast the rebel should not be writing commentary and questions for the members opposite they should know to disassociate themselves from that kind of politics and those kinds of personal attack he got so flustered he called us a magazine boy they want to kill us Trudeau was even bullying Facebook now telling them to crack down on new sources that criticized him demanding that Facebook censor news he doesn't like obviously he means us but you know what even though the mainstream media and the state broadcaster and the Liberals and the NDP and even a lot of red Tories want us to lay down and die we're not going to in fact we're growing because we give our viewers the truth and we tell them the other side of this story and 2018 is going to be our best year yet we've got Katie Hopkins now that tell it like it is commentator from the UK and Sebastian Gorka the former counterterrorism adviser who served as the deputy assistant to President Trump and we're going to expand our Canadian coverage to reporting on the conservative campaigns to take back Alberta and Ontario it's going to be an exciting year but it's hard YouTube has cut off our advertising for political reasons our competitors are all lining up for government subsidies from Justin Trudeau in this month Canadian budget including even newspapers like the National Post and the Toronto Sun and the Calgary Sun we will never take money from Trudeau ever that keeps us independent and it also keeps us poor we really are the only alternative to the government media in this country or at least we will be if the next budget has payoffs for the rest of the media can you please help us they're trying to kill us as you can see Justin Trudeau Rachel Notley Kathleen Wynne Gerald butts and about 90% of the other journalists in Canada -
