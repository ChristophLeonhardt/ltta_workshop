WE DO, AND VERY VERY FAR 

378
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,874
DISTANCE IN THIS CASE, JOBS ARE 

379
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,941
VERY IMPORTANT IN ALL CASES, 

380
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,811
BUT IN THIS CASE, MILITARY 

381
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,845
MIGHT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 

382
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,815
EVEN JOBS, BUT ALL OF THIS 

383
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,584
EQUIPMENT IS MADE RIGHT HERE IN 

384
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,786
THE U.S.A. 

385
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,456
AND IT'S THE BEST  EQUIPMENT ON 

386
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:55,427
EARTH, AND NOBODY MAKES IT LIKE 

387
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:55,660
WE DO. 

388
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,896
YOU HAVE $716 BILLION SO 

389
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,196
CONGRATULATIONS. 

390
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,040
AMERICA IS A PEACEFUL NATION 

391
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,075
BUT IF CONFLICT IS FORCED UPON 

392
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:16,649
US, WE WILL FIGHT AND WE WILL 

393
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,682
WIN, RIGHT, GENERAL? 

394
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:17,916
RIGHT? 

395
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,518
BETTER BELIEVE IT, GENERALS. 

396
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,152
THEY'RE THE GUYS. 

397
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,620
WE'RE POWERED BY THE 

398
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,790
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE OF THE UNITED

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,290

400
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,191
VERY SPECIAL. 

401
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,960
WITH THIS NEW AUTHORIZATION, WE 

402
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,829
WILL INCREASE THE SIZE AND 

403
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,565

AND WE WILL REPLACE AGING 

410
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:51,183

00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,591
DEVELOPED AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE 

414
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,093
SO STRONG WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO 

415
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:05,664
USE IT BUT IF WE EVER DID, 

416
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,032
NOBODY HAS A CHANCE. 

417
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,537
IT ALL INCLUDES 135 BRAND NEW 

418
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,941

THAT'S STEALTH. 

426
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,966
I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF PILOTS, 

427
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,267
GREAT PILOTS, I SAID HOW ARE 

428
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:42,467
THEY. 

429
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,169
THEY SAID THEY'RE HARD TO BEAT 

430
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,370
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THEM. 

431
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,238
IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO BEAT THE 

432
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,640
ENEMY WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE IT. 

433
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,144
THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD. 

434
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,614

LATERAL COMBAT SHIPS. 

440
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,297
FUNDING TO MODERNIZE OUR 

441
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,733
NUCLEAR ARSENAL, SO IMPORTANT. 

442
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,635
WE'RE DOING A MAJOR UPGRADE OF 

443
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,268
OUR MISSILE DEFENSE. 

444
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:20,839
WE'RE SPENDING A TREMENDOUS 

445
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,809
AMOUNT OF MONEY ON OUR NUCLEAR 

446
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,076
ARSENAL. 

447
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:24,643
NOBODY WILL HAVE CLOSE. 

448
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:30,983
WE WILL HOPEFULLY NEVER EVER 

449
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,650
HAVE TO USE IT. 

450
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,651
BUT NOBODY WILL BE CLOSE. 

451
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,787
MORE THAN $11 BILLION FOR THE 

452
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:37,289
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, 

453
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,957
INCLUDING FAMILY HOUSING AND WE 

454
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,193
ARE PROUDLY GIVING OUR TROOPS 

455
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,361
THE BIGGEST PAY INCREASE IN A 

456
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,797
DECADE, AND I KNOW YOU DON'T 

457
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,597
WANT IT BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY 

458
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,132
PATRIOTIC, YOU'LL SAY JUST SAVE 

459
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,801
THE MONEY, WE'RE GOING TO PAY 

460
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:50,134
DOWN DEBT. 

461
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:55,841
DOES ANYBODY NOT WANT IT, 

462
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,843
PLEASE RAISE YOUR HANDS. 

463
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:58,710
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. 

464
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,013
ARE THESE REAL PATCH, I DON'T 

465
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:01,380
KNOW, GENERAL. 

466
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,014
I DON'T KNOW. 

467
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,515
IT'S THE BIGGEST INCREASE IN A 

468
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:03,748
DECADE. 

469
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:05,984
A STRONG MILITARY ALSO REQUIRES 

470
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,719
A STRONG ECONOMY AND OUR 

471
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,555
ECONOMY IS SETTING RECORDS LIKE 

472
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,790
NEVER BEFORE. 

473
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,896
WE HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY 

474
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:18,463
WE'VE EVER HAD. 

475
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:21,300
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP IN 

476
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,866
A LOT OF WAYS. 

477
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,869
IT HELPS IN FUNDING AND DOING 

478
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,670
GREAT THINGS FOR THE MILITARY. 

479
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,405
WE HAVE CREATED 4 MILLION NEW 

480
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,539
JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION, A 

481
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,843
NUMBER THAT THE MEDIA IN THE 

482
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:43,388
BACK WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID 

483
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,125
WOULD BE POSSIBLE. 

484
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:46,858
IF DURING THE CAMPAIGN. 

485
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,493
I'M SO PROUD OF MYSELF, I 

486
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,730
DIDN'T CALL THEM THE FAKE NEWS 

487
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:51,963
MEDIA. 

488
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,365
I DIDN'T CALL THEM. 

489
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,434
I SAID TO MYSELF, I WILL NOT 

490
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,236
TODAY IN FRONT OF OUR GREAT 

491
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,971
ARMED FORCES CALL THEM FAKE 

492
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,171
NEWS. 

493
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,906
WE KNOW THE REAL TRUTH, BUT WE 

494
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,142
WON'T SAY IT TODAY. 

495
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,978
BUT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED 

496
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,411
IT POSSIBLE. 

497
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,713
4MILLION NEW JOBS, NOBODY WOULD 

498
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:12,651
HAVE THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLE ON 

499
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,151
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. 

500
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,152
IF WHEN WE WERE CAMPAIGNING, 

501
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,454
MIKE, IF I WOULD HAVE SAID 

502
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,322
THAT, IF I WOULD HAVE SAID 2 

503
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,957
MILLION NEW JOBS, PEOPLE WOULD 

504
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,125
HAVE LAUGHED US OFF THE STAGE, 

505
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:24,329
BUT WE HAVE 4 MILLION NEW JOBS. 

506
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:29,368
SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD OF, 

507
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,736
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC 

508
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,105
AMERICAN, AND ASIAN ASIAN-

509
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:33,705
AMERICAN, THE UNEMPLOYMENT 

510
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,307
RATES FOR ALL THREE HAVE 

511
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:43,148
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS IN 

512
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,248
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

513
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:44,782
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-

514
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:45,416
AMERICANS, HISPANICS, ASIANS, 

515
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:52,157
THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY 

516
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,058
OF OUR COUNTRY. 

517
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:53,992
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOT, 

518
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,262
I'M SORRY, DOING QUITE AS WELL. 

519
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:01,166
IT'S ONLY THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 

520
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:01,533
65 YEARS. 

521
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,303
SO WE'RE NOT DOING AS WELL. 

522
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:04,969
BUT WE'LL DO BETTER. 

523
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,438
I THINK WITHIN ABOUT THREE 

524
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,874
WEEKS WHEN THE NEW NUMBERS COME 

525
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:13,578
OUT, YOU'LL PROBABLY BE LOWEST 

526
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:14,079
IN HISTORY ALSO. 

527
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,480
VERY IMPORTANTLY, THE VETERANS 

528
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,080
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RECENTLY 

529
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,453
REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 

530
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,154
NEARLY 20 YEARS. 

531
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:22,987
IT'S A BIG ONE. 

532
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,393
AND WE ARE CREATING 

533
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:28,960
MANUFACTURING JOBS AGAIN. 

534
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,562
REMEMBER DURING THE CAMPAIGN, 

535
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,365
THEY SAID, OH, YOU CAN'T CREATE 

536
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:33,798
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

537
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:34,432
I SAID, REALLY? 

538
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,601
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THINGS 

539
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:37,502
ANYMORE. 

540
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,004
IS THAT WHAT IT'S COME TO? 

541
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,172
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OTHER 

542
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,139
COUNTRIES MAKE THINGS AND WE'RE 

543
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,574
GOING TO BUY THEM, AND THEY'RE 

544
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,543
GOING TO HAVE THE JOBS AND 

545
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,010
WE'RE NOT. 

546
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,711
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. 

547
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,880
WE'RE DOING MANUFACTURING JOBS 

548
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,119
AT THE FASTEST PACE IN MANY 

549
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,452
MANY DECADES. 

550
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:57,155
NO LONGER ARE WE APOLOGIZING 

551
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:57,755
FOR AMERICA. 

552
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,158
INSTEAD, WE ARE NOW STANDING UP 

553
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:00,491
FOR AMERICA. 

554
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:07,466
IT'S CALLED AMERICA FIRST, IF 

555
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,900
THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. 

556
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,903
WE'RE STANDING UP FOR OUR 

557
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,540
MILITARY AND WE'RE STANDING UP 

558
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,278
FOR OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. 

559
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,850
WE'RE STANDING FOR OUR FLAG. 

560
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,386
THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ENDURED 

561
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:27,819
CONTINUOUS COMBAT. 

562
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,155
FOR THE PAST 17 YEARS, YET 

563
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,592
SINCE THE 1990s, THE NUMBER OF 

564
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,561
SOLDIERS ON ACTIVE DUTY WAS CUT 

565
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,495
BY MORE THAN ONE-THIRD. 

566
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:38,530
OUR BASES AND VITAL EQUIPMENT 

567
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,099
WERE ALLOWED TO FALL INTO A 

568
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,869
STATE OF DISREPAIR, AND I SAW 

569
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,670
SOME OF THEM, TOTAL DISREPAIR. 

570
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,038
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 

571
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,942
EVERY DAY THE ARMY IS FIGHTING 

572
00:21:50,942 --> 00:22:02,254
FOR US AND NOW WE ARE FIGHTING 

573
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:02,687
FOR YOU 100%. 

574
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:04,022
NO ONE BETTER UNDERSTANDS HOW 

575
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,690
STRETCHED OUR MILITARY HAS 

576
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,659
BECOME THAN THE SOLDIERS OF THE 

577
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,594
10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION. 

578
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,361
IS THAT RIGHT, GENERAL? 

579
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:12,164
YOU WERE THE FIRST CONVENTIONAL 

580
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,665
COMBAT FORCE TO DEPLOY AFTER 

581
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:13,865
9/11. 

582
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,736
SINCE THEN, NO DIVISION IN THE 

583
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,705
ARMY HAS BEEN DEPLOYED MORE 

584
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:23,909
TIMES TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 

585
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:24,209
THAN YOU. 

586
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,011
YOU'VE SENT OVER 9000 

587
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:26,778
COURAGEOUS SOLDIERS TO 26 

588
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,147
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, ALL AROUND 

589
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,650
THE WORLD IN THE PAST YEAR 

590
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:31,883
ALONE. 

591
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,853
THE SECOND BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM 

592
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,588
JUST RETURNED FROM A ROTATION 

593
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,523
AT THE JOINT READINESS TRAINING 

594
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:38,790
CENTER. 

595
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,461
AND LATER THIS YEAR, THEY WILL 

596
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,197
ONCE AGAIN BRAVELY ANSWER OUR 

597
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,799
NATION'S CALL AND DEPLOY TO 

598
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,132
AFGHANISTAN. 

599
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,768
THROUGH IT ALL, YOU HAVE PROVEN 

600
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,738
TO THE WORLD, TO OUR COUNTRY, 

601
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:57,275
TO YOUR FAMILIES, THAT FORT 

602
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,110
DRUM SOLDIERS AREN'T JUST 

603
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,845
TOUGH. 

604
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:05,750
YOU'RE MOUNTAIN TOUGH. 

605
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,319
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. 

606
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:07,719
YOU'RE MOUNTAIN TOUGH. 

607
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,225
I SAID TO YOU, GENERAL, WHAT'S 

608
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,259
THE DIFFERENCE. 

609
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,261
HE SAID, SIR, TRUST ME. 

610
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:17,796
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. 

611
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,731
I SAID I TRUST YOU, RIGHT? 

612
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,401
I SAID DON'T GO INTO IT. 

613
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,436
I TRUST YOU. 

614
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,971
ONE OF THOSE SOLDIERS IS 

615
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:33,645
SPECIALIST BRADEN COOK, WHO WAS 

616
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:37,415

617
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:37,815
WHERE'S BRADEN. 

618
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:40,418
OH, BRADEN, GOOD LOCATION, 

619
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:40,651
BRADEN. 

620
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:42,687
LAST OCTOBER HIS TEAM CAME 

621
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,991

622
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:51,596

623
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,164
STRONGHOLDS IN VARIOUS 

624
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:54,166
LOCATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN. 

625
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,767
AND AN AFGHAN SOLDIER FIGHTING 

626
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,803
ALONGSIDE U.S. TROOPS WAS BADLY 

627
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,605
WOUNDED WHEN AN EXPLOSIVE 

628
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,005
DETONATED NEARBY. 

629
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,908
SPECIALIST COOK BRAVED THE HAIL 

630
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,609
OF BULLETS AND MORTAR ROUNDS 

631
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:04,909
ALL OVER. 

632
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:07,779
THEY SAID IT WAS ALL OVER. 

633
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,514
IT WAS HEAVY FIRE. 

634
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,183
SAVING THE LIFE OF THAT WOUNDED 

635
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:15,287

IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AMERICA'S

MILITARY SUPREMACY, WE MUST 

719
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,849

WE'LL BE CATCHING THEM VERY 

735
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:04,715

00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,352
THEY WANT TO JAM TRANSMISSIONS, 

737
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,186
WHICH THREATEN OUR BATTLEFIELD 

738
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,554
OPERATIONS AND SO MANY OTHER 

739
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:09,787
THINGS. 

740
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:11,856
WE WILL BE SO FAR AHEAD OF THEM 

741
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,527
IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, 

742
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,294
YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN. 

743
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,029
CHINA EVEN LAUNCHED A NEW 

744
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,699
MILITARY DIVISION TO OVERSEE IT 

745
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,935
WAR FIGHTING PROGRAMS IN SPACE. 

746
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,472
JUST LIKE THE AIR, THE LAND, 

747
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,042
THE SEA, SPACE HAS BECOME A WAR 

748
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:31,575
FIGHTING DOMAIN. 

749
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:34,979
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MERELY HAVE 

750
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:35,846
AN AMERICAN PRESENCE IN SPACE. 

751
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:38,183
WE MUST HAVE AMERICAN DOMINANCE 

752
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,584
IN SPACE. 

753
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,352
AND THAT IS WHY JUST A FEW DAYS 

754
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,889
AGO THE VICE PRESIDENT OUTLINED 

755
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,757
MY ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO 

756
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,527
CREATE A 6TH BRANCH OF THE 

757
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,864
UNITED STATES MILITARY CALLED 

758
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,965
THE UNITED STATES SPACE FORCE. 

759
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,844
GOT TO GET IT, JOE. 

760
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:07,177
RIGHT, JOE? 

761
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:07,411
RIGHT? 

762
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:08,813
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEXT 

763
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,783
GREAT CHAPTER IN HISTORY IS 

764
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,986
WRITTEN BY THE HEROES OF THE 

765
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:15,720
UNITED STATES MILITARY. 

766
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,189
AMERICA WILL ALWAYS RISE TO 

767
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,825
EVERY CHALLENGE, AND OVERCOME 

768
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,160
EVERY DANGER BECAUSE WE ARE 

769
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,463
BACKED BY THE STRENGTH AND 

770
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,431
POWER OF THE AMERICAN SOLDIER. 

771
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:30,668
SPEAKING TO HIS TROOPS, GENERAL 

772
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,370
GEORGE PATTON, A GREAT ONE, 

773
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,738
ONCE SAID WE HAVE THE FINEST 

774
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,072
EQUIPMENT AND THE BEST SPIRIT, 

775
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:37,975
AND THE BEST MEN IN THE WORLD. 

776
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,644
NOW, IF IT WERE TODAY, HE WOULD 

777
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,646
BE SAYING THE BEST MEN AND 

778
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:42,546
WOMEN IN THE WORLD. 

779
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:45,383
THINGS DO CHANGE, BUT THAT WAS 

780
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:50,054
QUITE A STATEMENT MANY YEARS 

781
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:50,254
AGO. 

782
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:51,155
CONTINUING HIS REMARKS, PATTON 

783
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:52,891
THEN DECLARED, I DON'T WANT TO 

784
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:56,628
GET ANY MESSAGES SAYING I AM 

785
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,095
HOLDING MY POSITION. 

786
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,965
WE ARE NOT HOLDING A DAMN 

787
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,500
THING. 

788
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,670
WE ARE ADVANCING CON CANTILY. 

789
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,270
-- CONSTANTLY. 

790
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,104
THAT WAS PATTON. 

791
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,107
NEARLY 75 YEARS LATER, PATTON'S 

792
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:09,841
WORDS STILL RING TRUE. 

793
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,743
AMERICA HAS THE BEST EQUIPMENT 

794
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,010
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 

795
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,180
WE HAVE THE BEST SPIRIT, THE 

796
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,949
BEST SOLDIERS EVER TO SET FOOT 

797
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,250
ON ANY BATTLEFIELD ANYWHERE AT 

798
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,817
ANY TIME. 

799
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,618
WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL. 

800
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:23,020
WE ARE THE BEST FUNDED. 

801
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,923
WE ARE THE BIGGEST. 

802
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:29,494
WE ARE THE STRONGEST, WE ARE 

803
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:29,827
THE SMARTEST. 

804
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:32,130
AND WE ARE STILL NOT HOLDING A 

805
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,432
DAM THING BECAUSE AMERICA IS ON 

806
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,836
THE MOVE ONCE AGAIN, AND WE ARE 

807
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:39,236
NOT BACKING DOWN. 

808
00:30:39,236 --> 00:30:40,471
OUR COUNTRY IS RESPECTED AGAIN. 

809
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:44,308
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE IT. 

810
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:45,576
BUT AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN. 

811
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:47,312
IT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE AND A 

812
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,981
BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE AIR. 

813
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,483
YOU TAKE A LOOK AROUND. 

814
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,320
THERE'S A BIG, BEAUTIFUL 

815
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,620
DIFFERENCE. 

816
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,023
WE ARE ADVANCING FORWARD WITH 

817
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:06,464
OUR CONFIDENCE RENEWED, OUR 

818
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,032
MIGHT RESTORED, AND THE 

819
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,400
UNWAVERING CONVICTION THAT OUR 

820
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,933
DESTINY IS CERTAIN. 

821
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:12,770
EACH OF YOU IS MOUNTAIN TOUGH, 

822
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,939
MOUNTAIN PROUD AND MOUNTAIN 

823
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,575
STRONG AND ALWAYS WILL BE 

824
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,008
CLIMBING TO GLORY. 

825
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:20,911
YOU WILL BE CLIMBING TO GLORY. 

826
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:24,015
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE 

827
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,585
INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN OF 

828
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,520
FORT DRUM. 

829
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,421
SPECIAL, SPECIAL, GREAT PEOPLE. 

830
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,957
GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS, AND GOD 

831
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,959
BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF 

832
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:35,893
AMERICA. 

833
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:41,366
I'D NOW LIKE TO INVITE A FEW OF 

834
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,334
OUR FANTASTIC SOLDIERS FROM THE 

835
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:43,968
TENTH MOUNTAIN DIVISION, SECOND 

836
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:47,805
BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM TO JOIN ME 

837
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,308
ON STAGE TO SIGN THE NATIONAL 

838
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,108
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT. 

839
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:52,343
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO BE WITH 

840
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:52,744
YOU TODAY. 

841
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,613
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 

842
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:55,813
THANK YOU. 

843
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,023
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? 

844
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,977
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 

845
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:03,814
GREAT HONOR. 

846
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:16,527
THANK YOU. 

847
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:25,370
[ MUSIC ] 

848
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,939
>>> AND WE WERE JUST LISTENING 

849
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,674
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING HIS 

850
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,075
FIRST VISIT TO UPSTATE NEW YORK 

851
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:31,542
SINCE TAKING OFFICE. 

852
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,812
HE IS THERE AT FORT DRUM. 

853
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,114
HE ANNOUNCED THE NATIONAL 

854
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:36,748
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT. 

855
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,550
WE JUST SAW HIM SIGNING IT 

856
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,618
THERE A MOMENT AGO. 

857
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,788
IT IS OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS THE 

858
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,123
JOHN S. McCAIN NATIONAL DEFENSE 

859
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,858
AUTHORIZATION ACT BUT THE 

860
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,660
PRESIDENT NEVER ONCE MENTIONED 

861
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,696
SENATOR McCAIN'S NAME AND HIS 

862
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:51,963
REMARKS. 

863
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,998
NOW, THIS NATIONAL DEFENSE 

864
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,501
MEASURE WILL PROVIDE MORE THAN 

865
00:33:56,501 --> 00:34:00,371
$700 BILLION IN FUNDING FOR THE 

866
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:00,638
MILITARY. 

867
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,272
IT WILL INCREASE SERVICE 

868
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,408
MEMBERS' SALARIES BY NEARLY 3% 

869
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:05,943
PERCENT, WHICH IS THE LARGEST 

870
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:09,013
PAY HIKE IN NINE YEARS. 

871
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,313
THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES A 

872
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,350
MILITARY PARADE THAT MR. TRUMP 

873
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,818
WANTS TO HOLD IN WASHINGTON 

874
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,185
THIS NOVEMBER. 

875
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,786
IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT OF 

876
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:18,656
COURSE THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO IN 

877
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,058
UPSTATE NEW YORK FOR A 

878
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,592
FUNDRAISER FOR GOP 

879
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,393
REPRESENTATIVE CLAUDIA TENNY, 

880
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:27,465
WHO IS FACING A VERY TOUGH RACE 

881
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:27,864
IN HER DISTRICT. 

882
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,735
FORT DRUM ITSELF, HOWEVER, IS 

883
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,905
IN THE DISTRICT OF YET ANOTHER 

884
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,772
REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE ELISE 

885
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,141
WHO DID SPEAK FOR A FEW MOMENTS 

886
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,509
TODAY BEFORE THE PRESIDENT GAVE 

887
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,578
HIS ADDRESS, AND SHE IS 

888
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,411
REPORTEDLY THE PERSON WHO 

889
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:42,746
INVITED THE PRESIDENT TO FORT 

890
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,782
DRUM, AND YOU CAN SEE THERE IS 

891
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,016
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. 

892
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:48,652
HE WAS ALSO IN ATTENDANCE AND 

893
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:49,820
SPOKE BEFORE THE PRESIDENT. 

894
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,989
IT IS, AGAIN, INTERESTING THAT 

895
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,858
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT MENTION 

896
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,893
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN ONCE. 

897
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,062
IT IS OBVIOUSLY WIDELY KNOWN 

898
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,432
THAT THE TWO HAVE FEUDED IN THE 

899
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,800
PAST. 

900
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,769
HOWEVER, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 

901
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,070
WASHINGTON OBSERVERS WILL NOTE. 

902
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,940
ONCE AGAIN , THIS NATIONAL 

903
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,707
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WILL 

904
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:13,177
PROVIDE MORE THAN $700 BILLION 

905
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,613
IN FUNDING FOR THE MILITARY AND 

906
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,582
GIVE SERVICE MEMBERS A SALARY 

907
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,217
BUMP OF ALMOST 3%, SOMETHING 

908
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,385
I'M SURE THEY ARE ALL VERY 

909
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:21,718
HAPPY ABOUT. 

910
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:22,019
ALL RIGHT. 

911
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,554
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

912
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:23,787
BREAK. 

913
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:25,289
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE 

914
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,457
CBSN. 

915
00:35:26,457 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T GO AWAY.
