00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,310
troubling<font color="#E5E5E5"> followers of mainstream news</font>

is are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russians good or bad if</font>

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,689
they're good why don't they speak

English like<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal people the history</font>

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia as told by the mainstream</font>

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">media is very complex in the old days</font>

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,780
Russia was good because they helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,120
defeat the Nazis who were bad which was

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,370
good but then bad because then the

20
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,020
Russians murdered millions of people and

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,920
enslaved everybody which can't be good

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,210
during the sixties the Russians were

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,920
good because<font color="#E5E5E5"> America was bad because</font>

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,989
America was fighting communism which was

25
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,600
good which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad the fighting I mean</font>

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,160
was bad because when America was

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,140
fighting communism you could get sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,449
war and killed and that was bad because

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,479
you were good then ronald reagan was

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,520
elected and he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very bad because he</font>

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">was republican so when he said the</font>

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,090
Russians were bad they must have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">good Reagan said the Russians were so</font>

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,439
bad that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their country would collapse</font>

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,390
and all the smart people in the

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,479
mainstream media said hahaha you stupid

37
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,490
Reagan because they were good and he was

38
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,259
bad and then the Russians country

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,119
collapsed but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of Reagan</font>

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,240
because he was bad now all the people

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,130
who had said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia was good became</font>

42
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,990
college professors so they could teach

43
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,670
young people that they were good and

44
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,040
America was bad then the young people

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,020
grew up and got jobs as journalists

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,409
which was very bad George W<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush and</font>

47
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,790
Mitt Romney said the Russians were bad

48
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,829
but they were Republicans so they were

49
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,720
bad and the Russians were good then

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,490
America was good because we elected

51
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,409
Barack Obama who was good and he said

52
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,970
the Russians were good so the Russians

53
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,979
were good and we sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> him a great big</font>

54
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,740
red reset button which wasn't bad until

55
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,420
they pressed the button and Crimea

56
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,729
disappeared which probably wasn't so

57
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,880
good Barack Obama<font color="#CCCCCC"> who was good said we</font>

58
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,380
should do business with Russia because

59
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,538
they were good so Donald Trump's friends

60
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,160
did business with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them which was bad</font>

61
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,290
because Trump was bad when he said

62
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,160
Russia was good

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,050
she was bad but not like Reagan said it

64
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,820
was bad because reagan was bad so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

65
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,380
couldn't be good but<font color="#E5E5E5"> russia was bad</font>

66
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,820
because Trump said it was good and he

67
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,670
was that the important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember</font>

68
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,460
is Republicans are bad so if they say

69
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Russia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is good it's bad and Democrats</font>

70
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,900
are good so they if they say Russia is

71
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,840
bad it's bad that's how the mainstream

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,719
word it doesn't mean Andrew it means

158
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,789
these sites that became one of the big

159
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:59,239
under steve bannon's you know heading<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

160
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,969
became one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pro Trump sites</font>

161
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,709
and probably helped him get elected I

162
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,949
would have to say when<font color="#E5E5E5"> chomp got up and</font>

163
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:08,360
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> that speech yesterday and the</font>

164
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,049
Democrats ran for the doors and they

165
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,909
didn't applaud for American jobs and

166
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:16,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">they some of them didn't applaud for the</font>

167
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,709
widow of a fallen Navy Seal and they

168
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,659
didn't applaud for all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things the</font>

169
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:22,039
Trump was talking he was kind of talking

170
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,989
about you know making compromises and

171
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:27,079
working with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just thought wow wow</font>

172
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,239
this is a disaster for the Democrat

173
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,379
Party I don't want to over blow it

174
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,939
because you know Trump can sometimes

175
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:33,439
step on his own feet he can blow himself

176
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,259
up but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was here's dan henig her in</font>

177
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,569
the Wall Street Journal talking about

178
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,779
the state of the Democrats that scene

179
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,819
you saw at the moment president Trump

180
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,559
ended his speech to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a joint session of</font>

181
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:48,169
Congress was the Democrats abandoning

182
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,419
the ship of state like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the progressive</font>

183
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,039
street demonstrations endured by the

184
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,929
country the past four weeks we may

185
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,059
assume Congress's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Democratic delegation</font>

186
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">organized their post speech bolt to the</font>

187
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,999
exits by the famous social media hashtag

188
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,879
hashtag the resistance you'd have

189
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,709
thought that a two-thirds at the

190
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-thirds point when mr. Trump had him</font>

191
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:11,419
self destructed as expected when instead

192
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,309
he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking less like Alec Baldwin</font>

193
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,829
and more like<font color="#E5E5E5"> president Trump the Chuck</font>

194
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Schumer might have pulled out his</font>

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,209
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea not this crew on</font>

197
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">mosque they went over the side just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

198
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,289
they refused to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attend hearings for</font>

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,400
cabinet nah<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

200
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,250
and voted as a block against virtually

201
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,760
all of them so they blew it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we</font>

202
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,960
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yesterday they didn't</font>

203
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,549
see this coming it was like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

204
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,990
was like a freight train ran him right

205
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,179
over as they SAT there in their old you

206
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we're the resistance who was a</font>

207
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,440
Roseanne Barr tweeted the other day did

208
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,080
you see this she tweeted Trump is the

209
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,640
resistance and I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

210
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,160
exactly right so in the aftermath the

211
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,110
press is scrambling how can we get back

212
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> narrative this is the presses</font>

213
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,800
problem since it began in Charlie Sykes

214
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,970
who I think was speaking for all

215
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,010
journalists left-wing commentator on

216
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,860
MSNBC listen to him describe the speech

217
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">his hopes for the future the Trump will</font>

218
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,270
now self-destruct and what he feels is

219
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,950
happening to the press I mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

220
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,420
good speech it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help him</font>

221
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,830
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a bump agree assured</font>

222
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,209
jittery Republicans there were some

223
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,040
genuine grace notes let's give it a

224
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,080
minute I mean how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times that we had</font>

225
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,430
this discussion is he going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

226
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,350
pivot is he going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a turn and I</font>

227
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're upper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> class those pieces is</font>

228
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,830
very important because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what vo the point</font>

229
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,170
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually changed</font>

230
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,230
there is no policy he is the same Donald

231
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,110
Trump as he was 24 hours Phoebe and he

232
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,420
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this ability to change his</font>

233
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,680
tune when he needs to be in a different

234
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,900
audience or needs to give a different a

235
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,270
style of speech we have seen that<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

236
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,100
time to time in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the campaign trail but</font>

237
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,560
this certainly was quite difficult word

238
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,660
used to with Donald was it was a solid

239
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,279
speech all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I do think with the</font>

240
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,900
exception of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Robert casa there's almost</font>

241
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,150
a a battered pundit syndrome going on

242
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,070
out there where you know it he comes

243
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,529
home<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's not abusive but he's not</font>

244
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,029
drunk and so we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so incredibly</font>

245
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:01,970
grateful<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so incredibly good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing</font>

246
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,070
the breast to a battered wife you know

247
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,050
the only difference you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just is</font>

248
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,089
that of course wives<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't deserve to be</font>

249
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,300
battered we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the crap out</font>

252
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,350
dishonest and they immediately by the

253
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,760
way talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about who's getting battered</font>

few days in his first month in office

259

to this stupid Russian story which I

277
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,610
believe is a complete nothing burger I

278

279
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,250
remember just remember that until Crimea

280
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,670
was annexed Barack Obama was urging

281
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,279
businessmen to do business with the

282
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,779
Soviet Union<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ad with the Soviet with</font>

the Russians he was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to Russia</font>

284
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,050
Obama was accompanied by businessmen and

285
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,540
by you know CEOs and saying we need to

286
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,339
invest in Russia this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to press</font>

the reset button bada bada ba and all

288

that money was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> establish and</font>

289
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,660
strengthen the regime<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Vladimir Putin</font>

290
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,870
I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what Obama did until they</font>

291
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,310
annex with Crimea and he started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

Russians of all those businessmen very

294
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,420
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few of them had anything to do with</font>

Donald Trump Donald Trump took very very

296
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,470
little business with the Russians less

297
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,149
than a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people who were following</font>

298
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,189
obama's leads when they say Oh Paul

299

Manafort he was over there representing
