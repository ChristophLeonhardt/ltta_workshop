ABOUT --
>> Bill: HANG ON ONE SECOND.
>> President Trump: IRAN HAS
ACTED VERY BADLY.
WE ARE DOING MANY THINGS RIGHT
NOW, INCLUDING SANCTIONS, THAT
ARE VERY MASSIVE.
ONE OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS WE
HAVE EVER DONE.
IRAN HAS TO CHANGE ITS TUNE
BEFORE I MEET WITH THEM.
THEY WANTED ME.
I'M NOT MEETING WITH THEM UNTIL
THEY CHANGE THEIR TUNE.
IT WILL HAPPEN.
I BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A
GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN.
BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN NOW.
>> President Trump: IT IS A
PROCESS OF SETTING UP A MEETING
WITH NORTH KOREA.
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEEN DEALING
WITH US, HE HAS MADE DRAMATIC
PROGRESS.
FAR GREATER THAN PEOPLE WOULD
UNDERSTAND OR KNOW.
IT HAS BEEN REALLY A VERY GOOD
RELATIONSHIP.
AS YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO
TESTS.
NO NUCLEAR TESTS, NO ROCKETS, NO
MISSILE LAUNCHES, AND WE GOT OUR
HOSTAGES BACK.
WE ARE GETTING THE REMAINS OF
OUR GREAT HEROES BACK.
THAT HAS ALREADY STARTED THAT
PROCESS.
MANY MORE ARE COMING IN AT THE
VERY SHORT FUTURE.
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL WITH
NORTH KOREA.
AGAIN, FAR GREATER THAN ANYBODY
WOULD KNOW.
I HAVE MUCH PERSONAL
CORRESPONDENCE WITH CHAIRMAN KI
KIM, AND WE WILL -- I THINK WE
WILL DO SOMETHING THAT WILL
WORK.
THAT IT'S GOOD FOR NORTH KOREA,
GOOD FOR CHAIRMAN KIM, AND ALSO
