1
00:00:01,236 --> 00:00:03,471
SOME OF FORD'S ALLIES, POSSIBLY

2
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:03,938
DEMOCRATS.

3
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:05,973
JOINING US IS HARVARD LAW

4
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:08,209
PROFESSOR EMERITUS, AUTHOR OF

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,177
THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING

6
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:11,178
TRUMP, ALAN DERSHOWITZ.

7
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:14,181
>> THE PHONIEST ARGUMENT THEY

8
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,384
DIDN'T INTERVIEW HER.

9
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:18,019
SHE UNDER OATH TESTIFIED.

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,187
FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS DON'T

11
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,189
REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY.

12
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,091
THE TWO PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T

13
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:25,293
INTERVIEW THE PEOPLE WHO

14
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:25,693
TESTIFIED.

15
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:26,827
THEIR JOB WAS TO FIND

16
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,129
CORROBORATION OR LACK OF

17
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,563
CORROBORATION.

18
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:30,131
IF SHE HAS ADDITIONAL WITNESSES

19
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:31,832
SHE SHOULD HAVE THEM PUTTING OUT

20
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,200
STATEMENTS, SWORN STATEMENTS

21
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:33,901
UNDER OATH.

22
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:35,803
THEN WE CAN EVALUATE THOSE.

23
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,838
BUT, RIGHT NOW, I THINK THE

24
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,073
ARGUMENT THAT SHE WASN'T

25
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:40,608
INTERVIEWED IS ABSURD ONE.

26
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,844
WHAT WOULD SHE DO, CHANGE HER

27
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:44,211
TESTIMONY?

28
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,746
SHE CANNOT HELP HERSELF.

29
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:50,785
SHE CAN ONLY HURT HERSELF TO BY

30
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:51,319
CHANGING TESTIMONY.

31
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,287
BRIAN: ERNEST ATTEMPT TO DELAY.

32
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:54,822
>> ERNEST ATTEMPT TO DELAY.

33
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:57,525
BRIAN: TWO SCENARIOS, ONE HE

34
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:58,626
PASSES, WHAT HAPPENS, AND ONE HE

35
00:00:58,627 --> 00:00:59,427
DOESN'T, WHAT HAPPENS?

36
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:01,963
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IMPACT IT

37
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:04,165
WILL HAVE ON THE ELECTION.

38
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:04,799
BRIAN: CHANGES THE COURT.

39
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,334
>> IT CHANGES THE COURT, BUT

40
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:07,735
CHANGES THE COURT LESS THAN IF

41
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:09,937
HE DOESN'T GET CONFIRMED AND

42
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:11,872
PRESIDENT TRUMP APPOINTS

43
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:12,773
SOMEBODY EVEN FURTHER TO THE

44
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:13,074
RIGHT.

45
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,308
THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

46
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:16,277
THE COURT WILL BE CHANGED.

47
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:17,878
THAT'S THE REALITY OF A

48
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,647
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

49
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:22,350
THE QUESTION IS NOW, ALL ABOUT,

50
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:26,821
WHETHER WE ALLOW A NOMINEE TO BE

51
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:28,422
DISCREDITED WITHOUT HARD PROOF,

52
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:30,958
HARD EVIDENCE, AND WHETHER OR

53
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,760
NOT THIS ESTABLISHES AS

54
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,095
PRECEDENT TO THE FUTURE WHERE

55
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:35,563
NOBODY IS GOING TO WANT TO SERVE

56
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:36,764
ON THE BENCH.

57
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,466
THE IDEA THAT HE CAN'T TEACH AT

58
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:41,636
HARVARD NOW BECAUSE HE WAS

59
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:42,069
SUSPECTED?

60
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,305
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN

61
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,740
BROOKLYN COLLEGE AT STUDENT,

62
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:46,907
THEY FIRED PROFESSORS BECAUSE

63
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,743
THEY WERE SUSPECTED MAYBE BEING

64
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:49,977
COMMUNISTS WHEN THEY WERE IN

65
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:51,045
THEIR 20s.

66
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:52,313
SUSPICION WAS ENOUGH.

67
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,181
THIS KIND OF SEXUAL McCARTHY

68
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:55,883
SYSTEM A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE

69
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:56,417
PRECEDENT.

70
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:58,152
LOOK, WOMEN BEING ASSAULTED A

71
00:01:58,153 --> 00:01:59,053
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING BUT

72
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:01,889
WOMEN MAKING UP STORIES OF THE

73
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,624
WAY AT LEAST ONE WITNESS MAY

74
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,993
WELL HAVE MADE UP A STORY OUT OF

75
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:07,094
WHOLE CLOTH, THAT IS A SERIOUS

76
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:07,495
MATTER TOO.

77
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:09,764
WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO ALL OF

78
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:10,196
THESE ISSUES.

79
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,099
THIS IS A TEACHING MOMENT AND I

80
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,200
HOPE WE LEARN THE RIGHT THING

81
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,503
FROM THIS TEACHING MOMENT.

82
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:17,905
LOOK I'M NOT ADVOCATE FOR THIS

83
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:18,305
NOMINATION.

84
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,907
I WOULD NOT HAVE NOMINATED

85
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:20,441
KAVANAUGH.

86
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:22,176
MY CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE BEEN

87
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,311
MERRICK GARLAND THIS IS FOR ME

88
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,713
NOT ABOUT WHETHER THE MY CHOICE

89
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,014
GETS ON THE SUPREME COURT.

90
00:02:27,015 --> 00:02:29,150
IT IS ABOUT WHETHER THE PROCESS

91
00:02:29,151 --> 00:00:00,000
OF CONFIRMATION IS FOREVER
