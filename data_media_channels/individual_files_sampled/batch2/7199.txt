a woman who was the target of a local sheriff in Texas over her use of a bumper sticker that she did not like has now been arrested this is an update to a story that we did earlier and it's regarding a woman who had a bumper sticker on her car that had a bunch of expletives directed toward people who voted for Trump now the sheriff who saw this bumper sticker or saw a picture of the truck with the bumper sticker had wanted to target her for prosecution and then he realized oh maybe there's some freedom of speech issues there and maybe I should take my post down well here's the update to the story Karen Fann Eska who is the woman with the truck and the bumper sticker was arrested Thursday afternoon for possession and use of a fake identification jail records show a spokeswoman for the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office told BuzzFeed news that it received a tip Wednesday that there was an outstanding felony warrant for the driver and so my guess is she probably became or her identity became public as a result of this big story that went viral and then maybe someone looked into her past her record I don't know but someone tipped the authorities off to her and for those of you who might not have seen the bumper sticker in question here's what I was talking about it said f Trump and F you for voting for him and then the sheriff Troy Nell's from Texas said I've received numerous calls regarding the offensive display on this truck as it is often seen along FM 359 if you know who owns this truck or it is yours I would like to discuss it with you our prosecutor has informed us she would accept disorderly conduct charges regarding it now there have been a number of cases that were ruled by judges federal judges indicating that you can't go after people for things like this for a bumper sticker that might be deemed offensive so he later took down that post but she ended up getting arrested anyway for unrelated charges yeah I hope she can prove it I mean the fact is that you know they didn't make up the charge probably existed then they were thrilled to find it when they searched her because they for prosecution right there right let's dig up something let's find something and they found something I hope she wins everything I hope she wins everything I hope she wins harassment I hope she makes these guys pay and unfortunately the ACLU was as told her to get in touch yes because it's not I mean it's it's been very clear you you're allowed to use four-letter words though that's as protected speech you can use it on a bumper sticker you can use it to fly a flag from your house I would have gone a different route with my Trump protest just because you know again I do think yeah you're on the street kids and they're gonna be like hey what's that I wouldn't have gone with that I would have objected on those grounds a little bit to somebody who had an F Obama and after you for vote in forum which I'm sure probably existed in Texas but they're not the same there are reasons to hate Trump in their work reasons to hate the other guy I have a shirt that says I got bourbon faced on shit Street that I bought in New Orleans and I bought it and I was like this is the most clever thing I've ever seen I need this now also I think I had been drinking so I bought it and I occasionally would put it on mm-hmm but I wouldn't go outside yeah I would go like oh god this is not this is gonna work go back inside go back inside and I like or if if I like forget that I have it on because I sleep in it and I walk down the street and I realize I'm wearing it I would do I don't like a cross like I'm like walking down the street like this because this is where the like it says Canal Street this is Canal Street yeah but I I wouldn't I would hope I wouldn't be arrested but whatever it's beyond that doesn't matter whatever she's allowed to do it and it's fine yes yeah so she's protected by for the bumper sticker the other charges I don't know anything about that so the in Bowers versus Hardwick the cop in Georgia goes into the apartment right didn't have to you could have rejected the call a lot of steps along the way or if he thought compelled to because the person who could knock you go hey you got a neighbor who complains so I don't know maybe keep it down so they don't complain but I didn't sign up to be a police officer to come in here and arrest I'm making the ages up and arrest a 34 year old man for having consensual sex with the 31 man that's not why I got into this business and Troy Nell's you got into this business because somebody saw this truck and because you like Trump or you were offended by people who find this incredibly offensive person offensive that you decide that you're gonna take time off the public dollar that you're getting paid for to protect us and keep bad guys off the street that you think I'm gonna spend my time doing this here's what you say to the person who calls hey man it's America hang up the phone yeah be rude like so often you probably are and hang up and go to your job do your job this is not your job just thank you for your concern thank you for helping sigh I understand that this could be unnerving to you sure it's the expletive use steer it away from the name but it has been upheld in the corner nothing we can do it something great about this story is it gave me a chance to go look up other anti-trump I went on yes there's an it's just amazing stuff like there's a red bubble t-shirt situation you can get into my favorite is it looks like it says it's Miller time but it says it's Muller time I've seen that one I've seen that there's one that says it's written down in a very like disney style t-shirt designed it's a super calloused fragile racist sexist nazi sexist nazi POTUS so good it doesn't take up as much time there's a pin you can get that's an oompa loompa uh-huh of the president it's just him his face on it Ubbe lupa and then there's like this whole toilet sub-genre of things you can buy the toilet subgenre i have the toilet paper which my mother-in-law gave me as a gift but there's also like the poo emoji sticker you can put on your it's Trump's face and the poo emoji and then also like a decal you can put guys urinals have like sometimes like a little bee that you pee on just so it doesn't that's like you know it's plastic you can put a whole trunk decal inside your toilet and pee on it every time if you want to express yourself I'm good at what I don't know I may take a controversial stand here I reject all of those I really skin crawl and I hate okay I get it you can sell them but don't do it don't do it don't buy any of that stuff don't support that yeah I think for me the big thing is I gotta buy it or not do you boo like I don't care right um but I just don't like owning or displaying anything like that because I just don't want people to talk to me you know what I'm saying like you're inviting people to talk to you or interact with you and look for the vast majority of people are fine I still don't want to talk to you like I don't sounds like a non political statement it's actually strictly political because if someone approaches me and wants to talk about something else then I'm all for it like I'm not gonna shut down immediately if you want to come up to me and talk to me about Trump and politics I don't want I don't want to talk to you at all I don't want to talk to strangers about and I don't want to invite it you know what I'm saying because people are insane right now yeah and people are unhinged and like mentally unstable and do all sorts of crazy things you see all sorts of crazy videos out there people confronting each other violently I'm not inviting that and I think look I support this woman I support anyone who wants to display any type of political speech that is your right but it is risky to so there's like a little element of courageousness in what she's doing because she's in freakin Texas where you know the majority of people in her district voted for Trump and so she's like I don't care I'm gonna have this I'm gonna you know display it loud and
