HEATHER: REFUSING TO BACK DOWN
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THAT HE
BELIEVES THAT KIM JONG UN WILL
HONOR DENUCLEARIZATION AGREEMENT
BUT SUGGESTED THAT CHINA COULD
BE OBSTRUCTING THE GOAL AMID
TRADE TENSIONS, SO THE PRESIDENT
TRUMP FIGHTING THIS BATTLE ON
TWO FRONTS?
JOINING ME NOW MILITARY EXPERT
LIEUTENANT COLONEL DANIEL DAVIS,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US
THIS MORNING.
APPRECIATE IT.
>> YOU BET, MY PLEASURE TO BE
HERE, THANKS.
HEATHER: DO YOU BELIEVE CHINA IS
MED UNTIL THIS DENUCLEARIZATION
PROCESS WITH NORTH KOREA, DO YOU
BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT
TWEETED OUT?
>> THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS WE
HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION
TO UNDERSTAND WITH CHINA, THAT
ANYTHING.
AND THE SECOND THING IS THAT
THEY THINK IN TERMS OF REGIONAL
STRATEGIC VIEW, THEY VIEW MANY
THINGS ALTOGETHER AND THAT
INCLUDES THE TRADE WAR RIGHT OFF
THE TOP BUT ALSO THE
DENUCLEARIZATION ISSUE WITH
NORTH KOREA, THE SOUTH CHINA SEA
WITH ALL OF THE ISLANDS THAT
THEY ARE BUILDING OUT THERE AND
ALSO THE TAIWAN ISSUE, THEY
THINK OF ALL THOSE THINGS
TOGETHER AND WE DON'T HAVE TO
WONDER THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE
DOING.
CHINA-STATE MEDIA THAT THOSE ARE
CONNECTED, THEY WILL USE
WHATEVER LEVERAGE THEY CAN IN
COMBINATION WITH ALL OF THAT TO
GET WHAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST
INTEREST OF CHINESE ECONOMIC
ON THE DENUCLEARIZATION ISSUE,
THEY MAY BE WILLING TO DO THAT
AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO THINK IN
THOSE SAME TERMS OF HAVING ALL
THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND IT'S
NOT INDIVIDUAL LIKE STOVE-POT
KIND OF OPTIONS.
HEATHER: SO WHAT SHOULD THE
TERMS BE BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES
TO TARIFFS, WE KNOW THE U.S. AND
CHINA THEY ARE PLACING 25%
TARIFFS ON $34 BILLION OF EACH
INCREASED TO 32.2 BILLION, WHAT
TYPE OF LEVERAGE DO WE HAVE,
WHAT TYPE OF LEVERAGE DO THEY
HAVE?
>> RIGHT, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT
-- PLUS, CHINA HAS BEEN CHEATING
ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
FOR A LONG TIME AND PRESIDENT
BRING IT BACK INTO BANS BUT THE
WANT TO PREZ TOO HARD IN
ECONOMIC REALM WITH THE TRADE
WAR THAT COMPLICATES OUR
COOPERATIVE OR THEY CAN BE MORE
COMBATIVE DEPENDING ON HOW
THINGS GO IN THAT DIRECTION.
I THINK MAYBE THERE ARE BETTER
WAYS, CERTAINLY OTHER WAYS TO
HANDLE THE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS
THROUGH THE WTO AND OTHER
THINGS.
WE HAVE GOOD TRACK RECORD WITH
ALL OF THAT BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO
GOING TO BE WITH NORTH KOREA.
HEATHER: CAN I ASK YOU WHAT DID
YOU TAKE THIS MEANS TO MEAN WHEN
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO
CAME OUT OF MEETINGS WITH NORTH
GANGSTER-LIKE, THE DEMANDS --
OUR DEMANDS ARE GANGSTER-LIKE
GANGSTER-LIKE THEN THE WORLD IS
GANGSTER-LIKE BECAUSE IF YOU ARE
TALK ABOUT SANCTIONS IT WAS A
UNANIMOUS DECISION TO KEEP
SANCTIONS UNTIL DENUCLEARIZATION
IS COMPLETE.
>> HOW THE TWO SIDES VIEW THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.
IN THE NORTH KOREA SIDE, I WILL
POINT OUT THAT ON THE CHINESE
SIDE, UNITED STATES, SOUTH
KOREA, EVERYONE SAYS THAT
DENUCLEARIZATION IS THE ULTIMATE
GOAL AND THEY ALL BELIEVE THAT.
THE PATH TO GET THAT, THOUGH,
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
NORTH KOREA WHEN THEY SAID GANG
STF LIKE WHAT THEY VIEW IN
CONTEXT, HEY, YOU'RE COMING AND
AND YOU'RE GOING ROB US BY
ASKING US TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING
AND THEN AT THE END THEN WE HAVE
THE THINGS.
IF WE GO IN THE SITUATION WHERE
WE HAVE TO HAVE 100% BEFORE WE
GIVE ANYTHING, IT WOULD BE HARD
TO COME TO ANY KIND OF
CONCLUSION, WE HAVE TO MAYBE
HEATHER: KIM JONG UN HAS TO
APPEAR TO BE FIGHTING BACK, WE
