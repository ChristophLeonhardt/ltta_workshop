00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,700
A few weeks ago, I interviewed one of my favorite
rappers, Open Mike Eagle. And immediately

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,660
we started geeking out over the masked emcee,
MF Doom.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,490
His flow I have to be careful with his flow
because his flow lives in my mind and in my

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,460
heart. I can almost get into his mind on how
he writes. You know?

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,400
This is what MF Doom sounds like. Just listen.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,390
He’ll have entire bars that rhyme. Like
the entire set up bar rhymes with every syllable

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,890
in the punchline bar. It’s incredible.

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,570
It made me wonder:

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,200
What can I learn from rappers simply by looking
at how they rhyme with the beat?

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,089
I try to start off with 16 dots on the paper.

11
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:03,749
That’s Rakim. He’s widely regarded as
one of the most influential MCs of all time.

12
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:10,290
If 4 bars was this long. I see like a graph
between them four bars. I could place so many

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,390
words and so many syllables. I could take
it to the point where there were no other

14
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,960
words you could put in those 4 bars.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,710
So, before we get into rhymes we need to know
what beats and bars are.

16
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,130
Martin: I always try to find the beat of the
music first.

17
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,110
That’s Martin Connor. He’s analyzed the
most rhythmically dense rap songs down to

18
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,439
the last syllable. And he writes about it.

19
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,930
Martin: A bar is a grouping together of 4
beats.

20
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,049
Before guys like Rakim came along, rhymes
in rap songs were pretty basic.

21
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,500
Take one of the first commercially successful
rap songs from 1980, “The Breaks” by Kurtis Blow

22
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,359
This simple AA BB rhyming pattern with no
word play or puns is pretty predictable, lyrically and musically

23
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,930
But, fast forward to 1986 and you’ve got
songs like “Eric B. Is President” from

24
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,100
Eric B. & Rakim.

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,000
Compare this to “The Breaks” and it’s
clear the frequency of rhymes is greater.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,420
But not only are you seeing more rhymes you’re
also starting to see different kinds of rhymes.

27
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,080
“Indeed” and “Proceed” are internal
rhymes because they happen inside the sentence.

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,610
“Man made a mix” and “band-aid to fix”
are multisyllable rhymes

29
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,239
The other thing Rakim does later in the verse
is cross the bar line and he does it in a

30
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,900
tremendously clever way.

31
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,680
Crossing the bar line happens when a sentence
like “The rhyme can’t be kept inside”

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,989
doesn’t end when the bar ends.

33
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:12,510
If you listen closely you’ll hear that the
second syllable of inSIDE

34
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,400
Lands on the first beat of the next bar.

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,879
Rakim even references this in the lyric. And
it’s pretty clever.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,310
Now, fast forward 11 years and Notorious B.I.G's
“Hypnotize" cleverly used Rakim’s techniques

37
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,890
to make one of the smoothest rap songs ever.

38
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,079
Martin: What I like most about this is that
it’s not predictable and it’s always changing.

39
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,879
So sometimes Notorious B.I.G.s sentences are
long. Sometimes they’re short.

40
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,700
Like the moment in this verse here:

41
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,280
He’s also completely comfortable delivering
a sentence across the barline.

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,129
But, what makes this song stand out the most to me
is that before one rhyme scheme ends, another

43
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,650
one begins.

44
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,800
Like this moment in verse 2.

45
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,050
The first group of rhymes is the “oo”
rhymes and it links the first and second sentence

46
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,400
which then begins the “ih” and so on.

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,960
It’s a huge reason Biggie sounds so smooth
here.

48
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,800
Now, as much as Biggie daisy chained an entire
song together with rhymes, he was, for the

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,210
most part using single syllable and single
word rhymes.

50
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,800
And this is where artists like Mos Def push
things even further.

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,750
His verse on “Re:Definition” from 2002
hits nearly every note within the bar with

52
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,560
4 syllable rhymes.

53
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,100
And he does it across a whopping 14 bars.

54
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,600
In Re:Definition, Mos Def is very clearly
rhyming each word with the beat.

55
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:18,100
This is where Andre 3000 shakes things up
with his verse in Aquemini. Focus on the beat first.

56
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,500
Now listen to each syllable, with the beat in mind.

57
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:57,069
Most rappers would have dollars, parlors,
and bottles all rhyme similarly on the beat.

58
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:02,100
But Andre is accenting each rhyme within different
places relative to the beat and bar.

59
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,250
People say that the word orange doesn't rhyme with anything. 
And that kinda pisses me off because I can

60
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,639
think of a lot of things that rhyme with orange...

61
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,100
In fact, Eminem, does this exact thing on
his 2002 song “Business”

62
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,400
Eminem doesn’t just pack in tremendously
dense multi syllable rhymes, he also tells

63
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,729
incredibly vivid stories.

64
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,789
And for a lot of people that wins in a battle.

65
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,630
This is where “Lose Yourself” comes in.
It was the first rap song to win an Academy

66
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,460
Award.

67
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:52,500
Whew the Oscar goes to Eminem, for Lose Yourself
from 8 Mile.

68
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,220
Martin: I’ll see the line and I’ll separate it all into not just words or sentences,

69
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,680
but into their syllables.

70
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,000
When you group all of these rhymes together,
this incredibly complex rhyme scheme emerges.

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,310
It’s unpredictable, it’s complex rhythmically
and lyrically but -

72
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,900
It’s not just that you’re rhyming, 
It’s that while you’re rhyming you’re

73
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,900
still telling a good story. And "Lose Yourself" is like that.

74
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:37,819
Today, rappers like Kendrick Lamar are carrying on the tradition of artists 
that are able to use the musicality of rhymes

75
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:40,190
to create really memorable songs.

76
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,400
Let’s look at Kendrick Lamar’s “Rigamortus”

77
00:07:54,569 --> 00:08:00,590
The first thing you’ll notice is that Kendrick
has created a very clear motive with his rhymes.

78
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,319
What’s a motive? It’s a short musical
idea. A musical fragment or succession of

79
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,680
notes that has some special importance in
a composition.

80
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,600
Here’s probably the most recognizable motive
in the history of music.

81
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,470
That “du du du dummmmm” is carried out
through the entire piece. It’s 3 quick notes

82
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,310
followed by a long note.

83
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,129
The musical motive in “Rigamortus” is
two short notes followed by a long note,

84
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,500
stringing the entire
song together.

85
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,900
When Kendrick goes into 4th gear he
keeps the motive going. And the motive keeps him in check.

86
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,510
As much as Biggie’s “Hypnotize” sounds
completely different from “Rigamortus”

87
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,340
there are a lot of musical similarities.

88
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,170
Remember how Biggie daisy chained rhymes?
Kendrick does that too here. In “Hypnotize”

89
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,130
Biggie also creates a motive with the sequence
of rhymes here:

90
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:39,080
Now, let’s get back to MF Doom. Two years
after “Lose Yourself” won an Academy Award,

91
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,670
MF Doom released 3 full albums including

92
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,270
Madvillainy - which is widely considered one
of the best underground hip hop records period.

93
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,400
Mos Def can’t even contain his excitement
talking about Doom.

94
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,330
For the most part, MF Doom rhymes on the beat
but he uses multi syllable rhyming phrases

95
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,200
up with wazoo often rhyming entire lines together.

96
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
This is called a holorime.

97
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:32,170
Mike: He’ll do setup punchline. Like his
following bar will be referencing the punchline

98
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,360
but not in a way that he’ll be setting up
a another one, he just starts to go in another

99
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,130
direction, but just acknowledges where the last bar was.

100
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,900
This is what Mike is talking about.

101
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,060
MF Doom understands the power of rhyme and
the beat and completely manipulates it in

102
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,800
a humorous way.

103
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,990
As Pitchfork points out “the rhyme's pattern
and rap's topical stereotype demands the word

104
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:12,060
"bitches," yet Doom hilariously says "booze"
and uses that rhyme to connect the next sentence.

105
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,740
Where artists like Kendrick Lamar, Eminem,
and Andre 3000 are telling very vivid stories

106
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,830
with their rhymes, MF Doom is using his dense
rhymes like a villain would use his superpower.

107
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,500
Before you know it you’re being hit with
a killer punchline, double entendres, and clever wordplay.

108
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Martin: I love rappers with that  syncopated uneven phrasing where the sentences don't line up with the bars

109
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
because, like you said, you can't predict what's going to happen.

110
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,900
The point of appreciating it is to see what the very most clever human beings are capable of doing

111
00:11:43,980 --> 00:00:00,000
that you didn't think possible.
