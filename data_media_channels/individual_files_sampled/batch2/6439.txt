a TSA agent in Orlando Florida got caught stealing money from a traveler's luggage now this all started when kathleen duddleson was pulled aside for a random pat-down and as she was being patted down her bag was going through the conveyor belt and alexander che johnson was going through it now as he was going through it she noticed that there was something kind of shady going on so as soon as she got her bag back she looked through it to see if the money that she placed in the bag was still there and sure enough it was gone now Shea Johnson had a bulge in his pocket and she just because he was happy to see she assumed that the money was stolen and she alerted the authorities immediately sure enough they looked at the surveillance camera and they found that he did in fact seal the money and so he is now facing charges for doing so and it sounds like this is an isolated incident right it's not that big of a deal except it's not so in 2012 the TSA agent at JFK International Airport was accused of stealing five thousand dollars for passengers jacket that same year another former TSA employee told the New York Daily News that stealing from passengers was quote very commonplace also since 2003 just under 400 TSA officers had been fired for stealing from passengers well by the way that's the ones that got caught yes okay let alone the ones most of them probably didn't get caught you know it's funny because every time they make me take out my money whether it's a wallet or just cash because if you're going through the big scanner they make you take out everything including the cash they insist on it Yeah right I'm like it's cash what I mean what's who cares right they and and they're like no no you gotta put it in the bin and I'm always like that always makes me a little nervous I'm always like watching it through the babe especially when you're going to Vegas in you have a little bit of cash on you on the way back it's not an issue at all membership helps fund the young turks you don't want great thing about that that means we're not accountable to anyone but you guys that's why we're strong together because we built this show around you come build it even bigger and better at TYT Network comm /join
