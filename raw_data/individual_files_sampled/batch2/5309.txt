on gun policy the focus is to literally give families and give local law enforcement additional tools if an individual is reported to be a potential danger to themselves or others allow due process that no one's rights are trampled but the ability to go to court obtain an order and then collect not only the firearms but any any weapons in the position we're going to take the firearms first and then go to court because that's another system because a lot of times by the time you go to court it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures I like taking the guns early like in this crazy man's case so you could do exactly what you're saying but take the guns first go through due process second Joe and Pat in your bill what are you doing about the 18 to 21 we didn't address that okay you can't buy one that you have to wait you 21 but you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18 I think it's something you have to think about so I just curious as to what you did in your bill we didn't address it as president look I think and why did you're afraid of the NRA right they do have great power I agree with it they have great power over you people they have less power over me I don't need I don't what do I need the house did pass a bill the bill dealing with fixing problems with our background check system we also combined with it a bill that advanced concealed carry reciprocity if you're gonna put concealed carry between states into this bill we're talking about a whole new ballgame and you know I'm with you but let it be a separate bill you'll never get this mess if you add concealed carry to this you'll never get it passed this is the number of incidents before and of the of incidents and of deaths this is when the ten year assault weapon van was in how incidents and deaths drop when it ended you see it's going on dianna boom go ahead and if you have also and I think you can into the bill we're determined to turn our grief into action I really believe that I think that the people at this table wanted I've been I see some folks that don't say nice things about me and that's okay because if you turn that into this energy I love you I don't care boy there's a lot to get through there Republican senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska released a statement following the president's comments about wanting to confiscate guns from certain people even if it violates due process rights senator sets wrote strong leaders don't automatically agree with the last thing that was said to them we have the Second Amendment and due process for a reason we're not ditching any constitutional protection simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn't like them Joe we're just sitting here with our mouths on the on the floor I mean that let's take the Ben Sasse notion there that is right the conspiracy that many men are a members and gun owners and I've long talked about the gun grab there it is as articulated by the President of the United States a Republican who's been backed by the NRA and and of course that'll never happen because as I've always said on the other side of the equation when people said I have a constitutional right to have an ar-15 no you don't you don't have that power under the Constitution Scalia didn't give it to you in Heller and mr. president you do not have that power to grab guns first and have due process later David French actually had it had a great proposal in the National Review that I think is going to actually become law but gene I let's let's explain a little bit to viewers that may not have followed this closely throughout the day yesterday because they're actually working yesterday was an extraordinary day in American culture we've seen these students protesting and then yesterday early in the morning Dick's Sporting Goods the largest sporting goods store said they're no longer selling assault-style weapons they're making if people be 21 before getting guns Walmart followed up that's a pretty big footprint who they stopped selling assault style weapons a few years ago after Newtown they also went up to 21 the FedEx really leaned forward yesterday and said hey wait a second ups also you know ships guns we we are giving the NRA the same deal that we give absolutely everybody else that ships with us in bulk no preferential treatment but and then Fred Smith and FedEx said but you will note we were the only people to come out and say our position is we believe assault weapons should be assault-style weapons should be banned they should be held kept to the military and delivered the sort of strong statement you just don't see corporations delivering but so somebody who knows Fred Smith said you know what he fought in the Battle of weigh in Vietnam and he fought in Vietnam for four years and he is told friends the gun that Cruz had going into that school was just like the guns that he fired in Vietnam for four years as a United States Marine and this is something and and forgive me for continuing but really quickly also what the president was saying what the president was saying a new poll came out in Florida with overwhelming support for background checks and a majority supporting assault style weapon bans and the same thing with every nationwide poll so the president looks really courageous there until you realize that when he supports Toomey's bill he's supporting what 90% of Americans support and even when he wanders into assault style vans he two out of three Americans support that position to the inner a and the Republicans including Steve Scalise who was a victim of gun of gun violence they are on I mean they are the 10% in a lot of these these issues yeah that's absolutely right you know one other thing happened yesterday that we barely noticed in in Georgia a teacher apparently fired a weapon in a classroom the school was put on lockdown fortunately nobody was injured the teacher barricaded himself inside the classroom but was talked out and and the students at that school then sort of joined the students from Parkland in in speaking out and saying we're not gonna be silenced and and talking about this idea of arming teachers as a way to end school violence look I think we're at it was an extraordinary day in the history of the country on on gun control I can't believe I'm gonna say this but I do think we are in a different place now I do that doesn't mean I think we're you know we're necessarily gonna sail right through to an assault weapons ban or anything like that I don't know it's if what will get done but in terms of the way it feels and the way people think of them and just public opinion and and increasingly I think the opinion of officials parkland was a warrant watershed and and and the the activism of those students there is making a difference in this debate that will reverberate I think for years to come and Jon Meacham again you look at the corporations these are corporations that obviously have to be very careful but you have Walmart what like largest retail store in America you have got Dick's Sporting Goods Sporting Goods the largest sporting goods store in America again even even though FedEx is continuing its discount to the membership of the NRA which again they do to everybody that melds and vote FedEx delivering a very strong statement saying we believe that assault-style weapons should only be in the hands of our military and then this meeting with the president this actually does I will say this actually does feel different can you can you can you compare this day and any other moment where where a social issue like this moves so quickly I know gay marriage moved over ten ten years but this appears to be accelerating much more quickly at the end of a yeah and like marriage equality at the end of a long and arduous process I thought about the the role the marketplace in in bringing about this kind of social change I was thinking about one of your hometowns through the years thinking about Atlanta which famously struggled to be the fate the city that was too busy to hate during Jim Crow and the civil rights movement wanted to there was a series of mayor's a series of town leaders who while not perfect very much wanted to have a major league baseball team have the NFL have Delta Airlines come down they wanted to be a genuine New South and they knew that if they could keep the emphasis on their better angels then they would have a better chance of prospering and Atlanta became Atlanta in part because of that attitude and so here you have a situation where a number of important corporations and commercial actors are saying if the government's not gonna act we'll do it it's like Lincoln and McClellan meets Dow Jones right we will take care we'll take these steps and I think that's I think to me it's a civil rights example where there were cities that decided we would rather prosper together and fight each other and stay in a backwater and there are a lot of cities in this country that made the latter choice and not the former and the people who made the idea that you know what the real important color here is green which was a famous saying in Atlanta that's what's happening now with guns I think so currently the parallel that I'm thinking about here with president Trump's meeting yesterday where he effectively laid out a case step by step for gun control measures to tighten gun laws is last month or it was January I guess where he had the the meeting about immigration reform and dreamers and he said we've got to have a pathway to citizenship again shocking Republicans and Democrats in the room dick Durbin said yes the president's on the right path President Trump gets back to his office and Stephen Miller and others say wait a minute mr. president that's actually now what we believe hey do you think we'll see that here on guns as well that's gonna be the big towel for the wait house was supposed to brief today at that after that time they went and cleaned it up and said you know he doesn't really mean that we're gonna clarify what he means and if we start to see that and you then you have everyone kind of has the answer right because the question is does he mean it is he going to follow through with it we've seen this movie before he made one back in January when it came to daca and he backed off that so I think that's gonna be the first indication of whether he intends to follow through at least what do you think anything follow through in this I know an r/a lobbyists were scrambling on Capitol Hill yesterday saying you got to do something put some pressure on the president we can't go through with what he laid out yesterday well the only policy that this administration has helped Shepherd through Congress's tax reform and that's because Republican Republicans in Congress were the primary drivers and they actually supported the legislation so here if he doesn't have any support from Republicans for embracing some of the more extreme gun control measures that are espoused by Democrats and I would also point out authoritarian just to take away due process blatantly and I think that both sides should be very skeptical of a policy initiative that they like with that he crouches on the due process but no I don't think that I think that this is just the same old tape that we've seen and just rewind it play it again Joe if we look at that tape again there's a moment there I think was in the last soundbite we played we're Diane Feinstein Democrat of California is literally giddy as she's listening to the president she's pointing at the other senators at the table she can't believe her luck and hearing what the president has laid out and saying finally something to the effect of finally a president has the courage to do the right thing well again we'll see what happens if the president's looking at the polls if he's seeing what's happening out in Pennsylvania 18 if he's seeing what's happened in Alabama if you remembers what's happened in Virginia he's saying that Republicans are getting slaughtered at the polls and in large part they're losing because you know their sides not excited they're getting pounded among educated suburban suburban voters and Willie the message that I heard yesterday and that I saw yesterday from a lot of gun rights activists and lobbyists saying well if Donald Trump moves on background checks he's going to lose his base or if Donald Trump moves on some of these other provisions he's going to lose his base obviously you're not gonna get rid of due process but if you move some of these other actions I would only say for those people who were saying Donald Trump will lose his base if he does X please look at the history he remember what he said about shooting somebody on Fifth Avenue and remember on policy matters in his South Carolina debate in the Republican primary Donald J Trump defended Planned Parenthood and he absolutely destroyed all of his political opponents that were in their people people are not going to turn their back on him if he goes with 90 percent of the Americans and supports to me and mansion's background check bill they won't it will actually help him and it will even help the Republican Party overall but I will see what happens again Dianne Feinstein was happy after he was talking about dreamers and right we saw how far that got yeah we'll see how long this holds at the briefing today Carol II thank you very much by the way Carol's got her adorable little guy with her five year old Hudson what times you wake them up today you own some ice cream Willa - yeah thanks Kara Eugene Robinson thank you as well coming up we'll
