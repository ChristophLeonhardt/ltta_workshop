♪ ♪ THE SUPREME COURT RULING WAS A TREMENDOUS VICTORY FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH AND WE HAVE TO BE SAFE AND WE HAVE TO BE SECURED. THIS IS A MORAL MOMENT FOR OUR NATION. A PRESIDENT WHO OPENLY WANTS TO PUT A RELIGIOUS TEST ON CITIZENSHIP. THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN AND YOU'RE PICKING UP COUNTRIES WITH HIGH THREAT LEVELS WITH POOR VETTING PROCESS, SO IT MAKES SENSE AND I THINK THIS MAKES IT NICE AND SAFER. Bret: TODAY THE SUPREME COURT HANDING PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS ADMINISTRATION A BIG WON MAJORITY THERE AND THE DISSENTING. THE OPINION ON THE MAJORITY PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY UNDER ATTEMPTS ANY SERIOUS ARGUMENTS TO THE CONTRARY." DOES LITTLE TO CLEANSE PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION NUMBER 9645 OF THE APPEARANCE OF DISCRIMINATION THAT THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS HAVE CREATED. WOULD CONCLUDE THAT THE PROCLAMATION WAS MOTIVATED BY ANTI-MUSLIM ANIMUS." AND WITH THAT LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL. BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE "WASHINGTON EXAMINER" ." MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST AND CHARLES SIGNIFICANT RULING TODAY? IT WAS. THIS WAS ALL WE WERE TALKING SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SLAM DUNK FOR WHITE HOUSE AND THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT IT WAS NOT IS REALLY AMAZING. OF THE PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS AND THE BIGGEST ARGUMENT AGAINST IT WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A LEGITIMATE PRESIDENTIAL POWER, THAT THIS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD EXERCISED IT WITH IMPURE MOTIVE AND YOU HAD A SITUATION IN WHICH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WORD FOR WORD IF SIGNED BY ANOTHER WAS SIGNED BY DONALD TRUMP WITH HIS HISTORY OF ANTI-MUSLIM STATEMENTS IT WAS THEREFORE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRAZY IT'S A RELIEF RELAY THAT THE COURT DID NOT DO THAT. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF WHETHER IT WAS A RELIGIOUS TEST ARE NOT POINTING OUT THAT USING A LIST THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED BY A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND THAT IT ALSO INCLUDED NORTH KOREA AND VENEZUELA SO THAT IT WAS HARD TO ARGUE THAT THIS WAS EVEN THOUGH THIS IS WHAT THE CONVERSATION HAD BEEN IN THE MEDIA, THIS IS A MUSLIM BAN AND EVEN DONALD TRUMP REFERRED TO IT IS THAT, THIS REALLY IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION DECISIONS ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY RELATED TO IMMIGRATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FARED WITH THE SUPREME COURT WHEN IT TESTED EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. IT REPEATEDLY WAS TURNED AWAY BY THE COURT, SOMETIMES BY 9-0 THE SUBJECT OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. Bret: HERE'S ONE COMMENTATOR ON ANOTHER CHANNEL WITH AN INTERESTING ANALOGY. OSAMA BIN LADEN HOPE TO PROVOKE WAS A WAR OF CIVILIZATION, AND WAR BETWEEN THE WEST AND 1 BILLION MUSLIMS. SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP AND THIS MUSLIM BAN SIGNAL TO THE WORLD IS THAT MUSLIMS ARE NOT WELCOME HERE, THAT THIS IS, WHETHER THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES SAY THAT IT'S ABOUT EXECUTIVE POWER, THE PRESIDENT'S CLEAR INTENT WAS TO IMPOSE A RELIGIOUS TEST AND THAT IS IS FUNDAMENTALLY ON UN-AMERICAN AS ANYTHING THAT HE IS DONE OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PRESIDENCY. LOOKING AT THE WORDS ON THE PAPER THERE? I WOULD LIKE TO JUST REACT TO THAT IN TANDEM WITH REACTING TO BYRON. BYRON IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IF YOU JUST TOOK THE 3.0 VERSION OF THIS, NOT THE FIRST TWO, WHICH WERE QUITE DIFFERENT, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS THE PROBLEM THE PRESIDENT CREATED FOR HIMSELF THROUGH ALL THIS EXTRAVAGANT HOSTILE RHETORIC TOWARDS MUSLIMS. GEORGE W. BUSH OF COURSE, WHO JUST THE ISLAMIST TERRORISTS AND SO I THINK THAT COMMENTATOR YOU JUST PUT UP THERE HAS A POINT THAT THE ATMOSPHERICS AROUND DECISION IS NOT EVERYTHING THAT HAS TERRIBLE ATMOSPHERICS THAT'S PERHAPS EVEN STUPID AND I DON'T CONSIDER THIS SO MUCH VICTORY OR EVEN A VINDICATION WHICH IS THE PRESIDENT'S OTHER WORD FOR THIS. I THINK WHEN HE GOT FROM THE SUPREME COURT TODAY WAS A RATHER BEGRUDGING ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT OKAY, YOU CAN DO THIS IF YOU INSIST. THERE'S NO RHETORIC IN ANY OF THE MAJORITY OR CONCURRING OPINION SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY STOP YOU SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD. Bret: BUT AT ITS HEART, AN INCREASE IN THIS 3.0 VERSION, THE STIPULATIONS TO GET IN, WHAT THESE COUNTRIES WERE DOING TO VET THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY TAKEN OFF BECAUSE THEY MET THE STIPULATIONS. IT'S HARD TO ARGUE THAT IT IN FACT I THINK THE FIRST VERSION OF THE VAN ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE HELD UP UNDER THE ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE ATMOSPHERICS INJUNCTION AGAINST A NATIONAL RULING. THIS IS A TREND THAT WE ARE SEEING A LOT, PARTICULARLY NATIONAL ISSUES AND CLARENCE THOMAS SPECIFICALLY SAID IN HIS CONCURRING OPINION THAT THIS IS BECAUSE IT MEANS WE ARE GETTING VERY NARROW DECISIONS BASED ON FAVOR OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DID VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET A 5-4 DECISION GROUPS TO ADVOCATE FOR ABORTION BUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE 5-4 DECISIONS MEANS WE WILL SEE THIS COURT CONTINUE TO BE A VERY POLITICAL ISSUE. Bret: IT ALL ALSO SHOWS H IS IMPORTANT IN THIS WORLD. McCONNELL AGAIN HE WILL, BUT HE SHOULDN'T. LOOK AT SOME OF THE PRECEDENCE OF THIS HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY. SECURITY INSTANCES AND ALSO IT SEEMED TO WANT TO CREATE SOME OF THE PROPONENTS, THE OPPONENTS OF UNITED STATES. INTO THE UNITED STATES AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE PRECEDENT. Bret: ARE LATE FRIENDS CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER WEIGHED IN ON THIS LAST YEAR. I'M NOT AGAINST TIGHTENING THE VETTING, WE SHOULD BUT I MAKE OURSELVES THINK THAT WE ARE SAFER FROM TERRORISM. THERE ARE A LOT OF SOURCES OF TERRORISM. THE WHOLE LIST, PROBABLY AT THE BOTTOM IS THE IDEA OF INFILTRATION FROM THE STATES. THESE ARE SEVEN STATES IN 15 YEARS SINCE 9/11, THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE MURDER OF AN Bret: TRUCK. THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD POINT. QUITE A FEW OF THE RECENT LONE WOLF ATTACKS HAVE TAKEN PLACE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER BORN IN THE UNITED STATES OR WHO WERE IN THESE PARTICULAR COUNTRIES, THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY DISJOINTED, IT'S NOT COMPLETELY DISJOINTED BUT IT'S TENUOUS. WHAT THE COURTS WERE WRESTLING WITH, PARTICULARLY CHIEF JUSTICE SO UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE AND I THINK THEY FELT WE ARE A VERY, VERY INFLAMMATORY PRESIDENT BECAUSE IT COULD BE USED LEGITIMATELY WHEN THE PRESIDENCY IS OCCUPIED BY A DIFFERENT PERSON LATER ON. Bret: MUST WORK. THE CIRCUIT COURTS THAT WERE WILLING TO DO THAT. NOT JUST THE NINTH CIRCUIT, THE FOURTH CIRCUIT. BIG MAJORITIES WERE WILLING TO
