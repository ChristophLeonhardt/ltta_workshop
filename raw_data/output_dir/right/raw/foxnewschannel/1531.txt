00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,610
24 HOURS ON YOUR RADIO SHOW, AND

16
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,179
YOU TOLD ME PRIVATELY, THAT THIS

17
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,315
VERY WELL VIOLATES OUR

18
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,983
CONSTITUTION AND MORE

19
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:41,984
SPECIFICALLY THE APPOINTMENT'S

20
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,318
CLAUSE.

21
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,820
I WANT YOU TO REALLY EXPLAIN

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,288
THIS TO OUR AUDIENCE TONIGHT.

23
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:47,656
>> FIRST OF ALL, THE SEED WAS

24
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:50,426
PLANTED WHEN I HAT TIPPED THE

25
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:51,894
PROFESSOR, AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE

26
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:54,997
WHO WORKED FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL

27
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:55,397
MEESE.

28
00:00:55,397 --> 00:00:56,665
THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE.

29
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:59,068
IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION.

30
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:00,603
IT APPLIES TO PRINCIPAL OFFICERS

31
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,338
OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

32
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:04,406
THAT'S INTERIOR OFFICERS, YOU

33
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:07,910
KNOW, LIKE A CHIEF, AN

34
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,078
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT, THEN

35
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,312
PRINCIPAL OFFICERS.

36
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:11,614
EVERY SINGLE UNITED STATES

37
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,215
ATTORNEY IN THE UNITED STATES

38
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:14,850
HAS TO BE NOMINATED BY THE

39
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,584
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

40
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:16,685
AND CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE

41
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:18,020
BECAUSE OUR FOUNDERS MADE CLEAR

42
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,022
THAT THEY WANTED BOTH BRANCHES

43
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:21,490
OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVED IN

44
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,927
APPOINTMENTS OF THE SENIOR LEVEL

45
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:25,794
PEOPLE.

46
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,131
YOU HAVE ASSISTANT SCARIES IN

47
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:29,765
DEPARTMENTS AND CABINET

48
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:30,633
SECRETARIES AND U.S. ATTORNEYS.

49
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:31,634
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

50
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,503
THE APPOINTMENT OF MUELLER IS

51
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:35,671
UTTERLY UNCONSTITUTION FOR A

52
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,006
NUMBER OF REASONS.

53
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,741
ROD ROSENSTEIN GAVE HIM AN

54
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,442
AGENDA THAT IS SO BROAD, NOT A

55
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:42,011
SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL, NOT A

56
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,879
SPECIFIC STATUTE, NOT EVEN A

57
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,781
SPECIFIC MATTER, AND NOT ONLY

58
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:46,949
WAS THE INITIAL APPOINTMENT

59
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:48,817
INCREDIBLY BROAD, HE KEEPS

60
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,519
EXPANDING IT.

61
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,920
SO THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL'S

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,789
DIFFERENT THAN PAST SPECIAL

63
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,156
COUNSELS.

64
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,458
HE'S MORE LIKE A ROVG U.S.

65
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,393
ATTORNEY.

66
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,428
ALSO, WE LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY

67
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:02,931
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

68
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:04,566
IT SAYS COURT FILINGS INDICATE

69
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:06,535
WHEN LAWYERS APPEARED IN COURT

70
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:08,270
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THEY DID SO

71
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,072
NOT ONLY AS REPRESENTATIVES OF

72
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,340
MUELLER'S OFFICE BUT THEY

73
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,476
RECEIVED AN APPOINTMENT, A

74
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:15,244

EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.

77
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:22,151
THEY ARE, IN EFFECT, ASSISTANT

78
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:23,452
UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS.

79
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:24,920
ROBERT MUELLER WANTED TO EXPAND

80
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,721
THEIR POWER.

81
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:27,589
THEY REPORT TO HIM.

82
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,491
IF THEY'RE ASSISTANT UNITED

83
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:31,193

ATTORNEYS THAT MAKES MUELLER,

86
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,330
WITHOUT QUESTION, THE EQUIVALENT

87
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,564
OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY.

88
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,599
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT HIM AND PAST

89
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,034
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND SPECIAL

90
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,469
COUNSEL IS THE MASSIVE BREADTH

91
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:41,637
OF HIS INVESTIGATION.

92
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:43,138

DOCUMENTS.

100
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:57,052
HE'S NOT AN INTERIOR EMPLOYEE,

101
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,187
LIKE AN STRAV ASSISTANT OR

102
00:02:58,187 --> 00:02:59,955
ANYTHING OF THAT SORT.

103
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:01,223
HE'S A PRINCIPAL OFFICER.
