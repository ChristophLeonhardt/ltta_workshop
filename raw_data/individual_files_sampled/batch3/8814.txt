REPUBLICAN SENATOR. Shannon: THANK YOU. WELL, HIGHLIGHTING POLITICAL INSTABILITY, PRESIDENT TRUMP’S LATEST MESSAGE IS LOUD AND CLEAR. THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR. DEMOCRATS PRODUCE MOBS. REPUBLICANS PRODUCE JOBS. Shannon: ALL RIGHT. LET’S BRING IN JUAN WILLIAMS AND AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "WHAT THE LET’S BRING IN JUAN WILLIAMS AND AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?" AND ERIC, HIS NEWEST BOOK. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. OKAY. YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE. HE’S HAD THIS LINE THAT’S BEEN VERY CATCHY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, "JOBS NOT MOBS," BUT HE VERY CATCHY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, "JOBS NOT MOBS," BUT HE ALSO HAD THIS PROBLEM. TRUMP’S VIDEO FOLLOWED A REMARK HE MADE WHERE HE SAID, DEMOCRATS TRUMP’S VIDEO FOLLOWED A REMARK HE MADE WHERE HE SAID, DEMOCRATS PRODUCE MOBS, REPUBLICANS PRODUCE JOBS. BUT HE ALSO DREW CRITICISM FOR JOKING ABOUT SOMEONE BODY SLAMMING A REPORTER. THE CROWD LOVED IT. BUT IS HE STEPPING ON HIS OWN "JOBS NOT MOBS" MESSAGE? NO, HE’S NOT. ACTUALLY, IT’S SO FUNNY TO ME BECAUSE IN A WAY THE "JOBS NOT MOBS" MESSAGE TIES IN TO THIS. YOUR AVERAGE AMERICAN MAY NOT SAY IT ON TV, BUT THEY SEE WHAT’S GOING ON. THE MOBS WE’VE SEEN, THE LACK OF RESPECT, THE LACK OF CIVILITY THAT THE LEFT HAS RESORTED TO IS HORRIFYING. IT’S AS UN-AMERICAN AS ANYTHING CAN BE. AND PEOPLE SEE THAT. YOUR AVERAGE AMERICAN, AS I SAY, THEY MAY NOT THINK OF THEMSELVES AS A AVERAGE AMERICAN, AS I SAY, THEY MAY NOT THINK OF THEMSELVES AS A CONSERVATIVE OR PRO-TRUMP, BUT IF YOU RUN OUT OF ARGUMENTS, YOU RESORT SO THIS KIND OF THING. BUT I REALLY THINK THEY DISGRACED THEMSELVES. WHEN TRUMP CRACKS A JOKE LIKE THAT, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN SEES IT AS A JOKE AND ENJOYS IT. I REALLY THINK THAT WE’VE NEVER SEEN THE BELTWAY ELITE AS OUT OF I REALLY THINK THAT WE’VE NEVER SEEN THE BELTWAY ELITE AS OUT OFTOUCH WITH MIDDLE AMERICA NEVER TOUCH WITH MIDDLE AMERICA NEVER IN OUR HISTORY. AND IT’S JUST A DRAMATIC DIVIDE. Shannon: THE CROWD IN MONTANA AND IT’S JUST A DRAMATIC DIVIDE. Shannon: THE CROWD IN MONTANA LIKES IT. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSING ON HOLDER, WATERS, AND SAYING, THIS BUT THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSING ON HOLDER, WATERS, AND SAYING, THIS HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. HE’S USING IT TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM. HE’S ATTACKING DEMOCRATS AND REPORTERS. AND I THINK IT’S KIND OF UNFORTUNATE GIVEN YOUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT. THIS WEEK HE’S SAYING IT’S SO FUNNY TO BODY SLAM A REPORTER. TO ME, AGAIN, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NO SNOWFLAKE, HE’S NO POLITICALLY CORRECT GUY. HE MAKES FUN OF THESE PEOPLE. WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL? BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MOCKERY, ABOUT GOING AFTER PEOPLE, AGAIN, BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MOCKERY, ABOUT GOING AFTER PEOPLE, AGAIN, I THINK PEOPLE THINK, WHAT IS GOING ON? THAT’S NOT PRESIDENTIAL. THAT’S NOT THE WAY THAT ANYBODY WOULD THINK AMERICA’S LEADER SHOULD BEHAVE. AND THEN OF COURSE YOU ACTUALLY INVITE THE IDEA THAT THE TRUMP RALLIES WHERE HE’S TALKING ABOUT THE AMERICAN PRESS IS ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE AND HE’S GOING ON, HE’S THINKING, HEY, GEE, THESE RALLIES GET OUT OF CONTROL. THEY LOOK MORE LIKE MOB THAN SOMEBODY SIMPLY CALLING SOMEBODY OUT AND SAYING, YOU’RE MY REPRESENTATIVE AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THAT’S RIDICULOUS. I’M AMAZED THAT YOU SAY THINGS LIKE THAT. I’VE WATCHED YOU FOR YEARS. I RESPECT YOU. YOU’RE FALLING INTO THIS TRAP OF TRYING TO PULL ANY POLITICAL THREAD YOU CAN. THE IDEA THAT THESE RALLIES, THAT ANYTHING BAD IS GOING ON, THAT’S SHEER NONSENSE. IT’S SHEER NONSENSE. YOU CAN RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS. IT’S NONSENSE. THE ONLY TIME PEOPLE SEE SIEL VIOLENCE IS WITH ANTIFA. REMEMBER THAT AT TRUMP RALLIES DURING THE CAMPAIGN YOU HAD FIGHTS BREAKING OUT AND THE RALLIES DURING THE CAMPAIGN YOU HAD FIGHTS BREAKING OUT AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING, GO AHEAD, I’LL PRESIDENT SAYING, GO AHEAD, I’LL PAY YOUR BILLS. THAT HAPPENED ONE TIME. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WAS THAT A REAL MOB? Shannon: WE’RE NOT SAYING THE PRESIDENT WAS ENCOURAGING ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. YOU’RE GOING BACK TO CHARLOTTESVILLE? YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. YOU’RE TOO SMART. YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. I HAVE SEEN VIOLENT LEFT-WING MOBS IN MANHATTAN. F THE COPS, F THE COPS. THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF CONTROL. A HUGE LEFT-WING MOB. AND YOU KNOW WHO WAS PROTECTING THEM? THE COPS. THEY WERE STANDING THERE WHILE PEOPLE PRACTICALLY SPIT IN THEIR FACE. THE REPUBLICANS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THIS MOMENT DON’T HAVE THE REPUBLICANS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THIS MOMENT DON’T HAVE A STRONG MESSAGE. THE TAX CUTS HAVEN’T WORKED. THAT’S A JOKE. THAT’S AMAZING TO ME. THAT’S HILARIOUS. Shannon: I THINK YOU’RE BOTH SMART INTELLIGENT GUYS. AND I DON’T THINK WE’RE GOING TO
