hey everyone well you are in the presence of some of the fiercest most dogged most critical reporters in the world so thank you all for joining me on stage and for your important important journalism I'm a huge fan of all of yours as we all should be and thank you for your work so what I want to talk about today is a bit of the story behind the story obviously without revealing any sources or sensitive information but I think people don't realize how these really important stories come together and how much work goes into them and what you all have to do to make sure that we're now all talking about this and then also of course some of just what's happening with the movement since your stories have come to light so first I wanted to talk about the first time that you caught wind of your subjects and so Kim has been doing this for years shining a light on all sorts of things you actually heard about Harvey Weinstein back in the late 80s I think maybe the early 90s yeah and so and THR has been doing a ton of reporting on this lately you did John Lasseter he brought him to light Roy Price who is the head of Amazon Studios you've worked incredibly hard to get that published I'm harder than you should have had to I think and then Jody Kanter did the now very famous Harvey Weinstein reporting for The New York Times mega - II couldn't be with us today because she's still reporting which is great as you all are behind the scenes - and then Aaron Aaron Carmen or cremone I'm sorry is the reporter who was able to bring Charlie Rose to light for the Washington Post so to start off how did you first start hearing about Charlie about John about Harvey and know that this is a story you need to start on right now first Kim are you sorry you actually I know for Harvey didn't you say to him one time in the late 80s I hear you rape women I I did and it's the first time I met Harvey it was a lunch in Beverly Hills I had written stuff about him that he didn't like he came rushing up to the table I was first so I met him face to face and he's yelling very aggressive why do you write this about me what do you write this about me what have you heard about me and I felt like you know I I have to do it right now and I said I've heard you rape women and I thought I'd never be able to tell that story of course it was an off-the-record lunch so I've never said exactly how he answered but I will say if not an outraged denial it was a really quite a feeling to think oh my god and know going forward that you know periodically would try again try again try again so it took until these guys and Ronan Farrow finally broke the door down but you know by then I was happy that anybody was doing it Roy price I had a source come to me and I I feel like it's important to say this because of you know there's been all of this thing about men treating women but the original sources on that were men who are very disgusted by this behavior and so I heard about it I had as you said a very difficult time and Lassiter you know once the Harvey story broke I got a call about Lasseter and I have to say that was the one where I thought can I just not hear this and I don't really like it was so big and he was such a you know was Pixar and Disney Animation and I will admit I didn't like dive for it but I knew eventually that it was real and we had to go forward and Jody you've said you know you knew this there was a graveyard almost of reporters that had tried to do this Harvey mind scene story and had not been able to get enough to publish so when did you know that this was a real story that you were gonna try and tackle on why now I do think that this happened now well the strange thing about the Harvey story is that it kind of entered a popular culture so on the one hand at the Oscar nominations in 2013 the comedian Seth MacFarlane made a joke about it he said he announced the five actresses names for some award and he said congratulations ladies you no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein so on the one hand it was discussed like that but there had never been a kind of real story documenting the allegations nothing had ever been nailed down so it was it was pretty intimidating but the way we came into it is that the times made huge commitment to sexual harassment reporting this year I know this sounds like a very a very long time ago but it actually wasn't my colleagues Emily Steele and Michael Schmidt broke open the Bill O'Reilly story about the payments he had mean to women over the years to quiet these allegations and you know internally there their project was obviously very important in terms of the impact it made in the world but it was important internally at the times too because it was really a wake-up call for us and it was the moment when we said as an organization how many of these stories are out there that are like this how many other women have been quieted we knew that sexual harassment existed of course but what really became clear is that the kind of mechanisms of silencing and cover-up might be far more vast and elaborate than anybody had realized and it was also a point when we said you know this is our duty as investigative reporters because we're in a unique position I mean I love your story about what you said to Harvey because to me it speaks to the social licence the journalists have I mean you're kind of superpower is that you could actually go up to him at a party and confront him about that which most people can't and so we said you know let's try to put the puzzle pieces together let's try to see if there's a pattern here and and that's when we started looking at the Harvey story and Aaron you had heard about Charlie Rose I think the story came together pretty quickly it sounds like 17 days or something yeah it was an unusual trajectory and I've said that it also stands on the shoulders of some of the reporting that was done including by the women on this stage and by Ronan Farrow I first became aware of the story in 2010 when I was a reporter at Jezebel and at the time it was two women what a job applicant one an assistant who had been sexually harassed allegedly by Charlie and it was so you know people talk about the open secret but I think if there was an open secret about Charlie Rose it was that he was flirtatious not that he was a predator in the same way as Harvey Weinstein so it was certainly dissonant with the public image at the time though I mean I think what's interesting you talk about the institutional commitment at the time where I was working you know we covered sexism and misogyny and systems that protect them but we didn't really have the institutional resources to report on it properly so I was given time I was given support to work on it but when none of the women that I had heard about second or third hand would would speak to me or we'd go on the record and I really couldn't get past the initial thing I was reassigned to something else and subsequently even just thinking about the fact that this kind of behavior merits the deep resources of a place like the New York Times or The Washington Post or variety or The New Yorker or The Hollywood Reporter I do think that that there had to be a shift to say that we're going to put serious investigative resources and everything on this so when when the cultural moment that emerged in the wake of the New York Times reporting and the New Yorker and the Amazon ROI price reporting happened I just thought I've got to go back to this I know I'm not the only person who went back to a cold case and I had a relationship with The Washington Post I had been writing for the outlook section and you know it's pretty unusual to have a freelancer walk up to you and say can I do this investigative piece about this very wealthy and well-connected well-regarded person but you know I immediately got the support that I needed from the Washington Post I was paired with a reporter named Amy Britton who I had never met before who was an investigative reporter and two editors on the investigative team and they just said you know tell us what you have and we started reporting together from there and 17 days later you know it was on the front page of The Washington Post and I do think that there had there had to be the readiness for these women also to process what had happened to them or what they said it happened to them and so I don't think that the story was right before and a few of them said I feel guilty that I didn't talk to you back then because I I have heard of other women that this happened to but I just wasn't ready and so you hear these names you know that this could be just a big story where do you start how do you start finding people reaching out to them and getting them to respond it's so sensitive where do you start well you know I've been in Hollywood covering Hollywood for quite a while so one of my good things that have that I haven't developed is a network of people and what I found doing this story in some cases it's even if I'm calling somebody about something else it's worth my while to drop what you know I'm looking into this because suddenly there's a connection I never thought was possible in the case of Amazon you know this one particular individual he gave me a tremendous road map I mean it he didn't just give it to me it was a look he you know I had to go meet with him and sit with him and gradually try this try that I mean the moment at the center of that one of the key people was ISA Hackett who's the daughter of philip k dick and had had this encounter with him and it took me forever just to find out which he kept giving me hints cuz he felt guilty and honestly about pulling her in if she didn't want to be pulled in as it turned out she wasn't tremendously courageous person but it still took her forever you know with Lasseter I cover an animation off and on you know I back to the days of Who Framed Roger Rabbit I know an animators and even though my connections in that world are a little rusty you know they're they're either a certain like people to call like try this and you know it was a waiting to happen at that point I think really waiting to happen so it depends you know just where it comes from and if that person is willing to say I'll tell people give me give me names to call even if you are confident they won't talk to me just because that helps me muddy the trail and protect my sources and Jody I mean you've done some blockbuster pieces for the New York Times before Amazon is one that stands out where you interviewed a hundred people for that Amazon story and got Jeff Bezos to respond and all these things but that's a very far different story than something like sexual harassment and in the entertainment world so how do you come in without a traditional I guess history on the beat in some ways I think it might have helped on Harvey that we were Outsiders because coming new to a subject does afford you on the one hand I didn't have anything like the long history and knowledge that Kim has about Hollywood it does you know reporting is all about cold calling anyway and it enables you to come to something completely fresh and you know and and somebody is not saying oh you know I hated that story you wrote three pieces you know ago or whatever I think that what the Amazons story and the Harvey story had in common was the challenge of getting people on the phone very quickly to engage you know everybody at Amazon signs an NDA I'm sure you face this as well so the first thing people say when they pick up the phone is I have an NDA I can't talk to you so it's sort of like before they even talk to you you're having the whole pre-negotiation over how you can make them comfortable and so that was a big part of the reporting process but I think another commonality that both the the Weinstein and the Amazon story have in common is that there were many people who were not okay with what happened and in some cases there were people who had done well there and had profited from working there and recognized that they were good parts about their of their experience but it was almost like they had been looking for a place you know to put these feelings and memories and looking for some resolution for what happened and so you sort of want to connect with those people in a way where you become the natural solution to some of those feelings that they've been harboring for a long time and you want those people to feel gratified like the New York Times cares about this like there's a you know there's a journalist who really wants to understand this experience and are there are there tactics you all used because you know once maybe you find a name of someone who might know you're right there's NDA's there's just fear of repercussions there's trauma that these people may have gone through or maybe they feel guilty like they know something but they don't want to throw a friend under the bus I guess that's part of the wrong way to put it but there's so many sensitive things here so we're there tactics you use or things that resonated that really made people realize what a big thing this will this could be like Emily Steele I know went to a yoga class across the country to talk to I mean what I my strategy is always to just go with integrity and I feel like that projects itself and you know I had a source with an NDA in an Amazon thing and she said I want to go on the record but what will happen to me should I go on the record and I said I can't advise you to do it like I just she was not a powerful player I just you know and I'm in many cases you know talking to ISA as Hackett as she thought about going public I would I would just say to her you you know you absolutely decide this is your call you know just to make it clear that we're not trying to be another person trying to get something out of them and mess with their heads we're we're trying to and I will say just quickly everyone that has come forward and we've had people who have written essays for us you know it called me and told me a story and I'm like can you write that they feel such catharsis and release and I feel like it's really important for the sources to know in potential sources that in every case I've dealt with so far it's just been a wait lifted it's interesting because I mean I've spent hours on the phone or in person with the women that we wrote about for the Charlie Rose story and you learn a little bit about why they might want to talk to you and why they might not want to talk to you and they have good reasons in both cases so some of the reasons that I heard was I want to support the Washington Post because they're investigating things that I care about or I don't want this to happen to anyone else or I read the Harvey Weinstein story and now I realize that what happened to me is similar we even had people who said the two of you are young women and we want to support you because Amy and I are both in our early thirties there so you hear all the reasons and then you hear all the reasons about why they don't want to go on the record which are all valid reasons we did not have NDA's in in the Charlie Rose PBS story but there were lots of good reasons I'm a single mom I'm between jobs I'm ashamed I'm you know I should have said no I should have thought more I should have gone to the apartment you know I have an abusive husband these are all reasons that came up again and again with the women who decided to go on the record and so what I think about what really made the difference in that piece first of all it's having names because you know they're bringing the full integrity of the process here and then it's also that we spent hours talking to them like human beings not being patronizing to them you know not being professional but also being responsible with the information that they told us not pushing too hard too soon I mean 17 days it was very fast but at the same time compared to the way you have to do other stories where you're like I need to go on the record right now to be able to just like I mean Amy and I were both on the phone at like 1:00 in the morning 6:00 in the morning spending the of different time zones checking in with them every day to see you know how are you feeling today even when you don't want anything and and you you know if you are reporting on this you're talking to people who have credible allegations of harm right where you you believe it enough to put it in the paper and it's you know substantiated in all of these ways and yet you're the one nagging them and telling them you need to you know you need to push past their initial consent you don't want to reach Ramat eyes anybody but you also need to make a good argument for why this is a really important story that will be so much stronger if your name is on it and if you tell the world this is what happened to me I think Arion hit on a really interesting dynamic which is that the nature of these allegations is that they feel they felt pressured in the past and so you don't want to pressure them as a reporter you don't want to like even evoke that dynamic the slightest bit but it's also your job to be to move forward with you know confidence and persistence persistence and a certain amount of proper reportorial aggression so it's a it's a really fine balance right and you have to be adversarial at times right you have to say like I need to ask you tough questions like why didn't you do this or where who else did you tell and you know what does that person know do they know the whole story so it's not the same as obviously going to Gloria Allred where you know someone will hold their hand and say I believe you no matter what you don't have to tell me anything so it's a it's kind of a complex relationship in that way was there a moment sometimes when you're reporting these you're knocking out a lot of doors and just not getting anywhere and then all of a sudden there's one source that's so helpful to you or they they tell you something you never knew before there may be like the lauren o'connor memo that was cited a lot maybe that was big get when you got it at the time was there something that happened that took it from like this is an important story but i don't know if i get it too like oh my god this is this is happening this is this is going very price amazon i was all by myself I didn't hear footsteps of any other publication so I don't know I think I think the key thing was that Issa felt that he was going to keep doing this to people and she couldn't stand that and her other side of the coin for her was you know I don't want my whole show my crew and my cast to feel this weirdness being in an Amazon and that it's uncomfortable but so that was a different thing I really had all too much time to be tortured principally trying to get the Rory price thing published with Lassiter I knew other people were chasing and I started feeling like you know this may be really not fun to do but you got to do it because it's I'm not it's not my job to wait to be scooped for Megan and I with the Harvey Weinstein story it was really all about the pattern it was about the process you know we wrote this in the first story I think the first story says something like women from all these different places over a 30 year time span women who don't know each other some women were employees some women were actresses and yet they told such similar stories they varied in their severity we now know that there's a range of allegations against Weinstein that range from you know sort of hotel-room harassment requests from us or massages on the one hand all the way to assault and rape so the severity varies greatly but there's also a kind of numbing repetition to the stories and it's sort of funny because when you're talking to the women sorry every woman's story is important and you know kind of should be honored in its own way and you want to listen to it very carefully but on the other hand when you're listening to it you're like yeah I mean I I don't I've never tried to count but the number of individual kind of like Harvey incident stories I've heard it's a really high number and the the pattern is really really striking and so that was the question we started asking in our reporting was how come we're hearing the same story from from so many people and it even seems like a cross stories like the bathrobe thing oh my god it's a pattern yeah well yeah when I read your Charlie Rose story you mean I was very struck by the idea of him inviting women into private spaces where you know he allegedly did these inappropriate things because that was so reminiscent of the Weinstein patterns I actually completely got chills reading that because the first time I met Charlie Rose which I don't like know him well he's sitting next to him on a couch in his hand went right there and then fast forward he called me which is a pattern you present in your thing and said what do you think I should ask this guest on my show and I read not until I read your story did I think geez he had me like two-thirds of the way yeah yeah I mean we you know when this story came out other women texted us or emailed us and said I can't believe he used that line on her to you know the line of southern where touches you know we didn't not everything was quantified in the story you know we kind of just focused on that the most important and the most serious allegations but there were certain commonalities I was gonna say exactly the same thing and you know I don't this was not a glib or a flip thing but at a certain point Amy and I took a piece of paper and we made a chart and we had each one of the behaviors that we saw ranging from leg grabbing all the way up to sexual assault allegations and we were kind of just checking off each of the women because and and so you know it was it was a very grim game of bingo where this came up again and again and when we started hearing those from people who had not worked at the same time at the show or you know had not been referred to us by somebody else even if they didn't know each other some people would say oh you should talk this intern or this assistant so it was at the cold call stage moving beyond the initial circle that that we realized that there really was a pattern and that it did involve you know like the bathroom and the Bellport house for example came up again and again and so one thing that's come up is this NDA culture it's talked about that a little bit are you talking about because I think there are two forms of NDA's that are important here there are the NDA's that company employees sign routinely and Amazon and The Weinstein Company and Miramax have all used those and then there are confidentiality agreements that come with settlements and that means that you know as as I think most people now understand if a woman has allegations the sort of routine response is that she goes to a lawyer and unless she wants to fully go to court which is very hard she often will get a settlement and the problem with those settlements is that they come with these really strict confidentiality agreements sometimes they're to the woman's advantage there are women who say I don't want anyone to know about this you know I want my life to proceed as usual etc etc but the confidentiality agreements can also be enabling in a way because the women are silenced and it means that the people who know the most about the problematic behaviors really can't warn other women you know or continue to report them or go public etc etc so those are the kind of - silencing elements that we've looked a lot at and how did you get around them with the NDA's I mean it's become a pretty routine journalistic conversation to ask people to break and he is it's interesting to me that you didn't want that one woman to do it I didn't I wanted her to yeah she was already telling me what she knew the question was would she put her name to it on the record and it would that point I thought I would be putting her a tremendous risk I I don't know that the law is particularly settled I think this is a huge policy issue that needs to be addressed covering a wrongdoing with these NDA's so I couldn't good conscience they go ahead because I called a couple of lawyers it was muddy and I thought I this girl had already been she was young low on the total I thought she'd already had enough happened to her I did not want to open her up to another round hmm and then with the with the confidentiality agreements that come with settlements you have to figure out a way how to report the settlement without putting the woman in legal jeopardy and what I'd say is that a lot of people end up knowing about settlements if you look at the settlements at Mara Max and The Weinstein Company it was not a case where only Harvey and the woman and like one other person knew about them they these settlements or processes they take a lot of people to be executed they create mystery right all the sudden a woman vanishes and you know she's gone from work and you know what happened people end up hearing about the settlements now the really interesting thing that's happening now is that women are breaking those confidentiality agreements we've had I think I want to say too so far Zelda Perkins and Ashley Matthau are Harvey Weinstein victims who have broken their settlement confidentiality agreements because they've essentially said I have to speak out now in the public interest about what's happened to me and as far as I know they haven't suffered any negative consequences for that I mean if somebody's already exposed for what they are the risk decreases you know at that point it's like you want to sue me you want to get into a discovery process about that is the enforcement process and once many people have broken it without repercussions is easier so talk about getting people on the record at the importance of it do you think your stories could you have even published if you hadn't had people on the record how do you move a source into that direction and get them to put their name on something that will follow them on Google everywhere they go to every future employer how does how does that work well I'm in the case of our story was really important for us to get people on the record the feeling is somebody who is such a public figure you know has works for three major media companies Bloomberg CBS or has relationships with Bloomberg CBS and and PBS you know you really want this story to be absolutely airtight nail down every word and all the names that you can I think so there were a few dynamics one dynamic was the safety in numbers nobody wants to be the first person so we had we were really lucky Amy and I that we were working with the same team of investigative editors who had just published the story on Roy Moore and that had three women and on the record so we were able to draw on their advice and their resources on the best way to do this and also to point our sources to the way that the Roy Moore story had been done which was with great sensitivity so part of it was at the beginning of the conversation saying to them there won't be any surprises you're not gonna pick up the Washington Post tomorrow and see your story right so there's like this is a long-term thing I'm not gonna rush you but that is something I'm going to be asking you and so that was sort of step one is to make it really clear to be really transparent about the process that you know this is not a gotcha game this is not any to push publish right this minute let's talk about what we can do here and then nobody wants to be the first but you also can't really you can't coordinate between them you have to keep the process that the integrity of the process very airtight and so at a certain point what we did was we we got permission from some of the women to share their stories with other sources without their names or with their names depending on what their preference was and so I just we just both started reading portions of the transcripts again with the woman's permission of an off-the-record conversation to the other women and with one of the first person to go on the record was a person who realized that someone had said she was violently assaulted after she had worked there after she had been an assistant to Charlie Rose and so she just said if this is gonna make a big difference for your story you know and again people have all kinds of good reasons not to put their name on this kind of story but that was ultimately what did it and there was another woman who we described in the story she feels like what happened to her wasn't very serious but she said if my name being in this will help the other women feel less alone then I will go on the record then we had you been we had three this was a big problem for me with the Amazon story because everyone who was a key source either worked at Amazon or had their business life depended on a deal with Amazon and I have to say I've strong been patan me somewhat unorthodox feelings because I had nobody on the record but five people agreed that if he were to sue us they would identify themselves and testify truthfully they agreed in writing and Amazon had acknowledged that he had been investigated so I felt like that should get us into the enzone I had that didn't convince every editor it ultimately kind of worked with a little little bit of a comment from Issa hackett and then she finally went all the way on the record but i i think that we don't name rape victims i don't i feel like we should be able to break these stories NPR the NPR story it was broken with nobody on the record because NPR did acknowledge the problem so i think we have to think maybe not so much like you must go on the record you're a victim I don't find the logic of that I feel like we should find other ways if people aren't willing or can't I don't think we should ask people to commit professional suicide to do a story so somehow we ran out of time here I really don't know how I sang the clock disappeared so I'm gonna ask two more questions cuz I've got like 30 more questions Oh Mike I'll make it to the pressure on you all you're dealing with these powerful people who have so much money and resources on you how do you deal with that like before leading up to publishing and after I think Ronan Farrow described it as like a Hogwarts moment with her Harvey Weinstein's lawyers were like letters of like threats were coming in from all of crevices of his house windows and chimneys so what was the pressure like on you all and how did you deal with it well the world has since learned that you know we and more importantly our sources faced significant intimidation and reporting the Harvey story I was I don't know if I was more horrified or amused you know to you know learn about like the attempts that had been made to dupe me and I mean I knew strange things were going on but more became clear afterwards and that a dose was prepared on me but I but actually in real time that was not the pressure I faced what Megan and I really felt over the summer was the pressure not to let the story slip away it scared us that so many great journalists hadn't been able to land it and once we understood the material that we were dealing with the sense of obligation that we felt as journalists and as human beings right I mean and I you know so much has happened since then but but remember that when we were doing the story over the summer very few people knew about it and the the I was terrified by the idea of of what it would mean to fail and so I think that was the greatest pressure that I faced well I guess for a final one this is created hopefully much more than a movement it certainly feels like we're at a moment in time where things are changing and people are able to come forward and feel empowered to do so do you think that are we just at the beginning of this is actual change happening is it gonna be a moment that passes and things will continue the way that they have been where do you think we are in this process I mean I think we are in an amazing moment of reporting and it feels like reporting is such a good way to talk about this particular kind of abuse of power because it's stopped short of let's put this way sexual harassment is not a crime in the workplace right it's a violation of someone's civil rights it violates a woman the reason we have sexual harassment laws they fall under Equal Opportunity laws so they have to do with people's workplace behavior and professional behavior and so I think that especially when it comes to sexual assault even which is under the criminal law the criminal system is the criminal justice system is not necessarily the best way for us to understand this as a social problem gossip where a lot of this lived before also I think ill serves all of the people involved in it investigative reporting I think can really help us understand just endemic of a problem it is it's not specific to any particular industry so I'm really encouraged by reporting organizations who are putting amazing people like the women on this stage on this story so that we can keep understanding all the nuances and all the complexity because now that we have so many stories to I mean you know we one of the people that we one of the women on the record and our story she wasn't she felt like you know oh I sent him emails after the fact that we're very sick a fan take like this completely disqualifies my story and I could say to her you know Asia Argento in The New Yorker story she had a consensual relationship with Harvey after and people understand her to be a victim so this is a really complicated story and I think that the reporting process in particular shedding light on all of the complex ways that this plays out in people's lives is something really important I mean for me I would just say I knew there was sexual harassment in Hollywood before I didn't realize how pervasive it really was and when I look at institutions Studios certain studios the agencies what I realized is the reason that women don't do better in terms of their representation in the workforce in the executive suites and all the jobs in Hollywood is because these guys have had a culture in many of these places that is an absolute free-for-all and they don't want women spoiling it and that is the real reason why women are so dramatically underrepresented year after year and what is supposed to be a progressive world these guys want to go to Vegas they want to have I mean I was listening last night to a story about a studio chairman and the outrageous conduct he doesn't want that spoiled by a woman witnessing that that's where we have to the only change comes when women are better represented and that club is broken up nice work I I just think that the reason why what's happening now is so important is that we're getting this horrifyingly realistic view into what really happens and I think all of us are shocked and saddened and riveted and staggered by the disappear by by what turns out to be the death the differential between appearance and reality I mean if we want to take it to the present and go back to yesterday and talk about you know kind of collectively learning about the Matt Lauer allegations part of what is really disturbing about those allegations is the difference between what was on the surface right of being this kind of genial morning TV host and then reading these stories and variety and The Times and other publications about what he allegedly did to women behind closed doors and so I think as long as you had that gap between appearance and then women's private experiences you know society can't begin to address those problems if we don't know about them right and so I hope that you know as Irene said it's kind of a reporting moment when we sort of need to reboot and learn the truth about what's actually happening and then hopefully we can move on well thank you all for your tremendous work the world is better for it and thank you keep it up thank you you
