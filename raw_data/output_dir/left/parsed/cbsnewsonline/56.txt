AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE GOING 
THROUGH THE PROCESS TO MAKE 
SURE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT AND 
JUST RIGHT. I 
WISH THE DEMOCRATS COULD HAVE 
DONE THIS A LOT SOONER BECAUSE 
THEY HAD THIS INFORMATION FOR 
MANY MONTHS. 
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE WAITED 
UNTIL LITERALLY THE LAST DAYS. 
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT A LOT 
SOONER. 
WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, WE 
WANT TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. 
ONE THING I WILL SAY, AS I 
UNDERSTAND IT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WITH 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND IT WASN'T 
EVEN BROUGHT UP AT THAT MEETING 
AND SHE HAD THIS INFORMATION. 
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, 
CERTAINLY, SHE WOULD HAVE 
BROUGHT IT UP AT THE MEETING 
AND NOT WAIT UNTIL EVERYTHING 
IS FINISHED AND THEN START THE 
PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN. 
WITH ALL OF THIS BEING SAID, WE 
WANT TO GO THROUGH THE FULL 
PROCESS. 
I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE 
U.S. SENATE AND THEIR 
PROCEDURES AND WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING AND I THINK THAT IS 
PROBABLY WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO 
DO, GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TO 
HEAR EVERYBODY OUT. I 
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND I 
BELIEVE THEY THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT. 
AGAIN, HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT 
INTELLECTS AND ONE OF THE 
FINEST PEOPLE ANYBODY HAS 
KNOWN. 
YOU LOOK AT HIS REFERENCES AND 
HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE 
LIKE IT. 
WE WILL GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS 
AND GET IT DONE. 
IT DEPENDS ON THE PROCESS BUT 
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THE PLEA 
PROCESS -- I LIKE EVERYBODY TO 
BE HAPPY AND I WANT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY 
BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING 
SOMEBODY THAT IS GREAT. I 
WANT HIM TO GO IN AT THE 
ABSOLUTE HIGHEST LEVEL AND TO 
DO THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
THIS. 
IF IT TAKES A DELAY, IT WILL 
TAKE A DELAY. 
IT SHOULDN'T, CERTAINLY, V -- 
BE VERY MUCH. 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP 
LONG BEFORTHIS. 
THEY HAD THE INFORMATION IN 
JULY, AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND 
THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO AND 
NOBODY MENTIONED IT UNTIL THE 
OTHER DAY. 
IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE THEY 
DIDN'T MENTION IT SOONER. 
WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, IT 
WILL, I'M SURE, WORK OUT VERY 
WELL. 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AN 
INDIVIDUAL THAT IS AS HIGH 
QUALITY AND INDIVIDUAL AS YOU 
WILL EVER SEE. 
>>  
>> I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
>>  
>> WHAT A RIDICULOUS QUESTION. 
>>  
>> I THINK HE'S ON TRACK. I 
THINK HE'S VERY MUCH ON TRACK. 
IF THEY DELAY A LITTLE BIT TO 
MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS HAPPY, 
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS WANT TO 
BE 100% HAPPY, THEMSELVES. 
THEY ARE DOING IT VERY, VERY 
PROFESSIONALLY. 
AGAIN, THIS SHED -- SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN BROUGHT UP A LONG TIME 
AGO. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> . 
>> WE WILL ANNOUNCE SOMETHING 
AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS TODAY 
ON CHINA AND IT WILL BE A LOT 
OF MONEY INTO THE COFFERS OF 
THE U.S. A LOT OF MONEY COMING 
IN AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT WE ARE 
DOING RIGHT AFTER CLOSE OF 
BUSINESS TODAY, THE MARKETS 
CLOSING. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WE JUST ARE PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP ADDRESSING THE 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIS SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE, BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
WAS ACCUSED BY A WOMAN OF 
HAVING ATTACKED HER AT A HIGH 
SCHOOL PARTY 30 YEARS AGO. 
IT NOW APPEARS THAT PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP IS OPEN TO 
DELAYING THE VOTE. 
HE MENTIONED THAT IF THEY DELAY 
IT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS 
HAPPY, -- BUT HE DIDN'T SEEM TO 
BE AGAINST THAT IDEA. 
HE CRITICIZED THE DEMOCRATS FOR 
NOT MENTIONING IT SOONER. 
CORRESPONDENT PAULA REID JOINS 
US NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. 
SHE WAS IN THE ROOM. 
PAULA, THAT WAS A REMARKABLE 
EXCHANGE. 
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE OPEN 
TO DELAYING THE VOTE. 
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT IN SO MANY 
WORDS, BUT HE DID SAY IF IT 
WILL MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY AND 
SORT OF PAUSED. 
AS A POSSIBLE THEY MAY DELAY 
THE VOTE OVER THIS? 
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 
YOU SAW THE PRESIDENT EMBRACING 
THE PROCESS. 
HE OFTEN TIMES CAN BE 
COMPETITIVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE 
IS PRESSED ON SOMETHING 
IMPORTANT TO HIS LEGACY AND 
ADMINISTRATION. 
HE WAS ELECTED TO APPOINT 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND NOW 
YOU SEE ONE UNDER SIEGE. 
WHEN REPRESSED THE PRESIDENT ON 
WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD BE OPEN 
TO DELAYING THE VOTE FOR A 
PROCESS OR TESTIMONY, HE 
WOULDN'T SAY YES BUT SAID IT 
DEPENDS, LET'S SEE. 
HE SEEMED VERY OPEN TO THE IDEA 
BUT HE ALSO CRITICIZED 
DEMOCRATS AND SAID THEY SHOULD 
HAVE COME OUT A LONG TIME AGO. 
DEMOCRATS HAVE MET WITH 
KAVANAUGH AT CERTAIN POINTS AND 
NEVER BROUGHT THIS UP. 
HE SEEMED CLEARLY FRUSTRATED 
BUT ONCE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 
BE HAPPY. 
HE SAID, QUOTE, IF IT TAKES A 
LITTLE DELAY, THEN IT TAKES A 
LITTLE DELAY. 
AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T KNOW IF 
THE CONFIRMATION VOTE WILL BE 
POSTPONED OR WHAT PROCESS THERE 
WILL BE. 
IT WAS INCREDIBLY SURPRISING 
FOR MANY OF US IN THE ROOM THAT 
THE PRESIDENT WAS SO OPEN TO 
THIS PROCESS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT 
SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT TO HIM 
AND HIS VOTERS. 
>> I AGREE. 
HE DID CRITICIZE THE DEMOCRATS, 
HE SAID, FOR NOT BRINGING THIS 
UP SOONER. 
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, THE 
ALLEGATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN KNOWN 
BUT THE ACCUSER DID NOT COME 
FORWARD PUBLICLY UNTIL VERY 
RECENTLY? 
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. 
SHE CAME FORWARD PUBLICLY VERY 
RECENTLY BUT IN THE LONG 
TIMELINE OF THE HEARINGS, HE 
SAID WE KNEW ABOUT THIS IN 
JULY, WHY IS THIS COMING OUT 
RIGHT NOW? 
HE DIDN'T DIG IN DEEPLY TO 
PARTISAN ATTACKS, HE SAID TO 
LET IT PLAY OUT. 
HE SEEMED VERY SUBDUED. 
HE HAD A BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE 
AND WAS SMILING AND CHATTING 
AND VERY CALM. 
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, HE 
TOLD ME HAD NOT SPOKEN WITH 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TODAY BUT 
REITERATED HIS CREDENTIALS AND 
SAID HE WAS, QUOTE, ONE OF THE 
GREAT INTELLECTS AND SAID HE 
WAS ABSOLUTELY DAZZLED BY HIS 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
IT APPEARS SOME OF THIS MAY 
COME FROM A PLACE OF CONFIDENCE 
THAT IF YOU ALLOW THE PROCESS 
TO PLAY OUT, ULTIMATELY, HE 
WILL GET THE JUSTICE CONFIRMED. 
>> HE SAID HE WAS ONE OF THE 
FINEST PEOPLE HE HAD EVER KNOWN 
AND DID DEFEND HIM. 
PAULA REID, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> FOR MORE, I WANT TO BRING 
IN LEGAL ANALYST, RIKKI 
KLEIMAN. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. 
BEFORE WE GET TO MANAFORT, 
LET'S DISCUSS THE KAVANAUGH 
SITUATION. 
IT HINGES ON EVENTS THAT HAPPEN 
30 YEARS AGO. 
AT THIS POINT, IS IT ONE 
PERSON'S WORD AGAINST ANOTHER? 
>> IN ESSENCE, IT IS ONE 
PERSON'S WORD AGAINST TWO, 
ULTIMATELY. 
WE HAVE THE FEMALE WHO IS 
SAYING THAT TWO MALES WERE 
INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT AND OF 
COURSE, THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE, BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 
ALSO MR. JUDGE. 
NOW, MR. JUDGE, ACCORDING TO 
THE FEMALE, IT WAS THAT MR. 
JUDGE JUMPED ON THE PILE AND AS 
A RESULT, THE PILE OF THE THREE 
OF THEM FELL APART. 
SHE WAS NOT ULTIMATELY SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED OR RAPED AT THAT 
POINT IN TIME. 
THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT 
LESSENS HER FEAR AS EXPRESSED BY
HER. 
DOES IT BECOME ONE PERSON'S 
WORD AGAINST TWO, AGAINST ONE? 
SHE TOOK A POLYGRAPH FROM A 
FORMER FBI CALLIGRAPHER. 
DOES THAT MEAN WE NOW HAVE TO 
SPREAD THE POLYGRAPHS AROUND? 
WHERE DOES IT STOP? 
>> HOW CHALLENGING IS IT FOR 
THESE CASES THAT GO BACK 
DECADES TO GATHER EVIDENCE? 
>> ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. 
UNLESS YOU HAVE REAL 
CORROBORATION, AND LET'S LOOK AT
THE MOST NEWSWORTHY -- IT HAS 
TO DO WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. 
AND, THE PREDATORY PRIESTS. 
WHAT HAD HAPPENED, WHICH WAS 
ASTOUNDING IN THOSE CASES, AT 
LEAST THOSE IN PENNSYLVANIA, 
WAS THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY 
RECORDS. 
THERE WAS RECORD KEEPING OF 
MOVING THE PRIESTS FROM PARISH 
TO PARISH. 
THEY WERE DETAILED RECORDS. 
ORDINARILY, IF YOU ARE LOOKING 
AT AN INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE 
THREE YEARS AGO, IT'S HARD 
ENOUGH. 
LET ALONE, 30 YEARS AGO. 
THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM 
WERE THE TWO MEN AND WOMAN, 
ACCORDING TO THE WOMAN. 
>> SO TOUGH. 
WHAT ABOUT THE CURRENT CLIMATE? 
YOU KNOW THE ACCUSATIONS THAT 
ANITA HIL MADE AGAINST 
CLARENCE THOMAS DID NOT PREVENT 
HIM FROM BECOMING A SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE. 
DO WE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT TIME, 
NOW? 
YOU KNOW, THE #METOO MOVEMENT? 
WILL THIS COLOR THE WAY THIS 
WOMAN'S ACCUSATIONS ARE TREATED 
AS OPPOSED TO THE WAY ANITA 
HILL'S ACCUSATIONS WERE 
TREATED? 
>> I WOULD ASSUME SO. 
FOR THOSE OF US AT A CERTAIN 
AGE, WE REMEMBER PRECISELY 
WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE WATCHED 
THOSE HEARINGS INVOLVING ANITA 
HILL AND HER ACCUSATIONS 
AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS. 
THEY WERE RIVETING. 
THE COUNTRY WAS WATCHING THIS 
ON TV. 
AT THAT TIME, YOU ALSO WERE 
DEALING WITH ISSUES THAT HAD 
NOT COME TO THE FOREFRONT, 
PUBLICLY. 
IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT AND IT WAS 
STATEMENTS OF SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT. 
IT WAS NOT AN ACCUSATION OF 
ATTEMPTED SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
HERE, YOU HAVE A MUCH MORE 
SERIOUS ACCUSATION, BUT YOU ARE 
IN A CLIMATE WHERE, NOW, THE 
WORD OF THE ACCUSER IS THE WORD 
THAT HAS BEEN BELIEVED ACROSS 
SOCIETY IN RECENT MONTHS OR 
SINCE HARVEY WEINSTEIN. 
THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT TRUE AT 
THE TIME OF ANITA HILL. 
>> A WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
HOW THAT FACTORS IN. 
NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO PAUL 
MANAFORT. 
HE ACCEPTED A GUILTY PLEA AND 
HAS A DEAL. 
HOW WILL THIS IMPACT MUELLER'S 
PROBE GOING FORWARD? 
>> BOB MUELLER HIT THE MOTHER 
LODE. 
WHEN YOU HAVE, FIRST OF ALL, 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HE GETS. 
HE GETS A LOT OF MONEY. 
HE GETS MORE MONEY IN 
FORFEITURE, NOT ROBERT MUELLER, 
BUT THE U.S. TREASURY -- HE GETS
MORE MONEY FROM THE FOUR 
PROPERTIES OF PAUL MANAFORT.
