didn't think bubbles could go.

Guys, this has been pretty crazy.

- Yo, this daily vlog life
got me with bags under my eyes, bro.
Hello guys, and welcome
back to another daily vlog.
6:00 p.m. every day.
Let's do this.
6:00 p.m. every day. Let's do this.
I'm kind of liking that as a new intro.
Tell me what you think.
Anyway, I've just woke up,
just got a bath, just got out the bath.
Today I'm off to Jake's
house, or Jake Mitchell.
You should know him as a
YouTuber similar to me.
We're gonna film some stuff, chill.
It's gonna be really fun.
I'm literally setting off to
his house in about an hour
and I need to get more ready,
but yeah, you got a vlog bro.
The vlog comes first.
But anyway, yeah. He
lives down in Hereford,
and I live around Sheffield,
so that is a three hour train journey.
I'm sacrificing three hours
to come down there to Jake's,
so he better be happy,
you know what I'm saying?
Well guys, if you're excited
for the videos I'm gonna do with Jake,
remember to leave a like on the video
and subscribe to my channel if you're new.
I'm trying to get to two
million before my birthday,
which is the sixth of August,
so I need you guys to subscribe.
But anyway, this has become
a vlogging tradition.
Gotta come down and see how mum's going.
Is there a wild mama down here?
I see the wild mama.
- Hiya.
-  How is your day going?
- Good.
-  Looking
good, mum. Looking good.
I like the outfit.
- It's casual today.
Got tired, you know.
Mended the hoover 'cause
a piece fell off it.
- How interesting. Vlog footage. Mended a hoover.
So mum, when am I leaving?
How long have I actually got?
-  You've got to go
at half past one really.
Forty minutes something.
- I haven't done my hair.
I'm not dressed.
I'm not packed.
This is literally the
most Morgan thing ever.
Technically, it's dinner time,
so that's my only excuse,
but yeah, this is the first
meal I'm having today.
This is my breakfast.
Noodles and a Diet Coke.
What a lovely breakfast.
Okay guys, I'm just midway
through getting ready right now.
I'm gonna have to take
two separate rucksacks.
But yeah guys, mum's gonna give me a lift
to the train station.
We're setting off now,
so I'll see you in about five minutes.
So we're in the car right now with mum.
Don't crash, if you crash then...
-  No, I'm focused.
- Focused, that's good.
Guys, we're on the way.
Just on the way to the
train station right now,
then we got a three hour train.
It's gonna be terrible, but whatever.
- I'm looking forward to it.
-  What the hell
are you looking forward to?
- Just having a couple of
days with Jake in Hereford.
I'm looking forward to it.
-  Will you enjoy it without me?
- Why, you not going to Hereford with me?
Are you not coming?
-  Mum, stop.
Mum, the train's here.
- I know, I'm so excited.
-  I gotta break it to you.
You can't come.
- What?
-  You're just,
you've not been invited.
- You said I was coming with you!
And I've got my things.
- Yeah, mum.
- Seriously?
-  Bye.
See ya.
- Love you loads.
- Bye.
(hip hop beat)
Alright, we've arrived in Hereford.
I've just seen Jake's car.
Approaching it now.
Here he is.
It is such a nice day today.
Blue sky.
Jake, seriously.
This is mental.
I could live in that.
That is a perfectly acceptable house.
That is mental, oh my God.
I just got my studio done.
My studio's just a little room.
He's got a full-on house, bro.
That's mental.
I think my studio definitely tops this.
-  We did it last night.
We didn't film it though
because we didn't know
if it was gonna work,
and it works.
It seriously works.
- Oh no way, no way, no way.
Right, we're heading out already guys.
Basically, I've came here.
I've just changed into my
swimming trunks, and yeah.
We're doing a huge Slip 'N
Slide video on his channel
so we're gonna go out now.
I'm actually really pumped for this.
I wasn't expecting this, but yeah.
Anyway, yeah guys.
It's time to do a massive Slip 'N Slide.
Here we see some lovely
trees and a lovely blue sky.
And here is a big mat in
the middle of the field.
This is some intense action right here.
It's slimy, it's greasy.
What, is the water cold?
I haven't even thought about this.
- You don't want too much more
'cause it'll just get you wet.
- It better not be cold.
Wait, what you pouring?
- I should be getting paid for this.
This is manual labour.
-  YouTuber's
aren't meant to do this.
(cheerful music)
- Well guys, 30 minutes
later, one injured knee.
Guys, I've picked up a knock
and I need a substitution
so I've been filled in for.
Look at this. Look at this.
We've been taken over,
we have been taken over.
For real, though, guys.
I am ... just look at this.
The soap's actually
gone through to my belly
without even taking my top off.
This is just crazy.
- I have got bubbles where I
didn't think bubbles could go.
- That sounds horrid, doesn't it?
Guys, this has been pretty crazy.
Guys, I've just been down ten more times.
I'm not even joking.
I'll show you all the
bruises I've got later
when it's more clear but I swear, my leg.
I've landed on the same
place about 20 times.
My leg absolutely kills me, yeah.
Honestly, this has been fun
but then kind of not fun.
Dangerous, let's just say that.
The full video will be out
soon on Jake's channel.
I'll leave a link to his
channel in the description.
So get ready for that,
you'll want to watch
this full video, guys,
that's all I'm saying.
But, yeah, at the moment it's just kind of
coming to an end and the
kids are enjoying it still.
It is a very nice day.
It's been pretty good
except for my, my leg.
It's kind of hard to see, guys,
but this is my natural tone
and then this is kind of
on my bum, I do warn you.
It is literally just a big red mark.
I don't know if you can see it too well,
but that's one of them.
There's loads more.
My knee's literally bright red.
I think you can see that.
It's kind of hard.
Overall, it's just not looking
too good down on the legs.
-  Hey Lee, how was that?
- I'm dying. Help me.
- That was crazy, wasn't it?
Did you enjoy it?
-  It was pretty crazy, yeah.
What's a nice way to say this: bum cheeks?
- Bum cheeks.
-  They got fully
ground in the grass.
Right, so we've just got to Jake's house.
We've got some subscribers
who're just at the gate
and they say they want to be in the vlog
so gotta put them in the vlog.
Guys, how's it going?
Introduce yourselves.
- Hi, my name's Harry.
- Josh.
- And Harry as well.
-  Well guys, thanks a lot
for all the support, there ya go.
Sweet. See you later.
-  Cheers, thank you.
- Yo, what's up guys.
Basically, I've just got changed.
I'm in just some joggers
and then this top.
This may look like the same top
but this is a fresh top
with the same design.
I've got my swimming trunks in here.
Basically, what we're doing
now, we're going to the spa.
These lot go all the time.
- Let's go.
- I've never been to it.
I don't think I've ever actually
been to a spa in the UK.
It's just not what I ...
Guys, I'm excited, we're going now.
Outdoor pool, outdoor ... what is it?
Hot tub, jacuzzi?
Amazing, I can't wait, guys.
I'm very excited.
I feel like I'm too excited for this.
I feel like a few swimming
pools, but I'm ready, guys.
I'm ready.
First time in a spa, it's
so exciting, oh my god.
-  I can't tell
if this is a fight or not.
- No, we're just hugging.
-  It's flirting.
I think that's just flirting.
I think that's what it is.
- You come to his house,
Lee, and then you're
aggressively, flirtatiously hugging him.
I'm getting a bit of a vibe here.
Aahh.
I'm in this entire room
and the first thing
that caught my eye, apart
from Lee, was this Swegway.
I just love these, they're just too fun.
They're just too fun,
just spinning on them.
This is the life, this
is the life right here.
I think we're ready.
- Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready!
-  Oh my god, Jake, seriously.
You get so much pussy.
You get so much pussy.
I get no pussy.
- They ran away, I have no pussy.
-  Oh, yeah, okay.
I bet you're holding the door.
Oh, did you take it out?
Let's go, wa-hey!
Oh my bag, what the hell!
You've got my swimming
shorts and all that.
-  Is
it in the studio, Morgz?
-  Yeah, cheers.
Guys, I think I got that on camera
because my camera was recording.
Came all the way to the
car, locked the studio
and left my bag with my
swimming trunks in the studio.
Great start.
(hip hop beat)
- Right guys, we've just
pulled up at the spa.
The Leisure Centre.
The thing is, you're not
allowed to film in here
and I've got a huge camera.
- I've done it before and
I'm on my last strike.
- He's done it before and
he's on his last strike
so I would, just to screw them over,
but this is a pretty big camera
and I've gotta be careful.
So guys, I'll tell you how it is.
I think they've just locked me ...
I'm not happy, I'm not happy about this.
I have been locked in, against my will.
Guys, I'll update you
after we've been in there.
So I'll see you guys in an hour?
Two hours? An hour?
Whatever guys, I'll see you soon.
Just come back to the car with Jake's keys
because I forgot my towel
and my swimming trunks
and we got through to the changing rooms.
Well done, Morgan, I'm just really good.
I'm just good at life.
Guys, I'm going back in.
I'll see you later.
Right, guys, it's little bit dark
so I don't know if you can
see me but two hours has gone.
70% charge on my phone has gone.
Guys, that was pretty ... oh, okay.
That was pretty good guys.
Had a good time.
Now we're going back to Jake's
but check this out, right.
I deliberately left my phone on 1% so ...
Why is it disabled?
Five minutes!
Are you joking?
I'm on 1%, no!
Oh my god, guys.
I left my phone on 1% so
I could follow some people
and start a follow-some-dude-on-Twitter
follow spree
and it's gonna take five
minutes and it's on 1%
so it's gonna die.
That's a nightmare, I'm not
happy about that one but ...
Anyway, I guess I'll do the follow spree
when we're back at Jake's.
(hip hop beat)
- Yo, guys.
Wait, is my mic on?
Yep, it is.
Yo, guys. We're back now.
I'm just gonna leave that in.
We're back now in the studio.
To be honest, it's been a really good day.
Though, the aftermath
from the Slip 'N' Slide,
my bum, my boom, is very red
because what happened was I
went off the Slip 'N' Slide
and because I was still
sliding, my shorts pulled up.
Wedgie, basically.
So I slid across the grass
and I did that five times
so it really hurts,
guys, I'm not gonna lie.
And my leg, obviously.
But yeah, we're just chilling now.
We're gonna watch a film, I think.
Jake, what's it called?
-  Haunted House.
- Oh, wow.
We're gonna watch Haunted House.
So on my Twitter, which is @MorgzHudson,
I love following you guys back.
I follow loads of you back.
I do follow sprees all the time
and I started doing a follow spree
while I was in the hot tub in the spa.
So retweet and turn on my
notifications for a follow.
So guys, since I didn't get
to follow too many of ya
while I was in the spa, because my phone,
Imma follow, Imma follow,
Imma follow, Imma follow
How many are we doing?
Follow, follow, follow, follow.
You don't get a follow.
He can get a follow, but
yeah, you can't get a follow.
Do you know who can get a follow?
Kevin, Kevin Carney, he can get a follow.
-  Oh, Kev.
-  Big Daniel Paterson,
he definitely can get a follow.
And this person can get a ...
Oh, I just unfollowed, okay.
Oh no, I'm their request.
Oh my god, I'm sorry whoever that is.
They're gonna have to
send me a follow request.
Yeah, let me get four more.
Five, six, seven.
Boys, there we go.
Add my Twitter, I do these
follow sprees all the time.
Morgan @MorgzHudson, guys,
give it a follow right now.
And yeah, you never know,
maybe I'll follow you back.
Still not gonna follow you back, though.
Are you vlogging?
Are you Snapchatting me?
I'm not happy about this.
(TV noise)
