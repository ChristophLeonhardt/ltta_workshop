1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,330
March 25th 1992 was a big day for
Pakistan the national cricket team beat

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,620
England to win the world

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,650
Imran Khan was the face of victory the
Pakistani captain was already a global

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,900
celebrity and he had a reputation for
being a handsome bachelor but almost 30

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,180
years later Khan's public identity has
completely changed he is now Pakistan's

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,660
new prime minister

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,820
So how did
Pakistan's cricket superstar become its

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,379
new leader and will he be the one to
bring change in a country that has long

9
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,480
been controlled by its powerful military

10
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,560
Oh
from a young age imran khan was exposed

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,520
to foreign influences he grew up in
lahore where he attended british prep

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,540
schools and eventually went on to Oxford
University where he sharpened his

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,560
cricket skills living in England Khan
started gaining popularity as a

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,490
cricketer he embraced his life in the
West and became a staple of celebrity

15
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,140
culture his athletic career lasted more
than two decades after winning the World

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,780
Cup in 1992 he retired from the game
initially he stayed away from politics I

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,490
am NOT meant to be a politician there
not everyone becomes the prime minister

18
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,920
to help his country in 1994 he opened
the first specialized Cancer Hospital in

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,210
Pakistan around the same time he started
shedding his ladies-man image and

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,100
re-engaged with religion he married his
first wife of three British heiress

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,340
Jemima Goldsmith's
who converted to Islam after they

22
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,330
settled in Pakistan where he further
distanced himself from his life in the

23
00:01:51,330 --> 00:02:00,690
West in 1996 Khan created his own
political party the PTI he promised to

24
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,649
build an Islamic welfare state that
would take care of the poor and hold the

25
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,758
people in power accountable only few
people are held accountable the rest who

26
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,709
unknown crooks get away with it come
back to fight another nation he had a

27
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,970
strong anti-corruption message and
positioned himself as the alternative to

28
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,650
Pakistan's two political dynasties the
sherrif's and the Bhutto's who had been

29
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,630
trading off power and corruption charges
for decades at first Khan's party had

30
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,110
little success failing to win a single
parliamentary seat in the 1997 elections

31
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,540
but several years later in 2013 Khan's
party won control of a northwestern

32
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,620
province bordering Afghanistan his
anti-corruption agenda has started

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,599
gaining ground especially among young
Pakistanis and it was working on a

34
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,880
national level he went from being the
longshot to a strong political contender

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,080
in the election for prime minister he
lost in a wash to wreath of the Sharif

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,440
dynasty but was now a key political
player in Pakistan

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,489
as a cricketer Imran Khan was a reliable
performer but as a politician he has

38
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,250
taken some unexpected turns in 2013
Khan's party called for a review of

39
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,239
Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law
which carries a death penalty for

40
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,890
insulting Islam they said religion was
being misused to attain power in the

41
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,750
majority Muslim country now five years
later Khan has been criticized for

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,940
defending the same law earlier as part
of his anti-corruption stance Khan

43
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,170
denounced opponents Sharif's party but
later he recruited candidates from the

44
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,180
same party to boost his own Khan has
also been criticized for his leniency

45
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,459
with the Taliban in 2012 after 14 year
old Malala yousufzai was shot in

46
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,739
Pakistan by the Taliban for championing
education for girls Khan showed support

47
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,160
for the militant group at large calling
their fight a justified holy war.

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,940
Khan blames the US for the rise of extremism in the region.

49
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,500
He has long been a critic of US

50
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,239
military intervention in Afghanistan
particularly the drone strikes along the

51
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,089
Pakistan border this anti-american
sentiment resonated with large parts of

52
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,880
the Pakistani population that see the
US as an enemy

53
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,190
his own solution for the Taliban is
centered on peace talks a push that has

54
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,570
earned him the nickname Taliban common
so you're basically recommending a

55
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,040
strategy of negotiation with the Taliban
and a complete elimination of the drones

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,630
if I hear you properly it is the only
way believe me it is the only way

57
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,440
what makes khan's tolerance of the
Taliban interesting is that it seems to

58
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,030
align with the interest of the Pakistani
military the military's power can be

59
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,490
traced back to 1947 when British India
was divided into two countries a Muslim

60
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,350
majority Pakistan and Hindu majority
India as people migrated to the country

61
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,540
of their religion intense violence broke
out the Pakistani military stepped in to

62
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,130
settle conflict at the border becoming a
symbol of national identity and the

63
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,480
establishment that held a new country
together since then the military has

64
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,950
controlled all national security and
foreign policy matters one of their main

65
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,930
concerns is the war in Afghanistan which
benefits them in two ways on one hand

66
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,370
the US has paid the Pakistani military
billions in exchange for routes to the

67
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,620
country to continue their fight with the
Taliban at the same time the military

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,940
supports the Taliban because the
instability in Afghanistan keeps the

69
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,599
country isolated from Pakistan's rivals
especially India

70
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:52,429
the military has also interfered with
the democratic process within Pakistan

71
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:56,719
since independence it has either ruled
the country directly or controlled it

72
00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:01,879
indirectly Pakistan has had 22 prime
ministers and none of them has ever

73
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,300
completed a full term
they either resigned they were

74
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,219
terminated they finished a term they
didn't start or they were assassinated

75
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:16,069
there were also three successful
military coups because of Pakistan's

76
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,419
tense political past the election was
high stakes in the months leading up to

77
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:24,949
the vote religious extremist groups try
to destabilize the electoral process

78
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,119
by killing at least 200 people in a
string of attacks including a polling

79
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,800
station bombing on Election Day that
killed 31 people just weeks before the

80
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,629
2018 election Khan's opponent former
Prime Minister Sharif was convicted of

81
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:42,860
corruption and sentenced to 10 years in
jail the military was accused of

82
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,259
engineering Sharif's downfall and
clearing the wafer Khan Khan went on to

83
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,830
win against bilawal Bhutto and Shahbaz
Sharif the new candidates from

84
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,599
Pakistan's political dynasties his win
was followed by protests and accusations

85
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:01,069
of election fraud which he said he would
investigate and on August 18th

86
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:06,559
Imran Khan was sworn in as the Prime
Minister of Pakistan since the victory

87
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,380
his corruption message has remained
front and center:

88
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,720
 

89
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,560
But his anti-american stance seems to be
shifting:

90
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,579
 

91
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:29,930
Whether leader will bring about the change he promised is still uncertain the only

92
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,529
certainty is that his leadership will be
shaped by his relationship with

93
00:07:33,529 --> 00:00:00,000
Pakistan's most powerful authority: the
military.
