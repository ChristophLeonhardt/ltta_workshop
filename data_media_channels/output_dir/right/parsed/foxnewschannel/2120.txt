FORGIVENESS.
GREAT TO SEE HE IS DOING SO MUCH
TO HELP OTHERS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL,
DEMOCRAT FROM SAN FRANCISCO BAY,
HAS A SOLUTION FOR GUN VIOLENCE.
HE SAYS "WE SHOULD BAN
POSSESSION OF MILITARY STYLE
SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS.
WE SHOULD BUY BACK SUCH WEAPONS.
AND WE SHOULD CRIMINALLY
PROSECUTE ANY WHO CHOOSE TO D
FIRED BY KEEPING THEIR WEAPONS."
THE BAND WOULD NOT APPLY TO
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OR
SHOOTING CLUBS.
WE ARE JOINED BY EMILY MILLER.
SHE IS IN DALLAS AT THE NRA
CONVENTION WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP
IS SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS THE
EVENT TOMORROW.
EMILY, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH
US.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT PLAN?
SOUNDS LIKE CONFISCATION.
>> IT IS EXACTLY.
I HOPE THAT CONGRESSMAN GOES
PERSONALLY TO CHECK EVERYBODY'S
HOUSE IN AMERICA TO SEE IF THEY
HAVE AN AR-15.
THAT WILL GO OVER REAL WELL.
YOU KNOW I'M KIDDING.
OBVIOUSLY IT'S RIDICULOUS.
WE DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL
REGISTRY.
THIS IS NOT HITLER.
IT'S NOT CUBA.
WE DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL
REGISTRY.
WE DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS THESE
GUNS.
I CAN PROMISE YOU AS A GUN OWNER
AND COMING HERE SPEAKING TO TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER PROUD GUN
OWNERS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE
SECOND AMENDMENT, THEY ARE NOT
GOING TO TURN IN THEIR AR-15s.
>> Shannon: LET ME TALK TO
YOU --
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME
POLLING WE HAVE.
WE SAW SPIKE AND THOSE WHO
THOUGHT WE NEED TOUGHER GUN
CONTROL LAWS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
OF COURSE AFTER THE PARKLAND
EVENT.
IT WAS TRAGIC.
THERE WERE YOUNG PEOPLE LOST.
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ADVOCATING.
THEY HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF
ATTENTION.
THAT HAS DROPPED OFF, LIKE IT
ALWAYS DOES AFTER THE EVENTS.
56% OF PEOPLE SAY THEY SUPPORT
TOUGHER GUN LAWS.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE
NUMBERS?
>> OBVIOUSLY THESE RARE MASS
SHOOTINGS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN
PARKLAND AND WHAT HAPPENED AT
SANDY HOOK YEARS AGO AS WELL,
WHAT HAPPENED IN SUTHERLAND
SPRINGS CHURCH HERE IN TEXAS,
THEY ARE RARE.
IT'S GENERALLY ON AVERAGE AND
GOVERNMENT FIGURES,
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE,
LESS THAN 50 PEOPLE A YEAR ON
AVERAGE.
THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN BAD.
WE'VE HAD LAS VEGAS, PARKLAND,
REALLY TERRIBLE TRAGEDIES.
THEY WERE LONE WOLVES.
THEY ARE NOT TERRORISTS.
THIS IS NOT INTERCITY CRIME.
OF THE TEN OR 11,000 PEOPLE A
YEAR KILLED BY GUNS, HOMICIDE
BY GUN, ABOUT 300 TOTAL ARE
BY RIFLES.
THE ISSUE ON GUN VIOLENCE IS
INTERCITY GUN VIOLENCE AND
HANDGUNS.
>> Shannon: WHY DON'T YOU
THINK THAT GETS TALKED ABOUT?
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL
ADDRESS IT TOMORROW?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO
GET INTO THE DETAILS.
HE IS A BIG PICTURE GUY.
IT DOESN'T GET TALKED ABOUT
BECAUSE THE LEFT GETS ENERGIZED,
AND YOU HEARD CHRIS TALK ABOUT
THIS A MINUTE TO GO, THE LEFT IS
ENERGIZED BY THE IDEA OF GETTING
ALL OUR GUNS.
THEY LOVE THE IDEA.
THEY BRING UP GUN VIOLENCE.
YOU WILL HEAR AUSTRALIA TO THE
POINT WHERE I HAD TO NEW TO THE
WORD AUSTRALIA IN MY TWITTER
FEED BECAUSE I COULDN'T STAND TO
LISTEN TO IT.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONFISCATE
ALL THE GUNS IN AMERICA.
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAVE BEEN.
WE HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT IN
THE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS WE
HAVE THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT FROM
GOD TO DEFEND OURSELVES WHICH
THE SUPREME COURT HAS
INTERPRETED, AS YOU KNOW BETTER
THAN I DO, THE SUPREME COURT
DECISION IN HELLER WHO I SAW
TONIGHT IN DALLAS.
THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT TO
OWN A GUN AND KEEP IT AT HOME.
>> Shannon: PART OF WHAT HE
HAD TO SAY IS THAT THEY HAVE
BEEN TOO NICE WHEN IT COMES TO
THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
HE BELIEVES IT'S TIME TO CONTROL
GUNS MORE.
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT'S
HAPPENING WHERE YOU ARE IN
