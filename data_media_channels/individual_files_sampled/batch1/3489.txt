I have opinion onward the company will go I will say this you know Vince is a very healthy still works out like a crazy man it really takes care of himself so he ain't going anywhere soon we don't want him to go anywhere soon he's the rock pit that Milt that thing he's he's the rudder in the water it's an amazing company I think that I was guessing and this going struck would be a guess that the money would be on probably Paul Levesque to be business successor I think Vince is kind of preparing him for that in a lot of ways you always knew that he was different from the other guys because he was very studious and very under control he didn't drink no drugs he looked like to be a lifer early on and he got a lot of that from this been a fan all his life going on the northeast New Hampshire then getting trained by killer Kowalski there's a great old-school guy so I think he's part of the heir apparent Stephanie's very involved and you know it's really more of a face of WWE she doesn't like charity work and she's great at that and you got to have that in that world I think Shane seems to be apparently contented being a TV character I don't know where his role is gonna be going forward or what he wants it to be but I think that Paul Levesque is the one that seems to be earmarked to be the next guy if and when Vince is not in that role but Vince is a he's a unique cat man for him to get a publicly-traded company and wrestling are you kidding think of the image that resting has had for so many years and I will tell you that if Vince had not reinvented the image of sports entertainment and made it a global brand there's just no way in hell I'd even be sitting here talking to you that we don't need I wouldn't I would be unknown he made all of us known and he created a Walt Disney empire with body slams and headlocks and the actors playing their role their own stuntmen and it's an amazing metamorphosis of how that's evolved and I don't believe that there's ever been a more brilliant entrepreneur the Vince McMahon any walk of life think about it smoke the old arenas the image that wrestling had all that rastan stuff's all fake oh my gosh rational all of a sudden he's in over 100 countries the 40 languages or something and it's a it's big time and I just think that what he's done without me kissing his behind I've done that too on television in the world that he was managing and pulling out of he had to be tough you know he's a brilliant man you
