Yulin, China Thousands of canines arrive in
the city for the controversial dog meat festival.
Only about 8% of people in China eat dog meat.
It’s believed to ward off heat in the summer
months.
The practice is facing criticism with the
rise of China’s pet ownership and animal
rights movement.
But Yulin residents argue that eating dog
meat is no different than eating pork or turkey.
Each year, activists travel to the festival
to rescue hundreds of dogs from slaughter.
Other dog eating festivals in China have been
banned in the past due to global outrage.
