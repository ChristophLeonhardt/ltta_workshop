>> IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE
ARE BEING ASKED TO TRUST THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHO WE
KNOW DID, IN FACT, USE A LAW
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SPY BUT
LIED TO GET THE WARRANTS.
LIED TO A FEDERAL JUDGE
UNDER THE FISA ACT.
MAKE NO BONES ABOUT IT, A
FISA WARRANT IS, IN FACT, A
LICENSE TO SPY.
NOW, THE QUESTION IS:  DID
YOU LIE, CHEAT, OR STEAL IN
ORDER TO DO THAT?
THEY DID MISLEAD THE JUDGE,
GET A WARRANT, MULTIPLE, YOU
KNOW, ABILITY TO SPY, AND
NOW WE'RE ASKED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU CAN TRUST THE VERY
PEOPLE WHO KNOW THIS AND ARE
COVERING IT UP.
STEVE: THERE YOU'VE GOT
DARRELL ISSA YESTERDAY ON
ONE OF THE SUNDAY SHOWS
TALKING ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE AND THE
REPUBLICAN'S INVESTIGATION
THEY WANT A WHOLE BUNCH OF
DOCUMENTS THEY ARE NOT
GETTING THEM.
THE DOJ SAYS THEY ARE
PROVIDING THEM.
LET'S BRING IN DAN BONGINO.
HE HAS A LOT OF SOURCES ON
THIS FORMER NEW YORK CITY
POLICE OFFICERS.
SECRET SERVICE GUY.
HOST OF THE DAN BONGINO
SHOW.
THANKS FOR JOINING US FROM
FLORIDA TODAY.
YOU KNOW, FORT END OF THE
WEEK WE STARTED TO HEAR
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
THAT THE REPUBLICANS GET ALL
THE DOCUMENTS REGARDING THIS
SECRET INTEL SOURCE.
THEY ALMOST REGARD THAT
INFORMATION AS IMPORTANT AS
THE WHOLE RUSSIA DOSSIER.
>> RIGHT.
AND THERE'S A REASON, STEVE.
LISTEN, I'VE SPENT NEARLY 20
YEARS OF MY LIFE AS A COP
AND FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR.
I HAVE NEVER, IN MY LIFE,
SEEN SUCH AN OBVIOUS FRAME
JOB AND SETUP.
THIS WAS A STING OPERATION
AGAINST THE TRUMP TEAM.
THAT IS WHY IT'S CRITICAL
THAT THEY HIDE THE SOURCE.
WHY IS IT CRITICAL THAT THEY
HIDE THE SOURCE, STEVE?
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD
THE ENTIRE TIME BY THE HACKS
IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA,
DEMOCRATS AND SOME
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS
THAT THE CASE AGAINST TRUMP
WAS JUST A SERIES OF
ACCIDENTAL CONTACTS WHERE
THEY RAN INTO THE TRUMP TEAM
AND THEY SAID STUFF.
BUT, STEVE, LET ME ASK YOU
THIS, WHAT IF THOSE CONTACTS
WERE DELIBERATE THAT THROWS
THIS WHOLE STORY OUT THE
WINDOW?
I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS,
SO HAVE MANY OTHER PEOPLE.
THESE WERE DELIBERATE
CONTACTS.
BRIAN: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
MEAN BY THAT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN DELIBERATE
CONTACT?
PEOPLE SET UP THERE TO SET
UP PEOPLE ON THE TRUMP TEAM,
SET UP THIS INTERACTION AND
MAKE IT LOOK TERRIBLE?
>> YES!
EXACTLY.
BRIAN, IT'S LIKE I WIND UP
ON A PARK BENCH WITH YOU AND
ASK YOU TO ROB A BANK WITH
ME AND HAVE YOU NEVER MET ME
BEFORE.
YOU ARE LIKE WHO IS THIS
GUY?
THERE IS ONLY TWO POSSIBLE
EXPLANATIONS.
EITHER YOU REALLY WANT ME TO
ROB A BANK WITH YOU OR I'M
TRYING TO ROB
TRYING TO FOB
TRYING TO FRAME YOU FOR
ROBBING THE BANK.
I WOULD SAY IT'S THE LATTER
WITH TRUMP.
>> THEY SAY THERE WAS A
SOURCE EMBEDDED IN THE TRUMP
TEAM THAT PROVIDED A LOT OF
INFORMATION TO GLENN SIMPSON
AND THE DOSSIER CREW, RIGHT?
>> BRIAN, SIMPSON'S ALREADY
ADMITTED IN SWORN TESTIMONY
IN THE SENATE THAT THE FBI
TOLD CHRISTOPHER STEELE THEY
HAD A SOURCE IN THE
CAMPAIGN.
NONE OF THIS IS NEW NEWS.
AND BY THE WAY THE LIST OF
SUBJECTS FOR THAT SOURCE OR
SUSPECTS IS VERY SHORT.
AND VERY DISTURBING.
STEVE: SOUNDS LIKE ACCORDING
TO WHAT WE HAVE READ, THE
SOURCE WAS NOT FEEDING
THINGS TO THE FUSION.
THE SOURCE WAS ACTUALLY
FEEDING IT DIRECTLY TO THE
FBI.
>> AND WHEN WE FIND OUT HOT
SOURCE IS, I THINK SOME
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS
ARE GOING IT BE A LITTLE
WORRIED, TOO U THIS WAS A
SWAMP OPERATION.
THIS WASN'T JUST DEMOCRATS.
AINSLEY: WE WANT TO SHOW YOU
THIS INTERVIEW.
IT WAS BERNIE SANDERS, HE
WAS ON WITH JAKE TAPPER.
JAKE WAS ASKING WHY DO YOU
SUPPORT -- WHY DID YOU
SUPPORT JOHN BRENNAN FOR CIA
DIRECTOR AND THEN YOU DON'T
WHEN HE WAS GINA HASPEL'S
BOSS.
BUT WHY DON'T YOU SUPPORT
GINA HASPEL WHEN THEY WERE
DOING THE SAME THING RIGHT
AFTER 9/11?
LISTEN TO THIS.
>> WHY IS BRENNAN OKAY BUT
GINA HASPEL IS NOT.
>> IF THE UNITED STATES
CONDONES TORTURE FOR OTHER
PEOPLE, THEN THAT SUBJECTS
OUR OWN MEN AND WOMEN WHO
WERE CAPTURED TO BE TORTURED
AS WELL.
I THINK BRENNAN DID A GOOD
JOB IN HIS POSITION.
I HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS
ABOUT THIS NOMINEE.
>> YOU DIDN'T HAVE
RESERVATIONS ABOUT JOHN
BRENNAN.
YOU VOTED FOR JOHN BRENNAN.
>> IT GOES DEEPER THAN THAT
AND THAT IS THE FOREIGN
POLICY THAT WE HAVE SEEN
FROM MR. TRUMP, SOMETHING
THAT I ALSO STRONGLY
DISAGREE WITH.
BRIAN: SO BECAUSE IT'S
DONALD TRUMP.
>> YEAH.
GUYS, IT DOESN'T GO --
BERNIE SAYS WELL, IT GOES
DEEPER THAN THAT IT DOESN'T
GO DEEPER THAN THAT.
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT'S
GOING ON FROM A GUY WHO HAS
RUN FOR OFFICE BEFORE.
THE DEMOCRATIC BASE HAS
BLOOD FROM ITS FANGS FOR
TRUMP.
THEY CAN'T STAND HIM.
THEY WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE
ON THERE WITH A D IN FRONT
OF THEIR NAME, ANYONE TO DO
ANYTHING PRO-TRUMP EVER.
EVEN IF IT VIOLATES
PRINCIPLES THEY HAVE HAD IN
THE PAST.
LOOK AT THE TAX CUT THING.
THE ARGUMENT THEY MADE ABOUT
THE TAX CUT THING NANCY
PELOSI JUST CRUMBS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I THOUGHT YOU HATED TAX CUTS
AND NOW YOU WANT THEM TO BE
BIGGER?
COMPLETE HYPOCRITES ON THIS
STUFF.
BRIAN: WE DON'T KNOW HOW
HASPEL IS GOING TO GO.
PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC.
SLEEPY JOE DONNELLY SAYS HE
WOULD DO IT.
JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WOULD DO
IT.
OBVIOUSLY JOHN MCCAIN ISN'T
GOING TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT
IT.
WE KNOW JEFF FLAKE IS
CONSIDERING NOT DOING IT.
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT RAND
PAUL IS GOING TO DO.
BUT THEY DO THINK THAT MORE
DEMOCRATS WILL END UP
PUTTING HER OVER THE TOP,
JUST BARELY.
>> WELL, AT LEAST RAND PAUL
IS PRINCIPLED ON IT.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING IT
JUST TO GET REELECTED.
YOU MAY SEE HEITCAMP AS
WELL.
YOU WILL SEE A COUPLE MORE.
THIS IS A TOUGH FIGHT FOR
THE DEMOCRATS TO GET
INVOLVED IN.
AFTER 9/11 WAS A FAR
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT.
AND JUDGING IT NOW BY THOSE
STANDARDS IS KIND OF
HYPOCRITICAL.
>> I THINK.
SO OBVIOUSLY THE ONLY REASON
THEY ARE DOING THAT BECAUSE
THEY ARE IN RED STATES AND
THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST
VOTES THEY HAVE TO SHOW THEY
WERE ACTUALLY WITH DONALD
TRUMP AS THEY RUN FOR
