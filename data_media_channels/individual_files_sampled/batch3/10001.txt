Donald Trump's given his first comments following the news his former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI the president once again said there had been no collusion between his camp and Moscow no collusion no collusion there's been absolutely there's been absolutely no collusion so we're very happy well Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about conversations that he had a year ago with Russia's then ambassador to the US the former advisors also agreed to fully cooperate with the so-called Russia investigation with more on that story here's Kelly Maupin we have Michael Flynn pleading guilty to charges of making false statements to federal agents at this point he's facing a sentence of between zero and six months in jail as well as a possible fine of up to $9,500 now of course the mainstream media is in an uproar others talk about the Russia investigation all kinds of things are being made in the press this is being treated as a very big story let's recall how Michael Flynn stepped down as national security adviser when he was serving in the Trump administration mr. Flynn misled vice president pence and now it appears that he's pled guilty to misleading federal agents now at this point you know the White House has come forward and said look this charge doesn't implicate anyone other than Michael Flynn the full statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than mr. Flynn we've had several indictments at this point individuals who misled federal officials made false statements and are now facing criminal charges but as of yet the collusion story isn't really materializing cool filings revealed that Flynn contacted the Russian ambassador asking to delay or defeat a vote on a UN resolution involving Israel they also allegedly disk the response to the sanctions imposed by the admirer bomber administration Michael phone also said that he consulted senior Trump transition officials over those contacts former Russian envoy said Gekas react though denied that he ever discussed sanctions with Flynn I was instructed not to discuss the sanctions and I assure you that I followed those instructions we also don't bargain over this issue because from the beginning we have considered it illegal and aggressive Flynn's conversations with kiss attention violate the centuries-old Logan Act now this prohibits Americans from negotiating with foreign governments over existing disputes with the United States but since the Act was passed not a single person has ever actually been successfully prosecuted under those rules political commentator Steve mounts Berg believes that Trump is unlikely to be badly damaged by this latest development he lied to the FBI why he chose to lie about these meetings with with the kiss lyac i don't know but he did and he pleaded guilty for it now they're saying always good to tell everything about Trump and Kushner what tell what none of this relates to collusion collusion this is all president-elect Trump asking or someone and his staff saying hey reach out to foreign countries by the way the great Andy McCarthy former federal prosecutor writes today it's commonplace for an incoming national security adviser to go to foreign countries and talk to his counterparts or reach them on the phone in anticipation of a new administration there's nothing here that's that's that gonna get Trump or or Cushing are in trouble
