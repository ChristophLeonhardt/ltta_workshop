THE RESTAURANT.
I DID NOT CREATE THAT.
>> AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "THE
BRIEFING" AND ARI FLEISCHER,
ALSO A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.
YOU HAVE BOTH BEEN IN SARAH
SANDERS' SHOES AND WORK FOR
ADMINISTRATIONS THAT AT TIMES
WERE UNDER PRESSURE FOR VARIOUS
THINGS.
SEAN, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS?
ANYTHING LIKE THIS?
>> I HAD A COUPLE UNPLEASANT
INTERACTIONS BUT NEVER ANYTHING
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE SEEING
NOW.
TRADITION OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES PEACEFULLY
AND CIVILLY, RESPECTFULLY.
EVEN AT TIMES, ON RESPECTFULLY,
MARCH TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT OF
VIOLENCE IS WHAT IS EXTREMELY
WHEN MAXINE WATERS SAID IT, YOU
SHOULD PUSH BACK ON THEM, CREATE
A CROWD AND YOU PUSH BACK ON
THEM, I THINK THAT'S VERY
TROUBLING.
THE IDEA OF SEEMINGLY USING
FORCE TO HURT SOMEBODY, YOU HAVE
SEEN PEOPLE GO AND NOW MAKE THIS
PERSONAL, GOING TO THEIR PLACES
OF BUSINESS, PLACES WHERE THEY
ARE EATING.
IT'S NOT JUST A THREAT TO THEM
BUT A THREAT TO THEIR FAMILIES
AND A THREAT TO THOSE AROUND
THEM.
MY THOUGHT, I MIGHT REMIND YOU
THAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO THAT AN
ACTIVIST ON THE LEFT TOOK THIS
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL AND WENT
INCLUDING STEVE SCALISE WAS
SHOT, ONLY BECAUSE OF HIS
POLITICAL BELIEFS.
WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE THAT
CREEP BACK INTO THE DIALOG AGAIN
IN A VERY SCARY AND TROUBLING
WAY AND IT'S GOT TO STOP.
>> I THINK THERE IS A CUT
LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT SOMEONE
COULD GET HURT IN ALL OF THIS.
IT'S NOT A GAME.
THIS WHOLE SCENARIO, IT IS
FRIGHTENING.
THIS IS ELYSE JORDAN TALKING
ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.
>> SHOULD SOMEONE WHO LIES
CONSTANTLY AND ENABLES THE
PRESIDENT'S LIES BE OPENLY
WELCOMED INTO SOCIETY, WHEREVER
THEY PLEASE?
SHOULD THEY FACE ANY KIND OF
SOCIAL OR SOCIETAL PRESSURE?
I AM INCREASINGLY WEIGHING
TOWARDS A "YES" ."
>> Martha: RE?
>> OH, MY GOD.
THERE'S ENOUGH IN THIS SOCIETY,
YOU DON'T ENGAGE IN THOSE TYPES
OF PRACTICES.
AND, MAXINE BASICALLY DENIED
THAT SHE CALLED ON PEOPLE TO
HARASS OTHERS.
NO PEACE, NO REST.
SO SHE IS STILL STICKING BY WHAT
SHE HAS DONE.
NOW SENATOR SCHUMER TO HIS
CREDIT, THE DEMOCRAT MINORITY
LEADER WENT DOWN TO THE FLOOR OF
THE SENATE AND REALLY CONDEMNED
HER.
NANCY PELOSI PUT A MILQUETOAST
ACCOMMODATION OF MAXINE WATERS.
BUT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WHERE SHE SERVES, DO YOU NEED TO
GET ASKED?
THE PRESS NEEDS TO HAVE A
FEEDING FRENZY AMONG THE LEFT AS
THEY ALWAYS DO ON THE RIGHT.
IT'S HER TURN NOW.
FRANKLY I'M AT THE POINT WHERE,
IF SHE CONTINUES TO DOUBLE DOWN
COME THE HOUSE WILL TAKE UP A
MOTION TO CENSOR HER.
BECAUSE THIS DOES LEAD TO
VIOLENCE AND IF YOU REMEMBER THE
FAMILY RESEARCH CENTER, THAT WAS
ALSO THE VICTIM OF A GUNSHOT
ATTACK ON AN ACTIVIST WHO DIDN'T
LIKE WITH THE FAMILY RESEARCH
CENTER STOOD FOR.
SEAN MADE THE POINT ABOUT
AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT CAMPAIGN
THIS LEADS TO THINGS I GO TOO
FAR AND YOU NEED TO STAND UP NOW
FOR CIVIL DISCOURSE AND IT'S UP
TO THE DEMOCRATS TO LEAVE THAT
STARS ALSO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN
WEIGH IN ON ALL THIS STUFF.
AND MUSICIANS.
LET'S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION AND REUNITE ALL
THOSE FAMILIES.
AND THEN YOU CAN GO OUT TO EAT
WHEREVER YOU WANT.
THE OTHER PART OF THIS, THIS
POLICY -- THIS IS WHAT BOTHERS
ME THE MOST.
WE NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION
ABOUT THE POLICY AND WHY IT'S
GOING ON.
GRANTED, THERE HAS BEEN A RAMP
UP HERE BECAUSE THERE IS A ZERO
TOLERANCE OF -- WHICH
ESSENTIALLY MEANT THAT THE LAWS
THAT WERE ON THE BOOKS AND THE
DECISION BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT
COURT MEANT THAT ALL OF THAT WAS
GOING TO BE ENACTED.
THAT SAYS IF YOU ARE APPREHENDED
IT, YOU WILL BE SEPARATED
BECAUSE THAT COURT DECIDED THAT
IT WAS NOT PROPER TO INCARCERATE
THE FAMILIES TOGETHER.
AND, THE PICTURES WERE EXACTLY
LIKE THEY WERE THEN.
SO THIS HAS BEEN LOST IN THE
HYSTERICAL BACK THEN.
>> TWO QUICK COMMENTS ON THAT.
NUMBER ONE, WHEN I FOUND
TROUBLING ABOUT THE SARAH
SANDERS INCIDENT WAS IN
JOHN ROBERTS' REPORT EARLIER IN
THE PROGRAM.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT
AFTER SARAH POLITELY DECIDED TO
GET UP, NOT MAKE A SCENE AND
LEAVE THE RESTAURANT, MANY
PEOPLE ACCORDING TO JOHN'S
REPORT GOT UP AND FOLLOWED HER
DOWN THE STREET, TRYING TO
HARASS HER FURTHER.
THIS HAS GONE WELL BEYOND
STATING AN OPINION OR FREE
SPEECH, IT'S NOW INTIMIDATION
AND THREATENING VIOLENCE WHICH I
THINK IS CROSSING A BIG LINE.
BUT TO YOUR POINT, WE HAVE A WAY
IN A DEMOCRACY TO NOT TAKE
PEOPLE.
THE REALITY IS, THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES IS ENFORCING
THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS.
IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE LAWS ON
THE BOOKS, EITHER OR BOTH OF
PEOPLE IN OR OUT THAT YOU LIKE
OR ENCOURAGE THOSE IN OFFICE TO
CHANGE THE LAW.
WE DON'T RESORT TO VIOLENCE AND
WE CERTAINLY DON'T
ENCOURAGEMENT.
AND LET ME SAY THIS, IT'S WRONG
IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN, WRONG IF
YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT AND WRONG IF
YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE.
WE COULD SPEND THE REST OF THE
NIGHT DEBATING WHO STARTED IT.
I'D RATHER ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION
OF HOW TO STOP IT AND HOW TO
MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE
CAN RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON
POLITICS AND WE CAN BE
RESPECTFUL OF OUR FELLOW MAN AND
WOMAN.
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE TWEETED
EARLIER TODAY.
THIS GOT QUITE A BIT OF
ATTENTION.
"WE CANNOT ALLOW ALL THESE
PEOPLE TO INVADE OUR COUNTRY.
WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN WE MUST
IMMEDIATELY COME UP WITH NO
JUDGES OR COURT CASES, BRING
THEM BACK FROM WHERE THEY CAME.
OUR SYSTEM IS MARGUERITE TO
IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND OF LAW
AND ORDER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, HE
GOT A LOT OF HEAT.
>> BORDER PATROL AGENT AND YOU
SEE SOMEONE COMING ACROSS THE
RIVER, CAN'T YOU JUST SEND THEM
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER?
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LET THEM LAND
AND GO THROUGH A WHOLE PORT
PROCESS?
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ARE A
NATION OF LAWS WHICH IS WHAT
MAKES US GREAT.
WHEN PEOPLE DO, AND THEY ARE AND
OUR COUNTRY, AND THEY'VE CROSS
THE BORDER UNDER OUR
CONSTITUTION, ALL PERSONS, NOT
CITIZENS BUT PERSONS ARE
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US GREAT.
IT IS SAID THAT LAWS ARE THE
RESTRAINTS THAT MAKE US FREE.
AND THAT'S TRUE.
BUT THEY ARE RESTRAINTS AND
THOSE RESTRAINTS COME WITH
BURDENS.
ONE OF THOSE BURDENS IS TO HAVE
A JUDICIAL PROCESS IN PLACE.
I HOPE IT'S FAST, QUICK AND FAIR
AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELONG HERE
SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
>> I WAS TALKING 3-5 YEARS
WAITING.
SO ONCE YOU GET ACROSS THE
BORDER YOU ARE 343 TO FIVE YEARS
UNTIL THE JUDGE KICKS IN.
>> YOU SHOULD BE THROWN OUT IF
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE, BUT I
WANT IMMIGRANTS TO COME TO THIS
COUNTRY AND I WANT PEOPLE TO
THINK AMERICA IS THE BEST
COUNTRY, THE FIRST COUNTRY THEY
WANT TO COME TO BUT, YOU HAVE TO
COME HERE ILLEGALLY.
YOUR FAMILY IS NEVER GOING TO BE
SEPARATED.
YOUR FAMILY WILL PROBABLY THRIVE
BEFORE THEM LIKE BECAUSE OF WHAT
AMERICA OFFERS.
BUT IF YOU DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL
TO GET HERE IT'S A OFF BAD
CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU AND
EVERYBODY IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO
HAS TO DEAL WITH WHAT YOU DID.
>> Martha: SEAN, WE ARE
WATCHING LEFT COLUMBIA AND WE
KNOW THAT AIR FORCE ONE HAD TO
CIRCLE BECAUSE OF THUNDERSTORMS
IN THE AREA.
THE PRESIDENT IS THERE TO
SUPPORT HENRY McMASTER, AND HE
HAS ANOTHER RALLY COMING UP
LATER THIS WEEK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
DECISION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
MADE IT TO GET BACK OUT ON THE
ROAD AND BACK OUT TO DOING THESE
RALLIES.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
>> IT TELLS ME THAT HE
UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO MAINTAIN A REPUBLICAN HOUSE
AND SENATE.
WORK WITH HIM.
THEY ARE ALREADY FOCUSED SO I
THINK THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS
UNDERSTAND THE BINARY CHOICES
THEY MAKE.
IT'S NANCY PELOSI AND
CHUCK SCHUMER WHO ARE GOING TO
RAISE OUR TAXES, SPEND MORE
MONEY AND I THINK CONTINUE TO
MAKE POOR DECISIONS ON POLICY.
>> Martha: GREAT TO HAVE YOU
GUYS WITH US, TO FORMER
