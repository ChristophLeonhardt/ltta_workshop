and contrast to the other wacky of

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,330
videos that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been uploading today</font>

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,440
I'm going to talk about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> books i've</font>

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,359
read recently and also one really cool

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,670
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got to do go to Harry</font>

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,500
Potter the exhibition I bought just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,120
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a postcard of the Hogwarts Express</font>

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,250
but it was absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a</font>

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,809
report about it for the leaky cauldron

10
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,460
you can find a link to that in the

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,470
description bar below as you know last

12
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,820
week I went to Miami<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I read</font>

13
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,800
basically a book a day which was really

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,359
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very much helped me</font>

15
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,680
getting ahead and work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this term no</font>

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,750
wraps today unfortunately first one was

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,610
dog eat is in your pants<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Jessica</font>

18
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,780
Hagedorn there's book a certain

19
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,130
Philippines has multiple narratives

20
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,510
makes it little hard to follow it

21
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,010
sometimes but you've got a ton of

22
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,739
references to films my old Hollywood it

23
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">really does fill out this huge mythology</font>

24
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,980
that everyone just refers to all the

25
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,480
time it's really great in that respect

26
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,520
it's a presentation of the dictatorship

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,350
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation of the politics a</font>

28
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,329
presentation of the issues of class

29
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,800
mobility the use of multiple narratives

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,690
shows the way in which those histories

31
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,789
are things just all told by people not

32
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,559
one of them is concrete and that you

33
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,210
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust anyone in the story</font>

34
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,739
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly good read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

35
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I've read anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sentence</font>

36
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,470
Philippines before a special not men<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

37
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,119
so that was really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

38
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,770
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it got me particularly</font>

39
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,270
excited if you do like multiple

40
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,460
narratives a multiple narrative story

41
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,049
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like two rather a lot better was</font>

42
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,610
a short history of women in your pants

<font color="#CCCCCC">by Kate wall but this book came out in</font>

44
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,770
2009 multi-generational focusing on the

45
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,150
stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> of women in one particular</font>

46
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,189
family starting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story of a</font>

suffragist the<font color="#CCCCCC"> suffragist name is</font>

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,330
Dorothy or as I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to refer to her</font>

49
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,310
Dorothy the first and as my professor

50
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">games refer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uba Dorothy because</font>

51
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,360
there are lots of Dorothy's in the story

52
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,009
but thankfully there's a family tree

53
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,869
which makes everything so much easier i

54
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,759
wish all multi-generational narratives

55
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,740
had a family training because it really

56
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">does help i enjoyed the stories of kind</font>

57
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,549
of the older<font color="#CCCCCC"> women in the family a lot</font>

58
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,020
more found it slightly difficult to

59
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,670
stomach the chapters about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

60
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,040
younger daughters the unprofessional<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

61
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,659
did appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the depiction of like the</font>

62
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,520
different concerns of women as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

63
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,770
discussion of protests and information

64
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">and technology and how that will work</font>

65
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,250
together that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly</font>

66
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,079
interesting it was quite funny not too

67

long<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy-to-read set in the UK the USA</font>

patagonia and i think that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

69
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,360
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even though that I don't know</font>

70

<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

71
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,330
like the last kind of couple of strands

72
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,550
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the family tree all that much another</font>

73
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,020
book I read was<font color="#E5E5E5"> crow tell or the</font>

president's daughter in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pants by</font>

75
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,440
William wells Brown some people consider

76
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
this to be the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> African American</font>

77
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Novel there's slave narrative but it's</font>

78
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,570
kind of weird because it's also very

79
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,790
political and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time when I was</font>

80
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,230
reading it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt like William wells</font>

81
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,790
Brown was kind of just writing this big

82
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,670
manifesto wish to what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know normal</font>

83
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">so kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like that but at the same</font>

84
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,490
time it wasn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the story of clay</font>

85
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,010
tell as much as the story of William

86
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,390
wells Brown trying to get his point

87
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,070
across other than by putting his

88
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,750
narrative his own personal narrative

89
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,520
which he does include at the beginning

90
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,050
of the novel as well it's obviously very

91
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,760
important book I would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> preferred</font>

92
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">her here a lot more about hotel herself</font>

93
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,690
and at time some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ways in which he</font>

94
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,280
focus on the owners of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> slaves</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

95
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,200
to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit tangential and distracting</font>

96
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,730
but at other times he did it really well

97
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,290
and asked all the right questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

98
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,940
the slavery<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so I'd like I think it</font>

99
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,470
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good region it's an important read</font>

100
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,140
but I didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I liked it that</font>

101
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,240
much I also find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the image of the tragic</font>

102
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,900
mulatto like this beautiful mixed-race

103
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,640
almost white women extremely troubling

104
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,770
is really worrying that this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

105
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,580
story had to be presented through the

106
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">frame of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful woman says a lot</font>

107
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,300
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad things about us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think at</font>

108
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,150
present I'm 255 pages into ghost written

109
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,190
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pants by David Mitchell it's</font>

110
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,140
kind of sci-fi multi narrative again

111
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,000
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go all around the world really</font>

112
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">liking this so hopefully I'll finish it</font>

113
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,970
by the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the week and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have another</font>

114
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,830
review of this up for you lastly when I

115
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,810
was in Miami I found this independent

116
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,340
bookshop called books and books which I

117
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,110
think has two other locations in Florida

118
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a couple of other locations in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
