1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,400
MULTIPLE STUDIES HAD
INDICATED THAT AUTO LOAN

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,550
COMPANIES WERE MARKING UP LOAN
PRICES FOR MINORITIES AND AS A

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,390
RESULT, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL
PROTECTION BUREAU UNDER THE

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,930
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN 2013

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,960
PAST GUIDANCE INDICATING IF
ANYONE IS CAUGHT DOING THAT

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,480
THEY WILL BE SUED AND THEY WILL
HAVE TO PAY GIANT FINES.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,539
NOW UNDER THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION AND BECAUSE OF A

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,580
CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION, THAT
DIRECTIVE WILL BE REPEALED.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:44,930
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,440
THIS DOESN'T ONLY HAVE TO DO
WITH RACE.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,430
IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH GENDER SO
WOMEN WERE ALSO FOUND TO

12
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,570
GET CHARGED HIGHER INTEREST
RATES FOR INSTANCE WHEN IT

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:09,790
CAME TO THESE AUTO LOANS OR
HIGHER MARKUPS.

14
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,299
EVER SINCE THIS HAPPENED IN
2013,

15
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,759
THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS LIKE WE
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

16
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:17,319
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS WE HAVE TO BE VERY

17
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,270
AGGRESSIVE AND THEY WERE AND
THEY GOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,270
WANTED.

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,119
THE CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION WAS
A BIPARTISAN EFFORT.

20
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,450
DEMOCRATS WERE INVOLVED AS WELL
AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE

21
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:34,539
NAMES OF THOSE DEMOCRATS IN 
A

22
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,899
MOMENT.

23
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:38,770
THIS INFORMAL GUIDANCE WAS
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THOUGH

24
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,720
BECAUSE IT ALLOWED THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TO GO AFTER THE

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
LENDERS THAT WERE CALLED TO
BRING THESE PREDATORY PRACTICES

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,229
SO FOR INSTANCE, ALLY FINANCIAL,
HONDA AND TOYOTA FACED LAWSUITS

27
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,630
AND HAD TO PAY $100

28
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,659
MILLION IN FINES FOR DOING THESE
DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES.

29
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,170
ALLY FINANCIAL PAID 100
MILLION IN 2013

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,149
AND HONDA AND TOYOTA 10'S OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

31
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,570
THAT IS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY,
TO BE FAIR TO THE REPUBLICANS,

32
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,229
IT IS PAINTED IN THE PRESS AS
SOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED BECAUSE

33
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,960
THEY ARE TAKING WAY AND IN
INFORMAL POLICY BUT THAT

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,170
INFORMAL POLICY WAS USED TO LEVY
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

35
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,060
IN FINES SO IT IS AN IMPORTANT
PIECE OF POLICY AND THE

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,250
FACT THAT IT IS INFORMAL I DON'T
THINK REALLY HAD AN EFFECT.

37
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,240
THEY WANT UP USING IT ALL THE
TIME SO I DON'T THINK THAT

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
IS THE HEART OF THE ISSUE.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,620
THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS THERE
A STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWING

40
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,360
THEY DO DISCRIMINATE AND THAT IS
PART OF WHY THEY DEALER MARKUPS

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,940
BECAUSE THEY GET TO CHARGE
SOME PEOPLE EVEN MORE THAN

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,150
OTHERS, SO THIS IS TAKING AWAY
MONEY FROM THEM AND WHEN THEY

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,130
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE,
THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY A FINE.

44
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,370
THEY DO NOT WANT TO GET CAUGHT.

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,260
THE REPUBLICANS COME INTO THE
RESCUE GOING THESE POOR CAR

46
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,940
DEALERSHIPS, BEING ABUSED BY THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE DEMANDING

47
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,270
EQUALITY.

48
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,030
WE WILL NOT LET THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH IT ANYMORE.

49
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,950
YOU GO BACK TO A TIME OF
INEQUALITY AND LETTING THE

50
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,880
CAR DEALERSHIPS DO BASICALLY
WHATEVER THEY WON THE

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,620
STEELER MARKET MARKET*YOU GUYS
HAVE A?

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,750
IF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN,
LET'S SAY YOU DIDN'T SEVER

53
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,160
DISCRIMINATION, YOU ARE BLACK OR
WOMAN, BUT THE REPUBLICANS

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,430
NOW SAY TRUST THE CAR
DEALERSHIPS, LET THEM TO

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,140
THE DEALER MARKUP, THEY PROBABLY
HAVE YOUR BEST INTEREST IN MIND.

56
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,170
REALLY?

57
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,060
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A RED HAT ON,
YOU REALLY THAT STUPID?

58
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,070
DON'T WORRY, THEY WILL SELF
REGULATE.

59
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,680
THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL
PROTECTION BUREAU IS

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,400
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO PROTECT
THE CONSUMER.

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,610
THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT AND
CONGRESS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

62
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,810
THERE TO REPRESENT YOUR BEST
INTEREST AS AN AMERICAN AND

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,420
AS A CONSUMER BUT THAT IS NOT
WHAT THEY ARE DOING HERE.

64
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,740
THEY ARE DOING THE EXACT
OPPOSITE.

65
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,370
IT IS OBVIOUSLY NO SURPRISE THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO REPRESENT

66
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,790
CORPORATE INTERESTS WHEN YOU
HAVE MONEY IN POLITICS AS

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,150
OPPOSED TO THE INTERESTS OF THE
PEOPLE BUT THIS IS, IT'S SO

68
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,069
BRAZEN.

69
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,160
NO, WE WANT TO GIVE THESE AUTO
LOAN COMPANIES THE ABILITY

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,280
TO MARKET INTEREST RATES FOR
PEOPLE BASED ON GENDER OR

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
RACE, WHY NOT?

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,300
WHY WOULD WE WANT THAT?

73
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,810
AGAIN, DEMOCRATS WERE INVOLVED
IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN SO THE

74
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,540
SENATE VOTED ON THIS AND JOE
MANSION WAS THE ONLY

75
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,488
DEMOCRATS SENATOR THAT VOTED
IN FAVOR OF REVEALING

76
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,889
REPEALING THIS DIRECTIVE AND
WHEN IT CAME TO THE HOUSE

77
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:31,380
THERE WERE 11 DEMOCRATS.

78
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,170
LET'S PUT THE GRAPHIC UP.

79
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,170
JIM COOPER.

80
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,610
LOU CORREA, JIM
COSTA, 11 DEMOCRATS.

81
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,900
THESE ARE ALMOST ALL BLUE DOG
DEMOCRATS, CONSERVATIVE

82
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,180
BLUE DOG DEMOCRATS AND SOME OF
THEM HAVE PROGRESSIVES THAT

83
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,270
ARE PRIMARY THEM.

84
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,820
GO TO JUSTICE DEMOCRATS.COM
AND FIND OUT WHO THEIR

85
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,410
OPPONENTS ARE IN MAKE SURE YOU
VOTE FOR THEM.

86
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,240
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TELLS ME
THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT OVER

87
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,030
PEOPLE LIKE STEPHANIE MURPHY.

88
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,410
NO, BECAUSE HER BOAT IS
IMPORTANT.

89
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,490
I KNOW, HER VOTE IS IMPORTANT
WHEN SHE HELPS REPUBLICANS

90
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,990
REBUFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND
NOT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT US AND

91
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,540
PROTECTING THE CITIZENS, SO I
KNOW WHICH WAY STEPHANIE MURRAY

92
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,052
VOTES AND JOE MANCHIN, REMEMBER
HOW HE PRETENDED TO BE

93
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:14,570
PROGRESSIVE AND VOTED AGAINST
TRUMP A LOT SO THE PRIMARIES ARE

94
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,250
OVER AND SO IS JOE MANCHIN
PRETENDING TO BE OF REGRESSIVE.

95
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,480
NOW HE IS VOTING WITH TRUMP IN
ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE.

96
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,560
ALSO, MICK MULVANEY WHO IS
THE HEAD OF THE CONSUMER

97
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,290
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU IS
HAPPY ABOUT THIS AND IS

98
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,590
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REPEAL OF
OTHER DIRECTIVES THAT WERE DONE

99
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,540
UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
TO PROTECT YOU, THE CONSUMER.

100
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,110
WE CAN ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.

101
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,220
BY THE WAY, COMPANIES DON'T PAY

102
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,760
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN FINES IF THEY DIDN'T DO IT.

103
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,910
THEY HAVE A LOT OF LAWYERS
AND THEY FOUGHT AND FOUGHT

104
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,030
AND THEN FINALLY REALIZED,
WE ARE TOTALLY CAUGHT,

105
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,290
TOTALLY GUILTY, WE WILL GET BACK
SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WE

106
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,419
RIPPED OFF FROM YOU BUT DON'T
WORRY, NOT ANYMORE.

107
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,380
THEY WON'T HAVE TO GIVE ANY
OF IT BACK, THEY CAN JUST KEEP

108
00:05:59,380 --> 00:00:00,000
RIPPING YOU OFF BECAUSE
REPUBLICANS ARE IN CHARGE.
