with these people over here we started a
tourism program about eight years ago
where we host two risks over here in
caliber three we explained them what it
means to be living in Israel what the
IDF is all about what the values of the
IDF are about and show them the real
life in Israel meaning life in Israel
can be beautiful this country the
beautiful country but we're living with
terror and we're living in a combat
region and you have to know how to live
in us in such a region
