every day when I scan the news channels I hear Rachel Maddow Chris Matthews Joe and Mika joy reads droning on and on about stormy Daniels they have clung so tightly to it and they won't let go in my opinion a great deal of the reticence to let the story go has to do with the Sun Claus fallacy they've already invested so much time and production dollars into this story I think all along they had this fantasy that this would be the story of the century that this would be bigger than Bill Clinton Slick Willy and Monica Lewinsky back in the 90s but someone didn't do a proper comparison analysis because it doesn't appear that they accounted for the fact that the Clinton sex scandal differs just a little bit and by a little bit I mean a lot from the Trump sex scandal firstly when Trump was elected his big ballin playboy ways weren't really a secret that's obviously not why we voted for him we voted for him because of his love of America and not because his love of beautiful women we voted for him because of his commitment to strengthen America not his commitment to strengthen his own marriage the man has had multiple marriages we all know that we knew that going into the election and as undesirable as though that playboy past life is it's not integral in his presidency moving forward and making America great again also as I've said before Trump wasn't president when this happened and it didn't happen in the Oval Office and he didn't lie about it under oath and it was consensual and because of all of these things Trump's approval rating has barely changed prior to the stormy Daniels story Trump's approval rating tracked by Harvard cap Harris poll has shifted wait for it one whole point yeah so the hundreds of hours and coverage of coverage on mainstream media and millions of dollars spent procuring interviews with lawyers legal experts and storming herself etc and money utilized as general production cost so after all of that just one stinking point his approval rating prior to the story breaking was 45% considering everything he's been up against all the enemy fire he's taken on a daily basis 45% is pretty dang good but his approval rating took a hit to the tune of one point down to 44% but that's still up three points since December up so he's still got a net gain of two points it's almost like it helped him actually it did help him you think I'm kidding but I'm actually not although the stormy Daniels story negatively affected Trump's rating among women it actually improved his rating with men yep apparently we highly evolved women we're living among a bunch of cavemen guys seriously you like him more now that you think he hooked up with a woman built like a pagan fertility doll are you a bunch of Charlie freaking machines so breaking down the numbers Trump's approval among women dropped 6 points in the last month no surprise among men it spiked 3 points from 50% to 53% no I'm not saying I don't still support the president obviously I do but this whole porn star thing are you are you all a bunch of Neanderthals it's not like you're growing affection and the spike of 3 points in your approval of him is attached to policy the tax cuts happened last year so you can't claim that it's because of that and Congress hasn't really accomplished anything of note this year so I can only conclude that you are fond of the storm look after all of this media coverage and these allegations that may or may not be true there lies one glaring fact Bill Clinton paid Paula Jones and $850,000 settlement Trump allegedly paid stormy Daniels 130 thousand dollars if anything this just proves once again who the best negotiator is and when we're talking trade deals military action or anything else frankly I'd rather have Trump at the helm fighting for us thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us over here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com the App Store download and have access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
