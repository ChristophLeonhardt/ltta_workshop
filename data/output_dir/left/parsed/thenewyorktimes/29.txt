How does a group of
longhorn crazy ants
come together to
solve a problem?
These ants are known to be
very good at cooperating
to bring a big chunk of
food, like a cricket,
back to the nest.
To find out,
researchers at the
University of Colorado, Boulder,
tested the ants.
First, they gave
them a bit of tuna.
Then they blocked their
way to the nest with Legos.
The ants appear to
move almost at random,
but the researchers
found that they actually
used two strategies.
The first strategy is simple:
Move along a barrier until it
ends, then head for the nest.
But in a cul-de-sac,
when enough time
passed without success, the
ants switched to strategy two.
They started to carry the
tuna away from the nest.
Somehow, the ants
communicate a direction
and reach a consensus.
The ants also seem to realize
when theyâ€™re in a trap.
When the researchers
blocked all exits,
the ants pretty quickly stopped
their efforts and gave up.
