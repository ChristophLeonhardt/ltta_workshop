00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,334
BALLISTIC MISSILES, THE JAPANESE

HAPPEN IN SINGAPORE IN JUNE?

32
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:11,985
>> IT IS A GOOD SIGN BECAUSE

33
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:12,953
THESE THREE WERE IN GOOD HEALTH,

34
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:21,194
ABLE TO WALK ON THE PLANE BY

35
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:21,928
THEMSELVES, THIS IS IN CONTRAST

36
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:22,562

00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:23,930
EXTREMELY POOR CONDITION,

39
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,664
VEGETATIVE STATE, DIED SHORTLY

40
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:25,398
AFTER RETURNING TO THE US, THE

41
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:26,099
NORTH KOREANS DIDN'T LIKE US.

42
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:28,935
NOW THE NORTH KOREANS WANT TO

43
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:29,636
CREATE GOODWILL SO THEY KEPT

44
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:34,608
THESE GUYS IN GOOD CONDITION.

45
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,943

46
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:39,946
WHAT KIM JONG UN IS WILLING TO

47
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:40,280
GIVE UP?

48
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,352
>> THE ONLY THING WE ARE WILLING

49
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:45,952
TO ACCEPT HIS COMPLETE

50
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:46,686
DISARMAMENT OF NORTH KOREA AND

51
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:47,187
THAT IS CRITICAL.

52
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:51,458
OUR ALLIES DEPENDS ON IT, AND IT

53
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:56,096
DEPENDS ON DISARMING NORTH

54
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:56,963
KOREA.

55
00:01:56,963 --> 00:02:02,169
THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHAT

56
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:02,569
KIM ONE TOS.

57
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,371
SHORT OF USE OF FORCE TO DISARM

58
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:09,042
THE NORTH KOREANS, WHETHER THEY

59
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:19,753
WERE WILLING TO DO THOSE THINGS.

60
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,254
AND HE THINKS KIM JONG UN WANTS

61
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:28,428
TO ENTER THE REAL WORLD.

62
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:36,937
>> HE WANTED TO ENTER THE REAL

63
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:42,209
WORLD WITH HIS NUKES.

64
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:42,943
WE CAN TIGHTEN THE SANCTIONS ON

65
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:43,643
NORTH KOREA, WE CAN GO AFTER

66
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:44,311
THEIR MAJOR POWER BACKERS,

67
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:44,945
RUSSIA AND CHINA WHO ARE

68
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,580

69
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,047

YOU GO BACK TWO MONTH, CHINA HAS

71
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,719
MARKEDLY DETERIORATED.

72
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,421
THESE ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO.

73
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:58,391
THAT DOESN'T MATTER IF NORTH

74
00:02:58,391 --> 00:02:59,125
KOREA GIVES UP ITS NUKES BUT IF

75
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:03,964
IT DOESN'T WE HAVE TO PUSH THE

76
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:04,931
CHINESE AROUND.

77
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,200

TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT.

82
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:19,279

00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,013
CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CHINESE

84
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:30,690
POLICE REPORTS ARE OBVIOUS

85
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,358

NORTH KOREA, AND THIS IS JUST

92
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:48,508
LIKE THE JAPANESE TAKEN BY NORTH

93
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:49,242
KOREA FOR LANGUAGE OBSTRUCTION.

94
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:50,810
>> DOES THIS GUM UP THE WORKS ON

00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:53,680
>> IT IS SOMETHING WE CAN

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,014
