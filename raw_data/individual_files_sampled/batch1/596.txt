to cope with driving in Kabul you need nerves of steel and a strong heart the Afghan capital has some of the most challenging driving conditions anywhere more than half a million vehicles compete for space on narrow roads it's difficult for the experienced driver but downright daunting for a learner and even more so if you're a woman it's not easy because even though women are allowed to drive by law many men say culturally it is wrong what does that mean there are a lot of men who verbally abused you they block your car motorcyclists ride alongside shouting bad things no one helps us and the mummer's i driving school instructors teach them about road signs and engines and prepare them psychologically for the abuse they will face the women sometimes say they don't want to drive again because of the abuse but I tell them you need to fight these people not give in just ignore them there's nothing you can do 3,500 learners have passed their test through the school 40% of them women to persevere they have to be competent and also mentally tough I'm following my biram I want to take my car out to get my groceries if I need to get to hospital or go to work I go to work to earn money and put it in my pocket I like my derive when the Taliban were in control women were forbidden to drive but outside of the main cities it is rare even now to see a woman behind the wheel in the last 15 years cobbles traffic department has issued more than 700,000 driving licenses to men but only 3,000 and 14 for women there has been real progress in women's rights mainly here in the capital but that hasn't gone as far as the car in this conservative society many men here see it as a male-only domain the women are just driving for a front and not facilitating people they are creating problems for us they should drive in a specific time when we are not working some women find it all too much and give up driving but others like Angela typify the resolve of the modern Afghan woman we don't care about their abuse and we will carry on driving because God has ordered in the Koran that there is no difference between men and women we are more educated and can stand on our own feet society is changing albeit slowly but for the women drivers of Afghanistan there is a long road ahead before they are fully accepted Toni Berkeley al Jazeera Kabul
