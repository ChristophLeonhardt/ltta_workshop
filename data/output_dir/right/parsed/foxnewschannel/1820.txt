>> A FOX NEWS ALERT IN PARIS
NECKER ONE PERSON IS DEAD AND
FOUR OTHERS WANTED MORE POLICE
SAY HE WAS A KNIFE ATTACK AND
HEART OF THE CITY.
STARTED STABBING PEOPLE IN THE
STREET AND TRY TO ATTACK ONE
PERSON.
ALL OCCURRING ON THE STREET.
IT WAS A BUSY DISTRICT NEAR THE
PARIS OPERA HOUSE.
ALMOST JAMMED WITH TOURISTS AND
VISITORS ALIKE.
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT YET
PACIFIED THIS AS A TERRORIST
ATTACK.
IT DOES APPEAR TO HAVE THE
HALLMARKS OF ONE BUT AS OF THIS
HOUR THE MOTIVE FOR THE ATTACK
WE ARE TOLD IS UNKNOWN.
LET'S BRING IN STEVE ROGERS.
FORMER MEMBER OF THE FBI JOINT
TERRORISM TASK FORCE IN OUR
COUNTRY.
IF A TOURIST AREA, SATURDAY
NIGHT, NEAR THE OPERA HOUSE.
MULTIPLE STABBINGS, RANDOMLY,
WHAT DOES YOUR GUT SAY?
>> MY DAD SAYS THIS IS A STRONG
POSSIBILITY IS A TERRORIST
ATTACK.
BECAUSE OF THE UPPER END DATE
OF THE SUSPECT.
KEEP IN MIND WHEN POLICE GOT TO
SEE MY DESK THEY WANT TO
CAPTURE OF THE SUSPECT, THE ONE
HIM ALIVE.
THEY DO THE BEST THEY COULD TO
MAKE THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS
IS THE GREATEST SOURCE OF
INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION.
NONE OF THE SUSPECT IS DEAD,
THERE'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE
WORKED ON VIDEO FOOTAGE.
IT WILL IDENTIFY WHO THE
SUSPECT IS.
THEY'RE HEADING TO THE
INDIVIDUALS HOUSE THEY WILL
THEY CAN FROM THE COMPUTER AND
ELECTRONICS.
AND THE ANTITERRORISM TASK
FORCES ON THE GROUND AS WE
SPEAK.
>> LEASING A RASH OF THESE
RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST
ATTACKS.
THE TRUCK MOWING DOWN PEOPLE, A
CONCERT SHOOTING AND ATTACKS
WITH BASICALLY MACHINE GUNS ON
THE STREETS OF PARIS.
PEOPLE ENJOYING THE CITY AND
THE CAFCS.
THIS IS A SIMILAR SITUATION
GIVEN THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THE
MOTIVE.
AS YOU SAY, IT MEANS THAT WAY.
ARE WE SEEING MORE OF THESE
ATTACKS?
THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR, TWO
WOMEN WERE STABBED TO DEATH, 17
AND 20 YEARS OLD.
THAT WAS A RADICAL ISLAMIC
TERRORIST ATTACK.
I MEAN IT SEEMS THAT ISIS IS
CALLING ON HIS BELIEVERS AND
FOLLOWERS TO DO WHATEVER THEY
CAN.
THERE IS A KNIFE OR A CAR OR A
TRUCK, WHATEVER THEY CAN DO TO
ATTACK THE CIVILIZED WORLD.
>> YOUR ATTACK IS RIGHT.
WE HAD GREAT STRIDES IN
DECAPITATING ISIS IN THE MID
EAST THROUGH THE PRESENCE VERY
AGGRESSIVE MILITARY CAMPAIGN.
THEY'RE TAKING THE BOW TO OUR
STREETS.
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
AND IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE
THE LOW-TECH DEVICES.
VANS, CARS, KNIVES.
ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR IS THAT
THEY ARE TAKING PLACE WHEN
THERE IS A HIGH VOLUME OF
PEOPLE.
TO CAUSE THE MOST TERROR HE
POSSIBLY COULD.
AND SO WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO
SEE MORE OF THIS DOWN THE ROAD.
WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE AN
INCREASE IN COOPERATION AND
SHARING OF INTELLIGENCE AND
INFORMATION.
BACK THERE SO MANY OF THESE.
HOW MANY CAN AUTHORITIES KEEP
TRACK OF SUSPECTS?
IN ISRAEL THEY HAD A PRETTY
GOOD HANDLE ON IT.
THEY HAVE NICE THINGS AND CARS
BEING DRIVEN FOR SIDEWALKS
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A LOT
OF ASSAULT WEAPONS IN ISRAEL
FOR EXAMPLE.
AND AS YOU SAY, A KNIFE JUST GO
TO THE KITCHEN OR IF YOU'RE A
FOLLOWER IN AND FOLLOW UP AND
ATTACK.
>> I MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES IF
YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY
SOMETHING.
AND IF I HAD ADDED IF PEOPLE
SEE SOMETHING A SENSE SOMETHING
I MIGHT LET THE POLICE KNOW.
HOW DO YOU PREVENT SOMEBODY
GOING ON THE STREETS WITH A
KNIFE AND A VAN KILLING PEOPLE?
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE!
BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT EVERY
SINGLE INCIDENT, THERE WAS
ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO CAME FORWARD
AND SAID I SAW SOMETHING ON
SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THIS PERSON
PUT.
THEY SAID SOMETHING TO SOMEONE.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COMBAT
THIS TERRORISM WORLDWIDE FROM
THE NEIGHBORHOODS.
>> BUT YOU KNOW, IT OFTEN DOES
NOT HAPPEN.
FAMILIES SAY WE DID NOT KNOW.
THEY WERE MAKING BOMBS IN THE
BASEMENT!
THE PACKAGES WERE GUNS.
WE DID NOT KNOW!
WE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS
RADICALIZED.
FRIENDS ALL KNOW, THE FAMILY,
THEY ALL KNOW.
THEY SEE THE GUY ON THE
COMPUTER.
THEY ARE TALKING FOR A YEAR
ABOUT RADICAL JIHAD.
EVERYONE SAYS I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
DO THAT.
PEOPLE WILL SEQUENCE COMMITTEE
AND I DO NOT KNOW JOEY WAS
GOING TO DO THIS.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT
THEY DO KNOW BUT WE HAVE TO
DEPEND ON PEOPLE WILL BE
VIGILANT AND TAKE ACTION.
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE COMBAT
THIS.>> STEVE ROGERS, THANK
YOU FOR THIS.
ONE PERSON ON THE STREET DEAD,
FOUR OTHERS INJURED SEVERELY BY
MAN THAT POLICE SAY WAS
RANDOMLY STABBING PEOPLE ON THE
STREET.
