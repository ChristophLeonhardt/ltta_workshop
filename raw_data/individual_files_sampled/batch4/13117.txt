that we are not going to allow the Democrats to filibuster the Kavanagh nominee and that means that by Saturday the full Senate will be voting on Brett Kavanaugh here was Mitch McConnell yesterday announcing that he was going to file cloture on the floor of the Senate there'll be plenty of time for members to review and be briefed on the supplemental material before a Friday cloture vote so I'm filing cloture on judge Kavanagh his nomination this evening so the process can move forward as I indicated earlier and the process should move forward the process should move forward because guess what shocker it turns out that nothing has been found and we've now been doing this for another week another week thanks to Senator Jeff Flake and the idea that an FBI investigation was going to quell everyone's fears clearly that's happened clearly Democrats are now very satisfied with how this is gone everybody has a lot of faith in the FBI folks on the left they really feel like a full investigation has been done and they're feeling pretty satisfied about all this take for example Senator Dianne Feinstein who took the results of the FBI inquiry and she saw that it basically said nothing new and then should you know what I feel like this has been settled I guess now I'll really consider Brett Cavanaugh's nomination or alternatively she did what everyone knew what she would do and she said oh no the investigation is a bunch of hooey and it was never meant to be comprehensive and therefore Democrats can't vote for Kavanagh on that basis here is Dianne fine signe who really has just been I mean there's no other word for it in terms of the process that she's engaged in than evil I mean it really has been an evil process in which she's engaged getting an allegation on July 30th holding it for six weeks until just before the vote releasing it without any corroborating detail maybe releasing it anonymously in order to spur the full release of the story and then grilling Brett Kavanaugh on suppose it gang rape now all of this has been gross but here's Senator Dianne Feinstein continuing her pattern of being gross by saying that the FBI investigation is incomplete and because it's incomplete therefore that's really why we shouldn't vote on Cavanaugh but what I can say is that the most notable part of this report is what's not in it as we noted by the White House the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh we have seen even more press reports of witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI but were not interviewed okay so I love that she says what's most important here is what's not in it that's true but not how she means it so she says what's most important is all the people the FBI didn't interview well that's because the people that she's talking about could provide no corroborating evidence what's not in the report is that there is no corroborating evidence for any of Christine Blasi Ford's allegations no corroborating evidence none the GOP Senate Judiciary chair astley he says there is no hint of misconduct in confidential FBI report on Cavanaugh sexual misconduct claims he says there's nothing in it that we didn't already know Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski at least Susan Collins from from Maine she is suggesting that the FBI process has made her feel a little more quiet about this whole thing maybe that's what Jeff Flake was going for if so what would the best possible spin on it may be when Senator flake called for the FBI investigation he was just trying to get Susan Collins on board or provide cover for a couple of Democrats like joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp to vote for Brett Kavanaugh also the polling data this week has been brutal for Democrats so that means the joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota that the two of them may in fact vote for Cavanaugh just to preserve their Senate seats it is very likely right now that the Democrats the their chances before the Cavanaugh thing were not good with regard to taking back the Senate eight about one in three shot according to five-thirty gates modeling of taking back the senate now that's down to about one in four and it looks like republicans may actually pick up seats in the senate even the advantage the democrats have in house races has been reduced by half as we talked about yesterday on the show so this Cavanaugh thing has backfired pretty badly on Democrats White House spokesman Raj Shah says the White House has received the Federal Bureau of Investigation's supplemental background investigation into Judge Cavanaugh it is being transmitted to the Senate with leader McConnell's cloture filing senators have been given ample time to review the seventh background investigation this is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history which includes extensive hearings multiple committee interviews over 1200 questions for the record and over half a million pages of documents with this additional information the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm judge Cavanaugh to the Supreme Court President Trump tweeted out this morning the harsh and unfair treatment of Judge Beck kavanah is having incredible upward impact on voters the people get it far better than the politicians most importantly this great live life cannot be ruined by mean and despicable Democrats and totally uncorroborated allegations he's 100% right on this even Bret Stephens is expressing gratitude that Trump is president today which is an amazing thing right Brett Stevens is about as anti Trump as it's possible to be he is a true never Trump Republican and he came out in the New York Times today and said I am very very pleased that Donald Trump is president and standing by Brett Kavanaugh now there are a lot of folks on the Left who don't seem to understand why folks on the right are so passionate about this issue the reason we're passionate about this issue is because it looks like due process and presumption of innocence have been tossed completely out now in a second I'm gonna get to the counter argument that's being made by some folks I think in good faith folks like Sam Harris on his podcast I'm friendly with Sam and we've been having a little bit of a text back and forth about this and I'm not spilling any secrets he said all this stuff publicly I want to talk about that in just a second but the way that Republicans are viewing this the way conservatives are viewing this the way independents are viewing this is a man was accused after 36 years of allegedly sexually assaulting a girl back when he was 17 years old there is no corroborating evidence and Democrats want to run him out of his life over it and then the media have decided to latch on to every single rumor they possibly can in order to prevent Cavanaugh from joining the court that's what this looks like to anyone I think of objective I don't even think it's conservatives anyone have objectified the process sucks now there are two separate questions and this is where I think it's worthwhile discussing the most intellectually honest version of the leftist case there are two separate questions does the process suck and does Brett Kavanaugh deserve to be on the court now these two issues are not completely separate the process and its suckage are one of the reasons why Brett Kavanaugh got himself into a little bit of trouble with regard to his testimony I'm gonna talk about the trouble he got himself into with regard to his testimony in just a second but the suckage of the process is what most people are concerned with at this point because it feels like whatever complaints are being made about Brett Kavanaugh are essentially fruit of the poisonous tree then when you accuse a guy of gang rape and you start going through his yearbook and then your final case against him is he fibbed about stuff in his high school yearbook and that's why he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court that feels like fruit of the poisonous tree in the worst possible way and in a second I'm gonna discuss that case also it feels like the media are out to get Cavanaugh because they are Ronan Farrow has done some really good work on the me to stuff like some some really excellent work on the me to stuff and he completely has undermined his own credibility with regard to Brett Kavanaugh so you recall that a week ago The New Yorker and a piece by Jane Meyer who is not a good reporter and Ronan Farrow who is a good reporter they put out a piece suggesting that a woman named Deborah Ramirez back when she was at Yale was at a drunken frat party and Brett Kavanaugh unzipped his pants and exposed himself to her that was the accusation it was at a party she apparently considered it for six days because she wasn't sure that she remembered it correctly or that it was Cavanaugh and then she came forward and told the story there were no corroborating witnesses well last night the New Yorker decides that in order to undermine the credibility of the FBI investigation they are going to come forward with new witnesses to Deborah ramirez's statements oh that would be kind of a bombshell wouldn't it except that's not actually what the report said on Wednesday evening New York who runs this investigative piece from Meier and Ronan Farrow the piece claimed that the FBI investigation into sexual assault claims against Cavanaugh was insufficient what made the investigation insufficient well here's what they said they said quote frustrated potential witnesses who have been unable to speak with the FBI agents conduct the investigation into sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have been resorting to sending statements unsolicited to the bureau and descenders in hopes that they would be seen before the inquiry concluded so the FBI investigation is just as Feinstein said insufficient because they're a bunch of witnesses who've not been interrogated by the FBI and they've been desperately reaching out to the FBI trying to tell their vital stories what are their vital stories well the key vital story comes from a guy named Kenneth appaled Kenneth appaled according to The New Yorker was a suite mate of Brett Kavanaugh at the time of the alleged incident he had previously spoken to The New Yorker about Ramirez and condition of anonymity but he said that he is now willing to be identified because he believes the FBI must thoroughly investigate her allegation appaled who is the James hasting Nichols professor of Reformation history at Princeton Theological Seminary said that he first heard about the alleged incident involving Cavanaugh and Ramirez either the night it occurred or a day or two later Apple said he was 100% certain that he was told that Cavanaugh was the male student who exposed himself to Ramirez well okay that's pretty damning stuff right I mean here's a guy who's saying that he heard about Cavanaugh exposing himself at this party so why isn't the FBI talking to him clearly the FBI investigation is a ruse clearly it hasn't been done more thoroughly enough and all the rest of it well there's only one problem buried a few paragraphs down there in the story is a little spoiler that completely undermines the New Yorkers story I will explain that spoiler to you in just one second but first let's talk about what you do in case of emergency so you see there are these natural disasters you see the the videos of them on on YouTube or on Twitter you you watch on TV as a tsunami or a hurricane hits and you think yourself okay I have my really prepared in my own home and the answer is you're probably not and that's why you need my Patriot supply when there's no power refrigeration fails and store closes stores closed so what do you do well that's when you need an emergency food plan I trust my Patriots apply for dependable food storage and you should as well people in the office have it we have actually my Patriots apply at the office in case an emergency hits while everybody is here at work so we don't resort to cannibalism I think it is fair to say that Austin goes first each person in your household should have at least a two-week emergency food supply from my Patriot supply this week they're offering a special price of only 75 bucks for a food kit that contains ninety two servings of breakfasts lunches and dinners call eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or go to my special website prepare with been calm this food lasts up to twenty five years in storage is only seventy five bucks that includes a rugged tote order now eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or prepare with been calm eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or prepare with been calm so go check it out right now so how did the New Yorker undermine its own case so they say here's a witness a witness who says he heard about Brett Kavanaugh exposing himself to a girl at Yale now again this is a different allegation than the he tried to sexually assault somebody this is a bad drunken frat antic that is gross but it's not quite the same thing as pressing yourself on a girl and putting your hand over her mouth or there are gradations of evil this one is a little bit lower than the other one but here's the big problem with a New Yorker story okay The New Yorker story says this this is actually what it says in the story quote a polled said that he initially asked remain anonymous because he hoped to make contact first with the classmate who to the best of his recollection told him about the party and was an eyewitness to the incident he said he had not been able to get any response from that person despite multiple attempts to do so The New Yorker reached the classmate but he said he had no memory of the incident so in other words here's what the New Yorker is reporting here's their big bombshell this guy heard secondhand about a party which Cavanaugh exposed himself without permission to a girl and this guy said I'm not coming forward until I talked to the guy who told me the story The New Yorker actually identified that guy who supposedly witnessed the event and then when they talked to him and that guy said I don't remember anything about that wouldn't that actually be the end of the story like in a normal journalistic standard wouldn't that be the end of the story if ice if I spoke to somebody and they said I heard a rumor from X that this happened and he was an eyewitness and then I went I spoke to the eyewitness and the eyewitness said I don't remember anything about that that would be the end of the story The New Yorker ran with it anyway because this is the length to which journalists will go to sink Bret Cavanaugh's nomination and then that report in The New Yorker gets even worse The New Yorker wrote that some of Cavanaugh's classmates said he was a bully in high school who laughed at other kids this is a quote from The New Yorker story in his statement which his attorney there's another witness in his State which his attorney also sent to several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday he described Kavanagh as part of a clique of high school athletes most of whom are on the football team who routinely picked on less physically fit or popular students he said he never witnessed Cavanaugh physically attacking another student but he recalled him doing nothing to stop the physical and verbal abuse instead he said Cavanaugh stood by and laughed at the victims so what so what is the implication that he shouldn't sit on the Supreme Court because he was a jackass in high school and I mean like in the classic sense like he was a jerk in high school who's part of the popular kids clique this is coming from a guy who was deeply unpopular in high school right I have no sympathy for guys who are bullies in high school or who stood by while bullying occurred in high school I have no sympathy for that because I was a brutal victim of bullying when I was in high school but being a victim of bullying does not mean that I think that anyone who was a bully in high school also raped chicks I don't think that's a thing hey there are a lot of guys in my high school who are the worst people imaginable in high school I don't think any of them participated I have no evidence that any of them participated in sexual assault on girls but that's the implication from The New Yorker story you wonder why the right is reacting with outrage to all of us that's why the right is reacting to outrage why else because the left is now desperately attempting to make a series of claims about Kavanagh that are unconnected to the original allegation and I'll get to that in just one second so first we begin with the response from dr. Christine Blasi Ford to the FBI investigation which came up with nothing new her attorneys who are Democratic activists they sent out a statement it said quote an FBI supplemental background investigation that did not include an interview of dr. Christine Blasi Ford nor the witnesses who corroborate her testimony cannot be called an investigation we are profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice she made in coming forward those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth a few things one she testified under oath at length there is no reason for the FBI to talk to her again if she contradicts her story she commits perjury there's no there's really no reason for them to talk to her second they talked to all of the witnesses the who gave sworn statements and those witnesses did not back her story when they say that the FBI didn't talk to the witnesses who corroborate her testimony there are no witnesses who corroborate her timoni none zero zip zilch none i wanted by the way I have to debunk a talking point that's being used routinely by folks on the left with regard to Blasi Ford there's this talking point on the left that women would never falsify would never miss remember would never lie about allegations of rape now I have tremendous sympathy for people who allege sexual assault I do I mean I'm when she first came forward I said this is a credible account and I want to wait for corroborating evidence before I make a decision on this there's no corroborating evidence forthcoming and that's why I'm saying that Brett Kavanaugh can't sit on the court I still don't know if she's telling the truth you don't know either nobody knows because there's no corroborating evidence and no witnesses with that said one of the things that's been put out there by folks on the left is that there's no incentive for women in high-profile cases to come forward I have two words for you I need a help hey Anita Hill has been a hero on the Left for the last 25 years HBO made a full series about her and if you think there's no incentive for women to come forward and shape the course of history I find that highly doubtful highly doubtful I mean here was Time Magazine's cover this week the Time magazine cover this week is of Christine Blasi Ford swearing with her eyes closed and her entire face is made up of words from her testimony does that look like somebody who has not benefited at all from the publicity I would say the Christine Blasi Ford is one of the most worshipped figures on the Left today
