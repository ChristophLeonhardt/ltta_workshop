fantastic YouTube channel called nothing

great its tech reviews but I also think
you represent a really underserved place
on YouTube which is like a female
perspective on technology iJustine does
a great job in that space but she kind
of stands alone yeah there's not a lot
of people doing that so I'm a big fan of
your channel thank you for being willing
