1
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:04,409
TOLD US, THE ROAD AHEAD COULD

2
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:07,178
BE LONG AND DIFFICULT.

3
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:07,712
MOLLY.

4
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:08,246
>> GREG, THANK YOU.

5
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:08,946
>> A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT

6
00:00:08,946 --> 00:00:13,184
WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL GO

7
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:14,252
FORWARD WITH DENUCLEARIZATION

8
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:15,453
AND WHAT THE DEFINITION OF

9
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:17,021
MUSIC KIM JONG-UN WHICH CAN BE

10
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:17,922
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE WORD

11
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:21,025
MEANS FOR THE PRESIDENT TRUMP

12
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:21,859
AND THE TRANSPORT MINISTRATION.

13
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:26,364
LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

14
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:27,231
ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THIS

15
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:28,166
STUNNING, UNBELIEVABLE

16
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:28,900
TURNAROUND BY KIM JONG-UN.

17
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,270
JUST RECENTLY, OF COURSE HE WAS

18
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,204
ACCUSING THE UNITED STATES OF

19
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:35,073
WANTING TO ATTACK HIS NATION.

20
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:35,907
SAYING THAT HE WOULD TURN

21
00:00:35,907 --> 00:00:38,009
SEOUL, KOREA INTO A SEA OF

22
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:38,309
FIRE.

23
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,113
MORE BLUSTER AND ARROGANCE FROM

24
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:42,547
HIM.

25
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:43,181
BUT SUDDENLY, YOU SEE THE

26
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:43,815
IMAGES OF HIM SMILING AND

27
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,116
WALKING CASUALLY WITH PRESIDENT

28
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:46,884
MOON.

29
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:54,025
JUST A ASTOUNDING TURNABOUT.

30
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:54,726
WE HAVE THE DIRECTIVE CAREER

31
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:55,359
WORKING GROUP AT HARVARD

32
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,427
KENNEDY SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT IN

33
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:56,794
CAMBRIDGE.

34
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:57,228
JOHN, WELCOME.

35
00:00:57,228 --> 00:00:59,397
DO YOU THINK THAT KIM IS

36
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:00,198
GENERALLY REALLY SINCERE?

37
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:06,370
OR IS THIS ANOTHER --

38
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,138
>> THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION BUT

39
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:08,506
I THINK GIVEN THE LEVEL OF

40
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:09,173
PREPARATION AND ALSO

41
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:10,541
INTERACTIONS WE LOOK AT

42
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,812
PREPARATIONS FOR THE SUMMIT

43
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:15,513
TAKING PLACE IN INTELLIGENCE

44
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:16,514
CHANNELS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

45
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:17,482
WE'VE NOT SEEN IN THE US AND

46
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:18,249
NORTH KOREA CONTEXT.

47
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:19,117
TO THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO

48
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:29,560
BE SAID ABOUT THEN DIRECT

49
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:30,695
TO THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO

50
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:30,962
BE SAID ABOUT THEN DIRECT R

51
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:31,763
MIKE POMPEO, THIS IS NOT THE

52
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:32,663
NORM AS HE IS IN THE PAST.

53
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:35,133
>> THERE IS CONCERN THAT BOTH

54
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:39,637
SIDES MAY BE MISREADING EACH

55
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:39,937
OTHER.

56
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:40,671
AND THE FORMER DIRECTOR WAS ON

57
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:41,272
CBS THIS MORNING.

58
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:42,039
LET'S SEE WHAT HE SAID.

59
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:47,078
>> BOTH UNITED STATES AND NORTH

60
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:47,945
KOREA ARE COMING TO THE TABLE

61
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:48,946
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS AND BOTH

62
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:56,654
SIDES ARE MISREADING THE OTHER

63
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:56,954
SIDE.

64
00:01:56,954 --> 00:01:58,055
WE THINK THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT

65
00:01:58,055 --> 00:01:58,856
NORTH KOREA TO THE TABLE BY

66
00:01:58,856 --> 00:01:59,757
PUTTING OUR ARMS AROUND THEIR

67
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:01,192
NECK AND SQUEEZING WITH

68
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:02,026
SANCTIONS.

69
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:02,827
NORTH KOREA IS COMING TO THE

70
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:03,561
TABLE BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY

71
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:04,295
ARE NOW A NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATE

72
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,196
AND THEIR DRAG NESTED TABLE

73
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:06,264
BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF THEM

74
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:08,933
IN THAT STATUS.

75
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,668
>> YOU CONCURRED WITH THAT?

76
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:11,502
AND IS THERE A REAL DANGER IN

77
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:15,573
THE TWO SIDES LIKE THIS THAT

78
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:18,743
WHAT IS GOING ON OR NOT?>> I

79
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:20,578
THINK THERE IS THE DANGER OF

80
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:21,312
MISINTERPRETATION.

81
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,583
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU DO

82
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,384
ABOUT THAT TYPE OF RISK?

83
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:27,285
ONE THING TO MITIGATE THAT

84
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,154
RISK, WE ARE SEEING TREMENDOUS

85
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:31,455
USE OF -- AND FRANKLY THE OFFER

86
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:32,190
FROM THE SOUTH KOREANS EITHER

87
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,324
PROVIDING SERVICES.

88
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:35,893
HERE I AM REFERENCING THE

89
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:36,594
INTELLIGENCE.

90
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:37,528
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICES

91
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:43,935
SOUTH KOREA IS PLANNING THIS

92
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:44,435
INTERMEDIARY ROLE.

93
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:49,340
THEY HAVE ENABLED EACH OTHER TO

94
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,808
CLOSE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT NOT

95
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:51,342
COMPLETELY.

96
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:52,610
THIS IS PART OF MEETING AND

97
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,911
NEGOTIATIONS WHICH WILL BE KEY.

98
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:54,846
RISKING A LOT BELOW THE SURFACE

99
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,948
THAT NORMALLY DOES NOT COME TO

100
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:57,248
LIGHT.

101
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:01,586
>> CLEARLY, PERHAPS FORMALIZING

102
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:01,886
THIS.

103
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:03,688
IT COULD BE AN EASIER SELL AND

104
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:05,656
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MUCH MORE

105
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:09,460
EASILY ACHIEVED BUT WHAT ABOUT

106
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,328
THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

107
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:14,131
AND ARTILLERY ON THE BORDER?

108
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:14,999
AND EVEN HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

109
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,168
RISKING WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN

110
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:23,140
THE PAST WITH QADDAFI.

111
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,075
HE KNOWS THAT AND THAT HAS BEEN

112
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:24,542
HIS PROTECTION.

113
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,110
MARK CASSIDY REALLY GIVE KIM

114
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,811
JONG-UN GIVING OF HIS NUCLEAR

115
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:27,211
PROTECTION?

116
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:27,845
>> IS A MONUMENTAL TASK.

117
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:29,180
BUT I THINK THAT IS WHERE THIS

118
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,248
TYPE OF DEALS AND THE IDEA OF

119
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:33,651
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS CAN GET

120
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:34,552
IS THE BASIS OF THIS HIGH-LEVEL

121
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:37,288
TYPE OF INSTRUCTION HAPPENING.

122
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:39,490
>> WHAT WOULD MAKE THEM DO

123
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,024
THAT?

124
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:40,658
LET'S THAT IS PART OF THE

125
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:42,627
NEGOTIATIONS AND TERMS OF

126
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:43,961
PUTTING SOMETHING ON THE TABLE

127
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:44,996
HERE BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE

128
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:46,264
NORTH KOREAN CLAIMS AND

129
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:49,166
STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN

130
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,502
DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE UNITED

131
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:52,403
STATES, THINK THROUGH THIS TYPE

132
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:53,304
OF DISCUSSION THERE HAS BEEN A

133
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:55,573
BIG FOCUS ON TRYING TO GET TO

134
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:57,174
CONDITIONS THAT FEAR THEIR

135
00:03:57,174 --> 00:04:00,077
SECURITY NEEDS AS WELL AS THE

136
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:00,611
THREATS.

137
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,545
BUT BETTER THAN THAT THERE IS

138
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:02,480
DISCUSSION OF ECONOMIC

139
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,214
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

140
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:07,351
LEASING REFERENCE NOT IN THE

141
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:07,652
PAST.

142
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:08,386
THAT IS THE PART THAT COULD BE

143
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:08,786
NEW.

144
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:15,726
THE FAST TALKING KEMPER FAST

145
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:16,594
TRACK THIS, THE IDEA THAT IS

146
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:19,697
EXPANDED UPON ANDREW MOVING

147
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:20,598
INTO THIS LOCATIONS, THERE ARE

148
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,699
OPPORTUNITIES HERE BUT THE

149
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:26,837
CONCEPT OF MOVING FROM NUCLEAR

150
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:27,672
WEAPONS, IT IS CONCEPTUALLY

151
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:29,006
SOMETHING TO EXPLORE.

152
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:35,212
>> WHEN LOOKING AT THE SITE

153
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,047
THAT IS AN OPERATIONAL NOW.

154
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,281
DO YOU THINK IS REALLY READY TO

155
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:40,584
MOVE INTO THE MODERN WORLD?

156
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:41,485
YOU'VE SEEN THE PICTURES.

157
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:44,322
YOU THINK AFTER ALL OF THIS,

158
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:50,328
HAVING CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND

159
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:51,595
THE LIKE THAT HE IS READY TO

160
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:52,196
MOVE INTO CIVILIZATION?

161
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:55,333
>> THERE IS PEACE OF THE

162
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,200
DECLARATION THAT FOCUSES VERY

163
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,438
MUCH ABOUT THE FUTURE.

164
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:01,172
THE IDEA OF MOVING TO A

165
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,273
PERMANENT PEACE MECHANISM.

166
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:04,909
THERE ARE ALSO BIG REFERENCES

167
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:05,843
TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT.

168
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:06,744
ONE THING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN

169
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:07,578
MIND THAT NORTH KOREAN ELITES

170
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:08,846
HAVE TASTED THIS GLOBALIZED

171
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:09,847
LIFESTYLE AND IS PREDOMINANTLY

172
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,683
FROM THE ONE PERCENT THAT IS

173
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:13,584
MIGRATING OPERATING AND LIVING

174
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:15,386
IN THE CHINESE MARKETPLACE.

175
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:16,187
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, WHAT

176
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:17,822
THEY KNOW THE EXPERIENCE IS

177
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:18,422
VERY TANGIBLE.

178
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:21,559
I THINK THAT PART MAKES

179
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,860
INTERNAL COMMENCING OF SOME OF

180
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,862
THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WITHIN THE

181
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:25,596
NORTH KOREAN MUCH MORE

182
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:26,364
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

183
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:30,634
BUT IT IS THIS BARGAIN WHO DOES

184
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:31,268
WHAT, WHEN, WHERE AND HOW.

185
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,270
BECAUSE OF THE DETAILS WE WILL

186
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,537
SEE.

187
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:34,238
>> FINALLY, ONE THING THAT WE

188
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:35,506
THINK AS AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER

189
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:39,810
FORGET, OTTO WARMBIER.

190
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,178
HIS PARENTS NOW ARE SUING NORTH

191
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,046
KOREAN REGIME CLAIMING THAT

192
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:43,381
THEY BASICALLY MURDERED HIM IN

193
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:43,781
COLD BLOOD.

194
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,083
THAT THE 22-YEAR-OLD UNIVERSITY

195
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:46,684

BRUTALLY TORTURED AND KILLED.

197
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:53,190
BASICALLY BRAIN-DEAD FEARS OF

198
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,359
THE PRESENT DEMAND THAT KIM
