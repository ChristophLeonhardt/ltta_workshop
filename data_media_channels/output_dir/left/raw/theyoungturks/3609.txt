1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,480
EARLIER THIS WEEK ESPN MADE THE
DECISION TO SUSPEND ONE OF

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,109
ITS ANCHORS, OVER THE FACT THAT
SHE VIOLATED THE SOCIAL

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,559
MEDIA POLICY AND SHARED HER
POLITICAL OPINION ON TWITTER.

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,809
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT
HAVE MISSED IT, HERE IS THE

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,939
REASON WHY SHE GOT SUSPENDED.

6
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:20,370
THESE TWEETS INCLUDED, HERE
YOU GO, JERRY JONES ALSO HAS

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,370
CAUSED

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,060
GREATER PROBLEMS FOR HIS PLAYERS
SPECIFICALLY THE BLACK ONES.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,760
IF THEY DON'T KNEEL, SOME WILL
SEE THEM AS SELLOUTS.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,619
SHE GOES ON IF YOU STRONGLY
REJECT WHAT JERRY JONES

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,130
SAID, THE KEYS IS ADVERTISERS.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,520
DON'T PLACE THE BURDEN SQUARELY
ON THE PLAYERS.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,270
AND THEN IN THIS WHOLE STRING,
SHE LATER CLARIFIES WITH

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,930
HER COMMENTS PUTTING THIS.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,650
JUST A CLEAR: I'M NOT ADVOCATING
AN NFL BOYCOTT.

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,140
BUT AN UNFAIR BURDEN HAS BEEN
PUT ON PLAYERS IN DALLAS

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,180
AND MIAMI WITH ANTHEM
DIRECTORATES.

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,680
OF COURSE, SHE IS RESPONDING
TO OR COMMENTING ON THE

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,941
FACT THAT DALLAS COWBOYS OWNER
JERRY JONES SAID THAT HE

20
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,940
WOULD NOT TOLERATE ANY OF THE
PLAYERS ON THE TEAM

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,800
KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,440
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD BAR THEM
FROM PLAYING IF THEY DID SO

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,830
AND HILL REPORTS ON SPORTS AND
THIS HAS TO DO WITH SPORTS

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,590
AND I DON'T THINK SHE SAID
ANYTHING PARTICULARLY

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,080
CONTROVERSIAL, BUT OKAY, ESPN
DECIDED THEY SHE IS

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,220
VIOLATING OUR SOCIAL MEDIA
POLICY.

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,120
TO GET SUSPENDED AND OF COURSE
THE MANCHILD THAT WE HAVE

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,760
AS PRESIDENT DECIDED TO CHIME IN
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,010
IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE TO FOCUS
ON.

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,100
EARLY MORNING TWEETS ABOUT
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HURT HIS

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:40,970
FEELINGS ARE WAY MORE IMPORTANT.

32
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,580
HE TWEETS OUT THE
FOLLOWING:

33
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:50,330
YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T REALLY EVER
TALK ABOUT HIS RATINGS BECAUSE

34
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,830
HIS RATINGS ARE DOING VERY
POORLY.

35
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,620
AROUND 40% APPROVAL RATING.

36
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,430
AND HE'S ALSO NOT A MAN OF
SUBSTANCE THAT WE DOESN'T

37
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,440
CARE IF YOU ARE RIGHT OR
WRONG, HE JUST CARES, ARE YOU

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,470
RATING WELL OR NOT?

39
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,050
AND OF COURSE HE IS WRONG ABOUT
THIS.

40
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,130
ESPN HAS ISSUES.

41
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,410
IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO
WITH JEMELE HILL.

42
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,950
THEY HAVE LOST 12 MILLION
SUBSCRIBERS IN THE LAST 12

43
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,950
MONTHS.

44
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,860
PEOPLE ARE CUTTING
THEIR CABLE PACKAGES.

45
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,970
WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE CHANNEL
ON ALL OF THE CABLE BUNDLES?

46
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,970
ESPN.

47
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,820
THEY ARE THE TIP OF THE SPEAR
FOR THE CABLE INDUSTRY SO

48
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,790
THEY LOSE THE MOST AMOUNT OF
SUBSCRIBERS WHEN PEOPLE CUT

49
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,350
THEIR CABLE CORD AND THEY DON'T
SUBSCRIBE ANYMORE.

50
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,130
THE REST OF CABLE ALSO LOSES
SUBSCRIBERS BUT NOT AS MANY

51
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,610
AS IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT IN
AS MANY HOMES.

52
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,980
I TOLD YOU WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

53
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,420
THEYÃ­RE
GOING TO START FIRING A LOT

54
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,790
OF THEIR HOST.

55
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,300
BILL SIMMONS SAID THE WRONG
THING, KEITH OVERMAN SAID THIS.

56
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,920
NO, THEY HAD TO THROW SALARIES
OVERBOARD BECAUSE THEY

57
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,870
STARTED LOSING SO MUCH MONEY
BECAUSE OF THE DYNAMIC OF

58
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,830
THE INDUSTRY HAVING NOTHING TO
DO WITH THE HOSTS OR WHAT

59
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,500
THERE'D PUTTING ON AIR.

60
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,620
BUT TRUMP OF COURSE IS WAY TOO
UNINTELLIGENT TO UNDERSTAND

61
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,350
OR CARE ABOUT THE INDUSTRY
DYNAMICS.

62
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,440
HE WOULD KNOW IF IT SLEPT IT
ACROSS HIS FACE.

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,840
THE RATINGS MAN, IT MUST BE
WRONG AND MUST BE BECAUSE

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,520
THE PERSON CRITICIZE ME.

65
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,500
I'M NOT APPRISED AT ALL THAT
HE IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,390
ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON
WITH ESPN AND ITS RATINGS.

67
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,860
TO ME THAT'S NOT EVEN THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY.

68
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,440
THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY
HERE IS THAT WE HAVE THE

69
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,541
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
PUNISHING SOMEONE SPEECH.

70
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,240
THAT IS NOT ALLOWED.

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,459
THAT IS NOT ALLOWED BASED ON
THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF OUR

72
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:35,459
CONSTITUTION.

73
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,100
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

74
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,370
IF PRIVATE CITIZENS WANT TO
CRITICIZE HER, OF COURSE

75
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,560
THAT IS FAIR.

76
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,060
IF ESPN WANTS TO SUSPEND HER,
THEY ARE NOT FUNDED BY THE

78
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,060
GOVERNMENT.

79
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
THEY ARE NOT A GOVERNMENT
ENTITY.

80
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,390
THEY'VE ALL THE RIGHT IN THE
WORLD TO SUSPEND HER, EVEN

81
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,520
THOUGH I DISAGREE WITH THEIR
DECISION.

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,740
BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES CANNOT PUSH FOR

83
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,320
PUNISHMENTS TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO
EXERCISE SPEECH THAT HE

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,410
DISAGREES WITH.

85
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,950
HE IS A MANCHILD.

86
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,440
HE IS LITERALLY THE TOP
SNOWFLAKE IN THIS COUNTRY,

87
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,630
PROBABLY INTERNATIONALLY.

88
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,930
HE CANNOT HANDLE ANY TYPE OF
CRITICISM WHATSOEVER AND

89
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,730
WHY IS HE SO HYPER FOCUSED ON
NONSENSE LIKE THIS?

90
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,430
THIS TWEET HAPPENED AT 3:42 IN
THE MORNING.

91
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,720
THE GUY IS A LUNATIC.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
GO TO SLEEP.

93
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,220
I WILL TELL YOU WHY.

94
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,500
WHY IS HE OBSESSED WITH BLACK
PLAYERS KNEELING OR JEMELE HILL.

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,880
YOU KNOW WHY.

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
HE IS A WHITE SUPREMACIST.

97
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
HE IS.

98
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,430
IN HIS BONES, HE IS RACIST
THROUGH AND THROUGH.

99
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,100
THAT IS WHY NOT ONLY DID HE NOT
BELIEVE THAT OBAMA WAS A US

100
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,150
CITIZEN, HE DEMANDED HIS COLLEGE
TRANSCRIPTS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT,

101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,290
HOW COULD A BLACK GUY GET GOOD
GRADES AT COLUMBIA AND HARVARD?

102
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,270
HE IS DEEPLY RACIST.

103
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,180
THAT IS HIS ASSUMPTIONS.

104
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,600
CENTRAL PARK FIVE, WE'VE BEEN
OVER ALL OF THE STUFF.

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,831
GUYS WHO DIDN'T DO IT.

106
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,870
HE IS LIKE I GUESS YOU ROT
IN JAIL ANYWAY.

107
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,210
THEY ARE BLACK, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

108
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,210
SO JAMELE

109
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,130
HILL GETS UNDER HIS SKIN BECAUSE
SHE IS POINTING OUT WHAT HE

110
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,990
IS, HE IS A RACIST MONSTER AND
THAT IS WHY HE HATES THOSE

111
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,860
BLACK PLAYERS WHO ARE PROTESTING
POLICE ABUSE.

112
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,471
I LIKE THAT SOME OF THE OTHER ON
THEIR PEOPLE AT ESPN AND ARE

113
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,560
FIGHTING BACK.

114
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
THEY ARE FIGHTING BACK.

115
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,530
SOME OF HER COLLEAGUES HAVE
TWEETED IN SUPPORT OF HILL

116
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,070
AND I APPRECIATE THEM FOR DOING
IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW

117
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,360
THAT THEY MIGHT GET SUSPENDED
OVER THIS.

118
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,860
LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES.

119
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,800
JOSINA ANDERSON SAYS:

120
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,389
I WANT TO STOP THERE FOR A
SECOND BECAUSE I WANT THOSE

121
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,150
ON THE RIGHT WHO CANNOT HANDLE
ANYONE CRITICIZING YOUR

122
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,760
DEAR LEADER TO IMAGINE THE SHOE
ON THE OTHER FOOT.

123
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,160
IMAGINE OBAMA PUSHING FOR
PUNISHMENTS AGAINST SOMEONE

124
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,590
LIKE SEAN HANNITY.

125
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,300
1ST OF ALL, WE WOULD CONDEMN
HIM FOR THAT AND YOU WOULD

126
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,960
DEFINITELY CONDEMN HIM FOR THAT
AS YOU SHOULD BECAUSE THAT

127
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,430
IS A VIOLATION OF THE
CONSTITUTION.IN THIS CASE,

128
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,639
TRUMP IS DOING IN THE RIGHT WING
IS LIKE YEAH, WHATEVER.

129
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,710
SHE SHOULD GET FIRED.

130
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,300
THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AT ALL

131
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,710
THAT HE TELLS THEM THAT THEY
SHOULD SHUT UP, THE PLAYERS.

132
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,130
NOW JEMELE HILL AND YOU APPLAUD
HIM.

133
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,050
AS ANA POINTED OUT, ESPN CAN DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT AND WHEN IT

134
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,500
COMES TO THEIR ADVERTISERS THEY
GET EVEN TOUCHIER, BUT WHEN THE

135
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,860
PRESIDENT IS PRESSURING ESPN OR
THE COWBOYS OR THE NFL TO FIRE

136
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,790
PEOPLE OR NOT PAY THEM OR
SUSPEND THEM, THAT IS A

137
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,910
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE, AND IF YOU
CARE ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH

138
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,380
AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, YOU
SHOULD BE OUTRAGED AND IF YOU

139
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,970
ARE NOT OUTRAGED, JUST UP
PRETENDING YOU CARE ABOUT

140
00:06:28,970 --> 00:00:00,000
THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE
CONSTITUTION.
