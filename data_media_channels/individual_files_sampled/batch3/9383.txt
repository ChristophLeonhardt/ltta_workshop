GREG: CASE YOU MISSED IT IS ALL DONE TRUMPS FALL. EVERYTHING. HE IS THE REASON CLIMATE CHANGE IS AND EARTHQUAKES THOSE FAULTS ARE HIS FAULT. A LITTLE WORDPLAY FOR SATURDAY NIGHT. YOU DON'T GET THAT ON "WATTERS' WORLD". EVERYTHING A BAD THING EVER, I LOVE JESSE, EVERYTHING BAD EVER WAS ON THE HEAD OF THIS EVIL ORANGE MONSTER FROM HELL. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE THE MEDIA. TAKE THESE IMAGES OF IMMIGRANT SLEEPING IN CADIZ. THEY ALL BLAME TRUMP AND IT TURNS OUT THE PHOTOS ARE FOUR YEARS OLD AND WHEN OBAMA WAS IN CHARGE. THEN THERE IS EVEN BETTER, AND ALL BABY DETENTION BUS ALSO BLAMED ON TRUMP BUT IT WAS CALLED A PRISON BUS FOR BABIES. A PRISON BUS FOR BABIES. HOW CAN ANYONE SAY THAT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND BELIEVE IT. A JOURNALIST. WHO WOULD MAKE A PRISON BUS FOR BABIES? IF THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD. THE PRISON BUS FOR BABIES. YOU WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING IF YOU HATE TRUMP. THIS PHOTO WAS ALSO FROM OBAMA'S ERA AND NO, IT WASN'T A PRISON BUS FOR BABIES. IT WAS FOR A FIELD TRIP. ANYWAY, I EXPECT THE MEDIA TO CHECK THE DATE ON THE PHOTO AND THAT IS THEIR JOB TO CHECK FACTS BUT IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY NEED HELP. TOM, WHAT IS UP? LOOK AT THIS. IMMIGRANT CHILDREN SLEEPING ON CADIZ IN THE FLOOR. A PRISON BUS JUST FOR BABIES. IF THIS DOESN'T PROVE HOW EVIL AND HEARTLESS DONALD TRUMP IS, NOTHING WILL. I LOOKED IT UP IN THAT CAGE PHOTO IS FROM 2014 AND THAT BUS IS FOR A FIELD TRIP FROM APRIL 2016. WELL, I WAS ABOUT TO TWEET THIS OUT TO THE PUBLIC. SOUND LIKE YOU NEED A THERE IS SCOPE. IT WILL HELP YOU SEE THINGS CLEARLY FOR WHAT THEY REALLY ARE. THAT IS A SOLDIER GETTING ROWDY DURING SLEEP WEEK. THAT IS TRUMPS FALL. TRY THIS DOWN. THAT'S A WOMAN UPSET ABOUT THE CURRENT POLITICAL MOMENT. THAT IS A MONSTER ATTACKING JAPAN. YOU DO QUALIFY FOR THEIR SCOPE. DOESN'T HAVE SPECIAL POWERS? NO, BUT WILL HELP YOU PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS. TOM, HOW IS IT GOING? SEEN YOUR STUPID FACE IS WAS PART OF MY DAY. THANK YOU. FOR WHEN YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR FACTS BEFORE YOU TWEET SOMETHING STUPID BACK. GREG: TRUMP HAS THE BEST WALKING AROUND THE CORNER INTO A HOLY BOOK OF ANY COMMERCIAL ACTOR BUT I THANK YOU LEARN SOMETHING FROM HIM. HE'S KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. GREG: THE WALKING DOWN THE HALL YES, IT ABOUT AS YOU AND I'VE SEEN YOU ON TWITTER BUT WHEN THERE IS A FALSE STORY YOU GET VERY UPSET. YEAH, THE NEWS MEDIA IS AWFUL AND WE ALL USED TO KNOW THAT. FIVE YEARS AGO YOU'D BE LIKE CNN IS TERRIBLE AND EVERYONE BE LIKE YEAH, WE KNOW AND I SAY SEEN IN TERRIBLE BECAUSE TRUMP THEM LIKE NO, NO, THEY ARE GREAT. WE UP UPON THE FIRST LIMIT. HAVE YOU SEEN DON LEMONS SHOW? THAT IS NOT JOURNALISM BACK HIS ENTIRE SHOW IS AN EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINING TO HIM WHAT HAPPENED ON ANDERSON COOPER. GREG: SO TRUE. THAT IS SO TRUE. TYRUS: YOU ARE IN TROUBLE NOW. GREG: CAT, IS IT EASIER TO BLAME TRUMP FOR EVERYTHING? I'M SURE YOUR OWN DISCIPLINE AS KAT: I WILL START DOING THAT. THE THING WHERE I GET UPSET WITH MYSELF FOR MY BAD CHOICES IS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND THIS THING WHERE I HAVE APOLOGIZED WHEN I DONE SOMETHING WRONG, I'M NOT DOING THAT ANYMORE. NEXT TIME I DO SOMETHING WRONG I WILL LIMIT ON TOP AND KNOW THAT A HUGE SEGMENT OF THE PUBLISHING WILL BELIEVE ME WITHOUT EVEN CHECKING. I WILL NEVER SAY HEY, I'M SORRY I BASED ON YOUR BABY ON ACCIDENT OR FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS A TRUMP MADE ME DO IT AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW I'LL BE A VICTIM. GREG: I SAVED ON YOUR BABY? KAT: SOMETIMES THEY COME OUT OF NOWHERE. GREG: TIRES, THERE SO MANY WHEN AN ENTIRE OPINION SHIFTS AND YOU INTRODUCE A VARIABLE AND IS IN THE FORM BUT TRUMP IS FOR THAT BUT LIBERALS AREN'T BECAUSE TRUMP WAS. TYRUS: WAS THE QUESTION QUESTION WAS WEIRD. GREG: I NEVER ASK QUESTIONS. TYRUS: US ME THE QUESTION AND THIS IS WEIRD BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE IN SPORT SO I'M THE LEADING OFFICIAL ON DENNIS RODMAN AND WHOOPI GOLDBERG. I DON'T KNOW, MAN, IN SOME WAYS IT'S CONVENIENT BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WHEN OBAMA WAS AND EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING WAS OBAMA'S FAULT AND THERE'S A CERTAIN SET OF PEOPLE THAT EVERYTHING IN THEIR LIFE IS NOT THE FAULT AND WHEN YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION THEY LEAD WITH STATEMENTS LIKE YOU MADE ME UPSET OR IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU THAT I'M A SCREAMING LOUD AND NOT GOING TO BED AT A DECENT TIME AND ALWAYS MAKING OUR RELATIONSHIP DIFFICULT. IT IS YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE KNOWS ANYONE LIKE THAT BUT I'VE COME ACROSS A FEW PEOPLE AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY DONALD TRUMP BUT HE'S COMING IN. HE IS THE NEW MUNSON. I GOT TRUMPED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. HE IS THE GUY TO BLAME. IF YOU BLAME THEM FOR SOMETHING HE HEARS YOU THE CHANCES ARE HE WILL BUT YOU BACK SO YOU GET YOUR AUDIENCE. GREG: IN A WEIRD WAY TRUMP IS LIKE THE WEATHER. YOU WALK OUTSIDE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO THAT BUT TRUMP ALSO TAKES CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING. HE SAYS ONLY I CAN FIX IT. I ALONE CAN DO THIS. IN A WAY IT'S A PERFECT RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM IN THE MEDIA. THEY GET THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY DESPERATELY DESERVE AND THEY ARE GETTING IT GOOD AND HARD. GREG: THE POINT. MAC SOLUTION FOR NEWS IS THEY HAVE TO GET REAL LIKE THE LOWER THIRD IS A REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CONSULTANT OR STRATEGIST OR ANALYST AND SAY I HATE TRUMP AND THEN I'M OKAY WITH THE GUY.
