Michael Cohen might not have been the only insider taping conversations with President Trump multiple people tell The Daily Beast that former apprentice star and presidential aide Omarosa Marin Ghul rolled on some conversations with the president and use them to shop around her soon-to-be released book unhinged so yet another dramatic betrayal by a one-time confidante the president of course suggesting without proof that he was actually the one taped by Barack Obama and James Comey let's not forget that daily beast reporter Lachlan Marquis who broke the story joins us now my panel is here as well so Lachlan what is your story your sources tell you about the these supposedly recordings well we spoke to three sources one of whom actually heard one of these recordings and two of them had had the contents described to them and they all described them as probably not as incriminating as the recordings that Michael Cohen made of the president but I think it does point to a major breakdown in trust between the president and someone who was very close to him for well over a decade through his career in reality TV and into the White House who really tells everyone who will listen how much the president trusts her and has now decided to sort of cash in on her time in the White House break with the president in a very big way and obviously recording him without his knowledge would be you know an extremely significant breach of that trust look we don't want to project what might be on these tapes or how many they are but would it be fair to say Lachlan that what your source is heard may not or probably are not all the tapes that exist and if she used them to shop the book there's something on there I'm not saying that's criminal but at least it's gonna sell books I think it's certainly possible that there are more recordings we reached out to Simon & Schuster the publisher of her forthcoming book who essentially said they wouldn't confirm or deny that she had recorded these conversations but they said we are confident that there is documentation or enough evidence to back up every claim that Omarosa is making in this book now obviously they want to avoid a situation that resulted from say Michael Wolf's fire in theory but where there was a lot of disputed information but that suggested to me at that there could be additional information in there that is backed up by recordings and if and when the white house attempts to challenge potentially some of the more damaging information in this book that could be an occasion where they come forward with documentation or even a recording to show that what she's saying is accurate so a B there's this bring to mind the old phrase with friends like this who needs enemies no I think it brings come on the phrase if you mess with the bull you get the horns because President Trump knew exactly what he was getting by making Omarosa a West Wing adviser she has a reputation of using any means to put herself first she stabs in the back she stabs in the front and and it's not a problem it's really sport so what I don't know what the tapes are gonna reveal but the fact is he he gave her this privilege and access and he knows her he knew reputation not only behind closed doors but I guess on The Apprentice where this was her character and and I'm just not at all surprised I used to play it well right I mean I if the tapes exist and we it sounds like these tapes exist Ben I mean what does it say about life inside the West Wing is everybody gotta be looking over their shoulder because who knows what's on tape of course they do I mean and we all know that this is an incredibly backbiting infighting White House in which everybody is leaking about everybody else and out for their own agenda and AV is exactly right what didn't you expect when you hired Omarosa for the White House like I'm thinking about this and thinking about myself five years ago if you told me I'd be on television talking about Omarosa taping President Trump in the White House I would have laughed at you I would have you know I would never have believed that we'd be talking about this but of course you hire her of course she's in it for herself in it to make some money down the road and one way to do that is have tapes and who knows what President Trump says on these tape probably nothing terribly embarrassing but this is a white house filled with people who are constantly looking over their shoulders constantly worried about who's leaking it comes as absolutely no surprise to anybody on earth that Omarosa tape the president like I don't want to read an excerpt from a page that you got from Omarosa yet to be released book about a hunt for leakers inside the White House and this is what Omarosa writes very low-key Ivanka Trump went around to the original Trump errs the loyal soldiers and asked the team to compile a list of suspected leakers I'd already said my piece about Katie Walsh directly to Donald and she'd been let go but if Vanka wanted a new list and once she had it she would give it to scaramouche E so he could fire them all the final list that was texted to me on July 22nd had ten names on it so now we have a hit list right yeah and you know there were some names that a lot of viewers will know on there folks like Raj Shah the deputy press secretary Michael short who was a press aide who came in with with sort of the RNC crew at the in the early days of the way Trump on the list of leakers he is not I don't think scaramouche he was gonna march into the Oval and try to fire him but you know it does go to the the issue of sort of trust and and a lot of this backbiting that Ben was talking about from the the very early days of the White House and and I think it speaks to why someone would end up taping conversations with the president there's just this immense lack of trust between colleagues in the White House up to and including the president and it's very hard to form a coherent policy agenda or a coherent messaging strategy when you don't trust the person sitting next to you and you're constantly looking over your shoulder worried that the next person is going to be leaking or or accusing you of leaking that was a very common way of sort of undercutting rivals in the White House so you know I think it speaks to the sort of larger dysfunction that Americans see on a day-to-day basis a lot of that is personnel issues and people simply simply not trusting the person sitting next to them hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks
