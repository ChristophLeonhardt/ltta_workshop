1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,700
“They keep coming.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,780
Two million illegal immigrants
in California.”

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,780
It was 1994 when California’s
Republican governor,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,760
Pete Wilson, ran these ads
during his re-election bid.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,980
“There’s a right way,
and there’s a wrong way.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,590
To reward the wrong way

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,310
is not the American way.”

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,080
Wilson was plugging
a ballot measure

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,930
called Prop 187,
which tried to block

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,020
undocumented immigrants from
accessing public services,

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,980
like education.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,010
“We need Pete
Wilson as governor.”

13
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,300
In the short term,
Wilson’s messaging worked.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,060
He was re-elected
governor.

15
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,010
But long term, the fallout
from Prop 187 helped turn

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,290
a generation of Latinos
in California into Democrats.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,810
Today, the Latino
population in California

18
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,860
is the largest of any state.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,840
And 63% are
registered Democrats.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,240
And now, the president has
given them more reasons

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,300
to make their voices heard.

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,280
“These are animals.”

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,600
“They’re rapists.”
“Like we have no border.”

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,210
“Mexico’s paying for the wall.”

25
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,410
Latinos could play a critical role

26
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,110
in some of California’s 
congressional races,

27
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,840
potentially flipping seats
and helping Democrats

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,670
regain control of the House.

29
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,590
They could also help elect
California’s first modern-day

30
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,150
Latino governor.

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,370
But will they go to the polls?

32
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,340
Latinos make up
34% of California’s

33
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,100
adult population.

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,050
But they’re only 18% of the
state’s voting population.

35
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,220
One reason they don’t have the
electoral power you’d expect

36
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,930
could be that politicians
haven’t reached out enough.

37
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,350
Antonio Villaraigosa,
who is running for governor,

38
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,590
is the clearest
example of a candidate

39
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,180
trying to change that.

40
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,880
He’s tapping into
fear and anger

41
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,980
over Trump’s agenda
in a number of ads

42
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,790
in English and Spanish.

43
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,380
In this one, which could be

44
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,130
confused with a
Hollywood movie,

45
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,380
he and a group of activists

46
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,670
leave drinking water
for border crossers.

47
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,970
“I'm the youngest child of a
single immigrant mother.”

48
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,390
Another high profile Latino
candidate, Kevin de León,

49
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,790
also talks about his
own life story as a way

50
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,760
to engage Latino voters.

51
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,420
“I owe it to this single mother.

52
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,230
This woman and millions like her,

53
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,499
throughout the state,
throughout the country,

54
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:07,630
who would do everything
within their power

55
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,139
to protect their children.”

56
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,150
Gil Cisneros is a
leading candidate

57
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,100
in a heavily Latino
House district

58
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,650
where the Republican
congressman is retiring.

59
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,410
This ad focuses on giving
Latinos the opportunity

60
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,440
to go to college.

61
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,600
It’s too early to tell if
this messaging will work

62
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,040
to awaken what some call 
the “sleeping giant”

63
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,640
of the Latino vote.

64
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,780
But in the lead up to
the November midterms,

65
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,240
we’ll see more outreach
and advertising

66
00:02:34,240 --> 00:00:00,000
directed at Latinos in this
key state for Democrats.
