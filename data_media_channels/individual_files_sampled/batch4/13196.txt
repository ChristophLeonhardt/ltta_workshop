I spy with my little eye Democrats threatening our republic as the Muller investigation into Roger stones niece's Lemonade Stand from 1996 enters into its fifth decade the White House is finally pushing back as it should because the more we learn about the rush investigation the clearer it becomes that it's a force initiated by Barack Obama's corrupt crooked machine administration we will analyze the facts as they stand today they seem always to be changing but we'll analyze what we have then Google stops telling its employees not to be evil we're gonna analyze what that means for conservatives Starbucks goes full homeless shanty what that says about our culture and the incredible stories of American soldiers escaping Nazi occupied France on this day in history and if we have

seen the tweet over the weekend from Donald Trump President Trump tweeted out he goes quote I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI / DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump campaign for political purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama administration now this caused me to remember one of my favorite Obama tweets he tweeted this a while ago it's just the absolute incredible troll levels of Barack Obama it's a photo it's a photo of him with a magnifying glass looking in at a girl and then the tweet just says I spy dot he told you right there you know as he said he did it he so he tweets that were finally Donald Trump is getting really hard I think the timing here is important but for a long time we've been told look the Moller investigation it's just the FBI they're not politically motivated its objective they're just trying to get to the facts nobody is politically motivated here come nobody is stealing the election comp nobody's blah blah blah in fact when Donald Trump suggested on the campaign trail that there might be some shenanigans going on behind the scene Hillary Clinton vigorously denied those rigged election claims here is campaign Hillary it's horrifying you know every time Donald thinks things you're not going in his direction he claims whatever it is is rigged against him the FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my emails they concluded there was no case he said the FBI was rigged this is a mindset this is this is how Donald thinks and it's funny but it's also really troubling really troubling terrifying horrifying by the way we'll get into how the FBI handled Hillary versus how the FBI handled Donald Trump because it is night and day and it's total evidence that Hillary Clinton was lying for her it's ironic of course because immediately after the election she says it's all rigged it's all terrible this wasn't even a one off line this wasn't even just something she said on on the debate stage Hillary Clinton kept lecturing people here she is at our campaign rally on Wednesday night Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done he refused to say that he would respect the results of this election now make no mistake by doing that he is threatening our democracy look if you lose an election I've lost elections you don't feel very good the next day do you but we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship right what she didn't tell you is that she's the dictator it kind of sounds in that limp like she's saying you know I prefer democracy no no because immediately after the election when she lost she went you know before she said well look this sometimes people lose you got to lose you got to deal with it then after she lost I believe she said if I could quote correctly there was I might be paraphrasing she starts to blame everybody she says that Russia rigged the election she undermines the legitimacy of that election she implied that it was illegitimate what is she doing now we're now what two years in almost two years in she keeps flying overseas criticizing the administration criticizing Donald Trump saying you know that he's undermining the us on the world stage that she doesn't support the policy of her own country really unpatriotic stuff she's one of the best among them as far as undermining the Republican administration goes she's positively restrained compared to other leading Democrats her husband's former Vice President Al Gore he just recently told a University of Maryland graduates at their commencement that Donald Trump needs to be removed from office forcibly here is and I get it there are I know a great many supporters a president Trump in this audience I do understand that as one of his supporters put it on television he said the way I look at it Donald Trump is chemotherapy for America well in medicine and in science some experiments are terminated early for ethical reasons zing good one al you get it terminated early for ethical reasons so not a great joke didn't really land but also interesting to hear he says I know some of you support the president were a University of Maryland this is not exactly a conservative campus you know big state school East Coast and yet when he said that people people start cheering your yeah your your right buddy because Donald Trump is doing well he's got good approval ratings everything is going well domestically and overseas other than the ginned up controversy is that the federal bureaucracy and the Democrats keep trying to throw on him but in reality things are going very well but then he says sometimes in science treatment has to be terminated early for ethical reasons now what do you say he's trying to make a joke he's also saying something we need to terminate this presidency early we need to do it we lost the election but we can't tolerate that we lost the election we can't abide that the American people wanted something but we know it's not good for them we know it's not good so we need to terminate it early and this is part and parcel of Democrats strategy to try to impeach the president this is not a conspiracy this is not to quote Hillary Clinton a vast right-wing conspiracy Democrats have been speaking openly and holding press conferences about how they want to impeach the president why I don't because they don't like him because they just don't like him that much here we have a representative Steve Cohen talking about how they're going to impeach the president I'm proud to stand here with my friend congressman Gutierrez with other Congress people who will be here and announcing that we're introducing articles of impeachment to remove to trump from office they will be a I believe six signatories on the resolution Democrats only respect elections when Democrats win that's when they respect elections Democrats only respect democracy when Democrats win democratic elections it's as simple as that they do not respect the electoral process in fact the Democrats have been trying to subvert the electoral process since long before this election we know that now they denied it at the time they lied to our faces at the time all the way up to the top but now we know that bombshell information now shows that Barack Obama's FBI interfered with and spied on Donald Trump's campaign much earlier than anybody thought we know that the FBI planted a spy in the Trump campaign that we have evidence of them they've been denying it the whole time now it just slowly over the last year and a half it's chiseled away at their narrative they are liars they have no credibility when they open their mouths James Comey Barack Obama Loretta Lynch when they open their mouths there is no reason to believe a word that comes out of them they are public Liars so we know that we also know that James Comey lied about when the Russia investigations started James Comey said that the Russia investigation began in late July 2016 okay what was that based on in part I suppose it's based on that steel dossier which was totally ginned up and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and by Democrats so we see collusion there between the Democrats and the FBI but now we know that an FBI informant who has been outed according to reports as Cambridge University professor Stephen helper that FBI report informants started reporting to the FBI in early July 2016 totally undercuts James Comey and we know that James Comey lied about this he says the investigation began in late July and yet the FBI's informant they snuck into the Trump campaign to spy on it that guy was reporting back to the FBI by early July the timelines don't add up who is this guy who is helper professor helper is a long-standing republican helper worked in the Nixon administration the Ford administration Reagan administration and this guy was sent in by the FBI to spy on Trump employee quarter-page and campaign employee George papadopolis you went in there and spied on both of those guys now did he just do it out of the goodness of his heart no we know that the FBI paid Halper the federal government paid alper four hundred and eleven thousand dollars between 2016 and 2017 to put that in perspective that's more than the annual salary of the President of the United States well it's much more than the annual salary of the current president the United States who doesn't take any money for his job he takes a dollar a year or something but the president by law is supposed to make four hundred thousand dollars a year this FBI informant was paid four hundred eleven thousand dollars between 2016 and 2017 what was he doing for that why was the FBI why was the national security apparatus investing so much money in this guy this guy who's going in to spy on the Republican nominees campaign for president of the United States FBI under the administration of a Democrat Barack Obama this guy is being paid a ton of money to go in and spy on the Republican now some of the Trump critics even on the right they can't admit the gross injustice of all of this nominal Republican eric erickson who used to run redstate.com he tweeted out quote so a question how does one infiltrate a political campaign is more than a menial volunteer I mean if someone got on payroll in the main office and was a spy that reeks of incompetence on the campaign's part doesn't Trump only hire the best people like he is making excuses for Obama's FBI which is spying on the Republican campaign this is a nominal Republican who's doing this he would have been a good defense attorney for Alger Hiss that that is that's crazy what this guy is a well credentialed former employee of Richard Nixon Gerald Ford Ronald Reagan he's a respected academic just because he's duplicitous and deceptive doesn't mean that you'd have to be foolish to speak to him that's know what that means at all this guy is a long-standing Republican political operative he a guy who's well-respected in academic circles it I don't think it's crazy to let that guy in and have some meetings with him well you don't have to be a bumbling idiot to do that the story here is not on the incompetence of the Trump campaign this guy was a three-time White House staffer what the story is here is on the duplicity and the deception of Barack Obama's national security apparatus and Barack Obama's investigative agencies so we know at this point it's just a side note we know because this the anti-trump stuff is crazy it's craziest from the people on the right because it totally misses the point it absolutely misses the point when you've got these egregious crimes being committed by the left and by the federal bureaucracy and they say yeah but you know Trump he's a dummy isn't he like guys what are you talking about what are you talking about the Democrats and the federal bureaucracy are trying to undermine the duly elected conservative Republican president United States and you're taking their side are you kidding me so we know the official story is BS James Comey lied John Brennan lied not just Comey the FBI director John Brennan CIA director for Barack Obama John Brennan by the way Barack Obama CIA director who voted for the Communist Party nominee for president in 1976 somehow under Barack Obama this guy gets to be in charge of the CIA that we could do a whole show on on talk about incompetence or nefarious motives so John Brennan Barack Obama's CIA director he knows that he lied and he's getting nervous he tweets this out today tweets Club Senator McConnell and speaker Ryan if mr. Trump's continues along this disastrous path you will bear major responsibility for the harm done to our democracy you do a great disservice to our nation and the Republican Party if you continue to enable mr. Trump's self-serving actions you getting nervous there John is that what's going on you know guys you sound like you're getting a little nervous why would you be getting nervous because John Brennan Obama's CIA director said that the Democrat cooked up steel dossier was not used as the basis for the Russian investigation he didn't know anything about it I don't know anything about that still does yeah except we later found out he know about the seal dossier and he talked to a lot of people about the steel dossier and he was spreading it all around DC CNN has even admitted that the FBI used the dossier as justification to begin spying on the Trump campaign even CNN admits that when CNN admits something damaging to Democrats you just can't deny it anymore it is beyond the point at which you can deny it now still the timelines don't quite add up do they did the investigation begin in late July to begin in early July it looks like it began at both times some people gave the go-ahead here some people gave the go-ahead here it doesn't really matter because now by the mark my words with Democrats are gonna try to do is say there well the Republicans are saying it began at two different times and so that doesn't add up the fact that you can point to two different times when it officially began and the official statements of Obama administration employee is saying what began here it began here at began here what it really points out is that broadly speaking the Obama administration was determined to help Hillary Clinton and hurt Donald Trump how are they gonna do it they're gonna send in spies to the Trump campaign they'll do that that's one way and then okay we got this dossier that Hillary funded okay we're gonna go we're gonna use that we're gonna but we're gonna get him we're gonna go get him because that's how Barack Obama used his government Barack Obama I know this I'm a member of an organization that was targeted by Barack Obama's IRS a relative relative ly right-wing organization nonprofit organization I was targeted by Barack Obama's IRS while he was targeting many others he did it because he used the government to get his political opponents looks like he did the same thing here Bill Clinton met with then Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her airplane while that plane was parked at the Phoenix tarmac walks on the plane later they say oh we were just talking about our grandkids so really the former president met with the sitting Attorney General who's about to investigate his wife for deleting federal records and mishandling classified material you guys were just talking about your grandchildren right that's what you're doing you know they're good okay anything else we're gonna talk now I guess not I don't get walks off the plane no way when that meeting leaked because they tried to hide it from the public when that meeting leaked the FBI scrambled to identify and punish to source of the leak that's according to another leak that came out last December and a leak not reported by the white right-wing press that was even reported by Newsweek we know that happened James Comey admits that he exonerated Hillary Clinton before the FBI interviewed her he admits that in his new book not a conspiracy he's had to admit it because the facts did not match his narrative how about the first draft of his letter exonerated Hillary Clinton's the first draft of that accused her of gross negligence because obviously she was grossly negligent she mishandled a ton of classified material and then she bleached all of the all of the materials a later draft changed that phrase to extremely careless grossly negligent became extremely careless why is that because gross negligence can mean prison time and fines and the politicized Barack Obama administration and Barack Obama's FBI James commis FBI didn't want that to happen James Comey also admitted that he publicized that second letter that October letter so that Hillary's inevitable regime would not be illegitimate he didn't do it to hurt Hillary he did it because he knew that she was gonna win and he wanted to give her all the political advantages he could going into her administration that is the Obama FBI the Obama DOJ we know that Hillary Clinton mishandled emails we don't know what kind of graft she was covering up because she wiped her servers she'd destroyed federal Records with bleach bit and we know from Peter struck that FBI official we know from his texts that a redacted source writes quote the right the White House is running this the White House is running this with regard to investigations in Donald Trump we have it in those texts ari fleischer tweeted it out today the former press secretary for George W Bush tweeted out hey how come no one's talking about this the FBI said the White House is running this advant investigation this Muller investigation has gone on forever I think at this point they legitimately are investigating manna forts cousins sisters nieces lemonade stand that she had in Long Island in 1982 that's what that's all they're going for the Muller investigation that's going on forever it's clear that he doesn't have a smoking gun you know and photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's sunning together in Cabo the the satire website resistance hole ran a headline this and boom we've got you Donald Trump a 13th century tapestry from Franciscan monks shows Trump and Putin colluding together is that you know that's what they're going on they're going after totally irrelevant things and this investigation now has unfettered anti constitutional power it's naked ly political there's no more pretense that this is unbiased that it's nonpartisan it's just about law and order and patriotism that's what we've been told it is naked ly political it always has been everything relating to Barack Obama is naked ly political he's never done anything that isn't politics it's all politics the GOP would ignore this at its own peril we cannot abide this fiction any more that this is oh that's unbiased oh that's okay they've been gunning for the Republican nominee since before he was the Republican nominee or right around the time that he was they've been gunning for him they've been using every excuse in the book it's naked Lee political and we need to fight back speaking of institutional wickedness Google has now this is like a caricature of his story Google's old motto from its code of conduct used to be don't be evil don't be evil okay that's pretty funny you know hahaha whatever they've repealed that code google now you know it censors conservatives and has all of our data and does a very spooky organization they they now don't say don't be evil they've replaced don't be evil with do the right thing okay I think what's the big deal that tells us a lot don't be evil a very simple they had it for its entire existence decades of existence then do the right thing huh do the right thing is much more Machiavellian do the right thing as mummy is what do the right thing says implicitly is that sometimes evil things maybe can be good it's a sort of situational ethics don't be evil they thought that don't be evil didn't get at what they were trying to do said do the right thing okay do the right thing means sometimes you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet get a little bit evil what it also says though is that Google is becoming more overtly sjw social justice warrior overtly progressive it's not don't be evil it's not just be an umpire don't do bad things you can't just stand by now according to them you've got to actively push this sjw agenda the social justice warrior agenda and it's happening we see it happening ourselves we see it when they censor The Daily wire now when you search for Daily wire articles you get Snopes results and PolitiFact results fact of left-wing fact checkers that's oh no you don't want to read The Daily wire that oh they're right-wing you don't read the left-wing one instead that's better they don't do this to left-wing websites they do it to the to right-wing websites YouTube which is owned by Google censors us all the time I mean we're constantly my episode last week I don't even remember what I was talking about I was talking about some Democrat corruption and it just cut off right in the middle they just censored they said we can't let this guy keep talking they constantly D monetize conservative videos they constantly censor conservative speech Dennis Prager did a video about how you should not murder on the Ten Commandment series they said no this isn't suitable for college students no can't do it can't do it expect more of this to come obviously they've been pushing a progressive narrative for a long time at Google now they're being evert about it they're admitting it it's only gonna get worse speaking of great things getting worse Starbucks Starbucks is going full homeless camp now so you remember earlier this month a black man was arrested at Starbucks and this became a big hullabaloo and the reason he the police were called I suppose he wasn't arrested the police were called and it's because these guys came in and were just sitting at the table and after a while one of the employees came up and said hey you have to purchase a product in order to sit and use our space you can't just sit here this isn't like a public park you've got to buy our product to be here they said no which are you kidding me you go how rude and ridiculous you go and you buy the product but they said no we're not gonna some multiple times they come always say hey you know you gotta buy something he said no they asked them to leave and they said no like bartleby the scrivener no I'd prefer not to no I prefer not to so eventually they call the police and this became some big big news story as though as though it's horrifying that an employer that a store says you have to buy their product to be in their space anywho Starbucks instead of saying hey guys you have to buy our product to be in our space they're now saying no no you don't need to buy anything you can hang out here you can use our bathrooms anybody who's in our space even if they don't buy a product their customers which just isn't true because customer has a definition again as Starbucks can't change the definition of a word this is a customer hasn't meaning that isn't true but they're fighting against reality and so it's about these bathrooms you can use the bathrooms even if you don't buy anything why is it that these days all political fights are about bathrooms that is really weird isn't it the transgender bathroom the Starbucks bathroom why is that I actually think because it's about who can use which bathrooms who gets to use it and who decides who gets to use it is it the people who own the bathroom or is it the mob which is it who decides who gets to use the bathrooms and what we've decided is the mob does it that's the that's the progressive political views the mob gets to decide who gets to use your property the other thing is exclusiveness because exclusive litmus is now considered a bad thing if it's a men's bathroom that means that it's not a woman's bathroom and if it's a woman's bathroom it means it's not a men's bathroom but some men think that they're women or very much want to be women or just are culturally influenced to dress up like women and so they want to use the women's bathroom but they can't use the women's bathroom because they're not women because they're men that became a major political fight Barack Obama fan those flames Donald Trump did not he said for the five people who are genuinely confused about your gender keep doing what you're doing for everyone else stop acting like a dummy it's this exclusiveness why well what you're saying I have to buy a product to use a space that's all that's exclusive some people don't have three dollars for a lot or her don't you know want to spend their $3 on a latte the correct answer to that is then you don't get to use the space because that's the price of entry but in the modern progressive democratic idea of things oh how dare you could never say that you could no women want to go to the men's room men want to go to the women's room probably more the latter Oh vagabonds want to use the bathroom at Starbucks and make it much worse for everybody because it'll just become a homeless camp no you have to do that how could you say no how could you say no and this brings us to the final point before I bring on our guest speaking of exclusiveness and nice things degrading themselves we got it I will just talk briefly about the Royal Wedding is Americans love the Royal Wedding got a lot of viewership in the u.s. especially women love the Royal Wedding they love it because we all like a fairy tale and women in particular like the story of a princess marrying Prince Charming this has always been true at all places in the world in all cultures forever and now we pretend to ourselves because of feminism that we're not allowed to like this anymore so Disney says no more princesses falling in love with princes they're gonna not you know that movie Moana doesn't even have a prince or some of the love stories are about sisterly love now or motherly love they try whatever they can to resist this traditional story and it happened at the Royal Wedding Road wedding it was really awful to watch I'm sorry to say I think I'm the only person who's actually saying this I bet a lot of people thought it though which is you're interesting George's Chapel you're in the aristocracy you're in the monarchy and it opens up on Benny King's stand by me stand by me at the Royal Wedding and it's not that I don't like stand by me that's a nice song I also like Van Morrison and and David Bowie but I don't think that David Bowie should be played at a royal wedding you know I think maybe you opened up with oh Jesus we adore there some Anglican him you know so they had that aspect then a woman who Megan Mark 'old the new Duchess of Sussex who was who walked down the aisle and married another man seven years ago till death do us part that till death do us part turned out to be till two years from now to his part so five years ago she was married to another man and yet she walked down in white I don't begrudge her her divorce when you get married in a church that was found by the most famous divorcee in all of history Henry the eighth that doesn't get to be a big issue but even that the force of it to walk down as though it just punctures some of the magic of the fairy tale then when they walked out it the song that was playing was edit James this little light of mine again a lovely song not appropriate for the English monarchy for this high church wedding they walked out of there megan has a website now in the royal page that says she's proud to be a feminist oh gosh this that the monarchy wants to modernize that's what all of the mainstream media are reporting how good it is that we have a modern monarchy nobody wants a modern monarchy if you modernize the monarchy you don't make it better you just destroy the monarchy because the monarchy is aristocracy aristocracy comes from aristos which is Greek for the best right is the best it's supposed to elevate you it's not supposed to reflect the people that's democracy demos the people democracy reflects the people the spirit of the age Aristo s represents the virtues and the best the monarchy is supposed to be something to look up to to elevate the people if you modernize it and make it reflective of the people you don't get a better monarchy you just get another democracy and it's cheap and it's weird and it's not a fairy tale Disney is doing it the British royal family is doing it both of them should stop it's very frustrating we've got to get to this day in history and our wonderful guests before we get to that I've got a second bite of Facebook in YouTube we got a really good yesterday we're gonna hear about some incredible stories escaping Nazi occupied France during World War two but if you are on Facebook or YouTube you got to go to daily wire.com right now why well it's ten bucks a month 100 dollars for annual membership you get me you get the underlayment show you get the Ben Shapiro show you can't ask questions in the mailbag everybody can listen to the mailbag questions but only subscribers can ask them many are called few were chosen you get to ask questions in conversation everybody can watch but only subscribers get to ask the questions next one up is the big boss ben shapiro who's away right now i talked a little bit more about the royal wedding on Drew's show today which became the ben shapiro radio show and i'm sure that will be hilarious when Ben comes back in a fury that I was on his show while he was gone that's a story for another time go to tell me why you're calm we'll be right back with this day in history and you can return with your leftist here's tumbler yum-yum-yum on this day in history a lot of things happen in World War two in 1940 a special unit in Germany carried out a mission and murdered more than 1500 hospital patients in Prussia this was an attack to kill the unfit those people deemed unfit by the scientifically barbaric German government and Nazi government by the way that special unit reported back to headquarters in Berlin that the patients had been successfully evacuated I suppose they were successfully evacuated to their eternal reward but they were murdered in cold blood on earth in 1942 on this day in history 4,300 Jews were deported from a Polish town to a Nazi camp at Sobibor and all were gassed to death that camp had five gas chambers quarter of a million Jews were killed there between 1942 and 1943 the German firm IG Farben set up factory outside of Auschwitz and on this day in history 1940 the French ninth army surrendered this you might know I'm waving the flag of the French army right now as a matter of fact the French army surrendered itself as a nation France would surrender within the month we're lucky enough today to be joined by Carol Engel Everett the author alongside of world war ii veteran captain george starks of coffin corner boys one bomber ten men and their harrowing escape from nazi-occupied France it is a wonderful read Carol thank you for being here well thank you for having me Michael Carol so this book for just to give a little overview of it the book tracts 20 year old George Starks on a 300 mile trek to Switzerland he's got a fractured foot there he'd been shot down over Nazi occupied France he's got a 20 millimeter shell fragment in his thigh he comes face to face with Nazis he's barely evades capture and yet these days 20 year olds suffer nervous breakdowns when their parents forget to upgrade their iPhone data plans how responsible do you think in your research for this book the war was for shaping what we now call the greatest generation well that's how you raised some interesting questions there because really George was 19 when he first got his pilot's wings so even younger than 20 the average age on that crew was 22 there was one of them that was 27 and did the rest of them he was ancient so they called him the old man pops our Pappy and it was an amazing thing really because George has often told me all ten of them were from very different backgrounds religious backgrounds different socioeconomic family situations educational backgrounds different but they all had one thing in common they were all Patriots and they all wanted to go to war to protect America and so it's a it's an interesting thing and in fact last week somebody asked me you know Carroll to whom did you write this book well obviously people who enjoy reading about great heroes and World War two and all but I have seven grandchildren and I actually wrote the book for them because if we don't get these stories down and recorded we're going to lose them and I want my young grandchildren I look too young right now to read it but I want them to know what these men really did well I love that point I'm sorry go ahead well I just said you know really they were boys we call them men but but they were really boys when they got started of course unfortunately through the through the war they they grew up very quickly so well it's the stories aspect that I really like is there the stories in this book are incredible and my grandfather was a navigator on a b24 he bombed a lot of Nazis of war and so I grew up as a kid I grew up hearing these stories and kids today they don't hear these stories they'll uh I don't know what they hear you know a lot of these veterans are going up to their eternal reward at a faster clip so the the people who live through it are leaving the earth do you think there's a risk here that these narratives are going to be lost to history obviously there aren't a whole lot of out like yours there certainly aren't enough how much are we going to remember in 50 or 100 years well and you know we we need to get as many recorded as we can I'm doing my part trying to trying to get them down this um this one book does have 10 stories each of the crew and what happened to them after they were shot down of course now George Starks the pilot is the primary person in the book because he goes he returns to Europe and later and retraces his steps and that's a wonderful part of that story but George is still living he's 94 and I has turned into a dear friend it took us about three years to research the book and for me to interview him but you know he'll be 95 in November and only one other of the crew had been alive when I started this book and that was and actually the only Jewish member of that crew Irv Baum and he unfortunately passed away about eight or nine months ago but I was so privileged and thankful that I was able to interview him too before he did before he did pass away so well and you know on this point there were these multiple faith backgrounds people were virtual I suppose Christian and George says at one point in the book I need help god I can't do this by myself they say there are no atheists in the foxholes and broadly in the culture we see that religion is declining and younger generations appear to be much less religious than older generations do you think it's this the suffering of war trampling through France surrounded by Nazis with a broken foot that brings out people's need for God do you think that was the defining feature well I think anytime a person comes face to face with their mortality in a situation where their life is actually going to be on the line and might could end at any moment I think that in and of itself produces sort of a landscape for thinking about what may be eternal and what might not be eternal and George certainly as he was going along reached that place that point where he was at the end of his Road in human terms and so what he did then was turned to at that moment what he felt might be a higher power that could possibly help him and that's what he did there's a incredible scene in the book where he it really literally thinks that he just cannot go on and he has been without food for a number of days he's been wet and cold and you know he's up in in snow country and he he just calls out he says God you know I I can't do this on my own I you're gonna have to help me so and speaking of speaking of that higher power and perhaps forgiving your enemies and loving your neighbor we see in his later life captain storks and his wife Betty Joe they go back to France after the war they find the civilians who risked their own lives to save his life and broadly speaking the United States makes friends with our enemies after Wars this is a habit of ours we have a special relationship with Great Britain although we fought two wars with them right at the beginning Germany Japan Vietnam on a Korea on and on maybe North Korea soon depending on how this meeting goes next month yes so I want to know what insight did you gather from working with Captain Starks on dealing with your former foes deal at you know burying hatchets this guy's lived an incredible life he's seen the world change dramatically what that says for us individually and what it says for US policy well you know really when he returned to France these were the people that had helped him and actually most of the people that he ran into did help him but he it took him a long time to hook up this is the this is the interesting part it took him a long time to hook up with the actual organized underground or resistance so from day one the people that helped him were just normal average everyday Frenchman went men men women and children they were not part of an organized resistance they just simply knew that you know they disliked the Germans for coming in and what they were doing to their country and they wanted to do what they could with any American soldier or ally you know that they ran into so to me that was the most incredible thing because these people had everything to lose for example the the woman that he stayed with the very first night okay she had a little girl who was eight or nine years old her husband at that time was a peel w polish POWs with the Germans and had she been caught there is no question but what she would have been executed and probably her daughter as well at the very least sent to a concentration camp I mean when they caught as I think you write in the book when they caught people who were housing runaway American soldiers they men women and children they'd pull him out and they'd shoot them in the head right exactly so so when when George was shot down and after and in this 300 mile trek to freedom in Switzerland he vowed two things to himself number one that if he ever if he made it if he lived through the experience and got back to the States he would never lose touch with his crew again as long as he lived the second vow that he made to himself was that at some some point one day if he could he would go back to France and try to locate all those brave souls that had helped him and helped his men and he live to do both of those things it's an amazing story it's a really amazing story and the book achieved something which i think is really in credible it really almost makes you like the French I hate I don't know that I could even say it on the ship but it really does I apologize for my French army flag joke the book is coffin corner boys it's by Carol Engle ever yet alongside Captain George Starks it's a really engrossing read a really
