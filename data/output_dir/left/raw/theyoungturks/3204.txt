1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,890
>>THE DAILY BEAST SPOKE TO
SEVERAL WOMEN IN ALABAMA WHO ARE

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,590
NOW CAMPAIGNING ON THE
DEMOCRATIC SIDE EVEN THOUGH THEY

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,000
HAVE HAD A LIFETIME OF VOTING
FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,190
THEIR STATE.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,000
THIS HAS BEEN A
REACTION TO SEXUAL ASSAULT AND

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,840
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS
TOWARD ROY MOORE, THE SENATE

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,570
CANDIDATE LOOKING TO FILL JEFF
SESSIONS'S SEAT.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,580
AND REALLY

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,960
INTERESTING COMMENTS COMING FROM
SOME OF THESE WOMEN, ONE OF THEM

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,790
IS WALTON FOSTER --

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:01:16,600
>>HERE IS ONE OF HER QUOTES,
SHE SAYS --

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,950
>>A COUPLE WOMEN TALKING TO THE
DAILY BEAST DOESN'T SAY

13
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,950
ANYTHING, THOSE ARE ANECDOTES,
BUT WHAT ARE WE NOTICING IN THE

14
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,950
POLLS?

15
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,109
WELL, THERE WAS A FOX
NEWS POLL DONE, FOX NEWS IS BY

16
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:33,520
NO MEANS A LIBERAL ORGANIZATION,
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,000
DOUG JONES IS ACTUALLY LEADING
--

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:52,560
>>HERE WAS THE MOST INTERESTING
OUTCOME OF THAT FOX NEWS POLL.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,109
THEY DIVVIED UP THE FEMALE
VOTERS BASED ON AGE AND FOUND

20
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:00,990
THAT YOUNG VOTERS
DISPROPORTIONATELY FAVORED DOUG

21
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,119
JONES OVER ROY MOORE --

22
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:13,989
>>THE YOUNG, EVEN IN ALABAMA,
ARE ON OUR SIDE.

23
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:14,989
AND A LOT OF

24
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:19,480
THE OLDER MALES IN ALABAMA, AND
THEY LITERALLY KEEP SAYING, WE

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,670
HAVE COVERED A NUMBER OF
POLITICIANS IN ALABAMA, SAYING

26
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,040
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,379
EVEN IF HE
DIDN'T DO IT, SOME OF THOSE

28
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:30,440
GIRLS LOOKED REALLY PRETTY.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,319
UGH.

30
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,239
WHICH 18-YEAR-OLD OR 25-YEAR-OLD

31
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,830
WOMAN, I DON'T CARE WHAT PARTY
YOU ARE IN OR WHERE YOU LIVE,

32
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,709
WILL SAY I THINK A 30-YEAR-OLD
MOLESTING A 14-YEAR-OLD IS FINE.

33
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,469
THEY WANT SAY THAT.

34
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:49,719
ON THE OTHER
HAND THEY HATE LIBERALS, THE

35
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,129
ALABAMA REPUBLICANS.

36
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,620
AND LET ME
BE CLEAR ON THIS, I GET THAT YOU

37
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,690
ARE IN A CONUNDRUM IF YOU ARE IN
THAT CATEGORY.

38
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,690
I ALWAYS DO THE

39
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,959
SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT.

40
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,159
WHAT I
WANT TO VOTE FOR TED CRUZ?

41
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,159
UNDER

42
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,159
NO CIRCUMSTANCES.

43
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,470
BUT IF HE'S
RUNNING AGAINST HARVEY

44
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,140
WEINSTEIN, AND WEINSTEIN IS A
PURPORTED LIBERAL, THERE'S NO

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,160
WAY IN THE WORLD I WILL VOTE FOR
HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
I WON'T GO

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,659
INTO A VOTING BOOTH AND MAKE
HARVEY WEINSTEIN A SENATOR.

48
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,260
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES.

49
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,840
EVEN IF
HE'S RUNNING AGAINST THE MOST

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,329
LOATHSOME REPUBLICAN, TED CRUZ.

51
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,019
SO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ACTIVELY

52
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:33,959
GO INTO VOTE FOR ROY MOORE --
I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT WOMEN

53
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,030
UNDER 45, NO MATTER WHAT PARTY
THEY BELONG TO, CAN'T STOMACH

54
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,610
THAT.

55
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,969
THAT'S THE CORRECT ANSWER.

56
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:44,700
>>AND IT'S CRAZY HOW TRIBAL
THINGS HAVE BECOME.

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
TO THE POINT

58
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,459
WHERE IN TRUMP'S HEAD OR IN SOME
REPUBLICANS' MINDS, VOTING FOR

59
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,040
DEMOCRATS IS WORSE THAN VOTING
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,030
BY NINE WOMEN OF MOLESTING THEM,
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING THEM, SOME

61
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,769
OF THEM WERE TEENAGERS AT THE
TIME.

62
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,560
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME,

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,120
THAT YOUR POLITICAL IDENTITY IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,860
LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED LIKE THIS.

65
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,390
>>ONE LAST THING, ESPECIALLY IN
A SITUATION WHERE PART OF YOUR

66
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,810
POLITICAL IDENTITY IS BASED ON
FAMILY VALUES --

67
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,510
>>COME ON.

68
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,721
>>WHEN YOUR POLITICAL IDENTITY
IS BASED ON FAMILY VALUES AND

69
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,030
THIS GUY HAS SHREDDED FAMILY
VALUES, FOR YOU TO TURN AROUND

70
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,320
AND GO, I STILL DON'T CARE -- AT
LEAST BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,130
AND ADMIT THAT YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT FAMILY VALUES, YOU'VE JUST

72
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,070
BECOME PART OF A TEAM, A CULT
ALMOST, AND YOU WILL VOTE FOR

73
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,540
THAT PERSON UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES.

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,540
WE GET A LOT OF

75
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,010
HEAT BECAUSE WE WALKED BACK
DEMOCRATS UNILATERALLY UNDER ANY

76
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,410
CIRCUMSTANCES.

77
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,040
SOME DEMOCRATS
GET SERIOUS, WHY AREN'T YOU ON

78
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,250
OUR TEAM NO MATTER WHAT?

79
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,380
BECAUSE
I HAVE A BRAIN AND I'M ALLOWED

80
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,220
TO MAKE HUMAN JUDGMENTS ABOUT
WHETHER THIS PERSON ACTUALLY

81
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,940
REPRESENTS US OR NOT.

82
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,310
SO MAKE A
JUDGMENT IN ALABAMA, DOES ROY

83
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,730
MOORE REPRESENT YOU?

84
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,600
IF HE DOES,
THEN VOTE FOR HIM, I FEEL

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,110
TERRIBLE FOR YOU, BUT GO AHEAD.

86
00:05:07,110 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES
OF YOUR DECISION.
