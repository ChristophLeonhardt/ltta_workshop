This is satellite imagery
of a practice area
for military parades
in Pyongyang, North Korea.
The show of force from
the country’s dictatorship
is nothing new.
But this particular
parade happens to come
just one day before the
Olympic opening ceremonies
in neighboring South Korea.
North Korea knows
it’s being watched.
So whatever we’re seeing
is what the country
is O.K. with showing.
The official parade ground
is actually here,
in the city center.
There’s a large
permanent viewing stand
for the country’s leadership.
This is what past parades
at this location
have looked like
from the ground.
The nearby practice area is
actually a replica of the official site,
and even has a viewing stand.
Here we see
troop formations,
what appears to be
a military band
and columns
of military vehicles.
Joseph Bermudez, an analyst
writing for Johns Hopkins's
38 North website, thinks
there might actually
be 13,000 troops
practicing in these images.
What we don’t see are the
latest missile launchers.
Analysts suspect
they might actually
be stored here, in this
nearby camouflaged facility.
These ground marks
may be tracks created
by heavy military vehicles
kept in these shelters.
Some parade activities are
practiced back in the city center.
This shot shows an image
of an empty square.
Here is the same square the
day after, with scores of people
holding red pompoms that
spell out a slogan saying,
“One against 100.”
It’s a message to
its citizens, but also
to those watching from above,
that North Korea sees itself
as a nation constantly under
threat from the outside world.
