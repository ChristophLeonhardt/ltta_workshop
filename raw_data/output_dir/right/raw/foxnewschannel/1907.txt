1
00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:03,114
COMES AS PREPARES FOR SUMMIT

2
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:03,781
WITH KIM JONG UN AND THAT

3
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:06,717
HAPPENS IN JUNE NEXT MONTH.

4
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:07,652
BRIAN: LET’S BRING IN TED

5
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:08,619
CRUZ LOOKING TO KEEP THAT

6
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,154
SEAT FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS.

7
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:11,589
HAS HIS HANDSFUL IN TEXAS

8
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:13,291
BUT A BIG STUDENT OF WHAT’S

9
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,158
HANG INTERNATIONALLY.

10
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:15,993
SENATOR, WHAT IS YOUR

11
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:17,361
TAKE -- I’M SURE YOU WEREN’T

12
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,529
UP AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

13
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:19,964
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AT WHAT

14
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:20,798
HAS TAKEN PLACE SO FAR?

15
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:22,100
>> WELL, IT’S A BIG DEAL.

16
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,469
THE PRESIDENT IS TO BE

17
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,803
COMMENDED FOR BRINGING THESE

18
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:26,537
THREE AMERICANS HOME.

19
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:27,939
THAT IS A MAJOR VICTORY.

20
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:30,408
IT’S REALLY THE RESULTS OF

21
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:31,142
AMERICAN STRENGTH.

22
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:33,811
YOU KNOW, WE SAW FOR 8 YEARS

23
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:35,146
UNDER BARACK OBAMA A FOREIGN

24
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:36,414
POLICY THAT WAS REALLY A

25
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:38,650
POLICY OF WEAKNESS AND

26
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,084
APPEASEMENT.

27
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:40,952
REMEMBER HOW OBAMA PUT IT,

28
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:41,653
LEADING FROM BEHIND.

29
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:43,588
THE PROBLEM IS WEAKNESS AND

30
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:44,789
APPEASEMENT DOESN’T WORK.

31
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,558
ESPECIALLY WITH DICTATORS

32
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:47,659
LIKE KIM JONG UN.

33
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,661
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS COME IN

34
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,762
WITH A STRONG AMERICAN

35
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:53,365
FOREIGN POLICY, GETTING BACK

36
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:54,432
TO PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.

37
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:55,534
I THINK WE ARE SEEING THE

38
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:56,835
RESULTS OF IT WITH THREE

39
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,036
AMERICANS COMING HOME.

40
00:00:58,036 --> 00:00:59,271
STEVE: YOU KNOW WHAT’S

41
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,038
INTERESTING, SENATOR, I WAS

42
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:00,672
CLICKING AROUND YESTERDAY

43
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,640
WITH THE BIG NEWS THAT THEY

44
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,108
WERE COMING BACK TO THE

45
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:03,542
UNITED STATES.

46
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:05,343
AND THE MAJORITY OF THE NEWS

47
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:06,111
COVERAGE ON THE OTHER

48
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:07,980
CHANNELS WAS ABOUT STORMY

49
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,313
DANIELS.

50
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:09,615
WHAT’S THE HECK IS UP WITH

51
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:09,915
THAT?

52
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:11,650
>> MOST OF THE MEDIA -- THEY

53
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,152
ARE JUST OUT OF THEIR MIND.

54
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:15,888
THEY HAVE WHAT I CALL TRUMP

55
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:17,356
DERANGEMENT SYNDROME WHERE

56
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:18,591
ALL THEY CAN DO IS ATTACK

57
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:19,992
THE PRESIDENT ALL DAY LONG

58
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:20,726
ON THE SCANDAL OF THE DAY.

59
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:21,994
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU I

60
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,329
THINK MOST TEXANS ARE REALLY

61
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:23,896
TIRED OF IT.

62
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:25,497
WHEN I GO HOME NOBODY ASKS

63
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:26,498
ABOUT THE LATEST SCANDAL OF

64
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:27,533
THE DAY AND WHATEVER THE

65
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,534
TALKING HEADS ARE LIGHTING

66
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:29,835
THEIR HAIR ON FIRE ABOUT.

67
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:32,471
PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT TAX

68
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:32,771
CUTS.

69
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,206
ABOUT REGULATIONS BEING

70
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:34,540
LIFTED.

71
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,108
ABOUT JOBS GROWING.

72
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,176
I WILL TELL WHAT YOU PEOPLE

73
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:38,110
ARE EXCITED ABOUT, FOR

74
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,445
EXAMPLE, IS YESTERDAY AT THE

75
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:40,780
WHITE HOUSE I WAS THERE.

76
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,981
THE PRESIDENT MADE A

77
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:44,116
DECISION THAT SAVED

78
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:44,617
THOUSANDS OF JOBS.

79
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:48,921
HE STEPPED IN AND SOLVED THE

80
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:51,190
BROKEN REN SYSTEM.

81
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,892
SOMETHING THE E.P.A.

82
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,827
INVENTED TO ENFORCE THE

83
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:55,428
ETHANOL MANDATE.

84
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:59,132
WHAT HAPPENED WAS RENN

85
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:00,933
SKYROCKETED AND THEY WERE

86
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,468
THREATENING THE JOBS

87
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:04,103
THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF

88
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,372
BLUE CAR UNION MAKERS AT

89
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:08,174
REFINERIES IN TEXAS AND

90
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:09,208
REFINERIES IN PENNSYLVANIA.

91
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,342
I HAVE BEEN FOR SIX MONTHS

92
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:10,977
WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT

93
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,645
AND WORK WITH OTHER

94
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:13,112
SENATORS.

95
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:14,080
YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT

96
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,948
MADE A TERRIFIC DECISION.

97
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,249
HE STEPPED IN AND SAID THAT

98
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,851
WE’RE GOING TO ALLOW RENNES

99
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:19,753
TO BE CREATED WHEN ETHANOL

100
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:20,887
IS EXPORTED OF.

101
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:22,188
WHAT THAT MEANS WE ARE GOING

102
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:23,623
TO EXPORT A LOT MORE

103
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:24,090
ETHANOL.

104
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,825
THAT’S GOING TO HELP CORN

105
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:26,159
FARMERS.

106
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,394
WE WILL SELL MORE ETHANOL

107
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:29,930
AND ALSO ALLOW E-15 TO BE

108
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,664
SOLD YEAR AROUND.

109
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:32,899
IT’S A BIG WIN FOR CORN

110
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:39,239
FARMERS BUT CRITICALLY THE

111
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,207
PRESIDENT SAVED THE JOBS OF

112
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:42,008
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BLUE

113
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:43,176
COLLAR UNION MEMBERS,

114
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:44,077
REFINERY WORKERS.

115
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,479
EXACTLY THE PEOPLE WHO

116
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,280
ELECTED DONALD TRUMP INSTEAD

117
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,813
OF HILLARY CLINTON.

118
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,750
IT WAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT

119
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,183
DECISION.

120
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:51,952
AINSLEY: SENATOR JOBS CHECK.

121
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:53,520
ETHANOL MANDATE CHECK.

122
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,388
PRIMPS HOME CHECK.

123
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:55,656
THE SUMMIT NOW SET AND THE

124
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:56,123
IRAN DEAL.

125
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:57,191
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

126
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:57,724
THAT?

127
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:58,859
>> WELL, ONCE AGAIN, I THINK

128
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,528
THE PRESIDENT DID EXACTLY

129
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:02,696
THE RIGHT THING TO PULL OUT

130
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,264
OF THE IRAN DEAL FOR THE

131
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:04,932
LAST YEAR AND A HALF I HAVE

132
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:05,499
BEEN TALKING WITH THE

133
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:06,433
PRESIDENT, URGING HIM TO

134
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,501
TAKE THIS COURSE.

135
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,336
I THINK THE PRESIDENT

136
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,171
HASTEDTLY BEEN ON THIS PATH.

137
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,773
THE IRAN DEAL THAT PRESIDENT

138
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:14,675
OBAMA NEGOTIATED WAS

139
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:15,109
CATASTROPHIC.

140
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:17,111
IT DID ENORMOUS DAMAGE TO

141
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,713
AMERICA BECAUSE IT ALLOWED

142
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:20,681
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO GO

143
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,083
DIRECTLY TO THE WORLD’S

144
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,551
LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF

145
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:23,918
TERRORISM.

146
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:26,087
AND EVEN WORSE THAN THAT, IT

147
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:28,489
DID SO IN A WAY THAT ENSURED

148
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,057
IRAN WOULD GET NUCLEAR

149
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:30,391
WEAPONS.

150
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,960
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE AYATOLLAH

151
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,195
KHOMEINI PLEDGES DEATH TO

152
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,097
AMERICA AND DEATH TO ISRAEL,

153
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:36,898
I BELIEVE HIM.

154
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:39,567
HE IS A RELIGIOUS RADICAL

155
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,701
ZEALOT AND CANCELING THE

156
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:41,769
DEAL IS THE EXACTLY THE

157
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:42,937
RIGHT THING WHAT WE NEED TO

158
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,038
DO AND WHAT WE ARE GOING

159
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:45,773
FORWARD DOING IS REIMPOSING

160
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,041
CRUSHING SANCTIONS, URGING

161
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,543
OUR ALLIES TO DO THE SAME

162
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:50,778
AND MAKING SURE THAT IRAN

163
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:51,946
NEVER NEVER NEVER GETS A

164
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:53,748
NUCLEAR WEAPON.

165
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:54,449
BRIAN: SENATOR, YOU KNOW HOW

166
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:55,850
THEY FEEL THEY MADE IT

167
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,151
CLEAR.

168
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,786
THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF

169
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:59,154
ENGLAND AND MACRON SPENT TWO

170
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:00,655
DAYS HERE AND MERKEL SPENT A

171
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:01,690
DAY ALL TO KEEP US IN.

172
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,191
IN FACT, SHE RELEASED THIS

173
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:03,558
STATEMENT.

174
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:05,594
IT IS NO LONGER SUCH THAT

175
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:06,528
THE UNITED STATES SIMPLY

176
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,295
PROTECTS US.

177
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:08,997
BUT EUROPE MUST TAKE ITS

178
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,365
DESTINY IN ITS OWN HANDS.

179
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:12,100
THAT’S THE TASK OF THE

180
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,434
FUTURE.

181
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:13,702
YOUR REACTION?

182
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,070
>> LISTEN, WE’RE GOING TO

183
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,105
SEE SOME POSTURING IN

184
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,305
EUROPEAN CAPITALS.

185
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,007
THE REASON IS THERE IS SOME

186
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,276
BIG EUROPEAN COMPANIES WANT

187
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:22,310
TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN.

188
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,045
THEY MAKE MONEY.

189
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,379
THAT’S GOT A LOT OF THE

190
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,314
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DEFENDING

191
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:26,014
THIS DEAL.

192
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:27,049
I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN THE

193
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,184
DEAL WAS BEING NEGOTIATED, I

194
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,253
HAD EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS IN

195
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:33,088
MY OFFICE ASKING FOR MY HELP

196
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:34,256
SAYING THE OBAMA

197
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:35,190
ADMINISTRATION IS PRESSURING

198
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,457
US.

199
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:37,159
WE THINK THIS IS A FOOLISH

200
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,459
DEAL.

201
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,228
WILL YOU HELP US PRESS BACK?

202
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:40,863
SO, LOOK, NO ONE SHOULD BE

203
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,697
SURPRISED THAT THEIR

204
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:42,765
COMPANIES ARE INTERESTED IN

205
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:43,132
MONEY.

206
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:43,732
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

207
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:45,334
WE HAVE A BIGGER

208
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:45,801
RESPONSIBILITY.

209
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,436
THE AYATOLLAH WITH A NUCLEAR

210
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:49,038
WEAPON, IF HE EVER ACQUIRE

211
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,239
AS NUCLEAR WEAPON, I THINK

212
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,541
THE ODDS ARE UNACCEPTABLY

213
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,042
HIGH.

214
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,643
HE WOULD DETONATE THAT

215
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:55,711
WEAPON IN THE SKIES OF TEL

216
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:56,745
AVIV OR NEW YORK OR LOS

217
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:57,079
ANGELES.

218
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,515
WE CAN’T ROLL THE DICE.

219
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:00,082
BRIAN: IF GERMANY WAS

220
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:01,751
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR OWN

221
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,084
DESTINY.

222
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:03,452
MAYBE THEY WOULDN’T ACCEPT A

223
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:04,286
PIPELINE FROM RUSSIA THAT

224
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:07,023
KEEPS THEM ON THE RUSSIAN

225
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:08,124
NATURAL GAS CRACK PIPE

226
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:09,859
FOREVER WHEN WE COULD SUPPLY

227
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:10,192
IT.

228
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:11,861
STEVE: SENATOR CRUZ, LET ME

229
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:12,295
ASK YOU THIS.

230
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,329
THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOW

231
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,997
SENDING TO CORRECT ME IF I

232
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:18,601
CONGRESS A 15BILLION-DOLLAR RESN

233
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:18,935
PACKAGE.

234
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:25,675
IT’S BEEN OVER A MONTH AGO

235
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:30,847
PALOOZA $1.3 BILLION.

236
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,882
I KNOW YOU GOT A LOT OF

237
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:33,683
FUNDING FROM THE MILITARY.

238
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:34,851
NOW HOW ARE YOU TRYING TO

239
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:35,518
CLAW IT BACK?

240
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:36,286
>> YES.

241
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:37,454
WELL, I HAVE BEEN, THE

242
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:38,888
OMNIBUS WAS A SERIOUS

243
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:39,222
MISTAKE.

244
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,024
I VOTED AGAINST THAT 1.3

245
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:44,527
BILLION-DOLLAR SPENDING

246
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:44,928
PACKAGE.

247
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,395
STEVE: TRILLION.

248
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:46,730
>> NOW YOU GOT ME DOING IT.

249
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,597
STEVE: I DID IT, TOO.

250
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,199
>> IT WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE

251
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,367
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

252
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,202
RIGHT TO SEND A RESCISSION

253
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,937
THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE OF

254
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,372
RESCISSION IS THE DEMOCRATS

255
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,573
CAN’T FILIBUSTER IT.

256
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:57,207
IT’S A PROCEDURAL VEHICLE

257
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,409
THAT ONLY TAKES 50 VOTES.

258
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,177
IF REPUBLICANS JUST STAND

259
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:01,345
TOGETHER WE CAN CLAW BACK

260
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,180
SOME OF THAT SPENDING AND

261
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,648
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE

262
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:05,682
BEEN URGING REPUBLICANS IN

263
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:08,318
THE SENATE, WE HAVE A NARROW

264
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,052
51 VOTE MAJORITY.

265
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,254
OF THE DEMOCRATS ARE

266
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:11,188
FILIBUSTERING EVERYTHING.

267
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:14,024
WE NEED TO BE USING ALL OF

268
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:15,692
THE PROCEDURAL TOOLS WE HAVE

269
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,895
TO PASS THINGS WITH 51 VOTES

270
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,197
TO GET VICTORY AFTER VICTORY

271
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,031
AFTER VICTORY FOR THE

272
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,466
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REIGNING

273
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,535
IN WASTEFUL SPENDING IS

274
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:25,302
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE OUGHT

275
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,338
TO BE DOING.

276
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:28,239
APPLAUD THE WHITE HOUSE FOR

277
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,074
DOING THAT.

278
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:30,741
BRIAN: SARAH JESSICA PARKER

279
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,742
GOING AFTER YOUR OPPONENT IN

280
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:32,443
THE SENATE RACE.

281
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:33,344
CAN YOU STILL WIN?

282
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:34,745
>> SHE JOINS ROSIE O’DONNELL

283
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:36,614
AND AL FRANKEN AND CHELSEA

284
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,115
HANDLER AND I GOT TO SAY.

285
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:40,851
IF THIS ELECTION WERE IN

286
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,286
HOLLYWOOD, I WOULD HAVE LOST

287
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:44,422
ALREADY.

288
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:46,023
BUT, FORTUNATELY HOLLYWOOD

289
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:47,058
CELEBRITIES DON’T TEND TO

290
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,660
VOTE A WHOLE LOT IN TEXAS

291
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,094
ELECTIONS.

292
00:06:50,094 --> 00:06:51,162
LISTEN, I HAVE GOT AN

293
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,230
OPPONENT WHO IS RUNNING HARD

294
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,530
LEFT.

295
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,931
IS HE RUNNING ON GUN

296
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,265
CONTROL.

297
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:55,366
IS HE RUNNING ON OPEN

298
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:55,700
BORDERS.

299
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,368
IS HE RUNNING ON IMPEACHING

300
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:57,902
THE PRESIDENT.

301
00:06:57,902 --> 00:06:59,270
HE IS THE FIRST DEMOCRAT

302
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,971
SENATE CANDIDATE IN THE

303
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:01,439
COUNTRY TO PLEDGE HE WOULD

304
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,140
IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP BUT I

305
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,708
HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, HE IS

306
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,543
RAISING MORE MONEY THAN ANY

307
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:06,411
DEMOCRAT IN THE ENTIRE

308
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:06,744
COUNTRY.

309
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:08,646
HE RAISED $7 MILLION LAST

310
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:11,316
QUARTER AND SO WHAT WE’RE

311
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,183
SAYING IS CONSERVATIVES IN

312
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,518
TEXAS AND ACROSS THE

313
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,552
COUNTRY, THEY ARE GOING TO

314
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:16,855
TED CRUZ.ORG AND WE ARE

315
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:17,889
STANDING TOGETHER.

316
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:19,024
WE’RE GOING TO WIN BECAUSE

317
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,058
THERE ARE MORE CONSERVATIVES

318
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:21,359
THAN THERE ARE LIBERALS IN

319
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:21,693
TEXAS.

320
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:23,261
BUT IT’S GOING TO TAKE

321
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:24,229
CONSERVATIVES SHOWING UP IN

322
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:25,930
NOVEMBER TO DEFEND OUR

323
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,331
FREEDOM.

324
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:26,831
STEVE: ALL RIGHT.

325
00:07:26,831 --> 00:00:00,000
SENATOR TED CRUZ.ORG.
