1
00:00:01,016 --> 00:00:01,715
WORLD LIKE YOU DID TWO YEARS

2
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:03,150
AGO.

3
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:04,885
YOU HAVE TO GO VOTE.

4
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:06,520
JOINING WITH US REACTION FORMER

5
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:07,688
CLINTON POLLSTER, MARK PENN.

6
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,323
THE AUTHOR OF THE "NEW YORK

7
00:00:09,324 --> 00:00:11,825
TIMES" BEST SELLER "JESUS IS

8
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:13,427
RISEN" DAVID LIMBAUGH, DAVID HAS

9
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:14,228
DONE LEGAL WORK FOR ME IN THE

10
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:15,529
PAST.

11
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,831
YOU HAVE ALSO, I'VE NEVER BEEN A

12
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:18,799
GREAT CHRISTIAN THAT YOU ARE,

13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,833
YOUR BOOKS HAVE MADE ME A BETTER

14
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:20,834
PERSON.

15
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:22,936
LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY.

16
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:23,504
VERY INFORMATIVE.

17
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:26,440
>> THANK YOU.

18
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:27,574
>> Sean: WE KNOW THEIR AGENDA,

19
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:28,409
WE SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE OPENLY

20
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,677
LYING.

21
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:30,577
I DON'T SEE AN AGENDA FROM THE

22
00:00:30,578 --> 00:00:31,912
DEMOCRATS AT ALL.

23
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:33,047
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO TO

24
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:34,248
MAKE THE COUNTRY BETTER TO HELP

25
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,383
THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY?

26
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:39,186
>> THEY UTTERLY HAVE NO AGENDA.

27
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:41,322
SO THEY PIT AMERICANS AGAINST

28
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:41,789
OTHER AMERICANS.

29
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,223
BLACK AGAINST WHITE, WOMEN

30
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:44,792
AGAINST MEN, RICH AGAINST POOR.

31
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:47,061
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO OUTRAGED

32
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:49,063
ABOUT KANYE, HE IS FINALLY

33
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:50,431
COMING OUT AND STRAYING FROM THE

34
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,132
DEMOCRAT PLANTATION.

35
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,201
ONLY DEMOCRATS -- ONLY BLACKS

36
00:00:54,202 --> 00:00:55,369
WHO SUPPORT THE LIBERAL CAUSE

37
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,804
CAN READ.

38
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,205
WE ARE TO ASSUME, THINK ABOUT

39
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:01,175
WHAT THESE PEOPLE ON MSNBC WERE

40
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:02,576
SAYING, KANYE CAN'T READ BECAUSE

41
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:05,913
HE SUPPORTS CONSERVATIVES.

42
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:09,116
THAT MEANS, BLACKS WHO SUPPORT

43
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:09,850
POLICIES THAT WILL HELP THEM,

44
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,251
DON'T READ.

45
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:13,087
IT'S JUST AMAZING.

46
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:13,887
THEY HAVE NO SUBSTANTIVE

47
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,056
POLICIES THAT WORK.

48
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:17,825
>> Sean: I KNOW YOU WORKED FOR

49
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:19,093
THE CLINTONS BUT YOU'RE A

50
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:20,661
POLLSTER.

51
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:23,163
BOTTOM LINE AS AN AMERICAN, I

52
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:24,398
WANT EVERY AMERICAN TO HAVE THE

53
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:25,933
AMERICAN DREAM.

54
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:28,702
NICE HOUSE, SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD,

55
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:31,205
DECENT CAR, TAKE THEIR KIDS TO

56
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:32,439
DISNEY, GO OUT TO EAT ONCE EVERY

57
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,807
WEEK OR EVERY OTHER WEEK, NOT

58
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:35,075
HAVE TO WORRY, SAVE A LITTLE FOR

59
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:36,443
RETIREMENT.

60
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,046
THAT IS ACHIEVABLE.

61
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,080
BUT UNDER BARACK OBAMA, WE

62
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:42,249
WEREN'T WAY BACKWARDS.

63
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,117
DONALD TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE

64
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:44,818
WORKING.

65
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:47,020
DO YOU THINK THIS IS AN

66
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:50,157
OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICANS TO

67
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:55,129
NOW BRING IN TO FOLD DEMOGRAPHIC

68
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,663
GROUPS THAT HAVEN'T VOTED

69
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:57,064
REPUBLICANS?

70
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:58,699
>> AS POLLSTER, DONALD TRUMP

71
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,568
SITS AT ABOUT 45% APPROVAL.

72
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,904
THAT'S BELOW THE 50% THAT A

73
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:04,905
PRESIDENT REALLY NEEDS DESPITE

74
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:06,106
THE GOOD ECONOMY.

75
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:07,941
SO THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

76
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:09,643
ISSUES, A LOT OF TERMS, A LOT OF

77
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:10,844
POSITIONS --

78
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,946
>> Sean: BUT HE'S ONLY A BIT

79
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:14,148
HIGHER THAN BARACK OBAMA AT THE

80
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:15,516
SAME TIME OF HIS PRESIDENCY.

81
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:16,583
>> THAT'S TRUE, BUT HE

82
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,051
STABILIZED HIS POLLING.

83
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,053
HASN'T GOTTEN ABOVE 50.

84
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:20,687
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN THE

85
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:21,722
AMERICAN DREAM TOO.

86
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:22,523
>> Sean: WHAT ARE THEY OFFERING

87
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:24,224
THIS ELECTION, WHAT ARE THEY

88
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:25,559
RUNNING ON EXCEPT HATE TRUMP,

89
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,628
OPEN BORDERS, KEEP OBAMA CARE

90
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:28,695
AND TAKE THE CRUMBS BACK.

91
00:02:28,696 --> 00:02:30,330
>> A LOT OF DEMOCRATS RUNNING ON

92
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,365
HEALTHCARE, A BELIEF THAT THE

93
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,867
REPUBLICANS --

94
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:34,768
>> Sean: OBAMACARE HEALTHCARE.

95
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,471
>> OBAMACARE HAS HAD A

96
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:38,605
RESURGENCE, FROM WHERE IT WAS.

97
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:40,407
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE SAYING REALLY

98
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:42,142
BAD THINGS, AND LOOK I DON'T

99
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,645
LIKE WHAT HILLARY SAID OR HOLDER

100
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:45,946
SAID BECAUSE I THINK THAT

101
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:47,648
MICHELLE OBAMA IS RIGHT,

102
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:49,016
DEMOCRATS HAVE TO STAY HIGH.

103
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:52,186
WHEN THEY DON'T STAY HIGH THEY

104
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:53,687
GIVE --

105
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:55,088
>> Sean: HER OWN HIS BAND SAID

106
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,090
GET INTO PEOPLE'S FACES, HE SAID

107
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,326
I'M GOING TO SEND MR. BURGESS TO

108
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:02,162
FOX NEWS AND TAKE ON SEAN

109
00:03:02,163 --> 00:03:04,298
HANNITY AND TEAR HIM UP.

110
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:05,766
>> WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT, HE WAS

111
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:07,367
MOVED OVER TO THE CENTER,

112
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:11,038
REACHED OUT TO THE OTHER SIDE,

113
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,040
FIND THE PLACE, I THINK

114
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:13,807
DEMOCRATS WOULD DO BET IF THEY

115
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:15,642
DID THAT TODAY.

116
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,110
>> Sean: 13 MILLION MORE

117
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,045
AMERICANS ON FOOD STAMPS, 8

118
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:21,381
MILLION IN POVERTY.

119
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:26,620
HE NEVER REACH 3% GDP.

120
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:27,821
RECORD GROWTH FOR EVERY

121
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:29,189
DEMOGRAPHIC, DAVID LIMBAUGH.

122
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,124
>> OBAMA DID NOT REACH OUT.

123
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,526
HE SAID GET IN THE BACK SEAT OF

124
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,561
THE CAR, WE DON'T WANT YOU TO

125
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:34,862
TALK.

126
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:40,367
HE WAS THE MOST DIVISIVE.

127
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:43,470
THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT, WITH ALL

128
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:44,605
DUE RESPECT TO MARK, I DO

129
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:46,974
RESPECT A LOT, I DON'T THINK THE

130
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,909
DEMOCRATIC PARTY STANDS FOR THE

131
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,412
AMERICAN DREAM, THEY STAND FOR

132
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:53,113
THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE, FOR

133
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:55,048
SOCIALISM.

134
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,885
WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS

135
00:03:57,886 --> 00:03:59,119
IMPOVERISHED AND ENSLAVED PEOPLE

136
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,688
AND LED TO TOTALITARIANISM.

137
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,323
AND THE LEFT IS TOTALITARIAN.

138
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:05,192
>> Sean: IT DOESN'T WALK.

139
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:07,127
OBAMA, OBAMACARE, MILLIONS LOST

140
00:04:07,128 --> 00:00:00,000
THEIR PLANS.
