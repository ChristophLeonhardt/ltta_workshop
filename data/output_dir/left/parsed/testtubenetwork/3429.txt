Yerevan, Armenia
Thousands of Armenians protest a price increase
by a Russian-owned electric company.
Protesters are enraged by corruption between
the Russian and Armenian governments.
The rally turned violent as Armenian police
attacked protesters with water cannons.
After over a week of protests, the Armenian
President suspended the price increase.
The Kremlin has expressed worry that these
protests may still initiate an Armenian revolution.
