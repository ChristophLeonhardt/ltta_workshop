1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
Male condoms come in all types of fun
shapes and sizes and flavors.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,480
Some even glow-in-the-dark.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,720
There are hundreds of male condoms that have been

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,100
approved by the FDA.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,799
Amazon alone has 76
pages full of different options, but how

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,300
many types of female condoms are
available in the US?

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,940
Turns out, just one.

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,850
A female condom is the only woman-initiated method of preventing unplanned

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,670
pregnancies and sexually transmitted
infections.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,109
It's a sheath with two rings, one open
one closed, that can be used for vaginal

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,380
or anal sex.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,079
Typically it's almost as effective as a

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,060
male condom and it can be inserted up to
eight hours before having sex.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,860
So, you don't have to stop in the heat of the
moment to fumble with a clumsy condom wrapper.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,210
Despite being effective and
convenient, only a small percent of women

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,200
in the US have reportedly ever even used
a female condom.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,140
Why aren't more women

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,260
using this thing?

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,720
We decided to find out.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,789
So I enlisted Dion to help me scour the

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:54,900
neighborhood to find one.

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,380
Can you just put a wig on and you can do it?

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,240
Do you guys have female condoms?

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,220
Do you guys have female condoms?

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,360
They don't have it.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,500
Even though we ended up getting brownie
snacks out of the whole thing, not a

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,200
single store that we went to sold female
condoms.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,580
I don't even have to leave my

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,680
office lobby to buy male condoms.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,869
After doing a little research I found out why

31
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,920
it was impossible to find a female condom.

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,980
It turns out you can't buy them in a store.

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,660
Well, that sucks.

34
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,440
Yep.

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,040
Veru Inc., formerly known as the

36
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,320
Female Health Company, is the only
company with a female condom on the

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
market in the US.

38
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,850
And they switched to a
prescription based system in 2017, so if

39
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,780
you want to get one you either have to
go see your doctor or buy it directly

40
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,740
from their website.

41
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,970
Imagine if a man
needed prescriptions to buy condoms.

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,380
Female condoms aren't new. A Danish
inventor created a prototype in the

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,720
early 1980s, in response to the AIDS
crisis at the time.

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,820
In 1993 the Female Health Company

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,420
brought the design to the US,

46
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,300
and their first FDA-approved version was
unimaginatively called the FC1.

47
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,500
It was made of polyurethane plastic, which was
less flexible than latex.

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,060
Some women

49
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,230
reported that it was uncomfortable, made
squeaky noises and, because there was

50
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,120
little awareness around proper use, it
sometimes fell out during sex.

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,980
The media also ridiculed it, comparing its
appearance to a jellyfish, a windsock, and

52
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:22,220
a plastic bag.

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,959
In 2009 the company came
up with a second version, the FC2, made

54
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,120
with a softer rubber.

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,280
It was more
comfortable and quieter, but it still

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
didn't take off.

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,870
Male condoms certainly
have been around for a lot longer and

58
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,400
are more accessible and people, frankly,
are much more comfortable with the

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,300
things that they know.

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,709
This is Dawn
Bingham, an ob-gyn and a fellow with

61
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,440
Physicians for Reproductive Health.

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,790
And I think that the female condom has not

63
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,760
grown in popularity as the male condom
has, because it's very easy to educate

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,940
people about male condoms.

65
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,170
You can let
the people know how to use a prop,

66
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,540
using a banana to show how simple it
is to put on a male condom and we don't

67
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,060
have the same accessible models for
female condom to make people that comfortable.

68
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,380
According to a report in the
Journal of Urban Health, the tampon had

69
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:17,540
similar challenges when it was first
introduced in the 1930s.

70
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,079
In the first

71
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:22,790
decade on the market, the tampon was only
used by 4 to 6% of women and doctors

72
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,520
questioned its safety and usefulness.

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,810
It took decades and carefully planned

74
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,120
marketing campaigns to reach even modest
popularity among women.

75
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,660
Female condoms

76
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,760
had a similar trajectory in Zimbabwe.

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,200
After health organizations campaigned for

78
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,099
the condom as a successful barrier
against HIV, the government introduced it

79
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,340
in 1997.

80
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,200
To boost popularity they were
marketed across universities,

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,100
pharmacies, and even hair salons.

82
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,959
Which eventually led to high usage rates and a

83
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,600
decline in HIV cases.

84
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,780
These kind of
contraceptive and STI prevention methods

85
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,579
are useful, because they empower the
woman or whoever the receptive partner

86
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:04,900
is to protect themselves.

87
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,600
And they're
simple to use.

88
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,489
But there still isn't

89
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:10,360
enough awareness around female condoms
in the US yet.

90
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,870
The FDA put the female condom in the
most strictly regulated category of

91
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,440
medical devices, which requires hundreds
of thousands of dollars of extra

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,140
research and takes a ton of time for
market approval.

93
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,339
But the FDA is now

94
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,888
considering reclassifying the female
condom and renaming it

95
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,300
the "single-use internal condom".

96
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,920
This would ease
restrictions on companies and let people

97
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,100
know they're actually not just for women.

98
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,610
Sure, male condoms work but that doesn't

99
00:04:33,610 --> 00:00:00,000
mean they should be the only accessible
choice for everyone.
