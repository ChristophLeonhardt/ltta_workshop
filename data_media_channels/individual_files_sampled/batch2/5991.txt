Trump has resisted switching out his Twitter phone on a monthly basis because he considers it inconvenient a man agreed you might say that's your irresponsible you might say that puts national security at risk and you might say that it's sort of like having an unsecured private email server a lot of people had a lot to say about unsecured private email servers what she did again is really unprecedented and incredibly reckless she's just gonna get away with this in the sense that she grossly Nick was Nick negligent she mishandled classified information and now she wants the commander-in-chief how can you be commander-in-chief when you are accepting classified and sensitive information on a private email server that you know the Russians and the Chinese and the North Koreans and others can spy on of course those folks weren't alone where's one more Republican who had something to say about the security of a certain email server her illegal server that put our national security at grave risk Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and gone to jail but what she wonderful we're gonna hear from any of those folks about for the United States using an unsecure phone line for tweeting our phone lines are open now warning unsecured hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you YouTube subscribe now
