yeah we were honored it was a great report no collusion which I knew anyway no coordination no nothing the report was very powerful very strong there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian people I was very honored by the report it was totally conclusive strong powerful many things said that nobody knew about and said in a very strong way welcome back to am joy on Friday Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released their final heavily redacted report from a year-long probe into Russia's influence operation saying the committee found quote no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded coordinated or conspired with the Russian government all of us on the same day NBC News revealed that the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump junior and senior campaign officials in June of 2016 has much closer ties to the Russian government than previously known that lawyer is an Italian vessel Nats kya who back in November of 2017 told the Senate Judiciary Committee quote I operate independently of any governmental bodies unquote but now she's saying something different in this exclusive interview with NBC's Richard Engel the only reason I'm asking these questions is because of the contact you had with the most senior people who are now in our government yeah that is sure efficient me so sooner should have warned Cucuy was privy to you could do even upon yet you said your relationship with the prosecutor general is what he knows about them yeah even those infernal Martin joining me now is Jonathan Kaye part of the Washington Post Jason Johnson of the route comm Sarah Kinsey or journalist and scholar of authoritarian States and author of the view from flyover country along with MSNBC legal analyst Paul Butler Sarah I'm gonna go to you on this first Donald Trump jr. talking about his Trump Tower meeting back in December on December 6 2017 this was his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff asks her ask from juniors her not that's on the tie but actually Trump juniors testimony but she vessel amid sky has started off the meeting discussing donors to Hillary Clinton that was the first topic she raised Trump jr. that was my recollection yes Adam Schiff again congressman Adam Schiff which would indicate that she understood the purpose ostensible purpose of the meeting as you did which was to provide derogatory information about Clinton Trump jr. to my understanding yes so Trump jr. was claiming that this was just about providing information on Hillary Clinton and adoption is there any problem now for Donald Trump jr. in your view if it turns out that the person he was having these discussions about derogatory information about turns out to be a Kremlin informant I mean yes there should be a problem there should have been a problem from the very beginning you know when he published his emails Donald Trump jr. on Twitter nearly a year ago you know we saw this laid out we saw these illicit ties that they had been denying for such a long time documented and now that we know that you know she was working for you know chico she was working for Groove the lawyer that's even worse for Donald Trump jr. and you know what's important is to look at this in the broader scope of illicit connections between members of the Trump campaign and the Trump administration and do the Kremlin and oligarchs you know Trump jr. is only one part of this puzzle you know they are trying to say that there is no collusion but I think what we're seeing here is the cover-up so we have you know two layers of this problem when is what they did and these illicit ties and the other is the constant lying about it that's been going on for the last two years let's go to Paul Butler on that on the legal potential legal ramifications on this for Donald Trump jr. Donald Trump senior tweeted last night House Intelligence Committee rules that there was all caps no collusion between the Trump campaign in Russia as I've been saying all along it's all a big al cat first initial cap hoax by the Democrats based on payments and based on payments and lies payments and lies there should never have been a special counsel appointed witch-hunt with the capital H on hunt do you see any problems with that idea that Donald Trump has in his mind been proven innocent if it turns out that his son had a meeting where he admits he was trying to get information dirt on Hillary Clinton and now it turns out the person who's trying to get it from says she is a Kremlin informant joy as a former federal prosecutor I'm embarrassed by that farce of an investigation that the Republicans did look at who they did not talk to they didn't talk to a Michael Flynn who's pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his contact with the Russians the Republicans themselves admitted that Carter Paige was not forthcoming about this bizarre meeting he had as a campaign operative with the Russians in June 2016 and they didn't subpoena telephone records from Donald Trump jr. about this bizarre call that he gets when he's plotting this meeting with the Russian lawyer two calls to the Russians in between a mysterious call from a blocked number we know that President Trump home had a block number joy if President Trump knew about this meeting with the Russians before it happened he's implicated in collusion so this report far from exonerating him digs him in deeper Wow I want to play just a little bit for those of you who missed this epic Donald Trump call an interview to Fox & Friends on Thursday let me play a little bit of it because he's gone back to falling back on the idea that the problem is not any of these meetings or anything was done it's the it's the FBI take a listen you look at the corruption at the top of the FBI it's a disgrace and our Justice Department which I try and stay away from but at some point I won't Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff not the nonsense of collusion with Russia there is no collusion with me and Russia and everyone knows it Jason he says everyone knows it I wonder just as a communications matter Donald Trump really never addresses the direct issue of his son in this meeting that I have heard he just sort of goes around it and sort of doesn't address it what do you make of this just as a pushback strategy on his part I mean Joe it's ridiculous does anyone watching does anyone here actually think that John Jr has the intelligence and age see to do this sort of thing without his father knowing I don't I mean it's it's highly unlikely that he planned this entire meeting separately from his father he was part of the campaign so whenever Trump gets on the air and he calls Fox News and he goes on these crazy rants and says there's no collusion I mean he's essentially saying well there was cooperation and there was partnership and it was quid pro quo and there was communication but it's not collusion it's all essentially collusion at this point and whether or not he is that mysterious third call or not it always seemed unlikely to me that that meeting could occur in that building with his son who was a key part of the campaign and president or candidate Trump and now President Trump never had any idea what it was about and didn't know that the meeting was happening I guess I just was so difficult for people to believe right that he would act in this sort of vacuum well I wanted to shift to you with you Jonathan - so on the house side you have the House Intelligence Committee which is under Devin hoon has been pretty clear that their goal is to exonerate Donald Trump and that that's where they were going all along so set that aside for a moment on the Senate side or the Senate Judiciary Committee they have now passed through at least the committee a bill to try and protect the investigation to protect Bob Mullen the legislation to shield the Special Counsel comes as Trump continues to criticize the Russian investigation the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to advance legislation this is / NBC News that's designed to make it more difficult for any president to dismiss a special counsel which is a single signal to Trump amid the ongoing Russia probe just as they are giving us the voice from Washington this is have a chance of passing and what do you miss what do you make of the fact that it's even being put through okay so the key word in what you just read is signal when a Senate is sending or at least the committee is sending a signal to President Trump that if you do this we will not be happy the problem is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell he's already on record as saying well I don't see a need to do anything about this so you've got to get it to the floor yep and have it passed the entire Senate big hurdle number one big and if that hurdle is cleared then it has to go to the house right where you know team Devin Eunice's is around and you have speaker Ryan and even firing chaplains is he gonna put that bill to the floor but see if that hurl is cleared and then they go to conference and that hurdle is cleared and a bill goes to Pennsylvania Avenue you know the schoolhouse rock version rest in peace man yes its schoolhouse right it goes on the President's desk president Trump is not going to sign it it is this is the equivalent of Republicans constantly send you know trying to pass the repeal of Obamacare thinking that if they pass it and got it to President Obama's desk that actually sign it he wasn't gonna sign that and president Trump's not gonna sign this yeah and to your very point and I'll come back to you on Sarah to you Sarah on this Mitch McConnell the Senate Majority Leader has already made it pretty clear he said he won't allow the full chamber to vote on this bill to protect Muller saying in an interview last week will not be having this on the floor of the Senate I mean you have a full-court press here by Republicans even if one or two committees signals that they do believe the investigations go forward or individual senators say it should it's pretty clear that the Senate in the house are to Jonathan's point protecting Trump yeah they're absolutely abdicating their duty the American public which is to bring forth the truth of this investigation to hold officials accountable they have no interest in protecting Moeller they are only interest in protecting only interested in protecting themselves and it's an abomination you know we're now on about two years in to this and I think one of the reasons that they're dragging this out and it dick in in addition to their own self-interest is because the exact same problems remain they remain here for 2018 elections they reign here for the 2020 elections they do not want these problems address they want to consolidate power so that they can try to remain immune from investigation immune from prosecution and immune from consequence and you know I wonder Jason if you can sort of give us some sense of what do you think the motive here is because you know we keep hearing behind the scenes that Republicans behind the scenes are complaining about Trump you have people giving sort of off-color comments to Erick Erickson and behind the scenes saying how much he annoys them but they are really in a full-court press to protect them what what could be the motive for that well because he's in power and because at the end of the day joy that is all the Republican Party has cared about they care about winning all they want to do is win and and Mitch McConnell recognizes that and it's not because they necessarily think that Trump is the best campaigner it's not because they necessarily think that Trump is a reliable partner and their goal to win it's because they believe that as long as they control as many branches of government as possible that they can get through tax cuts they can get through the kind of plans they want but I also want to mention this because I think this is really really key this is a long line and when we tell the history of the Russian investigation 30 years from now I hope he will be roundly condemned for this Mitch McConnell not only stymied a joint statement that President Obama want to do back in 2016 about Russian investigations but he's now standing there saying what we're not going to protect Muller because I don't see any reason that he's under threat when the president every other weekend says I can't wait until I fire Muller I just want you guys to turn around and let me do it so Mitch McConnell has clearly said that the power of the Republican Party is more important to him than the integrity in the sovereignty of the United States and then Paul then that brings me back to you because there have been a few articles that have come out that say in theory Muller could issue a sealed indictment against the President of the United States you still have the state of New York where Eric Schneiderman the Attorney General seems to be circling around and people in the Trump orbit maybe who knows how high that would go if Congress won't do anything about this if Muller would have land in their lap a set of crimes that he found in theory in Congress won't do anything about it then what well I mean in theory there's a long statute of limitations for some of these crimes at least five years so at some point if Trump is not in office in five years a prosecutor could indict them but Joey here's what's so troubling about what the Republicans are doing remember this investigation is about our democracy and whether the Trump campaign work with the Russians to try to steal the election and so now the Republicans say well there's rules in the Department of Justice about the special counsel only being fired for a good cause well that's kind of like an employee handbook what the proposed bill would do would give the special counsel the force of law which would mean that he could not be fired without good cause if he did that would be a violation of US law at the end of the day again this isn't about partisan politics this is about the rule of law and the strength of our democracy Jonathan Jason and Sarah we'll be back thank you very much Paul Butler appreciate that clarity and up next an update on Trump's very best people hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to
