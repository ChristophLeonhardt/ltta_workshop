from the the moment really that Chavez took power the Chavez government took power in 1999 there was immediate opposition to this new government because what Chavez was essentially doing was completely overturning an entire regime Chavez began to see we need to eradicate this poverty in our country and the way to do it is by gaining control of our oil industry and making sure those profits are going back into our country the oil industry is the purse strings of the country and Chavez realized that until he gained control of the purse strings any efforts at real social reform where that requires funding would would find challenges and now he was seeking to gain control of that oil industry Chavez finally you know took a very direct step in terms of transforming the state-owned oil company pedasi and fired the entire board of directors he actually comes on TV and he's wearing a referees jersey from a football match and he's got a whistle and he calls out the name of director so-and-so and blows the whistle says get out of here you're fired right so people are pretty angry and there are marches going on huge huge margins by seeking greater control of the national oil company peda VESA chavez was taking on Venezuela's most prized and powerful asset the fight for ped of essa spilled out onto the streets becoming symbolic of the struggle between two Venezuela's one left behind by an oil fueled modernity the other looking to keep this place and its control within it Caracas was a tinderbox of competing ideals battling for the very idea the Venezuela Venezuela was a huge turmoil everyday demonstrations in the streets going to miraflores the presidential palace it was an opposition rally I was moving in a hundreds of thousands toys the palace in order to ask terrorists to resign but the palace was surrounded by backers of Google Chavez they were going to resist this rally people that were on buildings shooting we don't know who they were several civilian fell dead of both sides Chavez called the army to send the tanks into the street to stop the people and the army said sorry this is a political problem we are not sending the tanks to the street to stop the people that was the coup that was really in the moment the coup happened was when his minister said I can't go out the army had been scarred by the handling of the carcass Oh unrest in 1989 but it's high-ranked had been conspiring with elements of the elite establishment deposed by Chavez and together they plotted his downfall we start getting reports in the fall of 2001 that you know this guy that guy the other guy are planning a coup if it becomes like background noise if we're hearing this everybody in Venezuela is hearing it as well Charles Shapiro had taken his seat as the US ambassador to Venezuela just three weeks before the coup against President Chavez a coup that was far from secret so the first weekend I'm there I meet with this delegation from a trade union organization and finally at the end I said but I hear you saying is the following is that there's a coup underway that's going to take place and you think you're being left out of it and you want to be in on the coop they went yeah yeah imagine that I said yes the executives of Baronessa were in the queue the church was in the cool the Cardinal of Caracas was in the cool the intrapreneur the president of any commoners was in the cool and I told people repeatedly I said look you know if it looks like a coup and it sounds like a courts a coup we are opposed to any extrajudicial change of government and if you don't like this government that's certainly your business but voted out of office and so it became clear that they were planning something and the US ambassador who was in Venezuela at the time was openly collaborating with the opposition I did not the US government did not organize plan implement authorize a coup okay and if I had I'm not organized enough to have organized a coup in three weeks Chavez was forced out by this coalition of you know these opposition groups Oh allied with these dissenting military high-ranking military officers who had forcefully gone in and taken him against his will Chavez calls Fidel Castro supposedly he told Castro that he was considering committing suicide they did Scarah who talks him down says don't do that you'll live to fight another day don't do that turn yourself in to the military in that that's what he does Chavez had been ousted taken into custody and flown to an offshore military base meanwhile Pedro Carmona the president for the communist the Federation of Chambers of Commerce says that he's going to be the leader of the country he practically emerges as a dictator he abolished is the rule of law in Venezuela they literally decreed the dissolution of all of Venezuela's democratic institutions including the Constitution and just been approved and written by over 80% of the country in the National Assembly they have this swearing-in ceremony where Carmona swears himself in as president of country you know like Napoleon right I mean under natural law I declare myself to be president of the country right it's just astounding what was amazing to me was that a day hadn't even mean it was just a matter of hours and it was already endorsed by the US government who had their spokespeople coming out of State Department in the White House saying you know Chavez has resigned and we support the transitional government in Venezuela the press spokesperson in Washington indicated that Chavez had brought the coup on himself this is at a time in which Latin America has been trying to avoid coos and had trying to erase the legacy of the 1980s and 1990s where there had been a series of military coos in Latin America there was an assumption that Chavez wasn't coming back we had a deal with Carmona as the de facto government get the Carmona to get the country back in the democratic path as quickly as possible and ensure that he doesn't kill Chavez meanwhile Chavez on Lord Shiva which is a military base but what he does is he writes out a note and he puts it in the trashcan that says I'm still the president I never resigned people begin pouring into the streets and then you know pieces began to fall into place with military officers that were loyal to Chavez that saw you know what was happening was wrong that there were people millions who were reclaiming you know their rights they voted for this president what's going on when this huge Pro Chavez demonstration comes and essentially drives Carmona and his government out of the presidential palace military sends a helicopter to pick up Chavez Chavez gets back to the presidential palace it's something like a movie a Hollywood movie he comes back in a helicopter in the night and the people are waiting for him and he says oh here I am go to sleep I'm here I'm president again within 48 hours of being overthrown Hugo Chavez was back in power you
