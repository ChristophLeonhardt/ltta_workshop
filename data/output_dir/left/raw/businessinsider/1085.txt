1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
we're gonna have a real wall and who's

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:22,650
gonna pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wall who I mean I</font>

3
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,650
suppose it's possible that the president

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,180
administration would try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase</font>

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,050
tariffs on Mexican goods coming into the

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,230
United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then used some of</font>

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">those tariffs to pay for the</font>

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,420
construction of the wall but that's

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,440
risky because it could lead to tariffs

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,950
on the other side by Mexico for goods

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,840
coming in from the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,780
know Mexico and Canada are our two

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,690
biggest trading partners in the world

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,239
accounting for about thirty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of</font>

15
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,020
our trade which creates an enormous

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,449
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of jobs right here in the United</font>
