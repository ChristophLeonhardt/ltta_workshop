1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,480
The design of this bottle started in Terre Haute Indiana in 1915.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,720
At the time, Coca Cola was being sold at soda fountains, or in a glass bottle called a hutchinson.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,020
But this simple straight-sided bottle was
easy to copy

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,480
and imitations were flooding the market.

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,490
The solution?

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,480
A national contest for a new bottle that would make Coca Cola stand out.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Even if the bottle was broken or you touched it in the dark.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,700
The Root Glass Company got to work on their
competition entry, looking up the word “coca”

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,520
in the encyclopedia and coming across an illustration for a cocoa pod.

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,220
The curvy, ridged shape appealed to the team

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,100
who used it as the basis for their winning design.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,520
The first bottles hit the shelves just a year
later

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,920
with the added touch of the glass being colored German Green,

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,260
later changed to Georgia Green

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,560
in honor of the Coca Cola company’s home state.

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,470
Sleek and iconic this is the design that’s
flaunted its curves to become the trademark

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:00:00,000
of the most popular drink in the world.
