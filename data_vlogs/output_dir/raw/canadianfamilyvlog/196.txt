431
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,629
did before was I would get camping

433
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,979
try to mount test them and do some

434
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:29,739

451
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">do dishes have a choice no but she's got</font>

452
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,000
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point now where she's really into</font>

453
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,490
it and she loves doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and she's I</font>

454
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,559
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you guys can even if you can</font>

455
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,970
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a while you see the</font>

456
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,100
transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of Vicky being kind</font>

457
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a little uncomfortable to now or she</font>

458
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like right into them being on</font>

459
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,820
camera and stuff but we had three goals

460
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,399
of doing a YouTube channel the first

461
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,769
goal of ours is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to show</font>

462
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:32,529
people Christ through us though we're

463
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,260
all Christians if you can know and what

464
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,059
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do is have people to be able</font>

465
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,279
to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> channel watch it and see</font>

466
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,350
then being a Christian doesn't mean that

467
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,240
you have to be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> some weird crazy</font>

468
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,039
different person you can just be a

469
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,990
normal person India Christian and still

470
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,940
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun and live life and we kind of</font>

471
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,679
want people to see that through us and

472
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,269
we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that message kind of gets</font>

473
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,399
across with us without<font color="#CCCCCC"> us having to jam</font>

474
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:56,620
it down everybody's throat and the

475
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,260
second reason is because we wanted to

476
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,139
have a log of all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids when</font>

477
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:04,330
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing up so because sometimes</font>

478
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,679
you make videos and you're missing

479
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,139
things if you have annoyed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got that on</font>

480
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:11,019
camera and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get so much on camera</font>

481
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,519
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could just go back any time I watch</font>

482
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and the third reason is because of</font>

483
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,510
the community like being able to get

484
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,460
subscribers and have people interested

485
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,529
in us so cool but I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

486
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:26,169

775
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,450
interesting to watch mm-hmm the

776
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,040
stereotypes of homeschoolers or

777
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,110

785
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,260
school look really advanced like stuff

786
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,450

787
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,640
grade year I've already learned like the

788
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,490
