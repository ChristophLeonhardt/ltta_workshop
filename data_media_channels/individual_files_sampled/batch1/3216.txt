I don't know if you've read this or not but Michael Phelps was apparently eating something like 12,000 calories before the Beijing Olympics the guy I'm not kidding he would eat like a fully stacked eggs and we're both omelets like oh my god yeah not want to eat anymore you do that what no no I do not do that before a competition for me will be like a chicken breast and maybe a little pasta because you know the carbs help because you're going to go out and play a lot of minutes and things that nature but Salamis and veggies will have me perfectly fine and before the game I may have like a protein shake and some fruit and I'll be ready to go but as far as pies of pizza and sandwiches and French I can't I wait for that after the game I can't do that before the game
