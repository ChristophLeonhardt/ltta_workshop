I have max keiser this is the COS report I smell teen spirit I feel a good show is coming information will be imparted you'll be relieved of your ignorance you'll be enlightened by our insights it's all happening right now thank goodness Stacy is here Stacy max actually since it's team spirit I'm gonna read you a few headlines and you tell me which one you want to know more about okay first one sounds like that the first one is from zero has JPMorgan publishes the Bitcoin Bible the second one is us Arizona Senate passes bill to allow tax payments and Bitcoin or Goldman Sachs raises gold price forecasts and one more what crushed stocks and that's from wolf street calm yes well the JPMorgan issuing their big claim Bible do you see the insider student organizations are in revolt Jamie Dimon their leader has been discredited Jamie Dimon their leader has been a known scam sir a penny pincher a regulatory nightmare somebody who has nickel and dimed America too near death if cumulated a billion dollars of pennies and like some bad Superman movie or that other film office space now it all dovetails nicely into the states rights of Arizona saying you know what we want the business we want the tax revenue crypto is the marijuana of money you can't smoke it but you can get high off it and they're thinking you know what we love it we've already got Nevada next door they're making big Bank in the casino business in the bunnyranch with all them fluffy looking people girls and whatnot and guys I suppose and they're thinking well I'm what revenue to the same crypto is the way forward crypto is the answer the little digits in that little code or something that will give us the kind of relief we need to pay for roads and infrastructure and maybe we can open our own little bus brothel and whatnot you never know once you go down this path its anything's possible for example those are my opening comments that would be my gambit at this time my salvo my word salad but don't toss it so let's I go over a few little bits I'll pull out some of the Nuggets from there the first paragraph I'll read to you they do admit here that some of the early buyers of CC ie cryptocurrency were clearly dismayed by ballooning balance sheets of the major central banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis but the lack of any meaningful inflation since and both developed markets and emerging markets has surely reduced concerns about fiat legal tender issued by a central bank money so they finally read the white paper they finally read the white paper totally but almost ten years and they say oh the ballooning debts that's what you know cause somebody with a concern to do battle with the terrorists in the central banks and they say that we printed lots of money but there was no inflation failing to recognize that there was no wage inflation for people there was asset inflation for your Punk enablers asset stripping mongers and terrorists but wages didn't go up because using financial engineering wages no no mas then good thing they don't go up yeah minorities black folks in America know they get nothing no they're in the wrong gerrymandered quarter nothing for them so it's all smoke and mirrors I hope they'll you know I'd like to see the faces of these bankers when they realize that the game is over and they're about to be run over by a steamroller I you know there's like ding ding ding ding ding we're dead that's right drop dead quicker make our lives easier in fact this next paragraph I'm going to read suggest he sees the steamroller coming because he's up basically in this paragraph pleading JP Morgan's pleading with the central bank's not to let them die because they say fractional reserve banking was a tremendous innovation that surely contributed greatly to global growth over the last two centuries and we would expect the central banks would think twice before disturbing this source of capital to the private sector that's a heinous lie I mean it's so ridiculously over-the-top of to say this fractional reserve banking has contributed mightily to the group of the growth of the economy has grown mightily to the growth of debt I mean this put the globe into this debt straightjacket of hundreds of percentage of of debt to GDP around the world it's essentially like saying to Pablo Escobar that putting baby powder and just cocaine which is like fractional reserve banking banking it contributed enormously to his cocaine Empire that's true but unless you want to run the world like a cocaine Empire like the Jamie diamonds and and Lloyd Blankfein's and the new Central Bank president then it's not healthy for the global economy they're in denial they don't fractional reserve banking is part of the whole tapeworm problem just a parasitical problem it's the whole destruction of the economy yes it's as lended to wealth no pun intended to a growth in debt but also a growth in fraud and a growth in injustice I would say as he had mentioned at the top it was the global financial crisis not in particularly the global financial crisis like he kind of skims over what the white paper actually says but it was the the fraud of the global financial crisis that was in the Bitcoin white paper the bailing out of the loser's of the parasites that the central bank's enabled so that that is only possible had we been on a gold standard or any other standard by which central banks would have actually it would have cost them to bail out their buddies and their cronies who were parasites then you wouldn't have seen who said this this is JP Morgan's JP Morgan is saying this so their fractional reserve banking it's not destructive and that had nothing to do with the global financial crisis okay Jamie Dimon is essentially the Harvey Weinstein of the global finance market and now Harvey Weinstein still thinks he's gonna make a comeback Harvey Weinstein's still in denial about the hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of cases of improper behavior slash rape Harvey YC would walk into a room and Jack you late into a plan and think that was acceptable Jamie Dimon walks into an economy and a jack monetary money he Jack you lates money and he says that's fine that's great well that income gap is skyrocketing the global ecosystem is collapsing we have made billionaires out of the worst caucus takk receive low-level nincompoops in the world but that's fine cuz I'm Jamie Harvey Weinstein diamond I mean this guy should be locked up and flogged I mean I hate to put it in those terms but if Saudi Arabia can do it why can't wait I mean the sky Novogratz was just in Saudi Arabia saying there are other routes better tomorrow well let's borrow some of their policies Mike let's take Jamie down to the you know the center of town and do the chop chop just get rid of our mice and vermin however in this so called Bitcoin Bible here is a positive thing they do finally admit about Bitcoin we examine the potential role of crypto currencies in terms of offering diversification and a global portfolio given their high returns over the past several years and their low correlation with a major asset classes offsetting some of the cost of high volatility if past returns volatilities and correlations persist cryptocurrencies could potentially have a role in diversifying ones global bond and equity portfolio but in our view that is a big if given the astronomic returns and volatilities over the past few years so kind of like you they do suggest that once the liquidity improves and once the price settles on a higher level it won't be so volatile and you won't see these thousand ex returns well here you know their make their talking banker the banker and fiduciary fiduciary in other words they're saying that bitcoin has eaten our lunch the returns on Bitcoin have made everything we do is a bank look stupid immature and low performance even Warren Buffett has not kept up with Bitcoin nobody's kept up with Bitcoin so they're saying that oh it's a non correlating asset okay what does that mean that means stocks bonds and currencies are all in bear markets now and are going to continue to be in bear markets and they're probably going to wipe out a whole generation or two cryptocurrencies are the only thing that's gonna save these people and us from being fired so we're gonna Bibble at the crypto currency market because even if we get a little bit of those games the last 10 years in Bitcoin it'll save us from having to report big red negative year-on-year returns on every single piece of money management business we touch so they're like oh yeah we want to save our job well it's you know too late the Millennials are going over to the cash app thanks to Jack over Jack Dorsey thanks Jack they're going over to coinbase they're going square that was a square cash up the square - I got a lot of big Bitcoin whales addicted to it should be some yeah introduced jimmy song the most trusted name in crypto yes he does like you saying his name and is now kind of you gotta get into it JP Morgan had denied denied denied denied the power and existence of Bitcoin now they're they've capitulated and they're accepting it and now they're writing Bitcoin Bibles the other argument by no coiners as they're called has been that until you could pay taxes and you're with Bitcoin then it's not a real currency and Arizona Senate passes bill to allow tax payments in Bitcoin the Arizona Senate passed a bill on February 8th to allow residents in the state to pay their taxes with crypto currencies public records indicate the Senate bill 109 1 which intends to enable crypto currencies not just Bitcoin for tax payment was introduced January 10th 2018 and passed by the Senate Finance Committee by a 4 to 3 vote On January 24th On February 8 the Senate passed the bill by 16 to 13 margin with 1 no vote Jim records just gotta be found like a meathead right now who still has to pass that they're like man we were so wrong about this Bitcoin thing we couldn't have been more wrong so also before I forget we said we mentioned that guy Michael and Josh you know not saying to anything but we promised we'd mentioned them uh hi Michael and job ever thanks for a great evening by the way though fun and Cancun those guys are great no super they had a lot of insight dope on who is really Satoshi but nobody in the global audience watching this knows what we're talking about right there but we already sure this be any different but regarding this okay so it's the past the Arizona House of Representative and what in particular the guy who sponsored this bill Arizona State Republican representative Jeff Winninger who co-sponsored bill said the tax measure intends to turn the state into a center of blockchain and digital currency technology in the future so that's yes the price you pay for Manning the barricades well this is obviously great news and everyone who said there's no use case for Bitcoin like you can't pay taxes with it they're being proven wrong by state by state they will adopt these policies and I'll kick up to the federal level especially as the price goes 100,000 for a bigger level we could just forget about is the states that matter in the United States and so they just states yes you know states are united they're saying follow us punk you know that's what they say to Jeff Sessions or whatever follow what we're doing and he this guy by the way this representative from Arizona says that this is just the first of several bills that he's introducing or co-sponsoring in Arizona to make it a blockchain friendly yeah Bitcoin directly state Beck yeah of course you know all those senators and congressmen who are against gay marriage and they find them as some hotel room with a rent boy is Jeff Sessions by that extrapolation of pothead we'll be discussing that in the second half don't go away much more coming your way welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to Mark usko he's the founder of chief investment officer at Morgan Creek Capital Management mark welcome to the show thanks for having me all right so we're gonna get to the Bitcoin stuff in a minute absolutely just put this in context so first of all how much do you guys manage over there roughly about a billion and a half okay so less so you've got to do asset allocation ii looked on trends and you're trying to put money to work where it's gonna get the biggest rate of return you've got some themes demographics in healthcare number two energy and natural resources number three growth of emerging market consumers for wolf transfer to developing markets so this just touch on these demographics and healthcare mark usko what do you see they're pretty simple the West is getting old and the East is very young we think that there'll be these two big trends one in the West we're gonna need a lot of biotechnology and a lot of medical devices we're spending more on looking better living longer and then in the East where they have young populations they need health care services Pharma so it's just a great opportunity for healthcare broadly energy and natural resources mark look energy is is ubiquitous we all need it we all are running out of different forms you get the alternative energy process or processes coming that are very interesting solar not waters the fact that solar prices are you know dropping down like the same way we saw microchip prices drop down and the that curve that asymptotic curve down to zero now it's not really having a big effect huge effect and you know it used to be grid parity was a pipe dream but now grid parity for solar power is is real grid parity means solar is on a parity with the current energy grant getting close okay still not as good as hydro or nuclear but it's getting right there with you know natural gas well Buckminster Fuller said the earth gets a thousand times more energy than it needs every day from the Sun exactly so we're just catching that right yeah fantastic okay growth of emerging market consumers what does that mean we are about to enter the largest consumptive boom in the history of mankind and I'm a hyperbolic person but that's not a hyperbolic statement there are three billion people that are about to age into the prime consumption year 45 to 65 around the world they've seen our life and they want it so whether it's in Asia whether it's in India China Malaysia Indonesia most people have no idea that Indonesia is 240 million people it's a huge huge place and they're starting to consume just like we are China is about to go from a manufacturing economy to a consumer economy and they've brought into the middle class a huge number of people and they're going to consume a lot of stuff India not this year the next year but over the next 30 or 40 years is going to have the most well-educated wealthiest workforce on the planet and high working age population growth which means high GDP growth now this is happening at an era when technology has brought consumerism a different spin on the game with sites like Amazon and elsewhere so when you think about consumerism and emerging markets like first you think maybe a Procter & Gamble right there yeah the shampoo and yep and and health care products and deodorants and stuff that P&G does and these people are getting the designer you know side of the law but does these technology platforms like Amazon are they gonna grow their own Amazon or as Amazon just gonna move into these places a great question and it's really they're gonna leapfrog just like they did in wireless you know they skipped wireline went straight to wireless so they take advantage of technology ecommerce in China is one of the you know biggest trends really going out there then get Alibaba you know not much 10 years ago today one of the most dominant players on the planet $0.10 and WeChat huge huge platforms for commerce think about this every day last year somebody bought stuff on on a mobile phone and 240 million people in the United States bought something with their mobile phone 750 million people in China did the same thing ecommerce over the next decade Courtney McKinsey will grow 26% compounded for 10 years the mobile component of e-commerce will grow 51 plug-in 1.5 1 to the 10th power in your HP 12c you and I from that era okay you get 65 not 65 percent 65 X so the market for mobile e-commerce in China's gonna be 60 five times larger a decade from now well transferred to developing markets where's the wealth transferring from to where creditors always win so think about when Europe had all the money and we were an emerging market back in the 1860 to 1920s and then they got very indebted and we took all the wealth same things happen now we now are fat dumb and happy we've got too much debt where's it all owned by emerging markets so the wealth always flows to the creditors so there's a symbiotic relationship between China and the US where China is reinvesting all the dollars they get yep and we're taking all the cheap goods yep is and they kept a dollar support house supported the dollar used to be that right is that breaking apart oh yeah bad badly my wife would kill me was an English major so you know here's the thing if you think about or men your wife's not here it's exactly why why sure that's right but she's busy outside so we can just rip the grammar oh we want it's just bad yeah not bad think we're bad all right so if you think about a friend of mine who has a daughter and four years ago she came to daddy I thought you said Santa Claus brings the presents so well honey he does why she says why do they all say made in China four years ago up to today it used to be about made in China and we were buying their cheap goods now as they become the largest consumer market in the world it's about made for China so all this rhetoric from the Trumpkin is about how we're gonna start a trade war no chance the biggest market in the world is China to send our goods to they now buy more oil from us than anybody else it's not changing a time and that's bad for the dollar the dollar is in a secular fair market and people don't want to acknowledge it they don't want to believe it but it just is look world reserve currency status you don't keep it forever you know you keep it usually 6070 years and then it goes to the next and it used to be all about powerful Navy now it's about the power of information data and consumptive English Pounds and the Navy Reserve cars in Portugal before that and Franz was in there yeah exactly and so now we're moving away from the US as world so you're looking at so the old doll on the dollar index I think the old low has been 70 yes currently around 90 yes say you're looking for a break below 70 yeah look we do these 10 surprises every year so my surprise last year is that would go down and everybody thought it was ridiculous this year I said we're going from 90 to 80 and I think the next year after that I'd probably go 80 to 70 so 70 is a little aggressive right now but I think we're there long term and you're bullish on gold kind of bullish on gold I mean I like gold the problem with gold is it can be and has been I think manipulated so that's a challenge there are too many short sellers in the world of gold but long-term relatively bullish thing only about gold it is a store of value it has been for 5000 years I mean for 4,000 of those 5000 years an out spot a fine man suit all right so now let's get to Bitcoin first of all you have a lovely time yes it's a gold equivalent it's also going oh yeah this little scale it's got Bitcoin on one side and gold on the other and that was sent to you by the fine folks at van eck benek yeah and I guess they have an etf product they're working they're working on they're working on you know they very bullish on Bitcoin oh they are and so as you are and you run a billion plus dollar fund how aggressive can you get into Bitcoin how do you play Bitcoin is it too early for a Bitcoin tell us yeah you know look we have played picks and shovels primarily so far we've invested a number of the venture funds that have been investing in place like coin base and and Corbett and other things so Barry Silbert grew up over there we're not with Barry but we're with Dan Moorhead at Pantera and we're looking at a capital and Stevens brothers so like those guys I think Barry's what he's doing is really great and we're looking forward to his next offering we've done a little bit in the actual crypto currencies the challenge for institutional investors most of our clients still institutions is custody and until somebody solves that custody you know it's funny they won't custody Bitcoin because they can't take physical custody but what are they doing with patents and what are stocks and bonds they're not really physical bearer bonds anymore they're ones and zeros so I'm not sure they're just not hiding behind the hey we don't understand it so we don't want to do it yet well a couple of Swiss banks are now offering custodian services I need to talk to you yeah so I just read about this is pretty this is new all right our friends over at gold money with Roy stood back all right cool now offers got institutional custodial services I'm gonna be on it as soon as we leave yeah I get a you know like a free hat or something because Roy Roy you promised me a t-shirt so far I got nothing how about some of that men a jewelry you know they oh yes that would be nice no be nice won it I'd be nice kid alright so let's talk about the regulator's out there so the CFTC Chairman Jian carto he came out here practically gave Bitcoin a wet kiss yes this is the currency of the Millennials and we're gonna be you got your little lap dog over here we love you kids we love crypto well my kids play with crypto how sincere is that look I think it's sincere and I think it's real in the sense that a couple things about the SEC and CFTC and all these regulatory bodies they don't have enough people right they can barely cover what they have to cover now the idea of trying to go out after the new hundred and forty funds that are now you know trading crypto and and all these new big exchanges that are popping up they don't have the new you mentioned just a moment ago a mark that the gold price was maybe inhibited from performance due to manipulation and that manipulation seems to be in blatantly in front of the face of regulators like silver was our Chilton before this guy was brought chillin he got was given irrefutable evidence and he seemed didn't seem to see what was right in front of his face so you know there seems to be a conflict here am I wrong look incentives matter did I just lose half your clients no I talk about this stuff too and and the reality is is centers matter and people do what they're incentive to do and you know JP Morgan had a lot of short gold and silver positions and they needed someone to take them aside so boom we get an ETF long gold but that is seemingly going to happen here in Bitcoin and blockchain related and crypto related assets and it's a process we're still very young you know people want to talk about which anywhere it we haven't even started the game we're still like in pregame warmups all right SEC chairman Clayton they're taking a more I think aggressive position certainly gets icos you know they should I've been in business for 30 years I started out on Wall Street you know all the ICS to me look like you know offerings and offerings are you know regulated and so is there are we gonna see some action there you think I think we are and I think we haven't they've gone after two that were really egregious look if you look at any organized exchange over the years there's always been abuses at the lowest level right penny stocks were run by boiler rooms they call them boiler rooms for reason not because there are nice people so when a regulatory body has to look into something new they have a choice where are they going to go and they're going to go after what seems like a legitimate transaction like a Bitcoin or a theorem or they want to go down to this level of pump and dump Ponzi schemes in an IC o that doesn't mean all icos or bad doesn't mean all tokenization is bad look I'm a huge believer that everything in the world this building we're sitting in some days gonna be tokenized fractional ownership 24/7 global liquidity that's far superior to lock it up ten years in a partnership and have two two-year extensions and pay two and twenty so let me just keep you can stay for another second before we go though so you put on a $400,000 price target on a Bitcoin yep I had to get there all about the Thai gold equivalent okay just gold equivalents and it's pretty simple and it was how can you make such a simple arguments like because that's where I think we're going Bitcoin to me in its current form and current technology is a store value digital gold goal is an eight point four trillion dollar market 21 million in aren't really 21 million there's probably I gotta go all right don't go away we'll pick up right there on that exact point thank you thank you and that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser and Stacey ever like to thank our guest Mark Hughes co of Morgan Creek capital if you wanna reach us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
