all right welcome back will he or won't he no not will attorney Michael avenatti run for president as he's hinted on Twitter though wouldn't you like to know the burning question this week was whether Michael I would rather I would take a bullet for the president Cohen will finally break with Donald Trump Cohen told ABC News this week that his first loyalty lies with quote family and country and not with the president his seeming change of heart comes as Cohen also hired a new legal team including former Bill Clinton White House Counsel Lanny Davis while removing the line in his Twitter bio about being Trump's personal attorney Michael have an ID attorney for stormy Dale's and her lawsuit against Cohen joins me now Michael thank you for being here oh thank you and I'll start by asking you what you think the significance is of Michael Cohen a saying he's only loyal to family and country and be hiring this new legal team including Lanny Davis you know joy I don't think it has a lot of significance I think what we saw in that George Stephanopoulos interview was a attempt by Michael Cohen to try to change the narrative about what he's all about to begin to lay the foundation for him being a patriot and someone that loves his country while at the same time remaining loyal to the president he's basically sitting on the fence and my view joy in trying to have it both ways and I think that the American people are smarter than this and I think they're gonna see through it there's nothing stopping Michael Cohen from coming clean right now and disclosing what he knows about the president what he knows about his business dealings and whether the president may be culpable of criminal conduct there's nothing stopping him from doing it right now and this whole idea that Michael Cohen's going to quote wait to see what the charges are is completely against or the opposite of being a patriot and loving the country well let's go into the questions about whether or not the case that you're involved in the stormy Daniels case could wind up migrating into the Muller probe Rudy Giuliani was on ABC's back on TV again he was on ABC this morning saying the Cohen investigation relating to stormy Daniels won't go anywhere because Muller hasn't picked it up take a listen we have no read I believe he did anything wrong the president did nothing wrong with him the mauler himself has indicated that there's nothing here because he would have given it away and he hasn't taken it back and every indication we have is the president is not involved in that and I'm hoping that Michael is able to clear himself because I think what was done to him was really unfair and I know he's being sensible and calm and trying to say prosecutors did nothing wrong but invading a lawyer's office I don't know George that that doesn't seem right to me Giuliani was a former prosecutor I'm sure he's done some raids in his day what do you what do you make of that well joy dazed and confused Rudy just makes it up as he goes along first of all had mr. Muller maintained control of the inquiry relating to the hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump would be shouting from the rooftops that he was exceeding the charge for which he was hired mr. Muller was hired to do exceeding what he was expected to look into they'd be at the forefront of that Rudy knows that mr. Muller could not maintain control over that piece of the investigation in light of what he was charged to do so that's absolutely absurd and it has no basis whatsoever like so many other things Rudy says on national television let's play one of the other things he said on NBC on national television which is that he can't say he wasn't able to say whether or not Donald Trump promised to reimburse my Michael Cohen for the payment that he made to your clients for me Daniels take listen the president did not promise in advance to reimburse Cohen for that that I don't know what whether there was an understanding between them that I think Cohen knew he'd be reimbursed it didn't seem to be any trouble in working out the reimbursement with the accountants what do you think of that well I think Rudy's lying let me just be as clear as possible Rudy is lying it is impossible for Rudy Giuliani to have been serving as the lawyer for this president for this amount of time and to not know the answer to that question he knows what the answer is and he knows the answer is yes Donald Trump agreed to reimburse Michael Cohen because if otherwise he would unequip police state that the answer was no so I think this this tells us everything we need to know joy and it's consistent with what I've been saying would ultimately be proven for months well there's the other issue which is you know what actually was found in the raids on Michael ins office including what investigators according to BuzzFeed were able to piece together from some shredded documents including a $62,500 wire transfer from March into a first republic bank account controlled by Cohen and that would fit with a series of payments reportedly from the Republican fundraiser Eliot Brody does the Brody case in anyway intersect with with the stormy Daniels case in your view I think it does joy because I think it all goes towards this whole idea of Michael Cohen being at the center of these hush payments on behalf of mr. Trump and others around him and I think you know all of this comes together I like BuzzFeed I think they do a nice job I have significant concerns relating to whether those are actually the documents that were found in the shredder or not but putting those aside I think all of this is tied together ultimately yeah Don Trump has said that regardless he he's tweeted that he doesn't think Cohen will ever flip he tweeted you know about that saying that I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible witch hunt blah blah blah that he wouldn't flip but Vanity Fair has written a piece that we talked about this change in Cohen's thinking that he sees himself as sort of an historic figure that's gonna change history a little bit of that Cohens friends have begun suggesting that he could change his narrative by cooperating with Robert Miller's Russia investigation to effectively become the John Dean of his generation quote four months every article written about Michael was calling him a thug a moron someone who was all mobbed up one friend of Cohen's told me now he has all these people telling him he could change the course of the midterms of 2020 is that enough of an incentive for Michael Cohen because nothing else has gotten him to do it before what do you make of the idea that maybe the idea of being dissed generations John Dean might be the thing that pushes him over the edge well first of all I've as I've been saying for months there's no question Michael Cohen's gonna flip the only question is when not if so that's first of all you know second of all as it relates to to Donald Trump putting Michael Cohen on an island which is effectively what he's done I think that was a grave error a strategically stupid mistake on Donald Trump's part and look I think what this boils down to is is that reality is starting to set in for Michael Cohen the reality that he is in a very bad place and is about to be in a world of hurt if he doesn't do the right thing but joy you can't wait to be arrested to do the right thing and then claim you're a patriot you can't wait to be indicted and then do the right thing and talk about how you love your country if you're a true patriot and if you truly love the country you do the right thing now for the sake of the country you don't do the right thing for the sake of saving your own butt god I ask you before we go you're running for president you know joy I don't know yet I mean I've rung the alarm bell I think the Democratic Party needs to put forward some candidates that can actually beat Donald Trump and I think that's a very short list you know this is a very effective campaigner he's a guy that should not be underestimated and if the Democratic Party makes the same mistake that others have made namely running 15 experienced candidates politicians against him we should not be surprised when the outcome is the same as it was in 2016 so whoever runs against this guy better be a street fighter they better have some charisma and they better be in for a very brutal campaign period and very quickly whether it's you running or someone else what do you think is the most effective message against Donald Trump the truth all right well I hope you'll let us know on this program if you decide to actually jump into the race Michael avenatti thank you very much for being here have a great Sunday thanks joy thank you and up next the sunday shows react to Donald Trump's pending Supreme Court nominations stay with us hey thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there for more am joy and the rest of MSNBC and click on any of the videos right here to watch the latest interviews and highlights and you can get more videos from MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
