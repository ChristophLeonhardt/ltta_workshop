Sneakerhead: 
a sneaker aficionado

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,800
who can be found buying, 
swapping or reselling sneakers

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,340
online, in parking lots
or at conventions.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,180
And now, at swanky stores
in SoHo like Stadium Goods.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,460
“I have 103 pairs of sneakers.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,030
It’s a fairly consistent
investment and occupation.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,900
It’s an obsession.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,140
It’s my hobby.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,100
But, I can easily
turn value back

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,780
by selling away some of it.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,170
I collect comics too 
and it's similar.”

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,510
Sneaker swapping and reselling
has been popular since the 1990s.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,170
But in the past couple
of years, dedicated online

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,540
and brick-and-mortar stores
that authenticate and resell

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,150
sneakers have popped up
to cash in on the trend.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,360
“I’m looking for
like really cool Jordan 1s.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,850
And I got lucky because they
have several pairs.”

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,240
Raena Anaïs is a stylist for rapper J. Cole.

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,620
She was shopping
for something

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,510
he could wear for
upcoming shows.

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,240
“The people who would, like,
catch an exclusive drop,

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,860
they would be the ones
reselling them on eBay

23
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,540
and then you had to
kind of bite the bullet

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,280
and pay the insane
markup for the resale

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,300
without even really
knowing: Are they real?

26
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,310
Have they been worn?

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,560
Like, I think this is
a lot more comfortable.”

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,550
At this store,
previously purchased,

29
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,000
but unworn sneakers are
sold on consignment.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,810
The house gets 20 percent.

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,020
The decades-old 
underground sneaker trade

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,490
has truly gone pro.

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,590
Some might even say “gentrified.”

34
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,640
“When things are sold out,
a lot of those shoes come here.

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,750
We then sell them again
at a higher price.

36
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,170
This shoe right now is 
available on Amazon.

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,000
It’s also for sale into
China on Tmall,

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,560
through our partnership with Alibaba.”

39
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,230
Coveted, hard-to-find models

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,120
can cost anywhere from hundreds
of dollars to tens of thousands.

41
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,900
“$9,999? I think a number 
fell off from that shoe. ”

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,720
Like these limited edition replicas

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,820
of Nike Air Max from 
"Back to the Future II"

44
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,780
“$29,950, that’s a pretty 
crazy price for a shoe.

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,010
But people,

46
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,890
there are people that will come
in and buy those shoes.”

47
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,950
Hand-to-hand trading
of these products,

48
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,510
that stuff still exists.

49
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,870
But we’re really
focused on creating

50
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,930
a premium retail
experience to elicit

51
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,280
that trust, which is something
that’s very new to that market.”

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,980
Major players in the
luxury world like LVMH

53
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,440
take a note of the potential
and started investing

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,999
in businesses like this one.

55
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,290
“It’s really hitting its stride.

56
00:02:19,290 --> 00:00:00,000
We think that honestly,
it’s only just beginning.”
