1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
but we didn't really describe myself as

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,380
an angry person I have moments of feisty

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,710
fierce rageful rage but and all the time

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,540
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just yield as I mentioned in</font>

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,519
another video that I did quite a long

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,290
time ago now like every year ago

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,610
something about anger that can be very

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,199
consuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why I do wonder whether</font>

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,460
anger can be used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right way</font>

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,439
because you know Virginia Woolf argues

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,029
that anger is detrimental to female

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,289
writing and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

13
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,029
necessarily true i jus just think that

14
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,820
anger has a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more negative effect in</font>

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">my life than positive event today a</font>

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,789
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things happen that caused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

17
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">this rage to come out of me that I</font>

18
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,120
didn't even know I had I've been joking

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,649
that since I've been painting up this

20
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,149
rate from nine months which nine months

21
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,770
since my dad died that today I gave

22
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,899
birth<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a rage baby boy I thought of</font>

23
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,100
that analogy the more it made sense

24
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,899
because it demands a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with</font>

25
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,250
you like it's constantly wanting your

26
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,239
attention when you have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

27
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes you that angry it's almost a lot</font>

28
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,420
easier to just pretend it doesn't exist

29
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,980
but you get to a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you've</font>

30
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,719
panned out for that bomb that you can't

31
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,620
ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that you have to acknowledge</font>

32
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,020
it you have to dress it you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

33
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">it stop somehow so I did things I know</font>

34
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,640
me too i watch television I went for a

35
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,739
run i did some reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sort of friends</font>

36
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,180
taking the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my head is this</font>

37
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,680
annoyance that I just haven't really

38
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,939
dealt with it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one or two</font>

39
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,560
things it's a whole range of things that

40
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,659
I've just kept playing on the side there

41
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,220
wasn't rage and a Bruce Banner kind of

42
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,630
way it was raised in a Harry Potter in

43
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> order of the phoenix kind of way</font>

44
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,560
more worried about you know injustice

45
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,600
the general unfairness of things which

46
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,460
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in itself a bit unfair because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

47
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,950
been a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunate person and i have</font>

48
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of things that i am lucky to have</font>

49
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,229
like live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a country with health care</font>

50
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">i have family</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have this</font>

51
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,720
camera I have you guys in general I have

52
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,460
skills have commitment i have drive all

53
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,049
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but then while yielding is so</font>

54
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,820
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and while i have really</font>

55
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,200
focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for such a long time and</font>

56
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,320
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> self-control and and not closing</font>

57
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,540
things away you but realizing that there

58
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,670
are certain ways to react to<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation</font>

59
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> range just because it's your first</font>

60
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,390
reaction might not necessarily be the

61
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,890
right one<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i'm kind of forgotten</font>

62
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,450
that sometimes maybe she might not

63
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,829
necessarily be the wrong one either

64
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,439
today was a day of self realizations and

65
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,420
range babies and again it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

66
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,219
situations where I you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

67
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,530
does change this baby's nappy then all

68
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,450
of a sudden it makes it messy again so

69
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,590
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you've just sorted one</font>

70
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,580
thing out you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

71
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,330
solved the problem

72
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,640
no there's anyone like oh yeah it's just

73
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,740
exhausting but it's not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

74
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">is solved by saying this is why I'm</font>

75
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,750
angry or even by sorting out directly

76
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,910
it's just by accepting that sometimes

77
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,970
and each not just keep everything hold

78
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,430
up and and to keep calm and carry on

79
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,130
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the british way isn't</font>

80
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,620
always the right way it's a right way

81
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,630
99.99 and I 99 99 percent of the time

82
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,280
but that teeny teeny 0.0000<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sarah series</font>

83
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,020
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> everywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how many</font>

84
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,700
series upset that it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rage</font>

85
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,140
as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not breaking anyone's</font>

86
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,690
face or like directly attacking anyone I

87
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,970
stand by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are good forms of</font>

88
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,920
anger and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the anger isn't necessarily a</font>

89
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,410
totally simplistic seven deadly sins

90
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,209
type of thing and yet haven't really

91
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,850
managed to formulate when anger is

92
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,430
accurate or useful or desirable I think

93
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,020
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of it involves channeling rather</font>

94
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,400
than denying but I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

95
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,290
have any thoughts on the function of

96
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,660
anger let me know in comments I hope you

97
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,880
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> had less rage-filled days and that</font>

98
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,440
if you were filled with aya<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

99
00:03:10,440 --> 00:00:00,000
dissipated somewhat by this point bye
