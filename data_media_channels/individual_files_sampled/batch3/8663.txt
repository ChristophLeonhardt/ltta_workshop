DEMOCRAT MEDIA, HE'S FINDING A WAY TO GET OUT WHAT HE WANTS TO GET OUT AND IT WORKS FOR HIM REALLY WELL. TODD: THOUSAND CAME OUT TO PRAISE HIM FOR GETTING AMERICANS HOME THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DOES NOT SEEM TO AGREE. SUCCESS IN THE FOREIGN-POLICY FIELD MIGHT DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. VERY KEEN TO GET A WIN OUT OF THIS. COMPLETE INCAPACITY FOR HUMAN EMPATHY. HE KNOWS HOW TO GET PUBLICITY, BLEED A LOT OF DRAMA. IT IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, IT IS ABOUT THE RATINGS. WHY WON'T THE MEDIA GIVE DONALD TRUMP CREDIT? HERE TO WAY AND IS THE PRESIDENT OF DISTRICT MEDIA GROUP. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THAT WAS SUCH AN AMERICAN MOMENT. I THOUGHT, THEY WILL GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE CREDIT IS DUE BUT NOT SO MUCH. SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BRING ALL AMERICANS TOGETHER WITH YOU ARE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT REGARDLESS WITH THE WORK IN THE MEDIA OR NOT, BRINGING HOME THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES IS A HUGE VICTORY, TALKING ABOUT HOSTAGES FROM NORTH KOREA. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTEN. THINK ABOUT THE STATE THAT OTTO WARMBIER WAS IN, HORRIFIC CONDITIONS. TO HAVE THIS MOMENT, THE PRES. MEETING WITH THREE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY LANDED AT ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, A HUGE MOMENT. WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT RUSSIA YESTERDAY, STORMY DANIELS AND THIS SHOULD BRING AMERICANS TOGETHER. A FEW HOURS AFTER THE HOSTAGES RETURNED WE DEVOTED OUR ENTIRE 60 MINUTES DURING MY TIME IN THE CHURCH A COVERAGE OF THE NORTH KOREA SITUATION. FLASH FORWARD TO THE EVENING NEWS, NBC, 2 MINUTES AND 20 MINUTES AND 5 SECONDS. THAN MSNBC TOTAL PRIMETIME COVERAGE FROM 8:00 TO 11:00 PM ON WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST STORY OF THE DAY, TOTAL OF 30 SECONDS. AT SOME POINT ISN'T THERE SOME DISINGENUOUSNESS, A MAJOR AMERICAN STORY. NOT JUST THE HOSTAGE RELEASE BUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT NORTH KOREA WILL GET RID OF THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM, IT WILL HAPPEN ON JUNE 12TH, AND THE PRES. KIM JONG UN, THAT CAME OUT AS WELL. THESE ARE MAJOR NEWS STORIES, A COUNTRY THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO WAR WITH. FOR THERE TO BE A POTENTIAL FOR A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO NORTH KOREAN WEBKINZ AND THAT IS NOT A MAJOR NEWS STORY IS SHOCKING. I KNOW THERE IS BIAS IN SOME MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS, THEY DON'T LIKE TRUMP BUT EVEN ON THIS STORY IT IS SHOCKING HOW LITTLE TIME IS DEVOTED TO IT. HEATHER: AFTER THIS INCIDENT I DON'T SEE ANY SITUATION THE PRESIDENT CAN GET ANY POSITIVE
