thirty-four-year-old ma san vitale arrived in chile seven months ago from haiti and works at Santiago's largest fruit and vegetable market nearby that marries frohes who came three years ago from the MS whele runs a restaurant that sells Venezuelan food for us Venezuelans Chili's like the United States except here the work opportunities are much better and it's much easier to enter than the US but that has changed to confront what it describes as a migration emergency Chili's government is making it tougher acquiring migrants who want to settle here to first apply for a visa in less than three years the number of migrants who enter chilliest tourists has tripled from 460 thousand to more than 1.2 million it's added diversity to Latin America's most stable economy but it's also put a strain on a country clearly unprepared for such a sudden influx the problem is not migration of Chile because we have the capacity for migrants the problem is lying so you can migrate like coming as a tourist and then staying that generates an irregular status that creates all sorts of problems and so Chile has adopted a carrot-and-stick policy it's begun expelling two thousand migrants who've committed crimes while offering hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants already here a one-time chance to apply for residency this is part of a three block long queue of patients all of them applying for their legal status here in Chile after Sunday those who haven't done so will be subject to deportation without papers you can't work and so this reform will help those of us who are here but for those who want to follow who knows patients can no longer arrive without a work visa although 10,000 relatives of those who are already residents will be allowed to come every year barring a criminal record and is Raylan's will automatically be approved because of the political and economic crisis there but if they are upset about the new rules now Chile is demanding pinna records and constantly visas these procedures that used to take a week now take a year and cost a fortune in Venezuela because of the chaos there people there can't wait that long Chile's migrant center which is run by Jesuit priests predicts the new value lations would simply spur migrant trafficking along Chile's porous border we're already seeing Venezuelans entering through irregular means we need to improve the institutional ability to document migrants here rather than making entry more difficult indeed Chile is working to overhaul its outdated immigration law the oldest in the region the big question is how that will change this country and the hopes and dreams of those who want to make it their home see a Newman al Jazeera Santiago
