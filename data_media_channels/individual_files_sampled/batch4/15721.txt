imagine prison except you have to pay thousands of dollars for your punishment which by the way isn't making the world better with community service but instead learning how to make it worse from socialist sociopaths a lot of potential for crazy right here are the top five most insane happenings on college campuses this year five randy lowry Lipscomb University president apologized to black students after hosting them for dinner why did the n-word tumble out of his mouth did he accidentally bind them in Chains and thrust them on to the University auctioneering on his dinner table oh and he also according to one student served black meals which are apparently mac and cheese collard greens and cornbread YUM perhaps Rachel Dolezal is not the only trans black the President issued an apology saying the content of the centerpieces was offensive and I could have handled the situation with more sensitivity I sincerely apologize for the discomfort anger or disappointment we caused and solicit your forgiveness yes it doesn't matter if millions of whites also picked cotton there will be no more cotton decorations for you we'll be taking that centerpiece and I know you think you're being sneaky but will be also confiscating that t-shirt and underwear for this time last year a self-admitted communist professor made headlines for tweeting all I want for Christmas is white genocide in October he was back this time to blame a mass murder on whites still don't know the motive for Las Vegas well Georgia secured el Omar anew in just a matter of hours tweeting it's the white supremacist patriarchy stupid white people and men are told that they are entitled to everything this is what happens when they don't get what they want well SiC Omar which is what I'll call him the professor certainly got what he wanted from this tweet attention Drexel University placed him on leave citing threats he received and concerns about the safety of the campus and secured Rallo should be afraid none of the threats but of the possibility that his communist dream could one day be realized I mean come on how many days do you think this guy would last in the gulag three Evergreen State College perfectly showcased the hypocrisy of the left when it comes to diversity with its day of absence on which whites were supposed to self segregate by leaving the campus when professor Brett Weinstein dared to protest this event well see for yourself give it in the direction of the values that you are standing here for yeah resigning what resign and here's how the students treated their president George bridges it's a bit sickening isn't it authority figures aren't always the most pleasant but you can at least treat them as though they're human but this is the kind of authorization and zapping of empathy that often precedes left-wing violence sure nearly every study condemns it in Washington state bans it but incidents like these make you wonder whether corporal punishment in schools wouldn't be a good thing after all shortly after the protests evergreens police chief resigned and it seems like it wasn't just because of the entitled brats but also because of an administration so hell-bent on social justice it will sacrifice the safety of its own students rifles or you sort of philosophical its philosophical does it concern you though that if you had an active shooter that that might be a necessary I don't know law enforcement and the importance of having rifles but concerns me greatly we should have rifles in my opinion oh okay so that lose decision was it not to have rifles was wasn't you it wasn't your department it's not me do you know who did whose decision that was a college administration lawmakers tried to privatize evergreen thereby depriving it of its state funding but the left unfortunately dominates Washington State Legislature that's not to say that will always be the case if Evergreen doesn't want to end up like Mizzou and lose 25 percent of its students and 30 million dollars in its budget it had better shape up to when police officers fail to prevent left-wing violence and the media failed to cover it afterward there's at least one institution we can all rely on that's right for champ Diablo Valley College professor Eric Clanton bashed in a trump supporters head with the bike lock during an April Berkeley protest oh shit he's bleeding oh yeah bleeding and he would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for those meddling meme lords with their weaponized autism 4chan analyzed Clanton's facial structures skin tone hairline and apparel to match the cloak to an Tifa culprit up with his unmasked counterpart police arrested Clanton about a month after 4chan identified him as the assailant he got his free trial date this month I'll leave you with this thought before number one what does it say about our institutions of learning when a violent professor who prefers weapons over words teaches nothing other than ethics philosophy and critical thinking 1 now in case you needed any reminder that the West is the best this one should do it for you a mob of students and school officials in Pakistan stripped student National Khan naked and smashed his skull with a flowerpot their feet and planks what did Colin do to deserve this rape or kill someone in an even more violent fashion no Khan was accused of blasphemy a charge of which he was later cleared by the way not that that even matters Condon criticized the university administration and a student and university official plotted to murder him because he was apparently a danger to the schools chapter of the Democratic Socialist Awami National Party now it may be hard to fathom a student getting killed for blasphemy in the West but perhaps not as much after seeing the violence of Eric Clanton and other anti-fur activists public shaming has existed since the early days of Twitter but social justice warriors converted it into a vehicle for getting their political opponents fired from their jobs 2017 saw further escalation as Trump supporters got beaten up on the streets by black masked thugs a bike lock some pepper spray or a few punches followed by a quick retreat but how much longer until an Tifa is further emboldened by sympathetic professors like George Tucker ello and Mark Bray to finish the job like with poor marshal Khan I'm Rob shamrock and this is why we need a campus unmasked if you liked this video and support our mission please make sure to comment to subscribe if something happens on your campus and
