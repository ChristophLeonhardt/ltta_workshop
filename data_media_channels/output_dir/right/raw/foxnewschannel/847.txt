1
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:14,644
HOWIE: THE MEDIA HAVE A NEW TERM

2
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:17,013
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND

3
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:17,447
DONALD TRUMP.

4
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:20,517
>> IT HAS DEINVOLVED INTO A

5
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:20,817
CULT.

6
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:26,289
>> THE PRIMARY VOTERS IN THE

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,526
REPUBLICAN PARTY DEINVOLVED INTO

8
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:30,594
A CULT.

9
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:32,662
>> THIS IS JONESTOWN?

10
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:35,132
>> DONALD TRUMP IS ACCUSED OF

11
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:37,234
LEADING A CULT.

12
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:40,504
TO BELIEVE THAT CNN IS MORE A

13
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:42,239
THREAT THAN NORTH KOREA.

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,342
HOWIE: SENATOR BOB CORKER SAID

15
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:46,443
THIS COULD REPORTERS.

16
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:50,580
>> IT'S ALMOST BECOMING A

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,948
CULTISH THING.

18
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,251
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR ANY

19
00:00:54,251 --> 00:01:00,590
PARTY TO END UP WITH A CULT-LIKE

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,957
SITUATION.

21
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:05,529
HOWIE: JOINING US, EMILY

22
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:11,968
JASHINSKY, AND CATHY AREU.

23
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:14,171
EMILY, MANY IN THE MEDIA

24
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:16,106
ADOPTING THIS LABEL THAT THE

25
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:17,741
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A TRUMPIAN

26
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:18,308
CULT.

27
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:20,610
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,314
THE JOURNALISTIC MINDSET.

29
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,616
EMILY: I THINK THERE IS SOME

30
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:29,753
GLEE THAT BOB CORKER GAVE THEM

31
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:30,320
THE WORD.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,658
DO I BELIEVE THERE IS TOO MUCH

33
00:01:34,658 --> 00:01:37,060
DEFERENCE TO THE PRESIDENT?

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,595
ABSOLUTELY.

35
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:40,864
I THINK IT'S TOOER TO SAY THERE

36
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,866
IS SOME SORT OF CULT AROUND

37
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:43,934
DONALD TRUMP.

38
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:47,037
I THINK IT'S SHORT-SIGHTED.

39
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:50,974
HOWIE: CATHY, EVEN WELL BEFORE

40
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:54,711
CORKER I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH.

41
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:55,712
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" LAST WEEK

42
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,514
THE CULT OF TRUMP.

43
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,249
NATIONAL JOURNAL LAST YEAR,

44
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:04,988
TRUMP'S CULT OVERWHELMS THE GOP.

45
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:07,891
CATHY: I GUESS THE PRESS DID IT

46
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:11,194
FIRST, BUT THE GOP JUMPED ON IT

47
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:14,064
SO THE GOP IS OWNING THIS WORD.

48
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:17,467
TRUMP DOES HAVE FOLLOWERS.

49
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,669
JOURNALISTS -- RIGHT-LEANING

50
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:21,538
JOURNALISTS AS GEORGE WILL WAS

51
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:24,708
TALKING TO BILL MAHER ABOUT THIS

52
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,244
AND SAYING IT'S NOT SO MUCH A

53
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:29,246
CULT AS A CULTURE OF FEAR.

54
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:31,515
THEY ARE DISSECTING IT AND

55
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,183
ANALYZING IT AND TAKE IT TO THE

56
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:33,850
NEXT LEVEL.

57
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,253
IS IT REALLY A CULT?

58
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:39,789
WE ARE MOVING AWAY TO THE C-WORD

59
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:42,092
AND MOVING TO ANOTHER WORD.

60
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,861
HOWIE: I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM

61
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:47,297
WITH THE UNDERLYING ANALYSIS

62
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:49,266
THAT MOST OF IN THE GOP FOLLOW

63
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,934
THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY AGREE

64
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:53,503
WITH HIP OR FEAR HIM OR FEAR

65
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:55,272
LOSING THEIR JOBS.

66
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:57,674
BUT THINK ABOUT THIS WORD CULT.

67
00:02:57,674 --> 00:03:01,044
IT SUGGESTS IT'S SPOOKY.

68
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:02,979
A CULT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN IT

69
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:07,717
MUST BE MINDLESS AND DELUSIONAL.

70
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:10,153
THEY ARE USING THIS IN RELATION

71
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:11,154
TO TRUMP.

72
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:14,591
>> IT'S WHAT IT IMPLYINGS TO THE

73
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,492
REPUBLICANS.

74
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:20,463
THIS IS A PRESIDENT POPULAR WITH

75
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:21,364
REPUBLICAN VOTERS.

76
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:24,901
THEY ARE JUST -- I THINK THERE

77
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:29,573
IS TOO MUCH DEFERENCE SOMETIMES.

78
00:03:29,573 --> 00:00:00,000
THE MEDIA IS TOO EXCITED TO USE
