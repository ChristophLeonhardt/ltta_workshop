keep your eyes on it first and foremost
know that they attack bottom up they
tend to come straight up at you to be a
realistic throwing a punch in the water
is like slow-motion anybody that can
pull it off and actually cause damage
give me a call but the gills and the
eyes are probably your highest chance of
creating pain once again just like with
anything you want to create pain you
want to induce pain and hopefully it
leaves you alone that is the number one
goal and create distance if you can but
you know as a last resort you go for the
gills you go for the eyes you literally
want to shove your thumbs into the
shark's eyes if you grab the gills you
want to stick your fingers in the vents
and you want to try and rip them out
