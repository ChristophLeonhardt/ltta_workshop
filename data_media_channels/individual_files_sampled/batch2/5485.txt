we're gonna start tonight though in the great state of North Dakota North Dakota is a really really red state overall in the 2008 presidential election you will recall that Barack Obama absolutely shellacked John McCain was not anywhere near close Obama beat McCain easily and handily in that election but in North Dakota Obama lost John McCain won there by eight points then four years later 2012 Barack Obama again won the presidential election he beat Mitt Romney it's a little closer but he still beat him pretty badly in that 2012 election in which Obama won nationwide he still lost North Dakota this time by almost 20 points North Dakota is a red red red state all statewide elected state officials are Republicans in North Dakota from the Governor on down and look at the state legislature this is this is not yeah that makes it clear this is the Statehouse in North Dakota there are 94 seats in the State House of those 94 81 of them are held by Republicans this is the state Senate there are 47 seats in the state Senate of the 47 38 of them are held by Republicans I mean that ratio is amazing right in the state Senate 38 Republicans 9 Democrats but it's not a monolithic story look back at those Obama numbers for a second so that's 2008 on the Left 2012 on the right look at this county-by-county breakdown now yes in both of these elections Obama loses overall in the state but there are places in the state that go for Obama and in fact there are a couple of places that go for Obama with 70-plus percent of the vote both times look in 2008 and 2012 there are pockets of North Dakota that are the deepest blue that voted more than 70 percent for Obama even in that deep red state the two counties that voted for Obama by more than 70 percent in 2008 and 2012 those two counties are the two counties in North Dakota that are majority Native American this county here Sioux County is about 85 percent Native American in terms of population this county up here at the top the other deep blue in Rowlett County it's over 70 percent Native American in terms of its population there's the two counties in the state that are majority Native American so like I said North Dakota not a red state but not everywhere and really really really not among North Dakota Native Americans in 2012 when President Obama was doing great with Native Americans in North Dakota but otherwise losing that state there was another important race on that same ballot that year it was an important contested US Senate race in North Dakota 2012 that Senate race in North Dakota in 2012 was won by the Democratic candidate won by Heidi Heitkamp just barely in 2012 in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp won that Senate seat by a margin of less than 1% of the vote and in a state with a population as small as North Dakota's that means the absolute number of votes we're talking about here is incredibly small Heidi Heitkamp won that US Senate seat in 2012 by a margin of less than three thousand votes statewide but again look at how the vote came in I mean if you're a Democratic candidate you know you're you're you're Barack Obama you're running in North Dakota it's a race that it's not gonna be all that close you're not gonna lose in the end it's probably still nice to get really huge concentrations of Democratic votes in majority native-american parts of the state right but if you're Heidi Heitkamp and you know it's not going to be a blowout you're running a race that is close that you might actually have a chance to win if you are in a race that it says as tight as that Senate race was in 2012 those couple of deep deep deep blue counties those aren't just nice those are just heartwarming that's how you win right it's a statewide race you get votes wherever you can you chase them all across the straight you try to appeal as to as wide a group of North Dakotans as you can but in particular it's absolutely crucial in a close race that you turnout the voters who you know are gonna vote for you and incredibly strong concentrations right if if there's any place in your state you're a Democratic candidate I don't care who you are if there's someplace in your state where you know you're going to get more than 70% of the vote in that County you have to turn out the voters in that County and Heidi Heitkamp did in 2012 and strong Native American support for Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is a big reason why right now there's a democratic held US Senate seat from that red state and the closeness of height camps last race the crucial support that she got from Native American voters that did not escape notice among Republicans and in particular among Republicans who are now making decisions about who's gonna be allowed to vote this next time and who might find it exceedingly difficult to vote this next time you may be noticing a sort of theme these days in the news right we're 22 days out from the midterm elections as of right now late last week we reported a story out of Waller County Texas Waller County is a County that's about 70 percent white but it's also home to a historically black college Prairie View A&M where the student body is over 80 percent black under constitutional law under crystal-clear Supreme Court precedent college students are allowed to vote wherever they live which includes if they live at College Prairie View a.m. students can vote in Waller County Texas nevertheless Waller County Texas keeps coming up with new ways to try to keep students at that college from voting new hurdles new obstacles for those students to make it harder for them to vote over decades students at Prairie View a.m. have had to fight for their right to vote fight for their ability to vote year after year election after election after election after election this year that perennial fight incredibly included this year the county arresting the field director for a local Democratic congressional candidate when that field director went to the Waller County Courthouse to hand over a letter advocating for the voting rights of the students at that college that they should be allowed to vote without hassle they arrested the guy after he after the officers asked him what the party affiliation was of his candidate he told them Democrat they arrested him we told that story here on the show last week then Friday night after much gnashing of teeth and rending of garments Friday night the Texas Secretary of State local county officials finally announced ok ok the students at Prairie View A&M will be allowed to vote this year like everybody else no strings attached no extra hurdles no supplemental paperwork that they have to fill out to satisfy the county that they are indeed allowed to vote so we reported on that fight and that win in that fight last week we've also been reporting over the last few days on the situation in the great state of Georgia where the Republican Secretary of State a man named Brian Kemp has made it his mission to rip up the voter rolls as aggressively as possible over the last few years you know in preparation for his own election campaign for governor this year for context here the last two governor's races in Georgia were each decided by only about 200,000 votes out of millions of votes cast in a state as big as Georgia with a population as big as Georgia a 200,000 vote margin is nothing these last couple of governor's races in Georgia have been exceedingly close 200,000 votes last year alone Brian Kemp took six hundred and seventy thousand people off the voter rolls last year alone what's he afraid of this year he's facing calls to resign as Secretary of State ahead of the election 22 days from now because among other things he and his office have put 53,000 new applications for voter registration on hold in his office ahead of his own election over 70% of those 53,000 registrations he's holding are from Georgia voters who are African American what does he have to fear from them tonight we are waiting to find out if the federal lawsuit that was filed against Brian Kemp last week is going to include a request to the federal courts that they should issue an injunction to block Secretary of State Brian Kemp from what he's doing with these voter registrations in Georgia ahead of the election at which he will be at the top of the ticket that lawsuit federal lawsuit was filed against Kemp on Thursday night we are watching to see what's going to happen in terms of how that plays out I mean this is very much down to the wire in Georgia early voting in Georgia started today Atlanta journal-constitution is reporting that there were some hiccups there were some screw-ups around the state that resulted in long lines at some polling places on the first day of early voting more worryingly The Journal Constitution reports tonight that in the second-most populous county in Georgia in Gwinnett County officials there have been throwing out people's completed absentee ballots when they've been mailed in this is from the Atlanta journal-constitution tonight quote nearly 1 in 10 the vote-by-mail ballots have been rejected by Gwinnett County election officials alarming voting rights groups Gwinnett is throwing out far more absentee ballots than any other county in Georgia according to records from the Secretary of State's office Gwinnett County as I mentioned is the second most populated county in the state of Georgia it's also the most diverse County in the state more than 60% of the residents of Gwinnett County are Latino black or Asian and that is the county where ballots are being thrown out at a rate far exceeding every other county in that crucial state so you are noticing a theme here you are noticing the tilt of the playing field right you're noticing how Republicans are using their power to administer elections to try to make sure that their voters have an easy time voting but voters who are less likely to vote for them have to run some sort of steeplechase in order to even try we're seeing that all over the country this year here's how it's going right now in North Dakota where the US Senate seat that's now held by Democrat Heidi Heitkamp may well be the key to whether or not the Democratic Party controls the US Senate or the Republican Party does I mean every seat matters but the way the map and the map match up this year Republicans are pretty confident that if they can take Heidi Heitkamp seat in North Dakota they're pretty sure Democrats will not take the US Senate given the theme that we have seen in Texas and Georgia and other places so far this year you can probably predict the Republican game plan for how they're trying to tilt the playing field against Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota again Heitkamp won her seat in 2012 six years ago by a margin of less than three thousand votes just couldn't have been closer the tightness of that race made her strong support from Native American communities in North Dakota not just important but critical in a race decided by less than 1% of the vote imagine how Heidi can't hide camp would have done without those deep blue counties that are the majority Native American counties in the state well right after Heidi Heitkamp was elected in 2012 right after she was sworn in as the Democratic Party's u.s. senator from the great state of North Dakota right after that the Republican controlled legislature in North Dakota swung into action to see what they could do to forgive me but effectively to cut down on the Native American vote I don't say that ad hominem I don't say that sort of willy-nilly as an insult I say it because that's what they did surgically like a laser after Heidi Heitkamp got elected in 2012 republican-controlled state legislature comes in in 2013 and passes a law to severely limit the type of ID you'd be able to show in order to vote in North Dakota two years later the legislature came back in session 2015 they cut down the number of IDs even more what they specifically were working to get rid of in that state was your ability to vote if your ID doesn't have a street address on it tens of thousands of people in North Dakota don't have a street address on their ID in most cases they have a Pio box instead this is especially the case I mean this is a this is the case across across the country in rural areas but it's particularly the case on rural Native American reservations where tribal IDs as a matter of course don't have a street address they have a Pio box instead that's just the way it's done well that's what the republican-controlled legislature zeroed in on like a laser in terms of cutting off the right to vote Native Americans in North Dakota at double the rate of everybody else don't have street addresses on their IDs they may not have street address at all that's just not how it works in many rural and reservation communities and so that was the big backhand from the republican-controlled North Dakota legislature after Native Americans prove themselves willing to vote for Democrats with disturbing frequency and after they provided high D height with the crucial enthusiasm and the crucial margin she needed to narrowly get elected to the United States Senate from North Dakota in 2012 new rule once she's in there no street address on your ID then you can't vote that affects Native Americans again at double the rate of other North Dakotans the law was initially blocked by a federal judge republican-controlled republican-controlled legislature then rewrote the law to get around the judge's ruling under the second iteration of the law you still couldn't vote like everybody else did if your ID doesn't have a street address but in order to account for that judge's ruling they said okay okay you would be given a provisional ballot that sounds better until you get to the part where they decided that your provisional ballot will never be counted unless and until you show up with an ID that has a street address on it which of course you don't have or they wouldn't have made you use the provisional ballot in the first place what North Dakota Republicans did is fire a heat-seeking missile to nuke the Native American vote in their state Native American vote in their stage is really democratic they're a red state the only way a Democrats gonna get through is with concentrated Native American support in the community is most likely to provide large numbers of Democratic votes you got to appeal statewide you got appealed everybody but when it comes to mobilizing people you were almost sure gonna vote for you if the Republicans can turn off the Native American vote if they can end that they can run the table they don't have to worry about there being any US senators from the Democratic Party there has been legal wrangling over this voter suppression effort in North Dakota for years now that legal wrangling that back and forth in the courts on with the legislature that means that in addition to just this blunt effort by the legislature to cut off the Native American vote there's also been a lot of confusion in the state because there's been this legal fight back and forth with all these different iterations of the law and all these different court rulings because of that legal wrangling IDs with p.o box addresses they were accepted as OK for voting as recently as this year's primaries June of this year just because there were ongoing legal fights over this but now the fights are over the Supreme Court has way in on this the conservative majority in the Supreme Court has now said this North Dakota law is good to go ahead and so now next month 22 days from now in the general election the tight camp seat up for the first time if you show up in North Dakota with your tribal ID with your p.o box on it just like you've always used before you will be turned away and not allowed to vote and so now 22 days out from the election one of the most critical races in the entire country which may determine whether or not the Senate is controlled by the Democrats or the Republicans which honestly may decide everything and Republican pox queues me in American politics for the next couple of years now on this short timeframe now there is a scramble underway to try to protect Native Americans right to vote in that crucial race the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe man named Mike faith put out this blistering statement quote Native Americans can live on the reservation without an address they're living in accordance with the law and treaties but now all of a sudden they can't vote our voices should be heard and they should be heard fairly at the polls just like all other Americans quote there is no good reason that a pol Box address is not sufficient to vote this law clearly discriminates against Native Americans in North Dakota Jaime Azure is the tribal chairman of the Turtle Mountain band of Chippewa Indians that's actually the group that sued to stop the law after the republican-led legislature put it first in place he tells NPR that the law and its timing might actually have an unintended effect quote it has already unified the tribes in North Dakota now we are working together we are members of this US government and we are not gonna let you keep us down we are gonna figure out a way to go over the barriers that have been put in front of us and this unified movement moving forward with the tribes that's gonna jump our percentages up with that native vote that same tribal chairman told reporters today that he signed an executive order to provide free tribal IDs new free tribal IDs to all members of his tribe IDs that will be newly and quickly reconfigured to add street addresses that they've never had before after signing that executive order to provide these free tribal IDs chairman Escher told reporters today that demand was so high from members of his tribe that the machine they bought to produce the IDs quote overheated and started melting them 22 days out all over the country we are seeing a blitz by Republicans wherever they are in power whenever they're empowering the county-level whenever they're in power is legislature whenever they're in power secretaries of state and governor's we're seeing a nationwide blitz by Republicans to tilt the playing field to run elections to administer democracy in a way that is maximally inconvenient or just flat-out suppressive of likely Democratic voters it's not like we didn't see it coming but I think because we did see it coming you were also seeing an incredible organizing effort a scramble and honestly just a lot of rage on the other side to push back and to beat them at this 22 days stay with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just
