1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,330
let's be honest this week Sean Hannity
one and the rest of America lost the pro

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,500
Trump media led by Hannity has circled
the wagons around President Trump

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,519
they've distracted people about the
truth involving Trump's Russia ties and

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,779
they've done everything possible to
destroy faith in Robert mullahs probe

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,130
and look Hannity won at work you gotta
give him credit where it's due

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,779
Hannity gave a megaphone to the GOP
congressmen who said they had a smoking

7
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,250
gun memo proving a deep state conspiracy
against Trump

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,660
Hannity hyped it night after night after
night in January like a human countdown

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,300
clock we have massive breaking news
tonight the biggest frankly we have ever

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,239
reported on about the Russia
investigation and they will make

11
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,039
Watergate look like an insignificant
blimp on your radar a source is telling

12
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,989
me this is going to all be proven right
I have a message tonight for the special

13
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,379
counsel robert muller your witch hunt is
now over it is the biggest national

14
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,320
scandal by far in our lifetime what we
are in covering uncovering here is far

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,820
worse than Watergate people need to be
held accountable

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,320
Trump reportedly watched that and loved
it and he told aides the memo needed to

17
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,850
come out because it would undermine
Muller and on Friday we all saw the

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,170
coverage it was never gonna live up to
the hype when you've got Hannity talking

19
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,619
about this being Watergate times a
thousand but the noise around the memo

20
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,729
doesn't make much sense anyway
Devon Nunez alleges surveillance abuses

21
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,900
even though he recently voted to support
greater surveillance powers and the

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,159
timeline doesn't make much sense either
but come on when you're trying to

23
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,189
confuse people that doesn't matter all
the questions all the headlines all the

24
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,820
doubt all the curiosity all the concern
that was the point to get it on the

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,430
front page to sow doubt in division that
was the point and look at cable news the

26
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,788
nation's deep divide was visible in
prime time there is new vital

27
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,330
information that is even more damning
more damaging than any

28
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:21,490
we've told you so far this is Watergate
times a thousand that's it that's all

29
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:28,930
they've got Nunez hinted that there's
more to come that this is just the tip

30
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,200
of the iceberg you know what the only
thing better than one WAC memo more wack

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,320
memos there it is that's a preview of
what's coming next GOP congressmen are

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,060
promising more memos more revelations
and Fox is already telling people to

33
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,070
stay tuned meanwhile MSNBC is already
making fun of it but you know the memo

34
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,150
this entire memo thing I know it's
confusing but it gives the Hannity's of

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,800
the world an alternative reality to live
in it gives Trump a way to say he's

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,150
vindicated even though he's not it lets
Trump allies say Muller's probe is

37
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,800
tainted and needs to be shut down it
allows them to turn every claim around

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,820
on its head collusion yeah there was
collusion by the Democrats obstruction

39
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,980
yeah the Dems obstructed it's it's like
that old childhood schoolyard taunt I'm

40
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,220
rubber you're glue whatever you say
bounces off of me and sticks to you now

41
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,030
the current in vogue talking point is
there is an important investigation

42
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,150
going on but it's not the investigation
into Russian interference in the

43
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,760
election it's the investigation into the
FBI that's the alternative reality and

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,900
look this campaign of confusion is good
for anity his ratings are way up it's

45
00:03:40,900 --> 00:00:00,000
good for Trump as well but it's bad for
the country
