00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,160
Scott thank you for being<font color="#E5E5E5"> with us this</font>

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,369
morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mid-cap growth portfolio</font>

3
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,800
what are your current<font color="#CCCCCC"> weightings sectors</font>

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">well cool wings to me we are a growth</font>

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,480
portfolio so we're focused on the growth

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,650
areas of the economy particularly

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,449
technologies probably a quarter of the

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,580
fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare another ten twelve</font>

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,619
percent we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little over waiting</font>

10
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">and energy right now but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those are the</font>

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,059
big big areas of focus right now it's no

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,950
surprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I t is is one of the</font>

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,360
bigger parts of the fun what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are your</font>

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,329
favorite stocks in that and why well

15
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,670
we're diversified within that group

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,559
because we think there are so attractive

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,660
areas a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of our bigger holdings</font>

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,670
one into it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think everyone's familiar</font>

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,239
with TurboTax but you know Microsoft is

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,010
getting out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft money which</font>

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,170
should be a real good upside for

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">QuickBooks for into it so that's one</font>

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,760
example another company we like is

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">american tower again there's a the</font>

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,960
cellular area a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3g requirements a</font>

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,670
lot more data required which means

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,229
there's a lot more equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up on</font>

28
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,720
towers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> american tower is kind of</font>

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,570
like a hotel company or a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> estate</font>

30
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,340
company you know the more things that

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">get on the tower the better for them is</font>

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,909
every piece of equipment you put up or

33
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,950
every new operator is more revenue for

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,720
them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's another example there are</font>

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,430
there any ideas in the fun that are

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,020
contrarian<font color="#E5E5E5"> to popular views on the</font>

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,799
street in tech<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,220
when are not not significant areas in

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,860
within technology within the portfolio i

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,600
think we probably have a little contrary

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,439
and view within the energy area<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,450
we are fairly bullish on energy it's

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,750
been a good area lately<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font>

44
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">other area that we're private contrary</font>

45
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,799
was we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we are starting to get pretty</font>

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,930
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the consumer area i think</font>

47
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,909
you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are concerned</font>

48
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,060
unemployment still ten percent but going

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next year there's a lot of</font>

50
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,149
company management teams<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm talking to</font>

51
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,709
who who had taken away<font color="#CCCCCC"> 401k bonuses you</font>

52
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">name it the last few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years well that's</font>

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to come back</font>

54
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,260
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's going to be even</font>

55
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,850
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> we won't have a lot of new people</font>

56
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the workforce the current</font>

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,820
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> work force me to get a lot</font>

58
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,950
more money<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next year so are you</font>

59
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about consumer discretionary or</font>

60
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,550
staples or was primarily the

61
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,610
discretionary I think as we go into next

62
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,800
year as I mentioned several the company

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,540
management teams have you know either

64
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,420
stopped putting money into 401 k's for

65
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,850
people a year ago they stopped accruing

66
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,560
bonus plans there were ten percent

67
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,000
salary cuts well a lot of that's going

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,940
to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so there will be some</font>

69
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,380
consumers that feel better<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

70
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves and I think that'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take up</font>

71
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,280
consumer confidence for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,110
particular individual they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

73
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,850
spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> some more money so I know I think</font>

74
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are a bit underweight health care</font>

75
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,280
has reformed talk in Washington impacted

76
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,140
how you think about that sector yeah it

77
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,300
certainly has you know particularly the

78
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,490
managed care area you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

79
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know what's going to happen how</font>

80
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">much the government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to take</font>

81
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">control or manage insurance rates so</font>

82
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,550
that's an area we've been very concerned

83
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mid cap it's a bigger part of the</font>

84
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
universe we select from so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,100
underweight that group so given the

86
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,019
run-up in the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously I believe</font>

87
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the mid-cap names have performed</font>

88
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,450
the larger cap names um what is the

89
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,130
biggest risk to investors at current

90
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,989
levels I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a rebound</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

91
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,720
factored in what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we gonna be seeing</font>

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">going into 2010 here well i think i</font>

93
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">think if you rewind back to when the</font>

94
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,280
meltdown occurred a year ago I think the

95
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,320
mid-cap stocks took it on the chin maybe

96
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,970
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than others and they were the worst</font>

97
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,010
performing asset class in the downturn

98
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,840
last year and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons where I</font>

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,150
think these were fairly heavily hedge

100
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,299
fund held as a percentage versus small

101
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,580
or large hedge<font color="#E5E5E5"> funds at a pretty big</font>

102
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,820
chunk of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid cap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so as a lot of</font>

103
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,500
outflows occurred from those<font color="#CCCCCC"> funds</font>

104
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,750
postdocs got punished the most and I

105
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,390
think into this year the valuations were

106
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,739
much more attractive so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

107
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,209
got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest rebound and it got</font>

108
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">mid-cap funds up near forty percent the</font>

109
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,440
benchmarks up near forty percent so huge

110
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">rebound in that group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward the</font>

111
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,220
biggest risk is valuation and where

112
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,959
expectations are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think right now</font>

113
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,728
earnings growth should be good as you go

114
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">into early next year and the comp</font>

115
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,200
yep the cops are easier the issue is

116
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,040
going to be everyone's going to be

117
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,630
worried about when is the Fed going to

118
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,950
start to take money out of the system

119
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,840
you know reduce liquidity and that's

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for P evaluation so you</font>

121
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,310
kind of got ease going up the issue is

122
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">how much is the market going to pay for</font>

123
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,570
those ease so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pease could be coming down</font>

124
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,190
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year so you can have that struggle</font>

125
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,530
between earnings growth and contracting

126
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,120
valuations and we think that's the

127
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,740
that's the risk for next year<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotcha</font>

128
00:04:45,740 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy sure</font>
