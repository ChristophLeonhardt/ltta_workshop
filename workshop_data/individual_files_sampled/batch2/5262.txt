long before his presidency years before he even announced Donald Trump cut his teeth as a public bully on Twitter largely by repeatedly harassing Rosie he honed his craft in that seven years and seventy tweets later Trump has taken that brand of antagonism and misogyny worldwide just this week Trump the President of the United States called the woman he allegedly cheated on the first lady with horseface and to make matters worse new reporting suggests that wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision that a mad beast reports quote privately the president not only thought that it was strategically smart to go after the adult film star stormy Daniels in such a visceral way he workshopped the insult prior to tweeting it well before Trump mocked Daniels physical appearance he trial balloon to the horse face Digg privately among White House aides close friends and acquaintances one source close to trunk even recalled him saying in passing that bleeping horse face Steve Rosie and Eugene are still here I read these things and I'm shocked but I'm guessing you or not I'm not sure no he'll do anything and everything to get what he wants and women are of no value to him in his life a world the only one who is I think is his daughter that's it the rest of the women in the world are useless as the immigrants that he says are coming from you know Honduras to take us in caravans watch out for the caravan there people walking away from certain death in third-world countries right this the the man doesn't care at all so what he did to stormy Daniels was horrific what he did to me was horrific but I expected when that was happening the national organization of women or something would come out and say you can't do this you're not just allowed to pick a woman light and Jen you know does the base her with impunity but he is mm-hmm he is and he gets laughs for it and it's it's like a bad stand-up comic I want to ask you because this question goes around around questions of race we talked about this after Charlotte's fell that now the KKK you've talked about this the KKK members don't wear sheets over their face that hit the Trump effect is that people are out of the closet with their misogyny they're out of the closet with their racism do you see that I mean I see that is potentially the most corrosive impact yes I think it's really true I was in the street the other day and some guys saw me with my new haircut and goes hey you you look like Dyke I was like to my face yeah right the same thing the corseting of the brazier in my whole career as you people trash you behind your back say something to your face right but the culture now is that this is what's happening he has degraded the culture more impactfully more quickly than any person in the history of this country anymore not you think about me sitting in the Oval Office office that Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt would meet in planning the fall of Nazism and victory for World War two or Barack Obama meditating before the raid on bin Laden or Ronald Reagan or John Kennedy during the Missile Crisis and you think about these people yeah sitting around plotting how to insult stormy Daniels it may be the single greatest refutation to the theory of evolution in the history it is it is amazing the power is incredible this is a terrible awesome in the original meaning of the word demonstration of the power of the President to give people that sort of permission to to to to sort of shred the veneer of lightness in CSUN see and respect that that we had and that we need in order to get along its must-have for the culture to look up to for the Constituent civilization this is this is essential for Democrats to understand I think there is a difference between toughness which they surely need and meanness doesn't mean they're not the same thing they need a tough-as-nails candidate who will stand for what's right and what's good and what's decent they don't need somebody to add to the cruelty into the vileness and there's a reason for it they want to run a dishonesty campaign against Donald Trump they lose because no one beats Donald Trump in a disguise they want to run a vileness campaign against Donald Trump guess what they lose again because it's not possibly more vile than this let me ask you about that because in the Democratic Party there's there's a faux debate going on that Eric Holder said when they go low you kick on Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high I think the problem isn't that they have two different views on that it's that Democrats think they have to resolve it why can't you have both candidates in the Democratic Party why can't you have fighters and States women yes why are the demo I mean this is where I think Democrats go wrong they're trying to play by the old rules yeah where you have to I mean when we ran campaigns you had to you had you lived and died by the fact-checker and if the political political fact-checker put the brakes on your ad we were screwed and so we made sure our ads would hold up and if they were on the line people like Steve and I would go to the ad people and say take that image out it won't hold up those rules are gone and and part of the problem with Democrats seems to be the plank that they're playing by the old rules yeah well they're playing by the old rules but what you said earlier about you know 435 House races there are you know there are all these Senate races and they're difficult there is not this is not a presidential year it's not a year when you have have to have one person dominating the party and that that specific message in all its particulars is the message of the party that happens in presidential years that doesn't happen in midterm years so you know is that to deal with this before this is new to the whole entire world or cover it yes and and how are we going to recover that's what I keep thinking of when he's finally out you know at the end of September when those indictments drop and when justice is finally served how are we gonna heal this nation how is it even going to be possible to do that I like your optimism my justice is served
