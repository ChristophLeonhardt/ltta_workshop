00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:10,365
ISRAEL'S GOVERNMENT.

4
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:12,901

WE ARE IN JERUSALEM AND WE

13
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:28,217
ARE HERE TO STAY.

14
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:29,985
>> ISRAEL IS THE SOVEREIGN

15
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:30,686
NATION WITH THE RIGHT TO

16
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:32,454
DETERMINE ITS OWN CAPITAL.

17
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:33,989
THE SAME RIGHT THAT IS

18
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,591
ENJOYED BY EVERY OTHER

19
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:36,191
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

20
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:38,827

25
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,902
BURYING THE TWO STATE

26
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:48,237
SOLUTION KILLING THE HOPE OF

27
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:49,238
THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE IN

00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:50,572
THE MIDDLE EAST OF THE

29
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:53,375
POSSIBILITY OF PEACE.

30
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,343
>> Bret: IT WAS A CAMPAIGN

31
00:00:54,343 --> 00:00:55,310
PROMISE AND IT HAS BEEN

32
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,744
DELIVERED.

33
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:56,979
THE U.S. EMBASSY MOVED FROM

34
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:57,946
TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM.

35
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:58,914
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE

36
00:00:58,914 --> 00:00:59,882
FOLLOWED SUIT OR IN THE

00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:01,016

LONG OVERDUE MOVE MOVED

47
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:22,170
EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.

48
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,871
EVERY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD

49
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:24,940
HAVE THE RIGHT TO MOVE ITS

50
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,274
CAPITAL.

51
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:26,375
I SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO

I APPLAUD PRESIDENT TRUMP

54
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:29,878
FOR DOING.

55
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:30,846
SO OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE

56
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:32,381
HAD A REAL PROBLEM WITH IT,

57
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,783
INCLUDING MANY PALESTINIANS

58
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:36,685
TOOK TO THE STREETS TODAY.

59
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:37,819
SOME 40,000 PALESTINIAN

60
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:38,754
STAGED DEMONSTRATIONS ALONG

61
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:40,556
THE BORDER, MORE THAN 50

62
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:42,124
PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE

63
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:45,928
RIOTING THERE.

64
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:48,597
25 WOUNDED AND SOME OF THE

ARAB STREET WEIGHING IN ON

66
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:50,432
THAT AS WELL.

67
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:52,100
BRING IN PANEL STEVE HAYES

68

SECURITY SPOKESMAN MICHAEL

76
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:04,846
ANTON.

77
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:05,514
MICHAEL, LET ME START WITH

78
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:05,781
YOU.

79
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,049
THIS WAS THE PLAN FOR A LONG

80
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:07,449
TIME.

81
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,585
HAD IT GONE AS PLANNED, DO

82
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:09,985
YOU THINK?

83
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:11,386
>> IT'S MORE THAN A CAMPAIGN

84
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:11,720
PROMISE.

85
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,854
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS U.S.

86
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:14,790
LAW FOR, I THINK, 23 YEARS

87
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,791
PASSED IN 1995.

88
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,059
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS I

89
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:18,460
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

90
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,795
I THINK DRIVES MIDDLE

91
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:20,696
AMERICA, THE AVERAGE

92
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:21,730
AMERICAN CRAZY ABOUT

93
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,130
WASHINGTON.

94
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,099
CONGRESS PASSES A LAW WITH

95
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:24,800
OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN

96
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,133
SUPPORT.

97
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,268
PUTS A WAIVER PROVISION IN

98
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:27,636
IT SO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE

99
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:29,037
THROUGH THEIR ELECTED

100
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:29,838
REPRESENTATIVES IS THAT THIS

101
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:31,139
SHOULD HAPPEN.

102
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,474
AND EVIDENCE SIX MONTHS

103
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:35,477
EVERY PRESIDENT WAVES IT,

104
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:38,180
WAVES IT WAVES IT PRESIDENT

105
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,114
FINALLY FULFILLS THE TERMS

106
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:40,749
OF THE LAW AND YOU SAW THAT

107
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:41,116
YESTERDAY.

108
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:42,250
HE GOT SOME SUPPORT AND A

109
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,952
LOT OF HIS POLITICAL

110
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,420
DOMESTIC POLITICAL CRITICS

111
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,722
YOU KNOW LEVEL ALL KINDS OF

112
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,624
ACCUSATIONS AT HIM WHEN I

113
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:51,026
THOUGHT AS THE TERMS OF THE

114
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:52,094
LAW THIS IS BIPARTISAN

115
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:53,161
CONSENSUS FOR TWO DECADES.

116
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,997
>> ON THE BIGGER PICTURE,

117
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:56,465
MARA, ON THE MIDDLE EAST

118
00:02:56,465 --> 00:02:57,432
PEACE PROCESS AND WHERE THIS

119
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:58,934
GOES, WHAT DOES THIS DO TO

120
00:02:58,934 --> 00:02:59,234
THAT?

121
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:00,469
>> I THINK THAT'S THE BIG

122
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:00,836
QUESTION.

123
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:01,870
KIND OF NOW WHAT?

124
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,138
IT'S NOT UNLIKE GETTING OUT

125
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:04,272
OF THE IRAN DEAL.

126
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:05,273
OKAY, NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING

127
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,541
TO DO NEXT IN THE MIDDLE

128
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,509
EAST PEACE PROPOSAL FROM THE

129
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:08,210
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS YET

130
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,044
TO BE UNVEILED.

131
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,946
AS YOU HEARD, THE

132
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:11,647
PALESTINIAN LEADER THEY ARE

133
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:13,315
NOT INCLINED TO ENTER TALKS

134
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:13,582
NOW.

135
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:14,282
THEY FEEL THE UNITED STATES

136
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:15,984
IS NO LONGER AN HONEST

137
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:16,318
BROKER.

138
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:17,919
IT'S JUST TOTALLY ON

139
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,387
ISRAEL'S SIDE.

140
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,255
SO I THINK NOW THE BALL IS

141
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:21,189
IN THE PRESIDENT'S COURT.

142
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,457
AND HE HAS TO COME UP WITH

143
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:23,892
THE NEXT STEPS FOR MIDDLE

144
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,193
EAST PEACE IF THAT'S WHAT HE

145
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:25,494
WANTS.

146
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:26,695
IF HE JUST WANTED TO FULFILL

147
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,163
A CAMPAIGN PROMISE, HE HAS

148
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:30,098
CERTAINLY DONE THAT.

149
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:30,565
>> Bret: MOLLIE?

150
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:31,400
>> I THINK IT IS AWFUL TO

151
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,701
SEE WHAT WE SAW THE LOSS OF

152
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:33,869
LIFE WITH SO MANY

153
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:34,503
PALESTINIANS BEING KILLED

154
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:35,137
AND "THE WASHINGTON POST"

155
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:36,438
HAD REPORTED THAT THEY WERE

156
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:37,706
TOLD THAT HAMAS HAD TOLD

157
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:40,075
THEM THAT ISRAEL WAS NOT

158
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:41,810
MANNING THESE SITES ON THE

159
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,078
BORDER AND IT WAS CAUSING

160
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:44,680
PEOPLE TO RUSH AND IT WAS

161
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,248
FOUND THAT THEY WERE MANNED.

162
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:47,349
THAT IS SAD TO SEE.

163
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,950
IT'S NOT FUN TO WATCH.

164
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,085
IT IS ALSO TRUE THOUGH THAT

165
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:51,787
I THINK THAT THIS COULD, IN

166
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:53,188
THE LONG TERM, LEAD TO A

167
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:55,424
GREATER CHANCE FOR PEACE.

168
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,492
WE HAVE THE REALITY THAT

169
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:58,994
JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITAL OF

170
00:03:58,994 --> 00:03:59,361
ISRAEL.

171
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:00,796
AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

172
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:01,430
EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

173
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,664
AND IT'S TIME FOR

174
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:03,632
PALESTINIANS TO ACKNOWLEDGE

175
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:04,833
THAT AND THAT DEALING WITH

176
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,569
REALITY IS A GOOD WAY TO GET

177
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,237
MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS A PEACE

178
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,839
AGREEMENT WHICH PEOPLE HOPE

179
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:11,173
FOR.

180
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:11,640
>> Bret: STEVE?

181
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,774
>> THERE ARE OTHER THINGS

182
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:13,675
TAKING PLACE BEHIND THE

183
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,444
SCENES AROUND THE

184
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:16,077
SUBTERRAINIAN LEVEL THAT

185
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,480
SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SOME

186
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,514
MOVE TOWARD PEACE.

187
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:20,716
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

188
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,684
TALKS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT

189
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:23,919
OF PUBLIC EYE.

190
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,087
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE

191
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,290
SAUDIS OR THE SUPPORT-OUT

192
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,325
THE COMMON VALUES ON THE

193
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:31,359
IRAN DEAL BETWEEN ISRAEL AND

194
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,663
THE SAWEDIES, U.S. AND UAE.

195
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,765
THE BAHRAINYS STEPPING UP

196
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:39,935
AND SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THE

197
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:41,403
WITHDRAWAL OF THE IRAN DEAL.

198
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:42,571
THIS GETS A LOT OF HEADLINE

199
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:43,271
US PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF

200
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:44,473
THE LOCALS OF LIFE THERE ARE

201
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:45,941
OTHER INDICATIONS THAT ARE

202
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:47,576
MUCH MORE POSITIVE AND THIS

203
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:48,777
IS SOMETHING THAT DONALD

204
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:50,212
TRUMP CAMPAIGNED ON.

205
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:51,480
THIS SOMETHING THAT HE SAID.

206
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,948
I THINK MIKE IS EXACTLY

207
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:53,248
RIGHT.

208
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:54,649
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

209
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:55,917
HAD PRESIDENTS OF BOTH

210
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,486
PARTIES SAYING FOR LITERALLY

211
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:58,787
DECADES AND THEY DIDN'T DO

212
00:04:58,787 --> 00:04:59,054
IT.

213
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:00,555
HE DID IT.

214
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:01,356
>> Bret: THE EQUATION OF

215
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:02,290
PULLING OUT OF THE IRAN

216
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,325
DEAL, THEN MOVING THE

217
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:05,193
EMBASSY AND THOSE TWO THINGS

218
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,995
TOGETHER, HOW DO THEY

219
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:07,395
INTERCHANGE?

220
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:08,363
HOW DO THEY INTERLOCK?

221
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:09,965
HOW DO THEY AFFECT EACH

222
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:10,265
OTHER?

223
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:11,299
>> WELL, THINK THAT I, FIRST

224
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:12,534
OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO

225
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,870
FOLLOW UP ON A POINT THAT

226
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,175
STEVE MADE THERE.

227
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,611
I THINK WHEN YOU MISSED AN

228
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:23,245
OPPORTUNITY, I DON'T THINK

229
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:24,312
THIS IS REALLY THE

230
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:25,280
PALESTINIANS MISSING THE

231
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,680
OPPORTUNITY.

232
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,581
REALLY THE PALESTINIANS THAT

233
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,649
NEED TO COME BACK TO THE

234
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:27,983
TABLE.

235
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:28,817
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT

236
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:29,117
HERE.

237
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,619
IF THE PALESTINIANS, IF

238
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:31,586
MAHMOUD ABBAS WOULD COME

239
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:32,721
BACK AND TALK TO THIS

240
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:33,321
ADMINISTRATION AND THIS

241
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:34,256
PRESIDENT AND SIT DOWN, I

242
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:37,359
THINK HE WOULD FIGHT

243
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,827
INCREDIBLE WILLINGNESS AND

244
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:40,095
EAGERNESS TO GET A DEAL

245
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:40,395
DONE.

246
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:41,129
I HAVE HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP

247
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,564
TALK ABOUT THIS SOME TIMES

248
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:44,733
THERE SAN OLD SAYING GOES

249
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:45,700
AROUND WASHINGTON PEOPLE WHO

250
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,468
HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE

251
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:47,569
THAT THE PALESTINIANS NEVER

252
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,537
MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MISS

253
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:49,204
AN OPPORTUNITY.

254
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:50,038
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE

255
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:50,639
DOING NOW.

256
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,573
I THINK IT'S ALSO

257
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:52,240
INTERESTING THAT WHAT YOU

258
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,074
ARE SEE SOMETHING A LOT OF

259
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:54,476
THIS IS COMING OUT OF GAZA,

260
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:55,644
WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY HAMAS

261
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,045
AND RUN BY HAMAS, RIGHT?

262
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:59,314
AND YOU ARE NOT SEEING THIS

263
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:00,148
INTENSITY COME OUTS OF THE

264
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:00,615
WEST BANK.

265
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:02,217
THIS IS CLEARLY BEING GINNED

266
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:03,251
UP FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES

267
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:04,452
AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS SO

268
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:05,020
CONCERNED.

269
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,422
LOOK, WHAT'S ONLY A COUPLE

270
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:08,089
WEEKS AGO THAT THE WHITE

271
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,424
HOUSE HOSTED A CONFERENCE ON

272
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:11,159
THE FUTURE OF GAZA AND HOW

273
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:11,927
TYPICALLY PROVE ITS

274
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,428
INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPROVE

275
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:14,663
THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE.

276
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:15,964
GOT THE GULF ARAB STATES TO

277
00:06:15,964 --> 00:06:17,365
SHOW UP AND, YOU KNOW,

278
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:18,099
PLEDGE SOME AID.

279
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,134
THESE ARE STATES THAT DON'T

280
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,836
LIKE TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER

281
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:21,870
IN SOME RESPECTS BECAUSE OF

282
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,938
THE DISPUTE IN THE GULF.

283
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:23,905
AND DON'T LIKE TO BE IN THE

284
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,473
SAME ROOM WITH ISRAELI

285
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:25,941
REPRESENTATIVES.

286
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:26,608
AND THEY WERE ALL THERE.

287
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:28,043
I THINK THAT WAS NEVER

288
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,110
POSITIVE AND HOPEFUL SIGN.

289
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,445
IF ONLY THE PALESTINIANS

290
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:31,546
WOULD EMBRACE THE

291
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:32,247
POSSIBILITIES THAT PRESIDENT

292
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:33,715
TRUMP IS OPENING UP FOR

293
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:34,082
THEM.

294
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:34,616
>> Bret: I GUESS THE

295
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:36,484
QUESTION IS DOES THE ARAB

296
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:37,452
STREET CHANGE NOW BECAUSE OF

297
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:38,620
THE DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP

298
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,054
WITH THE TRUMP

299
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:39,888
ADMINISTRATION AND THE GULF

300
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:40,689
STATES AS FAR AS HOW THEY

301
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,090
REACT TO BOTH THINGS, THE

302
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,525
IRAN DEAL AND THIS MOVE?

303
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,627
>> THERE IS -- DOES SEEM A

304
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:46,361
RESHAPING IN THE MIDDLE EAST

305
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,963
FROM WHAT WE HAD SEEN IN THE

306
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:48,663
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WITH

307
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:51,566
AN EFFORT TO MAKE IRAN MORE

308
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,668
DOMINANT AND THE I-BUT I

309
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:55,503
THINK IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN

310
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:57,706
HOW THEY RESPOND.

311
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:58,139
>> Bret: MARA?

312
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,140
I COME BACK TO THIS QUESTION

313
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,275
IF THE UNITED STATES IS

314
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:01,576
GOING TO BE THE LEADER AND

315
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,011
IS GOING TO PUT FORWARD A

316
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,212
PEACE PLAN THAT NEEDS TO DO

317
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:04,512
THAT.

318
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:05,513
THE PALESTINIANS WILL COME

319
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:06,815
TO THE TABLE IF THEY SEE A

320
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:07,983
GOOD PLAN WHERE THEY THERE

321
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:09,484
IS SOMETHING IN IT FOR THEM.

322
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:10,752
RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T KNOW

323
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:11,519
WHAT IT IS.

324
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,221
>> FOR YEARS, MIDDLE EAST

325
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,155
PEACE HAS BEEN USED AS

326
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:15,257
SOMETHING TO BLOCK PROGRESS

327
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:17,058
IN OTHER AREAS IN THE

328
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:17,392
REGION.

329
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:19,194
IF R. YOU KNOW THE FOREIGN

330
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:20,095
POLICY ESTABLISHMENT SAYS

331
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:21,296
YOU HAVE TO SOLVE MIDDLE

332
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:22,430
EAST PEACE FIRST AND THEN

333
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,132
YOU CAN ADDRESS THREATS FROM

334
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:26,201
IRAQ AND ADDRESS JIHADDISM

335
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:27,636
AND IRAN AND ALL THESE OTHER

336
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:27,969
THINGS.

337
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,771
I THINK THIS SENDS A MESSAGE

338
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,139
PRETTY CLEARLY THAT'S NOT

339
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,208
GOING TO BE

340
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:33,241
GOING OO BE

341
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:33,275
GOING OBSBE

342
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,075
GOING OBSTACLE ANYMORE.

343
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:35,477
TAKE THAT AND SET TE'O SIDE

344
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:36,544
AND DEAL WITH THREATS FROM

345
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:40,148
IRAN ON REALISTIC.

346
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:40,749
>> Bret: CHANGES THE

347
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:42,083
PARADIGM AND STARTING POINT?

348
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,885
>> BRIT SET IT EARLIER IN

349
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:45,253
THE SHOW YOU ARE DEALING

350
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,622
WITH REALITY HERE.

351
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:48,857
MORE REALISTIC LOOK HOW THE

352
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:50,058
MIDDLE EAST SUN FOLDING.

353
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:51,593
KEEP IN MIND IRAN IS A BIG

354
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:52,227
SUPPORTER OF HAMAS.

355
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:53,495
A LOT OF THE WEALTH THAT

356
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:54,696
IRAN IS ABLE TO TAKE IN

357
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,398
BECAUSE OF THE IRAN DEAL ON

358
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:57,432
FROZEN ASSETS AND THE WEALTH

359
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:58,600
THEY WERE ABLE TO GENERATE

360
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,801
BY BEING ALLOWED TO DO

361
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:00,936
BUSINESS WITH COUNTRIES THAT

362
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:01,903
USED TO SANCTION THEM, THEY

363
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:03,705
ARE SPENDING THAT TO

364
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:05,140
DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST

365
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,775
AND FUND TERROR.

366
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,443
FUNNELING TO HAMAS AND OTHER

367
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:09,144
GROUPS LIKE THIS.

368
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:09,878
HOPEFULLY WITH THE U.S. OUT

369
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:10,812
OF THE IRAN DEAL.

370
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:11,880
PERHAPS SOME NEW SANCTIONS

371
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,014
AND OTHER SECONDARY

372
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:13,982
SANCTIONS GOING BACK INTO

373
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:15,116
EFFECT, SOME OF THAT

374
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:16,284
RESOURCE FUNNEL GETS CHOKED

375
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:17,819
OFF, GETS REDUCED AND IRAN

376
00:08:17,819 --> 00:00:00,000
DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES
