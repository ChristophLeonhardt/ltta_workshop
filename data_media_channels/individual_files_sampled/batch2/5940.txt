it's an extraordinary moment I don't know what else to say the day was petering out the crowd was thinning out they're gonna crowd down at the Supreme Court that's okay down there where you see on the sidewalk for hours making speeches cheering anti chavin Cavanaugh chanting and then running let's turn around and look at them at the door here and then this moment just as they did at the Capitol rushing to the top of the steps of the Supreme Court and now besieging the front door of the Supreme Court I don't recall ever seeing of seeing like this obviously a lot of passion in this crowd whether or not this carries over to November is a distinction that nobody is really concerned with it the minute it's getting hard to hear in here as we wade into the crowd but just an extraordinary moment joy a capping two weeks of civil action of civil unrest of protesters grunting senators as they walk through the halls with the Russell building the Hart building the Dirk's Dirksen building in restaurants this is the culmination of all of that an outpouring of raw emotion and anger on the part of these protesters choice hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
