1
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:07,063
AND DANA PERINNO.

2
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:08,931
WITH THE FIVE.

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:11,467
AND KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE.

4
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:14,136
SEE ROSEANNE DISAPPEARED FASTER

5
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:16,572
THAN A CLASSIFIED E-MAIL ON

6
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:17,840
A SERVER.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,011
ABC SAW THE HANDWRITING AND ONE

8
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:23,946
STOP LIQUIDATION WHILE YOU WAIT.

9
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:27,183
I AM KIND OF SAD, BUT I AM

10
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:27,550
SHOCKED.

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,087
NOT FOR ROSEANNE, I AM SAD THAT

12
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:33,389
THE EXPERIMENT FAILED.

13
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,291
WHY DID IT INTRIGUE US?

14
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,026
THE SHOW WAS A MESS.

15
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:40,229
IT WAS NOT BECAUSE WE LOVED

16
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,100
ROSEANNE, WE KNEW SHE WAS NUTTY.

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,169
BUT MAYBE IT SIGNALLED PROGRESS

18
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:50,873
WHERE THE PROS AND CONS CAN

19
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:51,907
BREAK BREAD.

20
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:55,344
BUT NOT ANYMORE AND THE WORLD

21
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:57,546
MOVES ON TO WHO EVER IS NEXT.

22
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:59,648
>> WE KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP

23
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,082
THINKS.

24
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:03,385
WE KNOW WHAT ROSEANNE BARR

25
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:03,752
THINKS.

26
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:05,588
IT IS RACIST.

27
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:07,690
THEY ARE EXHIBITING RACIST

28
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,090
BEHAVIOR.

29
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,725
>> IT WAS A GREAT MOVE

30
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:10,126
YESTERDAY.

31
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:11,794
THE THING THAT IS THE BACKGROUND

32
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,629
OF ALL OF THIS, THE PRESIDENT

33
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:15,564
CAN BE RACIST AND NOTHING

34
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:17,366
HAPPENS TO HIM.

35
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:22,771
>> ROSEANNE'S SHOW WAS CANCELLED

36
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:25,508
BECAUSE SHE TWEETED OUT RACIST

37
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:25,841
STUFF.

38
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:27,076
>> I BLAME DONALD TRUMP.

39
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:29,478
>> TENS OF MILL COMBRONS OF

40
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,514
PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM.

41
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:32,648
>> ARE THEY RACIST?

42
00:01:32,648 --> 00:01:34,950
ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,285
DONALD TRUMP IS RACIST?

44
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:37,953
>> YES, YES.

45
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:39,922
>> THE DISCOURSE IS OVER AND THE

46
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:43,659
LEFT TAKES THE IDIOTIC WORD FZ

47
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:47,096
ONE PERSON AND BLAMES IT ON

48
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:47,496
MILLIONS.

49
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:49,064
IT IS ABOUT THE LEFT EXPANDING

50
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:52,434
THE TWEETS TO THE PRESIDENT AND

51
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:56,372
BY CONNECTION HALF OF AMERICA

52
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:59,008
WHICH RAISES A INTERESTING

53
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,310
QUESTION.

54
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,046
DID PRESIDENT OBAMA OWN

55
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:04,747
ROSEANNE'S BELIEF.

56
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:07,950
SHE BELIEVED THAT THE BOSTON

57
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,151
MARATHON WAS STAGED.

58
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:12,621
WAS THAT ON OBAMA WHEN SHE WAS

59
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:14,690
A HARD-CORE LEFTIST?

60
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,325
NO, THAT IS ABSURD.

61
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:19,195
BUT THE CURRENT MRAFRNGET OF

62
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,896
BLAME SUGGEST IT IS ALWAYS BEEN

63
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:22,498
THERE REGARDLESS WAS ROSEANNE.

64
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:24,934
IF IT WAS NOT HER, IT WOULD BE

65
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,235
SOMEONE ELSE.

66
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:28,404
THE LEFT DOESN'T NEED ROSEANNE

67
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:30,139
TO SMEAR YOU.

68
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,074
THEY ARE AT WAR ALREADY.

69
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:35,544
SHE'S BACK ON TWEETING AND YEAH,

70
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:35,945
YEAH.

71
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:39,181
I DON'T THINK SHE WILL GO

72
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:39,715
QUIETLY.

73
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:42,518
>> Dana: BUT SHE SAID I AM SORRY

74
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:43,953
I OFFENDED.

75
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:47,489
I AM OFF TWITTER AND THEN GOOD

76
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:47,790
BYE.

77
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,825
IT IS LIKE PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED

78
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,361
WITH TWITTER AND SELF WORTH IS

79
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,496
IN TWITTER.

80
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:57,700
>> Greg: ONE OF HER LATEST

81
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,067
TWEETS.

82
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:01,403
I WAS NOT A RACIST AND ONE

83
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:05,074
STUPID JOKE IN THE LIFETIME FOR

84
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:13,882
FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND IT

85
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:15,751
WEALTH WILL NEVER BE TAKEN FROM

86
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:16,051
ME.

87
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:20,122
SHE WAS A SOCIALIST.

88
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:25,594
>> Jesse: LEFT, AND RIGHT AND

89
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:30,065
THE OTHER.

90
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:32,334
GERALDO:  YOU MAY NOT COMPARE

91
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:35,371
A BLACK WOMEN TO CANAPE.

92
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,473
END OF DISCUSSION AND YOU GET

93
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:40,276
FIRED AND YOU NUANCING IT AND

94
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:42,077
BLAME THE PRESIDENT.

95
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:43,712
YOU TAKE AWAY THE

96
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:45,648
RESPONSIBILITY.

97
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:50,552
I AM GET OF DRUNK TWEETING.

98
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:52,554
BUT THE THING ABOUT DRUNK

99
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:55,057
TWEETING OR TOWELLING IT REVEALS

100
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:55,924
YOUR SOUL.

101
00:03:55,924 --> 00:04:00,362
I BELIEVE THAT DRUNKS ARE TRUE.

102
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:01,797
>> Greg: YOU ARE

103
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:03,032
A EXHIBITIONIST.

104
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:05,868
>> BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS,

105
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:09,004
A LINE YOU MAY NOT PASS OR SAY

106
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:11,407
WHAT SHE SAID AND WHAT DISTURBS

107
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:14,109
ME DEEPLY IS THAT I SHUTTER TO

108
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,812
THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT INFORMS

109
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:19,615
HER COMEDY AND HER POLITICS AND

110
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:22,418
I THINK ALL OF US HAVE TO

111
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:25,254
EXAMINE OUR OWN SOUL AND SAY

112
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:28,457
CRAP, BACK IN MY DAY, 1950S AND

113
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:31,193
IN LOCKER ROOMS YOU SAID A LOT

114
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:35,197
OF STUFF INTOLERABLE AND NO ROOM

115
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:39,401
FOR WIGGLING AND NO ROOM TO

116
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,970
NUANCE AND IT WAS A KILLING

117
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,539
MISTAKE SHE MADE AND I HOPE IT

118
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,575
WAS A MISTAKE AND DOESN'T REVEAL

119
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:47,609
HER TRUE SOUL.

120
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:51,814
DPREG GREG THIS IS SARAH SANDERS

121
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:53,148
TALKING ABOUT THE DOUBLE

122
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:53,549
STANDARD.

123
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:55,451
SHALL WE PLAY THAT.

124
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:59,221
>> THE PRESIDENT POINTED TO THE

125
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:01,357
MEDIA SAYING THE HORRIBLE THINGS

126
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,959
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND NO ONE

127
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,693
ADDRESSES IT.

128
00:05:04,693 --> 00:05:10,699
WHERE WAS BOB'S APOLOGY TO THE

129
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:16,872
PRESIDENT WHEN JAMAL CALLING

130
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:17,573
HIM.

131
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:20,609
AND CATHY GRIFFEN ON A PROFANE

132
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:22,244
RANT ON THE VIEW AFTER

133
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:25,280
A PHOTOSHOWED HER HOLDING

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,915
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECAPITATED

135
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:30,252
AND WHERE WAS THE APOLOGY FOR

136
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:32,755
SPEN SPIN HIRING KEITH OBER MAN

137
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:36,358
AS HE PORTRAYED THE PRESIDENT AS

138
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:41,296
A NAZI AND THIS IS A DOUBLE

139
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:44,266
STANDARD THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

140
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,769
SPEAKING B. THAT THEY ARE

141
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,237
INAPPROPRIATE AND THAT'S THE

142
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:51,874
POINT HE WAS MAKING.

143
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:54,343
>> Jesse: I LOVE THE DOUBLE

144
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:54,843
STANDARD GAME.

145
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:58,414
IT IS MY GO TO.

146
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:03,452
WHAT ABOUT--ISMS?

147
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:07,222
YOU CAN SAY BILL MARR SAID THE

148
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:09,658
WORD AND KEPT HIS JOB AND THEY

149
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:10,826
LIE ABOUT IT.

150
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:13,495
AND WE ALL KNOW REPUBLICANS HAVE

151
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,697
A SHORT LEASH WHEN IT COMES TO

152
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:17,633
THE MISTAKE.

153
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,802
DEMOCRATS WILL CIRCLE THE WAGON

154
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:23,705
AND GO FOR THE REPUBLICANS SCAL.

155
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,474
THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT.

156
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:27,976
GOING BACK TO ROSEANNE, THERE IS

157
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,579
A GREAT SCENE FROM THE OFFICE.

158
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,147
MICHAEL SCOTT SAID TO DWIGHT.

159
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:35,851
WHAT WAS THE MOST INSPIRING

160
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:37,719
THING I SAID TO YOU.

161
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,188
DON'T BE IDIOT.

162
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:43,192
WHEN I AM ABOUT TO DO TO DO

163
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:43,592
SOMETHING.

164
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:45,294
WOULD AN IDIOT DO THAT AND

165
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:47,629
THAT'S WHAT ROSEANNE SHOULD I

166
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:48,697
HAVE DONE.

167
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:50,532
SHE'S SELF DESTRUCTIVE AND

168
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:52,801
PEOPLE DO IT FOR DRUGS AND

169
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:55,504
PRESSURE OR RISK TAKERS.

170
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:57,673
CHARLIE SHEEN BLEW OFF HIS

171
00:06:57,673 --> 00:07:00,108
ENTIRE CAREER OVER NOTHING.

172
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:02,077
WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE PLANT TIME

173
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:05,147
BOMBS AND THE ME, TOO, MOVEMENT

174
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:08,050
FINDS THEM AND IT IS A SAD CASE.

175
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,153
IT IS IT SAD FOR NOT ONLY HER,

176
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:12,821
NOT REALLY HER BUT THE PEOPLE

177
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:14,022
INVOLVED IN THE SHOW.

178
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,058
AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE

179
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,659
DOUBLE STANDARD.

180
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,661
CHARLIE SHEEN, LIBERAL.

181
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:24,299
AND ALEC BALDWIN LIBBAL AND

182
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,669
CATHY GRIFFIN LOST HER JOB AT

CNN.

184
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,339
I DON'T KNOW IF THE DOUBLE

185
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:31,773
STANDARD ARGUMENT HOMEDS.

186
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:33,842
WHAT ABOUT THE MONTAGE OF PEOPLE

187
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:35,978
TAKING HER TWEET AND SAYING ALL

188
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:37,746
OF AMERICA IS RACIST.

189
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:40,749
>> Kimberly: THAT IS A LIBERAL

190
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:41,149
PLAYBOOK.

191
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:45,053
THEY TETHER IT TO THE PRESIDENT

AND TRY TO CREATE THIS

193
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:48,524
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANYBODY WHO

AND CAN'T BLAME EVERYTHING ON

201
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:02,170
AMBIENN.

00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,356
IT MUDDIED THE WATERS AND RIGHT

211
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:24,893
ON CUE.

212
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,194
MUDDY WATER.

>> Jesse: THAT WAS MY NICKNAME

214
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:29,398
IN COLLEGE.

215
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:30,933
MUDDY WATERS.

216
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,668
>> Kimberly: INTERESTING.

217
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:35,337
>> Greg: WILL NOT TELL YOU MY

218
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:37,005
NAME.

219
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:39,241
>> Kimberly: ROSEANNE SHOULD

220
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:42,711
QUIET DOWN AND YOU KNOW --

221
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:46,081
DPREG GREG I WANT TO BRING UP

222
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,650

223
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,721
>> THE PRESIDENT MISSED AN

224
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:53,422
OPPORTUNITY.

225
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,357
HERE IT WOULD BE SO EASY.

226
00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:56,992
YOU NEED MORE BLACK PEOPLE.

227
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:58,660
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY JUST

228
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,295
A PASSING PHRASE.

229
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:02,798
HE COULD SAY EVERYTHING HE SAID

230
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:05,801
AND START IT WITH THIS IS

231
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,102
ABHORRENT AND I DON'T CONDONE

232
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:10,138
THIS AND AS MUCH AS I LIKE HER

233
00:09:10,138 --> 00:09:12,407
COMEDY, IT WAS NOT FUNNY AND IT

234
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:14,676
WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR HIM TO

235
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:21,283
REACH OUT AND TO DENY THE

236
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:23,485
NAYSAYERS.

237
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:27,189
>> Greg: SHE BLAMED AMBIEN.

238
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:31,026
THEY RESPONDED.

239
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:34,763
ALL PHARMACEUTICALS HAVE

240
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,798
SIDE-EFFECTS BUT RACISM IS NOT

241
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:38,233
A SIDE EFFECT.

242
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:41,837
THERE ARE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

243
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:46,241
WITH AMBIEN AND ELECTRONICS.

244
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:48,143
>> Dana: I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM.

245
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:50,879
I DON'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

246
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,682
I HAVE A HARD TIME SLEEPING AND

247
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:55,617
I WOULD TAKE A HALF OF ONE.

248
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:57,519
YOU HAVE TO READ THE

249
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,354
SIDE-EFFECTS AND FOLLOW THE

250
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:01,023
ORDERS OF YOUR DOCTOR AND YOU

251
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:06,294
CAN DO STUPID OR FUNNY THINGS.

252
00:10:06,294 --> 00:10:09,197
>> Greg: I ATE MAYO OR PEANUT

253
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:09,865

254
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:15,637
>> Dana: THERE WAS A NEW YORK

255
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:19,341
AMBIEN ATE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

256
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:24,680
NIGHT DOUBLE STUFFED OREOS.

257
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,782
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU

258
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,216
A RACIST?

259
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:29,985
>> Kimberly: THE TINNING THAT

260
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:30,752
BOTHERS ME.

261
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:34,022
SHE SAID I WOULD APOLOGIZE YOU

262
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:37,826
DIDN'T GET MY JOKE AND NOW

263
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:41,096
SAYING I DIDN'T NEED TO

264
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:43,098
APOLOGIZE AND I TOOK ALCOHOL AND

265
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:46,501
AMBIEN AND MIXED THEM TOGETHER.

266
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:49,104
DPREG GREG I KNOW GERALDO, YOU

267
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:50,906

268
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:53,341
THIS IS NOT COMBUCHLT JIMMY THE

269
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:57,045
GREEK AND HOWARD COSLE AND WHAT

270
00:10:57,045 --> 00:10:59,681
HE SAID ABOUT ALVIN GARRETT.

271
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:02,918
BUT IT HAPPENS LIKE ONCE EVERY

272
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:05,487
THREE YEARS PEOPLE SCREW UP.

273
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:08,423
>> THE A STUFF AND LIKE THE N-

274
00:11:08,423 --> 00:11:08,757
WORD.

275
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:15,731
IT IS SO BLATANT AND RAW AND SO

276
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:18,767
DISGUSTINGLY ANTIQUATED AND AT

277
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:21,136
SOME POINT WHERE THE HELL IS

278
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:27,075
YOUR HEAD THAT YOU CONJURE THAT?

279
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:33,148
WHERE DID THAT SENTENCE COME

280
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:33,482
FROM?

281
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:36,084
TO PRETEND THIS OR THAT AND SORT

282
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:40,255
OF THE SAME OR THEY SHOULD HAVE

283
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:42,491
DONE THIS OR THAT?

284
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:48,463
THAT MISSES IT IS POINT.

285
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:49,898
>> Kimberly: THE MAINSTREAM

286
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:51,867

RESPONSIBLE FOR IT MAKES NO

289
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:58,306
SENSE AND CHEAPENS THE DIALOGUE

290
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:01,643
AND WHAT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS ON

291
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:03,378
INTOLERABLE RACISM.

292
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:05,514
>> Greg: THEY BLAME IT ON TRUMP.

293
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:08,984
>> Jesse: BERNIE SANDERS

SAID THAT.

298
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:24,366
>> Dana: IT WAS NOT ME.

299
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:26,067
ONE OF THE PRESIDENT COULD HAVE

300
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:31,306
OWNED THE MEDIA WAS TO TWEET

301
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,975
SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN A

302
00:12:33,975 --> 00:00:00,000
GREFIANCE FOR HIMSELF.
