Ask about VRAYLAR. Tucker: WE'VE SOUND THE ALARM ON THE SHOW OF THE DECREPIT STATE OF NEW YORK CITY'S PENN STATION. IT'S FILTHY, FULL OF WASTE AND WE SAID AS MUCH ON THE SHOW. HAVE YOU BEEN TO PENN STATION RECENTLY? IT'S LIKE A HOMELESS SHELTER IT'S DISGUSTING. YOUR GIVING SPEECHES, TRUMP IS BAD AND IGNORE THE GUY LIVING UNDER THE ATM MACHINE OR RELIEVING HIMSELF HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE MEN'S ROOM AT PENN STATION? TO OUR SURPRISE AND HAPPINESS, AMTRAK CALLED US AND SAID THEY HAD REVAMPED THE PLACE AND CLEANED UP ITS MEN'S ROOMS. WE WANTED TO SEE IF THAT WAS TRUE SO WE SENT THE INTREPID BRETT MARSON TO INVESTIGATE, HERE'S WHAT HE FOUND. IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET AN INVITE FOR AN EXCLUSIVE ONE-ON-ONE TOUR OF THE MEN'S BATHROOMS IN NEW YORK'S NESTORIUS PENN STATION, SO EAGER TO SHOW US THEIR NEWLY RENOVATED BATHROOMS, THEY THREW UP THE POLICE BARRICADES AND CLEARED OUT THE CUSTOMERS. AND HAD US MEET THEM AT 3:00 A.M. HOW COULD WE PASS THAT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WE GOT A VERY CLOSE UP AND PERSONAL DEMO OF THE NEW ALL IN ONE SINKS. YOU CAN SELECT THE WATER. TECHNOLOGY IS FUN. PENN STATION IS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS PROBLEM WITH HOMELESSNESS, THE DOWN AND OUT DRUG ABUSERS COME HERE EACH NIGHT, THE PLACE LITERALLY BECOMES A HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT IN THE WINTER. GUESS WHERE THEY GO TO BAIT EACH NIGHT, THAT'S WHEN WE NOTICED THE NEW SINK DESIGNS. THESE AREN'T VERY DEEP, I'M GUESSING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SPLASH WATER, YOU PROBABLY GOING TO SPLASH WATER IN YOUR FACE. NO CHANCE OF GETTING AN ARM OR LEG UNDER THAT THING. AMTRAK WAS EASIER TO TELL US HOW THEY EVOLVED, HOW PENN STATION IS BECOMING MORE OF A DESTINATION TRANSIT HUB AND LESS OF A THIRD WORLD ISLAM. YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT WAY OR HAVE THAT OPINION, YOU WANT TO INVOKE A GREAT EXPERIENCE THAT YOU'RE NOT ONLY COMING FROM THE TRAIN BUT YOU'RE GETTING OFF THE TRAIN AS WELL. THE JOURNEY DOESN'T END OFF THE TRAIN. EXIT THE FANCY NEW RESTROOMS. AND AT THE SAME INTIMIDATING PENN STATION. EXIT ON SEVENTH AVENUE, THERE'S PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR. OPPOSITE MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, THOUSANDS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE CAMPING OUT FOR THE NIGHT OTHERS SEEMINGLY UP TO NO GOOD AT ALL. NOT EVERYONE DISLIKES PENN STATION. IT'S A NICE STATION, GOOD FOR DEPARTURES, GOOD FOR DESTINATIONS. WE HAD ONE LAST QUESTION FOR THE AMTRAK GUY. IS THAT PART OF THE NOSTALGIA WAS MAKE IT ALWAYS SMELLS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE WALKING AROUND. WERE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING TO MAKE A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN THAT RESTROOM AS WELL AS THE WOMEN'S RESTROOM NEWLY RENOVATED AT PENN STATION. AS FOR THE REST OF PENN STATION, THAT TRANSIT HUB IN THE MIDDLE OF MANHATTAN ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY, ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE CITIES IN THE WORLD, IT IS STILL THE SAME OLD DUMP AS WE SAW AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S THREE IN THE MORNING OR THREE IN THE AFTERNOON OR RUSH HOUR, OR A WEEKEND DAY, PENN STATION IS ALWAYS DISGUSTING AND IT'S EMBARRASSING. WHEN YOU TAKE AMTRAK FROM D.C. YOU GET ON THAT BEAUTIFUL UNION STATION WHICH IS THIS GORGEOUS TRAIN STATION THAT'S BEEN RESTORED, GRAND CENTRAL STATION IF YOU GO IN THE MAIN HALL, YOU GET UP AT PENN STATION IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT SOME TERRIBLE HELL SCAPE AND MAYBE THE MONKEYS DID WIN, THE APES FROM "PLANET OF THE APES," YOU'RE WALKING OUT LIKE WHAT IS THIS? Tucker: WE SHOULD HAVE MORE SELF-RESPECT THAN THAT. IT'S EMBARRASSING, TOTALLY EMBARRASSING. CONGRATS TO AMTRAK FOR NEW BATHROOMS BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE
