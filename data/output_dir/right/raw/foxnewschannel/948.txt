THEY WANTED.

18
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:39,025
HOW SOURCES SAY THAT HE EVEN

19
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,227
THREATENED TO SUBPOENA THEIR

THEIR JOB?

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,674
>> YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

29
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:55,642
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WAS OFF

30
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:57,911

00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:59,946
LIVING IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT OF

DEVIN NUNES, THAT IS ONE OF

38
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:12,392
MISLEADING, OBSTRUCTING,

39
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:16,229
ATTEMPTING TO INTERVENE IN AN

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING

51
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:31,111
THESE MEETINGS HAVE BEEN

52
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:34,214
DESCRIBED AS CONTENTIOUS OFTEN,

53
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:36,282
NOT JUST IN THIS ONE INSTANCE.

54
00:01:36,282 --> 00:01:38,151
IS THIS A HEATED ROOM MUCH OF

55
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:41,021
THE TIME?

56
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:43,223

SOMETIMES TREY GOWDY.

60
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,232
BUT DEVON ALWAYS REPORTS BACK TO

61
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:53,166
US, THE STAFF PEOPLE DO IN THE

62
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,568
ACCOUNT THAT THEY GAVE THAT WHEN

63
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:56,870
THEY WERE TRYING TO GET

64
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,038
INFORMATION, WHICH WE ARE

65
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:59,873
ENTITLED TO, BY THE WAY, IT WAS

66
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:02,342
CONGRESS THAT CREATED THE

67
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:02,475
PROBLEM

68
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:06,613
THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE THE

69
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:12,085
INFORMATION AND FOR WHATEVER

70
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:12,819
REASON ROSENSTEIN REFUSED TO DO

71
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:13,086
IT.

72
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:13,787
AFTER ONE OF THESE MEETINGS IN

73
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:14,487
PARTICULAR IT GOT VERY HEATED

74
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:15,188
AND HE BASICALLY THREATENED

75
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:16,256
STAFF, THREATENING TO SUBPOENA

76
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:17,824
THEIR EMAILS, THEIR TEXT

77
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:19,192
MESSAGES, THEIR PHONE LOGS.

78
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:23,063
SHIRLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A

79
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:23,463
SHIRLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH T

80
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:23,496
SHIRLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A

81
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:24,230
SHIRLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH L

82
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,231
WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR

83
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:25,832
LEGITIMATE INFORMATION.

84
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:27,567
AN ABUSE OF POWER AND IT MAKES

85
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,402
YOU WONDER WHAT ARE THEY TRYING

86
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:29,736
TO HIDE?

87
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:31,671
>> Martha: ANDY McCARTHY

88
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:34,207
WROTE IT PIECE IN THE NATIONAL

89
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,076
REVIEW ABOUT THIS AND SAID THE

90
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:37,444
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IS

91
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:38,078
INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE

92
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:41,414
GOVERNMENT HAS USED THE JUSTICE

93
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:41,948
DEPARTMENT'S AWESOME

94
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:44,284
INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITIES AS A

95
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:44,918
WEAPON AGAINST A POLITICAL

96
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:47,320
ADVERSARY AND HE SAYS THAT THIS

97
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,655
TELLS HIM THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING

98
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:50,023
IS THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

99
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:50,957
IS THREATENING TO USE THEIR

100
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:52,726
AWESOME INVESTIGATIVE

101
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:53,493
AUTHORITIES AS A WEAPON AGAINST

102
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:55,261
POLITICAL ADVERSARIES.

103
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:58,031
IS THAT HOW YOU SEE IT?

104
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,032
>> UNWITTINGLY THEY ARE PROVING

105
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:00,834
OUR POINT THAT THEY DO ABUSE

106
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,469
THEIR POWER AND HAVE GONE WAY

107
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:02,969
BEYOND THEIR LANE.

108
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,105
I WOULD SAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

109
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:06,673
POINT OUT THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN, I

110
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:08,508
HAVE NOTHING AGAINST HIM

111
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:09,042
PERSONALLY.

112
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:11,311
I THINK HE HAS ACTED VERY WRONG

113
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:11,611
HERE.

114
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,314
HE IS THE ONE WHO SIGNED THE

115
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:15,215
FOURTH FISA APPLICATION.

116
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:17,550
HE'S THE ONE WHO SIGNED ONTO

117
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,252
THAT AND THERE ARE REAL

118
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:20,053
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WAS

119
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:21,020
CONTAINED IN THAT APPLICATION.

120
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,622
SO IN A WAY HE WAS ALSO BEING

121
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:23,890
INVESTIGATED HIMSELF.

122
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,759
I THINK HE SHOULD BE RECUSING

123
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,993
HIMSELF FROM THIS ENTIRE MATTER,

124
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:27,827
BUT IN ANY EVENT, HE HAS A

125
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:30,029
DOUBLE MOTIVE HERE.

126
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:32,232
NOT ONLY IS HE SOMEHOW DIGGING

127
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:33,633
IN TO PROTECT THE INSTITUTION

128
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:38,805
AGAINST CONGRESS, BUT HE ALSO

129
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:41,407
APPLICATION WHICH HE SIGNED ONTO

130
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:42,242
AND WE BELIEVE THERE ARE

131
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:43,042
IRREGULARITIES IN THAT

132
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:43,443
APPLICATION.

133
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:45,445
>> Martha: HOW DO YOU SEE THIS

134
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:46,012
ALL BEING RESOLVED?

135
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:48,348
>> I THINK ULTIMATELY THE

136
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:49,649
PRESIDENT MAY HAVE TO COME IN

137
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:49,949
HERE.

138
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:51,818
>> Martha: AND DO WHAT?

139
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:52,952
>> BASICALLY ORDER THEM.

140
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,654
HE DOES CONTROL THE JUSTICE

141
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:55,054
DEPARTMENT.

142
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:55,955
IT CAN GIVE THEM VERY LEGITIMATE

143
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:59,058
ORDERS, KAREN       TURN THIS OV

144
00:03:59,058 --> 00:03:59,092
ORDERS, KAREN       TURN THIS OR

145
00:03:59,092 --> 00:03:59,125
ORDERS, KAREN       TURN THIS OT

146
00:03:59,125 --> 00:03:59,425
ORDERS, KAREN       TURN THIS OO

147
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:00,426
CONGRESS, DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO

148
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:00,827
DO.

149
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:03,129
IF IT DOES HAVE TO GO TO THE

150
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,499
HOUSE, IF THERE IS A CENSURE

151
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:07,300
VOTE, WHICH I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE

152
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,169
TO DO, BUT IF WE HAVE TO DO IT,

153
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,037
WE WILL DO WHATEVER WE HAVE TO.

154
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:12,372
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW

155
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,440
WHAT WAS THE BASIS OF THIS

156
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,742
INVESTIGATION AGAINST THE

157
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:16,442
PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN, WHO WAS

158
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:19,279
INVOLVED IN IT, OR THEIR

159
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,647
INFORMANTS, HOW MANY, WHERE THEY

160
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:22,816
PAID, WHY DID THEY GET INVOLVED,

161
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:24,551
HOW IMPORTANT WAS THAT AT THE

162
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,552
START OF THIS INVESTIGATION, OR

163
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:26,419
DID IT COME AFTER THE

164
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,389
INVESTIGATION STARTED?

165
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:30,857
THESE SHOULD BE SIMPLE

166
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:31,624
QUESTIONS, SIMPLE ANSWERS AND WE

167
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:32,292
HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS FOR

168
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:35,628
MONTHS NOW.

169
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:37,630
>> Martha: BEFORE I LET YOU

170
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,364
GO, AS A NEW YORKER I WANT TO

171
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:40,533
ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE

172
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,101
COURT HERE IN NEW YORK AND

173
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,136
MICHAEL: , WHO USED TO BE AN

174
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:45,805
ATTORNEY FOR THE PRESIDENT.

175
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:52,045
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS HAD A

176
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,447
DIVIDE WITH HIS ATTORNEY AND

177
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:55,114
THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION

178
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:55,849
THAT HE MAY BE ABOUT TO FLIP ON

179
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:56,282
THE PRESIDENT.

180
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:56,950
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT?

181
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,252
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?

182
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:00,019
>> I WOULD SAY NO.

183
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,020
AS FAR AS FLIPPING, YOU HAVE TO

184
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,623
HAVE INFORMATION TO GIVE AND AS

185
00:05:03,623 --> 00:05:05,058
FAR AS I KNOW, FROM EVERYTHING

186
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:07,060
I'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE

187
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,061
INVESTIGATION THERE IS NOTHING

188
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:08,828
THAT MICHAEL COHEN WOULD HAVE ON

189
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:11,331
THE PRESIDENT AND ALSO I DON'T

190
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:12,565
THINK IS THE TYPE OF PERSON TO
