1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,091
>> PEOPLE ARE SITTING AND

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:06,692
SQUATTING ON THE FENCE.

3
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:07,593
OFFICIALS SAY SOME PEOPLE HAVE

4
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:09,862
GONE OVER AND HAVE BEEN

5
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:10,329
ARRESTED.

6
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:11,096
FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO TO

7
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:12,264
SOMEONE THAT HAS BEEN ON THE

8
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:12,831
FRONT LINES.

9
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:13,566
THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR

10
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:17,069
OF NEW MEXICO.

11
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:18,604
AND DEFORMING US AS AMBASSADOR

12
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:20,773
TO THE UNITED NATIONS.

13
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:21,473
GOVERNOR, AMBASSADOR WOELFEL.

14
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:26,612
>> THANK YOU, ERIC.

15
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:27,546
CLASSROOM TALKING ABOUT WILL

16
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:28,881
CREATE A MOMENT BUT FIRST YOUR

17
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:29,381
REACTION TO THIS

18
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:29,815
.

19
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:31,717
>> I THINK WE ARE A NATION OF

20
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:32,618
LAWS AND YOUR PREVIOUS GUESTS,

21
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:36,755
VERY SENSIBLY TALKED ABOUT WE

22
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:40,159
ARE SUBJECT TO AN INTERNATIONAL

23
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,260
COVENANT ON ASYLUM.

24
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,027
I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH

25
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:43,996
OF THESE CASES CASE BY CASE

26
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:47,900
WITHIN THE INDIVIDUALLY AND

27
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,635
THESE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING,

28
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,302
MAINLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

29
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:53,038
THERE ARE SOME ACTIVISTS FROM

30
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:53,806
POLITICAL TURMOIL AND EL

31
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:54,707
SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, NICARAGUA.

32
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:58,644
THEY ARE SAYING THAT MANY OF

33
00:00:58,644 --> 00:00:59,311
THEIR LIVES ARE IN DANGER.

34
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,212
I THINK THAT WE ARE A NATION OF

35
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:00,512
LAWS.

36
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:03,015
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS RESPECT

37
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:03,382
EACH CASE.

38
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:06,285
NOT OVERRUN JUST BECAUSE THERE

39
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:07,019
IS A CROWD.

40
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:07,753
I HAVE SOME SUPPORTIVE ENTRIES

41
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:11,724
IN NEW MEXICO.

42
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:13,559
I HAVE DEALT WITH THE ISSUES.

43
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,361
THINK OF TO DO WITH THEM WITHIN

44
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,063
THE LAW AND THAT IS WHAT I

45
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:18,764
SENSE THE HOMELAND SECURITY

46
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:19,265
PEOPLE ARE DOING.

47
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:22,301
BUT IF THERE IS A LEGITIMATE

48
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,135
CASE, SOMEONE FLEEING FOR

49
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,204
POLITICAL PERSECUTION OR THE

50
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:30,075
FACT THAT THEY MAY BE TARGETED

51
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:30,809
FOR MURDER, THEN I THINK THAT

52
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:33,379
IS A SENSIBLE CASE BUT THERE

53
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,747
ARE OTHERS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY

54
00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:35,948
AND IT IS A VERY NARROW

55
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:37,750
STANDARD AS YOUR PREVIOUS

56
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,217
GUESTS MENTION.

57
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:40,386
>> AND I HAVE BEEN DOWN TO SOME

58
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:44,323
AND PARKED THERE IN THE CORNER.

59
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,057
YOU CAN SEE IF YOU CANNOT STEP

60
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:45,758
OVER YOU SHOULD NOT, IT IS

61
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:46,091
ILLEGAL.

62
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:48,494
YOU ARE TOLD NOT TO PAY BUT

63
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:49,928
THEY SAY THAT IT IS A POLITICAL

64
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:51,163
STUNT.

65
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:56,168
BY ACTIVISTS MAYBE COACHING

66
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:56,735
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE.

67
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:57,403
SUPPORTERS SAY SCOTT IS AN

68
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,538
EXAMPLE THAT YOU JUST RAISED.

69
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:00,839
WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN ABOUT

70
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,607
THOSE CRITICS WHO THINK THIS

71
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,142
MAY BE TOO MUCH?

72
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:05,577
>> IT IS AN ANNUAL EVENT.

73
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:06,545
AND ON BOTH SIDES, THERE IS

74
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:07,546
ACTIVISTS.

75
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:12,851
THERE ACTIVISTS THAT SEE THIS

76
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:15,154
HAPPEN AND SOME MAY BE I GUESS

77
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:16,255
ATTORNEYS THAT WANT TO

78
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:16,789
SPOTLIGHT THE ISSUE.

79
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:18,991
THIS IS WHY I THINK THE LAW HAS

80
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:19,625
TO BE OBSERVED.

81
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:26,031
I THINK THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH

82
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:26,965
AGENTS AND TECHNOLOGY TO DEAL

83
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:28,067
WITH THIS.

84
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:28,934
THE REALITY, I CAN SAY THE

85
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:32,705
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HAS SLOWED

86
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:33,005
DOWN.

87
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,807
THIS CENTRAL AMERICA

88
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:37,576
IMMIGRATION IS THE ONE THAT IS

89
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:37,976
INCREASING.

90
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:38,811
I THINK IT IS BEING LOOKED AT

91
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:41,880
AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL.

92
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,048
THE PRESIDENT, EVERY TIME HE

93
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:44,350
GETS A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THE

94
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,684
WALL OR THIS, IT JUST INFLAMES

95
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:46,085
THINGS.

96
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,052
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR

97
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:51,724
THAT BUT THAT IS MY CONCERN.

98
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:52,558
>> NOW GO TO ANOTHER BOARD?

99
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:53,992
WELL THIS IS GOING A

100
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:54,827
PRODIGIOUSLY VIDEO TAPED YOU

101
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,529
HAD BEEN NORTH KOREA AND

102
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:58,197
NEGOTIATED WITH THEM

103
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:58,597
PERSONALLY?

104
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,599
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF KIM

105
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,101
JONG-UN AND THE PRESIDENT MOON

106
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:02,534
HOLDING HANDS?

107
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:03,702
WALKING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN

108
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:04,103
THE BORDERS.

109
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:11,510
YOU THINK THIS IS GENUINE?

110
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,244
YOU THINK YOU WANT TO

111
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:13,112
POTENTIALLY SURRENDER THE

112
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:14,847
NUCLEAR PROGRAM?

113
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:19,752
>> WELL, I WAS VERY OVERWHELMS

114
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:20,519
AND PLEASED AND IMPRESSED.

115
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,453
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT THEY BOTH

116
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:24,456
STEPPING INTO EACH OTHER'S

117
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,425
TERRITORY, LESSENING TENSIONS.

118
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:27,259
BOTH COUNTRIES WATCHING THE

119
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,160
EVENTS SO CLOSELY.

120
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,029
THAT IS VERY GOOD.

121
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:31,864
I'VE DEALT WITH THE NORTH

122
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:33,332
KOREANS.

123
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,166
THEY HAVE SOMETHING UP THEIR

124
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,602
SLEEVE BUT SO FAR, YOU HAVE TO

125
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:39,772
HAND IT TO KIM JONG-UN ALONE

126
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:40,706
AND THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT.

127
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:41,907
THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE

128
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:44,243
SOME GOOD MOVES ALSO.

129
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:45,010
BASICALLY SAYING THERE WAS SHUT

130
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,378
DOWN NUCLEAR REACTOR, THEY ARE

131
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:51,250
READY TO DENUCLEARIZE.

132
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,484
THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS.

133
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:53,419
THERE IS NO TIMELINE FROM THE

134
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:53,752
SUMMIT.

135
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:54,553
THERE IS NO SPECIFICITY.

136
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:56,021
I'M JUST WORRIED THAT KIM

137
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,656
JONG-UN ALONE RIGHT NOW IS

138
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:58,357
WINNING THE PR BATTLE BUT WE

139
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:00,192
HAVE GOT TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS

140
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:04,563
THAT DENUCLEARIZATION FOR US

141
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:05,464
MEANS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE MEANS

142
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:06,698
PAPER AS IT MEANS DISMANTLING

143
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:10,068
OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THEN

144
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:10,669
THEY GET SOME BENEFITS.

145
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:14,573
FOR THE NORTH KOREANS BASICALLY

146
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,307
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS A

147
00:04:15,307 --> 00:04:15,641
PHRASE.

148
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:16,375
THEY WILL CARR THEIR EXISTING

149
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:16,809
USE.

150
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:19,178
AS A LOT OF ISSUES TO NEGOTIATE

151
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:21,647
ON THE TABLE THAT ARE GOING TO

152
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:24,917
BE VERY DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE.

153
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,185
I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO

154
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:27,119
DO, THE SUMMIT IS GOOD LIVING

155
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,087
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

156
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:34,092
>> WHAT SHOULD THE PRESIDENT

157
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:34,359
DO?

158
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,427
JOHN BOLTON SAID BASICALLY IF

159
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:36,195
HE DOESN'T AGREE TO

160
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:37,095
DENUCLEARIZE THEY POSSIBLY WILL

161
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:38,697
NOT BE A MEETING.

162
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:40,432
TO THE PRESIDENT SAY WE HAVE TO

163
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:43,035
GIVE THE SUPPORT OF THE

164
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:44,236
PRESIDENT MEET HIM AND THEN SAY

165
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:44,870
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM UP?

166
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,607
>> YOU KNOW, HE IS NOT GOING TO

167
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,042
CHANGE HIS NEGOTIATING STYLE.

168
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:51,777
I HAD HOPED THAT HE JUST

169
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:54,780
LISTENED TO HIS SECRETARY OF

170
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,647
STATE AND LET HIM HANDLE THIS.

171
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:57,149
BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO

172
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,484
HAPPEN.

173
00:04:58,484 --> 00:04:59,017
THIS SUMMIT IS GOOD.

174
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:01,019
IT SHOULD HAPPEN REGARDLESS.

175
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,055
I THINK KIM JONG-UN HAS MADE

176
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:03,989
ENOUGH POSITIVE STATEMENTS THAT

177
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:07,459
IT IS WORTH TAKING A CHANCE.

178
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,094
ON SAYING IS THAT THE PRESIDENT

179
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:12,731
AND HIS TEAM NEED TO BE

180
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:13,098
PREPARED.

181
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:14,166
THEY NEED TO GET THE THREE

182
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:14,600
AMERICANS OUT.

183
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,235
WE NEED TO GET THE REMAINS OF

184
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:16,969
OUR SOLDIERS OUT.

185
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:18,770
WE NEED ALSO TO FOCUS ON

186
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,877
EXACTLY WHAT DENUCLEARIZATION

187
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:25,310
MEANS.

188
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,144
STOP SOME OF THE MISSILE TESTS

189
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:30,349
THE CURRENT UNITED STATES.

190
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:31,083
THAT THE CHEMICALS THAT COME TO

191
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,753
SYRIA, MISSILE AND OTHER

192
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:35,521
EXPORTS, NUCLEAR EXPERTS.

193
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:36,889
I THINK IN SOUTH KOREA, THEY'VE

194
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:37,856
DONE A GOOD JOB IN PAVING THE

195
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:38,123
WAY.

196
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:41,660
THE OTHER ONES ON THE FRONT

197
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:41,960
LINES.

198
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,965
25 MILLION SOUTH KOREANS FACING

199
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:48,300
A COMMERCIAL TECH TO THE FACT

200
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,501
THAT THE SUMMIT TOOK PLACE, I

201
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:50,736
KNOW PEOPLE ARE CRITICS, IS IT

202
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:52,938
GOING TO WORK?

203
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:55,140
AS FOR THE TIME BEING TENSION

204
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,144
IS USED, THESE TWO CANS, AND

205
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:02,314
HER NOSE WHAT KIM JONG-UN IS UP

206
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:02,581
TO.

207
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:03,916
THERE HAS TO BE REALLY

208
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:04,716
VERIFICATION, REAL IN ANY

209
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:05,450
AGREEMENT, REAL OVERSIGHT, WE

210
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,021
HAVE TO INSPECT ALL OF THEIR

211
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:09,521
SITES AND WEAPONS.

212
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:10,622
SOME ARE HIDDEN.

213
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:13,725
ACTUALLY MOST ARE HIDDEN.

214
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:16,461
SO IT IS GOING TO BE VERY

215
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,362
INTERESTING BUT HAVE TO SAY, IT

216
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:18,597
HAS NEVER BEEN AS GOOD AS IT

217
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:18,864
HAS.

218
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,799
AT LEAST HOPEFULNESS.

219
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,801
AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

220
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:23,402
THIS ISSUE A LONG TIME.

221
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:27,039
IT IS CERTAINLY ENCOURAGING.

222
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,675
FINALLY, AUTO ONE BEER.

223
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:30,609
THE STUDENT WAS BASICALLY

224
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:34,613
TORTURED AND MURDERED.

225
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:35,247
CAME BACK BRANDON.

226
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:39,918
HERE COMES ALONE CHANGES,

227
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:40,886
MATCHES THE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS

228
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:41,753
TIME BASICALLY TO SOUTH KOREA.

229
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:43,355
THE PRESIDENT BRING THE CASE TO

230
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:45,991
KIM JONG-UN TO PROSECUTE THE

231
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:48,060
KILLERS IN NORTH KOREA?

232
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,928
>> WELL, YEAH.

233
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:52,030
MY FOUNDATION TRIED TO GET HIM

234
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,033
OUT AND OFFERED ALL KINDS OF

235
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:55,367
THINGS.

236
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:58,704
NOT AS EFFICIENT NEGOTIATIONS.

237
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:03,141
THEY OWE INTONATION.

238
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:06,545
WHAT HAPPENED TO OTTO WARMBIER?

239
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:08,647
WHY DID HE COME BACK AND NOT

240
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:09,381
GET PROPER TREATMENT?

241
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:12,784
I THINK THERE HAS BEEN

242
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:13,418
ACCOUNTABILITY.

243
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:15,621
VERY GOOD PEOPLE TO FAMILY,

244
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:16,722
THEY FILED A LAWSUIT.

245
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:17,456
I THINK IT HAS TO GO THROUGH

246
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,992
STUDENT PROCESS AND BUT, I

247
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:22,294
THINK AT THE VERY LEAST, THE

248
00:07:22,294 --> 00:07:25,430
NORTH KOREANS SHOULD MAKE A

249
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,333
VERY CONCRETE DECISION NEVER TO

250
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:32,771
APPREHEND ANOTHER AMERICAN.

251
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:33,905
AND THERE ARE THREE AMERICANS

252
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:34,640
THAT ARE THERE RIGHT NOW

253
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,141
APPREHENDED THAT SHOULD BE

254
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:36,608
RELEASED.

255
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,576
>> WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OTTO

256
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:38,310
WARMBIER AND THE THREE

257
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,177
AMERICANS THERE AS WELL AS

258
00:07:39,177 --> 00:00:00,000
TALKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL
