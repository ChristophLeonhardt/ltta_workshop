Kavanaugh at Sarajevo in 1914 and of course we are now calling for a full CIA investigation for this very credible evidence that Brett Kavanaugh may have started World War one and in one final

the it's such hacker e it's such an abuse of the public trust it's such an abuse of an important institution or in the in the midst of all of that storm cloud there is a silver lining which is that apparently Brett Kavanaugh has cured Alzheimer's disease and that's a wonderful thing that's a march forward for science a great move for our government because of memories that had been repressed not for just a couple weeks or a few months or years decades many decades in some cases they are being dredged up now all of a sudden by that little smile on Brett Kavanaugh is faced by the thought that we're going to have a Supreme Court justice who reads the Constitution and interprets it to mean what it actually means you've probably read about the allegations they are insane I might look a little tired today because they broke last night and I was up until 2:00 2:30 in the morning reading through this insanity so let's begin with the least insane allegations which also are totally baseless Ronan Farrow dredged up this woman from Yale Deborah Ramirez by the way I log in to Twitter last night and I see Yale as trending and I've known since 2015 when that shrieking girl humiliated that entire University and whenever I see Yale trending it's not a good thing it's not I opened it up as oh here we go the allegation is that Brett Kavanaugh was at a party in Lawrence Hall on Yale's old campus when he was a freshman and everybody was drinking and the allegation it's not even really quite being made because even the woman who's accusing Rhett Cavanaugh says she's not sure if it happened but the allegation is that he unzipped his pants whipped out the you know Brett junior and they all laughed about it but they don't really no one really remembers because everyone was drunk including the woman who's accusing him and I tell you I've been to a lot of parties in Lawrence Hall and old campus and I wish 'men year end even later and of all the parties that I was ever at on yells old campus never once did a federal judge expose himself to me so that's evidence on the other side of that it's evidence at least as weighty as the as the Deborah Ramirez almost allegations so there by the way the reason I'm using language carefully here is she doesn't know what happened she says she does I don't really know I don't really know what happened so then the New Yorker could not find one eyewitness to corroborate this story there was a woman that Ramirez says was at the party who then they reach doubt and the woman said no there's no I wasn't at that party have no memory of that Ramirez even today even after she's made this allegation has said she's not sure if it's him her Ramirez his best friend freshman year and throughout her time at Yale has said she never heard anything about it Ramirez is a registered Democrat she's a left-wing activist doesn't prove anything per se but it does add a lot of context also Ramirez admits that she was totally hammered at this party and by the way is someone who has been to a lot of Yale parties I'll say people do drink a ton there it is free flowing all over campus but she says she doesn't really remember what happened and her other friend says she never mentioned it once until now as for the allegation itself again a lot of people are saying this never happened there's no way this ever happened I will say Yale does have a lot of nudity going on they do there's streaking there naked parties there there it there is a lot of nudity here but you've got to remember no one brought up any allegation like this until five minutes ago until until five minutes ago it's not like Brett Kavanaugh with some unknown entity he he became a Farris somewhat public figure during the Ken Starr investigation he was working under Ken Starr to investigate Bill Clinton he then was working in the Bush administration and a pretty front-facing role he then became a federal judge in 2006 he's then he's been up on Supreme Court lists for a while and none of this came out anywhere until not only the 11th hour of the confirmation hearing this time but until after the Christine Ford allegations started to fizzle this came out of notice it's just really hard to believe now that the story comes from Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer who wrote this piece in The New Yorker here it look Ronan Farrow has done good work before but this one is really sad this is really tarnishing his credibility and here's Jane Mayer describing all her great evidence that she's got on CBS Jane the corroborating witness which you says has all the details including Cavanaugh's name where did that win has come from and where did that witness get the information about this from if she if that person doesn't know Ramirez he remembers it from from he was in the same dorm same same little building on Yale's old campus and he remembers it clearly I asked him you know be very careful no I said he heard it from someone who was there and as I've said we interviewed him and I said to him are you sure that it was Brett Kavanaugh he said I am a hundred percent sure but he admit he was not at the party Jay was he there well no he wasn't there I told you wasn't there but he like lived nearby or something Wow okay did he know and actually Jane Meyers defense here for her corroborate she called him a corroborating witness Oh was he a witness though no he wasn't a witness okay so any isn't corroborating anything yeah well okay he didn't see it and he can't attest to it but he heard about it like from some guy who knew the guy or this or that but I'll but let me tell you I'm such a good journalist I asked him I said are you sure are you and he said he's sure so look don't don't knock me I'm a journalist I asked him I asked him were you sure he said he sure that's journalist that's journalism today in the me tube movement really sad because Ronan Farrow has done great work before but this is so pathetic this is so pathetic that other news outlets turned it down the New York Times turn this story down NBC turned this story down even the Washington Post which has zero standards left even they turned it down why because this isn't a news story this is not responsible journalism this is reckless this is a smear you could do this about anybody you could say this about anybody but so that's just the first allegation that's just the first one how do we know that this one is not credible because of everything about it if the New York Times is going to turn it down for the Washington Post is going to turn down an opportunity to attack president Trump's nominee and President Trump it ain't worth it but then enters Michael conadi the creepy porn lawyer to borrow Tucker Carlson's phrase he's that guy he's that blowhard who goes on television and uses he uses the hashtag word basta basta which is an Italian word that means enough and I'm taking bets on whether Michael avenatti speaks more than one word of Italian I suspect does not but he's this big or bump up and he so michael avenatti is now alleging not that Brett Kavanaugh whipped it out freshman year at a drunk party he's not doing he's he's accusing Brett Kavanaugh of running a gang rape circle in DC in the 80s or something he's alleging that Brett Kavanaugh is this like secret Don pimp gangster who was running apparently a brothel for men to go in and abuse women that is not an exaggeration he is he sent emails he's making this allegation publicly so how do we know that that story is false well because Michael avenatti is saying that if if Michael avenatti told me that two plus two equals four I would deny mathematical reality because that guy has zero honesty is zero credibility and zero integrity how else do it well how do we know that the gang rape thing is not true it's because it's facially absurd it's absurd on its face but the other the other reason that we know that all of these are not credible allegations is the timing so if the Democrats had the kristine forward allegation as early as late July and now they've had this allegation for five minutes and which and it only came out after the Christine Ford thing fizzled but even the Christine Ford allegation why are we only getting that now why didn't we get that in July because in July the Democrats when they're trying to target Cavanaugh they came out and said that he bought baseball tickets for his friends on his credit card and then he paid his credit card bills off overtime those were the big scandals that they were gonna get Brett Cavanaugh on he has friends and likes America's pastime and pays his bills he even bought some apple pies on that credit card and then paid it off on time so that was their first attack if they really took this seriously right now trending on Twitter is the fribble Eve survivors believe women and will and by the way we'll get to in a little bit why due process is a much more important hashtag than than believe survivors but we'll get to that later on in the show after we talked to Anne Coulter who has a typically colorful take on all of this but but you know if they really believed this if they really thought Christine Ford was a serious credible witness they really believed that Brett Kavanaugh whipped it out at a party freshman year in Laurens Hall on old campus if they really believed that he were running some kind of criminal gang rape brothel Enterprise as Michael avenatti the least serious person in America is now alleging if they really believed that they would have brought it up at the time but they didn't they thought they could take him down on baseball tickets and credit cards and then they thought this and then this it's just a methodical hack attack before we explained why it is so important to defend Brett Kavanaugh why this is a truly world historical moment a turning-point moment at least for the Republican Party let's bring on Ian Coulter to get her perspective she brought up a great article the other day you know I read her column every week and she she said that Haven Monahan was going to testify at the Cavanaugh hearings and for those who don't remember Haven Monahan was the figure in the gang rape case allegedly at UVA that Rolling Stone reported on and the only trouble is Haven Monahan was a totally fictitious character invented by the accuser who made up the whole story so that was that was her take there I spoke to an a couple days ago let's let's turn to that and see what you had to say and thank you for being here good to be here Michael so Ann you've got a lot of explaining to do because you were early on a supporter of Brett Kavanaugh I always take your advice I always follow your lead and now we have found out the president yeah I try to follow his lead too but we'll get to that in a second but now we found out Ann that Brett Kavanaugh is actually secretly a super-duper convicted rapist how do you answer for yourself no I totally love this the only even I mean obviously he didn't do it she's a deranged lunatic but even what she is alleging what she's actually alleging is some guy let's say drunkenly groped her in high school everything else is as usual with feminists a product of her imagination I thought he might inadvertently kill me I thought it was going to be an attempted rape well okay you could think he was going to turn into Bigfoot but that's in your head that is quite a leap actually it's quite a leap from the groping to the attempted manslaughter that was I don't know where that that's right yes and I suspect being most charitable to her I mean I've noticed this a lot public figures people's memories are not as good as they as they imagined them to be and the more they think they have a great memory the the worse it is I I apparently dated every boy on North Campus at Cornell you can't believe how many people it has come back to me that I dated not me and I keep you know I keep telling people that you and I dated but nobody believes me and III don't think they're there they're like bragging I think their memories get confused because I've had at least in one case a guy say this directly to me on the street and I never dated him Michael well and other stories come back to me an argument I allegedly had that was and I was being portrayed perfectly favorably uh but so funny she got in an argument with Yale Camus or at Yale Law School I never took a class with Yale canvas or I'm glad you have that fond memory of me being so clever and witty but it wasn't me so this happens a lot were P something they super people I think in people's memories they superimposed some public figure whom they knew at an earlier time on some other memory so when Cavanaugh came back emphatically saying I was not at that party this did not happen that's kind of a ballsy thing to do instead of saying the way you and I began this conversation Oh give me a break seventeen-year-old gets drunk and gropes a girl first time ever unprecedented please PLEASE present another girl who isn't an hysterical feminist who who is what whom a that hasn't happened to and be actually cares or even remember that but he didn't say that he didn't say I was 17 I'm a different man and in general when you're accused of something I think it's much better to say yes I did it but it was consensual and not I was never in Cleveland but anybody saw you in Cleveland you're screwed he came back and fatica Lee saying I was never in Cleveland I think that pushed her back on her heels much like the boy who came up to me on the street and claimed he dated me and I said no you didn't I think it sort of shocked them when you're emphatic that way and they think to themselves oh my gosh did I get this wrong was this somebody else that's what happened but her handlers and her lawyers so she is saying I got it wrong I can't testify they're saying shut up we'll handle this that's right why we keep getting these endless BS offers about you know that the the terms under which she will test that's Monday or it's Thursday and the FBI and the CIA is going to be there how is this going to end or because I think some Republicans some squishy people are saying oh well we can move on we can get another nominee if we have to he's we can't do it I mean it it is this or nothing yes yes no that would be very bad I mean that means that I do not think the founding fathers when they wrote the Constitution were just in so much of a rush they forgot to include the part in the advice and consent Clause where random psychology professors at Palo Alto get a veto no if they if they if they get this guy if they say that okay because of a 36 year old alligator what are we going to get what judge could we ever get through what a studious unimpeachable white guy will ever be able to hold office again no it will be fair game on white men in in any walk of life don't worry no allegations necessary or rather no evidence no corroboration no even really believability to the story I mean she doesn't remember what year it happened she doesn't remember where it happened I do yes but she wants an investigation what on earth would an investigation look like here I'll just go around to every house in Montgomery County were you ever at something resembling a party yeah did you have a party in this house did you did you ever see a sort of preppy looking white boy teenager running around the greater DC area did you now I want to move on because I know we've only got a little bit of time because I read your column religiously I and you have been reminding oh yeah you've been reminding all of us that we don't have a wall yet where is this wall yes where's my way back you see this is why this is part of the reason I wrote resistance is futile I'm trying to direct the left to a much better attack on the president but can I you know every third day I want to fly to Washington track down the President and hold his head underwater until the bubbles stop then the resistance brings me back they they want some utterly unprovoked unfair attack they run off on their demented international Russian conspiracy theory yes this this bumbling buffoon staged the most massive international conspiracy boris and Natasha he's boris and Natasha all rolled up into one yeah that's right yes yes exactly and so does the Cavanaugh stop they drove me back into his arms when I'm really kind of mad at him and I I mean there are many there are many weird aspects to the resistance a military term that if companies had he lost the Hillary oh my gosh it would have been a dog whistle for the KKK right no with Harry charmese activating the militias and in fact we could Trump voters and supporters have been subjected to massive physical violence by aunty Fah and and I mean we are witnessing a fascist uprising man if the shoe were on the other foot I think we might notice that um but if the resistance one of it one of the unfortunate things I think we're seeing it with Cavanaugh um with the resistance is I mean they've given up all kinds of principles that they've held for decades and decades and decades like you know the Russians love their children too when during Stalinist show trials now they're just an ordinarily corrupt government that's right when they were going to blow off the world that was a different matter yeah exactly exactly but one of them is I mean it used to be not just it wasn't just just me talking about illegal immigrants driving down the working-classes wage screwing over America I mean it used to be Jesse Jackson standing at the border demanding demanding an end to illegal immigration um it used to be Harry Reid on the Senate floor saying the concept of anchor babies is insane it used to be Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer amazingly enough defending the border patrol for whacking illegals running across the border so I mean it it may have happened in the Democratic Party anyway they were kind of going in the direction of not caring about the working class or or you know flyover people in just a screw we've we've got the actresses we've got Wall Street we've got the identity politics type I'm and the immigrants but it would be really helpful if both parties could get together and care about the people who already live here and if the resistance would read my boat they would see the way to go after Trump is to attack them for not fulfilling his promises to say look we actually do care about the working class but no we can't do that because if Trump is for it they're against it that's right and and their philosophy your books it's amazing that your opponents don't read your books because the books they always have colorful titles and they include incredible insight you know resistance is futile obviously adios America has so much on immigration he pluribus awesome and Trump we trust gave a great argument that Trump was elected because of policy the left thinks he was elected because he's a mean guy and he tweets things on on that point you know do you see going into the midterms looking at 2020 how is it looking how is it looking for the left are they gonna understand this lesson or are they gonna change their ways are they gonna make it the American people or are we still safe because of the policy preferences of the American people I think Trampas is it's weird I think he tends to be safe for re-election I'm not sure about the midterms the the history suggest there will be a blue way Trump hasn't built the wall and I may be the only one getting snippy with him on Twitter but I was at a fair conference in Washington and ran into a lot of sheriffs and a lot of Angel moms and they were thanking me for my snippy tweets I mean a lot of anything really is the morale I thank you too and thank you they want no I mean specifically on the wall they want the wall that was the champ so when your own base is demoralized I promise you their base isn't demoralized oh they hate this guy with the hot hot hate of a thousand suns I admit I'm worried about the midterms and weirdly enough what may save Trump is how insane the left is ie the resistance that they were smart they read my book and they stop being insane well that's the book everyone else you go read it to resistance is futile and I've taken up too much of your time already so I'll let you go that is resistance is futile by my ex-girlfriend Ann Coulter she doesn't remember but I'm sure I could jog her memory and thank you so much for being here love her love her so and she's so so right about this and we need to defend Cavanaugh we have to defend Cavanaugh I hope that Republicans are engaged squishy on this I hope they're not thinking oh he's compromised oh he it's hard and he's dance that now it's just a new one let's do it they're gonna say that Amy Coneybear it exposed herself to some girl at Yale in 1982 they'll do it to anybody they'll do it to anybody and I read this piece today in The Daily Beast I you know I wake up every morning and the way that I roused myself had a bed as I read some stupid left-wing piece and so this one I read it is I'm a Republican but Cavanaugh must withdraw his nomination it's in The Daily Beast it's by a woman named Sophia Nelson I don't know if she's really a Republican there are some people who say that there Republicans but they never vote Republican and they hate conservative ideas like Jennifer Rubin and now at this point David Frum we'll get to him later and Anna Navarro same thing so I don't know Sophia Nelson might be one of those she said what this is a new day but the party's leaders seems stuck in a past century and her entire thesis is that yeah sure maybe it he didn't do any of this and yeah but but you know they've already smeared him so let's just move on because you know some women have been sexually harassed by some people at some point somewhere someplace so we can't have captain that's what that's her actual thesis you know it's the Democrats smear these guys but he's because he got smeared let's not let's do someone else it's a horrific argument it's so so wrong before I rouse you into your strong necessary support for break a baton I've got to say goodbye to Facebook in YouTube I'm sorry we're gonna analyze some fake hoaxes rape stories that have been going on as the hashtag believe all survivors it goes around the country and but before we do that go to daily wire comm if you're ready there thank you very much you keep the lights on you keep going mic up if you're on Facebook and YouTube you probably won't be there long so go to daily wire it's ten bucks a month 100 dollars for an annual membership you get me you get the Andrew Clavin show you usually get the Ben Shapiro show that you don't get it today because of the Jewish holidays I was thinking man of men must be thinking right now of all the days to be Jewish this news cycle was the roughest what was I thinking you know because there's a lot that we're gonna have to cover but usually you get been you get to ask questions in the mailbag that's coming up on Thursday so get your mailbag questions in you have to ask questions in the conversation I believe the Lord of the multiverse Andrew Klavan is up next but none of that matters because you get this sweet sweet vintage the mmm that you know that's an older vintage I mean that is an old vintage vintage has been around for a long time that is the Diane Feinstein blend that varietal of leftist years and that's gonna be even sweeter it's already sweet it's gonna be even sweeter when we push this guy through nan & n and you can't stop us it is gonna taste it already taste good but it's gonna taste even better than so make sure you get your left is tears by the time we do that go to daily wire calm we'll be right back hashtag believes survivors is trending was the top trend on Twitter just an hour ago hashtag due process has not been trending at all but that's a very scary thing because if we just believe all accusations regardless of evidence regardless of time frames people's rights are going to be trampled people's lives are gonna be ruined people are going to be smeared and mere anarchy will be loosed upon the world Oh a lot of people ask they say why would a woman make a false accusation of sexual harassment like Anita Hill did to Clarence Thomas at the 1991 confirmation hearings of exposure or sexual assault or whatever like we're getting now why would a woman make a false accusation the short answer is I don't know but they do and the longer answer is there are a couple reasons which we've seen in recent years in 2014 the UVA rape case the gang rape case covered in Rolling Stone wall-to-wall coverage this girl said she was raped at a fraternity at UVA turned out it was totally bogus it was totally bogus she we found out later she completely made it up and she actually made up some of the people in it she made up the guy Haven Monahan who was one of the one of the perpetrators there 2014 why did she do it I don't know couldn't tell you Morgan triplet in 2013 she reported that she had been raped and people took it serious that major investigation turned out she had posted an ad on Craigslist begging first she begged a guy to shoot her in the shoulder nobody took now apparently no one wanted to do that that wasn't appealing then she posted an advertisement asking a guy to beat her up and have sex with her and apparently a couple guys jumped on that one so they met up with her beat her up did whatever they did and then she looked and her cell phone screen said I'm not beating up enough punch me more and then she reported that she had been raped why did she do that because she was a Looney tune a complete wackadoodle I can't explain that I can't give you a rational explanation for that but she was a nut a dezirian all who was the president of her local chapter of the National Organization for Women at Rollins College same thing happened a few years ago you reported a rape and it was a hoax 2013 meg lank or Simon's at the University of Wyoming total hoax 2009 Dan mel 'no danyay of Hofstra University accused men of gang raping her in a bathroom stole it later came out they found out that it was totally consensual and she accused them of gang rape in that case because she didn't want her boyfriend to find out that she had voluntary sex with other men she her boyfriend accused her said you look like you've just had sex with a bunch of people she said oh do I I was you know and she made this false accusation of course Duke Lacrosse who can forget the Duke Lacrosse case ruined those boys lives overzealous prosecutor and it turned out that it was totally fabricated in 2013 Tanya barrace at the University of Florida she said that she was raped there was an investigation it was a total hoax why does she do it she said quote she wanted to teach a lesson to women in the area than an attack could happen to them so in that case the hoax was prompted by feminism or by a fear for a narrative that didn't really exist but she wanted to prove existed and this you hear this all the time with the left when you disprove one of their hoaxes they say yes that was false but it proves a larger truth there is a larger truth you say no there's not a larger than what larger than Balai you told yeah anything's larger a larger truth and the lie that you just told they always say never mind the particular it's the narrative it's the abstract narrative has to be true and and of course of course Duke Lacrosse so why would a woman make something up I don't know to advance a narrative because of her feminist ideals because of boyfriend caught her I don't know those are just those are particularly that I can point to in very recent history now does this mean that women are always making up allegations or that they're frequently making up allegations no and it's awful and it's a hard crime to prove so you should take women very very seriously when they make this this is part of the reason why these allegations should not be investigated by campus tribunals of boards of professors or by hack senators who are trying to torpedo an unimpeachable Court nominee they should be investigated at the time that they occur by law enforcement and the perpetrators if they're found to be perpetrators should be hung up by their neck they should they should be have the book thrown at them and probably be executed but you can't execute people either if they're live actually execute them or kill their reputations based on baseless allegations 36 years later you cannot do that Brett Kavanaugh must go through let me say it again in case you didn't hear in case you were a little squishy Brett Kavanaugh must be seated on the Supreme Court if they fail to confirm Brett Kavanaugh there there is no argument for electing Republicans because they won't stand up to even the flimsiest attacks it means they can't do nothing even when they got the house even when they got the Senate even when they've got the White House even when they've got textualist on the Supreme Court they can't do nothing so why would you ever vote for them this is so important I think you know some people are trying to make the case oh it doesn't look well we still have the Senate let's just put someone else through let's just do it doesn't really matter Cavanaugh it's too bad what happened to him but it's like okay whatever no if it didn't matter they wouldn't be pushing this hard if it didn't matter the Democrats wouldn't be pulling out every flimsy filthy lie that they've got every smear that they've been working on since 1987 when they first did this to Bork they Ted Kennedy that degenerate smeared him smeared a good man and a great jurist on the man who should have been on the court they did it again to Clarence Thomas in 91 four years later because they didn't have their fill they do it every single chance that they can get we cannot let this happen it people talk about a blue wave yeah I don't think you're gonna get a blue wave right now if you don't let this guy through you are gonna get a blue tsunami you're gonna get a blue tidal wave because there will be no reason to elect Republicans not a single one this is a blood sport it's been going on for decades old allegations we saw the decades-old crime in 1987 when they torpedoed judge Bork and this this has been building for a very very long time it's an all a brutal knuckle fight we should pummel them over the rhetorical head that vote should have happened a week ago or two weeks ago no hearings no investigations nothing you you are not entitled to that 36 years later with flimsy nothing no witness we know actually in the Ronan Farrow piece Democrats came hunting for them came hunting to try to dig up anything the woman in the Ronan Farrow piece Ramirez said I don't remember I don't remember if it was Cavanaugh I don't really remember any details and six days later she said okay I remember now yeah I was him as six days after Democrat vultures were picking at her corpse at dis its disgusting there should be nobody should give this any quarter in Cavanaugh thank goodness we have Kavanagh because Cavanaugh is like really really Manning up here he said he sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee he said he will not be intimidated into withdrawing if ain't gonna happen he's going to defend his good name and the good reputation that he has built up for a long time this is making me feel hopeful and I hope that Republicans circle the troops around and stand firm on this for reaction we turn to King Henry the fifth of England we view we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition I'm gentlemen in England now Abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us huzzah yes gentlemen of America Nellis sleep now I bed absolutely right well said King Henry also now coming out Brian carome of CNN Sentinel newspapers he's saying that investigators this was a major report got a zillion retweets said investigators now in Maryland are looking into another Cavanaugh allegation investigators in Maryland in this county okay so then other newspapers called up the Chief of Police and said is that true or investigators looking into this chief - chief police said nope no they're not so then Brian carome says oh well I hope you don't think I meant the cops oh no I'm not talking about oh you thought just because I said investigators you thought I was talking about investigators no yeah I see how you can make that mistake I was talking about some random guys somewhere not invest a ice you heard investigators and you thought that meant investigators but that's not true it's an out-and-out lie it's an out-and-out lie by a guy who runs a bunch of newspapers and goes on CNN and it's an out-and-out lie you don't care that it's a lie who cares if someone is making an allegation out of revenge if they're making an allegation to get a little bit of attention if they're making an allegation because they genuinely think something's true and but maybe you're mistaken about it if they're making it who knows why someone makes an allegation 36 years later what the effect of it is is to torpedo a good man's career torpedo a guy who should be in the Supreme Court don't give it any quarter don't Brian carome he responded to me when I pointed out that he's a liar on Twitter and he said I didn't lie I stay oh this is just investigators you know it's done it soaked up but now he's a lot of people are defending him and saying that was just wordplay he said an investigator could mean anything and I don't know it's looking into okay what no it's a lie it's a lie I get that it's wordplay too but it's a lie I can say I heard Brian Karam is a rapist and that statement is true the statement I heard Brian Karam is a rapist is a true statement because I just said it and I heard him I said it I can hear my own voice consequently I heard that that is true so I could say that now if I reported that that I would be a dirty rotten liar because the clear implication of what I've said is egregiously misleading and baseless this so I would be a liar but oh but it's wordplay it's to it no it's not it's a lie it's a dirty lying we should call it out for what it is these sorts of lies speaking of bad reporting by the way I know we've got to go and we didn't get to any stories today but too bad we had a lot to talk about but speaking of unclear reporting it broke news this morning that rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General was out at the FBI or at the I'm sorry at the Department of Justice that he was being fired or he had resigned or his being called in to Kelly and that he's at and so then in that case the Solicitor General of the United States is going to come into his his place and oversee the Muller investigation a Dutra dude to do so then he goes and meets with general Kelly at the White House and now it seems that he's not fired it seems that he's still on the job why was he possibly gonna be fired because it came out that he had talked in a room with Lisa Paige I believe was there Andy McCabe had said that he was that he would wear a wire and thought that the 25th amendment should be invoked to kick Donald Trump out of office now another source in this room in that room said that he was just joking you don't get to make those jokes at this time you don't get to make those jokes when you're a senior official who's overseeing a highly politicized investigation that has employed people who have said that they're going to subvert the election of the American people's election of Donald Trump and try to kick him out of office and prevent him from being president you don't get to see that when there were attacks calls for impeachment you don't get to joke about those things if that's the case so anyway he was brought in and now and he's apparently still on the job he was at a meeting later and in his official capacity and but by the time that it was reported that maybe he was gonna get fired David Frum former conservative David Frum who's now purl clutching at the Atlantic he wrote a piece and published it titled Rosen Stein's departure is a national emergency and said quote Special Counsel Robert Mulder's investigation is now in mortal payroll and therefore you know this is a national emergency for the United States so first of all this is kind of awkward for him he pulled the trigger a little fast here because it seems that Rosenstein is not fired at least as of yet but also it's not a national emergency it's fine it's fine I think what you meant to say is that it's fine it's it we have this means look if he gets fired then the Solicitor General comes up he oversees the Moller investigation who cares who cares by the way the Moller investigation into collusion between Trump and interference and the Russia they've found no evidence that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to borrow a mostly empty phrase they've got nothing they've gonna I should write another book called the findings of the Moller investigation that'll be my second bestseller I'll sell as many copies as the first but also I do want to point out this obsession with the executive agencies the Department of Justice the FBI the sanctity of these organizations is totally bizarre the idea that the FBI is the greatest most pristine institution in the history of the country is absurd for decades you had a cross-dressing bully J Edgar Hoover spying on Americans at blackmailing them using the dirty dug up to keep himself entrenched in power having power even over presidents that isn't it that isn't a totally clean organization and now we know that they officials there acted inappropriately politicized the organization used it to attack why who is now a duly elected president of the United States why the pearl clutching there we were supposed to be on guard against these agencies all of them look there's good work that they do but we have to be on guard against all of them their executive agencies can be encroachments of power that should be reserved to the people to the to the legislature so alright we'll get to Michael Moore tomorrow cuz it's kind of funny his movie flopped spoiler alert is movie flopped but because all nature is put are dime known to thee I will point out that on this day in history in 1789 the Supreme Court was established it actually was founded today by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and were in the midst of this disgusting despicable fight that Democrats started they started at decades ago but they doing it is 100% their fault that this happens that we have to tune in to watch a confirmation hearing for a federal judge and hear about disgusting tabloid rumor trash it's their fault and it's really pathetic when you look back at what the judiciary used to be because in 1789 the Judiciary Act was passed two days later all of the appointments that President Washington had were confirmed by the Senate two days later initially there were six judges on the court this number moved up and down over time eventually by 1869 the number was settled at nine as you know President Roosevelt tried to pack the court didn't work out and but in those days it was a bit more serious certainly the Supreme Court was more serious now we're listening to a need a hill 2.0 anita hill two electric boogaloo it's even grosser than the first time and it's even less abstention ated than the first time and the first time was baseless as well why is that though why is it such a knock-down drag-out it's because we've given away so much power to the court we've given the court power to legislate on huge matters two that come to mind most egregiously obviously Roe vs. Wade the idea that the framers of the Constitution somehow enshrined a right to kill babies in it I don't know where that is I did haven't read that in any particular article obviously nobody's nobody even on the left really seriously thinks there's a right to abortion in the Constitution they just decided they were going to undercut the process of self-governance and say that we are the nine robed dictators are going to tell us how we're going to govern ourselves and then and then oh oh burrs fell obergefell in just a few years ago which invented a right to gay marriage which invented the redefinition of marriage to include monogamous same-sex couples but for some reason not polygamous same-sex couples because as the great Romantic poet Justice Kennedy found there's a right to intimacy in the Constitution somewhere at which in which Justice Scalia ironically pointed out that right to intimacy obviously would be restricted by marriage ask of nearest hippie we're allowing these nine rogue dictators to be our Romantic poets into governance and that's why it's going to get filthy and messy and gross that's why I actually understand why they take so seriously because they've used the left has used the Supreme Court as this dominating force for imposing their unpopular will in the American people for decades and decades so fair enough they're gonna fight dirty for it this doesn't mean that we should calm down I think some squishes want to say Oh everyone oh the right should calm down they should play really nice and you know make sure that they have their ascots all done up very well and no no way man the stakes are very very high here we've got a guy who is says he's going to interpret the Constitution by it's meaning when it was ratified and believe that words have meaning and that the the piece of paper has meaning and you've got other people who say I'm gonna ignore it I'm gonna torch the Constitution I'm gonna do whatever I want and pose my will on the people no wait don't we cannot let them get away with this it's ugly it's mucky it's gross but that's what we have to do we few we happy few we band of brothers we've got to do it because the stakes are very very high if you don't think they're high look at what the Democrats are pulling out to try to subvert it okay that's our show we've got a lot more to talk about but too bad ran too long tune in tomorrow and we'll try to cover everything else I'm sure that there will be fallout and get your mailbag questions in for Thursday in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show
