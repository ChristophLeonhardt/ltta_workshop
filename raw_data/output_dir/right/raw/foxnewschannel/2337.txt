11
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:12,740
IF THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTION

12
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,075

00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:14,976

29
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:38,199
>> THANK YOU.

30
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:38,866
>> Martha: WHY DO YOU THINK

31
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:39,533
AT THIS POINT THAT YOU ARE

32
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,268
BEHIND IN THE POLLS AND DO

33
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:41,435
YOU THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE

34
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:42,637
YOU DID RECENTLY SPEND TIME

35
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:47,408
IN PRISON?

36
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:49,243
>> I THINK I'M BEHIND IN THE

37
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:50,511
POLLS IS BECAUSE SENATOR

38
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,612
MCCONNELL HAS A SUPER PAC

39
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:54,849
THAT'S RUNNING, I THINK,

40
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:56,083
$1.5 MILLION WORTH OF ADS

41
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:56,550
AGAINST ME.

42
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,885
WE WERE EVEN BEFORE THAT.

43
00:00:57,885 --> 00:00:58,886
AND BEFORE ELECTION DAY WE

44
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:05,960
WILL BE EVEN OR AHEAD.

45
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,560
>> Martha: SPEAKING OF

46
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,261
SENATOR MCCONNELL YOU MADE A

47
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:08,029
COMMENT OVER THE COURSE OF

48
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:09,330
THIS WEEK THAT GOT QUITE A

49
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,331
BIT OF ATTENTION.

50
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:11,499
LET'S PLAY THAT AND THEN YOU

51
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:12,166
CAN TALK ABOUT YOUR

52
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:12,767
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

53
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:17,271
>> I HAVE AN ISSUE WHEN THE

54
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:18,105
FATHER-IN-LAW IS A WEALTHY

55
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:19,874
KIND OF PERSON AND HAS A LOT

56
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:21,042
OF CONNECTIONS TO SOME OF

57
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:22,310
THE BRAS IF YOU WILL IN

58
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,610
CHINA.

59
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,812
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

60
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:25,579
AGAINST HIS WIFE.

61
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,015
I'M SAYING IT'S HER FATHER

62
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:32,853
THAT IS WELL CONNECTED IN

63
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:33,955
CHINA.

64
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:34,655
>> Martha: I SPOKE WITH

65
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:36,757
SENATOR MCCONNELL ON OTHER

66
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:37,091
TOPICS.

67
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:37,925
I WANTED TO GET HIS REACTION

68
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:40,094
TO THAT HE DID NOT RESPOND

69
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:42,063
DIRECTLY TO WHAT HE SAID BUT

70
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:43,397
HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.

71
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:44,131
WHO DO YOU SUPPORT.

72
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:45,199
>> THERE I'M NOT IN THAT

73
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:45,499
RACE.

74
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:46,901
I HOPE THEY NOMINATE SOMEONE

75
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:47,835
WHO CAN ACTUALLY WIN THE

76
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:51,038
GENERAL ELECTION.

77
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:51,872
>> Martha: THAT BREAKS DOWN

78
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,807
INTO TWO QUESTIONS.

79
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:54,442
UP THE FIRST THING IS ABOUT

80
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,710
THE CHINA PERSON COMMENT.

81
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,811
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING BY

82
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:57,111
THAT?

83
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,313
>> WELL, I THINK PRESIDENT

84
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:00,648
TRUMP IS CONSIDERING TARIFFS

85
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:02,083
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE

86
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:02,917
TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH

87
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,218
CHINA IS THE BIGGEST TRADING

88
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:08,689
RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE.

89
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,024
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

90
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:11,292
DECISIONS ON THAT TRADE

91
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,193
AGREEMENT WITH DONE IN

92
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:13,327
AMERICA'S BEST INTEREST AND

93
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:14,395
NO PERSONAL BEST INTEREST.

94
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:19,033
IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY

95
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,101
CORPORATION OR ANY BUSINESS

96
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:20,434
ENTITY.

97
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:21,335
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE HAVE

98
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:22,536
YOU NO CONFLICTS OF

99
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:22,903
INTEREST.

100
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:23,938
IT'S NO ACCUSATION THERE.

101
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:25,039
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S

102
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,307
IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY BE

103
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,943
DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR THE

104
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:29,343
COUNTRY.

105
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:30,011
>> Martha: YOU SAID NO

106
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:31,112
ACCUSATION, BUT YOU POINTED

107
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,346
OUT THAT MR. MCCONNELL'S

108
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,982
WIFE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A

109
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:36,250
PROMINENT FORMER CHINESE

110
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,717
BUSINESSMAN.

111
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:38,185
SO THAT SUGGESTION -- SOUNDS

112
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:39,053
LIKE YOU ARE SUGGESTING HE

113
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:40,621
HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST

114
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:41,255
BECAUSE OF.

115
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:43,424
THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE

116
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:43,824
SUGGESTING?

117
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:44,525
>> WELL, YES.

118
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:45,793
I MEAN, I'M NOT SUGGESTING

119
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:46,761
THERE IS A CONFLICT OF

120
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:48,062
INTEREST IN ANY BUSINESS

121
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:49,130
WORLD THAT WOULD BE A

122
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,131
CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

123
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:51,432
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

124
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,434
WHETHER YOU KNOW IT WOULD

125
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:56,470
IMPACT HIS DECISION MAKING

126
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,538
OR POSITION ON THESE ISSUES.

127
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:59,006
HE HAS IN THE PAST TAKEN

128
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,107
SOME STRANGE POSITIONS.

129
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:04,478
FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER TIANANMEN

130
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:06,347
SQUARE HE WAS ONE OF THE

131
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:07,214
SENATORS LETTING TRADE

132
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:08,949
CONTINUE WITH CHINA DESPITE

133
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:09,950
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND

134
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,088
VOTED IN THAT MANNER.

135
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:16,657
HE HAS HAD VOTES WITH CHINA

136
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:17,591
THAT ONE WOULD QUESTION.

137
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,759
THE BASE ISSUE HERE IS THAT

138
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,627
BUSINESSES ARE ALWAYS

139
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:20,728
CONCERNED ABOUT CONFLICT OF

140
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:21,962
INTEREST WHEN THEY ARE

141
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:22,763
NEGOTIATING DEALS.

142
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:24,065
IN THIS CASE WE JUST NEED TO

143
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:26,367
BE AWARE OF THEM.

144
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:26,934
>> Martha: UNDERSTOOD.

145
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:27,635
I WANT TO JUST ASK YOU ABOUT

146
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:28,335
WEST VIRGINIA BEFORE I LET

147
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:29,036
DID YOU GO BECAUSE WE ARE

148
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:30,171
GOING TO RUN OUT OF TIME.

149
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,672
IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, THEY

150
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:33,107
ARE LAST IN BUSINESS,

151
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:34,442
ACCORDING TO FORBES AND

152
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:35,476
FIRST IN OPIOID USE.

153
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,044
WHY ARE YOU THE BEST PERSON

154
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:39,814
TO TURN YOUR STATE AROUND?

155
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:42,316
>> WELL, ONE THING I IS I

156
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:43,384
HAVE IN THE GOTTEN GIVEN A

157
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,985
CHANCE TO TURN IT AROUND AND

158
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,520
MY TWO OPPONENTS HAVE.

159
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,089
ONE LOB IDEA FOR DRUG

160
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:48,789
COMPANIES ONE IS

161
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:49,390
REPRESENTING AND HAS

162
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,758
REPRESENTED FOR 20 YEARS THE

163
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:51,759
CITY THAT'S WORST IN THE

164
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,961
NATION PER CAPITA IN POET

165
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,130
DRUG DEATHS.

166
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,832
IT'S NOT EASY TOTAL

167
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:58,232
DIFFERENCE.

168
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,700
I HAVE HOT HAD THAT

169
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,101
OPPORTUNITY.

170
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,602
THE COMPANY I RAN WE WERE

171
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:01,969
DRUG-FREE.

172
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,404
WE WERE VERY TOUGH ON DRUGS.

173
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:04,238
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE

174
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:05,539
VERY TOUGH ON DRUGS AND

175
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,408
THAT'S WHAT I WILL BE.

176
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:08,042
>> Martha: WE HAVE MORE

177
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:08,976
CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU NEXT

178
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:09,677
TUESDAY NIGHT.

179
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:10,344
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

180
00:04:10,344 --> 00:00:00,000
BEING HERE, SIR.
