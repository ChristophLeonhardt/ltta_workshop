thank you very much everybody appreciate it we're getting ready to go back had a tremendous 24 hours we've had a tremendous three months actually because this has been going on for quite a while that was a tape that we gave to chairman Kim and his people his representatives and captures a lot captures what could be done that's a great a great place has a potential to be an incredible place between South Korea if you think about it in China it's got tremendous potential and I think he understands that and he wants to do what's right it's my honor today to address the people of the world following this very historic summit with chairman kim jongwan of north korea spent very intensive hours together and i think most of you have gotten the signed document or you will very shortly it's very comprehensive it's going to happen I stand before you as an emissary of the American people to deliver a message of hope and vision and a message of peace let me begin by thanking our incredible hosts in Singapore especially Prime Minister Lee friend of mine this is a country of profound grace and beauty and we send our warmest wishes to every citizen of Singapore's to really made this visit so important and so pleasant despite all of the work at all of the long hours I also want to thank president moon of South Korea he's working hard in fact I'll be speaking to him right after we're finished Prime Minister Abbey of Japan friend of mine just left our country and he wants what's right for Japan and for the world good man and a very special person President Xi of China who has really closed up that border maybe a little bit less so over the last of months but that's okay but he really has and he's a terrific person and a friend of mine and a really a great leader of his people I want to thank them for their efforts to help us get to this very historic day most importantly I want to thank chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people our unprecedented meeting the first between an American president and a leader of North Korea proves that real change is indeed possible my meeting with chairman Kim was honest direct and productive we got to know each other well in a very confined period of time under very strong strong circumstance we're prepared to start a new history and were ready to write a new chapter between our nation's nearly 70 years ago think of that 70 years ago an extremely bloody conflict ravaged the Korean Peninsula countless people died in the conflict including tens of thousands of brave Americans yet while the armistice was agreed to the war never ended to this day never ended but now we can all have hope that it will soon end and it will it will soon end the past does not have to define the future yesterday's conflict does not have to be tomorrow's war and as history has proven over and over again adversaries can indeed become friends we can honor the sacrifice of our forefathers by replacing the horrors of battle with the blessings of peace and that's what we're doing and that's what we have done there is no limit to what North Korea can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces Commerce and engagement with the rest of the world that really wants to engage chairman Kim has before him an opportunity like no other to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security and prosperity for his people chairman Kim and I just signed a joint statement in which he reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula we also agreed to vigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible and he wants to do that this isn't the past this isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done chairman Kim has told me that North Korea is already destroyed a major missile engine testing site that's not in your sign document we agreed to that after the agreement was signed that's a big thing for the missiles that they were testing the site is going to be destroyed very soon today is the beginning of an arduous process our eyes are wide open but pieces always worth the effort especially in this case they should have been done years ago they should have been resolved a long time ago but we're resolving it now chairman Kim has the chance to seize an incredible future for his people anyone can make war but only the most courageous can make peace the current state of affairs cannot endure forever the people of Korea North and South a profoundly talented industrious and gifted these are truly gifted people they share the same heritage language customs culture and destiny but to realize their amazing destiny to reunite their national family the Menace of nuclear weapons will now be removed in the meantime the sanctions will remain in effect we dream of a future where all Koreans can live together in harmony where families are reunited and hope so reborn and where the light of peace chases away the darkness of war this bright future is winner with it and this is what's happening it is right there it's within our reach it's going to be there it's going to happen people thought this could never take place it is now taking place it's a very great day it's a very great moment in the history of the world and chairman Kim is on his way back to North Korea and I know for a fact as soon as he arrives he's going to start a process that's gonna make a lot of people very happy and very safe so it's an honor to be with everybody today the media is a big gathering of media I will say makes me feel very uncomfortable but it is what it is people understand that this is something very important to all of us including yourselves and your family so thank you very much for being here we'll take some questions wow it's a lot of questions go ahead well he is very talented anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough I don't say it was nice or I don't say anything about it he rented very few people at that age you can take one out of 10,000 probably couldn't do it otto warmbier is a very special person and he will be for a long time in my life his parents are good friends of mine I think without Otto this would not have happened something happened from that day it was a terrible thing it was brutal but a lot of people started to focus what was going on including North Korean I really think that Otto is someone who did not die in vain I told this to his parents special young men and and I have to say special parents special people Otto did not die in vain he had a lot to do with us being here today no we're not reducing anything we're not reducing at some point I have to be honest that I've used to say this during my campaign as you know probably better than most I want to get our soldiers out I want to bring our soldiers back though we have right now 32,000 soldiers in South Korea and I'd like to be able to bring them back home but that's not part of the equation right now at some point I hope it will be but not right them we will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money unless and until we see that the future negotiation is not going along like it should but we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money plus I think it's very provocative yes yes go ahead oh go ahead I'm sorry I thought you would join Robert I looked at you look much better no no not at all because if you look at it I mean it said we are going to let's say here it will be gone we I don't think you can be any more plain than what we're what we're asking issues related to the establishment of the new u.s. dpk our relations the building we talked about the guarantees and we talked about unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula this is the document that we did yes we did and will be verified yep we'll be verifying it'll be verified well it's going to be achieved by having a lot of people there and as we develop a certain trust and we think we have done that secretary Pompeo has been really doing a fantastic job his staff everybody as we do that we could have a lot of people there and we're going to be working with them on a lot of other things but this is complete d nuclearization of North Korea and it will be verified combinations of both combinations of both and we have talked about it yes yeah he nice I mean very fair question we he actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past and ultimately as you know nothing got done in one case they took billions of dollars during the Clinton regime took billions of dollars and nothing happened that was a terrible thing and he actually brought it up to me and he said we have never gone this far I don't think they've ever had the confidence frankly and a president that they have right now for getting things done and having the to get things done and he was very firm in the fact that he wants to do this I think you might want to do this as much or even more than me because they see a very bright future for North Korea so you never know right we never know but I'll tell you why we signed a very comprehensive document today and I think most of you have been given that document but we signed a very very comprehensive document and I believe he's gonna live up to that document in fact when he lands which is going to be shortly I think that he will start that process right away I do I do I can only say that I know him for really well it's been very rhetorical as you know I think without the rhetoric it wouldn't have happened I think without other things going along I think the establishment of a new team was very important they have a great team but I do I think he wants to get it done I really feel that very strongly on this John I think you know you two guys look alike when the light is right on the the hair is very similar let me see who has better hair he's got pretty good hair John it's the Angelica glow of the backlighting mr. president that makes us look so similar of course the depolarization North Korea another huge problem is the horrible record that they have on human rights was that discussed in yes it was discussed it will be discussed for in the future Human Rights was also discussed in great detail John was the fact that you know we have and I must have had just countless calls and letters and tweets anything you can do they want the remains of their sons back they want the remains of their fathers and mothers and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war which took place to a large extent in North Korea and I asked for today and we got it that was a very last minute the remains will be coming back they're going to start that process immediately but so many people even during the campaign that say is there any way you can work with North Korea to get the remains of my son back well my father back so many people ask me this question and you know I said we don't get along too well with that particular group of people but now we do and he agreed to that so quickly and so nice it was really a very nice thing and he understands he understands it so for the thousands and thousands I guess weigh over 6,000 that we know of in terms of the remains they'll be brought back especially to a lot of people that are what do you president expect kidding John hood to do about the human rights record regarding the North Korean people right it was discussed it was discussed relatively briefly compared to the nuclearization obviously that's where we started and where we ended but they will be doing things and I think he wants to do things I think he wants to you'd be very surprised very smart very good negotiator wants to do the right thing you know he brought up the fact that in the past they took dialogue for they never went they never were like we are there's never been anything like what's taking place down but they went down the line billions of dollars was yet were given and you know the following day the nuclear program continued but this is a much different time and this is a much different president than all fairness is very important to me this was one of the perhaps one of the reasons that I want I campaigned on this issue as you know very well Chuck okay whoever those people are I can I cannot see you with all the lights but you don't look like either of the two yeah go ahead thank you very much appreciate it well at a certain time I will I said that will be a day that I look very much forward to at the appropriate time and I also will be inviting chairman Kim at the appropriate time to the White House I would I think it's really going to be something that will be very important and he has accepted I said at the appropriate time we want to go a little bit further down the road but what we signed today was a lot of things included and then you have things that weren't included that we got after the deal was signed I've done that before in my life we didn't put it in the agreement because we didn't have time and I think most of you have been handed at the agreement or soon will but I oh you have not okay well if you could have those agreements passed that we just finished them just a little while ago but if you could have the agreements passed out well you'll see what we're talking about yes sir mm great troops yeah it did abduction absolutely Prime Minister Abhi's one of his certainly other than the whole the nuking subject certainly his I would say his main point and I brought it up absolutely and they're gonna be working on that it will be we didn't put it down in the document but it will be work done Christians yes we are brought it up very strongly you know Franklin Graham spent spent and spends a tremendous amount of time in North Korea he's got it very close to his heart it did come up and things will be happening okay thank you great question yes John and you at that point said North Korea has more brutally oppressed its people than any other John I believe it's a rough situation over there there's no question about it and we did discuss it today pretty strongly I mean knowing what the main purpose of what we were doing is Dino King but disgusted and a pretty good length we'll be doing something on it it's it's rough it's rough in a lot of places by the way not just there but it's rough and we will continue that and I think ultimately will agree to something but it was discussed at length outside of outside of the nuclear situation one of the primary topics I think it will change you I think it probably has to but I think it will yeah thank you thank you very much Steve that's you Steve right there well you know scientifically I've been watching and reading a lot about this and it does take a long time to you know pull off completely nuclearization it takes a long time scientifically you have to wait certain periods of time and a lot of things happen but despite that once you start the process it means it's pretty much over can't use them that's the good news and that's going to start very soon I believe that's going to start very soon we will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done Steve the sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor sanctions played a big role but they'll come off at that point I hope it's going to be soon but they'll come off they as you know and as I've said the sanctions right now remain but at a certain point I actually look forward to taking them off and they'll come off when we we know we're down the road where it's not going to happen nothing's gonna happen yes go ahead please thank you thank you thank you very much congratulations to everybody by the way congratulations to everybody previously promised they had or actually well you have a different administration you have a different president you have a different Secretary of State you have people that are you know it's very important to him and we get it done the other groups maybe it wasn't a priority I don't think they could have done it if it wasn't priority frankly I don't think they honestly could have done it even if it was a priority and it would have been easier in fact that would have been for me it would have been much easier if this were ten years ago or five years ago and I'm not just blaming President Obama I mean this goes back for 25 years this should have happened I always given a very tough hand was given this I was given the Iran diem and plenty of other problems but we are we're doing really well and the Iran deal I have to be honest we I did it because nuclear is always number one to me nuclear is number one but on the Iran deal I think Iran is a different country now than it was three or four months ago I don't think they're looking so much to the Mediterranean I don't think they're looking so much yet Syria like they were with total confidence I don't think they're so confident right now but I hope when that big said I hope that at the appropriate time after these sanctions kick in and they are brutal what we've put on Iran I hope that they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal because I'd love to be able to do that but right now it's too soon for that yes good question hopefully soon but we'll have to get things moving first very a little bit early for that we have to get things moving yes go ahead yeah we've done exercises for a long period of time working with South Korea and we call them wargames and I call them wargames and they're tremendously expensive the amount of money that we spend on that is incredible and South Korea contributes but not a hundred percent which is certainly a subject that we have to talk to them about also and that has to do with the military expense and also the trade so we're doing that we actually have a new deal with South Korea in terms of the trade deal but we have to talk to them we have to talk to many countries about treating us fairly but the war games are very expensive we pay for a big majority of them we fly in bombers from Guam I said it when I first started I said whether the bombers come from Guam nearby I said oh great you buy where's nearby six and a half hours six and a half hours it's a long time for these big massive planes to be flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place and then go back to Guam I know a lot about airplanes it's very expensive and and I didn't like it and what I what I did say is and I think it's very provocative I have to tell you Jennifer it's a very provocative situation one when I see that and you have a country right next door so under the circumstances that we're negotiating a very comprehensive complete deal I think it's inappropriate to be having war games so number one we save money a lot and number two it really is something that I think they very much appreciated well we've gotten you know I've heard that I mean some of the the people that I never maybe they really made it I don't I don't always want to go against the press because I just don't especially not today this is too important but I noticed that some of the people are saying that the president has agreed to meet he has given up so much I gave up nothing I'm here I haven't slept in 25 hours but I thought it was appropriate to do because we've been negotiating for literally round-the-clock with them and with us and with John and with Mike and a whole team of very talented people but we haven't given up anything other than you're right I agreed to meet and I think the meeting was every bit as good for the United States as it was for North Korea but I just wrote down some of the things we got and they you know they sure they got a meeting but only a person that dislikes Donald Trump would say that I've agreed to make a big commitment sure I've agreed to take a period of time and come here and meet and that's good but I think it's great for us and I as a country and I think it's good for them but what did they do to justify this meeting secured commitment for complete D nuclearization that's the big thing they secured the release of three American hostages they already gave them to us two months ago these people now living happily back in their homes with their families and it was pretty rough for them to put it mildly secure the commitment to recover their remains including these are of fallen heroes and they're giving a commitment that starting it immediately to recover the remains and I just went through how many people asked me about it I was amazed actually so many people would ask me is it possible is it possible at that time we had no relationship to chairman Kim or to anybody else in North Korea you know it was a very closed Society so we're getting the remains back secured the halt of all missile and nuclear tests for how long has it been seven months you haven't had a missile go up for seven months you haven't had a nuclear test you haven't had a nuclear explosion I remember a nuclear event took place 8.8 in the Richter scale and they announced I heard it on the radio they announced that a massive you know earthquake took place somewhere in Asia and then they said it was in North Korea and then they found out it was a nuclear test I said I never heard of a rector scale in the high eights and if you look there has been no missile launches they've blown up their missile area that's going to take place that has not been written into the contract we're gonna give you the exact details on that but they've secured a halt of all missiles and of all nuclear tests they secured the closure of their single primary nuclear test flight test site all three of them they're in an area that's common around each other they secured the closure they secured the commitment to destroy the missile engine testing site that was not a near agreement I got that after we signed the agreement hissing do me a favor you've got this missile engine testing site we know where it is because of the heat we it's incredible the equipment we have to be honest with you I said can you close it up you're gonna close it up we maintain the ability to continue to apply sanctions so we're applying sanctions now I had 300 sanctions that I was getting ready to put on last week and I said you know I can't really put on sanctions when I'm meeting with I thought it would be very disrespectful 300 very big ones powerful ones and I said it would be disrespectful so Jennifer when you look at all of those things that we got and when we got our hostages back I didn't pay 1.8 billion in cash like the hostages that came back from Iran was a disgraceful situation what took place so we've gotten a lot so when I hear somebody in the media saying that President Trump has agreed to meet like it's not a big deal to meet I think we should meet on a lot of different topics not just this one and I really believe a lot of great things can happen yes go ahead well that's what they're doing that's what they're doing and I don't think there's no time I'm here one day we're together for many hours intensively but the process is now going to take place and I would be surprised Mike if they haven't even started already they have started they blew up their sites they blew up their testing saying so but I will say he knew prior to coming you know this wasn't like surprise it wasn't like we've never discussed it we discussed it Mike discussed it very and very strongly with this counterpart in North Korea they knew that this was let's say they didn't agree to that I couldn't sign an eager there was no agreement that could have been safe so they understood that and it wasn't a big point today because really this had been taken care of more than any other thing because it was all about this this has been taken care of before we got here so when we brought that up today you see the language it's very strong it's in the document yes ma'am well I don't want to talk yeah I know that's a tough thing to talk about because I don't want to be threatening I don't want to be threatening they understood that and you've seen what was perhaps going to happen and you know Seoul has 28 million people we think we have big cities you look at New York where it has 8 million people we think it's a big city Seoul has 28 million people think of it and it's right next to the border it's right next to the DMZ it's right there I mean if this would have happened I think you know I've heard Oh a hundred thousand people I think you could have lost 20 million people 30 million people this is really an honor for me to be doing this because I think you know potentially you could have lost you know 30 40 50 million people the city of Seoul one of the biggest cities in the world it's right next to the the border well at that time we needed perhaps fire in fear because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States and certainly Japan wasn't going to allow it either Japan is right next door yeah today yeah we had it made up by some I hope you liked it I thought it was good I thought it was interesting enough to show one in English and one in Korean and we hadn't made up I showed it to him today actually during the meeting toward the end of the meeting and I think he loved it he they were given we didn't have a big screen like you have the luxury of having we didn't need it because we had it on the cassette and an iPad and they played it and about eight of their representatives who are watching it and I thought they were fascinated but I thought it was well done I showed it to you because that's the future I mean that could very well be in the future and the other alternative is just not a very good alternative it's just not good but I showed up because I really want him to do something now I don't think I had to show it because I really believe he wants to I think he wants to get it done yes go ahead how step now in fairy doing okay he wrote the best story about me with the Staten Island Ferry and after that he's never written a good story I don't know look I don't know what happened it's a long time ago well first of all I think it's a very fair question I had a very good meeting with the g7 and I left the meeting and I'll be honest we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries very first seriously now the United States because of bad management at the top because of presidents that didn't care about trade or didn't understand it or whatever reason for many years with China being obviously the most successful at it but the European Union is second 151 billion we lost they were represented at the meeting and we're being taken advantage of on trade Canada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits we have a big trade deficit with Canada I was reading where oh it's actually soaked with not a surplus it's either 17 but it could actually be a hundred you know they put out a document I don't know if you saw it they didn't want me to see it but we found it perhaps they were trying to show the power they have it's close to a hundred billion dollars a year loss with Canada they don't take our farm products many of them they charge what was 270 percent but somebody told me the other day that a few months ago they raised it two hundred ninety five percent for dairy products and it's very unfair to our farmers and it's very unfair to the people of our country the workers the farmers the companies and we are not able to trade they have tremendous barriers up they have tremendous tariffs so when I put in a countervailing tariff just to get us up a little bit so the balance isn't so much it's like this but they said oh that's so terrible I said what's terrible we have to catch you a little bit we have to have a little balance even if it's not complete we have to have a little balance I say this with many countries anyway we we came we finished the meeting really everybody was happy and I agreed to sign something I asked for changes I demanded changes said those changes were made in fact the picture with Angela Merkel who I get along with very well where I'm sitting there like this that picture was were waiting for the document because I wanted to see the final document as changed by the changes of our requested it was a very friendly I know it didn't look friendly and I know it was reported like sort of nasty both ways I was angry at her she actually we were just talking the whole room about something unrelated to everything very friendly waiting for the document to come back so I could read it before I leave anyway I loved it it was very friendly when I got out to the plane I think that Justin probably didn't know that Air Force One is about 20 televisions and I see the television and he's giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States and I say push him around would you shake hands it was very friendly but countries cannot continue to take advantage of us on trade the numbers are out over the last couple of years and over the last many years but over the last couple of years this country has lost 800 billion dollars on trade with other countries the biggest one being China eight hundred billion dollars a hundred and fifty 1 billion with the European Union they don't take our agricultural products barely they don't take a lot of what we have and yet they send Mercedes into us they send BMWs into by the minions it's very unfair and it's very unfair to all workers and I'm gonna straighten it out and it won't even be tough okay thank you go ahead I would like to involve Congress yes and no I have a good relationship with Justin Trudeau I really did other than he had a news conference that he had because he assumed I was in an aeroplane and I wasn't watching he learned it's gonna cost a lot of money for the people of Canada you learned you can't do that you can't do that we left we had a very good relationship I've had a good relationship with Justin I have a good relationship with all I have a very good relationship with Angela Merkel but when NATO we're paying 4.2% she's paying 1% of a much smaller GDP than we have we're paying 4.2 percent on a much larger we're paying for I mean anyone can say from 60 to 90 percent of NATO and we're protecting countries of Europe and then on top of it they kill us on trade so we just can't have it that way some fair to our taxpayers and to our people but no I have a good relationship with Justin and I have a I think a very good relationship with chairman Kim right now I really do I think I hope it's good because if it is we're gonna solve a very big problem I think we've gone a long way to solving it today should we keep going for a little I don't know it's up to the legendary Sarah Huckabee Sanders should we keep going Sarah okay we'll go well I don't care hey you know it just means we get home a little later in the evening right yeah go ahead sure beautiful country I did yes we're getting together next week to go into the details secretary Pompeii oh yeah next week with John Bolton and our entire team to go over the details and to get this stuff done we want to get it done he wants to get it done we're also working very much with South Korea we're working with Japan we're working with China to a lesser extent but we're working with China I would come back LAN Lee your Prime Minister was fantastic we're with him yesterday he's done a great job it was very welcoming it really probably had it probably made a different section it's great place thank you very much I've said that about relationships I've said that about people you know in the first second now I was generous I said five seconds but you know in the first second in some cases sometimes that doesn't work out but sometimes it does from the beginning we got along but there's been a lot of groundwork this wasn't like we went and we started talking about as you know right we didn't just come in and start talking about these very complex subjects that have been going on for 70 years we've been discussing this for months and you know once the rhetoric stopped once they did agree a great thing you know North Korea did a great thing by going to the Olympics because the Olympics and president moon will tell you this the Olympics was not exactly doing great people didn't feel like being bombed out of the opening ceremonies you know they weren't exactly selling tickets and as soon as as soon as the Chairman chairman Kim said let's participate in the Olympics it sold like wildfire and was a great successes in Olympics it was a great success he did a great thing but since that time pretty much since that time because a delegation came from South Korea who had just met with North Korea they came to the White House they told me lots of things including the fact that they'd be willing to Dinu we have one of their great people here today that they were willing to die nuke and once that started we have been we've been really talking about that from the end of the Olympics when the whole delegation came to say various things including well I think can you insure anything can I ensure that you're going to be able to sit down properly when you sit down I mean you can't insure anything all I can say is they want to make a deal that's what I do my whole life has been deals I've done great at it and that's what I do and I know when somebody wants to deal and I know when somebody does and a lot of politicians don't that's not their thing but it is my thing I mean again this really could have been done I think easier a long time ago but I know for if I just feel very strongly my instinct my ability or talent they want to make a deal and make it a deal is a great thing for the world it's also a great thing for China because I can't imagine that China has you know is happy with somebody having nuclear weapons so close so you know that's China was very helpful so I think he wants to make a deal can anybody be certain but we're going to be certain soon because the negotiations continue okay thank you very much go ahead no I think I'd help them because I think things will change I think I've helped them there's nothing I can say all I can do is do what I can do we have to stop the nuclear zation we have to do other things and that's a very important thing so at a certain point hopefully you'll be able to ask me a much more positive question gonna make a statement but not much I can do right now at a certain point I really believe he's going to do things about it I think they I think they are one of the great winners today that large group of people that you're talking about I think ultimately they're going to be one of the great winners as a group yes sir good good would you know I want significant improvement I want to know that it won't be happening and again once you start that process there will be a point at which even though you won't be finished for a while because it can't happen scientifically or mechanically but you're not going to be able to go back you know once we reach that point I'll start to give that very serious thought yes go ahead go ahead go ahead you first well I think that South Korea and I think that Japan will help them very greatly I think they're prepared to help them they know they're going to have to help them I think they can help them very greatly we won't have to help them the United States has been paying a big price at a lot of different places but South Korea which obviously is right next door in Japan which essentially is next to her they're going to be helping them and I think they're going to be doing a very generous job and it picture so they will be helping them yes ma'am go ahead behind yes thank you well I don't know when you say a long time I think we will do it as fast as it can be done scientifically as fast as it can be done mechanically I don't think I mean I've read horror stories it's a 15 year process okay if something you wanted to do it quickly I don't believe that I think whoever wrote that is wrong but there will be a point at which when you were 20% through you can't go back I had an uncle who was a great professor for I believe 40 years at MIT and I used to discuss nuclear with him all the time he was a great expert he was a great brilliant genius dr. John Trump at MIT I think it was there 40 years I was still in fact the head of MIT sent me a book on my uncle and but we used to talk about nuclear talking about a very complex subject it's not just like oh gee let's get rid of the news it takes it takes a period of time but the make period of time that I'm talking is that first period when you when you hit a certain point you can't go back it's very hard to go back we don't know but it'll go pretty quickly go ahead Chinese are not doing this great a job securing the border as they were before you express you know some Daleks when Kim went to see President Xi the Russian Foreign Minister was in Pyongyang and said there shouldn't be any sanctions while these negotiations are under way and the South Koreans are now talking about restoring some form of trade so with all those players appearing to be moving toward eroding sanctions well I think we have a lot of leverage I think we have tremendous leverage I do believe that China despite my relationship with President Xi a man who I told you I have great respect for and like also a lot you know we're having very tough talks on trade and I think that probably affects China some one but I have to do what I have to do and I think over the last two months the border is more open than it was when we first started but that is what it is we have to do it we had a we have a tremendous tremendous deficit in trade commonly known as a trade deficit we have a tremendous deficit in trade with China we have to do something about we can't continue to let that happen and I think that has had an impact on my relationship in terms of the border I don't think it has a relationship you know I don't think it affects my my feeling on my relationship to President Xi but when we first started we weren't ready to go that route and as we started preparing and and getting ready to do that I think that's had an impact on frankly the border which is a shame but I have to do it I have no choice for a country have to do it South Korea will do whatever is necessary to get a deal but if that means we can't trade we're not going to trade they're definitely not going to trade if they think and they would do this with our concurrence if they think that they can do some work because we're very far down the line we're actually very far you know that document when you read it today that's far down the line that's not something that just happened to be together this was done over months and again the rhetoric was important in the sanctions were important I don't even know which one was more important they were both well David I can tell you he understands he understands it so well he understands it better than the people that are doing the work for him that is an easy one as far as what he has it's substantial very substantial the timing will go quickly I believe you'll see some good action I mean as an example one of the things with the missile said I think you probably surprised to hear that that was a throwing at the end the missile set but I really believe David that it's going to go very quickly I really believe that it's going to go fast and it is a very substantial arsenal there's no question about it you know I used to say maybe it's all talk and no action but we have pretty good intelligence into that although probably less there than any other country you understand that maybe better than anybody in the room probably less there than any other country but we have enough intelligence to know that what they have is very substantial this is why David I always say that this shouldn't have taken place so late into the process wouldn't this have been better if it was five years ago or 20 years ago or 15 years ago and we didn't have to worry about not having a successful meeting like today so and I still love my first interview with you David I still have that interview actually yeah go ahead thank you we haven't set that up we'll probably need another summit will probably need or meeting we could use a different term but we'll probably need another one we'll probably I will say this were much further along than I would have thought I did not think would be I thought and I've told me but I didn't want to build up people's hopes too much I told people I thought that this would be a successful meeting if we got along we developed a relationship and we could have maybe gotten to this point in three or four months from now but it really happened very quickly a lot of that was because of the foundation that was you know put down before we met a lot of things happened very fast we didn't have as an example bringing back the remains that was not one of the things that was on our agenda today I brought it up at the very end because so many people had talked to me about it and I brought it up at the very end and he was really very gracious instead of saying well let's talk about it the next time he said it makes sense we will do it and he knew you know they know where many of those incredible people are with it buried along roads along highways along paths usually because our soldiers were moving back and forth and that it moved rapidly it's very sad but he knew and that was brought up at the very end and you know it was really great that he was able to do it a lot of people are going to be very happy about that yes go ahead please thank you thank you thank you for the nice way you're treating us we appreciate it really it's very good it's really beautiful what you do now I'll probably get this killer a question it's a good question so you saw tape today and that I think was done really well but that was done at the highest level of future development I told him you may not want this you may want to do a much smaller version of this I mean you're gonna do something but you may want to do a smaller version you may not want that with the trains and everything you know super everything that top and maybe you won't want that it's gonna be up to them it's gonna be up to them it's gonna be able to the people what they want they may not want that I can understand that too but that was a version of what could happen what could take place as an example they have great beaches you see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean right I said boy look at that wouldn't that make a great condo beyond and I explained I said you know instead of doing that you could have the best hotels in the world right there think of it from a real estate perspective you have South Korea you have China and they own the land in the middle how bad is that right it's great but I told them I said you may not want to do what's there you may want to do a smaller version of it or you know and that could be although I tell you what he he looked at that tape he looked at that iPad and I'm telling you they they they really enjoyed it I believe okay yeah go ahead couple more okay we'll do three more yes hi Brian my other cover again this week why have I been so many comfortable in one way you know I think that I think that I don't view it that way see I don't view it that way I'll do whatever it takes to make the world a safer place if I have to say I'm sitting on a stage I mean I understand what you're getting at if I have to say I'm sitting on a stage with chairman Kim and that's going to get us to save 30 million lives could be more than that I'm willing to sit on the stage I'm willing to travel the Singapore very proudly very gladly again I you know other than the fact that it is taking my time they had given up a tremendous amount they've given it up even before and even add the Olympics to it you know you could add the Olympics to the question they went to the Olympics they took an Olympics that was going to be a massive failure that maybe wouldn't have even opened and they made it a tremendous success by agreeing to participate add that to the list of things that they've done so right if I can save millions of lives by coming here sitting down and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man who's got firm control of a country and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons it's my honor to do it no I'm not concerned we can use that video for other countries go ahead got a breast by Kim jong-il got impressed yeah he did a great deal and he spent three billion dollars and got nothing they started making nuclear weapons process before you the u.s. president meet with leader North Korea with pressing I think we just answer oh I understand it much better than you do okay yeah go ahead go ahead thank you very much and much more no I think he'll do it I really believe that otherwise I wouldn't be doing this I really believe in it was really the engine testing site in addition to all of the other things that they've agreed to do it was the they have a very powerful engine testing site that again we're able to see because of the heat that they that it emits and yeah I'm able to I'm very happy I'll tell you what I'm very happy with those two points there's two points you mentioned but I think you might be referring to the thing that's not in which is the engine testing site I think he's I think honestly I think he's gonna do these things I may be wrong I mean I may stand before you in six months and say hey I was wrong I don't know that I'll ever admit that but I'll find us I'll find some kind of an excuse okay one more come on well my expectation about China is that China is a great country with a great leader and a friend of mine and I really believe that he's happy that we've made this kind of progress that I've heard from but I will be calling a virtually maybe even before I land okay and and I have to say you know and the United States is a great country and we have sent records economically over seven trillion dollars in net worth addition to what we have and we are almost twice the size the economy of the United States nobody talks about this because you do hear a lot about China rightfully so but the United States now is almost twice the size of the economy of China we have a great country and we're on a correct path okay one more that'll be in our South Korea where South Korea I think you deserve go ahead go you deserve one yes you deserve one I just want to tell him about the meeting very successful and he'll be very much involved in the final negotiation he's a very very fine gentleman also a friend of mine and I look forward to speaking of he'll be very happy when he hears about I've already sent word to him about what happened I sent the document to him actually and all of the details behind the document so I'll be talking to him very shortly I like to have them involved also there's a question as to whether or not we're supposed to or whether or not we legally have to I don't care I think would be great to have China involved and also of course South Korea okay Mike do they have a transcript they probably have a rough transcript which you can give us if you have one I know they didn't record it I don't think they recorded it are there any recordings of it I wish there were because it is interesting stuff saying I don't we probably have some notes or something but they they have actually detailed notes I would imagine but we we had a great we had a great conversation was a very heartfelt conversation oh I don't have to verify cuz they have one of the great memories of all time so I don't have to okay okay yeah but I don't want to discuss it but what we did is we've had we've had numerous discussions we've had very important relationships established at Mike's level and other levels in fact a couple of people to hear from as you know from North Korea they're in the room we have a few people in the back also from the room so when we went into this final agreement very importantly we really didn't go in cold we went in with tremendous relationship and tremendous knowledge and I think that's why we got it done so I'm gonna head back I don't know about you folks but it's been a long time since I've taken it easy so now we can take it a little bit easy and then the work begins again and I appreciate everybody being we've answered your questions and thank you very much and sort of congratulations everybody because this is really to me it's a very important event in world history and to be really true to myself I have to add I want to get it completed so Mike our whole team has to get to work and get it completed because otherwise we've done a good job but if you don't get the ball over the goal line it doesn't mean enough okay so thank you and sort of congratulations to everybody in the room thank you very much appreciate ladies gentlemen please remain seated while the president and his travel cool departs
