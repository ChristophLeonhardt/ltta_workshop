1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:05,023
DO IT VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.

2
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:05,390
TUCKER?

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,593
>> Tucker: GREAT METAPHOR.

4
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:09,027
THANKS, ED.

5
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:10,662
IS THE NEW DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA

6
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:13,297
ACTUALLY A DEAL THAT IS GOOD FOR

7
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:14,599
THE UNITED STATES?

8
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,801
CAN WE TRUST THE UNITED STATES

9
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,836
TO FOLLOW IT?

10
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,838
DOUG McGREGOR IS HERE, THE

11
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:22,240
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,842
NEBRASKA ALSO JOINS US TONIGHT.

13
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:25,710
CONGRESSMAN, FIRST TO YOU.

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,646
IS THIS A DEAL THAT AMERICANS

15
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:30,448
OUGHT TO BE HAPPY ABOUT?

16
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,650
>> THE BEST WORD THAT I COULD

17
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,018
USE TO DESCRIBE THE LAST FEW

18
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:37,455
DAYS IS STUNNING.

19
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,390
IT'S ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE GIVEN

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,124
WHERE WE WERE JUST SIX MONTHS

21
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,592
AGO WHERE WE WERE ON THE

22
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:45,129
PRECIPICE OF SOME TYPE OF EVEN

23
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:45,797
POTENTIAL NUCLEAR EXCHANGE.

24
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:47,231
THE PRESIDENT HAS LEANED INTO

25
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:48,199
SOMETHING PRETTY RADICAL HERE

26
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,834
AND PERHAPS IT'S A NEW

27
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,202
ARCHITECTURE FOR 20 PER CENTURY

28
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:51,569
DIPLOMACY.

29
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:55,640
HE HAS SAID TO KIM JONG UN, WE

30
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,575
WILL DEAL WITH YOU FOR GOOD OR

31
00:00:57,575 --> 00:00:58,076
FOR ILL.

32
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,211
IF IT'S FOR ILL, WE WILL HURT

33
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:00,478
YOU.

34
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,448
IF IT'S GOOD, IT WILL CREATE THE

35
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:04,182
SPACE FOR PERHAPS AUTHENTIC

36
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:05,817
DIALOGUE AND FRIENDSHIP AND I

37
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:07,285
THINK HE ACCOMPLISHED THAT.

38
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:09,253
HE HAS REJECTED THE NORMS OF

39
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:11,155
OSSIFIED PROCEDURAL IS HIM AND

40
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,124
STAGNATION THAT GOVERN SO MANY

41
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:14,659
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND HE

42
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,464
TOOK A BOLD RISK AND DELIVERED

43
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:22,066
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

44
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:25,236
IT'S AN IMPORTANT AND GOOD FIRST

45
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:25,536
STEP.

46
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:26,838
>> Tucker: OSSIFIED PROCEDURAL

47
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:27,171
REALISM.

48
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,074
THAT'S A PHRASE I'M STEALING.

49
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:32,243
COLONEL, ARE YOU AS OPTIMISTIC?

50
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:34,479
>> EXTREMELY, I THINK THIS IS

51
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,681
DONALD TRUMP'S FINEST HOUR, AND

52
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:37,682
I'M SERIOUS.

53
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:38,983
DONALD TRUMP HAS RECOGNIZED

54
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:39,650
SOMETHING THAT OTHERS HAVE

55
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,386
REFUSED TO SEAT FOR A VERY LONG

56
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:42,920
TIME IN WASHINGTON.

57
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,989
IT'S NOT SIMPLY THAT NORTH KOREA

58
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:47,391
IS ON THE ROPES, IT IS.

59
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,661
IT'S ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE.

60
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:51,429
DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTOOD THAT AND

61
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:53,798
HE ALSO WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS IN

62
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:58,169
HIS MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT

63
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,606
SHE

64
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:04,242
XI, TREATED THEM AS EQUALS.

65
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:09,413
I THINK DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTAND

66
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:10,080
SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT WELL

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,782
UNDERSTOOD IN THE PENTAGON AT

68
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:11,449
THIS POINT OR IN MANY OTHER

69
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:12,150
PLACES IN WASHINGTON AND THAT

70
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,385
OUR COMPETITION WITH CHINA IS

71
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,520
ESSENTIALLY TECHNOLOGIC AND NOT

72
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,020
MILITARY.

73
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,389
THAT WAS THE KEY DEVELOPMENT

74
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,326
BECAUSE WITHOUT CHINA NONE OF

75
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,561
THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

76
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,263
>> Tucker: AND HEAT IT CLEARLY

77
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:28,666
STAND WITH WHAT HE SAID ABOUT

78
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,635
TRADE FROM CHINA.

79
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:32,069
CONGRESSMAN, THERE'S BEEN A LOT

80
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,237
OF TRADE STOMACH CRITICISM OF

81
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,772
THIS DEAL FROM THE LEFT, WITH

82
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:37,008
THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

83
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:40,611
BEEN GIVING AWAY THINGS IN

84
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:41,813
EXCHANGE FOR NOTHING.

85
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,015
SPEAK OUT THIS IS THE

86
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:46,918
COMBINATION OF FOREIGN POLICY

87
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:47,852
REALISM AND ENTREPRENEURIAL

88
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:48,820
DIPLOMACY.

89
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,959
AS I SAID, THIS IS NOT JUST

90
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,560
POTENTIALLY PREVENTING A

91
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,160
CONFLICT AND REJECTING A

92
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,894
STALEMATE OF THE LAST 65 YEARS

93
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,629
WITH NORTH KOREA, BUT IT ALSO

94
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:13,578
COULD SIGNAL A NEW

95
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:15,079
WITH NORTH KOREA, BUT IT ALSO
COULD SIGNAL A NEW WAY, A NEW

96
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:15,880
ARCHITECTURE FOR DIPLOMATIC

97
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,514
RELATIONS MOVING FORWARD.

98
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:17,248
THE WORLD IS SCREAMING FOR SOME

99
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:17,949
TYPE OF NEW INTERPERSONAL ECHO

100
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:18,616
SYSTEM BOTH IN OUR HOMES AND

101
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,350
COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS BETWEEN

102
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,684
NATIONS.

103
00:03:19,684 --> 00:03:20,384
WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU HAVE TO

104
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:21,085
HAVE THE ABILITY TO REACH OUT

105
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:21,752
AND PROVIDE AUTHENTICITY AND

106
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:22,486
DIALOGUE AND CREATE SOME SPACE.

107
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:22,653
THE WORLD

108
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:32,330
DESTRUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY, AND THEN

109
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,630
WHAT?

110
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,364
CIVILIZATION ITSELF IS AT STAKE

111
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:33,998
AND WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY

112
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:34,699
TOWARDS MUTUALITY, WELL-BEING

113
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:35,433
AND MUTUAL SECURITY.

114
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,467
OTHERWISE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH

115
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:36,767
HOPE.

116
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:42,940
>> Tucker: COLONEL, LIBERALS

117
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,641
AND SOME CONSERVATIVES BY THE

118
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,043
WAY CRITICIZED THAT YOU MEET

119
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,447
WITH SOMEONE WHO IS MORALLY

120
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:50,214
OUT-OF-BOUNDS, LIKE KIM JONG UN.

121
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:52,183
GOING FORWARD, SHOULD WE BE

122
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:56,621
WILLING TO MEET WITH ANYBODY?

123
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:57,855
>> ABSOLUTELY.

124
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,257
DONALD TRUMP IS A DISRUPTIVE

125
00:03:59,257 --> 00:04:01,859
FORCE, LET'S BE FRANK.

126
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:02,894
IT'S DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO.

127
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:04,495
LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN ARE

128
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:07,031
UPSET BECAUSE IT THREATENS TO

129
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:10,067
CHANGE THE DISTRIBUTION OF CASH.

130
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,903
IT THREATENS THE CASH, IT

131
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,471
THREATENS ITS SUPPORT

132
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:13,871
STRUCTURES.

133
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,673
OTHER THINGS HE RECOGNIZED EARLY

134
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,942
ON WHEN HE WAS CAMPAIGNING.

135
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:21,646
SOUTH KOREA IS A POWERFUL STATE,

136
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:22,680
INFINITELY MORE POWERFUL THAN

137
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,414
NORTH KOREA AND HE RECOGNIZED

138
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:25,883
THAT JAPAN IS IN THE SAME

139
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:26,284
POSITION.

140
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:27,852
IF JAPAN RAISES ITS INVESTMENT

141
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,854
IN THE MILITARY POWER BY JUST

142
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:30,688
1%, JAPAN WILL BE NUMBER THREE

143
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:34,058
IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF DEFENSE

144
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:34,392
BUDGET.

145
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:36,060
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT WHAT

146
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,895
NORTHEAST ASIA WANTS AND NEEDS

147
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,231
IS STABILITY, ORDER AND

148
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:41,699
PROSPERITY, NOT WAR.

149
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,068
HE HAS THE AGREEMENT OF EVERYONE

150
00:04:44,068 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO COUNTS IN THE REGION.
