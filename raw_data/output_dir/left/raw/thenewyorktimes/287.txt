1
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:20,710
When you draw, there
is no stolen moment,

2
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,149
no snap of a shutter.

3
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,440
You really take the time to
see what’s in front of you.

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,120
As a reportage illustrator,
I find myself drawing

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,430
people who are on the move.

6
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,900
Around the world,
huge numbers of people

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,740
are uprooting themselves and
traveling great distances,

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,620
whether to flee from
danger or to find work.

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,170
I’m in Tajikistan to explore
one of the world’s largest migrations.

10
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,440
It’s not to sensationalize it.

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,820
It’s not to exaggerate
the reasons for doing it,

12
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,501
but it’s trying to pick
the most common experience.

13
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,430
Twice a week, a train
packed with migrants

14
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,090
leaves Dushanbe, the
capital of Tajikistan,

15
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,730
and traverses the
whole of Central Asia

16
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,380
through Ukbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,

17
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,130
and into Russia before
arriving in Moscow.

18
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,380
It takes four days.

19
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,130
It’s an extraordinary commute
just for the prospect of work.

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,617
Oyat and Abdullo are two young
men from rural Tajikistan.

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,950
I wanted to capture
their stories

22
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,600
with an intimacy we seldom see.

23
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,910
Drawing allows me to
witness the issues

24
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,840
surrounding their friendship:
of breaking tradition,

25
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,890
of leaving family behind
and of growing up.

26
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,764
But their future is uncertain.

27
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,400
At times, more than 50%
of the Tajik economy

28
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
relies on money sent home.

29
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,426
But that crucial source of
support has been drying up.

30
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:38,807
[children laughing]

31
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:34,480
[goat bleating]

32
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,640
How do you choose between two
equally unattractive options —

33
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,130
to stay at home without work or
to go to Russia without family?

34
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:11,550
Oyat stays and Abdullo
decides to leave.

35
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,170
This will be his
fourth trip to Russia.

36
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,560
He leaves behind his wife
and his six-month-old baby.

37
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,750
And the conditions on the train
were a sign of things to come.

38
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,175
[chatter]

39
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,940
The border guards
bully the migrants.

40
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,950
They go through their bags.

41
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,550
They go through our bags,
and they systematically

42
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,620
pull apart the train,
all on the off chance

43
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,760
that they might find drugs.

44
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,874
The young men are often
intimidated by police dogs

45
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:01,380
and deprived of sleep.

46
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:11,580
The train pulls into
Moscow in the early hours,

47
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,540
and they arrive exhausted.

48
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,206
Abdullo and the
other migrants spend

49
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,580
the night in the
freezing station

50
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,980
huddled together,
waiting for the metro

51
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,510
to open the next morning.

52
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,690
As they move about
Moscow, there’s

53
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,880
consistent pressure
from the authorities.

54
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,750
It’s something I noticed
trying to draw in the metro.

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,510
Often, a policeman would come
and look over your shoulder

56
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,140
to see what you were doing.

57
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,210
And each person who looked like
they were from Central Asia

58
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,880
was being stopped, and
their papers were checked.

59
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,130
And if they don’t have
the right paperwork,

60
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,910
then it’s the beginning
of trouble for them —

61
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,719
fines, visa complications,
and deportation.

62
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,490
We traveled to the
outskirts of Moscow

63
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,520
with Abdullo as he
began looking for work.

64
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
The workers here live
together in the apartments

65
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,080
they are refurbishing.

66
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,750
Once they finish one,
they move on to the next.

67
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,000
If they are lucky,
they make $500 a month.

68
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,340
In Tajikistan,
they were together

69
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,200
and enjoying themselves.

70
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,750
Here, they are together,
but trying to survive.

71
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,640
It’s the process of drawing
that allows me enough time

72
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,274
to understand the resilience
and the extraordinary bond

73
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,930
that the migrants have here.

74
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,070
These are just a group of men
trying to make their own way,

75
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,250
and their relationship to
the Russian authorities

76
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,890
is a very difficult one.

77
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,980
In Abdullo’s case,
it was about trying

78
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,955
to avoid an overwhelming feeling
of being helpless at home.

79
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:56,800
It was about him making
a positive choice

80
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,170
to stay in control of his life.

81
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:41,900
We’re beginning to
experience change

82
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,725
to borders all over the world —

83
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:46,680
in the United
States, in Europe

84
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,040
and in this case, in Russia.

85
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,590
[laughter]

86
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,061
But what will the future
hold for the next generation,

87
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,570
and how should governments
police their borders?

88
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,450
Perhaps if we showed not the
most shocking, but the most

89
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,520
common experience
of migration,

90
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,604
we would be
less intimidated by it.

91
00:10:34,600 --> 00:00:00,000
[rap music]
