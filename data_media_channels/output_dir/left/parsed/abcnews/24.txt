THIS WILL BE A LONG AND PAINFUL 
TIME FOR THESE PARENTS AS THEY 
WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH WHAT HAS 
TO BE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE 
THEY'VE EVER DEALT WITH.
WE MOURN WITH THEM.
WE MOURN AS FELLOW TEXANS.
BUT WE MUST COME TOGETHER AS ONE
COMMUNITY.
AT THIS TIME OF ENORMOUS 
SUFFERING.
AND SHOW THE VICTIMS AND 
FAMILIES THE SUPPORT THEY NEED.
WE APPRECIATE ALL THE FIRST 
RESPONDERS WHO HAVE ALREADY 
STEPPED UP TO HELP RESPOND TO 
THIS CHALLENGE.
AND WE LOOK TO GOD TO GIVE THE 
FIRST RESPONDERS AS WELL AS THE 
VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES THE 
GUIDANCE THEY NEED IN THE COMING
DAYS AND WEEKS, AS WE WORK TO 
CONTINUE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
WHAT HAPPENED AND VERY 
IMPORTANTLY WORK TO RESPOND TO 
THIS CHALLENGE.
I ASK THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO
JOIN TEXAS IN MOURNING THE LOSS 
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, THESE 
STUDENTS.
AND TO OFFER YOUR PRAYERS IN 
SUPPORT OF THESE FAMILIES.
AND I ASK EVERY PARENT OUT 
THERE, WHEREVER YOU MAY BE, TO 
HOLD YOUR CHILDREN CLOSE 
TONIGHT.
AND LET THEM KNOW HOW MUCH YOU 
LOVE THEM.
NOW, WE HAVE TWO GOALS GOING 
FORWARD.
THE IMMEDIATE GOAL IS TO WORK IN
THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THIS 
CATASTROPHE, AND GATHER EVIDENCE
AND INFORMATION THAT'S NEEDED TO
ENSURE THIS CRIME WILL BE 
PROSECUTED APPROPRIATELY.
WHILE ALSO WORKING TO ENSURE WE 
PROVIDE THE FAMILIES AND VICTIMS
AS WELL AS ALL THE CHILDREN AT 
THIS SCHOOLS AND ACROSS THE 
DISTRICT WITH THE SUPPORT, 
RESOURCES, AND COUNSELING THEY 
NEED.
SECOND, WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN 
JUST PRAY FOR THE VICTIMS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES.
IT'S TIME IN TEXAS THAT WE TAKE 
ACTION TO STEP UP AND MAKE SURE 
THIS TRAGEDY IS NEVER REPEATED 
EVER AGAIN IN THE HISTORY OF THE
STATE OF TEXAS.
SO, BEGINNING IMMEDIATELY, I'M 
GOING TO BE WORKING WITH MEMBERS
OF THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE, BUT 
ALSO MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF TEXAS
TO BEGIN WITH ROUNDTABLE 
DISCUSSIONS, BEGINNING NEXT 
WEEK, WHERE WE WILL ASSEMBLE ALL
STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK IMMEDIATELY
ON SWIFT SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT 
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS FROM EVER 
HAPPENING AGAIN.
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM PARENTS, 
STUDENTS, EDUCATORS, CONCERNED 
CITIZENS, FROM THOSE WHO HOLD A 
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT IN HIGH 
ESTEEM.
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM EVERYBODY 
WHO HAS AN INTEREST IN WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TODAY SO WE CAN WORK 
TOGETHER SO WE CAN PUT TOGETHER 
LAWS THAT ENSURE OUR SCHOOLS ARE
SAFER PLACES.
THESE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE 
BACKGROUND CHECKS, AND KEEPING 
GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE 
WHO POSE AN IMMEDIATE DANGER TO 
OTHERS.
PROVIDING MORE RESOURCES TO OUR 
SCHOOLS.
AND PROVIDING RESOURCES TO 
ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES
BEHIND GUN VIOLENCE, WITH A 
FOCUS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE.
IT ALSO MEANS PERHAPS EXPANDING 
A PROGRAM WHERE THERE ARE WAYS 
OF MEASURING MENTAL HEALTH 
CHALLENGES OF STUDENTS, AND 
BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO
MAY POST A RISK AND LOOKING TO 
DEPLOY THOSE STRATEGIES IN 
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE 
STATE OF TEXAS.
AFTER A CATASTROPHE LIKE THIS, 
THE ANSWERS ARE NOT ALWAYS 
IMMEDIATE.
BUT THEY WILL COME WITH US 
WORKING TOGETHER.
I WANT TO COVER SOME OF THE 
DETAILS OF WHERE WE STAND RIGHT 
NOW.
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WILL BE 
PROVIDING UPDATES LATER.
I MENTIONED THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN 
IDENTIFIED AS BEING DECEASED AND
WOUNDED.
AND WE WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON
THAT LATER ON.
WE ARE STILL, LAW ENFORCEMENT IS
STILL IN THE PROCESS OF 
UNDERTAKING BOTH SEARCHES AND 
INVESTIGATION OF THE ENTIRE 
SCENE, AS WELL AS OTHER 
LOCATIONS.
THEY HAVE WARRANTS OUT CON
CONCERNING THE PERSON 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOOTING, 
WARRANTS TO SEARCH TWO 
RESIDENTS.
THE REASON WHY THERE IS SOME 
SLOWNESS IN BEING ABLE TO 
UNDERTAKE THE SEARCHES IS 
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES INSIDE THE 
RESIDENTS, THEY WANT TO MAKE 
SURE THEY CAN ENTER THEM WITHOUT
ANYONE BEING HARMED.
ONE REASON FOR THE CONCERN IS 
THAT DIFFERENT KINDS OF 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HAVE BEEN 
DETECTED.
ONE WAS A CO2 DEVICE, ANOTHER 
WAS A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL.
BOTH IN A HOME AS WELL AS A 
VEHICLE.
THERE'S ALSO A SEARCH WARRANT 
OUT FOR THE VEHICLE OF THE 
SH
SHOOTER.
A
WE ALSO KNOW INFORMATION ALREADY
THAT THE SHOOTER HAS INFORMATION
CONTAINED IN JOURNALS ON HIS 
COMPUTER AND A CELL PHONE THAT 
HE SAID, NOT ONLY DID HE WANT TO
COMMIT THE SHOOTING, BUT HE 
WANTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE AFTER 
THE SHOOTING.
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, HE GAVE 
HIMSELF UP.
AT THE TIME, HE ADMITTED HE 
DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO 
COMMIT THE SUICIDE, THAT HE 
WANTED TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE 
EARLIER.
HE'S COUURRENTLY AT THE SANTA F 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY'RE 
WORKING WITH THE FBI AND TEXAS 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, 
ATF, AND THE GALVESTON POLICE 
DEPARTMENT AND SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
THIS WILL BE HANDLED 
COLLABORATIVELY, BY BOTH FEDERAL
AND STATE PROSECUTORS.
S
SO YOU'LL KNOW, THERE ARE ONE OR
TWO OTHER PEOPLE OF INTEREST 
BEING INTERVIEWED.
ONE WAS A PERSON WHO WAS AT THE 
SCENE.
WE WANT DEFINITIVELY SAY WHETHER
OR NOT THERE WAS SOME 
INVOLVEMENT, WE WANT TO MAKE 
SURE THEY'RE ADEQUATELY 
INVESTIGATED.
AND THERE'S ANOTHER PERSON THAT 
WE HAVE CERTAIN INFORMATION, WE 
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'LL BE 
FULLY INTERVIEWED TO MAKE SURE 
THERE IS MORE INFORMATION TO BE 
GLEANED.
AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD, THE 
WEAPONS USED IN THIS ATTACK, 
THERE ARE TWO WEAPONS.
ONE WAS A SHOTGUN, AND THE OTHER
IS A .38 REVOLVER.
NEITHER OF THESE WEAPONS WERE 
OWNED OR LEGALLY POSSESSED BY 
THE SHOOTER.
IT'S MY INFORMATION THAT BOTH 
WEAPONS WERE OBTAINED BY THE 
SHOOTER FROM HIS FATHER.
IT'S MY INFORMATION AT THE TIME,
THE FATHER LEGALLY OWNED THESE 
WEAPONS.
I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION WHETHER
OR NOT THE FATHER WAS AWARE THE 
SON HAD TAKEN THE WEAPONS FROM 
THE FATHER.
I DO WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE 
MULTITUDE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCIES WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
IN THIS PROCESS.
THE SANTA FE POLICE DEPARTMENT, 
GALVESTON SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AND 
THE FBI AND ATF, THE GALVESTON 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, HARRIS COUNTY
SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AND OTHERS.
TWO THINGS WE'RE WORKING ON AS 
WE SPEAK.
ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PARENTS
ARE GOING TO BE NOTIFIED AS 
SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE.
ONE THING THAT DEPENDS UPON IS 
HOW SWIFTLY THE CRIME SCENE IS 
GOING TO BE DEALT WITH.
THE CONCERN BEING FOR THE 
POTENTIAL OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES 
ON THE CRIME SCENE.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE 
WORKED ON IN A SHORT PERIOD OF 
TIME.
SECOND, VERY IMPORTANTLY, THE 
NECESSITY OF PROVIDING 
COUNSELING TO EVERYBODY 
INVOLVED.
CERTAINLY COUNSELING FOR THE 
LIVING VICTIMS AND FAMILIES, AND
ALL OF THE STUDENTS IN THE 
ENTIRE DISTRICT.
I KNOW RESOURCES ARE BEING 
PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY FOR THAT,
AND ALSO BY THE STATE.
AND WE WILL HAVE WHATEVER AMOUNT
OF COUNSELORS THAT THE SCHOOL 
DISTRICT NEEDS.
I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
VISIT WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT 
WHO HAS BEEN HELPFUL WITH THE 
RESPONSE AND THE INVESTIGATION, 
AND I THANK HER FOR THE SUPPORT.
AND WE'VE RECEIVED PHONE CALLS 
FROM THE PRESIDENT AND VICE 
PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY, AND THEY ALL 
HAVE PLEDGED SUPPORT.
AND TED CRUZ AT THIS TIME WILL 
TAKE THE MIKE. 
>> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR STRONG 
LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE, 
PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS.
ONCE AGAIN, TEXAS HAS SEEN THE 
FACE OF EVIL.
>> SENATOR TED CRUZ, SPEAKING 
THERE AFTER WE HEARD THAT 
LENGTHY STATEMENT FROM THE 
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, GREG ABBOTT.
A LOT OF INFORMATION THERE FROM 
THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS.
HE REFERRED TO THE SHOOTING IN 
SANTA FE, TEXAS, AS HEINOUS AND 
EVIL.
TEN PEOPLE KILLED, TEN PEOPLE 
WOUNDED.
RIGHT NOW, HE INDICATED POLICE 
ARE SEARCHING THE HOME OF THE 
SUSPECT.
HE SAYS THEY'RE MOVING SLOWLY, 
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED THERE 
MAY BE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ON THE 
SCENE.
SEARCHING MANY SCENES THROUGHOUT
THE AREA, CONCERNED ABOUT 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.
HE SAID THEY'VE FOUND SEVERAL 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.
AND THE SUSPECT HAD INFORMATION 
ON JOURNALS AND CELL PHONES 
SAYING HE PLANNED TO CARRY OUT 
THE ATTACK, AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO 
KILL HIMSELF.
BUT ULTIMATELY, HE TURNED 
HIMSELF IN.
RIGHT NOW, THE GOVERNOR SAYS THE
POLICE ARE INTERVIEWING TWO 
PEOPLE OF INTEREST, ONE PERSON 
WHO BEHAVED SUSPICIOUSLY AT THE 
SCENE, AND ANOTHER WHO MAY HAVE 
INFORMATION.
AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER THIS WAS A LONE GUNMAN, 
OR WHETHER HE HAD ASSISTANCE.
ONE FINAL SET OF DETAILS FROM 
THE GOVERNOR ABOUT TODAY'S MASS 
SHOOTING, IT WAS CARRIED OUT 
USING A SHOTGUN AND A .38 
REVOLVER, BOTH TAKEN FROM THE 
SUSPECT'S FATHER, WHO OWNED THEM
LEGALLY.
WITH US HERE ON THE SET, CHIEF 
BOB BOYCE.
AS YOU LISTEN TO THE GOVERNOR, 
WHAT STUCK OUT TO YOU?
>> THE FACT THAT HE ACQUIRED THE
GUNS FROM HIS FATHER, THEY WERE 
IN THE HOME.
THE SHOTGUN AND .38, NOTHING TOO
SUBSTANTIAL ABOUT THE GUNS, BUT 
HE HAD ACCESS TO THEM.
AND THE SUICIDE INTENTION ON THE
PERPETRATOR, THAT MEANS THEY GOT
INFORMATION FROM HIM, THEY SPOKE
WITH HIM.
HE'S SPOKING WITH THEM.
AND THE ACTIVE SHOOTER PROTOCOL,
HOW QUICKLY WAS THE OFFICER 
THERE?
>> THE SCHOOL OFFICER?
>> YES.
AND WAS THERE ANY AMMUNITION ON 
HIM, THAT HE COULD HAVE SHOT ANY
OTHER PEOPLE?
>> AND COULD LIVES HAVE BEEN 
SAVED IF THE RESPONSE WAS 
SPEEDIER. 
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW. 
>> WHAT DOES THE PROLIFERATION 
OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES SAY TO YOU?
>> WELL, THE MOLOTOV COCKTAIL, 
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED BUT VERY 
EFFECTIVE.
AND THE CO2, IT WAS PLANNED.
SO, WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THEY 
KNEW AT THE TIME.
>> AND I WANT TO BRING IN FORMER
DALLAS POLICE CHIEF, DAVID 
BROWN, WHO HIS NOT ONLY FROM 
TEXAS, BUT DEALT WITH A SHOOTING
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
LISTENING TO YOUR GOVERNOR 
SPEAKING ABOUT THE SHOOTING, 
WHAT DETAILS STUCK OUT TO YOU?
>> THE TYPE OF WEAPONS STUCK OUT
TO ME.
SHOTGUN, AND HANDGUN, REVOLVER 
HANDGUN, REALLY SPOKE ABOUT THE 
KIND OF, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU 
NORMALLY SEE.
NO AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
AND WITH TEN VICTIMS, THERE HAD 
TO BE A SLOWER RESPONSE.
AND THERE HAD TO BE SOME 
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALLOWED HIM 
TO NOT ONLY FATALLY KILL TEN, 
BUT ALSO WOUND TEN ADDITIONAL 
PEOPLE.
THERE LIKELY HAD TO BE SOME 
RELOADING, AND TEACHERS, STAFF, 
AND THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER 
WHO WAS WOUNDED, THAT TIMELINE 
WILL BE IMPORTANT AS WE LISTEN 
TO THE INVESTIGATIVE OUTCOMES OF
WHAT HAPPENED AND THE SEQUENCE 
OF WHAT HAPPENED.
HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO USE A 
SHOTGUN, WHICH IS NOT AN 
AUTOMATIC WEAPON, AND CAUSE SO 
MUCH GRIEF FOR ALL OF US TO 
LISTEN TO THIS, AND AT THE SAME 
TIME, THE SECOND PERSON OF 
INTEREST, OR MAYBE EVEN ANOTHER 
PERSON THAT THEY'RE 
INTERVIEWING, ALL OF THAT WILL 
REVEAL MORE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT, 
AGAIN, THAT WE MAY FIND 
SHOCKING.
>> MOST SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN THIS
COUNTRY ARE CARRIED OUT BY LONE 
GUNMEN.
SO IT WILL BE UNUSUAL IF THIS 
SUSPECT HAD ASSISTANCE.
BUT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF FOCUS
ON THE POLICE RESPONSE TO THE 
SHOOTING.
THANK YOU BOTH.
AND MARCUS MOORE, ON THE GROUND 
AT SANTA FE, GIVE US A SENSE OF 
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND HEARING 
RIGHT THERE. 
>> Reporter: WELL, DAN, IT'S A 
DIFFICULT SCENE HERE JUST 
OUTSIDE THE PLACE THAT MANY HERE
IN SANTA FE CALL THE GYM.
IT'S A FORMER SCHOOL CONVERTED 
TO A GYM.
THIS IS WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE
BEING REUNITED WITH STUDENTS.
WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE 
PLACE, A NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND 
FAMILIES ARE WALKING BACK AND 
FORTH, AND PEOPLE LOOKING FOR 
THEIR RELATIVES WHO THEY SAY 
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRACK
DOWN.
I TALKED TO ONE FAMILY WHO SAID 
THEY HAD A LOVED ONE WHO WORKED 
AT THE SCHOOL, AND HAVEN'T BEEN 
ABLE TO REACH THEM.
A VERY SOMBER MOOD HERE, WHERE 
SO MANY ARE COMING TO GET 
INFORMATION.
AND A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE 
MEDIA HAVE BEEN SHOWING UP HERE.
AND THE PARKING LOT AT THE LOCAL
GROCERY STORE IS WHERE THEY'RE 
PARKING, AND WALKING ACROSS TO 
HOPEFULLY FIND INFORMATION ABOUT
THEIR LOVED ONES.
SANTA FE IS A CITY OF ABOUT 
13,000 PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF 
HOUSTON.
AND THE SCHOOL ONLY HAS AN 
ENROLLMENT OF 1,400 STUDENTS.
BY TEXAS STANDARDS, IT'S A 
RELATIVITY SMALL HIGH SCHOOL.
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS
HERE, IT HITS THE COMMUNITY 
EXTREMELY HARD.
WE'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO A NUMBER
OF STUDENTS WHO, ONE GENTLEMAN 
TOLD ME HE WASN'T EVEN AT SCHOOL
TODAY, AND AT 7:30 A.M., HE GOT 
A MESSAGE FROM A FRIEND 
DESCRIBING WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
SOMEONE PULLED THE FIRE ALARM, 
AND THEY STARTED TO EVACUATE THE
SCHOOL.
AND TALKING ABOUT THE COMING 
STEPS GOING INTO NEXT WEEK, ONE 
STUDENT SAID NO KID SHOULD EVER 
BE AFRAID TO COME TO SCHOOL.
AND WE ENDED THE INTERVIEW THAT 
WAY.
DAN?
>> MARCUS MOORE, FROM SANTA FE, 
TEXAS.
AND THE PLACES WHERE THE 
FAMILIES REUNITE AFTER A 
SHOOTING, CAN BE SO FRAUGHT, 
TENDER, INCREDIBLY SAD.
WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS PLAY OUT 
BEFORE IN THIS COUNTRY.
THERE'S SORT OF A GRIM 
CHOREOGRAPHY, WE SEE AFTER ONE 
OF THESE EVENTS.
THE BREAKING NEWS, THE SORT OF 
IMAGES YOU'RE SEEING, WITH A 
MASSIVE POLICE RESPONSE.
AND THE DEBATE ABOUT WHAT TO DO.
AND WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT 
DEBATE BEING JOINED BY THE 
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, GREG ABBOTT.
HE SAID WE NEED TO DO MORE IN 
THE STATE OF TEXAS THAN JUST 
PRAY.
WE NEED TO STEP UP AND MAKE SURE
THE TRAGEDY IS NEVER REPEATED.
HE'S CALLING FOR A SERIES OF 
ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS, WITH 
TEACHERS, PARENTS, AND 
EDUCATORS.
AND HE SAID HE WANTS TO MOVE 
TOWARDS SWIFT SOLUTIONS.
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLICY 
IMPLICATIONS WITH CECILIA VEGA, 
STANDING BY AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
RIGHT NOW.
AFTER THE SHOOTING IN PARKLAND, 
FLORIDA, AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS
THE FIFTH FATAL SCHOOL SHOOTING 
IN AMERICA SINCE PARKLAND.
AFTER THAT SHOOTING, WE SAW THIS
BIG PUSH LED BY THE STUDENTS AND
CULMINATING IN THE MARCH FOR OUR
LIVES IN WASHINGTON, WITH BIG 
CALLS FOR CHANGE.
AND WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM THE
PRESIDENT TODAY.
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE WE MAY BE ON
THE CUSP OF ANOTHER DEBATE LIKE 
THIS, AND PERHAPS HEADED TOWARDS
SOME SORT OF ACTION?
>> Reporter: YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS IS A SADLY FAMILIAR DRILL 
IN OUR COUNTRY, FOR THIS WHITE 
HOUSE.
AND WITH THAT COMES THE FAMILIAR
RESPONSE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SUPPOSED TO 
BE TALKING ABOUT PRISON REFORM 
AT AN EVENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, 
AND HAD TO BEGIN THE REMARKS FOR
THE FIFTH TIME, ADDRESSING THE 
NATION IN THE WAKE OF A MASS 
SHOOTING, TALKING ABOUT THIS 
MASS SHOOTING IN TEXAS.
HE SAID THIS HAD BEEN GOING ON 
FOR TOO LONG IN OUR COUNTRY.
YOU MENTIONED THOSE PARKLAND 
STUDENTS.
THEY WERE HERE AT THIS WHITE 
HOUSE, ONE OF THE MOST VISCERAL 
IMAGES THAT WE'VE SEEN OUT OF 
THIS ADMINISTRATION.
THE PRESIDENT GRIEVING WITH 
THOSE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS
IN THE WAKE OF THAT SHOOTING.
AND PROMISING BIG CHANGES WITH 
GUN CONTROL, BACKGROUND CHECKS, 
RAISING THE AGE LIMITS FOR 
PURCHASING A FIREARM.
THEN MANY WOULD SAY HE BUCKLED 
TO PRESSURE FROM THE NRA, AND 
BACKED DOWN FROM MANY OF THOSE 
PROMISES.
WE'RE HEARING TODAY FROM CHORUS 
OF STUDENTS, WITH CALLS FROM 
ACTION, SAYING WE DON'T NEED 
YOUR PRAYERS, WE NEED SECTION.
AND EMMA GONZALEZ OF PARKLAND 
SAID, SANTA FE HIGH, YOU DON'T 
DESERVE THIS.
YOU DESERVE MORE THAN THOUGHTS 
AND PRAYERS.
AND WE'LL SUPPORT YOU BY RAISING
UP YOUR VOICES.
THIS HAS BEEN THE RESOUNDING 
CALL FOR ACTION.
BUT HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT
AGAIN, AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN VERY 
MUCH ACTION. 
>> CECILIA VEGA, THANK YOU.
LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THIS.
THE INCIDENTS ARE TOO COMMON IN 
OUR COUNTRY, THEY'RE SAID, AND 
DIVISIVE.
SO, LET'S CLOSE WITH SOMETHING A
LITTLE BIT MORE HOPEFUL.
LET'S SHOW YOU THE IMAGES OUT OF
SANTA FE, TEXAS, IN THE WAKE OF 
THE SHOOTING THAT KILLED TEN 
PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM VERY YOUNG,
CITIZENS ARE LINING UP OUTSIDE 
OF HOSPITALS TO DONATE BLOOD.
WE'LL BE COVERING THIS STORY 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON ABC NEWS, 
A
A
ABCNEWS.COM, AND MUCH MORE 
COMING UP ON "WORLD NEWS 
TONIGHT" WITH DAVID MUIR.
FOR NOW, I'M DAN HARRIS IN NEW 
YORK.
