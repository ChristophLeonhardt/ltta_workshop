ALL RIGHT, WE'RE TEN DAYS AWAY FROM THE BIG SUMMIT. A LOT OF PEOPLE WORING A LOT OF ANGLES TO MAKE SURE IT GOES WELL WITHOUT A HITCH. WE WERE TELLING YOU ABOUT HOTEL COSTS AND ALL OF THAT STUFF. RIGHT NOW THE DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, ADAM, THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MEETING, I UNDERSTAND, BUT WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME, GETTING READY FOR IT, WAS WHO WASN'T IN THE OVAL OFFICE YESTERDAY WITH THE PRESIDENT AND NUMBER TWO NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS AND THAT WOULD BE JOHN BOLTON AND OF COURSE, THE VICE-PRESIDENT. WHY WOULD THAT BE THE CASE? WELL, A VERY ASTUTE OBSERVATION, MR. CAVUTO. AND I THINK THE CASE THE REASON THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE THOSE TWO, THOSE TWO GUYS, PENCE AND BOLTON ARE THE SKUNKS IN THE ROOM AS FAR AS THE NORTH KOREANS ARE CONCERNED. THEY'VE COMPARED THESE NEGOTIATIONS OR THE DEAL THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT TO THE LIBYA DEAL WHICH WAS BASICALLY IN 2003, GADHAFI IS GIVING UP HIS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, BUT REMEMBER, TEN YEARS LATER WE BOMBED GADHAFI TO DEATH. SO THAT'S WHAT THE KOREANS REMEMBER. SO, I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM SAID, LOOK, WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DERAIL THIS. WE DON'T WANT TO CAUSE OFFENSE SO LET'S JUST KEEP JOHN AND THE VICE-PRESIDENT OUT OF THE ROOM, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN BY NO MEANS DOES IT MEAN THAT THEY'RE OUT OF THE POLICY DELIBERATIONS AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY FIRMLY, I THINK, BEHIND THE PROCESS THAT'S DRIVING THESE NEGOTIATIONS. NEIL: WE SHOULD EXPLAIN, OF COURSE, WHEN WE WERE BOMBING GADHAFI, HE WENT INTO HIDING AND THEN, YOU KNOW, FOUND IN A SEWER, A SEWER PIPE AND HIS PEOPLE DRAGGED HIM OUT AND KILLED HIM. HIS PEOPLE KILLED HIM AND NOT US. NEIL: AND KIM JONG-UN SAID, I DON'T WANT THAT. WHAT HAVE WE ASSURED HIM, DO YOU THINK? WELL, I THINK THAT TRUMP HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT REGIME CHANGE. I THINK THE CHINESE BEHIND THE SCENES HAVE TOLD KIM THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT HE STAYS IN POWER, AND THAT HE'S NOT RISKING HIS REGIME BY ENTERING INTO THESE NEGOTIATIONS. BUT LOOK, LET'S REMEMBER, I MEAN, THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH KOREA ARE ABOUT AS FAR APART AS ANY TWO NEGOTIATING PARTIES CAN BE. THE UNITED STATES WANTS COMPREHENSIVE VERIFIABLE, IRREVERSIBLE DISARMAMENT QUICKLY BEFORE WE GIVE THEM ANY INCENTIVES OR REWARDS. AND NORTH KOREA WANTS INCENTIVES AND REWARDS AS A PRELUDE TO TALKING ABOUT THE DENUCLEARIZATION. SO, ALL THE THEATER ASIDE, YOU KNOW, THE LETTER, AND THE DINNERS IN NEW YORK, AND ALL OF THAT SORT OF STUFF, THAT'S THE THEATER. BUT BEHIND THE THEATER THERE ARE SOME HUGE CHASMS, AND DO WE HAVE THE FOCUS TO SEE IT THROUGH. NEIL: QUICK NEIL: QUIC NEIL: DOIC NEIL: DO C NEIL: DO WE NEIL: DO WE? ONE OTHER THING, YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT AIR BNB. NEIL: HOW IDIOTICIC OF ME. ENTREPRENEURIAL, CHEAP, YOU'VE GOT A HUGE SELECTION, YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR LOCATION AND YOU NEIL: DON'T YOU THINK THOUGH, IF YOU'RE CALLING ANY OF THESE HOTELS AND YOU'RE THE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION AND EXPLAINING, HI, WE'RE WITH THE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION GOING TO THE PEACE SUMMIT THEY'RE JACKING IT UP AND WOULD DO THE SAME IN AIR BNB. I WOULD DO IT DIFFERENTLY, IF I'M A HOTEL AND WANT THE NORTH KOREANS COMING, THEY'RE UNREE KOREANS COMING, THEY'RE UNRE UNPREDICTABLE, ARE THEY GOING TO
