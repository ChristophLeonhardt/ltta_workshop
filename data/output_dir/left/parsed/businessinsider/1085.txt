we're gonna have a real wall and who's
gonna pay for the wall who I mean I
suppose it's possible that the president
administration would try to increase
tariffs on Mexican goods coming into the
United States and then used some of
those tariffs to pay for the
construction of the wall but that's
risky because it could lead to tariffs
on the other side by Mexico for goods
coming in from the United States and you
know Mexico and Canada are our two
biggest trading partners in the world
accounting for about thirty percent of
our trade which creates an enormous
number of jobs right here in the United
States
