all right if I was cool enough to go golfing with Bill Murray which is apparently what takes up much of his time these days I would give him a very robust high-five because aside from his spectacular golf attire he has made waves in Hollywood this week commenting on the success of the GOP tax cuts and discussing the detrimental effect that identity politics has on comedy both of which I responding ly agree with do you ever watch TV and you think to yourself oh my gosh that would never fly on current television half of the stuff they say on Sanford and Son I'm sitting here thinking damn that makes me even feel uncomfortable and I have a pretty irreverent sense of humor so even shows as recent as friends I know friends isn't necessarily recent in comparison to something like scandal but in comparison to Cheers it definitely is so the thing is is you know what like shows nowadays they're not as funny comedy was funnier back then people weren't so sensitive people weren't looking for reasons to be offended Murray gave an interview and in discussing this point he said how can Kristen Wiig make everyone laugh she's not thinking about being political she's thinking about what resonates and was common to all of us and I think that's harder and harder to do because people are trying to win their point of view as opposed to saying what if I spoke to everyone identifying one of the reasons that people dislike Democrats he said that they have the attitude of we represent the Hispanics we represent the LGBT or something and they're not speaking to everyone all at once it's almost a meaning to say I'm choosing you because you're a splinter group or a certain minority group there's almost a resentment that somehow you're separated again by a politician then stepping outside the context of Hollywood he praised the GOP tax cuts calling it a great thing for corporations he also acknowledged this era of divisive politics that has led to a clash of clans first thing in the morning he then went on to use one of my favorite phrases likening the Trump administration's tax overhaul to that of a high tide raising all boats so he goes on to confess that economically he doesn't really know the process of how that takes care of the budget or entitlements but he said I think in the first step it's making things easier isn't it so utterly refreshing when a Hollywood person steps out of that bubble and speaks reasonably I love it thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us over here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.osr.wa.gov.au/payrollenquiry
