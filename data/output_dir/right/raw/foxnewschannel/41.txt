OPTIMISTIC.

00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:02,315
SHANNON.

3
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:03,716
>> Shannon: WILLIAM, THAT’S

4
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:04,216
VERY INTERESTING.

00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:04,784
THANK YOU.

6
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,785
CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL

7
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:07,587
IMMIGRATION IS BEEN A MAJOR

8
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:09,388
FOCAL POINT OF THE TRUMP

9
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:09,989
ADMINISTRATION’S AGENDA.

10
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,524
THIS YEAR, U.S. BORDER PATROL

11
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:15,261
APPREHENSIONS ARE SHARPLY.

12
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:18,631
LET’S TALK ABOUT IT WITH THE

13
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:19,332
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF TEXAS,

14
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,034
DAN PATRICK.

15
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:21,634
I UNDERSTAND HE STARTED

16
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:22,402
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT

17
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:23,403
IN TEXAS YESTERDAY AND TONIGHT

18
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:24,704
YOU’VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH

19
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:24,971
HIM.

20
00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:26,706
WHAT CAN YOU SHARE WITH US

21
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:28,875
PUBLICLY?

22
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:31,010
>> WELL, HE WAS HERE FOR THE

23
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,913
GREAT RALLY WE HAD LAST NIGHT,

24
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:34,681
FABULOUS.

25
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:37,250
BEFORE THAT HE MET WITH SEVERAL

26
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:37,984
TEXAS LEADERS, MYSELF INCLUDED,

27
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:42,389
TO TALK ABOUT THE CARAVAN AND

28
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,390
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

29
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,659
WE TALKED TWO HOURS AGO, WE HAD

30
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,494
A GOOD CONVERSATION AND IT’S

31
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,630
CLEAR THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE

32
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:51,398
COMING HERE DON’T UNDERSTAND

33
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,599
THIS PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS.

34
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,400
THEY’RE NOT GETTING INTO THIS

35
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,203
COUNTRY AND FOR THOSE WHO DO

36
00:00:56,204 --> 00:00:56,903
CROSS ILLEGALLY, THEY’RE GOING

37
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:58,071
TO BE TURNED AROUND AND SENT

38
00:00:58,072 --> 00:00:58,372
BACK.

39
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:02,576
HE IS BRINGING THE MIGHT OF THE

40
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:02,976
MILITARY.

41
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:06,413
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MY BELIEF

42
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:09,183
LARGER AND EXPANDED DETENTION

43
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:10,818
CENTERS, EXPEDITED COURTS,

44
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:11,618
OFFICERS AND MAGISTRATES,

45
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:13,487
EVERYONE COMING TO THE BORDER.

46
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:14,521
FOR ANYONE WHO GETS ACROSS,

47
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:15,923
THEY’RE GOING TO BE TURNED

48
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:16,590
AROUND.

49
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:17,624
THEY’RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE

50
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,692
PROCESS OF THE PUT ON AN

51
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:19,627
AIRPLANE AND SENT BACK.

52
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:23,030
THESE PEOPLE, FIRST OF ALL,

53
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:24,398
SHANNON, THESE WOULDN’T BE

54
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:25,399
HAPPENING IF IT WEREN’T FOR

55
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,568
CHARLES SCHUMER WALKING FUNDING

56
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:28,569
FOR THE WALL.

57
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,172
THE WALL WILL STOP PEOPLE FROM

58
00:01:31,173 --> 00:01:32,173
COMING.

59
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:33,374
MEXICO HAS TO COOPERATE.

60
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,975
THEY HAVE TO STOP ALL TRAINS

61
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,576
COMING TO THE COUNTRY.

62
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:36,811
SECONDLY I SHARED WITH THE

63
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:38,012
PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT, SHUT DOWN

64
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:38,646
THE BORDER CROSSINGS.

65
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:42,950
WE HAVE 19 WITH MEXICO JUST OUT

66
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:43,317
OF TEXAS.

67
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:44,752
MOST PEOPLE COME ACROSS THE

68
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:46,420
BORDER CROSSINGS.

69
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,423
UNDER THE TRUMP CASE HE WON THIS

70
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:50,691
YEAR IN THE SUPREME COURT UNDER

71
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:51,492
CERTAIN CONDITIONS, HE HAS THE

72
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:55,329
RIGHT TO DENY ANY ALIEN COMING

73
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:55,830
INTO THIS COUNTRY.

74
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,799
HE CAN SHUTDOWN THE BORDERS

75
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,601
TOTALLY OR HE CAN SHUT DOWN FROM

76
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:01,602
ANYONE CROSSING.

77
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:02,904
THE BORDER, WE CAN PROCESS THEM.

78
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,406
THEN IF SOME ARE FUNNELED ACROSS

79
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:05,407
THE BORDER, WE CAN PROCESS THEM.

80
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,208
IT MAY TAKE 100 A DAY.

81
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,977
MAY TAKE MONTHS TO PROCESS THEM.

82
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:09,644
THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

83
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,980
WAITING TO BE PROCESSED.

84
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,214
WHEN THEY COME ACROSS, THEY WILL

85
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,583
MEET OR JUDGE, BE PROSECUTED,

86
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,118
TURNED AROUND, SENT BACK.

87
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,887
THIS WILL NOT STAND UNDER THIS

88
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,387
PRESIDENT.

89
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:20,055
>> Shannon: WE KNOW BORDER

90
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,890
PATROL PUT OUT NEW NUMBERS TODAY

91
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,893
AND THE APPREHENSIONS WERE UP

92
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,797
100,000 BETWEEN FISCAL YEAR 2017

93
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:37,072
AND 2018.

94
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:37,739
WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE IS THERE

95
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,373
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK,

96
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:38,807
FALLING APART.

97
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:39,541
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO CRITICALLY

98
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,242
SAY HOW CAN YOU LOOK AT THESE

99
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:40,976
PEOPLE WHO SEEM SO DESPERATE AND

100
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:41,710
SIMPLY SAY YOU CAN’T COME HERE.

101
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:42,444
>> THERE’S TWO SEPARATE ISSUES.

102
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,445
WE HAVE DESPERATE PEOPLE IN OUR

103
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:44,413
OWN COUNTRY WE NEED TO BE SURE

104
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,314
WE TAKE CARE OF.

105
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:46,148
WHEN I WAS WITHIN THE LAST TIME

106
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,984
WITH THEM I SAID WE CANNOT

107
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:50,252
EDUCATE, MEDICAID, OR

108
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:50,953
INCARCERATE THE WHOLE WORLD.

109
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:51,820
THERE ARE MILLIONS WHO WOULD

110
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,187
COME IN.

111
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:54,690
WE WOULD NOT HAVE A COUNTRY TO

112
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,025
HELP ANYONE.

113
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,192
I FEEL FOR THOSE PEOPLE.

114
00:02:57,193 --> 00:02:58,961
THE PRESIDENT FEELS FOR THOSE

115
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:00,162
PEOPLE BUT YOU CAN’T HAVE THESE

116
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,064
MOBS CROSSING THE BORDER.

117
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:03,832
EITHER DEMOCRAT OPERATIVES IN

118
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,601
THIS COUNTRY ARE WORKING WITH

119
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,304
HIS CARAVAN OR THE DRUG CARTELS

120
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:08,838
OR BOTH.

121
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,673
NO ONE CROSSES THE BORDER,

122
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,141
SHANNON, UNLESS YOU PAY A BOUNTY

123
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:13,242
TO THE CARTELS.

124
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:14,443
THEY WOULDN’T LET THOUSANDS OF

125
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:14,877
PEOPLE CROSS.

126
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,812
HE WOULD BE BAD FOR BUSINESS.

127
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:18,080
THE CARTELS, SOMEONE IS PAYING

128
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,015
THEM TO ALLOW THESE PEOPLE TO

129
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:19,849
COME HERE.

130
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,917
SOMEONE IS FEEDING THEM, SOMEONE

131
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:22,852
IS PROVIDING BATHROOM FACILITIES
SOMEONE IS FEEDING THEM, SOMEONE

132
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:22,853
IS PROVIDING BATHROOM FACILITIES

133
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:23,452
FOR THEM.

134
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,453
SOMEONE IS GUIDING THEM.

135
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,722
I FEEL SORRY FOR THESE PEOPLE,

136
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:27,657
AS DOES THE PRESIDENT.

137
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,058
THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING LIED TO.

138
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,760
THEY ARE BEING MISLED NEED TO

139
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,261
GET THE MESSAGE.

140
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:33,896
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING FOX IN

141
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:34,831
MEXICO TONIGHT, TRANSLATED

142
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:36,232
SPANISH TO THESE PEOPLE.

143
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,533
GO BACK HOME.

144
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,335
THIS COUNTRY.

145
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:39,769
THIS IS NOT THE WAY THEY COME TO

146
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,070
YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED

147
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:41,404
TO STAY.

148
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:43,439
YOU’RE NOT GOING TO GET IN.

149
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,173
THIS PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS.

150
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:45,808
HE HAS DRAWN A LINE IN THE SAND.

151
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,709
WE HAVE DONE IT IN TEXAS.

152
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,877
WE ARE DOING EVERY THING WE CAN

153
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,012
TO HELP HIM.

154
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:51,014
HE’S BEEN RIGHT ON THIS ISSUE

155
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:51,815
SINCE HE BEGAN CAMPAIGNING.

156
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,817
I JUST SAW POLLS RECENTLY,

DEMOCRATS.

162
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:04,227
WE CANNOT LET OUR BORDERS BE

163

IT MUST STOP.
