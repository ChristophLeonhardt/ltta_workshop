23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,500
painful and it will be for a long time

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">but I want you to remember this our</font>

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,380
campaign was never about one person or

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,560
even one election it was about the

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,110
country we love and about building an

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,560
America that's hopeful inclusive and

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,520
big-hearted we have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our nation</font>

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,399
is more deeply divided than we thought

31
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,149
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still believe in America and I</font>

32
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:59,229
always will and if you do then we must

33
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,990
accept this result and then look to the

34
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,110
future Donald Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be our</font>

35
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,590
president we owe him<font color="#CCCCCC"> an open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind and</font>

36
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,980
the chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave our constitutional</font>

37
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,100
democracy enshrines the peaceful

38
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,160
transfer of power and we don't just

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,670
respect that we cherish it it also

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,989
enshrines other things the rule of law

41
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">the principle that we are all equal in</font>

42
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,329
rights and dignity freedom of worship

43
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:35,100
and expression we respect and cherish

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:00:00,000
these values too and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> must defend them</font>
