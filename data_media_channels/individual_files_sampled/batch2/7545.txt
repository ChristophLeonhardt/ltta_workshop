former Trump staffers Jason Miller and AJ Delgado have now parented what's being referred to as a love child all right so amazing Family Values individuals there who apparently had this affair during Trump's campaign Miller used to serve as Trump's communications director while Delgado frequently appeared on new shows to talk up the mogul before the before he became president now the reason why this is making headlines right now is a jail AJ Delgado is basically going on this Twitter rant in response to a page 6 article where Jason Miller says that he and his wife are excited and welcomed this new baby into their lives and into their family and Delgado didn't take too kindly to that because apparently after she told Miller that she was pregnant he cut off communication they only communicate through lawyers so let me give you a little taste of what Delgado has to say on Twitter dear friends beyond thrilled to share with you that I'm now a proud mother of a beautiful son William born July 10th that was the announcement that she made for her new baby now Jason Miller told page 6 well that's what Delgado says we don't know that Jason Miller was a source for page 6 although they quote him that's a pretty good guess right ok so he says my wife and I along with our two daughters are excited to welcome William into the world and into our family and we appreciate the well wishes we've received from so many now Delgado was not happy about that she says oh wow just reading the page six articles so much wrong in it I don't know where to begin love how page six article implies it was a Vegas love child hmm no the father and I were dating for two months he was separated from his wife he said and had been since June and I'm not sure what Jason means that he and his wife are excited to welcome will really news to me let me shut up before I say more she did say more she says wasn't my choice to discuss this but since Jason went to page six something she's assuming I now have to share a story to McKay Coppins stay tuned okay so let me just back up give you a complete context on this and and why I think it has some relevance so number one Delgado through Miller under a bus earlier and I think a lot of people would say rightfully so I think there are no good guys in store in this story with a great exception of Jason Miller's wife who was an American hero for forgiving him I guess and of her choice and whatever she wanted to do everybody would understand and then well be welcoming the young child into a family that's unbelievably gracious and magnanimous over but now let's talk about the bad guys so people didn't know about their affair all of a sudden there's leaks about how Delgado and Miller were at a strip club in Vegas before the last presidential debate hence the reference to the Vegas love child Delgado says it was conceived somewhere else who cares okay no one cares where it was conceived but they obviously had an affair that's the relevant part here and Delgado starts leaking about their affair back then so Jason Miller wants to be White House communications advisor and Delgado starts saying he should resign immediately people like whoa why is a Trump surrogate saying that this Trump top aide and he was the communications lead for the campaign should resign and then he does resign so now so they obviously had an affair he's married party of Family Values they got 81% of the evangelical vote so evangelicals just admit it you love tawdry sex you love illicit Affairs you love divorces you love all the things that are not in the Bible because Trump got divorced twice has been married three times cheated on all of his wives almost all his advisers are now you know Miller and apparently in this super hare Delgado and their affair story in the National Enquirer probably planted by Trump tamanna Ford had an affair affair affair affair evangelicals just confess you never cared about sex outside America you never cared about it all you cared about was your politics for other reasons it was always a political proper you and I think that's the core of this story so now finally so Delgado says that stuff Miller gets fired basically it does and steps away from the Trump administration I don't know why Delgado thinks she's son such a moral high-ground right can i comment on that quickly yeah look I know that let's say two people are engaged in an extramarital affair with one individual being married the other not being married I know that you know the blame is placed on the person who is married they shouldn't be cheating on their significant other however her qualifier of they were separated and you're part of this conservative movement where you go around judging the lives of other individuals and then you're saying you know what I did was okay I mean he was legally married but they were separated and we dated for two months here no he's married he's married okay so that qualifier doesn't justify your actions and by the way look this is for people who don't go around judging the lives of other people like we're humans and I get it and so if this didn't involve Family Values conservatives I wouldn't be as harsh but like her qualifier just really grates on my nerves because it's not no that's not good enough that doesn't make you the good guy now I hear you I mean it was super shady of him to cut communication with you after you told him that you got pregnant but also while you continue on with this public ridiculous behavior you got to keep in mind you have a son now right you've brought a child into this world and now you know this crap is gonna live on the internet for the rest of humanity and that kid's gonna read it one day like just stop and Jason Miller is is that okay look I got screw Jason Miller and he's done everything wrong and I and I can't stand him anyway and so I'm not defending him even 1% right but I'm also but I'll be even harsher than you on AG oh oh god oh so hey Family Values person going on TV talking about Family Values now Trump is great we were wait why are you the victim because you both had consensual sex outside of marriage wait a minute forget that he's married I thought you weren't supposed to have any men and sex outside of marriage were you married to him but AJ you weren't married to him were you so you telling everybody else hey get marry don't do sex outside of marriage okay all you evangelists go vote for us because we're the moral people you go have sex with them apparently over and over and over again while he's married then you play the victim like oh my god I was I was misled I thought that I was just having a technical affair with him but not one that you know mattered at all I thought I was just having sex outside of marriage which I tell everybody else not to do and now Color Me offended that I turns out that this serial liar who I know lies with the Trump campaign professionally also lied to me Jason Miller was a huge supporter of Ted Cruz in fact he had tweeted about how sleazy Donald Trump is how terrible he is especially after Trump attacked Ted Cruz's wife and then when Ted Cruz's chances of getting nominated by the Republican Party basically faded and and Trump asked him to come work with him he's like yeah yeah sure of course of course I'll do he started deleting his tweets anyway just shady sleazy behavior on all sides and what I would hope is that they would at least keep their kids in mind including Miller's two daughters right Delgado just stop okay you have a son now there are two little girls that that have to deal with this stuff in the future it's just sick and they need to stop and finally look I don't care about anybody's personal lives they want to have extramarital sex I'm in favor I don't care I don't it's not my business I don't think you should have cheated on his wife but it's get not my business okay but these are the guys who claim it is our business so the next time you see a Republican or conservative or eventually or whoever it might be moralizing to you and telling you what you should and shouldn't do in your life in your in your bedroom in your bedroom yeah whether it's sex outside of marriage whether it's taking away contraception whether it's what you do with your body or whether it's a lifestyle they don't agree with how dare you have gay sex you should only kind of have have the kind of adulterous sex we have that is just as against the Bible as anything else keep age delgado and jason miller and in mine and there's trips to Vegas strip clubs and their affair in mind the next time you hear some conservative moralizing to you because they don't mean a word of it and behind the scenes they're doing that and way worse if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
