6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,710
review for this I like it a lot so I'm

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,360
gonna give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it an eight out of 10 for</font>

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
adults mainly I guess because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font>

9

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,260
back but i like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it i think is a great</font>

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,230
movie I think it's pretty cheesy so nice

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,480
you're ready for i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i may be</font>

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,369
because it's such an older movie like

15
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,668
I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the whole I don't know</font>

16
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,130
what the word is technology of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,980
as like advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I just found a</font>

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,710
corny acting all that kind of stuff like

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,020
very unrealistic I don't know I just

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,090
couldn't really get into it was your

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,320
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like a 66 a degenerate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paper</font>

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ok so for kids um we kind of</font>

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,600
think this movie is geared more towards

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,180
preteens than little kids yeah your

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,800
little kids will like it our kids liked

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,510
watching it don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me wrong there's</font>

27
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,370
two parts in it that there were a little

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,409
bit freaked out about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was when</font>

29
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,700
they're shrunk little there's like this

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,430
giant ant that comes in and then there's

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,530
another scene where the ant gets killed

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,820
spoiler<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the scorpion so that are</font>

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,590

36
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,820
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling it's a little bit scary though</font>

be too much for them yeah but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

41
