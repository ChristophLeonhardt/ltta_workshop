>> WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR 

5
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:14,581
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST

00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,748

7
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:17,250
A PACKED DAY IN THE CAPITAL, 

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,118
JUST TWO HOURS AFTER A NORTH 

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,789
KOREAN LAUNCH OF 

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,356
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 

11
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,425
MISSILE, THE THIRD EVER LAUNCHED

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,626
FROM NORTH KOREA.

13
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,560
600 MILES TOWARDS JAPAN.

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,564
THE PRESIDENT EXPECTED TO 

15
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:41,141
ADDRESS THAT JUST MOMENTS AGO.

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,442
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,479
AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD, AND 

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,047
SOME OF YOU HAVE REPORTED, A 

19
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,350
MISSILE WAS LAUNCHED A LITTLE 

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,384
WHILE AGO FROM NORTH KOREA.

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,518
I WILL ONLY TELL YOU THAT WE 

22
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:56,856
WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

23
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,991
WE HAVE GENERAL WITH US AND 

24
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,760
WE'VE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ON 

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:00,926
IT.

26
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:03,496
IT IS A SITUATION THAT WE WILL 

27
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:03,930
HANDLE.

28
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,498
WITH THAT BEING SAID, CHUCK 

29
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:09,869
SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI DID NOT

30
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,738
SHOW UP FOR OUR MEETING TODAY.

31
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,139
I'M NOT REALLY THAT SURPRISED.

32
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,008
WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES.

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,176
THEY ARE WEAK ON CRIME.

34
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,611
THEY ARE WEAK ON ILLEGAL 

35
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:18,911
IMMIGRATION.

36
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:22,348
THEY WANT THE ILLEGAL FOLKS THAT

37
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,950
COME POURING INTO OUR BORDER AND

38
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,818
A LOT OF PROBLEMS BEING CAUSED, 

39
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,086
ALTHOUGH WE'VE STOPPED IT TO A 

40
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,221
LARGE EXTENT, AS MUCH AS YOU CAN

41
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,758
WITHOUT THE WALL, WHICH WE'RE 

42
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,225
GOING TO GET.

43
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,826
THEY BEFORE THIS MEETING AND 

44
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,495
BEFORE THIS MISSILE LAUNCH, THEY

45
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,629
HAVE BEEN WEAK ON MILITARY IN 

46
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,567
TERMS OF SPENDING AND VERY HARD 

47
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,470
TO GET THE MILITARY FOR A LOT OF

48
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,805
OTHER THINGS.

49
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,939
MILITARY IS SECONDARY TO THEM, 

50
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,241
NOT TO ME.

51
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,775
FOR ONE THING, WE WON'T BE HERE 

52
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:50,743
WITHOUT OUR MILITARY.

53
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,013
WE'RE BUILDING STRONGER, BIGGER,

54
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:54,613
BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.

55
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:59,319
GENERAL MATTIS CAN TESTIFY TO 

56
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,986
THEY WANT TAX INCREASES AND WE 

57
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:03,456
WANT MAJOR TAX DECREASES SO THEY

58
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,557
DECIDED NOT TO SHELL UP.

59
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,526
THEY'VE BEEN ALL TALK AND NO 

60
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:08,026
ACTION.

61
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:10,128
AND NOW IT'S EVEN WORSE.

62
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:13,032
NOW IT'S NOT EVEN TALK.

63
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,534
SO THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP FOR 

64
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,836
THE MEETING.

65
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,604
IN LIGHT OF THE MISSILE LAUNCH, 

66
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,640
THEY'LL PROBABLY BE HERE FAIRLY 

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,408
QUICKLY OR AT LEAST DISCUSSIONS 

68
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,977
WILL AT LEAST START TAKING PLACE

69
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,912
FAIRLY QUICKLY.

70
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,013
I THINK THAT WE'RE IN A VERY 

71
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,916
GOOD POSITION IN TERMS OF THE 

72
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,416
MEETING.

73
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,319
WE JUST HAD OVER AT THE CAPITAL 

74
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,153
WITH THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

75
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,555
THAT WAS OUTSTANDING.

76
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,123
I THINK WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 

77
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,691
SUPPORT AND INFORMED BY MITCH 

78
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,060
THAT WE HAD A UNANIMOUS VOTE 

79
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,629
FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, AT 

80
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:42,829
LEAST.

81
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:49,702
WE HAD A VOTE ON THE 

82
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,904
TAX BILL AND I THINK IT'S GOING 

83
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:54,373
TO PASS AND GOING TO BE VERY 

84
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:56,109
POPULAR AND LOTS OF ADJUSTMENTS 

85
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,943
BEFORE IT ENDS BUT THE END 

86
00:02:57,943 --> 00:02:59,746
RESULT WOULD BE A VERY, VERY 

87
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,513
MASSIVE, THE LARGEST IN THE 

88
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:05,652
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY TAX CUT 

89
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,886
AND LOTS OF GOOD THINGS ARE 

90
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,653
GOING TO HAPPEN INCLUDING 

91
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:11,824
BRINGING BACK TO OUR COUNTRY OF 

92
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,860
PROBABLY END UP BEING OVER $4 

93
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,162
TRILLION, MONEY OFFSHORE THAT'S 

94
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,197
STAGNANT THAT COMPANIES AND JUST

95
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,898
NOT ABLE TO BRING IT BACK, SO I 

96
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:26,239
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A NUMBER 

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,741
OVER  4 TRILLION DOLLARS.

98
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,710
IF YOU LOOK AT CHINA AND SO MANY

99
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,011
OTHER COUNTRIES, MANY OTHER 

100
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:37,383
COUNTRIES, CHINA IS AT 15%.

101
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,717
THEY'RE LOWER THAN US, A LEVEL 

102
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:40,386
EITHER LOWER OR RIGHT IN THE 

103
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,721
BALLPARK SO THAT WE COULD 

104
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,456
COMPETE MUCH BETTER WITH OUR 

105
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,290
COMPANIES, OUR GREAT, GREAT 

106
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,791
COMPANIES AND THAT MEANS JOBS, 

107
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,161
THAT MEANS LOTS OF OTHER THINGS.

108
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,698
I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE 

109
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,631
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LEVEL IS 

110
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,201
JUST ABOUT THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER

111
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:55,401
BEEN.

112
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,236
IN FACT, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE 

113
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,771
ANY MISTAKES IN FRONT OF THE 

114
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:01,974
PRESS BUT YOU'LL GET ME ON IT 

115
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:03,576
BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IT'S THE 

116
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,046
HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN.

117
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,247
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PEOPLE 

118
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,148
LEADING THEIR COUNTRY.

119
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,184
AND I WILL SAY THAT I THINK IT'S

120
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,451
GOING TO GO BETTER AND BETTER 

121
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:16,289
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS VOTE 

122
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,591
ON TAXES WHICH ARE REALLY TAX 

123
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,625
CUTS AND REFORM IS GOING TO BE 

124
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,394
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.

125
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,862
SO WE HAD A GOOD DAY TODAY.

126
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,897
WE HAD A PHENOMENAL MEETING WITH

127
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:29,234
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS.

128
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,938
WE HAD, VERY SPECIAL THAT 

129
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,171
MEETING.

130
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,373
I WISH YOU COULD BE INSIDE THAT 

131
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:33,873
ROOM.

132
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,041
IT WAS VERY SPECIAL.

133
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,408
THE CAMARADERIE.

134
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,244
IT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A LOVEFEST.

135
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,680
THEY WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN.

136
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,547
NOT ONLY FOR THE REPUBLICAN 

137
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:41,848
PARTY.

138
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,915
I THINK MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, 

139
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,684
THEY WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN FOR 

140
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,985
THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY KNOW 

141
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,121
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.

142
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,722
FOR US TO COMPETE AND WIN AND 

143
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,457
WITH THAT, I MAYBE WILL START 

144
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,526
WITH PAUL RYAN TO SAY A FEW 

145
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,628
WORDS ABOUT WHERE WE STAND WITH 

146
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,663
DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEN MITCH 

147
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:57,997

BEING REMOVED FROM THAT IN 2008 

184
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,478
AND YET, THIS IS HOW NORTH KOREA

185
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:18,745
RESPONDS. 

186
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,780
>> IT APPEARED TO LAND IN WATERS

187
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,350
JUST OFF OF JAPAN INSIDE 

188
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,085
JAPANESE TERRITORY.

189
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,321
>> THE ECONOMIC INCLUSION ZONE 

190
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,856
IS CALLED, BUT I THINK WHAT'S 

191
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:32,291
ALSO IMPORTANT, GEORGE, IT 

192
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,026
WASN'T AIMED AT GUAM.

193
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:34,960
IT TRAVELED INTO THE SEA OF 

194
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,899
JAPAN WHERE THE OTHERS HAVE, SO 

195
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,935
IT WASN'T AS PRO VOCATIVE AS IT 

196
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,270
COULD HAVE BEEN BUT PROVOCATIVE 

197
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,570
NONETHELESS.

198
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,105
>> PRESIDENT TAKING QUESTIONS 

199
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:46,439
NOW.

200
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,306
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.

201
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,076
>> IT'S GOING TO BE BIGGER, 

202
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,511
STRONGER, BETTER THAN BEFORE.

203
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,712
WE WANT TO GET GOING ON THAT 

204
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:53,879
NOW.

205
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,647
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE FROM THIS 

206
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,182
MORNING WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT WE

207
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,953
WERE WAY, WAY FAR AWAY AND WITH 

208
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,656
THAT, I MAY JUST HAVE GENERAL 

209
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,624
MATTIS SAY JUST A COUPLE OF 

210
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:08,694
WORDS ABOUT WHAT HE HAS FOUND 

211
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:08,860
OUT.

212
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,898
DO YOU WANT TO SAY JUST A COUPLE

213
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,333
LITTLE PIECES OF INFORMATION?

214
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,335
>> SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES 

215
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:16,568
MATTIS. 

216
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:20,739
>> 2.5 HOURS AGO, NORTH KOREA 

217
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,510
LAUNCHED AN INTERCONTINENTAL 

218
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:24,910
BALLISTIC MISSILE.

219
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,713
IT WENT HIGHER, FRANKLY, THAN 

220
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,614
ANY OTHER THAT HAS TAKEN.

221
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,250
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON 

222
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,720
THEIR PART TO BUILD BALLISTIC 

223
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,320
MISSILES THAT COULD THREATEN 

224
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,355
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BASICALLY 

225
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,057
AND IN RESPONSE, THE SOUTH 

226
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,326
KOREANS HAVE FIRED SOME END 

227
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,262
POINT MISSILES OUT INTO THE 

228
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,229
WATER TO MAKE CERTAIN NORTH 

229
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,731
KOREA UNDERSTANDS THEY COULD BE 

230
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,700
TAKEN UNDER FIRE BY OUR ALLY.

231
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,568
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S A 

232
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:54,239
CONTINUED EFFORT TO BUILD 

233
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,141
THREAT, BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT

234
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,009
THAT ENDANGERS WORLD PEACE, 

235
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,044
REGIONAL PEACE AND CERTAINLY THE

236
00:07:59,044 --> 00:07:59,378
UNITED STATES.
