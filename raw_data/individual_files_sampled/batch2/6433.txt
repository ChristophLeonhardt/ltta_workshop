AFTER DECADES OF ACTIVISM IN SAUDI ARABIA AROUND THE RIGHT TO DRIVE, STARTING IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE DRIVING LICENSES FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN ADVANCE OF THAT DATE, WHICH HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING, MANY OF THE VERY WOMEN WHO WERE ABLE TO PUSH FOR THIS CHANGE HAVE BEEN ROUNDED UP AND ARRESTED BY SAUDI AUTHORITIES I WANT TO SPOTLIGHT A FEW OF THE ACTIVISTS I ALSO WANT TO READ A COMMENT FROM ANOTHER REGISTERED DRIVE ACTIVIST WHO WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO INTERVIEW HER IN OSLO LAST YEAR AT THE FREEDOM FORUM BY THE WAY, IN ADDITION TO THE ARRESTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN, AS WAS ALLUDED TO, A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THESE ACTIVISTS IN THE PRESS THEY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO AS BELONGING TO A CELL THAT IS COMING IN TO ATTEMPT TO DESTABILIZE THE GOVERNMENT. SAUDI WOMEN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST JOINS THE CONVERSATION OF BRAVEST PEOPLE ON EARTH ALONG WITH RUSSIAN JOURNALIST, PALESTINIAN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, ETC. THE CROWN PRINCE IN SAUDI ARABIA IS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER TO SAY THE LEAST. TWO SIDES TO HIM, THEORETICALLY, ONE SIDE IS LET'S GO COMMIT THE WORST HUMAN RIGHTS ATROCITIES THE WORLD HAS SEEN IN SOME TIME IN YEMEN. AND LET'S TRY TO DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST AND START A WAR WITH IRAN. AND LET'S KIDNAP FOREIGN LEADERS, AS HE DID TO THE LEADER OF LEBANON, AND MAKE THEM RESIGN WHILE WE BASICALLY PUT A GUN TO HIS HEAD. LET ME ALSO GO CAPTURE ALL THE OTHER PRINCES AND IMPRISONED THEM IN A FANCY HOTEL UNTIL THEY GIVE ME ALL THEIR MONEY AND THEY WILL PRETEND IT'S ABOUT CORRUPTION WHILE I BUY A $500 MILLION YACHT. THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT HAPPENED. ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT I'M GOING TO LET WOMEN DRIVE. AND I'M DOING REFORMS, THE WAHHABIS AREN'T IN CHARGE ANYMORE, THE STRICT FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIMS OF SAUDI ARABIA, HE WENT ON A TOUR IN AMERICA AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF PROPAGANDA AND 60 MINUTES HELPED HIM OUT AND GAVE HIS SIDE OF THE STORY LARGELY I THINK, AND SOME ARTICLES POINT OUT SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF, BUT A LOT OF GLOWING PRAISE ABOUT HIM BEING A REFORMER BECAUSE NOW HE'S ALLIED WITH ISRAEL, IF YOU ALLY WITH ISRAEL YOU HAVE A LOT OF GREAT PRESS IN AMERICA, BUT IT TURNS OUT THE REFORMS, EH, THEY DIDN'T MENTION THE PART WHERE THEY ARREST ALL THE WOMEN WERE FIGHTING FOR THESE REFORMS THE FIRST PLACE. SO WHATEVER YOU SAW THAT WAS POSITIVE ABOUT THE CROWN PRINCE, WHATEVER LITTLE THERE WAS, NOW ADD A GIANT GRAIN OF SALT. I WAS POST TO BE EXCITED THAT IN 2018 WOMEN FOR THE FIRST TIME ARE ABLE TO DRIVE? THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD FOR WOMEN IN THIS CHARM OFFENSIVE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WAS INSULTING, HERE YOU HAVE THE PRINCE BEING LAUDED AROUND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, EVEN IN THE GUARDIAN THEY SAID HE WAS THIS REFORMER, A REVOLUTIONARY, ONE OF THE WORST PLACES IN THE WORLD FOR WOMEN, A POLICE STATE DICTATORSHIP, NOT EVEN JUST WOMEN, THERE ARE PEOPLE BEHEADED FOR SORCERY, POLITICAL DISSIDENTS EXECUTED EN MASSE FOR PROTESTING, THERE WAS NO ARAB SPRING THERE, EVERYONE WAS KILLED. THIS IS THE U.S. EMPIRE'S GAS STATION AND BATTERING RAM IN THE MIDDLE EAST, LIKE ISRAEL WE USE IT AS A ONE-STOP SHOP FOR ALL THIS STUFF AND WE COVER UP THESE EGREGIOUS WAR CRIMES. LIKE YOU SAID THE GREATEST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN THE WORLD IS IN YEMEN. SO I AM VEHEMENTLY DISGUSTED WITH THE COVERAGE OF SAUDI ARABIA, AND THEN THIS, EVEN ON TOP OF WOMEN HAVING THE RIGHT TO DRIVE, THEY ARE RESTING ALL THE PEOPLE. WILL THEY DO RETRACTIONS IN ALL THESE PAPERS THAT LAUDED HIM AS A REVOLUTIONARY? ARE THEY GOING TO DO AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE PIECE ON 60 MINUTES? THAT WILL LAST 15 OR 20 MINUTES, ABOUT HOW IT TURNS OUT, NO, HE'S JUST AS BARBARIC AS OF ONE ELSE, PLUS ALL THE OTHER THINGS? NO. BUT LOOK, WE KNOW THE PREPOSTEROUS DOUBLE STANDARD OF THE U.S. PRESS. WHEN IRAN STRUCK BACK AT ISRAEL AFTER ISRAEL HAD REPEATEDLY BOMBED THEIR POSITIONS INSIDE SYRIA, MOST OF THE PRESS REPORTED IT AS ISRAEL HAS TO RESPOND TO IRAN'S ATTACKS. CONVENIENTLY LIVING OUT ISRAEL'S EARLIER ATTACKS. EVEN THE NEW YORK TIMES, THEY WOULD WRITE IT, BUT ON PARAGRAPH 48, BY THE WAY ISRAEL ATTACKED EARLIER. LOOK, THERE IS AN ISRAEL, SAUDI ARABIA, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES ALLIANCE. ANYONE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THAT ALLIANCE QATAR, IRAN, YEMEN IS IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE. AND ANYONE ON THE QUOTE UNQUOTE RIGHT SIDE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DO. THESE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SAUDI ARABIA UNDER A REIGN OF TERROR WHERE THEY IMPRISON THEM AND CALL THEM TRADERS, WHAT DO WE DO? NOTHING. I GUARANTEE YOU THEY WON'T BE A SANCTION, SINGLE ACTION, BECAUSE IF THIS ALLIANCE IS IN FAVOR OF IT, WE BOW OUR HEADS. I DISAGREE THAT THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE ACTION, EVENTUALLY THEY WILL RUN OUT OF THE WEAPONS WE JUST SOLD THEM AND THEY WILL NEED MORE. WE HAVE TO SELL THEM TO THEM EVENTUALLY, CENK, GET REAL. AND OBVIOUSLY GREAT CONTEXT AROUND THIS. FOR THIS ISSUE, THEY ARE ROUNDING UP ALL THESE PEOPLE, I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT ON THE 24TH THESE LICENSES WILL BE GIVEN OUT. IF YOU READ ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS CAMPAIGN IT GOES BACK MULTIPLE DECADES OF WOMEN GOING OUT, ORIGINALLY JUST ONE OR TWO PEOPLE WOULD DO THIS, GET ARRESTED AND LOCKED UP, IT HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES, LIKE I SAID, I THINK THE BOOK IS DARING TO DRIVE, SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE FILMED DRIVING AND SPREAD IT AROUND, THANKFULLY THAT GOT SOME INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION, BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT, I HAVE STARTED WATCHING THE HANDMADE'S TALE THEY HAVE IT WAY BETTER THAN WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA HAVE IT NOW. SO TO WATCH EVEN THE SMALL GAINS THAT THE ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT OF THIS REGIME POSSIBLY BEING TAKEN BACK IS HEARTBREAKING. THAT IS WHY I THINK I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL SO WHO KNOWS THAT'S WHAT I THINK THEY MAKE IT TO DRIVE ON THE 24TH BECAUSE THIS AT LEAST SENDS THE MESSAGE TO THE ACTIVISTS, IF YOU ARE THINKING LIKE A DICTATOR, YOU ARE GETTING WHAT YOU WANT, YOU ARE GETTING A WIN, BUT YOU'RE NOT. SO EVERYONE ELSE LOOK AT THIS SAYING I MIGHT WIN HERE BUT I WILL PERSONALLY PAY FOR IT AS I DO. THEY DO SEE THE REST OF THE WORLD BEING MAD ABOUT THIS. IT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE SAYING DON'T EVER DO WHAT THESE WOMEN DID. GREAT POINT, JEN. TWO PARTS TO IT, ONE IS WE ARE GIVING YOU A CONCESSION BUT DON'T TRY IT AGAIN BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU GET THE CONCESSION YOU PERSONALLY WILL PAY A HUGE PRICE, DON'T EVER FORGET. DON'T DEFY US. THE IDEA THAT THE GUY IS A REVOLUTIONARY IS HILARIOUS, HE'S LITERALLY A DICTATOR. YOU NEED THE REVOLUTION AGAINST HIM. DICTATORS DON'T NEED REVOLUTIONS. DON'T GET ME WRONG, IF HE GETS RID OF THE WAHHABIS AND BRINGS SAUDI ARABIA CLOSER TO SECULARISM I WOULD LOVE THAT. BUT I WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT, AND IT DOESN'T VITIATE ALL OF THE OTHER TERRIBLE THINGS HE'S DOING. BUT THE SECOND PART OF JEN'S POINT IS THE WAHHABIS, THE FUNDAMENTALISTS, ARE STRONG, SO THEY MIGHT BE SAYING WE KNOW HOW MUCH YOU DESPISE THESE REVOLUTIONARIES SO WE WILL WALK THEM UP ANYWAY. THAT'S A WAY TO SMOOTH THE WAY TOWARDS A TINY AMOUNT OF REFORM. THEY WILL STILL HAVE TO ASK THEIR HUSBANDS IF THEY CAN DRIVE.
