1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,067
BLANKET ON IT.

2
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:01,735
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.

3
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:02,736
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN THE

4
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,170
ALTERNATIVE, AND THEY SAID HE

5
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,673
WOULD DO THE OPPOSITE, THE

6
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,141
SO-CALLED EXPERT CLASS.

7
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,142
FANTASTIC, GUYS.

8
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,012
LET'S GET SOME INSIGHT FROM

9
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,146
SOMEONE WITH UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE.

10
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,415
CIA DIRECTOR IN 1994 WHEN

11
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,250
PRESIDENT CLINTON STRUCK A DEAL

12
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,752
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO END

13
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:19,419
NORTH KOREA'S NUKE PROGRAM.

14
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,687
JIM, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

15
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,357
WHAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THIS

16
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,358
TIME GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE

17
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,394
WITNESSED OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR

18
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,162
EIGHT MONTHS, THIS PRESIDENT'S

19
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:29,929
CHILD FROM HIS APPROACH AND WHAT

20
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,200
YOU SAW FROM KIM YESTERDAY.

21
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,536
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

22
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,539
PUT THE NORTH KOREANS UNDER

23
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,940
PRESSURE IN A WAY THAT THEY DID

24
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,477
NOT REMOTELY EXPECT.

25
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,479
HE SORT OF PLAYED GOOD COP-BAD

26
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,715
COP AND THAT HE HAS TAKEN BOTH

27
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,684
ROLES.

28
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:51,484
SOMETIMES HE'S A GOOD COP AND HE

29
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:56,156
IS SAYING FRIENDLY LAUDATORY

30
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,457
THINGS ABOUT KIM JONG UN AND

31
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,926
OTHER TIMES, HE'S TALKING ABOUT

32
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,430
FIRE AND FURY AND SO FORTH.

33
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,133
KEEPS HIM OFF BALANCE.

34
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,568
I DON'T THINK THEY HAD A VERY

35
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,470
GOOD IDEA ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH

36
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,074
HIS STYLE OF NEGOTIATING, WHICH

37
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,375
I MUST ADMIT, DID NOT INITIALLY

38
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,777
ATTRACT ME.

39
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,013
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT

40
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,881
INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO IT ARE

41
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:22,582
BEGINNING TO SEE IT WORK AND

42
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,416
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND

43
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,752
SAYING HEY, MAYBE I WAS WRONG ON

44
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,421
THIS MAYBE HE WAS RIGHT.

45
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,457
>> Laura: LEON PANETTA WAS

46
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,925
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A MONTH AND

47
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,028
A HALF AGO IN MID-APRIL ABOUT

48
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:35,762
WHAT HE VIEWED THE PRESIDENT TO

49
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,365
BE IN TERMS OF PROVOCATIVE.

50
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,267
WAY TOO PROVOCATIVE IN DEALING

51
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,169
WITH THIS DANGEROUS POWER.

52
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,370
LET'S WATCH.

53
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,339
>> THE WORDS FROM THE

54
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,475
ADMINISTRATION ARE CREATING EVEN

55
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,342
HIGHER VOLUME IN TERMS OF THE

56
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,745
PROVOCATIONS GOING ON.

57
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,847
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL

58
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,349
HERE.

59
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,484
WE SHOULDN'T ENGAGE IN ANY

60
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,585
PRECIPITOUS ACTION.

61
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,419
THERE'S A REASON NO U.S.

62
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,154
PRESIDENT IN RECENT HISTORY HAS

63
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:05,959
PULLED THE TRIGGER ON

64
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,359
NORTH KOREA.

65
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,994
>> Laura: THAT WAS IN APRIL OF

66
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:12,265
2017, TO BE CLEAR.

67
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,168
IT'S A YEAR AFTER PLUS A MONTH

68
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,037
OR SO AND HERE WE ARE.

69
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,739
THE BEGINNING OF A FRAMEWORK

70
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,940
THAT WAS RECONFIRMED IN ANOTHER

71
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,275
BRIEF MESSAGE THAT CAME OUT A

72
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,877
FEW HOURS AGO THAT THEY ARE

73
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,279
COMMITTED TO DOING THIS.

74
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,149
WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS ABOUT THIS

75
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,050
ADMINISTRATION GOING FORWARD,

76
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,718
THE ABILITY TO OBVIOUSLY DO

77
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,754
INSPECTIONS AND SO FORTH.

78
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,089
HOW DO WE VERIFY?

79
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:40,593
>> VERIFICATION IS TOUGH ON

80
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,795
UNDERTAKINGS LIKE THIS.

81
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,163
WE COULD PROBABLY DO IT IF WE

82
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,131
HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF

83
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,867
COOPERATION FROM KIM JONG UN HIS

84
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,802
PEOPLE.

85
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:58,178
THEY HAVE SIDESWIPED HE EFFORT

86
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:58,912
TO UNDERTAKE SERIOUS INSPECTIONS

87
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:03,650
BEFORE THE NORTH KOREANS.

88
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,021
THE IRANIANS WERE EXTRAORDINARY

89
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,157
DUPLICITOUS IN STEERING PEOPLE

90
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:11,791
AWAY OF ANYTHING THAT WAS

91
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,960
INTERESTING TO LOOK AT.

92
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,627
THEIR AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED

93
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,530
HAPPILY AND THEN TAKEN APART BY

94
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,366
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

95
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,968
THE ONE SITUATION I AM THE MOST

96
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,137
CONCERNED ABOUT, NOT BECAUSE I'M

97
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,071
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE

98
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,340
IT IS SO IMPORTANT, IS CHINA.

99
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,076
WITH A COOPERATIVE CHINA, WILL

100
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,246
WORK THIS OUT.

101
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:37,016
BUT WITH A CHINA THAT BELIEVES

102
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,819
THAT THEY HAVE TO STAND UP TO US

103
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:45,191
IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA OR WHAT,

104
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,293
WE COULD STUMBLE HERE.

105
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:52,832
BUT SO FAR I'VE GOT TO SAY MY

106
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,167
WIFE'S PROGNOSTICATION THAT

107
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,269
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS GOING TO GET

108
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,239
ELECTED AND RULE THE WAY HAS

109
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,573
COME I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

110
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,077
SHE HAD IT RIGHT AND I HAD IT

111
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,377
WRONG.

112
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,312
>> Laura: [LAUGHS]

113
00:04:06,312 --> 00:00:00,000
WELL, THAT'S A MAN WE LIKE.
