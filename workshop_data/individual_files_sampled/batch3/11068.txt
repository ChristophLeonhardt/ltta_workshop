the international nuclear watchdog has confirmed that Iran is preparing to restart the production of a chemical compound that can be used to produce nuclear weapons to run earlier sent an official letter informing the organization that it's stepping up its enrichment capacity right now the electrical infrastructure and utilities at Natanz are ready for hundreds of thousands of separative work units we've started the work yesterday we sent a letter about the start of some activities to the IAEA these developments come with the Iran nuclear deal on the verge of unraveling the 2015 Accord was the result of long drawn-out negotiations but lifted international sanctions against Iran and in turn Tehran gave up its nuclear aspirations and significantly limit significantly limited its enrichment program but now that the US has scrapped the agreement sanctions are being imposed again and Washington is warning there's more to come we will apply unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime the leaders in Tehran will have no doubt about our seriousness these will indeed end up being the strongest sanctions in history when we are completing the EU has reacted to Iran's latest move saying that although it doesn't constitute a breach of the deal the revival of enrichment activities by Tehran exacerbates the already fragile situation meanwhile both Iran and Washington are putting pressure on Europe each issuing threats and ultimatums is the u.s. going to impose sanctions on European companies that continue to do business with Iran I think I did give the answer the answer is it's possible it depends on the conduct of other governments European countries seem to expect the Iranian people to both suffer from the sanctions and give up their nuclear energy activities abiding by the jcpoa limits I'm telling those countries that this is a dream that's never going to come true this will never happen xayide Mohamed mirandy a politics professor at the University of Tehran believes Iran has shown remarkable restraint and the ball is now in europe's court i think without a doubt the Iranians have shown a great deal of patience so far when the Americans pulled out many expected the Iranians to pull out immediately as well because after all this was a multilateral agreement and the United States is the key antagonist and if when the United States pulls out the the the agreement really becomes almost meaningless however the Iranians show patience and they told the Europeans that if they are willing to grow backbone and stand up to the Americans protect their citizens protect their business people and their corporations and companies and banking and financial institutions with real commitments if they have solid if they bring forth solid commitments to show the Iranians that they're willing to do this then Iran can stay within the agreement but otherwise if the mere the Europeans are just going to give verbal support and back down and allow their companies to be sanctioned and punished by the Americans then there's absolutely no reason why the Iranians should stay in agreement
