we just got this information from dr. Ford's lawyer their response to this threatened deadline of 10:00 p.m. - make up your mind and I'm gonna read you the final paragraph of of what Deborah Katz said into the committee staff in response to this threatened deadline tonight of 10:00 p.m. she said the 10:00 p.m. deadline is arbitrary its sole purpose is to bully dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family she has already been forced out of her home and continues to be subjected to harassment hate mail and death threats our modest request is that she be given an additional day to make her decision and I am so glad the Deborah Katz has used the word bully to describe exactly what chuck grassley and all of the Republicans in the Senate are trying to do because every Republican senator has joined and supported chuck Grassley in the bullying tactics that Chuck Grassley has been using with dr. Ford the first deadline that Senator Chuck Grassley gave to professor Christine Blasi Ford to agree to his terms for her to testify to de jure she Airy committee was 10 a.m. this morning that was her deadline and then he moved that deadline to 5:00 p.m. today and he moved that deadline again to 10 p.m. and each time senator Grassley did that he did it in the media first he announced it to the media before he announced it to or communicated directly with dr. Ford's lawyers senator Grassley reached some compromises with dr. Ford's attorneys but refused some of dr. Ford's most important requests senator Grassley agreed to the request that Brett Kavanaugh would not be in the room when dr. Ford is testifying but did not agree to her request that Brett Kavanaugh testify first senator Grassley wants dr. Ford to testify first followed by Brett Kavanaugh dr. Ford requested that only senators be allowed to ask questions but senator Grassley said the committee will quote reserve the option to have female staff attorneys are sensitive to the particulars of dr. Ford's allegations and our experienced investigators question both witnesses we believe this will allow for informed questioning will generate the most insightful testimony and will help deep politicize the hearing chairman Grassley has refused dr. Ford's request that the committee subpoena the testimony of Marc judge who dr. Ford says was in the room when Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her and participated in that assault the ten Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee since a letter to chairman Grassley today saying quote the committee should at a minimum hear from the FBI the individual who administered dr. Ford's polygraph tests and all witnesses to the event this includes Marc judge each of the individuals Republican staff have contacted and other relevant witnesses there is simply no reason not to hear all the facts the committee should also hear from character witnesses for judge Kavanaugh and dr. Ford it is only fair to both as well as from outside experts who can speak to these allegations and one reason the Democrats want outside experts to testify is a tweet by the President of the United States this morning I have no doubt that if the attack on dr. Ford was as bad as she says charges would have been immediately filed with local law enforcement authorities by either her or her loving parents I asked that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date time and place as bad as she says that is the new presidential defense of his nominee earlier this week the president was pretending that he wanted to hear what dr. Ford had to say but that's all over now Donald Trump's not pretending anymore but he does seem willing to accept the notion that Christine Blasi Ford was attacked by Brett Kavanaugh when they were in high school but the attack just wasn't that bad he said if the attack on dr. Ford was as bad as she says the president's acceptance of an attack in that tweet suggests that the White House and the Republicans are anticipating very convincing testimony from dr. Ford that is also the working principle behind a Twitter campaign launched yesterday and then quickly abandoned in which a Republican operatives pushing the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh suggested another suspect from Brett Kavanaugh High School class because he looks like Brett Kavanaugh in their high school photos now we're not going to show you those photos that were posted on Twitter because it is so reckless and irresponsible a charge that Republican Ed Whelan who posted this theory has completely retracted ed Whelan is the head of an organization that falsely calls itself the ethics and Public Policy Center and he is obviously a morally bankrupt ethically vacant human being but he works closely with Republican administrations on Supreme Court confirmations and the most interesting part of ed Wieland's perverse theory of the case is that he completely accepts the idea that dr. Ford was sexually assaulted it just wasn't Brett Kavanaugh that tells you that the Republican machinery that is working overtime to defend Brett Kavanaugh is expecting dr. Ford to be so convincing a witness that the only two defenses available in the end might be mistaken identity or as Donald Trump says just wasn't that bad Republicans have no intention of offering dr. Ford a fair hearing fair is out of the question the question is only how unfair will it be it's going to be so unfair that the Republican leader of the Senate today said he already has the votes for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it's a done deal you've watched the fight you've watched the tactics but here's what I want to tell you in a very near future Judge Cavanaugh will be on the United States Supreme Court so my friends keep the faith don't get rattled by all of this we're gonna plow right through it and do our job plow right through it Mitch McConnell knows the outcome he has not heard one word from dr. Ford but he knows he is going to plow right through it Mitch McConnell does not have a public record of lying when he says he has the votes to get something through the Senate and that's what he said today he has the votes so the question tonight about those Republican votes in the Senate is is Mitch McConnell lying or is Senator Susan Collins lying when she says that she's undecided is Senator Lisa Murkowski lying when she says that she is undecided is Senator Jeff Flake lying when he says that he wants to hear the testimony of dr. Ford why would Jeff Flake need to hear that testimony Mitch McConnell just said he has jeff flakes vote in his pocket right now it's a done deal the Democratic senators letter to chairman Grassley says there is not an effort to get this is not an effort to get to the truth we fear that rather than learning from the past Senate Republicans in the Trump administration are repeating this committees previous mistakes and making new ones up to this point the committee majority's treatment of dr. Ford has unquestionably been worse than the disgraceful treatment that Anita Hill received 27 years ago and that disgraceful treatment was delivered to Anita Hill by Chuck Grassley who was a member of the committee then and by Orrin Hatch who was a Republican member of the committee then they have both spent the week lying about the precedent set in the Anita Hill case and in every such controversy in the confirmation process the standard procedure of an FBI investigation they're not doing that for dr. Ford no FBI investigation because their plan is to treat her with even more unfairness than they treated a Nita Hill Anita Hills accusations got three days of testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee 22 witnesses were heard Chuck Grassley wants one day of a hearing with only two witnesses judge Cavanaugh and dr. Ford because Chuck Grassley's job is to do what you just heard Mitch McConnell promised to just plow right through it Democrats want to hear from all the relevant witnesses and quote outside experts who can speak to these allegations that's always a good idea but now for fairness it is an absolutely mandatory idea now that the president of the United States is publicly questioning why Christine Blasi Ford did not report this assault when she was a teenager the reasons that young girls and women don't report these assaults are well-known they've been discussed many times on television we know Donald Trump watches television there is a vast body of scholarly literature about it there are articles in the popular press about it and there have been for decades we all know the painful reasons that sometimes these cases are not reported hundreds of thousands of women tweeted today under the hashtag why I didn't report and I urge you all to spend some time reading their reasons their personal reasons women know the reasons you know who else knows the reasons sexual assaulters they're counting on women not reporting and the President of the United States is both an accused sexual assault er and a confessed sexual assault er we all heard him describe the sexual assault of way in which he likes to grab women when he was recorded on that Access Hollywood bus surrounded by strangers a camera crew a bus driver all sorts of people he didn't know and that's what he was willing to confess to them to strangers so imagine what his real personal truth and his real personal history is on sexual assault his first wife accused him of rape under oath and so an accused sexual assault er has now given his opinion in a sexual assault case and his opinion is that whatever Brett Kevin did to Christine for it just wasn't that bad wasn't as bad as she says presidents are not supposed to comment on criminal investigations but Donald Trump has done that many times presidents are not supposed to comment on ongoing criminal cases but Donald Trump has done that many times presidents are not supposed to comment about a criminal trial but Donald Trump did that during the Paul Manafort trial he tried to influence the mana forgery because he had every right to believe that there were Trump voters on the mana forgery and he was right but the one man for sharor who we heard from was a trump voter and she took her oath as a juror very seriously and she voted guilty on every single count against Paul Manafort Republican United States senators do not take their oaths as seriously as Paul man affords jurors did and so their minds are made up if you believe Mitch McConnell their minds are made up they're gonna plow right through it minds are made up before dr. Ford has spoken a single word during Charles Manson's trial for multiple murders President Nixon made the mistake in a rush to answer in a press conference of suggesting that Charles Manson was guilty in the Nixon White House immediately issued a corrective statement retracting that comment saying the president of course did not intend to make that comment the president did not intend to influence that trial or influence that jury in any way Donald Trump is now trying to tamper with the jury Mitch McConnell has surely told Donald Trump but he has the votes to confirm judge Cavanaugh so the Senate is not the jury Donald Trump was trying to influence Donald Trump is trying to influence the jury that votes on November 6th he's trying to influence the jury who's first chance to make their statements about what they see in the Senate Judiciary Committee next week will occur on November 6th and what he's saying to that jury is what Donald Trump has always said you cannot believe the woman you must never believe the woman because whatever happened was not as bad as she says thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
