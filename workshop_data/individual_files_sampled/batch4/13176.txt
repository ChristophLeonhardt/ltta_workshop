announced yesterday Medicare will be insolvent by 2026 and Social Security by 2034 so this means of course something that we already knew but now it makes it official that baby boomers will be the last to enjoy either benefit their kids the Millennials and younger generations are pay paying into this system financing it but it will not be there for us the older generations are draining it dry and leaving nothing for their kids that's what's happening how else can you put it that's what's happening there they are milking this thing dry and just tossing it to the side and saying to their kids generation well see ya good luck yes the older generations have been completely resistant to any discussion of reforming or changing these programs so that perhaps the programs might be around for their kids it's it's something that they won't even let you talk about if any politician tries to bring it up and almost none of them do because they all lack the moral courage to do so even though every single one of them the politicians I mean they all know the reality they've known the reality of these systems yet they have they'd they will not speak truth because the older generations vote and they will vote out any politician who's who speaks up and says hey guys you know maybe we don't want to steal tens of thousands of dollars from each one of our kids and leave them with nothing I mean maybe we don't want to do that maybe we should think about something reforming changing something making some adjustments here if any politician does that they'll just be voted out of office now personally I would love to do away with social security and save for my own retirement so when I talk about these programs being there for me I I don't want them I I but I also don't want to finance them for my entire working life which will be my entire life because I'm net not ever gonna get to retire nobody in my generation will but I would like for it's just not to exist and then I can save for my own retirement I don't need the government to save for retirement for me it's such a crazy idea such a crazy concept just I I remember the first time I ever learned about social security when I was a kid and I remember just being flabbergasted by it like what why would the why would you want the government to take your money to save it when they're not even really saving it but even if they were said why would you want that yes and I and I continue to be flabbergasted I have not I still to this day it has been perpetual a perpetual state of being flabbergasted I just like the word flabbergasted as you can tell I try to work it into conversation as much as I can so I'd like to do whatever the but but older folks say no you can't do away with it because we need your money now and then I say yeah but I won't be there for me and they say well not my problem I'll be dead so give me your money that's the way this is this conversation is going so it can't be abolished can't be changed can't be reformed and as the last baby boomers are dying off in the 2030s and 2040s they will take Social Security with them now what I'm told I talked about this yesterday a little bit on Twitter and I was told by some baby boomers they when I said that you know they're gonna drain this thing dry and leave nothing for their kids and what I was told by some boomers is yeah you're darn right I'm gonna drain the dry this is my money of course I'm gonna drain it dry it's my money yeah but it's not your money that's the thing your money is gone it is gone baby gone I mean it's it's just it is long gone I hate to tell you and I mean it's a terrible thing to so I Corps sympathetic it's happening to me right now but you didn't pay into anything there was it wasn't being kept in a lockbox somewhere the government doesn't have a giant vault somewhere where they're keeping all the Social Security payments and they've got each thing and you know nice little like a bank vault and each person has so there are millions of little drawers or something keeping all the money that's not the way this goes your money is gone it has been stolen by the government not by us we can have anything to do with it so this is not your money it's my money my generations mine we are my generation we're just starting out in life some of us are a little bit further along in that regard than others we are we don't have anywhere near the same assets the same financial security as you do as an older person yet we are being tasked with financing this huge system this huge cumbersome gigantic failing system that will not be there for us that's the way this is going it is just a horrible way to do things you've got the younger generations who have no money and no assets and I think I looked it up once I don't remember exactly the statistic but the average net worth of someone in my generation versus the average net worth of say a baby boomer I mean with our ad average net worth is a third or a quarter yet we're the ones who have to finance this thing and so it kind of leaves if you're if you're a baby boomer it leaves you with a choice you can either insist that we keep this system going as it is now so that you can make all you can from it by taking from your kids generation knowing that it won't be there for us so you could do that which is what essentially we have been doing this whole time or you can demand that some changes and reforms be made to it you can say I'm willing to make a sacrifice now for my kids generation because this is not right what we're doing you could say no I'm not yes the money was stolen for me it's a horrible thing I am NOT going to demand that I be made whole from the theft that happened to me by stealing for my kids so I'm going to end this cycle of theft and deception I don't want it to continue I'm not going to put it on my kids so you could say that it is really just a shame that I have very rarely heard an older person say that almost all of them it seems are going with the former choice and saying look I don't care I just need to get mine which brings me to a point that I want to make I'll try to be as delicate as I can hear all of this complaining that people do about the millennial generation calling it entitled and spoiled and selfish and lazy I just I just don't see how the older generations especially baby boomers can accuse other people of those sins with a straight face let's review okay the baby-boomers inherited a prosperous country from their parents their parents who won world war ii and did all those great things so they inherited a prosperous country from them they leave behind a bankrupted country drowning in debt they inherited a culture with strong nuclear families they leave behind a legacy of divorce and broken families and they in fact were so terrible at marriage that their kids have given up on marriage almost entirely they inherited relatively strong churches they leave behind empty decaying churches and we can go right down the list looking at things politically and socially I mean think about politically think about all the baby boomers baby boomer politicians has there been a good one that's almost the worst thing about well it's not the worst thing the worst thing is the destruction wrought upon the family by the boomers but still politically whether you're looking at politically socially culturally we find that the boomers just absolutely decimated everything so it as the kind of their last and final act that kind of drain Social Security dry and leave nothing for their kids you know so our Millennials entitled in selfish yeah many are but where do you think they learned it from where do you think they picked up the habit where did they learn it from they learned it from the best clearly they were they were they were tutored they were under the tutelage of their parents generation and now the worst thing about the millennial generation is that they're ending up exactly like their parents they learned it to be specific from divorced parents who plopped them in front of televisions for their entire childhood let the media and Hollywood raise their kids so that they could run out and amass material wealth for themselves at the expenses of their families and their marriages that's where they learned it and now these very same people who have been selfish and entitled their entire lives and are leaving behind destruction and ruin from everywhere they went have the audacity the gumption to sit back enjoying a retirement that we will never experience on a pension we will never have with Social Security checks that we will never see and complain about the kids that they screwed up it's incredible it's such an incredible dynamic that we're seeing play out how do we let them get away with it how do we ever let a boomer complain about anyone let alone their own kids who are turning out exactly like them maybe you have these people who didn't even bother to raise their own kids and are now shocked when they see how their kids are behaving you now whenever I point out the cataclysmic awfulness of the boomer generation I am and I mean I cataclysmic I don't know how else to describe it especially when you look at what they did to the family into marriage but whenever I point this out I'm scolded for generalized and for being divisive and for engaging in generational warfare and all that now funnily enough those very same people who who tell me I shouldn't criticize entire generations they would they never complain when I criticize Millennials which I do all the time I criticize my own generation all the time and I'm quite unforgiving in those criticisms of my peers and of myself and whenever I do that I never hear these people say well you know that's unfair you shouldn't lump an entire generation together no they don't say it then they only say it when you talk about their generation so again we see the Boomers expecting special treatment which is in keeping with how they've always operated now and I know this obviously does not apply to every boomer it doesn't apply to my own parents hopefully if you're a Boomer watching this it does or listen to this it doesn't apply to you although although I don't know if it does or not but I mean only you know but if you know it doesn't apply to you then there's no reason to be offended by anything that I'm saying I'm sure in that case you agree with me because just like when when people criticize the Millennial Generation III you generally agree with those criticisms and I say so but it's clear that the boomer generation as a whole has been horrific ly historically terrible and I do believe that's important to point out for two reasons number one it's just a matter of being honest and just you know I can't sit here and allow all the problems in our society to be foisted by the people who cause the problems onto my generation I just can't I can't tolerate that it's not right it's not just it's not honest and so I think in the interest of being honest it's important to point this out and I really I just I'm sorry I don't have a lot of sympathy for boomers who whine when their generation is criticized howdy Millennials are criticized off by everywhere all the time constantly our whole lives is I mean this is everything's been all the problems in society have been put on our shoulders from like from birth for goodness sakes and now you can't handle it when you're criticized a little bit I mean cry me a river second if we're ever going to break this cycle we have to understand where these problems come from and what caused them to put out to put all the blame on Millennials it's not just unjust and dishonest but it also precludes us from actually ever solving any problems because we're ignoring the origin of the problems and where is the origin where can you find the origin well as always it goes back to the family it goes back to the home baby boomers speaking generally okay and it's not true of every single one individually as I've already said a million times now but baby boomers were very very bad at marriage and very very bad at parenting and I I feel that's the statistics back me up on that I mean look at the divorce rate especially look at the divorce rate in like the late 80s early 90s when or really throughout the eighties into the early nineties look at the divorce rate when the boomer generation was in kind of crime marrying years look at the divorce rate it is just astronomically high it shot through the roof with the boomer generation so when I say they were bad at marriage I mean that's an understatement I'm being very kind putting it that way and if you're bad at marriage you're gonna be bad at parenting um how do we reverse this trend as Millennials we've got to be able to look at it be honest about it so that we can reverse that have some chance of reversing the trend well we reverse it by shifting our focus by putting our priorities where they belong in the home with our families we form stable fan families we remain loyal to them we reject materialism selfishness greed secularism all of these things that our parents generation embraced we have to reject we have to build our families on something stronger than that that's our only hope that's our hope of really making the change and I mean I don't have a lot of hope that it will actually happen because I look at my own generation and for the most part most of us seem to be repeating the same mistakes as our parents and that's not the case across the board there there are pockets of Millennials in America who are really rebelling against the rebellion of their parents generation our parents generation rebelled with drugs and sex and and and orgies and STDs okay that's how our that's our parents generation rebelled if we're going to rebel against them which we must and we should we rebel with a Bible and by getting married and having kids and staying low loyal to our families and praying with our families and going to church that's how we rebel and there are some some millennial rebels like that but I think unfortunately those pockets are few and far between where you find them though is a wonderful thing and you see the hope of tomorrow in those places I pointed out before that in almost every case the the best churches that I've been through the churches that are on fire with the faith are really Orthodox and reverent and really love the faith and truth and are engaging the culture and engaging these talking about these issues that need to be talked about and are really fighting you know where you can go and really find the church militant people that are militant about their faith in almost every case those are young churches and most of the time LED by younger men most every case the churches that you go to that are just Arar just shallow and flimsy and secular and pathetic and weak in almost every case those are older churches populated by and led by boomers and that's not a coincidence so that shows you that shows you that there that there are some Millennials who are who have learned the right lessons and are trying to apply them I just don't know if there are enough we have to fight in any case and we fight by looking at the mistakes that were made looking at looking where people went off course and then going in the other direction it's just that uh we're going to have to do that without the benefit of Social Security or retirement or anything like that but that's the way it goes no sense of complaining about it thanks for watching thanks for listening everybody god speed you
