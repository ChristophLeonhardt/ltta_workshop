11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,630
there ended up having to run down there

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,980
in my bare feet<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there was</font>

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,370
gridlock on the streets<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was</font>

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,140
actually standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next to Byron</font>

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">began to fall but what we saw before</font>

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was unspeakable and that was people</font>

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,969
making that horrific decision of whether

19
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,690
to to jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you said in real time it</font>

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">really you just your mind mind around</font>

21
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">grasp exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what was happening and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,360
didn't even though you saw it you just

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,270
your mind didn't process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,159
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had chosen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump from the</font>

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">top of the towers also you've told</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">before that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tower the second</font>

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,590
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> tower was falling you just</font>

28
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,860
stood transfixed staring at it and that

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was Byron who actually hold you away</font>

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,659
yep and threw you under a truck<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it</font>

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,689
just seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so impossible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that structure</font>

32
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was so big and so magnificent and</font>

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">so obviously strong and had so many</font>

34
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,759
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it seemed so impossible</font>

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">what was happening right before our eyes</font>

36
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">literally we were so close we were</font>

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,270
craning our necks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the top and</font>

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,159
then the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> began to crumble down</font>

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,880
towards us<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many others</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we we</font>

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,860
ran we were covered<font color="#CCCCCC"> with soot and we</font>

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,229
stayed down there<font color="#E5E5E5"> for weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and tried to</font>

42
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,049
get our arms around the story that was

43
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,110
so close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in some ways it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

44
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,659
very hard to connect with the reality

45
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,370
for me my brain saved me from<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

46
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,049
terrible depression because I was so

47
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,110
busy<font color="#CCCCCC"> covering the story that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

48
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,239
necessarily able to grasp it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,510
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to tell it in real time and</font>

50
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,280
then in the months after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we all</font>

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,170
began<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really suffer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ramifications</font>

52
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,810
of what had happened to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> country and</font>

53
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many people that were right here</font>

we knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was either headed for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my colleagues</font>
