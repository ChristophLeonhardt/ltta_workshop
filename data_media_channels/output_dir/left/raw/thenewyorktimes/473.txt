00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:10,810
Welcome to Mars! 
[cheers]

2
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,382
All right. - Let's do it.

3
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,829
All right, let's get some 
Cheez-Its.

4
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:35,201
Guys we've got a good ship.
We've got a good crew.

5
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,137
We've got awesome mission
support.

6
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:41,474
What more could we ask for?
-We've got plenty of Cheez-Its.

7
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,470
Going outside is not an option,
at least not without a

8
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,107
spacesuit. So um-

9
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,260
feeling the wind rush
through your hair,

10
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,082
the warmth from the
sun on your skin

11
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,984
and the smell of wet grass or

12
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,154
even taste of freshly made snow
falling from the sky.

13
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,940
All those senses are
spectacular and so unique, and

14
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:39,099
you lose track of how awesome 
and vital they are to a person.

15
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,704
The landscape outside the hab 
is very barren-

16
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,007
just huge lava plains on the
side of this massive volcano

17
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,476
that we're living on.

18
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,212
I mean it definitely feels
like we're far away

19
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,980
from civilization here.

20
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,182
And it's starting to feel 
more and more

21
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:00,487
in a way familiar and 
alien at the same time.

22
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,918
Cleaning the toilets is an
interesting experience.

23
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,609
It is not the most pleasant job,
but it has to be done. And we

24
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,559
rotate it through the crew to
make it a little bit more fair.

25
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,764
Come on man, you never 
scraped poop before?

26
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,540
When we're having 
quieter days and

27
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,692
everybody's focused on 
their own work, then it's

28
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:17,363
the separation from loved ones
feels a little more present.

29
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,618
The team is bonding really well
inside the hab.

30
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,254
We are getting to know each 
other better, I would say.

31
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:45,525
We are learning each other's pet
peeves and how each other

32
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:45,558
We are learning each other's pet
peeves and how each other 
react to certain situations,
being more open with each other.

33
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:50,930
react to certain situations,
being more open with each other.

34
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,367
We're getting to a point where
we're really kind of getting

35
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,470
more comfortable with living
with each other.

36
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,552
There's something nice about

37
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:12,585
There's something nice about 
being able to step out 
of the world for a while.

38
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,988
being able to step out 
of the world for a while.

39
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,062
I no longer feel like I'm
swimming in a ton of

40
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,233
negative news and distractions.

41
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,002
My whole world is basically

42
00:04:29,035 --> 00:00:00,000
shrunken down to about 
six people.
