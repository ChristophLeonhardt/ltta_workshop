OVERSAW. HE WAS RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU ALL THIS AND MORE INTIMATES VERY IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS OPENING MONOLOGUE. THE PRESIDENT JUST WRAPPED UP A HUGE, RAUCOUS, FUN RALLY IN INDIANA. WILL BRING YOU ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. HERE IS JUST A SMALL SAMPLE OF WHAT WENT DOWN. TAKE A LOOK. IF WE WOULD'VE TOLD YOU DURING THE CAMPAIGN THAT WE WOULD CREATE 3.3 MILLION JOBS IN THIS SHORT TIME, EVERYBODY BACK THERE, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. LOOK AT ALL OF THEM. FAKE NEWS. EVERYBODY BACK THERE WOULD HAVE SAID, CAN YOU IMAGINE? HE IS SAYING WE ARE GOING TO CREATE 3.3 MILLION. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT. YOU HAVE TO WORK EVERY DAY BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER TO ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS SO THAT WE CONTINUE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE FIRST FOUR INDIANA. OUR NEW SLOGAN FOR 2020, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? KEEP AMERICA GREAT. Sean: WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THE PRESIDENTS RALLY IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST A GREAT DAY FOR THIS COUNTRY AND OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN BECAUSE EARLY THIS MORNING THE PLANE CARRYING THREE OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS WHO HAD BEEN HELD HOSTAGE IN NORTH KOREA FOR MONTHS, THEY TOUCHED DOWN IN JOINT BASE ANDREWS. OUR PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED. THESE THREE MEN CAME BACK IN GOOD HEALTH, AND WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD OF THE OUTSTANDING WORK THIS COUNTRY DID TO BRING OUR FELLOW AMERICANS HOME APPEARED PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT THE THREE FORMER HOSTAGES ON THE TARMAC AND DELIVERED THESE HOPEFUL REMARKS ABOUT 3:00 A.M. IN THE MORNING LAST NIGHT. WE WANT TO THINK KIM JONG UN WHO REALLY WAS EXCELLENT TO THESE THREE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THEY ARE REALLY INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THEM OUT SO SOON WAS REALLY A TRIBUTE TO A LOT OF THINGS, INCLUDING A CERTAIN PROCESS THAT'S TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW. IN THAT PROCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED IN A VERY SHORT. LACK OF TIME. YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT IT SOON. WE HAVE THE LOCATION SET AND WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING PEOPLE DO NOT THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. A LOT OF BAD THINGS COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN BETWEEN. Sean: THIS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT DIPLOMATIC VICTORY. WE KNOW THE DANGER THESE THREE AMERICANS FACE BECAUSE WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO OTTO WARMBIER, THE AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT HELD CAPTIVE IN NORTH KOREA WHICH ULTIMATELY CAUSED HIS HORRIFIC DEATH. THE OTTO WARMBIER FAMILY REMAIN IN OUR PRAYERS. TONIGHT WE HAVE A REASON TO FEEL HOPEFUL AND PROUD. THREE AMERICAN LIVES WERE LIKELY SAVED AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TO BRIBE KIM JONG UN OR SEND PALLETS OF CASH TO NORTH KOREA TO GET THE JOB DONE. SLOW IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, AS CORRUPT AS THEY ARE, THEY MERELY YAWNED TODAY. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BURIED THE STORY. ABC NEWS CRITICIZED PRESIDENT TRUMP ON IRAN. THE LIBERAL SENATOR FROM NEW YORK CHUCK SCHUMER WAS LESS THAN PLEASED. REALLY? THREE AMERICANS SAVED, BACK HOME. YOU ARE NOT PLEASE, YOU ARE NOT HAPPY? TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THE EXULTATION BY THE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS OF THE GREATNESS OF NORTH KOREA DOING THIS EVADES ME. HE CAN'T BE FOOLED INTO GIVING THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME CREDIT FOR RETURNING AMERICANS THAT NEVER SHOULD'VE BEEN DETAINED IN THEIR FIRST PLACE. AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE NOT DIPLOMATIC BARGAINING CHIPS. THERE REALLY SHOULD NOT BE EXALTED. IT SHOULD BE EXPECTED. IT IS NO GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT OF KIM JONG UN TO DO THIS. WHEN THE PRESIDENT DOES IT, HE WEAKENS AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AND PUTS AMERICANS AT RISK AROUND THE WORLD. Sean: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? A FRIEND OF MINE, GREAT DOCTOR, BRAIN SURGEON, TALK ABOUT THIS EARLIER. HE SAID WHAT A JERK. THIS COMES FROM ONE OF THE SMARTEST, BRIGHTEST BRAIN SURGEON THE WORLD. YOU ARE RIGHT. THIS IS ONE SAD CASE OF TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. CHUCKIE, IT'S OKAY TO BE PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY. LIVES WERE SAVED. WHILE SCHUMER IS WHINING, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CONTINUOUS PUSH FOR PEACE ULTIMATELY IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA. TODAY HE MADE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT HE TWEETED: "THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MEETING BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND MYSELF WILL TAKE PLACE IN SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12TH. WE WILL BOTH TRY TO MAKE IT A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT FOR WORLD PEACE!" OF COURSE WE CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. KIM JONG UN IS FRANKLY AND UNTRUSTWORTHY. COME, UNBREAKABLE DESPERATE. GIVEN ALL NORTH KOREA'S CONCESSIONS, WE HAVE REASON TO BE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. THE KOREAN PENINSULA PROGRESSING TOWARDS PEACE. TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ARE RISING, AS WE REPORTED LAST NIGHT, THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES I NOTICED THAT IRAN FIRED OVER A DOZEN MISSILES FROM SYRIA INTO ISRAEL FROM THEIR INSTALLATIONS IN SYRIA. NO CASUALTIES, THANKFULLY, WE REPORTED. THE IRON DOME INTERCEPTED MANY PROJECTILES. HOURS AGO ISRAEL RIGHTFULLY RESPONDING IN A MASSIVE WAY, LAUNCHING A FULL-SCALE AERIAL ATTACK AGAINST IRAN'S FORCES IN SYRIA, AND THEY TOOK OUT DOZENS OF MILITARY SITES, ANTIAIRCRAFT BATTERIES AND REPORTEDLY KILLING DOZENS OF THOSE THAT ARE COMMITTING THESE ACTS OF TERROR. UNLIKE MANY COUNTRIES, ISRAEL CAN NEVER PUT THEIR GUARD DOWN. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY. WHEN IT RAINS ON ISRAEL, THERE WILL BE A FLOOD ON ISRAEL'S ENEMIES. THIS CONFLICT WITH IRAN IS NO DIFFERENT. IN FACT, IRAN'S INVOLVEMENT IN PROXY WARS ALL OVER THE MIDDLE EAST HAS LONG BEEN A THREAT TO THE SECURITY AND THE PEACE OF THE ISRAELI PEOPLE AND OF COURSE AMERICAN TROOPS THAT ARE STATIONED IN SYRIA, IRAQ, AND ELSEWHERE. YOU HAVE THE MULLAHS OF IRAN LONG CHANTING DEATH TO AMERICA, DEATH TO ISRAEL, BURNING OUR FLIGHT, BURNING THEIR FLAG. THEY BACK UP THOSE WORDS BY WHITE, FINDING THE MOST RADICAL TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, SENDING TRAINED FIGHTERS ALL OVER THE MIDDLE EAST TO KILL OUR SOLDIERS IN IRAQ AND OUR ALLY'S SOLDIERS. THIS IS A CHEAP REASON FOR THE CURRENT MILITARY STRIKE IN SYRIA AND LIKELY PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RIGHT DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THAT HORRIFIC IRANIAN DEAL. A FEW MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT WRAPPED UP THE RALLY IN INDIANA. HE SPOKE ABOUT IRAN AND NORTH KOREA AND SO MUCH MORE. TAKE A LOOK. ON JUNE 12, IN SINGAPORE, I WILL BE MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN TO PURSUE A FUTURE OF PEACE AND SECURITY FOR THE WORLD, FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. BUT YOU REMEMBER, EVERYBODY, IN THE FAKE NEWS WHEN THEY WERE SAYING HE'S GOING TO GET US INTO A NUCLEAR WAR! HE'S GOING TO GET US INTO A NUCLEAR WAR. AND YOU KNOW WHAT GETS YOU INTO NUCLEAR WARS AND YOU KNOW WHAT GETS YOU INTO OTHER WARS: WEAKNESS. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY BIG SUCCESS, BUT MY ATTITUDE IS, AND IF IT ISN'T, IT ISN'T, OKAY. IF IT IS THE END, IT ISN'T BUT, AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE WALKING INTO AN IRAN DEAL WHERE THE NEGOTIATORS JOHN KERRY REFUSED TO LEAVE THE TABLE. OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA. PAID 1.8 BILLION FOR HOSTAGES. YOU, NOT ME, YOU. LAST NIGHT YOU SIGHED AND BEGAN ITS LEADING TO SOME VERY BIG THINGS, AND I THINK THAT KIM JONG UN, KIM JONG UN DID A GREAT SERVICE TO HIMSELF, TO HIS COUNTRY BY DOING THIS. BUT THOSE HOSTAGES CAME OUT WITH RESPECT. WE DIDN'T PAY FOR THEM. WE'RE GOING TO SET THE TABLE. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT DEAL FOR THE WORLD FOR NORTH KOREA, FOR SOUTH KOREA, FOR JAPAN, FOR CHINA. Sean: TOUTING THE KEY TO VELTMAN'S ON THE WORLD STAGE, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE IS BACKING THEM UP RIGHT HERE AT HOME. DURING THE INTERVIEW EARLIER TODAY, THE VICE PRESIDENT TOLD ABC THAT IT'S TIME FOR MUELLER'S WITCH HUNT, AND I AGREE COMPLETELY, TO COME TO AN END. TAKE A LOOK. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN FULLY COOPERATING WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. DO YOU THINK THE INVESTIGATION IS A HOAX? WE WILL CONTINUE TO. WHAT I THINK IS THAT IT'S BEEN ABOUT A YEAR SINCE THIS INVESTIGATION BEGAN. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED OVER A MILLION DOCUMENTS. WE FULLY COOPERATED AND IT IN THE INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY, I THINK IT'S TIME TO WRAP IT UP. Sean: TIME TO WRAP IT UP, I AGREE. MEANWHILE ACCORDING TO SOME STELLAR REPORTING, GET FROM OUR OWN SARA CARTER, WE KNOW THAT THE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY, THE ONE ROD ROSENSTEIN'S HAD TO FIRE, HE CONSULTED WITH TEAM MUELLER BEFORE GIVING ANY TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS ABOUT ITS INQUIRY INTO RUSSIA. CAN ANYONE SAY COLLUSION OR COLLABORATION, INAPPROPRIATE? JUDICIAL WATCH HAS ACQUIRED THE EMAILS THAT SHOW COORDINATION IN THESE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL AND THE DISGRACED FORMER FBI DIRECTOR. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU HAVE DEEP STATE NEWS HERE. REMEMBER LAST NIGHT WHEN WE REPORTED THE MEETING BETWEEN ROD ROSENSTEIN, INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIR DEVIN NUNES, AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN TREY GOWDY. THAT MEETING WAS CLASSIFIED BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS THE DOJ'S ONGOING STONEWALLING, SLOW WALKING OF DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBPOENAED BY CONGRESS. OH, THEN THEY GIVE THE PHONY REDACTION. OH, AND THEY'D DELAY DELAY, DELAY. THEN THEY SAY NO. ACCORDING TO A BRAND-NEW ARTICLE FROM SARA CARTER, THIS COULD BE JUST AN EFFORT TO BUY TIME FOR SESSIONS AND ROSENSTEIN. WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS LATER IN THE SHOW. THIS STUFF IS NOT FUN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. THE CONSTITUTION GIVES CONGRESS THAT OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY. MAKE NO MISTAKE. WE ON THIS PROGRAM, WILL HOLD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS, WROTE ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND ANYONE ELSE ACTIVELY OBSTRUCTING CONSTITUTIONAL RATIONAL OVERSIGHT TO CONROE. WE HAVE NEW DEVELOPMENTS SURROUNDING THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP PICK TO HEAD THE CIA. HER NAME, YOU SEE RIGHT THERE, AN AMAZING APPEARANCE BEFORE CONGRESS. GINA HASPEL. DEMOCRATS ARE OPPOSING HER BECAUSE THEY THINK THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION PROGRAM SHE OVERSAW WAS TOO TOUGH ON TERRORISTS LIKE KHALID SHEIKH MOHAMMED. THE GUY THAT WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND 9/11. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY, HE'S NOT BUYING IT. HE IS DEAD ON ACCURATE. EARLIER TODAY, HE CAME OUT SWINGING. GOOD FOR THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT. WATCH THIS. WHAT WE DID WAS IN FACT AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR FUNDAMENTAL STATUTES. IT WORKED. I THINK WHAT WE DID HELPED ULTIMATELY PRODUCE THE INTELLIGENCE WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO GET BIN LADEN. IF IT WERE MY CALL, I WOULD NOT DISCONTINUE THOSE PROGRAMS. I WOULD HAVE THEM ACTIVE AND READY TO GO. YOU TELL ME THAT THE ONLY METHOD WE HAVE THIS PLEASE, PLEASE, PRETTY PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW. I DON'T BUY THAT. I THINK THE TECHNIQUES WE USE WERE NOT TORTURED. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND TRY TO REWRITE HISTORY. IF IT WERE MY CALL, IT WOULD DO IT AGAIN. Sean: OF COURSE HE VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY IS RIGHT. INTERROGATION OF KHALID SHEIKH MOHAMMED, IT LED TO THE COURIER. THAT CAREER LETTUCE WHERE USAMA BIN LADEN WAS. IT'S TIME FOR DEMOCRATIC SENATORS TO PUT THE SAFETY OF YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AHEAD OF THEIR PERSONAL HATRED OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE NEED TO CONFIRM PEOPLE, HEROES LIKE GINA HASPEL, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WITHOUT A DOUBT, SHE'S AN AMERICAN HERO. SHE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO LEAD THE CIA. BY THE WAY, CLAIRE McCASKILL, WHERE ARE YOU? HEIDI HEITKAMP, WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS? WE NEED A STRONG CIA. ONE THAT DOES NOT USE THE
