so to give a little mobility in the spine we're gonna do a seated cat-cow where you can grab ahold of the bottom of your seat and then pull your chest open drop your shoulders away from your ears arching your spine and then drop your chin pull your belly in towards your spine and round your lower back and come up into an art opening the chest dropping the head back if it feels alright and then drawing the ABS and rounding the spine doing that a few times to where it feels comfortable for your spine and just get a little bit more opening and stretch for your back next to be able to to get a nice glute stretch in your performance and hips opening through your backside you're gonna bring your ankle up to your knee sit up nice and tall pressing the knee down away from you you can bring your hand to your ankle and then keeping your body tall your spine long slightly lean your body forward and you'll feel a stretch through the hip and glute area sit here for about 30 seconds and then after that you can switch to the other side bring the ankle up press that knee down or don't forget to lengthen up your spine keeping the spine long as you lean forward so we're gonna try some chair squats now you're gonna start with your feet just wider than your hips you're gonna sit back to tap your butt to the chair lift the arms and come up and engage your glutes draw your abs in sit back hinging at the hips come up and engage the glutes and if you feel like this might look a little funny in the office maybe you guys all need to have a squat right let's try for 10 reps here and then I'm the last one you can hover hold and then come all the way back up
