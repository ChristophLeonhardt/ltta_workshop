LINDSEY GRAW
>>> WE ARE BACK WITH SENATOR
LINDSEY GRAHAM.
YOU SAID IF I BECOME COMMITTEE
LEAD YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS.
>> MOST LIBERAL MEDIA OUTLETS
BELIEVE THIS IS A NOTABLE CAUSE.
THAT I WON'T GIVE MUCH THOUSAND
E-MAILS THOSE WHO TRY TO TAKE
KAVANAUGH DOWN.
THIS CAN BE PLAID OUT OVERTIME
AND DESTROY THE ABILITY TO GET
GOOD PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD.
I'LL FIND OUT WHAT STAFFER
RECOMMENDED CATS TO BE FORDS
LAWYER.
WHY THEY DIDN'T TELL HER ABOUT
THE ALLEGATION AND IF SHE NEEDED
A LAWYER.
SHE WAS URGED BY DEMOCRATIC
SENATORS TO GIVE AN INTERVIEW.
IF THEY BELIEVE SHE HAD
SOMETHING SERIOUS TO SAY THEY
SHOULD HAVE SENT IT TO THE
COMMITTEE AND NOT THE MEDIA.
I'LL FIND OUT WHO LEAKED THE
LETTER PROVIDED BY COREY
GARDINER AND PUNISH THEM.
WE CAN'T LET THOSE PEOPLE WHO
BETRAYED DR.  FORD'S TRUST GET
AWAY WITH IT.
>>Reporter: SHOULD WE TRUST
THE FBI HERE?
AFTER ALL WE --
>> YES.
>> AND PUT THEIR FINGER ON THE
SCALE.
WHAT'S YOUR TRUSTWORTHINESS OF
THE FBI AND WILL IT TAKE A WEEK?
>> IT SHOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS.
THE TRUST LEVEL IS HIGH.
MY BEEF HAS NEVER BEEN WITH THE
FBI BUT MCCABE AND A FEW BAD
APPLES.
I LOVE THE FBI.
PROFESSIONAL AGENTS THAT DO
BACKGROUND CHECKS.
THEY WILL TALK TO THOSE DR.
FORD NAMED.
THEY WILL TAKE TO MS. RAMIREZ
WHO WE FUSED TO TALK TO THE
COMMITTEE.
THAT WILL BE IT.
I TRUST THEY WILL DO A FAIR
BACKGROUND CHECK AND EVERYBODY
WHO IS LISTENING, WE WON'T LET
THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS.
IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL NO ONE
WILL COME FORWARD.
IT'S OFOUS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING
TO DO.
THEY ARE TRYING TO DELAY
KAVANAUGH.
>> REALLY QUICK BEFORE YOU GO,
SENATOR, WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT?
>> A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER
OR NOT ROSENSTEIN WAS PART OF A
KOUE TO TAKE HIM DOWN.
I WOULDN'T FIRE HIM UNLESS THERE
IS REAL CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT
HE DID SOMETHING IMPROPER.
>> IF THE HOUSE FLIPS WE WON'T
HEAR ABOUT THAT STORY ANY
LONGER.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> IF I HAD DONE WHAT DEMOCRATS
HAD DONE.
IF I RECOMMENDED A CONSERVATIVE
ACTIVIST LAWYER.
IF I HID IT AND DIDN'T TELL THE
THE DOUBLE ASKED AND
THE DOUBLARASKED AND
