now to the face-to-face meeting between US and North Korean leaders that at least as of 1 p.m. March 9th is expected to take place in two months time a lot of palace intrigue about how this whole thing came to be who even knew about it where it's going to happen and frankly just about everything else we'll get to those details later this hour right now though the reaction even to the idea of talks can best be described as mixed summits in order for them to succeed have to be well prepared and this one was hastily agreed if the result of this meeting is not verifiable concrete steps to denuclearization it will be a failure it's very risky very unorthodox I'm worried that Kim jong-un is setting us in a trap but I support the president the other thing that might be happening is he's luring us into these negotiations but then he will make demands that he knows we can ever agree to that amount is a senior fellow in Korea expert at the Federation of American scientists which studies threats to national security Adam where do you stand on the spectrum of what we just heard their great idea or a huge gamble that poses a tremendous risk and can ultimately be a diplomatic disaster well every day North Korea is not testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is a step that we're not is a day that we're not sliding towards war so this opportunity is really too big to waste and that's why it's absolutely critical that the Trump administration does not rush this they take it slowly prepare it with staff work and we have a limited leverage here we really don't have the ability to give away anything for free so we need to be prepared it can't be rushed and we need to approach this methodically it sounds it sounds like you're skeptical that that two months is going to be enough time to marshal all the resources needed to do this thing properly is that an accurate assessment I am where is it held what's the agenda do we have time to coordinate with our allies we really don't have any many cards to play here and one was a presidential summit would have liked to have seen the North Koreans make more progress before we play this card and put it on the table for example why didn't we condition the summit on release of the three remaining American prisoners in the in the North Korean gulag it's hard for a president to meet with with the North Korean dictator without that having happened if talks are going to succeed we need to maximize the little leverage that we have to be clear this this is not the first time that the North Korean regime has extended an invitation to the president of the United States to sit down for talks what's different this time around well what's different this time is that the North Koreans have advanced their programs remarkably they have much more capable missiles the program is dispersed more throughout the country the price is higher now than it was ever before and so that increases the need to prepare for this methodically we need to have an agenda set because if Trump feels embarrassed if he feels like he's being outmaneuvered and talks collapse that put us puts us right back on the risk of war which is higher in this administration than in ever any before it the idea that the President of the United States and the president of North Korea would even sit down face-to-face is is this proof that the sanctions have worked I think the sanctions have added some leverage here I think a lot of the credit goes to the South Korean president moon jae-in who's been extremely deft about shuttling between a reticent American ally and North Korea which showed unexpected flexibility they've been wonderful about opening this this opportunity for talks and now it's up for the US delegation to put together an expert set of officials make sure that we have the staff in place that have done these kinds of negotiations before they're prepared to negotiate jointly with our allies and to really drive a hard bargain Victor Chavez nomination is ambassador to South Korea was withdrawn as as you know Joseph you in the States top envoy to North Korea just recently announced his retirement who is going to be informing the president's decision who's going to be coaching president Trump as he gets ready for this this face to face summit again assuming that it happens this is administrate and administration that does not have a very deep Bentsen foreign policy they don't have experience with these kinds of international negotiations this isn't something that Jared Kushner can do out of the back of his car so they really do need to staff up ensure we're doing this coordination work you know negotiations with North Korea are all about phases you move step by step if they make a material progress towards limiting their nuclear and missile programs they get a cookie each step needs to be verifiable each step needs to be mutually acceptable and each step needs to aim at the next step so you don't lose momentum that's that very heavy lift it's hard to do in two months Adam when you when you have the presidents of two countries who've never met face to face when you have them sit down for a meeting like this and it feels where do you go after that what would that mean for diplomacy moving forward that's a real risk and so the United States needs to be prepared for setbacks they need to be able to roll with the punches Donald Trump despite his best assertions does not have a reputation for being a very tough negotiator his positions veer all over the map we've seen when he talks to Democrats in the United States that he's manipulation of all so when he gets off the plane the North Koreans are gonna try to take a bite out of him he can't get embarrassed her offended he's got to remain committed to talks don't give away anything for free but also don't dump the board and allow them to collapse Adam mountain George your perspective and your insight sir thank you enjoy the
