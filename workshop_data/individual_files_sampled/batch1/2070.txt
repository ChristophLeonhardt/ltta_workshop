because each time you give lichens that new dish that's another sticky moment that may reside in memory for longer my name is Professor Charles Mintz I'm head of a cross modal research to Oxford University and author of the book just out gastro physics the new science of eating I think about a going to a fancy restaurant that experience might last two hours three maybe four but then it's kind of gone it's all over so more and more other top chefs but also of the food chains now saying okay if memory of food is so important how do you make sure to create the right memories in our customers mind and that's not simply about delivering the best taste at the moment not just about that but about creating a sticky memories that will stay with people weeks months or years later so how do you do that in practice there are a couple of groups in one thing is to surprise the diner with a little emotion something you weren't expecting and there's kind of surprising freaks will stick in memory more than things that they were expecting you might also switch from a traditional three-course menu to a tasting menu with lots of small plates of food with each time you invite into that new dish that's another sticky moment that may reside in memory or longer leave analyze what what what many top restaurants and I'm doing we sort of have this feeling that maybe is surfaced when you're starting to shine on the starters and the main course is a nice and it never quite as good as the very first manifold and again is implicitly building on the idea that we remember the most startling experience the end of the experience on the stuff in the middle kind of plays away almost as soon as we put on like a pork down
