congressman Republican Blake Farenthold has resigned after ongoing scandals related to sexual harassment gender-based discrimination concerns about whether he had repaid a huge amount of taxpayer money something like eighty-four eighty-five thousand dollars had gone towards his defense in those matters was going to hold on until the end of his current term and then slink off into the woods but he decided abruptly that he was in fact leaving and he gave a statement I'm not going to read the whole thing because he doesn't merit it but the end says while I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress I know in my heart it's time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve but I will save him some time your service will not be required anymore you can just go away actually we know what I loved here is that in December when this first broke the statement that he gave was I had no idea how to run a congressional office not the problem here is that clearly you just didn't know how to interact with the opposite sex it's not about whether or not you know how to run a congressional office you're not supposed to tell people you have sexual fantasies wet dreams about them unsolicited especially if there's somebody who you work with in a professional capacity it seems like he still doesn't get ya that in a non congressional office you're also not allowed to talk about lips okay especially for your subordinates or anyone just don't do it but and he's such a sleazy politician he he said all $84,000 I that I made taxpayers pay for my sexual harassment problems oh I will pay that back later they're like wait but you didn't he's like well maybe later and he still hasn't now he's resigning he still hasn't been in back so just I want to be cleared the why is it happening today because he said he was gonna just go through the investigation at the Congressional level and then he would make a decision obviously investigation didn't go well okay the conclusions were going to be really bad Republicans don't retire unless it's disastrous news and that is the news he was about to receive otherwise he would have gone to the end of his term and then quietly could have stepped down him saying all of a sudden I gotta go now means it was really really bad now Amy you actually had a someone in your race the incumbent that also stepped out right well he didn't step down but he's decided not to run again so he has said he will not run in the race then at the last minute he was putting it feelers out there that I possibly might run again yeah and then he held all of us waiting there was local Nevada papers and political commentators that were talking about is he or isn't he but it's the same thing anyone this is just a drop in the bucket of the money that's paid by taxpayers for many of our current legislators and it's something that definitely needs to be addressed we have other things we could be spending the money on besides defending people who don't know how to be professional yeah indeed perhaps the worst expenditure of taxpayer money even worse than some of the stuff that Scott Pro was up to yeah one final thing I want to say about this is that hearing this story obviously this is itself this is a good thing but I actually the topic I find to be reminded a little bit depressing because you know back in the mid to late last year we were moving into the me2 movement and the dominoes were starting to fall and entertainment and in business in some respects and we we were talking on the show about how this has to come to DC because of the amount of corruption and entitlement and the culture there and two days later after we had that discussion some congresswoman and Senators started talking about their experiences both themselves being discriminated against and harassed in a incredibly routine and casual manner about interns and and employees being harassed by a number of different offices and then very little actually came of it attempts to implement new rules have been have been barred or put into bills and then yanked at the last minute Al Franken went down and blank Farenthold and that's about it and I don't think anyone believes that that's the extent of the problem in DC yeah well that's what you have to keep the pressure on though right unfortunately you got to keep the momentum going otherwise we're gonna have a big fuss talks about reform and then nothing actually happens and I think most people myself included I had no I how corrupt the congressional system was for anybody who might want to try to report you know any kind of sexual harassment and I know the people were outraged but my parents who I never agree with politically we're outraged that's where their taxpayer dollars were going to and then now it's just kind of been forgotten about so anybody who's like oh we've had enough me too you know it's it's too much it's too much and part of the everyday conversation it's not enough until you see actual change if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart
