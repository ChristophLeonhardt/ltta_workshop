Google is planning to launch a certain version hello I'm Richard gisbert and you're at the listening post here are some of the media stories that were covering this week Google search for new markets leads it to China despite Beijing's rules on censorship is the company doing the right thing CNN names names the weapons manufacturers whose bombs are killing children in Yemen Palestinian journalists and citizens have learned that incitement is in the eye of the beholder the occupier and we have another one of those videos that casts a political leader as an action hero with a little help from his friend the stunt man type Google into Google's search engine then hit the news tab you might find a few stories that the tech giant would rather you didn't see a few weeks back we learned that Google was working on something called Project dragonfly a new search engine for the Chinese market one that would function in compliance with Beijing s strict rules on censorship in an organization that talks up transparency it is ironic that only a handful of the company's 88,000 employees knew about this project when some of them caught wind of it they leaked the details to an online news site the intercept which broke the story and put Google's top brass on the spot Google has ventured into China before in 2010 but back then it decided it could not live with the censorship rules there so it pulled out this potential re-entry into China signals a major policy u-turn involving one of the biggest tech companies on the planet and the world's largest market our starting point this week is Google's headquarters Silicon Valley USA times change technology moves on companies evolve there was a time when Google's corporate mantra was don't be evil that altruistic philosophy has since been amended watered down if you will to do the right thing was that a mere shift in semantics or has Google made a moral adjustment in the way it does business with China just being the latest most newsworthy example of that Google is celebrating its 20th birthday in that time we have folded it into our lives in some really deep ways Google is by far the dominant search service on mobile devices and on computers in the world it's very interesting when we look at how Google deals with China because that is one place where it won't be dominant and one place where it really has to pander to the demands of the government there but I think it's something Google has to do Google can't ignore China to ignore China is to ignore the world in China increasingly nowadays doing the right thing is is about trading off to lesser evils when I speak to Chinese friends actually many of them are hopeful that they can use Google in China because they would like that be an alternative to the near monopolist which is Baidu it would be really interesting scene if there are two big search engines in China duking it out rather than one big search engine in China Google has had a foothold in China before operating there from 2006 to 2010 often coming into conflict with government censors then after getting cyber attacked and discovering that the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists had been hacked it reevaluated its policy a company whose stated mission is to organize the world's information effectively pulled the plug on itself in China walking away from the world's biggest internet market eight years later Google wants back in and it knows that President Xi Jinping's government will only permit that if Google builds in search filters that meet the censorship rules so that if anyone in China enters a term like human rights democracy or political opposition Google's search engine would come up blank so it's like a 180-degree reversal and what they said in 2010 and so it's quite a stunning turnaround that they would suddenly change because in China nothing is changed in fact it's probably got worse in terms of the censorship the laws that are in place that oversee these things have become a lot more draconian and that your period so to say it's going to go back in is an extraordinary story and that's why this had a lot of attention internationally the legitimate concern is that people have that if Google goes into China that it's legitimizing China's censorship regime that's up to people's interpretation of what a role of a corporation ought to be Google is out to make money and so given that there are many shareholders that want to see Google's stock price go up clearly it's in their very right to pursue when the largest markets in the world this story only became public because someone inside Google wanted it that way and leaked the details of project dragonfly to the intercept an online news site it's since been extensively reported elsewhere but Google is not commenting publicly it's not the first time this year the company has dealt with internal dissent on a large scale three months ago thousands of employees signed the petition protesting against something called Project maven work that Google was doing to help the US military analyze drone French Google later announced it would not renew its contract with the Pentagon first maven now dragonfly Google which deals and information is finding that it cannot keep its own corporate secrets contained the company has a thousand employees so less than 0.35 percent or something like that of the overall workforce actually knew about this and once we've reported it of course the rest of the employees then found out and a lot of them were very angry not just because of the censorship issue which it's controversial on its own but because it was kept secret from them a huge issue and say Google is the secrecy it's a really interesting moment in Silicon Valley because when companies like Google admit that they are pursuing controversial projects like building a search engine in China or when companies like Microsoft reveal that they've been working with the Department of Homeland Security on projects that might involve you know the separation of families the labor force in Silicon Valley rise up in protest and demand better behavior from their companies so we've seen it quite vocally at Microsoft we've heard rumblings of it at Facebook and now we're starting to see it at Google they should have accountability but because they can hide behind the corporate veil there are different sets of rules and norms that are expected of corporations if citizens are concerned about corporations becoming too powerful and becoming like nation-states then they should actually be asking the lawmakers to pass laws that require certain corporations above a certain revenue line to have a different way of responding to public inquiries should Google succeed in getting back into China it stands to gain access to more than three quarters of a billion people online but the company's competition there is way out front in Google's eight-year absence by a Chinese search engine has solidified its position and now has more than 75% of that market and old habits even relating to relatively young technology die hard so even if Google manages to clear the political hurdles currently standing in its way it will have a lot of catching up to do everyone at Google knows that if this is successful it will be both politically controversial and a long slow process to try to build back reputation in China web users in China have established their habits long ago and their habits do not include Google at this point so I see this as an effort to establish at least a small presence in China in the hopes that it might grow over time look we have to realize that it's almost malpractice for a business that has global ambitions to ignore the largest market in the world you can see many tech companies knocking at the door of China's huge revenues but this does not mean that China wants it under President Xi Jinping internet censorship has gotten even tighter so any kind of censorship deal that Google can strike with the government now would be much worse than back in 2010 and this is the real bind that operating in China puts on such companies how much can you criticize government whose permission you need to operate in their markets we're discussing another story that's on our radar this week with one of our producers Johanna who's Joe in Yemen bombs continued to claim civilian lives dozens more were killed there this past Thursday and CNN recently produced a report that was a little bit different in that it looked into a couple of angles on the bombing of Yemen that don't get much coverage what did that report actually examine CNN was reporting on that airstrike on August 9th by the saudi-led coalition the one that hit a school bus killing 40 children the piece was different in two ways first CNN senior international correspondent Nima al Bakir reported that the bomb had been supplied by the US government as part of an arms deal with Saudi Arabia second there was this graphic revealing the names of US weapons manufacturers companies like Lockheed Martin Raytheon and General Dynamics whose arms have been used in various air strikes in the past that graphic went viral and many of the tweets mentioned how rarely the media reports on the role played by the US and even the UK in selling weapons to Riyadh the u.s. also helps with the targeting of those weapons I spoke with Alba Gare about the piece we have actually consistently referred to the saudi-led coalition as US backed so this isn't a new element that's come into our reporting it was important to talk about the bomb and who made that one especially because we knew that the specific technology that was used the laser-guided technology that was used in this particular strike was technology that President Obama had banned the sales of because of human rights concerns and that that ban was then overturned by President Trump so we knew that this was a really important element and it was one that it was incredibly important to get out there to our audience as they worked through how they felt about the war in Yemen still it's only one piece albeit an informative one on a story that doesn't get nearly the news coverage that it deserves considering that the UN has declared Yemen the world's worst Unitarian crisis definitely not this war and not just the UK and US involvement in it has been extremely under Amnesty International calls it the Forgotten war over gear spoke to me about some of the factors that make reporting on Yemen so difficult I think often what people presume to be a disinterest on the brooder parts of the media exactly actually just an inability to get on the ground we are trying in different ways we are learning as we go along as are other people in the media landscape how are we going to report on this war that is in place and a conflict that oftentimes people don't really have a great deal of knowledge on but also that is incredibly difficult to get access to and and I think we are we're trying our best to figure it out as we go along and it's important to note that access to the war front and Yemen isn't just being limited by the saudi-led forces but also the Houthi led government that has been very hostile to the media okay thanks Joe turning now to Palestinian journalists and activists and the twin inescapable realities of surveillance and censorship since 2015 the authorities in Israel have arrested an estimated 1000 Palestinians for content they published or shared online Israel even has a dedicated cybercrimes policing unit with the cooperation of tech giants like Facebook the state has successfully taken down hundreds of Palestinian social media accounts and Israel strategy in this area goes well beyond censorship the state has developed algorithms that monitor Palestinians in anticipation of them committing a crime silenced and surveilled by Israel on one side Palestinians are also having to contend with the Palestinian Authority the PA on the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza neither of which is known for tolerating dissent or criticism online in the West Bank in particular the piays 2017 cyber crimes law has led to the arrests of numerous Palestinians the listening-posts Tarek NAFA now from the occupied West Bank this past week a leader Ali became the latest Palestinian journalist to be charged with incitement the Palestine TV correspondent is known for his live broadcasts of life under occupation the Israeli military reportedly took issue with videos he shared of soldiers in a refugee camp near Ramallah none of Ali's posts call for violence but both the military prosecutor and the judge referred to the size of Ali's audience the number of followers he has and the likes he gets and it's not just journalist fifteen-year-old Hamada Abu Levin was arrested for writing the words forgive me on Facebook her alleged crime incitement in any manner Tamizh crime was live-streaming her daughter's now infamous confrontation with two soldiers in her front yard she was charged with and then convicted of incitement just a few examples and there are hundreds of a charged Palestinian say has been used to criminalize criticism of the occupation in the general assumption nowadays is that all Palestinian social media users are under Israeli surveillance they developed algorithms which monitor social media for certain keywords and later began using a profiling method known as predictive policing anything you say can be seen as incitement the poet parent Atul was just imprisoned for saying resist my people resist so the word resistance is forbidden as our phrase is like I'm against occupation or I will resist occupation it's all considered incitement there are very sophisticated methods of online surveillance with these algorithms that have been to the technology that is being used it targets everyone anyone exercising the right to free speech you what you are seeing is a violation of the presumption of innocence people are not presumed innocent they are presumed guilty from the start Israel does not hesitate one it wants to silence its critics whether Arabs or Jews to invert the security argument give me total aviation share TiVo neatly multiple gaming machine esata any criticism of Israeli policies is full of Israeli point of view is threatening to state security in 2016 Israel's Minister of Justice Ayelet shaked boasted that Facebook complied with 95 percent of government requests to remove infighting content a new face the bill and the works would give the government the power to make that 100 percent the Ministry told The Listening Post that in citement cases are examined regardless of the nationality or origin of the suspect but there seem to be double standards at play shaked herself once wrote a Facebook post that appeared to justify the mass murder of Palestinians who give birth to little snakes she was not charged with incitement and in 2017 the NGO handler found that Israeli social media users wrote an inciting post against Palestinians once every 71 seconds however prosecutions of Israelis for incitement are extremely rare censorship and monitoring are not the only ways Israel controls Palestinians online it also operates social media accounts that target Palestinians with propaganda in their own which a practice known of the military vation or infiltration of the palestinian cyberspace you have pages like the coordinator and israeli general who publishes information that mainly targets palestinians and sometimes makes threats like we will enter this area in gaza to occupy it again or pages like bitten and aged we want to live which has a photo of dollars luring people to work with them then there are secret accounts like that of captain Hossam an israeli intelligence officer who writes to people and asks if they need help getting a work permit in other words they play with palestinian emotions as well as their need for money to get them to work for them after a summer in which Israeli snipers killed more than 150 people in Gaza including two journalists and were even caught celebrating some of those killings the Israeli government announced plans for legislation that would outlaw filming Israeli soldiers for quote the sake of shaming them then there are the more traditional methods of controlling information this month the Israeli military arrested six journalists for incitement in a single week at least 23 journalists are currently imprisoned and 17 media institutions were shut down by the Israeli military last year but navigating is real system of control is only part of the challenge too often Palestinian journalists have come to expect the same kinds of intimidation surveillance and monitoring at the hands of their own government in the occupied West Bank the Palestinian Authority seen by many Palestinians as an enabler an enforcer of Israel's occupation the PA seems to have known a thing or two from the Israelis what doable Aquarion II would offer it'd be the most commonly deployed charge is incitement one doesn't want to draw a parallel but often those who've experienced Israeli prisons have also experienced PA prisons it's as if there's a certain type of journalist who must be denied a voice the surveillance of what we write on Facebook has become so extensive so sophisticated that I believe we will get to the point where it will include the political and social views of journalists - Amalia taking the lead from countries like the United Arab Emirates the Palestinian Authority has adopted a cyber crimes law that has had a chilling effect on free speech in the occupied West Bank it was conceived almost overnight with no public consultation and then passed by presidential decree in its first year the law was used in a way that violates human rights and democracy at least 30 palestinian websites have been banned for either criticizing the Palestinian Authority or for having alliances with Hamas or Mohammed Allen the law has been amended but is still nowhere near perfect the point is they're using various laws in a selective way to limit opposition voices we're seeing that it's used in an abusive manner it is not used to tackle online crime it's used to restrict opposition and anyone addressing points that are not supported by the Palestinian Authority so we're still calling for a repeal of that law or an amendment of it that would be in line with international standards Verna's Gaza which is under the control of Hamas and where free speech is also heavily restricted security forces there have used harassment interrogations and arbitrary arrests to silence online criticism but what seems to differentiate the PA if the frequency with which it pursues journalists who are also being sought by the Israeli military one such voice is Lama kata a writer were the large online following known for her criticism of the occupation and the PA she was arrested by Israeli forces in Hebron last month not long after her family had been harassed by the PA mallamma hotter in April I spoke to Lamar hata the Palestinian preventive security forces had detained her husband she told me they asked him why don't you stop your wife from writing on your man and he replied I am a man and agree with what my wife writes given the ever-present threat of surveillance and arrest by Israel plus the threats coming from their own leadership Palestinians are increasingly cautious about what they say online a study by Palestinian NGO meda found that 90% of journalists practice self-censorship are to fear for their own safety for people to know that they are being surveilled all the time whether they are aware of it or not create a fear on the part of the population fear leads to an annoying leads to feeling that their life is totally monitored is totally controlled in integer within what about all of our journalistic outlet is monitored and analyzed we feel as if we've somehow become like that TV program Big Brother everyone is watching Israel is watching me the PA is watching there is censorship but Palestinian journalists can navigate as ever narrowing the margin of freedom because the moment the journalist goes silent there is nothing left and finally the 18th Asian Games are well underway in the Indonesian capital Jakarta a television channel there sctv produced a video to mark the opening of the games featuring Indonesia's president Joko Widodo beating a traffic jam to get to the stadium on a motorcycle stunts included lame comparisons were reflexively made on line to Tom Cruise in the latest Mission Impossible film which was mission accomplished for sctv and its action hero president and a hashtag was born proud to be Indonesia fine except whoever made that film should have picked a stuntman who better resembled the president in shape someone in the same weight class perhaps and given that stuntman a wedding ring to match the one that would dodo wears that's what the continuity departments for the little things we'll see you next time here at The Listening Post you have cancer gentlemen please the President of the Republic of yeah his mr. doe
