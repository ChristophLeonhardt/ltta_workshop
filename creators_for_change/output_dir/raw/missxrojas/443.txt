16
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,210
Poughkeepsie is about two hours by train

up the Hudson River from New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City</font>

it's gorgeous especially on a sunny<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

19
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,930
but also an autumn and winter when it's

any newcomers driving back to campus we

34
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,260
spotted this lovely billboard that

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,909
reminds us that<font color="#E5E5E5"> judgement day was</font>

extremely cute fluffy animals slightly

41
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,869
scary at night and a bit weird when he

42
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,490
first approached them this one was
