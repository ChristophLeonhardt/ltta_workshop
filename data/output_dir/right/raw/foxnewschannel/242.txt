NUMBER ONE ATOP

LIST.

5
00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:14,226
TUCKER CARLSON'S "SHIP OF FOOLS:

00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:14,926
HOW A SELFISH RULING CLASS IS

UNSEATING BOB WOODWARD'S "FEAR."

10
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,033
THE ELITES AND THE WORKING

11
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:23,602
CLASSES FROM DIFFERENT

12
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:24,035
PERSPECTIVES.

13
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:26,571
ALSO TONIGHT, COLUMNIST LOOKING

14
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:27,773
AT THE DIVISIVENESS IN AMERICA,

15
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:29,608
AND COMING UP WITH THIS

16
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:30,642
CONCLUSION.

17
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:32,644
"IN THE ELITE LEVEL, IT APPEARS

18
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:33,845
POLITICS IS RULED BY DIVISION.

19
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:35,247
BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

20
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:36,414
COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED

21
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:38,383
ON LOCAL ISSUES, MANY AMERICANS

22
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:39,484
STILL FEEL UNIFIED."

23
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:42,120
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR

24
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:43,822
OF THE BEST SELLER,

25
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,824
"SHIP OF FOOLS," THINGS OF THAT.

26
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,292
>> Tucker: SHANNON BREAM,

27
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:47,859
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

28
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,360
GREAT TO BE HERE.

29
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,829
>> Shannon: THIS IS A REALLY

30
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,329
INTERESTING PIECE.

31
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,931
I WANT TO READ A LITTLE BIT MORE

32
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:54,733
OF IT BECAUSE SHE TALKS TO A

33
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,802
LOCAL WOMAN RUNNING FOR OFFICE,

34
00:00:56,803 --> 00:00:57,836
POLITICS DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM.

35
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:58,703
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY

36
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:00,038
CAN HELP EACH OTHER AND

37
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,640
TAILGATING AT THE NEXT FOOTBALL

38
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:02,040
GAME.

39
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,642
SHE SAID UNLIKE WASHINGTON, WE

40
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,243
ARE ALL JUST A FEW NOTCHES FROM

41
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:07,045
EACH OTHER IN EITHER DIRECTION.

42
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:08,580
MUCH MORE THAT DRAWS US TOGETHER

43
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:09,915
THEN DIVIDES US.

44
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,050
THE REAL DIVISION IS BETWEEN THE

45
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,451
ELITES AND US.

46
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,453
NOT NECESSARILY REPUBLICAN AND

47
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:16,021
DEMOCRATS.

48
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:17,722
>> Tucker: THAT'S THE THESIS

49
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:18,156
OF MY BOOK.

50
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:19,791
HOW REFRESHING TO HEAR OF A

51
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,426
PLACE WHERE POLITICS IS NOT THE

52
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:22,627
CENTRAL QUESTION.

53
00:01:22,628 --> 00:01:23,595
I'VE COVERED POLITICS ALMOST MY

54
00:01:23,596 --> 00:01:24,329
WHOLE LIFE.

55
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,931
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING, I

56
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:26,598
GUESS.

57
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,632
IF POLITICS IS THE MOST

58
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:28,600
IMPORTANT THING IN YOUR SOCIETY,

59
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:30,902
YOUR SOCIETY IS BROKEN AND KIND

60
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:31,503
OF FALLING APART.

61
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:34,806
YOU WANT A PLACE WHERE POLITICS

62
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:36,241
DOESN'T MATTER TO DO THINGS THAT

63
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:36,575
MATTER.

64
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:38,710
FINDING A SPOUSE, A GOOD CHURCH,

65
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:39,845
BUILDING A BUSINESS, OR

66
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:40,812
WHATEVER.

67
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:41,313
THE REAL THINGS.

68
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,982
THAT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE.

69
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:45,417
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH HER

70
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:45,851
ANALYSIS.

71
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,819
IT'S NOT EVEN IDEOLOGICAL, IS

72
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,221
MOSTLY ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL.

73
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:50,088
IF YOU ARE RICHER THAN YOU WERE

74
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:52,791
BEFORE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF

75
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,259
2008, YOU PROBABLY LIVE HERE IN

76
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,427
NEW YORK AND L.A., YOU'RE FROM A

77
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:56,461
CERTAIN WORLD.

78
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:58,230
IF YOU'RE NOT, THE REST OF THE

79
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,431
COUNTRY, YOU SEE THINGS VERY

80
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:00,565
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

81
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:01,266
BENEFITING FROM WHAT WE ARE

82
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:01,733
DOING RIGHT NOW.

83
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:04,436
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

84
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:05,604
>> Shannon: I GREW OUT IN WHAT

85
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:08,039
I LIKE TO CALL "REAL AMERICA."

86
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,340
I LOVE WHEN I GET HOME BECAUSE

87
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:10,575
PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON

88
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,644
THE WORLD.

89
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:14,012
IT'S VERY REFRESHING.

90
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,815
>> Tucker: I DREW UP LA JOLLA

91
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:18,083
CALIFORNIA AND GEORGETOWN.

92
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,051
ABOUT AS FAR FROM A REAL AMERICA

93
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,620
AS YOU CAN GET.

94
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:22,354
I'M NOT CLAIMING TO REPRESENT

95
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,022
THE GREAT OUT THERE, BUT I KNOW

96
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:25,423
THE WORLD I'M WRITING ABOUT VERY

97
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:26,825
WELL BECAUSE I'VE LIVED IN IT MY

98
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:27,292
WHOLE LIFE.

99
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,227
A LOT OF REALLY NICE PEOPLE.

100
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:30,262
GREAT PEOPLE IN D.C.

101
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:31,897
BUT THERE IS A VERY SPECIFIC SET

102
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,131
OF ATTITUDES THAT COME FROM

103
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:36,001
HAVING AN ECONOMY THAT'S BASED

104
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:36,801
ON TAX REVENUE.

105
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:38,637
THERE IS NO BUSINESS CYCLE HERE.

106
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:39,604
WE ARE ALWAYS RICH.

107
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:41,406
WE ARE THE RICHEST CITY IN

108
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:42,440
AMERICA, THE RICHEST METRO AREA.

109
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:44,442
YOU GET A CERTAIN KIND OF

110
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:45,443
ATTITUDE.

111
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:46,378
A CORROSIVE ATTITUDE.

112
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,113
CONTEMPTUOUS OF EVERYONE ELSE.

113
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:49,814
>> Shannon: I WANT TO ASK YOU

114
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:50,482
ABOUT A COUPLE OF CURRENT

115
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:51,016
EVENTS.

116
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:51,750
WE HAVE NEWS TODAY THAT A

117
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,886
PROFESSOR AT UNC HAS NOMINATED

118
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,422
DR. CHRISTINE BLASE FOR WITH THE

119
00:02:57,423 --> 00:02:58,858
DISTINGUISHED ALUMNI

120
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:01,526
AWARD WHICH IS ABOUT MAKING AN

121
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:04,429
OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO

122
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,330
HUMANITY AND ANY WALK OF LIFE.

123
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:08,566
PART OF THE LETTER SAID THIS

124
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:12,003
LETTER IS NOT ABOUT PARTISAN

125
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:13,405
POLITICS, IT IS ABOUT

126
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,372
RECOGNIZING THAT THE SIMPLE ACT

127
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,674
OF SPEAKING ONCE A TRUTH IS AN

128
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:16,141
ACT OF BRAVERY.

129
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:19,210
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

130
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,145
>> Tucker: IT'S ANOTHER

131
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:24,182
REMINDER THAT THE ENTIRE HIGHER

132
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,817
EDUCATION, THE HUMANITIES, NOT

133
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:26,785
NECESSARILY ENGINEERING AND

134
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,787
SCIENCE, IS TOTALLY CORRUPT AND

135
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:30,188
BLOATED AND POINTLESS AND

136
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,223
ACTUALLY HURTING THE COUNTRY.

137
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,326
THAT PROFESSOR, THAT'S A VERY

138
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:35,660
MEDIOCRE -- NONIMPRESSIVE THING

139
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,228
TO SAY BECAUSE IT SO

140
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:38,697
TRANSPARENTLY FALSE IS BEING

141
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:39,698
SUPPORTED INDIRECTLY BY TAX

142
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,533
DOLLARS AND RELIEVE THE SAVINGS

143
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,101
OF EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS

144
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:43,601
COUNTRY.

145
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,837
SO, IF YOU TAKE YOUR COUNTRY

146
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:47,038
SERIOUSLY, YOU WANT YOUR

147
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,606
CHILDREN TO BE EDUCATED

148
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:49,441
SERIOUSLY BY SERIOUS PEOPLE

149
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,076
RIGOROUSLY, AND INSTEAD YOU ARE

150
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,911
GETTING POP LIKE THAT, IT'S KIND

151
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:53,445
OF SCARY.

152
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:54,112
>> Shannon: IF YOU READ THE

153
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:55,447
WHOLE LETTER, SHE TALKS ABOUT

154
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:56,715
THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE

155
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,116
AFRAID TO COME FORWARD AND SHARE

156
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:58,917
THEIR STORIES BUT NOW THEY CAN

157
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:01,252
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ENABLED

158
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:01,653
BY DR. FORD.

159
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:04,222
>> Tucker: THAT'S GREAT BUT

160
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,224
THIS IS AN ACT OF PARTISAN

161
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:06,624
POLITICS.

162
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,226
I GET THAT IT'S TOTALLY FINE,

163
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:09,361
SOME PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH MY

164
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:09,728
OPINIONS.

165
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,463
BUT YOU CAN'T GROW UP TO THE

166
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:14,399
ENTIRE SYSTEM, THE EDUCATION

167
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,600
SYSTEM, COLLEGE AND THE HIGHER

168
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,035
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND MAKE IT

169
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:17,769
WHOLLY POLITICAL, WHICH IS WHAT

170
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,403
THEY'VE DONE.

171
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:20,304
YOU TALK TO ANY PARENT, THAT'S

172
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,974
LIKE THE ONE EXPENSE THEY'RE

173
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:23,708
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT.

174
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,844
THEY'RE SAVING, NOT GOING ON

175
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:26,511
VACATION, SKIPPING THE CAR,

176
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:27,746
WE'VE GOT TO PAY FOR COLLEGE,

177
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:30,982
THEN IT WINDS UP IN THE HANDS OF

178
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:31,950
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TOTAL CONTEMPT

179
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:33,618
FOR THE PEOPLE PAYING THE BILLS.

180
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:34,519
IT'S A BAD.

181
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
>> Shannon: YOU DON'T THINK

182
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,922
PROFESSORS ARE REPUBLICAN?

183
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:38,323
I'M ASKING.

184
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:40,792
>> Tucker: [LAUGHS]

185
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,994
IF SHE WAS MAKING A SMART,

186
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:44,062
INTERESTING, FREETHINKING

187
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:46,398
ARGUMENT I DISAGREED WITH, A

188
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,232
RADICAL MARXIST TRYING TO

189
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,200
EXPLAIN TO ME THE DIALECTIC OF

190
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,436
CAPITALISM, I WOULD BE MORE

191
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:52,804
IMPRESSED BY THAT.

192
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:53,405
IT'S DUMB.

193
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:54,406
>> Shannon: SPEAKING OF

194
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,874
DEBATES OVER CAPITALISM, A WOMAN

195
00:04:55,875 --> 00:05:00,678
WHO WILL SOON BE A MEMBER OF

196
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:04,115
CONGRESS, THIS IS WHAT SHE SAYS

197
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:07,719
ABOUT THE CAVANAUGH FALLOUT AND

198
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,687
WHAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE WORKING

199
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,022
ON NOW.

200
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:13,925
>> WE TAKE BACK THE HOUSE, THE

201
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:16,594
SENATE, THE PRESIDENCY, AND THE

202
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:17,128
SUPREME COURT OF THE

203
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,064
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

204
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:22,167
>> Shannon: AS YOU KNOW, THIS

205
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:26,204
DID NOT GO WELL.

206
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:28,106
>> Tucker: HE WAS VERY

207
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:29,407
FRUSTRATED WITH THE CONFERENCE,

208
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:29,941
ALL PRESIDENTS ARE.

209
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:32,510
THEY ARE NOT DOING WHAT I WANT

210
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:33,011
THEM TO DO!

211
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:35,080
THAT ENDED BADLY BECAUSE IT WAS

212
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,414
A CLEAR AUTHORITARIAN POWER

213
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:36,714
GRAB.

214
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,216
SO MUCH BETTER TO MAKE YOUR

215
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:38,516
CASE.

216
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:39,984
YOU'VE GOT A SET OF IDEAS YOU

217
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,319
THINK WORK, TELL US WHAT THEY

218
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,586
ARE.

219
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:44,189
CONVINCE US.

220
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,623
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL CHANGE, I

221
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:47,025
THINK IT WILL, BUT DEMOCRATS

222
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,726
HAVE FOR NOW GIVEN UP ON THAT.

223
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,395
THE IDEA IS THEY ARE GOING TO

224
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:51,596
SEIZE POWER AND MAKE YOU OBEY,

225
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:52,897
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU

226
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:54,232
AGREE BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO

227
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,834
FORCE YOU TO OBEY.

228
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:57,035
THAT SCARES PEOPLE, EVEN

229
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:57,635
DEMOCRATS.

230
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:59,070
WHY DON'T YOU WIN ME OVER

231
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:02,207
INSTEAD OF USING FORCE?

232
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,007
[LAUGHS]

233
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,409
TAKE BACK THE SUPREME COURT?

234
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,276
COME ON!

235
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,578
>> Shannon: YOU DON'T LIKE THE

236
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,011
SOUND OF THAT?

237
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:10,048
AMERICA, LET US KNOW WHAT YOU

238
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:10,348
THINK.

239
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,217
>> Tucker: UNHAPPY AS TALK

240
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:12,584
SHOW HOST.

241
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:13,318
>> Shannon: CONGRATULATIONS ON

242
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,820
THE BOOK, IT IS DOING FANTASTIC.

243
00:06:15,821 --> 00:00:00,000
SPARKING SUCH AN INTERESTING
