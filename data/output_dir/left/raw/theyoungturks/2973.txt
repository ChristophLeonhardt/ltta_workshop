1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,570
>> THANKS TO THE TAX BILL
PASSING DONALD TRUMP IS

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,069
INCREDIBLY PROUD WITH HIMSELF
EVEN FOR DONALD TRUMP.

3
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:09,000
BUT NOT AS PROUD AS MIKE PENCE.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,250
I WANT YOU TO PREPARE YOURSELF
THIS IS SOME EPIC ASS KISSING.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,150
>> IN THE FUTURE WE ASK IN THE
NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SON, AND

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,710
THE HOLY SPIRIT.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,780
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,909
MIKE,
WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS?

AS I
TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT AND SHORTLY

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,370
AFTER THE SENATE VOTE.

WE ARE REBUILDING
OUR MILITARY, PUTTING THE SAFETY

AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE FIRST, YOU HAVE RESTORED

AMERICAN CREDIBILITY ON THE
WORLD STAGE, WE ARE STANDING

00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,679
WITH HER ALLIES TO OUR ENEMIES.

24
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:12,079
BUT YOU PROMISED ECONOMIC

25
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,799
RENEWAL AT HOME.

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,939
YOU SAID WE
COULD MAKE THIS ECONOMY GREAT

27
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,560
AGAIN AND YOU PROMISE TO

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,840
ROLLBACK 単 YOU SIGNED MORE BILLS
OF ROLLING BACK RED TAPE THAN

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,420
ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,810
YOU HAVE UNLEASED

31
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,790
AMERICAN ENERGY, YOU'VE SPURRED
OPTIMISM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,299
SETTING RECORDS BUT YOU PROMISED
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT YOU

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,240
WOULD DELIVER HISTORIC TAX CUTS.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,539
IT WOULD BE A MIDDLE-CLASS

35
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,929
MIRACLE.

36
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:50,259
THAT PROMISE WILL BE
FULFILLED AND I AM DEEPLY

37
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:53,750
HUMBLED AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT
TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE BECAUSE OF

YOU GOT THE CONGRESS TO

46
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,510
DO WITH TAX CUTS FOR WORKING
FAMILIES AND AMERICAN BUSINESSES

47
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,260
WHAT THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO

48
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,260
AND YOU GOT

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,239
CONGRESS TO DO WHAT THEY COULD

>>I APPRECIATE THAT.

66
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:36,129
>> I FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS A
NEW WORD CALLED SCROMITING,

67
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,610
SCREAMING WHILE VOMITING.

68
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:45,629
NOW I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

69
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:54,019
>> PENCE IS THE GENUS BECAUSE
THAT IS THE ONLY THING HE WANTS,

70
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,709
FOR YOU TO VERBALLY STROKE HIS
EGO FOR 10 MINUTES.

71
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:11,499
>> THAT WAS ONE OF THE GROSS
ACTS OF A POLITICIAN IN THE LONG

72
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:14,599
TIME.

73
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,548
IF THE PRESIDENT WAS EVER
TO STEP DOWN FOR SOME REASON OR

74
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:24,000
WAS FORCED OUT OF OFFENSE MY
PANTS CAN TURN AROUND AND SAY

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,530
TRUMP BASE OR MEMBER HOW MUCH I

76
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:44,380
WAS UP YOUR PRESIDENTS ASS, I

77
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:54,289
AM ON YOUR SIDE.

78
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:55,830
AND SO MIKE

79
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,030
PENCE IS A TOTALLY TWO-FACED

80
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,180
POLITICIAN, ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

81
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,919
I
LIKE HOW HE SAID I WILL END

82
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:08,070
WHERE I BEGAN, ON MY KNEES
PRETTY MUCH.

83
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,070
LESS TWO THINGS, HE

84
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,520
SAID YOU GOT THEM TO DO IT AS IF
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE

85
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
TAX CUTS TO THE RICH.

86
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,060
THEY WERE DYING TO DO THAT.

87
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
>>OR

88
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,540
SOME OTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT
WOULD'VE VETOED THE TAX BILL.

89
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,789
WHAT DID HE DO TO GET THIS DONE?

90
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,569
>>NOTHING.

91
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:31,110
THEY WANTED TO DRILL
IN AN WAR AND GIVE TAX CUTS TO

92
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,280
THE RICH AND REPEAL THE MANDATE
単 CONGRATULATIONS MR.

93
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
PRES.

94
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,850
YOU GOT THEM TO DO EXACTLY
WHAT THEY WANTED.

95
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,100
>>THANKS TO YOU THE SUN ROSE AND
FELL, THE MOON CONTINUED ITS

96
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,949
PATH THROUGH THE NIGHT SKY

97
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,389
BECAUSE OF YOU DEAR LEADER.

98
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,910
BUT
PENCE PROVED THAT ALL OF THIS

99
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:58,539
WAS AN EFFORT TO KISS ASS WHEN
HE MENTIONED ONE NAME 単 IVANKA

100
00:05:58,539 --> 00:05:59,550
TRUMP.

101
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,150
SHE HAD NOTHING ON TOP OF
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TAX CUTS.

102
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,479
NO ONE EVEN CLAIMED, NOT TRUMP
OR IVANKA THAT SHE HAD ANYTHING

103
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,580
TO DO WITH THE TAX BILL.

104
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,710
WHEN HE
GOT TO IVANKA TRUMP BECAUSE HE

105
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,389
KNOWS DONALD TRUMP, THAT'S THE
ONLY PERSON HE HAS ANY CHANCE OF

106
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,300
LOVING OUTSIDE OF HIMSELF, HIS

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,360
DAUGHTER.

108
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,590
HIS NARCISSISM IS SO
STRONG BUT IT BARELY HAS AN

109
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,490
INTERSECTING CIRCLE WITH IVANKA

110
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,490
TRUMP.

111
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,800
AND HE WAS LIKE YOUR
DAUGHTER WAS GREAT, IVANKA

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
TRUMP.

113
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,259
AND TRUMP WAS LIKE YES.

114
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,780
>>IT WAS SUSPICIOUS, WHEN HE
THREW AND THAT TIFFANY WAS

115
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,310
WORTHLESS THAT WAS EGREGIOUS.

116
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:54,090
>>I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MIKE
PENCE FOR WHAT WILL NOW SEEM IN

117
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:00,690
THE DICTIONARY OF WHAT IT MEANS
TO SCROMIT.

118
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,680
WE ARE WAY OUT OF

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,090
TIME AND BY THE WAY ANYBODY, IF
YOU GET ANY WORD OF MIKE PENCE

120
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,879
EXITING DONALD TRUMP ANUS, LET

121
00:07:10,879 --> 00:00:00,000
US KNOW, TWEET US.
