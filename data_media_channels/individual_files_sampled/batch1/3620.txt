what do i do first throw your leg over okay all right easy enough yeah and it's just best technology so if you lean forward it goes forward lean forward a little bit put your feet up on the foot pegs yeah just like that and the steering is more with the feet then with the handle it's kind of both once you stand up okay there you go so it's like a boogie board left to right right you can kind of feel where the bike wants to go with your feet yeah you're doing good yeah so where did this idea come from for this one wheeled vehicle you know it came from my daughter she saw it in a video game and I just started working on it it's been like seven years a lot of prototypes a lot of discovery a lot of innovation and so who is this made for who do you want to sell it to well it actually turns out there's a lot of different categories it Maps into it's a utilitarian product for industrial security there's a lot of early adopters that love it for taking down to the beach and and then there's this whole urban transportation space where you can take it on the train and you can go on the sidewalk and the bike lane and it just transitions really well and the idea is that it's small enough that it uh then it goes in a lot of spaces exactly and electric it's electric and it's very approachable people aren't afraid of it you put your feet down you're at eye level with people so give me the specs it's ten miles an hour and about 10 to 12 mile range recharges in six hours placeable batteries right where do you see the Rhino five or ten years down the road we're hoping to scale this bike into every single geographic area across the globe and the way it's cracking right now we're gonna get there
