1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:02,167
NEWSPAPER.

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,936
AT LEAST FIVE DEAD AND SEVERAL

3
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:05,603
INJURED.

4
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:16,748
SHOT AND KILLED AND SEVERAL MORE

5
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:17,649
INJURED AT AN NEWSPAPER IN AN

6
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:23,288
SOME OF IT CONFUSING.

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,456
WE ALSO EXPECT AN UPDATE FROM

8
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,357
POLICE AND THE NEXT FEW MINUTES

9
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,692
AND WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE LIVE

10
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:29,260
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

11
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,830
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:32,430
TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,264
THERE WAS AN IDEOLOGICAL

14
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:40,805
THAT MEMBERS OF THE PROGRESSIVE

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,444
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING

16
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:47,245
IMMIGRATION LAWS.

17
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,880
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS SEEM

18
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,281
EMBARRASSED BY IT.

19
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:51,483
NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER

20
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,284
OPPOSE THE IDEA AS DID MANY

21
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:53,685
OTHERS.

22
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,687
THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED.

23
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:59,324
TWO DAYS AGO A SELF-DESCRIBED

24
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,859
SOCIALIST CALLED ALEXANDRIA

25
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:07,866
SHE RAN ON ABOLISHING I.C.E.

26
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,502
SUDDENLY IN DAYS, ABOLISHING

27
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,102
I.C.E. IS SOMETHING MANY

28
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:12,670
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY ARE FOUR.

29
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:13,471
MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE

30
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,272
APPROACHING SO IT'S TIME FOR THE

31
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,708
REST OF US TO TAKE THIS IDEA

32
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,475
SERIOUSLY.

33
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:19,811
WHAT EXACTLY WOULD HAPPEN IF THE

34
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:20,545
LEFT KILLED I.C.E.?

35
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:23,481
HERE ARE SOME OF THE FACTS ABOUT

36
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:26,985
I.C.E. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL

37
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,457
LAST YEAR THEY ARRESTED 32,958

38
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,258
IMMIGRANTS WITH CRIMINAL

39
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,259
RECORDS.

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,926
ALMOST 5,000 OF THOSE WERE

41
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:37,862
MEMBERS OF VIOLENT GANGS.

42
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:38,797
WITHOUT I.C.E., ALL THOSE

43
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,732
CRIMINALS WOULD STILL BE AT

44
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,667
LARGE WITHIN OUR BORDERS.

45
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:45,270
LAST YEAR I.C.E. ALSO SEIZED

46
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,671
2,370 POUNDS OF FAT KNOWN, THE

47
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,640
NARCOTIC THAT IS DRIVING THE

48
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,641
SINGLE DEADLIEST DRUG CRISIS IN

49
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,243
THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY.

50
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:53,912
THAT'S ENOUGH FENTANYL TO KILL

51
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,652
WITHOUT I.C.E. THAT WOULD STILL

52
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:01,653
BE IN CIRCULATION.

53
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,855
THEY ARE ALSO THE BODY

54
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:04,622
RESPONSIBLE FOR DEPORTING ANYONE

55
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:06,624
ILLEGALLY INSIDE THE

56
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,301
WITH IT.

57
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,335
WITHOUT I.C.E., CRIMINAL ALIENS

58
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:19,504
COULD SEE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH

59
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,306
IMPUNITY INCLUDING GANG MEMBERS,

60
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,107
CHILD MOLESTERS, DRUG SMUGGLERS

61
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:25,410
AND CONVICTED MURDERERS.

62
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,278
THEY COULD NOT BE DEPORTED.

63
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,414
COMPANIES COULD BRING IN AN

64
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,884
FOR AMERICAN WORKERS EVEN MORE

65
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:33,651
THAN IT ALREADY HAS.

66
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:36,187
THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER, BUT

67
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,489
THAT'S THE POINT.

68
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,523
THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST I.C.E. IS A

69
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:40,625
CAMPAIGN FOR HONEST COMIC OPEN

70
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,360
BORDERS AND SOME ARE HONEST

71
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:44,662
ENOUGH TO ADMIT THAT.

72
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:48,633
ACTIVISTS HAVE CHANTED THIS, NO

73
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:50,668
BORDERS, DONATIONS, STOP THE

74
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:51,102
DEPORTATIONS.

75
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,470
NO BORDERS, NO NATIONS.

76
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:55,440
ONE LEADS TO THE OTHERS, ALWAYS.

77
00:02:55,441 --> 00:03:01,112
WITHOUT BORDERS, NATIONS ARE IN

78
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:01,446
TROUBLE.

79
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,281
IF THEY PASSED THE LAW TOMORROW,

80
00:03:03,282 --> 00:00:00,000
WOULD YOUR HOUSE STILL BE YOUR
