culture war already I just think that it hadn't been brought to sort of the fore so we'll talk about that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Birch gold so there's a lot of

precious metals with Birch gold okay so president Trump looks like he's beginning to win big on the NFL what I mean is that a lot of teams are now backing down and this is why I really think it had less to do with President Trump purposefully picking a smart fight and much more to do with the left's knee-jerk reaction to everything Trump says and then going over the top no matter what Trump says so to recapitulate what exactly happened here for those who have been in sleep indicated for the last couple of weeks President Trump said that Colin Kaepernick was an sob and that owners should fire players who kneel on the sidelines for the national anthem now if you or I said that we're private citizens the President of the United States is the President of the United States governmental actors should not be telling private actors how to do their business it's just bad policy it is not good for the country if the shoe were on the other foot and Barack Obama were telling people on the right that they should be fired by their left-leaning employers we would be justifiably angry okay but what Trump wasn't wrong about is that it's nasty to Neal for the national anthem it is nasty to Neal for the national anthem in 2017 okay we're not talking about in 1961 in the middle of Jim Crow even then the the smartest civil rights leaders people like Martin Luther King knew that the smart thing to do would be to and the right thing to do would be to claim the mantle of the of the national anthem and the star-spangled banner rather than ripping on it and trying to divide the country along those lines today in 2017 there really is no excuse for kneeling for the national anthem if you have problems of the specific police department then protest that police department if you have a problem with a specific police officer protests that police officer but to suggest that America is through-and-through a racist sexist bigoted homophobic country like that is that is guilty as a whole for the sins of a few is is really it's really quite nasty and it imputes nasty intent to everybody who's standing for the national anthem because if they cared enough they'd kneel to okay so that's where Trump was right where Trump right is when he says that it's nasty to kneel from the national anthem disrespectful to the flag disrespectful to people who have fought and died to protect that flag and stand for that national anthem there he is right but he did what he does and he went too far and I think is that a strategy is that by accident I would say it's more by accident because Trump has never seen a moderate comment I Trump intact parted ways long ago if ever they have met so he says what he says and the left because they're really done they decide that instead of reacting by saying listen we may agree about the national anthem but everybody has a right to express themselves the way they want to and we don't think people should be fired for doing that in the NFL and then standing up for the national anthem while some people kneel that would been the smart thing to do instead what they did is they started to kneel and they allowed Trump to polarize this debate so now instead of this being sort of a a messy debate where some people were against kneeling but against Trump and some people were for Trump but for Trump and against kneeling instead of that what you had was instead this is this weird situation where everyone who was against kneeling was against Trump oh sorry everyone who was for kneeling was against Trump and everyone who was against kneeling was for Trump Trump placed himself squarely on the side of the flag in the anthem and his opposition was politically stupid enough to allow him to create that dichotomy by kneeling with the people who are kneeling so now it looked like all the people who are on Trump's side like the flag in like the anthem and all the people who weren't on Trump side hate the flag and hate the anthem when half the protest was actually about Trump not about the anthem at all really really dumb of left and now it's beginning to pay dividends for Trump because Trump stayed on this issue he realized this was a popular issue he realized that most Americans don't like people kneeling he realized that if he could grab the mantle of the flag in the national anthem then he would end up winning that debate because people like the flag in the national anthem more than they like the people who are kneeling and if the last election proved nothing it should have proved that we are all binary thinkers or at least a huge number of Americans or binary thinkers we can't think in three dimensions since that means that instead of thinking about two issues at once censorship of people who kneel and the actual kneeling we just boil it down to the actual kneeling and the left was again dumb enough to fall for this so so bryant gumbel over on HBO the left thought that they had won this debate which is an amazing thing if there are bunch of people I'm left hanging on Trump made a big boo-boo here I've been saying since the big this Trump did not make a big boo-boo what I think Trump did was not great for the country because I think there was a broad consensus 85% of Americans don't like kneeling and a similar number of people are fine with with people not being fired for kneeling right so there's a pretty broad consensus Trump split that consensus I don't think it's good to split that consensus because I agree with both halves of that hole but the left immediately jumped into bed with the Colin Kaepernick crowd and here's Brian Gumbel saying that he thinks that great the athletes are all energized now now for sure they're gonna win this battle really dumb stuff from Brian Gumbel over on HBO finally tonight a quick thanks to the current occupant of the White House for energizing the social conscience of the modern American athlete that occupants weekend series of racist cherish and childish comments drew a variety of stunning rebukes and actions which suggest jocks may finally be realizing that apathy won't cut it anymore that in conjunction with their fame they have important civic roles to play especially now not just willing but also eager to follow in the giant footsteps of Muhammad Ali Jim Brown Bill Russell Billie Jean King Roberto Clemente Arthur Ashe and many others who courageously used their athletic platforms to challenge authority in the pursuit of justice okay let me stop for a second so first of all I think that it's important to note that a lot of the people who we now Heil as you know heroes in this in this area I'm thinking specifically hear of Muhammad Ali where at the time not seen that way and there's a bit of a heavy golden gloss that's being put on Muhammad Ali's history I mean at the time he was deeply associated with the radical racist Nation of Islam and under under under primo Farrakhan Elijah Muhammad and the idea that he was doing some sort of great service to the country Muhammad Ali at the time I really disagree with that pretty strongly in fact many Americans disagreed with it which is why when he had his first fight with Joe Frazier a lot of Americans were on the side of Joe Frazier Muhammad Ali helped exacerbate racial divides Joe Frazier was a guy who grew up poor in Philadelphia Muhammad Ali grew up middle class in Louisiana as Cassius Clay and Joe Frazier was somebody who didn't agree with the idea that you were supposed to stand against the American flag or that you weren't that you were supposed to protest the American government or that America was a deeply terrible place much more unifying figure than Ali Ali proceeded to call Frazier a gorilla and in use really racist terminology with regard to Joe Frazier in order to in order to push basically the Nation of Islam's message so now he's hailed some sort of civil rights hero but at the time and certainly was not and a lot of the stuff he did was really really negative there's actually a great HBO documentary on this called ghost of Manila that you should go check out if you haven't seen it it's also a book that it's really worth reading on this but beyond that if Brian Gumbel thinks that the sports world is going to win by continuing to politicize itself in ways that are really not well thought out or well calibrated that athletes doing simplistic things like kneeling for the national anthem is somehow great for the country this is a battle that Brian Gumbel and those and those athletes are not going to win and I'm frankly confused as to why they think they would most Americans don't believe that this is a racist country or should be castigated as such most Americans also believe that if you can name a specific racist incident and will fight it with you but he's not the only one so there's a Titans at Tennessee Titans tight-end named Delanie Walker who according to The Tennessean said first off I'm going to say this we're not disrespecting the military the men and women that served in the Army that's not what this is about if you look at most of the guys in here I've been in the USO I support the troops this is not about that it's about equal rights and that's all everyone is trying to show is that we all care about each other and the fans that don't want to come to the game I mean okay bye could you possibly be dumber I mean why are why in the world would you want to alienate your fan base they are paying your salary what we've seen over the past couple of years is people not watching ESPN I think in large measure because it has become politicized people not watching the NFL as much for a couple of reasons first of all the the worries about concussions second of all of domestic violence stuff and then also yes the politicization of the NFL I used to watch a lot more NFL I don't like watching the NFL as much anymore because I don't need Bob Costas lecturing me on gun control and I don't need a bunch of st. Louis Rams players perpetuating the lie that hands up don't shoot was a real thing in Ferguson which they did a couple of years ago and were not punished by the NFL you see this from people in the NBA to the 76ers their first-round draft pick is gonna in Ben Simmons he's supposed to be a very good player and he comes out and he starts ripping Trump by name and play that in just a second and suggest that this is not smart strategy and you will see that Trump is going to this particular battle which is a big win for Trump we'll talk about whether it's win for the right and a win for the culture because I think it's not quite as easy as some people want to make it out to be but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over the u.s. concealed-carry Association so someone breaks into your house somebody somebody is at the front door and they shatter the window on your front door they reach in they pull the latch you rush out with your gun the person is try and get in your house in the middle of the night you shoot them you think that's the end of the story you did a great job right you did something good self defense defensive home and others defend defends himself and others defending your property the police will come and they may arrest you and that's why you need to talk to my friends over at the u.s. concealed carry Association right now they're happy to give you for free when you go to defend my family now calm the 20:17 concealed carry and family defense guide it is from the US concealed carry Association again it's a hundred percent free you will learn how to detect attackers before they see you how to survive a mass shooting the safest and most dangerous places to sit in a restaurant how to responsibly own and store a gun particularly if you have kids and a whole lot more it's 164 pages income and comes with a bonus audio version so after you're done with our podcast today you can go and listen to that this life changing guide is a hundred percent free for a limited time you'll also get a bonus home defense checklist so go to defend my family now calm let's defend my family now calm and get the resources that you need in order to ensure that you are that you are protected in case you god forbid have to use your gun I mean the reason to own a gun is that you don't have to use it if God forbid II have to use it you need help for my friends at the u.s. CCA defend my family now calm okay so again polarizing along trumpian lines usually wouldn't be a problem for athletes polarizing along trumpian lines when Trump is standing with the flag and what the Army is really not a good idea for these athletes so here is here is Ben Simmons who is seventy sixers forward I believe talking about how much he hates Trump if we were in Australia right now a lot of people would call me that's how I personally feel okay well that that's convenience I mean again this is this elevating the the discourse no and listen I don't think anyone has an obligation to elevate the discourse but again if you're gonna polarize the audience this is probably the best way to do it so here's the problem now the left has staked out a position the position they staked out last Sunday was it's good to Neil or it's good to boycott the anthem or as a slap against Trump we're gonna do all of these things and then the fans say wait whatever you think about Trump what are you doing with the anthem what are you doing with the flag like these are the only unifying symbols we have left we disagree about everything we disagree about politics we disagree about culture we disagree about the the usefulness of the pause pod we disagree about all these things but what we don't disagree about is the flag is a good thing in the national anthem is a good thing so what are you doing and so now the NFL has basically been forced to back down the way that they're backing down is that they are standing and linking arms for the national anthem this is this is their sort of subtle way of backing down I said that on Sunday what they should have done if they wanted to show solidarity is the people who are going to kneel should have been the exact same people kneeling six months ago and everybody else on the field should have stood next to the people who are kneeling you're showing solidarity if I sit by being next to the person right what's the what's the big deal like why is this why elevate the issue what's the point of elevating the issue in any case these players last night this is the bears-packers game they were standing and linking arms for the national anthem and and this is a basically is a back down rights back down people aren't kneeling anymore ladies and gentlemen to honor America please stand remove your hats and join country recording artist artist Tyler Farr as he sings our National Anthem you see last week the dogs right and no problem everybody's standing not a problem but it looks like a back down because once you stake out a position in politics if you back off the position it looks like the other guy won and it's not just the Packers and the Bears this is basically the new policy there's a guy named Marquis Pouncy he is a is he a linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers he's a center he's the center for the Pittsburgh Steelers and one of the longest tenured players on their roster he came out yesterday and he said I promise you this week we are all gonna stand for the anthem I promise you one thing this week we'll all be standing out there for the national anthem trust me we respect our flag and we're splittin military and everything that goes a part of the men on I think the bigger message that people were just trying to stay out of it you know and that we should have you know just United inside and everyone was in there you know standing up and it was all about the flag and you know it's a big misunderstanding I'm too trusting out I'm very sorry to anyone that probably feels the way that they do and you know rightfully so but you know there's a lot of arguments and then points but I care about the flag dearly and they trust me on this team right it's it's it basically they're saying it was a big mistake so that looks like a win for Trump the the Denver Broncos put out this message on their social media yesterday they put out this long message says last week members of our team joined their brothers around the NFL in a powerful display of unity it was an emotional time for everyone including the fans who support us each and every week as controversial as it appeared we needed to show our collective strength and resolve our voices needed to be heard loud and clear make no mistakes our actions we're in no way a protest of the military the flag of those who keep us safe which is why if you thought that then you shouldn't picked that example it guys image matters you're in an image driven business for goodness sake okay it's not like you sell shoes for a living all right you're actually in a business where you are on TV all the time anyone in the TV industry knows that what's on the TV is the image that people are consuming they say we have nothing but the deepest love and respect for those who protect our way of life and the freedoms we enjoy as Americans while there's no greater country it's not perfect inequality still exists and we all have work to do in all forms in social of social justice which is their sort of stop to to black s'matter and then and then they say we can all do better it starts with us and then they say we are a team and we stand together no matter how divisive some comments and issues can be nothing should ever get in the way of that okay well as a country we're supposed to stand together not just a team as a country we're supposed to stand together which is why people care about this issue in the first place but again it now looks like all these players who note last week will not be kneeling this week what prompted the change people are going to say Trump did right so big win for Trump big win for Trump the NBA's he Adam silver he came out he said he now expects the players to stand as coach Popovich said the other day people need to engage and have these discussions and they're not always easy discussions to have sometimes they are painful discussions but they need to be had and I'm hoping once again that this league can play a constructive role there on you know the anthem in specifically we have a rule that requires our players to stand for the anthem it's been our rule as long as I've been involved with the league and my expectation is that our our players will continue to stand for the anthem okay so nothing actually changed in the NBA and this is the important thing to note it looks like the NBA is backing down because some of the players were really loud about this stuff but nothing actually changed I mean in 1996 there was a guy named Mahmoud Abdul Rauf he was a guard for I believe it was the at the time was he done the Golden State Warriors or the Denver Nuggets he's I'm Denver Nuggets at the time and he refused to stand for the national anthem instead he decided that he viewed the American flag is a symbol of oppression and racism and he said that standing for the anthem anthem would conflict with his Muslim faith he said you can't be forgotten for oppression it's clear in the Quran Islam is the only way I don't criticize those who stand so don't criticize me for sitting so the NBA suspended him for a game and they cited a rule that the players had to line up in a dignified Pat posture it cost him about 32 grand the Players Union supported him and he reached a compromise with the league that allowed him to stand and pray with his head down during the anthem and that was the end of it that was the end of it you know he his career basically tanked after that because he lost his entire fan base but that was basically the end of that so the idea that this battle started just last week is not really true or the idea the NBA switched its position on this is not really true but impression left in the minds of the public is that all these people were going to kneel Trump stepped in they're no longer kneeling good for Trump so big political victory for Trump now is it a big political victory for the right well on the one hand a victory for Trump against people who are kneeling is sort of a victory for the right except that more Americans thought that Colin Kaepernick was doing a dumb thing before Trump intervened then after he intervened if you look at the polls again there was like eighty-five percent of Americans thought that Colin Kaepernick was doing the wrong thing now it's about 60% of Americans 65 percent of Americans that's not actually a victory for the right right it's actually a loss for the right if I would have told you that let's let's say that Trump weren't president let's say that Hillary had god forbid been elected president and let's say that Hillary had made comments talking about how wonderful it was to kneel for the anthem and the number of Americans who thought it was bad to kneel for the anthem dropped from 85 percent to 60 percent who said that's a terrible thing 25% more Americans now are okay with kneeling for the anthem that's a really bad thing well 25 percent of Americans are now okay with kneeling for the anthem that's not a great thing even though Trump wins a political victory by looking like a strong guy and it's not really great for the country and this was my objection in the first place again a lot of people on the right saying oh we're winning the culture war we're winning the culture war so in the one sense I think the right is winning the culture war by demonstrating that the left is willing to be this radical that is a win for the right okay that's a win for the right if the left is willing to side with Colin Kaepernick just to oppose Trump it demonstrates how radical they are if the left is willing to kneel for the anthem to to buck against Trump that demonstrates the radicalism of the left but for for America's unity for the cause of standing for the anthem it actually was not a huge win so it's a little bit more complex than just saying Trump wins everybody else loses we're done here I don't think it's quite that simple now I want to talk about what else this means in terms of the Republican agenda stalling because well Trump is fighting these culture war battles that really get the base jazzed up and get people excited because the truth is as I've said before people are much more interested in talking about cultural issues than in tax cuts are the Republicans even going to be able to do anything and what is the divide inside the Republican Party what does it even mean what what like it's confusing because you hear the term establishment and then you see people who are clearly not establishment being called establishment and people who are working with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer being called establishment what are these terms even mean anymore Rush Limbaugh was on Sean Hannity last night two guys who I've been very friendly with and you know people I grew up listening to and they were talking about Trump versus sort of the Republican Congress we'll get to that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at DaVinci so

meeting.com slash Ben really this is it's a great service and yesterday's service was really tremendous I mean it was like being at home when we were on the road really amazing ok so well Trump is engaged in these culture wars which is the stuff that animates elections let's let's be frank about this what Republicans do on tax cuts is gonna be much less significant for the 2020 election than this NFL stuff sorry that's just the way it works that's why Donald Trump can go from a guy who was commenting on Twitter about birtherism four years ago to the President of the United States culture wars matter a lot more than the political battles but what does that mean for the political battle in some ways it means that it's harder to get people on the same page because all you have to do is virtue signal in the culture wars and then we don't actually have to pass anything so there are some pretty significant and fundamental differences inside the Republican Party and it's it's always interesting to watch people like like Shawn and Rush both of whom have been strongly supportive of President Trump talk about what the Republican Congress is doing to buck Trump instead of suggesting that everyone has a duty to get on the same page the idea is that if the Republicans would just follow Trump he would lead them to the promised land I don't think that this is exactly correct I don't see them embracing strong ideas and going and selling them which I think they'd win on the I don't think they're conservative I don't think they ever have been they don't want Trump to succeed with his agenda they can't afford that I'm not I'm not exaggerating here if they don't want they can't afford for him to succeed with his agenda they can't afford it the lids blown the gig is over the joke is revealed if an outsider with no prior political experience can come in and fix messes that people have been promised would be fixed for 30 years how does that make them look they can't allow that bang okay so the rush is actually making a slightly different point he's not making the point about conservatism he's making a point that there are all these career politicians who haven't been doing anything if Trump comes in and fixes thing he makes them look bad I don't think that that's actually what's going on here I don't think there are a lot of career politicians who are sitting around going you know what if I for Trump I look better today how many Republicans feel like if they thwart Trump on things they want past that that is actually gonna make them look better in the eyes of their own constituents their constituents voted for Trump their constituents voted for Trump if they look like they're actively thwarting Trump they get ousted I mean hell if they look like the they even signal did not liking Trump they get ousted right mo Brooks people forget about mo Brooks in Alabama mo Brooks is much more conservative than either Luther strange or Roy Moore on policy and mo Brooks who's a real Tea Party guy was came in third in the in the Republican primary because he wasn't supportive enough from so this idea all these guys are you know trying to buck Trump to demonstrate that politics is a hard business I don't think that's right the problem with the argument that's being made here is that Trump's agenda is actually not the conservative agenda this has always been the problem this is the problem before the election let's say the Republicans went along with all of Trump's agenda and they just started voting for it they'd be voting for higher taxes on people who are who are actually paying the taxes they'd be voting for bigger spending they would be voting for presumably a giant infrastructure bill they would be voting for immigration policy that their own constituents in many cases don't support they would be voting for president Trump's program with regard to to foreign policy has been all over the place like Trump doesn't have a well-defined program where he can even even say follow-the-leader Rush says that I mean rush admits the Trump's tax policy is pure populism and then he says that Republicans won't pass it because it's pure populism maybe that's not a terrible thing I mean if the tax policies populism I wasn't aware that these guys were elected on a populist message they were elected on a different message what it really is is how to get votes in the middle class with that bad and this is a pure populist approach this is not a conservative approach to tax reform whatsoever on this one president Trump is who he is he is a full-fledged Nationals populist in this tax policy says here sort of I think disagree with what he was saying in the first clip and the first clip he's saying these guys in Congress they aren't conservative if they're conservative they just go along with Trump then he's admitting that Trump's tax policy is pure populism you can't really have it both ways okay Trump's tax policy here when he's saying he wants to raise the taxes on the people who are paying the majority of the taxes in the country you know that is not a conservative thing to do so what and and you know all of the hubbub around trump and trumpism in this idea of nationalist populism Trump is into nationalist populist Trump is just a guy with a bunch of use this idea of putting like a philosophical patina on trump's collection of viewpoints is wrong like sometimes he does stuff that super conservative I have to stop here and praise Trump yesterday he nominated Justice Don Willett of the Texas Supreme Court to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals great that's terrific he also nominated a judge whose last night and he's an Asian judge named thing his last name is Ho and he was nominated also he's also quite conservative Trump's judicial nominees have been across the board very conservative that's been fantastic but Trump isn't a conservative right so that the point that I'm making here is not that he doesn't get credit for that he absolutely does that's a wonderful thing he should continue nominating terrific justices to fill these slots but the suggestion that that Trump is across the board a consistent guy or he has any sort of through lines what he believes is just not true Ann Coulter's I think he's sort of making the same mistake here again I've known Ann since I was 16 years old here's Ann talking about Roy Moore the guy who just won the Alabama Senate primary I was very controversial because not only did he bring in a ten commandments a ten commandments monument and put it on the lawn at the Alabama Judicial at the state court house I guess he refused to remove it when he was ordered to remove it and he was he was ousted from his job there then he got his job back then he refused to enforce same-sex rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of the United States and then he was ousted again he's made some pretty ridiculous comments about people like keith Ellison not being able to be seated in Congress because keith Ellison is a Muslim that's absurd I really dislike keith Ellison I think Keith Allison is an awful person but I don't think that Muslims should not be allowed to sit in Congress I think that's that's silly but in any case here's Ann Coulter on Roy Moore talking about what happened in Alabama because remember Roy Moore was the guy who was not endorsed by Trump Luther Strange was the guy endorsed by Trump but Roy Moore beat Luther strange pretty handily here's here's Coulter how are you doing how are you Mark saloon oh you sound happy today ISM prevailed my candidate hey I don't know anything about Alabama's Senate candidates they look like to Andy Griffith has not been following Trump is and we now see there are two different things this is and this is the the message that people are trying to do now so now that it's clear that Trump does not actually have an ideology people are trying to actually construct one and then separate it from Trump I'll call it trumpism which is incoherent what really unifies the party you want to know why the Republican Party is having difficulty governing the reason they're having difficulty governing is because the only unifying thread between Trump and the trumpets the people who like trumpism or whatever they're calling that these days the National is populist and the people who are traditional conservatives and libertarians the only thing that unites them is opposition to the left that's not a great thing okay listen we don't what we're not big on the left here I mean we said we give you a mug right that says leftist here is hot or cold like this is what we're not huge on the left but you actually have to push a certain ideology if you hope to unify actually be able to govern the fact that Republicans are not really speaks to the idea that opposition is a lot easier than governing and this is where Trump's I keep saying this over and over mr. president you campaigned as a leader you campaigned as the guy who was gonna lead Republicans to the promised land the guy who's gonna get things done forget about the first part let's just talk about getting things done if you want to get things done you need to buckle down and you need to force through your agenda by taking it directly to the public and by wheeling and dealing what you say you're great at you need to do all of these things because otherwise it's just gonna be the Republicans unable to to push an agenda and you sitting on the sidelines sniping at them that's not a recipe for for legislative success in

subscribe leave us a review we always appreciate it we got er the largest fastest growing podcast in the nation should say were the fastest-growing largest fast growing conservative podcast in the nation in any case let's talk about some things I like and some things that I hate so one of the things that is really it's it's pretty fascinating actually about the way that we approach racial issues in this country today is we look we sort of put a different spin on history in the 1960s and 70s than what was actually being lived at the time so at the time the people who are actually making a dent we're not people like Malcolm X it was people like Martin Luther King those are the people who are convincing good-hearted white folks to join on the bandwagon not a lot of white folks were joining Martin Malcolm X's bandwagon a lot of white folks for joining Martin Luther King's bandwagon as well they should have that was the right choice okay in the 1960s and 70s the move toward racial reconciliation by the media was an attempt toward reconciliation not toward the idea that we have to continue dividing ourselves that we can be more self aware and this will lead to reconciliation but the idea that white people and black people treating each other as individuals was the way forward right which is a traditionally American idea now I want to contrast the way that the football universe is acting today with no black players have to kneel because they see a different flag than white players and white players have to stand by black players who kneel because they have to respect the black people see a different flags and white people that sort of ideology promoted by Dan Patrick a couple of days ago contrast that with what the media we're trying to do back in the 1970s so this is one of the most famous TV movies of all time it's a TV TV movie called Brian's song with a great cast it's James Caan and Billy Dee Williams this comes out in 1971 it is at the time I believe the biggest and highest-rated TV movie of all time and it is about Gale Sayers who's a the famous running back for the Chicago Bears and Brian piccolo a backup running back for the Chicago Bears and it's all rid of the whole movies about racial reconciliation and again this is when the media was actually trying to promote racial reconciliation rather than racial division in the name of racial reconciliation so here's Brian song which is a very moving good movie this is a story about two men they competed for the same job one was white the other black one like to talk a lot you said uh-huh the other was shy as a three-year-old mmm rookies got to stick together our stories about how they came to know each other fight each other I'm gonna whip you shares but you gotta be at your best and help each other I think I owe you big he'll you a lot more than that yeah what actually happened a true story Brian piccolo ended up with cancer and he died I think it's like 31 or something and they actually interviewed Gale Sayers about Brian piccolo said the movie was pretty accurate as far as our relationship and what Brian piccolo was like sports can be something that unifies us sports culture these these should be unifying factors and not dividing factors it's one of the Pet peds for the write we look at culture when we say listen that should be bringing us together you know we can have uplifting stories like this yes of course we can tell stories about terrible things that have happened black people in the past and happened to black people in the present but we also need a message of reconciliation or we're never gonna be able to move beyond this this is what Obama promised in 2008 and then didn't deliver over the next eight years instead opting for the intersectional politics of the left that suggests that America is innately divided and can never be reconciled that's a disaster area and this is it's a really good movie it's very moving film so Brian's song you can go check that out okay other things that I like speaking of unit things that should be unifying Steve Scalise the Louisiana Congress person who was shot by the Bernie Sanders supporter again not Bernie's fault as I've said a thousand times but he was shot by a guy who's a far leftist in the Congressional baseball shooting he finally came back to the house yesterday after a long recovery and here he was arriving there Thank You mr. speaker you have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's house you know and that's definite moments that we like this that we have to remember that again I keep going back to the Lincoln Line we we must be brothers otherwise we're gonna be enemies and and this is a good example of that okay time for some quick things I hate and then we will go to the mailbag already so let's begin the things I hate with the this bit of amazing journalism by steven crowder and his producer not gay Jared I actually not gay Jared has been urging me to follow him for well over a year on Twitter I finally followed him last night to his life is complete so here's what here's why the reason I did is because he actually infiltrated an Tifa over at University of Utah and you can see he was there he put on a wig he put on contact and they went they got encrypted apps from the front again Tifa wouldn't allow them in unless they got encryption on their phone and they were messaging each other here is actual video of an auntie feh member offering Steven Crowder's producer a knife and then you'll see you'll see I'm not sure if this is a man or woman it's a transgender person offer the the knife and then an ice pick the person is carrying a Taser and it also suggests that if things go wrong then they should retreat to a car where there are a k47 s in the back here with Fox 13 News we've been tracking anthem for a long time he was just down there at president's circle and they were handing out sharp objects to staff people with so they had someone coming with an 8k why did it take - late night host comedians to find this out hey you know what I wish you guys luck okay so what's it what's amazing is that you go watch the full footage over at louder with Crowder we also posted it last night at daily wire and you'll see that the girl goes out and girl a guy again I'm not sure about this person but this person this person offers that and then says no not only do you have to - a case coming one of the other people says we have a sawed-off shotgun okay so out of shotguns are illegal under all law okay there's not there's not a state in the Union that allows sawed-off shotguns and and they were offering this I guess that the Crowder's producer said knocking Jarrod went to the when's the cops after this he basically said guys I gotta go to the bathroom and then he immediately went to the police and the police came and arrested these people but it is amazing and it is amazing that that again you know I think more journalistic outlets should be doing work like this one of the things that I talk about when I talk about journalism is that there's an attempt by the media to separate acts of journalism from being a journalist so say well my career is I'm a journalist okay fine fair but then there's a suggestion that if you're not a journalist and you go and do an act of journalism like Crowder's doing crowder again as a comedian and not gay Gerardus producer that that is not journalism because they are not quote-unquote journalists right they don't have the magic journalists fairy dust and therefore they don't get that credit okay you get credit for breaking the story when you break the story this is a story okay when auntie fizz offering your knife that's a story these people are not nonviolent they are quite violent and they're quite willing to engage in violence okay one more thing I hate and we'll get to them the food one more thing I hate and get something like okay one more one more thing I hate okay so that is Jimmy Kimmel last night I hate to rip on Jimmy Kimmel so much lately because I think Jimmy Kimmel is a talented guy but Jimmy Kimmel he he did a whole tribute to Hugh Hefner and yesterday if you wanted my take on Hugh Hefner I did 20 minutes on Hugh Hefner yesterday go listen to yesterday's podcast the short take is everybody is treating a seedy old pornographer like he was some sort of great force in American life for good and here's Jimmy Kimmel saying about a guy who legitimately was worse to women than Donald Trump by about a thousand times I mean his grotto was was described as a sex prison by people who used to work there here's Jimmy Kimmel talking about how wonderful Hugh Hefner was and he'll be disappointed he'll be disappointed after he dies and goes to heaven I was thinking about last night Hugh Hefner's probably the only person ever to be disappointed by heaven with all these harps let's get some naked girls in here okay first of all a couple of suggestions I think it's highly doubtful that the place if there is an afterlife that Hugh Hefner will end up is initially heaven but in any case this this idea the Jim that Hugh Hefner is just somebody we joke about Hugh Hefner he may have helped individual women who are trying to make their way in the world he was not good for women as a whole and he was not good for men as a whole the pornography porn porn if ocation of american culture has not been a good thing for men who become desensitized to sex and treat women as sex objects more often because they see more naked women all the time airbrushed naked women in most of these cases and it's not been great for women who are seen is the objects by by these guys I mean it has not been good for the culture so the celebration of Hugh Hefner is quite odd these are the same people who when clay Travis had first amendment in boobs and CNN Oh Garrick Lake Travis sexism sexism Hugh Hefner was one bajillion times as sexist as clay Travis I mean legitimately pretty pretty incredible and by the way there's an awful article over Politico today saying that Clay Travis is somehow an alt writer and then they provide no evidence that he's actually an alt writer I guess that he's an alt writer because he says that kneeling for the flag is bad and that Trump is right I may disagree with them but that doesn't make you alright okay in any case let's get to the mailbag again if you're subscriber right your left right your your messages now and we will do something live okay Isaac says I'm 21 I have no idea what I want to do with my life I have no real interest either how do I find out what I should do for my career well you're asking me if you're like a lump if you're like an amoeba what should you do with your life um so you have no real interest and you have no idea what you want to do with your life and I'm supposed to fix that for you so normally I fix your problems let me start with this one if you are bored with things it's because you're boring okay if you're bored with life it's because you haven't searched enough if you decide to be bored with life you're not gonna make a career or a happy life out of being bored so you do have to find something that you are enthusiastic about something that you're interested in listen you're interested enough to become a subscriber to this show which means that you're obviously interested in pop culture and politics so there's certain things you're interested in you know you may not be interested in becoming an electrical engineer but there's certain aspects of life that you are interested in enough and fascinated enough to engage with you need to find out what those are and what aspect of that you can be good with and there's so much crossover in the economy right can be interested in politics and you don't have to sit behind a mic like me you can you know we have people who cut audio for us we have people who do animation for us we have people who produce the show we have people who travel with me on the road we have million you know like there are lots of different jobs in this in this milieu so if you're interested in this kind of stuff there are lots of different jobs that fulfill different skill sets what I say to everybody find your passion and then find the skill set that matches your passion and that's the best way to have a happy life Julia says dear Ben my parents are Bali too about this is Jews who become religious violate you teshuva means owners of repentance literally does most of my siblings have left religion I'm the only one still as religious as my parents I'm also 14 so I don't have much of a choice why do children of both ultra-religious parents abandon religion so I think one of the reasons is that ultra religious parents very often don't feel there's a real balance in the religious community between Kroy stirring your child and exposing them to ideas so that you can inoculate them against bad ideas right you understand why people feel that there's a seduction to secular culture there is I mean you get to do whatever you want right all the time you get to do whatever you want sounds great except that you may not find fulfilment in that sometimes acting with virtue is the place you actually find fulfillment but let's say that you're an 18 year old kid and you've only lived in an ultra-orthodox community lives in a car ad community for example and you decide you're gonna go to college and suddenly people are saying to you things like well have you ever considered the time I may not have happened or have you ever considered that and that the Bible is a book of myth or have you ever considered that religion may be false altogether and God doesn't exist it you can do whatever you want and hey look they're a bunch of hot girls let's go to a party right these things actually affect people who are religious and this is why I think it's very important to have open and honest conversations about the nature of faith about the nature of your faith about why it is that going to the party with the hot girls it may be worth forgoing that in order so that you have a better life in the future like I have a very fulfilled wife thank God I have a very fulfilled life that was until I was 24 right I was married at 24 to my wife she was 20 and I am very pleased with that decision she was a virgin as well I do not have a single shred of regret that I didn't go to college parties and drink myself senseless and have sex with random people I have no regret about that I don't have regret about that because I think that I've chosen a better way of life and I think that you have to feel that you are defending a higher truth in order for you to feel as though you're doing something valuable and not be seduced by outside forces so people tend to react to the outside forces by closed during themselves that only makes them more vulnerable it's sort of like the polio virus in the 1930s well one of the funny things about polio viruses that it tended to affect it tended to inflict more damage on people who are very wealthy than people who are very poor and people wondering why is that well the answer is that a lot of poor people were playing outside in the mud and exposing themselves to germs they'd stronger immune systems and a lot of the rich kids weren't if you if you keep a kid a baby in a bubble and they they never have to deal with with antigens then there's there's never going to be a situation in which their immune system is developed enough for them to actually fight those things off you have to expose your kids to enough ideas that are foreign to your culture and then defend your culture against those that your kids have heard it before and it's nothing new and seductive by the way I feel this way about when you talk to your kids about sex I think that half of the half of the things that go wrong with regard to kids and sex is that we say to kids wait you can't talk about that it's secret it's mysterious when you take the mystery out of sex then you're actually injecting the love back into sex meaning that sex is not anything mysterious it's a biological function all right certain parts going in certain places when you remove the mystery from sex what you end up doing is suggesting that in order for it to be more than that there needs to be some sort of feeling attached to the sex I think the mistake a lot of religious parents make city well we can't talk about that well you can't talk about that right there yeah that's dirty that's dirty talk we can't talk about it and then kids Google it's dirty sounds great all right that's it so I think it's a big mistake not to be open and honest with your kids about this kind of stuff Mitch says what is your favorite musical period classical romantic etc and why well I think probably the border between classical and romantic so for people don't know classical music that well classical music was basically from there's the Baroque period which is sort of Bach and then there's the Classical period which is considered Mozart and Beethoven Beethoven really sort of spans the divide between classical and romantic and by the tenets of Tchaikovsky and Brahms here in the Romantic period so Beethoven is the best composer who ever lived although there is a strong argument for Bach the the most listenable music in terms of just you turn on the radio and you in you and it's easy listening is is baroque / classical music by Bach that that's if I had to pick one composer to take to a desert island it would be Bach Benjamin says hey Ben I've been reading up on Israel and I'm becoming frustrated with the fact that Israel's public perception has shifted so negatively when it's blatantly obvious that they are not the hostile actors in the region when did this shift in public opinion occur who are the main proponents of it so the major shift in public opinion did not occur in the last ten years it occurred in 1967 before that Israel is considered a small nation fighting for its survival in a community of nations seeking to destroy it and after 67 when Israel was dominance in the six-day war then a lot of the left suggested that Israel was now the oppressor because Israel was powerful and also Israel was bad because it wasn't socialist enough because that was about the time the Soviet Union realized that they were gonna try and make inroads in the Arab community by making nice with people like Nasser who was the head of Egypt at the time and in doing so they sort of posed Israel as a mini America and people hate America and Israel for basically the same reason if they if they hate Israel now Chris has hey Ben if you were trying to get into politics on a local level what would be a good position to begin a political career well it depends on your your neighborhood I would say the easiest place to get in is usually something like the school board you know someplace where there five thousand voters because there you can actually do direct outreach to all the people who are voting it's enough people you can actually shake all the hands of every voter that you want to vote for you and then once you're on the school board you can actually do some good hopefully for the students and that usually seems like a good way to to promote your career Kathy says I have a family member who's in a lesbian relationship raising a baby and I have two children under 4 I don't want my children to be confused by seeing this how do I handle holidays well I mean I think that you should honestly have an open conversation with your lesbian relative I think that's perfectly fair I think it's perfectly fair confusing small children about about heterosexuality versus homosexuality seems to me a really bad move because if you're trying to inculcate a set of values and you say that it is that it is better for for your child to be straight than gay which is a perfectly respectable non home all that position just talking about what will lead to your perception of human happiness that's not irrational in any way if you if you say to this to this lesbian family member listen you're welcome to come over you know you're welcome to say that this is that this is your partner right this is a person who you live with but you know we don't like using the word wife because I don't want to explain to my child that because I don't believe in same-sex marriage right the state may but I don't and I don't want to I don't want my child to believe in that either and that's my right as a parent you can either respect my rights as a parent or we can meet privately off away from the kids like this is a matter of parental rights and parental right you don't have a right to teach my kid anything I have a right to teach my kid what I want it's my kid Jessica says happy Friday ban yesterday you said if you haven't wrestled with your doubts you're not religious is there a particular time you wrestle more heavily with your faith and what brought you assurance thanks for always being the voice of reason during the non-stop carousel of leftist crazy so it's kind of weird for me um when I wrestle with doubts the doubts that I tend to wrestle with our doubts about how much of faith can be based on rationality and how much of faith has to be based on faith so there's never been a time where I've where I've really thought where I've really thought that God didn't exist I've wondered whether there's a rational basis for God's existence and that's where I'm really doubtful I also have never responded to tragedy that has occurred in my family by doubting God's existence that's just it's a lot of people do a lot of people see terrible terrible things and they doubt God's existence I've never really had a problem with the theodicy part of the issue the issue that why if God exists why does evil exist it seems to me that God created the system where freewill has to exist which means that he has to shield himself because if everything God did were immediately visible in terms of acts and consequences freewill would go by the wayside that said you know I think that that's why I'm constantly reading about religion a little bit later today actually I'm into a Facebook live where the professor a professor named Edward fazer and I welcome you to go over our Facebook page and watch he wrote a book called five proofs of God's existence and I want to talk to him about those proofs and what they mean and how much of faith can actually be based on reason and how much you you have to actually take a leap of faith I would also say that one of the things that brings me a little bit of comfort here maybe it's foolish but I think this is but I think that it's it's true anyway is that every system of thought has leaps of faith attached to it sam harris has as many leaps of faith in his system of thought as i do and what'll be fun is I'm doing an event with Sam Harris in December in San Francisco we're gonna sell it it's like 2500 seats and we're gonna talk about all these things freewill religion it should be a blast I look forward to it Sam's a good guy Madison says hi Ben thanks for signing my canvas when I met you in June what's your position on physician assisted suicide should it be legal is it moral what is the best argument against it so it seems to me that the best argument against physician assisted suicide is that his physician assisted so I think there's an interesting moral argument with regard to assisted suicide in general like the truth is that when we have palliative care it's not assisted suicide formally because we're not injecting enough morphine to Kelly but we're basically making you comfortable until you die putting physician assisted suicide on the table means that you have to start drawing lines now even people who are in favor of a physician assisted suicide usually will want to require that the person who is receiving the physician assisted suicide should have to go through some sort of background check that if you're an 11 year olds he's having thoughts of suicide but you're perfectly healthy in every way that we shouldn't allow you to do that well now you're putting your standards on the person who wants to commit the suicide which denies the fundamental argument you're making about autonomy so that's sort of interesting I don't think doctors should be in the business of death I don't think doctors should be competing to see who can deliver death the cheapest price in a free market and doctors should be there to heal your suicide also you should be taking culpability for your own suicide it shouldn't be on a doctor to have to take culpability for killing you all right Joseph says hi Ben lots of non-religious that.i people people that I meet attempt to discredit the Bible by bringing up violent verses that call for things like stoning disobedient children and people who send in general how do you combat points like these especially if you're unfamiliar with those verses so first of all you have to be familiar with the voice verses in order to in order to fight back against miss readings of the verses if you don't know that much about it you say listen I want to go do the research on the verse forgive me if I don't take your opinion as gospel truth on this particular verse since you obviously have an axe to grind let me do the research maybe I'll have a response on those particular verses by the way the Talmud says that no child has ever been has never been held accountable for what they call Ben surah or Mora which is the the rebellious child who is stoned also all of the death penalty offenses in the Bible require according to Jewish law anyway two eyewitnesses who not only witness the event but warn the person beforehand all right they actually warn the person they say do not kill that man and the guy says screw you I'm gonna kill him and then they both see that and they both see the guy then they go and testify so this is why it also says in the Talmud that a Beit din a Sanhedrin that issued a death penalty once every 70 years was considered a murderous Beit din so the all of the talk about you know all the death penalty stuff in the Bible was really not applied it was it was an attempt to express that rebellion against God in participation in sin is worthy of death that's really what it's about Chris says what do you believe will be Trump's most likely legislation to pass during this term it seems health care is behind us for now and tax reforms on shaky ground as well I think at some point he's just gonna turn to infrastructure he's gonna grab bout 20 Republicans and 40 Democrats and try to ram through a giant infrastructure package it's quite possible though that the political landscape is so polarized at this point that the Democrats are saying we're not gonna help you with anything and then nothing passes and it's an amazing statement to make about about a president that nothing passes but we're now through year one and that's where the president's political capital is highest and nothing's passing Antonia says do you or Antonia says you been do you think the number of sexual partner one has before marriage is important does having more partners lower the chances of you having a successful marriage well the data tend to show that the more promiscuous you are before marriage the less likely it is that you're gonna be happy inside of marriage the data also tend to show that if you live with somebody for a long time before marriage or divorce rate is higher this idea you have to try out a partner before you get married I think it's just idiocy the reason being that that's what dating is for but the idea that you have to try somebody out to be sexually compatible I have real serious problems with this you know the I don't want to get too graphic here but let me just suggest that I think that there is a solid correlation unless you have like a serious sexual dysfunction which is something that you probably would know beforehand or if you don't know beforehand there are treatments for then the idea that you are sexually incompatible generally means that you're personally incompatible as well if these are all issues that should be discussed upfront but this this making sex super complicated like you have to try it out because your cuz you're comparing cars it seems like idiocy to me first of all if you and the person that you're having sex with have hadn't had no basis for comparison then it's the best sex you've both ever had so that's so that there is that convenient little fact you know if the only beer you've ever had is Bud Light is the greatest beer you've ever had so they say you don't really have to worry about but also I think sexual compatibility is really more just about being willing to give just being a giving person and if you're a giving person then sexual compatibility is actually pretty easy Seth says what is the appropriate legal route to take for an individual that believes there is racism taking place within a work environment what this process be costing well usually there's state or federal laws anti-discrimination laws you can file a lawsuit if they violate those discrimination laws one of the questions that I have is whether those laws should be on the books in the first place not because I'm Pro discrimination I hate discrimination but because in a free market I think that discrimination should be punished by other businesses destroying the discriminatory business in open competition but the appropriate legal route to take just as a lawyer is you'd have to actually go look at the applicable state or federal law and see if it's technically been violated Vinson says for a guy in the workplace how many buttons can be undone on a collared button-up shirt and a Social Scene a bar a barbecue family event how many buttons can be undone - thank you so my answer is exactly the same in either case you see the number of buttons that I currently have undone the answer is one do not be Michael Knowles don't do it okay this is nonsense where you can button your shirt down to your navel look at me okay like no one wants to see that no one wants to see that if they wanted to see that they'd be married to you okay the idea that you should be walking around with your with your shirt undone and that it's comfortable social scene just like a mensch and if you want if you don't want to wear a button-down shirt then put on a t-shirt okay like I don't understand why modesty is gone by the wayside for everybody like it no one wants to see that really if they want to see it then they should then they should be willing to put a ring on it as the great prophetess Beyonce one side okay so now so we will be back here next week on Monday so next week I'm warning you now so that you have fair warning we are doing shows Monday Tuesday Wednesday then I'm gone for a week and a half a week and a half because I'm finally taking my long-awaited vacation it's a Jewish holiday so I'd be missing some of those days anyways I'm taking the vacation during the Jewish holiday I'm really technically missing only like a couple of days that I wouldn't be able to died be able to broadcast anyway but that means that next week you're going to have to listen up and listen good because if you're going to fix things while I'm gone then you're going to need to listen to my words of advice very clearly and you need to put your ear very close to your phone and you're going to need to that everything that I say is correct because for a week and a half I will not be here to guide you when I come back down from the top of the mountain I will bring you a set of Commandments okay then I'm getting a little bit over my over my skis all right well we'll be back here on Monday I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
