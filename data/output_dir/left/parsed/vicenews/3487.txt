dammit this is great
welcome to dad opinions starring John
Darnell the dude from the mountain coats
if I feel like the person sat down to
say I'm going to write something
inspirational then I become suspicious
there's probably personal issue are you
trying to cheer me up
don't do that be honest if you feel you
special you know but when I think I
smell it then I think that's not for me
I am a performer and so I know the
feeling of self-doubt that you have one
stage and that's what the song is about
cuz rock preaches you this sort of
gospel of authenticity that is a false
gospel but yeah but the thing is like as
a lyric when a guy in that context says
he's doing I get questions this on the
other hand is for me
milk in the major sevens and going for a
more loping vibe willing to sort of hang
out with the groove a little I was
disappointed that I think the drums are
all synthetic cuz when I hear something
with a groove like that
hire a drummer they will take you
someplace who is that well you're with
George Benson aha
that's rad as anything
I was having drinks after a show with
some musicians who are well-known and I
happened to mention a band to whom these
musicians often get compared and they
winced and one of them said you know
good luck to all bands and that's what I
have to say about the music we've just
enjoyed is good luck to all bands who is
this song bye
wait oh now I feel awful you know how
many people love Ray Davies and the
kinks I've never liked the kinks I just
can't do it I've tried so hard and I'm
still mystified I can't do it anymore
I'm not satisfied thank you
you
