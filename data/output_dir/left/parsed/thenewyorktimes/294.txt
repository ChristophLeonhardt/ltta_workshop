Once upon a time, the devil
laughed with fiendish glee,
the gates of hell
stood wide open
and damnation lay in
wait for everyone.
But this story isn’t
about the devil.
It’s about God —
and Martin Luther.
Like most Catholics 500
years ago, Luther feared God.
He prayed and prayed,
but his fear persisted.
Luther wondered why.
He brooded long and hard upon
the matter while walking,
at church, even on the latrine.
Until it hit him —
“I found it!
God does not hate us, He
loves us,” he rejoiced.
“We don’t need to be afraid.
The Church exploits our
fear to enrich itself,”
was his provocative idea.
Out of this idea
grew many others,
and Luther trumpeted
them far and wide.
“Such impudence!”
fumed the pope,
when he got wind
of Luther’s views.
His anger was
unsurprising. After all,
the Church had amassed a
fortune selling indulgences.
“What a lousy, no-good monk!”
he cried.
“Only the pope possesses
the key to grace.”
Luther protested,
“Only God can bestow grace,
and the pope is a mere man.”
“Recant!
I order you to obey,”
the pope seethed.
“Christians are free and
subservient to no one,”
Luther insisted.
But this went too
far for the pontiff,
who now threatened Luther.
“You will be excommunicated!
Your writings will burn.”
“Big deal,” scoffed Luther, as
he heaped ridicule on the pope.
“That’s it,” the pope raged.
“This Luther, he
must go,” he cried.
And expelled him
from the church.
The emperor too took Luther
to task for his beliefs.
“Take it all back,” he demanded.
“Especially that
nonsense about freedom.”
“That I cannot do,”
Luther replied.
“I must follow my conscience,”
he said in defiance.
“How dare you,” the
emperor exclaimed,
and declared Luther an outlaw.
“Wait a minute,” 
the nobility thought.
“Conscience and freedom
aren’t such bad ideas.”
City and municipal officials
also got to thinking.
“If what Luther says
is true,
then the church doesn’t
deserve another penny.
We alone should determine
where our money goes.”
But some Germans took
this concept too far.
When a merchant confronted a
noble man for taking his horses
and wanted to burn
down his house,
using Luther’s idea of
freedom as justification,
Luther set the record straight.
“I never spoke of political
freedom,” he said.
“You are free in your
thoughts, yet subjects
you remain, nonetheless.”
But it was too late.
People had already embraced
Luther and his ideas
of freedom and conscience.
Even now we honor
him with books,
quotes, praises,
exhibitions on his legacy.
The cultural and intellectual
transformation he triggered
remains with us around
the world to this day.
