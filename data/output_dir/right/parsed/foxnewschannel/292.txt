PANAMA CITY BEACH.
>> AS YOU CAN SEE THE RAIN IS
COMING DOWN.
IT IS GETTING HEAVIER AND
HEAVIER AND THE WIND GUSTS ARE
STARTING TO PICK UP.
BAY COUNTY EMERGENCY OFFICIALS
SAY SOME GUSTS ARE LIFE
THREATENING AND NOW WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF FIRE SERVICES
WITHIN THE CITY OF PANAMA CITY,
THEY ARE UNABLE TO MAKE
EMERGENCY FIRE AND RESCUE CALLS
WITHIN BAY COUNTY.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY HAD
BEEN WARNING ABOUT AS
CONDITIONS BEGAN TO DETERIORATE.
IN ADDITION TO THE WINDS
PICKING UP AND THE HEAVY WINDS,
ANOTHER CONCERN IS STORM SURGE.
THOSE HEAVY WINDS FROM THE
HURRICANE WASHING MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF WATER ASHORE IN SOME
PARTS OF THE PANHANDLE THE
STORM SURGE COULD EXCEED 13
FEET.
MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEEDED THE
MANDATORY EVACUATIONS IN
LOW-LYING AREAS, FOR THOSE WHO
DECIDED TO HUNKER DOWN AND WAIT
AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON,
THEIR WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY OF
LEAVING IS RAPIDLY CLOSING.
HERE IS WHAT GOVERNOR SCOTT HAD
TO SAY ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING.
>> IF YOU ARE AN INLAND COUNTY
YOU MAY HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE TO
SEEK SHELTER.
BUT ONLY DO SO IF LOCAL
OFFICIALS SAY IT'S SAFE.
AGAIN, IF YOU MADE THE CHOICE
NOT TO EVACUATE, PLEASE FIND A
PLACE TO SHELTER, SEEK A PLACE
OF REFUGE.
BUT IF IT IS NOT SAFE TO LEAVE
YOUR HOME, DON'T LEAVE.
THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO NOW
IS LEAVE AND PUT YOURSELF AND
YOUR FAMILY IN DANGER.
>> THAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY
RAPIDLY CLOSING.
WE STILL HAVE POWER WHERE WE
ARE.
WE EXPECT TO LOSE IT AS THE
CONDITIONS WORSEN.
MORE THAN 17,000 UTILITY
WORKERS ARE AT VARIOUS STAGING
