it's that time of month when we like to visit the website everyday feminism where it's always that time of month you know some people think that feminism is destructive because it guides women and men away from the natural life paths that give them the most joy and brow beats them into hostile and unhappy behaviors in order to serve a twisted idea of fairness that really only interests a few loudmouth neurotics who think they can override their own self hatred by imposing their demented standards on the world at large other people think other things that aren't true but the writers at everyday feminism are so fully committed to their philosophy that they want to squeeze every drop of human misery they can out of it and make you drink those drops down one by one until even the faintest memory of pleasure or contentment is extinguished from your mind your relationships and your life isn't that feminist let's take a look at a post on the site today called five radical ways that people do non-monogamy that you need to know about this is a real post now non-monogamy sometimes known as cheating or adultery or violating one of God's Ten Commandments is a wonderfully feminist lifestyle because it's guaranteed to suck the trust and love out of any relationship and send it into a downward spiral of jealousy heartache and disease but you may not realize that even if you open up your marriage to having meaningless and destructive sex with outsiders you still may not be fully feminist so everyday feminism recommends five styles of non-monogamy with quote feminist principles at their core I am NOT making these up one styles of non-monogamy that Center queer love this is when your husband's boyfriend is just as primary to your marriage as you are this is a fun one because it includes a big surprise namely that your husband's boyfriend's is actually a lot more primary than you are because if your husband has a boyfriend he's gay two styles the challenge gender norms this is where the man is the homemaker his lesbian wife works to support and someone who no one knows what he is sleeps with everybody until you know the murder happens three styles of monogamy that don't police sexual or romantic desire this is where the guy doesn't care who his wife falls in love with and the wife falls in love with a woman but they don't have sex and some girl in a wheelchair doesn't want to have sex with anyone but just won't go away and everyone's unhappy four styles that allow alternatives to the nuclear family I'm not sure what this one is but I know it involves a lot of psychotherapy for the children and five everyday feminism encourages you to explore styles of non-monogamy that encourage autonomy this is where you love someone but you want them to feel free to leave you for someone else if they come back they're yours forever if they don't you stand outside their door in the rain holding down the buzzer and screaming you ruined my life until the police take you away these are the styles of non-monogamy that everyday feminism feels you need to know about to be happy although if you're in a hurry you can achieve the exact same level of happiness by driving a nail into your eyeball trigger warning metric Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show site that just never stops giving isn't it all right we're live on Facebook I promised it would happen I lied but now it's true so I didn't lie it's all good we will only be here for 15 minutes you only get the first 15 minutes and then there will be a loud flash suddenly you'll be

tomorrow the mailbag is tomorrow yes you have to get your questions in well we can't answer we can't read minds it's not like that Johnny Carson routine where I hold things up to my head we have to have to send in your questions and then on though all right we're gonna talk about the abortion decision so that should be a lot of fun well who do a survey of the political world but first I just have to say that every time I do that website everyday feminism I am torn between my sense of humor because it is so incredibly hilarious it's so but also this kind of magic sets of how unhappy they must be and how unhappy they're making everybody else you know I mean it's like feminism it's just like this terrible terrible thing they never they never concentrate on saying to you you can be excellent by doing this or you can be more yourself by doing this it's always trying to make you feel nervous about what other people are doing and and not offending everybody you know it reminds me it reminds me of that line in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest the novel where the guy says the the bat and if you're in a fistfight a bad man will kick you in the groin but a good man will pick up a chair because a good man tries to make himself stronger and a bad man tries to make you weaker and all the left ever does just try to make the opposition weaker they don't say like Oh women can be better they say men have to be more like women men have to be worse you know they have to do less they don't say like blacks can be better they say whites have to check their privilege and do less you know it's just it's just a recipe for misery you know there there was an article on the site acculturated which is a good site about pop culture from looking at it from the right by a guy named Mark judge it was called why are modern women so angry and he starts out quoting the same study that I quoted last week about the fact that women have become less happy since feminism since the war and he says there's also overwhelming anecdotal evidence for anyone who bothers to make basic observations talk to women from the greatest generation or from the 50s in early 1960s and they generally seem rosier than their young feminist counterparts these are people who went through the depression and the war but they're securing themselves and happy about who they are by contrast many modern women's seem quick to express anger about their lives living in a world of unlimited choices and constant affirmation they nonetheless seem resentful American women live in the freest most open-minded country on earth yet they seem bitter and disappointment disappointed and then he goes on to talk about this comedian Casey Wilson who wrote this article about the savage anger issue she wrote it in lena Dunham's went website perfect place to write about how angry and unhappy you are and it's just raging and throwing things and all this and Casey Wilson says my mom was the president of the National Women's Political caucus an organization devoted to getting women elected for the first several years of my life I wonder if growing up with a mother who was so angry at the state of things she wore a pro-choice sticker while eight months pregnant with me played a role being angry let me tell you Kacie yes it did certainly it's just a bad anyway I just I laugh at everyday feminism because their ideas are so goofy but it is I just think some somewhere someone is reading that and becoming less happy alright we're gonna come back to this when we talk about the SCOTUS decision because one of the things we love to talk about on the Andrew Clavin show these ideas and the way they affect people and Obama has been selling this notion that ideas don't matter it doesn't matter you know remember he was in Cuba and he said well you want some capitalism socialism pick what works it doesn't matter if you want to be free it doesn't matter what the philosophies behind those two systems are just pick what works but how do you know what works if you don't know what you're trying to to achieve and then of course with Islam this whole idea that you know there's no difference between one religion and another one person believes love your neighbor the other person believes kill the infidel what what possible difference could that make in people's lives it's all one alright so let's take a quick look at politics before we get to the Supreme Court Hillary Clinton was out on the campaign trail road-testing a VP candidate one of the people on her shortlist Elizabeth Warren the senator from Massachusetts a darling of the left and so Elizabeth Warren was auditioning for the vice president with this attack on what's-his-name oh yeah Donald Trump Donald Trump says Donald Trump says he'll make America great again it's it's right there no it stamped on the front of his goofy hat you want to see goofy look at him in that hat but when when Donald Trump says great I ask great for who exactly yeah for millions of kids struggling to pay for an education for millions of seniors barely surviving on Social Security for families that don't fly to Scotland to play golf when Donald Trump says he'll make America great he means make it even greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump great for the guys who don't care how much they've already squeezed from everyone else great for the guys who always want more because that's who Donald Trump is the guy who wants it all for himself and watch out because he will crush you into the dirt to get whatever he want all right so Trump before I comment on that Trump hit back in a phone conversation with NBC's Hallie Jackson she describes that a couple of highlights here from that conversation Peter and I want to read you a few quotes from our conversation in which Donald Trump said Elizabeth Warren acted in a racist manner he called her a fraud and he again reuptake name that many find offensive pocahontas adding as he said before that he believes that nickname is in fact an insult to Pocahontas herself he said that he hopes that Elizabeth Warren has selected as Hillary Clinton's presidential running mate indicating his campaign has turned both barrels on Warren if that is the case Trump telling me that his campaign has ready essentially in the can comments that Warren has made about Hillary Clinton in the past things that Trump believes Democrats will find quote devastating Trump said Elizabeth Warren is a total fraud he talked about claims that she exaggerated her native american heritage saying she made up her heritage which i think is racist he said i think she's a racist actually because what she did was very racist when pressed on this he said she's been totally unable to prove she's Native American and yet used that to advance her career said I hope she is the one shows by crooked Hillary he also calls her a fraud essentially so some very harsh words from Donald Trump going after Elizabeth Warren so they they're really going back and forth now I've stopped making predictions about this election because really at some point I expect like chariots of fire to descend from the sky it's hoping so it's something so unpredictable if the sky just opens and like blood pours down like in Kerry like blood pours out on people's heads and they start moving objects with their mind will be like oh it's 2016 elections it's just like the way it goes but I have to say you're looking at those two women if you couldn't see it if you haven't subscribed and you're still clinging to your lousy eight bucks yeah but they're they're dressed exactly alike they're both wearing these blue suits and they look a lot alike they both have the frosted hair and they're standing to get an Elizabeth Warren is so dynamic and so eloquent and so good at this political game of cut and thrust the Trump likes to play she's good at it I mean there's just no no putting it aside yeah I cannot imagine Hillary is going to let her into her campaign full-time she makes her look like a stiff you know it's like you ever if you've ever seen the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet there's a character Mercutio who's so full of charm and delight Shakespeare had to kill him you had to kill him because you have to make Romeo but not like a stroke you looked like a bore you know so this is the same kind of thing how could you let that woman there be it there'd be a lot of the press would love the two women meme and they would go after that in a big way but how can you let this woman who just makes you look like such a bore you know stand next you I just don't think that's gonna happen so meanwhile another part of this thing this hasn't caught on yet but it's obviously it's obviously got a little bit of a little bit of momentum is this Secret Service guy Gary Byrne and he is put out this book called crisis of character where he is saying the Clinton White House was a drug den that people were on coke that women were being shepherded in and out and that Hillary was a monster that she was beating there was domestic violence she was beating Clinton up that they didn't know what to do about it because I supposed to defend the president but how do you defend the president against his wife you know then gee and he says basically she going to these rages well here he is talking to Hannity she would go into these unbelievable rages he's talking to Hannity here I feel so strongly that people need to know the real Hillary Clinton and and how dangerous she is in her behavior she is not a leader she is not a leader doesn't have the temperament I have a temperament she didn't have the temperament to handle the social office in when she was first lady she does not have the temperament he's dishonest she's dishonest she a bit early lies anybody that you know can separate themselves from their politics and and and review her behavior over the last you're gonna beef to you this being political absolutely I'm sure I will be I have been already and it was no answer it's not it's got nothing to do with politics it's another country it is love of country and well I hope some day that it does make a difference I mean if mrs. Clinton ends up being the president United States then then she's our president and she's the commander-in-chief and it is what it is but if she did become the president without me speaking the truth I'm not sure I could I could deal with that people need to know this is serious and and her behavior is appalling and she's two different people so just pause for a minute let you know we're gonna go off live the live feed in a minute and we will disappear vanish but you can follow us if you subscribe on The Daily wire you can listen for free you can listen for free but you can only see this beautiful beautiful face if you subscribe that's that should be worth $8 in and of itself people pay me eight dollars just to come and look at me anyway so I think you should you should be alright so that's so that's you know that doesn't have obviously the power yet of the Swift Boat guys because the Swift Boat guys there were so many of them that nobody could ignore them remember when the Swift Boat guys went after Kerry for his Vietnam service they had served with them this is one guy anybody can say anything about anyone you know you don't know what it is but obviously Hillary Clinton does know that her character isn't an issue he or she is trying to you know fight back against the accusations that she's dishonest I personally know I have work to do on this front a lot of people tell pollsters they don't trust me now I don't like hearing that and I've thought a lot about what's behind it and you know you hear 25 years worth of wild accusations anyone would start to wonder and it certainly is true I've made mistakes I don't know anyone who hasn't so I understand people having questions now maybe we can persuade people to change their minds by marshalling facts and making arguments to rebut negative attacks but that doesn't work for everyone you can't just talk someone into trusting you you've got to earn it so yes I could say that the reason I sometimes sound careful with my words is not that I'm hiding something it's just that I'm careful with my words I believe what you say actually matters I think that's true in life and it's especially true if you're president okay it's all the things that we've been saying that make her people think she's dishonest it's not the fact that she's dishonest you know she keeps lying I mean it's they have they have the tapes of her lying and lying in line so anyway so we say farewell to our Facebook friends but come to the Daily wire and you can hear here the rest of the show and if you subscribe you can watch the rest of the show yeah and beyond the mailbag tomorrow which is the most important thing all right let's let's move on to to this Supreme Court decision this is a big decision on abortion that came down yesterday 5-3 I'll read the description very succinct description from The Wall Street Journal in 2013 the Texas Legislature passed a law that doctors doing abortions must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic if something went wrong you had to be able to get somebody into a real hospital it also said the clinic's had to equal the health and safety rules of ambulatory surgical centers so they were holding abortion clinics to high medical standards the courts majority struck down the entire law as a violation of the Constitution because its provisions impose a quote undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion it suggested that the laws hospital admission rules for abortion doctors would harm women in rural counties the phrase undue burden is the famous legal test of state regulatory authority as defined in the 1992 abortion case Planned Parenthood Parenthood versus Casey the point of Casey was to establish that states had the right to regulate abortion absent an undue burden on women at the point of Monday's Texas decision is to tell the states to forget Casey that the legal path is so narrow as to make state regulation of abortion of fiction in other words they just made it so hard to regulate abortion that there's really nothing the state can do Nancy Northrup of the Center for Reproductive Rights called the decision a complete and total win and a game-changer she's right here's let's listen to dawn Lagaan of Planned Parenthood outside the court as the decision comes down she tells you exactly what the decision means today this victory gives us the opportunity to March state by state legislature by legislature rule by rule build by Bill and reclaim women's health and rights across this country 100% no burdens on any woman anywhere and that's what we're gonna that's what they're gonna do so anytime they try and impose some kind of medical standards on an abortion clinic that it's gonna get struck down this is what the court seems to be saying now let me just take for one minute let me finish a little bit of that Wall Street Journal piece about the political effects that these kinds of decisions have it says an important persistent question of our times is how to account for the wide political and social polarization between liberals and conservatives Monday's 5:3 Supreme Court decisions striking down a Texas abortion law reveals what's beneath these divisions the reason that this country is so divided I agree with us 100% by the way the reason this country is so divided at least 1/2 of the counties polarized electorate now thinks that liberal legal jurisprudence simply means judges will do whatever they must to get a desired result about that justice Clarence Thomas and his dissent is explicit he says the court should abandon the pretense that anything other than policy preferences underlies its balancing of constitutional rights and interests in any given case justice Thompson's Thomas pointed out that the liberals identified new impossible to meet tests for allowable state abortion regulation only a week after they waved through college racial preferences with little more justification than asserting aspirational educational goals Thomas is now Thomas says the court that American justice is now riddled with special exceptions for special rights that's why we're so divided it really goes back to roe v wade it was true also of the gay marriage decision the court has taken our decisions our political decisions out of our own hands so we don't have a chance to work these things through and come to compromises to people come to a compromise no matter how far apart they are they both can feel a little bit dissatisfied but feel that they got something of what they want but when we are crushed by five people in Washington who have no other authority but to basically make these random decisions since they're no longer following the Constitution you know then we just stay here we just keep hating each other the hatred just gets worse and worse because we have no redress we have no way to eat there's no reason to debate why would we debate when there's no way we can make a law why not just shout insults across the aisle at one another that is what the court has condemned this - and by the way you know just so you know our laws are the most lacks are abortion laws are the most relaxed in the world you go to Europe the left is always pointing to Europe and saying oh how wonderful they are their health care and all that stuff you know it's very very hard to get an abortion in Europe after the first trimester there's a lot of notification rules different for each country but really really different than here where basically there are no limits now these laws that Texas passed these laws to ensure that the health care in abortion clinics was up to standard these came out of the Kermit Gosnell case in 2013 and I know a little about this case because I wrote a screenplay for a movie that is still I believe in the works about the Kermit Gosnell case the guy was the worst serial killer in American history but nobody knows about him because the people he killed were babies and so that and that's why for 30 years ok 30 years Gosnell ran a clinic in Philadelphia that was a disgrace it was he had cats running around he had the cats were you know crapping all over the place there was garbage in the place he was doing abortions way way past the sell-by date for abortions which I think at the time was 24 weeks which by the way this is six months I mean it was time a six month your old baby is a baby you know that's that's really but that's what it was and what he would say it was twenty four and a half weeks he would write on his file but it was people coming in eight months he would because he didn't know what he was doing he would deliver the babies and then kill them and and many of them were alive and he was finally convicted but after 30 years and the shock I'm not gonna go into all the details because they were apps I had nightmares every day I wrote the screenplay every day I wrote the screenplay I put Michael Ramirez the great cartoonist heard I was doing this and he sent me a copy of his cartoon about this of babies in Auschwitz basically in the gospel clinic instead of Auschwitz it was the Gosnell clinic with phrase never again underneath and I hung that up in my wall and I was very very conscious every day I sat down that the spirits of these children were looking over my shoulder and you know just had to think like you got to get this right at some level at some level you got to do the best job whatever talent god gives you got to put it into this but the thing about it was and a woman died by the way precisely because he didn't have access to an emergency unit he didn't have access to the things he needed to bring her back a crash cart he didn't think the ambulance people couldn't get off the stairs because he was in this maze-like office thing but to me the nightmare is not so much the horrific and they truly are horrific details of this that was that everybody knew the other abortion providers knew the state health inspector hadn't been to inspect the place they inspect they inspect nail salons because you know the government wants to get its bribery from people and so they inspect nail salons they did not inspect his this place and when they put the state inspector on the stand at the grand jury she was like well we didn't get any complaints it was like a complaint file that went up to the sky because people were complaining all the time they knew they all knew and when he was busted and when he was arrested and when he put on trial the media shut the trial down it is very possible that you listening to this broadcast have never heard of Kermit Gosnell because they did not cover the worst serial killing case in American history they didn't cover it for the same reason the people in Philadelphia didn't do anything or inspect anything they did not want to put an undue burden on a woman to get an abortion okay that's why and finally it was Kirsten what's her name Kristen powers who is a liberal but liberal who found God which I think is called the conservative she was a but she was a liberal and she wrote for USA Today and she's pro-abortion she wrote for USA Today you guys this is this is shameful this is shameful that the press is not covering this and sort of begrudgingly they went out and covered the verdict and you know and and put it in the paper but it would never really got the coverage that any other trial where so many people had been murdered would have gotten my point is simply this okay when you have a bad idea you know when I hear this case part of me thinks like you know a lot of people get upset and they say well you know they're getting in the way of the states right to make health decisions they're getting in the right of women's rights to be taken care of properly at abortion clinics but part of me thinks you know once you say that it's all right to kill a child what difference does it make with you do it in a hospital or an abattoir you know I mean what difference does it make you know it's it's your gonna be doing it anyway the problem is the idea the under wine idea beneath this thing I don't know week ago I was talking I get so much flak every time I did this I was talking about Jesus and forgiveness in my sense that sometimes some Christians go out of their way to find out loopholes through the judge not the you know let he is without sin hurled the first stone I feel that people are very quick to grab hold of excuses to pass judgment on people but very quick to find loopholes in the command to not judge one another and I was saying as I was talking about this that if you look into the faces of the people around you you will see if you look deeply into them you will see that every one of us carries with us a burden of a burden of the knowledge that we are not what we should be every single one of us and if you face that and if you go to God for forgiveness you get to the truth you get to the truth about yourself it's painful but it also leads you to a higher plane if you don't face it you have to completely manipulate your entire moral worldview to erase the shame that you're hiding from yourself and we all do this in some ways but the Christian idea in my opinion is to look at the ways that we do that so that we can guide ourselves back to that North Star of true morality even though we're far away from it at least we're heading in the right direction you know I used to read books for the blind you know it was a volunteer thing where you would go in I'm a professional reader so I thought that was a good way to volunteer some time you go in and read book but they just hand you the book that readers send in because they're blind they can't read it and there may not be available on audible so you're reading these technical books and all this and one day I was reading a book of ethical essays and I got the essay by this guy Peter Singer an Australian moral philosopher who teaches bioethics at Princeton University and he basically believes in infanticide okay and he says no here's a quote form this is a quote newborn human babies have no sense of their own existence over time so killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person that is a being who wants to go on living that doesn't mean that it's not almost always a terrible thing to do it is but it's a terrible thing to do because most infants are loved and cherished by their parents and to kill an infant is usually to do a great wrong to its parents now I was thinking to myself how can I read this how can I you know do this but then I said no if you're blind and you want to read this book you have a right to read it I'm here as an impartial person just doing but it was like me you're in a little studio about the size of a you know of an outhouse basically and I thought it was like being locked in a studio with a psychic because the guy has to look he says he says a newborn baby has no sense of its own existence over time that's true of you when you're asleep on that logic on Peter singers logic when you're asleep I could come in and kill you because you have no desires you have no preferences you don't know where you are I can kill you but of course the answer to that is eventually you wake up because we live in time we don't just you know man is not just who he is at that moment he is who he was if I committed a murder 20 years ago and went on to live a blameless life I'm still guilty I'm still that guy you know you can't erase that stuff and you're also who you will become that undifferentiated group of cells in a mother's body yeah that what the left keeps going the undifferentiated group of cells is the same person who will sing opera or bake cakes or play baseball or do all those things it's the same person because they live in time and the thing that really disturbs me about this is I'm just a bigger foot teller of tales I'm a mystery story writer this guy's a bioethicists at Princeton I'm so right and he's so wrong and it's so easy to argue with him that only this polluted idea at the core that's come to be at the core of the left's philosophy could twist his mind so much that he can't see what a dumb mystery writer you can't see so clearly and this is my problem with the Supreme Court you know it's not it's not the courts fault that they are now twisted into this moral logic I mean it is the Supreme Court's fault in a way but it is the fault of this philosophy and I think that in order to win back our country we really have to get an amendment over the long term to the Constitution to nullify the courts power to say to the court you can make decisions but 2/3 of the states can override your decisions or something like that because otherwise we've got these five guys perpetuating this twisted twisted idea all right from that to stuff I like and I've been doing because of the brexit to celebrate the brexit I've been doing British films that are among the greatest of all time can't go out without mentioning Lawrence of Arabia just a brilliant brilliant scene here's the scene where the guy comes and tells Lawrence that he's being sent into the desert and the heat and Peter O'Toole playing Lawrence of Arabia Claude Rains playing the ambassador this is their exchange anywhere within 300 miles of Edina there are passionate bitter winds they can cross 60 miles of desert in a day of thanks Frank is going to be fun Lana's only two kinds of creature get fun of the desert better wins and guards and you're neither take it from me for ordinary men it's a burning fiery furnace now driving it's going to be fun it is recognized but you have a funny so Lawrence lights this match and he has a habit of lighting matches and holding them till they burn down to his fingers to prove that he can do it and somebody says what's the trick and he says the trick is not minding and the way the film works is he lights this match and he holds it and he blows it out and the next cut takes you to this fiery Sun coming up over the desert and remember he says it's going to be fun it's going to be fun to go and he realized that he is a masochist and that is he's a sexual masochist as it turns out later in the film and he's a masochist in other ways and he has this godlike sense of himself that mixes with his mask him every shot in the film shows you how his personal inner life is imposing itself on world history and it's a brilliant brilliant brilliant film that's constructed both of language and of imagery it's worth watching on the biggest screen you can find because it's all so beautiful all right we have so much more to talk about but luckily we have two more days tomorrow is the mail bag one of my favorite things hooray so get your questions in now and subscribe and get even more questions in I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we will back to be back again tomorrow
