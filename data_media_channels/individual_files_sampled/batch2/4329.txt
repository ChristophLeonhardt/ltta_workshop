my panel in former US ambassador Chris Hill political White House reporter Annie Carney and Bobby Ghosh a foreign affairs analyst ambassador I want to start with you what is your take on the significance of this well obviously it's very significant insofar as the fact has been for decades this was Jerusalem was to be Israel's capital the issue of course is it was to be Israel's capital in the context of an overall agreement a so-called final status agreement in which everybody accepted all the other elements of the agreement there was a perception that everyone got something out of it instead it's been kind of put up to the front by a president who feels very strongly about when he said something in the campaign he wants to follow it up as president the context of course has been that no one else recognizes this all the European allies have stayed away another blow to the transatlantic relationship and of course these tragic deaths of Palestinians on the ground as they try to walk from Gaza into Israel so overall sadly which should be a very happy day and something to which Israel is entitled has become a very tragic and very sad day brought on by in my view very poor policy and as we just saw there in the front row you have first daughter Ivanka Trump senior advisor to the president and her husband Jared Kushner Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and I also saw just a few seats down GOP mega donor Sheldon Adelson who as we know very very very much wanted this to happen Bobby can the United States still be an honest broker in terms of helping seek peace in the Middle East after this I mean they have clearly shown Israel is a priority for them Benjamin Netanyahu has a very good relationship with the president has had a relationship with the Kushner family for years and years he used to stay in their home in Livingston New Jersey I want to say in Jarrod's childhood bedroom well this administration certainly has lost any credibility as a potential honest broker many American administrations have been pronounced have a pronounced pro-israel slant many candidates in the past have said during an election campaign that they would like to see the American Embassy in Jerusalem the Trump administration has gone much farther than anybody else and for the reasons that you just said I don't think this administration is going to be regarded as an honest maker and you know what I don't think they think of themselves as an honest broker certainly their behavior doesn't suggest it there does not seem to be any attempt to broker anything there seems to be you need lateral steps being taken and this is the most unilateral thing you can do try to change the reality on the ground by by putting the embassy there as if that's going to change the political realities and they're not the fact is that very large numbers of Palestinians live in what is now Israel and they have a point of view and their point of view has not been taken into account and what should have been a joyous day what should have been a day culminating years and years of negotiations and broad acceptance across Israel and Palestine across the Middle East instead is a day that that will forever be remembered in the context of what's also going on on the other side of that wall in Gaza dozens of people being killed that's that's not I think how many Israeli saw this day coming actually what is it like for Israelis day in and day out ambassador for those living in the country going to work today going to school how big of a deal is it yes I think it's a very big deal for many Israelis I mean after all when the Jewish state was formed it was always understood in Israel this is the capital and the issue is to make the rest of the world understand it but it was also understood that this would be a so-called final settlement agreement so I think every Israeli has believed for many many years that Jerusalem is their capital the issue is to get international acceptance certainly u.s. acceptance is one thing but to have no one else being participating in this turns it into very much of a Pyrrhic victory so I suspect for many Israelis looking at this violence on the streets it's a day of great ends anxiety Annie how big of a deal is this for president Trump and his legacy moving the embassy was a campaign promise he's fulfilling it's huge in terms of his legacy and Jared Kushner was pushing for this behind the scenes Sheldon Adelson was a big player in making this decision took out a big full-page ad in The New York Times when they announced it saying President Trump you promised you delivered and I think that the administration sees the violence that is on half the screen right now as something that's going to occur over two days but then in the larger scale historically this will be a historic win for them trumpet as your guests have said is delivering on something that many presidents before him have promised but failed to follow through with so I think they see this violence as short-term and the move as a long-term win well Bobby the president says this helps negotiations because doing this was the hardest part and now that's off the table that's the whole point of brokers brokers don't do this this is between the parties that are discussing the negotiations they get to decide this the broker doesn't unilaterally take issues off the bay they get to decide this but I haven't they haven't but this was meant to be the last step this was meant to be as a mass of the hill pointed out the the end of negotiations this was supposed to be the most peaceful thing that's possible we're seeing these two sets of images on the screen now and that's that's telling us that that dream of of a settlement is now blown to bits and this violence is not going to end after two days one spasm might end although I suspect it will go on for much more than two days now one spasm might end but it's not going to end the way the Palestinians feel about it and the way they've been treated this is going to go on for a very long time you cannot simply will things to change by making these sort of unilateral steps nobody else is brought into this it's not just that the Palestinians have not got into this the the Jordanians haven't they the Arab states haven't bought into this the AB states are ambiguous about how they feel about the Palestinians the Palestinians don't have a lot of support there right now but at the same time no Arab state is willing to accept Jerusalem as a country it's not just the Israelis and the Palestinians involved ambassador talked about the violence in Gaza and do you think it could have a ripple effect elsewhere and I asked because for those Americans who say Gaza Palestinians not my problem I'm just trying to get health care get my kids in a good school and have a good life so for Americans who have that perspective why should the violence in Gaza matter to them to be sure over the years there's been a tendency to associate the Palestinian cause as something the rest of the Arab world was utterly seized about but in fact of course we know especially from the Arab Spring that Israel and Palestine those are not the only issues that drive problems in the in the Arab world all that said I think there will be a sense of added humiliation within the Arab world not just among the Palestinians and those residents of Gaza but also in the rest of the Arab world a sense that something was forced on them without any process in their view and I think this this sense of resentment will in fact make it very difficult for the u.s. to consider it to continue to be an honest broker hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to
