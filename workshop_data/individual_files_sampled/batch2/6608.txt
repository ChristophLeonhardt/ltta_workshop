Fox News recently had a segment featuring Jesse Watters and he was talking about something that was going viral online so I'm not gonna give a lot of weight let's just go ahead and toss the video and then I'll fill you in on the details I've seen some amazing things out there just looking at television over the weekend alligators on people's back doorsteps I saw a shark on a highway swimming in the water heater like sharknado I saw a hawk sitting in someone's taxicab Greg and I were saying you know the president was using the term biblical well there's some really weird biblical things that are going on down there in Houston so he was talking about a photo of a photoshopped shark swimming in a flooded freeway okay funny enough oh is this the shark is it sharknado funny enough it was the same shark that was used in Photoshop after Hurricane Katrina and of course it was debunked everyone knew that this particular story had already been debunked and Jesse waters reported it because hey biblical things are happening biblical things are happened they won't believe climate change right they don't they think climate change is a hoax even though there's scientific evidence indicating that it's happening and it's man-made but there's a shark swimming allegedly a shark swimming in the highway walk in a cab and you're and then it's the Bible right that was one of my favorite passages in the Bible of the Hulk and the cab passage I just know I was even because the lot of the headlines on this were dummy Jesse Watters bought that gimmick right and I'm every year you hate April Fool's Day of all holidays holidays because if we do the show on the day you're like I can't read a news because you know 30% of it is BS right and so I've never been one to be like are you in for the hoax you do see the hoax whatever man I didn't see it I don't care I'm gonna read everything you read right so I was willing to give him a pass on that then he decided to go with biblical proportions which now means the shark swimming in the water like you said the hawk in the cab I read about it you heathen I read about it back when I was in church and the alligators dude you down in the South by the Gulf Coast it's like say man we're in Louisiana I heard there was Gators out here right come on of course there are so anyway the Navigator is there before the flood the biblical proportions when it has to be the call how God has come in and told the hawk to get the hell out of the hurricane by diving into a cab that's a smart hook you get the hell out of the weather so it's it they want it to be bigger and more I guess prophetic than what it could be for what purpose I don't want to continue to tell the viewers hey God is coming and he's looking in to Houston right now well it's confirmation bias right so if you're if you're the type of person who tends to believe something crazy then you'll see something even if it's a hoax and if it meets your bias then you'll you're more likely to believe it at least that's what I think but anyway he realized that he had made a mistake he had fallen for the hoax and so he did apologize profusely it's just interesting because all the news outlets that get criticized for being fake news are the ones that tend to criticize Trump you know in a justified fashion yeah but Fox News never gets called fake News by Donald Trump right their credibility has never called into question and this story you know really makes me realize that yeah I mean crispr ronnie was on CNN last night the guy who publishes Newsmax and he was talking to Don Lemon and they were they were having sort of a somewhat highbrow conversation about what fake news is and Don Lemon did a great job and I don't always defend Don lemons work but he did a great job kind of defending the selective you know the selective criticism that you were just talking about by the president of of CNN versus Fox News and and it's true I mean there is an unbelievable bias that they have but they will wipe it clean when it comes to the people that like him exactly if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch it without ads if you become a member TYT Network comm /join
