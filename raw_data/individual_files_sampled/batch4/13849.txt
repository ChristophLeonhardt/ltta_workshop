on Friday night ailing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton spoke at a fundraiser where she said quote to be grossly generalistic you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorable right racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic you name it and unfortunately there are people like that and he has lifted them up he has given voice to their web sites that used to have only eleven thousand people now have 11 million he tweets and retweets offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric Hillary tried to walk back this floor afterward she said quote last night I was grossly generalistic and that's never a good idea I regret saying half that was wrong Donald Trump immediately responded correctly quote isn't it disgraceful that Hillary Clinton makes the worst mistake of the political season and instead of owning up to this grotesque attack on American voters she tries to turn it around with a pathetic rehash of the words and insults used in her campaign for the first time in a long time her true feelings came out showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans the media have covered Hillary's comments with kid gloves they certainly never used with Mitt Romney who infamously stated that there were 47 percent of people who are with Obama dependence on government believe their victims believe the government has a responsibility to care for them who believe they're entitled to health care to food to housing to you name it that of course is because Hillary is a Democrat which means you can rip Americans as closeted bigots and she can get away with it Democrats are all hard-working folks who never suffer from a victim mentality Republicans however are all terribly evil Hillary is simply saying what Democrats actually think about Americans who don't vote Democrat were morally inferior humans the great surprise of Hillary's all right speech several weeks ago came when she specifically disassociated conservatives from the alt-right lunatics who rapidly support Trump it turns out that was a politically motivated lie it was a blackmail offer to slice off conservatives from the alt-right if they just dumped Trump in reality however Hillary thinks anyone who votes for Trump even as a mere instrument to stop her from gaining high office is a racist sexist homophobic bigot that's how the Left justifies its dishonesty and its nastiness and the fact that it always routinely victimizes Americans in order to serve its own political purpose you are the bad guy now that's not to say the alt-right isn't terrible they are they're a fringe element though in Trump support even if they carry outsized weight in Trump's political calculation no more than 5% of trumps base actually alright and that's a real upper end estimate but for hillary everyone on the right is alright i'm alright you're alright we're all out right that's what makes it okay for her to lie to get ahead because bad people deserve to be lied about and also to hillary can apologize for being generalistic but her entire campaign is based on that generalization just as the entire democratic party relies on that generalization the moment americans realize the basket of deplorable is a giant giant lie democrats can't win elections anymore i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show alrighty folks so we're back and as you can tell my voice is still a little bit gone so you'll have to bear with me if I'm taking sips of water and such and and the stain on my shirt is due to a baby spitting up on me because I'm a wonderful father as well as a brilliant host so just excusing my own slavish Ness on the fact that on the fact that I am the world's greatest human so in any case we have to start off by thanking our one of our new sponsors Boland branch these people make the greatest sheets in the world I'm not kidding the Boland branch makes fantastic sheets they we have them on our bed at home I'm very very picky about what I sleep on apparently three ex-presidents sleep on Boland branch and a slew of celebrities one of those ex presidents is Bill Clinton so some of the celebrities in Bill Clinton actually share a set of Bolin branch sheets and apparently they all liked it but Beau and branch is this plate you go online and you tell them kind of what what kind of sheets you want you go to bolt and branch calm and you get them really cheap they make sheets to blankets made from pure 100% organic cotton they're super soft and they're much cheaper than anything else it's like 150 bucks for a couple hundred bucks for some luxury sheets that normally would cost a thousand dollars and if you don't know what a luxury sheet feels like you really need to get these because it's not thread count it's like I thought it was just thread counts I'd go to the gas station and pick up sheet see let's say like a thousand thread count yeah just oh that means it's off no that means it's a tarp so it has nothing to do with it but Boleyn branch sheets I I've slept on them so I can tell you personally they're great if you want to try them go to bowl at branch comm bowl and branch calm promo code Ben and get $50 off your first set of sheets which is a pretty good bargain so you can for like 150 bucks instead of 200 bucks so again that's bowl and branch Bo ll and komm promo code ben and make sure you use the promo code ben's they know that we sent you and that way they continue to affiliate with us which is good for you it's good for us and it means that we can continue to provide the show and provide employment to the rest of these deplorable x' who work for us okay so obviously big news over the weekend big news over the weekend first of all I just have to preface the big news over the weekend with the fact that Hillary Clinton has a problem and that is that one of her big feels is that she is very strong it's not just that she claims that she's a normal woman she claims she's superhuman so for example Hillary Clinton just last week just last week she said the Donald Trump rejects phony strength here's what she said people when they're afraid like and need the idea of a strong leader what do you say to the supporters of him who resonate with that message well there's phony strength and there's real strength and it's phony strength to not know what you're talking about and to make outrageous statements that will actually make our job harder no matter how in the moment it sounds real strength is leveling with the American people oh and making it clear we will defeat Isis ok real strength is not lying to people and also not being a dead body on CNN so so over the weekend we actually did we have exclusive footage you've seen a bunch of angles of Hillary Clinton falling over if you haven't seen that by now we'll show you in just a minute but but we have exclusive footage of Hillary Clinton to 9/11 Memorial yesterday here's what it went poorly so so after that they actually they took Hillary and they threw her into a van and they drove her off and then here's what happened next something has happened to the press about Vice President the Vice President is mentally unbalanced this is legal oh yeah probably losing something yes suddenly dave has a great job I can't tell you the whole story he's not a national emergency kind of thing but you got to help me cut the budget a little you've got to cut the budget okay great so and and and that's how Kate McKinnon ended up as president basically Hillary Clinton apparently was taken away where she perished and the and the democratic establishment desperately attempted to to get Kate McKinnon on the phone so they could substitute her in to run for the rest of the primary okay so that's not actually here's what actually happened here's the tape of Hillary Clinton yesterday so remember the run-up to all of this is that Hillary went on coughing jag like a week and a half ago we played it for four minutes she's coughing by the way my wife who's a doctor when she saw that she said looks like pneumonia to me but Hillary Clinton said nothing wrong with me it's just allergies then she goes on and she campaigns and and and remember the media was saying anybody who has even mild questions about her health as a sexist chris chiles a of the Washington Post wrote a piece five days ago five days ago in which he said you must stop asking questions about Hillary's health there's nothing there there's no reason to ask questions about Hillary Clinton's health and then this happened on Sunday this is at the 9/11 memorial it was 75 degrees in breezy outside she's not dancing gang she is wobbling because she's falling over and down she goes and they take her and they then proceed to shovel her in the van like Freddie gray in the back of a Baltimore police van and then they speed off and they leave the media behind and then after that you know so this is that all that happens and and what will add a closer angle this was slightly suspicious they say that this is glasses funneling out of her pants but look at her right leg okay look at her right leg in this particular video they said they slowed it down so you can see okay something fell out of her leg pant leg right there and you don't know what it is see there we go and doink something falls down people said it was her glasses okay maybe it's her glasses maybe it's not every conspiracy theory is now at least tenable because Hillary is lying about her health and we know she's lying about her health I mean remember just five minutes ago Hillary had her coughing jag and if you don't recall this is gross folks and prepare yourself for eating breakfast or lunch this is what Hillary Clinton did the other just last week when she got into her coughing jag and took a glass of water yeah that is some yucky stuff falling right in the glass from Hillary's face so again something is wrong with Hillary Hillary is sick okay she's sick so they drive her off and the media don't even cover this only Fox News covers this and the only reason they cover it is because one they have a reporter on the ground and two these angles that we're seeing they're not coming from members in the news media they're coming from civilians so if this had not been caught on tape you know Hillary would have lied about it you know that the Clinton campaign that the media they would have said how dare you imply anything happened this is all just conspiracy theory nonsense no way any of this happen it just can't have happen you must be crazy they caught it on tape so they shove her in the van like a sack of old turnips and then they drive off and they leave her shoe behind she's like she's like old frail dying Cinderella they leave her shoe behind and then YPD has to come back and grab it and take it to her later and and fit it back on her foot so she they they take her away and we don't know where she goes for like an hour we have no clue where she went and then they released a statement don't worry she didn't go to the hospital she went to Chelsea Clinton's apartment okay now let me tell you something if my mom come out in sixty if she collapsed and they shoved her in a van I hope they're going to the hospital because that's a bad thing I wouldn't say take her my house I'd say take her to the hospital so she can get hydrated or something they figured that he'll see Chelsea Clinton's because they're trying to claim no no big deal they say she overheated and then the media start claiming that this is you know Manoa that this is like that it's the hottest place on earth it's so humid it's so hot it's like the bowels of hell and it was the bowels of hell in New York City yesterday I know a bunch of people in New York City yesterday they're out having a good time walking their dogs apparently was really nice yesterday it was like mid-70s 10 and 40 percent humidity it was actually the coolest day of the weekend and they were claiming that no no Hillary she was brave for even going out there now nobody bothers to ask so how many people so how many people actually fainted like Hillary how many people just collapse like Hillary then bother asking that they also claimed that Hillary stumbled cuz you didn't stumble when you look at the tape she's wobbling wobbling she's not moving stumble implies I take a step forward and trip over over somebody unless she tripped over her on B's ghost she can trip over anybody because she lost control over her legs and she lost control of her consciousness and she fell over so they take her away and then we find out she's at Chelsea's and then she emerges from Chelsea's she emerges from Chelsea's and she comes out and a little girl breaks through Secret Service and runs up to her for a hug now let me tell you some about Secret Service you don't break through a Secret Service okay this is what we call a pre-planned photo-op so she walks out and this little girl breaks through and gives Hillary a big hug huh you're a member of the media Oh for Christ's sake do they know how ridiculous this is and the little girl comes out in Hilary's out waving to the crowd then she gets back in that van she goes up to Chappaqua she cancels her events for the next couple days so what happened well hours later they say what actually happened is that she's been coughing because of allergies but she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday but she's on antibiotics and then she was overheated on Sunday okay none of this makes any sense okay that cough was not allergies there was that the media were on top of her on Friday I'm not sure when she had time to go to the doctor to be diagnosed with pneumonia and then they came out with another story later in the day where they said there's this virulent contagious disease basically this virus that is struck down half of Hillary's staff is struck down half her staff Robby Mook had to go to the hospital which begs one question which is so you've got patient zero in the stand over here hugging a small child knowing she's contagious a nil right I'm ill you know what I do and I'm ill I sleep in a different room than my wife and I sleep in a different room than my kids because I don't want them to get sick Hillary Clinton says well as long as I'm not gonna suck out the soul of the child I may as well get the kids sick with pneumonia like where are the parents you think the parents feel good about that yeah honey go on hug hug the old lady who's disease-ridden the great idea what a great idea so it's gonna be it is going to be the height of irony when our decisions about who to vote for are completely decided by the fact that Hillary was again patient zero in some sort of tragic epidemic that wipes out three-quarters of the American population but what was amazing about that there are few things that are amazing about this one Hillary's deeply dishonest she lies about everything so people were theorizing that she has Parkinson's disease people were theorizing that she's got the bubonic plague people were theorizing that she's got and that she's got pneumonia as a secondary infection from some of something else right people are theorizing all of this and before that was all conspiracy theory crap now you can't believe anything Hillary says you can't believe a word that comes out of their mouths and she's still not releasing her full medical records so we're gonna continue in just a second what by explaining and what the media did about that because that's the other there are three big stories here one is Hillary's giant Liars he can't believe anything she says too is because she's liar she may in fact be a walking corpse any minute she may reanimate and start trying to eat people's brains it's possible and third the media are just you can't believe anything the media tell you so this makes people crazy this makes people nuts but first we have to say thank you to our
