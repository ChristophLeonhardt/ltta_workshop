I will be asking mr. secretary what are you hiding I'll be calling on the secretary to explain to the American people under oath where these children are right now and where their parents are I'm giving this advance notice to secretary a czar so that he's going to have plenty of time to find the answer we still don't know Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida says he will demand answers about the children when health and human services secretary Alex a czar at the top official at the Department charged with reunited you reuniting the families is scheduled to appear before the Senate Finance Committee this morning to discuss prescription drugs so that's a good warning we're really interested in the answer to that question joining us now senator Nelson's Republican colleague in the house Congressman Carlos Cabello of Florida yesterday congressman Cabella toured a facility run by the Archdiocese of Miami that is currently housing some of the children separated from their parents as well as children who crossed into the country alone thanks very much for being on the show sir good morning mica thank you tell us what you saw how many children were you able to see what are the conditions like what are the questions that you had about them well thank you mica and to Senator Nelson's point yesterday I did see 70 of these children 22 of them were actually separated from their families at the border the other 50 or so came across the border unaccompanied they were a little older and I can tell you that we should be very grateful to Catholic Charities and to the Archdiocese of Miami the images we've seen over the last few weeks have been very difficult very painful the images what I witnessed yesterday at this shelter was truly uplifting the children all had toys they had colorful bedspreads a small group of small children was on their way to the Seaquarium they were smiling we were able to ask them questions we were able to interact with them and I looked at that and I said this is who we are as a nation coincidentally that's the same shelter that some 60 years ago welcomed a Cuban exile children who we're only expecting to be there for a few months and ended up staying in the country forever for the most so constant let me ask you how old were the children who had been separated 22 they're their parents at 22 the youngest little girl that I spoke to was five years old and you could tell that they had gone through a difficult experience but you could also tell that they were being treated with extraordinary kindness that they were seeing things that they had probably never seen in their lives they were living in air conditioning I'm sure most of those children had never experienced that and they were getting to see my town the city of Miami so we we know that these children will soon be reunited with their families we can't congressman do we know that because obviously for any five-year-old even if you take them to the Super Bowl I know you agree and I don't anybody to mystery what you're saying here I mean you would agree would you not that that's absolutely right this is an extraordinary traumatic painful experience for five-year-old rip from their mother's arms you agree with that first of all correct of course I strongly oppose that policy saying what I can tell you Joe is that some of the staff from the Archdiocese of Miami told us that already some of the children who were there were on their way to being reunited so we know that process the process is started in and do you have any information that could help us out on the the what you said regarding that you said we know that all of these children will be united with their parents that would be very good news if you have information that we don't last week last week I met here in the capital with secretary Neilson Department of Homeland Security and she assured me that as soon as the parents were back in her custody because remember they were going from Department of Justice back to Department of Homeland Security then the reunification process could begin and I was happy to learn at this facility yesterday that indeed some children's parents had already been released back to the department of homeland security and those children were up were on their way already to being reunited with their parents and this is what we have always said we must find the balance between enforcing our country's immigration laws because we cannot be a lawless country that is true but we also cannot traumatize children in this way and we have to keep families together as much as possible Congressman Steve Schmidt good morning I'm gonna I'm gonna have you a US or no question here I appreciate your evangelism for Catholic Charities but I may ask you a question as a political leader or a member of Congress is this policy of moral and cruel yes or no I believe so and I've spoken out against it since day one so when we hear Mike Pence for example say in his platitudes to the country I'm a Christian I'm a conservative I'm a Republican in that order why shouldn't I think he's a fraud well you you can think whatever you want about whoever you want I can speak for myself and I can tell you that I found that policy to be completely objectionable wrong immoral unnecessary and look at what happened the American people spoke out members of Congress from both parties spoke out and the administration backed off this is the way it's supposed to work that's something we should celebrate it does not happen that way in Cuba it does not happen that way in Venezuela or Russia so this is a difficult situation but at the end I think most Americans got the result that we wanted which was to stop this and and congressmen again again just to underline the fact you've spoken out forcefully against this policy from day one let me ask you about the fixes and people are talking about getting rid of Florida so the children can stay with the parents even if they're incarcerated for more than 20 days that obviously has issues Ted Cruz has talked about sending more lawyers down there actually something that I think is a good idea so you can process these and hopefully quickly big enough be able to turn them around in twenty days what legislation do you see passing that has an opportunity to fix this problem so we don't ever see this happening again well what we need to do is empower the government to both be compassionate to those who are coming to our country because we know most of them and and don't get me wrong if you're a drug dealer or a human trafficker a gang member I think you should be met with the full force of the law but if you are a family that is fleeing violence or looking for an opportunity to work in our country it does not mean that we should just announce that everyone who's in that situation will be allowed into the country but we should have some discretion some kindness and compassion and those families should be kept together while their cases are being adjudicated in addition to that yes I do think we need more judges and we have to prioritize these cases if an undocumented immigrant came alone and as an adult well we'll give that case a lesser priority if it's a family unit two parents and two small children let's put that case up at the top of the pile get it processed and ads adjudicated so that the family won't be in detention past a couple weeks or three weeks all right congressman Carlos Cabella thank you very much for being on the show we approach where honesty on the 'allah see especially thank you so much coming in great to have you with us I just I just real quickly went under like Mike Pence says he's a Christian first that's fantastic I'm sure he is I do wonder if he has Jefferson's Bible if he's cut out Matthew 25 if he's cut out the part where Jesus actually has asked by disciples who is going to be able to sit on your right hand and who's going to be cast away and Jesus goes through the list and he talks about anyone that does this for the least among us is doing it to me they will be with a sheep those who don't will be tossed out will be with the goats I mean it's it's a straight forward it's the red letters in the New Testament it is one of the few times where Jesus says and I I'm not a theologian my parents did make me go to Baptist churches four times a week for about 21 years it didn't take but I do remember a lot of Bible verses it is one of the few times in the New Testament where Jesus doesn't say we are saved by faith and we are saved by grace which we are it's one of the few times that Jesus says this is what you have to do to get to heaven and if you don't do it you will not get to heaven one of the few times he says this is it and it is giving a cup of water and the Masters name feeding the hungry clothing the naked visiting those in prison and and again helping the least among us I mean the extraordinary all I am doing here by the way deagle a messenger this is Jesus talk the extraordinary and astounding hypocrisy of it to see the constancy of the assertion of Christian virtue by political leaders in this country who have established internment camps for babies and toddlers and by the way and I never in a million years thought I would sit here or anywhere and say this but the difference now between Venezuela and Cuba and the United States is this Venezuela in Cuba or the countries without internment camps for babies and toddlers still ahead on Morning Joe NBC's Mariana Atencio introduces us to a woman who has
