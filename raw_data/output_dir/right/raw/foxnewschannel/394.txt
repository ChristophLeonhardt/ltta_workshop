1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,447
THIS WEEKEND?

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:04,148
>> GOOD MORNING.

3
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:04,615
TWO THINGS.

4
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:06,717
FIRST OF ALL YOU'LL SEE A REAL

5
00:00:06,718 --> 00:00:09,020
FULL-COURT PRESS BY WHITE HOUSE

6
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:09,487
OFFICIALS.

7
00:00:09,488 --> 00:00:11,255
A LOT OF AVAILABILITY AND SOUND

8
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:12,790
IN SUPPORT NOT JUST OF THE

9
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,292
JUDGE, BUT ALSO IN SUPPORT OF

10
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:16,060
THOSE WHO MAY BE ON THE FENCE

11
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:16,661
IN THE SENATE.

12
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:17,829
I THINK THE SECOND THING IS

13
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,096
REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL.

14
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:20,998
YOU WILL SEE A BIT OF A

15
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:24,702
RELIANCE ON THE F.B.I. REPORT

16
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:25,870
AGAIN TO BOLSTER THE ARGUMENT.

17
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:28,005
A MAN WHO SERVED ON THE BENCH

18
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:29,840
MORE THAN TWO DECADES SHOULD

19
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:33,110
NOT HAVE THIS ALLEGATION AND AN

20
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:33,878
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION KEEP

21
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,079
HIM FROM SERVING ON THE U.S.

22
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,546
SUPREME COURT.

23
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:36,947
THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT

24
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:38,582
IT ONCE AGAIN THIS MORNING.

25
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,516
HE SAID THIS.

26
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:41,185
THE HARSH AND UNFAIR TREATMENT

27
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:43,520
OF JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS

28
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,889
HAVING AN INCREDIBLE -- AN

29
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,291
INCREDIBLE UPWARD IMPACT ON

30
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:47,758
VOTERS.

31
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,094
THE PEOPLE GET IT FAR BETTER

32
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,495
THAN MOST POLITICIANS.

33
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,363
MORE IMPORTANTLY OR MOST

34
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:54,765
IMPORTANTLY, THIS GREAT LIFE

35
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:58,302
CANNOT BE RUINED BY MEAN AND

36
00:00:58,303 --> 00:00:59,937
DESPICABLE DEMOCRATS AND

37
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:00,537
TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED

38
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:00,938
ALLEGATIONS.

39
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:01,805
THERE YOU SEE IT RIGHT THERE.

40
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,674
TO BE SURE, THERE IS A

41
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:05,542
POLITICAL ASPECT TO THIS

42
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,477
CONFIRMATION BATTLE.

43
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:07,911
BUT I THINK MORE CRUCIALLY THE

44
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:09,980
ARGUMENT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

45
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:11,148
OF DAYS, BILL, WILL BE ABOUT

46
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:12,583
THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT AND

47
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:13,750
THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCESS

48
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,619
WHICH IS INCLUDED, AS YOU KNOW,

49
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,155
A BEVY OF LATE ALLEGATIONS AND

50
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:20,524
QUESTIONS ABOUT JUDGE

51
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:21,191
KAVANAUGH'S FITNESS.

52
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:24,227
>> ALL THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS

53
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:24,928
GET THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED

54
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,363
THROUGHOUT ONE'S CAREER.

55
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:27,965
HE HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH SOME

56
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:29,366
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN

57
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,501
GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST 25

58
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:33,003
YEARS WITH A VERY HIGH-PROFILE

59
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:33,337
CAREER.

60
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:34,938
AND ALL THE FOLKS THAT ARE

61
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:36,406
DEMANDING THIS TYPE OF AN

62
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:39,943
INVESTIGATION IN THE SENATE ARE

63
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:41,912
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE ALREADY

64
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:42,946
PLEDGED TO VOTE NO.

65
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:46,383
THEY WANT TO DELAY THE PROCESS.

66
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,118
>> THAT IS RAJ SHAH.

67
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,186
WE ANTICIPATE GETTING MORE

68
00:01:49,187 --> 00:01:50,587
SOUND WITH HIM AND GRABBED HIM

69
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:52,489
ON HIS WAY AFTER THAT INTERVIEW.

70
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,825
AS I GET MORE SOUND I'LL PASS

71
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:55,225
THAT ALONG.

72
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:57,160
WE CAN ALWAYS TELL YOU THIS,

73
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,795
THE PRESIDENT GOT THE REPORT --

74
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:00,664
THE WHITE HOUSE GOT THE REPORT

75
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,299
AFTER 3:00 A.M. THIS MORNING.

76
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,467
WE DO KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS

77
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:04,635
BEEN BRIEFED ON IT, BILL.

78
00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:06,036
WE DON'T BELIEVE HE HAS

79
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:10,107
ACTUALLY READ IT HIMSELF YET.

80
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:12,409
>> Bill: WE HEARD THE F.B.I.

81
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,810
REACHED OUT TO NINE INDIVIDUALS.

82
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:17,381
FORD IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

83
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:20,150
HER TEAM ISN'T HAPPY WITH THAT.

84
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,585
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE

85
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:22,753
CHARACTERIZING THAT, KEVIN?

86
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:26,489
>> YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD

87
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,358
FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE DR. FORD

88
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:28,925
HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY

89
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:30,227
INTERVIEWED FOR THE WORLD TO

90
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:33,063
SEE UNDER OATH ON CAPITOL HILL.

91
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,464
SO GIVEN THAT, IT'S IMPORTANT,

92
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:36,333
THEY SAY, TO ALLOW THE F.B.I.

93
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:37,968
TO SORT OF UNPACK OTHER

94
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,836
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT

95
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:40,303
THERE.

96
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:43,373
THE BUREAU COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO

97
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,108
INTERVIEW HER, THEY DID NOT.

98
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:47,777
ABOUT WHICH HER LAWYER SAID

99
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:48,511
THIS.

100
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,446
AN F.B.I. SUPPLEMENTAL

101
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,047
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION THAT

102
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:52,215
DIDN'T INCLUDE AN INTERVIEWED

103
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,317
OF FORD OR WITNESSES WHO

104
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:55,351
CORROBORATE HER TESTIMONY CAN'T

105
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:57,353
BE CALLED AN INVESTIGATION.

106
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:59,022
WE'RE PROFOUNDLY DISAPPOINTED

107
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:00,657
THAT AFTER THE TREMENDOUS

108
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,058
SACRIFICE SHE MADE IN COMING

109
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,693
FORWARD THOSE DIRECTING THE

110
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:05,095
F.B.I. INVESTIGATION WERE NOT

111
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:07,430
INTERESTED IN SEEKING THE TRUTH.

112
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:08,598
IT IS EXPECTED, BILL, THAT THE

113
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,299
PRESIDENT WILL GET AN

114
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,634
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT

115
00:03:11,635 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT REPORT FIRSTHAND HERE THIS
