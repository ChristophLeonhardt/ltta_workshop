skydiving is something that I really enjoyed and the SEAL team I attempted to transition to military from military skydiving to get my civilian rating and it was just an awkward scary process I remember going down to the drop zone in San Diego I'm getting checked in and then the guy that that comes in and it's supposed to sign me off and do I think it was like five jumps and he comes in and looked like he just did a big bong rip in the back and yeah I'm going really is this is this what it's come down to so I get my shoot which is a little bit different than the military I get it on and you know the planes doing laps and picking people up and he says hey you're ready to go bro and I said yeah we're good he's I was like but aren't you gonna check me he's like oh you look good man and I'm thinking to myself at that point wow this is crazy if we were in the military to go on a skydive we would suit up I would get a seal a fellow seal skydiver to check me he would go through and check all my straps my altimeter my pins in the back my safety device it's gonna fire if if you don't pull at a certain altitude and then I would check him so here I am into the San Diego drop zone with this stoner guy that's about to take me jumping and he's like yeah bro you're good and I was like okay he didn't even look at me and at that point I was like you know trying to like double check myself plus the planes are really cramped and I'm used to like running out and doing a backflip off of a c-130 ramp with with ten of my buddies who you really trust and so it it was just the the whole experience for me transitioning from military skydiving to civilian was just a huge turnoff
