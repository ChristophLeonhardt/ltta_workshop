1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,076


2
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:19,450
Some people, they
just don't want

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,820
to leave their property behind.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,370
There's a lot of looting
going on, and they're afraid.

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,647
They already lost a good
part of their belongings.

6
00:00:28,647 --> 00:01:32,010


7
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,664
I really have had no use
prior on these trucks.

8
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:38,080
I had purchased them, pretty
much, for a customer of mine,

9
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,890
and basically got stuck
with them unwillingly.

10
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,870
But they came in pretty handy.

11
00:01:43,870 --> 00:02:08,639


12
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,685
Saturday, Sunday,
all these past days,

13
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:12,060
we've been running
back and forth

14
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,010
in the southeast
side of Houston,

15
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,170
taking out a good amount
of people, families, kids,

16
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,652
elderly people.

17
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,110
Everybody out here
needs some help,

18
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,980
and we have the means to do it.

19
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,510
So we're going to stay at it.

20
00:02:26,510 --> 00:00:00,000
