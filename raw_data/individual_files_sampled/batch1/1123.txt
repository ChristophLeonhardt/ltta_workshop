US President Donald Trump's lawyers have reportedly warned him not to talk to Special Counsel Robert Muller Trump apparently feels differently what he said I'd like to but if he does and he lies that is a serious crime possibly an impeachable offense as the Moller investigation begins focusing directly on the president he started for the first time directly targeting Muller on Twitter at the same time his lead lawyer John Dowd called for the investigation to be shut down at first saying he spoke for the president then saying he didn't now he won't be speaking for him any longer John Dowd has quit the president clearly taking the lead of lawyers he's watching on TV often quoting Alan Dershowitz presidents absolutely right this investigation never should have begun and the question is now how does he deal with it and I think what he's doing is he's playing good cop bad cop he has some of his lawyers cooperating with Muller and some of his lawyers attacking a Muller with doubt gone one of the so-called good cops has quit he urged the president to cooperate with the special counsel added to the team Joe digenova who believes the exact opposite make no mistake about it a group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime as the investigation gets closer to the president he's going on the attack trying to discredit the investigators now he has a legal team much more likely to go along with that strategy petty Colleen al Jazeera Washington
