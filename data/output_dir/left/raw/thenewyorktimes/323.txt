1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,140
I try to relax every single
muscle so that there’s really

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,750
no tension involved.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,320
The only muscle
working is my brain.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,820
I just shut my eyes and I
visualize the different ups

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,400
and downs in the courses, where
I’m going to make my moves.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,360
I love when it’s a really cold
morning with the perfect snow,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,470
and it makes the perfect —

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,540
And they always have a
timer that counts down.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,240
It makes me so nervous, even
when I hear it in the summer

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,760
because you know that is
the start of the race.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,560
And it’s like beep,
beep, beep, beep.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,600
I’m heading up to
the first climb.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,910
I definitely don’t want to
go too hard at the beginning

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,440
because this is a hard course
and pacing is important.

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,282
Nerves come in a lot
of different forms.

16
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:45,740
Sometimes they come
to your muscles

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,340
and they make you
feel totally shaky.

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,180
Sometimes they do
this bizarre thing

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,340
where they make you so
nervous that you almost

20
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,910
become to this relaxed
state where you’re like,

21
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,560
O.K., come on leg, you can do it.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,300
You’re halfway up
the climb, this

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,280
is when your legs start burning.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,129
Don’t think about that, just
think about being light,

25
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,139
being light, being light.

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,020
There is no weight holding
me down, I am just this bird

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,160
flying up the hills
and across the flats.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,720
I actually discovered that
the voice, the positive voice

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,840
in my head that’s talking
to me during races,

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,120
is actually my mom’s voice.

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,830
Come on, Sadie, come on.

32
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,760
Light as a bird.

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,250
It’s like one, two, three,
four, right, left, right, left.

34
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,690
Crest over the top of
the hill, low tuck.

35
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,515
Don’t be afraid of that corner.

36
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,200
Rip out of the corner.

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,984
1, 2, 3, 4.

38
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:37,580
1, 2, 3, 4.

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,890
I think my favorite
times to compete

40
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,300
are when the crowd are so loud
that this roaring of voices

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,450
becomes almost — it
dulls out anything

42
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,890
in your head, just this buzz
that overtakes everything.

43
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,076
You got to stay in it.

44
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:52,700
You stay in it.

45
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,740
You still have one more climb.

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,960
Headed for the
final climb, this is

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,390
where you know you have to dig
deeper than anybody else is

48
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,610
willing to.

49
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,590
O.K., you got it?

50
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,249
All right, headed down
for the finish line.

51
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,820
Get your hands up,
get your hands up.

52
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,970
The line is right there.

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,420
I have those times where
I see us crossing the line

54
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,429
and winning that
medal, and the faces

55
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:16,470
of the girls on our team
and just the excitement.

56
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,260
And it’s totally that extra
motivation that’s like, O.K.,

57
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,990
I can do this and
I’m going to do it.

58
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,730
I don’t know exactly
what it looks like,

59
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,580
but I have visualized
the emotional part of it.

60
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,924
I really try to not
look at my competitors.

61
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,590
I think sometimes
when you look at them,

62
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,600
they seem like
they’re 30 feet tall

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,290
or their muscles are this big.

64
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,980
And you don’t see just
another competitor.

65
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,920
And so I try to not look around.

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,100
I try to only think
about what I can control

67
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,810
and what I’m going
to accomplish.

68
00:02:48,810 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s nobody else, it’s me just
doing what I do every day.
