00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,220
star scam I only found out this morning

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,350
and I was really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">video in the description bar below you</font>

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,050
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that Christina came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

7
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,370
here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few days last year because</font>

8
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">she was stopping up her way to Poland</font>

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,139
and this year they invited me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go as</font>

10
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,279
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well as Lewis of other youtubers</font>

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,320
to basically promote video blogging to

12
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,910
large part the reason why I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

13
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,260
afford to go to Chicago because they

14
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,460
were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my flight from</font>

15
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">pole into chicago and about half an hour</font>

16
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,550
after finding out i emailed<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight</font>

17
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">away i was home please take my name off</font>

18
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,029
that list because there was no way that

19
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,650
I am going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be involved in this this</font>

20
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,820
year I'm still going to matter to make

21
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,500
out to Chicago a bit like it's just

22
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,579
annoying because I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

23
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,110
Poland I really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

24
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,190
was really excited for a trip that

25
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,780
sounded too good to be true and actually

26
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,040
turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good to be true</font>

27
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway I have thousands of other amazing</font>

28
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,190
experiences to harm and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very lucky</font>

29
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,370
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to work my way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around this</font>

30
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,200
really shitty situation but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny</font>

31
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,550
thing is when a bad mood comes along

32
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,320
when I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> in term time or when I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

33
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,969
lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I find it so much easier</font>

34
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,860
to negotiate that bad mood<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i do</font>

35
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,050
just threw myself into my work and I do

36
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,629
focus my attention elsewhere and use

37
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,370
that as a way to prove myself when I'm

38
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,110
in a bad mood in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer holidays or</font>

39
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,450
as now after University I tend to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

40
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,880
sit around not really do much not want

41
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people and its really really</font>

42
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,150
unhealthy I'll just like stay in my room

43
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,520
watching stuff on BBC iplayer there's

44
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,110
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even lethargy it's just not caring</font>

45
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,180
whatsoever so today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am attempting to</font>

46
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,950
kick my bad mood with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys in tow</font>

47
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,890
this morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ran my 5k my daily 5k and</font>

48
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,270
I did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a really nice route along</font>

49
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,979
the key as I've said<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten thousand times</font>

50
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">before it is really nice that running is</font>

51
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,799
something but I can do now although I do

52
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,939
find it's much better when i'm running

53
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,770
for positive reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do have something</font>

54
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,329
to be really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry about it is</font>

55
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,340
night of able to pound pavement as they

56
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,009
say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think 24 degrees here annexed</font>

57
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,900
Earth completely slathered with<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 240</font>

58
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,100
because it made running a bit difficult

59
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,560
but I went running about seven or eight

60
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,930
rather than right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now which is 1130 so</font>

61
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,820
the peak of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sun times well the good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> son</font>

62
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,619
energy is passing through me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

63
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,049
a plant kind of rock towards the Sun I'm

64
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,270
definitely a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sunbae that I hate I really</font>

65
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,050
hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cold</font>

66
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,540
so it helps at the world is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really in</font>

67
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,380
gross and horrible

68
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,420
there are not negative aspects

69
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,830
especially someone who's used to living

70
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,810
in much bigger places but one of the

71
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,160
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do really like about it being a</font>

72
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,660
small places it's really easy to track

73
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,400
your way around it so I get really nice

74
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,380
and look over there is a bridge that I

75
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,390
was just next to you and you always map

76
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,370
yourself as you walk just kind of I

77
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,350
don't know it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thrill to it and</font>

78
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,140
thrill for a city girl<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

79
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,520
healing as well it makes that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

80
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier so you would get much more like a</font>

81
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vista</font>

82
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,810
guys I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hogwarts</font>

83
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,920
someone's had a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> campfire like a</font>

84
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot nice needle over there as well I was</font>

85
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,590
hated family walks I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move in</font>

86
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,030
stuff like that feel like you have to be

87
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,620
in a very particular mood for a walk and

88
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">then if other people are like dragging</font>

89
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,040
you one you can't like artificially

90
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,010
create that made your mindset but now my

91
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,430
mold enjoying Baltimore Timmy what's

92
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:25,840
wrong with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> astrologer Anya really</font>

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,550
picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up my rage until I got home I</font>

94
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,010
started writing CDs and job applications

95
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,130
yay why does real life always intrude

96
00:03:33,130 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys tomorrow bye</font>
