NOW REPORTING, DAVID MUIR.
>>> GOOD MORNING AND WE'RE 
COMING ON THE AIR AT THIS HOUR 
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
MEETDING WITH HIS CABINET AT THE
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW OVER THE 
GROWING CRISIS IN SYRIA.
THE PRESIDENT DISCUSSING HOW TO 
RESPOND TO THE SUSPECTED 
CHEMICAL ATTACK BLAMED FOR 
KILLING DOZENS OF CIVILIANS IN 
DOUMA, NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY OF 
DEMASCUS.
IT IS BELIEVED THE ATTACK WAS 
CARRIED OUT BE THE SYRIAN 
REGIME, AND IN RECENT TWEETS, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING ASSAD AN
ANIMAL, AND BLAMING PUTIN FOR 
BACKING ASSAD, AND SAYING THERE 
WILL BE A, QUOTE, BIG PRICE.
LET'S GET TO MARTHA RADDATZ LIVE
IN WASHINGTON.
THE LAST TIME, ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
WE KNOW IT WAS JUST THREE DAYS 
BEFORE THE U.S. STRUCK AFTER 
FIRST EVIDENCE OF CHEMICAL 
WARFARE BACK THEN.
WHAT KIND OF PROOF ARE THEY 
LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW AND WHAT 
ACTION COULD COME?
>> Reporter: WHAT THEY DID THE 
LAST TIME THEY STRUCK, LAST 
YEAR, THEY HAD SATELLITE IMAGERY
AND THEY KNEW WHAT KIND OF 
AIRCRAFT DROPPED THOSE BOMBS 
THAT CONTAINED CHEMICALS.
THIS TIME, THEY WILL LOOK AND 
SEE IF THEY HAVE THE SAME KIND 
OF EVIDENCE.
THEY WILL TRY FOR TISSUE 
SAMPLES.
THEY WILL TRY FOR SOIL SAMPLES, 
BUT THOSE WILL BE VERY, VERY 
HARD TO GET BECAUSE THIS IS THE 
ASSAD REGIME AND THEY WILL BE 
LOOKING OUT FOR THAT, AND THEY 
WILL WANT TO BURY THAT EVIDENCE.
>> RELEASING THAT FLIGHT PATH, 
AND LET'S GET TO CECILIA VEGA AT
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT CREATING HIS OWN 
RED LINE A YEAR AGO, A NEW ONE.
>> Reporter: YEAH.
HE SAID HE WAS MOVED, DAVID, BY 
SEEING THOSE HORRIBLE FOE TES IN
SYRIA THE LAST TIME AROUND.
MOVED DEEPLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL
AND BEWE SAW THE TOMAHAWK 
MISSILES.
>> LET'S LISTEN.
>> BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
IT WAS AN ATROCIOUS ATTACK.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
YOU DON'T SEE THINGS LIKE THAT 
AS BAD AS THE NEWS AROUND THE 
WORLD.
YOU JUST DON'T SEE THOSE IMAGES.
WE ARE STUDYING THAT SITUATION 
EXTREMELY CLOSELY.
WE ARE MEETING WITH OUR MILITARY
AND EVERYBODY ELSE, AND WE'LL BE
MAKING SOME MAJOR DECISIONS TO 
EVERY THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS.
WE ARE VERY CONCERNED.
WHEN A THING LIKE THAT CAN 
HAPPEN, THIS IS ABOUT HUMANITY.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUMANITY, 
AND IT CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO 
HAPPEN.
SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT 
BARBARIC ACT AND STUDYING WHAT'S
GOING ON.
WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE IN 
THERE.
AS YOU KNOW, IT HAS BEEN 
SURROUNDED.
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET PEOPLE IN 
BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAS IT BEEN 
HIT, IT'S BEEN SURROUNDED.
AND IF THEY ARE INNOCENT, WHY 
AREN'T THEY ALLOWING OTHER 
PEOPLE TO GO AND IMPROVE?
THEY ARE CLAIMING THEY DIDN'T 
MAKE THE ATTACK.
SO IF IT'S RUSSIA, IF IT'S 
SYRIA, IF IT'S IRAN, IF IT'S ALL
OF THEM TOGETHER, WE'LL FIGURE 
IT OUT, AND WE'LL KNOW THE 
ANSWERS QUITE SOON.
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT VERY, 
VERY STRONGLY AND VERY 
SERIOUSLY.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PROVIDE AN 
UPDATE ON TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.
WE HAVE A SITUATION WITH CHINA 
WHERE WE HAVE AFTER VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AND I 
THINK WE'LL MAINTAIN THAT 
RELATIONSHIP.
I'M VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH 
PRESIDENT XI.
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR 
PRESIDENT XI, AND AS YOU KNOW, I
SPENT TWO DAYS IN CHINA.
THE PRESIDENT SPENT TWO DAYS 
WITH US IN MAR-A-LAGO IN 
FLORIDA, AND THEY WERE FOUR 
GREAT DAYS.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, CHINA HAS 
BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE 
UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS.
REALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT IT, SINCE
THE START OF THE WORLD TRADE 
ORGANIZATION, AND THEY HAVE 
REALLY DONE A NUMBER ON THIS 
COUNTRY.
AND I DON'T BLAME CHINA.
I BLAME THE PEOPLE RUNNING OUR 
COUNTRY.
I BLAME PRESIDENTS.
I BLAME REPRESENTATIVES, I BLAME
NEGOTIATORS.
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO 
WHAT THEY DID.
WE DIDN'T DO IT.
THEY DID.
AND IT'S THE MOST LOPSIDED SET 
OF TRADE RULES, REGULATIONS THAT
ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE HAVE 
MANY OF THE HORRIBLE DEALS.
WE'RE RENEGOTIATING AND WE'LL 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WE'RE STRONGLY RENEGOTIATING 
NAFTA.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN 
UNION, THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS 
TRADE BARRIERS.
WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE BAD DEALS 
W
WITH EVERYONE.
WE'RE CLOSE TO FINISHING A DEAL 
WITH SOUTH KOREA.
THAT WAS GOING TO GIVE US 
200,000 JOBS.
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
THAT GAVE THEM 200,000 JOBS AND 
WE LOST JOBS.
THAT WAS A HORRIBLE DEAL AND 
IT'S BEING RENEGOTIATED.
AND WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A LONG 
WAY TO GO.
WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS 
PROGRESS.
WE ARE FAIRLY CLOSE ON NAFTA, 
AND IF WE DON'T MAKE THE RIGHT 
DEAL, WE'LL TERMINATE NAFTA AND 
MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL AFTER THAT.
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A DEAL 
ON NAFTA, AND AS I SAID, THE 
NORTH KOREA -- SOUTH KOREA 
SITUATION WHICH COMPLICATES IT.
THE DEAL WE HAVE WITH SOUTH 
KOREA, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE 
A VERY FAIR DEAL.
WE WANT A FAIR DEAL AND WE DON'T
HAVE FAIR DEALS.
NORTH KOREA BY THE WAY, AS YOU 
HAVE PROBABLY SEEN, WE HAVE BEEN
IN TOUCH WITH NORTH KOREA.
WE'LL BE MEETING WITH THEM SOME 
TIME IN MAY OR EARLY JUNE, AND I
THINK THERE WILL BE GREAT 
RESPECT PAID BY BOTH PARTIES AND
HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO 
MAKE A DEAL ON THE DE-NUKING OF 
NORTH KOREA.
THEY HAVE SAID SO.
WE HAVE SAID SO.
HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A 
RELATIONSHIP THAT'S MUCH 
DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR 
MANY, MANY YEARS.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY 
OTHER PRESIDENTS AND THEY 
DECIDED THEY DIDN'T DO IT.
THEY COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, BUT 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT EASIER 
IF IT WERE DONE FIVE YEARS AGO, 
TEN YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO.
A LOT EASIER THAN NOW, BUT WE 
HAVE A MEETING THAT IS BEING SET
UP WITH NORTH KOREA, SO THAT 
WILL BE VERY EXCITING, I THINK 
FOR THE WORLD.
I THINK IT WILL BE AN EXCITING 
THING FOR THE WORLD.
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT 
OPIOID TODAY.
OPIOID DESTRUCTION AND DRUG 
DESTRUCTION.
AS YOU KNOW, WE STRENGTHENED UP 
OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.
LAST YEAR, WE HAD RECORD LOW 
NUMBERS AND THEY HAVE GONE UP, 
AND THE ECONOMY, PEOPLE ARE 
TRYING TO COME INTO OUR GOOD 
ECONOMY, BUT WE'RE PUTTING THE 
NATIONAL GUARD AND MILITARY AT 
THE BORDER.
WE'RE
I.C.E. HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB.
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT 
SITUATION.
WE NEED A WALL.
WHETHER YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN OR 
DEMOCRAT, WE NEED A WALL.
IT WILL STOP YOUR DRUG FLOW, IT 
WILL NOT THE HELL OUT OF THE 
DRUG FLOW.
IT WILL STOP A LOT OF PEOPLE WE 
DON'T WANT IN THIS COUNTRY FROM 
COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE PUTTING THE 
MILITARY AND THE NATIONAL GUARD 
AND WE DON'T HAVE STRONG 
BORDERS.
WE HAVE STRONG BORDERS NOW AND 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE STRONGER.
WITH THAT, THE CABINET MEETING 
WILL BEGIN.
WE'LL BE DISCUSSING A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF WHAT'S 
GOING ON.
THE COUNTRY IS DOING VERY WELL.
WE'VE CREATED 3 MILLION JOBS 
SINCE THE ELECTION.
WE HAVE 700,000 JOBS IN THE LAST
NUMBER OF MONTHS.
THE NUMBERS ARE STARTING TO COME
OUT FROM COMPANIES, 
CORPORATIONS.
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL.
OUR COUNTRY IS ON VERY SOLID 
FOOTING.
WHEN WE DO A DEAL WITH CHINA 
WHICH PROBABLY WE WILL.
IF WE DON'T, THEY'LL HAVE TO PAY
PRETTY HIGH TAXES TO DO BUSINESS
WITH OUR COUNTRY.
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.
BUT IF WE DO A DEAL WITH CHINA, 
IF DURING THE COURSE OF THE 
NEGOTIATION THEY WANT TO HIT THE
FARMERS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT 
HITS ME, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT'S 
NICE.
BUT I TELL YOU OUR FARMERS ARE 
GREAT PATRIOTS.
THESE ARE GREAT PATRIOTS.
THEY UNDERSTAND WE'RE DOING THIS
FOR THE COUNTRY.
IN THE END THEY'RE GOING TO BE 
MUCH STRONGER THAN THEY ARE.
DON'T FORGET, FARMERS HAVE BEEN 
TRENDING DOWNWARD OVER AN 8-YEAR
PERIOD.
THEIR NUMBERS HAVE TRENDED 
DOWNWARD, IN SOME CASES 
SIGNIFICANTLY.
SO BETWEEN NAFTA AND CHINA AND 
ALL OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING, 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM MUCH 
BETTER THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN.
BUT DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME, 
SONNY PERDUE, YOU UNDERSTAND 
EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.
THERE WILL BE A LITTLE WORK TO 
BE DONE.
BUT THE FARMERS WILL BE BETTER 
OFF THAN THEY EVER WERE.
WILL TAKE A WHIL WHILE TO GET 
THERE, BUT -- IT COULD BE VERY 
QUICK ACTUALLY.
IT'S NOT NICE WHEN THEY HIT THE 
FARMERS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE 
THEY THINK THAT HITS ME.
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE'RE 
DOING VERY WELL ON TRADE AND 
TRADE DEALS.
I THINK DEALS WILL BE MADE.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE 
DEALS WITH A LOT OF COUNTRIES 
THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF US.
WE WILL BE REPORTING BACK TO 
EVERYBODY AND WE'LL START OUR 
CABINET MEETING.
THANK YOU ALL, MEETING THE 
PRESS.
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
>> WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 
DECISION ON ALL OF THAT, IN 
PARTICULAR SYRIA, WE'LL BE 
MAKING THAT DECISION VERY 
QUICKLY.
PROBABLY BY THE END OF TODAY.
WE CANNOT ALLOW ATROCITIES LIKE 
THAT.
.
>> YOU MAY.
IF HE DOES, IT'S GOING TO BE 
VERY TOUGH.
>> EVERYBODY IS GOING TO PAY A 
PRICE.
HE WILL.
EVERYBODY WILL.
EXCUSE ME?
>> U.S. MILITARY ACTION, IS IT 
OFF THE TABLE?
>> NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE.
NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE.
.
>> WELL, THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE 
NOT.
BUT TO ME, THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A
DOUBT.
THE GENERALS WILL FIGURE IT OUT 
PROBABLY OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
THANK YOU EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
THE MARKET IS UP TODAY VERY 
SUBSTANTIALLY.
NOT AT ALL.
DON'T FORGET, OUR COUNTRY IS 
GOING TO BE MUCH STRONGER WHEN 
THIS IS ALL FINISHED.
SO YOU UNDERSTAND.
THESE TRADE DEALS ARE HORRIBLE.
OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE MUCH 
STRONGER WHEN THIS IS FINISHED.
OKAY?
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
THANK YOU.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE TALKING ABOUT TRADE, 
TALKING ABOUT BORDERS.
BUT IT WAS SYRIA THAT THE WORLD 
IS WATCHING HIM.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE CHEMICAL 
ATTACK SAYING IT WAS AN 
ATROCIOUS ATTACK, IT WAS 
HORRIBLE.
YOU DON'T SEE THESE IMAGES GOING
ON TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT 
HUMANITY.
MOMENTS AGO HE WAS ASKED IF 
MILITARY ACTION WAS OFF THE 
TABLE.
HE SAID NOTHING IS OFF THE 
TABLE.
OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT ASKING IF 
PUTIN WAS BEHIND IT.
HE SAID HE COULD BE.
IF SO, HE WOULD BE PUN FISHED.
>> HARD TO BELIEVE MARTHA 
RADDATZ WE WERE ON THE AIR AFTER
THE PRESIDENT SAID ON THE STAGE 
IN OHIO WE ARE COMING OUT OF 
SYRIA VERY SOON, LET THE OTHER 
PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF IT NOW.
IT APPEARS THE PRESIDENT BEING 
FORCED INTO REACTING AND TAKING 
CARE OF A SITUATION THAT WE 
WITNESSED IN SYRIA OVER THE 
WEEKEND.
HE SAID THE DECISION COULD COME 
AS EARLY AS THE END OF TODAY. 
>> AND DAVID, HE SEEMED TO HAVE 
NO DOUBT IT WAS A CHEMICAL 
ATTACK.
HE SAID NO DOUBT TO ME.
NOT MUCH OF A DOUBT AT ALL.
OF COURSE, HE TWEETED OVER THE 
WEEKEND THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS A
CHEMICAL ATTACK.
HE SAID HE WILL LEAVE IT TO HIS 
GENERALS TO DETERMINE THAT.
OF COURSE, DAVID, WHEN WE WERE 
TALKING A WEEK AGO, HE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT PULLING OUT 
BECAUSE OF THE PROGRESS MADE 
AGAINST ISIS.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT 
SITUATION.
BUT HE IS GETTING SOME CRITICISM
FOR SAYING THAT LAST WEEK.
SAYING THAT POSSIBLY THAT'S WHAT
BROUGHT THIS ON.
>> MARTHA, THANK YOU.
I'M GOING TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT IN LONDON 
WATCH THAT.
IF IT'S RUSSIA, IF IT'S SYRIA, 
IRAN, IF THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER ON
THIS, WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. 
>> HOW DO YOU FIGURE IT OUT IN A
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME?
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS TO ASSESS 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN A 
CHEMICAL ATTACK TAKES THE OPCW, 
THE ORGANIZATION FOR THE PRE 
DENGS OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
THEY NEED TO SEND IN EXPERTS AND
TAKE SAMPLES AND ASSESS IT.
AS MARTHA SAID, THE ATTACK THAT 
TOOK PLACE 12 MONTHS AGO, IT WAS
EASIER TO GET THOSE SAMPLES.
YOU GO ACROSS THE BORDER QUICKLY
AND GET IT TESTED.
ULTIMATELY, THAT IS WHAT 
HAPPENED AND THE BLAME WAS LAID 
FARMLY AT THE FOOT OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF SYRIA.
THIS TIME YOU'RE IN AN ENCLAVE 
SURROUNDED BY THE SYRIAN REGIME 
FORCES AND RUSSIANS.
THEY SAID THEY'VE SENT IN A TEAM
OF EXPERTS AND SAID THERE'S NO 
EVIDENCE OF CHEMICAL ATTACK.
WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO MEDIA 
ACTIVISTS ON THE GROUND TELLING 
ABC NEWS THAT THAT ISN'T TRUE.
EVEN IF YOU HAD TAKEN SAMPLES, 
YOU COULDN'T ASSESS IT AT THAT 
POINT.
THE QUESTION REMAINS, IF THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS TO ACT, HE'LL 
HAVE TO DO IT WITHOUT NATIONAL 
AUTHORIZATION.
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
>> IAN, AS HE POINTS OUT, U.S. 
INTELLIGENCE LOOKING FOR PROOF 
OF A CHEMICAL ATTACK.
THE RUSSIANS A SHORT TIME AGO 
SAYING THEY HAVE BEEN IN AND 
FOUND NO EVIDENCE.
NOT TERRIBLY SURPRISING COMING 
FROM THE RUSSIANS AT THIS HOUR.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING ACTION --
DECISION ON ANY ACTION AFTER THE
VIDEO THAT PLAYED OUT ALL OVER 
THE WORLD COULD COME WITHIN 24 
TO 48 HOURS FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
FOR MORE ON THE BREAKING 
DEVELOPMENTS, DOWNLOAD THE ABC.
I'M DAVID MUIR.
SEE YOU LATER TODAY ON WORLD 
NEWS TONIGHT.
