migration doesn't stop tragedy is
happening daily who is left to pick up
these people at sea they could have
bought Ferraris John's whatever but they
decided to take that money and put it
into going out into the ocean and
picking people were adrenaline it's not
the crazy investment if you think of
this to save all these people org is the
life I think it would be too easy for
some people just to write checks for
someone else to do what is definitely a
core function on the state just because
you're the smartest guy in the room
doesn't mean that you're trying to make
a profit every moment
