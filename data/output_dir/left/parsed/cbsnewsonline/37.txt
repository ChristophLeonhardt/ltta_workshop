>>> ALL RIGHT.
TAKING YOU NOW TO SECRETARY OF
STATE MIKE POMPEO HOLDING A
PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER MEETING
WITH ISRAEL'S FOREIGN MINISTER.
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> OUR INTELLIGENCE IN THIS
REGARD IS SOLID.
WE CAN SEE THE HAND OF THE I O
TOL AND HIS HENCHMAN SUPPORTING
THE ATTACKS ON THE UNITED
STATES.
ON FRIDAY, I ORDERED THE
TEMPORARY RELOCATION OF AMERICAN
PERSONNEL.
WE WILL HOLD IRAN RESPONSIBLE
FOR ANYTHING PERPETRATED BY THE
MILITIA.
THE LATEST DESTABILIZING ACTS
ARE ATTEMPTS TO PUSH BACK ON OUR
EFFORTS TO CONSTRAIN ITS
BEHAVIOR.
CLEARLY THEY SAY OUR CAMPAIGN AS
SERIOUS AND SUCCEEDING.
WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THEM TO
CONTINUE THEIR ATTEMPTS TO HIT
BACK, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE FULL
SANCTIONS ARE REIMPOSED ON THE
4TH OF NOVEMBER.
THE UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE
TO STAND WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ
AS THEY CHART A FUTURE BASED ON
IRAQI INTEREST, NOT THOSE
DICTATED BY IRAN.
WE ARE SUPPORTING THE DELIVERY
OF CLEAN WATER TO THE 750,000
RESIDENTS IN BASRA.
NOW LET ME TURN TO THE RULING OF
TODAY.
I'M ANNOUNCING THAT THE UNITED
STATES IS TERMINATING THE 1955
TREATY OF AMNITY WITH IRAN.
THIS IS A DECISION THAT IS 39
YEARS OVER DUE.
IN IRAN, THEY BROUGHT A CASE
ALLEGING INJUSTICE OF THE
TROETY.
THEY SEEK TO CHALLENGE UNITED
STATES' DECISION TO NOT BE A
PART OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL.
THEY HAVE INTERFERED WITH THE
ACTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TO
PROTECT OUR INTERESTS.
THEIR CASE AS YOU CAN SEE FROM
THE DECISION LACKED MERIT.
GIVEN IRAN'S HISTORY OF
TERRORISM, BALLISTIC MISSILE
BEHAVIOR, THE CHAMZ UNDER THE
TREATY ARE ABSURD.
THE COURT'S RULING TODAY WAS A
DEFEAT FOR IRAN.
IT RIGHTLY REJECTED ALL OF
IRAN'S BASELESS REQUESTS.
THE COURT DENOID THEIR MEASURES
TO INTERFERE WITH U.S. SANCTINS
AND RIGHTLY NOTED THE NONE
COMPLIANCE WITH THE OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THE TREATY OF
NONPROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
WITH REGARD TO THE COURT'S
OUTDOOR ON HUMANITARIAN ISSUES,
WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR.
EXISTING EXCEPTIONS AND
LICENSING POLICIES FOR
HUMANITARIAN TRANSACTIONS AND
SAFETY OF LIFE WILL REMAIN IN
EFFECT.
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN
ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON ISSUES
WITHOUT WITH REGARD TO ANY
PROCEEDING.
WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE
DEPARTMENT OF TREASUREY TO MAKE
SURE THAT THE ACTIONS INVOLVING
IRAN CAN AND WILL CONTINUE.
WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE
COURT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE IT HAS
NO JURISDICTION TO ISSUE ANY
ORDER RELATING TO THE SANCTION
MEASURES WITH THE UNITED STATES
WHICH IS DOING ITS WORK ON IRAN
TO PROTECT ITS OWN ESSENTIAL
SECURITY INTERESTS.
IN LIGHT OF HOW THE ACJ HAS BEEN
ABUSED AS A FORM OF ATTACKING
THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED
STATES IS TERMINATING THE TREATY
OF OMTY WITH IRAN.
I HOPE THE LEADERS WILL
RECOGNIZE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO
SECURE A BRIGHT FUTURE IS TO
CEASE THE CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AND
DESTRUCTION AROUND THE WORLD.
THE THIRD ITEM, PUTTING THE
DIPLOMATIC TEAM FROM THE UNITED
STATES BACK ON THE FIELD.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT
THAT THERE ARE 65 NOMINEES NOW
SITTING WITH UNITED STATES
SENATE.
THAT IS OVER A QUARTER OF ALL OF
THE SENIOR LEVEL CONFORMABLE
POSITIOS THAT THE UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF STATE IS TASKED
WITH USING TO ACHIEVE ITS
DIPLOMATIC OUTCOMES.
I WANT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TO
KNOW THAT WHAT SENATOR MENENDEZ
ARE DOING TO HOLD BACK RESTS ON
THEIR SHOULDERS.
BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
AGREE THAT A FULLY STAFFED STATE
DEPARTMENT IS NECESSARY FOR
SECURITY.
SENATOR MENENDEZ TOLD ME THAT
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE AN
EMACEIATED STATE DEPARTMENT
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION.
END OF QUOTE.
WE HAVE DONE OUR PART TO FIX
THAT AND HE NOW NEEDS TO DO HIS
PART.
THESE CANDIDATES ARE QUALITY
CANDIDATES.
THEY ARE NOT SITTING ON THE
SENATE FLOOR BECAUSE OF
OBJECTIONS OF THEIR QUALITY OR
EXCELLENCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO
DELIVER AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.
WAVE AFTER WAVE OF THESE
EXTREMELY QUALIFIED NOMINEES
HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE UNITED
STATES SENATE.
JOHN RICHMOND HAS BEEN STUCK FOR
85 DAYS WHILE WE TRY TO MAKE
PROGRESS ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING, A
PRIORITY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION
AND A SHARED PRIORITY WITH
SENATOR MENENDEZ.
WE HAVE KIM BRIER, THE NOMINEE
TO HEAD UP WESTERN MEMSPHERE
WHILE THE CRISIS IN VENEZUELA
CONTINUES TO RAGE.
DAVID SHANKER, HIS NOMINATION IS
HELD UP WHILE IRAN CONTINUES TO
UNDERMINE STUKT IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.
RUSSIA IS SEEKING TO PREY ON OUR
ELECTIONS BUT ELLEN McARCTY ,
THE PRESIDENT'S CHOICE TO HEAD
THE BUREAU OF INTELLIGENCE SITS
ON THE SENATE FLOOR.
AS AMERICAN FORCES ARE ENGAGED
IN FIGHTING TERRORISM AROUND THE
WORLD, WE ARE WAITING ON THE
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE TO
ACT ON A NOMINATION.
AS A FORMER MEMBER, I APPRECIATE
THE SENATE'S ADVICE AND CONSENT
ROLE AND THEIR DUTY TO CONDUCT
OVER SIGHT AND I UNDERSTAND
THEIR NEED TO BE FAIR AND HONEST
BROKERS.
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IS BEING
ENGAGED IN.
WE NEED THESE PEOPLE.
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS
UNPRECEDENTED.
WE HAVE MEMBERS FOR THE SENATE
FOR WHOM PARTISANSHIP HAS DRIVEN
DELAY AND OBSTRUCTION OF GETTING
AMERICA'S DIPLOMATIC CORE INTO
EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD.
IT WILL IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS,
OUR ABILITY.
WE DON'T HAVE A COO.
THE UNDERSECRETARY FOR
MANAGEMENT GOING ON TWO YEARS
WITH NO ONE IN THE FACILITY.
ENORMOUS OPERATIONS KEEPING OUR
PEOPLE SAFE AROUND THE WORLD DO
NOT HAVE A SENIOR LEADER.
THEY ARE REAL, DIRECT IMPACTS OF
OF NOT HAVING THE PEOPLE
CONFIRMED.
I IMPLORE THE UNITED STATES
SENATE TO TAKE THE QUALITY
TALENTED PEOPLE AND ALLOW THEM
TO DO WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE
AGREED TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE
UNITED STATES.
WITH THAT, I AM HAPPY TO TAKE
SOME QUESTIONS.
>> THANK YOU.
MR. SECRETARY, DOES THE RULING
OF THE COURT HAVE ANY PRACTICAL
IMPACT ON WHAT THE U.S. -- ON
U.S. SANCTIONS?
AND NUMBER TWO, WHAT ASSURANCES
CAN YOU GIVE THAT THIS WILL NOT
IMPACT ANY HUMANITARIAN AID?
BEFORE YOU SAID IT WAS NOT
ENOUGH, THAT THE U.S. ASSURANCES
WERE NOT ADEQUATE?
>> WE WILL MAKE SURE WE ARE
PROVIDING HAD HUMANITARIAN
ASSISTANCE THAT DELIVERS FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT.
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE WE CARE
ABOUT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO
AFFORD THE FLEXIBILITY SO THE
ASSISTANCE CAN BE NEEDED.
HAVING SAID THAT THE CHOICES
THAT ARE BEING MADE INSIDE OF
IRAN TODAY TO USE MONEY TO HAVE
TERROR AROUND THE WORLD TO
LAUNCH, MISSILES AT AIRPORTS
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST,
THOSE ARE DOLLARS THAT THE
IRANIAN LEADERSHIP IS
SQUANDERING.
THEY COULD BE PROVIDING
HUMANITARIAN ASESTANCE TO THEIR
OWN PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE CHOOSING
ANOTHER PATH OF REVOLUTIONARY
EFFORT AROUND THE WORLD SHOWING
NO REGARD FOR THE NEEDS OF THEIR
OWN PEOPLE.
>> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT NORTH
KOREA, MR. SECRETARY.
THEY HAVETHE END OF WAR
DECLARATION, WILL
IT BE RESOLVED THIS WEEKEND AND
IF NOT, WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON
AGAINST OFFERING THIS?
>> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON
THE PROGRESS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS
ON THE END OF WAR DECLARATION
ONLY THAT THEY ARE HAPPY TO GO
BACK AND GET THE COMMITMENT BACK
THAT KIM JONG UN AND PRESIDENT
TRUMP MADE IN THE SECOND WEEK OF
JUNE.
I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL COME
AWAY WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF
DEEPER PROGRESS AND A PLAN
FORWARD NOT ONLY FOR A SUMMIT
BETWEEN THE LEADERS BUT FOR US
TO CONTINUE THE EFFORTS TO BUILD
OUT A PATHWAY FOR
DENUCLEARIZATION.
>> RUSHSIA HAS DELIVERED 300
SYSTEMS TO SYRIA.
YOU SAID IN THE PAST THAT IT IS
A SERIOUS ESCALATION.
ARE YOU PLANNING TO TAKE ANY
MEASURES WITH THIS REGARD?
AND MY SECOND QUESTION ON IRAQ,
ANY COMMENT ON THE ELECTION OF
THE PRESIDENT AND THE
DESIGNATION OF THE PRIME
MINISTER?
>> I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK
WITH THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE AND THE NEW PRESIDENT.
I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK
WITH THE PRESIDENT DESIGNEE.
I HOPE TO DO SO.
I AM EQUALLY HOPEFUL THAT THEY
WILL FALL THROUGH ON THE
COMMITMENTS THEY MADE WHEN WE
SPOKE.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WE KNOW PRETTY
WELL.
THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND THE IRAQI
GOVERNMENT SCENE FOR SOME TIME.
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT
BUILDING OUT ON IRAQI GOVERNMENT
THAT WAS AN IRAQI GOVERNMENT OF
NATIONAL UNITY THAT WAS
INTERESTED IN THE FUTURE GOOD
FORTUNES OF THE PEOPLE, NOT
CONTROLLED BY THE ISLAMIC
REPUBLIC OF IRAN.
I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN SPEAK
WITH THE PEOPLE.
YOUR FIRST QUESTION WAS ABOUT
THE S300, I WILL NOT COMMENT ON
OUR INTENTION ON HOW WE WILL
ADDRESS THAT.
MY COMMENTS BEFORE WERE TRUE,
HAVING RUSSIANS DELIVER THE S300
INTO SYRIA PRESENTS A GREATER
RISK TO ALL OF THOSE IN THE AREA
AND TO STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.
WE CONSIDER THIS A SERIOUS
ESCALADE.
>> QUESTION, CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO
US A LITTLE BIT THE PRACTICAL
REALITY OF THE U.S. TERMINATING
THE AMNITY WITH IRAN AND HOW
THAT WILL PLAY OUT?
AND SECONDLY, BECAUSE WE ARE
GOING TO NORTH KOREA, IS THERE
ANY TIME FRAME FOR WHAT THE U.S.
WANTS TO ACHIEVE GIVEN THAT LAST
WEEK WE HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAY THE U.S. IS NOT PLAYING A
TIME GAME BUT YOU SAID THAT YOU
WANT RAPID DENUCLEARIZATION OF
NORTH KOREA COMPLETED BY JANUARY
2021.
>> THEY ARE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT
WITH EACH OTHER.
WE WANT IT FAST BUT WE WILL NOT
PLAY IT TIME GAME.
THAT COMMENT WAS NOT MINE.
THAT WAS THE LEADERS WHO HAD HAD
THE SUMMIT IN PYONGYANG.
I WAS SIMPLY REITERATING THIS AS
A TIMELINE THAT THEY WERE
POTENTIALLY PREPARED TO AGREE
TO.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS ARE
RIGHT.
THIS IS A LONGTERM PROBLEM.
THIS HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING FOR
DECADES.
WE HAVE MADE MORE PROGRESS THAN
HAS BEEN MADE IN AN AWFULLY LONG
TIME.
AND WE HAVE DONE SO IN A
CONDITION WHICH CONTINUES TO
GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO
ACHIEVE THE FINAL GOAL, THAT IS
THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS CONTINUE
TO REMAIN IN PLACE.
THE CORE PROPOSITION, THE THING
THAT WILL GIVE US THE CAPACITY
TO DELIVER DENUCLEARIZATION IS
NOT CHANGING.
IF YOU HEARD THE COMMENTS AT THE
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL, COMPLETE
UNIENIMITY FOR THOSE TO STAY IN
PLACE.
THERE COULD BE A TIME TO REDUCE
THEM BUT THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF
MAINTAINING THE SECURITY COUNSEL
RESOLUTIONS AND THE SANCTIONS
THAT UNDERLAY THEM.
THAT IS A GLOBAL COMMITMENT THAT
I'M NOT SURE THERE ARE MANY
ISSUES THAT YOU CAN FIND HAD THE
UNIMTY ON THAT.
>> AND THE PRACTICAL FALL OUT OF
WITHDRAWING THE TREATY?
>> I DON'T SO ANY.
WE OUGHT TO HAVE PULLED OUT OF
IT DECADES AGO.
THE IRANIANS HAVE NOT BEEN
COMPLYING FOR YEARS.
IT WAS A DECISION MADE THIS
MORNING FROM THE ICG THAT MARKED
A USEFUL POINT FOR US TO
DEMONSTRATE THE UBSURDITY OF THE
TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES
AND IRAN.
>> THANKS, EVERYONE.
>> ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO
DELIVERING REMARKS THERE IN
FRONT OF THE PRESS.
THE NEWS IS THAT THE SECRETARY
HAS DECIDED TO REMOVE THE UNITED
STATES FROM A TREATY BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES AND IRAN DATING
BACK TO 1955.
IT IS THE AMTY TREATY.
POMPEO SAID THAT IRAN HAS
CONTINUED TO VIOLATE THE TREATY
FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
THE SECRETARY SAYING THEY ARE
REMOVING THE UNITED STATES FROM
THE DEAL.
ALSO GETTING QUESTIONS THERE
ABOUT NORTH KOREA.
THERE IS STILL OUTSTANDING
DETAILS TO BE WORKED OUT
INCLUDING THE MOST IMPORTANT
DETAIL, THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF
NORTH KOREA N. THAT SEEMS TO BE
STALLED.
AT ONE POINT, WE ASKED A
QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND THERE IS
A TIMELINE OUT THERE THAT
SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE IN 2021
BUT THE SECRETARY SAYS HE WANTS
IT TO HAPPEN QUICKLY.
POMPEO SAID YES QUICKLY BUT THAT
WAS THE TIME LINE ESTABLISHED BY
THE NORTH KOREAN AND SOUTH
KOREAN LEADERS AND HE JUST
REITERATED HE WANTED THAT AS
WELL.
A FAIRLY ROUTINE PRESS
CONFERENCE THERE BUT HITTING ON
THE TWO KEY ISSUES THAT PEOPLE
CONTINUALLY HIT HIM ON.
WHAT HAPPENS WITH IRAN, IT STEPS
UP THE DLIJERANCE BETWEEN THE
TWO -- BELLIGERENCE BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES.
>> WE ARE STILL SEEING THE GAP
BETWEEN THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE
TWO COUNTRIES.
NORTH KOREA FEELS IT IS MOVING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THE
DISMANTLING OF SOME NUCLEAR
FORCES.
AND I THINK THEY THOUGHT THEY
WOULD SEE SOME SANCTIONS LIFTED.
AND RECENTLY THEY VOICED THEIR
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE U.S. HAS
NOT MOVED IN THEIR FAVOR CALLING
THE U.S. A BULLY.
PERHAPS IT IS GOOD NEWS THAT
POMPEO IS SCHEDULED TO RETURN TO
NORTH KOREA AND RESUME TALKS.
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TALK A FEW
WEEKS AGO AND THE PRESIDENT
PULLED HIM BACK.
PERHAPS THIS IS AN INDICATION
THAT THINGS ARE MOVING FORWARD.
>> I THINK THERE IS A WORRY THAT
PERHAPS THIS TRIP THAT POMPEO
WILL BE TAKING SOON TO NORTH
KOREA IS GOING TO BE DELAYED
AGAIN.
AND CLEARLY NOT THE CASE.
HE WILL TRAVEL THERE ON FRIDAY.
OUR ERROL BARNETT IS THERE AND
WE ARE TRYING TO GET HIM IN
FRONT OF A CAMERA TO BREAK DOWN
SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT.
>> I THINK THIS TREATY IS REALLY
INTERESTING.
I THINK IT INDICATES A NEW LINE
OF FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD,
ATTACK.
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT FROM
THE SECRETARY OF STATE
ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE IN IRAN
THAT IF THEY ARE UPSET ABOUT THE
ECONOMY BECAUSE IT IS FALLING
APART, THEY SHOULD BLAME THEIR
OWN LEADERS.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS BEEN
ENCOURAGING IF YOU WANT
INSTABILITY WITHIN IRAN.
THAT HAS BEEN THE FOLKS AFTER
PULLING OUT OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL.
NOW WE SEE THIS.
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING HOW
THE U.S. IS TURNING UP THE HEAT.
THEY ARE PUTTING PRESSURE ON --
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE
OTHER SITUATION ISN'T WORKING.
PERHAPS WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS A
PIVOT, PERHAPS WE WILL TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.
>> AND WE ARE IN A NEW PARADIGM.
THE UNITED STATES IS NO LONGER
CONSIDERED, BECAUSE OF THE
THINGS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID,
HE WANTS HIS ADMINISTRATION TO
BE MORE INWARDLY FOCUSED, IT IS
A SOVEREIGN NATION AND OTHER
NATIONS SHOULD FEEL FREE TO DO
THE SAME, IT STRIKES ME THAT
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA ARE
MOUFBING AHEAD WITH THE PLANS
THEY HAVE IN PLACE.
CHINA HAS BEEN A PLAYER IN THE
DISCUSSIONS AS WELL.
IT SEEMS WHAT IS HAPPENING IS
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT MADE THE
EARTH TRANSFORMING DECISION TO
MEET WITH A NORTH KOREAN
DICTATOR, THAT WAS HUGE AND A
BIG WIN FOR THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.
HAVING DONE THAT, NOW NORTH
KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA ARE MOVING
ALONG WITH WHATEVER TIMELINE
THEY HAVE IN MIND.
I SUSPECT FOR THE LEADER OF
SOUTH KOREA, HE IS IN TUNE TO
WHAT THE UNITED STATES IS DOING
AND WANTS THE UNITED STATES AS A
PARTNER BUT IS ESTABLISHING
RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS NORTH
KOREAN COUNTERPART THAT MAY IN
ESSENCE ECLIPSE WHAT WE DECIDE
TO DO.
>> THAT IS THE FALL OUT OF AN
AMERICAN FIRST FOREIGN STRATEGY.
WHEN AMERICA PULLS BACK, OTHER
COUNTRIES WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH
THEIR OWN AGENDAS AS THE
PRESIDENT IS SUGGESTING.
THE OTHER SIGNETITARIES OF THE
IRAN DEAL, WILL THEY MOVE
FORWARD WITH WHAT THEY WANT?
WE DO HAVE ERROL BARNETT IN
WASHINGTON COVERING THE MEETING
AND CONFERENCE.
ERROL, WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT THE SECRETARY HAD TO
SAY?
>> THE BIG NEWS OUT OF TODAY'S
PRESS CONFERENCE IS MIKE POMPEO
ANNOUNCED THE U.S. IS PULLING
OUT OF THE TREATY OF AMTY THAT
DATES BACK TO 1955.
IT WAS SIGNED UNDER THE
EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION.
EFFECTIVELY, IT WAS AN AGREEMENT
THAT ESTABLISHED A POSITIVE
RELATIONSHIP AND RECIPROCAL
TRADE.
THE U.S. WILL WITHDRAW FROM THAT
TROETY IN ADDITION TO ORDERING A
TEMPORARY EVACUATION OF THE
DIPLOMATIC STAFF IN SOUTHERN
IRAQ BECAUSE OF IRAN'S MALINE
ACTIVITY ACCORDING TO THE
SECRETARY OF STATE.
AND QUICKLY RELATED TO THE U.N.
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, IRAN HAS
COMPLAINED TO THE LEGAL BODY
THAT MEDIATES DISPUTES BETWEEN
MEMBER NATIONS THAT THE AMERICAN
IMPLEMENTATION OF SANCTIONS
VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS AND OTHER
ISSUES.
THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF
JUSTICE RULED THAT THE YOOUPS
SHOULD WITHDRAW ANY RESTRICTIONS
OF EXPORTING HUMANITARIAN TO
IRAN.
POMPEO ALSO SAID THE U.S. WAS
JUSTIFIED IN IMPLEMENTING
SANCTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
SO WHAT YOU SEE IS A FURTHER
RATCHETING UP OF TENSIONS
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAN AND A
SLIGHT BREAKDOWN OF
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS BETWEEN
THE TWO.
>> AND ERROL, THE OTHER
INTERESTING NEWS OUT OF THE
FOREIGN POLICY CIRCLES TODAY IS
THE STORY IN THE WASHINGTON POST
OF A REPORTER WHO HAS BEEN
DETAINED IN TURKEY.
HIS WIFE WAS WAITING FOR HIM.
HE IS A SOUDY JOURNALIST WHO HAS
WORKED FOR DIFFERENT NEWS
LOCATIONS.
WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
>> THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.
IT IS ONE OF THE MISSING
INDIVIDUAL MYSTERIES.
THE MAN IS AND MALSHOGY.
HE HAS BEEN A JOURNALIST IN
SAUDI ARABIA FOR DECADES.
HE HAS BEEN CRITICAL FOR THE
ACTIVISTS AND PROMINENT
BUSINESSMEN AND OTHERS IN THE
WAKE OF ITS REFORMS.
WE KNOW THAT THEY PERMITTED
WOMEN THE ABILITY TO DRIVE FOR
THE FIRST TIME RECENTLY BUT
STILL DETAINED FEMALE ACTIVISTS.
THIS JOURNALIST WAS CRITICAL OF
THAT DECISION.
HE HAS WORKED FOR THE WASHINGTON
POST AS A COLUMNNIST AND HAS
BEEN CRITICAL OF THIS RULING
FAMILY, A FAMILY THAT HAS SEEN
ACTIVISTS, PROMINENT PEOPLE
DETAINED UNDER THEIR RULE AS
WELL AS JOURNALISTS.
ACCORDING TO OUR PARTNERS AT THE
BBC, THE JOURNALIST WAS GOING TO
THE CONSULATE FOR ROUTINE
PAPERWORK.
HIS FIANCE WAS TOLD TO WAIT
OUTSIDE.
HE DID NOT HAVE HIS MOBILE PHONE
WITH HIM AND THAT WAS LATE
TUESDAY.
THERE HAS BEEN NO WORD FROM HIM
AND WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING
OFFICIALLY YET FROM SAUDI
ARABIAN OFFICIALS.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT
SAID ANYTHING ON BEHALF OF HIM
YET.
THE WASHINGTON POST IS BEING
TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THEY KNOW
BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL SO MANY
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
THAT IS A KEY PUBLICATION IN THE
U.S..
WE WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
IT HAS BEEN ALMOST 24 HOURS
SINCE HE WAS LAST SEEN IN ISTAN
BOULE.
>> I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO
REPORT ON THIS AS WE HAVE SEEN
AN ATTACK ON JOURNALISTS IN THE
PAST SEVERAL YOURS -- YEARS.
WE THANK YOU, ERROL BARNETT.
>> IT IS NOT JUST THAT.
WHEN WE LOOK AT SAUDI ARABIA,
THE CROWN PRINCE HAS BEEN MAKING
MOVES THAT LOOK LIKE LIBERAL
MOVES BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER,
HE IS STILL JAILING ACTIVISTS.
THERE WAS THE BIG FIGHT BETWEEN
CANADA AND SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE
THE FOREIGN MINISTER CRITICIZED
HIM FOR JAILING ACTIVISTS.
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF THINGS
THAT HAVE NOT CHANGED ABOUT THE
KINGDOM.
>> IT IS A MONARCHY.
THE IDEA AND CONCEPT OF HUMAN
RIGHTS AND FREEDOM AND LIBERTY
IS NOT ONE THAT REALLY EXISTS
UNDER AN ABSOLUTE MONARCHY.
THEY CAN PUT IN REFORMS AND DO A
WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT
APPEAR TO SHOW A LOOSENING OF
RESTRICTIONS, THE REALITY IS
UNDER THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT,
IT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO WHOEVER
IS RULING THE COUNTRY.
>> RIGHT.
>> NOT PEOPLE AT THE BALLOT BOX.
>>> WE HAVE A LOT MORE NEWS
AHEAD, YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
