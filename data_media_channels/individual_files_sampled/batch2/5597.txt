do you when you call it a distraction do you want to click do not think that it is an urgent crisis to be dealt with it is it's a genuine crisis that that's my point is our or we as a country willing to use children as pawns as a political strategy I mean why else would you would the president do this why else would Republicans condone this for so long and let it get to the point of being a crisis that's I think that's a legitimate question right when we when we talk about what's happening on the hill I want to play you a little bit of what Chuck Schumer had to say just recently about the idea that Congress would have to step in and do something since the president cruelly is not willing to do that here's what he said get your team together and undo this shameful policy immediately which you can do with a flick of the pen there's no need for legislation there's no need for anything else you can do it so Chuck Schumer is making the point that legislation is not the way to go because the president could with a phone call write reverse this zero tolerance policy or put a pause on it but here's the thing governor the president is clearly not going to do that he is not willing to do that and he seems very firm and adamant on that point as does his administration so should Democrats go ahead and work with Republicans to try to pass some kind of a narrow temporary solution are they taking the wrong tactic by resisting that well I'm not sure any of the legislation proposed yet actually solves this but I I think we've got to do whatever we can to make sure that this you know again child abuse state condone child abuse is is egregious it's outrageous in the in the worst sense of the world in this worst sense of the word and we've got to do whatever we can to make sure that we are trying to end this and not let it go on and on and on it just for political purposes either party thank you for checking out our youtube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
