LATEST MESSAGE IS LOUD AND

00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:11,958
CLEAR.

7
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,761
>> THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE

8
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:15,628
CLEAR.

9
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:18,898
DEMOCRATS PRODUCE MOBS.

10
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,100
REPUBLICANS PRODUCE JOBS.

11
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,901
>> Shannon: ALL RIGHT.

AND ERIC, HIS NEWEST BOOK.

17
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:35,382
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.

18
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:35,682
OKAY.

19
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:37,250
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE.

20
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:40,454
HE’S HAD THIS LINE THAT’S BEEN

21
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:42,889
VERY CATCHY OVER THE LAST COUPLE

VERY CATCHY OVER THE LAST COUPLE

23
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:46,294
OF DAYS, "JOBS NOT MOBS," BUT HE

24
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:48,962
ALSO HAD THIS PROBLEM.

25
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:51,098
TRUMP’S VIDEO FOLLOWED A REMARK

26
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,100
HE MADE WHERE HE SAID, DEMOCRATS
TRUMP’S VIDEO FOLLOWED A REMARK

27
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,101
HE MADE WHERE HE SAID, DEMOCRATS

28
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,068
PRODUCE MOBS, REPUBLICANS

29
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:56,069
PRODUCE JOBS.

30
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,742
BUT HE ALSO DREW CRITICISM FOR

31
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:04,144
JOKING ABOUT SOMEONE BODY

32
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:05,244
SLAMMING A REPORTER.

33
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,081
THE CROWD LOVED IT.

34
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:09,783
BUT IS HE STEPPING ON HIS OWN

35
00:01:09,784 --> 00:01:11,385
"JOBS NOT MOBS" MESSAGE?

36
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:13,287
>> NO, HE’S NOT.

37
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:15,122
ACTUALLY, IT’S SO FUNNY TO ME

38
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:19,260
BECAUSE IN A WAY THE "JOBS NOT

39
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:22,496
MOBS" MESSAGE TIES IN TO THIS.

40
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:23,464
YOUR AVERAGE AMERICAN MAY NOT

41
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:26,100
SAY IT ON TV, BUT THEY SEE

42
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:27,101
WHAT’S GOING ON.

43
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:29,170
THE MOBS WE’VE SEEN, THE LACK OF

44
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,305
RESPECT, THE LACK OF CIVILITY

45
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:35,476
THAT THE LEFT HAS RESORTED TO IS

46
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:35,877
HORRIFYING.

47
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:38,045
IT’S AS UN-AMERICAN AS ANYTHING

48
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:38,746
CAN BE.

49
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:40,281
AND PEOPLE SEE THAT. YOUR

50
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:43,151
AVERAGE AMERICAN, AS I SAY, THEY

51
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,953
MAY NOT THINK OF THEMSELVES AS A
AVERAGE AMERICAN, AS I SAY, THEY

52
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:44,954
MAY NOT THINK OF THEMSELVES AS A

53
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:48,723
CONSERVATIVE OR PRO-TRUMP, BUT

54
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:51,226
IF YOU RUN OUT OF ARGUMENTS, YOU

55
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:52,927
RESORT SO THIS KIND OF THING.

56
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:56,197
BUT I REALLY THINK THEY

57
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:57,832
DISGRACED THEMSELVES.

58
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,901
WHEN TRUMP CRACKS A JOKE LIKE

59
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,202
THAT, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN SEES

60
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:03,471
IT AS A JOKE AND ENJOYS IT.

61
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:05,040
I REALLY THINK THAT WE’VE NEVER

62
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,543
SEEN THE BELTWAY ELITE AS OUT OF
I REALLY THINK THAT WE’VE NEVER

63
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,445
SEEN THE BELTWAY ELITE AS OUT OFTOUCH WITH MIDDLE AMERICA NEVER

64
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:10,446
TOUCH WITH MIDDLE AMERICA NEVER

65
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,113
IN OUR HISTORY.

66
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:14,115
AND IT’S JUST A DRAMATIC DIVIDE.

67
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:16,485
>> Shannon: THE CROWD IN MONTANA
AND IT’S JUST A DRAMATIC DIVIDE.

68
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:16,486
>> Shannon: THE CROWD IN MONTANA

69
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,387
LIKES IT.

70
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,957
BUT THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSING ON

71
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,494
HOLDER, WATERS, AND SAYING, THIS
BUT THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSING ON

72
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:25,495
HOLDER, WATERS, AND SAYING, THIS

73
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:26,461
HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND.

74
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,563
HE’S USING IT TO CAMPAIGN

75
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,965
AGAINST HIM.

76
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:34,069
>> HE’S ATTACKING DEMOCRATS AND

77
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,436
REPORTERS.

78
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:37,306
AND I THINK IT’S KIND OF

79
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,508
UNFORTUNATE GIVEN YOUR PREVIOUS

80
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,842
SEGMENT.

81
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,543
THIS WEEK HE’S SAYING IT’S SO

82
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:42,878
FUNNY TO BODY SLAM A REPORTER.

83
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,880
TO ME, AGAIN, THERE ARE PEOPLE

84
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,281
WHO MIGHT SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

85
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:49,084
NO SNOWFLAKE, HE’S NO

86
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,119
POLITICALLY CORRECT GUY.

87
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,954
HE MAKES FUN OF THESE PEOPLE.

88
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:53,122
WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?

89
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,624
BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MOCKERY,

90
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,892
ABOUT GOING AFTER PEOPLE, AGAIN,
BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MOCKERY,

91
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:56,893
ABOUT GOING AFTER PEOPLE, AGAIN,

92
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,227
I THINK PEOPLE THINK, WHAT IS

93
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,195
GOING ON?

94
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,296
THAT’S NOT PRESIDENTIAL.

95
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:03,666
THAT’S NOT THE WAY THAT ANYBODY

96
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,967
WOULD THINK AMERICA’S LEADER

97
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:06,002
SHOULD BEHAVE.

98
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:07,370
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU ACTUALLY

99
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:09,805
INVITE THE IDEA THAT THE TRUMP

100
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,874
RALLIES WHERE HE’S TALKING ABOUT

101
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,676
THE AMERICAN PRESS IS ENEMY OF

102
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,411
THE PEOPLE AND HE’S GOING ON,

103
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:19,048
HE’S THINKING, HEY, GEE, THESE

104
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,184
RALLIES GET OUT OF CONTROL.

105
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,187
THEY LOOK MORE LIKE MOB THAN

106
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:25,154
SOMEBODY SIMPLY CALLING SOMEBODY

107
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,689
OUT AND SAYING, YOU’RE MY

108
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,058
REPRESENTATIVE AND I WANT YOU TO

109
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,593
HEAR MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN

110
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:31,261
AMERICAN CITIZEN.

111
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,028
>> THAT’S RIDICULOUS.

112
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:34,230
I’M AMAZED THAT YOU SAY THINGS

113
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:34,864
LIKE THAT.

114
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:37,000
I’VE WATCHED YOU FOR YEARS.

115
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,368
I RESPECT YOU.

116
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,136
YOU’RE FALLING INTO THIS TRAP OF

117
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,771
TRYING TO PULL ANY POLITICAL

118
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:42,439
THREAD YOU CAN.

119
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,441
THE IDEA THAT THESE RALLIES,

120
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:46,309
THAT ANYTHING BAD IS GOING ON,

121
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,744
THAT’S SHEER NONSENSE.

122
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,479
IT’S SHEER NONSENSE.

123
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,114
YOU CAN RAISE YOUR EYEBROWS.

124
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:53,416
IT’S NONSENSE.

125
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:59,089
THE ONLY TIME PEOPLE SEE SIEL --

126
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,126
VIOLENCE IS WITH ANTIFA.

127
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,728
>> REMEMBER THAT AT TRUMP

128
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,730
RALLIES DURING THE CAMPAIGN YOU

129
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:10,834
HAD FIGHTS BREAKING OUT AND THE
RALLIES DURING THE CAMPAIGN YOU

130
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:14,271
HAD FIGHTS BREAKING OUT AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING, GO AHEAD, I’LL

131
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:14,272
PRESIDENT SAYING, GO AHEAD, I’LL

132
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:14,905
PAY YOUR BILLS.

133
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:18,509
>> THAT HAPPENED ONE TIME.

134
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,476
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

135
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:23,213
>> WAS THAT A REAL MOB?

136
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:24,448
>> Shannon: WE’RE NOT SAYING THE

137
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,150
PRESIDENT WAS ENCOURAGING

138
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:33,791
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN

139
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:34,258
CHARLOTTESVILLE.

140
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:40,464
>> YOU’RE GOING BACK TO

141
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:40,931
CHARLOTTESVILLE?

142
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,634
YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

143
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:44,635
YOU’RE TOO SMART.

144
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:46,370
YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.

145
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,973
I HAVE SEEN VIOLENT LEFT-WING

146
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:50,541
MOBS IN MANHATTAN.

147
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:53,478
F THE COPS, F THE COPS.

148
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:54,679
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF

149
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,113
CONTROL.

150
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:57,148
A HUGE LEFT-WING MOB.

151
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:00,651
AND YOU KNOW WHO WAS PROTECTING

152
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:01,185
THEM?

153
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:02,086
THE COPS.

154
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:03,688
THEY WERE STANDING THERE WHILE

155
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,456
PEOPLE PRACTICALLY SPIT IN THEIR

156
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:05,757
FACE.

157
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:07,125
>> THE REPUBLICANS AND PRESIDENT

158
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:09,193
TRUMP AT THIS MOMENT DON’T HAVE
>> THE REPUBLICANS AND PRESIDENT

159
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:09,194
TRUMP AT THIS MOMENT DON’T HAVE

160
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:10,461
A STRONG MESSAGE.

161
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:12,230
THE TAX CUTS HAVEN’T WORKED.

162
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,899
>> THAT’S A JOKE.

163
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,668
THAT’S AMAZING TO ME.

164
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:17,969
THAT’S HILARIOUS.

165
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,870
>> Shannon: I THINK YOU’RE BOTH

166
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:20,271
SMART INTELLIGENT GUYS.

167
00:05:20,272 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I DON’T THINK WE’RE GOING TO
