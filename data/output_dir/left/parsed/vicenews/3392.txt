she's so bright right love that I feel
so awkward and weird
this kind of reminds me of back a little
bit like the sliding guitar I'll pass on
a tambourine generally it's not my
favorite instrument I think they're kind
of annoying hard to keep time on a
tambourine it's actually like pretty
skillful
okay so I have really strong feelings
about Ariana Grande God is a woman great
title just kind of feel like she's the
best pop star right now the songs that
she is releasing are super progressive
for like top 40 her voice is just like
super dynamic me my voice
compared to Ariana's voice it's like you
could not get to further apart like
voices
ever she has like range and pitch and
tone and I'm just like yeah I'm like a
Stan understand I understand
that's my favorite song that you framed
me so far and loved the vocal production
the Chop is really good feels very epic
okay so I would have with that
when I was like 15 16 in my like panic
at the disco Fall Out Boy it's very
nostalgic for me because it reminds me
of like my emo phase it reminds me of
like the time I look through all the
colored clothes out of my wardrobe and
was like miserable just but
inside really happy but it was like I
have to be miserable come on now
you
you
