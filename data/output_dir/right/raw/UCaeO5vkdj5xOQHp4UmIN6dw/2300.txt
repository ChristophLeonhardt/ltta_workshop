swiftly toward the cliff<font color="#E5E5E5"> of destruction</font>

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,480
with a corrupt woman at the wheel or

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,910
whether we'd prefer a man whether we're

going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue on the path to tyranny</font>

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,570
and mediocrity or whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll stop off</font>

11
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,220
at mediocrity first and then head on to

Clavin show has collected a series of

15
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,990
test questions that should train you to

16
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,750
recognize which choice is worse here we

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,170
go which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse a to elect a president</font>

18
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,210
who has mistreated women disparage

19
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,430
minorities and proposed idiotic policies

20
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,200
that will continue America's decline or

that plus the comical hair which is

23
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,610
worse a to have our news media rightly

persecuting her husband's rape victims

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,329
or C to have our news media which is

31
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,670
worse a to live in a country<font color="#E5E5E5"> where women</font>

aside just<font color="#E5E5E5"> long enough to denounce</font>

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,740
what she was laughing about you know I'm

322
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,280
sorry Hillary Clinton is every inch as

323
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,200
bad as Donald Trump he's dishonest she's

324
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,400
greedy she is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so ambitious as</font>

325
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,710
to have lost all sense of right and

326
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,839
wrong in her life she lied she has a

327
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,790
glitch in her head in the same way Trump

328
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,290
has this glitch where he has to defend

329
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,529
them

330
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:06,759
selfie<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this glitch where she lies</font>

331
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,069
even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't need to lie she lies</font>

332
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,810
about anything she's a terrible person

333
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,329
this tape also is nonsense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

334
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,480
I mean the truth the truth is the Trump

335
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,670
tape is nonsense and this is nonsense so

336
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,699
now they go on to the debate and Trump

337
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,379
won I did Trump didn't win he like I

338
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,300
thought thought he kind of trumped her I

339
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,319
thought he kind of trounced her

340
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,470
basically and he won in two ways one is

341
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,459
he did exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I said he should do</font>

342
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,199
my wife came in and said do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

343
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:36,399
listen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you they were actually</font>

344
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">listening to the show they may be you</font>

345
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,519
know because what i said is he/she

346
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,860
attacks him he turns it around and

347
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,529
attacks her and this worked in two ways

348
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,089
the first way is the personal way

349
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:48,249
because she<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

350
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:50,129
all get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tape they all pylon and</font>

351
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,199
he turns it around with the bill clinton

352
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,209
thing and now who can tell him he

353
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,230
doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right to bring this up</font>

354
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,149
who can tell him this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fair game</font>

355
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,879
anymore so here's him turning on bill on

356
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,269
the bill if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at bill clinton far</font>

357
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,209
worse minor words and his was action his

358
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">was what he's done to women there's</font>

359
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,300
never been anybody in the history of

360
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
politics in this nation that's been so

361
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,870
abusive to women so you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> any way</font>

362
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,389
you want to say it but bill clinton was

363
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">abusive to women Hillary Clinton</font>

364
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,209
attacked those same women and attacked

365
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,309
them viciously four of them here<font color="#CCCCCC"> tonight</font>

366
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:30,759
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the women who is a wonderful</font>

367
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,839
woman at 12 years old was raped at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

368
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,559
her client she represented got him off

369
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,959
and she's seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> laughing on two separate</font>

370
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,699
occasions laughing at the girl who was

371
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:45,639
raped<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kathy Shelton that young woman is</font>

372
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,870
here with us tonight so<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't tell me</font>

373
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,290
about words<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely i apologize</font>

374
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,009
for those words but it is things that

375
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">people say but what President Clinton</font>

376
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,649
did he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> impeached he lost his license</font>

377
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,439
to practice law he had to pay an eight

378
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,959
hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty thousand dollar fine</font>

379
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,019
to one of the women Paula Jones who's

380
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,870
also here tonight and I will tell you

381
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,990
that when Hilary brings up a point like

382
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she talks about</font>

383
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,389
words that I said 11 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I think</font>

384
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,039
it's disgraceful and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> she should</font>

385
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,719
be ashamed of herself if you want to

386
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:28,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the truth I'm sorry but that's a</font>

387
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,249
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> response</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at this perfectly fair</font>

388
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:31,389
response because the whole point about

389
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,329
Trump is that is not that he's any good

390
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,549
it's that she's just as bad and the

391
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:37,929
media covers for her and that makes her

392
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,459
look even worse we got to say goodbye to

393
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:41,859
Facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> and YouTube but come over to</font>

394
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,449
the daily wire and hear the rest we got

395
00:15:43,449 --> 00:00:00,000
a lot more coming up
