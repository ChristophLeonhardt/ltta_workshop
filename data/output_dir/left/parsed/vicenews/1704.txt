 
Hey hey hey!
I will not accept fighting!
It's very hard to make people calm down.  There's a real fear of dying in the water.
I think I have something.
150 degrees maybe... on the horizon.
(Unintelligible)... Yea
It's right there.
Guys!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Calm down! Ok?!
Don't come in this way. Don't come in this way!
Listen to this man.
My friend, hey!
Easy, easy, easy
Ok, one by one. Thank you.
Ok, much better.
Ok, perfect!
That was a mess.
