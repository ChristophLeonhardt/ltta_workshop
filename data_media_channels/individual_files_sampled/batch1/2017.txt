you've talked about wanting to put extreme betting on people trying to come into the United States but I wonder if you would consider extreme betting for people trying to buy a gun trying to what buy a gun well you know you're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now we could let a little time go by but it's okay if you feel that that's an appropriate question even though we're the heart of South Korea I will certainly answer your question if you did what you're suggesting there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him and I can only say this if he didn't have a gun instead of having 26 dead he would have had hundreds more dead so that's the way I feel about it and are you not gonna help and are you considering any kind of gun control policy and you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation in Chicago and Chicago is a disaster it's a total disaster just remember if this man didn't have a gun or a rifle you'd be talking about a much worse situation in the great state of Texas thank you
