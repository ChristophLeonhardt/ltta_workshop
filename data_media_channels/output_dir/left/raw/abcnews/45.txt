1
01:52:19,332 --> 01:52:19,532
NOT.

2
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:21,701
BUT HE'S PRETTY MUCH GIVEN US AN

3
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:23,302
OUTLINE OF WHAT HE WOULD FIND

4
01:52:23,302 --> 01:52:24,604
ACCEPTABLE WHICH AGAIN, IN SO

5
01:52:24,604 --> 01:52:26,839
FAR AS IT GRANTS A PATH OF

6
01:52:26,839 --> 01:52:28,140
CITIZENSHIP FOR 1.8 MILLION

7
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:30,009
PEOPLE, THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY IN

8
01:52:30,009 --> 01:52:31,944
AND OF ITSELF.

9
01:52:31,944 --> 01:52:33,613
BUT THE MAJORITY LEADER MADE A

10
01:52:33,613 --> 01:52:34,680
COMMITMENT TO HOLD THIS DEBATE

11
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,649
AND TO HOLD IT THIS WEEK.

12
01:52:36,649 --> 01:52:38,985
HE HAS LIVED UP TO HIS PROMISE.

13
01:52:38,985 --> 01:52:40,553
AND NOW WE CAN'T LET IT ALL GO

14
01:52:40,553 --> 01:52:43,656
TO WASTE, WHICH AS EACH MINUTE

15
01:52:43,656 --> 01:52:45,892
AND EACH HOUR THAT CLICKS OFF

16
01:52:45,892 --> 01:52:48,995
THE TOP -- THE CLOCK, IT LOOKS

17
01:52:48,995 --> 01:52:51,764
LIKE THAT IS MORE AND MORE

18
01:52:51,764 --> 01:52:52,832
LIKELY TO HAPPEN, THAT ALL OF

19
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:54,934
THIS WILL GO TO WASTE.

20
01:52:54,934 --> 01:52:56,235
THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING.

21
01:52:56,235 --> 01:52:58,571
THE DACA RECIPIENTS IN MY HOME

22
01:52:58,571 --> 01:53:01,941
STATE, ALL 124,000 OF THEM, ARE

23
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:06,245
WATCHING AND WORRYING,

24
01:53:06,245 --> 01:53:07,046
UNDERSTANDABLY ANXIOUS ABOUT

25
01:53:07,046 --> 01:53:08,381
WHAT THEIR STATUS IS GOING TO BE

26
01:53:08,381 --> 01:53:11,617
WHEN THIS PROGRAM ENDS ON MARCH

27
01:53:11,617 --> 01:53:13,519
5.

28
01:53:13,519 --> 01:53:16,322
ONE OF THOSE DACA RECIPIENTS IS

29
01:53:16,322 --> 01:53:20,493
JULIO RAMOS, A BIOLOGY TEACHER

30
01:53:20,493 --> 01:53:23,429
WHO IS GETTING HIS MASTER DEGREE

31
01:53:23,429 --> 01:53:29,669
IN BIOMEDICAL INFRAMATICS.

32
01:53:29,669 --> 01:53:31,470
HE IS A DACA RECIPIENT.

33
01:53:31,470 --> 01:53:32,972
AFTER HIS MOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED

34
01:53:32,972 --> 01:53:33,839
WITH BREAST CANCER, HE DECIDED

35
01:53:33,839 --> 01:53:37,176
HE WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR.

36
01:53:37,176 --> 01:53:38,711
HE'S EVEN BEEN ACCEPTED INTO

37
01:53:38,711 --> 01:53:40,513
TEXAS MEDICAL SCHOOLS, BUT HE

38
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:42,181
WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE WOULD BE

39
01:53:42,181 --> 01:53:44,483
ALLOWED TO ATTEND.

40
01:53:44,483 --> 01:53:48,354
HE'S WAITING AND WATCHING,

41
01:53:48,354 --> 01:53:50,222
WORRIED ABOUT LIZ FUTURE.

42
01:53:50,222 --> 01:53:51,958
-- WORRIED ABOUT HIS FUTURE.

43
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:55,861
THEN THERE'S MIRIAM SANTAMARIE

44
01:53:55,861 --> 01:53:57,063
FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS.

45
01:53:57,063 --> 01:53:58,230
SHE GRADUATED FROM HOUSTON HIGH

46
01:53:58,230 --> 01:53:59,532
SCHOOL WITH HONORS.

47
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:00,833
SHE PAID HER WAY THROUGH

48
01:54:00,833 --> 01:54:02,034
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND SHE WORKS

49
01:54:02,034 --> 01:54:03,436
AS A MANAGER AT A CONSTRUCTION

50
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:05,805
COMPANY AND OWNS HER OWN

51
01:54:05,805 --> 01:54:06,639
PHOTOGRAPHY BUSINESS.

52
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:07,573
SOUNDS LIKE QUITE AN

53
01:54:07,573 --> 01:54:10,109
ENTREPRENEUR TO ME.

54
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:11,944
MIRIAM SAID, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR

55
01:54:11,944 --> 01:54:14,480
ANY KIND OF RECOGNITION OR

56
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:15,381
SYMPATHY.

57
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:18,384
I JUST WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE

58
01:54:18,384 --> 01:54:19,785
AND INSPIRE OTHERS.

59
01:54:19,785 --> 01:54:21,387
SHE'S ALSO LOOKING TO LIVE IN

60
01:54:21,387 --> 01:54:23,022
PEACE IN THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT

61
01:54:23,022 --> 01:54:26,125
SHE'S EVER KNOWN, THAT SHE CALLS

62
01:54:26,125 --> 01:54:26,359
HOME.

63
01:54:26,359 --> 01:54:27,293
SHE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES

64
01:54:27,293 --> 01:54:30,663
WHEN SHE WAS 4 YEARS OLD.

65
01:54:30,663 --> 01:54:32,631
FINALLY, THERE IS A MAN WHO I'LL

66
01:54:32,631 --> 01:54:35,201
JUST CALL BY THE FIRST NAME OF

67
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:35,568
DANIEL.

68
01:54:35,568 --> 01:54:37,003
HE, TOO, LIVES IN TEXAS.

69
01:54:37,003 --> 01:54:38,170
HE GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY

70
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:40,473
OF NORTH TEXAS WITH A DEGREE IN

71
01:54:40,473 --> 01:54:42,541
ADVERTISING AND CONTRIBUTES

72
01:54:42,541 --> 01:54:44,844
PRODUCTIVELY TO SOCIETY.

73
01:54:44,844 --> 01:54:47,279
DANIEL CAME FROM MEXICO AT THE

74
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:49,448
AGE OF 2.

75
01:54:49,448 --> 01:54:51,584
AND HE SAID, ALL THE CHOICES I

76
01:54:51,584 --> 01:54:53,652
MAKE I MADE AS AN AMERICAN

77
01:54:53,652 --> 01:54:57,423
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I AM.

78
01:54:57,423 --> 01:54:59,025
WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THESE

79
01:54:59,025 --> 01:55:01,894
STORIES AS WE CONSIDER THIS

80
01:55:01,894 --> 01:55:03,295
LEGISLATION AND AS PEOPLE ARE

81
01:55:03,295 --> 01:55:05,264
PERHAPS TEMPTED INTO THE

82
01:55:05,264 --> 01:55:07,433
POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING AND

83
01:55:07,433 --> 01:55:09,035
GAMESMANSHIP THAT UNFORTUNATELY

84
01:55:09,035 --> 01:55:11,370
SOMETIMES OVERWHELMS OUR BEST

85
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:11,704
INTENTIONS.

86
01:55:11,704 --> 01:55:13,806
THESE ARE REAL HUMAN LIVES

87
01:55:13,806 --> 01:55:16,075
HANGING IN THE BALANCE.

88
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:18,010
THEY'RE IMPORTANT.

89
01:55:18,010 --> 01:55:21,013
THEY TEACH US ABOUT THE REAL

90
01:55:21,013 --> 01:55:23,616
PEOPLE BEHIND THE POLICY.

91
01:55:23,616 --> 01:55:24,683
BUT THEIR STORIES ARE NOT THE

92
01:55:24,683 --> 01:55:26,685
ONLY ONES WE NEED TO LISTEN TO.

93
01:55:26,685 --> 01:55:28,120
WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THE STORIES

94
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:29,321
OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE

95
01:55:29,321 --> 01:55:30,956
BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY FOR YEARS

96
01:55:30,956 --> 01:55:33,793
TO COME HERE IN A LEGAL WAY

97
01:55:33,793 --> 01:55:37,063
THROUGH VISAS AND GREEN CARDS,

98
01:55:37,063 --> 01:55:38,697
WAITING PATIENTLY TO JOIN THEIR

99
01:55:38,697 --> 01:55:41,067
FAMILIES HERE IN THE UNITED

100
01:55:41,067 --> 01:55:42,935
STATES DOING IT THE OLD FASHION

101
01:55:42,935 --> 01:55:44,003
LEGAL WAY.

102
01:55:44,003 --> 01:55:45,771
BUT THEY'VE HAD TO WAIT, SOME

103
01:55:45,771 --> 01:55:48,407
FOR YEARS, SOME FOR DECADES.

104
01:55:48,407 --> 01:55:50,376
AND WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THE

105
01:55:50,376 --> 01:55:51,911
STORIES OF THE BORDER

106
01:55:51,911 --> 01:55:53,212
COMMUNITIES THAT I'M PROUD TO

107
01:55:53,212 --> 01:55:55,714
REPRESENT IN TEXAS.

108
01:55:55,714 --> 01:55:59,552
FOR MEN AND WOMEN, MANY OF WHOM

109
01:55:59,552 --> 01:56:01,654
ARE OF HISPANIC ORIGIN, WHO

110
01:56:01,654 --> 01:56:03,355
SUFFERED PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM

111
01:56:03,355 --> 01:56:07,326
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- ILLEGAL

112
01:56:07,326 --> 01:56:08,394
IMMIGRATION IS A PRETTY UGLY

113
01:56:08,394 --> 01:56:09,228
BUSINESS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT

114
01:56:09,228 --> 01:56:12,898
IT'S IN THE HANDS OF DRUG

115
01:56:12,898 --> 01:56:14,266
CARTELS AND TRANSNATIONAL

116
01:56:14,266 --> 01:56:16,135
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS.

117
01:56:16,135 --> 01:56:18,404
RECENTLY ONE OF THE MILITARY

118
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:20,806
LEADERS WHOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR

119
01:56:20,806 --> 01:56:22,842
SOUTHERN COMMAND, WHICH IS

120
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:24,043
CENTRAL AMERICA SOUTH, HE SAID

121
01:56:24,043 --> 01:56:25,311
THAT THESE TRANSNATIONAL

122
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:27,513
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS OR■■

123
01:56:27,513 --> 01:56:30,015
CARTELS ARE COMMODITY AGNOSTIC

124
01:56:30,015 --> 01:56:31,450
IS THE PHRASE HE USED.

125
01:56:31,450 --> 01:56:33,519
HE SAID THEY DON'T CARE WHETHER

126
01:56:33,519 --> 01:56:36,088
IT'S PEOPLE, IT'S DRUGS, OR

127
01:56:36,088 --> 01:56:37,723
OTHER CONTRA BAND.

128
01:56:37,723 --> 01:56:39,358
WHAT THEY'RE IN IT FOR IS THE

129
01:56:39,358 --> 01:56:39,925
MONEY.

130
01:56:39,925 --> 01:56:41,460
AND THEY'RE WILLING TO DO

131
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:44,730
ANYTHING FOR THE MONEY.

132
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:48,300
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE VICTIMS OF

133
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,502
HUMAN TRAFFICKING KNOW EXACTLY

134
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:52,471
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

135
01:56:52,471 --> 01:56:54,240
DESPITE THESE HARDSHIPS,

136
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,008
BUSINESS IN MANY OF THE

137
01:56:56,008 --> 01:56:58,310
COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE ALONG THE

138
01:56:58,310 --> 01:57:00,980
BORDER ARE THRIVING, BUT WE NEED

139
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:02,148
TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE

140
01:57:02,148 --> 01:57:03,382
SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES TO BE

141
01:57:03,382 --> 01:57:05,985
THE CASE.

142
01:57:05,985 --> 01:57:08,420
SYMPATHY FOR DACA RECIPIENTS IS

143
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:10,156
RIGHT AND GOOD BECAUSE IN

144
01:57:10,156 --> 01:57:12,291
AMERICA, WE DO NOT PUNISH

145
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:13,859
CHILDREN FOR THE MISTAKES OF

146
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:15,594
THEIR PARENTS.

147
01:57:15,594 --> 01:57:17,763
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUNISH

148
01:57:17,763 --> 01:57:19,131
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW

149
01:57:19,131 --> 01:57:20,666
ADULTS AND HAVE BECOME PART OF

150
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:22,468
OUR COMMUNITIES.

151
01:57:22,468 --> 01:57:24,203
BUT THOSE AMERICANS WHO LIVE

152
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:26,972
ALONG THE BORDER IN MY STATE

153
01:57:26,972 --> 01:57:28,274
REALIZE THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

154
01:57:28,274 --> 01:57:31,677
HAS CAUSED REAL TANGIBLE HARM IN

155
01:57:31,677 --> 01:57:35,814
TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY, IN TERMS

156
01:57:35,814 --> 01:57:38,417
OF PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND THEIR

157
01:57:38,417 --> 01:57:40,586
WAY OF LIFE.

158
01:57:40,586 --> 01:57:44,723
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE MANNY

159
01:57:44,723 --> 01:57:46,459
PADIA, THE BORDER PATROL SECTOR

160
01:57:46,459 --> 01:57:48,360
CHIEF IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY,

161
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:49,528
IT'S HARD NOT TO REALIZE JUST

162
01:57:49,528 --> 01:57:51,163
HOW MUCH IS REQUIRED, HOW MANY

163
01:57:51,163 --> 01:57:52,932
MORE RESOURCES WE NEED TO

164
01:57:52,932 --> 01:57:55,000
MAINTAIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

165
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,101
AND OPERATIONAL CONTROL ALONG

166
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:57,803
THE BORDER.

167
01:57:57,803 --> 01:57:59,305
AND I'LL SAY THIS, MADAM

168
01:57:59,305 --> 01:57:59,905
PRESIDENT.

169
01:57:59,905 --> 01:58:02,074
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

170
01:58:02,074 --> 01:58:03,475
FAILED OVER THE YEARS TO LIVE UP

171
01:58:03,475 --> 01:58:05,644
TO ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO

172
01:58:05,644 --> 01:58:07,513
MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF OUR

173
01:58:07,513 --> 01:58:08,747
BORDER.

174
01:58:08,747 --> 01:58:10,849
AND SO TAXPAYERS IN MY STATE

175
01:58:10,849 --> 01:58:13,485
HAVE TO STEP UP AND FILL THE GAP

176
01:58:13,485 --> 01:58:14,887
LEFT BY THE FAILURE OF

177
01:58:14,887 --> 01:58:16,855
LEADERSHIP AT THE FEDERAL

178
01:58:16,855 --> 01:58:17,189
GOVERNMENT.

179
01:58:17,189 --> 01:58:19,158
BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

180
01:58:19,158 --> 01:58:22,895
FIX THAT IN THIS LEGISLATION.

181
01:58:22,895 --> 01:58:24,530
FOLLOWING THE PARAMETERS THAT

182
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:27,866
THE PRESIDENT HAS LAID OUT FOR

183
01:58:27,866 --> 01:58:28,667
US.

184
01:58:28,667 --> 01:58:31,537
THAT'S WHY DURING THIS WEEK'S

185
01:58:31,537 --> 01:58:33,205
DEBATE, ENSURING ADDITIONAL

186
01:58:33,205 --> 01:58:34,707
RESOURCES FOR BORDER SECURITY IS

187
01:58:34,707 --> 01:58:36,141
AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF THE

188
01:58:36,141 --> 01:58:36,408
PUZZLE.

189
01:58:36,408 --> 01:58:38,811
THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY IN THE

190
01:58:38,811 --> 01:58:40,546
AREAS BETWEEN THE PORTS OF

191
01:58:40,546 --> 01:58:42,681
ENTRY, BUT WE HAVE -- WELL,

192
01:58:42,681 --> 01:58:44,350
MEXICO IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST

193
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:45,150
TRADING PARTNERS.

194
01:58:45,150 --> 01:58:47,052
WE HAVE LEGITIMATE TRADE AND

195
01:58:47,052 --> 01:58:49,555
WHICHERS THAT FLOWS BACK --

196
01:58:49,555 --> 01:58:51,056
COMMERCE THAT FLOWS BACK AND

197
01:58:51,056 --> 01:58:52,524
FORTH THE BORDER WITH MEXICO

198
01:58:52,524 --> 01:58:53,792
THAT SUPPORTS FIVE MILLION

199
01:58:53,792 --> 01:58:54,627
AMERICAN JOBS.

200
01:58:54,627 --> 01:58:55,594
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE CARTELS

201
01:58:55,594 --> 01:58:57,363
HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO EXPLOIT

202
01:58:57,363 --> 01:58:58,063
THAT AS WELL.

203
01:58:58,063 --> 01:59:01,033
SO BECAUSE OF ANTIQUATED

204
01:59:01,033 --> 01:59:02,568
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY AT

205
01:59:02,568 --> 01:59:05,237
OUR PORTS OF ENTRY, MANY OF THEM

206
01:59:05,237 --> 01:59:07,773
ARE VULNERABLE TO THE

207
01:59:07,773 --> 01:59:10,743
IMPORTATION OF POISON, LITERALLY

208
01:59:10,743 --> 01:59:12,978
DRUGS LIKE METHAMPHETAMINE,

209
01:59:12,978 --> 01:59:14,480
COCAINE, HEROIN, AND THE LIKE

210
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:15,714
THAT'S TAKEN THE LIVES OF SO

211
01:59:15,714 --> 01:59:16,281
MANY AMERICANS.

212
01:59:16,281 --> 01:59:18,684
AND WE NEED TO DO MORE AND

213
01:59:18,684 --> 01:59:20,886
BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO

214
01:59:20,886 --> 01:59:22,621
MAINTAINING THOSE PORTS OF

215
01:59:22,621 --> 01:59:23,922
ENTRY, UPGRADING THE

216
01:59:23,922 --> 01:59:24,890
INFRASTRUCTURE, IMPROVING THE

217
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:26,859
TECHNOLOGY SO WE CAN INTERDICT

218
01:59:26,859 --> 01:59:30,929
MORE OF THAT.

219
01:59:30,929 --> 01:59:33,399
AGAIN, THE BORDER IS AS VARIED

220
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:36,368
AS ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD WITH

221
01:59:36,368 --> 01:59:37,803
AREAS THAT ARE FLAT AND OPEN AND

222
01:59:37,803 --> 01:59:39,672
AREAS THAT HAVE MOUNTAINS AND

223
01:59:39,672 --> 01:59:44,009
ROLLING HILLS, RIVERS OBVIOUSLY,

224
01:59:44,009 --> 01:59:45,311
AND TECHNOLOGY AS WE'VE COME TO

225
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:47,413
SEE AS TRANSFORMED OUR WAY OF

226
01:59:47,413 --> 01:59:47,780
LIFE.

227
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:49,048
AND TECHNOLOGY CAN INCREASINGLY

228
01:59:49,048 --> 01:59:51,917
BE THE ANSWER TO SUPPLEMENT

229
01:59:51,917 --> 01:59:53,319
THOSE BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND

230
01:59:53,319 --> 01:59:54,586
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE

231
01:59:54,586 --> 01:59:57,456
BORDER PATROL THINKS ARE

232
01:59:57,456 --> 01:59:59,925
NECESSARY.

233
01:59:59,925 --> 02:00:01,827
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

234
02:00:01,827 --> 02:00:03,095
DETECTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN

235
02:00:03,095 --> 02:00:05,331
RURAL AREAS AND URBAN ONES.

236
02:00:05,331 --> 02:00:06,398
IN URBAN AREAS YOU MIGHT JUST

237
02:00:06,398 --> 02:00:08,834
HAVE A FEW SECONDS, THE BOARDER

238
02:00:08,834 --> 02:00:10,369
PATROL TELLS US, BEFORE SOMEBODY

239
02:00:10,369 --> 02:00:12,204
CAN CROSS THE BORDER AND ENTER

240
02:00:12,204 --> 02:00:13,372
INTO THE UNITED STATES.

241
02:00:13,372 --> 02:00:15,140
IN LARGE, OPEN AREAS, THERE'S

242
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:17,343
MORE OF A LAG TIME.

243
02:00:17,343 --> 02:00:20,913
AND SO, PERHAPS, A FENCE OR SOME

244
02:00:20,913 --> 02:00:22,414
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT AS

245
02:00:22,414 --> 02:00:22,714
IMPORTANT.

246
02:00:22,714 --> 02:00:24,616
TECHNOLOGY MIGHT BE MORE

247
02:00:24,616 --> 02:00:25,784
IMPORTANT ALONG WITH THE BORDER

248
02:00:25,784 --> 02:00:28,654
PATROL AGENTS THEMSELVES.

249
02:00:28,654 --> 02:00:30,289
MY BASIC POINT IS THAT BOARDER

250
02:00:30,289 --> 02:00:32,257
SECURITY IS COMPLEX.

251
02:00:32,257 --> 02:00:33,892
FOR THOSE WHO THINK IT'S AS EASY

252
02:00:33,892 --> 02:00:35,661
AS ONE, TWO, THREE, I WOULD

253
02:00:35,661 --> 02:00:37,463
ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO, AS SOME OF

254
02:00:37,463 --> 02:00:39,531
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE, AND

255
02:00:39,531 --> 02:00:41,333
THAT IS TRAVEL TO THE BORDER.

256
02:00:41,333 --> 02:00:42,267
WE'LL HOST YOU.

257
02:00:42,267 --> 02:00:45,037
SEE IT FIRSTHAND TO SEE WHY IT'S

258
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:46,705
CRUCIAL THAT WE STRENGTHEN OUR

259
02:00:46,705 --> 02:00:47,673
PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY, AND

260
02:00:47,673 --> 02:00:48,073
INFRASTRUCTURE.

261
02:00:48,073 --> 02:00:49,942
AND THAT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF OUR

262
02:00:49,942 --> 02:00:50,309
PRIORITIES.

263
02:00:50,309 --> 02:00:51,910
AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THE

264
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:53,212
PRESIDENT FOR MAKING THIS ONE OF

265
02:00:53,212 --> 02:00:56,014
HIS REQUIREMENTS AS WELL.

266
02:00:56,014 --> 02:00:58,617
SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, MADAM

267
02:00:58,617 --> 02:01:02,154
PRESIDENT, TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY

268
02:01:02,154 --> 02:01:03,455
THE ANXIETY AND PLIGHT OF THESE

269
02:01:03,455 --> 02:01:05,691
DACA RECIPIENTS BUT ALSO TO MAKE

270
02:01:05,691 --> 02:01:07,893
OUR COUNTRY SAFER AND MORE

271
02:01:07,893 --> 02:01:08,160
SECURE.

272
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:11,597
AND ALSO TO REFORM OUR LEGAL

273
02:01:11,597 --> 02:01:12,765
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT

274
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:28,347
WILL HELP US ACCELERATE

275
02:01:28,347 --> 02:01:30,549
THE ROLL OF THE DICE IN THE

276
02:01:30,549 --> 02:01:31,950
DIVERSITY LOTTERY THAT MAKES

277
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:33,252
LITTLE SENSE GIVEN OUR NEED FOR

278
02:01:33,252 --> 02:01:37,856
PEOPLE WITH JOB-BASED SKILLS AND

279
02:01:37,856 --> 02:01:39,858
GRADUATE DEGREES AND OTHER

280
02:01:39,858 --> 02:01:41,460
MERIT-BASED CRITERIA THAT WOULD

281
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:42,361
MAKE THEM VALUABLE TO THE UNITED

282
02:01:42,361 --> 02:01:45,330
STATES IN ADDITION TO WINNING

283
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:47,433
THE LOTTERY.

284
02:01:47,433 --> 02:01:48,834
SO, MADAM PRESIDENT, I HOPE

285
02:01:48,834 --> 02:01:50,135
WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

286
02:01:50,135 --> 02:01:52,671
OPPORTUNITY THIS WEEK.

287
02:01:52,671 --> 02:01:53,639
TIME IS WASTING.

288
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:54,106
IT'S WEDNESDAY.

289
02:01:54,106 --> 02:01:55,307
WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO WASTE

290
02:01:55,307 --> 02:01:55,874
AT ALL.

291
02:01:55,874 --> 02:01:56,642
MADAM PRESIDENT, I YIELD THE

292
02:01:56,642 --> 02:01:58,243
FLOOR.

293
02:01:58,243 --> 02:01:59,478
I'D NOTE THE ABSENCE OF A

294
02:01:59,478 --> 02:02:00,312
QUORUM.

295
02:02:00,312 --> 02:02:00,879
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE

296
02:02:00,879 --> 02:02:07,620
CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL.

297
02:02:09,788 --> 00:00:00,000
QUORUM CALL:
