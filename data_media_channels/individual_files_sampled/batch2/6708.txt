thank you the members if it wasn't for you we couldn't even do these long shows we couldn't show people the Bernie Sanders speech I know a lot of people have trouble finding it from time to time and we want to cover it and give you the context on it toi tea network.com slice join I'm super proud that we were able to put on a town hall for Bernie just a week ago for Medicare for all that Anna partly hosted and so thank you the members and if you remember you get all the TYT coverage tea white tea network.com slash joint difference between Bernie Sanders and Joe Kennedy is light years so look no no hate on Joe Kennedy's just the standard politician speaking in standard cadence he's a young guy he's trying to learn the ropes yadda yadda but but more important than him sounding fake and Bernie Sanders sounding real is is the substance so he gave the the Kennedy gave the stories of the family and Pittsburgh and the this and that and Bernie jumped right into the numbers and he's like look here's the context yes unemployment is down but the context of that is how much unemployment is falling under Obama and in fact we've added the fewest jobs since 2010 that's super important context and other politicians might think Oh that'll bore the audience no the audience loves that look we want to know that because they're living it right so one of the things that I realized under Obama is yes the economy overall did improve but since wages didn't improve much a lot of Americans were bitter and angry toward him and Democrats right which is what kind of paved the way for unfortunately someone like Trump and what Bernie's doing at least in the beginning of his speech is saying yeah okay sure we'll give them that the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in a long time but let's talk about wages you know that's something that a lot of people care about and I think that it's a miscalculation by other politicians to think that it's going to bore people to get into the numbers so after given the context on why unemployment is out of this trend that was started by Obama and how Trump didn't do anything different to encourage that trend he then talked about the wages that Anna's referring to and saying that the average American worker has gotten a four cent race then he pointed out the dichotomy of the top three billionaires in the country having gotten 68 extra billion dollars in the last year so now look different people have different thoughts on how much you begrudge the top three but the income inequality is what is start and if the photometry got sixty eight billion dollars and the average American worker got a real race great wonderful everybody wins the part I liked I liked every part of it it's impossible not to like right you know and I hope that it resonates helped a lot of people saw it you know don't let any story about sowing discontent you know that their decisiveness so again Republicans have done it every it's not a big it anyway to tell the other speech was over I consider completely irrelevant clearly wait until the other speech was over and I thought it was a nice contrast you know again I had the same issue with Joe Kennedy's holding this but there Bernie Sanders also signaled to me a little bit there of like hey looked you know again I may he may be outside the Democratic Party but what you know he didn't take this opportunity to give a speech about the State of the Union and not mention Russia in fact he pointed out how rageous it was that that that Trump didn't mention it right so and I imagine that there are some Bernie supporters who are you know flabbergasted now that he has bought in to the lie about Russia ya know it look he touched all the important things he talked about completely yeah he said why didn't he talk about climate change something massively important to the world criminal justice versa and citizens united what happened I saw you're gonna drain the swamp and all of a sudden not a word about Citizens United are getting money out of politics of the corruption in Washington College for all all the things that Trump didn't talk about and and we've got it now I want to show you video 13 we literally asked for this before Bernie's speech began and the guy always delivers here let's take a look at video 13 here we need to seriously address the issue of immigration but that does not mean dividing families and reducing legal immigration by 25 to 50 percent it surely does not mean forcing the taxpayers of our country to spend 25 billion dollars on a wall that candidate Trump promised us that Mexico would pay for like it's such an obvious there's such an obvious point to it like why and I don't get I really don't understand what whoever crafts Joe Kennedy and whoever he works on his speech with like why they don't think that will resonate I mean the Republican plan suggested 25 billion dollars that taxpayers were paid for for a wall that he said five hundred times during the campaign not we didn't find it just that one doe he mentioned at one time he said it every time he talked about immigration Mexico is gonna pay for it then he says twenty five billion dollars and they're not gonna pay for it you're gonna pay for it and why that doesn't occur to everyone joke any in the world to repeat it but Bernie was like yeah I mean all he did was read the same article we did right and he's like well I think people won't be mad mad about that you know and you're like well right you know why cuz it's genuine he's mad about it you're not being fair Trump says they will pay for it in some form in the future I think part of it is I think first of all they think that they're supposed to go out there and just be inspiring and so he used lofty language as you said he did the dramatic pauses not not burning talking about Kennedy there and they feel like just inspiration is enough I think but in that particular like fact-checking basically I think a lot of people have just given up on it on fact-checking Trump on anything because they know that you can't get him it doesn't matter if you have video exactly him contradicting himself it doesn't seem to do much I do think that it does it adds up over time which is why even amongst Republicans over the past year his support has gone down I think the people who say it's no point attacking him I think they are dead wrong but I think on individual issues people feel like it's just a waste of time like they're just they're just you know visited in the wind I mentioned already but John what was the one thing that the Bernie Sanders said that he doesn't normally say like that he doesn't normally say yeah like most of what he said is as part of his standard speech I mean done well and it's a bit I'm not dismissing it by saying it's a standard speech you talk about talks with Israel but but he that Russia thing and again he's talked about that many times I got it in this not usually what he's talking about a $15 minimum wage and not talking about criminal justice reform and so I'm just saying he is also saying I'm with those Democrats who were pissed off about that so senator and he's got access to a lot I got it I just say it was a lot about I'm saying that that that in addition to a speech that listing off a novel things that people at this table get excited about just said that's a guy running for president that's that's a there's a guy interested in expanding his base of voters Ron Bernie run okay I want to show you video 12 here because again important context on the bonuses I think that uh other Democrats think that this giving numbers might be boring no it's super relevant and important so let's take a look at this for context Donald Trump touted the bonuses he claims workers received because of his so-called tax reform bill what he forgot to mention is that only 2% of Americans Americans reported receiving a raise or a bonus because of this tax bill two percent what he also failed to mention is that some of the corporations that have given out bonuses such as Walmart AT&T General Electric and Pfizer are also laying off tens of thousands of their employees Kimberly Clark the maker of Kleenex and Huggies recently said they were using money from the tax cut to restructure laying off more than five thousand workers and closing ten plants so we keep comparing Bernie's speech to Joe Kennedy because he gave the official Democratic response and he had some good lines and he's a young politician etc but there was like the fake pauses and the over dramatic delivery etc yeah and Joe Kennedy would have never mentioned Huggies no no I'd like for all my life I'll remember and dibbley o'clock and then he's like I got a telly o'clock is people don't know that branding yeah they make Kleenex and Huggies which is a diaper and what do they do they laid off people what you know what does that resonate you go I know the guy I know Kleenex I know Huggies oh they laid off people well why didn't Trump tell us that those aren't boring numbers those are monumentally important contacts I think he sees sounds like he's burping off of our videos actually we've been doing endless coverage after the tax cuts of that but also while I agree with all the comments about Kennedy's speech I think and we've pointed out a couple of the good lines I think if you could somehow remove Bernie Sanders campaign you know back in 2016 I think that Joe Kennedy's speech would have been different I don't think you would have had the the mutual casualties of the system rigged to benefit those at the very top line I think that you think Bernie Joe Kennedy speech was informed by the success of Bernie's camp I think every speech is it yeah I agree I thought Joe Kennedy speech was good I thought I hear you on the halting this and I don't care we got to get beyond that the content is what mattered and it was good it was it was strong and I think it is a sign that there were things in that speech like I thought well it's a pretty progressive speech that bit that bit Joe without super specifics but in the rhetoric Andy actually not a ton of the policy like he didn't speak specifically about Medicare for all $15 minimum wage all that but he talked about the nature the talk specifically about the way that that Trump divides us as opposed to just generic lines about divisions yes so I mean I liked it and I think I think again I think it's a sign that that that if that the Bernie way of thinking about things is as informed more Democrats than it hasn't liked this briefing it I think it certainly influenced them and I think that the like the discourse has evolved on the left to actually start focusing on income inequality as a real issue that Americans care about but you know look I don't want to be too tough on Kennedy and I hear what you're saying about let's focus on the message and the content and not focus so much on the delivery and the presentation but I just want to quickly make a point about why the presentation matters look I think what appeals to Americans or to people on the left in regard to Bernie and to some except people on the right as well is that when he is delivering a speech it's not just rehearsed thing where he's saying what people want to hear I think for far too long politicians both on the right and the left have given these perfectly polished rehearsed speeches where they say all the right things to attract all the voters and then they don't end up delivering and so that authenticity goes a long way it goes beyond you know oh we're nitpicking and we're being hard on him because he's not a great you know speech giver and he's too new at this no it's it's about spreading a message that you actually care about and you feel passionately I I've been talking about authenticity in politics since I started talking about politics so I totally agree with that and understand and that's why Trump it's a to me the biggest reasons why Trump won is this sense that he was telling it like it is right and then combined with all of what we're repealing to disenfranchise white voters who don't like their dark colored people you know so they're all mixed together and it created just barely enough to win I just think that as always we need to be careful about finding the candidate that we like authentic and the candidate that we don't like in authentic and so that's all like Joe Kennedy's speech was not particularly inauthentic he I thought the pauses were felt like felt like pauses but it was pretty good it was an okay speech and for the standard Democratic response for the circumstances they put him in I thought they did pretty well now it's all meaning us we'll be incumbent on guys like Joe Kennedy how do they go forward how does it what's the next beat she likes Gibbs when he's actually giving a real speech to real people and it's not all Cory and I want to be clear about my own my own biases and and how very aware I am of them because yes I love Bernie I love his messaging and but I'm also very aware of my bias in favor of him and so you know meeting him in DC in in on two different occasions I really focused on who he was when the cameras were off right I wanted to focus on you know what he talks about the way he behaves the way he presents himself he's authentic and you know I don't want to be blinded by my political support for him he is who he is and he doesn't hide who he is at all regardless of whether the cameras are on look we're overthinking it and now I'm going to overstate it but including Bernie saying he's compulsively dishonest he's a liar there's racism involved etc being super frank about it and not you know worrying about oh my god what will people think but overall look you watch Kennedy then you watch Sanders and mine that to me it was night and day here's a politician here's a real person and I looked at Bernie and thought that's the next president of the United States like people are sick of the politicians right or wrong fair or unfair to Joe Kennedy it's a random example he just happen to give the speech tonight he's not any worse than anyone else no and he you know and he'd like you said in the old days I would have been a perfectly fine speech but then Bernie comes on like a real person goes why did the average worker get only four cent raise and I think a lot of people 60% of the country go yeah why did we only get a four cent raise and the top three got sixteen billion dollars
