HEARING ABOUT THE NORTH LIMITING
MISSILE LAUNCHES?
>> THEY HAVE SOME NEW
INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS, JULIE.
MORE GOOD WILL GESTURES
APPARENTLY FROM NORTH KOREA IN
THEIR RUN UP TO THIS SUMMIT NOW
ANNOUNCED FOR JUNE 12TH BETWEEN
KIM JONG UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS
REPORTEDLY TELLING U.N. CIVIL
AVIATION AUTHORITY OFFICIALS
THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER BE
CONDUCTING UNANNOUNCED ICBM OR
MID RANGE MISSILE TESTS BECAUSE,
IN THEIR WORDS, THERE'S NO NEED.
THEY ALREADY HAVE FINISHED THEIR
NUCLEAR ARSENAL.
NOW, THIS IS IMPORTANT, JULIE,
BECAUSE WITH ALL THE TALK OF
DENUCLEARIZATION, WE'VE HEARD
LESS TALK ABOUT LIMITING THE
MEANS OF GETTING THOSE WEAPONS
TO THE TARGETS LIKE THE UNITED
STATES.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MISSILES.
MEANWHILE, THERE ARE MORE
INDICATIONS THAT NORTH KOREA
MIGHT BE MOVING TO CLOSE DOWN
ITS ONE KNOWN NUCLEAR TESTING
SITE.
ACCORDING TO SATELLITE
PHOTOGRAPHY AND SOME EXPERTS,
THERE HAVE BEEN SIX STRUCTURES
REMOVED FROM THAT SITE JUST IN
THE PAST TWO WEEKS.
REMEMBER, NORTH KOREA PROMISING
TO DISMANTLE THAT SITE AND SHOW
IT TO INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS
AND EVEN JOURNALISTS.
BUT OF COURSE, THERE'S ANOTHER
REPORT IN THE PAST DAY, JULIE,
THAT SAYS THAT THIS SITE IS TOO
DAMAGED TO BE USED AGAIN.
ALWAYS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.
>> Julie: OH, YES.
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE FREE
DETAINEES AND PLANS FOR THE
SUMMIT?
>> SUPER NEWS.
SUPER NEWS ABOUT THE FREED
DETAINEES, JULIE.
THEY REMAIN IN WALTER REED
MEDICAL CENTER GETTING THEIR
CHECKUPS.
REPORTS WE'RE GETTING IS THEY
ARE IN GOOD SPIRITS.
THEY'RE COPING WELL.
AND WE'RE LEARNING THEKTD --
THEY COULD BE REUNITED WITH
THEIR FAMILIES TODAY.
WE MAY GET A GLIMPSE OF THAT.
THE NUTS AND BOLTS PLANNING FOR
THIS SUMMIT SET IN SINGAPORE IN
ONE MONTH'S TIME GOES ON.
I WAS ON THE PHONE TALKING TO
FOLKS IN SINGAPORE TRYING TO
NAIL EXACT LOCATION WITHIN THAT
COUNTRY, CITY, STATE, NO
LOCATION YET.
IN HINDSIGHT, IT'S A GOOD CHOICE
ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS.
SECURE, WELL SITUATED, WELL
LINKED.
MANY SUMMITS AND OTHER
CONFERENCES HAVE BEEN HELD
THERE.
FINALLY, ONE OF MY CLOSE SOURCES
WITH THESE TALKS PREPARATORY
TALKS SAY THAT THE SUMMIT MIGHT
LAST LONGER THAN 24 HOURS.
BUT GENERALLY, WE'RE THINKING
IT'S GOING TO BE A ONE DAY
WONDER WITH A BIG, BIG
ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE END.
OF COURSE, POSITIVE WORDS AND
