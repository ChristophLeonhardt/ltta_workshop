four people have been killed in southern France after a gunman hijacked a car and took hostages at a supermarket in a small town the attacker pledged allegiance to Islamic state and was eventually shot dead by Special Forces among those killed was a hero police officer who swapped places with a female hostage he managed to leave a mobile phone on for the authorities outside the supermarket to listen in when police heard gunshots they moved to neutralize the attacker Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud beltram had been fighting for his life but passed away on Saturday morning this is how the tragedy unfolded on Friday the gunmen hijacked a car on the outskirts of the town of Carcassonne during the morning shooting dead one passenger and seriously injuring the driver he later opened fire on a group of policemen who were out jogging wounding one of them in the shoulder the gunman then drove to the nearby town of TREB where he stormed a supermarket and killed two civilians and a police officer and eyewitness described what he saw the movie I went shopping with my wife and sister-in-law after some time we had an explosion well several I saw a man lying on the floor in another person who was very agitated with a handgun in one hand and a knife in the other yelling Allahu Akbar after that I took my wife and my sister-in-law and some customers nearby and we went to look for shelter I put them in a butcher's fridge closed from the inside the kill has been identified as a 26 year old French citizen of moroccan origin he was known to the police for petty offenses and low-level drug crime and was also under surveillance mon like other similarly tragic incidents locals had no idea there was a potential killer in their neighborhood it's peaceful here where a city like any other he was very kind very sociable adorable he offered sweets to the children and he's a terrorist we're shocked but not surprised because we felt that there was a bad as fear in the city for some time there have been a number of terror attacks and water'd attempts in France that since the beginning of 2017 alone in February a man attempted to enter the Louvre museum in Paris with a machete while an attacker was stopped at Orly Airport just one month later a police officer was shot dead in April on the Schanz Alizee and in October two young women were stabbed to death at a railway station in Marseille former UK police officer Peter Kirkham says even potential attackers under surveillance can still slip through the net I know the French and various other countries have tightened up their security services and their intelligence gathering over recent years particularly after the spate of very serious incidents that happened in 2015 and 2016 this sort of attack though it's the sort of thing that will get through the very best of intelligence gathering functions it's a small town in the middle of nowhere it's not in a big city it's not a predictable target it's relatively low-tech yes there's a firearm involved but they're not that difficult to obtain if you put your mind to it I've got criminal connections we have got thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands more people with some question mark against them than we've got resources to look at them and and some unfortunately we'll get through it's as simple as that unfortunately
