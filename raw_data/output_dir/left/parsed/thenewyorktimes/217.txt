Well, the way I look at it
is, I don’t have any vacation.
I mean, you know, people
come here for vacation.
I don’t.
I come here to live my life.
Adopting a cruise ship
life is basically
escaping from reality.
You are basically exiting the
world as you know it on land,
and you’re saying, I don’t want
to be a part of that anymore.
I want to create my
own little world.
And I want to be away
from all the issues that
come up with living on land.
And how you create
that reality is really
a very personal decision.
I don’t have to take
out the garbage.
I don’t have to clean.
I don’t have to do laundry.
I mean, I have eliminated
all those non-value-added activities
and just have all
the time in the world
to enjoy what I like to do.
[MUSIC - “AIN’T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH
ENOUGH”]
(SINGING) No wind, no
rain, no winter’s cold
can stop me, baby, baby,
baby, if you’re my goal —
Good evening, everyone.
 Good evening!
So ladies and gents,
I’m going to introduce to you 
our top cruiser for this cruise —
6,900 nights.
That’s almost 19 years
cruising nonstop.
Please give a big round of
applause to Super Mario —
Mario Salcedo.
Mario, please come up here.
[MUSIC - “BEAT TO CRUISIN’" BY
SMOKEY ROBINSON]
Colin, good to see you.
Congratulations.
Frank, good to see you again.
Rocco, pleasure.
Mario, has so many benefits
he almost owns half
of the Enchantment, huh?
All right, let’s take a picture.
[TELEVISION ON IN THE
BACKGROUND]
What can we expect from Iran
in the wake of all this?
Will that deal backfire?
Senate majority
leader Mitch McConnell
just said the president — he has
quote “excessive expectations."
I mean, it was —
we were putting a
lot of pressure.
I said, Bailey, 80% of
your pinnacle members
are conservative Republicans.
Yeah, they like their Fox News.
You know?
That’s one of the biggest
complaints that I hear.
Yeah, why can’t you
give us Fox News?
You know?
So he finally —
He did?
Yeah, he finally agreed.
Yeah.
You going to the
island today, Mario?
No, I’m going to sacrifice.
You’re not going to
go to the island?
No.
You can tell when Mario’s busy.
He’s busy.
He’s in his office on
his computer, yeah.
He sacrifices.
I don’t go out and seek groups
of people going to CocoCay
or going outside.
I don’t do that
because I don’t like
being part of a group dynamic.
I’m just, right now,
living very happily.
I’m the happiest
guy in the world.
OK, I am the happiest person
in the world, being alone.
You’ve got 60 seconds
to show us what you got.
Here we go.
Take it away.
[BACKGROUND MUSIC - LMFAO, “SEXY
AND I KNOW IT”]
Oh, oh, oh!
So where are you going
from this ship, Mario?
I’m staying here
till October 20th.
Where are you going?
And then I’m going
to the Freedom.
Oh, we’ll be on the Freedom.
We’re going to be
on the Freedom.
We’re probably gonna be
on there once in November
and once in December.
You know the dates?
Well, you know what?
Actually, I can access
my calendar here.
Oh, November 5th,
we’re on the Freedom.
Five?
Yes.
November 5th.
Wow, let me put you down
here on my spreadsheet.
Are you on?
Of course.
All right.
Good.
Of course.
And then, on the 26th
we’re on the Rhapsody.
And we’re back on the Freedom
on the 17th of December.
I’ll be there.
Twice! O.K.
Well, that’s great.
Good… good.
Have you ever fell
in love on the ship?
Oh, many times.
Many times.
Not only that, I’ve gotten
married and divorced
on the same cruise.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
By the time you
get back, there’s
no alimony, no child support.
What’s next?
In other words, a
human being always
has to have some
goal to be achieved.
In my case, I really
have exhausted —
I don’t know what
else is out there.
I don’t know.
I just don’t have any more.
So I guess the only thing
I have to look forward to
are just the new ships.
That’s O.K.
And that’s O.K.
That’s great.
That’s amazing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, congratulations.
Congratulations.
That’s a very interesting life.
It’s a great life.
A great life, absolutely.
Yeah, very nice, yeah.
Well, cheers to you.
Thank you so much —
Thank you.
But I’m happy.
I’m the happiest
guy in the world.
I’m very happy.
When I was in the corporate
world, before I took up
cruising as a lifestyle, I just
worked, worked, and worked,
and loved every minute of it.
I guess if I would have been
keen on starting a family
and having children and all
that, I wouldn’t be here.
I would be on land
like a normal person.
“Going down.”
Wish I had my own
private elevator.
“Deck six.”
Good, my friends are here.
My friends are here.
Take a break, Danny.
Take a break.
Hey!
Hey!
Hi, Carly.
Take a break — my usual visit.
Good to see you, Danilo.
How are you?
Beautiful.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Barbara, where are you going?
Where are you going, Barbara?
Where are you — come over here.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Don’t try to sneak — you trying
to sneak past me, aren’t you?
Yeah, yeah.
Never, Super Mario.
How are you?
I’m doing well.
We had a great breakfast.
Booking another cruise?
No, I’m telling him
that I have bad news.
I don’t have
anything to book.
How come?
I have every week booked
until May of 2019.
Super Mario,
wonderful seeing you.
OK, Barbara, good
to see you again.
See you tomorrow morning?
Absolutely.
Your coffee, your —
Yeah, same thing.
O.K., ciao.
Ciao, ciao.
OK, Danny, I’ll leave you.
See you around.
I’ll leave you alone.
Bye, Carly.
Bye-bye.
See you.
Super Mario, .
At the beginning when I started
living on a cruise ship,
yeah, some points in time
I had maybe some regrets.
Why did I leave
everything behind?
But then, that sort
of just went away.
I have already planned my death.
If I really get
sick, I may decide
to do one final scuba dive and
just go down 400 feet.
Instead of having to live my last years
on land in a land hospital.
To me, that would be pure hell.
But you know, I am
not focused on that.
I think that’s still,
hopefully, a ways away,
so I’m not worried about that.
