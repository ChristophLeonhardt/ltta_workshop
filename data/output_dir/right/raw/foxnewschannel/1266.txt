00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,243
>> Laura: AN UNBELIEVABLE

2
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:13,811
STORY, GOOGLE HAS A LOT OF

3
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:15,013
EXPLAINING TO DO.

4
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:16,681
IF YOU GOOGLE THE CALIFORNIA

5
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:17,248
REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE

6
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:19,484
INFORMATION BLOCK WOULD INFORM

7
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:21,786
YOU ABOUT THE PARTY'S IDEOLOGY.

8
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:23,755
WHAT IT SAID WAS JAW-DROPPING.

9
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:26,024
LET'S EXAMINE IT WITH KEVIN

10
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:26,858
McCARTHY, REPUBLICAN FROM

11
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:28,226
CALIFORNIA.

12
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:30,128
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU MAJORITY

13
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:31,396
LEADER McCARTHY.

14
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:32,997
WHAT IS GOING ON?

15
00:00:32,997 --> 00:00:34,566
GOOGLE SAID THIS WAS A MISTAKE,

16
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:36,901
BUT YOU GOT WIND OF THIS.

17
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,603
WHEN YOU TYPED IN CALIFORNIA

18
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:41,406
REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHAT SHOWED

19
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:42,207
UP?

20
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:44,809
>> IT'S AT OUR IDEOLOGY WAS A

21
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:45,610
NAZISM.

22
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,047
IT WASN'T A PARTY OF LINCOLN, IT

23
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,583
WASN'T THE PARTY OF REAGAN, IT

24
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,017
SAID WE WERE.

25
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:54,619
GOOGLE IS THE LARGEST SEARCH

26
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:57,622
ENGINE IN THE WORLD.

27
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:59,991
90% OF SEARCH ENGINES GO THROUGH

28
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:02,994
GOOGLE.

29
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:06,831
AND I GOT WIND OF THIS, AND, I

30
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:08,833
WENT OVER TO WIKIPEDIA FOR

31
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,668
CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS AND IT

32
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:12,837
DID NOT SAY IS.

33
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:14,405
IT IT CONCERNS ME GREATLY

34
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:16,007
BECAUSE THE BIAS THAT IS

35
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,742
HAPPENING HERE, IF YOU SEARCHED

36
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,010
ON INSTAGRAM FOR

37
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,811
DONALD TRUMP JR. THIS WEEKEND,

38
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:22,013
YOU KNOW WHAT IT TOLD YOU?

39
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:23,615
THEY WARNED YOU THAT THE SITE

40
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,651
COULD CAUSE YOU HARM OR EVEN

41
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:27,785
DEATH.

42
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:29,520
THEN THEY CAN THE ARMY KICKED

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,989
OFF THE ALLIANCE FOR FREEDOM TO

44
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,324
GIVE THEIR CHARITY PROGRAM,

45
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:34,225
AMAZON SMILE.

46
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:35,460
IF YOU WERE PERCHING DUMB LIKE

47
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,294
PURCHASING SOMETHING THERE YOU

48
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:38,196
COULD SEND A CHARITY MONEY TO A

49
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:38,630
NONPROFIT.

50
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,632
THEY REMOVE THEM BECAUSE A

51
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:41,833
SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW DECIDED

52
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:42,834
THEY WERE GOOD.

53
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:45,570
EVEN PEOPLE WHO DEFEND RELIGIOUS

54
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,070
FREEDOM BEFORE THE

55
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,504
SUPREME COURT.

56
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:50,008
>> Laura: THAT CENTER HAS

57
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:51,009
TURNED INTO A LEFT WING RABID

58
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,411
RADICAL GROUP THAT TRIES TO

59
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:55,346
MALIGN PEOPLE, MYSELF INCLUDED,

60
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:57,382
BECAUSE WE STAND UP AGAINST

61
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:58,283
CHRISTIANS BEING PERSECUTED IN

62
00:01:58,283 --> 00:02:00,818
THE MIDDLE EAST AND I WE ARE

63
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:01,819
ANTI-ISLAM.

64
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,021
OKAY, IT'S RIDICULOUS.

65
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,023
SO WHAT CAN BE DONE?

66
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:06,891
GOOGLE SAID THEY BLAME

67
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,559
WIKIPEDIA, AND THEY USUALLY

68
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,595
CATCH VANDALISM BEFORE IT

69
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:11,562
IMPACTS SEARCH RESULTS.

70
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:14,032
BUT OCCASIONALLY ERRORS GET

71
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:15,967
THROUGH AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

72
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:16,267
HERE.

73
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:18,569
>> THEY GAVE THAT I EXPLANATION

74
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,738
AFTER WE WENT FORWARD IN PUBLIC

75
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:21,806
WITH IT.

76
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:22,607
BUT I HAD ALREADY SEARCHED

77
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:25,209
WIKIPEDIA AND IT WASN'T ON THE

78
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:25,843
WIKIPEDIA PAGE.

79
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,845
THIS IS WHY WE NEED

80
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:28,279
TRANSPARENCY.

81
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,014
THIS BIAS AGAINST CONSERVATIVES

82
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,449
HAS TO STOP.

83
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,084
AND THEY ALWAYS EXPLAIN IT AWAY

84
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:35,186
WITH SOMETHING SMALL.

85
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,922
NO, I WANT TO KNOW, DID AN

86
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,691
EMPLOYEE IN THEIR GO FORWARD AND

87
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:43,027
PUT THE IDEA THAT THE PARTY OF

88
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,163
LINCOLN THAT BROUGHT US

89
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:47,965
RONALD REAGAN, THE DECIDED WE

90
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:48,266
WERE?

91
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:48,833
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

92
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,835
>> Laura: IT'S A LIBERAL

93
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:51,602
CULTURE THERE IN SILICON VALLEY

94
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:54,005
AND CERTAINLY AT GOOGLE.

95
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:55,773
LET'S MOVE ONTO OTHER TOPICS.

96
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:56,874
LOTS OF CONVERSATION ON

97
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:58,009
CAPITOL HILL ABOUT WHO WILL BE

98
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:58,609
THE NEXT SPEAKER.

99
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,244
HER NAME IS ALWAYS AT THE TOP OF

100
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:03,448
THE LIST, BUT YOUR FRIENDS OVER

101
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:05,416
THERE AT THE "LOS ANGELES TIMES"

102
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,084
SAID, WHY CALIFORNIA KEVIN

103
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,919
McCARTHY IS HAVING A HARD TIME

104
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,455
WALKING DOWN THE SPEAKER'S JOB

105
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:10,755
AGAIN.

106
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,090
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

107
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,459
MY CAREER AS A CONGRESSMAN FROM

WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE'S NAMES

111
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:22,433
MENTIONED BUT, WHAT'S GOING ON?

112
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,636
>> WELL ONE, THERE IS NO

113
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:26,104
SPEAKER'S RACE.

114
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:26,771

THE ELECTION WE WILL HAVE ONE.

117
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,812
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

118
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:38,182
HAVE A REPUBLICAN TO BE A

119
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:38,516
SPEAKER.

120
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,885
I'M VERY CONFIDENT GOING FORWARD

121
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:43,054
MY WHOLE GOAL RIGHT NOW IS

122
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:45,223
MAKING SURE WE WIN THE MAJORITY.

123
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:46,824
THAT'S WHY I'M TRAVELING THE

124
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:47,625

WE HAVE REFORMED THE VA.

THE RIGHT TO TRY.

132
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,912
THE SICK INDIVIDUALS HAVING A

DEFENSE, THAT WAS JUST THAT

136
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,584
WEEK.

00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,188
AN AMNESTY?

140
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:17,988
FICO KNOWN.

141
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,625
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR

00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,826
BORDERS BECAUSE WE KNOW AND YOU

143
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:22,827
KNOW SO WELL THE IDEA OF THE

144
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:24,829
CURRENT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS

145
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:25,430
BROKEN.

146
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,032
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME UP

147
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:28,733
ONE, BUILD A WALL.

148
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,835
WE HAVE TO END CATCH AND

149
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:31,169
RELEASE.

150
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,470
WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS

151
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,907
BASED ON MERIT IF WE REALLY WANT

152
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,708
THIS COUNTRY TO GROW.

153
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,044
>> Laura: DOES JOHN COX HAVE A

154
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:41,446
CHANCE IN CALIFORNIA?

155
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,215
DOES THE G.O.P. HAVE A REASON TO

156
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:46,784
HOPE IN CALIFORNIA?

157
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:47,819
>> YES.

158
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,854
REMEMBER THIS IS THE STATE THAT

159
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,823
BROUGHT US RONALD REAGAN.

160
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:53,624
WE HAVE THIS CRAZY SYSTEM WHICH

161
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:55,226
I DO NOT LIKE.

162
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:56,327
THIS IDEA IS CRAZY.

163
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:57,628
JOHN COX WILL COME THROUGH BUT

164
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:59,530
THERE IS ANOTHER REASON FOR

165
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,498
CALIFORNIA TO BE HOPEFUL.

166
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,667
THE DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY TOOK THE

167
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,268
MAJORITY, THEY RAISE THE

168
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:06,070
GASOLINE TAX $0.12.

169
00:05:06,070 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY HAVE INITIATIVE ON THE
