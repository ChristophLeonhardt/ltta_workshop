the definition of democratic socialism to me again is is the fact that in a modern moral and wealthy society no American should be too poor to live and to me that means every working-class American in this country should have access to dignified health care should actually be able to see a doctor without going broke it means you should be able to send your kids to college and trade school if they show if they so choose and no person should feel precarious and they're in or in stable in their access to housing is our economy develop something it may wind up being the biggest political upset of the year Alexandria Ocasio Cortes stunning defeat of longtime New York Congressman Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary a twenty eight-year-old Democratic Socialist beating a man who some saw as the next Speaker of the House if Democrats retake control her victory is sparking the perennial political media debate about the future of the Democratic Party the Republicans say it proves Democrats are moving too far to the left the energy and the Democratic Party is self-avowed socialist open borders I think the Democrats are going hard love the party has been drifting left word for quite a while they now just have candidates prevailing in primaries he spent three million bucks had much more in the bank and he just flat-out loss meanwhile it's yeah joining me now is the Democratic nominee for New York's 14th congressional district Alexandria Ocasio Cortes first of all congratulations thank you thank you so very much so I think there's a bit of a phony debate about democratic socialism right but do you feel that that debate is fuzzy yeah I absolutely do believe that it's a phony debate because at the end of the day this campaign and and what this movement about movement is about is about the core issues impacting working-class Americans across this country and it resonates and we know that it does so one of my favorite facts about the 14th district is that it's it's literally where they shot the open to all of the family it's Archie Bunker's district had he been a real person in the 90s the districts white population even was dropping it was down to 58% by 2012 2002 redistricting was 28% in 2012 it merged with the seventh so there's 35 percent of that district is now in the Bronks it's 46 percent hispanic 11 percent black 16 percent asian 25 percent white and more like more affluent white voters so among that very it's a much less white much more minority district what do you think resonated among those voters why did they pick you over Crowley well I think it was a lot of things one I think we were speaking to a lot of issues at least here locally in New York that aren't being discussed I think with the candor that they need to be families can't afford to stay in New York gentrification gentrification but also its its gentrification and cost of living because people can't afford their rent and nobody is talking about it so when we talk about how the corrupting role of New York City money and politics in particular when we speak to these truths when we talk about health care when we talk about housing that resonates with voters and we won across demographics - we won with 57% of the vote we won with white voters black voters Latino voters South Asian vote like we voted across and won the vote across electorates and I think that it's important to kind of communicate that we've been talking a lot about the immigration issues at the border you ran on an abolish ice campaign what would you see it's only a 15 year old agency but if about if I spent away what would replace it well I think a lot of what we need to talk about is what values our immigration system has been legislated on the original roots of the u.s. immigration system the first immigration law is the Chinese Exclusion Act and our immigration system is built on a premise of exclusion it's built on a premise of choosing who we want out instead of who we want in yeah and I think that really we need to re-examine the values on which and values of inclusion and values of what this country is about when we talk about immigration problems I want to show you this is actually in a video from Chicago there's an anti-violence March taking place right now it's live right now it's shutting down the Dan Ryan Expressway Father fleiger who many of you may remember that name he was one of the mentors to President Barack Obama he's leading this huge rally against gun violence what are what is your position on gun reform well I think we need to I think that we need to be unafraid to take a very strong clear stance on gun reform I personally am supportive of reinstating the ban on assault weapons I think that you know many many many members of our military need to go through years of training in order to have access to these weapons and the idea that a 17 year old can walk into a shop and and get one I think is completely unacceptable yeah what are the most important things that you'd want to do if you get Lola I mean it's like you're gonna win the seat I mean it's a it's a very dim I gotta work for it as a matter of fact and you know to not to being cute about it you're already using the star power that you've gained to help other candidate yeah which means you've got to be pretty confident you're gonna win the race well I think what it is is that we need to show that this is a movement you know even before the win of this race I communicated to voters that this and my candidacy and my campaign was a movement campaign a movement candidacy and I believe that the strength of my individual Kansas he has to do with the fact that I am one of many yeah there's 60 congressional candidates nationwide that are refusing corporate and lobbyist money in the Democratic Party and I think that it's important you know I don't think that it's a this this zero-sum understanding of political capital is correct in this day and age by supporting on to other candidates I myself get stronger and vice-versa what do you want to do most importantly in Congress you know I think that we again we need to address these bread-and-butter issues I think that ideally you know I hope that my role within the party is to hopefully be kind of a voice of clarity on on housing on health care on education and climate change and I hope that I can really you know push some of those issues forward should New York reform it's a voting system in terms of maybe may have one primary certitude of course New York is one of the most was one of the worst offenders and voter suppression we don't think about it because we vote we vote blue in presidential elections we're one of the only we're one of the only states that doesn't have mail and voting early voting we have to register for your party a year before the primary in some circumstances and if we're going to have if we're gonna talk to talk we need to walk the walk and we need to read and franchise every New Yorker in this country and in in this state yeah absolutely Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez the very likely next Congress person from the 14th district the very democratic district I think that's why people can feel confident saying it a new political star the Democratic Party congratulations thank you so very right thank you very much more aim do I have to break young people hey thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there for more am joy and the rest of MSNBC and click on any of the videos right here to watch the latest interviews and highlights and you can get more videos from MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
