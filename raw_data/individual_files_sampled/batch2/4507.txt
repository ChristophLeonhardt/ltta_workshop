thing one tonight there's a building in Chicago Illinois you might have heard of it's called Trump Tower it's a Trump building it is in Chicago and that building is being sued by the Illinois Attorney General because is allegedly killing a huge number of fish by sucking river water into its cooling system without regard to all the fish getting sucked in along with it now lots of buildings along the Chicago River use the water in this way but they are required to take precautions to not suck in all the fish in the river Trump Tower has you'll be shocked to hear allegedly been ignoring those precautions no one can say for many just sure how many fish Trump Tower has killed here's what we do know Trump doesn't care about fish Trump cares about Birds when there's thousands of birds laying at the base of the windmill what do we do that amazing the environmentalists we like windmills oh really what about the thousands of birds they're killing try going to the bottom of the windmill someday it's not a pretty picture and that's the do in 60 seconds Donald Trump hates windmills not because someone erected some near one of his golf courses and he thought it room the view no it's because windmills create a quote killing field of birds it's one of trumps favorite not true things to rant about in the whole world and although wind turbines do in fact kill birds they don't kill nearly as many birds as say cats or cars or windows in tall buildings like the one Donald Trump owns his business buildings also kill fish lots and lots of fish but birds well last year near times tally found that Trump has mentioned wind turbines and the imaginary bird pocalypse they create more than 55 times since 2012 there's a lot of hoopla about windmills they're horrible looking structures they make noise they kill birds by the thousands by the way many countries have decided they don't want wind because it doesn't work without massive subsidies it kills massive amounts of birds and wildlife the wind is very tough because those windmills are very very expensive and they kill the birds and they look very terrible isn't it amazing the way the environments love the windmills and yet they kill all the birds in California if you kill a bald eagle they put you in jail for five years and yet the windmills knock them out like like flies it's crazy I don't want to just hope the wind blows to light up your homes and your factory as the birds fall to the ground being that's the end of that one though if the birds don't kill it first the birds could kill it first they kill so many birds you look underneath some of those windmills it's like a killing field the birds try going to the bottom of the wind bill some day it's not a pretty picture hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
