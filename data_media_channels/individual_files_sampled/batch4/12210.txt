one of the biggest problems dogging the incoming trump administration would be Donald Trump's vast business holdings conflicting with his performance as president in the week after the election the Washington Post reported that Trump DC hotel officials had done outreach to local foreign embassies Trump met with Indian businessmen who work with his brand Ivanka Trump took part in a state meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister an Argentinian reporter said the Trump and his daughter had requested a business favor on a phone call with the Argentinian president by the way the favor was later Branson Trump himself told the New York Times that he'd be capable of running his president along his business alongside his presidency all of that was kind of disquieting but Trump actually understands the problem now he tweeted this morning quote I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15th to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to all caps make America great again while i am not mandated to do this under the law but feel that is visually important as president to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses hence legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations the presidency is a far more important task so here's the deal this isn't enough we still need to know exactly how these legal documents will shape up is Trump giving up his ownership stake there's no indicator he is well his children continue to run the business and yet continue to also advise him in his role as president that would actually maintain the conflict will trump liquidate his businesses really really unlikely in a joint statement Richard painter who's George w's ethics lawyer and Norma Nelson who's Obama's ethics lawyer they said Trump's continued business interest would quote sometimes conflict with the public interest and constantly raise questions but but at least Trump recognizes the problem that's at least half the battle we can actually hope that he'll be cautious enough to silo his businesses and political interests preventing the taint of his scandal from destroying his White House before it launches good for Trump now let's pray that he carries out his pledge I'm Ben Shapiro this is the ben shapiro show alrighty so here we are lots to get to today were going to be having on adam carolla in just a few moments to discuss his new movie has a new documentary i'll call the

second first we'll jump right into the news so the big news of the day yesterday was that mittens Mitt Romney met with Donald Trump and I do love how this went down so basically they met and here's a picture of that well first of all I just need to set the stage here's what Mitt Romney said about Donald Trump during the campaign if you recall if we make improvident choices the bright horizon I've described will not materialize and let me put it very plainly if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee the prospect for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished if Donald Trump's plans were ever implemented the country would sink into prolonged recession a few examples his proposed 35-percent tariff like penalties would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers kill our export jobs and lead auto phony to right he says that Trump is a phony is a con man he's a liar basically this is a pretty brutal speech if your call is in march during the primaries and and so you know bottom line is that romney was not very friendly to trump and now they get together for dinner and here's the picture of them at dinner is stunningly good oh it's just wonderful i love it so much okay i will say that this presidency thus far has been wildly entertaining the picture of Trump with Obama was great enough this picture just the way that it's lit in the expressions on their face so spectacular for folks who aren't gonna be listening to this laker like it romney's face romney's like oh my god what happened to me right this is a typical this is like the photo freeze frame how did I get here well let me explain from the beginning and then he whined at six months it's incredible so there's his face go back to the first picture for a second the first picture of Trump sitting there and he's lit from the bottom like you're in a campfire and they're doing like oh you're gonna tell a horror story and he's lit from below and his face is right it's like it looks like Mitt Romney just signed away his soul in a really bad business deal to Donald Trump and from sitting there grinning like Satan like the Cheshire Cat is just spectacular in every way I love it so much just that the fact that Romney keeps going there and going there just to like get slapped around and people are getting very funny about this like for example look at look at this is the Trump Romney dinner and the first thing that popped into my head is of course from the little mermaid yeah that's that's that was the first thing that popped into my head when I saw that picture because that's exactly what it looks like the other one that popped into my head of course was it was from and silence of the lambs so just horrifying just round me being fed his own brain by Donald Trump the best one though is this it was this tweet that somebody had they put it in black and white this picture and in black and white is even better since I made the Trump Romney photo black and white and it looks like a Twilight Zone episode where a guy just made a foolish a deal with the devil and of course is exactly rice so spectacular oh my god so good the woman's making the rounds a lot is this what hahaha it's great somebody Photoshop Trump and Romney into the dinner scene from from Empire Strikes Back where Han Solo walks into the room and realizes the land o is sold about and Darth Vader is sitting at the other end of the long table and it is it is pretty amazing it is pretty amazing it is also worth noting by the way that remember when Donald Trump brand is a blue-collar working class hero remember that and now he's worth like he's dead what ten billion dollars Mitt Romney's 100 millionaire and here's what their menu was the other night this is the menu it's a three-star michelin rated restaurant and called them what's this stupid is called jean-georges jean-georges a is what is called jean-georges as i like to call and here was the actual menu quote the appetizer was young garlic soup with time and sauteed frog legs next they had diver scallops with caramelized cauliflower and a caper raisin emulsion for their main course both Priebus and the president-elect had prime sirloin with citrus glaze and carrots romney had lamb chops with the mushroom polonaise sauce all three a chocolate cake for dessert sounds like many people to make and no corrupt bargains happening among the people who are eating frog legs although I have to say poor Pepe poor Pepe I mean they they they ran this entire campaign and Pepe was with Trump the entire way and then Trump just ate him and somewhere the alt right cries and tears of sorrow rolled down Pepe's cheeks it is all very very tragic then Mitt Romney came out afterward and he made this statement after the dinner and he just looks I mean Trump and his people had asked for basically an apology from Mitt Romney and Romney clearly wants the gig and so now he's apologizing pretty amazing engages enjoying the very much I was also very impressed by the remarks he made on his victory knife by the way it's not easy when I know that myself he did something I try to do and was unsuccessfully he'd want the generalist and and he continues with a message of inclusion bringing people together and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way wings joke right it's a joke I mean Romney's is looking for an excuse to jump back on the Trump train here and he's finding it in you know his his speech and his cabinet Romney still thinks went from exactly what Romney always thought of Trump there are two ways to read Romney's behavior here one is Romney really really really really wants back into power that's the cynical way to read this the other way to read this is that Romney believes and things that Trump could use some stayed steady sober judgment around him and so he's willing to undergo the humiliation of dealing with Trump and maybe being thrown under the bus by Trump in order to do it and again Trump hasn't selected him yet for Secretary of State so this could all go wildly wrong right there only two possible ways this plays out as far as as far as Romney is concerned in terms of public image these are both from Game of Thrones the way number one this turns out for Romney just in terms of how this plays out politically is is this is this right here what is to be done with this traitor your grace so long as I am your king treason shall never go unpunished like that that's that's that's possible that he goes out he makes his obese institute rump and then Trump a heads him and picks rudy giuliani which would be hilarious i will say it would be really really funny the other way that this could go is is that Trump actually gives him what he wants but that involves him being a little bit humiliated go on me nice clothes hey I could go reek ready could be read in reality the truth is a lot of the stuff is overplayed Trump likes to play reality TV it is reality TV it's very entertaining I will admit that and I have all of my Bachelorette outtakes for when he actually makes this call because the Bachelorette outtakes will fit Giuliani or Romney one of the two will be sobbing in a car about how they were so deeply in love and then they were left at the altar but in reality is that is Trump playing this right Trump is playing this about as well as he could have played this really i mean he's making Romney look foolish he's making Romney look like he has to bend the knee to him and then if he actually picks Romney it's a brilliant move politically because it looks like he's getting over his own pettiness about Romney in order to stock his cabinet with people who are good and if he doesn't pick Romney well then he's done what a lot of people expected him to do on his own side you know in his own base and he stomped Romney in the face and and he's going to get a lot of credit for that from his own base so he's in a no-lose situation I'm Romney played along i assume out of patriotism and a sense of duty but it could have also been out of ego both are possible but it is fascinating to watch this sort of stuff typically is not done in front of the cameras and yet Trump is doing it all in front of the cameras which is going to make for a very very entertaining very entertaining for years you mean while Trump is being given a lot of credit for this for carrier keeping a bunch of jobs a carrier is an air conditioner manufacturer and they just they just announced they're going to keep a thousand jobs in Indiana and I want to talk about this in a pretty serious way because I think that a lot of people are ignoring the real story here and that's a problem so a lot of people are immediately celebrating the fact that Trump kept jobs in America that's great okay that's that's that's wonderful except for that's not the actual story lots of people can use the government to keep jobs in a particular place Barack Obama used the power of government the threat of the pitchforks and torches to leverage the banks to do things that he wanted Barack Obama was able to make the auto companies come on bended knee to him in order so that he could get them to do what he wanted by threatening them the bottom line here is not the thousand job saved the bottom line is what we still don't know which is what did Trump do to get carrier to keep its jobs there so a lot of people are saying we shouldn't even ask the question we should just sort of accept what it is we should just sort of take it how it is no big problem no big issue you know at least he kept the jobs here that in and of itself is wonderful and that would be okay except for the fact that how you use the government is really the issue for me not necessarily the outcome you can always keep a company here listen if I were in charge of the federal government pick a company in America I could keep it here just by paying them a lot of money I could bribe a company to stay here or alternatively I could threaten that company in order to make them stay here right the power of the presidency is vast the power of the federal government is vast the question is what did Trump do in order to ensure the carrier would stay so here's what we know we don't know anything really because Trump has not announced what the deal was Mike Pence's the governor of Indiana he's the one really offering the incentives because he's still governor of Indiana carrier is located in Indiana so we still have to figure out exactly what Pence offered and this does make a difference here's what we know or at least the little that we do know according to the New York Times united technologies which is the owner of carrier is among the country's biggest military contractors producing engines for the Pentagon's most advanced fighter jets receiving more than 5 billion dollars annually from the federal government that equals ten percent of the company's revenue so there's the idea that perhaps Trump said we'll have the Defense Department cut our contracts to you if you move those jobs okay that's bad that's bad that's the cut that's the government leveraging businesses into making bad business decisions through threat right not getting the best deal for the American people because presumably the reason that they're contracting with United Technologies is because united technologies provides the best service at the best price here's what we know courtesy of CNBC quote while terms of the deal are not yet clear the sources indicated there were new incentives on offer from the state of Indiana where Pence's governor that helped clear path for the agreement well while United technology was seeking the savings that would come from moving some production to Mexico people familiar with the situation indicated the savings were not worth incurring the wrath of the incoming administration including the potential threat to the significant business united technologies currently conducts with the US government largely in the form of orders for jet engines and other defense related equipment so it's the federal government leveraging people now I don't like the federal government leveraging people whether the person at the head of the federal government is a Republican or a Democrat that is not the job of the federal government the job of the federal government is to preserve your rights and if it has contracts that it needs to do then it should contract the best available operator not the operator that makes bad financial decisions in order to please the federal government right that's a backdoor form of bribery from united technologies and by the way this also sets up a pretty bad precedent a company says we're gonna move 2,000 jobs to Mexico and then they wait for Trump to come in with a noodle of cash and just dump it on them okay this is not that this is not particularly a rip on trumpets it's a rip on the policies that are bad I don't have a look Trump made a promise and Trump is trying to keep that promise but the way you keep the promise matters to me the principal doesn't change just because the name of the guy in power changes and I understand everybody's going to celebrate the thousand jobs but these kinds of headlines routinely routinely come out from administration's ranging from Barack Obama's to Hugo Chavez is the question isn't whether carrier keeps the thousand jobs in Indiana the question is why they kept a thousand jobs in Indiana if carrier kept the thousand jobs in Indiana if they kept the thousand jobs in Indiana because Donald Trump was pursuing positive economic policies that benefit everyone and they say in expectation of lower taxes and an expectation of loosened regulations we've decided that we're going to keep the jobs here wonderful all credit to trump if they say we're keeping the thousand jobs here because Donald Trump bribed us or because Donald from threatened us that's not something that I'm cool with and as conservative you shouldn't be cool with that either because that's just using government to pick winners and losers and as I am fond of saying I'm old enough to remember when we thought that was bad when Obama did with green jobs and stimulus packages and auto bailouts and bank threats again Barack Obama actually used the threat of pitchforks and torches he actually said he brought bankers to the White House in the early part of his administration he said my administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks and then he leveraged them into doing what he wanted he did the same thing to the health insurance companies he said to them listen I'm going to offer a public option if you don't cave to me and give me what I want that was bad it wouldn't be any better if Trump did it hey who go Chavez used to do this Hugo Chavez actually had a show the Venezuelan socialist dictator he actually had to show in Venezuela when it was called hello president that was the name of the show it was a full day show he literally go on camera at like eight in the morning on Sundays all the way to like six in the evenings and the producer of the show would explain this way said the president decides everything it's his show it was called hello president because people would call in but it became like lottery everyone looking to get a job a house or something Chavez would literally give jobs to people on the air people would call in so I don't have a job Chavez would say I'll give you a job look at my magnificence the only way he could give a job of course was to take a job away from somebody else or to take money away from somebody else now this is this is the definition of the swamp okay when people talk about the swamp needs to be drained and crony capitalism this is the definition of it and it doesn't become good just because our guys are doing it so before we get too excited about the carrier decides to keep a thousand jobs in the United States headline let's find out how it was done if the headline said cylindrical you now Obama promises we'd all be saying wait a second that's bribery you can't do that again consistency in principle I know people get upset with consistency in principle I know people get very upset with the idea that we're going to hold everybody to the same standard or they were going to mandate the Donald Trump actually act in accordance with conservatism but the fact is that if we don't hold him accountable for his sins then who are we going to hold them accountable to like who's going to be accountable the way the whole president's accountable is making them accountable for their behavior so I hope that Trump reveals his plan and his plan is get rid of regulations get rid of taxation lower the corporate tax rate that's why carrier kept the jobs if that happens I will celebrate louder and longer than anyone because that will be excellent Trump not good Trump excellent Trump but if this was just another crony capitalist payoff to carrier so that he could have his headline in his moment in the Sun where he said that he kept carrier there with its thousand jobs as a bunch of crap and it's crap whether a Democrat doesn't and it's crap whether there's a Republican that does it okay this these things do not change just because the name at the top of the ticket changes the name of the White House changes the minute you sacrifice principle for political convenience the principal no longer matters it no longer matters so before you celebrate headlines let's look for the actual content of the story right for example i'm willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt right now on is he going to separate from his business he's gonna have to fill that out with content if the content is my kids will run the business and they'll also advise me in the White House the conflict still exists if he separates off and his kids run the business and they have nothing to do at the White House good for him I'll be cheering because I want his presidency to be a success I want him to govern like Ronald Reagan I would love to see it I would love to be wrong about him I would but we have to call out bad things when we see them and we can't just hey that they're good if they're not right we actually have to see evidence of good we just have to see evidence and good that's all and this whole idea you know Steve benen is said this we're gonna create a fifty-year dominance based on big government spending and Obama stimulus packages it was bad when Obama did it it's bad when Trump doesn't beat a dead horse here okay now as far as the the sort of drain the swamp language as far as the drain the swamp language remember everybody's chanting drain the swamp drain the swamp let's go through some of the pics that Trump has made we're still waiting on Secretary of State the people who are currently up for it I guess Bolton has fallen out of contention or the latest reports which is too bad he was my number one choice I think Bolton knows the State Department knows that place has to be absolutely gutted and knows how foreign policy works but he's fallen out for some reason probably because he and Trump don't agree on foreign policy that's actually one more bizarre aspects of the Romney thing is that no one has actually said that Romney shouldn't be Secretary of State because he and Trump disagree on foreign policy and they do right Romney was super anti Russian Trump was very very Pro Russian during the campaign they really disagree on this stuff the only real criticism has been that Romney rip Trump during the primaries but in any case the I guess it sounded like corker and Romney and Giuliani those are the one end Petraeus are the ones that they're discussing all big names of the people who are left Romney and Petraeus would probably be at the top metal is probably Romney at the top of the list then Petraeus then Giuliani and then core core core core would be the worst of all of them if he's picked I'll explain why but some of the other pics that Trump has made these are pretty typical establishment Republican pics he actually just picked a bunch of Democrats he actually just picked a bunch of Democrats to staff out his administration it isn't quite draining the swamp and we'll explain all of those things if you go to daily wire calm right now and subscribe there's plenty more to come here on the show got to talk about the persecution of Christians that
