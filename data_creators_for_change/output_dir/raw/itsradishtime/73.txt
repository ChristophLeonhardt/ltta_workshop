hi friends so my parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't want me</font>

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a stereotype the one where black</font>

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,740
people don't swim my mom didn't learn

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,750
herself until high school<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,759
that her embarrassment of having to

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,620
learn to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob her head underwater in the</font>

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,089

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,460

<font color="#E5E5E5">that I could to avoid learning how to</font>

13

<font color="#CCCCCC">swim I would pitch every kind of fit</font>

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,119
about going to swimming lessons so much

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,619
so that my parents had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bribe me with</font>

16
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,180
beanie babies if I could get through a

<font color="#E5E5E5">class without crying I was so timid</font>

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,750
about having to breathe or that I

19
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,579
couldn't open my eyes underwater or

20
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,290

about how to feel more confident my job

which was not to get so anxious about

56
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:09,080
the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know how to do</font>
