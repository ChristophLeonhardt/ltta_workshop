CAMPUS REFORM SENT A CAMERA CURE TO MY ALMA MATER, NYU, TO ASK THEM IF THEY WERE PROUD TO TODAY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN? OH, BOY. I'M NOT PROUD. AND ALL. ARE YOU PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN? DEFINITELY NOT. NO, I'M NOT PART OF AMERICA. I THINK WE NEED TO STOP THINKING WE ARE THE BEST NATION ON EARTH BECAUSE IT'S JUST A THIS IS SYMPTOMATIC, THOUGH, OF A CULTURE AT NYU. IT'S TAUGHT GENERATION, OUR HISTORY IS BAD, THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MADE THIS COUNTRY ARE EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAT EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAN EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAE EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THA EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAO EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAB EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THA EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAO EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAS EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAD EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAR EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAD EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THA EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAN EVIL, THERE IS DARK SHADOWS THAD IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. THIS IS CULTURAL FOLLOWED. WHEN YOU TAKE STATUES DOWN, WITH HISTORICAL FIGURES AWAY, WITHOUT PUTTING THEM IN A PROPER CONTEXT, THIS IS WHAT YOU GET. Laura: THIS IS WHAT YOU GET ON GENERATIONS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLING, WHERE WE DON'T LEARN CONSTITUTION, DECLARATION, IT IS LIKE EVERY OTHER COUNTRY, EXCEPT IT'S WORSE. HOW DO WE TURN IT BACK TO JULY 4TH?

HE WANTS CLEAN AIR, HE WANTS CLEAN WATER. THIS IS A SIXTH-GRADE WAS READING UP A SCRIPT IN HER N Laura: WASN'T SHE ON THAT MSNBC SHOW, RAYMOND? WE'LL PLAY IT WHILE WE TALK. SHE APPEARED AND SHE HAD A SAYS, "YOUR FOUNDING FATHERS OWNED SLAVES." NOW THIS EMBODIES, I THINK OF THE SELF HATRED OF AMERICA. MY ANCESTORS WERE IN SPAIN AND ITALY, WHEN THE FOUNDING OF THIS REPUBLIC HAPPENED. IN A TIME WHEN WE ARE TOLD NOT TO JUDGE ANYBODY, WE SHOULDN'T JUDGE PEOPLE, I THINK JUDGING THE FOUNDING FATHERS BY THEIR SINS, AND SLAVERY WAS A DARK SOON ON THE STAIN ON MY COUNTRY, TO JUDGE THEM EXCLUSIVELY Laura: JUST ON THAT. THEY NEVER DID ANYTHING THAT CAN AND MOUNT VERNON. WE SHOULDN'T. YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE AND TAKE THEM FOR GOOD AND BAD AND YOU LEARN FROM THEIR ERRORS, AND YOU TAKE THE GO TO TRY TO PERPETUATE THAT. THAT IS WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT HOLDING THE BABY AND THE NOTE CARD. YOU NEED TO SHIELD. THOUGHTS SHE HAD, THAT HER BABY WANTS CLEAN WATER. YOU NEED TO RETIRE AS EPA FIRST OF ALL, GET OUT OF TOWN.
