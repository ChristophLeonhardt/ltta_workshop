in line as their entire worldview comes

215

apart at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene and you know it's not</font>

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not just the headlines of</font>

course it's our officials<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Kerry</font>

218
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,680
goes on the Jake Tapper show and he

219
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,090
explains that the reason we're seeing so

220
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,550
many attacks from Isis is because Isis

221
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,460
is folding basically they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the run</font>

222
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I believe what we're seeing are the</font>

223
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,039
desperate actions of an entity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sees</font>

224
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,729
the noose closing around it well with

225
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">all due respect sir I'm not sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

226
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,180
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to the public that Isis</font>

227
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,000
is on the run in<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the last few weeks</font>

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,150
we handle obviously a series of Isis

229
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,299
inspired attacks 49 killed in Orlando 45

230
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,250
killed in

231
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,990
symbol at the airport more than 200

232
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,679
killed in Baghdad 84 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nice this is</font>

233
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,510
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last five weeks I don't think</font>

234
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,370
Isis is on the run it's big well Jake it

235
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,920
depends on where you mean nicest I don't

236
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,930
know if this guy was actually Isis and

237
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,910
nor do you and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that the</font>

238
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,250
guy in Orlando was fundamentally Isis

239
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,010
nor even told what to do by Isis if

240
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,610
people are inspired they're inspired but

241
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,490
ISIL which is which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is based in Iraq and</font>

242
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,090
Syria is under huge pressure and that is

243
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a fact now there are thousands of</font>

244
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">fighters some of whom left the area of</font>

245
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,820
the fighting years ago and they are

246
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,800
sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some community somewhere in</font>

247
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,080
the world and if you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

248
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,390
person standing up one day and killing

249
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,030
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a reflection of Isis moving in</font>

250
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,240
Iraq<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Syria I think you're dead wrong</font>

251
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,460
see the intellectual honesty dishonesty

252
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,230
there is that we're fighting groups

253
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,760
we're fighting people were fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

254
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,440
idea and they won't even mention the

255
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,720
idea poor John Kerry can't even escape

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,330
from his own face it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> his face I'm</font>

257
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,940
strapped please let me out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my face</font>

258
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,160
it's like you know he's saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well</font>

259
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,540
they've lost this territory there and

260
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,220
that's a good thing Isis has been using

261
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">their territory to recruit they've been</font>

262
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,130
saying we we're establishing the

263
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">caliphate no one has ever done this</font>

264
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,589
before and that's been a good

265
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,210
recruitment tool and okay that's that's

266
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,740
a victory that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we fight you know that we</font>

267
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,630
take away<font color="#CCCCCC"> their territory but we're</font>

268
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,670
fighting an idea and the idea is

269
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,100
spreading you know I subscribe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

270
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,050
science magazine it tells me new

271
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,940
developments in science and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

272
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,470
basic you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it just says this is what</font>

273
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,020
they're fine some scientist I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

274
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought it in i read it to you but some</font>

275
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,240
scientists went over to you know the

276
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,730
Middle East to study why Isis fighters

277
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,950
fight so well and this is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

278
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,300
mean you gotta admire me went out and he

279
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,560
interviewed people the interview these

280
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
dangerous guy found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because</font>

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,250
they have a belief system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

282
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> die for he said maybe we</font>

283
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">should have that is what he says there's</font>

284
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,000
a scientist he's like a scientist

285
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,560
discovering what everybody else knows

286
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has to discover it scientifically</font>

287
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,130
you know they have a belief system we've

288
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,990
lost our belief system we've lost our

289
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,970
religion we think our religion is evil

290
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,530
so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stand up for it so</font>

291
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,610
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we're not</font>

292
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">writing as well as they are because we</font>

293
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,940
don't understand just as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sidebar i</font>

294
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,200
have to mention this because we're

295
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,029
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all these lies are just</font>

296
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,070
hammering us this world of lies that

297
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,890
we're living in this pakistani fashion

298
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,160
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> Qandil Baloche i think her name is</font>

299
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,410
she offended muslims by posing with a

300
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,899
cleric on social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she's a sexy</font>

301
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,060
babe so her brother as you do killed her

302
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,040
strangled her to death right because it

303
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,649
was like he s offended she offended his

304
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">honor or something like this so the</font>

305
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:18,010
Washington Post runs that this the

306
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,019
headline and the USA Today<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked it up</font>

307
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,209
but later changed it pakistani model

308
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,600
killed after offending conservatives so

309
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,130
so be on the lookout for Ted Cruz

310
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,500
because like I the guy I'll just kill

311
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,410
you you know I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well thank God</font>

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,660
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been then she</font>

315
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,339

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're so all right so all lies then we</font>

321
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrible I can't go home and the reason</font>

322
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">is is because the intellectual</font>

323
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,560
dishonesty stops here that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

324
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,540
we get for good days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then everything</font>

325
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">falls about alright so to a coup in</font>

326
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,149
Turkey which is a disaster I mean this

327
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:07,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an unmitigated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disaster the military</font>

328
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,640
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of weird because the military</font>

329
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,260
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the guarantor of</font>

330
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,339
non-religious government of secular

government in<font color="#CCCCCC"> turkey and air doyan the</font>

332
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,860
primary president I guess is has slowly

333
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,890
been moving turkey toward Islamist

334
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,610
government and the military seemed to

335
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,320
stage a coup but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is while</font>

336
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're doyens been doing this he's kind</font>

337
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,899
of been replacing the people in the

338
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,060
military so the military is not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

339
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,070
of a bastion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of secular government</font>

340
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,170
either anyway the thing went terribly

341
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,540
wrong they didn't secure the

342
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,980
communication systems or Doyon was out

343
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,170
of the country but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> came back in he</font>

344
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,970
called for people to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the streets</font>

345
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course who took to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> streets</font>

346
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Islamist they took to the streets</font>

347
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,560
and they stood<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the military</font>

348
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,730
retreated hundreds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people killed</font>

349
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,529
thousand I think he executed thousands

350
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,360
of people he's calling for a

351
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,519
radical cleric who's against him to be

352
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,310
extradited from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US Obama just looked</font>

353
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,750
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deer caught in the headlights</font>

354
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,820
because of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need turkey you</font>

355
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,709
know turkey is an 80 now and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

356
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,720
have an Air Force<font color="#CCCCCC"> Base there and we're</font>

357
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,700
using them to coordinate attacks and

358
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,579
hopefully to stem some of the

359
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,279
immigration crisis that Obama has helped

360
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,260
cause by not taking care of business<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

361
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,089
the Middle East and there's even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

362
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,040
theory I mean now the danger of course

363
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,390
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the country is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go full</font>

364
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Islamist and as a reaction to this he's</font>

365
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to kill out kill everybody who</font>

366
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,579
stood against him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then really turn</font>

367
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">this country into yet another Islamist</font>

368
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,690
nation in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Middle East which would</font>

369
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">really put since it's the only make</font>

370
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,029
majority Islamic country that isn't a

00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,149
nightmare you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's it's going it</font>

372
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,829
would really be terrible there's even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

373
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,200
theory going around that this that the

374

coup<font color="#CCCCCC"> was staged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he staged the coup</font>

in order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reaction to it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clara</font>

feels it can sort of reassert its

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,440
and conservative Pence<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a conservative</font>

469
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,150
a lot of conservatives got angry at him

470
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,100
because of the gay bill in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indiana</font>

471
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,350
passed a bill basically protecting

472
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,390
people who have religious objections to

473
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,010
gay marriage I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a</font>

474
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,960
necessary bill even though I feel

475
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,790
everybody should do whatever he wants

476
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,260
that also means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who don't</font>

477
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to cater you know a gay wedding</font>

478
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,650
shouldn't have to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

479
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,850
should be able to express their

480
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,679
consciences but he backed down on that

481
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,809
when business got on you know got on his

482
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,510
back however basically he's done a good

483
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,610
job in Indiana he's for free as

484
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,260
conservative he's for free trade he's

485
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,910
anti-abortion he believes in a strong

486
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,860
American presence presence in the world

487
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,580
everything the Donald Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

488
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,809
understand that's the only reason he's a

489
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:27,919
strange choice because he's a

490
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,960
conservative but Trump isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright but</font>

491
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,120
he he points out he points out the

connection there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a connection between</font>

that the peacekeepers are to blame the

497
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,790
peacekeepers are to blame for those who

501
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,510
they're just reacting to our xenophobia

502

the fact that we haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

why he<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't represent that particular</font>

515
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,409

about this has been untrue but over the

543
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,460
last decade it turns out that an

over-representation of blacks in prison

564
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,299
is due to their elevated crime rates not

to his narrative he comes up after this

the three comps killed by a madman in

570
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:33,110
and more injured in Baton Rouge Obama

571
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,399
comes out and he says there are

legitimate issues that have been raised

573
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,259

00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:41,299
it's like you know that lies just they

never saw and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama speaking and</font>

576
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,200
there's data and evidence to back up the

concerns that are being expressed by the

578
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:49,039
black lives matter protesters and if

579
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,450
police organizations and departments

580
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,610

582
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,779
to contribute two real solutions and as
