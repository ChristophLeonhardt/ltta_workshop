1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,760
The disappearance of
Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,560
made international headlines.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,900
“The mystery deepens
tonight over the fate

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,580
of Jamal Khashoggi.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,700
Did the Saudi royal family
have him murdered?”

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,790
News outlets from Saudi Arabia
broadcast their own theories

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,500
of what they say
really happened.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,860
Khashoggi is a former adviser
to senior Saudi officials.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,450
He moved to
the U.S. last year

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,020
and has been working
as a columnist

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,220
for The Washington Post.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,100
“We in Saudi Arabia had
about 10,000 royalties

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,080
who were acting around us
like little kings.”

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,540
He’s recently been critical
of the Saudi government.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,000
Turkish authorities say
Khashoggi was killed

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,890
by a team of 15 men,
who arrived

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,770
in Istanbul on private jets
from Saudi Arabia.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,630
The Saudi government has
denied any involvement.

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,130
But here’s the story
Saudi media is telling:

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,720
This segment says the team
of 15 men from Saudi Arabia

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,470
were simply tourists,
not killers.

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,040
In this segment,
the anchors applaud a tweet

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,140
that implies the
Turkish media is spreading

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,720
false information about
the jet allegedly used

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,160
to fly the Saudi hitmen.

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,350
The theory revolves around
a picture of the jet

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,890
that the TV commentators
agree is suspicious.

28
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,270
But the picture is actually
a generic stock image

29
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,190
photographed at
least two years earlier.

30
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,920
One popular theory is that
Qatar, a neighboring arrival

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,480
of Saudi Arabia, is spreading
the narrative that the

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,890
Saudi royal family had
Khashoggi killed.

33
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,090
This theory is pervasive
in Saudi media.

34
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,130
Al Riyadh, a prominent
pro-government daily newspaper,

35
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,320
ran this op-ed on
its front page.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,820
This headline reads:
The Qatari media fails again

37
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,900
in the Khashoggi
disappearance case.

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:00:00,000
But what really happened to
Khashoggi remains a mystery.
