1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,270
As a conservative,

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,710
the words “strike,”
“union” —

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,670
not in my vocabulary.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,130
Our students deserve
to have a fully funded

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,470
education.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,790
I did vote for Trump.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,370
I consider myself a
Bible-believing Christian.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,100
I’ve always been a fan
of fiscal conservatism.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,290
I’ve always voted
Republican,

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,860
but now I’m seeing firsthand
what that gets us.

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,820
The classrooms
are falling apart.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,230
We have festering bathrooms.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,250
We have cockroaches.

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,679
We have tattered textbooks.

15
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,220
Teachers aren’t
getting the resources

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,720
that they need
within the classroom.

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,310
A wave of protests sweeping
across the country,

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,100
led by teachers who say the
future of public education

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
is at stake.

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,460
Teachers and specifically

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,800
public-school teachers
really aren’t valued.

22
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,690
I have to work 15 to
20 extra hours a week

23
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,690
at McDonald’s for minimum wage.

24
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,570
Teaching is my calling.

25
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,600
I love teaching
music to children.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,739
That’s who I am.

27
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,069
And people say,

28
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,870
if you don’t like the money,

29
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,660
go do something else.

30
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,080
I can’t.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,330
I’m 53 years old.

32
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,840
I’m doing what I’m
supposed to do.

33
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,966
I know that I will have to
work until the day I die.

34
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:25,580
I won’t be able to
afford to ever be retired.

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,920
Because of the way
that the state

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,460
has chosen to fund education
for the last 15 years,

37
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,629
it’s simply made it
untenable for me to stay.

38
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:33,670
I’m not leaving teaching.

39
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,360
I am leaving the state
because of these issues.

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,640
I don’t believe it’s
going to get fixed.

41
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,690
I just don’t.

42
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,070
We are 43rd across the
nation in teacher salary.

43
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,650
This is why we’re going to
restore additional assistance.

44
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,480
I’m not bragging on 43rd.

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,470
I’m just saying we’re not last.

46
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,010
So we’re not just striking
for a higher salary.

47
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,880
We’re striking for
resources for our classrooms

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,320
and for our students.

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,220
We are at the bottom of
the pile for the states.

50
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,090
We’ve seen teachers
walking out or striking

51
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,680
in West Virginia, in Oklahoma and
some other states successfully.

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,450
And we realized that
we were worse off

53
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,010
than some of those states were,

54
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,350
and it just grew like wildfire.

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,090
Teachers are riding a
growing wave of anger

56
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,770
over deep education cuts

57
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,080
made by Republican-
led legislatures.

58
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:26,973
[chanting]

59
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:28,860
The teacher protests
have been described

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,987
by some as a red-state revolt.

61
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,410
I’ve said I’m on the
side of the teachers,

62
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,380
and I’ve been listening,
and we’ve been working.

63
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,550
This will result in a net pay
increase of 20 percent

64
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,810
by the beginning of
school year 2020.

65
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,140
So, on the surface,
that sounds amazing.

66
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,800
It won’t help substitutes,
it won’t help our aides.

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,550
It won’t help our
nurses, our front staff.

68
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,510
It comes out of funds that
go to veterans,

69
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,440
people in our population who are
disabled and on Medicaid,

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,270
colleges and universities
in our state.

71
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,140
I voted for Governor Ducey

72
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,720
and I was really hopeful.

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,810
And now, honestly, I
just feel betrayed.

74
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,050
How can you say you’re pro-life,
and pro-family, and pro-middle class?

75
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,300
Even as a conservative,

76
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,470
I think it’s only fiscally
responsible to increase a tax

77
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,370
to fund public education.

78
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,350
Oh my gosh.

79
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,130
Did I just say it out loud?

80
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,830
I do.

81
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,380
I support a tax.

82
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,100
I will tell you this
right now,

83
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,430
if you are a Republican politician,

84
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,720
you better get behind education.

85
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,550
I’ve been on my feet
for five hours,

86
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,550
waiting on people,

87
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,530
sweeping, mopping.

88
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,570
I probably won’t get to bed until 12:30
or 1 o’clock tonight.

89
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,950
And then I’ve got to be back
up at 6 or 6:30 tomorrow morning.

90
00:03:50,950 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.
