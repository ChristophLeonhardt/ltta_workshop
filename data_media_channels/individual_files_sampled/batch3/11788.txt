we're sure but we aren't sure it's safe now but don't touch anything we're sure they're Russian but we don't know who they are contradictions everywhere based on a body of intelligence the government has concluded that the two individuals named by the police and CPS are officers from the Russian military intelligence service also known as the GRU got any idea as to whether they are actually serving officers in Russian intelligence agencies so we have significant lines of inquiry about who there may be we want people to come forward and give us the evidence you'd think they would have to know who these two suspects are before accusing them of being Russian military intelligence agents but no instead they're asking the public for help to identify these two men who to resume already seems to know this was not a rogue operation it was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian stage it'd be real easy if they just called up the Russians and asked them with passport numbers and everything but they aren't on speaking terms I can confirm that we have had no cooperation from the Russian government on the other hand how do you complain that someone isn't being helpful when you refuse to pick up the phone the British envoy said that the UK site will not present any materials London also refused to present any other information about the case passport numbers patronymics data from the visa application and so on we understand that they will be transmitted by Interpol so here we are the British refusing to so much as acknowledge the Russians and Moscow in turn refusing to budge until the Brits respond to certain questions look the Russians have asked for fingerprints harmless rights of the two suspects the British say they'll hand over nothing and then complain that the Russians aren't being helpful contradictions despite the meticulous and painstaking searches and although unlikely it is impossible to guarantee that there are no other materials present in the Salisbury area all the experts advise that the evidence to date does not suggest any long-term health risk from short term or one off contact with low levels of this agent so which is it might be a tad confusing for locals and Salsbury everything's fine and safe but it isn't so don't pick anything up and keep an eye out is it over or not and then of course there's the huge gaps and the investigation we don't yet know where the suspects disposed of the novel chalk that they use to attack the scribbles front door or where dawn and Charlie got the bottle that poisoned them or is it if it is the same bottle that has been used in both poisonings they don't seem to know what happened to the container for months and months they're now asking the public for help to identify the suspects who they've already identified as secret agents of the discipline giu and to explain what happened to the nerve agent container which the said disciplined secret agents just seemed to throw away the ease of identification doesn't seem very professional one of the deadliest substances known to man ended up in a charity bin suddenly after six months we're told this is how in the poison came into the country and a perfume bottle why could we not been told that before why wasn't that put out in a work and to stop these two people picking up a perfume bottle with the poison in it rather than dying as a consequence why are we not being told why have we not been told the full extent of what the danger might be in Salisbury and that's still not been resolved the poor people there are still suffering so as I said I think there's a lot of questioning a lot of suspicion about this in Britain and to top all that off the British and Syst it could only have been the Russians first they said that only Russia manufactured Nova chalks and then that felt through the Russians pointed out a dozen other countries capable of doing so Czech Republic admitted they had synthesized small quantities for defense Britain's own chemical lab Porton Down admitted it had micro stockpiles contradictions everywhere you
