1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,390
Zimbabwe has a new leader for the first time
in over 37 years.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:10,290
Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn into office on
November 24th, 2017, becoming only the second

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,480
president in the country’s history since
it gained independence in 1980.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,370
The former president resigned shortly after
the military rolled into the streets of the

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,470
nation’s capital.

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,520
So what led to this drastic shift in power,
and what lies ahead for Zimbabwe?

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,020
To understand how we got here, we first need
to examine who the old president was.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,460
Robert Mugabe grew up in Southern Rhodesia,
a self-governing British colony that would

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,390
later become Zimbabwe.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,040
He grew up during a time when Indians were
fighting for independence from its mutual

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,690
colonizer, Britain.

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,250
As a young man, Mugabe was inspired by leaders
like Gandhi and had even attended the same

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,980
univeristy of South African freedom fighter
Nelson Mandela.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,760
That’s when he decided to enter into politics
and advocacy.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,290
After spending a few year as a teacher abroad,
he returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1960 to

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,910
join the african nationalist movement.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,979
After parting ways with the group, Mugabe
formed his own political party called the

18
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,670
Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic
Front, or more commonly referred to as Zanu-PF.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,639
He was arrested, along with some of his political
allies, in 1963.

20
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:20,170
Magabe spent 11 years behind bars but continued
to communicate with his party members during

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,810
his time in prison.

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,270
After his release and a british-brokered peace
deal in 1979 that established the independent

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,610
state of Zimbabwe, Mugabe went on the win
national elections becoming the country’s

24
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,610
first leader.

25
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,979
But while he remained largely popular, he
began to give himself more power and changed

26
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:42,290
the constitution to make himself the “executive
president” in 1988 which led to his 37 year

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,310
rule.

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,530
But things reached a boiling point when Mugabe
dismissed his long time vice president Emmerson

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,539
Mnangagwa on November 6th, 2017.

30
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:58,310
This marked a shifting point in popular opinion
in Zimbabwe - because citizens saw the move

31
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,849
as a way for the 93 year old president to
clear the field for his wife, often referred

32
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:07,349
to as “Gucci Grace” to become president
after he stepped down or died.

33
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,940
Mugabe’s move angered not only tens of thousands
of citizens, but also his ruling party and

34
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,060
the military.

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,170
This lead to military intervention.

36
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,040
They rolled tanks into the streets of Harare,
on November 14, taking over government buildings,

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,900
state broadcasters, and even detained Mugabe,
forcing him to resign.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,489
And while some may celebrate the removal of
the world’s longest-serving head of state

39
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,410
as a victory for democracy, the man who was
just sworn into office to take his place was

40
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:40,280
the former vice president who served by his
side for years.

41
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,519
The new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, is
by no means a change candidate, but rather

42
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,780
Zanu-PF’s last ditch effort to continue
to hold onto power.

43
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,471
Mnangagwa, who is nicknamed “the crocodile”
for his ruthless political reputation and

44
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:57,500
involvement in some of the worst atrocities
to happen in Zimbabwe's history.

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,760
Especially a crackdown on political opponents
in the 1980s that left thousands dead.

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,950
And while Mnangagwa was only sworn into office
to serve until national elections are held

47
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,739
in early 2018, only time will tell whether
opposition voices will be given the proper

48
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,640
platform to openly and fairly campaign against
his Zanu-PF party or whether Mnangagwa will

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,319
live up to his reputation as a brutal leader.

50
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,260
Robert Mugabe started as a popular president,
but slowly transformed into the world’s

51
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,620
longest serving dictator.

52
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,209
But how do presidents become dictators?

53
