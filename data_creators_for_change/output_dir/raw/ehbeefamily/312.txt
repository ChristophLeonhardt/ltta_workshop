1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,040
there was a time when i was alone

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,420
nowhere to go and no place to call home

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,720
my only friends was the man in the moon

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,360
and even sometimes he would go away, too

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,440
then one night, as i closed my eyes

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,860
i saw a shadow flying high

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,200
he came to me with the sweetest smile

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,060
told me he wanted to talk for awhile

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,980
he said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,600
I promise that you'll never be lonely" and

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,880
ever since that day

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,040
I am a lost boy from Neverland

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,920
Usually hanging out with peter pan

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,980
and when we're bored we play in the woods

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,740
always on the run from Captain Hook

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,080
"Run, run, lost boy" they say to me

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,980
away from all of reality

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,800
Neverland is home to lost boys like me

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,600
and lost boys like me are free

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,280
Neverland is home to lost boys like me

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
and lost boys like me are free

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,920
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,960
believe in him and believe in me

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,320
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,040
To your beautiful destiny

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,160
As we soared above the town that never loved me

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,440
I realized I finally had a family

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
Soon enough we reached Neverland

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,760
Peacefully my feet hit the sand

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,400
and always i will say

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,600
