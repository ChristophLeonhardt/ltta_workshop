00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">aurea thanks for being with us this</font>

2
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,350
morning i care is an inspiration behind

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,289
the book the inspiration behind the book

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,300
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to write a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> book because</font>

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,160
let's face and we were reporting on the

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,230
downward spiral<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the financial system</font>

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,140
it was awful and I knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were</font>

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,939
opportunities out there where people

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,369
were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make money so I started</font>

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,020
working my rolodex calling the rural

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,120
ross's of the world if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will and I</font>

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,010
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were seeing pockets</font>

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,379
of opportunity so I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit down</font>

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,950
and give my axis so to speak to readers

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,780
out there who might normally not have

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,730
the access that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have with Wilbur so</font>

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,410
what were you try to achieve or hope to

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,289
accomplish in educating the public what

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,239
I hope to<font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve was to get into the</font>

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,520
mind of these leaders and get the how

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,399
and why it's the way that they do things

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,629
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that they analyze a</font>

23
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,750
situation that makes them so unique and

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,188
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of tap into that</font>

25
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,010
knowledge that way you are I or the

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,720
reader can actually kind of maybe learn

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,210
something from it and maybe gleam

28
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,409
whatever they're doing and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,150
those strategies to their own businesses

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,100
and their own investing styles so you

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,409
give investing advice or tips on stocks

32
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,250
from the rolodex that you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

33
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,460
exactly I sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ron</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Baron</font>

34
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Camlann gone really big legendary</font>

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">investors kind of saying okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font>

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,979
your reaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the fall of the</font>

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,630
financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> system but more importantly</font>

38
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,579
what did you see where are the

39
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,920
opportunities and they were extremely

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,900
candid I mean Ron Baron says that he

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,869
lays awake at night now because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

42
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,759
opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> he is so excited and he</font>

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,610
says because a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

44
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,869
losing their jobs while that is

45
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,670
extremely I mean it's painful it's hard

46
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,259
for the economy there are opportunities

47
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,479
there for an investor because he's

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,340
investing in DeVry he's investing in

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,899
strayer education because people are

50
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to school to learn a new</font>

51
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,090
career so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a unique way of</font>

52
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,040
playing the market so do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the average investor can become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

54
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,580
floor

55
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,360
if applying these best practices I want

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that far but i'm a firm believer</font>

57
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,020
as you know taking one mr. Buffett says

58
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,230
you invest in what you know ken Langone

59
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,870
him said he never<font color="#E5E5E5"> got caught up in the</font>

60
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,370
financial crisis because he didn't

61
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,530
invest in derivatives he invests in CD s

62
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,810
because he didn't understand it that's a

63
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">profound comment because it takes a big</font>

64
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,490
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say listen I don't understand</font>

65
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,560
something I'm not going to go into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,450
invest in what you know and it's very

67
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,270
simple but it really does apply so

68
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,800
you've called the book at celebration<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,050
capitalism and nowadays people are so

70
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,700
keen on the connotation of that word

71
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,680
what did you mean by that stealing is a

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,600
celebration of capitalism because that's

73
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,390
what our nation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is built upon banks as</font>

74
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,459
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> now have become a dirty dirty word</font>

75
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,220
and we have to realize but not all banks

76
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,740
are bad it was the greed and the

77
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,740
ignorance and the arrogance of a few

78
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really toppled everything but there</font>

79
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,120
are banks out there that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing well</font>

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,070
there are companies that arguing well

81
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,840
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to embrace what</font>

82
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
I'm talking about as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> celebration of</font>

83
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,739
capitalism because it's capitalism

84
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,230
that's going to lead us<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of this this</font>

85
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,450
downward spiral that we have experienced

86
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">what was the overall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or general</font>

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,500
consensus on government intervention and

88
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,030
stimulus through the downturn and

89
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,190
staving off<font color="#CCCCCC"> well everybody thought was</font>

90
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,470
essentially or we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it you know it's a</font>

91
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,989
mixed bag it's a very fine line<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

92
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,450
helping and then overstepping wayne

93
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,840
Huizenga who wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> my forward said that</font>

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,790
the POIs we have the populace drum

95
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,769
beating right now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> washington trying</font>

96
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to handcuff corporations if you will he</font>

97
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,280
says that government<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to be a partner</font>

98
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,980
and they have to work with business not

99
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,830
work against them not laying on taxes to

100
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,510
get you know get our money back they

101
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,120
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay no he's saying you have to</font>

102
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">work you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to encourage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have tax cuts</font>

103
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,980
that can maybe encourage R&D encourage

104
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,540
hiring new people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was pretty</font>

105
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,580
much a really big theme no matter what

106
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,380
sector that you were in so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

107
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,360
silver linings of economic downturn I

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,850
think there is i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you know while we</font>

109
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,800
have learned some very harsh lessons

110
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,660
right now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have learned that in the</font>

111
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,810
new economy you know GDP growth will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

112
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,090
less we have to learn that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consumer</font>

113
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,410
is not going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going out there and</font>

114
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,450
buying the flat screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> TVs that they</font>

115
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,040
can't afford and your house is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

116
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,410
ATM machine so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know bottom</font>

117
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,140
line is you know less is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

118
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,790
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to a more modest</font>

119
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,590
lifestyle and that is something that

120
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,630
even Pieter Cohen has expressed to his

121
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,550
own traders saying listen you're not

122
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to make the money that you did a</font>

123
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,360
year or two ago this is the new norm and

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,210
the new norm is a little bit less so one

125
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,190
final question obviously your background

126
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,720
is television<font color="#E5E5E5"> y a book I just feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

127
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,790
fortunate where a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say at</font>

128
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,320
the trillion-dollar rolodex I me I could

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,930
call Wilbur Ross rich Allah<font color="#E5E5E5"> frak Jim</font>

130
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,180
Lentz of Toyota<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want and</font>

131
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,670
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sit and I talked to them they're</font>

132
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,230
brilliant in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

133
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,270
business and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I wrote a</font>

134
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,030
book and I interview them i could give

135
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,280
this access to a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

136
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,570
don't have that type of access and

137
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,580
that's the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font>

138
00:05:17,580 --> 00:00:00,000
it thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>
