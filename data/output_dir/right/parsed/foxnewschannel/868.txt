>>  WELCOME BACK.
THE HOUSE COULD TAKE UP A
COMPROMISED IMMIGRATION BILL
THIS COMING WEEK, AND THE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TIGHTENING
THE THUMB SCREWS ON DEMOCRATS AS
MORE KIDS ARE SEPARATED FROM
THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER.
THE TWEET TODAY, DEMOCRATS CAN
FIX THE FORCED FAMILY BREAKUP AT
THE BORDER BY WORKING ON NEW
LEGISLATION FOR A CHANGE.
THIS IS WHY WE NEED MORE
REPUBLICANS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER.
DEMOCRATS ARE ONLY GOOD AT THREE
THINGS, HIGH, AT THATS, HIGH
CRIME AND OBSTRUCTION.
SAD.
NOT SAD, BUT A HAPPY LARRY
O'CONNOR TO DISCUSS.
THE PRESIDENT IS OF MANY THINGS,
A MASTER AT FRAMING A DEBATE.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIM FRAMING
THIS DEBATE ABOUT THESE KIDS
BEING LOCKED UP AS THE FAULT OF
DEMOCRATS?
IS HE WINNING?
>> WELL, I THINK SO FAR HE IS.
I THINK HE IS ACTUALLY WINNING
THAT DEBATE BECAUSE I GUESS
THEY'VE GOT A COUPLE OF
DIFFERENT ANGLES THEY CAN TAKE
ON THE TRUMPED UP CONTROVERSY
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE
CELEBRATION OF THE KIDS.
WHERE WAS THE OUTCRY WHEN THIS
EXACT POLICY WAS INSTITUTED
UNDER BARACK OBAMA?
AND THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS
ITSELF.
THE SECOND IS THIS, THE
PRESIDENT IS ON THE RECORD
SAYING, HEY, I'M WILLING TO MEET
YOU GUYS SOMEWHERE, I RAN ON THE
IDEA THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO  GIVE
AMNESTY WITHOUT--
AND YOU'VE GO  GOT TO GIVE
SOMETHING.
>> THE FACT REMAINS THE
PRESIDENT IS A LITTLE ON
DEFENSE, IF HE WANT TODAY CHANGE
THE POLICY, HE COULD.
THAT'S A PREROGATIVE OF THE
EXECUTIVE AND THIS IS HOW HE IS
DEFENDING IT, AND THIS IS HOW
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO MAKE
HAY OUT OF IT.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> NO, I HATE IT.
I HATE THE CHILDREN BEING TAKEN
AWAY.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO CHANGE
THEIR LAW.
THAT'S THE DEMOCRATS' LAW.
WE CAN CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW.
>> DO YOU THINK CHILDREN,
WHETHER DREAMERS OR LITTLE
CHILDREN AT THE BORDER NOW FOR
POLITICAL PURPOSE, IT'S
SHAMEFUL.
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO YOU'RE
GOING TO AGREE WITH.
>> WHO HEAR THAT NANCY PELOSI
SAY IT'S SHAMEFUL TO USE
CHILDREN TO PUSH A POLICY, IS
RIDICULOUS.
AND DEMOCRATS SAY IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE CHILDREN AND CHILDREN ARE
SUFFERING.
ON ANY POLICY, THE IDEA OF
DEMOCRATS JUMPING UP AND MEDIA
JUMPING UP, MOST OF THE MEDIA
AND THUMPING THE BIBLE.
LELAND: HE STARTED THAT.
BUT HE STARTED AS WELL YOU WANT
TO USE CHRISTIAN VALUES, THERE
ARE OTHER CHRISTIAN VALUES.
THESE GUYS HAVE NOT USED THE
BIBLE TO JUSTIFY A LOT OF
POLICIES THAT GO AGAINST MY
CHRISTIAN VALUES AND THEY'LL
CALL ME THE PERSON WHO IS TRYING
TO PUSH THEOCRACY BECAUSE I WANT
TO PROTECT UNBORN CHILDREN.
LET'S SEE THEM PUSH THAT ASIDE.
WHY AREN'T THEY UPSET ABOUT THE
CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM PARENTS
BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE CRIMES
COMMITTED IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CHILDREN
SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION AND CRIMES
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
LELAND: THERE'S RHETORIC ON BOTH
SIDES.
AND IN THE END YOU SEE BOTH
SIDES JOCKEYING FOR POSITION ON
THIS.
THERE IS TWO BILLS IN CONGRESS
RIGHT NOW, THE GOOD LIVES BILL
AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY AGREES
IS PRETTY MUCH DEAD ON ARRIVAL
AND THE NEW, QUOTE, UNQUOTE,
COMPROMISE BILL THAT EVEN SOME
REPUBLICANS ARE NOW SAYING
THEY'RE NOT OKAY WITH.
SO, WHAT'S THE POINT?
IS THIS GOING TO GET SOLVED?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK THAT DEMOCRATS
WANT THIS SOLVED.
I THINK IT'S REALLY--
OTHER THAN WE'RE GOING TO
IMPEACH TRUMP, I DON'T WHAT
OTHER ISSUE THEY'VE GOT GOING
INTO NOVEMBER.
I FRANKLY DON'T THINK THEY WANT
TO FIXED.
AND I DON'T THINK THAT GOODLATTE
IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL.
THAT IS THE GOOD COMPROMISE BILL
GIVING AMNESTY TO 700,000
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
THE PRESIDENT NEVER PLANNED ON
RUNNING ON THAT.
IT'S BASICALLY SAYING SOME
PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT
MOST AMERICANS AGREE WITH, WHICH
IS LET'S HAVE MANDATED E-VERIFY.
MAKE EVERY EMPLOYER DO AN
E-VERIFY ON THE IMMIGRATION
STATUS.
WHAT THEY'RE CALLING THE
COMPROMISE BILL, LELAND, DOESN'T
MANDATE THAT SO WE'RE NEVER
GOING TO FIX THE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM IF WE DON'T
WANT THAT.
LELAND: YOU DON'T THINK THAT THE
DEMOCRATS WANT TO FIX THIS
BECAUSE IT'S--
>> I'M CYNICAL.
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUAL LY
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUAL L
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY I
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY INT
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY INL
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY INE
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY INT
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY INA
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY INL
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY INY
LELAND: BEING INTELLECTUALLY IN
CYNICAL WITH ME, ARE THERE SOME
REPUBLICANS THINK THIS IS BETTER
AS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE THAN TO
COMPROMISE?
>> I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK
SOME REPUBLICANS WANT IT AS A
CAMPAIGN ISSUE SADLY OPENING UP
MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION BECAUSE A LOT OF
THEY RAISE A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF
IT OR REALLY THINK IT'S BETTER
FOR OUR ECONOMY TO HAVE A FLEE
