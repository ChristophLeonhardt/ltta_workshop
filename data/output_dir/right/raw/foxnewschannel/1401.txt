INVOLVING THE MURDER OF A

00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:37,912
TEENAGER.

15
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,379
QUICK QUESTION.

16
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:41,549
WHAT WAS HIS GANG NICKNAME?

00:00:51,492 --> 00:01:03,504
HE IS TARGETING ANIMALS AND THEY

25
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:04,105
ARE PARSING WORDS.

26
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,640
IMAGINE YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE IN

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,875
YOUR NEIGHBOR CALLS THE POLICE

28
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:07,675
BECAUSE YOU WERE YELLING FIRE

29
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:08,042
TOO LOUD.

30
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:09,544
THAT IS THE MEDIA WHEN IT COMES

31
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:10,211
TO MS 13.

32
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:11,446
CHECK OUT THE RESPONSE TO TRUMP

33
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,513
PULLING UP NORTH GRAND SUMMIT.

00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:14,182
A PLANNED SUMMIT WITH

36
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:14,649
CONGENITAL.

37
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,451

38
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,419
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP CANCELED THE

00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:24,592
JUNE SUMMIT.

40
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:25,293
>> IT IS STUNNING, ISN'T IT?

41
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,895
GREG: IF YOU ARE STUNNED BY THAT

42
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:27,862
AND THEN YOU'RE SHOCKED EVERY

43
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:29,030
DAY BY YOUR OWN FEET.

44
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,300
WHERE DID THESE COME FROM?

45
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,301
FACT IS, THIS OCCURRED IN

46
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,637
NEGOTIATIONS AND ALL TRUMP DOES

47
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:42,911
IS NEGOTIATE.

48
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:44,112
I'M SURE AT HIS OWN FUNERAL

49
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:45,713
HE'LL TRY TO CUT A DEAL WITH THE

50
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:46,114
GRAVEDIGGER.

51
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:47,515
THE MEDIA CAN ONLY SEE THE BAD

52
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:49,083
AND TRUMP THEM IN NORTH KOREA IT

53
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,451
COMES IN TWO FLAVORS, MOCK TRUMP

54
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:51,920
FOR STANDING IN AND -- THEY WANT

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,855
IT BOTH WAYS.

56
00:01:53,855 --> 00:02:05,533
NO WONDER AMERICA RATES THE

57
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:06,567
PRESS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN

58
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,902
GOUT BUT MEDIA ANGER IS DERIVED

59
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:09,037
FROM A DELUSION THAT THEY CAN'T

60
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:09,336
SHAKE.

61
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,471
TRUMP IS EVIL AND/OR STUPID BUT

62
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,005
NEVER, EVER WRITE.

63
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,006
THE SOLUTION IS GETTING WORSE.

64
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,441
IF ONLY WE HAD A DELUSION

65
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:13,875
STRIPPER.

66
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,742

00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:15,977
MEETING IS CANCELED.

69
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,078
PRESIDENT TRUMP CANCELS THE

00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:23,117
>> DONALD TRUMP WON'T STOP UNTIL

73
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:32,126
HE DESTROYS THE COUNTRY.

74
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:32,627
>> ARE YOU SURE?

75
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,128
MAYBE IT'S NOT AS BAD AS YOU

76
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:34,629
ALWAYS THINK.

77
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,029
>> I'M SURE.

78
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,197
THIS PRESIDENT IS WORSE THAN MS

79
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,733
13 AND THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID

80
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,535
ABOUT HITLER.

81
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,402
>> YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN A

82
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:41,736
REALITY.

83
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:42,737
YOU NEED THIS DELUSION STRIPPER.

84
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:43,304

>> HOW ABOUT NOW?

97
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:04,726

WORKING YET?

108
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:29,684

HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE

112
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,353
PRESIDENT?

113
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:33,287
>> YOU MEAN THE PRESIDENT THAT

114
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:37,191
STOOD UP TO IRAN AND NORTH

115
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:37,492
KOREA?

116
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:41,429
THANK YOU, DELUSION STRIPPER.

[APPLAUSE]

118
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,105
GREG: JUST AN EXCUSE TO SPRAY

119
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,441
WATER ON TOM.

120
00:03:53,441 --> 00:04:04,452
THE SUMMIT

121
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:06,287
WATER ON TOM.
THE SUMMIT SHOULD THAT BOTHER

122
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:06,721
YOU?

123
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:08,156
NO, BECAUSE IT IS TRUMP AND HE

124
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:09,023
IS NOT THESE GUYS.

125
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:10,491
TRUMP KNOWS WHEN TO LEAVE THE

126
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:11,492
TABLE, OBAMA, HILLARY, CARRIE

127
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:12,593
CANNOT EVEN FIND THE TABLE.

128
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:14,028
IT'S WEIRD SINCE CARRIE IS MADE

129
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:14,529
FROM A TABLE.

130
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:15,496
HE'S A WOODEN FELLOW.

131
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:21,769
MIKE DELAYED CLAPPING.

132
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,503
NORTH KOREA ALREADY WANTS BACK

133
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:23,204
IN BUT THE MEDIA IS OBSESSED

134
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:23,938
WITH COLLUSION WHILE DISMISSING

135
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:24,672
THE OTHER STORY THAT AT LEAST

136
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:27,775
ONE DUDE WOULD PAY TONS OF MONEY

137
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,377
TO SPRAY

138
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:29,410
TO SPYAY

139
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,378
TO SPY ON THE TRUNK IN MAINE.

140
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:33,848
FIRST THEY SAY THERE IS NO SPINE

141
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:35,416
BUT IF THERE WAS A SPINE THAN IT

142
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,217
IS GOOD AS MINE.

143
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:39,987
IT'S LIKE A SPY HUG BUT IT'S NOT

144
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,522
SPINE WHICH IS WHY WE CAN'T TELL

145
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:47,862
YOU THE NAME OF THE SPY SO HE'S

146
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:48,262
NOT A SPY.

147
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:49,297
HERE'S A HANDY VIDEO TO FOLLOW

148
00:04:49,297 --> 00:05:02,977
THE TAPE ON ALL OF THIS.

149
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:39,280
[APPLAUSE]

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,114
GREG: CAN WATCH THAT FOREVER.

151
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:41,649
THE MEDIA IS TIED IN KNOTS AS

152
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,183
TRUMP ROLLS ON.

153
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,251
AREAS OF ANNAPOLIS ON FRIDAY.

154
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,552
>> WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN, I CAN

155
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,253
TELL YOU THAT.

156
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:46,120
WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN.

157
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,855
THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT WAR IS

158
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:49,056
TO BE FULLY PREPARED FOR WAR.

159
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,191
WE ARE WITNESSING THE GREAT

160
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:53,661
REAWAKENING OF THE AMERICAN

161
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:56,697
SPIRIT AND OF AMERICAN MIGHT.

162
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:59,667
WE HAVE REDISCOVERED OUR

163
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:03,070
IDENTITY, REGAINED HER STRIDE

164
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,408
AND WE ARE PROUD AGAIN.

165
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,376
GREG: DID YOU HEAR THAT?

166
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:11,045
THAT IS TRUMP SPEAKING NOT TO US

167
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,015
THE BUT THE WORLD.

168
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,950
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

169
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,285
BECAUSE IT PASSES OFF THE PEOPLE

170
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:23,491
WHO CAN DO IT MEANING THE MEDIA.

171
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,692
TRUMP SAYS AMERICA FIRST AND

172
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:26,394
RUSSIA GET THAT IN CHINA GETS IT

173
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:39,440

RUSSIA GET THAT IN CHINA GETS IT

00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,443
THE MESSAGE AMERICA IS NO LONGER

176
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,678
THE WORLD'S WELCOME MAT FOR THEM

177
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:44,912
TO WIPE THEIR SHOES ON.

178
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:46,614
IF YOU SAY WALK SOFTLY, CARRY A

179
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,349
BIG STICK, TO DO THAT YOU HAVE

180
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:49,817
TO SHOW THE STICK NOW AND THEN.

181
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:50,785
TRUMP IS HIJACKED THE BULLHORN.

182
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,786
BEFORE IT WAS ALWAYS HOLLYWOOD

183
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,887
THAT TRANSMITTED OUR VALUES TO

184
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,288
THE WORLD AND SAID WE WERE

185
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,189
GUILTY OF [INAUDIBLE] BUT NOT

186
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,523
ANYMORE.

187
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,390
AMERICA HAS A NEW SPOKESMAN.

188
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,692
IT'S NO LONGER HELLO, WE ARE

189
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,193
