well I have a solution tell people not to come to our country illegally that's the solution don't come to our country illegally come like other people do come legally you know the answer to the question president the President of the United States was asked about the children under five who were ordered as of today to be reunited with their parents his answer don't come here illegally and that was his response to this question on the government missing the deadline to reunite the youngest migrant children a federal judge has ruled or did rule last month that aged children under five must be reunited with their families by today officials have until July 26th to return the older kids now the government says under 3,000 children are in US custody right now a hundred of them 102 of them are under the age of five and of those fifty-four are expected to be reunited today which leaves 46 NBC's Gabe Gutierrez has been talking to parents and joins us now from El Paso Texas okay okay I understand and I've heard the argument some of these children were brought here by people who weren't their parents now we D we need DNA testing it just in addition to some of the parents have already been deported a population hornet's nest what is the Department of Health and Human Services or DHS saying they were very quick to snap break these kids from their parents and now why is it so complicated either Stephanie good morning well yeah basically the government's saying well it's complicated so they can't get these kids were united in time and today federal judges expected here from the Department of Justice again in California get this updated timetable for exactly how many are gonna be reunited today and how many would take a longer time but much of this progress process immigration advocates say has been done in secret so there's no clear method on how they're gonna be reunited for the most part we expect to learn more about that today but first let me set the scene if we're exactly I am I'm here at the border the El Paso Texas border right over there is Juarez Mexico the real gran is right there we're on a ride-along with Customs and Border Protection at the Border Patrol and just so you can see here this is a canal and there's the border fence right there this canals about eight nine feet deep and they say that it has proven fatal for several of these undocumented immigrants that come here just today within the past hour or so board Patrol apprehended about five hundred nationals they tell us now you mentioned that I've been speaking with families that haven't been able to be reunited with their children and there is a sense of desperation we've spoken with some of them who say that every day they spend without their children feels like a month at this point women we met one woman named Ignaz she's 37 years old from El Salvador came here several weeks ago has only been able to communicate with her children one is her son nine years old and then her daughter had her sixth birthday several weeks ago while in custody she described to us the desperate moments when she was forced to say goodbye to her children cuanto tiempo muy tarde our porque photo facial que n√≥s kita rakyat Rosie ho y por que estan difficile que los entering and we also spoke with another another parent his name was Mario is 32 years old he has only been able to speak with his ten-year-old daughter just a few times today he was expecting to go to a local shelter here in El Paso and see her face to face for the first time so Stephanie and Allie even though this deadline is approaching and you know now appears to be extending the result is still confusion about how to reunite these youngest of their children now their parents are waiting daily for more information at this point and they don't know when they will be reunited with their children but that woman is older gee why was it so why was it so easy for them to take our children but so hard for them to give them back hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and high you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
