you're gonna love this podcast he's gonna have some of the top comedians and comedy writers on there so if you want to check that out along with the entire audio network go to T y-t-dot-com slash audio the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of protecting some of our privacy's and this is specifically pertaining to cell phone' location data so apparently this Supreme Court ruling indicates that police who want to access that data need to do so after they obtain a warrant in the 5-4 ruling the court said police generally need a court approved warrant to get the data setting a higher legal hurdle than previously existed under federal law the court said obtaining such data without a warrant from wireless carriers as police routinely do amounted to an unreasonable search and seizure under the US Constitution's Fourth Amendment so this case was brought forth by an individual who got arrested because of a string of robberies that he did commit and the evidence used against him included GPS data from his phone and so the argument was well there was no warrant obtained in order to get access to that data and so it went all the way to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court ruled okay yes police do need a warrant in cases like this however there is an exception being made for emergency situations so this is a great ruling and it was the four liberals and Chief Justice John Roberts which is a little surprising but very welcomed and and and the more he does this the more that he would earn the right to say hey he just caused balls and strikes as he said in his confirmation hearings and is not doing it based on politics I wish it was broader it doesn't apply to a lot of things that they could still search some business records they can still look at they could certainly obtain war an emergency situation I'm sorry they don't need to obtain warrants in an emergency situation which is understandable but but there are some other cases to that that they still have some broad powers but this is really good because first of all if we cared about the entire Constitution the Fourth Amendment is an enormous part of that and it's one of the the provisions of the Constitution that protect us the most so if the government big government is allowed to spying on everything we do without any suspicion at all well can they find something you did wrong in your whole life if they chose to target you for whatever reason why yes is yes right so the Fourth Amendment prohibits that you can't just go on fishing expeditions you can't just target people you have to have a reasonable suspicion now if you do then you can go get a warrant from a court and the court will say oh okay that makes sense you were investigating this guy because he was the neighborhood of these robberies and you've got enough evidence let me give you a warrant oh now you search this phone and you see that he was in those areas go ahead and use that evidence that's called due process that's called our system of government and the fact that they have enforce it here is almost a little shocking I mean when it comes to privacy issues I feel like courts tend to rule against the American people again and again and so especially in this case I mean it's involving a man who did commit the robberies right and he was convicted of committing those robberies by the way just because of this ruling it doesn't mean that that those convictions will be overturned he's still facing the consequences for what he did but I think with the the you know Supreme Court did here was the right thing and you know just to give you a quote from Justice John Roberts who did write the opinion he said we declined to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless carriers database of physical location information and and I love that they're taking that stance because it doesn't really take much to even get that warrant right I mean all they have to do the authorities is say or prove that there's probable cause and in this case there was probable cause they just didn't want to that extra step in obtaining that warrant I think that's a key point that it's just be the the procedure to get a warrant obtained a warrant has become so easy for for the police and for and for detectives and investigators that this this this this ruling is certainly welcome and it's a huge surprise you know Robert swinging with the Liberals like you did with Obamacare but there there needs to be such a much deeper reform of the way we you know we prosecute crimes the way we investigate crimes you know often these these warrants I mean the cops know which judges kind of lean which way in terms of you know if the if the warrant case is a little weak they know they got to go to that guy if they have like a like a clear-cut case they can go to the tougher guy and and it's and it's you know there's all kinds of abuses that happen all the time so like well this this this ruling is very welcomed the Supreme Court you know is a limited kind of vehicle to make this kind of change like we ultimately need broad-based politics yeah I totally agree with you on that I think we need to you know maybe raise the standards for obtaining the warrants in the first place but I feel like that's a losing I think what was really interesting was that Sonia Sotomayor justice Sotomayor made a reference to 1984 and when she was talking about big brother and I just think when I think about all of the things that are happening like these kinds of things are one step in the fight away from it because you know while we were distracted by the jacket you know they were attacking healthcare Medicaid and Medicare we're like we really don't they keep us so we're not paying attention to all of the stuff that's going on cuz so much is going on at the same time and I want to always fight for our privacy I mean are we are in danger there's corrupt police in the police department and why should they have access to our locations and I just think that what we needed a victory look I know that a lot of the conservatives on the court for others just almost always just go okay police whatever they you say you win I don't keep Clarence Thomas I don't think was awake during any of the proceedings of like commuters but if you're a real conservative you actually this is an issue that conservatives and progressives should agree on so you don't want big government tracking everything that you do remember big government could also be Obama could also be Bill Clinton or it could have been Hillary Clinton so in 2012 and by the way there was a series this is I know continued to be shocking a series of good decisions by the court on privacy issues in 2012 they said that you cannot government cannot place a GPS tracking device on your vehicle without a warrant that should be obvious yeah so yeah a guy if you think he did a series of crimes and you have some evidence to indicate that you need more evidence that's how our system works then you go get a warrant and track them right but you shouldn't be able to put random devices on people's cars can you imagine if a Democratic president decided on these right-wingers are problematic you know what I'm gonna put devices on all their cars yeah track where they go and if any of them go to a wrong place or to a wrong building for whatever reason that I'm gonna get them right that would be terrible you know it's interesting though I mean maybe I'm not remembering it correctly so correct me if I'm wrong I feel like conservatives have been shockingly consistent in favor of violations of the Fourth Amendment and what I mean by that is when the Obama administration when the NSA under the Obama administration was caught indiscriminately spying on Americans and collecting all this metadata on us conservatives seem to defend it a little bit or at least they were quiet they weren't as critical of him conservatism conservatives claim they believe in small government but they really don't they believe a very big government they what they fundamentally believe is who's being targeted by the you know by the violence of big government yeah and as long as the right people are being targeted they're finally yeah we all saw the wire yeah we thought so yeah and but look take credit to Chief Justice John Roberts for what I believe actually sticking to true conservative principles rather than the ones that Nando is talking about we're like well as long as you're doing it to the yeah it's not really how
