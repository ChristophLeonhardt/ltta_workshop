1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,104


2
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:20,240
This is Mom's video diary.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,910
Hey, man.

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,590
It's too dirty.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,738
Say Tuesday, June 22, 2010.

6
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:28,238
Hi.

7
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:31,591


8
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:35,560
This is -- do I
say "this is who"?

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,138
You can do whatever you want.

10
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:40,010


11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,140
This is Pam White.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:48,970


13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,754
Should I start?

14
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:52,050
Yeah, whenever you want.

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,570
O.K. Hello.

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,180
I am Pam White.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,115
I am a mother of three children.

18
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:03,740


19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,250
I will tell you a
little bit about me.

20
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,490
I grew up in a hotel.

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,550
My father owned the hotel.

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,130
And it was an unusual
way to grow up,

23
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,570
but it was a lovely
way to grow up.

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,800
I was an actress.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,620
I did modeling.

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,820


27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,450
I live for my family
and my children.

28
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:46,750
And one little glitch is that
I have developed Alzheimer's.

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,420
And initially, I was quite
distressed and upset about it.

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,890
But it doesn't really matter.

31
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,310
It doesn't really
change anything.

32
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,380
So I don't feel sad,
and I don't feel regret.

33
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,560
I feel blessed that I have this
wonderful family, and a husband

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,760
who is extraordinarily
wonderful.

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:22,460


36
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,430
Good morning.

37
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,930
Hi.

38
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,040
Can I get you up?

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,410
Why?

40
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,007
Because I'm sure you'd
like to have breakfast.

41
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:35,971


42
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,462
Be right there.

43
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:45,430


44
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,194
Can you tell me the story
of when you proposed to Mom?

45
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:53,390
My senior year in college,
the Vietnam War was raging.

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,960
A lottery was done, and
draft numbers were drawn.

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,030
My number was 16, which meant
it was 100 percent sure that I

48
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,030
would have been drafted.

49
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,110


50
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,090
My great-grandfather, my
grandfather, my father

51
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,800
were all in the
United States Navy.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,430
So I applied to
naval officer school.

53
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,080
All the while, I
had been planning

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,850
on asking your mom to marry me.

55
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:30,890


56
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,460
She is capable of doing less
and less around the house.

57
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,110
I probably talked to a woman
from the Alzheimer's Society

58
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,210
two, maybe three times.

59
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,690
They think it's important
I should somehow

60
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,042
remain more of a husband by
having a caregiver get her

61
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,500
up in the morning,
get her dressed,

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,920
bathe her, give her
medicine, make her meals.

63
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,620
Maybe.

64
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,444
So far, so good.

65
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,360
I don't mind doing it.

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,276
I like being with her.

67
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:10,070


68
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,400
Do you think that you
getting more confused

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,530
has been hard for Dad?

70
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,089


71
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,130
I don't think he
thinks I'm confused.

72
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,013
In that way.

73
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:25,512
Hmm?

74
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:30,720
I said I don't think he feels
that he is, or feels that I am.

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,350
Confused.

76
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,370
I'm not confused.

77
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,690
You think I'm confused?

78
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,640
No, maybe that's a bad word.

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,301
But you need help
with things that you

80
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,550
didn't used to need help with.

81
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,174
Right.

82
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:40,435
Yeah.

83
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:41,810
Do you think that's
hard for him?

84
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:57,210


85
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,480
Did you notice a change
with Mom from the last trip?

86
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,120
No, the change in the
year has been profound.

87
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:15,620


88
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,330
Watching the person
that you love

89
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:30,890
so much, who has been so much
a part of your life, you know.

90
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,960
It's nice she smiles
when she sees me.

91
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,370
Thank God for her smile.

92
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,710
That's huge.

93
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,730
But there's a lot more that, you
know, I used to get from her,

94
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,882
that she would do
for me, that's gone.

95
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:57,180


96
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,250
My nickname is Fast
Eddie, and it's

97
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,820
because I tend to just get
things done in a hurry.

98
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,990
And Pam's favorite
question is, where's Ed?

99
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,090
And I can answer
it 100 times a day.

100
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,576


101
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:14,950
Just getting her
out of the house

102
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,020
and into the car to go
shopping is a big deal.

103
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,060
And her walk is now a
shuffle, not a walk.

104
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,970
So it's just slow, slow, slow.

105
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,120
And don't ever let her
know that you're impatient,

106
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,660
which I'm sure there
are several times a week

107
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,500
when she knows that
I'm impatient with her.

108
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,660
And she knows it.

109
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,192
You can -- you
know she knows it.

110
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:40,150
And of course, I feel
terrible when it happens.

111
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:49,880


112
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,380
Yeah.

113
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,530
Sometimes, if I'm the first
thing she sees in the morning,

114
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,930
I don't actually think
she recognizes me.

115
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,208
That's beginning.

116
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:08,670


117
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,030
What must it be like?

118
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,830
How much does Pam know
about what's happened,

119
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,060
what's happening and
what will happen to her?

120
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,030


121
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,920
Every time I see her,
I hope I hug her.

122
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,260
Every time I see her,
I tell her I love her.

123
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,480
I tell her how
magnificent her smile is.

124
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,510
I tell her what a great
life we've had together.

125
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,400
And I thank her for
what she's done for me.

126
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,550
She was an incredibly
attentive, loving mother.

127
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,400


128
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,760
I know she'd love
to be that person.

129
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,390
I know that.

130
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:52,130


131
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,070
I have made a commitment
to this beautiful woman

132
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,170
that I will live
with her forever.

133
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:05,730
So whatever happens, we're
definitely doing it together.

134
00:08:05,730 --> 00:00:00,000
