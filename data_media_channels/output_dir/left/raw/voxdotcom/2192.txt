1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
For some of you, the book that I’m holding may invoke some feelings of nostalgia.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,800
But, for others, maybe some feelings of inadequacy.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,840
These are Magic Eye stereograms.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,520
They created a sensation when they came out in the 90s, and it’s easy to see why —

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,220
a 2D picture that creates a 3D image, if you do a certain thing with your eyeballs!?

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,620
ELAINE: Look there’s a space ship.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,830
That is so cool!

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,830
MR. PITTS: WHERE IS IT!?

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,220
I feel like I didn’t realize back then how neat these are.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,220
But I do now,

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,420
so let’s talk about it.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,039
Stereograms can be designed to be viewed cross-eyed
but all the ones in this video are for

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,479
divergent viewing.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,980
That means that rather than having your eyes
pointed at the image itself, you’re supposed

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,660
to over diverge your eyes, as if you’re
looking through the image at something beyond it.

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,539
It’s tricky because normally the lens in
our eyes focuses on the thing our eyes are

17
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,819
pointed at, but for these, you need to focus
on the image while pointing your eyes at a

18
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,279
spot beyond it.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,820
Some stereogram books come with a handy guide — these two dots at the top should help position

20
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,170
your eyes.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,039
You want to relax your eyes until you see
double vision, so 4 dots, but then pull it

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,460
back so that they overlap and you get 3 dots.

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,360
Then glance down and you should see the cathedral
of Saint Basil in Moscow.

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,960
If you still can’t see them, there’s a
trick you can do in Photoshop.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,780
Duplicate the image and use the “difference”
blending mode — which highlights where the

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,430
two images are the same — in black.

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,810
Then if you pull the top copy across...

28
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,270
A silhouette of the hidden image appears.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,740
I’ll explain how all this works, but first,
it helps to understand how Magic Eye emerged

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,040
from a long history of research on visual
perception

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,220
So, our pupils are about 60mm apart — that
means each eye gets a slightly different picture

32
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,300
projected onto its retina.

33
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,659
WAYNE: Camera 1.

34
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,320
Camera 2.

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Camera 1.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,080
Camera 2.

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,979
The reason we don’t have constant double
vision from these two different pictures is

38
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,919
that the brain immediately combines them into one.

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,340
And in doing so, it uses the differences in
the 2 pictures to add depth to

40
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,160
our visual perception.

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,690
This is stereopsis, or 3D vision,
and it was first described by an English inventor

42
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,800
in the 1830s, Charles Wheatstone.

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,400
It took scientists a while to realize that
having two eyes gives us depth information,

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,460
because it’s not the only depth cue that we have.

45
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,370
Shut one eye and it’s probably tough to
thread a needle but the world doesn’t become

46
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,230
completely flat.

47
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,620
Wheatstone revealed stereopsis with a device
that could display a slightly different image

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,620
to each eye, simulating how each eye would
take in a real life 3D object,

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,360
but with flat images.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,700
And it successfully tricked the brain into
perceiving depth.

51
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,760
This was the first stereoscope.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,940
After the invention of photography, a Scottish
physicist named David Brewster developed a

53
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,780
handheld stereoscope and a version of it was
displayed at the Great Exhibition in London

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,180
in 1851.

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,380
Queen Victoria was reportedly delighted by
it and before long it was a super common household

56
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,090
item through the last half of the 19th century.

57
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,860
The dual photos were made with stereo cameras,
which have two lenses spaced eye-distance

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,940
apart, and they were used to document all
sorts of historical events.

59
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,000
Stereo cameras eventually went out of style
but you might recognize this more modern version

60
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,700
of a stereoscope.

61
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,120
And that same principle of creating a 3D image
by showing each eye a slightly different picture

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,690
continues with 3D glasses and virtual reality
headsets.

63
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,530
But it’s not all for amusement.

64
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,260
Stereoscopy has also been used for all sorts of aerial imaging applications.

65
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,620
British photo interpreters in World War 2
used overlapping images taken from airplanes

66
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,340
to detect Nazi military assets.

67
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,030
This ability of stereoscopes to thwart camouflage
by making objects pop out of seemingly flat

68
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,280
aerial images inspired the development of
the random dot stereogram — that’s the kind

69
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,010
with a hidden 3D image.

70
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,330
In 1960, a leading vision researcher named Bela Julesz

71
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,840
created a computer-generated random-dot stereogram.

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,140
He started with a grid of random dots and

73
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,080
duplicated it, but in the copy, he shifted
a square patch of the dots slightly to the left,

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,180
filling in the leftover space with
other random dots.

75
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,560
If you look at these images through a stereoscope, or if you’ve trained your eyes enough to

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,920
free-fuse the images by pointing one eye
at each one, you’ll see the square pop out

77
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,710
from the random dots.

78
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,310
With this experiment, Julesz showed that the
brain could detect depth even without any

79
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,260
recognizable objects in the images.

80
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,380
What’s different about the Magic Eye-type
of pictures, also known as “autostereograms”

81
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,040
is that you don’t need any special device
to view them because

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,200
it’s one image instead of two.

83
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,820
Instead of two different pictures, autostereograms
repeat the images within one picture.

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,230
To understand how these work, let’s first
look at a simpler type of autostereogram.

85
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,500
This is a so-called “wallpaper stereogram.”

86
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,080
It doesn’t have a hidden image.

87
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,980
Instead, it just has repeating patterns that
appear at different levels of depth when you

88
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,840
diverge your eyes.

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,860
So relax your eyes as though you’re looking
through the screen and you should see the

90
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,510
airplanes fall back with the rest of the grid.

91
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,020
The dinosaurs, which are repeated at slightly closer intervals, should appear in a plane

92
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,780
nearer to you and the cakes, repeated at even shorter intervals, should be even nearer.

93
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,960
You should also see one more of each icon
than there really is — there are only 6 cakes

94
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,460
in the image but you’re seeing 7.

95
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,940
And all of the icons should appear to be slightly bigger than they really are.

96
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,480
So why is this happening?

97
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,380
This diagram shows the view from above your
head and these dots represent icons on a simple

98
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,170
autostereogram like the one i just showed
you.

99
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,620
When you let your eyes diverge, instead of
fixing them on one of the icons, each eye

100
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,660
is seeing its own icon.

101
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,220
Because your brain is used to turning two
similar pictures into one — it assumes the

102
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,260
two icons are actually one icon that’s further back and larger, rather than

103
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,260
two that are closer.

104
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,780
This illusion happens across the image, with
every pair of repeated icons being wrongly

105
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,750
interpreted as one.

106
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,640
The right-most and left-most icons don't have pairs on their other side so you end up with 7 —

107
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,280
5 illusory icons plus the edge ones.

108
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,480
Pairs that are repeated at closer intervals,
like the cakes were in the previous image,

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,160
appear nearer to you.

110
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,330
So it’s the interval of repetition that
can be manipulated to adjust depth.

111
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,061
And if we go from icons to something smaller,
you can start to see how they build a 3D image

112
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:30,900
that can be easily camouflaged with noise.

113
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,930
You can see that in this stereogram we made
using letters instead of icons.

114
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,370
If you diverge your eyes, you should see some
of these words pop out to reveal a message.

115
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,770
The two asterisks are there as a guide — you should see 3 of them, and then slowly bring

116
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,400
your eyes down.

117
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,320
What’s happening is that the regular repetition interval in this image is 16 characters, including spaces.

118
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,860
But in this interval, we removed a letter,
bringing this pair slightly closer together

119
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,389
than all the other pairs.

120
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:03,330
So as your brain fuses that pair, the
resulting image appears closer to you than

121
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,460
the rest.

122
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,199
Autosterograms start with a base pattern that repeats across the image but with select dots

123
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,150
or pixels shifted to vary the depth and compose the 3D figure.

124
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,550
The first random-dot autostereograms were
made by hand in the 1970s.

125
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,800
This one by a Japanese graphic designer shows
an array of hidden squares and this one by

126
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,510
a Swiss painter has overlapping rectangles.

127
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,419
But by the 1980s, vision researcher Christopher
Tyler and programmer Maureen Clark had come

128
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:36,710
up with an algorithm that could embed more
complicated depth images into a random-dot

129
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,570
autostereogram.

130
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,640
Using the red dots as a guide, you should
see a 3D surface pop out that’s much more

131
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,920
complicated than a wallpaper or a simple rectangle.

132
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,670
The algorithms that produce these images work from a depth map — that's a black and white image

133
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,070
that tells the program to make the repetition interval shorter for the dots that make

134
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,370
up the lighter, and nearer, parts of the image.

135
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,300
In the final product you can’t tell which
dots have been shifted or how much,

136
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,440
but if you go back to that Photoshop trick
and scan through the image — you can see how

137
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,700
the nearest parts of the shark repeat at closer intervals

138
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,140
than the most distant parts of the shark.

139
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,760
Everything in the base image repeats at the
same interval,

140
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,940
except the dots that make up the shark.

141
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,460
In the 90s, artist Cheri Smith and engineer
Tom Baccei developed their own method,

142
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,660
using bright colorful patterns as their base.

143
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,569
They branded them as “Magic Eye” and published
the first of many books in 1993.

144
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,320
After that, they were everywhere.

145
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,000
“Hey can you see it?

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,360
You gotta see it.

147
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,380
You really gotta see it, come on give it a
try”

148
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,520
Magic Eye put out VHS tapes that included
animated stereograms; they sold posters;

149
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,740
they were printed in newspapers.

150
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,960
And some people...got left behind.

151
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,020
“I’ve been staring at this thing for a
week now, from opening to closing,

152
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,740
and I can't see a gooddamn thing!”

153
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,040
If you can’t see them, it may be that you

154
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,110
have some visual impairment that affects your
stereo vision.

155
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,080
But for most of us, learning to diverge your
eyes just takes a little bit of practice.

156
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,940
“Today’s my day.

157
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,820
I brought a lunch and a soda...
and I’m not going to leave until I see this

158
00:09:05,830 --> 00:00:00,000
sailboat everyone keeps talking about.”
