THERE IS AN IMAGE FLOATING
AROUND THE HAS KIND OF COME TO
DEFINE PEOPLE LEARNING ABOUT
THE HOUSTON HURRICANE,
HURRICANE HARVEY.
THIS IS A PHOTO YOU MAY HAVE
SEEN.
IT IS PEOPLE AT AN ASSISTED
LIVING CENTER.
IN CASE YOU CAN'T SEE IT THERE,
THERE IS WATER COVERING
EVERYTHING.
THERE ARE SENIOR CITIZENS SITTING IN
WATER.
IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW I CAME
TO BE, WHAT IT IS.
IT
IS A SENIOR CENTER RUN
BY TIMOTHY MCINTOSH'S MOTHER.
HE RECEIVED THAT PHOTO FROM
HER AND THEN DIDN'T HEAR
ANYTHING FROM HER AFTER THAT
ACCORDING TO TIME MAGAZINE.
FOLLOWING THAT, HE TWEETED IT
AND THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE WHO RETWEETED IT AND
WITHIN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT
OF TIME THANKFULLY, FOLKS CAME
TO THE AID ACCORDING TO THE
REPORT IN TIME.
THE MACINTOSH'S REACHED OUT TO
TELL PEOPLE THEY WERE GRATEFUL
FOR THE SHOW OF SUPPORT, SAYING:
VERY TOUCHING STORY.
I OFTENTIMES COMPLAIN ABOUT
HOW TERRIBLE TWITTER IS AND HOW
DETRIMENTAL SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BE,
BUT HERE IS ONE OF THE FEW CASES
WHERE IT LITERALLY SAVED LIVES.
LOOKING AT THAT PHOTO, IF YOU
REALLY FOCUS ON EVERY SINGLE
PERSON FOR A MINUTE IN THAT
PHOTO IT IS KIND OF AMAZING
BECAUSE IT ALMOST SEEMS AS
THOUGH THEY ARE JUST LIVING
THEIR LIVES AND THEY ARE NOT
SUBMERGED IN WATER, ALMOST
COMPLETELY SUBMERGED.
I AM SO HAPPY THAT PEOPLE
STEPPED UP AND DID
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
I'M GLAD THAT THE PHOTO WENT
VIRAL AND NO ONE DIED AS A
RESULT OF THAT FLOOD IN THAT
ASSISTED LIVING CENTER.
IT IS JUST TERRIFYING TO ME TO
THINK OF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO
MIGHT BE IN THAT CONDITION AND
MIGHT NOT GET THE HELP THAT
THEY NEED TO SURVIVE.
LOOK, WE DO COMMENTARY ON THE
STORY SO I'M GOING TO.
I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN.
IT IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT
POLITICAL.
THE ISSUE IS GOVERNMENT.
BECAUSE OF THEIR TALKING
POINTS FROM THE RIGHT THAT
GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS BAD.
BIG GOVERNMENT IS BAD BY
DEFINITION.
MY COUNTER TO THAT IS, DOESN'T IT
DEPEND?
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING?
IF AMERICA IS INVADING
A COUNTRY THAT DIDN'T INVADE US,
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S TERRIBLE.
OR GETTING INSIDE OUR
UTERUS, TERRIBLE.
SHOULDN'T GET BETWEEN US AND OUR
DOCTOR.
SOMETIMES CONSERVATIVES DON'T
AGREE WITH THAT.
BUT IF IT IS GOING TO THE
RESCUE OF THESE POOR WOMEN AND
OTHER PEOPLE IN THAT ASSISTED
LIVING CENTER, IT IS WONDERFUL.
IT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THAT
PROVES THAT GOVERNMENT IS
GREAT ON EVERYTHING.
NO, WE ARE NOT AS
BLACK-AND-WHITE AS THE
RIGHT WING.
WE ARE NOT AS SIMPLISTIC AS THE
RIGHT WING.
IT DEPENDS.
SOMETIMES GOVERNMENT DOES
WONDERFUL THINGS.
SOMETIMES IT DOES HORRIFIC
THINGS.
LET'S USE OUR MIND AND JUDGMENT
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH IS
WHICH IF WE HAD HAD MORE
GOVERNMENT ACTION, MAYBE WE
WOULDN'T HAVE AS MUCH CLIMATE
CHANGE AND THE STORMS WOULD
NOT OF BEEN A SEVERE AND THEY
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THIS
MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
IF WE FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME OF
THE REGULATIONS THAT OBAMA
PUT INTO PLACE TO PREVENT
FURTHER FLOODING IN CITIES
LIKE HOUSTON, MAYBE THE FLOODING
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS BAD.
AND CERTAINLY I HOPE WE CAN ALL
AGREE THAT RESCUING PEOPLE IN
NEED IS A CORE GOVERNMENT JOB.
LOOK, ON THE OTHER HAND FOR
DEMOCRATS WHO SOMETIMES
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AND GO
GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS GREAT.
NO.
WHEN THE POLITICIANS ARE LEGALLY
BRIBED BY THEIR DONORS, IT
IS NOT GREAT.
LET'S USE OUR MINDS ENTER
JUDGMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW
MUCH GOVERNMENT WE NEED AND
IN THIS CASE, THANK GOD
SOMEBODY SHOWED UP.
THESE ARE THE WEIRDEST
FEELINGS TO GO THROUGH
BECAUSE YOU SEE SUCH DEVASTATION
ACROSS THE BOARD.
HOUSTON IS Ã±
THAT IS WHAT MY GREATEST FEARS.
FLAT SPACE IN A FLOOD.
HOUSTON IS A FLOOD PRONE
DISTRICT.
BAYOUS, DITCHES.
ONE OF OUR EDITORS IS FROM
HOUSTON AND SHOWED ME A
PHOTO OF A GIANT FREEWAY THAT
LOOKS LIKE A RIVER.
IT WAS LIKE A RIVER BECAUSE
THERE WAS A LITTLE BRIDGE
ABOUT THIS HIGH OVER THE WATER
TO LOOK LIKE YOU COULD TAKE
A NICE LITTLE WALK.
NO, THAT'S A FREEWAY IN THE
BRIDGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
TALL ENOUGH SEE YOU CAN DRIVE A
SEMI TRUCK UNDERNEATH IT.
IT IS TERRIFYING.
AND THEN YOU SEE THESE
GRANDPARENTS WHO ARE IN AN
ASSISTED LIVING CENTER THAT
THEY THEMSELVES NEED ASSISTANCE.
IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THAT THEY
GOT OUT OF THERE BUT THAT
IS A NIGHTMARE TO ME.
I WANTED TO MAKE THIS POINT
WHEN WE DID THE ORIGINAL
STORY ABOUT THE HURRICANE, BUT I
DID NOT GET AN OPPORTUNITY
SO I WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT
NOW.
THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE OF HOW
INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT IN
THE HOUSTON AREA.
THERE IS THIS GREAT WRITER FOR
THE HOUSTON CHRONICLE.
HIS NAME ESCAPES ME AT THE
MOMENT BUT HE TALKED ABOUT HOW
RIGHT NOW THERE IS
OVERDEVELOPMENT IN THE HOUSTON
AREA WHICH IS FLOOD PRONE.
THAT
UNFORTUNATELY MAKES FLOODS WORSE
AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE
THERE ARE GRASSY AREAS,
PRAIRIES, THINGS LIKE THAT THAT
ARE BETTER AT ABSORBING THE
WATER AND NOW, THERE IS SO MUCH
OVERDEVELOPMENT, PEOPLE ARE
BUILDING CONCRETE OVER AND
OBVIOUSLY, CONCRETE DOESN'T
ABSORB THE WATER.
IT MAKES THE FLOODING WORSE AND
SO INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING
THAT, THERE ARE LAWMAKERS IN
THE STATE THAT CONTINUE TO
DEREGULATE CERTAIN ZONING LAWS
THAT LEAD TO THIS KIND OF
SITUATION GETTING WORSE AND
SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT
EVERYONE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND.
CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXASPERATING
THE ISSUE.
ABSOLUTELY.
THE UNWILLINGNESS TO BUILD
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COULD
WITHSTAND THIS TYPE OF FLOODING
IS A PROBLEM AND THEN THIS
TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT
ACTUALLY MAKES THE FLOODING
WORSE IS A PROBLEM.
I REMEMBER WHEN INCONVENIENT
TRUTH CAME OUT A DECADE AGO
AND THEY SHOULD THE POSSIBILITY
THAT SOME MAJOR AMERICAN
CITIES WOULD BE UNDERWATER AND
CONSERVATIVES LAUGHED.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS, THEY ARE NOT
GOING TO BE UNDERWATER.
AL GORE, YOU ARE NUTS.
ONE OF THEM WAS PARTICULARLY
ABOUT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.
IN AN INCONVENIENT SEQUAL
THE SHOWED THE MEMORIAL
WAS UNDERWATER.
NOW HOUSTON IS UNDERWATER.
IT
HAS HAPPENED TIME AND TIME
AGAIN, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA
THERE WAS THE BIGGEST FLOOD
THEY HAD EVER SEEN LAST YEAR.
THIS IS NOW BEING CALLED A 500
YEAR FLOOD.
I'M BEGINNING TO
THINK IT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY
500 YEARS, IT HAPPENS OFTEN
AND REPEATEDLY BECAUSE THE
STORMS ARE GETTING WORSE BECAUSE
OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
IT TURNS OUT THE SCIENTISTS WERE
RIGHT ALL ALONG.
BIG SURPRISE.
