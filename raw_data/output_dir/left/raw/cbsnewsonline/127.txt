1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,104
THEY ARE A THREAT TO THE 

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,405
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY BECAUSE OF 

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,973
CYBER ATTACKS, THE JUSTICE 

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,007
DEPARTMENT ISSUES THESE 

5
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:08,775
INDICTMENTS AGAINST 12 

6
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,976
INDIVIDUALS, WHICH AS WE HAVE 

7
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,544
DELVED INTO IT REALIZED THIS 

8
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,646
WAS A WAY OF THE AMERICAN LAW 

9
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,081
ENFORCEMENT, THE JUSTICE 

10
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,049
DEPARTMENT SAYING AND THE 

11
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,651
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SAYING WE 

12
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:18,851
KNOW. 

13
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:20,486
WE KNOW WHO YOUR PEOPLE ARE. 

14
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:21,721
WE KNOW WHO YOUR AGENTS ARE, 

15
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,190
AND HERE BY THE WAY IS THE 

16
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,258
INDICTMENT WHICH SHOWS JUST 

17
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,793
EXACTLY HOW THEY DID THIS. 

18
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,194
ARE THERE PEOPLE NOW INSIDE THE 

19
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,129
RUSSIAN GOVERNMET WHO ARE 

20
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,932
SAYING WE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. 

21
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,134
>> OH, YES, AND THE RUSSIANS 

22
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:38,271
MAY HAVE A WITCH HUNT OF THEIR 

23
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,240
OWN, LOOKING DEEP INTO THE 

24
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,907
INTELLIGENCE ESTABLISHMENT, WHO 

25
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,242
THE MOLES ARE, WHO MAY HAVE 

26
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,910
BEEN FLIPPED BY THE U.S. 

27
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,610
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 

28
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,147
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT 

29
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,414
CYBER EXPERTS FEEL THE RUSSIANS 

30
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:49,682
PROBABLY HIRED HACKING GROUPS 

31
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,385
TO WORK FOR THEM. 

32
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,686
AND THEY MAY HAVE LIMITED 

33
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,389
CONTROL OVER THEM. 

34
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,558
IT MAY BE THOSE CYBER 

35
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,959
ANARCHISTS, IF YOU LIKE WHO ARE 

36
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,828
FEEDING INFORMATION NOW TO THE 

37
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:02,762
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S 

38
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,497
GOT TO HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN 

39
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,464
VERY WORRIED. 

40
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:07,833
>> ALL RIGHT. 

41
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,102
LIZ PALMER, THANK YOU, AND 

42
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,135
MARGARET BRENNAN JOINS US. 

43
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:11,471
SHE IS IN NEW YORK. 

44
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,041
MARGARET, TALK ABOUT WHO WAS AT 

45
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,442
THIS EXPANDED LUNCHTIME 

46
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:17,777
MEETING, SPECIFICALLY FIONA 

47
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:18,010
HILL. 

48
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,978
>> YES, YOU HIGHLIGHTED HER, 

49
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,213
SHE IS SO REMARKABLE BECAUSE 

50
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,182
SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL 

51
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,184
SECURITY STAFF WHO HAS BEEN NOT 

52
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,351
VERY PROMINENT BUT VERY WELL 

53
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,187
KNOWN AND IT WAS REMARKABLE 

54
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,555
WHEN SHE JOINED THE TRUMP 

55
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,522
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE SHE 

56
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,292
LITERALLY WROTE THE BOOK ON 

57
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,025
VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

58
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,995
SHE IS ONE OF HIS BIOGRAPHERS, 

59
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,765
A FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 

60
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,400
A DUAL U.S., UK NATIONAL, SHE 

61
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,701
IS EXTREMELY CLEAR EYED ON 

62
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,770
THIS, AND HAS WRITTEN LEADING 

63
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,904
UP TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

64
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,506
ELECTIONS ABOUT WHY VLADIMIR 

65
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,642
PUTIN WOULD WANT TO AND SEEK 

66
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,344
OUT MEDDLING IN THE U.S. 

67
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,278
ELECTIONS, IT WAS AN 

68
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,080
ESTABLISHED FACT AND PART OF A 

69
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,347
STRATEGY. 

70
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,182
SHE WAS SEATED AT THAT TABLE, 

71
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,851
ALONG WITH JOHN BOLTON, THE 

72
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,719
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO 

73
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,222
THE PRESIDENT, SOMEONE WHO IS 

74
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,089
DEEPLY STEEPED, WHATEVER YOUR 

75
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,023
POLITICAL BELIEFS BUT HE'S 

76
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,558
EXPERIENCED ON ARMS CONTROL 

77
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,759
NEGOTIATIONS, AND EXPERIENCED 

78
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,362
IN NEGOTIATING WITH VLADIMIR 

79
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:09,628
PUTIN. 

80
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:10,997
HE KNOWS AS DOES FIONA HILL WHO 

81
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,131
THEY ARE SITTING ACROSS FROM 

82
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,833
AND EXACTLY THE GAMES THAT ARE 

83
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,166
BEING PLAYED. 

84
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:20,974
FOR ALL THE CRITICISM OF HOW 

85
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,343
THE PRESIDENT, WHEN IT COMES TO 

86
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,343
DIPLOMACY, HE HAS ESTABLISHED 

87
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:25,144
NATIONAL SECURITY NAMES. 

88
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,412
THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS NEW, 

89
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,547
BUT ACROSS FROM THEM, YOU'RE 

90
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,082
LOOKING AT THE SHOT NOW ON THE 

91
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,617
RUSSIAN SIDE OF THE ROOM AT THE 

92
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:38,091
FAR END OF THE TABLE IS A MAN 

93
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,292
CALLED ANATOLI THE RUSSIAN 

94
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,860
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED 

95
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,628
STATES, A VERY DELIBERATE 

96
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:42,862
CHOICE. 

97
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,763
THE EXPECTATION IS MANY THOUGHT 

98
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,832
HE WAS PUT IN D. C. TO BE A 

99
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,668
HARD LINER AGAINST A HILLARY 

100
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,303
CLINTON PRESIDENCY. 

101
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,906
HE IS SOMEONE WHO HAD 

102
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:54,206
NEGOTIATED. 

103
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,275
HE'S THERE NEXT TO SERGEY 

104
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,743
LAVROV, A LITTLE BIT OBSCURED 

105
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,611
THERE, AS SOMEONE WHO HAD 

106
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,980
NEGOTIATED THE NEW START DEAL. 

107
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,348
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TALKING 

108
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,651
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY 

109
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,352
PERHAPS EXTENDING, THAT WAS A 

110
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,553
REDUCTION IN BALLISTIC MISSILES 

111
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,622
AND NUCLEAR WARHEADS, AND THAT 

112
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,191
WAS A BIG WIN UNDER THE OBAMA 

113
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:12,558
ADMINISTRATION. 

114
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,693
THE QUESTION NOW IS WILL THE 

115
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:18,063
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DO SO? 

116
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,131
LAST I SPOKE WITH AMBASSADOR 

117
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:21,534
ANTONOV, HE COMPLAINED HE COULD 

118
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,135
NOT GET A MEETING IN 

119
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,871
WASHINGTON, D.C. THESE DAYS 

120
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,240
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A POLITICALLY 

121
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,974
TOXIC TOPIC. 

122
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:30,176
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ARE 

123
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,778
PUTTING A DOMESTIC FILTER ON 

124
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,246
THIS BECAUSE FOREIGN POLICY IS 

125
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,449
SO MUCH OF HOW WE ARE HEARING 

126
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,083
THIS NARRATIVE. 

127
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,086
>> QUESTION ON THAT POINT, 

128
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,021
FIRST OF ALL, SERGEY LAVROV, 

129
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,624
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER TO 

130
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,491
PRESIDENT PUTIN'S RITE. 

131
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,327
YOU TALKED TO TREY GOWDY ON 

132
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,093
FACE THE NATION. 

133
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,429
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESSURE 

134
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,097
ON THE PRESIDENT TO EITHER A, 

135
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,199
SAY SOMETHING TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 

136
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,034
ABOUT INTERFERING AND THE 

137
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,636
ONGOING INTERFERENCE BY THE 

138
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,171
RUSSIANS OR TO ACTUALLY DO 

139
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,339
SOMETHING, TREY GOWDY WAS STARK 

140
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,773
AS A MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

141
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,408
PARTY AS TO WHAT HE THINKS THE 

142
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:02,908
PRESIDENT SHOULD DO. 

143
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,377
>> THE CONGRESSMAN FROM SOUTH 

144
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,345
CAROLINA WHO HELD THAT FIERY, 

145
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,380
YOU KNOW, HEARING EARLIER IN 

146
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,681
THE WEEK WITH PETER STRZOK, 

147
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,249
THAT FBI AGENT WHO'S BEEN 

148
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,184
ACCUSED OF HAVING POLITICAL 

149
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,119
BIAS, WHICH IS WHY HE WAS TAKEN 

150
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,188
OFF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, 

151
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,089
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR TREY 

152
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,690
GOWDY AS A CONGRESSMAN, AS A 

153
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,793
REPUBLICAN, DRAW THE LINE THAT 

154
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,497
WE OFTEN HEAR THE PRESIDENT 

155
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,165
SORT OF MUDDY HERE, WHICH IS TO 

156
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,533
SAY YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THE 

157
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:27,800
MEDDLING. 

158
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,470
YOU CAN CALL THIS AN ASSAULT ON 

159
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,739
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, AND 

160
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,340
RECOGNIZE IT FOR WHAT IT IS, 

161
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,541
AND AT THE SAME TIME 

162
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,743
ACKNOWLEDGE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

163
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:41,881
THE VALIDITY OF HIS ELECTION. 

164
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:51,023
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONFLATE THE 

165
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:51,223
TWO. 

166
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:51,924
THE PRESIDENT CONFLATES THESE 

167
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,593
THINGS IN PART BECAUSE HE TAKES 

168
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,695
IT SO PERSONALLY. 

169
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,064
THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY A A FACT 

170
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,932
PATTERNESTABLISHED BY U.S. 

171
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,167
INTELLIGENCE, BY THE FBI, OUR 

172
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,701
ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. 

173
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,237
IT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER HE 

174
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,738
IS LEGITIMATE IN THIS JOB, AND 

175
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,173
HE CAN'T SEPARATE THE TWO 

176
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:07,406
IDEAS. 

177
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,876
WHEN WE BRING UP THE IDEA, WILL 

178
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,677
HE CONFRONT HIM ON MEDDLING, 

179
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:13,813
CAN HE TAKE HIMSELF OUT OF THAT 

180
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,081
EQUATION, AND IT MATTERS WHAT 

181
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,282
HAPPENED BEFORE I TOOK THE 

182
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,283
OFFICE, AND IT MATTERS WHAT 

183
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,885
HAPPENS WHEN YOU ATTACK THE 

184
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,918
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

185
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,287
>> CAN YOU ESTABLISH THE 

186
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,021
DISTINCTION THE TRUMP 

187
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:22,989
ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING, 

188
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,123
SAYING STOP CALLING THIS A 

189
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,624
SUMMIT, THIS IS JUST A MEETING. 

190
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:26,926
WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN 

191
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,260
THE TWO. 

192
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,128
IT MAKES ME THINK OF DATING, IF 

193
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,297
I'M MEETING YOU FOR COFFEE, NO 

194
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,865
BIG DEAL, IF I'M MEETING YOU 

195
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,634
FOR DINNER, THIS IS POTENTIAL. 

196
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,268
THIS IS A BIG DEAL, RIGHT. 

197
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:38,604
>> DEPENDING ON HOW IT GOES, WE 

198
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,673
CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CALL IT 

199
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:40,906
LATER. 

200
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:43,443
SOME OF THAT IS A REFLECTION 

201
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,913
THAT MANY OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

202
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,381
TEAM HAVE BEEN CAUTIONING 

203
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,282
AGAINST TAKING THE SUMMIT 

204
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,118
MEETING ENCOUNTER IN THE WAY HE 

205
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:52,318
HAS. 

206
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,886
WHILE THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE 

207
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,421
HAS LOW EXPECTATIONS, HE HAS 

208
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,589
DRAWN EVERY CAMERA INTO THE 

209
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,924
WORLD AT THIS MOMENT, AND WE 

210
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,326
ARE FOLLOWING IT AS IF IT'S A 

211
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:07,533
SPORTING EVENT, PLAY BY PLAYS, 

212
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,035
THAT'S NOT HOW DIPLOMACY 

213
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,335
HAPPENS. 

214
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,269
THE AMBASSADOR WAS TRYING TO 

215
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,238
HELP THE PRESIDENT THERE. 

216
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:14,707
>> AND THE REASON THEY CALL 

217
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,878
THEM SUMMITS IS BECAUSE THEY 

218
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,147
HAPPEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS, 

219
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,282
YOU CAN'T GET HIGHER THAN THE 

220
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,151
PRESIDENTS OF TWO COUNTRIES. 

221
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,118
LEADERS TEND TO RESPOND TO 

222
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,520
THOSE AND NOT WHAT ACTUALLY 

223
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,421
HAPPENS AND THAT CREATES 

224
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,823
SOMETHING THEY THEN HAVE TO 

225
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:31,524
RESPOND TO, WHICH IS OF 

226
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,358
SOMEBODY ELSE'S MAKING. 

227
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:37,897
THEY WANT TO CONTROL IT AS MUCH 

228
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,296
AS POSSIBLE. 

229
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:39,265
EXPECTATIONS ARE TARGETS THEY 

230
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,468
HAVE TO MEET THAT OTHER PEOPLE 

231
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,168
ARE CREATING. 

232
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,637
>> THEIR OWN CONSTRAINTS AND IN 

233
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,072
SO MANY WAYS, WE ARE PARSING 

234
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,040
EVERY WORD SAID AT THIS PRESS 

235
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,340
CONFERENCE. 

236
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,075
FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 

237
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,510
PERSPECTIVE AND BECAUSE OF THE 

238
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,711
DOMESTIC POLITICAL FILTER HERE, 

239
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,045
PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED WHAT THE 

240
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,046
OUTCOME OF THIS IS. 

241
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,782
PEOPLE ARE WALKING IN, IF YOU 

242
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,417
ARE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU HAVE 

243
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,219
DECIDED THAT HE IS DOING 

244
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:00,619
SOMETHING GREAT. 

245
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:01,721
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG GETTING 

246
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,554
ALONG WITH RUSSIA. 

247
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:04,857
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT OF 

248
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:05,858
DIPLOMACY, RIGHT, IT'S SUPPOSED 

249
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,127
TO BE FURTHERING THE INTERESTS 

250
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,595
OF YOUR COUNTRY, AND CAN HE 

251
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,397
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ANYTHING IN 

252
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:11,830
THE MEETING. 

253
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,965
IF YOU'RE A DETRACTOR OF THE 

254
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,101
PRESIDENT, YOU THINK HE SOLD US 

255
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,469
DOWN THE RIVER, THAT THERE WAS 

256
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:28,114
SOME SCHOOL BOARD OF  -- SOME 

257
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,551
KIND OF QUID PRO QUO HERE. 

258
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:36,455
>> CAN I MAKE A POINT ON THAT 

259
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,891
<u>ND SOMETHING LIZ TOUCHED ON AS </u>

260
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,560
WELL, HOW VULNERABLE IF AT ALL 

261
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,794
STREET MUST FEEL KNOWING THE 

262
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,195
DETAIL THAT PROSECUTORS HERE 

263
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:45,197
WERE ABLE TO NAIL DOWN AS FAR 

264
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:46,566
AS THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE GRU 

265
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,434
BECAUSE IF YOU GO BACK TO THE 

266
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,302
PRESIDENT'S LAST MEETING WITH 

267
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,670
VLADIMIR PUTIN WHERE HE SAID HE 

268
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,505
TOLD ME HE DIDN'T DO IT, AND I 

269
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,373
BELIEVE THAT HE BELIEVED IT, HE 

270
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,142
WENT ON TO SAY THAT PUTIN TOLD 

271
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,377
HIM I DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE NO 

272
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,212
ONE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO FIND 

273
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:02,514
OUT OR TRACE IT BACK TO ME. 

274
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:03,716
HOW VULNERABLE IS VLADIMIR 

275
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,817
PUTIN FEELING RIGHT NOW? 

276
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,820
DID HE THINK THIS DAY WAS 

277
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,120
INEVITABLE? 

278
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,522
BECAUSE THIS SEEMED TO COME 

279
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,792
FROM NOT ONLY U.S. INTELLIGENCE 

280
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,859
BUT BRITISH AS WELL. 

281
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,428
>> A NUMBER OF ALLIES HAVE BEEN 

282
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,262
HELPING WITH THIS. 

283
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,497
IT'S A FAIR POINT. 

284
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,966
DID THIS THIS RELEASE AND BOX 

285
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,267
IN THE PRESIDENT WITH THE 

286
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,702
MUELLER INDICTMENT BY FORCING 

287
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,270
THE ISSUE, DID IT ACTUALLY HELP 

288
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,271
HIM BECAUSE AS YOU'RE 

289
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:34,145
SUGGESTING THERE, SORT OF LAYS 

290
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:44,724
OUT 

291
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,693
>>>  TRUMP COULD USE THAT TO 

292
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,026
HIS BENEFIT. 

293
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:48,426
>> EXACTLY. 

294
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:51,864
>> IF YOU CALL IT A WITCH HUNT 

295
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,799
YOU ARE DISMISSING THE FACT 

296
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,135
THERE IS A DETERRENT TO OTHER 

297
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,536
COUNTRIES WHO MIGHT TRY TO DO 

298
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,571
SOMETHING SIMILAR AND MAYBE ARE 

299
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,874
DOING IT NOW AS THE DIRECTOR OF 

300
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,808
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SAYS IT'S 

301
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,309
HAPPENING. 

302
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,111
>> IT'S PUZZLING TO ME KNOWING 

303
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,646
THESE INDICTMENTS WERE COMING 

304
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,648
DOWN HE THOUGHT IT WAS A WITCH 

305
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:08,881
HUNT. 

306
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,315
>> THAT'S THE PERSONAL. 

307
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:12,584
HE FEELS HUNTED THERE. 

308
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,686
>> YES. 

309
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,921
LET'S GO BACK TO NORAH BECAUSE 

310
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:17,723
BEFORE THE SUMMIT STARTED THE 

311
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,059
PRESIDENT SAID LISTEN I HAVE 

312
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,227
LOW EXPECTATIONS HERE. 

313
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,495
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO 

314
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:22,795
OFFICIALS. 

315
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,829
WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU WAS 

316
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,833
THEIR HOPE THAT WOULD COME OUT 

317
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:34,273
OF THIS? 

318
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,707
WHAT WAS THEIR AGENDA? 

319
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:36,141
DID THEY HAVE ONE? 

320
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:36,742
>> THAT'S WHAT WAS INCREDIBLY 

321
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,175
REMARKABLE, GAYLE. 

322
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:37,776
SPEAKING WHEN ASKED WHAT THE 

323
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:38,878
AGENDA WAS THEY HAD TO SHRUG 

324
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,112
THEIR SHOULDERS BECAUSE THEY 

325
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,013
WEREN'T SURE SAYING IT WAS UP 

326
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,616
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

327
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,619
STATES AND THAT IS 

328
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:46,986
EXTRAORDINARY. 

329
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,688
THERE'S A LAUNDRY LIST OF ITEMS 

330
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,621
THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO THROUGH 

331
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,758
TO DISCUSS AT A MEETING OF THIS 

332
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:52,958
TIME. 

333
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,226
MARGARET JUST MADE A POINT TOO. 

334
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,029
ONE OF THE PHRASES THE DIRECTOR 

335
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,497
OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAN 

336
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,899
COATS USED EARLIER THIS WEEK IS 

337
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,568
HE SAID HE HAD A MESSAGE FOR 

338
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,769
PUTIN IF HE WERE MEETING WITH 

339
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,838
HIM WE KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING 

340
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,506
AND WE KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOU 

341
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,710
ARE DOING AND WHAT WE ARE 

342
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,943
DOING. 

343
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,811
YOU MAKE THE CHOICE BUT IF YOU 

344
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,013
WANT TO STAY IN THIS FOR TAT WE 

345
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,781
ARE GOING TO BEAT YOU. 

346
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,884
THERE'S A MESSAGE BEING SENT 

347
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,553
FROM THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE 

348
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:20,853
COMMUNITY. 

349
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,288
THERE'S A MESSAGE BEING SENT 

350
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,556
FROM THE U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,692
COMMUNITY AND IT WAS THE TIMING 

352
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,360
IS INCREDIBLY RELEVANT IT WAS 

353
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,262
DONE JUST DAYS BEFORE THIS 

354
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,197
PARTICULAR SUMMIT WHEN THE 

355
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,299
AGENCY PROCESS DID NOT TAKE 

356
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,101
PLACE THAT NORMALLY HAPPENS 

357
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,269
BEFORE ONE OF THESE MEETINGS 

358
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,903
WHERE MOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 

359
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,672
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE 

360
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:39,972
DISCUSSED.

363
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,077
CONVERSATIONS WITH OFFICIALS 

364
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,378
AND MAJOR JUST OUT OF JUST WHAT 

365
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:48,581
HAPPENED ARE YOU GETTING ANY

READ ABOUT WHETHER THEY AGREED 

367
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,019
TO ANYTHING? 

368
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,222
>> NO, NO READ AT ALL. 

369
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,023
AND THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS 

370
00:10:58,023 --> 00:10:59,225
ARE SORT OF TIMEY NOT ONLY 

371
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,825
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BUT WHAT'S 

372
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:01,994
GOING TO HAPPEN. 

373
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,396
WE ARE IN AN EXTENDED TWO 

374
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:05,531
MINUTE WARNING AND THIS MIGHT 

375
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,766
BE THE LONGEST TWO MINUTE 

376
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,735
WARNING I HAVE EVER BEEN APART 

377
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,735
OF IN PRESIDENTIAL COVERAGE. 

378
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:12,705
TO YOUR POINT YOU JUST MADE 

379
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,172
BECAUSE IT'S VITAL. 

380
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,209
I CAN TELL YOU SO MANY OF THE 

381
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,113
DIPLOMATS AND NATO MINISTERS 

382
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,247
WERE VITALLY INTERACTING AS 

383
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:22,982
ENERGETICALLY AS THEY COULD 

384
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,483
WITH U.S. OFFICIALS TO TRY TO 

385
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:30,289
FIND OUT IF THERE WAS A FIXED, 

386
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,592
SEMI FIXED, EMERGING AGENDA FOR 

387
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,193
THIS MEETING WITH VLADIMIR 

388
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:34,760
PUTIN AND THE ANSWER IS THE 

389
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,527
SAME YOU JUST REPORTED. 

390
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:36,996
NO THERE ISN'T AND THAT LEFT 

391
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:41,300
THEM IN A SENSE OF MILD PANIC 

392
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,271
BECAUSE THEIR FEAR WAS IF 

393
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:45,905
AMERICA'S AGENDA ISN'T SET AND 

394
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,439
EUROPE'S AGENDA ISN'T SET, THEY 

395
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,641
KNEW GOING IN, THE RUSSIAN 

396
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,544
AGENDA WOULD BE SET AND THEY 

397
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,778
WERE SOME WHAT FEARFUL THAT 

398
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,579
VLADIMIR PUTIN MIGHT BE ABLE TO 

399
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:55,948
TAKE ADVANTAGE, DRIVE HIS 

400
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,217
AGENDA HARDER WHEN THERE WAS NO 

401
00:11:59,217 --> 00:11:59,851
FIXED AMERICAN AGENDA GOING IN. 

402
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,521
AND TO THE POINT THAT YOU AND 

403
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,291
MARGARET HAVE JUST DESCRIBED 

404
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,595
ABOUT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL 

405
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:09,928
INDICTMENTS. 

406
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:10,496
THEY ARE VERY FORENSICALLY 

407
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,131
DETAILED AND THAT IS A SIGNAL 

408
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,534
TO RUSSIA AND TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 

409
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,067
THAT THE INSTITUTIONS IN 

410
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,169
AMERICA, WHATEVER PRESIDENT 

411
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,573
TRUMP SAYS ABOUT THE MEDDLING 

412
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,373
OR THE INVESTIGATION, THE 

413
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:25,444
INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA, THE 

414
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,379
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS PURSUING 

415
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:35,087
A FORENSIC EXPANSION OF WHAT 

416
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,021
HAPPENED AND REVEALING 

417
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:36,455
IMPORTANT DETAILS. 

418
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,022
AS YOU MENTION DIRECTOR OF 

419
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:37,490
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE 

420
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,157
INSTITUTIONALLY IS SPEAKING ON 

421
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:38,723
BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN 

422
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:39,558
GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZING AND 

423
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,126
CALLING OUT IN PUBLIC WHAT 

424
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,128
RUSSIA HAS DONE AND WHAT HE 

425
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,062
BELIEVES RUSSIA IS DOING. 

426
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,631
SO YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF 

427
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,299
INTERESTING BACK DROP FOR 

428
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,767
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

429
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,703
WHATEVER HE'S SAYING ON 

430
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,271
TWITTER, HOWEVER HE COMPORTS 

431
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,805
HIMSELF FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE 

432
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,374
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, THE 

433
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,642
INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA ARE 

434
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,043
SENDING DISTINCT SIGNALS RIGHT 

435
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,812
NOW ON THEIR OWN ABOUT WHAT HAS 

436
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,347
HAPPENED AND WHAT MAY BE GOING 

437
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,316
ON AND THE THREATS THAT STILL 

438
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:04,650
EXIST. 

439
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,551
AND THAT WHATEVER PRESIDENT 

440
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,319
TRUMP DOES OR DOESN'T DO IS ITS 

441
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,222
OWN WAY A SIGNAL TO PUTIN AND 

442
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,089
HIS GOVERNMENT THAT 

443
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:12,124
INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA KNOW 

444
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,960
WHAT'S HAPPENING AND ARE 

445
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,528
PREPARED TO CALL THEM OUT. 

446
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:19,798
>> AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD 

447
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,665
POINT, MAJOR. 

448
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:21,767
I ACTUALLY SPOKE WITH A SENIOR 

449
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,101
DIPLOMATIC OFFICIAL AND I ASKED 

450
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:26,005
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT IS 

451
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:26,939
GOING TO BRING UP THE RUSSIAN 

452
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,474
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 

453
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,375
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE 

454
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,112
SENIOR DIP MAT SAID TO ME I'M 

455
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:33,746
NOT LOOKING BACK. 

456
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,180
I'M LOOKING AT NOVEMBER AND 

457
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,981
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND 

458
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,150
IF THEY DON'T CHANGE WHAT THEY 

459
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,218
ARE DOING IN NOVEMBER ALL BETS 

460
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,087
ARE OFF. 

461
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:42,687
AND I SAID DOES THE PRESIDENT 

462
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:43,088
AGREE WITH THAT? 

463
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,790
IS THAT THE MESSAGE THE 

464
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,860
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DELIVER 

465
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,861
TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THIS 

466
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,963
DIPLOMAT SAID HE DID NOT HAVE 

467
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,965
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION SO 

468
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,834
I THINK YOU SEE ALREADY WHAT IS 

469
00:13:55,834 --> 00:14:01,340
HAPPENING NOW THAT RUSSIA'S 

470
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,209
DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO TART 

471
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,779
AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC IDEALS AND 

472
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,447
OUR SYSTEM ARE ON GOING AND 

473
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,483
THERE'S A HOPE THAT LAW 

474
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,016
ENFORCEMENT INTELLIGENCE 

475
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:14,553
COMMUNITIES THAT THE PRESIDENT 

476
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,255
WILL CONFRONT OR DID CONFRONT 

477
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:16,922
PRESIDENT PUTIN. 

478
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,424
LET'S GO BACK TO WEIJIA JANG 

479
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,559
WHO IS INSIDE THE ROOM AND 

480
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,626
SOMETHING APPEARS TO BE 

481
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:22,060
HAPPENING THERE. 

482
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,796
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? 

483
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:25,430
>> NORAH YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW 

484
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,866
THERE IS A JOURNALIST WITH THE 

485
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:32,004
MEDIA ORGANIZATION THE NATIONS 

486
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,372
THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE IT'S 

487
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,241
BECOMING QUITE VIOLENT AS HE IS 

488
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:36,775
RESISTING. 

489
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,643
IT STARTED WHEN HE STARTED 

490
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,578
HECKLING THOSE OF US WHO WERE 

491
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,014
IN THE MIDDLE OF REPORTING AND 

492
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:48,554
TWO MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY 

493
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,188
DETAIL CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT. 

494
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:49,788
HE CAME OUT AND SHOWED A SIGN 

495
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,355
THAT HE HAD APPARENTLY MADE 

496
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,725
THAT LOOKED LIKE A HAND MADE 

497
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,959
SIGN THAT SAID NUCLEAR WEAPON 

498
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,162
TREATY AND THAT'S WHEN THIS ALL 

499
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:57,929
UNFOLDED AND INTENSIFIED. 

500
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:00,566
AS YOU CAN SEE HE'S BEEN 

501
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,735
ESCORTED BY AN ENTIRE TEAM OF 

502
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,703
ABOUT TEN SECURITY OFFICIALS SO 

503
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,971
IT REALLY ESCALATED IN THE PAST 

504
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,774
TWO MINUTES I WOULD SAY HE WAS 

505
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,043
TAKEN INSIDE AFTER THE INITIAL 

506
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,945
HECKLING, BROUGHT BACK OUT HERE 

507
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,147
BECAUSE HE SAYS HIMSELF THAT HE 

508
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,383
WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING A 

509
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:21,487
MALICIOUS ITEM AND HE RETRIEVED 

510
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,621
THIS HAND MADE SIGN, AGAIN 

511
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,089
SOMETHING ABOUT A NUCLEAR 

512
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,357
WEAPONS TREATY AND THEN 

513
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:29,060
OFFICIALS ASKED HIM TO LEAVE. 

514
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,963
HE RESISTED AND THEN AS YOU 

515
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,064
SAW, THEY PHYSICALLY GRABBED 

516
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,599
HIM AND HE CONTINUED TO RESIST. 

517
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,703
BUT HE HAS NOW BEEN ESCORTED 

518
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,237
OUT OF THE ROOM. 

519
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,340
WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS 

520
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,242
COULD IMPACT THE JOINT PRESS 

521
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,077
CONFERENCE HERE AS YOU 

522
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:45,811
MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN WAITING 

523
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,846
FOR NOW FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO 

524
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,383
IT IS VERY TESTY IN HERE. 

525
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,985
YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND, NOW THE 

526
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,186
VOLUME HAS TURNED UP BECAUSE 

527
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,554
EVERYBODY IS NOW TALKING ABOUT 

528
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,389
IT AND I THINK THEY ARE TRYING 

529
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,358
TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHO HE IS 

530
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,326
BUT WE BELIEVE HE'S A 

531
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:02,393
JOURNALIST WITH THE NATIONS. 

532
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,930
NOW HIS PERSONAL ITEMS ARE 

533
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,534
BEING COLLECTED, HIS LAPTOP AND 

534
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,267
HIS BACKPACK. 

535
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,337
SO YOU SAW IT ALL UNFOLD. 

536
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:14,640
IT WAS A PRETTY DRAMATIC SCENE 

537
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,841
HERE BECAUSE THE GENTLEMAN 

538
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:20,412
REFUSED TO LEAVE EVEN AFTER 

539
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,680
MORE AND MORE SECURITY DETAIL 

540
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,483
MEMBERS TRIED TO REMOVE HIM 

541
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,751
FROM THE ROOM. 

542
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:31,957
SO WE WILL HAVE TO GET MORE 

543
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:32,591
CLARIFICATION ABOUT WHAT LED UP 

544
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,760
TO IT AND WHAT THAT SIGN SAID 

545
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,331
BUT FOR NOW HE'S BEEN REMOVED 

546
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:39,698
FROM THIS ROOM. 

547
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:39,965
>> OKAY. 

548
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:40,398
WEIJIA THANK YOU. 

549
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:41,500
CLEARLY SOME TYPE OF 

550
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,634
DISTURBANCE INSIDE THAT PRESS 

551
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,670
ROOM BUT WE SHOULDN'T LET IT 

552
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,404
DISTRACT US FROM REALLY WHAT 

553
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,941
ARE REAL QUESTION ABOUT WHAT 

554
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,143
HAPPENED BETWEEN TRUMP AND 

555
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:51,376
PUTIN. 

556
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:52,077
JOHN, GAYLE, MARGARET I'LL SEND 

557
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,047
IT BACK TO YOU GUYS. 

558
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:55,580
>> ONE OF THE INTERESTING 

559
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,115
QUESTIONS IS ABOUT AN AGENDA. 

560
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,917
ONE IT GIVES THE PRESIDENT 

561
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,552
MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE THE 

562
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,854
PIECES ON THE BOARD AS HE 

563
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:06,090
WISHES AND ALSO TO HAVE A BIG 

564
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:06,858
REVEAL AFTER IT'S OVER. 

565
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,560
SUDDENLY HE'S ABLE TO GET SOME 

566
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,028
PIECES OF VARIOUS THINGS THAT 

567
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:14,933
HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT MAYBE A 

568
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:15,500
NEW ARMS CONTROL TREATY AND 

569
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,099
HAVE A BIG MESSAGE COMING OUT 

570
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,334
OF IT. 

571
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,069
THE SECOND OPTION IS WHEN 

572
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,505
LISTENING TO A NUMBER OF U.S. 

573
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,373
OFFICIALS DESCRIBE WHAT THEY 

574
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,374
THOUGHT U.S. POLICY SHOULD BE 

575
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,041
AND THEY ASKED WILL THE 

576
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,278
PRESIDENT SAY THAT THEY SAID WE 

577
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:26,611
HOPE SO. 

578
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,046
THEY ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW HE 

579
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,782
WILL BEHAVE AND WHETHER HE WILL 

580
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:34,620
STAY WITH U.S. POLICY AS IT'S 

581
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,254
BEEN ARTICULATED IN THIS 

582
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:35,554
TESTIMONY. 

583
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,156
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE 

584
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,725
MAN AT THE TOP OF THE 

585
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,225
ORGANIZATIONAL CHART. 

586
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,861
>> LET'S NOT FORGET THAT FORMER 

587
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,229
OFFICIAL SEAS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED 

588
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,365
THOSE AIDS HAVE GIVEN UP TRYING 

589
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,500
TO CONTROL WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

590
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,535
SAYS TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND WHAT 

591
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,535
HE SAYS ABOUT HIM. 

592
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:52,871
SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE PEOPLE 

593
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,041
LIKE FIONA HILL WHO ARE HAWKISH 

594
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,075
TRADITIONALLY AND IT LOOKS LIKE 

595
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:57,776
THE COMMUNICATION TEAMS ARE 

596
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,079
COMING IN SO WE SHOULD BE 

597
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,980
EXPECTING THE PRESIDENTS 

598
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,313
MOMENTARILY. 

599
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:05,317
SO ON THE FLIP SIDE OF HAVING 

600
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,554
HIS ADVISORS THERE AND SOME WHO 

601
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,521
HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN VERY 

602
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,023
HAWKISH ON RUSSIA AT THE END OF 

603
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,391
THE DAY ESPECIALLY WITH THIS 

604
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,526
PRESIDENT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO 

605
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,329
WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY AND WHAT 

606
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,229
HE DECIDES TO DO. 

607
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:21,533
>> THAT'S WHAT'S SO INCREDIBLY 

608
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,401
FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE 

609
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,737
TRYING TO BEST PREPARE HIM WITH 

610
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,306
FACTS YOU HEAR QUITE OFTEN WE 

611
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,508
ARE GOING TO INGUN DATE HIM 

612
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:36,915
WITH DATA IN THE HOPES OF 

613
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,783
TRYING TO PURSUE SUICIDE-

614
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,583
-PERSUADE HIM. 

615
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,220
>> THE CHALLENGE IS THE 

616
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,455
PRESIDENT LIKES GOING WITH HIS 

617
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,556
GUT ON THESE THINGS. 

618
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,258
THERE IS SUCH HIGH-RISK IN 

619
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:46,691
THESE DECISIONS. 

620
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,895
>> GIVE US A TASTE OF WHAT IT 

621
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,130
NORMALLY IS LIKE IN THESE KINDS 

622
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,834
OF SITUATIONS THE POURING OVER 

623
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,503
INDIVIDUAL WORDS TO KEEP FROM 

624
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,906
MISS IMPRESSION. 

625
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:14,052
>> THEY ARE BOTH ENTERING NOW.

626
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:16,988
>> Translator: DISTINGUISHED 

627
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:17,522
MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND 

628
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:22,761
GENTLEMEN.

629
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:23,695
>> MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND 

630
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,096

TRUMP TO PLACE IN A FRANK AND 

633
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,236
LIKE ATMOSPHERE I THINK WE CAN 

634
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:35,474
CALL IT A SUCCESS AND VERY 

635
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,708
FRUITFUL ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS. 

636
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,275
WE CAREFULLY ANALYZED THE 

637
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:40,178
CURRENT PRESIDENT AND THE 

638
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,347
FUTURE OF THE RUSSIA UNITED 

639
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,582
STATES RELATIONSHIP KEY ISSUES 

640
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:46,518
OF THE GLOBAL AGENDA. 

641
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,022
IT'S QUITE NEW TO EVERYONE THAT 

642
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,858
THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 

643
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,826
GOING THROUGH A COMPLICATED 

644
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,328
STANGE STANGE--STAGE AND YET 

645
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,697
THE CURRENT TENSION AND 

646
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,331
ATMOSPHERE ESSENTIALLY HAVE NO 

647
00:19:59,331 --> 00:19:59,865
SOLID REASON BEHIND IT. 

648
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:06,672
THE COLD WAR IS A THING OF THE 

649
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:06,872
PAST. 

650
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,739
THE ERA OF ACUTE IDEOLOGY 

651
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,374
COMMUNICATION IS THE BEST OF 

652
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:09,674
THE BEST. 

653
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:12,678
THE SITUATION OF THE WORLD 

654
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,145
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. 

655
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,546
TO DATE BOTH RUSSIA AND THE 

656
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:19,351
UNITED STATES FACED A WHOLE NEW 

657
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,285
SET OF CHALLENGES. 

658
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,387
THOSE INCLUDE DANGEROUS 

659
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,724
ADJUSTMENT OF MECHANISMS FOR 

660
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,925
MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL 

661
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,859
SECURITY AND STABILITY, 

662
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,027
ORIGINAL CRISIS. 

663
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:34,933
THE CREEPING THREATS OF 

664
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,735
TERRORISM AND TRANCE NATIONAL 

665
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,002
CRIME. 

666
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,471
IF THE SNOW BALLING PROBLEMS IN 

667
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,372
THE ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENTAL 

668
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,307
RISKS AND OTHER SETS OF 

669
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,675
CHALLENGES WE CAN ONLY COPE 

670
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,010
WITH THESE CHALLENGES IF WE 

671
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,512
JOIN THE RANKS AND WORK 

672
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:47,946
TOGETHER. 

673
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,815
HOPEFULLY WE WILL REACH THIS 

674
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,719
UNDERSTANDING WITH OUR AMERICAN 

675
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:53,986
PARTNERS. 

676
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,020
THESE NEGOTIATIONS REFLECTED 

677
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,558
OUR JOINT WISH WITH PRESIDENT 

678
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,961
TRUMP TO REDRESS THIS NEGATIVE 

679
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:03,461
SITUATION AND BILATERAL 

680
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:03,795
RELATIONSHIP. 

681
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,966
OUT LINE THE FIRST STEPS FOR 

682
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:08,566
IMPROVING THE RELATIONSHIP TO 

683
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,234
RESTORE THE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF 

684
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,303
TRUST AND GOING BACK TO THE 

685
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,339
PREVIOUS LEVEL OF INTERACTION 

686
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,574
ON ALL MUTUAL INTEREST ISSUES. 

687
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:18,710
AS MAJOR NUCLEAR POWERS, WE 

688
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,582
BEAR SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 

689
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,115
MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL 

690
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:24,382
SECURITY. 

691
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,485
IT IS VITAL AND WE MENTIONED 

692
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,954
THIS DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS 

693
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,891
IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE FINE TUNE 

694
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,526
THE STRATEGIC STABILITY AND 

695
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,027
GLOBAL SECURITY AND NON--OF 

696
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,095
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 

697
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,432
WE SUBMITTED OUR AMERICAN

00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,267
COLLEAGUES WITH A NOTE WITH A 

699
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,269
NUMBER OF SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS. 

700
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:49,141
WE BELIEVE IT NECESSARY TO WORK 

701
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:55,714
TOGETHER FURTHER ON TO INTERACT 

702
00:21:55,714 --> 00:22:00,218
ON THE DISCERNMENT AGENDA, 

703
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:00,752
METEOROLOGY COMPETITION. 

704
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,419
THIS INCLUDES THE EXTENSION OF 

705
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,620
THE STRATEGIC ARMS TREATY. 

706
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,391
IT'S A DANGEROUS SITUATION WITH 

707
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,826
THE GLOBAL AMERICAN DEFENSE 

708
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,328
SYSTEM AS THE IMPLEMENTATION 

709
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,863
ISSUES WITH THE IMF TREATY AND 

710
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:19,337
OF COURSE THE AGENDA ON NON

00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:24,342
PLACEMENT WEAPONS IN SPACE. 

712
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:24,876
WE FAVORED THE CONTINUED 

713
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,011
OPERATION IN COUNTER TERRORISM 

714
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,044
AND MAINTAIN SIGNER SECURITY. 

715
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:31,249
AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT 

716
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,385
SPECIFICALLY THAT OUR SPECIAL 

717
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,288
SERVICES ARE OPERATING QUITE 

718
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,456
SUCCESSFULLY. 

719
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,024
THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE IS 

720
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:44,863
THEIR OPERATION WITH THEM THE 

721
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,299
RECENTLY CONCLUDED WORLD FUTBOL 

722
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:47,899
CUP. 

723
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,367
IN GENERAL, THE CONTACTS AMONG 

724
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,435
THE SPECIAL SERVICES SHOULD BE 

725
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:55,073
PUT TO A SYSTEM WIDE BASIS, 

726
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,207
SHOULD BE A SYSTEMATIC 

727
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:56,507
FRAMEWORK. 

728
00:22:56,507 --> 00:23:01,278
I RECALL I REMINDED PRESIDENT 

729
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:01,879

732
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,751
WE ALSO MENTIONED THE CRISIS IS 

733
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:11,056

734
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,625
DUFF DALE EXACTLY AND MUTUAL 

735
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,861
INTEREST ABOUND WE HAVE TO LOOK

AS FAR AS SYRIA IS CONCERNED 

743
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,143
THE TASK OF SUSTAINING PEACE 

744
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,545
AND RECONCILIATION IN THIS 

745
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:39,117

746
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:39,717

747
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:39,917

RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES 

749
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,358
APPARENTLY CAN TAKE LEADERSHIP 

750
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:52,631

755
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:01,406
IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS 

756
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,107

764
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,390

THE SOUTH WEST OF SYRI. 

768
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:31,736
THE SOUTH OF SYRIA SHOULD BE 

769
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:36,041
BROUGHT TO THE FULL COMPLIANCE 

770
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,343
WITH THE TREATY OF 1974 ABOUT 

771
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,947

772
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:42,747

DIALOGUE INSTEAD OF 

797
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:37,869
CONFRONTATION.

ABOUT THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE 

800
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,845
UNITED STATES FROM THE JCPOA. 

801
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:51,549
THE U.S. COUNTER PARTS ARE 

802
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,516
AWARE OF OUR POSTURE. 

803
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:57,489

AT THE SAME TIME THE UNITED 

811
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,318
STATES COULD BE MORE DECISIVE 

812
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:30,454
IN NUDGING THE URANIAN 

813
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:32,657

COUNTRIES ARE INTERESTED IN 

818
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:41,532

819
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:45,737
AMERICAN DELEGATION WAS ONE OF 

820
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:50,041
THE LARGEST IN THE ST. 

821
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,608

CAN BRING TOGETHER CAPTAINS OF 

829
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,723
RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN BUSINESS. 

830
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:06,858
AFTER ALL, ENTREPRENEURS AND 

831
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:11,062
BUSINESS MEN KNOW BETTER HOW TO 

832
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,164
ARTICULATE THIS SUCCESSFUL 

833
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,466

WHEN THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS AND 

840
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,650
I HAD TO REITERATE THINGS I 

841
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,919
SAID SEVERAL TIMES INCLUDING IN 

842
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,355
PERSON THAT THE RUSSIAN STATE 

843
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,424
HAS NEVER INTERFERED AND IS NOT 

844
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:43,094
GOING TO INTERFERE INTO 

845
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,130
INTERNAL AMERICAN AFFAIRS 

846
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,497
INCLUDING THE ELECTION PROCESS. 

847
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:48,032

ANALYZE TOGETHER. 

850
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,605
FOR INSTANCE WE CAN ANALYZE 

851
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,539
THEM THROUGH THE JOINT WORKING 

852
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:58,643
GROUP ON CYBER SECURITY THE 

853
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,745
ESTABLISHMENT OF WHICH WE 

854
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:06,651
DISCUSSED DURING OUR PREVIOUS 

855
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:06,918
CONTACTS. 

856
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,021
AND CLEARLY, IT'S PASTIME WE 

857
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:15,226
RESTORE OUR OPERATION IN THE 

858
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:15,759
CULTURAL AREA, IN THE HUE 

859
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,361
PLANTAIN AREA. 

860
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,464
AS FAR AS I THINK YOU KNOW THAT 

861
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,267
RECENTLY WE HOSTED THE AMERICAN 

862
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,569
CONGRESS MAN DELEGATION AND NOW 

863
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,804
IT'S PERCEIVED OR PORTRAYED 

864
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,238
ALMOST AS A HISTORIC EVENT 

865
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,073
ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 

866
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:33,111
CURRENT AFFAIRS, BUSINESS AS 

867
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:33,845
USUAL. 

868
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:34,345
IN A BUSINESS REGARD WE 

869
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:34,946
MENTIONED THE PROPOSAL TO THE 

870
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:35,246
PRESIDENT. 

871
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,217
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE 

872
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:39,751
PRACTICALITIES ABOUT OUR 

873
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,186
COMPRESSION BUT ALSO THE LOGIC 

874
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:48,059
OF IT AND WE HAVE TO ENGAGE 

875
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,060
EXPERTS ON BILATERAL 

876
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,761
RELATIONSHIP WHO KNOW HISTORY 

877
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,064
IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR 

878
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:53,397
RELATIONSHIP. 

879
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:55,466
THE IDEA 17 TO CREATE AN EXPERT 

880
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:59,303
COUNCIL THAT WOULD INCLUDE 

881
00:28:59,303 --> 00:28:59,937
POLITICAL SCIENTISTS PROMINENT 

882
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:01,039
MILITARY EXPERTS ON BOTH 

883
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,074
COUNTRIES WHO HAVE LOOKED FOR 

884
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,075
POINTS OF CONTACT BETWEEN THOSE 

885
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,644
TWO COUNTRIES AND TO LOOK FOR 

886
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,112
WAYS ON PUTTING THE 

887
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:11,583
RELATIONSHIP ON THE TRAJECTORY 

888
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:11,883
OF GROWTH. 

889
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,985
IN GENERAL WE ARE GLAD FOR THE 

890
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,855
OUTCOME OF OUR FIRST FULL SCALE 

891
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,990
MEETING BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY WE 

892
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,760
ONLY HAD A CHANCE TO TALK 

893
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,394
BRIEFLY ON INTERNATIONAL FORUM. 

894
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,262
WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH 

895
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,164
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I HOPE THAT 

896
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:30,068
WE START TO UNDERSTAND EACH 

897
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,403
OTHER BETTER AND I'M GRATEFUL 

898
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,072
TO DONALD FOR IT. 

899
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:36,007
CLEARLY THERE ARE SOME 

900
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:36,975
CHALLENGES LEFT WHEN WE WERE 

901
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,977
NOT ABLE TO CLEAR ALL OF THE 

902
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,646
BACK LOG BUT I THINK WE MADE 

903
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,414
THE FIRST IMPORTANT STEP IN 

904
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,382
THIS DIRECTION AND IN 

905
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:48,386
CONCLUSION I WANT TO POINT OUT 

906
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,620

907
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,822

I HAVE JUST CONCLUDED A MEETING 

920
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:18,850
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN ON A WIDE 

921
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,219
RANGE OF CRITICAL ISSUES FOR 

922
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,756
BOTH OF OUR COUNTRIES. 

923
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,323
WE ARE DIRECT OPEN DEEPLY 

924
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:25,790
PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE. 

925
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,524
IT WENT VERY WELL. 

926
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:31,396
BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK 

927
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,799
PRESIDENT NINISTO OF FINLAND 

928
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,503
FOR GRACIOUSLY HOSTING TODAY'S 

929
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:38,736
SUMMIT. 

930
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,472
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I WERE 

931
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,207
SAYING HOW LOVELY IT WAS AND 

932
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:45,343
WHAT A GREAT JOB THEY DID. 

933
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,379
I ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE 

934
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,948
RUSSIA AND PRESIDENT PUTIN FOR 

935
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,283
HAVING DONE SUCH AN EXCELLENT 

936
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,184
JOB IN HOSTING THE WORLD CUP. 

937
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,153
IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE BEST 

938
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,021
EVER AND YOUR TEAM ALSO DID 

939
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,455
VERY WELL. 

940
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,756
IT WAS A GREAT JOB. 

941
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:03,227
I'M HERE TODAY TO CONTINUE THE 

942
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:05,563
PROUD TRADITION OF BOLD 

943
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,030
AMERICAN DIPLOMACY. 

944
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,933
FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF OUR 

945
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,102
REPUBLICAN LEADERS UNDERSTOOD 

946
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,404
THAT DIPLOMACY AND ENGAGEMENT 

947
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,273
IS PREFERRABLE TO CONFLICT AND 

948
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:15,573
HOSTILITY. 

949
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:16,307
A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE IS NOT 

950
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,109
ONLY GOOD FOR THE UNITED STATES 

951
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:23,648
AND GOOD FOR RUSSIA BUT IT IS 

952
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,115
GOOD FOR THE WORLD. 

953
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,316
THE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN OUR 

954
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,884
TWO COUNTRIES ARE WELL KNOWN 

955
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:31,889
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I 

956
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:34,959
DISCUSSED THEM AT LENGTH TODAY. 

957
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:35,993
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE 

958
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:36,928
MANY OF THE PROBLEMS FACING OUR 

959
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,197
WORLD THEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 

960
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:42,600
TO FIND WAYS TO COOPERATE IN 

961
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,734
PURSUIT OF SHARED INTERESTS. 

962
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:45,303
TOO OFTEN IN BOTH RECENT PAST 

963
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,606
AND LONG AGO, WE HAVE SEEN THE 

964
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:53,211
CONSEQUENCES WHEN DIPLOMACY IS 

965
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,211
LEFT ON THE TABLE. 

966
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,080
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE BENEFITS 

967
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,480
OF COOPERATION. 

968
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,816
IN THE LAST CENTURY OUR NATIONS 

969
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,853
FOUGHT LONG SIDE ONE ANOTHER IN 

970
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,020
THE SECOND WORLD WAR. 

971
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,856
EVEN DURING THE TENSIONS OF THE 

972
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,025
COLD WAR WHEN THE WORLD LOOKED 

973
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,926
MUCH DIFFERENT THAN IT DOES 

974
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,461
TODAY, THE UNITED STATES AND 

975
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:16,100
RUSSIA WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A 

976
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,802
STRONG DIALOGUE. 

977
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,537
BUT OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS NEVER 

978
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:24,375
BEEN WORSE THAN IT IS NOW. 

979
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:28,479
HOWEVER, THAT CHANGED AS OF 

980
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,914
ABOUT FOUR HOURS AGO. 

981
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,350
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. 

982
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,285
NOTHING WOULD BE EASIER 

983
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,220
POLITICALLY THAN TO REFUSE TO 

984
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,559
MEET, TO REFUSE TO ENGAGE BUT 

985
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,395
THAT WOULD NOT ACCOMPLISH 

986
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:44,662
ANYTHING. 

987
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,464
AS PRESIDENT I CANNOT MAKE 

988
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,866
DECISIONS ON FOREIGN POLICY. 

989
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,735
IN A FOOT CRITICAL EFFORT TO 

990
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,904
APPEASE PARTISAN CRITICS OR THE 

991
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:56,441
MEDIA OR DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO 

992
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,711
DO NOTHING BUT RESIST AND 

993
00:32:59,711 --> 00:32:59,977
OBSTRUCT. 

994
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:00,578
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN 

995
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,714
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA 

996
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:05,149
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN NEW 

997
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,584
PATHWAYS TOWARDS PEACE AND 

998
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:07,484
STABILITY IN OUR WORLD. 

999
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:09,487
I WOULD RATHER TAKE A POLITICAL 

1000
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,190
RISK IN PURSUIT OF PEACE THAN 

1001
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,760
TO RISK PEACE IN PURSUIT OF 

1002
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,027
POLITICS. 

1003
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,895
AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS PUT 

1004
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,799
WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA AND 

1005
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:26,838
WHAT IS BEST FOR THE AMERICAN 

1006
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,071
PEOPLE. 

1007
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,172
DURING TODAY'S MEETING I 

1008
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,607
ADDRESS DIRECTLY WITH PRESIDENT 

1009
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,976
PUTIN THE ISSUE OF RUSSIAN 

1010
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:32,943
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 

1011
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:36,247
I FELT THIS WAS A MESSAGE BEST 

1012
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:36,847
DELIVERED IN PERSON. 

1013
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:39,183
SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME 

1014
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,985
TALKING ABOUT IT AND PRESIDENT 

1015
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:47,125
PUTIN MAY VERY WELL WANT TO 

1016
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,292
ADDRESS IT AND VERY STRONGLY 

1017
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,227
BECAUSE HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY 

1018
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,629
ABOUT IT AND HAS AN INTERESTING 

1019
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:51,829
IDEA. 

1020
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,800
WE ALSO DISCUSSED ONE OF THE 

1021
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,935
MOST CRITICAL CHALLENGES FACING 

1022
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:58,202
HUMANITY. 

1023
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:58,702
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. 

1024
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:00,738
I PROVIDED AN UPDATE AT MY 

1025
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,074
MEETING LAST MONTH WITH 

1026
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,709
CHAIRMAN KIM ON THE 

1027
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,310
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA 

1028
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:10,214
AND AFTER TODAY I AM VERY SURE 

1029
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:14,752
THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN AND RUSSIA 

1030
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,088
PROBLEM AND ARE GOING TO WORK 

1031
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:17,788
WITH US. 

1032
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:19,657
AND I APPRECIATE THAT 

1033
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:19,956
COMMITMENT. 

1034
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:23,895
THE PRESIDENT AND I ALSO 

1035
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,795
DISCUSSED THE RADICAL ISLAMIC 

1036
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:26,096
TERRORISM. 

1037
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:28,498
BOTH RUSSIA AND THE UNITED 

1038
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:29,299
STATES HAVE SUFFERED. 

1039
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:31,969
HORRIFIC TERRORIST ATTACKS AND 

1040
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,005
WE HAVE AGREED TO MAINTAIN OPEN 

1041
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,174
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR 

1042
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,375
SECURITY AGENCIES TO PROTECT 

1043
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,378
OUR CITIZENS FROM THIS GLOBAL 

1044
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:40,610
MENACE. 

1045
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,780
LAST YEAR WE TOLD RUSSIA ABOUT 

1046
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,781
A PLANNED ATTACK IN ST. 

1047
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:48,485
PETERSBURG AND THEY WERE ABLE 

1048
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,453
TO STOP IT COLD. 

1049
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:51,154
THEY FOUND THEM, THEY STOPPED 

1050
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:51,856
THEM. 

1051
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,858
THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. 

1052
00:34:54,858 --> 00:34:56,327
I APPRECIATED PRESIDENT PUTIN'S 

1053
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:00,631
PHONE CALL AFTERWARDS TO THANK 

1054
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,199
ME. 

1055
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,333
I ALSO EMPHASIZED THE 

1056
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,468
IMPORTANCE IN PLACING PRESSURE 

1057
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:06,771
ON IRAN TO HALT ITS NUCLEAR 

1058
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,639
AMBITIONS AND TO STOP ITS 

1059
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,740
CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT 

1060
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,376
THE AREA AND THROUGHOUT THE 

1061
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,010
MIDDLE EAST. 

1062
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:18,449
AS WE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH, THE 

1063
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,954
CRISIS IN SYRIA IS A COMPLEX 

1064
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,154
ONE. 

1065
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:23,721
COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO 

1066
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,756
COUNTRIES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 

1067
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,992
SAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 

1068
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:29,226
LIVES. 

1069
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:30,361
I ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THE 

1070
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,863
UNITED STATES WILL NOT ALLOW 

1071
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:37,635
IRAN TO BENEFIT FROM OUR 

1072
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,836
SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN AGAINST 

1073
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:39,203
ISIS. 

1074
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:42,106
WE HAVE JUST ABOUT ERAT 

1075
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,275
INDICATED ISIS IN THE AREA. 

1076
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,576
WE ALSO AGREED THAT 

1077
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,811
REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUR 

1078
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,678
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCILS WILL 

1079
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,348
MEET TO FOLLOW UP ON ALL OF THE 

1080
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,084
ISSUES WE ADDRESSED TODAY AND 

1081
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:59,123
TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESS WE 

1082
00:35:59,123 --> 00:35:59,656
HAVE STARTED RIGHT HERE. 

1083
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:00,858
TODAY'S MEETING IS ONLY THE 

1084
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,759
BEGINNING OF A LONGER PROCESS. 

1085
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:04,695
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST 

1086
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,732
STEPS TOWARDS A BRIGHTER FUTURE 

1087
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:13,037
AND ONE WITH A STRONG DIALOGUE 

1088
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,807
AND A LOT OF THOUGHT. 

1089
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,242
OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE GROUNDED 

1090
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,978
IN REALISM BUT OUR HOPES ARE 

1091
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,478
DESIRE FOR FRIENDSHIP, 

1092
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:22,980
COOPERATION AND PEACE AND I 

1093
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,482
THINK I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF 

1094
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,852
RUSSIA WHEN I SAY THAT ALSO. 

1095
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,654
PRESIDENT PUTIN, I WANT TO 

1096
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,722
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR JOINING ME 

1097
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:36,360
FOR THESE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS 

1098
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,027
AND FOR ADVANCING OPEN DIALOGUE 

1099
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:39,163
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE UNITED 

1100
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:39,396
STATES. 

1101
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:46,904
OUR MEETING CARRIES ON A LONG 

1102
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,038
TRADITION OF DIPLOMACY BETWEEN 

1103
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:48,639
RUSSIA, THE UNITED STATES FOR 

1104
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,342
THE GREATER GOOD OF ALL AND 

1105
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,677
THIS WAS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE 

1106
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:52,877
DAY. 

1107
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,278
THIS WAS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE 

1108
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,013
FEW HOURS THAT WE SPENT 

1109
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:56,280
TOGETHER. 

1110
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,885
IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF BOTH OF 

1111
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,485
OUR COUNTRIES TO CONTINUE OUR 

1112
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,920
CONVERSATION AND WE HAVE AGREED 

1113
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,620
TO DO SO. 

1114
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,858
I'M SURE WE'LL BE MEETING AGAIN 

1115
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,027
IN THE FUTURE OFTEN. 

1116
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,061
AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SOLVE 

1117
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:12,463
EVERY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT 

1118
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:17,802
WE DISCUSSED TODAY SO AGAIN 

1119
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:24,875
PRESIDENT PUTIN, THANK YOU VERY 

1120
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:25,075
MUCH. 

1121
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:25,776
>> THE PRESIDENTS, NOW THE 

1122
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,844
JOURNALISTS WILL HAVE A CHANCE 

1123
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:30,915
TO ASK TWO SETS OF QUESTIONS. 

1124
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,116
EACH FIRST THE RUSSIAN 

1125
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:37,254
JOURNALIST WILL ASK A QUESTION. 

1126
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:37,888
PLEASE GIVE YOUR AFFILIATION. 

1127
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,790
>> GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS 

1128
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,190
INTERFAX AGENCY. 

1129
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,427
I HAVE A QUESTION TO PRESIDENT 

1130
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:43,660
TRUMP. 

1131
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,828
DURING YOUR RECENT EUROPEAN 

1132
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:50,967
TOUR YOU MENTIONED THE 

1133
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:51,568
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NORTH 

1134
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,337
STREAM TO GAS PIPELINE MAKES 

1135
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,540
EUROPE A HOSTAGE OF RUSSIA AND 

1136
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,543
YOU SUGGESTED THAT YOU COULD 

1137
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,714
FREE EUROPE FROM THIS BY 

1138
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,281
SUPPLYING AMERICAN ENERGY. 

1139
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,016
BUT THIS COLD WINTER ACTUALLY 

1140
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:09,286
SHOWED THAT THE CURRENT MODEL, 

1141
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,255
CURRENT MECHANISM OF SUPPLIED 

1142
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,724
FUEL TO EUROPE IS QUITE VIABLE. 

1143
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,760
AT THE SAME TIME, AS FAR AS I 

1144
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,862
KNOW, U.S. HAD TO BUY EVEN 

1145
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,029
RUSSIAN GAS FOR BOSTON. 

1146
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:21,966
I HAVE A QUESTION, THE 

1147
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,866
IMPLEMENTATION OF YOUR IDEA HAS 

1148
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:26,504
A POLITICAL CHANGE TO IT OR IS 

1149
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,671
IT A PRACTICAL ONE BECAUSE 

1150
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:31,075
THERE WILL BE A GAP FORMED IN 

1151
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,343
THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND MECHANISM 

1152
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,745
AND THE FIRST OF THE CONSUMING 

1153
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,946
COUNTRIES WHO WILL FALL INTO 

1154
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,581
THIS GAP AND THE SECOND 

1155
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,849
QUESTION BEFORE THE MEETING 

1156
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:45,256
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN YOU CALLED 

1157
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,024
HIM AN ADVERSERY ARRIVAL AND 

1158
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:50,961
YET ABLE TO BRING THIS 

1159
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,931
RELATIONSHIP TO A NEW LEVEL. 

1160
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:54,398
DID YOU MENTION THIS? 

1161
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:54,965
>> ACTUALLY I CALLED HIM A 

1162
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:55,800
COMPETITOR AND A GOOD 

1163
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,569
COMPETITOR HE IS AND I THINK 

1164
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:05,409
THE WORD COMPETITOR IS A 

1165
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:05,709
COMPLIMENT. 

1166
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:06,310
I THINK THAT WE WILL BE 

1167
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,546
COMPETING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 

1168
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,145
THE PIPELINE. 

1169
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:10,214
I'M NOT SURE NECESSARILY THAT 

1170
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,449
IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF 

1171
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:14,819
GERMANY OR NOT BUT THAT WAS A 

1172
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,519
DECISION THAT THEY MADE. 

1173
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,787
WE'LL BE COMPETING AS YOU KNOW 

1174
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,122
THE UNITED STATES IS NOW OR 

1175
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,891
SOON WILL BE BUT I THINK IT 

1176
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,894
ACTUALLY IS RIGHT NOW THE 

1177
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:29,232
LARGEST IN THE OIL AND GAS 

1178
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:29,833
WORLD SO WE'LL HAVE TO BE 

1179
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:33,804
COMPETING WITH THE PIPELINE AND 

1180
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:34,271
I THINK WE'LL COMPETE 

1181
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,406
SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THERE IS 

1182
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,840
AN ADVANTAGE LOCATION WISE. 

1183
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,443
I JUST WISHED THEM LUCK. 

1184
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:39,877
I DID. 

1185
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,779
I DISCUSSED WITH ANGELA MERKEL 

1186
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,414
IN PRETTY STRONG TONES BUT I 

1187
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,749
ALSO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE ALL 

1188
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:46,984
COMING FROM AND THEY HAVE A 

1189
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,552
VERY CLOSE SOURCE SO WE'LL SEE 

1190
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,321
HOW THAT ALL WORKS OUT BUT WE 

1191
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,256
HAVE LOTS OF SOURCES NOW AND 

1192
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,958
THE UNITED STATES IS MUCH 

1193
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,392
DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS A NUMBER 

1194
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,496
OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE WEREN'T 

1195
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,531
ABLE TO EXTRACT WHAT WE CAN 

1196
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:00,898
EXTRACT TODAY. 

1197
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,499
TODAY WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN THE 

1198
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:04,468
WORLD AT THAT AND I THINK WE'LL 

1199
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:13,944
BE OUT THERE COMPETING VERY 

1200
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:14,211
STRONGLY. 

1201
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:14,678
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1202
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:15,880
>> IF I MAY THROW IN MY TWO 

1203
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,381
CENTS WE TALKED TO THE 

1204
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:20,050
PRESIDENT INCLUDING THE SUBJECT 

1205
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,085
AS WELL. 

1206
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,454
WE ARE AWAR OF THE EXTENTS OF 

1207
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,123
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I THINK 

1208
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,326
THAT WE AS A MAJOR OIL AND GAS 

1209
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,328
SUPPLIER AND THE UNITED STATES 

1210
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,665
IS A MAJOR OIL AND GAS POWER AS 

1211
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,934
WELL WE CAN WORK WITH THE 

1212
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:38,568
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BECAUSE 

1213
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:40,137
NEITHER OF US IS INTERESTED IN 

1214
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,605
THE PLUM YETING OF THE PRICES 

1215
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:44,642
AND THE CONSUMERS WILL SUFFER 

1216
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:45,976
AS WELL AND THE CONSUMERS IN 

1217
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:49,046
THE UNITED STATES WILL SUFFER 

1218
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,081
AS WELL AND THE GAS PRODUCTION 

1219
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,551
WILL SUFFER BECAUSE BEYOND A 

1220
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,219
SUDDEN PRICE BREAKUP IT'S NO 

1221
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,787
LONGER PROFITABLE TO PRODUCE 

1222
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,391
GAS BUT NOR WE ARE INTERESTED 

1223
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:04,395
IN DRIVING PRICES UP BECAUSE IT 

1224
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,130
WILL DRAIN JUICES FROM ALL 

1225
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,298
OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. 

1226
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,967
SO WE DO HAVE SPACE FOR 

1227
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,303
CORPORATION HERE IS THE FIRST 

1228
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:12,536
THING. 

1229
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:16,807
THEN ABOUT THE NORTH STREAM 

1230
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,007
TOO. 

1231
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,409
MR. PRESIDENT VOICED HIS 

1232
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,745
CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY 

1233
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,481
OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF 

1234
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,882
TRACTIONIT THROUGH I CRAIN AND 

1235
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:29,086
I REASSURED RUSSIA STANDS READY 

1236
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,286
TO MAINTAIN THIS TRANSIT. 

1237
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:37,928
MORE OVER TO EXTEND THIS 

1238
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:43,133
TRANSIT TO EXTEND NEXT YEAR. 

1239
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:49,006
THE DISPUTE WILL BE SETTLED IN 

1240
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,606
THE ARBITRATION COURT. 

1241
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:55,346
>> THE FIRST QUESTION TO JEFF 

1242
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:55,813
BASIN FROM REUTERS. 

1243
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:56,213
>> THANK YOU. 

1244
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,116
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU TWEETED THIS 

1245
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,484
MORNING THAT IT'S U.S. 

1246
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,720
FOOLISHNESS, STUPIDITY AND THE 

1247
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,487
MUELLER PROBE THAT IS 

1248
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:06,089
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DINE IN 

1249
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:07,324
U.S. RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. 

1250
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,959
DO YOU HOLD RUSSIA AT ALL 

1251
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,761
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANYTHING IN 

1252
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,229
PARTICULAR AND IF SO WHAT WOULD 

1253
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:15,065
YOU CONSIDER THEM THAT THEY ARE 

1254
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:15,465
RESPONSIBLE FOR? 

1255
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:17,735
>> YES I DO HOLD BOTH COUNTRIES 

1256
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:18,068
RESPONSIBLE. 

1257
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,703
I THINK THE UNITED STATES HAS 

1258
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,671
BLOOD PRESSURE FOOLISH. 

1259
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,940
I THINK WE HAVE ALL BEEN 

1260
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,440
FOOLISH. 

1261
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,975
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS 

1262
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,777
DIALOGUE A LONG TIME AGO, A 

1263
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,212
LONG TIME FRANKLY BEFORE I GOT 

1264
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,280
TO OFFICE AND I THINK WE ARE 

1265
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,647
ALL TO BLAME. 

1266
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:33,484
I THINK THAT THE UNITED STATES 

1267
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,685
NOW HAS STEPPED FORWARD ALONG 

1268
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,787
WITH RUSSIA AND WE ARE GETTING 

1269
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,323
TOGETHER AND WE HAVE A CHANCE 

1270
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:44,962
TO DO GREAT THINGS WHETHER IT'S 

1271
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,464
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION IN TERMS 

1272
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,164
OF STOPPING. 

1273
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:49,199
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 

1274
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:49,500
TO WORK ON. 

1275
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,703
I DO FEEL THAT WE HAVE BOTH 

1276
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:53,503
MADE SOME MISTAKES. 

1277
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:55,673
I THINK THAT THE PROBE IS A 

1278
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,573
DISASTER FOR OUR COUNTRY. 

1279
00:42:56,573 --> 00:43:00,043
I THINK IT'S KEPT US APART. 

1280
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:01,311
IT'S KEPT US SEPARATED. 

1281
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:03,714
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AT ALL. 

1282
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,749
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT AND PEOPLE 

1283
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,051
ARE BEING BROUGHT OUT TO THE 4. 

1284
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:10,153
SO FAR THAT I KNOW VIRTUALLY 

1285
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:11,689
NONE OF IT RELATED TO THE 

1286
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,124
CAMPAIGN AND THEY ARE GOING TO 

1287
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,326
HAVE TO TRY REALLY HARD TO FIND 

1288
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:19,463
SOMEBODY THAT DID RELATE TO THE 

1289
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:19,897
CAMPAIGN. 

1290
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,497
THAT WAS A CLEAN CAMPAIGN. 

1291
00:43:21,497 --> 00:43:22,833
I BEAT HILARY CLINTON EASILY 

1292
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,402
AND FRANKLY WE BEAT HER AND I'M 

1293
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,705
NOT EVEN SAYING FROM THE 

1294
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:28,005
STANDPOINT. 

1295
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:28,938
WE WON THAT RACE AND IT'S A 

1296
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:29,839
SHAME THERE COULD BE A LITTLE 

1297
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,708
BIT OF A CLOUD OVER IT. 

1298
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,010
PEOPLE KNOW THAT, PEOPLE 

1299
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,313
UNDERSTAND IT BUT THE MAIN 

1300
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:36,980
THING WE DISCUSSED IS ALSO ZERO 

1301
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,949
COLLUSION AND IT HAS HAD A 

1302
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:42,019
NEGATIVE IMPACT UPON THE 

1303
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,821
RELATIONSHIP OF THE TWO LARGEST 

1304
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:48,892
NUCLEAR POWERS IN THE WORLD. 

1305
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,028
WE HAVE 90% OF NUCLEAR POWER 

1306
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,228
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. 

1307
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:52,629
IT'S RIDICULOUS. 

1308
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:55,065
IT'S RIDICULOUS WHAT'S GOING ON 

1309
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:55,632
WITH THE PROBE. 

1310
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:59,402
>> PRESIDENT, IF I COULD FOLLOW 

1311
00:43:59,402 --> 00:43:59,736
UP AS WELL. 

1312
00:43:59,736 --> 00:44:01,472
WHY SHOULD AMERICANS AND WHY 

1313
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,140
SHOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVE 

1314
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,242
YOUR STATEMENT THAT RUSSIA DID 

1315
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,610
NOT INTERVENE IN THE 2016 

1316
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,213
ELECTION GIVEN THE EVIDENCE 

1317
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,715
THAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 

1318
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,517
HAVE PROVIDED AND WILL YOU 

1319
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,818
CONSIDER EXTRADITING THE 12 

1320
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,853
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS THAT WERE 

1321
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:16,353
INDICTED. 

1322
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,389
>> I'M GOING TO LET THE 

1323
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:20,591
PRESIDENT ANSWER THE SECOND 

1324
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:24,194
PART OF THAT QUESTION BUT AS 

1325
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,231
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE CONCEPT CAME 

1326
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:27,865
UP PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT BEFORE 

1327
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,801
BUT IT CAME OUT AS A REASON WHY 

1328
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,137
THE DEMOCRATS LOST AN ELECTION 

1329
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,205
WHICH FRANKLY THEY SHOULD HAVE 

1330
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,573
BEEN ABLE TO WIN BECAUSE IT'S 

1331
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,309
MUCH MORE AS YOU KNOW TO 

1332
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,379
DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS. 

1333
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,983
WE WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE BY 

1334
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:46,884
A LOT. 

1335
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,384
306 TO 223 I BELIEVE. 

1336
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:54,024
AND THAT WAS A WELL FOUGHT 

1337
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:54,257
BATTLE. 

1338
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:55,425
WE DID A GREAT JOB. 

1339
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:57,160
AND FRANKLY I'M GOING TO LET 

1340
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,897
THE PRESIDENT SPEAK TO THE 

1341
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,198
SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION 

1342
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,600
BUT TO SAY IT ONE TIME AGAIN 

1343
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,036
AND TO SAY IT ALL THE TIME. 

1344
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,571
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. 

1345
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,139
I DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT. 

1346
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,975
THERE WAS NOBODY TO CONCLUDE 

1347
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:12,175
WITH. 

1348
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:12,842
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION WITH THE 

1349
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:13,109
CAMPAIGN. 

1350
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:14,812
EVERY TIME YOU HEAR ALL OF 

1351
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,478
THESE 12 AND 14. 

1352
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:17,381
IT'S STUFF THAT HAS NOTHING TO 

1353
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,183
DO AND FRANKLY THEY ADMIT THESE 

1354
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,652
ARE NOT PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE 

1355
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,187
CAMPAIGN BUT TO THE AVERAGE 

1356
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,088
READER OUT THERE THEY ARE 

1357
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:27,391
SAYING WELL MAYBE THAT DOES. 

1358
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,528
IT DOESN'T ADD EVEN THE PEOPLE 

1359
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:32,930
INVOLVED SOME PERHAPS TOLD MISS 

1360
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,832
STORIES OR IN ONE CASE THE 

1361
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,632
F.B.I. 

1362
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,000
SAID THERE WAS NO LIE. 

1363
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,101
THERE WAS NO LIE. 

1364
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:40,971
SOMEBODY ELSE SAID THERE WAS. 

1365
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:45,008
WE RAN A BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN AND 

1366
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,445
THAT'S WHY I'M PRESIDENT. 

1367
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:48,745
THANK YOU. 

1368
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,446
>> AS TO WHO IS TO BE BELIEVED 

1369
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:54,718
AND WHO IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED, 

1370
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:58,889
YOU CAN TRUST NO ONE IF YOU 

1371
00:45:58,889 --> 00:45:59,356
TAKE THIS. 

1372
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,725
WHERE DID YOU GET THE IDEA THAT 

1373
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:07,297
PRESIDENT TRUMP TRUSTS ME OR I 

1374
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:07,597
TRUST HIM? 

1375
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:08,231
HE DEFENDS THE UNITED STATES OF 

1376
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:09,800
AMERICA AND I DO DEFEND THE 

1377
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,233
RUSSIAN FEDERATIO. 

1378
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:12,035
WE DO HAVE INTERESTS IN COMMON. 

1379
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:14,304
WE ARE LOOKING FOR POINTS OF 

1380
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:17,241
CONTACT. 

1381
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:17,808
THERE ARE ISSUES WHERE OUR 

1382
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,543
POSTURES DIVERGE AND WE ARE 

1383
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,478
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO RECONCILE 

1384
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:25,382
OUR DIFFERENCES, HOW TO MAKE 

1385
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,784
OUR EFFORT MORE MEANINGFUL. 

1386
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,387
WE SHOULD NOT PROCEED FROM THE 

1387
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,521
IMMEDIATE POLITICAL INTERESTS 

1388
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:33,123
THAT GUIDE CERTAIN POLITICAL 

1389
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,291
POWERS IN OUR COUNTRIES. 

1390
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,593
WE SHOULD BE GUIDED BY EFFECTS. 

1391
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:44,033
COULD YOU NAME A SINGLE FACT 

1392
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:49,606
THAT WHAT DEFINITIVELY PROVE 

1393
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:50,640
THE COLLUSION. 

1394
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,074
THIS IS NONSENSE. 

1395
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,111
JUST LIKE THE PRESIDENT 

1396
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,512
RECENTLY MENTIONED THE AT LARGE 

1397
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,714
UNITED STATES HAD A PERCEIVED 

1398
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,049
CANDIDATE DURING THE CAMPAIGN 

1399
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,218
BUT THERE IS NOTHING 

1400
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,085
PARTICULARLY EXTRAORDINARY 

1401
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:02,685
ABOUT IT. 

1402
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:03,420
THAT'S THE USUAL THING. 

1403
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,389
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE WAS A 

1404
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,291
CANDIDATE HE MENTIONED THE NEED 

1405
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,494
TO RESTORE THE RUSSIA U.S. 

1406
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,094
RELATIONSHIP AND IT'S CLEAR 

1407
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:15,465
THAT CERTAIN PART OF AMERICAN 

1408
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,166
SOCIETY FELT SYMPATHETIC ABOUT 

1409
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,101
IT AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE COULD 

1410
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,037
EXPRESS THEIR SYMPATHY IN 

1411
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,238
DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ISN'T THAT 

1412
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:22,505
NATURAL? 

1413
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:24,708
ISN'T IT NATURAL TO BE 

1414
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,276
SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS THE PERSON 

1415
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:27,177
WILLING TO RESTORE THE 

1416
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,212
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR COUNTRY 

1417
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:30,780
WHO WANTS TO WORK WITH US? 

1418
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,183
WE HEARD THE ACCUSATIONS ABOUT 

1419
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:33,349
IT. 

1420
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:36,086
AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS COMPANY 

1421
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,455
HIRED AMERICAN LAWYERS AND THE 

1422
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,458
ACCUSATIONS DOESN'T HAVE A 

1423
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,825
FIGHTING CHANCE IN THE AMERICAN 

1424
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:43,059
COURTS. 

1425
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,728
SO THERE'S NO EVIDENCE WHEN IT 

1426
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:46,696
COMES TO THE ACTUAL FACTS SO WE 

1427
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:50,033
HAVE TO BE GUIDED BY FACTS NOT 

1428
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:50,333
BY RUMORS. 

1429
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:54,303
NOW LET'S GET BACK TO THIS 12 

1430
00:47:54,303 --> 00:47:55,806
ALLEGED INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS 

1431
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:56,106
OF RUSSIA. 

1432
00:47:56,106 --> 00:48:00,043
I DON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF 

1433
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,044
THE SITUATION BUT PRESIDENT 

1434
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,480
TRUMP MENTIONED THIS ISSUE AND 

1435
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,481
I WILL LOOK INTO IT. 

1436
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:07,517
SO FAR I CAN SAY THE FOLLOWING. 

1437
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,721
THE THINGS THAT OFF THE TOP OF 

1438
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,622
MY HEAD, WE HAVE ENACTED AN 

1439
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:15,292
EXISTING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 

1440
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,161
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND 

1441
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:22,099
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION DISTANT 

1442
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:27,504
TREATY THAT DATES BACK TO 1999 

1443
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,071
THAT MUTUAL ASSISTANCE ON 

1444
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,908
CRIMINAL CASES THIS TREATY IS 

1445
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:36,613
IN FULL EFFECT. 

1446
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,748
IT WORKS QUITE EFFICIENTLY. 

1447
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,618
ON AVERAGE WE INITIATE ABOUT 

1448
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:42,853
150 CRIMINAL CASES UPON REQUEST 

1449
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,754
FROM THE UNITED STATES. 

1450
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:47,624
FOR INSTANCE LAST YEAR THERE 

1451
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,093
WAS ONE EXTRADITION CASE UPON 

1452
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,531
REQUEST SENT BY THE UNITED 

1453
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:54,765
STATES. 

1454
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:59,569
SO THIS TREATY HAS SPECIFIC 

1455
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:04,975
LEGAL PROCEDURES WE CAN OFFER 

1456
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:11,048
THAT THE APPROPRIATE COMMISSION 

1457
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,083
HEADED BY SPECIAL MUELLER HE 

1458
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,218
CAN USE THIS FORMAL OFFICIAL 

1459
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:18,688
REQUEST TO US SO THAT WE WOULD 

1460
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:22,392
INFOBLOX BETTER GAIT, WE WOULD 

1461
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:27,097
HOLD THE QUESTIONING OF THESE 

1462
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:27,731
INDIVIDUALS WHO HE BELIEVES ARE 

1463
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:33,870
A PREVIEW TO SOME CRIMES AND 

1464
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:34,871
OUR ENFORCEMENT ARE PERFECTLY 

1465
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,807
ABLE TO DO THIS QUESTIONING AND 

1466
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,542
SEND THE MATERIAL TEASE THE 

1467
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:39,209
UNITED STATES. 

1468
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,511
MORE OVER WE CAN MEET YOU 

1469
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:45,182
HALFWAY AND MAKE ANOTHER STEP. 

1470
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:45,782
CAN ACTUALLY PERMIT OFFICIAL 

1471
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:46,416
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED 

1472
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:51,154
STATES INCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF 

1473
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,822
THIS VERY COMMISSION HEADED BY 

1474
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:54,825
MR. MUELLER WE CAN LEAD INTO 

1475
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,959
THE COUNTRY AND PRESENT WITH 

1476
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,596
QUESTIONING BUT IN THIS CASE 

1477
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,531
THERE IS ANOTHER CONDITION. 

1478
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,034
THIS KIND OF EFFORT SHOULD BE A 

1479
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:04,968
MUTUAL ONE. 

1480
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,437
THEN WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE 

1481
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:08,939
AMERICANS WOULD RECIPROCATE AND 

1482
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:13,175
THEY WOULD QUESTION OFFICIALS 

1483
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:13,776
INCLUDING THE OFFICERS OF LAW 

1484
00:50:13,776 --> 00:50:14,377
ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE 

1485
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:17,080
SERVICES OF THE UNITED STATES 

1486
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,149
WHOM WE BELIEVE ARE WHO HAVE 

1487
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,717
SOMETHING TO DO WITH ILLEGAL 

1488
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:23,920
ACTIONS ON THE TERRITORY OF 

1489
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,990
RUSSIA AND WE HAVE TO REQUEST 

1490
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,161
THE PRESENCE OF OUR LAW 

1491
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:31,828
ENFORCEMENT. 

1492
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,699
FOR INSTANCE WE CAN BRING UP 

1493
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,768
THE MR. BROWNER IN THIS 

1494
00:50:38,768 --> 00:50:39,168
PARTICULAR CASE. 

1495
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:42,639
ASSOCIATES OF MR. BROWNER HAVE 

1496
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,942
EARNED OVER $1.5 MILLION IN 

1497
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:46,175
RUSSIA. 

1498
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:48,979
THEY NEVER PAID ANY TAXES 

1499
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,146
NEITHER IN RUSSIA OR THE UNITED 

1500
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:52,782
STATES AND YET THE MONEY 

1501
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:54,484
ESCAPED THE COUNTRY. 

1502
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,084
THEY WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE 

1503
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:55,451
UNITED STATES. 

1504
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:59,556
THEY SENT A HUGE AMOUNT OF 

1505
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,791
MONEY, $400 MILLION AS A 

1506
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,459
CONTRIBUTION TO THE CAMPAIGN OF 

1507
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,225
HILARY CLINTON. 

1508
00:51:03,225 --> 00:51:03,994
WELL THAT'S THEIR PERSONAL 

1509
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,763
CASE, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEGAL. 

1510
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:07,664
THE CONTRIBUTION ITSELF, BUT 

1511
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,167
THE WAY THE MONEY WAS EARNED 

1512
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:10,700
WAS ILLEGAL. 

1513
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,838
SO WE HAVE A SOLID REASON TO 

1514
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,173
BELIEVE THAT SOME INTELLIGENCE 

1515
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,442
OFFICERS THE COMPANY GUIDED 

1516
00:51:19,442 --> 00:51:21,178
THESE TRANSACTIONS SO WE HAVE 

1517
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:21,745
AN INTEREST OF QUESTIONING 

1518
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:21,945
THAT. 

1519
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,781
THAT COULD BE THE FIRST STEP 

1520
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:28,217
AND WE CAN ALSO EXTEND IT. 

1521
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:33,390
OPTIONS ARE BOUND AND THEY ALL 

1522
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,024
CAN BE FOUND IN AN APPROPRIATE 

1523
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:34,424
LEGAL FRAMEWORK. 

1524
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,726
>> DID YOU DIRECT ANY OF YOUR 

1525
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:40,597
OFFICIALS TO HELP HIM DO THAT? 

1526
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,132
>> YES, I DID. 

1527
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,500
BECAUSE HE TALKED ABOUT 

1528
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:48,872
BRINGING THE RIGHT U.S. RUSSIA 

1529
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,674
RELATIONSHIP BACK TO NORMAL I 

1530
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:54,377
THINK THERE CAN BE THREE 

1531
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:55,011
QUESTIONS FROM THE RUSSIAN PULL 

1532
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,248
TODAY YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. 

1533
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:03,053
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

1534
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:08,592
GOOD EVENING TO EVERYONE. 

1535
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:08,992
MY NAME IS. 

1536
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:09,258
RT, T.V. 

1537
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:09,525
CHANNEL. 

1538
00:52:09,525 --> 00:52:11,294
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU 

1539
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,598
PLEASE GO INTO THE DETAILS OF 

1540
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:16,199
POSSIBLY ANY SPECIFIC 

1541
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,068
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE U.S. TO 

1542
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:23,540
WORK TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA IN 

1543
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,575
SYRIA IF ANY OF THESE KIND OF 

1544
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:37,854
ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TODAY OR 

1545
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:45,462
DISCUSSED.

1546
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:55,205
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

1547
00:52:55,205 --> 00:53:00,510
>> IS IT TRUE AND HOW WOULD YOU 

1548
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,144
USE THIS FACT? 

1549
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,213
>> WELL I GUESS I'LL ANSWER THE 

1550
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,248
FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION. 

1551
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,017
WE'VE WORKED WITH ISRAEL LONG 

1552
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,353
AND HARD FOR MANY YEARS, MANY 

1553
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:10,954
DECADES. 

1554
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,221
I THINK NEVER HAS ANYONE ANY 

1555
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:15,357
COUNTRY BEEN CLOSER THAN WE 

1556
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:15,558
ARE. 

1557
00:53:15,558 --> 00:53:18,327
PRESIDENT PUTIN ALSO IS HELPING 

1558
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:21,898
ISRAEL AND WE BOTH SPOKE WITH 

1559
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,700
AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO 

1560
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,734
CERTAIN THINGS WITH RESPECT TO 

1561
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,637
SYRIA HAVING TO DO WITH THE 

1562
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,771
SAFETY OF ISRAEL. 

1563
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:30,607
SO IN THAT RESPECT WE 

1564
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,475
ABSOLUTELY WOULD LIKE TO WORK 

1565
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:34,944
IN ORDER TO HELP ISRAEL AND 

1566
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:37,814
ISRAEL WOULD BE WORKING WITH US 

1567
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,949
SO BOTH COUNTRIES WOULD BE 

1568
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:40,350
WORKING JOINTLY. 

1569
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,818
AND I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT 

1570
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,220
ALL OF THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN 

1571
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,759
MADE IN CERTAIN SECTIONS WITH 

1572
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:50,994
THE ERAD OCCASION OF ISIS ABOUT 

1573
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:51,895
99% INTEREST AND OTHER THINGS 

1574
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,630
HAVE TAKEN PLACE THAT WE'VE 

1575
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,966
DONE AND FRANKLY RUSSIA HAS 

1576
00:53:56,966 --> 00:53:57,867
HELPED US WITH CERTAIN RESPECTS 

1577
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,270
BUT I THINK WORKING WITH ISRAEL 

1578
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,573
IS A GREAT THING AND CREATING 

1579
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,207
SAFETY FOR ISRAEL IS SOMETHING 

1580
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,441
THAT BOTH PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I 

1581
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:07,477
WOULD LIKE TO SEE VERY MUCH. 

1582
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,779
ONE LITTLE THING I MIGHT ADD TO 

1583
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:16,886
THAT IS THE HELPING OF PEOPLE. 

1584
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:17,353
HELPING OF PEOPLE. 

1585
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:19,989
YOU HAVE SUCH HORRIBLE--I'VE 

1586
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:20,657
SEEN REPORTS AND I'VE SEEN 

1587
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,525
PICTURES, I'VE SEEN JUST ABOUT 

1588
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:23,326
EVERYTHING. 

1589
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,862
AND IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO 

1590
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,631
HELP THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA GET 

1591
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:33,236
BACK INTO SOME FORM OF SHELTER 

1592
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,170
AND ON A HUMANITARIAN BASIS 

1593
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,672
THAT'S WHAT THE WORD WAS 

1594
00:54:36,672 --> 00:54:38,742
REALLY, A HUE PLANTAIN BASIS 

1595
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,810
BOTH OF US WOULD BE VERY 

1596
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:41,710
INTERESTED IN DOING THAT AND WE 

1597
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:42,612
WILL DO THAT. 

1598
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,347
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1599
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:47,450
>> EXCUSE ME, BUT FOR NOW NO 

1600
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,219
SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS FOR 

1601
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,453
INSTANCE BETWEEN THE 

1602
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:50,753
MILITARIES? 

1603
00:54:50,753 --> 00:54:54,323
>> OUR MILITARIES DO GET ALONG. 

1604
00:54:54,323 --> 00:54:55,258
OUR MILITARIES HAVE GOTTEN 

1605
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,460
ALONG BETTER THAN OUR POLITICAL 

1606
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,497
LEADERS FOR YEARS BUT THEY DO 

1607
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:06,469
COORDINATE IN SYRIA AND OTHER 

1608
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:06,702
PLACES. 

1609
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:06,902
OKAY? 

1610
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:07,203
THANK YOU. 

1611
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:11,675
>> YES, WE DID MENTION THIS. 

1612
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,777
WE MENTIONED THE HUMANITARIAN 

1613
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:15,545
TRACK OF THIS ISSUE. 

1614
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:19,816
YESTERDAY I DISCUSSED THIS WITH 

1615
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,117
FRENCH PRESIDENT MR. MACRON AND 

1616
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:25,121
WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT THAT 

1617
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:25,621
TOGETHER WITH EUROPEAN 

1618
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:26,589
COUNTRIES INCLUDING FRANCE WE 

1619
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,726
WILL STEP UP THIS EFFORT AND ON 

1620
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,996
OUR BEHALF WE PROVIDE MILITARY 

1621
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,265
CARGO AIRCRAFT TO DELIVER THE 

1622
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:35,865
HUMANITARIAN CARGO. 

1623
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,134
TODAY I BROUGHT UP THIS WITH 

1624
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:38,934
ISSUE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

1625
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:40,970
I THINK THERE IS PLENTY OF 

1626
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,071
THINGS TO LOOK INTO. 

1627
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:44,407
THE CRUCIAL THING IS THAT A 

1628
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:49,245
HUGE AMOUNT OF REFUGEES ARE IN 

1629
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:49,979
TURKEY, IN LEBANON, IN JORDAN 

1630
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:53,683
IN THE STATES THAT BORDER, ARE 

1631
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,685
ADJACENT TO SYRIA. 

1632
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,254
IF WE HELP THEM, THE PRESSURE 

1633
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,423
UPON THE EUROPEAN STATES WILL 

1634
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,625
DROP, WILL BE DECREASED MANY 

1635
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,493
FOLD AND I BELIEVE IT'S CRUCIAL 

1636
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:06,830
FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW FROM A 

1637
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,797
HUMANITARIAN POINT OF VIEW, 

1638
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:12,502
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF 

1639
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,670
HELPING PEOPLE, HELPING 

1640
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,939
REFUGEES AND IN GENERAL, I 

1641
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,141
AGREE, ICON CONFER WITH 

1642
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,810
PRESIDENT TRUMP OUR MILITARY IS 

1643
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:21,377
QUITE SUCCESSFUL TOGETHER. 

1644
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:22,212
THEY DO GET ALONG AND I HOPE 

1645
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,048
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN 

1646
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:25,682
THE FUTURE. 

1647
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,584
WE WILL KEEP WORKING IN THE 

1648
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,853
FORMAT OF RUSSIA, TURKEY AND 

1649
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:37,660
IRAN WHICH I INFORMED PRESIDENT 

1650
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:37,993
TRUMP ABOUT. 

1651
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:40,830
BUT WE DO SEND READY TO LINK 

1652
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,365
THE EFFORTS TO THE SO-CALLED 

1653
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,867
SMALL GROUP OF STATES SO THAT 

1654
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,470
THE PROCESS WOULD BE A BROADER 

1655
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,938
ONE, A MULTI DIMENSIONAL ONE. 

1656
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:52,442
AND SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO 

1657
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,743
MAXIMIZE OUR FIGHTING CHANCE TO 

1658
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:59,382
GET THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS IN THE 

1659
00:56:59,382 --> 00:56:59,849
ISSUE OF SYRIA. 

1660
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,852
AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE HAVING 

1661
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,955
THE CORD IN SYRIA, PRESIDENT 

1662
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:15,098
TRUMP HAS JUST MENTIONED THAT 

1663
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,265
WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED 

1664
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:16,866

1665
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:17,399

WE DO HOST IT AND WE HOPE WE DO

1676
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,116
THAT'S VERY NICE. 

1677
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,085

[LAUGHTER] 

1681
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,425

00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:52,268
UNITED STATES WILL GO TO 

1683
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:57,040
JONATHAN FROM THE AP.

1684
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,208
>> THANK YOU. 

1685
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,476
QUESTION FOR EACH PRESIDENT. 

1686
00:58:00,476 --> 00:58:00,976
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

1687
00:58:00,976 --> 00:58:01,711
YOU FIRST. 

1688
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,913
JUST NOTCH PRESIDENT PUTIN 

1689
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:04,681
DENIED HAVING ANYTHING TO DO 

1690
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:07,016
WITH THE ELECTION INTERFERENCE 

1691
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:07,282
IN 2016. 

1692
00:58:07,282 --> 00:58:09,686
EVERY U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 

1693
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:10,920
HAS CONCLUDED THAT RUSSIA DID. 

1694
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,123
MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU SIR 

1695
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,257
IS WHO DO YOU BELIEVE? 

1696
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:16,759
MY SECOND QUESTION IS WOULD YOU 

1697
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:20,296
NOW WITH THE WHOLE WORLD 

1698
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,198
WATCHING TELL PRESIDENT PUTIN 

1699
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,933
YOU DENOUNCE WHAT HAPPENED IN 

1700
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,501
2016 OR WARN HIM TO NEVER DO IT 

1701
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:25,868
AGAIN. 

1702
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:29,672
>> LET ME JUST SAY WE HAVE TWO 

1703
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:36,311
THOUGHTS TWO GROUPS WONDERING 

1704
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:37,013
WHY THE F.B.I. 

1705
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:37,546
HAVEN'T TAKEN THE SERVER. 

1706
00:58:37,546 --> 00:58:37,980
WHY WAS THE F.B.I. 

1707
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,549
TOLD TO LEAVE THE OFFICE OF THE 

1708
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:40,216
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE. 

1709
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,517
I'VE BEEN WONDERING THAT AND 

1710
00:58:41,517 --> 00:58:43,286
ASKING THAT FOR MONTHS AND 

1711
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,520
MONTHS AND I'VE BEEN TWEETING 

1712
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,056
IT OUT AND CALLING IT OUT ON 

1713
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:47,490
SOCIAL MEDIA. 

1714
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,192
WHERE IS THE SERVER I WANT TO 

1715
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,894
KNOW AND WHAT IS THE SERVER 

1716
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:52,595
SAYING? 

1717
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,163
WITH THAT BEING SAID ALL I CAN 

1718
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:57,966
DO IS ASK THE QUESTION. 

1719
00:58:57,966 --> 00:58:58,467
MY PEOPLE CAME TO ME. 

1720
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:01,170
DAN COATS SAME TO ME AND OTHERS 

1721
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,838
SAID THEY THINK IT'S RUSSIA. 

1722
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:04,941
I HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN WHO JUST 

1723
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,242
SAID IT'S NOT RUSSIA. 

1724
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,610
I WILL SAY THIS, I DON'T SEE 

1725
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,379
ANY REASON WHY IT WOULD BE BUT 

1726
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:14,616
I REALLY DO WANT TO SEEP THE 

1727
00:59:14,616 --> 00:59:14,950
SERVE SERVER. 

1728
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,286
BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN BOTH 

1729
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:17,553
PARTIES. 

1730
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:18,855
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL 

1731
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,223
PROBABLY GO ON FOR A WHILE BUT 

1732
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,525
I DON'T THINK IT CAN GO ON 

1733
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:24,527
WITHOUT FINDING OUT WHAT 

1734
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,462
HAPPENED TO THE SERVER? 

1735
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:32,702
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SERVERS OF 

1736
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,971
THE PAKISTANI GENTLEMAN WHO 

1737
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,105
WORKED ON THE DNC. 

1738
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,006
WHERE ARE THEY? 

1739
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,909
WHAT HAPPENED TO HILARY 

1740
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,344
CLINTON'S E-MAILS? 

1741
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:43,011
33,000 E-MAILS GONE, JUST GONE. 

1742
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:44,747
I THINK IN RUSSIA THEY WOULDN'T 

1743
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,748
BE GONE SO EASILY. 

1744
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,317
I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE THAT WE 

1745
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:50,286
CAN'T GET HILARY CLINTON'S 

1746
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:50,686
33,000 E-MAILS. 

1747
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:52,655
I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN MY 

1748
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,891
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE BUT I WILL 

1749
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,427
TELL YOU THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN 

1750
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,394
WAS EXTREMELY STRONG AND 

1751
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,396
POWERFUL IN HIS DENIAL TODAY 

1752
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,999
AND WHAT HE DID IS AN 

1753
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:03,432
INCREDIBLE OFFER. 

1754
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:06,903
HE OFFERED TO HAVE THE PEOPLE 

1755
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:07,770
WORKING ON THE CASE COME AND 

1756
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,605
WORK WITH THEIR INVESTIGATORS 

1757
01:00:09,605 --> 01:00:11,273
WITH RESPECT TO THE 12 PEOPLE. 

1758
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:17,113
I THINK THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE 

1759
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:17,346
OFFER. 

1760
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:17,546
OKAY? 

1761
01:00:17,546 --> 01:00:17,847
THANK YOU. 

1762
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,116
>> I'D LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING TO 

1763
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:20,316
THIS. 

1764
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:26,389
AFTER ALL I WAS AN INTELLIGENCE 

1765
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:26,756
OFFICER MYSELF. 

1766
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:31,527
AND I DO KNOW HOW IT'S MADE UP. 

1767
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,294
JUST A SECOND. 

1768
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:37,967
JUST THE FIRST THING NOT THE 

1769
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:38,868
SECOND THING I BELIEVE THAT 

1770
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,636
RUSSIA IS A DEMOCRATIC STATE 

1771
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:42,972
AND I HOPE YOU ARE NOT DENYING 

1772
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,707
THIS RIGHT TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY. 

1773
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:46,709
YOU ARE NOT DENYING THAT THE 

1774
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,277
UNITED STATES IS A DEMOCRACY. 

1775
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,012
DO YOU BELIEVE THE UNITED 

1776
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:51,280
STATES IS A DEMOCRACY? 

1777
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,750
AND IF SO, IF IT IS A 

1778
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,718
DEMOCRATIC STATE THEN IT THE 

1779
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,520
FINAL CONCLUSION AND THIS KIND 

1780
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,321
OF A DISPUTE CAN ONLY BE 

1781
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:04,460
DELIVERED BY A TRIAL BY THE 

1782
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:04,761
COURT. 

1783
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,898
NOT BY THE EXECUTIVE BY THE LAW 

1784
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:09,231
ENFORCEMENT. 

1785
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:09,765
FOR INSTANCE, THE CONCORD 

1786
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:13,503
COMPANY THAT WAS BROUGHT IS 

1787
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:18,007
BEING ACCUSED, IT'S BEING 

1788
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,041
ACCUSED OF INTERFERENCE BUT 

1789
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,343
THIS COMPANY DOES NOT REPRESENT 

1790
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:25,114
THE RUSSIAN STATE AND I BROUGHT 

1791
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:25,647
SEVERAL EXAMPLES BEFORE. 

1792
01:01:25,647 --> 01:01:27,917
WELL YOU HAVE A LOT OF 

1793
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,985
INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED 

1794
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:32,188
STATES TAKE GEORGE SUAREZ FOR 

1795
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,023
INSTANCE WITH MULTI BILLION 

1796
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,459
CAPITALS BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE 

1797
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,828
HIM--HIS POSTURE, THE POSTURE 

1798
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:39,495
OF THE UNITED STATES. 

1799
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:43,699
NO, IT DOES NOT. 

1800
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:44,333
IT'S THE SAME CASE. 

1801
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,171
MR. IS BISHOP TRYING THE CASE 

1802
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:51,374
IN THE COURT AND THE FINAL SAY 

1803
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,142
IS FOR THE COURT TO DELIVER. 

1804
01:01:54,142 --> 01:01:56,479
WE ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT THE 

1805
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,580
PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND NOT 

1806
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,149
ABOUT PARTICULAR STATES AND AS 

1807
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:01,750
FAR AS THE MOST RECENT 

1808
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,453
ALLEGATION IS CONCERNED ABOUT 

1809
01:02:04,453 --> 01:02:06,622
THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE 

1810
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:10,126
OFFICERS WE DO HAVE A 

1811
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:10,593
GOVERNMENTAL TREATY. 

1812
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:13,595
PLEASE DO SEND US THE REQUEST. 

1813
01:02:13,595 --> 01:02:15,298
WE WILL ANALYZE IT PROPERLY AND 

1814
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:19,468
WE'LL SEND A FORMAL RESPONSE 

1815
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:20,670
AND AS I SAID WE CAN EXTEND 

1816
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,773
THIS CORPORATION BUT WE SHOULD 

1817
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,474
DO IT ON A RECIPROCAL BASIS 

1818
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:28,878
BECAUSE PROVIDING US ACCESS TO 

1819
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:31,781
THE PERSONS OF INTEREST FOR US 

1820
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:32,782
WHO WE BELIEVE CAN HAVE 

1821
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:37,286
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 

1822
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:37,619
INTELLIGENCE. 

1823
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:38,187
LET'S DISCUSS THE SPECIFIC 

1824
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,156
ISSUES AND NOT USE THE RUSSIA 

1825
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,960
AND U.S. RELATIONSHIP AS LOOSE 

1826
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,494
CHANGE FOR THE INTERNAL 

1827
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:44,961
POLITICAL STRUGGLE. 

1828
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:48,230
>> A QUESTION FOR PRESIDENT 

1829
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,464
PUTIN. 

1830
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:48,764
THANK YOU. 

1831
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:49,398
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU, SIR. 

1832
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,467
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT PRESIDENT 

1833
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:55,304
TRUMP MAY HAVE INDICATED TO YOU 

1834
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,240
ABOUT OFFICIALY PROSING CRIMA 

1835
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,643
AS PART OF RUSSIA AND SECONDLY, 

1836
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,746
SIR, DOES THE RUSSIAN 

1837
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:04,346
GOVERNMENT HAVE COMPROMISING 

1838
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:13,823
MATERIAL ON PRESIDENT TRUMP OR 

1839
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,592
HIS FAMILY? 

1840
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:17,026
[LAUGHTER] 

1841
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:24,233
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CRIMEA 

1842
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,869
IS WELL KNOWN AND EXTENSIVE, 

1843
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:32,909
FIRMLY WHY LEA CONTINUED TO 

1844
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:33,543
MAINTAIN THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL TO-

1845
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,244
-OUR VIEW POINT IS DIFFERENT. 

1846
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,113
WE HELD A REFERENDUM IN 

1847
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,148
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UN CHARTER 

1848
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:39,715
AND NATIONAL LEGISLATION. 

1849
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:45,288
FOR US WE PUT PACE TO THIS 

1850
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:45,855
ISSUE. 

1851
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:46,789
AND NOW TO THE COMPROMISING 

1852
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:47,423
MATERIAL. 

1853
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:51,060
YEAH I DID HEAR THE RUMORS THAT 

1854
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,160
WE ALLEGEDLY COLLECTED 

1855
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,333
COMPROMISING MATERIAL AND MR. 

1856
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,567
TRUMP WHEN HE WAS VISITING MOSS 

1857
01:03:58,567 --> 01:03:58,800
CORPS. 

1858
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,935
A DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE LET 

1859
01:03:59,935 --> 01:04:01,604
ME TELL YOU THIS. 

1860
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,939
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN 

1861
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,608
MOSCOW I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. 

1862
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,944
I TREATED PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH 

1863
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:11,647
UTMOST RESPECT BUT BACK THEN 

1864
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:15,418
WHEN HE WAS A PRIVATE 

1865
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:15,951
INDIVIDUAL, A BUSINESSMAN 

1866
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:18,721
NOBODY INFORMED ME HE WAS IN 

1867
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:19,221
MOSCOW. 

1868
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:20,489
LET'S TAKE A PRESIDENTIAL 

1869
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,391
CONFIRM THERE WERE 500 AMERICAN 

1870
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,726
BUSINESS MEN THE HIGH LEVEL 

1871
01:04:24,726 --> 01:04:25,794
ONES I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE 

1872
01:04:25,794 --> 01:04:27,396
LAST NAMES OF EACH AND EVERY 

1873
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,898
ONE OF THEM. 

1874
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,968
DO YOU THINK WE TRIED TO 

1875
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,502
COLLECT COMPROMISING MATERIAL 

1876
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:38,974
FROM EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM? 

1877
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:39,575
IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE NOT 

1878
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,777
IN NONSENSE OF A BIGGER SCALE 

1879
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:43,412
THAT BE THIS. 

1880
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:46,615
WELL PLEASE JUST DISREGARD 

1881
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:47,182
THESE EASTBOUNDS AND DON'T 

1882
01:04:47,182 --> 01:04:47,782
THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE AGAIN. 

1883
01:04:47,782 --> 01:04:51,520
>> AND I HAVE TO SAY IF THEY 

1884
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,456
HAD IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT 

1885
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,757
LONG AGO AND IF ANYBODY WATCHED 

1886
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:56,125
PETER STRUCK TESTIFY OVER THE 

1887
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,293
PAST COUPLE DAYS AND I WAS IN 

1888
01:04:58,293 --> 01:05:00,629
BRUSSELS WATCHING IT IT WAS A 

1889
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:02,231
DISGRACE TO THE F.B.I., IT WAS 

1890
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,733
A DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY AND 

1891
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,701
YOU WOULD SAY THAT'S A TOTAL 

1892
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:06,769
WITCH HUNT. 

1893
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:13,242
THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY. 

1894
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:13,542
THANK YOU. 

1895
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,613
>>>  WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT A 

1896
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:18,614
HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN 

1897
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,116
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 

1898
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,185
PUTIN IN WHICH THE UNITED 

1899
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:24,220
STATES PRESIDENT WAS ASKED 

1900
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,587
REPEATEDLY TO DENOUNCE RUSSIA'S 

1901
01:05:25,587 --> 01:05:28,391
ACTIONS IN THE 2016 ELECTION 

1902
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,760
AND THE ACTIONS RUSSIA IS 

1903
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,895
CURRENTLY CARRYING OUT 

1904
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,497
ACCORDING TO OUR OWN U.S. 

1905
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,130
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. 

1906
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,632
HE CHOSE TO ATTACK HIS OWN 

1907
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,367
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 

1908
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,436
AND CONTINUE TO RAISE CLAIMS 

1909
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,337
HE'S MADE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 

1910
01:05:42,337 --> 01:05:46,075
MAJOR GARRETT IS OUR CHIEF 

1911
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:49,712
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT ALSO 

1912
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:49,912
HERE. 

1913
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:51,146
MAJOR WHERE SHOULD WE START? 

1914
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:53,215
>> WELL WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS 

1915
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,484
HE HAS CONFIDENCE IN 

1916
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,655
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND SAYS 

1917
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:00,255
RUSSIA DENIES MEDDLING IN THE 

1918
01:06:00,255 --> 01:06:01,023
2016 ELECTION AND I WONDER WHY 

1919
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:02,758
IT WON MEDDLING IN THE 2016 

1920
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:03,025
ELECTION. 

1921
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,728
THOSE ANSWERS IN NO WAY LINE UP 

1922
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:06,528
WITH ONE ANOTHER. 

1923
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:09,265
YOU CANNOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 

1924
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,400
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 

1925
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,371
WHO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION 

1926
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:20,009
UNIFORMLY AND SAY RUSSIA DENIES 

1927
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:20,175
IT. 

1928
01:06:20,175 --> 01:06:20,776
THEY ARE UTTERLY INCOMPATIBLE 

1929
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:21,710
AND THIS WAS AND PRESIDENT 

1930
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:25,481
TRUMP KNEW IT GOING IN HIS BEST 

1931
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,182
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY TO RUSSIAN 

1932
01:06:27,182 --> 01:06:28,517
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 

1933
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,586
THE WORLD I DENOUNCE YOU AND 

1934
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:31,787
DON'T DO IT AGAIN. 

1935
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,589
GIVEN THAT GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY 

1936
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,291
YOU LET IT PASS. 

1937
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,091
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

1938
01:06:36,091 --> 01:06:39,561
I MEAN ONE OF THE WAYS I LOOKED 

1939
01:06:39,561 --> 01:06:41,062
AT THIS SUMMIT COMING INTO IT 

1940
01:06:41,062 --> 01:06:42,865
IS WONDERING WHETHER THERE 

1941
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,066
WOULD BE A CONFRONTATION AND 

1942
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,534
AFTER WATCHING ALL OF THIS IT 

1943
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:48,771
SEEMS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A CON 

1944
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:49,771
FILLATION BETWEEN THESE TWO 

1945
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:50,038
LEADERS. 

1946
01:06:50,038 --> 01:06:51,974
THEY WERE CHUMMY AS IF THEY 

1947
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:52,808
WERE ALLIES THE WAY THEY TALKED 

1948
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,810
ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AND THE WAY 

1949
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:57,546
THEY WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD IN 

1950
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:58,114
THE FUTURE. 

1951
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:01,116
>> AND ONE THING THAT IS WORTH 

1952
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:01,750
POINTING OUT THIS WAS A PRESS 

1953
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,320
CONFERENCE OUTSIDE OF THE ISSUE 

1954
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,955
OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE 2016 

1955
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,857
ELECTION AND WHAT HAS ALREADY 

1956
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,692
BEEN ALLEGED ABOUT 2018 THIS 

1957
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,127
WAS A PRESS CONFERENCE OF 

1958
01:07:12,127 --> 01:07:13,829
MATTEDS ABOUT FUTURE 

1959
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,498
COOPERATION AND NOTHING 

1960
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:16,799
MEANINGFUL ABOUT ANY HOT BUTTON 

1961
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,201
FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE FOR EITHER 

1962
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:19,468
COUNTRY. 

1963
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,669
NO CONCESSINS FROM THE 

1964
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:24,240
AMERICAN PRESIDENT OBAMA THE 

1965
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,075
BALTIC STATES OR CRIMEA. 

1966
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:30,179
NO CONCESSIONS ON SYRIA AND 

1967
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,882
VAGUE OFFERING TO ASSIST IN 

1968
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:33,215
CONFLICT. 

1969
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,017
BUT THOSE EUROPEAN ALLIES WHO 

1970
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:38,654
WERE AFRAID MIGHT DRIVE A HARD 

1971
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,322
BARGAIN AND EXTRACT CONCESSIONS 

1972
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,957
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE WAS NO 

1973
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:45,127
EVIDENCE OF THAT WHAT SO EVER. 

1974
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,562
THIS REACHED NO DISCERNIBLE 

1975
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,798
RESOLUTION AND THE TWO NATIONS 

1976
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:50,833
LEAVE ESSENTIALLY WHERE THEY 

1977
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,735
ENTER, MORE DIALOGUE BUT NO NEW 

1978
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:56,472
MOVEMENT IN EITHER DIRECTION. 

1979
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,306
>> ALL RIGHT MAJOR GARRETT 

1980
01:07:58,306 --> 01:07:58,707
HERE. 

1981
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,609
I WANT TO SEND IT BACK NOW TO 

1982
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:03,512
GAYLE AND JOHN IN NEW YORK. 

1983
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:03,913
JOHN? 

1984
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:08,450
>> ALL RIGHT NORAH, THANK YOU. 

1985
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:09,718
THAT WAS APP PRODUCT NATURE 

1986
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:10,118
PRESS CONFERENCE. 

1987
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:11,720
FIRST IT STRUCK ME YESTERDAY 

1988
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,755
THE U.S. EMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA 

1989
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,757
SAID THE POINT OF THIS MEETING 

1990
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,661
WOULD BE TO HOLD THE RUSSIANS 

1991
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:19,328
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY WERE 

1992
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,129
DOING AND WHAT THEY DOING. 

1993
01:08:21,129 --> 01:08:22,798
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED AND HE 

1994
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,468
SAID WE'VE ALL DONE SOMETHING 

1995
01:08:26,468 --> 01:08:26,702
WRONG. 

1996
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:27,269
>> HE'S PUT THIS MORAL IVE 

1997
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,371
LENSES HERE BETWEEN THE U.S. 

1998
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:34,076
AND RUSSIA IN TERMS OF PAST BAD 

1999
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:35,844
BEHAVIOR BY THE UNITED STATES 

2000
01:08:35,844 --> 01:08:38,013
AND SAYING THAT'S EQUIVALENT 

2001
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:38,546
SOMEHOW TO THIS ON GOING 

2002
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:40,616
INTERFERENCE WE ARE SEEING WITH 

2003
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,183
OUR ELECTIONS. 

2004
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:43,051
THAT IS STUNNING AS MAJOR 

2005
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:44,752
GARRETT JUST POINTED OUT THERE 

2006
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:46,821
THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE ISSUE OF 

2007
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:48,157
SUBSTANCE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

2008
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,292
UNITED STATES LAID OUT HERE. 

2009
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,461
HE JUST SPOKE ABOUT HIMSELF A 

2010
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,796
DEFENSE OF HIS OWN ELECTION AND 

2011
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:56,532
SEEMED TO BE CHARACTERIZING ALL 

2012
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,335
OF THIS THURSDAY THE MUELLER 

2013
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,036
PROBE, ALL OF THAT AS AN 

2014
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:01,904
INVESTIGATION AS TO WHETHER OR 

2015
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,839
NOT HE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT WHEN 

2016
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,308
WE KNOW AS MATTER OF FACT THAT 

2017
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,776
THE INVESTIGATION BEGAN BEFORE 

2018
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:11,613
HE ACTUALLY WAS ELECTED AND IS 

2019
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:12,581
BASED IN INTELLIGENCE. 

2020
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:20,555
HE USED HIS PLATFORM TO ATTACK 

2021
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:20,921
HIS OWN F.B.I. 

2022
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:22,323
TO DISMISS OR DWI CUT THE 

2023
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:24,393
CONSENSUS VIEW OF THE 

2024
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:25,294
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY THAT THIS 

2025
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,595
WAS ELECTION MEDDLING AND A 

2026
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:28,397
THREAT HERE. 

2027
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:31,567
I MEAN THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE 

2028
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:31,867
ON SYRIA. 

2029
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,635
THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE ON I 

2030
01:09:33,635 --> 01:09:33,868
CRAIN. 

2031
01:09:33,868 --> 01:09:35,104
THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE ON ANY 

2032
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:37,740
OF THE THINGS THAT THE U.S. AND 

2033
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,274
RUSSIA SHOULD BE WORKING ON. 

2034
01:09:39,274 --> 01:09:41,343
THIS WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2035
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:41,877
SPEAKING ABOUT HIMSELF. 

2036
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:44,712
>> WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND 

2037
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:45,747
TO YOUR OWN INTELLIGENCE 

2038
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:47,749
COMMUNITY WHEN YOU ARE ON THE 

2039
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:49,652
WORLD STAGE AND THAT IS YOUR 

2040
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,187
ASSESSMENT OF THE 

2041
01:09:52,187 --> 01:09:52,554
INVESTIGATION. 

2042
01:09:52,554 --> 01:09:53,988
>> I WAS MESSAGING AND I GOT 

2043
01:09:53,988 --> 01:09:57,226
I'M TURNING OFF THE TELEVISION 

2044
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:57,826
AS A RESPONSE. 

2045
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,028
PEOPLE ARE--IT'S A PUNCH IN THE 

2046
01:09:59,028 --> 01:09:59,662
GUT. 

2047
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,897
BUT THERE ARE FROM SPEAKING 

2048
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:02,430
WITH OTHER OFFICIALS WHO 

2049
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:05,067
CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THE 

2050
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:08,336
ADMINISTRATION WE WERE TALKING 

2051
01:10:08,336 --> 01:10:10,572
EARLIER BEDROOM PEOPLE WHO ARE 

2052
01:10:10,572 --> 01:10:13,175
HARD MIND OR HARD BRIEFED WITH 

2053
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:14,243
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AROUND THE 

2054
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:17,379
WORLD AND THERE'S THE FEAR OF 

2055
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,780
WHAT IF I LEAVE? 

2056
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:19,281
WHAT HAPPENS THEN? 

2057
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,950
WHAT WILL FILL MY PLACE TO 

2058
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,485
SPEAK THE TRUTH HERE BUT YOU 

2059
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,020
HEARD THE PRESIDENT REJECTING 

2060
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:29,725
FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED 

2061
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:37,833
TO HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN. 

2062
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:46,375
AND RESITING CONSPIRACY 

2063
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:46,642
THEORIES. 

2064
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:50,044
THERE WAS REFERENCE TO PAKISTAN 

2065
01:10:50,044 --> 01:10:50,445
AND OTHER THINGS. 

2066
01:10:50,445 --> 01:10:51,347
VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS ASKED ABOUT 

2067
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,315
IF DONALD TRUMP WANTED HIM TO 

2068
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:53,515
WIN. 

2069
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,451
HE SAID YES I DID BECAUSE HE 

2070
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,252
WANTED TO WORK TOGETHER AND TO 

2071
01:10:57,252 --> 01:10:59,855
COOPERATE AND GOING BACK TO 

2072
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,557
THOSE OF HIS ADVISORS EVEN 

2073
01:11:02,557 --> 01:11:04,259
THOUSANDS HARD LINERS IT DOES 

2074
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:07,329
PUT THEM IN A TOUGH POSITION 

2075
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:11,499
BECAUSE HOW DOPPLER THEY GIVE 

2076
01:11:11,499 --> 01:11:12,100
INTERVIEWS DEFENDING WHAT THE 

2077
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:12,567
PRESIDENT SAID TODAY. 

2078
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:13,301
WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE DOES THIS 

2079
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:15,270
PUT ON CONGRESS NOW BECAUSE 

2080
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,672
GIVEN WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID 

2081
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:19,308
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO NEED FOR 

2082
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:19,975
SANCTIONS. 

2083
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,044
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO 

2084
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,580
BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS DID 

2085
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:29,084
INTERFERE WITH THE U.S. 

2086
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:29,384
ELECTIONS. 

2087
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:29,985
VLADIMIR PUTIN COULDN'T HAVE 

2088
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:30,852
DREAMED OF A BETTER OUTCOME 

2089
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:32,387
FROM THIS SUMMIT. 

2090
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:36,425
HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED. 

2091
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,293
PRESIDENT TRUMP TREATED HIM 

2092
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:39,260
PUTTING HIM ON THE 

2093
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,396
INTERNATIONAL STAGE SIDE BY 

2094
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,197
SIDE WITH THE UNITED STATES 

2095
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,366
NEVER MIND YOU CAN'T COMPARE 

2096
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,000
THE TWO ECONOMICALLY. 

2097
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,835
YOU COULD COMPARE THE TWO FROM 

2098
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,937
A NUCLEAR STANDPOINT BUT THE 

2099
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,940
ONLY ISSUE THERE WAS ANY SORT 

2100
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,377
OF DISAGREEMENTS ON WAS OVER 

2101
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:55,577
IRAN. 

2102
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:55,877
THE JC POA. 

2103
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:57,579
THAT WAS ONE LINE HE OFFERED ON 

2104
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,882
THAT FRONT BUT WHEN IT CAME TO 

2105
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:05,287
INTERFERING IN U.S. ELECTIONS 

2106
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:06,454
WHEN THE PRESIDENT BY JONATHAN 

2107
01:12:06,454 --> 01:12:07,389
AT SMART FASHION WAS ASKED WHO 

2108
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:10,292
DO YOU BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE 

2109
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,593
COMMUNITY OR VLADIMIR PUTIN DAN 

2110
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,630
COATS SAID IT MAY BE THE 

2111
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,365
RUSSIANS AND VLADIMIR PUTIN 

2112
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,433
SAYS IT'S NOT SO I DON'T SEE 

2113
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,435
ANY REASON WHY THEY WOULD HAVE 

2114
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:19,702
DONE IT. 

2115
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:21,270
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO GIVE 

2116
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,639
HIS ANSWER AND IT'S NOT WHAT 

2117
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:24,238
ANYBODY EXPECTED. 

2118
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:28,410
>> THERE'S BLAME FOR BOTH 

2119
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:28,643
SIDES. 

2120
01:12:28,643 --> 01:12:28,977
>> EXACTLY. 

2121
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:30,179
EMBASSADOR BILL BURNS WAS HERE 

2122
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:33,648
EARLIER SAYING OUR PRESIDENT IS 

2123
01:12:33,648 --> 01:12:36,050
NOT TETHERED TO HISTORY. 

2124
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:39,153
HE ALWAYS BLAMES HIS 

2125
01:12:39,153 --> 01:12:39,487
PREDECESSORS. 

2126
01:12:39,487 --> 01:12:40,923
VLADIMIR PUTIN CANCERTAINLY 

2127
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:42,958
SHARE THE BLAME TOO. 

2128
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:43,525
HE HASN'T ALWAYS EXTENDED 

2129
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,626
HIMSELF TO THE U.S. BUT HE 

2130
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:47,663
SOUNDED LIKE THIS WAS A GOOD 

2131
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:47,996
RELATIONSHIP. 

2132
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:49,464
>> AND TO HAVE THE ADD JACEETY 

2133
01:12:49,464 --> 01:12:53,935
TO SAY WE WILL WORK WITH THE 

2134
01:12:53,935 --> 01:12:54,603
AMERICANS. 

2135
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:57,306
I'M GOING TO SEND MY TEAM. 

2136
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:58,840
IT'S JUST MIND BLOWING. 

2137
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,243
>> THE NORMAL ALSO HAS BEEN FOR 

2138
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,377
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN AN 

2139
01:13:02,377 --> 01:13:03,312
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION TO 

2140
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,880
STAND UP FOR THE COUNTRY TO SAY 

2141
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,416
WE ARE ALL TO BLAME IS OUTSIDE 

2142
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,686
OF THE NORMAL OF USUALLY WHEN 

2143
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,121
PRESIDENTS DO IN THIS INSTANCE. 

2144
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:14,923
LET'S GO BACK TO NORAH 

2145
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,025
O'DONNELL WHO HAS SOME OF THE 

2146
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:17,425
RUSSIAN REACTION. 

2147
01:13:17,425 --> 01:13:18,226
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

2148
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:23,498
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE 

2149
01:13:23,498 --> 01:13:24,099
BEST AND WORST CASE SCENARIOS 

2150
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:24,700
THAT COULD COME OUT OF THE 

2151
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,268
SUMMIT AND PUTIN IS LEAVING 

2152
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:29,638
WITH ONE OF THE BEST CASE 

2153
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:30,706
SCENARIOS BECAUSE FOLLOWING 

2154
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,374
EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IN 

2155
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,676
QUARTER AND THEY ARE DECLARING 

2156
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:35,343
IT A SUCCESS. 

2157
01:13:35,343 --> 01:13:35,677
>> VICTORY. 

2158
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:38,814
WE HAVE IT VERY CLEARLY FROM 

2159
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:40,682
THE MOUTH OF RUSSIA'S FOREIGN 

2160
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,719
MINISTER ASKED BY THE ONLINE 

2161
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:44,953
MAGAZINE LIFE IN RUSSIA HOW THE 

2162
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:47,356
TALKS HAD GONE AND HE SAID THEY 

2163
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,723
WERE BETTER THAN SUPER. 

2164
01:13:48,723 --> 01:13:52,161
IN FACT THEY WERE FABULOUS. 

2165
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:54,596
SO ALREADY DECLARING A VICTORY 

2166
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,197
THERE. 

2167
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,031
>> THE RUSSIANS ARE LEAVING 

2168
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:56,364
VERY HAPPY. 

2169
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:57,699
>> THERE YOU GUYS HEAR IT AND I 

2170
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:02,237
DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAY THE 

2171
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,039
COMMENTS THE FORMER CIA 

2172
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,508
DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN WHO HAS 

2173
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,545
BEEN A FIERCE CRITIC HAS 

2174
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:14,082
TWEETED CALLING PRESIDENT

TRUMP'S PRESS CONFERENCE 

2176
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:15,717
PERFORMANCE TREASONOUS STAYING 

2177
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:18,020
IT EXCEEDS THE HIGH CRIMES AND 

2178
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,555
MISDEMEANORS AND HE IS WHOLLY 

2179
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:22,290
IN THE POCKET OF PUTIN FROM THE 

2180
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:26,895
FORMER CIA DIRECTOR OF THE
