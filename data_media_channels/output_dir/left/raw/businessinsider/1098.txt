1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
I think over and over again there's this

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,160
constant attempt to undermine his

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,990
credibility and the movement that he

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,940
represents and it's frustrating<font color="#E5E5E5"> for not</font>

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,160
just him but I think so many of us that

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,290
are trying to work to get this message

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">out and it's and so I mentioned mr. john</font>

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,420
de but part of this is a two-way street

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,880
like we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want we want to have a</font>

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,619
healthy dialogue not just with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but</font>

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the American people because he's</font>

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,010
fighting for jobs he's fighting to make

13
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,630
this country safer but when you're

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,460
constantly getting told that can't be

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,070
true we doubt that you can do this this

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,350
won't happen and that's the narrative

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,149
when you turn on television every single

18
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,910
day it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little frustrating it's a</font>

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">little demoralizing to turn on the TV</font>

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,690
day after day and here can't do this

21
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,430
this guy's not going to get confirmed no

22
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,170
way they're going to go through just

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the conversation that happens in</font>

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,090
washing now I think with being president

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,800
of the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">y know I look I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this a</font>

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">long time you've been doing this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,770
I've never<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen it like this Jim I've</font>

29
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,230
never and again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I splat I'm not</font>

30
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,270
looking to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth but you're</font>

31
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,069
asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an explanation and I think</font>

32
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's important to understand that</font>

33
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,260
whether it's the President himself the

34
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">vice president the senior team the</font>

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,880
volunteers or the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are out</font>

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,100
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know in America</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

37
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,750
voted for more walked the streets and

38
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,360
put up a sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly told</font>

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,960
no no no and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no watch him go yes yes yes</font>

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,700
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and to come up to the next</font>

41
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">turtle and see someone put a block up</font>

42
00:01:28,110 --> 00:00:00,000
gets a little frustrating
