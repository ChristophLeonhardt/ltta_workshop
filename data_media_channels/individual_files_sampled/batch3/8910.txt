THE PRESS VERSUS SARA SANDSER THE PRESS VERSUS SARA SANDSE SANDSERS SANDSER SANDSERS. THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE. YESTERDAY THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING TURNED INTO A TOTAL FRENZY. THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS IS UP IN ARMS OVER THE DISCREPANCY OF WHAT SHE TOLD THE PRESS PREVIOUSLY AND WHAT GIULIANI REVEALED THIS WEEK. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ANSWER YES OR NO WHETHER YOU WERE IN THE DARK? I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE QUESTION. I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE ANSWER. I GAVE YOU THE BEST ANSWER I HAD AND I'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY. HAVE WE EVER GOTTEN ANY TRUTH OUT OF THEM? HAVE THEY BECOME TO THE POINT THAT THEY'VE BECOME NULL AND VOID? BUT SHE'S LYING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND I THINK SHE NEEDS TO OWN THAT. BEING IGNORANT AND LYING ABOUT IT IS JUST NOT AN EXCUSE. IS NO COMMENT A BETTER OPTION? IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LIE, WHY BOTHER? THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY DIE SLOWLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. EVERY SINGLE DAY, DECEPTION AND LIES BECOME NORMAL. HOW DRAMATIC, MIKE. "THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY DIES." OH, PLEASE. THEN UNDER THE HEADLINE "WHY SARA SANDERS SHOULD QUIT." SHE LOST IT WITH THAT ANSWER. ADMITTING THAT YOU MISLED THE PRESS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT MISLED YOU IS TANTAMOUNT TO TAKING YOUR CREDIBILITY, POURING GASOLINE ON IT, AND THEN SETTING IT ON FIRE. WELL, THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LECTURE US ABOUT CREDIBILITY? THE PRESS? CONSIDER THE SOURCES. OR ACTUALLY, YEAH. ARE THESE RELIABLE SOURCES? FOR THE MOST PART, THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS POOL HAS BECOME A JUST LISTEN TO THIS. SHE CAN BE MAD AT WHAT I SAY RIGHT NOW. TOUGH. I'M A REPORTER WHO'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT QUESTION. I WISH I COULD INSTALL A BS METER. UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK IT WOULD BE GOING OFF ALL THE TIME. I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SARA. I THINK SHE'S VERY RESOURCEFUL. SHE BURNS FACTS AND USES THAT ASH TO CREATE A SMOKY EYE. THE EFFORT TO DEMEAN AND DRIVE OUT SANDERS AND SEND HER PACKING FROM HER JOB IS PART OF THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL DESTRUCTION IN THIS TOWN, WASHINGTON, D.C. ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR THE PRESIDENT IS A TARGET BECAUSE THE RESISTANCE WANTS TO THIN THE RANKS OF THOSE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND ADVANCE A NARRATIVE OF INTERNAL DIVISION AND CHAOS. AND AT THE SAME TIME, SARAH SANDERS IS IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION AND HAS TO LOOK OUT FOR HER OWN CREDIBILITY AS WELL. SHE WAS GIVEN SCANT INFORMATION AND REPEATED WHAT SHE WAS TOLD IN GOOD FAITH. ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM, PERIOD. TRUMP NEEDS A LEGAL SPOKESPERSON, WHICH HE DOESN'T
