>> LOOK, IF THIS WASN'T A
POLITICAL STUNT BY THE EAGLES
FRANCHISE, THEN THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE PLANNED TO ATTEND THE EVENT
AND BACKED OUT AT THE LAST
MINUTE.
IF IT WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT
THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
ATTEMPTED TO RESCHEDULE THE
VISIT WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THE
PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO BE
OVERSEAS.
IF THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED UNTIL
MONDAY, WHILE AFTER A THOUSAND
OF THEIR FRIENDS HAVE TRAVELED
INTO TAKING TIME OUT OF THEIR
SCHEDULES TO OFFER ONLY A TINY
HANDFUL OF REPRESENTATIVES TO
ATTEND THE EVENT.
>> Martha: PRESS
SECRETARY SANDERS ACCUSING THE
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES OF PULLING A
PUBLICITY STUNT, ONE THAT
PROMPTED THE RESIDENT TO CALL
OFF THE CHAMPIONS VISIT TO THE
WHITE HOUSE ALTOGETHER AFTER THE
TEAMS THAT ONLY A HANDFUL OF
PLAYERS AND A MASCOT WOULD BE
ATTENDING THE ROSE GARDEN
CELEBRATION.
SO INSTEAD, THE PRESIDENT HELD A
QUOTE CELEBRATING AMERICA EVENT,
AND HERE'S WHAT THAT LOOKED
LIKE.
>> President Trump: WE STAND
TO HONOR OUR MILITARY AND HONOR
OUR COUNTRY AND TO REMEMBER THE
FALLEN HEROES WHO NEVER MADE IT
BACK HOME.
WE STAND TO SHOW OUR LOVE FOR
OUR FELLOW CITIZENS, AND OUR
MAGNIFICENT CONSTITUTION.
WE STAND TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE
INCREDIBLE AMERICANS WHO CAME
BEFORE US, AND THE HEROIC
SACRIFICES THEY MADE.
SO WE STAND TOGETHER FOR
FREEDOM.
WE STAND TOGETHER FOR
PATRIOTISM, AND WE PROUDLY STAND
FOR OUR GLORIOUS NATION, UNDER
GOD.
>> Martha: HERE NOW, BILL
BENNETT, A HOST OF THE BILL
BENNETT PODCAST.
>> IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU IN
PERSON.
LET'S PUT UP THIS QUOTE FROM THE
PHILADELPHIA MAYOR JIM KENNEY
WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE
SITUATION TODAY.
HE SAID THIS INVITING THEM FROM
THE WHITE HOUSE PROVES THAT OUR
PRESIDENT IS NOT A TRUE PATRIOT
BUT A FRAGILE EGO MANIAC WITH
EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT THROWING
PARTIES THAT NO ONE WANTS TO
ATTEND.
DID HE HAVE A POINT OF ANY OF
THAT?
>> I THINK HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO
SAY THINGS AND HE TOOK IT.
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK YOU
ARE SIDE ABOUT THE EAGLES NOT
COMING.
>> IS THE EAGLES HAD ONE, WHICH
IS WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED
THEY WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP.
>> WHAT DOES OUR FRIEND LAURA
SAY?
SHUT UP AND SAYING?
SHUT UP AND PLAY.
BY THE WAY, I AM A HUGE FOOTBALL
FAN ALTHOUGH ITS COLLEGE GAMES
FOR ME.
WE ARE THREE MONTHS AWAY, CAN WE
THINK ABOUT THE CAPS FOR A
MINUTE?
YOU WANT TO SEE POLITICS?
WHEN OVECHKIN COMES TO THE
WHITE HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT UNINVITED THEM
BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY WOULD
HAVE FOUR OR FIVE GUYS COMING
RATHER THAN 50 OR 60 OR 70,
THAT'S CRAZY.
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF UNKNOWN
THAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY
WANTED TO HAVE MEETINGS WITH THE
PRESIDENT FOR THE PRESIDENT
DENIED IT.
I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT
WOULD WANT TO DENY A MEETING, HE
WOULD HAVE ONE OF THOSE
ROUNDTABLES THAT YOU SEE ON TV.
BUT THE PRESIDENT INVITED THEM
AND THEY SAID, WE WILL SEND FIVE
OR TEN PEOPLE.
>> Martha: AND NOW IT TURNS
INTO THIS WHOLE THING, NOW YOU
HAVE A LeBRON JAMES AND I KNOW
REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS THE
SERIES, THEY PLAY THE
GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS, NO ONE
WANTS AN INVITE ANYWAY.
IF WE HAVE GOTTEN TO A POINT
WHERE WE SHOULD STOP THIS WHOLE
THING?
I THINK THE TEAM SHOULD JUST GO.
>> YES, THEY SHOULD JUST GO.
THEY SHOULD JUST GO.
I REMEMBER, BILL CLINTON IS NOT
A GUY I LIKE TO COME IS NOT A
PRESIDENT I ADMIRE.
BUT WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
AND WE WERE AT THE KENNEDY
CENTER, I SAID TO MY FAMILY, WE
HAVE TO SLANT DUMB I CAN STAND
UP.
AND YOUR TEAM IS HONORED IN A
WAY THAT THEY CAN'T BE HONORED
IN ANY OTHER WAY.
>> BILL CLINTON HAS BEEN DIGGING
A HOLE AND, HE COULD JUST KEEPS
DIGGING THIS WEEK.
HE BASICALLY WAS ASKED IN AN
INTERVIEW WHETHER OR NOT HE
SHOULD APOLOGIZE DIRECTLY TO
MONICA LEWINSKY GIVEN THE
CONTEXT OF "ME TOO" NOW.
HE WAS OFFENDED THAT HE WAS EVEN
ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT IT.
>> IT WAS, HE HADN'T SEEN THAT
ONE BEFORE.
I THINK PART OF IT IS, THE
CLINTONS DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD
BE ASKED TOUGH QUESTIONS.
THIS HAS PASSED, THEY ARE ABOVE
CRITICISM.
BUT HE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE
BETTER.
BUT HE'S GOT TO FACE THE FACT,
WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT MOMENT
NOW.
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.
THE MONICA LEWINSKY TIME, IT WAS
A DIFFERENT MOMENT FOR WOMEN.
IT WAS, I AM WOMEN HEAR ME ROAR,
SHE'S EMPOWERED, SHE'S A WOMAN.
NOW MONICA IS COMING TO A
REALIZATION, MAYBE I WAS TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF.
YOU SURE WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE
OF, YOU ARE ALSO IMPLICIT IN
WHAT YOU DID.
BUT CLINTON DOESN'T THINK HE
SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR IT NOW.
A BOOK, AND HE IS WRONG NOW.
>> Martha: IT'S NOT GOING TO
GET BETTER FOR HIM.
ANITA BRODERICK IS -- IT'S NOT
AS IF YOU CAN PASS IT OFF LIKE,
THERE WAS JUST THIS ONE AFFAIR.
THERE ARE TOO MANY OTHER THINGS
OUT THERE WHICH WILL BE MORE AND
MORE DIFFICULT.
AND EVEN, DID YOU SEE THE POLE
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROFESSORS --
WHILE THEY ARE ALL DEMOCRATS,
SAYING HIS STANDINGS HAVE
DROPPED BY ABOUT TEN SLICES
BECAUSE OF THE "ME TOO"
MOVEMENT.
HE'S GOING TO RUN INTO THIS
EVERYWHERE.
>> Martha: SOME WILL RISE OVER
TIME AND OTHERS FALL.
>> AND SOME SHOULD DISAPPEAR.
>> OBSERVERS OF ALL THINGS
