1
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:11,143
>>> WELCOME BACK.

2
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:13,312
TWO BIG INITIATIVES COMING FROM

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,916
THE FDA, MENU LABELING AND

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:17,416
E-CIGARETTES.

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:18,751
AND OUR MARK SIEGEL SAT DOWN

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,955
WITH THE FDA COMMISSIONER SCOTT

7
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,957
GOTTLIEB AND JOINS US NOW.

8
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:26,425
WHAT AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW

9
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:27,093
YOU HAD.

10
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,195
LET'S START WITH THE LABELING ON

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:29,562
MENUS.

12
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,463
THERE'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR

13
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:30,763
THAT.

14
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:32,198
THIS IS ABOUT HEALTH BUT IT'S

15
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,432
ALSO ABOUT EDUCATING PEOPLE.

16
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,233
>> EXACTLY.

17
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,102
I MEAN I COMES FROM THE

18
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,703
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEY

19
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:38,971
DELAYED A YEAR PUTTING IT INTO

20
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,271
PLACE.

21
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:41,974
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT CALORIES ON

22
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:42,274
MENUS.

23
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:43,843
AND DR. GOTTLIEB FEELS IT'S A

24
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:46,479
WAY TO FIGHT THE OBESITY

25
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,347
EPIDEMIC AND A NEW WAY TO HAVE A

26
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:50,649
NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE YOU GET

27
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:53,819
THEL

28
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:53,853
HEEL

29
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:54,987
HEALTHY CHOICES RATHER THAN

30
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:56,622
CHOICES THAT ARE BAD FOR YOU.

31
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:57,256
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

32
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:59,692
>> TO HAVE INFORMATION ON MENU

33
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,428
LABELS THE AVERAGE CONSUMER WILL

34
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:06,732
REDUCE THEIR CALORIC INTAKE

35
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,401
EVERY DAY BY HAVING BETTER

36
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:08,868
INFORMATION.

37
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,103
IF YOU BELIEVE THE DATA WHICH

38
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:13,706
SHOWS THAT PEOPLE BECOME OBESE

39
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:17,943
BY EATING 64-CALORIES A DAY, YOU

40
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:20,179
CAN REDUCE THIS BY MAKING

41
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:21,747
INFORMATION AVAILABLE, YOU'RE A

42
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:24,116
LONG WAY TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE

43
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:28,320
TARGET OF REDUCING CALORIC

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,921
INTAKE ENOUGH.

45
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,924
>> YOU BELIEVE IT WILL BE LEAD

46
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:32,858
TO PRO-BUSINESS?

47
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,061
>> RESTAURANTS ARE GOING TO

48
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,729
REFORMULATE THEIR FOODS TO MAKE

49
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,366
THEM MORE HELD HEALTHY.

50
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,301
SOME CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO OPT

51
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,571
FOR THE HIGH CALORIE OPTION BUT

52
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,972
THEY'LL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

53
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:47,306
GETTING.

54
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,875
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT SALAD

55
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,477
LOOKS A LOT HEALTHIER.

56
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:53,279
I'M GOING TO GO THAT DIRECTION

57
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,814
RATHER THAN THE PIZZA.

58
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,083
>> A LOT OF THE MANUFACTURERS

59
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:02,021
ARE COMPLYING WITH DELIVERY MOAN

60
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:02,955
MENUS

61
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,291
IT'S GOING TO HELP US CUT DOWN.

62
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,026
HEALTHY CHOICES MAY BE MORE

63
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:07,393
EXPENSIVE.

64
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,627
A BUSINESS MAY MAKE MORE MONEY

65
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:09,461
WITH THAT.

66
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,464
A REST RAWPT CHAIN IS GOING TO

67
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,131
MAKE MORE MONEY.

68
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,500
I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT

69
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,934
E-CIGARETTES.

70
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,268
>> A BIG THING TODAY.

71
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:19,171
I SEE SPECIFICALLY YOUNG KIDS

72
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,340
SMOKING E-CIGARETTES AND I

73
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,210
WONDER IF THIS IS A HEALTHIER

74
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,677
OPTION FOR THEM.

75
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,946
>> IT'S A GATEWAY THAT LEADS TO

76
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,380
SMOKING CIGARETTES AND HE'S

77
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,282
DISTURBED THAT NOBODY IS BEING

78
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:31,150
COMPLIANT ON THIS.

79
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,518
CHILDREN ARE GETTING

80
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,786
E-CIGARETTES WHEN THEY

81
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,553
SHOULDN'T.

82
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:35,187
FDA CLAMPING DOWN.

83
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,590
>> I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOUTH

84
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,658
BECOMING ADDICTED TO NICK

85
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:40,926
BETWEEN THROUGH E-CIGARETTES.

86
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,195
THE TERKS CIGARETTES COULD OFFER

87
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,998
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ADULT

88
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,833
CONSUMER TO TRANSITION OFF.

89
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,035
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A SERIES OF

90
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:52,004
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FROM FDA

91
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,672
AGAINST MANUFACTURERS AND

92
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:54,773
OUTLETS THAT ARE SELLING PRODUCT

93
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,775
TO CHILDREN TO CRACK DOWN ON

94
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:57,076
THAT.

95
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,477
>> TOUGH WORDS BUT IMPORTANT TO

96
00:02:58,477 --> 00:02:58,777
HEAR.

97
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,412
>> VERY VERY IMPORTANT.

98
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:02,047
E-CIGARETTES ARE A HUGE PROBLEM.

99
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:04,683
THEY LEAD TO NICOTINE

100
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:05,084
ADDICTIONS.

101
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,652
>> DR. MARK SIEGEL, GREAT TO

102
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:07,720
HAVE YOU ON THIS MORNING.

103
00:03:07,720 --> 00:00:00,000
AND YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR
