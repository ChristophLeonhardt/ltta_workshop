WHILE ALL THIS IS GOING ON, SOME ASPECTS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM MOORE, THE FUNDRAISING ARM OF THE PARTY DISTANCED ITSELF FROM MOORE AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS COMMENTED ON IT, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID I NOTICED THAT THAT IS WILL DO THE RIGHT THING, NOT SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND STEP ASIDE. WE ARE STILL WEEKS AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL RACE, POLLS GENERALLY PUT MOORE UP BY ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE POINTS, BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE IN A WEEK, LET ALONE THREE WEEKS? BUT THIS COULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE RACE. I THINK IT WILL, I HAVE TO SAY THIS, I KNOW THE FOX NEWS AUDIENCE WELL, I THINK THE FOX NEWS AUDIENCE IS A LOT SMARTER THAN THIS AND I THINK THEY READ THIS STORY AND THEY SEE IT FOR WHAT IT IS, I THINK THEY CAN SNIFF OUT B.S.ER WHEN THEY SEE ONE. I THINK THAT POLLS SPEAK TO THAT, THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA ARE SAYING WAIT A MINUTE MIND YOU WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY POLLING DONE SINCE THIS REVELATION HAS HAPPENED FROM A CREDIBLE POLLSTER WHO COULD GO DOWN THERE AND DO SOME POLLING. I THINK YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE BEING LIKE, I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS GUY, AND RESPECTABLE REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS IN ALABAMA WILL SAY I WILL EITHER STAY AT HOME AND NOT VOTE AT ALL BECAUSE I WON'T VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT, OR I WILL VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT AND VOTE FOR DOUG JONES. OR POTENTIALLY WRITE SOMEONE IN. JUST DON'T VOTE FOR THIS GUY. I LIKE YOUR OPTIMISM, I KNOW JAYAR ON THE SHOW YESTERDAY SAID HE THOUGHT MOORE WOULD CLIMB IN THE POLLS AFTER THIS, I DON'T THINK I AGREE WITH THAT BUT BUT I WORRY THAT IN ONE WEEK WILL WE SEE A POLL WERE DOUG JONES IS UP BY TWO POINTS? A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HATE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SO MUCH THAT THEY MIGHT VOTE FOR SOMEONE EVEN IF THEY THINK HE'S A PEDOPHILE. MAYBE I HAVE MORE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT THEY WILL BE LIKE, THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN VOTE FOR A PEDOPHILE. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. MY THOUGHT IS NO FATHER OUT THERE WHO HAS A DAUGHTER COULD VOTE FOR THIS MAN. NO, ALMOST EVERY REPUBLICAN IN ALABAMA. I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH YOU. REPUBLICANS IN ALABAMA, PLEASE PROVE ME RIGHT AND PROVE CENK WRONG. I LOVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. MY PERSPECTIVE IS REPUBLICANS DON'T CARE ABOUT FAMILY VALUE AT ALL, THE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT FAMILY VALUES THE LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FOX NEWS VIEWERS. THIS GUY IN TENNESSEE, A PRO-LIFE REPUBLICAN, THREE ABORTIONS, HE SAID I HAD TO BECAUSE I HAD A MISTRESS ACCORDING TO NOT MY LANGUAGE, YOUR LANGUAGE, FOX NEWS AND REPUBLICANS IN ALABAMA AND TENNESSEE, HE MURDERED THOSE THREE KIDS BECAUSE IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR HIM, BUT YOU DIDN'T CARE. YOU REELECTED HIM. TRUMP MOLESTED THOSE WOMEN, IT'S ON TAPE, HE SAID YOU GRAB THEM BY THE GENITALS, YOU NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION YOU DIDN'T CARE. YOU SHOWED TIME AND TIME AGAIN, ALL YOUR TALK ABOUT FAMILY VALUES IS A GARGANTUAN LIE. AS LONG AS IT'S A REPUBLICAN WHO HATES THE SAME PEOPLE YOU HATE, YOU DON'T CARE THAT HE MOLESTS 14-YEAR-OLDS OR SEXUALLY ASSAULTS PEOPLE, YOU DON'T CARE HOW MANY ABORTIONS HE HAD WITH HIS MISTRESS OR HIS WIFE, OR AS YOU WOULD PUT IT THE BABIES HE MURDERED. YOU DON'T CARE, JUST ADMIT IT. SAY ROY MOORE HATES THE SAME PEOPLE I DO, I'LL VOTE FOR HIM NO MATTER WHAT. I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF ALL THE DEFENCES THAT RIGHT NOW ALABAMA REPUBLICANS AND FOX NEWS ARE DOING WOULDN'T WORK, I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING RIGHT NOW. COME ON. ALABAMA REPUBLICANS HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN MORALITY. PROVE HIM WRONG AND PROVE ME RIGHT. ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES OF CENK GOING AWAY FOR A WEEK AS HE COMES BACK TIRED LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT REPUBLICANS IN ALABAMA. STATE REPRESENTATIVE ED HENRY SAYS THESE GIRLS, NOT WOMEN, WERE FOOLISH FOR COMING FORWARD AND THEY WOULD REGRET GOING DOWN THIS ROAD. THEN HE WONDERED, WHY DIDN'T THEY COME OUT EARLIER? MAYBE BECAUSE YOU JUST THREATENED THEM BY SAYING YOU WILL REGRET COMING DOWN THIS ROAD. HE SAID THEY SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. AND HE SAID THEY ARE GUILTY FOR ALLOWING HIM TO EXIST FOR 40 YEARS. HE'S NOT GUILTY FOR MOLESTING THE 14-YEAR-OLD, THEY ARE GUILTY FOR GETTING MOLESTED. ALABAMA REPUBLICANS DON'T CARE ABOUT MORALITY, THEY THINK MORALITY IS A PUNCHLINE, A POLITICAL GIMMICK. THAT IS ALABAMA REPUBLICAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE ED HENRY. THE STATE AUDITOR SAID EVEN IF YOU ACCEPT THE WASHINGTON POST REPORT AS BEING TRUE, IT'S MUCH ADO ABOUT VERY LITTLE. THIS IS ASSUMING, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WORDS, THAT MOORE GOT NAKED IN HIS MID-30S WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD, STRIPPED HER TO HER UNDERWEAR AND FONDLED HER. MUCH ADO ABOUT VERY LITTLE. IT'S SOMETHING ALABAMA REPUBLICANS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN WORDS THINK IS NO BIG DEAL. HE SAID MOORE MARRIED SOMEONE 14 YEARS YOUNGER AND IT'S FINE, HE HAPPENED TO DATE TEENAGE GIRLS IN HIS 30S, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? THESE ARE QUOTES. HE SAID MARY WAS A TEENAGER, JOSEPH WAS AN ADULT CARPENTER, THEY BECAME PARENTS OF JESUS, THERE'S NOTHING IMMORAL OR ILLEGAL HERE. SO ALABAMA REPUBLICANS THINK CHILD MOLESTATION OF 14-YEAR-OLDS IS NO BIG DEAL. YOU THINK THESE GUYS WILL BE THROWN OUT OF OFFICE FOR SAYING PEDOPHILIA IS AWESOME AND BIBLICAL? NO, HE WILL GET REELECTED. THEY DON'T CARE, THEY'VE NEVER CARED. IN FACT THEY MIGHT RALLY TO HIM AND GO, GOOD QUESTION, MOLESTING A 14-YEAR-OLD AND NOW HE'S IN TROUBLE.
