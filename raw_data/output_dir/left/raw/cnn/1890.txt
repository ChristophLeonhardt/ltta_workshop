00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,310
more scrutiny on the strain of those
operations for the men and women who

protect president Trump and his extended
family they are now working overtime

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,900
Alice said about 1,100 agency employees
will work overtime hours this year that

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,309
they won't get paid for without Congress
stepping in Alice pointed out in a

9
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,300
statement quote this issue is not one
that can be attributed to the current

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,680
administration's protection requirements
but rather has been an ongoing issue for

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,250
nearly a decade
still observers say Alice has a problem

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,469
internally at the Secret Service he has
a lot of angry frustrated agents who

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,559
feel that they are giving more than they
can they should give by serving on these

14
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,180
details and the Trump details are taxing
the Secret Service in unique ways

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,860
unlike other presidents who made trips
to Camp David where military security is

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,689
already in place president Trump's made
frequent trips to his resorts former

17
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,650
Secret Service agent Larry Johnson says
that creates more security challenges

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,570
and longer hours for the agents you're
going to have to name check you can have

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,060
to do extra security because of access
to individuals that may there be

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,110
residents in that location or members of
the Golf Club etc the logistics of the

21
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,630
Secret Service is quite amazing when you
talk about moving vehicles moving agents

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,220
moving assets like magnetometers and
trump's large family 18 members in all

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,530
travel often need protection wherever
they go USA Today reports Trump's son

for hotel rooms you may remember when

26
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,140
the children the three adult children
all went skiing it cost quite a pretty

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,200
penny and ski lift fees just for the
Secret Service agents it costs thousands

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,170
upon
of dollars in golf cart fees when the

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,030
family is in mar-a-lago because the
Secret Service agents have to have golf
