Laura: JEFF BEZOS HAS LED HIS COMPANY TO SUPPORT SOME CONTROVERSIAL CHARITIES. TWO OF THE CHARITIES LISTED BY AMAZON OR BACKED BY A CONTROVERSIAL BRITISH IMAM. HIS TEACHERS INCLUDE THAT MEN SHOULD NOT BE QUESTIONS FOR BEATING THEIR WIVES. PUNISHMENT FOR ADULTERY SHOULD BE STONING. WE HAVE THE AUTHOR AND FORMER CHIEF ADVISOR OF NIGEL FARAGE. HADDAD HAS BEEN ON THE SCENE IN THE U.K., CALLING SOME JEWS APES AND PIGS, SAYING THAT MEN DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY BEAT THEIR WIVES. WHAT AMAZON HAS DONE, THE CHARITABLE THING, YOU CAN TOP UP FOR CHARITY WHATEVER YOU PURCHASE ON AMAZON. THEY RELIED ON THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARITY REGULATOR IN THE U.K. TO PASS MUSTER FOR THESE THINGS. BIG CORPORATE, BIG GOVERNMENT CAN'T GET THINGS RIGHT. Laura: HOW IS HADDAD ON THE GOVERNMENT'S LIST? THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ISN'T HOT ON TACKLING RADICAL ISLAM. GIVEN WHAT HE SAID ABOUT FEMALE GENITAL MODULATION UI GENITAL MODULATION UA GENITAL MODULATION UI GENITAL MODULATION UN WHY ARE YOU GIVING MONEY TO A RADICAL ISLAMIC CLERIC? IT'S EXTRAORDINARY AND DISGUSTING. Laura: AMAZON SAYS THAT THE CHARITIES IN QUESTION, DUE TO THE CONCERNS, WE WILL BE CONDUCTING A FULL REVIEW. WHAT ELSE IS ON THE LIST OF OKAY CHARITIES?
