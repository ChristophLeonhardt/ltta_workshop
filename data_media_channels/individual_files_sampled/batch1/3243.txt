what does it feel like to suddenly get really blindsided by John Stewart oh yeah though that night we talked about I said you know I was with Stewart and it was a tough day did I get a beatdown of course I gotta be damned but you know what the next day I got up at quarter four I worked out real hard with my trainer I did a piece I went in the shower I did another piece and I was on TV and I did my job and the way you come back is to show up the next day no matter what they do to humiliate you or try to take you down you show up the next day and the way you beat them is to show up it's the only way to win against the people who try to take it down is it do your damn job can you be humiliated absolutely a part of the game won one for 11 years because I show up every day and that's the secret I put my suit on I put my tie on I do my homework you want a more defined me going you got me for three hours even if it's a national beat you let them get you then you just fail the key is to not fail to show up
