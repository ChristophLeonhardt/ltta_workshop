JEOPARDIZES THE G.O.P.'S NEW MIDTERM MOMENTUM. THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S "ANGLE" ." DESPITE WHAT YOU HEAR FROM THE MEDIA AND THE LEFT, THE PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE WINNING ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT TIGHTER BORDER ENFORCEMENT, ARE AGAINST, BY THE WAY, EVEN INCREASES IN LEGAL IMMIGRATION, AND SUPPORT DEFUNDING SANCTUARY CITIES. CHECK THIS OUT, EVEN IN CALIFORNIA A NEW UC BERKELEY POLL FINDS THAT 59% OF CALIFORNIANS SAY IT IS VERY, OR SOMEWHAT IMPORTANT TO INCREASE DEPORTATIONS OF ILLEGALS. MUSIC TO MY EARS. A FULL 49% SUPPORT TEMPORARILY BANNING PEOPLE FROM MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRIES FROM ENTERING THE UNITED STATES. THAT GOES EVEN FURTHER THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN FROM JUST SIX MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRIES. DID I MENTION THAT'S CALIFORNIA? DETERMINED TO FULFILL HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND FOCUS ON AMERICANS FIRST, THE PRESIDENT URGED CONGRESS ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY AS THEY HAVE SINCE TAKEN OFFICE TO TIGHTEN IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS. WE ARE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO SECURE OUR BORDERS, SUPPORT OUR BORDER AGENTS, STOP SANCTUARY CITIES, AND SHUT DOWN POLICIES THAT RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINALS BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE DON'T WANT IT ANY LONGER. WE'VE HAD IT. Laura: THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE END THE OLD, TWISTED APPROACH OF CATCH AND RELEASE AT THE BORDER. FOR ALL YOU COMMON SENSE VOTERS OUT THERE, THIS GET TOUGH APPROACH MAKES PERFECT SENSE. THE GRASSROOTS, I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS MORE UNIFIED THAN EVER BEHIND THIS AGENDA OF THE PRESIDENT. SO LEAVE IT TO A SMALL, LIBERAL BAND OF REPUBLICANS TO TRY TO SPLINTER THE PARTY JUST BEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTION. BEAUTIFUL. BY THE WAY, OVER DACA, OF ALL THINGS. IT TURNS OUT THAT AT LEAST 18 REPUBLICANS, YOU SEE THE GALLERY THERE, HAS SIGNED SOMETHING CARD, CALLED A DISCHARGE PETITION. IF IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY GIVE THE DEMOCRATS AND A FEW LIBERAL REPUBLICANS RUN OF THE HOUSE FLOOR AND THE ABILITY TO BRING SEVERAL IMMIGRATION BILLS TO A VOTE, INCLUDING A BILL GRANTING AMNESTY TO THE DACA KIDS. NORMALLY A DISCHARGE PETITION IS LAUNCHED BY THE OPPOSITION PARTY. IT REQUIRES 218 SIGNATURES TO ENGAGE. SO IN THIS CASE 25 REPUBLICANS AND ALL THE DEMOCRATS WOULD NEED TO BE IN FAVOR TO SUPPORT IT. SO CNN IS REPORTING TONIGHT, BY THE WAY, THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR THE PETITION BUT THE LAWMAKERS COULD PROVIDE NO EVIDENCE TO THAT FACT. THE PECULIAR THING HERE IS THAT THE DISCHARGE PETITION AGAIN WAS LAUNCHED BY REPUBLICANS AS A CHALLENGE TO G.O.P. LEADERSHIP AND OF COURSE TO THE PRESIDENT. FLORIDA REPUBLICAN CARLOS CURBELO, NOTORIOUS OPEN BORDERS REPUBLICAN, THE PRIME MOVERS. BUT THE PETITION HAS BEEN SIGNED BY OTHERS AS WELL, INCLUDING, UNBELIEVABLY, UTAH'S NEIL LOVE. WILL HURD OF TEXAS. MARIO DIAZ BULLARD AND CHARLIE DENT OF PENNSYLVANIA WHOSE VOTES DON'T COUNT EVEN THOUGH HE'S ALREADY RESIGNED. FRED UPTON OF MICHIGAN. DAVID REICHERT OF WASHINGTON. COLORADO'S MIKE KAUFMAN. CHRIS COLLINS. BILLY STEFANIK OF NEW YORK AND MARK ON MONDAY OF NEVADA. NEW YORK'S CONTACT GOAT IS ALSO CONSIDERING SIGNING THESE REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES AT THIS POINT. COME ON. BY DEFYING THEIR LEADERSHIP AND THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT DO THEY DO THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT DO THEY D DO? THEY DEMORALIZE THE BASE OF THE G.O.P. AND THEY WEAKEN UNITY BEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTION. SO RATHER THAN KEEPING A FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY THAT IS BOOMING, THESE REPUBLICANS HAVE DECIDED IT'S IN THEIR POLITICAL INTEREST TO TURN THE SPOTLIGHT TO IMMIGRATION AND THE DACA KIDS. WHO CARES IF IT MEANS HANDING OVER POWER TO THE OPPOSITION TO DO IT. ON THURSDAY, SPEAKER RYAN REACTED TO THIS DISCHARGE PETITION UPRISING DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE. WE NEVER WANT TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO THE MINORITY. AND WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE A PROCESS THAT JUST ENDS UP WITH A VETO. WE ACTUALLY WANT TO SOLVE THE DACA PROBLEM. GOING DOWN A PATH AND HAVING SOME KIND OF SPECTACLE ON THE FLOOR THAT RESULTS IN A VETO DOESN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM. THAT IS WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN SUPPORT. Laura: THE PRESIDENT ALREADY OFFERED SOMETHING IN THE DEMOCRATS SAID NO TO IT LAST FEBRUARY. COME ON. WASTING TIME. IT'S NOT UP TO A MINORITY OF REPUBLICANS WHOSE VIEWS, BY THE WAY, DID NOT PREVAIL IN THE 2016 ELECTION CYCLE TO NOW AT THIS POINT TRY TO RESET THE NATIONAL DEBATE ON DACA. IT'S ABSURD. IF THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY HELP AMERICA, WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IS URGE SOME MORE MODERATE DEMOCRATS TO HELP REFORM, LET'S SAY, THE ASYLUM PROCESS THAT IS BEING ABUSED TODAY BY ILLEGALS. YOU KNOW THAT ASYLUM APPLICATIONS HAVE INCREASED BY 1700% OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD ALONE? I WONDER WHY THAT'S HAPPENING. AT A MOMENT NOUN HAS THE GENERIC BALLOT TIGHTENING FROM A PREVIOUS 13-POINT ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS TO BASICALLY WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR, BASICALLY A DEAD HEAT NOW. THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT TO DISTRACT VOTERS FROM THEIR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY, THE ECONOMY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY, THE ECONOM ECONOMY. TO ALLOW THIS DISCHARGE DACA PETITION TO PROCEED COULD BE A MIDTERM TURNOUT KILLER, AND IT WILL SPLINTER THE PARTY. FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT ARE WORKING IN THE THINGS THAT WILL WIN YOU THE MAJORITY IN NOVEMBER. KEEP THE MAJORITY. JOBS, WAGES, SAFETY, AND YES, POCKETBOOK ISSUES. SO IF YOU ARE UPSET LIKE I AM ABOUT WHAT THESE LIBERAL REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO PUSH, CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN, CALL YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN, TELL THEM HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS. THIS PARLIAMENTARY STUNT WILL NOT GO DOWN WELL WITH THE G.O.P. BASE, I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. MY RADIO LINES WERE RINGING OFF THE HOOK TODAY. YOU WOULD THINK, BY THE WAY, THAT REPUBLICANS JUST BACK UP FOR A MOMENT, WOULD LEARN THEIR LESSON AT THIS POINT AFTER THAT DISASTROUS 2007 BUSH-McCAIN AMNESTY. THAT WENT DOWN IN FLAMES. A LOT OF US AND TALK RADIO WERE UP IN ARMS ABOUT THAT AND LEAD THE REVOLT AGAINST THAT. AND AFTER THE DISASTROUS 2013 SCHUMER-RUBIO GANG OF EIGHT FIASCO, THAT AMNESTY BEHEMOTH WAS SO BAD EVEN RUBIO HIMSELF DISOWNS IT NOW. AT LEAST HE LEARNED HIS LESSON. REPUBLICANS AS THE PARTY IN POWER HAVE A REAL CHANCE TO BREAK THE MIDTERM ELECTION CURSE, NOT LOSE MANY SEATS, MAYBE NOT LOSE ANY, MAYBE EVEN PICK UP A FEW SEATS, BUT ONLY IF
