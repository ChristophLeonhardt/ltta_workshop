invasion thousands of illegal immigrants marching north from Honduras El Salvador Guatemala through Mexico to the American border where they plan on coming through what do we do what do we do we tell them hell no go home this is take that with kirt Schlichter you know this is the same scam that they pulled in Europe organizers sent a giant mass of illegal aliens forward and dare the prospective host countries to do something about we they dare them to defend their borders they dare them to enforce their sovereignty well it didn't work in Europe except in kind of Eastern Europe where they said yeah you need to go but in Germany and the other kind of oh my gosh we are what do you think Donald Trump's gonna do don't Trump has already said what he's gonna do he's gonna treat this invasion like an invasion he's gonna mobilize the military wait a minute wait maker you can't mobilize the military the Posse Comitatus Act prevents stop right there stop timeout okay you're looking at the one guy well the first guy to write and publish a Law Review article about military supports a civil operations yeah that was me you know by the way Barack Obama was the editor a law review he never published anything I did publish something and it's been frequently cited because it is it's a it's an interesting article that talks about an area and no one else was talking about its first one and any one Posse Comitatus Act makes it illegal to use active military forces to enforce laws that's it that's all it does except it doesn't always apply first of all it doesn't apply to National Guard soldiers in state active duty status that's different than active duty segments don't act applied active duty guys when the president calls them up you see a president can do that there are laws that allow him to mobilize forces in disasters in riots in the insurrections and vacations so yeah he absolutely can use the military to defend our borders against these invaders now what are these guys trying to do they are trying to make us blink they think that they win either way either the the illegal aliens get to flow over the border and we're afraid to act to stop them and defend our sovereignty in which case we look terrible more illegal alien scum or or we stop them and they portray us the greatest you know young adult males who are unaccompanied but that don't matter they they want to make a scene now I think they're betting wrong I think they are betting that Americans will go oh can't we can't do the hard things like enforce our laws yeah I don't know do you guys know real Americans because I think real Americans are gonna say throw them out throw them out and frankly thought ropes should not play the game that makes the illegal aliens themselves the focus of his attention now yeah he should put military forces in there to physically stop them from coming in and he should pound on this drum all the way up to the midterms by the way because outside of blue cities you know the idea of a giant caravan of illegal aliens coming north demanding stuff is a bad visual but Donald Trump should not play their game he should not think that the center of this that the the decisive point is the actual caravan of illegal aliens itself it isn't there are two first there are the organizers they're leftists we're not sure exactly who they are but they're from the United States Jeff Sessions wake the heck up and indict these guys for conspiracy and it's a violate American immigration laws and item it dinah because that's what they're doing that's what they're doing the next thing is don't screw around with the illegals they've got nothing to lose you know he's got a lot to lose the head honchos in Honduras El Salvador Guatemala in Mexico they've got a lot to lose Donald Trump was right when he said hey I'm gonna cut off your aid their aid and and bar their leaders from entry make it painful give them an incentive to stop it and if they come up to the border this massive of illegal aliens comes up to our border and sits there make it Mexico's problems shut down the border I don't mean just kind of saying no I mean no one comes in no one not a single truck not one not a single car not a single person gates shut period talk about a freak out you think the cartels are gonna put up with that you think the cartels are gonna let a bunch of migrants interrupts their gravy train hell no Mexico fooled like a house of cards we hold all the cards they're trying to convince us that we don't they're trying to convince us that we can't use our power that there's nothing that we can do well fortunately we have a president who doesn't see things like that we have a president who's willing to use his power that's not who we are we're better than that man now we're gonna defend our sovereignty and anybody who gets between us and our sovereignty we're gonna run them over like a truck this is take that with Kirsty hey if you like take that
