living in<font color="#CCCCCC"> London in a shared house so</font>

50
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,680
that means i have to be a cheapskate

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,489

52
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,560
other day I wanted some nibble

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,870

54
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">your own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't like you have</font>

to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking for yourself and that</font>

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,450
can be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to do sometimes when</font>

57
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,580
when you're not used to like buying food

58
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,010

113
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,889
back to food when I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Sainsbury's</font>

114
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,960
to get the nibbles I also when I got a

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,590
packet of<font color="#E5E5E5"> four for a pound toffee krisp</font>

116
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,759
chocolate and hopefully they're not her

117
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,199
arm I don't want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting comments</font>

118
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,720
saying her arms dealers stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating the</font>

119
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,449
chocolate because them no<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

120
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've got vegetable fat toffee krisp</font>

121
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,229
it's like the best chocolate in the

122
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:00,060
world and I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that about boost</font>

123
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,710
chocolates because the flavor you get is

124
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,650
immense but then I had toffee krisp and

125
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,509
the flavor as well as the texture is

126
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,710
just crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can have four in one go</font>

127
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,970
obviously that's on days where do if you

128
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,949
like controlling myself but most days I

129
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,389
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and control myself so I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

130
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,979
like two or one but God Almighty these

131
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">taste good real good even if they're not</font>

132
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,560
for a pound it's worth paying 50 or 60 p

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,159
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chocolate bar of this sort kind</font>

how cool are they anyway I'm yet to wear

205
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,389
them because thinking in London is like

206
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,389
I would love to wear heels<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day</font>

207
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,430
because they really make it outfit look

208
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,320
great but it's just so hard get off the

209
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,360
tube wearing heels and a lot of people

210
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just have their heels in their bag</font>

211
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,809
and they go out in like<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable</font>

212
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,519
shoes or flip flops to get on the tubes

213
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,190
and then I see them changing at stations

214
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,958
putting their heel putting their heels

215
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,449

<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable shoes when I go out in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">London LS like there's an event and I'll</font>

228
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,630
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the pain and and like extra</font>

229
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,850
care and extra caution of walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

230
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,700
in heels<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah anyway anchor shackle</font>

231
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,980
moving on from that to something

232
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,650
slightly similar to that but for your

233
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,510
wrists are these cuffs and now you guys

234
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,980
have seen my other cuff slightly where

235
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,620
it's kind of more like the these cuffs

236
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,420
that I've been wearing I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

237
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">past couple months randomly at times</font>

238
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,910
because these are really<font color="#CCCCCC"> uncomfortable</font>

239
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:50,820
and to wear so i finally found shorter

240
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,880
more comfortable ones from ASOS 248
