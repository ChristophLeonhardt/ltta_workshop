Democrats have built a considerable amount of momentum when it comes to certain congressional races and state races and the more recent example has to do with a part of the country that Trump actually won in by a huge margin and how it has now flipped over to supporting Democratic candidates specifically Democratic candidate Mike Revis so to give you some details on my Greivis he was running against a GOP nominee and he actually won against that GOP nominee even considering the fact that most of the voters in that area had voted for Trump Mike Revis defeated GOP nominee David Linton by a four point margin in a seat Trump carried with 61% of the vote just over a year ago President Barack Obama lost by 12 points in that very area back in 2012 so let's take a nice look at Mike Revis there he is he's very happy about this win he's so happy he's incredibly young by the way I didn't know much about him and so this story broke but he has comes from a long line of Union supporting family members Union family members and his win also comes amid an investigation into Missouri Republican gov the Missouri's Republican governor for alleged blackmail against a woman with whom he had an affair so Republicans are facing some drama in Missouri right now and you know Revis swoops right in and he dominates that news the reasons to be excited are that is that this is a this is a these were very Republican districts there was not a chance that we're gonna win any of this to have a 31-point flip in the state legislature is is unbelievable for Democrats and it's happening in other states a couple of things that play here the Eric Greitens thing I mean he's the governor of Missouri it does make this a little different because he's in such disfavor now for having had the affair a but be for having allegedly blackmailed this woman can we stop for a second I'm actually surprised that it worked against him I mean I feel like at this day and age Republicans are like oh you had an affair awesome right well I mean that's true but what you're also seeing is a lot of the first time voters who voted for Donald Trump in a presidential election who were seduced by the guy and not the party are coming out and are not coming out for these races as they typically don't new voters don't come out at this time so that works too the Democrats favor going into the legislative races and going into the midterms because the midterms provide real voters who really care who really don't like what's going on in this case right now with Democrats it gives them a leg up and it helps Claire McCaskill certainly because the chances that she is go are you know she's one of those races that are really really tight right now that the Democrats really need to hang on to if they have any hope of winning the Senate so it's a very cool case study of what's going on both with the Trump voters with Missouri and with the fact that Democrats kind of see it gives them a really cool game plan I mean if you like this stuff you're into this of how to attack these races and I think so I think that's really and that's really great of course they didn't win all the races last night but they were I expect it to win any of them so so yeah every little bit helps them and it sends a message in Missouri so let's take a quick broader look at what's happening with some of these races because we're seeing a trend and you know politics tends to be a little cyclical where you know you have the party that's in charge things aren't going perfectly and then voters decide to punish the party in charge by voting against voting against them so that's definitely a play but you're right Michael I think you know there were also individuals who didn't identify with one party or the other and didn't like the way things were going and they saw Trump as someone who was different maybe voted for him and then didn't like the results I think that that could be a play as well yeah there's some of that at play yeah and for sure there's some of that but I think that there is just this idea that you know they came out for something that was a spectacle and when it's not a spectacle a good Horsham historically uh voters don't come out you saw with Jesse Ventura sought to a certain extent with with Arnold Schwarzenegger it's the same kind of it's the same kind of thing that's happening and and I think it has a bigger effect the difference between to a casual voter between president and state legislature is if that's a you know that's the hue a huge huge wide gap well Democrats have now picked up thirty five state legislative seats across the country in special elections while Republicans have picked up just four since Trump took office so again we're starting to see it see this play out in a broader sense and things are looking good for the midterm elections later this year but I also don't want those on the left to get comfortable and just assume hey we have a terrible president people are unhappy with him and so yeah you know oh no there's no reason to be comfortable this is right right in fact the whole idea is that this would invigorate the electorate in some way and many who might stay at home are now gonna go to the polls so very much to your point they have to show up if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every
