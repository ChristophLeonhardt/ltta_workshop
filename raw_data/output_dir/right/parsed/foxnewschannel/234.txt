>> GOOD MORNING, JON.
FOR THE 29th FRIDAY IN A ROW
PALESTINIANS ARE PROTESTING
ALONG THE ISRAEL/GAZA BORDER.
TODAY'S DEMONSTRATIONS
CERTAINLY HAVE INCREASED NOT
ONLY IN THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE
BUT ALSO IN THE TACTICS THAT
ARE BEING USED BY PALESTINIAN
PROTESTORS.
WE'VE SEEN DELIBERATE EFFORTS
TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OF ISRAELI
SNIPERS AND ACTUALLY A NUMBER
OF EFFORTS TO TRY TO CROSS THE
BORDER FROM GAZA INTO ISRAEL.
SO FAR FIVE PEOPLE ARE DEAD.
ONE PERSON KILLED RIGHT BY
BEHIND US HERE.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE SCENE.
THE BLACK SMOKE YOU SEE COMING
FROM TIRES SET ON FIRE BY
PALESTINIANS PROTESTORS.
YOU'LL HEAR A LOUD EXPLOSION
COMING FROM A PIPE BOMB OR
GRENADE.
WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF THOSE
TODAY.
ANY WHITE SMOKE IS TEAR GAS.
SETTLEMENT TALKS FAILED IN
CAIRO.
A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO TRY TO
BRING THE ISRAELIS TO THE TABLE
AND PALESTINIANS TO THE TABLE.
PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK
TO TRY TO FIND A LONGER-TERM
SETTLEMENT SOLUTIONS THOSE
TALKS HAVE NOT BEEN GOING WELL
LEADING TO ISSUES HERE ALONG
THE BORDER.
MOVING FORWARD THERE IS SOME
HOPE THAT THESE SIDES WILL BE
ABLE TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE.
A KEY PROBLEM NOW THOUGH ON THE
GAZA STRIP HAVING TO DO WITH
ELECTRICITY.
MOST PEOPLE HAVE FOUR TO FIVE
HOURS OF DAY OF ELECTRICITY AND
RECENTLY THE PALESTINIAN
AUTHORITY IN THE WEST BANK HAVE
SAID THEY AREN'T WILLING TO
PROVIDE ANY MONEY FOR FUEL TO
THE MAIN ELECTRICAL GRID HERE
IN GAZA.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS
UPSETTING MANY PROTESTORS.
NOT ONLY LOOKING AT A
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS BUT
ALSO HAMAS LEADERSHIP ON THE
GAZA STRIP AND THE PALESTINIAN
AUTHORITY IN THE WEST BANK
TRYING TO COME TO A SOLUTION
OVER WHAT WE'VE SEEN BEHIND ME
HERE TODAY FOCUSED ON THE
CONFLICT THAT HAS BEEN ERUPTING
EACH FRIDAY SINCE LATE MARCH
