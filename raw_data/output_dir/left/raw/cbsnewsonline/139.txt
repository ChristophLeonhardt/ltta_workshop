I KNOW THAT YOU ARE REALLY 

125

AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT IS BEING 

127
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:40,987
VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS 

128
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,253
PROCESS. 

129
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,088

SHOULD  PASS THE IMMIGRATION 

152
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,791
BILL IN -- AND THEN ON SUNDAY, 

153
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,059
HE WROTE ON TWITTER, I NEVER 

154
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:20,892
PUSHED REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE 

155
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,495
TO BOTH FOR THE IMMIGRATION 

156
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,063
BILL. 

157
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:30,570
EITHER ONE OR TWO? 

158
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,871
WHY WOULD HE LIE ABOUT THAT? 

159
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,472
>> HE DID NOT. 

160
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,673
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ALL 

161
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,008
ALONG AND WE HAVE LAID OUT THE 

162
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:35,708
PRIORITIES AND PRINCIPLES THAT 

163
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,143
WE SUPPORT AND THAT WE WANTED 

164
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,144
TO SEE REFLECTED IN LEGISLATION 

165
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,178
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE 

166
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,079
PRESIDENT WAS NOT AGGRESSIVELY 

167
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,013
LOBBYING MEMBERS BECAUSE HE 

168
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:42,014
KNEW THAT DEMOCRATS IN THE 

169
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:42,849
SENATE STILL WERE UNWILLING TO 

170
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,117
ACTUALLY COME TO THE TABLE AND 

171
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,084
FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN 

172
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:45,651
PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES. 

173
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,986
WE HEARD THIS I COULD HAVE 

174
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,121
GOTTEN IT THROUGH THE HOUSE BUT 

175
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,189
THAT DOES NOT WORK IF WE CANNOT 

176
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:58,097
GET INTO THE SENATE AND 

177
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:58,898
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IT 

178
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,732
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THEY DO 

179
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,733
NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO FIX 

180
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:01,033
PROBLEMS. 

181
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,301
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS 

182
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,770
<u>LL THE WAY, I GUESS, FOR SOME </u>

183
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,971
REASON THEY THINK THIS IS A 

184
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,571
GOOD ISSUE FOR THEM. 

185
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,372
ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT. 

186
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,407
FRANKLY, I THINK THAT IS 

187
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,207

>> WE HAVE BEEN VERY NICE TO 

239
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,729
CANADA FOR MANY YEARS, AND THEY 

240

AND HAVE REALLY GREAT TRADE AND 

247
00:06:43,736 --> 00:07:03,890
THEY REFUSED THAT AND 

248
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,624
ESCALATING TARIFFS AGAINST THE 

249
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,725
UNITED STATES DOES NOTHING TO 

250
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,058
HELP CANADA. 

251
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,026

THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING TO FIX 

253
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,529

GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR 

255
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,130

YEAR WHILE EXPERTS ARE SAYING 

304
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:22,735
IT COULD TAKE 10 TO 15 YEARS SO 

305
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,435
COULD WE GET CLARITY?

WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN WOULD BE 

329
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,375
THE ELECTIONS THAT WE DO NOT 

330

WANT ELECTION MEDDLING. 

331
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,779
DOES THAT MEAN THAT HE INTENDS 

332
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,713
TO RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF 

333
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,514

00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,212
WELL AND TRY TO PUT THEIR 

375

BILLION WORTH IN THE NEXT FEW 

378
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:18,384
DAYS. 

379
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,184
IS THE UNITED STATES WINNING 

380
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:19,919
THIS BATTLE? 

381
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:26,092
IF SO, HOW? 

382
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,293
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT IS 

383
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,327
FOCUSED NOT ON THE SHORT-TERM 

384
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,795
BUT ON THE LONG TERM, AND HE 

385
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,297
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 

386
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,031
DOING THINGS THAT HELP PROTECT 

387
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:36,035
AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN 

388
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,605
INDUSTRY. 

389
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,140
HE IS GOING TO KEEP PUSHING TO 

390
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,241
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD 

391
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:42,742
TRADE DEALS. 

392
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,876
WE HAVE BEEN IN TRADE DEFICITS 

393
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,777
WITH NEARLY EVERY COUNTRY AND, 

394
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,112
ACROSS THE GLOBE, FOR YEARS AND 

395
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,213
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO ENSURE 

396
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,047
THAT IT DOES NOT CONTINUE. 

397
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,348
>> Reporter:  FOR THE FOLKS 

398
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:54,954

399
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,155
THEY ARE HEARING, WE ARE IN IT 

400
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,489
FOR THE LONG TERM, IS THE LONG-

401
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:57,890
TERM WEEKS? 

402
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,123
MONTHS? 

403
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:58,390
YEARS? 

404
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,525
HOW LONG IS A LONG TERM? 

405
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,726
>> WE ARE NOT SETTING A 

406
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:09,502
TIMETABLE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

407
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,202
NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON. 

408
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,403
WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON A 

409
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,605
NUMBER OF FRONTS ON THE 

410
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,439
PRESIDENT, AGAIN, IS COMMITTED 

411
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,473
TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE GOOD 

412
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:14,706
DEALS. 

413
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:16,275
HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET RID OF 

414
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,276
ALL TARIFFS AND ALL BARRIERS 

415
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,511
BUT IF THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT 

416
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,945
WANT TO DO THAT, HE WOULD BE 

417
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,547
HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND MAKE THAT 

418
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,515
HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. 

419
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,115
TO MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD 

420
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:23,382
QUICKER.

>> I DO NOT HAVE ANY CHANGES 

424
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,186
RIGHT NOW. 

425
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,053
>> Reporter:  TWO 

426
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:28,888
CLARIFICATIONS QUICKLY ON TWO 

427
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,355
DIFFERENT TOPICS. 

428
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,489
WITH THE PRESIDENT LIKE TO SEE 

429
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,290
ROE VERSUS WADE OVERTURNED? 

430
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,525
>> ONCE AGAIN, I'M NOT GETTING 

431
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:49,675
INTO ANY SPECIFICS. 

432
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,910
THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT. 

433
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,044
>> Reporter: I AM SAYING DOES 

434
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,546
HE HIMSELF AS A MATTER OF HOW 

435
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,747
HE FEELS, HIS OWN POLICY, WANT 

436
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,481
TO SEE IT OVERTURNED? 

437
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,116
>> AS THIS IS ONGOING I AM NOT 

438
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,417
GOING TO WEIGH IN ON ANYTHING 

439
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,418
SPECIFIC AT THIS POINT. 

440
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,653
>> Reporter: IT IS A POLICY 

441
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:00,920
QUESTION. 

442
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,654
I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT THE 

443
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,087
CONVERSATION. 

444
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:02,855
SO THAT I UNDERSTAND. 

445
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,789
I'M TELLING YOU THAT WHILE WE 

446
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,624
ARE IN THE MIDDLE I DO NOT HAVE 

447
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,325
AN  DATED COMMENT. 

448
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,059
>> Reporter: DOES THAT 

449
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,160
PRESIDENT STILL  TRUST KIM JONG-

450
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,327
UN? 

451
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,528
DOES HE BELIEVE HE IS 

452
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:09,862
NEGOTIATING? 

453
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:10,729
>> WE SEE MOMENTUM IN THE 

454
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,964
PROCESS AND WE HAVE HAD GOOD 

455
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:12,965
CONVERSATIONS AS RECENTLY AS 

456
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:13,999
YESTERDAY AND WE WILL CONTINUE 

457
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:14,700
THOSE CONVERSATIONS LATER THIS 

458
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,535
WEEK AND PUSH FORWARD. úWHEN TH 

459
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:23,209
THAT THAT WTO TRADE THEY --  IF 

460
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,310
THAT DOES NOT CHANGE, HE WILL 

461
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,010
DO SOMETHING. 

462
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,644
IS SEEN CONSIDERING ANYTHING 

463
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,346
OTHER THAN LEAVING THE WTO AND 

464
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:27,913
DOES HE HAVE A TIMETABLE? 

465
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,813
>> AS THE SECRETARY MANAGEMENT 

466
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:29,815
AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE SAID 

467
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,616
THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. 

468
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,451
THAT THE U.S. IS LEAVING THE 

469
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:43,462
WTO BUT HE HAS MADE CLEAR THAT 

470
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,463
HE HAS CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE 

471
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,664
A NUMBER OF ASPECTS THAT HE 

472
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,999
DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE FAIR AND 

473
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,933
TO CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES 

474
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,635
HAVE USED THE WTO TO THEIR OWN 

475
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,569
ADVANTAGE AND WE ARE FOCUSED ON 

476
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,237
FIXING THE SYSTEM. 

477
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,004
THAT WOULD INCLUDE THAT. 

478
00:12:52,004 --> 00:13:00,012
>> Reporter:  TODAY, IF THE 

479
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,080
TREATMENT DOES NOT CHANGE THAT 

480
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,281
HE WILL DO SOMETHING BUT WHAT 

481
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:02,915
WAS HE REFERRING TO? 

482
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,450
>> I DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC 

483
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,451
ANNOUNCEMENT ON WHAT HE DID. 

484
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,785
RIGHT NOW HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 

485
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,987
THE SYSTEM GET FIXED AND THAT 

486
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,321
IS WHAT HE IS FOCUSED ON. 

487
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,623
>> Reporter: DOES HE FEEL THAT  

488
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,824
JOHN McCAIN SHOULD RESIGN SO 

489
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,058
THAT HE CAN PICK A CENTER THAT 

490
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,293
WILL VOTE ON THE SUPREME COURT 

491
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:14,560
NOMINEE? 

492
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,028
>> Reporter: THIS IS A PIVOTAL 

493
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:16,962
CHOICE FOR THE PRESIDENT, GOING 

494
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,963
TO AFFECT HIS LEGACY FOR 

495
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,134
DECADES TO COME.  

496
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,135
WHY IS THE WHITE HOUSE MOVING 

497
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,869
THE SO QUICKLY? 

498
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:24,670
WHEN HE ANNOUNCES ON MONDAY, 

499
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,071
THAT WILL BE JUST A LITTLE OVER 

500
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,273
TWO WEEKS, I THINK, SINCE 

501
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:27,907
KENNEDY ANNOUNCED HE IS 

502
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:28,207
RETIRING. 

503
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,408
>> THE PRESIDENT PUT OUT HIS 

504
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,643
LISTED NEARLY 2 YEARS AGO OF 

505
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,543
WHAT THE INDIVIDUALS WOULD LOOK 

506
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:44,757
LIKE AND HE HAS CONTINUED THEY 

507
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,191
-- HE MADE UPDATES TO THE LIST 

508
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,493
LAST YEAR, AND THESE ARE ALL 

509
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,294
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN 

510
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,361
LOOKED AT AND CONSIDERED, NOT 

511
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,896
JUST FOR THE LAST WEEK BUT FOR 

512
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,697
THE LAST TWO YEARS. 

513
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:52,297
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT 

514
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:53,432
HAS BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL IN, 

515
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,733
AND HE IS GOING TO MAKE THE 

516
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,768
RIGHT DECISION WHEN THE MOMENT 

517
00:13:55,768 --> 00:14:00,272
COMES ON MONDAY.  

518
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,272

519
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:02,341
ON THE QUESTION THAT JEFF 

520
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:02,641
ASKED. 

521
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,442
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE PRESIDENT 

522
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,677
WANT TO SEE FROM THE WTO? 

523
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,978
WHAT ACTIONS DOES HE EXPECT 

524
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:06,345
THEM TO TAKE? 

525
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,513
>> THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO

00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,914
SEE JUST AN OVERALL MORE FAIR 

527
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,515
TRADING SYSTEM.  

528
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,349
WE WILL BE CONTINUING 

529
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:10,949
NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL 

530
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:11,750

TELL US IF THE PRESIDENT WATCH 

536
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:21,927
THE INTERVIEW THIS MORNING AND 

537
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:22,962
POTENTIALLY  HOW HE FEELS ABOUT 

538
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:23,996
THE IDEA THAT THE FORMER 

539
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:24,997
ATTORNEY SAID THAT HE WOULD 

540
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,666
JUDGMENT HE WOULD PUT HIS WIFE 

541
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:33,005
AND THE SMART 

542
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,306
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WEIGH IN ON 

543
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,208
THIS ISSUE AND I REFER YOU TO 

544
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:47,620

QUESTION, YOU MADE IT VERY 

547
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,556
CLEAR THAT SANCTIONS FOR RUSSIA 

548
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,790
AS IT PERTAINS TO CRIMEA ARE 

549
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,025
NOT ON THE TABLE IN THE MEETING 

550
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:53,826

00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,227
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

THE NEXT ENTRANCE.  

563
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,875
>> Reporter: A WEEK AGO, YOU 

564
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,377
TOLD US THAT THE PRESIDENT 

565
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:11,944
INTENDED TO CALL PRESIDENT 

566
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:12,911
HEARD ONE OF TURKEY  FOLLOWING 

567
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:13,912
HIS REELECTION OR HIS ELECTION 

568
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:17,282
AS PRESIDENT AND WE NEVER GOT A 

569
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:24,089
READOUT ON THAT CALL OR WHETHER 

570
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,090
OR NOT HE CONGRATULATED HIM. 

571
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,425
WOULD YOU ELUCIDATE ON THE CALL 

572
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,293
AND THA HE MADE IT TO THE 

573
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:36,802

574
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,103
>> YOU ALWAYS HAVE ONE OF THOSE 

575
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:38,904
THINGS IN THERE, JOHN. 

576
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,139
I KNOW THAT THEY SPOKE LAST 

577
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:40,339

DEBATE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON, 

587
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,082
THE OPENING QUESTION WAS ABOUT 

588
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,316
THIS VERY SUBJECT AND HE DID 

589
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,985
SAY THAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL 

590
00:15:52,985 --> 00:16:01,760
OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE AND 

591
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,928
THE ISSUE OF ABORTION WOULD BE 

592
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:03,829
RETURNED TO THE STATES. 

593
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:04,963
IS THAT STILL HIS POSITION NOW? 

594
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,165
>> THE PRESIDENT IS PRO-LIFE, 

595
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:12,004
BUT IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS OF 

596
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:12,738

598
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,074
LAST WEEK, HE IS NOT GOING TO 

599
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,442
DISCUSS SPECIFIC CASES WITH 

600
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,345
THOSE NOMINEES. 

601
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:21,146

YOU SAID THAT A LOT OF 

604
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,682
NEGOTIATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 

605
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:23,982
RIGHT NOW. 

606
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,017
IS THERE ANY REASON TO ASSUME 

607
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,552
OR TO SEE THAT THERE HAS BEEN 

608
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,653
PROGRESS WITH THE CHINESE  

609
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,487

>> WE ARE CONTINUING THE 

612
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:30,622
NEGOTIATIONS. 

613
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,824
I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER AT THIS 

614
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,057
POINT. 

615
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:41,700
>> Reporter:  NOW THAT GOODLAD

HOUSE, IS THE PRESIDENT OPEN TO 

618
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,137
ANY STAND-ALONE BILL WHICH 

619
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,238
WOULD STOP FAMILY SEPARATION AT 

620
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:46,638
THE BORDER? 

621
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,673
PERMANENTLY AND REFORM THE U.S. 

622
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,040

THE HOUSE? 

626
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,044
>> WE HAVE TO SEE THE SPECIFIC 

627
00:16:52,044 --> 00:17:04,522
LEGISLATION BEFORE WE GO IN 

628
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:05,858
DIRECTLY BUT IT WOULD BE OPEN 

629
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,657
TO LEGISLATION THAT FIXES THE 

630
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:07,593
BROKEN SYSTEM IF DEMOCRATS 

631
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,894
WOULD SHOW UP TO DO THEIR JOBS 

632
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:09,761
AND PARTICIPATE IN SOLUTIONS. 

633
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,063
WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS 

634
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:11,762
THOSE AND, AGAIN, SUPPORTIVE 

635
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,098
THINGS THAT HELP TO FIX THE 

636
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:13,464
BROKEN SYSTEM. 

637
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:14,633
>> Reporter:  WHAT IS CURRENT 

638
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,834
U.S. POLICY AT THE BORDER? 

639
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,835
IS IT ZERO-TOLERANCE OR CATCH 

640
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,167
AND RELEASE? 

641
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,237
>> THE EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS 

642
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,470
BOUGHT TIME FOR CONGRESS BUT 

643
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,343
THAT THEY -- THE CLOCK IS 

644
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,644
TICKING AND CONGRESS NEEDS TO 

645
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,678
ACT TO FIX THIS PROCESS BECAUSE 

646
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,079
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME ON 

647
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,414

648
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:30,315

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHICH 

654
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,921
GENERALLY WORKS VERY WELL WITH

00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:45,964
REPUBLICAN -- THEY WANT THEM TO 

656
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:46,698
OPPOSE THE TARIFF AGENDA AND 

657
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,833
SAYS THAT THE MINISTRATION IS 

658
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,734
THREATENING TO UNDERMINE THE 

659
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,368
ECONOMIC PROGRESS THEY HAVE 

660
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,369
WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE. 

661
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,637
WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT MAKE OF 

662
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,004
THAT CRITICISM? 

663
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,072
>> THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON 

664
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:54,605
HELPING PROTECT AMERICAN 

665
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:55,206

CREATE A FAIR PLAYING FIELD. 

667
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,643
THAT IS WHAT HE IS HOPING TO 

668
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,744
ACHIEVE AND WE ARE CONFIDENT. 

669
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,678

704
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,783
MANY TIMES ABOUT FIXING THE 

705
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,917
OVERALL SYSTEM, BOTH ILLEGAL 

706
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:13,417

WE WANTED TO CERTAINLY ADDRESS 

708
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,355
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 

709

HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, 

712
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,339
THERE IS A PROCESS THAT PEOPLE 

713
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,540
SHOULD FOLLOW AND WE WANT TO 

714
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,775

TO DO MORE TO CONTROL 

723
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,460
IMMIGRATION. 

724
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,395
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THREATENED 

725
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,529
TO CUT FORWARD A TWO CENTRAL 

726

STEPS THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TAKEN

TO CARRY OUT THIS THREAT? 

732
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,703
HAVE THERE BEEN MEETINGS WITH 

733
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,003

>> FRANKLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE
