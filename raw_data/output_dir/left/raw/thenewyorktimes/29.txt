00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,100
How does a group of
longhorn crazy ants

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,660
come together to
solve a problem?

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,300
These ants are known to be
very good at cooperating

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,450
to bring a big chunk of
food, like a cricket,

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,950
back to the nest.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,570
To find out,
researchers at the

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,010
University of Colorado, Boulder,
tested the ants.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,420
First, they gave
them a bit of tuna.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,689
Then they blocked their
way to the nest with Legos.

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,580
The ants appear to
move almost at random,

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,650
but the researchers
found that they actually

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,280
used two strategies.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,860
The first strategy is simple:

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,030
Move along a barrier until it
ends, then head for the nest.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,640
But in a cul-de-sac,
when enough time

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,210
passed without success, the
ants switched to strategy two.

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,780
They started to carry the
tuna away from the nest.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,960
Somehow, the ants
communicate a direction

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,150
and reach a consensus.

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,990
The ants also seem to realize
when theyâ€™re in a trap.

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,510
When the researchers
blocked all exits,

22
00:01:09,510 --> 00:00:00,000
the ants pretty quickly stopped
their efforts and gave up.
