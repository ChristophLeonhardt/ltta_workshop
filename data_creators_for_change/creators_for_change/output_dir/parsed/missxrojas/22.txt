having spent all of my time on an
escalator I can never climb all the way
to the top I handed over a password and
posting rights to a friend and decided
to leave a hundred and forty characters
behind at first I felt like I had been
gifted time time not staring timeless
angry time where I felt like I was
focused rather than faster but then as
it always does the world turned upside
down for a bit and I thought of how the
internet displays I defend it thought
was good inherently had become another
opportunity to be unkind to myself
altars for animosity places where we
thought we were talking to the world but
instead we were talking to each other
raised voices and feeling more alone
than ever before this is back burner
I can't stop thinking of a scene in
gong-gong he's dragging a hair and then
suddenly she's looking right at him eyes
locked and at once his - its violent
well you like what you see inside my
head when I
I don't like myself with my background
with the chin down straight on when you
see all of me you will know I've been
lying framing parts me out but I hate
until I'm not in the frame at all
but for now I'm in my own way our move
lengths back to the light
I can't refrain myself I feel like I had
too much fun
as the seasons change breasts bite times
weeks away two focuses of the others
I know how to do that I know how to
prepare I know how to put myself out my
head
to the point where I forget everything
about myself I wish I could forget all
the bad things I say to myself
Rachel thanks Megan only looks for fees
the ass is lost it becomes not be
pretentious staple reaching for hammer
as I do
before the adventure I take a trip to
the farmers market and vitamin animals
the ritual of endocrine
familiar to me that it's in his work to
follow another bit to it
this becomes breakfast staple of home of
homes but also a reliable thing I saw a
thread something else to not think about
you
you
when I returned the colors of the early
November farmers market move me to tears
I haven't slept well week however one
with gratitude and love and pockets full
of wallpaper I celebrate it I wrote to
the group chat
it's like a Suzanne
later that day I stood by a big shelf
and put a hand of my books old friends
I have spent this month away I have
spent last month away I will spend next
month away those mutts involve trays
preparing for myself and for what I am
looking for putting it all in one
Oh
on this night I was waiting for the
release of reputation and by the time I
finished I had 15 tracks about being
away about peeling back all the parts of
you and how others see about what you
regret and where you go from here about
carrying all the parts the prism of the
screen cannot see the colors that it
cannot refract the gradient from
concentrated at the top of the page to
when the paint runs out
as that paint falls a droplet on the run
we stretch ourselves out and make room
for more
you
