TAKES THE TIME TO GET THIS DONE

68
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:47,443
RIGHT.

69
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:48,778
BORDER STATE REPUBLICANS SAY

70
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:51,046
THAT THE ANSWER IS HANDLING

71
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,082
FAMILIES IN A SYMPATHETIC WAY.

72
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:54,450
>> WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE LAW

73
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,485
BUT DO SO IN A WAY THAT KEEPS

74
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:57,753
FAMILIES TOGETHER IN A HUMANE,

75
00:01:57,753 --> 00:02:00,589
COMPASSIONATE WAY.

76
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:04,126
IT IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM.

77
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:05,661
NOT ENFORCING THE LAW IS NOT AN

78
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:06,862
OPTION, AT LEAST FOR ME.

79
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:09,064

IF YOU SEND ONE BACK, SEND THEM

84
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:15,638
ALL BACK.

85
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:16,205
SENATE JUDICIARY SAYS

86
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:19,175
PRESIDENT TRUMP MUST BE ON BOARD

00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:20,676
IMMIGRATION.

89
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,311
>> THE LEADER WILL NOT BRING UP

90
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:25,781
ANY IMMIGRATION BILLS THAT THE

91
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:29,185
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT COMMITTED

92
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:30,186
TO SIGNING.

PRESIDENT WON'T SIGN IT, IT'S

97
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,857
NOT GOING TO COME UP.

98
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:37,693
>> IN HEARINGS, THE ISSUE

99
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:38,694
REMAINS A DOMINANT TOPIC.

100
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:40,696
>> ARE YOU NOT SHAKEN BY THE

101
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,498
VOICES AND FACES OF THE CHILDREN

102
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:44,834
TORN AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES?

103
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,335
>> OF COURSE I AM BUT I AM ALSO

104
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:49,271
SHAKEN BY THE STORIES I HEAR

105
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:50,306
ABOUT PARENTS DRAGGING THEIR

106
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:51,674
LITTLE KIDS DO THE DESERT.

107
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:54,243
>> ARE YOU AWARE --

108
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,679
>> THERE IS A POLITICAL

109
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,313
COMPONENT WHICH COULD PUT

110
00:02:57,313 --> 00:02:59,048
DEMOCRATS UP FOR REELECTION IN

111
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:00,082

ARRESTS WITHIN 100 MILES OF THE

117
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:10,926
BORDER.

118
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,127
>> IF THAT BOTHERS SUSAN COMEAU

119
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:13,195
WILL TAKE IT OUT.

120
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:15,564

SEASON MAKES IT A RED-HOT

129
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:42,892
POLITICAL ISSUE.

130
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:43,626
AS YOU KNOW, NOT EASY TO SOLVE.

131
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:44,293
>> Bret: THE FEINSTEIN BILL,

132
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:45,027
DOES IT HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING

133
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:45,361
THROUGH?

134
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:45,761
POLITICALLY.

POLITICALLY JEOPARDIZING.

141
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:56,438
>> I HAVE TALKED TO REPUBLICAN

142
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:57,873
SOURCES WHO SAY THEY THINK THE

143
00:03:57,873 --> 00:03:58,807
DEMOCRAT SENATORS WERE LOOKING
