I'm bill shine is going to join the White House staff he will serve as assistant to the president he will also be serving as deputy chief of staff for communications as well bill Shawn apparently going to be running the comms department there at the White House of course most recently he was the co-president of Fox News also Fox Business this is something as you know hon something that had been whispered about a few weeks ago and then maybe about a week ago those whispers ceased and people were talking about it openly and loudly and now it would seem to be official former Fox News executive very close to Roger Ailes the network's ousted chairman Bill Shawn running comms there at the White House Hanz not much of a surprise here it would seem as if this was more of a question of when not if right correct but titles are important and they always say the cheapest phrase in politics is a title increase bill shines title is deputy chief of staff now there's the four cause behind that but that elevates them slightly above than what a traditional communications director will be now we'll have to figure out just what his line of authority is does he have a direct report to the President or will he reporting to be reporting to John Kelly and then go through the president so titles matter that is a slightly higher title that's probably the one the bill Cheyne wanted because he's not just simply a communications director he's a deputy chief of staff and in the past when you have had communications directors are people more on the political side in a White House get that deputy role it's complicated things and I'm thinking of Karl Rove remember he was the president's advisor but then he took a deputy chief of staff role towards the end of the Bush administration and that's some people inside the Bush administration would have even said was too much power for a political person and the deputy Chiefs of Staff role either want someone that can make the trains run on time someone like a Joe Hagin current deputy chief of staff slated to leave or you want someone that really knows the hill very well those have been the traditional molds for deputies having someone out there was such a messaging priority in that deputy role gives you a sense of this White House is gearing up for the midterm and they want to make sure that their message is firing on all cylinders especially with conservative media outlets that can sometimes echo often echo what the president is trying to drive home Greg hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
