IN HIS FIRST EXTENSIVE INTERVIEW

7
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,908
ON ALL OF THIS THAT THE

00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:26,880
PEOPLE COMING UP AND TALKING

9
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:27,814
ABOUT ABUSE.

10
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:29,115
NO ONE REPORTED ABUSE TO ME.

11
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,517
IF THEY HAD, I WOULD HAVE DEALT

12
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:31,451
WITH IT.

13
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:35,288
WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS THE

14
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:36,723
GUYS THAT ARE SAYING THIS, I

15
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:37,724
KNOW THEY KNOW THE TRUTH.

16
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:38,658
I KNOW THEY DO.

17
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,427
>> ALL RIGHT.

18
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:41,428
OUR SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER

19
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,629

00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:46,199
CHAD, TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGY

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,233
FROM JIM JORDAN.

24
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:49,903
HE MADE SOME SMALLER COMMENTS AT

25
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:51,604
A FOURTH OF JULY PARADE, AND

26
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:53,673
WHATNOT, BUT SITTING DOWN WITH

27
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:54,908
BRET THERE'S A CLEAR STRATEGY

28
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,309
HERE TO PUSH BACK.

29
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,977
>> RIGHT.

30
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:59,179
HE FEELS VERY UPSET.

31
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,314
HE SAYS, LOOK, I WORKED WITH THE

32
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:01,648
FOLKS --

33
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:02,349
>> THE ACCUSER.

34
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,584
>> RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.

35
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:06,486
HE SAYS, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

36
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:09,589
HIS ISSUE HAS BEEN TO GO AFTER

37
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,825
THE ACCUSER.

38
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:28,708
MILIEU HE HOLDS MORE CONTEMPT

39
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:28,975
FOR.

40
00:01:28,976 --> 00:01:34,714
>> MIKE DISABATO HAS ARRESTED

41
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:36,416
FIVE MONTHS AGO, HE HAS ALL

42
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:41,788
HAVE COME FORWARD THAT ARE NOT

43
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,789
NAMED MIKE DISABATO.

44
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,324
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, WAIT A

45
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:48,428
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW JIM

46
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:51,765
JORDAN, WHO LIKE HIM, AND SAY HE

47
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,400
NEEDS TO SPEAK UP.

48
00:01:53,401 --> 00:02:00,140
>> WHAT ABOUT PERKINS COIE WHO

49
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:04,244
SENT OUT EMAILS TO CONGRESSMAN

50
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:05,412
JORDAN, HE SAYS HE DOESN'T

51
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:05,912
RECEIVE THEM.

52
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:08,415
IN THE LAST ELECTION, WE'VE

53
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:16,423
HEARD ABOUT HOW PERKINS COIE WAS

54
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:20,794
INVOLVED IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE

55
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:21,327
ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER.

56
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:23,730
>> HE SAID THAT'S THE HILLARY

57
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,230
CLINTON LAW FIRM.

58
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,632
I THINK IT'S FUNNY WHEN I TAKE

59
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,267
ON ONE OF THESE WITNESSES, AND

60
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:28,868
EVERY LIBERAL IN THE COUNTRY CAN

61
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:30,370
FIND MY EMAIL AND PHONE NUMBER

62
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,572
AND CALL UP AND EXPRESS THEIR

63
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:34,174
VIEWS, AND HE SAYS THEY CAN'T

64
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:35,809
GET AHOLD OF ME?

65
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,343
I'VE BEEN PRIVY TO THE EMAIL

66
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:38,745
SENT TO THE INCORRECT EMAIL

67
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:43,450
TRANSACTIONAL, BUT JIM JORDAN

68
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,351
SAYS HE'S GOING TO TALK WITH

69
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:46,386
THEM NEXT WEEK.

70
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:47,387
IF YOU'RE DOING AN

71
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:48,688
INVESTIGATION, IS THERE A

72
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:49,689
UNIVERSE OF 10 PEOPLE?

73
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,591
IS THERE A UNIVERSE OF 100

74
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:51,925
PEOPLE?

75
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:54,627
IF THERE'S PEOPLE WHO THEY

WANTED TO TALK TO, THEY COULD

78
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:00,867
HAVE FOUND JIM JORDAN.

79
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:02,368
HE'S NOT HARD TO FIND.

80
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:05,572
>> DURING THE ME TOO MOVEMENT,

81
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:09,209
PROMINENT PEOPLE, LIKE HARVEY

82
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,643
WEINSTEIN, A GRAND JURY IN NEW

83
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:12,445

>> THEY COULD HAVE THEM LOOK AT

88
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:35,735
THIS TO UNDERSTAND, GET CLARITY.

89
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:37,604
THE FREE CAUCUS, HIM ONE OF THE

90
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:40,340
TWO HEAD HONCHOS, THEY HAVE TO

91
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:41,541
MAKE A DECISION WHEN MEMBERS

92
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,309
RETURN, TO SAY, WAIT A MINUTE,

93
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,744

I DID TALK TO SOME TONIGHT.

99
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,418
THEY'RE CIRCLING THE WAGONS.

100
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,120
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED

101
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:56,222
WITH SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE AN

102
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:59,459
ETHICS PROBLEM LIKE THIS, ED.

103
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,161
