1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,240
“They say that the movement
won’t work in Kansas.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,180
They say, ‘Don’t go to Kansas,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,039
they won’t accept you there.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,480
They won't share
your values there,

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,280
that you won’t have
common ground with anyone.’

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
We all know that that is not true.”

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,900
Welcome to Wichita,
home of Koch Industries,

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,480
as in billionaire
Republican megadonors

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,240
Charles and David Koch.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,245
This district hasn’t sent
a Democrat to Congress

11
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:37,305
in over 20 years.

12
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:41,460
Trump won the general election
in Kansas by a landslide.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,260
But the left has an
interesting story here.

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,010
Bernie Sanders got
twice as many votes

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,680
as Hillary Clinton
in the primary.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,050
Sanders’s message of
universal health care

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,890
and affordable education
resonates with Kansans.

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,334
“I’m a single father.

19
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,000
My occupation right
now is construction.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,560
I do a lot of remodeling.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,480
I’m a huge supporter
of Bernie.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,060
And I think it’s awesome that
Alexandria, you know,

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,650
won the election there.”

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,390
Thousands here
recently lined up

25
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,310
to see rising Democratic star
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,218
and Senator Sanders.

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,740
The pair came to
Kansas to rally

28
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,740
for progressive Democrat
House candidates.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,920
Leftists are hoping that
Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning win

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,990
in New York’s 14th District
can serve as a model

31
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,540
even in red states.

32
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,331
“The people support the ideas
that James is campaigning on.

33
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,070
All right?

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,580
It’s just a question of
bringing them to the polls.

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,260
If James wins here,

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,850
this will be not only another

37
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,440
progressive member
to the Congress,

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,300
this’ll be a shot heard around —
not just this country —

39
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,730
the world.

40
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,080
“I’m excited and humbled
to be here.”

41
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:04,995
“Happy people.”

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,100
“Because I’m a teacher

43
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,796
and have concerns
about funding,

44
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:14,870
not only in my classroom,
but just across districts,

45
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,530
I felt it was important to come.

46
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,510
I work in a population that
is very impoverished.

47
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,810
During the winter you 
would see our kids

48
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,490
coming to school in blankets.”

49
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,480
“I’m so happy to introduce
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.”

50
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,460
“This is the defining moment,

51
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,040
not just for the state of Kansas,

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,643
but for this nation.”

53
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,780
“The thing is is that there are
a lot of working families here.

54
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,150
There’s a lot of
blue collar here.

55
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,160
And I think the reason that
Trump won resoundingly here

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,420
was because of that.”

57
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,800
“It was very empowering
to hear her speak.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,090
She comes from the Bronx.

59
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,080
I grew up in one of the poorest
zip codes in Wichita,

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,180
so it’s very moving
to be here today

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,370
because it hits home.”

62
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,180
“You all are very lucky,
and very blessed

63
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,525
to have James Thompson
as a candidate.

64
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:19,075
To have a man that so truly
cares for the needs

65
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,160
of working-class people

66
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,570
and fights for the
dignity of his neighbors.

67
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,660
You’re very lucky.”

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,860
“Because I know what it’s like
to struggle to make ends meet.

69
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,990
What it’s like to have
to choose between,

70
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,570
you know, paying for food for
your kids or paying the rent.”

71
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,020
It’s a long shot for Thompson.

72
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,840
But even if he
comes close,

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,120
it will be further proof of
concept for progressives

74
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,430
who want to reimagine
the Democratic Party

75
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,196
and take back power
from Republicans.

76
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,330
“We must’ve gotten
off at the wrong stop

77
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,180
because people
told me that Kansas

78
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,040
was a Republican state.

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't look like that today.”
