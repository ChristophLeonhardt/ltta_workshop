00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:10,031
YEARS AND BIG DIP IN

ANTHEM PROTESTS.

13
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:22,077
THE PLAYERS DON'T WANT TO

14
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:22,978
STAND, THEY HAVE TO STAY IN

15
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:24,112
THE LOCKER ROOM OR THEIR

16
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,146
TEAM WILL BE FINED.

17
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:26,181
ALREADY THE NFL PLAYERS

18
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:28,149
UNION HAS PROTESTED THE RULE

19
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:29,584
AND NEW YORK JETS CHAIRMAN

20
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,318
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON SAYS THE

21
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:31,720
TEAM WILL SIMPLY PAY THE

22
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,688
FINES IF HIS PLAYERS DECIDE

23
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:35,223
TO PROTEST.

24
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:37,359
JASON WHITLOCK IS WITH FOX

25
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,526
SPORTS 1 A FREQUENT GUEST ON

26
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:39,828
THIS SHOW ANSWERED JOINS US

27
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:40,262
NOW.

28
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:41,229
JASON, THANKS FOR COMING ON.

29
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,897
>> NO PROBLEM, THANK YOU FOR

30
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:44,899
HAVING ME.

31
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,138
>> Tucker: READ THE GOODELL

32
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:50,605
STATEMENT.

33
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:53,508
IT READS AS:

34
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:59,247
ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE

35
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,849
POSITIONS ON GNAT NAFTA OR

36
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:01,349
TAX POLICY NEXT?

37
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:02,617
I THOUGHT IT WAS FOOTBALL

38
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:03,018
LEAGUE, NO?

39
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:04,819
>> THEY ARE NOT GOING TO, --

40
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,354
LISTEN, I THINK ROGER

41
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:07,589
GOODELL AND THE NFL ARE

42
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,824
TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE.

43
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:10,292
>> Tucker: YEAH.

44
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:12,661
>> I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN

45
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:13,895
ACCOMPLISH THAT I THINK SOME

46
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:15,530
PEOPLE ARE HEARTENED, OKAY,

47
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,332
THE PLAYERS THAT TAKE THE

48
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:19,167
FIELD WILL BE CALLED UPON TO

49
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:20,535
STAND AND RESPECT THE

50
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:21,803
NATIONAL ANTHEM AND THE

51
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:22,137
FLAG.

52
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:24,806
BUT I THINK HE HAS OPENED AN

53
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:26,007
OPPORTUNITY FOR A

54
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,008
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

55
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:28,610
PLAYERS THAT DON'T COME OUT

56
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,745
ON THE FIELD AND THAT WILL

57
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:32,681
DRIVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

58
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,716
NFL THAT MIGHT BE A BIT

59
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:35,617
UNCOMFORTABLE AND NOT WHAT

60
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,252
THE LEAGUE WANTS.

61
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,422
I REALLY THINK, TUCKER, THEY

62
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:41,523
SHOULD HAVE DONE ONE OF TWO

63
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:42,324
THINGS.

64
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:42,991
THEYED COULD HAVE SAID TO

65
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,559
THE PLAYERS, LOOK, WE ARE

66
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,627
JUST GOING TO REMOVE THE

67
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:47,529
NATIONAL ANTHEM FROM YOUR

68
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:47,930
INVOLVEMENT.

69
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,064
EVERYBODY STAY IN THE LOCKER

70
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:49,364
ROOM.

71
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:51,333
WE'LL JUST DO IT WITH OUR

72
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:51,633
FANS.

73
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,335
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OPTION

74
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:53,602
ONE.

75
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:54,870
OPTION TWO, AND IT MIGHT

76
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,338
HAVE BEEN THE ONE I WOULD

77
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:57,606
HAVE PREFERRED, I WISH HE

78
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:58,874
WOULD HAVE JUST SAID LOOK,

79
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:00,442
IF YOU COME OUT AND YOU

80
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:01,143
DISRESPECT THE NATIONAL

81
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:02,778
ANTHEM, YOU WON'T PLAY.

82
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:04,313
YOU WILL STILL GET PAID, BUT

83
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:05,314
YOU WON'T PLAY.

84
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:08,116
AND SO, THAT WILL FORCE NFL

85
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:11,653
OWNERS AND COACHES TO BE A

86
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:12,821
BIT MORE VIGILANT ABOUT WHO

87
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:15,223
IS ON THEIR TEAM AND WHETHER

88
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:16,758
THESE PLAYERS WANT TO HURT

89
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:18,026
THEIR TEAM BY HONORING THEIR

90
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:20,662
PROTEST DURING THE GAME

91
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:22,597
MAKES THEM REAL CONSEQUENCES

92
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:25,133
FOR THAT PROTEST U AND.

93
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:25,734
>> Tucker: VERY SMART.

94
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:26,601
>> THERE SHOULD BE

95
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,303
CONSEQUENCES FOR IT.

96
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:29,271
>> Tucker: THAT'S A -- KIND

97
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:30,639
OF A BRILLIANT SOLUTION.

98
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,573
WHY DIDN'T HE DO THAT?

99
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:34,242
>> I THINK THE GOAL WAS TO

100
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,345
PLEASE EVERYBODY.

101
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,814
PLAYERS, THE LEFT WING MEDIA

102
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,616
THAT HATES FOOTBALL.

103
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:43,886
AND THEN ALSO TRYING TO

104
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:45,854
PLEASE THE SPORTS FANS AND

105
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:47,089
THE ACTUAL CONSUMERS OF

106
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:49,124
FOOTBALL WHO JUST WANT THE

107
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:50,492
PLAYERS TO RESPECT THE FLAG,

108
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:51,994
RESPECT THE ANTHEM AND PUT

109
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:53,629
ON AN ENTERTAINING GAME.

110
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:55,931
PEOPLE GO TO SPORTING EVENTS

111
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:58,400
TO BE DISTRACTED FROM OUR

112
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,069
POLITICS AND DEBATES ABOUT

113
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:01,370
RACE.

114
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,304
SPORTS AND FOOTBALL STADIUMS

115
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:03,672
HAVE BEEN WHERE PEOPLE OF

116
00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:05,541
ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT

117
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,975
BACKGROUND, ECONOMICALLY,

118
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:09,478
RACE, POLITICS, ALL COME

119
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:10,813
TOGETHER AND ROOT FOR A

120
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:11,613
COMMON TEAM.

121
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:13,615
IT HASN'T BEEN A PLACE TO GO

122
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:14,550
TO DISCUSS SPORTS.

123
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,985
I MEAN, TO DISCUSS POLITICS.

124
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:18,153
>> Tucker: THAT'S RIGHT.

125
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:19,354
AND I THINK IT'S GREAT TO

126
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,623
HAVE A RESPITE FROM ALL THIS

127
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:21,990
INSANITY.
