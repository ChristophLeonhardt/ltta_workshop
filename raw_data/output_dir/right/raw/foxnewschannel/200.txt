1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:07,020
AT NEXT REV FNC.

2
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:09,889
DON'T SEE ACTUALLY BERNIE

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:17,030
SANDERS TALKING ABOUT THIS.

4
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:17,731
I'LL SEE THE POPULACE BEHAVING

5
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:18,098
LIKE THIS.

6
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:18,798
THERE'S A GANG OF IDENTITY

7
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:23,369
POLITICS YOU JUST GIN UP ALL

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,137
THIS HATE AND IT'S SO

9
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:24,604
DESTRUCTIVE.

10
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:26,773
>> IT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

11
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:31,411
ALL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

12
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:32,112
DEMOCRATS AND ELITISTS HAVE

13
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:35,148
ALWAYS PLAYED THIS GAME.

14
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,617
IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT

15
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:53,366
WAS BEFORE.

16
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:54,100
IT'S BEEN EXPOSED FOR WHAT IT

17
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:54,367
IS.

18
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:55,235
TRUMP IS MAKING PEOPLE COME OUT

19
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:55,602
AND FIGHT.

20
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:56,269
NOW THEY'RE SAYING WERE ALL

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,003
ABOUT THE FIGHT AND TOUGH WHEN

22
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:01,074
ONE MINUTE YOU SAY GO LOW AND GO

23
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:04,377
HI, WHICH ONE IS IT.

24
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:05,111
THERE IS A LETTER LAST WEEK

25
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:05,812
SAYING THERE'S NO MESSAGE NO

26
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,480
LEADER, NO CONSISTENCY.

27
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,248
I DON'T KNOW IF BERNIE SANDERS

28
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,851
IS SPEAKING LIKE THIS IN THE

29
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:14,287
PUBLIC BUT NOW ARE HAVING THESE

30
00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:16,489
POLITICS.

31
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,825
I DID A POEM ABOUT IN 2014, I

32
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,795
BEEN BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE

33
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:22,562
KITCHEN AND SEEN WHAT THE COOKS

34
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:25,298
HAVE BEEN DOING.

35
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:26,065
>> I THOUGHT PEGGY NOONAN HAD AN

36
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:30,870
INTERESTING PIECE.

37
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,938
SHE SAID IT'S A BIT LIKE WHAT HE

38
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:34,407
WAS SAYING EARLIER.

39
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:39,345
THE REGULAR AMERICANS LOOK AT

40
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:39,746
THIS STUFF.

41
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:40,480
THE EVENTS, REACTION, LANGUAGE

42
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:43,850
AND STUFF WE HAVE SEEN.

43
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:44,584
THEY JUST THINK IT'S DEMONIC.

44
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:46,319
IT'S ALL REPELLENT.

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,391
IT IS, ISN'T IT?

46
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:52,058
>> THIS COULD BE THE GREAT

47
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:55,562
SQUANDERING OF AN OPPORTUNITY.

48
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:56,362
IF YOU SAW THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS

49
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:59,098
OF THE HOUSE YOU SAW REPUBLICANS

50
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,700
WINNING BARELY BUT DEMOCRATS

51
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:04,070
DOING DECENTLY IN RED STATES.

52
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:06,673
BY SEEMINGLY TO ACTIVELY DETEST

53
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:09,309
AMERICANS WHO ARE CONSERVATIVES

54
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,912
AND MODERATES YOU'RE ACTUALLY

55
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:14,948
TURNING THIS INTO A

56
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:15,748
RECAPITULATION OF 2016.

57
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:16,449
THERE'S 23 DISTRICTS WITH A

58
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,018
REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE WON BY

59
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,321
HILLARY CLINTON.

60
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:22,789
THEY MIGHT WIN BUT THEY WERE

61
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,424
MANY OTHER SEATS THEY MAY HAVE

62
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:27,093
BEEN ABLE TO WIND THAT THERE

63
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:29,896
LIKELY TO LOSE IN THE SENATE IS

64
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:32,365
FALLING OUT OF THEIR GRASP.

65
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:35,735
>> STEVE: THEY'VE LEARNED

66
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:36,336
NOTHING FROM 2016.

67
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:40,440
>> THEY'VE LEARNED NOTHING.

68
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,407
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE

69
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:47,013
MIDDLE OF THIS COUNTRY, LOT OF

70
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:47,881
INDEPENDENCE WHO DON'T LIKE

71
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:48,181
THIS.

72
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:48,915
THE PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T SEE

73
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,582
THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE.

74
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,317
THEY DON'T SEE US NOW AND THEY

75
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,118
WON'T SEE IT IN 2020 BECAUSE

76
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:55,388
THEY REJECT THE PEOPLE THINK

77
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:56,155
EVERYBODY THINKS THE WAY THEY DO

78
00:02:56,156 --> 00:00:00,000
