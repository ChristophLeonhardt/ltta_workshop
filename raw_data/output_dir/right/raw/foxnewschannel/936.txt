1
00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:01,747
STOMACH MUELLER.

2
00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:03,415
HE IS NOW VIEWED UNFAVORABLY UP

3
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:07,185
BY A RECORD 24% OF DEMOCRATS AND

4
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:10,555
A RECORD 33% OF INDEPENDENTS.

5
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:11,356
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WRITING

6
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:13,792
HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE IN

7
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:16,728
SUPPORT FOR THE MUELLER IS

8
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:17,062
SLIDING.

9
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:18,196
IMAGINE IF THE PRESS WAS

10
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:19,931
ACTUALLY FAIR ABOUT THIS.

11
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,534
SO HERE'S THE QUESTION.

12
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:24,970
IS THE TIME RIGHT FOR THE

13
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,704
PRESIDENT TO VOLUNTARILY SUBMIT

14
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:29,141
TO AN INTERVIEW WITH MUELLER TO

15
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,143
GET THIS THING WRAPPED UP?

16
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:32,144
WHO BETTER TO ANSWER THAT

17
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:34,546
QUESTION THEN THE PRESIDENT'S

18
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:35,547
LAWYER HIMSELF.

19
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:37,749
RUDY GIULIANI, HOW ARE YOU.

20
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,184
THE PRESIDENT LOOKS GREAT AND

21
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:44,056
SINGAPORE, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

22
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:54,366
OF COURSE, IT COMES BACK AND,

23
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,668
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?

24
00:00:56,668 --> 00:01:04,009
>> I CHECKED INTO THIS, AND WE

25
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,381
ARE VERY COMFORTABLE IF HE

26
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:13,618
COOPERATES, AND, INCLUDING THE

27
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:14,986
THINGS THAT ROSENSTEIN SAID TO

28
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:16,888
PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF, THAT HE

29
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,557
IS NOT INVOLVED IN THAT

30
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:19,357
INVESTIGATION.

31
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,760
MY CONCERN IS THAT THE MOLAR

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,994
INVESTIGATION IS GOING ON

33
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:24,796
INTERMINABLY, AND I THINK IT IS

34
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:28,533
REFLECTED IN PUBLIC OPINION.

35
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:30,335
PUBLIC OPINION IS DISCUSSED, I

36
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:32,337
BET HE'S WASTED $20 MILLION.

37
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:35,040
MAYBE HE SHOULD PUT IN AN

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,374
INTERIM REPORT AND TELL US WHAT

39
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:40,212
HE'S GOT ON COLLUSION.

40
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:42,981
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, THE

41
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,549
PRESIDENT CAN FIRE ANYBODY HE

42
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,753
WANTS FOR ANY REASON HE WANTS.

43
00:01:47,753 --> 00:01:50,522
THEY CAN'T EVEN INQUIRE ABOUT

44
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:51,957
THAT.

45
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:57,763
HE'S HARASSING MICHAEL COHEN,

46
00:01:57,763 --> 00:02:03,935
AND THE PAUL MANAFORT CASE SEEMS

47
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:06,271
TO BE FALLING APART.

48
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:08,372
YOU TAKE THAT OUT AND, SECOND,

49
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:09,306
YOU HAVE THE RUSSIANS.

50
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:16,815
THEY ARE ALL IN RUSSIA, AND IT'S

51
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:19,384
A PHONY INDICTMENT.

52
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:20,652
THEY WERE HARASSING HILARY

53
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:23,055
RALLIES DRESSED UP LIKE CLOWNS,

54
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:24,122
WE HAD WORSE THAN THAT.

55
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,391
>> HAVE YOU ASKED FOR SPECIAL

56
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:28,593
COUNSEL OFFICE WHY THEY HAVEN'T

57
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:29,561
BROUGHT CERTAIN PEOPLE IN FOR

58
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:29,961
QUESTIONING?

59
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,763
I MEAN IF THEY WERE GOING TO

60
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:33,231
FOCUS ON THIS TRUMP TOWER

61
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:35,233
MEETING, AS WE KNOW, THAT'S PART

62
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,768
OF THE FOCUSED.

63
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,970
WHY WOULDN'T THEY BRING IN THE

64
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,874
RUSSIAN ATTORNEY THAT MAKES THIS

65
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:50,549
BIG PITCH, IT'S CLOSE TO PUTIN.

66
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,352
WELL, SHE WOULD BE HAPPY TO

67
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:55,353
COME, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

68
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:58,156
THINGS WE PULLED UP VERY EARLY

69
00:02:58,156 --> 00:02:59,558
ABOUT THIS.

70
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:01,560
THE PRESIDENT CAN'T BE INDICTED,

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,595
THE SITTING PRESIDENT CAN'T BE

72
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:06,198
INDICTED, NO ONE DISPUTES THAT.

73
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:07,032
AND HE'S NOT.

74
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:11,870
SO HE GETS TO WRITE THE REPORT.

75
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,941
JUST TO GET IT OVER WITH.

76
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,577
HE'S GOTTEN 1.4 MILLION

77
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:20,011
DOCUMENTS, 32 WITNESSES, WE

78
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:24,750
RAISED NO EXECUTIVE, AND HE'S

79
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,351
GOT THE MATERIAL FROM WHICH TO

80
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,553
WRITE A REPORT RIGHT NOW.

81
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:31,556
EXCEPT THE REPORT WOULD SAY NO

82
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:32,357
EVIDENCE IN COLLUSION.

83
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:34,126
>> HE WANTS TO GET IN THE STATE

84
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:34,559
OF MIND.

85
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:37,529
IT'S THE STATE OF MIND QUESTION.

86
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:41,233
>> I THINK HE -- HE CAN'T DO

87
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:44,736
THAT UNTIL HE GETS THE PRESIDENT

88
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:48,907
ACROSS THE TABLE.

89
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:53,178
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

90
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:56,381
HIS WHOLE THEORY IS COCKAMAMIE.

91
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,651
I CAN INTERPRET, PLUS AN ARTICLE

92
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,386
TO IMMUNITY, AND I THINK HE DID

93
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:02,955
IT FOR A CORRUPT REASON.

94
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:05,424
SO I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND THAT

95
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:07,359
HE DID SOMETHING WRONG.

96
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:10,229
PLUS HIS MAIN WITNESS THERE IS

97
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,596
COMEY.

98
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:13,699
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

99
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:14,766
HOROWITZ REPORT IN DETAIL, BUT I

100
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:18,337
THINK IT WILL BE A TOUGH ONE,

101
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:18,803
IT'S 500 PAGES.

102
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:20,738
>> Laura: AND THE PRESIDENT

103
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:21,572
HAS SEEN IT?

104
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:24,376
>> TOMORROW AT THREE OR FOUR, HE

105
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:26,578
GETS AN UNEDITED VERSION OF IT,

106
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:29,815
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE

107
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:33,352
JUICY STUFF WILL BE.

108
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:38,590
BUT, AT A MINIMUM, WE KNOW WE

109
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,761
ARE CRITICIZING HIM HEAVILY FOR

110
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,362
HIS FIRST HILLARY PRESS

111
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:46,465
CONFERENCE AND HIS SECOND

112
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,767
HILLARY PRESS CONFERENCE.

113
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,403
HE STARTS THE RESPONSIBILITY,

114
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:52,571
AND HE BECAME THE

115
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:53,572
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

116
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:55,741
HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI,

117
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:59,478
AND THE CHIEF DETECTIVE DECIDED

118
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:00,579
WHETHER TO PROSECUTE THAT.

119
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,282
HE WROTE THE REPORT TWO MONTHS

120
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:05,050
BEFORE.

121
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,019
HOW ABOUT WRITING THE REPORT

122
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:07,286
NOW?

123
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:10,622
HE SAID, THAT WOULD BE AN

124
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:11,223
IMPROPER INVESTIGATION.

125
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:15,561
>> WHEN DO YOU DETERMINED THE

126
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:16,395
ISSUE OF WRITTEN ANSWERS?

127
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:17,296
>> WE ARE ADDRESSING THAT NOW

128
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:20,766
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

129
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,635
WE ARE ALL WORKING ON THAT, IS

130
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:26,038
THERE A DISPUTE AMONG YOU ABOUT

131
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:28,173
HOW TO PROCEED?

132
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:29,141
I MEAN THAT'S HEALTHY.

133
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,543
>> ALL OF US KNOW HE SHOULDN'T

134
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:33,178
TESTIFY UNLESS WE GET EVERYTHING

135
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:35,147
WE WANT AND HE WANTS.

136
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:35,881
YOU KNOW HIM, HE WANTS TO

137
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:38,384
TESTIFY.

138
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:39,952
'S COMPLAINT IS, I DID NOTHING

139
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:43,255
WRONG AND I CAN STAND UP TO ANY

140
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:43,655
QUESTIONING.

141
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,759
BUT THEY ARE REALLY GOOD

142
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,159
LAWYERS.

143
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:51,096
>> THEY ARE ALSO DISREPUTABLE

144
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:55,401
AND UNETHICAL LAWYERS.

145
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,436
WHAT ABOUT THE ONES THAT HAVE

146
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:58,971
BEEN CITED FOR UNETHICAL

147
00:05:58,971 --> 00:05:59,371
VIOLATIONS?

148
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:01,907
DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO TRUST

149
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:02,841
HIM WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE

150
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,275
UNITED STATES?

151
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,878
>> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHO

152
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:06,578
WOULD DO THE QUESTIONING?

153
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:12,584
>> I THINK IT SHOULD BE MUELLER.

154
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:15,154
WHEN I -- KEN WAS AN APPELLATE

155
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:17,256
LAWYER, I WAS A TRIAL LAWYER.

156
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:20,392
AND HE WAS A TRIAL LAWYER SO

157
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:21,360
IT'S HIS REPUTATION AT STAKE.

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,462
>> Laura: ARE YOU GUYS WORRIED

159
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:24,763
THAT THERE ARE ANY TAPE

160
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:25,964
RECORDINGS THAT MICHAEL COHEN

161
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:27,199
MIGHT HAVE IN HIS POSSESSION OF

162
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,469
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CONSENT

163
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:31,904
EITHER HE COULD HAVE EXAGGERATED

164
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:34,606
THINGS TO OTHER PEOPLE TO LIKE

165
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:36,375
CURRY FAVOR OR LOOK LIKE HE'S

166
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,643
BIGGER THAN HE IS?

167
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:39,778
I'M NOT SAYING HE DID THAT.

168
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,580
BUT YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW, YOU

169
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,681
HAVE SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS BUT

170
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:44,416
NOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT WAS

171
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,918
TURNED OVER TO THE SOUTHERN

172
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:47,986
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, THAT THEY

173
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:48,320
SEIZED.

174
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,392
SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT THEM FOR

175
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:56,161
PRIVILEGED.

176
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:57,262
JUST LIKE HE'S DONE NOTHING

177
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:59,164
WRONG IN THIS THING, HE WAS

178
00:06:59,164 --> 00:06:59,698
CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.

179
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:01,900
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOUGH, MIGHT

180
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,003
HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT ON

181
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:07,873
SITUATIONS, BUT HE WAS A MAN OF

182
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:08,374
HIS WORD.

183
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,642
MICHAEL: I THINK WOULD TELL YOU

184
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:18,050
HE HAS NOTHING INCRIMINATED

185
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,083
HE HAS NOTHING INCRIMINATED    I

186
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:18,117
HE HAS NOTHING INCRIMINATED    C

187
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:18,183
HE HAS NOTHING INCRIMINATED    I

188
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:18,217
HE HAS NOTHING INCRIMINATED    A

189
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:18,250
HE HAS NOTHING INCRIMINATED    I

190
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,283
HE HAS NOTHING INCRIMINATED    G

191
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:18,550
HE HAS NOTHING INCRIMINATED    .

192
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,720
YOU ARE A FORMER PROSECUTOR,

193
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,360
THEY THREATENED TO BANKRUPT YOU

194
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,696
AND ITS HIGH BILLS, THEY PILE UP

195
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:31,664
REAL FAST.

196
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:33,566
YOU GO TO JAIL FOR TEN YEARS.

197
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,568
>> THE REALITY IS THEY ARE

198
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:37,136
TRYING TO FRIGHTEN HIM.

199
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:39,171
MICHAEL IS A TOUGH GUY, I DON'T

200
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,173
THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN.

201
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:44,643
AND IF HE DOES, BUT DON'T THINK

202
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:49,181
HE'S GOING TO LIE.

203
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:51,150
>> INNOCENT PEOPLE DON'T WORRY

204
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,551
ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE WILL FLIP

205
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:56,155
ON THEM, AND LET'S BE HONEST,

206
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:57,156
PRESIDENTS DON'T HAVE FIXERS.

207
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:59,024
I THINK WE ARE SO IN THE THINK

208
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,626
OF THIS THAT WE TAKE A STEP BACK

209
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,629
AND WE REALIZE THAT EVERY DAY,

210
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:07,299
TALK ABOUT MR. COHEN WHO IS

211
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:09,368
DONALD TRUMP'S FIXER.

212
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:10,169
INNOCENT PEOPLE FIX THINGS BY

213
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,403
SHOOTING STRAIGHT AND TELLING

214
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,372
THE TRUTH, SO I THINK THIS IS

215
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:19,011
THE BEGINNING OF A DARK, DARK

216
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:20,779
STONE.

217
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:21,080
STORM.

218
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,982
>> FIXER MEAN SOMEONE WHO CAN

219
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,417
GET THINGS DONE, PEOPLE HIRE

220
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,686
THEM IN NEW YORK, THEY ARE

221
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:28,521
CALLED EXPEDITERS.

222
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,989
>> Laura: THEY DON'T KNOW

223
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:30,656
NEW YORK LINGO.

224
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:33,092
>> WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT WAS, I

225
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:35,427
EXPEDITED THINGS, I GOT THEM

226
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:35,794
DONE.

227
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:36,595
NOT ILLEGALLY.

228
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:38,397
NO ONE HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING

229
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:40,198
ABOUT THAT UNTIL NOW.

230
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:43,034
THIS IDEA THAT A PRESIDENT WHO

231
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,905
NOTHING WRONG ISN'T GOING TO BE

232
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,239
FRAMED BY SOMEBODY.

233
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:50,209
WHEN THEY DONATED 36 GRANTED TO

234
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:54,814
HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN OR, AT HER

235
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:56,015
VICTORY/TO DEFEAT PARTY, THEY

236
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,817
CRIED THE NIGHT SHE LOST.

237
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,619
THESE GUYS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

238
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:04,089
CITED FOR NOT TURNING OVER IN IT

239
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:05,958
EVIDENCE ABOUT INNOCENT PEOPLE

240
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,326
AND AT THIS IDIOT CONGRESSMAN

241
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:08,761
WANTS ME TO TRUST HIM?

242
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,563
I'VE BEEN A LAWYER FOR A LONG

243
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,431
TIME, THAT KATE DOESN'T KNOW

244
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:13,399
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

245
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,934
>> Laura: ARE YOU ALSO GOING

246
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,535
TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE

247
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,938
UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIONALITY OF

248
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:20,739
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IN THIS

249
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:21,073
PROCESS?

250
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:24,243
>> BOTH ON HIS FACE AND AS

251
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:24,844
APPLIED TO.

252
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:27,613
BECAUSE ON ITS FACE, THE STATUTE

253
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:28,614
ITSELF, AND SECOND, THE FACT

254
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,616
THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY WHAT

255
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:33,385
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TOTALLY

256
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,753
ILLEGAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

257
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:36,155
INVESTIGATION THAT THEY TRIED TO

258
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,556
MAKE INTO A CRIMINAL

259
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:39,825
INVESTIGATION.

260
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:40,659
AND CLEARLY BY THE COMEY MEMO,

261
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:45,764
WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HOROWITZ

262
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:46,732
SAYS TOMORROW.

263
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:49,368
>> Laura: KELLYANNE CONWAY'S

264
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:50,769
HUSBAND, GEORGE, I'VE KNOWN HIM

265
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:51,971
FOR MANY YEARS.

266
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:53,772
HE'S BRILLIANT, WE THOUGHT HE

267
00:09:53,772 --> 00:09:55,074
MIGHT BE SG AT THE JUSTICE

268
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,576
DEPARTMENT, HE WOULD HAVE MADE A

269
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:57,943
GREAT ONE.

270
00:09:57,943 --> 00:09:59,612
HE HAS WRITTEN AN ARTICLE FOR

271
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:02,381
THE HILL THAT HE BASICALLY SAYS,

272
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:03,816
THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT THE

273
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:05,351
UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE

274
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:08,420
STATUTE, HE JUST SMASHES

275
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,588
CALABRESE'S ARGUMENT.

276
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:11,390
HE BUYS INTO THE APPOINTMENTS

277
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,092
CLAUSE OUT ARGUMENT HERE, AND HE

278
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:14,760
JUST DESTROYS THAT.

279
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,263
IS THERE ANY CONCERN ABOUT THAT

280
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:17,963
AT THE WHITE HOUSE?

281
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:21,767
>> NO CONCERN ABOUT IT.

282
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,903
FEELING YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE

283
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,371
ON EVERYTHING.

284
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:25,704
[LAUGHS]

285
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:27,540
>> METHODS CLEAR OF AN ARGUMENT

286
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,175
AS LET'S SAY THEIR ABILITY TO

287
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,977
INDICT, OR EVEN THEIR ABILITY TO

288
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:34,613
SUBPOENA, AS IT IS TRUE IN

289
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:35,014
ARTICLE TWO.

290
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,248
>> Laura: HAVE YOU WRITTEN A

291
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:40,352
BRIEF ON THAT?

292
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:41,153
>> MORE OR LESS.

293
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:44,924
HOWEVER, I WOULD THINK, MAYBE HE

294
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:45,658
WANTS HIM OUT OF SUPREME COURT

295
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:48,828
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WILL GET

296
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:49,361
THE APPOINTMENT.

297
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:51,964
>> Laura: I WAS LIKE, GEORGE

298
00:10:51,964 --> 00:10:54,200
IS LIKE -- >> GEORGE IS NOT

299
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,402
GETTING ON THE SUPREME COURT, I

300
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:58,604
CAN PICK PREDICT THAT.

301
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:00,606
>> Laura: IS THEIR CONCERN

302
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:03,576
ABOUT -- LET'S GO BACK TO COHEN

303
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:04,810
FOR A MINUTE.

304
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,080
I'M NOT AS BIG OF A FAN OF

305
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,248
PROSECUTORS, BUT I'M NOT AS BIG

306
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,550
OF A FAN OF PROSECUTORS AS SOME

307
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,284
CONSERVATIVES ARE BECAUSE WITH

308
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,987
UNBRIDLED POWER AND UNCHECKED

309
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:17,690
POWER COMES ABUSE OF DISCRETION.

310
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,861
FROM PATRICK FITZGERALD, --

311
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,397
THERE ARE LIKE FOUR PEOPLE.

312
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:32,772
>> REPRESENTATIVE COMEY.

313
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,573
>> Laura: YES, SCOOTER LIBBY,

314
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:35,708
ALL THE REST OF IT.

315
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,979
SO WHEN SOMEONE LIKE HIM HAS THE

316
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,380
SCREWS TURNED ON HIM, YOU WILL

317
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,648
LOSE YOUR FAMILY, BE IN JAIL FOR

318
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:46,252
TEN YEARS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

319
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:46,585
GIVE US?

320
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:48,487
YOU ARE GOING TO TELL US.

321
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,623
PEOPLE FREAK OUT AND THAT'S WITH

322
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,391
THE POWER OF PROSECUTORS DO.

323
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:53,993
>> I EMPATHIZE GREATLY WITH

324
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,328
MICHAEL, I DON'T BELIEVE HE WILL

325
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,796
TELL A FALSEHOOD, I BELIEVE HE'S

326
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:58,798
GOING TO TELL THE TRUTH AND WE

327
00:11:58,798 --> 00:11:59,999
ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

328
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,867
>> Laura: BUT WHAT IF HE IS IN

329
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:05,538
TROUBLE ON ANOTHER MATTER?

330
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:07,640
>> HE WILL DEAL WITH IT.

331
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,377
AND I THINK -- I STILL TRUST IN

332
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,947
HIM UNTIL THEY SHOW ME

333
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:15,582
SOMETHING, TO THE CONTRARY.

334
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:17,517
>> Laura: REPORTS ARE THAT HE

335
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:21,487
IS UPSET BECAUSE -- HE'S FEELING

336
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:22,455
ALL ALONE OUT THERE.

337
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,858
>> I BET IT FEELS THAT WAY, TOO.

338
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,261
BUT WE ADVISE THE PRESIDENT THAT

339
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:29,429
THAT WOULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD.

340
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:32,065
>> Laura: NOW, YOU CAN'T PICK

341
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:32,599
UP THE PHONE.

342
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,400
>> YOU TELL YOUR CLIENT OVER

343
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,606
TIME, DON'T TALK TO THIS PERSON.

344
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:40,273
PAUL MANAFORT WAS PROBABLY

345
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:41,374
TOTALLY INNOCENT BUT THEY TURNED

346
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:42,408
IT INTO ANOTHER CHARGE, BECAUSE

347
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:45,545
THE FIRST CHARGES GOING UNDER.

348
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,380
>> Laura: WHEN IS YOUR BEST

349
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,382
GUESS THAT THIS THING WILL BE

350
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,984
DECIDED WITHOUT THE TESTIMONY?

351
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:51,784
BECAUSE AT THAT.

352
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:53,786
THEY'VE INTERVIEWED PRETTY MUCH

353
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:54,354
EVERYONE THEY WANTED.

354
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:57,790
>> I BELIEVE WE WILL DECIDE

355
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,958
UNLESS SOMETHING GOES WRONG.

356
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,994
WITHOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS GO

357
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:02,929
WRONG, THE COHEN SITUATION, THE

358
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,597
SPYGATE TO THE SITUATION.

359
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:07,600
IF NOTHING ELSE BREAKS LIKE

360
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,801
THAT, POSSIBLY THIS HOROWITZ

361
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,436
THING.

362
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:10,903
IT'S 500 PAGES.

363
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:11,738
BUT WE SHOULD GIVE THE DECISION

364
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,072
DONE IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO,

365
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:16,209
WHICH MEANS THEN WE GO TO

366
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,510
BATTLING OVER A SUBPOENA OR

367
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,114
GETTING IT READY FOR A SMALL,

368
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:23,182
TAILORED, LIMITED INTERVIEW.

369
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:27,253
>> Laura: 150 SUBPOENAS, BLANK

370
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:27,620
SUBPOENAS.

371
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,591
THIS CAME OUT LATE TODAY.

372
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:32,792
MUELLER HAS REQUESTED THAT.

373
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:33,626
WHAT COULD THAT BE ABOUT?

374
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:36,763
IS THAT LIKE A MIND GAME?

375
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:39,399
>> FRANKLY, IF IT IS A MIND GAME

376
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,200
IT WORKS THE OPPOSITE WAY.

377
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,604
AT THIS LATE STAGE, IF YOU STOP

378
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:45,672
ISSUING 150 SUBPOENAS, HE'S GOT

379
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:46,005
NOTHING.

380
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,408
>> Laura: WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN

381
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:49,475
DOING FOR THE LAST YEAR?

382
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:51,611
>> WHERE IS THE COLLISION, WHERE

383
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,012
IS THE OBSTRUCTION, EXCEPT IN

384
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:53,513
THEIR HEAD.

385
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:56,549
IF THEY HAVE TO DO 150 SUBPOENAS

386
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:57,650
AT THIS POINT, AND EVERYBODY

387
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,920
KNOWS THIS, THEY HAVE NO CASE

388
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,088
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T DO

389
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:02,555
ANYTHING WRONG.

390
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:05,525
>> Laura: WHEN YOU TALKED TO

391
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:06,292
COHEN A YEAR AGO, I DON'T KNOW

392
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,627
IF YOU'VE HEARD WHEN HE WAS

393
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:11,631
GOING TO TRY TO GET THAT

394
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,865
TRUMP TOWER IN MOSCOW DONE.

395
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,201
HE WANTED TO GET THAT DONE AND

396
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,070
HAD REPORTEDLY WRITTEN A NOTE TO

397
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,871
POLLUTANT SAME, THIS IS A LOGJAM

398
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:21,074
HERE, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, IT

399
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:22,275
DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE.

400
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:23,710
BUT THAT IS ALWAYS LISTED IN THE

401
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,014
ONE OR TWO OR THREE RUSSIAN

402
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,782
INTEREST CONTACTS THAT COHEN

403
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:30,383
MADE.

404
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:32,919
ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS, HAVE YOU

405
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,553
BEEN DISCUSSING IT?

406
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:34,854
>> WE ARE AWARE AND WE THINK IT

407
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:37,256
HAS NO CONNECTION.

408
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,859
>> Laura: WAS A GREEN LIGHTED

409
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:40,393
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP?

410
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:42,628
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT, THAT

411
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,764
WOULD BE COMPETENCE, BUT THE

412
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:47,200
REALITY IS, NOTHING CAME OF IT.

413
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,402
THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO FOR

414
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:49,669
IT.

415
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,371
IN ESSENCE, IF THE PRESIDENT HAD

416
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:53,773
COLLUDED, WHICH HE DIDN'T -- THE

417
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:55,675
PRESIDENT WILL TELL YOU IN THE

418
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:56,743
TWO YEARS AFTER THE ELECTION, I

419
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,745
JUST DIDN'T TALK TO ANY

420
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:00,847
RUSSIANS, I DON'T KNOW ANY

421
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,815
RUSSIANS.

422
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:06,252
>> Laura: HE DIDN'T DRINK, SO

423
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:07,553
YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T ORDER A WHITE

424
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:09,389
RUSSIAN.

425
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:12,592
>> HE DOESN'T DRINK AT ALL.

426
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:13,559
THEY WERE BITTER OVER LOSING THE

427
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,194
ELECTION AND SOME RIGHT IN

428
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:16,496
MULLER'S OFFICE WERE THE ONES

429
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:17,664
CRYING LIKE BABIES THE NIGHT

430
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:18,798
THAT HILLARY LOST.

431
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:21,401
IF THEY ARE TRYING TO

432
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:22,402
DELEGITIMATIZE HIM.

433
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:24,070
WE WANT THE PRESIDENT SAID HE

434
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,204
REGRETS NOT HAVING A BETTER

435
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:25,972
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA BECAUSE

436
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,608
OF ALL OF THIS.

437
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:30,476
>> THAT'S A NATIONAL SECURITY

438
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,245
COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF THIS

439
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,579
INVESTIGATION.

440
00:15:33,579 --> 00:00:00,000
THANK GOD HE WAS ABLE TO DO
