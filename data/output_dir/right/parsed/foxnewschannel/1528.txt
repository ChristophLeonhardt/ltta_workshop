PRESIDENT'S DESK WHERE HE'S
EXPECTED TO SIGN IT INTO LAW.
MEANWHILE -- AINSLEY: DEMOCRATS
TAKING A CUE FROM THE
PRESIDENT'S PLAY BOOK IN
DRAMATIC SHIFT TO THEIR OWN
MESSAGE.
>> THE SWAMP HAS NEVER BEEN MORE
FOUL OR MORE FETED THAN UNDER
THIS PRESIDENT.
>> INSTEAD OF DELIVERING ON HIS
PROMISE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP,
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BECOME THE
SWAMP.
BRIAN: BUT WILL THIS WORK?
TOMMY LARREN, THEY DID THE
STATS, ARE THE DEMOCRATS DOING
THE RIGHT THING BY JUST TAKING
HIS LINE?
>> WELL, NO, BECAUSE THEY DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING BEHIND
THAT LINE BECAUSE DRAIN THE
SWAMP IS NOT ABOUT WHAT THEY
BELIEVE, IT'S ABOUT IMPEACHING
THIS PRESIDENT OR ATTACKING THIS
PRESIDENT, DISPARAGING THIS
PRESIDENT AND SUPPORTERS, THAT'S
NOT WHAT DRAIN THE SWAMP MEANS.
CUTTING TAXES FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, PUTTING AMERICANS FIRST,
IT MEANS PROTECTING AND SECURING
THE BORDER AND THEY'RE NOT ABOUT
ANY OF THOSE THINGS WHICH IS WHY
I BELIEVE THEY WILL BE HURTING
IN MIDTERMS AND HURTING IN 2020
YET AGAIN.
STEVE: TOMMY, WHEN YOU LOOK,
EVERY TIME THE PRESIDENT TRIES
TO DO SOMETHING, SWAMP-DRAINISH
HE BANGS HIS HEAD ON WASHINGTON,
D.C.
IT'S BEEN HARD FOR HIM TO GET
ANYTHING DONE.
>> PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT THE SWAMP EXISTS IN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND FRUSTRATING
FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT THIS
PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE'S DOING TO
REACH OBSTRUCTION IN OUR OWN
PARTY.
DRAIN THE SWAMP ISN'T ABOUT
DRAINING THE DEMOCRATS, DRAINING
THOSE IN OUR OWN PARTY WHO HAVE
FORGOTTEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
REALLY WHAT DRAIN THE SWAMP
MEANS IS TO BRING BACK TO DC THE
REAL VOICE AND THE INTENTIONS TO
HAVE SILENT MAJORITY AND NANCY
PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER, THEY
DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT,
THEIR ENTIRE AGENDA IS TO RAISE
TAX, SHIELD ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS,
CHIP AWAY AT SECOND AMENDMENT
RIGHTS AND IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT
OR DISPARAGE THE PRESIDENT.
THAT WON'T BE WINNING FOR
AMERICAN PEOPLE LIKE PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS DOING INTERNATIONALLY
AND DOMESTICALLY.
AINSLEY: IT'S IRONIC THAT IT'S
NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER,
THEY ARE THE SWAMP THAT THE
PRESIDENT RAN ON DRAINING.
LOOKS LIKE, IT OF COURSE WORKED
FOR THIS PRESIDENT, HE GOT
ELECTED ON THAT MESSAGE AND
LOOKS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS ARE
STEALING IT AND MAYBE THEY ARE
TRYING TO WIN AND THEY ARE
GETTING DESPERATE BECAUSE IF YOU
LOOK AT RECENT POLL, REUTERS
POLL, REPUBLICANS HOLD SLIM LEAD
IN GENERIC BALLOT.
THEY ASKED PEOPLE WHO THEY WERE
POLLING, WHO WOULD YOU VOTE FOR
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT, LOOK AT
THAT, 38% SAID THEY WOULD VOTE
FOR REPUBLICAN AND 36.7 WOULD
VOTE FOR DEMOCRAT.
>> WELL, OF COURSE, BECAUSE AT
THE END OF THE DAY I BELIEVE
THAT AMERICAN VOTERS ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE GOING TO
VOTE WITH POCKETBOOKS AND THE
TRUTH IS THIS PRESIDENT IS
WINNING FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE.
YOU LOOK AT THE TAX CUTS, YOU
LOOK AT WHAT THAT HAS DONE FOR
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN.
I KNOW NANCY PELOSI THINKS IT'S
JUST CRUMBS, TO AVERAGE
AMERICANS IT REALLY MEANS
SOMETHING.
LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENT THAT'S
DOING GREAT THINGS
INTERNATIONALLY BUT ALSO MOST
IMPORTANTLY DOMESTICALLY, I ALSO
THINK THAT IMMIGRATION IS GOING
TO BE A HUGE PART OF THIS
BECAUSE AS WE ARE SEEING, AS WE
TALK ABOUT EVERY WEEK, EVEN IN
PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA, THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH
THE DEMOCRATS AND THEY ARE FED
UP WITH THEIR AGENDA OR THERE
LACK THEREOF AND READY FOR WHAT
THE PRESIDENT IS BRINGING TO THE
TABLE.
STEVE: TOMMY, WHEN YOU ARE ON
YOUR PROGRAM AND ON THIS
PROGRAM, YOU SPEAK YOUR MIND BUT
SOMETIMES YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC
AND WEIRD THINGS HAPPEN.
I KNOW OVER THE WEEKEND YOU WERE
IN MINNEAPOLIS, I THINK YOU WERE
WITH YOUR MOM, WHAT WENT
HAYWIRE?
>> WELL, I WAS ACTUALLY WITH
BOTH MY PARENTS AND WE WERE
ENJOYING BRUNCH AFTER I DID A
SHOW THE NIGHT BEFORE AND
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS A GROUP
OF PEOPLE PROBABLY AROUND MY AGE
THAT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY
TO THROW WATER AT ME AND THEN
START CHANTING PROFANITY AND,
AGAIN, NOT SOMETHING THAT NOT
USED TO BUT REALLY
DISHEARTENING.
BRIAN: IN FRONT OF YOUR PARENTS?
AINSLEY: WAS THAT YOUR MOM IN
ONE OF THE VIDEOS THAT WAS
WALKING BEHIND YOU WHEN THE GIRL
THREW THE DRINK ON YOUR BACK?
>> THROWN AT ME AND GOT MY MOM
WET AS WELL.
THIS SOMETHING THAT WAS
EMBARRASSING, AT THE END OF THE
DAY I'M A PERSON TOO, BUT I'M
TOUGH, MY FAMILY IS TOUGH, WE
CAN HANDLE IT.
I THINK THAT THOSE THAT THREW
THE WATER AND WERE APPLAUDING
AND LAUGHING ABOUT IT WE WANTED
TO GET THEIR 15 MINUTES OF FAME
BY MAKING VIDEO OF ME.
LOOKING BACK, THOSE ARE THE
PEOPLE THAT WILL BE EMBA RASED
BY THE ACTION.
THEIR PARENTS RAISED THEM
BETTER, FURTHERMORE, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LIKE ME BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE THE RIGHT TO THROW THINGS
AT ME?
IS THAT THE POINT THAT YOU CAN'T
DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY CIVILLY,
IT'S REALLY DISHEARTENING, I'M
TOUGH, I CAN HANDLE IT.
THERE ARE THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT
HAVE A THICK OF SKIN AND THAT'S
THE PEOPLE THAT I WORRY ABOUT.
STEVE: HERE IS THE THING, TOMI,
TWITTER, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
AT POLAR OPPOSITES TO YOU
POLITICALLY ARE SUPPORTING YOUR
RIGHT TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO
SAY.
AINSLEY: KATHY GRIFFIN IS ONE OF
THEM.
STEVE: ABSOLUTELY.
>> HEY, THAT'S THE SILVER LINING
IN THE WHOLE THING, THERE ARE
PEOPLE THAT NORMALLY DETEST ME
AND THEY'RE COMING TO MY DEFENSE
AT LEAST ON THIS INCIDENTS, SO
MAYBE MOVING FORWARD WHO THOUGHT
IT WAS FUN TO THROW PARTY, MAYBE
THAT THEY'LL SEE THAT THAT'S NOT
THE COOL THING TO DO.
IF KATHY GRIFFIN IS STILLING UP
FOR YOU OR DEFENDING YOU, HEY, I
WILL TAKE IT.
AINSLEY: WE CAN ALL DISAGREE BUT
