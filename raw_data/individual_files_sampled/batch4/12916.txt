if Democrats could have constructed a candidate in a laboratory designed to do two things this fall those things would have been one lose dramatically to Hillary Clinton and to destroy the conservative brand at the same time which begs the question was Donald Trump actually constructed in a laboratory by debbie Wasserman Schultz and Barack Obama polls show Donald Trump will lose by double digits to Hillary Clinton at this point in the 2012 presidential race the last ten poles in the RealClearPolitics polling average showed Mitt Romney trailing Barack Obama by 2.2 percentage points on average Romney ended up losing by three point nine percentage points at the same point in 2008 Senator John McCain trailed Obama by an average of two point four percentage points in the prior 10 polls McCain ended up losing by seven point three percent today Donald Trump trails Hillary Clinton by an average of six point nine percentage points such results are mirrored in state polling Trump is way more unpopular than McCain or Romney ever were unlike McCain and Romney he has far less room for movement given his 100% name recognition and the left has already spent most of its media attention treating Donald Trump with kid gloves for ratings purposes they haven't even opened up their guns yet get ready there's a tsunami coming but here's the thing it's not merely enough for Trump to lose he also has to lose after consolidating the support of all the mainstream Republicans so the Democrats can then claim that republicanism is really just a reflection of trumpism a brand of big government politics with a real nativist streak a white power politics agenda an isolationist international approach fortunately for Democrats Republican leaders are morons and are therefore falling right into this trap in the name of stopping Hillary Clinton leaders ranging from Texas governor Greg Abbott to South Carolina Governor nikki Haley they're already lining up to embrace the guy who burned conservatism down inside the Republican Party and the left could not be happier gang for decades they've been falsely accusing Republicans of being just what Trump is now they can claim they were right all along they can paint conservatism with the broad brush of Trump here's Jonathan Chait at New York Magazine today quote virtually the entire Republican apparatus will follow from sooner or later because without the voters they have no power and those voters have revealed things about the nature of the party many Republicans prefer to deny on the around Republican politics boils down to ethno-nationalism governed by reason the paranoid mendacity of Joe McCarthy the racial pandering of Barry Goldwater Richard Nixon and George Bush the jingoism an anti intellectualism of Ronald Reagan George W Bush and Sarah Palin all these forces have embodied the essence of American conservative politics as it is actually practiced rather than as conservative intellectuals like to imagine it Trump has finally turned that which was always there against itself Andrew Sullivan talking about it this is a Brewer Jonathan Jonathan Chait there's a brutal libel on conservative politics of course it's a liable on Goldwater and Bush and Reagan but it is true of Trump and so now that truth will be read back into history to justify all the left's favorite lies about the right here's Democratic National chairwoman debbie Wasserman Schultz she says quote the decades-old Republican strategy of exploiting unfounded fear of immigrants minorities the poor LGBT and more all for political gain have laid the groundwork for Donald Trump here's the New York Times editorial board yesterday quote it is the Republicans who are making a clear choice in 2016 one that seems unimaginable a year ago to stamp what they had still liked to call the party of Lincoln with the brand of Donald Trump that brand of fool's gold it's going to Mar the Republican Party for the next generation thanks to both the minority of voters who handed Trump the nomination and the establishment that refused to consolidate to stop him and who now support him in the name of raising cash and stopping Hillary Clinton Donald Trump he's a Democrat stream come true he is conservatism 'he's nightmare and we're all living in that nightmare now i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show tends to demonize people don't care about your feelings so the most unsurprising news of the week happened yesterday when John Kasich his mission in life fulfilled having split the vote with Ted Cruz to prevent either one of them from winning the nomination John Kasich finally dropped out demonstrating that there I guess was at least an ounce of sanity to him I thought maybe he was just gonna come out yesterday and declare himself president I mean that's it's been that kind of race he's won one state his home state and he kept declaring that he was just this close to being the nominee despite staying in the race a month longer than Marco Rubio and having lost delegates here was John Kasich in full-on delusion mode talking about how he was dropping out and apparently doing it from some sort of hardware store you see I have always said that the Lord has a purpose for me as he has for everyone and as I suspend my campaign today I have renewed faith deeper faith that the Lord will show me the way forward and fulfill the purpose of my life thank you and God bless there's always all about him right I mean it's all about God had a purpose for me and I don't know what God's purpose for me anymore apparently God's purpose was for you to be a giant douche and stay in the race a month too long to split the votes that Donald Trump could be our nominee good job God well play God if that was your plan God he must hate us it's all coming to fruition okay so meanwhile the the Trump consolidation has begun we talked a little bit earlier about Greg Abbott and nikki Haley and all the rest of these folks jumping into the fray on behalf of Donald Trump they're sort of jumping into the phrase a little much Mitch McConnell all these people they've issued kind of tepid statements of endorsement it's kind of like you okay I guess kind of like when my wife asks me to kill a bug and it's like Oh God fine okay that's sort of what it's that feeling that's creeping up and to see all these people's faces by the way you should subscribe because it is amusing to watch all these people kowtow to legitimately one of the worst people in the United States if you subscribe then you get to see my face the face of skepticism the face of joy right in and so you'll get to see all those all those variations of my face which I know everyone loves so go to tailee where for that more importantly you also get to take part in the mailbag yeah we now have an actual mailbag submission system over at Daly wired.com so you'll get to take a look at that so you'll want to stop on by daily wire comm and subscribe but the never Trump movement is is now getting it from all sides people like me oh you have to vote for Trump or you're a bad person you're making Hillary the president in a minute I'm gonna go through the five most common arguments and I'm going to go through them realistically and talk about why I think they're wrong first here's Newt Gingrich who's irrelevant Washington DC corrupt politician talking as though he has credibility about the never Trump movement harming the country after backing Donald Trump for the presidency well first I'd urge him to drop never Trump and put in never Hillary the risk they're running of Hillary Clinton appointing a truly radical Supreme Court eliminating the Second Amendment the right to bear arms eliminating religious liberty imposing further radical values on the country I think that's that by itself just the issue of the Supreme Court should convince most rational people that never Hillary is a lot more powerful slogan than never Trump so I am both never Trump and never Hillary I will not vote for either one of them so being never Trump doesn't mean that I'm Pro Hillary it means that I'm never Hillary and never Trump and I'm indifferent as to to who wins this election on that level because I'm not involving myself in this in this moral turd fight that's this and that's not something I'm interested in to him but to directly address this particular argument this one's the one they like to bring up Justice Scalia died so I guess the suggestion is Justice Scalia hadn't died then would be okay right if Justice Scalia were still alive in 79 years old then we would just be sitting around going oh well we have some sort of different excuse but let's go directly at this okay so the logic says that Trump is going to suggest a more conservative Supreme Court justice than Hillary Clinton there is zero evidence to support this zero Republicans number one are probably gonna lose the Senate to Democrats do you really think that Donald Trump is going to nominate a hardcore conservative to pass through a Democratic Senate does anyone really believe that for even an instant of he won't do that of course he won't do that beyond that does anybody think the Trump in any case has the stomach to fight for a constitutional conservative when he hasn't read the Constitution or know anything about it Ronald Reagan had three Supreme Court PACs hey two of the three were terrible George W Bush had two only one was okay Ronald Reagan again two out of three George HW went one for two Ford went zero for one Nixon went one for four okay so the idea that that Donald Trump is gonna do better than all these other folks he's gonna select exactly the right justice does anybody really believe this Trump has never back to constitutional balance of power or separation of powers he doesn't believe in restrictions on the executive branch he doesn't believe in the Second Amendment strongly enough to fight for it he doesn't believe in somebody who's gonna overturn roe v wade he's basically said that openly the idea he's gonna that you your real reason for voting Trump is because he'll put in a great justice again no evidence whatsoever to support that if you actually want to support the Constitution elect good governors who are going to resist federal encroachment that's the actual way to support the Constitution not to rely on Donald Trump to pick a lawyer that's that's ridiculous beyond that Donald Trump is just untrustworthy through and through if you're trusting him to do anything you're making a grave mistake so just in the last 24 hours Trump has lied to you this many times this is a big for for those who can't see he's flipped on four separate positions that him that he took during the primaries this is Trump pivoting to to shore up his base by the way we're not even in general election mode yet right this is just him shoring up his base so here is Donald Trump on the minimum wage for example so Bernie Sanders says he wants $15 an hour minimum wage and he has really gone after you lately for saying you're happy with $7.25 the current federal minimum wage he can't live on $7 25,000 and I'm actually looking at that because I'm very different from most Republicans I mean you have to have something that you can live on but what I'm really looking to do is get people great jobs so they make much more money than that so they make much money than more money than the $15 now if you start playing around too much with the lower level the lower level number you're not going to become basically saying I'll consider raising the minimum wage I'm old enough to remember like five minutes ago when he was saying that the the wages in the United States were too high and they were uncompetitive and that's why raising the minimum wage would be a bad idea so now he's flipped on raising the minimum wage or at least he's different than most Republicans I love that he can say this now we can all say this now now it's okay when he said he was in New York values Republican that was the end of the world no how dare you now he comes out and he says I'm a different type of Republican we liked it it's pronounced in my world we spell Republican diem Oh see our ATM that kind of Republican I'm the kind of Republican who's not a Republican you might call me a Republican in name only actually when he says this it's totally fine okay that was line number one line number to remember all through the campaign I'm self-funding anyone who is funded by someone else is being bribed Ted Cruz he's taking money from all these various super PACs and that means that he is being bribed here is Donald Trump is he going to sell fund of course not that would be money out of his pocket let's be real here he is setting an audacious fundraising goal I'm making decisions right now but probably will work with the Republican National Committee raise a lot of money and go out and beat Hillary we're gonna try and raise over a billion dollars which is what's gonna be necessary okay line number three Donald Trump you remember he said about Ted Cruz for example that that Ted Cruz was bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs so it's Hillary Clinton Goldman Sachs this and Goldman Sachs that so he now has a new fundraiser that of his fundraising campaign the guy's name is Steve minuchin now you may recognize that name that's because he is the former Goldman Sachs partner Steve minuchin who's heading up his fundraising campaign also happened to work at a little place we like to call Soros Fund Management yes that's Soros George Soros this guy's a lifelong Democrat who worked with George Soros and at Goldman Sachs he's leading up Donald Trump's fundraising campaign yes all you people who voted for Donald Trump on the notion that he was going to shake up Washington you're all a bunch of suckers you're suckers and he's proving you suckers in the first five minutes after you confirmed his nomination finally Donald Trump bashed his own tax plans for the youths on CNBC and he was asked about his tax plan which originally was slated to lower the taxes for people on in the top bracket said quote I am not necessarily a huge fan of that I am much into middle-class who have been absolutely forgotten in our country what did he say about his tax plan exactly what he said about his aromaticity plan he said it's a starting negotiation position right he says don't worry is what I say but I don't really mean it quote you know when you put out a tax plan you're going to start negotiating you don't say okay this is our tax plan lot's of luck folks there'll be a negotiation back and forth and you can see that going up to be honest with you right okay so that that's legitimately he says his tax plan was just a starting ago she ation yeah I trust that guy to pick Supreme Court justices so much that I'm willing to sacrifice the Republican brand the conservative brand to his death no nationalistic idea sees just because I think he'll be that trustworthy I think he's just gonna be that trustworthy and in case you thought he was gonna be some sort of financial whiz kid by the way here's Donald Trump on debt hey Donald Trump on debt here we go so I've I've seen what can happen and it's not a bitch not a good picture but what do we do with all of the money that we owe everybody when rates go up and now all of a sudden we have to borrow at two points more one point more even is devastating but two three four five points more it's it's a real dilemma and we have to be very very careful and I am the king of debt I do love debt I love that I love playing with it but of course now you're talking about you know you're talking about something that's very very fragile I do love debt I do love playing with it remember that time when he said that he was totally solvent and people like me said he built his empire on the back of massive loans that he still hasn't paid back yeah yeah a lot of suckers out there getting a lot of suckers okay so I already talked about the one argument for voting Trump over Hillary the Supreme Court argument as someone who actually studied the Constitution as someone who believes in the Constitution which Donald Trump has never read as someone who got an a-plus in Harvard at Harvard Law in constitutional law hey I can tell you Donald Trump doesn't know doesn't care about and doesn't believe in the Constitution there's a guy who literally said literally said his litmus test for Supreme Court justices would be appointing someone to prosecute Hillary Clinton note to Donald Trump Supreme Court justices are not federal prosecutors you don't condone Trump is also the guy who talks about how various judges had signed bills he does not know what government does he doesn't even know what it does why would I think that he's going to appoint a great Supreme Court justice or that he's just gonna sign off on whatever his advisors say when is he ever signed off on something his advisors just telling him this notion that Trump is gonna be swung by his advisors behind good ideas who believes this when has he ever done this poem Anna Ford said start acting more presidential so he fired him and brought back in Corey Lewandowski who said let mr. Trump be mr. Trump by the way yeah I'm an adult so as an adult the last time I called another adult mister something was when there were somebody who I'd known as a child and I called mr. something I would never call my employers mister something okay it's ridiculous it's ridiculous but everybody who surrounds Donald Trump calls him mr. Trump so of course to do all the media members who work for him but we'll get to them in a little bit so here's a couple more arguments that have been posited for why she vote Trump above Hillary why I don't think they watch one is the Hillary's worse argument this is probably the most common aside from the Supreme Court Hillary is worse okay two things yes Hillary is corrupt and evil Trump is also corrupt and he is also in a believer in personal self aggrandizement and ad-hoc authoritarianism so what he believes is evil - it's just a different kind of evil Hillary's an ideologue who's evil Donald Trump is a narcissist who's evil and so they're brands of evil neither of them are good for the country people who are saying well you know this is just like I hear this all the time this is like when we supported Stalin to stop Hitler during the World War two no it's actually more like supporting Hitler to stop Stalin first of all considering that a nationalist populace is more Hitlerian and a communist is more Stalin esque so it's more like if you sided with Hitler to stop Stalin but number two this is more like having that debate not in 1941 when it was clear what Hitler was doing it's more like having the debate in 1936 when it's not clear what either one is going to do we know they're both going to be bad it's just a question of how bad so you know there is a risk there and people who fail to acknowledge the risk are just lying to you there is it because what we know about Trump is that he's not conservatives we just showed over and over and over Hillary's actually more conservative than he is on free trade she's more conservative than he is on European alliances Hillary may / may present a vulnerable email server to Vladimir Putin and Hanuma reset button Donald Trump was asked yesterday have you been talking to Putin he said I don't want to answer that question I don't want to answer that question yeah that guy's gonna be getting classified briefings I can't imagine this going poorly at any point in the future beyond that my standard for Republicans and Democrats is not the same gang I don't want a Democrat taking over the Republican Party I would prefer to keep the Republican Party conservative I heard Dennis Prager say today on his show and of course I love Dennis but Dennis said today well if you sit out the selection as a conservative to prove something to the Republican Party all you're gonna prove is that you're irrelevant this seems nonsensical to me it seems nonsensical to me I will give you an example of how nonsensical it is Trump's voters sat out 2012 now they own the party okay the fact that if you sit out and the candidate loses then they're gonna have to find some way to bring you back when you become irrelevant is when they know that your vote is in their pocket already that's when you become irrelevant yeah the second argument is that Trump is gonna change Trump is not going to change this idea that Trump is gonna change ignores the fact that he's 8,000 years old and he has never changed in his life except changed his wives then there's the Trump who work with Republicans argument that if he had a Republican Congress he'd work with them Hillary wouldn't this presumes there will be a Republican Congress there won't be Senate Senate Democrats are probably going to win out but let's assume that Trump ended up with the Republican House and Senate George W Bush had a Republican House and Senate was that any basket of roses well Trump will be a lot worse than Bush was okay the fact that cotton the fact is Congress tends to follow the lead of the president not the other way around not the other way around finally there's the argument that if you just sit out if you don't if you don't vote that you're abdicating the decision it's moral cowardice well I'll tell you what's immoral cowardice is pretending that your vote is only an instrument of policy as opposed to a moral imprimatur you put your stink on Donald Trump and his stink goes right back on you you put your vote on Donald Trump you own that you break it you bought it so that's my case against against voting for Donald Trump and there are the most common arguments that you hear in favor of voting for Donald Trump okay with all of that said the race is now on Rush Limbaugh believes that Donald Trump is going to schlong Hillary is gonna beat her in a landslide here's Rush talking about it my instinctive feeling right now is the Trump is gonna win beat Hillary badly that it could be landslide proportions I still don't think people understand I why Trump won this I don't think they understand at all the reason people support Trump okay the reason people support Trump is cuz they're pissed that's the reason people support Trump and presumably what Rush is saying is that they're still going to be pissed when Hillary Clinton is up now I'm gonna make the case for why Trump can win it really has nothing to do there are only two reasons that Trump could actually win and I'm not gonna pretend that Trump can't win because I thought that during the primaries and I was wrong so I'm not gonna make that same mistake again obviously so there's only two reasons that that Trump can win one is that Hillary Clinton has no idea how to deal with Rome no clue how to deal with Trump whatsoever Trump is a wild card he's a wild card and he says things that are gonna be popular because he's pugnacious and people like pugnacious people like the guy who stands up to them so here's Donald Trump yesterday been sent a fox who was the former President of Mexico he came out and he said that he was they did he apologized to Trump he wanted Trump to come visit Mexico here's Donald Trump responding to then sent a fox all right Vicente Fox coming up later on the program got any message for the former president Mexico yeah get your money ready cuz you're gonna pay for the wall you're not backing off that right now of course then look we lose a fortune with Mexico trade deficit 58 billion dollars a year the walls gonna cost 10 believe me they'll be able to afford it and we're gonna end up having a very good relationship with Mexico but right now sadly like everybody else they're taking advantage of our country or trade and at the border so we'll get it straightened up they're taking advantage of our country on trade which is why Mexico is one of the poorer countries on planet Earth is there defeating us on trade but put all that aside the attitude of Trump is appealing to people who feel like they've been let down by a pansy esque and an intentionally negative on America Obama administration and Hillary doesn't know how to deal with this kind of attitude she doesn't know how to deal with it at all so Hillary is here's Hillary's case against Trump and this is weak tea gang you know Anderson I've seen the presidency up close from two different perspectives and I think I know what it takes and I don't think we can take a risk on a loose cannon like Donald Trump running our country you know Donald Trump has said it's okay for other countries to get nuclear weapons I think that's just downright dangerous he has said wages are too high I think we need to have a raise for the American people raise the minimum wage get wages back going up I think when he says women should be punished for having abortions that is you know just beyond anything that I could imagine I think most women can imagine did walk that back well he's a loose cannon I mean he's somebody who has said so many things and I'm sure he'll be scrambling and his advisers will be scrambling but he's already said all of these things he says climate change is a Chinese hoax and I think it's real and we've got to pull the world together to deal with it so you can go down a long list some of which she's tried to bob and weave a little bit but I think it's a risk I think he is a loose cannon and loose cannons tend to misfire okay she is the mother telling you to take out the garbage that's not going to work it's not this is Jeb Bush cutting Donald Trump about his tone and tenor on stage and I'll explain why this is gonna fail in just a second why this is insufficient because what normal politics would say is that a loose cannon like Trump should not be President but people are saying okay well I'd rather have a loose cannon who speaks the truth than a rehearsed ridiculously corrupt politician like Hillary Clinton who's tut-tutting everybody from the sidelines the Jeb Bush he got and tried the same tactic and it didn't work by the way when she says that she's seen the presidency up close twice and we can't afford a loose cannon and that's the easiest response for Trump in the world your husband was unsure was unslung his loose cannon I'm elated on the the closest available intern routinely so you can't talk about loose cannons that way and the president you served next was getting people killed in Benghazi and going off to hang out Beyonce at the same time so don't talk to me about loose cannons right you're the one who's getting drunk you know and dancing and then he shows the video of her dancing with a black lady that's been making the rounds all over the all over the internet for years so that that's that's not gonna work at all and then Hillary tries this one she says I dare Trump to come after me with everything he's this is this is not gonna work she dared Donald Trump to use the the 1990s playbook against against her and that is not me if he uses the nineteen it won't be the 1990s playbook it'll be then it'll be the 2016 playbook which has been updated since the 1990s it turns out Trump meanwhile is gonna hit her right back right so here is here's what it looks like when Trump hits her right back he says okay well you know you're gonna top me about being an adult you started this whole birther thing you know who started the birther movement you know started you know questioned his birth certificate one of the first Hillary Clinton she's the one that started it she brought it up years before it was brought up by me look let me just clarify the whole birther thing where do you stand on that now I don't talk about it anymore because every time I talk about it it becomes the story so I don't want to waste my time talking about it anymore but she's gonna raise this issue against you I don't care I'm gonna raise it against her and this is exactly this is exactly it right Trump is gonna show Trump again he still hasn't answered the question does he think Obama was born in Kenya or not this idiotic conspiracy theory but he's just gonna avoid it and if Hillary brings it up he's gonna say you're the one who originally said it she does not have a playbook against him she doesn't have a playbook against him and so that's that's one element of why you know if he becomes president because Hillary is so terrible at this and terrible in general and also because Hillary can't get her own people together so Michael Moore and Bernie Sanders are sort of the representatives of the hard left Barack Obama went down to Flint Michigan or up to Flint Michigan rather to to drink water there yesterday and he said that it was all government neglects they caused all of this yes Democrat government neglect the people who you ally with Michael Moore says well Obama has not done anything to help Flint I'm very disappointed in this in listening to the speech still going on right now Northwestern high school and he is just trying to reach well that everything is okay to drink from a glass of water Flint Flint water when a number of experts are still saying that this water is not safe it's still going through the same corroded lead pipes it was such a disappointing thing to see to say your clip you just showed about he hopes that flunking get back to where it was where was that you mean before the water crisis two years ago after we'd lost seventy five thousand General Motors jobs back to then or are we talking about back to twenty or thirty years ago okay so there it is and and I think that's that's you know evidence that the the left has even fed up with the typical politics of the Democratic Party Bernie Sanders is is meanwhile tearing the party apart he's saying he's gonna stand until the last vote is counted it point of fact Bernie Sanders could finish California with more pledged delegates than Hillary Clinton right now all delegate counts you see with Hillary twenty two hundred and Bernie Sanders at like 1300 or 1400 those count five hundred super-delegates for Hillary Clinton those super-delegates are not like unpledged delegates who were elected in the Republican Party they were chosen by Democratic party insiders specifically to give Hillary the nomination there are five hundred and thirty eight delegates in California alone Sanders is gonna win California he's gonna win it pretty big there's a real possibility that Bernie Sanders leaves at California at parity with Hillary Clinton in the unpledged delegate or rather in the pledged delegate here's here's Bernie Sanders saying he's not gonna stop fighting this fight until it's all the way at the convention I think we have a path toward victory I admit that it is a narrow path but we think everybody in this country people in California in Kentucky in West Virginia I have a right to determine who they want to see as president of the United States and what kind of agenda they want the Democratic Party to have so we're gonna fight Scott for the very last vote that we can get okay so he's gonna stick around for Eva's and Eva's in Eva's and the fact is that because he does so it's going to be a problem for Hillary she can't put she can't put Sanders away it's gonna be difficult to put Trump away Trump and Sanders are basically the same character right the difference is that Sanders is an ideologue who believes what he's saying Trump believes what he's saying but he's a narcissist so it's whatever goes through his head at that given instant Hillary will have a tough time dealing with Trump the reason that Hillary will have a tough time dealing with Trump one of the reasons is because the media are totally in the tank for Trump and for Hillary so it's actually both so here's the way that it works so the media may have created a Frankenstein monster interim the truth is David French pointed this out yesterday and I thought this was totally right David French pointed out that most people in the United States don't know Trump from this presidential run most people in the United States know Trump from being on the cover of Playboy and fourteen years on The Apprentice and he's always on TV talking about business and they think of him as some sort of James Bond slash Richie Rich enormous Lee wealthy real estate genius who's great at business and has the guts to fire people that's how most people think of Donald Trump and they've spent decades building this up they've got the the media have built this myth of the business god-king right the Fox and Friends interviews talking about politics with him for 20 years Tim Russert asking him in 1999 if he wants to be President right I can cover a Playboy in 1989 he's been around well longer in the public eye than I've been alive Donald Trump and so most people had an image of Donald Trump long before he ran that's been a good thing for him in the sense that when he says crazy things it doesn't break out of the pocket of people who care about that and into the general ledger when people are told that this man who they've gotten to know and admire and like and find amusing when they're told that he's a racist con man that he panders to the lowest common denominator a lot of people want to be conned because they feel like okay well I don't want to repent to the fact that I liked him it's like if you said to somebody you know all those actors you know it turns out that Ross and Rachel you know on friends it turns out they were real people and they're really quite terrible they're really quite terrible people most people would reject that if you watch Survivor any of these other reality TV shows if you watch if you watch Shark Tank and you've been watching shark tank and Mark Cuban's on it every week and you've been sold this bill of goods that Mark Cuban is a genius businessman who makes great business decisions and then somebody comes along and they say he's really not a very good businessman also he's a racist you're gonna say well wait I watched him on TV the other night and looked like a racist to me what are you talking about you know you're saying he's a bad businessman he doesn't look like a bad businessman to me there he is with all the other rich people talking about just throwing $100,000 around doesn't look like he's a bad businessman to me well Mark Cuban take my Cuban and multiply him by about 15 and that's the size that Donald Trump is in the public sphere and so there are a lot of viewers Trump we're not gonna buy into the old Democratic playbook that they tried to use against Romney and McCain but these are bad people you don't know them you've never met these people but I'm telling you now that you're meeting them they're bad guys gonna be very hard for the media to tear them down beyond that the media want Trump in the public eye all that they can't resist the temptation the only way to stop Trump would be if the media deprived him of air if the media actually deprived him of air when he says stupid things they just didn't cover it they just didn't cover it they let it kind of simmer under the surface and all you got were tastes of the stupid but instead they're gonna cover him every minute because he drives up the ratings he drives up the ratings Chris Wallace said exactly this Chris Wallace said yeah the reason we cover him so much is because he's good TV he's ratings did the truck support drive the media or did the media drive the Trump support by diminishing real estate for other candidates now I you know I get asked this question a lot I I have to say I think to a certain degree became a vicious or virtuous cycle depending on how you view the Trump campaign but I think we were followers not leaders in this in other words I think that the reason we put him on so much and I think we did all of us whether it was cable whether it was broadcast all of us put him on too much I think to a large degree it was because every time we did it spike the ratings we were in a sense following what the ratings were which was the response of the public having said that the fact that we put them on so much it did crowd out take a lot of the oxygen away from the other candidates but I think at least the initial impulse was you know if you put them on you get ratings and we're in the news business there it is so you know they're in the news business in so they get ratings that's an amazing acknowledgement it really is because there's something linked to that there's a human tendency to always justify your own behavior always and so let's say that you've spent your entire time in this election cycle putting Donald Trump on the air and now you're being asked to give your objective opinion of Donald Trump that he's a bad guy that he's somebody who's unstable that he's somebody who he hangs out with who pander to the David Duke types he's somebody who says ridiculous things about disabled people and veterans and women how do you justify that to everybody when they come back say well you knew all of this way back when why did you put him on the air right all the end all the end see executives you knew this you knew this about he was always like this you put him on the air you made him into a thing right when you unconsciously are the Leni Riefenstahl for for this supposed Hitler what do you do except for get in his corner and justified to yourself okay well I have you know I did it for ratings but he's not that bad a guy he's not that bad a guy how do you justify putting this guy on all the time if it had been David Duke and they gave him that much attention people would say oh you're Pro David Duke that makes you a bad guy but he's not they put him on they made him famous knowing all these bad things about him but he was a ratings bonanza and then they had to justify themselves post facto and it becomes okay well he must not be that bad a guy right network executives have to sleep at night two network executives have to sleep at night too and so it's amazing to watch some of these media figures now trying to buy it back so Joe Scarborough who has spent this entire campaign cycle with his lips firmly plastered to Donald Trump's anus Joe Scarborough came out yesterday and he said no you know what I'm not gonna vote for Trump after all I'm not gonna you know I'm gonna buy it back I don't like Trump after all this time talking up from prating post after post in the Washington Post about the glories of Donald Trump I'm gonna buy it back now I was surprised and disappointed Willie that yesterday he stuck by the Muslim bed yeah that's a loser it's a loser with the majority of Americans and you've got Republicans like me I just I'm not gonna vote for a guy I thought it I'm not gonna vote something okay well that's what he's gonna do he's got to make the turn and say okay this is a system we can put in place how to make a real where we can get Muslims allow Muslims to come into America but maybe not from Syria if they don't have the property but he's got to start making turns like that because I can tell you I'm not I'm never gonna vote for a guy that is saying he's going to ban somebody just because of the God they worshipped and he's got to make that turn fast he didn't do it yesterday maybe did does it over the next couple weeks uh-huh so is for now Nelson Joe Scarborough has has found his anti Trump spine after months after months and him and mica just pushing Trump up the wazoo yeah now they found it mm-hmm this is them buying it back a little bit now now that they have to turn toward Hillary so they got to buy it back and it's just awkward Rob Reiner who is never right about anything you know the director of Sleepless in Seattle and Princess Bride Rob Reiner he came out and he bashed this is the first time ever I'm going to agree with Rob Reiner here he is going after Joe Scarborough what does this man say yeah which what does he say course we do he's not pinned down I want to hear how he's going to deport 12 million people I'm gonna bet how Easton how is he going to on wait because you're just talking you're not letting anybody else talk we asked those questions I could I would bet you your proceeds from your next 20 films that I could find you any question that you bring up now about the wall which we could try to nail him down the monotron ban in it we gave Bob Woodward 20 minutes we take and what he does is he talks around in circles so the questions are okay so so they're repeated no that's okay so then the next question is why are you talking around in circles right why are you not answering my question yes we've aspect and then what does he say he says I am believe me well even when that just blatantly I'll be I'll be wrong with you yes how do you for I believe me is not an act believe me is not an answer that's what I said then what then my no wait then what does he say he said he keeps going on and on and on and in and then I thought you had a special robot Rob you think we're not adding this is what everybody thinks and it's one of the plays frustrate a covering Donald Trump people say you know you should really ask and I don't beat what we did I'll send you the computer you should really ask me to make and we will so finally you say would you like me to actually get on top of him and like pin him down with my maybe I should stick my heel down his is that not one of the frustrations that people always come to whiting has miss well I did and this is what he said stop okay the frustration is not just that you don't ask him it's that when he talks around in circles afterward you laugh with him after he lies to your face you laugh with him if Ted Cruz did that you wouldn't be laughing with him you'd pull the plug on his interview right if Donald Trump talks like that the final word is you keep lying to me by talking around in circles if you do that I'm pulling the plug on this interview right they never have done that that has never happened and it will never happen because the fact is they like Donald Trump and they laugh right along with this whole routine they ask a few questions for cover but in the end they never pull the plug and they never will pull the plug you have people like Sean Hannity and this is this pains me because I like Sean a lot personally I think Sean is a good guy but sean has really done yeoman war pushing Trump and and making him the nominee it's really sad last night Sean did a full-on monologue trying to justify why he had pushed so hard for Trump as the nominee basically disowned his own impact he basically said it's not my fault sure I just spent the last six months really really pushing Trump like getting behind him with a bulldozer in pushing Trump but not my fault don't blame me it's just the people it's just what the people on now some of you out there you're blaming let's see Fox News or blaming talk radio by the way personally I wish I had that much power and that much influence I don't neither does anybody else if I did Obama never would have been president now those of you who have that analysis I think it's extremely shallow and by the way also predicated on this notion that well people are stupid people were bamboozled sorry I don't buy that for one second so he's making two arguments there one is he doesn't have enough power to push Trump if he had he would have stopped Obama what this is just numerical idiocy the fact is that he has way more impact does people like Sean Hannity in a in a Republican primary than in a general election where none of the swing voters are watching Fox News right I mean we all understand this and then his second argument is the voters did it I didn't have anything to do with it well then why are you on TV then what are you doing there I hope I have some impact I hope people believe what I say I hope that I'm helping to push people the reason people are disappointed in Sean is that he's actually a conservative and he just helped nominate the single most leftist candidate in the history of the Republican Party that's why people are frustrated but the media will defend themselves in this defense this kind of self-serving defense oh we did our best to stop trumpet we just couldn't this is gonna continue all the way through it's gonna be a problem for Hillary okay quick couple things I like a couple things I hate and then mailbag okay so things I like there's a good book by Ed Morris he called going red that's that's out now I'm in the middle of it I want to do a Q&A with with Edie for for our for a website he focuses in on seven different counties in the United States that are sort of swing counties and what exactly do they want instead of folks 300 million Americans most of whom don't vote he focuses in on the swing counties it's a very interesting book and worth going to get it's at Amazon and and your local bookstore next things I like Chris Matthews got caught on a hot mic this is always entertaining so Chris man Joey State he's talking about Melania Trump there she has Melania and and he feels a thrill run up his leg higher and higher and higher in this clip you'll hear it and the party will trust Trump to be able to make that to say well I think the party does have a role in it to Sarah Walker my runway we just heard from the likely nominee of the Republican Party we will go to a break here I can watch the discussion continues right after this he's saying you saying it's like a runway walk some of the over hey watch you do alt arrow and camera on you why rocket ah ah even better than when I was with President bomb in the Oval Office it's unbelievable Melania Trump unbelievable and Kathleen I hope she's not watching this I hope I'm not in a hot mic or something I mean this is gonna be really awkward if the people found that I don't know what to do I care from the morning she's coming here brush my hair they should get in front of you're not allowed to enjoy I mean come on we're looking across the desk at Rachel Maddow come on and look at across the desk at Michael Isikoff come on I got Melania got a better look at that come on I mean look at that your motto it's beautiful walks that walks that line me I could look at that all day oh boy could I look at that all day I could look at that like I was looking at Ted Kennedy right in the face while he's drinking and guffawing and oh my god this is great Chris Matthews on MSNBC doing the kind of coverage that no one else does okay couple of things that I hate yesterday I can't say I had a 20 year subscription or since I was like 12 I've been subscribing to Sports Illustrated and enjoying it every week in the last few years Sports Illustrated has become a wild leftist outlet and it's really irritating I like read I have a basic rule during my day job I watched politics during my evenings I don't watch anything about politics I won't watch house of cards I won't watch political movies I only do things that have nothing to do with politics right I like to watch sports and I like to watch daredevil and that's pretty much it like I and I like to hang out with my kid my wife that's that's my life I don't like my sports being infiltrated with stupid garbage so Caitlyn Jenner is apparently going to pose nude with the American flag on the cover of Sports Illustrated Caitlyn Jenner right so first of all good luck to that American flag second of all Caitlyn Jenner posing nude on the cover of Sports Illustrated Bruce Jenner was the relevant to athlete Caitlyn Jenner is not irrelevant to athlete Caitlyn Jenner has never done anything in athletics if you assume that now Bruce Jenner is a woman if you assume that Bruce Jenner is still a man then it is just a circus and a ridiculous circus at that to slap this nonsense in my face it is cruel to the mentally ill it is cruel to the rest of society to suppose that the that Caitlyn Jenner is some sort of hero for getting a boob job and retaining his male appendages because he's mentally ill this is not it's not something that I want to hear about generally as something that is good for society and it's certainly not something that I care to subsidize with my dollars and have to read about in a sports magazine where all I really want to read about is how the NBA playoffs won I mean for God's sake can't I just watch the NBA Playoffs can't I just watch the NBA Playoffs if I want there are certain bouncing balls that I'm interested in watching but they are not on Caitlyn Jenner okay I'm not interested in that in those sorts in those sorts of balls okay so that's one thing second thing the Department of Justice is now declared that the North Carolina bathroom law that says men should go to the bathroom in men's bathrooms and women should go into the bathroom in women's bathrooms they've declared that this violates federal law that this is discrimination against women is what they're saying now it's discrimination against women if men can't pee in the women's bathrooms yes we have reached the end of the world okay a couple of mailbag questions I know that we're running a little bit late so we'll pick a couple of short ones sorry to skimp on the mailbag but we do what we can okay rosemary says is Trump still capable of destroying the media you commented in the past if you had to choose between destroying the media and Hillary you would destroy the media my vote is unearned at this particular time trump is not capable of destroying the media he's capable of exploiting the media the media will remain just as powerful as they ever did because they are happy to promulgate Trump's lies because Trump is a leftist because Trump is a leftist so he has a he's an exception to the rules they can call him a racist and it won't apply when they turn around they call someone who's less well-known a racist it will still apply this is sort of like the question I get about Hollywood conservatives people will say well you know there's some Hollywood conservatives who work like Gary Sinise and Adam Baldwin and the truth is if you even ask people like Gary or Adam do you feel like you've been discriminated against in Hollywood usually they say no usually they say no you know I've had a very successful career right because you were successful before you became conservative right for the grip who's starting on the film the last thing you want to do is start by saying by opening up with oh yeah by the way I backed Ted Cruz in the primaries right the fact is that Donald Trump is like that with the media for the unknowns going up against the media the media will still crush you under foot Donald Trump was built by the media so now he's an exception to all of the media rules Tyla rights hey Ben his protectionism as we justified what have foreign countries imposed tariffs on our goods should we do the same to make up for the trade deficit with specific entities Thanks protectionism is only justified on moral grounds not economic grounds it is not justified on economic grounds so assume for a second that for example you are you you do business with the grocery right you to business with the grocery and the grocery offers the lowest prices you also happen to sell shelves to the grocery or in the shelving business and you sell shelves to the grocery let's say that the grocery decides that they're not going to buy shelves from you okay does it benefit you now to say oh I'm gonna buy food from that grocery of course not if they're still selling the lowest price groceries it benefits you because you can take the money leftover it can spend it on marketing so that you can go sell your shelves someplace else that's why if they raise trade barriers and we're still getting cheap goods okay so we find somewhere else to export but spending our own money at a higher level in order to in order to presumably subsidize industries that can't get into these tariff Laden countries that's economic foolishness it doesn't work that way Wesley rights is it time for you to flush the Rhino party and become a libertarian it is for me if the libertarian party will not wildly incompetent then sure unfortunately the libertarian party is the height of incompetence okay let's see who else Colin we got a bunch of letters like this this week hey Ben I was wondering if you would consider jumping in the presidential race I know the Constitution says you are not old enough to be President then since none of the remaining candidates or their supporters care about the you may as well run this is a fair point and I cannot argue with that I can't I can't argue with that Vince writes hi Ben I've been thinking about the recent uproar surrounding transgendered bathroom access it seems to me these laws are similar in effect who gun-free zones by this I mean gun-free zones do not stop cyclist from shooting up a movie theater so should we expect a gender appropriate bathroom law to stop a pervert from doing something inappropriate in a lady's room the fact is that many of these trends gendered men will use the ladies room and nobody will ever know if pervs enter a ladies room and behave like pervs they'll be arrested and prosecuted where am I wrong this is a good analysis I agree this is why I don't think that the main argument against the transgender bathroom thing is that men are going to go in and victimized women I think the main argument is that women deserve to be able to pee in privacy okay that's in the main argument it's not that I think that men are gonna go in and start randomly raping women if rapists want to rape they'll rape what I am saying is that for I will say that there's more of an excuse for men to leer and ogle at women under the guise of being transgender if they do this doesn't F be outright rape and then when they're asked about it then they can claim discrimination this could happen but the main argument is why is it bad for women's who want to feel comfortable in a place where they're exposing themselves why is it bad for them to not want to look at a penis when they are going to pee in the women's room right why is that a bad thing I don't understand it seems to me a bit of mansplaining if you ask me to say to women no no matter what you say that penis you're looking at in the bathroom without your consent that is that's a woman that's a woman and you just don't understand because you're not a proper woman if you were really a proper woman you'd understand that that penis is quite female right this seems to me a little bit of men's planning okay final question someone writes vaccines do you believe the government should require parents to vaccinate their child should parents be held responsible for the death of their child or other children due to lack of vaccination is it acceptable for schools to require students to be vaccinated as I said many times when as I've said many times yes I am in favor of regulations that force vaccinations the reason I'm in favor of this is because I'm in favor of regulations that prohibit the acts externalities the point of vaccination is herd immunity the idea is if you don't vaccinate your child somebody else could get sick right there are women who are pregnant we can't get the vaccination there are kids who have leukemia who can't get the vaccination if you're an idiot and you didn't get the MMR for your kid and your kid gets measles yeah it's your kid until it turns out that you got a pregnant woman sick with the measles and now her kid is put in danger that is a problem that's a problem and by the way a lot of these vaccinations like pertussis are not a hundred percent effective they're like 80 percent effective which means that if a hundred percent of the population is eighty percent effective then there's a much lower chance of an epidemic of pertussis than a 50 percent of the population is eighty percent effective right that's that's the that's the basic math okay actually will do one more hey Ben I'm a young college student majoring in criminal justice I want to practice law what advice would you have for being able to perform well in school and on the LSAT love the show keep the faith okay so the LSAT I recommend test master is very good testing program if you can afford it they didn't that expensive I don't think and they are a very good test prep program as far as doing well in school you know the same rules always apply buckle down study hard and and tell your professors what they want to hear don't fight them on the tests and I lied one more okay Daniel writes do you think businesses should be allowed to reject service for any reason does every American have the right to exchange with every business Daniel no I don't have a right to exchange with you I have a right to offer you my services and you have a right to reject my services I have a right to that I have a right to offer my services and you have a right to reject them then that's the bottom line yes I can reject service to you for any reason that's the essence of freedom anything else is indentured servitude now that doesn't mean that I may not be a jerk for picking the reason but there are lots of things in America where I think you have a right to do them even if you're a jerk I think people in the United States have a right against the government to say the n-word I also think that they're pieces of human crap but you have a right to do that I think people have a right to get people pregnant out of wedlock I don't think there has to be a prohibition on that so I think you're a bad person if you do that yeah I think there are lots of things in America with which I don't agree this is why I'm a believer in freedom this is why the left is not the left believes that if they don't like something it has to be made illegal that is the only way for the society to function properly okay we've reached the end of the week I would say that don't ruin things over the weekend but screw you you already did it's already been ruined so have yourself a merry little weekend but don't worry we'll be back on Monday maybe with a new baby maybe we'll say we'll see so we will we'll keep you updated on that have a wonderful weekend I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
