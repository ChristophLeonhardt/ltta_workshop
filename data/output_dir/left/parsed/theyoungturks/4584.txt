CBS
HAS A SHOW CALLED HAWAII 5.0,
AND THEY JUST LOST TWO OF THEIR
MAIN CAST MEMBERS OUT OF THE
FOUR.
THE TWO ASIAN AMERICANS
YOU WILL RECOGNIZE FROM BATTLE
STAR GALACTICA AND LOST.
THEY
WANTED TO GET PAID AS MUCH AS
THE OTHER STARS, AND THAT ALL
FELL APART.
SO THEY WILL NOT BE
BACK THIS NEXT SEASON WHICH
GUESS WHAT SEASON IT IS?
>> I WOULD'VE NEVER GUESSED IT
RIGHT.
I SAW IT IN THE ARTICLE.
I WOULD'VE GUESSED TWO OR MAYBE
THREE.
IT TURNS OUT-
>> THIS WILL BE IT'S
EIGHTH SEASON.
>> IT HAS BEEN ON FOR SEVEN
SEASONS?
THAT MIGHT BE LONGER
THAN THE ORIGINAL.
>>I DON'T WATCH THE SHOW ñ THE
REASON WHY I KNOW IT IS BECAUSE
OF JANE AND BATTLE
STAR GALACTICA GIRL.
>> YEAH, HE WAS 
VERY GRACIOUS.
HE THANKED A COUPLE OF THE
EXECUTIVES AT CBS BY NAME.
GIVEN
WHAT HAPPENED THAT IS
SURPRISING.
BLESS HIS HEART FOR
BEING GRACIOUS.
WHAT WAS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SETS?
THE WHITE ACTORS GOT 2% MORE.
CBS SAYS THEY OFFERED THEM A
LUCRATIVE CONTRACT, NOT THE SAME
AS THE WHITE ACTORS.
YOU THINK
THEY ARE GOING TO WAR OVER 2%?
NO.
ON PRINCIPLE I'M I SUPPOSE
YOU COULD.
WHITE ACTORS GET
POINTS WHICH MEANS THEY CAN GET
A PERCENTAGE OF THE SHOWS
REVENUE IN THE FUTURE.
THEY WENT
OVER 100 EPISODES WHICH MEANS
THEY CAN GO INTO SYNDICATION AND
GET A TON OF MONEY IN RERUNS.
BUT THE ASIAN ACTORS WILL NOT BE
GETTING THEM.
IF YOU SAID THEY
HAPPEN TO BE ASIAN, AND THOSE
GUYS HAPPEN TO BE WHITE, AND THE
WHITE GUYS ARE MORE FAMOUS.
I
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU.
JUST
BECAUSE THEY ARE ASIAN DOESN'T
MEAN THEY GET TO BE AS FAMOUS AS
THE OTHER GUYS, RIGHT?
BUT IN
THIS CASE THAT IS NOT TRUE, THE
ASIAN ACTORS ARE MORE FAMOUS
THAN THE WHITE ACTORS.
>> WHEN I DESCRIBED THESE PEOPLE
I SAY BATTLE STAR GALACTICA
GIRL, THE GUY FROM THAT MOVIE
WITH JAY LENO, AND THEN JIN.
I
ONLY NAME ONE PERSON BY THE
ACTUAL CHARACTER, I KNOW HIM THE
BEST.
HE SHOULD BE THE ONE
MAKING ALL THE MONEY.
BUT THEY
SAY IT IS A TRUE ENSEMBLE CAST.
THE BEST PART ABOUT THE
STATEMENT ñ THIS IS FROM PETER
LENKOV, THE EXECUTIVE
PRODUCER/SHOWRUNNER.
>>THEY SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR
HAVING AN ENSEMBLE CAST.
YOU
KNOW PAY
THEM THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY.
I
KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF
DIFFERENT FACTORS, AND YOU CAN
DISAGREE ON WHO IS MORE
FAMOUS, BUT THESE GUYS ARE AT
WORST AT THE SAME LEVEL, SO
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO PAY
THEM THE SAME AMOUNT.
>>ALL
THE PEOPLE ON FRIENDS WENT TO
BAT TOGETHER AND SAID LISTEN
WE WANT TO GET PAID THE SAME
BECAUSE WE ARE EQUAL BILLING.
AND THEY GOT IT.
