women often feel like we have to do people pleasers and actually we should just kind of stop being so damn nice I like to think of myself as a reformed perfectionist and the way that you become that is by taking more risks and taking those risks I wish I would have done more earlier on in my career because what you learn from taking the risk is that you become a more unique person in the end and even in television you know they're trying to do something a little bit more out of the box instead of trying to be so much like that anchor mode it took me a while to actually have the courage to take those risks just professionally so that's the biggest advice that I could give to my younger self or to really anyone not even in the TV business but just in any aspect of their life I have a 12 year old son and a 14 year old daughter I've seen my daughter especially exhibit that bravery and telling me that she did what she did and standing up for herself because she saw her mom do it and in the end that's what we all want for our children we want to be able to pass along that gift of courage and I want that for other parents out there it's Riya wrote the book I mean I hope they'll pass it along to their children as well especially high school and college age kids this is where it starts we have to raise our kids in equal fashion and give our kids the same opportunities and especially our boys be raised to respect women not only in the home when they get into the workplace then they exhibit that same amount of respect for their female colleagues it's essential to stop this harassment cycle
