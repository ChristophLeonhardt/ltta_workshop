1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:02,620
PROBE THAT KEEPS THE FOCUS,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,655
YES, ON THE RUSSIA PROBE.

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:05,322
MARTHA?

4
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:06,190
>> Martha: INDEED IT DOES.

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,891
ED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:09,460
JOINING US NOW SOUTH

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,661
CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN TREY

8
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:12,229
GOWDY CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE

9
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,397
OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT

10
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:15,900
REFORM COMMITTEE AND HOUSE

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,601
INTEL COMMITTEE.

12
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:17,935
YOU WERE ONE WHO SAW SOME OF

13
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,237
THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS

14
00:00:19,237 --> 00:00:20,371
RELATED TO THIS ISSUE OF

15
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,305
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A

16
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:22,773
SPY OR INFORMANT IN THE

17
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,808
CAMPAIGN LATE LAST WEEK.

18
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,142
ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SHARE

19
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:26,811
ON A BROAD SCALE ABOUT WHAT

20
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:27,645
WENT DOWN THERE?

21
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:28,913
>> I THINK THERE ARE TWO

22
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:29,747
THINGS IMPORTANT TO

23
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:30,148
UNDERSTAND.

24
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:30,915
NUMBER ONE, THE SOURCE OF

25
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,350
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S

26
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:32,884
FRUSTRATION.

27
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:34,752
BRENNAN SAID HE SHOULD BE IN

28
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:36,354
THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY.

29
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:37,288
COMEY SAID IMPEACHMENT IS

30
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,723
TOO GOOD OF A REMEDY.

31
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:40,124
CLAPPER DOESN’T LIKE HIM.

32
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,126
LORETTA LYNCH SAID CALL IT A

33
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:43,228
MATTER, NOT AN

34
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:43,661
INVESTIGATION.

35
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:44,362
SCHIFF SAID HE HAD EVIDENCE

36
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:46,664
OF COLLUSION BEFORE WE EVEN

37
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:47,932
BEGAN THE INVESTIGATION AND

38
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:49,267
60 DEMOCRATS HAVE VOTED TO

39
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:50,201
IMPEACH HIM BEFORE BOB

40
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:51,936
MUELLER HAS COME UP WITH A

41
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:53,438
SINGLE, SOLITARY FINDING.

42
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:54,906
THAT’S WHAT HAS HIM

43
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:55,307
FRUSTRATED.

44
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:58,143
WHAT SHOULD HAVE HIM

45
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,611
HEARTENSIDE CHRIS WRAY, ROD

46
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:00,812
ROSENSTEIN AND ALL THE

47
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:02,280
SENIOR WERE ALL TRUMP

48
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,681
APPOINTEES.

49
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,149
HERE IS WHAT IS FAIR TO ASK.

50
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,617
WHAT DID THE FBI DO?

51
00:01:05,617 --> 00:01:06,685
WHEN DID THEY DO IT?

52
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:08,687
WHAT WAS THE FACTUAL

53
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:09,721
PREDICATE UPON WHICH THEY

54
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,056
TOOK WHATEVER ACTIONS THEY

55
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:12,290
TOOK AND AGAINST WHOM WERE

56
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,725
THEY DIRECTED?

57
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:15,560
BUT, REMEMBER, MARTHA, IT

58
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,962
WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF

59
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:18,997
WHO SAID, NUMBER ONE, I

60
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,232
DIDN’T COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA

61
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:21,567
BUT IF ANYONE CONNECTED WITH

62
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,569
MY CAMPAIGN DID, I WANT THE

63
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,137
FBI TO FIND THAT OUT.

64
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:26,772
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE FBI

65
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:28,140
WAS DOING WHAT PRESIDENT

66
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,775
TRUMP SAID I WANT YOU TO DO

67
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:30,809
FIND IT OUT.

68
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:32,044
HE IS NOT THE TARGET.

69
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:33,379
SO, WHEN SCHIFF AND OTHERS

70
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,546
DON’T MAKE THAT CLEAR, THEY

71
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:35,748
ARE DOING A DISSERVICE TO

72
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:36,982
OUR FELLOW CITIZENS.

73
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:38,617
HE IS NOT THE TARGET.

74
00:01:38,617 --> 00:01:39,351
>> Martha: THIS RAISES THE

75
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,185
QUESTION THAT THE PRESIDENT

76
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:41,620
RAISED IN THIS -- ONE OF

77
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,087
THOSE TWEETS.

78
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:43,289
THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM.

79
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,356
IN WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT

80
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:45,825
QUITE A BIT HERE LAST WEEK

81
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:46,926
IF THAT WERE THE CASE, WHY

82
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,060
DIDN’T THEY GIVE HIM A

83
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,794
LITTLE BRIEFING.

84
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,096
HERE IS WHAT WE FOUND OUT.

85
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,063
YOU KNOW, WE DO HAVE

86
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:52,198
SOMEBODY WHO ASKED SOME

87
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:52,999
QUESTIONS OF GEORGE

88
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:53,432
PAPADOPOULOS.

89
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:54,500
WE DO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO HAS

90
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,535
ASKED QUESTIONS OF CARTER

91
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:56,836
PAGE.

92
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:57,536
HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO

93
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:58,204
KNOW.

94
00:01:58,204 --> 00:02:00,072
>> I THINK DEFENSIVE

95
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:01,107
BRIEFINGS ARE DONE A LOT.

96
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:02,742
AND WHY THE COMEY FBI DIDN’T

97
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:03,976
DO IT, I DON’T KNOW.

98
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:05,445
BUT CHRIS WRAY AND ROD

99
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:06,245
ROSENSTEIN HAVE AT LEAST

100
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,647
MADE IT CLEAR TO US, DONALD

101
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:08,781
TRUMP WAS NEVER THE TARGET

102
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:09,749
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

103
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:10,683
HE IS NOT THE CURRENT TARGET

104
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:11,818
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

105
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:14,120
NOW, KEEP IN MIND, THAT CAN

106
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,421
ALL CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHAT

107
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,489
A WITNESS SAYS.

108
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,091
AS OF NOW, I THINK CHRIS

109
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:19,993
WRAY AND ROD ROSENSTEIN ARE

110
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:20,894
STUNNED WHENEVER PEOPLE

111
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:21,828
THINK TRUMP IS THE TARGET OF

112
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:23,062
THEIR INVESTIGATION.

113
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,431
I WILL LEAVE IT UP TO THEM

114
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,533
HOW TO BRIEF THE PRESIDENT.

115
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,133
>> Martha: THAT POINT OF

116
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:27,767
VIEW THAT YOU ARE TALKING

117
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:28,702
ABOUT RIGHT NOW, WAS THAT

118
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:29,369
STRENGTHENED WHEN YOU WENT

119
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:30,403
INTO THIS BRIEFING LAST

120
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:30,704
WEEK?

121
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:31,538
>> YES.

122
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:33,340
I AM EVEN MORE CONVINCED

123
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,908
THAT THE FBI DID EXACTLY

124
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:36,209
WHAT MY FELLOW CITIZENS

125
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:37,377
WOULD WANT THEM TO DO WHEN

126
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:38,478
THEY GOT THE INFORMATION

127
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:39,279
THEY GOT.

128
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,547
AND THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO

129
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:42,149
DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.

130
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:42,749
>> Martha: ALL RIGHT.

131
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:43,917
SO, GIVEN THE THINGS THAT

132
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,419
WERE OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT

133
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,221
HAND, ALL THE FRUSTRATIONS,

134
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:49,589
DO YOU THINK IT’S

135
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:50,657
PROBLEMATIC THE WAY THE

136
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:51,992
PRESIDENT HAS -- IS TWEETING

137
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:52,926
ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME?

138
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,094
BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE HE

139
00:02:54,094 --> 00:02:54,828
NEEDS TO VENT.

140
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:56,563
HE HAS GOT TO GET HIS

141
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:57,097
MESSAGE OUT THERE.

142
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:58,765
IS IT LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC IN

143
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:00,033
YOUR MIND WHAT HE IS DOING?

144
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,069
>> I THINK ANY TIME YOU

145
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,170
CREATE PRIOR STATEMENTS YOU

146
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,438
GIVE MUELLER OR OTHER FOLKS

147
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:05,706
A CHANCE TO QUESTION YOU ON

148
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:07,407
THEM AND ASK WHAT WAS YOUR

149
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:08,108
FACTUAL BASIS.

150
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:09,243
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?

151
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:10,511
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE

152
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,645
ACCESS TO THE BEST LEGAL

153
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:12,413
MINDS IN THE COUNTRY.

154
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:14,014
AND I THINK HE SHOULD TAKE

155
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:14,715
ADVANTAGE OF THOSE.

156
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:16,450
AND HE HAS GOT SOME REALLY

157
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,518
GOOD COMMUNICATORS THAT ARE

158
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:20,421
ON HIS STAFF AND AT HIS

159
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:20,721
CALL.

160
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:22,323
IF I WERE HIS LAWYER, AND I

161
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:23,390
NEVER WILL BE, I WOULD TELL

162
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,192
HIM TO RELY ON HIS LAWYERS

163
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,995
AND HIS COMMS FOLKS.

164
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:29,397
>> Martha: HERE IS ONE OF

165
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:30,097
THEM, RUDY GIULIANI SPEAKING

166
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:31,832
WITH BILL HEMMER OVER THE

167
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:32,633
HOLIDAY WEEKEND.

168
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:33,167
WATCH.

169
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,235
THIS WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE

170
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:35,102
GOVERNMENT TRYING TO FIGURE

171
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:36,237
OUT WHAT RUSSIA WAS UP TO?

172
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:37,939
>> NOTHING WRONG WITH THE

173
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,473
GOVERNMENT DOING THAT.

174
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:40,241
EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE

175
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,310
GOVERNMENT SPYING ON A

176
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,678
CANDIDATE OF THE OPPOSITION

177
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:43,978
PARTY.

178
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:45,446
THAT’S A WATERGATE.

179
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:46,581
SPY GATE.

180
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:48,015
I MEAN, AND WITHOUT ANY

181
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:51,986
WARNING TO HIM AND NOW, TO

182
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:53,154
COMPOUND THAT AND TO MAKE IT

183
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:53,855
INTO A CRIMINAL

184
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:54,389
INVESTIGATION, BILL.

185
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:55,657
THAT’S WHY THIS IS A RIGGED

186
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:56,991
INVESTIGATION.

187
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,226
>> THERE ARE TWO THINGS

188
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,260
WRONG WITH WHAT THE FORMER

189
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,161
U.S. ATTORNEY SAID.

190
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,596
NUMBER ONE, NO ONE KNOWS

191
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:02,964
WHETHER THIS IS A CRIMINAL

192
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:03,398
INVESTIGATION.

193
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:05,166
MUELLER WAS TOLD TO DO A

194
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:05,734
COUNTER INTELLIGENCE

195
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:06,468
INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT

196
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:08,036
RUSSIA DID.

197
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:11,272
NUMBER TWO, PRESIDENT TRUMP

198
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:14,009
HIMSELF IN THE COMEY MEMOS

199
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:14,943
SAID IF ANYONE CONNECTED

200
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:16,177
WITH MY CAMPAIGN WAS WORKING

201
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:18,178
WITH RUSSIA, I WANT YOU TO

202
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:19,346
INVESTIGATE IT AND IT SOUNDS

203
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,249
TO ME LIKE THAT IS EXACTLY

204
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:23,018
WHAT THE FBI DID.

205
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:24,352
I THINK WHEN THE PRESIDENT

206
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:26,121
FINDS OUT WHAT HAPPENED, HE

207
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:27,522
IS GOING TO BE NOT JUST

208
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:28,657
FINE, HE IS GOING TO BE GLAD

209
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:30,926
THAT WE HAVE AN FBI THAT

210
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:33,328
TOOK SERIOUSLY WHAT THEY

211
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:33,629
HEARD.

212
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:34,830
HE WAS NEVER THE TARGET.

213
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,798
RUSSIA IS THE TARGET.

214
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:37,599
>> Martha: SOUNDS TO ME AS

215
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,201
IF YOU WOULD ADVISE HIM

216
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:40,335
THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH HIM

217
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:41,370
SITTING DOWN WITH ROBERT

218
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:41,703
MUELLER.

219
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,271
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

220
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:45,007
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID I THINK

221
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,308
YOU OUGHT TO SIT DOWN WITH

222
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:46,742
BOB MUELLER.

223
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:47,910
YOU TOLD US PUBLICLY THERE

224
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,111
WAS NO COLLUSION.

225
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:50,346
YOU TOLD US PUBLICLY THERE

226
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:51,280
WAS NO OBSTRUCTION.

227
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,648
SAY IN PRIVATE WHAT HAVE YOU

228
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:53,349
SAID PUBLICLY.

229
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,050
LIMIT THE SCOPE TO EXACTLY

230
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,353
WHAT THE MUELLER MEMO IS,

231
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:59,088
BUT IF HE WERE MY CLIENT,

232
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:00,356
AND I WOULD SAY IF YOU HAVE

233
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:01,457
DONE NOTHING WRONG, THEN YOU

234
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:02,825
NEED TO SIT DOWN AND TELL

235
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:06,061
MUELLER WHAT YOU KNOW.

236
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:06,695
>> Martha: THERE WAS ONE

237
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:07,530
JUDGE WHO SAID THAT THE

238
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,998
SCOPE WAS ALL OVER THE

239
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:09,298
PLACE.

240
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:10,099
DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

241
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:10,633
THE SCOPE OF THIS

242
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:11,267
INVESTIGATION AND DO YOU

243
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,401
FEEL LIKE YOUR COMMITTEE HAS

244
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,604
BEEN SHARED WITH TO THE

245
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,105
EXTENT THAT THAT EXISTS THAT

246
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:17,306
THE SCOPE EXISTS?

247
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:18,741
>> I’M NOT SURE WHAT THE

248
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:19,642
SCOPE OF THE MUELLER PROBE

249
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:21,777
IS I KNOW THIS:  ROSENSTEIN

250
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:23,980
IS THE ONE WHO CREATED THE

251
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,347
MEMO.

252
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:24,847
>> Martha: RIGHT.

253
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:26,516
>> IT’S NOT BOB MUELLER’S

254
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:26,883
FAULT.

255
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:27,517
>> Martha: HAVE YOU SEEN

256
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:27,884
THAT MEMO.

257
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:28,251
>> I HAVE.

258
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,085
I HAVE SEEN THE MEMO HAVE

259
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,119
YOU SEEN ALSO.

260
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,321
THE OTHER MEMO SOME OF MY

261
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,022
COLLEAGUES WANTS TO SEE IS A

262
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:33,823
MORE NARROW.

263
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,757
>> Martha: THE ONE THAT

264
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:35,758
BASICALLY SAYS INVESTIGATE

265
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:36,726
RUSSIA AND ANYTHING RELATED

266
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:37,760
TO IT?

267
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,295
>> AND AS A THROW AWAY LINE

268
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,730
AT THE END AND, OF COURSE,

269
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,831
IF THERE IS ANY ACCURATELY

270
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,099
LOOK AT THAT, TOO.

271
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,234
WE RUN TOWARDS THE

272
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:44,801
CRIMINALITY.

273
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,668
BUT I WOULD THINK EVERYONE

274
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:46,669
WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT

275
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,640
RUSSIA DID.

276
00:05:50,640 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH HOME IS THE THE SECOND
