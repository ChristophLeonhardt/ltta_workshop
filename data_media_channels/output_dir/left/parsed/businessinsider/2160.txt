well is very similar to kosher it's a
slaughter ritual to make sure that the
animals clean and fit for consumption
all the farms we source from one they
have to be clean hygienic the animals
have to be well fed my preference is
pasteurized organic at minimum we get
all natural no antibiotics no hormones
no growth stimulants it's also very
important with the halal process is that
one we never sharpen the knives in front
of the animals and also the animals are
sorted one at a time no other animal can
see another one being slaughtered it
yields a higher quality meat because
it's not as stressed out and finally
before slaughtering if it's blessed why
we say is bismillah Allahu Akbar and
that means the name of God God is great
