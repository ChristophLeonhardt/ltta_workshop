going to pardons and ash D'Souza Dinesh of course has been a guest on the program I'm friendly with Dinesh so full disclosure on that Dinesh is was basically railroaded back in back during the Obama administration who's in the middle of making an anti-obama documentary and it was revealed that Dinesh D'Souza had engaged in the prime of the process of straw donations so basically there's a woman in one who's running for Senate and dinesh wanted to give $20,000 to her he couldn't he could only give $5,000 to her so a bunch of people gave $5,000 to Wendy long and then tonight refused to reimburse them right he acknowledged this in court he pled guilty in court and he was sentenced to a certain amount of prison time now the reason that this isn't just a case of somebody doing something wrong and going to jail is because the vast majority of cases like this end with a fine the vast majority of cases like this do not end with actual prosecution to the point where somebody goes to jail and it seems a little coincidental that dinesh d'souza was making anti-obama documentaries just about the time that the Obama DOJ decided it was necessary that dinesh d'souza go to jail what President Trump responded today by saying that he's going to pardon Dinesh D'Souza Dinesh already served his time obviously yeah here's my generalized opinion on this I do not believe the president should have pardon power just not Trump any president I think it's very silly that the Constitution has pardon power for the president that governors have pardon power I think it's really dumb specifically because either you believe the criminal justice system works or you believe it doesn't and having one guy who is sort of like a kadhi sitting under a tree ruling as to whether people ought to be spared the penalties of their of their crimes that seems to me rather dictatorial and menarche it doesn't have a lot to do with the balance of powers checks and balances of a functioning republic I don't like the power generally but if you're going to use the power you have to use it very sparingly and you ought to use the power in this particular case I would have thought that it would be more of a commutation situation so there's a difference in Parden power between pardoning someone and commuting their sentence if you pardoned somebody then their crime goes away it's off the books as though they never committed the crime in the first place if you commute somebody's sentence then if they were about to serve time they no longer have to serve time so right now there's a serious call to give commutation to this guy who spent 21 years in prison and then was allowed out of prison and then it turns out that the system got it wrong and he's already rebuilt his life in they're gonna send him back to prison there's a strong call by some people like friends might like Dana Perino that this guy should have his sentence commuted I agree with that he shouldn't be pardoned because he did commit the crime well in this particular case Dinesh committed the crime is a part inappropriate I'm not sure that a pardon is appropriate I think the commutation would have been appropriate but he already served his time here's where a pardon is appropriate however Dinesh is no longer allowed to vote Dinesh obviously can I get loans very easily it's hard for me to get credit cards I think there are certain penalties that attach to being a felon and Dinesh is a convicted felon which means that he couldn't have done any of those things well Trump is wiping all of that off the books again so I think the pardon would have been the best solution here I think commutation would have if the timing had been right but do I find this to be a wild miscarriage of justice I do not know is it political of course it's political right Dinesh is non president of president Trump's side he's been a very strong advocate for president Trump if Dinesh D'Souza were on the Left I don't think they'd be talking pardon today but this is unfortunately how pardon power works okay this has been true for Clinton it was true of Obama there are a lot of people who receive Pardons and clemency specifically because of their politics Chelsea Manning would still be in prison if it were not for the fact that Chelsea Manning is a wild leftist who is transgender Barack Obama let Chelsea Manning out of prison specifically because of those factors so to pretend that the pardon power has not already been used for innately political purposes would be to ignore the truth of the situation so whoa you hear the left complaining a lot about the dinesh pardon today I just I don't buy the outrage I don't know that it's you know that the greatest move in the world but I also don't think that it's it's unjustified and I think that the idea that Dinesh never went to jail for this is insane okay so meanwhile there's there's some other news from the Trump administration we are now in the middle apparently of a trade war so that's excellent there's a lot of talk about Trump was not going to enter into a trade war and he decided that I guess it was worthwhile doing so so he is he's decided to extend tariffs to the EU on a number of products and those products include include steel and aluminum according to the Guardian a full-scale trade war between Washington and Brussels is looming after the u.s. announced it was imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union the president of the European Commission jean-claude Juncker promised swift retaliation after the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said EU companies would face a 25% duty on steel and a 10% duty on aluminum from midnight on Thursday Europe along with Canada and Mexico had been granted a temporary reprieve but Ross and insufficient progress had been made in talks with three of America's traditional allies and so we had we could not reduce America's trade deficit and the waiver was being lifted so right now we are talking about a serious trade war that could impact the economy it's a bad move by President Trump the reality is that tariffs are not good for the economy all they are is attacks on American citizens remember when you artificial boost the price of products that Americans have to buy that is a de facto tax on American citizens they can no longer spend their money where they choose to spend their money plus a lot of these companies that are going to end up being tariffs to actually hire a lot of people in the United States like half of a Mercedes Benz is produced in the United States that plans based in the United States some of those cars luxury items will be hit with some of these tariffs also the president of the United States has started a trade war with Mexico so now Mexico is threatening its own tariffs against some of America's products so a lot of American exporters are very unhappy so today I guess Mexico has announced that it will put its own tariffs on products including pork bellies grapes apples and flat steel which sounds like some sort of weird dish but in any case Mexico is going to be announcing its own trade barriers none of this is good policy the president has benefited from a booming economy and a lot of that is his own doing a lot of that is Trump's willingness to get rid of regulations a lot of that is Trump's willingness to lower taxes a lot of that is Trump's willingness to allow the market to operate freely engaging in trade wars with some of America's biggest trade partners is not a way to increase the effectiveness of American business it's just it's a counterproductive move I know that the president has this bizarre understanding of tariffs he believes that trade is a zero-sum game and there's always a winner and a loser that is not correct and business is going to suffer because of all of that it's bad policy however on the other side of the ledger I mean we're gonna do some good from bad form there's some bad form here are some good from so the President signed what he called right to try legislation so right to try legislation has been considered by conservatives for many many years basically the FDA it takes enormous quantities of time and money to get FDA approval for a drug one of the reason drugs are so expensive in the United States is you have to run through years of FDA approval process he's before he can bring a drug to market literally millions and millions of dollars it takes to actually get to market well what happens if you're a terminally ill person and you want to try an experimental drug well so far the Democrats have up till now oppose the idea that you should be allowed to try those drugs they say the FDA has to license every product that is used in the United States but what about people who are gonna die anyway why exactly can't they try what they want I mean if they want to try some snake oil and it happens to work for them why shouldn't they be given the option of doing that that's what the right to try legislation was so president from signed that right to try legislation yesterday this is a very good move terminally ill patients the right to try experimental life-saving treatments and some of these treatments are so promising but for many years patients advocates and lawmakers have fought for this fundamental freedom and as I said incredibly they couldn't get it and there were reasons a lot of it was business a lot of it was pharmaceuticals a lot of it was insurance a lot of it was liability I said so you take care of that stuff and that's what we did today I'm proud to keep another promise to the American people as I sign the right to try legislation into law so there's got no press yesterday but is a very very good move by the ax Trump administration again there's good and there's bad - the Trump administration but it's foolish to ignore the good or to ignore the bad right we have to point out whenever any of this stuff is happening also it is worthwhile noting that while the press continue to suggest that President Trump and his administration are replete with people who do not care about human beings this particular piece of legislation is obviously an attempt to alleviate the suffering of an enormous number of people who are who are stuck right who have no choice when it comes to what sort of treatment they wish to see it's also a good argument for libertarianism even in areas that the FDA covers that if somebody wants to try a drug why shouldn't the able they be able to try that drug speaking of people with heart inside the Trump administration Trump actually had a pretty good day yesterday in so far as demonstrating you know a certain amount of heart and compassion inside the Trump administration there is this this was pretty great as he was signing this right to try legislation there's a little kid who apparently I believe has cystic fibrosis is that the case with this kid I can't remember what his condition is but this really cute little kid and he comes to the signing ceremony and he wants to get a hug from Trump and it's really cute and you can see the kid going in for a hug and Trump is busy he doesn't really notice the kid and he keeps going in trying to get a hug and finally they'll see Trump notices it and in Trump leads over he goes with high he's very cute very very cute okay and then that wasn't the only sign of compassion from the Trump administration yesterday Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked at at White House press conference about school shootings and you can see this is not the response of somebody who doesn't care about dead kids and so many people who are anti Trump have suggested I think that as a kid and certainly as a parent there is nothing that could be more terrifying for a kid to go to school and not feel safe so I'm sorry that you feel that way this administration takes it seriously and the school safety commission that the president convened is meeting this week again an official meeting to discuss the best ways forward and how we can do every single thing within our power to protect kids in our schools and to make them feel safe and make their parents feel good about dropping them off so clearly it's the administration filled with heartless cretins you know evil evil people so this is not to say that the Trump administration doesn't do things that I find terrible at times right or or says things that I find gross at times I mean obviously I've been outspoken about all of that and was talking a little bit about the president's response to the Rosanne situation but this this image that is put out by so many folks on the left that the Trump administration is just filled with awful terrible people who don't care about kids is just stupid in a second I'm going to show you the media's response to all of this yesterday because it truly is astonishing first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at

how does the left respond to everything happening inside the Trump administration the only way to express this would be to say in the most vile and despicable possible way so instead of dealing with the the issues with the Trump administration instead of talking about trade policy for example well instead of talking about the right to try legislation well instead of even talking about the stuff that President Trump says instead the left has decided they have to out Trump Trump they have to go lower than low so remember Hillary Clinton said when they go low we go high and it didn't work for her so it seems like the the left community has decided that when Republicans go medium they will go as low as humanly possible case in point the case in point over the last 24 hours is Samantha B so Samantha B as I have said has been in a running gun battle with Trevor Noah and and Amy Schumer and a bunch of other leftist comedians for most unfunny human in the world but I think that she clearly takes the cake err I've always been leaning towards Samantha bee I'll be honest with you in these sweepstakes I've always thought that Samantha bee was the front-runner I always thought that she led by at least a head and it seems that she has drawn fault like she's drawn lengthways and now like Secretariat in the unfunny in the unfunny horse race here she is yesterday going after a vodka Trump Ivanka Trump you'll recall had the temerity the audacity to tweet out a picture of herself and one of her children over the weekend because it was Memorial Day weekend and the left said how dare she take a picture with her kid because there are people being separated from their kids on the border right now now as we discussed earlier this week this critique makes no sense whatsoever like no sense but that didn't stop Samantha bee so Samantha bee says that not only is Ivanka wrong take that picture she is a bleep Ivanka Trump who works at the White House chose to post the second-most oblivious tweet we've seen this week you know if I go that's a beautiful photo of you and your child but let me just say one mother to another do something about your dad's immigration practices you feckless so much bravery so much class so much decency this is how you got Trump this is how you got Trump so in a second I'm gonna discuss more on how the left got Trump okay so Samantha bee obviously is I mean I won't use the language that you use is here but she's a very bad person let's just say that she's a very bad person what Ivanka Trump taking a picture with her baby has to do with being called a feckless c-word is beyond me and how amantha be keeps her job after that is beyond me as well it seems to me that there's certain language that is so outside the bounds of normal discourse that you can get fired for it like Roseanne calling Valerie Jared and ape it seems to me like that was a fireable offense and it seems to me like samantha be calling a banca Trump a feckless c-word for no reason other than she is in Trump's orbit and has a child is insane it is insane and then to go she goes on from there obviously to suggest that that Trump wants to have sex with his own daughter and therefore if Ivanka wear something tight fit that she can change him aggression policy the rage of the left the utter insane response of the left to everything that Trump does is driving more people into president Trump's arms like Trump may not have to actually do anything to win reelection if the left continues to pursue this sort of nonsense this sort of vile nonsense as another example Mikayla Angela Davis is a is a race commentator on C on MSNBC and she says that in response to the whole Roseanne thing she says all Trump voters are racist like all of them is actually on CNN tens of millions of people voted for him after he showed his cards for years where you said we are you suggesting that they're racist or they're yes yeah the people who vote all the people who voted for Donald Trump yes they may not they may not be violently racist they main be he's targeted he's very clear and strategic look anti-blackness is a strategy that has been the foundation of part of the American process project so it's not just that Trump is racist so that every single person who supports him is racist so here's what we've learned from the left media in the last 24 hours if vodka Trump is a feckless c-word and we have learned that if you voted for President Trump even if you decried some of the things that he was saying this makes you a racist and then they wonder why so many people are rushing to the arms of President Trump they're wondering why that's happening they're wondering why people don't respect the media here's another example of media malfeasance yesterday and they're wondering why people don't take the media seriously here's a here's one of the CNN reporters going off on President Trump for hosting a White House sports and fitness day okay this is a thing that virtually every president has held the this White House sports and fitness day like I remember Obama holding them but now you're gonna hear a commentator suggest that Trump shouldn't hold it because he's bad the president is having this event here at the White House today highlighting health and fitness well questions are being raised about the president's own health and fitness as you'll recall back in January the president's doctor came out to the briefing room and while he told reporters he believed the president was in good health he did say that he was 63 and 239 pounds and had set a weight loss goal of 10 to 15 pounds over the coming year so questions are how he was going to do that through diet and exercise a great deal of irony here today John is the president is holding this event these questions about his own weight loss battle that are still going on in the White House so much journalism in Wow I mean that's that is some serious journalism in right here but she was surpassed by Jim Acosta the White House reporter over at CNN who legitimately is an awful awful reporter I mean Jim Acosta is a guy who believes he is Sam Donaldson and is more like Sam the Eagle from from the Muppets he's just not good at this here's Jim Acosta at the White House complaining about Sarah Huckabee Sanders because Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a point over the last couple of days her point about Roseanne was you guys were very very upset about Rosie and you were happy for her to be fired and maybe she should have been fired but you don't seem quite as happy to talk about joy Reid for example which is obviously true CNN Jim Acosta he got very angry that's because he has to stand up for the reputation of the media okay when the media starts standing for the media and they're no longer standing for the truth it turns out that most consume them out Jim Acosta is the reason most Americans are starting to tune out the media here's here's a cost of going after Huckabee Sanders for saying something that is obviously true it's a bit much I think for the White House press secretary from the podium to come out here and try to shame the media and say it's somehow our fault that Roseanne Barr put out this tweet well that's not exactly what Huckabee Sanders said that's bad news coverage by Jim Acosta chin says the media's fault that Roseanne Barr put out the tweet she said it's the media's fault that there's this double standard where joy Reid gets to keep her job but Roseanne Barr loses her job and Droid gets to keep her job because she is on the left and Roseanne loses her job because she was proton which is perfectly obvious media malfeasance media nastiness this is how you got Trump in this how you're gonna get more Trump so by all means continue to do this by all means continue to think you can out nasty President Trump there is no one on earth who can out now see the President of the United States it ain't gonna work it just is not going to work and it's also one of the reasons why there's such joy dan Freud when it comes to the Obama administration being ousted because they were quietly nasty they're quietly sliding in the knife into so many Americans and in Trump is just a hammer so he's just obviously out there with Thor's hammer hitting people in a second I want to talk a little bit about the show I didn't read that that obviously comes from from President Obama having lost because there's an amazing story in The New York Times and a piece of audio I just have to play for you that's incredible but first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at expressvpn so there's been a lot of noise about social media companies that have been letting third parties get your user data but the truth is that internet providers Verizon Time Warner they can record a list of every website you visit and they can legally give it to anyone the Internet is basically the Wild West and if you think people aren't mining your data you are wrong which is why it's time to stop trusting big corporations with your data and instead start protecting with expressvpn with expressvpn you can privately and securely surf the internet without

laptop smartphone tablet it protects me while I'm browsing streaming downloading files or emailing so I don't have to worry about third party eyes on all of these stuff that I am doing on the internet which is good for political people like me because the fact is that I don't want people knowing what I'm thinking about politics until I say it right here on the show I don't want people digging through my emails I don't think you want that either that's why expressvpn is necessary using expressvpn you can safely serve public Wi-Fi hotspots in Starbucks so you're just using somebody else's

slash Ben okay so and one of the things that's been I think really delicious to watch is the left had this perception of itself as beyond sort of beyond decent the the right was indecent and the left was so decent and the left was so good and the left was so kind and they just cannot understand how President Trump won and it's their lack of understanding as to why President Trump won that basically guarantees that we'll have a serious shot at re-election in 2020 despite his extraordinarily low approval ratings the left doesn't understand how he won and they don't understand how we won because they don't understand themselves one of the ways that you change your own life just speaking personally one of the ways that you change your own life is looking at your own flaws and then determining how to fix those flaws so you know for me I've had to try to get beyond my own confirmation bias it's a difficult thing to do to try and look at the stuff that you want to believe and determine whether you are right in believing those things and for people like me you know sometimes I get condescending I got to work on that right there are certain things about me as a human being that I have to try to work on well the same thing is true of parties parties have to look internally and say what is it that we have to work on the Democrats never felt they had to work on anything because they had made basically Trump's case against the Democrats they'd made against Republicans for years the case that Trump makes against the Democrats that they're all bad and they don't and they like ms-13 and they're mean they're cruel and they're nasty and they're stupid and all this kind of stuff that's just turnabout is fair play the Democrats have been claiming this for years in 2013 I wrote a book called bullies New York Times bestseller talking specifically about this character tactic that has been used by Democrats for years well Trump won suddenly it dawned on the Democrats or it should have done on the Democrats but maybe they shouldn't have been so quick about dismissing half the American public maybe they shouldn't have been so quick about assuming that they were the bringers of light and truth and that everyone who disagreed with them was ill motivated and so there's something delicious about watching members of the the Obama administration trying to cope with the fact that Hillary Clinton lost an election to Donald Trump which is again that was nearly impossible miraculous occurrence this video this audio of Ben Rhodes the former national security adviser to President Obama is just delicious this is video of Ben Rhodes as he is realizing this from a documentary he's just realizing the president Trump has won the presidency and it is astonishingly glorious I came outside to try to process all this so ought to watch process I mean I can't even I can I mean I can okay I can't I can't put it into words I I don't know what it would take the heart of stone not to laugh at that it's so amazing so ben rhoades just a garbage heap or I think Ben Rhodes is the architect of the Iran deal he openly bragged about lying for the American people and there he is I can't understand why the American public rejected the Obama legacy why God why and then just the the incapacity to speak by a former novelist from his Brooklyn apartment elevated to a position of unprecedented power for a guy who knows nothing about anything it's just wonderful that's not the only wonderful thing the fact that the Democrats don't understand this is why they have a serious shot at continuing to lose it's one of the reasons why the generic ballot gap between Republicans and Democrats is now shrunk to near nothingness there's a piece in The New York Times that is that is from a that is from a report by Peter Baker about the emotional stages of adjusting to president Trump's victory and it is just wonderful here's what it says riding in a motorcycle in Lima Peru shortly after the 2016 election President Barack Obama was struggling to understand Donald J Trump's victory what if we were wrong he asked aides riding with him in the armored presidential limousine he had read a column asserting the liberals had forgotten how important identity was to people and had promoted an empty cosmopolitan globalism that made many people feel left behind maybe we push too far mr. Obama said maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe his aides reassured him that he still would have wanted he'd been able to run for another term and the next generation had more in common with him than with mr. Trump mr. Obama the first black man elected president did not seem convinced sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early he said this is why you fail this is why you fail I love that the level of introspection is not about him not about his administration it's about the evils of the American public so the same American public that elected him overwhelmingly twice suddenly was evil but had nothing with him it was them they were the bad people he was just too early don't you understand we were given a gift by President Obama President Obama he was the gift right it was just like bleep in a box right he just unwrapped himself and there he was it was fantastic President Obama came along and we should have all just been grateful for his very presence in front of he was his own gift he was God's gift which means President Obama's own gift to the people he was his own son presenting himself to us to die on the cross for our sins this was Barack Obama this was the man and then what what I love about this so much is that that line where he says maybe we pushed too far maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe Obama was a tribalist president President Obama had the opportunity after his election in 2008 to bring Americans together particularly on issues of race he failed to do it not only did he fail to do it he deliberately decided not to do it and instead to focus on tribal izing people bipolar patterns right by trying to move people back into their tribes so he could then agglomerate them all together wrap him into a ball and in this Democratic ball that was going to roll downhill and crush Republicans that was his entire electoral strategy and he still doesn't get it but it's really delicious to watch him not getting it he was out of touch President Obama and so were the Democrats which is why they lost in the weeks after mr. Trump's election the new york times continues mr. obama went through multiple emotional stages according to a new book by his longtime advisor Benjamin Rhodes right that was the same guy you watched there trying to struggle with the idea that Trump had one and it was wonderful just delicious at times the departing president took the long view at other points he flashed anger he called mr. Trump a cartoon figure who cared more about his crowd sizes than any particular policy okay that is true it is also true that Barack Obama cared a lot more about his crowd sizes than any particular policy which is why he went around Europe immediately after his election speaking to throngs of people and saying nearly nothing of substance he expressed rare self-doubt wondering whether he had misjudged his own influence on American history set to be published next week by Random House mr. Rosas memoir the world as it is by the way the fact that that Ben Rhodes called his memoir the world as it is is just unbelievable Ben Rhodes is a guy who legitimately believed that Iran was going to moderate if we gave them hundreds of billions of dollars and then he's writing a book called the world as it is but don't worry they're not out of touch not out of touch at all but apparently his book offers a peek into mr. Obama's tightly sealed inner sanctum from the perspective of one of the few people who saw him up close through all eight years of his presidency few moments shook mr. Obama more than the decision by voters to replace him with a candidate who has questioned his very birth I I love even the wording is just so good it's just so good mr. Rhodes as mr. Obama's deputy national security adviser through some of the most consequential points of his presidency including decisions to authorize the raid that killed Osama bin Laden I love by the way the Democrats are still hanging their hat on that one every president would have said go do it Jimmy Carter would have said go do it send more troops to Afghanistan pull most troops out of Iraq restore diplomatic relations with Cuba steal a nuclear agreement with Iran intervene militarily in Libya and refused to intervene militarily in Syria but his book offers a new window if only slightly cracked open into the 44th President handling of Russia's intervention in the 2016 election to help mr. Trump get elected and the aftermath in handing over power to someone determined to tear down all he had accomplished mr. Obama alluded to the Godfather movie mafia movie I feel like Michael Corleone I almost got out yes in his own mind I'll Obama's such a tragic figure in his own mind in his own mind he was just he was the man he was the he was the christ-like figure coming to save America and then we crucified him on the cross of Trump oh it feels good I gotta say it did like I didn't vote for Trump but just for that try didn't Freud sort of wish I had I mean like that that's and I understand listen I understand the temptation the the we Sally left his chair his mug right like I get it I got the temptation and doesn't mean that President Trump does everything right but the fact that Barack Obama was so deeply out of touch and that he didn't understand the American people and that he really believed that by polarizing the American people he could bring us all together again and then he felt the impact of President Trump following him is just great and well-deserved and certainly well-deserved for Ben Rhodes as well there's more to this story and I just have to savor every moment of it but first go over to Daley wire.com and subscribe for $9.99 a month you get the rest of this show live you get the rest of Michael Klim Knowles's show live you get the wrench to mandrel clavin's show live you also if you get the annual subscription gets to be part of the mailbag which we'll be doing it tomorrow and you get this the leftist you're as hot or cold tumblr for 99 dollars a year you get all of those things that is cheaper than the monthly subscription plus just once a you need to go over to YouTube and iTunes to subscribe to the show one of the reasons you need to do that is because we have fantastic interview shows every Sunday we have our Sundays special and upcoming on our Sunday special the incredible and hilarious Joe Rogan hey I'm Joe Rogan and tune in this Sunday to the Ben Shapiro Sunday special the Ben Shapiro Sunday special I don't even know what it's called but I do enjoy talking to Ben I love this guy communicating with him I think he's a brilliant person and we talked about a lot of cool so enjoy or not it's a Jo would be stopping by on Sunday I saw him yesterday it was a real blast and he will talk about Roseanne we'll get into all the topics of the day so go subscribe over at YouTube over at iTunes you're really going to enjoy it I think it's it's it's a real kick Jozy kick in the pants he's hilarious so check that out we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation okay so this is New York Times piece it just continues his so long and so glorious on election night mr. Obama spoke by telephone with Cody Keenan his chief speechwriter and mr. Rhodes to figure out what he should say mr. Rhodes asked if he should offer reassurance to allies nope I don't think I'm the one to tell them that the president said because of course Obama wouldn't actually say that our allies would be okay Obama by the way wasn't even friendly with our allies now it comes to Israel and Britain he was certainly not friendly the next day mr. Obama focused on shoring up his despondent staff at one point he sent a message to mr. Rhodes saying there are more stars in the sky than grains of sands on the earth really that's something that he said to Ben Rhodes Barack Obama there are more stars in the sky than grains of salmon on the earth you have got to be kidding me you've got to be kidding me he didn't interview with glozell he did another interview with pimp with a limp there are pictures of him with a selfie stick in the Oval Office there are more stars in the sky than grains of sand and there's what a pretentious douchebag days later Obama seemed less sanguine he said I don't know maybe there's what people want I've got the economy set up well for him no facts no consequences they can just have a car trip Obama was his own sort of cartoon the fact that people couldn't find humor in Obama is just beyond me you know yesterday we talked about Trevor Noah saying that Obama was not inherently humorous are you kidding me this is a dude who sends text messages to people that say things like there are more stars in the sky than grains of sand on the earth thanks Confucius like what in that there is no humor in him he added we're about to find out just how resilient our institutions are at home and around the world the day mr. Obama hosted mr. Trump at the White House after the election seemed surreal mr. Trump kept stirring the conversation back to the size noting that he and mr. Obama could draw big crowds but mrs. Clinton could not mr. Rhodes writes yes yes it's so great okay just I said right after the election there was one picture that really got me right after the election was a picture of Donald Trump visiting the White House sitting next to Barack Obama and you recall that Barack Obama had said on national television that Trump would never be president in a series of mean tweets with Jimmy Kimmel and there is Obama looking like he wants to die and Trump sitting next to him giving the Trump finger to the camera and behind them is a bust of Abraham Lincoln looking down it is just amazing I love that truck because here's the thing as I've said many times Trump is Obama unmasked deep down Obama's ego is Trump's ego all the talk about crowd size Barack Obama did his original DNC acceptance speech in 2008 on a stage with Greek columns and mist coming off the floor in a stadium filled with 40,000 people hey you think Obama didn't care about his crowd sighs dude could not stay off TV the guy wouldn't he we wouldn't miss an all-star game you wouldn't miss in an NCAA bracket challenge right the guy was on TV all the time Trump is just the vulgar version of Obama in terms of personality he's doing I'm not in time in terms of policy here the fact that Obama couldn't see that in himself is again one of the reasons he was so out of touch he was so out of touch this guy who's like quoting fake Psalms that he makes up himself afterward mr. Obama called a few aides to the Oval Office to ruminate on the encounter I'm trying to play some in American history he said he peddles Bull mr. Rhodes answered that character has always been part of the American story you can see right back to some of the characters in Huckleberry Finn maybe mr. Obama answered that's the best we can hope for oh so sad so sad by the way talking with people who peddle bull Barack Obama was in the Senate for five minutes before he ran for president and he gave the most BS speech at the DNC in 2004 I had heard at that time right the whole we're not red states and boost up more of United States but I just I love that Trump is the bizarro he's like bizarro Superman like Obama sees himself as Superman and Trump is just bizarro Superman where everything he says is kind of backwards and he's just the the weird version of Obama like when Obama looks in a funhouse mirror he's gotta see Trump and it must haunts his nightmares and he deserves every second of that it is so grand and it is so great now speaking of so grand and so great I have to tell you the story because it is so good Joel Stein remember Jill Stein and she was the left's great hope she was the great hope she was going to provide that counter to Hillary Clinton shortly after the 2016 election according to The Daily Beast Joel Stein raised more than 7 million dollars from shell-shocked liberals eager to pursue a swing state recount nearly two years later the US Green Party's last candidate for president is still spending that money ongoing litigation travel costs and staff salaries are also likely eat up whatever is left meaning those who donate Steinar unlikely to receive and once promised chance to vote on how the post recount money would be spent north donors been given much of a window into how Stein is actually spending their donations the last FEC filing from the stein campaign was for the month of September 2017 and the last update from the campaign itself came on a post egg in a post on April 20th in which it said it was down to about a million dollars in recount funds so did they ever actually do any of the recounting nope they spent it all on staff salaries and vacations yep you guys didn't get scammed at all the only scamster in that race was clearly Donald Trump not Jill Stein not Hillary Clinton man sometimes politics is great now speaking of when politics is not great we have to talk about Spygate so the presidents of the United States decided to tweet today because today is a day ending and why so he decided that he was going to tweet about spy gate spy gate as you recall is this allegation that the FBI was at the behest of the Obama administration looking into the looking into the Trump campaign they were targeting the Trump campaign because they wanted to essentially falsify information about collusion between President Trump and the Russians and then use that as a club against him the election cycle now I've always had a few questions about this question number one why exactly wouldn't they release the information if they had it question number two the only people they targeted inside the campaign we're people who basically have been charged at this point they never targeted Trump jr. they never targeted President Trump himself they never targeted Steve Bannon they never targeted a bunch of people who are top members of the Trump campaign it was only manna fort and gates and Papadopoulos and Carter page right all people with serious suspicious histories and then the third question is always the biggest which is if all this really happened why doesn't Trump just declassify it but if the FBI really was going after Trump at the behest of the Obama administration Trump's the president he can you classify this stuff and any time part of the reason that I don't buy this story is because the president tweets things that are sometimes just not true so here's the thing that he tweeted that was just not true today he said the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people spies into my campaign surveillance much okay that's somewhat fair here's the part that's not fair not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true he literally went on Lester Holt show on national television on NBC and said he fired James comb because of Russia he then went into a room with the ambassador to Russia from Russia serega kiss lyac and told him that he fired james comey because of russia now i don't think that he fired James coming because come he was about to uncover Russian collusion I think if fired James called me because he was frustrated that Comey was not announcing publicly that he hadn't he didn't have the goods on Trump about Russia but when Trump says he didn't fire James Comey because of Russia he literally said on national television he literally said that on national television the de fire James Comey because of Russia so um no I just I don't buy that by the way speaking of people who don't buy it trey gowdy who it's really funny to me you know tribal tribalism is a hell of a drug and trey Gowdy you will recall was considered one of the staunchest most aggressive Republicans in Congress he's retiring now he was on the the I believe the House Oversight Committee and you remember during the Benghazi hearings whose shellacking the Obama administration over and over and over who's the best prosecutor they had on the Oversight Committee he's a very strong Republican and he said on Fox News that the FBI was not out to get the quote-unquote Trump campaign in the middle of the election cycle here's what he had to say and the backlash was fierce it was President Trump himself who said number one I didn't collude with Russia but if anyone connected with my campaign did I want the FBI to find that out it looks to me like the FBI was doing what President Trump said I want you to do find it out he's not the target so when Schiff and others don't make that clear they're doing a disservice to our fellow citizens I am I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump okay so what he says here is two things one of them is that the FBI was not investigating Donald Trump and the other is that the FBI was not investigating the Trump campaign now there's a case to be made Andrew McCarthy makes it today that the Trump campaign was basically under investigation I don't agree with Andrew McCarthy's case I tend to agree with trey Gowdy but what's happened because trey gowdy said something you are not allowed to say now which is that President Trump is over blowing this case a lot of folks have been all over trey Gowdy Sean Hannity for example attacked trey Gowdy on Fox News and suggested that trey Gowdy had now been co-opted for some reason that there's the suggestion being made the trade has been co-opted by the deep state or that trey gowdy is now running interference for democrats and for the FBI again trey Gowdy I believe he might be wrong but to question his motivations here I think is really beyond the pale again when the evidence shows that the FBI was directed by President Obama or even hinted at by President Obama to target the Trump campaign not just people within the Trump campaign the Trump campaign itself when we understand why Trump hasn't Declassified the material when we understand why the FBI didn't release the material then I'm happy to go with the Spygate stuff until then I'm gonna have to withhold judgment just as a lawyer I'm gonna have to withhold judgment and I don't know what's wrong with that I think withholding judgment might be the best thing you can do when the evidence is not yet out okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things I like I I do enjoy reading about you know the about human psychology and the the natural the natural limitations that human beings have as I said earlier in the show I think it's a very important thing that the I think it's a very important thing that the be that human beings they want to change actually spend some time looking into their own limitations well there's a great book by Paul bloom psychologist I believe it at Yale University it's called just babies the origins of good and evil and it basically explains that human beings are not blank slates right we are born with a bunch of inherent limitations that we have to work to overcome these limitations do include discrimination and violence they do include cognitive biases and it's important for everybody to know about these things so that you and your own life can overcome them and so you can educate your children better to overcome them again the book is called just babies the origin of good and evil it's like it's a it's a short book and a very easy read it's it's really fun to read as well it'll give you some information that puts to death the lie that the left is told for literally generations that human beings are infinitely malleable if only we change our social constructs the the idea that that boys can become girls and girls can become boys an outgrowth of the idea that the human brain is intensely plastic so plastic that it has no actual features that's not true it never was true in human history it has not been true and Paul bloom sort of puts that to bed and just maybes the origins of good and evil okay time for some things that I hate so yesterday as I mentioned President Trump met Kim Kardashian in the Oval Office and I questioned whether this was a worthwhile thing to do because I think that linking yourself with celebrities is generally a waste of time and counterproductive I don't think celebrities generally have important things to say on topics outside of their purview that's not to say they can't raise money for charity it's not to say that they can't have their causes but I don't know why politicians should take the word of celebrities as more important than anybody else so if Trump wants to talk prison reform and sentencing it seems to me that he in and he thinks that Kim Kardashian is somebody he should talk to and seems to me that he should talk to Kim Kardashian have Kim Kardashian recommend an actual expert on prison reform and sentencing have that person come into the White House and then they can talk about it but these whole photo-op nonsense which is not it didn't start with Trump obviously Obama used to do it all the time it is nonsense now of course what's ironic about all of this is that speaking of philosophical consistency a bunch of people on the right will say no no it's good Kim Kardashian coming in it's great because she's trying to do the right thing again I'm not questioning Kim Kardashian's motives I'm questioning the the usefulness and the and whether it is good for the country to have politicians doing these photo ops with celebrities as though the celebrities know what the hell they are talking about in many of these cases and I remember that there was a guy named Donald Trump who used to be a sort of upset about this kind of stuff right Trump used to rip Hillary Clinton over her associations with jay-z for example why she filled up the arena was to get jay-z and his language was so filthy that it made me like the most clean-cut human being on earth okay that's a fair criticism but then you can't go around talking about why like Kanye should come to the White House like just the hypocrisy is a little bit much for me I have a consistent stand on this I do not think celebrities know things as a general rule if they do know things one thing if Trump wants to be friends with people that's fine but the photo ops the attempt to use celebrity as a method of power maintenance in American politics I hated it when Obama did I hated it when Hillary Clinton did it I don't like it when President Trump does it I just I'm as consistent as can be on this and I can't say the same about a lot of other people on the right who just said well you know as long as it's Trump doing it it's totally fine but getting kind of used to that after all these years okay time for a quick quick Bible verse so we've been going chapter by chapter through the books following the five books of Moses and this is from the chapter 3 of the book of Joshua so Joshua is about to invade the land and it says early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelite set out from she team and went to the Jordan where they camped before crossing over after three days the officers went throughout the camp giving orders to the people when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and a Levitical priests carrying it you ought to move out from your positions and follow it then you will know which way to go since you have never been this way before but keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between you and the Ark do not go near it Joshua told the people consecrate yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you it's that verse that I want to talk about a little bit and the idea that you have to consecrate yourselves because tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you if you were told today that God was going to do something amazing for you would you go out and consecrate yourself or would you think well listen it's already guaranteed right the rewards already guaranteed so would I go out and consecrate myself when I go out clean myself make sure that I'm as clean as can be or would I just rely on the mercy of the Lord it's my feeling that this verse has some serious importance because the idea is not that you're trying to buy off God to do things for you and religion is not about buying off God to do things for you God is not a gumball machine what God is is is a being that is infinitely kind and merciful and in gratitude for that we have to constantly be in the process of consecrating ourselves God's gonna do what he's going to do and I'm not I don't believe that you earn points with God in this life simply by doing good things I don't think it's you do good things and then God is nice to you again God is not your your candy machine but it is your job to be grateful for the things that God does give you including a predictable universe in which if you apply the rules then good things happen to you it is our job to consecrate ourselves and not to worry about what God is going to do for us because what God is going to do for us has almost no like if people are not consecrated themselves according to Joshua God still would've done the great thing it is our job to be grateful for those great things and therefore to spend our time making ourselves more virtuous human beings okay we'll be back here tomorrow with the mailbag i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced
