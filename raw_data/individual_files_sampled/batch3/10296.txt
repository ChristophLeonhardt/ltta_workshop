can it can you describe to us your impressions of the state of the country well I've been in Libya for the last three days and what you can see is that certain parts of the country are of course quieter today then maybe one or two years ago others as it has been mentioned are still fighting is continuing and the impact on civilian population is important is heavy Libya is one of those countries with the largest percentage of displaced populations and therefore the humanitarian needs are important in particular in health services water economic support for displaced populations Peter what kind of information has the ICRC received from cert considering that it has faced some of the heaviest fighting recently we have in ourselves been insert our colleagues from the Libyan Red Crescent Society have been there we certainly recognize as I've mentioned before that insert and in other parts of Libya fighting is continuing and therefore needs are enormous because of the disruption of basic social services health water sanitation and others and so the needs are certainly growing and ICRC and the Red Cross movement as a whole is ready to do more in Libya to respond to those places who are particularly suffering Peter you've obviously mentioned that you know humanitarian crisis which you know we've been covering as well and you've mentioned what could be done but how how realistic that it's an you know what you're doing what your organization is doing is enough because there is a huge crisis and those residents are trying to get to normality but it appears at the moment that they might not be able to well of course Libya is a country affected by war and violence displacements and there is a humanitarian crisis but Libya is also a rich country Libya is also a country with a lot of capable people and I think with more support from the outside these people will manage to respond more meaningfully to the crisis our impression is definitely that with a little bit more of support a lot can be done and the Libyans know themselves as well how to respond to this crisis on the other hand it is true they need more support in some of the critical area we did obviously mentioning more support if we look at how the the media is covering certain conflicts in the world Libya seems to have gone off the radar a bit and overshadowed by by Yemen Syria Iraq how important in your opinion is to keep that coverage about Libya going and how do you think more attention can be attracted to the crisis and the devastation in the country we are certainly of the opinion that it is important to talk about the situation in Libya we are of the opinion that more needs to be done to support the different authorities in Libya more of course has to be done also to find a political solution within Libya Libya is strategically situated everybody knows it's a country of destination and transit of migration we find appalling situations not only for the Libyan population but also for the migrant population in Libya so there is for me an unquestioned necessity to put Libya much more in the center also of international attention comparable to the attention the international community has on other crises in the Middle East yeah yeah I mean we seem to be seeing a lot of crises across that region as well now you know for those who you know aren't humanitarian workers it would be an insight I think to for you to describe what the biggest challenges are for those humanitarian workers who are on the ground dealing with these huge problems that they're faced with well there are a couple of areas which emerge as a particularly critical at the present moment I have mentioned health services clinics which need to be rehabilitated water systems which need to be rehabilitated I have mentioned the displaced population which needs basic support to restart their lives we also need to engage with all parties to the Libyan conflict to respect international humanitarian law this is the basic mandate of the ICRC and you know in through this engagement also to ensure that there is less negative impact on the civilian populations who are often trapped in between the different frontlines we need to cope as you mentioned in your questions with those hot areas in Libya which are at the present moment at the forefront of the attention like cert like there now like other places where fighting is taking place and the population is suffering these are just some of the important issue I wouldn't forget the medium and long term important issues like visiting detention facilities which is important the ICRC detention facilities for Libyans but as well as for migrants these are all important subjects and the areas to cover yeah I mean Peter if we look you've mentioned the short term if we look at the long term and restoration of the country to get to a point where there is peace for the population there how long realistically do you think that's going to take take and and how much in terms of resources that are going to take and if you could quickly answer that question because we're running out of time now yeah well again I think Libya has some assets which we shouldn't forget and which give us hope it's a population which knows how to help themselves I think they have resources they have capacities we need to strengthen those capacities I think there is a realistic perspective that once there is a political agreement in Libya things will become better ok president of the International Committee of the Red Cross Peter Morra thank you so much for coming on to the program and giving us your thoughts on the situation in Libya
