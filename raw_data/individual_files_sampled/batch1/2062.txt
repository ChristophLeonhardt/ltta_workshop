it was a face-to-face meeting it was a long wait it was two hours and 15 minutes everyone was surprised by the amount of time but it was a good thing not a bad thing - yeah I think we got along very well and I think that's a good thing that's not a bad thing yeah you know people said oh they shouldn't get along well who would the people that are saying that I think we got along very very well we're a tremendously powerful nuclear power and so are they not sure it doesn't make sense not to have some kind of a relationship it's something you don't even like talking about but again we're the most powerful country in the world and we are getting more and more powerful because I'm a big military person as an example if Hillary had won our military would be decimated our energy would be much more expensive that's what Putin doesn't like about me and that's why I say why would he want me because from day one I wanted a strong military he doesn't want to say that and from day one I want fracking and everything else to get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy we're going to be self-supporting we just about are now we're going to be exporting energy he doesn't want that he would like Hillary where she wants to have windmills you know he would much rather have that because energy prices will go up and Russia as you know realize where and what your energy there are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want so when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump I think probably not because when I want a strong military you know she wouldn't have spent the money on the military but when I want a strong military when I want tremendous energy we're opening up coal we're opening up natural gas we're opening up fracking all the things that he would hate but nobody ever mentions you
