turn now to the deadly school shooting in Texas a moment of silence will be held today there for the victims of Friday's mass shooting at Santa Fe High School 10 people eight students and two teachers were killed when a 17 year old student and suspected gunman is alleged to have opened fire 13 others were injured joining us now from Santa Fe High School in Texas MSNBC correspondent Mariana Atencio Mariana what is the latest Mieke the latest is that the 17 year old gunman Demetrius pige or T's is facing charges of capital murder and aggravated assault against a public servant he's being held without bond and authorities aren't really giving a motive but we do know from the affidavit that he targeted those students he disliked and he spared those that he liked so they would give a positive account of who he was after the shooting the names of those 10 people whose lives were lost was released over the weekend students like Sabae Kashyyyk a 17 year old pakistani exchange student who was counting down the days mica on her snapchat account to be reunited with her family she was the first to be buried yesterday at a mosque in Houston those 10 names being remembered at church services far and wide across the state where we also saw governor Greg Abbott and I asked him you know what comes next from a policy perspective he told me he's going to try to implement a statewide program focused on mental health roundtable discussions for that begin tomorrow but some of the students I have spoken to on the ground especially those who survived say they want to see more than the focus on mental health they are inspired by what they saw in parkland and that they hope that Santa Fe even though it is a small rural community can continue to lead this change we're seeing from young people nationwide Joe and Mika Maryana thank you so much and Joe you know to say that this impacts kids across the country every time it happens there's an understatement I got a text from my daughter last night she sent me a Facebook post by a mother of a child in the school Dedra Van Ness and she entitles it the longest day of my life and she talks about her daughter hiding in the closet and calling home as the shooter was basically killing people in the classroom right behind the door that she was hiding behind and she came home covered in blood a student in the closet was killed it is it's hard to talk about but it has to be we have to get our arms around this we really do and and that's for people who support gun control and for people who don't support gun control John Heilemann this is such a they're all difficult because it never seems to be a quick fix a gun you can ban or certain steps that you can take this wasn't Las Vegas you can't talk about bump stocks you can't talk about ar-15 you can't talk about military-style weapons this this wasn't parkland you didn't have somebody just shooting and then reloading you had guns that were legally purchased a kid who was underaged so he couldn't have purchased any guns if he had wanted to he used his dad's shotgun and he used thirty-eight I believe it wasn't like he was shooting and then reloading shooting and then reloading shooting and then reloading and so there are there are so many of these tragedies where people run to their corners here it seems you know people from like Chris Murphy it would be great for people like Chris Murphy to sit down with Governor Abbott and say okay this happened in Newtown to me it's happened to you now what do we do where do we come together because as part of this unfortunately can't be legislated away certainly not in this case we're not taking away shotguns we're not taking away 38 so there are some opportunities to try to find some common ground and not divided along ideological lines here but my god the tragedies do keep coming yes and you know look the the its original hopeful notion that we could find some common ground on this and there's literally no evidence whatsoever in all of these diverse cases that have had the same kind of tragic outcome there's no evidence that we can find common ground there's been no sign of it on almost any instance and I don't mean to laugh about it but to me the most powerful thing about this and I'm it's the least you the least kind of a unique insight I can offer here is that I think this straw was struck everyone about this was hearing from some of these kids in the school in Texas who basically said we expected this to happen here and and if there's if there's gonna be any kind of progress on this and any kind of solution of these problems and they are not all the same problem but they are they do have a commonality to them which relates to gun violence if there's gonna be a change it's gonna have to start at some kind of basic cultural level not on the questions of specific kind of policies there's gonna have to be some kind of a moment where everyone says look this can't go on we can't have kids who go to school in this in cities and states across the country who have an expectation that they are gonna get shot in school that they're not surprised when I stop ins in their school and if we can all acknowledge at least that that is horrific maybe that's the starting point I don't know where it goes from there but maybe that is the kind of ground zero for this that become a basic emotional cultural level well and and a you know a common ground that so many of us have our children that go to school and I know all of us want to keep our children safe in school and Nick I talked about how there there weren't the you know the horrific sites of you know military-style weapons being loaded and reloaded and reloaded and reloaded they here you had a shotgun and a handgun so that didn't fit neatly into anybody's talking points and not a lot we're gonna do on that front but also on the I know the governor is talking about mental health counseling my god I we I don't think we can spend enough in that area and yet unlike parkland who would have dragged this kid out of the lineup he I think he was an honor roll student he played played on the football team will worked hard he was he was working towards being in some AP classes not a lot of people would have he wasn't like Cruz at Parkland he was just a quiet kid you know Joe I'm struck by the rapport in the Los Angeles Times over the weekend that the shooter had you know admit advances on a teenage girl and rebuffed her and came back and killed her and and and and his classmates and you know sadly I looked to a future for my own kids of hardened schools and safety drills and knowing which part of the classroom is the safe place to be in a shooting situation but I think that the common ingredients here Joe and and the common ingredients in many of these cases are an angry and troubled boy who has access to guns and it points to something a little deeper in our culture that this young man felt that he had some entitlement to the attentions of this woman that he felt the only way to you know kind of resolve his entitlement his frustration his anger was to kill her and kill his friends his classmates and that is a problem that can't be solved by the government I don't think it is a cultural problem in this country and probably around the world when kids are telling us they know they're next we're doing something wrong this is the bottom line still I had a morning gel human sources in particular who put themselves at great risk to work with us and with our foreign partners have to be able to trust that we're going to protect their identities and in many cases their lives and lives of their families the day that we can't protect human sources is the day the American people start becoming less safe our next guest says the men we just heard they're FBI director Chris Ray would likely resign before carrying out an order from the president that undermined his department Benjamin with us from the blog lawfare has much more to say on that and he joins us straight ahead and thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's
