this is the floating sea horse it's a floating home that's got three levels but by far the coolest the master bedroom which is totally submerged underwater it's being launched by a divided based developer and it doesn't have any propulsion so not the best if you want to travel but it's perfect if you love to lounge it's got a fully functioning kitchen dining room and living space he's also got a deck so you can work on your tan a wooden staircase leads to the master bedroom on the lower level if you're parked near a reef expect to see hundreds of fish you can also take a bath and relax with the ocean all around you while it was being built developers were also collecting coral from construction areas near the burj al arab hotel in dubai they're relocating that coral to an area that will house some of the floating homes we are having around 2000 big coral sea vailable and we are building a nursery for around 100,000 corals each one of the homes is about 3,100 square feet ten of them are available for purchase for about 2.7 million apiece but if that's not enough you can pay around 3 million and get 4,000 square feet
