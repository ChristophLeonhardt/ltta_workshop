1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,259
THE FBI IS CURRENTLY LOOKING
TO BUILD A NEW HEADQUARTERS AND

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,470
CAMPUS IN DC.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,820
THE FBI IS
GIGANTIC, IT HAS THOUSANDS OF

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,269
EMPLOYEES, SO THIS IS A BIG
DEVELOPMENT.

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,389
IT'S EXPECTED THAT

6
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:16,850
IT WILL BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
BUILDING RELATED GOVERNMENT

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,810
CONTRACTS IN U.S. HISTORY,
ESTIMATED TO START OFF WITH A

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,609
PRICE TAG OF $2 BILLION.

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,090
WE KNOW
HOW THESE THINGS WORK OUT, NOT

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,420
TO MENTION OF COURSE RUNNING THE
THING.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,679
AND THE CONTRACTOR WHO IS

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,940
GOING TO BUILD THE NEW ONE GETS
TO CONTROL THE PREVIOUS ONE,

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,320
WHICH IS AN AMAZINGLY VALUABLE
PIECE OF REAL ESTATE.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
SO WHO

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,690
GETS THIS CONTRACT IS INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT, VERY LUCRATIVE.

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,690
SO

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,690
LET'S CHECK IN ON WHO MIGHT GET
THIS.

18
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,930
HERE IS A SURPRISE FOR YOU

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,930
--

20
00:00:46,930 --> 00:01:03,799
>>YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM IN
THE NEWS RECENTLY --

21
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,840
>>-- A COUNCIL FROM WHICH WE
HAVE SO MANY DETAILS --

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:18,950
>>I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE,
BUT HE MIGHT SOON BE ONE OF THE

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,460
RICHEST BUILDERS IN AMERICA IF
DONALD TRUMP, WHOSE

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,070
ADMINISTRATION WILL BE MAKING
THIS CHOICE, DECIDES TO GO

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,070
WITH HIM.

26
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,320
>>IS THERE ANY PRESIDENT MORE
DESERVING OF OVERSEEING THE

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,320
GROUNDBREAKING OF A NEW FBI
HEADQUARTERS THAN DONALD TRUMP?

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,060
I CAN'T THINK OF WHO THAT WOULD
BE.

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,250
STEVEN ROTH, ALREADY ONE OF

30
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:48,700
THE RICHEST BUILDERS IN AMERICA.

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,640
THE ETHICS WATCHDOGS HAVE SEEN

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,720
THERE IS NO CHANCE THIS WOULD
PASS ANY KIND OF MUSTER, HAVING

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,000
ROTH WIN THIS BID.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,630
OF COURSE HE
WILL WIN IT, BUT YOU'D THINK THE

35
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,530
PRESIDENT WOULD NOT WANT TO RUN
UP AGAINST CONGRESS AGAIN ON

36
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,030
SOMETHING AS BALD-FACED AS THIS.

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,620
>>I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WOULD
BE A RUN-UP.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,530
>>I DON'T KNOW THAT HE WOULD GET
PUSHBACK.

39
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,100
>>YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU CAN'T KNOW
THAT HE WOULD GET PUSHBACK, BUT

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,550
THESE THINGS HAVE A CUMULATIVE
EFFECT.

41
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,980
THEY HAD THEM ON NIXON

42
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,620
IN A MALIGNANT WAY, AND ON
CARTER IN A BENIGN WAY.

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,620
IF YOU

44
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,060
KEEP PRESENTING CONGRESS WITH
THINGS THAT THEY ARE AGAINST AND

45
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,390
YOU GET PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN PARTY
AGAINST THEM, YOU GET IN

46
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,390
TROUBLE.

47
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,750
THAT PROBABLY WON'T
HAPPEN WITH STEVE ROTH AND

48
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:58,950
VORNADO, BUT EVENTUALLY IT
BECOMES LIKE A JENGA PILE.

49
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,950
IT'S

50
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,950
PROBLEMATIC.

51
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,950
AND OBVIOUSLY THEY
DON'T CARE, THEY ARE THERE TO

52
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,819
GET THEIR CRONIES WEALTHY.

53
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,490
WEALTHIER.

54
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:13,620
>>WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE
POSSIBLE $800 BILLION THAT WILL

55
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,070
BE JUST GIVEN OUT TO THESE
CONTRACTORS, THAT'S A MUCH

56
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,980
LARGER SUM OF MONEY, BUT THERE
IS SOMETHING PERSONAL ABOUT

57
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
THIS.

58
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,980
HE CAN SIMPLY SAY, MY
BUDDY GETS THIS.

59
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,150
AND I THINK FOR

60
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,340
A LOT OF AMERICANS THAT WILL BE
MORE CLEARLY CORRUPT.

61
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
EVERYONE

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,030
GETS WHEN YOUR FRIEND GETS $2
BILLION -- NOT THAT WE HAVE THE

63
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,950
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, BUT WE
KNOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE RUSSIA OR

64
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,480
TURKEY OR SOME THIRD WORLD
COUNTRY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,560
BE. AND I HOPE A LOT OF
AMERICANS HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
THIS.

67
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,270
>>I WANT TO PLAY OFF OF WHAT YOU
SAID.

68
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,510
WHAT YOU SAID IS SO TRUE,

69
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,430
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON. AND
THAT'S WHAT IS AT THE CENTER OF

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,680
THIS RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION,
PEOPLE THINKING, PERHAPS

71
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,280
RIGHTFULLY -- WE DON'T KNOW YET,
BOB MUELLER WILL HOPEFULLY

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,810
FIGURE THIS OUT -- THAT THE
REASON ALL THIS IS HAPPENING WAS

73
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,460
TO GET HIS CRONIES RICHARD.

74
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,900
HE
WAS GOING TO LIFT THE SANCTIONS,

75
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,850
IN EXCHANGE FOR LIFTING THE
SANCTIONS WEALTHY RUSSIANS WOULD

76
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,250
COME IN AND INVEST, RELAX THE
DEBT THEY HAD, ALL THAT WOULD

77
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,250
HAPPEN.

78
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,550
THIS IS SIMILAR TO THAT,
LET'S GET STEVE ROTH RICH

79
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,820
DISLIKE WE WILL GET X, Y, AND
THE RUSSIAN RICH.

80
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:35,800
>>IT'S TRULY PUTIN-ESQUE, WHAT
JOHN SAID.

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,530
IT'S RUSSIA 2.0.

82
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,050
>>JUST IN CASE YOU THINK SO
THIS GUY WAS ON THE STAGE WITH

83
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,380
HIM, HE CALLED HIM A GREAT
BUILDER, OKAY, HE IS HIS FRIEND

84
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,130
-- I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THE
BUSINESS TIES BETWEEN THESE TWO

85
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,270
AS WE CLOSE OUT THIS STORY --

86
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:59,710
>>-- 

87
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:08,860
IF YOU ARE A CONSPIRACY
THEORIST ONLINE, THE FACT THAT

88
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,699
IT IS 666 HAS TO MAKE YOU SO
TINGLY --

89
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,861
>>IN NEW YORK THERE WAS A CAFâ€¦

90
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,010
ON TOP OF THEIR CALLED TOP OF

91
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,780
THE SIXES, IT WAS A CHEAP WAY TO
GET TO THE TOP OF A BUILDING AND

92
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,030
HAVE A PIECE OF CAKE WITH HER
GRANDMA.

93
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,030
WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

94
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,280
THAT BUILDING BEFORE, HOW JARED
KUSHNER INVESTED A MASSIVE

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,889
AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THAT BUILDING
-- IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE

96
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,930
GREAT RECESSION, BY THE WAY,
WHICH WAS A GREAT CALL --

97
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,710
BUT LOOK HOW CLEAR THE
CONNECTION IS --

98
00:05:43,710 --> 00:06:00,370
>>POTENTIALLY SAVING BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS FOR THE KUSHNERS

99
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,370
THERE.

100
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,620
AND KUSHNER OF COURSE ONE
OF THE CHIEF ADVISERS TO DONALD

101
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,820
TRUMP, SO WHETHER IT IS TRUMP'S
DECISION THAT THIS GUY GETS IT

102
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,960
OR ITS TO PAY OFF THE HELP
THEY'VE GIVEN THE KUSHNERS,

103
00:06:10,960 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S SICK IN EITHER CASE.
