people that I talked to as I was collecting stories for the book would often say we don't marry for love we marry because it's time and they were really referring to this sort of hardwired Confucian idea in Chinese society that everyone should marry have a son continue the family line and care for their parents that those are sort of the big priorities in a person's lifetime however that being said the tempo is changing in China a big study that's done every year in China about people's marital values recently found in 2012 that instead of income being the top predictor of a happy marriage which was the sort of common answer mutual affection popped up and in fact income had dropped to number five there's still this idea in China that if you are financially stable and your life is going okay and you've been married a few years it would be okay to find a woman on the side whether it's a girlfriend or whether you just have other relationships as long as it's a secret and not known at home it's still very common so I think the real question that's kind of coming up on the horizon for China is can we merge all of these things that we want in our lives you know the stable parent someone to care for our own parents someone to share our life with can we merge that with this other side of us that wants like a sexually exciting partner that wants to be in love with someone can they all be the same person and I think that's really the question China is exploring and they're not sure of the answer yet
