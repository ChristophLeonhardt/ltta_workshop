1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,169
Although it may not seem like it, on average,
the world is improving.

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:08,890
Countries are growing their economies and
populations, and working together to build

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,920
a stable global future.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,000
But not everywhere.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,730
In certain pockets of the world, war, chaos,
and and increasingly uncertain political instability

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,610
is pushing certain nations straight towards
their eventual failure.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,000
So we wanted to know, which countries are
at the greatest risk of collapse, and why?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,590
Well, to find out, we can use the widely cited
Fragile States Index, published by the non-profit

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,619
think tank, Fund for Peace.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:38,329
Using 12 indicators, covering social, economic,
and political factors, the FSI ranks all United

11
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:53,969
Nations members based on their likelihood
of failing as a sovereign state.

12
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,499
Since 2014, the same three countries have
ranked at the very bottom, and one of them

13
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:01,339
is the long struggling Central African Republic.

14
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:07,330
The CAR, like most war-torn African countries,
is the product of failed colonization by Europe,

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,060
following the 19th century partition of Africa.

16
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,619
After roughly 80 years of French rule, the
CAR declared its independence in 1960, but

17
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:17,720
was far from democratic.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,690
Almost immediately, the government began suppressing
opposition, and was overthrown in a coup d’état.

19
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,770
This new government was best known for establishing
a dictator, who was alleged to have personally

20
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,740
ordered the murder of 100 child protestors.

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,420
Over the next 40 years, a series of coups,
foreign overthrows of government, and false

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,320
attempts at democracy led to multiple civil
wars beginning in 2003.

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,530
For the past decade and a half, the United
Nations and the country’s former colonizer

24
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,509
France have attempted to reach peace between
the country’s many different warring factions,

25
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,260
with little to no success.

26
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,310
Today, the CAR is one of the world’s poorest
countries and according to the UN’s Human

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,509
Development Index, has seen less development
than any other nation on earth.

28
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,490
It has also consistently ranked as one of
the most unhealthy nations, particularly in

29
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,039
terms of hygiene, malaria, sanitation, lack
of medical supplies, and most destructively:

30
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,040
war.

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,160
The country has even seen ethnic cleansing
of its Muslim minority since 2013.

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,290
Without the United Nations actively working
to prevent a total collapse, the Central African

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,170
Republic is the third most likely to fail
country in the world.

34
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,740
The second most unstable country is Somalia,
which has been in the bottom three since 2007.

35
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,800
Another victim of European colonization, this
time by Italy and Britain, Somalia has struggled

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,570
since declaring independence in 1960.

37
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,110
Although somewhat stable due to a dictatorship,
In 1991, the Somali Civil War broke out following

38
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,120
the collapse of the Somali government.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,300
In the past 25 years, the country has been
in an almost nonstop state of war, with religious

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,850
and political factions alternately seizing
territory, and a steady growth of terror groups

41
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,440
such as the al-Qaeda aligned Al-Shabaab.

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,690
The lack of effective government has even
led to pirates attacking ships near the Somali

43
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,690
coast.

44
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,390
Today, much of the country is still relatively
lawless and in extreme poverty, with no real

45
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,890
functioning economy or social services.

46
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,480
But the most likely to collapse country in
the world, is also one of the most recently

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
created.

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,880
South Sudan only became independent in 2011,
but has been engaged in a bloody civil war

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,490
since 2013.

50
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,600
As many as 300,000 people were believed to
have been killed in just two years of fighting,

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,120
with devastating ethnic violence, and more
than one million people displaced.

52
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,820
In one notable massacre, members of particular
ethnic groups and religions were executed

53
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,820
en masse by former pro-government groups,
and local radio stations broadcasted hate

54
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,880
messages, encouraging torture and murder.

55
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,290
Attacks on hospitals, places of worship, and
schools have left the country non-functioning,

56
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,050
and barely held together by UN forces.

57
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,580
These three nations follow a pattern of post-colonial
independence and subsequent fragility.

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,180
They are all marked by ongoing conflict, repeat
government turnover, violent insurgencies,

59
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,680
and extreme poverty.

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,430
With so many interrelated crises happening
at the same time, these countries NEED the

61
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,790
global community’s help, and without it,
they are likely to fail completely.

62
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,310
As one of the most likely to fail states,
Somalia is subject to more terror attacks

63
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,220
than almost any other country.

64
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,880

and it’s current struggle with terrorism,
