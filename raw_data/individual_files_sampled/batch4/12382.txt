I was reading an email earlier this morning from from somebody responding to my show yesterday which was about masculinity and she says that there's too much macho manly stuff going on in the culture and it's it's okay for a man to cry you know to show his feminine side and cry I like a man who cries is what you said and that just got me thinking and I wanted to stipulate this just kind of as a public service announcement at the top and it's not related to anything else we're going to talk about but let me just stipulate thing about crying it is is generally not okay for a man to cry except for in in the following seven situations there are seven situations where a man can cry the first one death of a loved one obviously crying's okay there the second one a major milestone involving your kids like when your kid is born when child graduates that sort of thing the third thing during an intense spiritual experience crying is okay there the fourth of course when you're watching the the final scene of Rudy when when they're chanting for Rudy and he finally comes out he makes them he makes a tackle and the tackle is totally irrelevant because the game's basically over but it's he's been working for his whole life and then everyone's cheering and his dad is there and they carry him off the field you can you can weep over that as a man the the fifth thing if you're kicked in the shins by a horse I think is a good is a fine crying situation the sixth thing if your if your wife makes you a lasagna that is just so good that it brings you to tears that's acceptable seven go to somebody's house and this has happened to me before you go to somebody's house and they say oh we're having chili and you say oh wow this makes my day and then they serve you the bowl of chili but then you discover that the chili is made with ground turkey and black beans then it's it's acceptable actually to throw the the hot bowl of chili at the person who served it to you and cry and that's acceptable not only morally and ethically but also legally I believe that's the the law stipulates that I pretty sure in most states anyway those are the seven times and there are in there are no other times that's it those are the only times when you're allowed to cry as a man
