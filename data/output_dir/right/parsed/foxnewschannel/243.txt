CELEBRITY.
>> Shannon: FUNNY HOW THAT
HAPPENS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
KANYE PRAISING THE TRUMP AGENDA
WHILE ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THINGS
HE WANTS TO WORK ON WITH THE
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
HE SAYS THERE'S WORK TO DO.
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WITH THE
POWER PANEL.
HE'S A PARTNER AT FORWARD
SOLUTION STRATEGY GROUP.
LAWRENCE JONES AND REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON
KAYLEE.
WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> Shannon: I'M GOING TO PLAY
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF SOME OF
THOSE COMMENTS ON CNN.
PREVIEWING KANYE COMING TO THE
WHITE HOUSE.
HERE IS WHAT A FORMER G.O.P.
SPOKESPERSON HAD TO SAY.
>> LIKE THE PRESIDENT, HE'S ALL
OF A SUDDEN THE MODEL
SPOKESPERSON.
HE IS THE TOKEN OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.
>> Shannon: I WILL START WITH
YOU.
I SORT OF GASPED WHEN SHE SAID
THAT.
THAT IS QUITE A LINE.
>> LET ME SAY THIS.
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF BLACK
REPUBLICANS WITHIN THE MOVEMENT
THAT HAVE TRIED TO MOBILIZE
BLACK FOLKS IN THE PAST, AND
HAVE BEEN NOT SUCCESSFUL.
KANYE IS NOT THE MOST ARTICULATE
FELLOW BUT HE TALKS THE TALK
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR
COMMUNITY, SO FOR THEM TO SIT ON
THEIR INTELLECTUAL HIGH HORSE
AND PRETEND LIKE THEY HAVE
SOMEHOW BEEN EFFECTIVE OVER THE
LAST 30 YEARS OF GETTING BLACK
FOLKS TO SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY, I THINK IS INSULTING.
I THINK IT'S TIME TO START
SHAKING THIS UP.
WHAT KANYE DID WAS RAW, IT WAS
NECESSARY, DID I AGREE WITH
EVERYTHING?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
DID HE PROVIDE A LOT OF
SOLUTIONS?
NO HE DIDN'T.
BUT IT'S A STARTING PLACE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE
CRITICIZING HIM SAYS IT SHOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE
OVAL OFFICE.
I'M SORRY, THAT IS THAT PEOPLE'S
HOUSE AND I THINK THAT IS WHERE
WE NEED TO START HAVING THESE
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PRESIDEN
PRESIDENT.
>> HE'S A CREATIVE GUY.
HE HAS PUT OUT SOME FANTASTIC
MOVEMENT AND SOME INTERESTING
THINGS, THE FASHION.
I WON'T COMMENT ON.
BUT THIS GUY IS A CREATIVE GUY.
HE TALKED TODAY WITH THE PRESS
ABOUT, LISTEN, I'M COMPLEX.
I WON'T GIVE YOU A QUICK LITTLE
SOUND BITE.
I AM LIKE A FINE WINE WITH A LOT
OF DIFFERENT NOTES.
SO HE HAD SOME INTERESTING
THINGS TO SAY BUT IS HE BEING
DISCREDITED OR DISREGARDED
BECAUSE HE'S WILLING TO BE
SOMEWHAT SUPPORTIVE OF THIS
PRESIDENT?
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK YOU SEE THAT
AROUND OTHER CELEBRITIES WHO
HAVE SUPPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I DON'T THINK YOU SEE THAT ON
OTHER CELEBRITIES ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE AISLE.
IF ANYTHING, THERE IS MUCH ADO
ABOUT NOTHING IN THE FACT THAT I
JUST DON'T THINK THESE CELEBRITY
ENDORSEMENTS, TAYLOR SWIFT,
KANYE WEST REALLY CARRY THAT
MUCH WEIGHT WITH AN ELECTORATE.
ALL THAT SAID, WHAT I THINK IS
NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH
HERE, AND I SAY THIS IN ALL
SERIOUSNESS BECAUSE IT REALLY
BOTHERS ME TO SEE PEOPLE MAKING
LIGHT OF IT, I THINK WE HAVE A
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN AMERICA.
I THINK MR. WEST WAS VERY OPEN
ABOUT COMING OFF MEDICATION, I
THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
REPORTS IN THE MEDIA ABOUT
PEOPLE IN HIS INNER CIRCLE
VOICING CONCERNS.
I THINK THAT IS A SEPARATE TOPIC
FROM THE POLITICS AND I HOPE
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN SPARK
A CONVERSATION.
>> JUST BECAUSE HE HAS MENTAL
ISSUES, THERE ARE A LOT OF
AMERICANS WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH
ISSUES WHO CAN STILL TALK ABOUT
POLITICS IN AMERICA.
THEY CAN STILL TALK ABOUT WHAT'S
AFFECTING THEIR COMMUNITY.
TO SIT ON NATIONAL TV AND SAY
THAT WE SHOULD SOMEHOW DISCREDIT
HIM.
>> I DID NOT SAY THAT!
>> Shannon: GENTLEMAN, STOPPED
FOR A SECOND HERE.
STOP FOR A SECOND.
>> THAT'S LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT I SAID.
>> Shannon: I THINK WHAT YOU
MEANT, THERE IS A CONNECTION.
WE HEARD THE SAME THING ON
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" THE OTHER
NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT KANYE AND SAYING, I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE TO SAY.
HE TALKED ABOUT HOTDOGS BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR KANYE TALK
ABOUT THIS.
THEY ALSO USE THE WORDS "MENTAL
HEALTH ILLNESS" AND A LOT OF
PEOPLE WILL WERE UNCOMFORTABLE.
IT'S BECAUSE THAT WAS PETE
DAVIDSON WHO HAS COME OUT ABOUT
HIS OWN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND
THE DANGERS HE'S FACED.
WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT WHEN HE WAS
OFF HIS MEDICATION, HE TALKED
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
I THINK THERE'S A REAL
SERIOUSNESS HERE.
SEPARATE FROM THE POLITICS, IT
SHOULD MATTER.
>> Shannon: HE'S DONE A LOT OF
THINGS THAT PEOPLE EITHER WANT
TO DISREGARD OR DON'T WANT TO
PAY ATTENTION TO, BUT HERE'S
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT VIOLENCE AND
GUNS IN CHICAGO, HIS HOMETOWN.
>> ILLEGAL GUNS ARE THE PROBLEM,
NOT LEGAL GUNS.
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
>> Shannon: THAT WAS QUITE A
STATEMENT THERE.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WIN ANY
POINTS WITH THE LEFT, EITHER.
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO.
HE MADE A LOT OF GOOD POINTS.
HE TALKED ABOUT ANY FACTORING,
BRINGING JOBS BACK TO MIDDLE
AMERICA, HE TALKED ABOUT
WELFARE.
HE HAD VERY WELL-INFORMED
POLITICAL OPINIONS, BUT WE ARE
GOING TO HEAR THE LEFT CALL HIM
MENTALLY ILL, AS MANY HAVE DONE,
SAY HE'S OFF HIS MEDICINE, AS
WAS JUST SAID.
LAWRENCE IS RIGHT, IT'S AN
EFFORT TO DISCREDIT HIM.
COMPARE THE WAY FOLKS TALKED
ABOUT KANYE BEFORE HE CAME OUT
FOR TRENT.
THEY CALLED HIM A GENIUS IN
"ROLLING STONE."
THE KING HIP-HOP.
THEN ON CNN, PUBLICITY.
THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE.
CALLING HIM A TOKEN.
HE'S THE MOST AWARDED GRAMMY
WINNER IN HISTORY, BUT
NEVERTHELESS, NOW HE'S DERIDED
AS MENTALLY ILL.
FOLKS TALK ABOUT HIM ENTIRELY
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE HE IS NOW A
DRUM SUPPORTED.
IT IS WRONG, AND ANYONE POINTING
TO THE MENTAL HEALTH OF CONNIE
WEST IS DOING A DISSERVICE TO
MENTAL HEALTH AND THE CRISIS OF
THIS COUNTRY.
KANYE HIMSELF TALKED ABOUT THAT
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Shannon: HE SAID HE WAS
MISDIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR.
ACCORDING TO HIM AND HIS MEDICAL
TEAM, HE SAID THAT WAS A WRONG
DIAGNOSIS FOR HIM.
THAT'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT
THAT.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE --
>> HIS OWN FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE
CLOSE TO HIM DISAGREE.
>> Shannon: LET'S MOVE ON FROM
THAT.
WE ARE NOT.
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO
HAVE A DISTINCTION THERE AS YOU
ARE TRYING TO MAKE, AS WELL.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE TALK
ABOUT -- ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS
PRISON REFORM, SENTENCING
REFORM, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.
JARED KUSHNER IS GETTING A LOT
OF CREDIT FOR TRYING TO
INFLUENCE THE PRESIDENT ON
THOSE.
JONES, HE SAYS THIS ABOUT JARED
KUSHNER, HIS RELENTLESS
SINGLE-MINDEDNESS HAS EARNED THE
RESPECT OF HIS SUPPORTERS AND
RETRACTORS.
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE
SINGLE-HANDEDLY KEPT THE IDEA OF
PRISON REFORM ALIVE THROUGH HIS
DEDICATION AND WILLPOWER ALONE.
EACH OF YOU WAY ON THIS QUICKLY
PLEASE.
>> I'M GLAD TO SEE PROGRESS
BEING MADE.
I THINK RIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS
ARE SPLIT ON IT, DEMOCRATS ARE
SPLIT ON IT.
HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE THINGS
DONE TO FIX IT INCLUDING MAKING
IT PART OF A BIGGER PACKAGE THAT
ADDRESSES SENTENCING REFORM, AS
WELL.
AT THIS POINT, WE NEED TO BE
THANKFUL FOR ANY STEPS MOVING
FORWARD.
WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW TO MAKE
THAT PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE
PLAN.
I HOPE PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL
STAND UP TO THE 30 CONSERVATIVE
LEADERS FEATURED IN "BREITBART."
THIS IS A FIRST STEP TO BUILD
ON.
>> THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ON
BOTH SIDES THAT BELIEVE THAT
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM NEEDS TO
HAPPEN.
FROM THE CONSERVATIVE MEMBER,
TED CRUZ, RAND PAUL, ALL THE WAY
TO THE CORY BOOKERS OF THE
WORLD.
I COMMEND THE PRESIDENT FOR
STARTING THIS.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL
AMERICANS SHOULD GET BEHIND.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS,
BECAUSE YOU'VE STILL GOT JEFF
SESSIONS, WHOSE ATTORNEY
GENERAL, WHO HAS NOT BEEN
SUPPORTIVE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
REFORM.
>> Shannon: IF IT COMES DOWN
TO HIM OR JEFF SESSIONS ON THIS,
WE ARE GOING WITH THE
PRESIDENT'S PLAN.
>> JARED KUSHNER DESERVE SO MUCH
CREDIT HERE.
VENGEANCE GAVE ME THAT QUOTE
FROM MY ARTICLE.
WE'RE IN THIS TOWN IN D.C. THAT
YOU GET A CONGRESSMAN ON THE
RIGHT AND THE LEFT PRAISING
SOMEONE.
HE SAID JARRETT HAS BEEN
INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS, AND DOUG
COLLINS THAT WE ARE ONE VOTE
AWAY IN THE SENATE.
ONE BOAT FROM PRISON REFORM.
THIS HAS ONLY BEEN DONE TWICE IN
MODERN HISTORY.
ONE VOTE AWAY, THEY DESERVE A
LOT OF CREDIT.
>> Shannon: TO GET BIPARTISAN
COOPERATION MOVING ON THESE
