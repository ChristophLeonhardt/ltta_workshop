NINAN,  INC. 
YOU FOR JOINING US. 
ANY MOMENT NOW, REX TILLERSON 
WILL DELIVER A STATEMENT LIFE 
IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT COME -- 
STATE DEPARTMENT, AFTER HE WAS 
FIRED AS SECRETARY OF STATE. WE 
WILL BRING IT TO YOU LIVE. 
HIS FIRING COMES AFTER MONTHS 
OF TENSION BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND HIS TOP DIPLOMAT, 
ISSUES LIKE THE IRAN NUCLEAR 
DEAL AND NORTH KOREA, THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT SAID HE WAS NOT TOLD 
WHY HE WAS FIRED, THE PRESIDENT 
HAS PICKED MIKE POMPEO, THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA, TO TAKE 
OVER AT STATE. 
HE MENTIONED IT AS HE LEFT FOR 
CALIFORNIA. 
>> I HAVE WORKED WITH MIKE 
POMPEO NOW FOR QUITE SOME TIME, 
TREMENDOUS ENERGY, INTELLECT, 
WE ARE ALWAYS ON THE SAME 
WAVELENGTH, THE RELATIONSHIP 
HAS BEEN VERY GOOD, AND THAT IS 
WHAT I NEED AS SECRETARY OF 
STATE, I WISH REX TILLERSON 
WELL. 
GINA, I KNOW VERY WELL, I HAVE 
WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH, THE 
FIRST FEMALE DIRECTOR OF THE 
CIA, AN OUTSTANDING PERSON, I 
HAVE GOT TO KNOW HER VERY WELL. 
I'VE GOT TO KNOW PEOPLE VERY 
WELL OVER THE LAST YEAR, AND I 
AM REALLY AT A POINT WHERE WE 
ARE HAVING A CLOSE TIME TO HAVE 
THE CABINET THAT I WANT COBB 
BUT I THINK MIKE POMPEO WILL BE 
A TRULY GREAT SECRETARY OF 
STATE, I HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE 
IN HIM, AND AS FAR AS REX 
TILLERSON IS CONCERNED, I VERY 
MUCH APPRECIATE HIS COMMITMENT 
AND HIS SERVICE, AND I WISH HIM 
WELL.>> EARLIER, I SPOKE TO THE 
HILL, BOB CUSACK.>> IS SIMILAR 
TO HOW JAMES COMEY WAS FIRED, 
TRUMP DID NOT CONTACT JAMES 
COMEY, HE HAD AN ASSISTANT GO 
OVER TO THE FBI, AND COMAY WAS 
OUT OF TOWN, AND THERE WAS A 
LOT OF -- JAMES COMEY WAS OUT 
OF TOWN. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF TENSION 
BETWEEN REX TILLERSON AND 
DONALD TRUMP, I THINK HE WAS 
NEVER ABLE TO GET OVER THE FACT 
THAT IT WAS REPORTED THAT 
TILLERSON CALLED HIM A MORON, 
THEY DIDN'T TRUST EACH OTHER, 
GOING INTO THESE NORTH KOREA 
TALKS, HE LIKES LOYALISTS, MIKE 
POMPEO IS A LOYALIST, REX 
TILLERSON IS NOT.
>> TELL ME ABOUT MIKE POMPEO 
AND NORTH KOREA, WHAT DO WE 
KNOW ABOUT HIS RECORD? 
>> VERY ACCOMPLISHED, IN THE 
HOUSE, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE, NOMINATED TO CIA, 
AND YOU GOT THE FEELING THAT 
BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONHIP, HE 
WAS BRIEFING DONALD TRUMP ON A 
DAILY BASIS OF DANGERS AROUND 
THE WORLD, THAT HE REALLY WAS 
GOING TO GET SOME OTHER TYPE OF 
POSITION, SOME SPECULATION FOR 
ATTORNEY GENERAL, BECAUSE JEFF 
SESSIONS AND DONALD TRUMP HAVE 
HAD THEIR UPS AND DOWNS, TO SAY 
THE LEAST, BUT THE TRUMP LOYAL 
TO -- THE TRUMP LOYALISTS LIKE 
THIS PICK, MIKE POMPEO GOT SOME 
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT, HIS 
CONFIRMATION HEARING IS GOING 
TO BE TOUGH, HE WILL HAVE THE 
VOTES, HE GOT 66 LAST TIME, HE 
ONLY NEEDS 51 THIS TIME. 
>> SO YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL 
BE DIFFICULT? 
BUT A LOT OF QUESTIONS, BUT HE 
IS RESPECTED ACROSS THE AISLE, 
AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, HE WILL 
BE CONFIRMED. 
>> WHAT SORT OF ROLE DO YOU 
THINK HE WILL PLAY WITH NORTH 
KOREA?>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP 
AND MIKE POMPEO ARE MORE LIKE-
MINDED, AS TRUMP LIKES TO SAY, 
HE LIKES TO BE TOUGH, AND HE 
FELT THAT REX TILLERSON WASN'T 
TOUGH ENOUGH, AND TILLERSON WAS 
TRYING TO BE A DIPLOMAT, AND 
TRUMP WOULD SAY DON'T WASTE 
YOUR TIME WITH NORTH KOREA, AND 
NOW TRUMP IS VERY MUCH 
INTERESTED IN SITTING DOWN WITH 
KIM JONG-UN, IN A HISTORIC 
MEETING, AND HE DIDN'T WANT REX 
TILLERSON BY HIS SIDE, HE ONCE 
MIKE POMPEO BY HIS SIDE. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE IS 
CLOSE TO HAVE THE CABINET THAT 
HE WANTS, COULD HE BE IMPLYING 
THAT THERE ARE THE CABINET 
MEMBERS THAT HE'S NOT HAPPY 
WITH?
>> THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HEARING, 
OTHER SHOES TO DROP, YOU HAVE 
TO THINK OF JEFF SESSIONS AT 
ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE ONLY 
PROBLEM THERE IS THAT ROD 
ROSENSTEIN WOULD BE THE ACTING 
ATTORNEY GENERAL AS HE SEARCHES 
FOR A NEW ONE, BUT IT IS CLEAR, 
THIS IS A PIVOTAL POINT AT THE 
-- IN THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY, A 
POWER SHIFT GOING ON, GENERAL 
KELLY, THE CHIEF OF STAFF, HE 
DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER USED TO 
HAVE, GARY COHN OUT AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE, AND THE ROB PORTER 
SCANDAL, THIS IS TRUMP SAYING 
ABOUT DOING WITH THE 
ESTABLISHMENT WANTS ME TO DO, 
HE IS BECOMING MORE LIKE TRUMP, 
AND NOT GIVING TO -- NOT 
LISTENING TO ADVICE GIVEN BY 
WILL WASHINGTON -- ADVICE GIVEN 
BY WASHINGTON PEOPLE. 
>> HE SAYS HE IS ON THE SAME 
WAVELENGTH AS MIKE POMPEO, HE 
Ãº 
OPPOSING VIEWS, IS THAT THE 
OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE IS DOING 
TODAY? 
BUT IN SOME WAYS IT IS, [ 
LAUGHTER ], BUT IT SEEMS LIKE 
REX TILLERSON -- >> IN SOME 
WAYS IT IS, , BUT 
IT SEEMS LIKE REX TILLERSON AND 
DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T SEE EYE TO 
EYE, TRUMP RESPECTED HIS EXXON 
EXPERIENCE, SOME SAID HE DIDN'T 
HAVE WHAT IT TOOK TO BE 
SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE NOTED THAT HE DID A 
LOT OF FOREIGN DEALS, I THINK 
IT CAME DOWN TO RELATIONSHIPS, 
IN ANY INDUSTRY IT IS IMPORTANT,
DONALD TRUMP IS MORE 
COMFORTABLE WITH MIKE POMPEO 
THAN REX TILLERSON.
>>> I WANT TO TURN NSQ ABOUT 
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE, THEY SAY THEY 
FINISHED THE RUSSIA ELECTION 
MEDDLING, AND THEY FOUND NO 
COLLUSION. 
I WANT TO PLAY WHAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAD TO SAY. 
>> WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE 
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, 
SAYING THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO 
COLLUSION WITH RESPECT TO 
RUSSIA, AND IT WAS A VERY 
POWERFUL DECISION, A STRONG 
DECISION, BACKED UP, I 
UNDERSTAND, THEY WANT -- THEY 
WILL RELEASE HUNDREDS OF PAGES 
OF PROOF AND EVIDENCE, WE ARE 
VERY HAPPY WITH THAT DECISION, 
A POWERFUL DECISION, THAT LEFT 
NO DOUBT.>> BUT FOLKS ARE NOT 
UNITED ON THIS, THE DEMOCRATS 
ARE GOING TO ISSUE THEIR OWN 
REPORT, WHAT YOU THINK THEIR 
CONCLUSIONS MIGHT SAY? 
BUT REPUBLICANS AS EARLY AS 
TODAY ARE GOING TO DELIVER A 
150 PAGE REPORT TO THE 
DEMOCRATS, THE MAJORITY 
OPINION, AND THEN A MINORITY 
OPINION, THEY ARE GOING TO 
COUNTER THAT. WE WILL SEE THOSE 
REPORTS, MAYBE SOME REDACTED, 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT. 
THIS IS NOT SURPRISING, THIS 
COMMITTEE, WHICH USED TO WORK 
ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, HAS JUST 
BEEN A PARTISAN BATTLEGROUND. 
AND I THINK THIS IS CLEARING 
THE WAY FOR THE PRESIDENT 
ELUDING THAT IT IS OVER, NO 
COLLUSION, AND WE HAVE ALREADY 
HEARD FROM SOME CONSERVATIVES, 
IT IS TIME FOR ROBERT MUELLER 
TO WRAP UP HIS INVESTIGATION. 
OF COURSE, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO 
LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY, AND 
THE OTHER THING IS, TIMING, 
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, ALSO DOING 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE NOT 
WRAPPED UP, IF THEY WRAP UP IN 
THE NEAR FUTURE, THAT I THINK 
THERE WOULD BE SOME PRESSURE ON 
ROBERT MUELLER. 
THE PROBLEM FOR ROBERT MUELLER 
IS THE TIMING OF WHATEVER HE 
ELEASES WHAT HE'S GOING TO 
RELEASE, WE CAN'T DO IT RIGHT 
BEFORE THE ELECTION, I THINK 
THERE IS A DECENT SHOT THAT HIS 
INVESTIGATION GOES BEYOND THE 
MIDTERM ELECTION. 
>> IS AT THE ROBERT MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION THEY ARE WATCHING?
YOU MENTIONED THE CREDIBILITY, 
TAINTED, NOT BIPARTISAN, VERY 
PARTISAN, AND THEIR 
CREDIBILITY, IS IT JUST SHOT AT 
THIS POINT?>> I THINK IT IS, 
THAT PANEL IS BROKEN, BOTH 
SIDES SAY, THEY FINGER POINT TO 
THE OTHER SIDE IS THE REASON, 
THE SENATE PANELS GET ALONG 
MUCH BETTER, BUT AT THE SAME 
TIME, ROBERT MUELLER IS THE ONE 
MAKING NEWS, HE IS LOOKING AS 
IN-DEPTH AS ANYBODY IT SEEMS, 
HE'S GOT THE AUTHORITY TO DO 
THAT, SO I THINK THE FINAL SAY 
WILL BE ROBERT MUELLER, 
PERIOD.>>> THE PRESIDENT WILL 
BE INSPECTING PROTOTYPES FOR 
THE LONG PROMISED WALL ON THE 
MEXICO BORDER, CONGRESS HAS YET 
TO PROVIDE THE ESTIMATED $20 
BILLION ON HOW TO BUILD THIS. 
REMIND US AGAIN, WHERE DOES 
CONGRESS STAND ON THE 
PRESIDENTS WALL PROPOSAL?>> 
THEY ARE NOT CLOSE TO PASSING A 
WALL PROPOSAL, THERE WAS TALK 
OF A BIG DEAL WHERE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WOULD GIVE THE DEMOCRATS 
WHAT THEY WANT ON DREAMERS, AND 
TRUMP WOULD GET HIS WALL, OR 
FUNDING FOR HIS WALL, THEY PUT 
THAT ON THE TABLE, BUT THEY 
PULLED BACK, I DON'T SEE ANY 
DEAL ON IMMIGRATION HAPPENING 
ANYTIME SOON, ESPECIALLY 
BECAUSE THE DREAMERS ARE NOT IN 
DANGER OF BEING DEPORTED, EVEN 
THOUGH WE ARE PAST MARCH 5, 
BECAUSE OF COURT BATTLES, SO 
UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER RULING, 
THE WALL IS DEAD AND THE 
DREAMERS ARE CERTAINLY STALLED. 
>>> A LIVE LOOK NOW AT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT, FORMER 
SECRETARY OF STATE REX 
TILLERSON WILL BE TAKING THAT 
PODIUM ANY MOMENT NOW, 
ACCORDING TO OUR REPORTING, HE 
WAS NOTIFIED THROUGH MEDIA 
REPORTS, HE DIDN'T RECEIVE A 
DIRECT CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT, 
MAYBE WE WILL GET SOME 
CLARIFICATION, AND IF HE HAS A 
REASON AS TO WHY HE WAS FIRED. 
REPORTERS AT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT IN PLACE, WE EXPECT 
THIS TO HAPPEN ANY MOMENT NOW, 
WE WILL BRING IT TO YOU LIVE AS 
SOON AS IT BEGINS.
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NAMED 
GINA HASPEL AS THE NOOSE -- AS 
THE NEW CIA DIRECTOR, I SPOKE 
WITH SOMEBODY, WHO SAID YOU 
DON'T MESS WITH HER, SHE WAS 
NOT JUST A WORKER BECAUSE SHE 
WAS AN ARCHITECT OF THE ENHANCED
INTERROGATION PROGRAM THAT 
DEALT WITH BLACK TIGHT -- BLACK 
SITES AND TORTURE. 
>> SHE IS WELL RESPECTED WITHIN 
THE RANK-AND-FILE AT THE CIA, 
WHEN I MADE CALLS AROUND HER AS 
SHE WAS BEING APPOINTED TO THE 
CIA, SHE HAS GAINED RESPECT IN 
HER THREE DECADES WORKING AT 
THE AGENCY, SHE IS A CAREER 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, SHE 
JOINED THE CA AND -- THE CIA, 
AND MOVED UP, SHE WAS A STATION 
CHIEF, AND RAN SOME COVERT 
OPERATIONS AND HUMAN 
INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS FOR THE 
CIA, SO YES, THOSE FOLKS WHO 
ARE TELLING YOU THAT SHE IS A 
DOOR KICKER, THAT IS PRETTY 
ACCURATE, SHE IS PRETTY TOUGH, 
AND WELL RESPECTED PERIOD -- 
WELL RESPECTED. 
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA CLOSED THE 
BLACK SITES, HE COULD HAVE 
PROSECUTED HER. 
BUT HE DIDN'T. 
>>> WE ARE HEARING NOW FROM REX 
TILLERSON WHO WAS FIRED AS 
SECRETARY OF STATE. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO ENSURE AN 
ORDERLY AND SMOOTH TRANSITION, 
SIGNIFICANT POLICY AND NATIONAL 
SECURITY CHALLENGES. 
AS SUCH, EFFECTIVE AT THE END 
OF THE DAY, I AM DELEGATING ALL 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE 
OF THE SECRETARY, TO DEBORAH 
TERRY -- DEPUTY SECRETARY OF 
STATE SULLIVAN, IT WILL 
TERMINATE AT MIDNIGHT, MARCH 31.
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, I WILL 
ADDRESS IF YOU ADMINISTER THE 
MATTERS RELATED TO MY DEPARTURE,
AND WORK TOWARDS A SMOOTH AND 
ORDERLY TRANSITION FOR 
SECRETARY OF STATE DESIGNATE, 
MIKE POMPEO.
>>> I AM ENCOURAGING MY POLICY 
PLANNING TEAM AND UNDER 
SECRETARIES, AND ASSISTANT 
SECRETARIES, THOSE CONFIRMED, 
AS WELL AS THOSE IN ACTING 
POSITIONS, TO REMAIN AT THEIR 
POST. 
AND CONTINUE OUR MISSION AT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT, AND WORKING 
WITH THE INTERAGENCY PROCESS. 
I WILL BE MEETING MEMBERS OF MY 
FRONT OFFICE TEAM AND POLICY 
PLANNING LATER TODAY TO THANK 
THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE, THEY 
HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY 
DEDICATED TO OUR MISSION, WHICH 
INCLUDES PROMOTING VALUES THAT 
I VIEW AS BEING IMPORTANT, THE 
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF STATE 
DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL, 
ACCOUNTABILITY, WHICH MEANS 
TREATING EACH OTHER WITH 
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY, AND 
RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER. 
MOST RECENTLY, IN PARTICULAR, 
TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES OF SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT WITHIN THE 
DEPARTMENT PERIOD -- THE 
DEPARTMENT. 
>>> I WANT TO SPEAK TO MY STATE 
DEPARTMENT COLLEAGUES AND 
INTERAGENCY COLLEAGUES, AT DOD 
AND JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF MOST 
PARTICULARLY. 
TO MY FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS, 
AND CIVIL SERVICE COLLEAGUES, 
WE ALL TOOK THE SAME OATH OF 
OFFICE, WHETHER YOU ARE CAREER, 
EMPLOYEE OR A POLITICAL 
APPOINTEE, WE ARE ALL BOUND BY 
THAT COMMON COMMITMENT. 
TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
TO BEAR TRUE FAITH AND 
ALLEGIANCE TO THE SAME. 
AND TO FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THE 
DUTIES OF OUR OFFICE. 
AS A STATE DEPARTMENT, WE ARE 
BOUND TOGETHER BY THAT OATH. 
WE REMAIN STEADFAST, HERE IN 
WASHINGTON, AND AT POSTS ACROSS 
THE WORLD. 
MANY OF WHOM ARE IN DANGER 
PLACED SITUATIONS WITHOUT THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
THE WORLD NEEDS SELFLESS 
LEADERS LIKE THESE. 
READY TO WORK, WITH LONG-
STANDING ALLIES, NEW EMERGING 
PARTNERS AND ALLIES, WHO NOW, 
MANY ARE STRUGGLING AS 
DEMOCRACIES, AND IN SOME CASES, 
ARE DEALING WITH HUMAN TRAGEDY, 
CRISIS AND NATIONAL -- NATURAL 
DISASTERS, LITERALLY CRAWLING 
THEMSELVES OUT OF THOSE 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
THESE ARE EXPERIENCES THAT NO 
LECTURE HALL AND THE ACADEMIC 
ENVIRONMENT OR A THINK TANK CAN 
TEACH YOU. 
ONLY BY PEOPLE GOING TO THE 
FRONT LINES TO SERVE, CAN THEY 
DEVELOP THIS KIND OF TALENT.>>> 
TO THE MEN AND WOMEN IN 
UNIFORM, I AM TOLD FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN MOST PEOPLE'S 
MEMORY, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, 
OF A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP
, WHERE WE ALL AGREE THAT U.S. 
LEADERSHIP STARTS WITH 
DIPLOMACY. 
THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AT 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, 
UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF 
SECRETARY MATTIS AND GENERAL 
DUNFORD, PROTECT US DAILY, AND 
OUR WAY OF LIFE, AT HOME AND 
ABROAD. 
AS AN ALL VOLUNTEER MILITARY, 
THEY DO IT FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY, 
THEY DO IT FOR YOU, AND THEY DO 
IT FOR ME. 
AND FOR NO OTHER REASON, AS 
AMERICANS, WE ARE ALL ETERNALLY 
GRATEFUL TO EACH OF THEM, AND 
WE HONOR THEIR SACRIFICES.>>> 
THE REPORTING PART -- THE 
REWARDING PART OF HAVING 
LEADERSHIP IN PLACES THAT YOU 
CAN GET THINGS DONE, AND I WANT 
TO GIVE RECOGNITION TO THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT, AND OUR 
PARTNERS, FOR A FEW OF THEIR 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, UNDER THIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
FIRST, WORKING WITH ALLIES, WE 
EXCEEDED THE EXPECTATIONS OF 
ALMOST EVERYONE WITH THE DPRK 
MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN, MY 
FIRST TRIP, THE ERA OF 
STRATEGIC PATIENTS WAS OVER, 
AND WE COMMENCED THE STEPS TO 
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE NOT JUST 
THE SCOPE BUT THE EFFECTIVENESS 
OF THE SANCTIONS. 
WE UNDERTOOK A GLOBAL CAMPAIGN 
TO BRING PARTNERS AND ALLIES ON 
BOARD IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE 
WORLD, WITH EVERY EMBASSY 
RAISING THIS TO THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS, AND IN EVERY MEETING I 
HAVE HAD THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, 
THIS HAS BEEN ON THE AGENDA TO 
DISCUSS.>>> THE ADOPTION OF THE 
SOUTH ASIA STRATEGY, WITH A 
CONDITIONS BASED MILITARY PLAN, 
TO COMPEL THE TALIB AND TO 
RECONCILIATION AND PEACE TALKS 
WITH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. 
FINALLY EQUIPPED, WITH A 
STRATEGY THEY CAN EXECUTE, AS 
OPPOSED TO A SUCCESSION OF 16 
ONE-YEAR STRATEGIES. 
THIS CLEAR MILITARY COMMITMENT 
ATTRACTED THE SUPPORT OF ALLIES 
BROADLY, AND EQUIPPED OUR 
DIPLOMATS WITH A WHOLE NEW 
LEVEL OF CERTAINTY AROUND HOW 
TO PREPARE FOR THE PEAK STOCKS 
-- PEACE TALKS, AND MUCH WORK 
REMAINS. 
>>> IN SYRIA, WE DID ACHIEVE 
IMPOTANT CEASE-FIRES AND 
STABILIZATION, WHICH WE KNOW 
HAS SAVED THOUSANDS OF LIVES. 
THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE IN 
SYRIA, PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT 
TO ACHIEVING THE PEACE, AS WELL 
AS STABILIZING IRAQ, AND SEEING 
A HEALTHY GOVERNMENT INSTALLED, 
AND MORE BROADLY, IN THE ENTIRE 
GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT ISIS. 
NOTHING IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT 
ALLIES AND PARTNERS, THOUGH. 
MUCH WORK REMAINS TO ESTABLISH 
A CLEAR VIEW OF THE NATURE OF 
OUR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH 
CHINA.>>> HOW SHALL WE DO WITH 
ONE ANOTHER OVER THE NEXT 50 
YEARS, AND ASSURE A MEASURE OF 
PROSPERITY FOR PEOPLE'S, FREE 
OF CONFLICT BETWEEN TWO VERY 
POWERFUL NATIONS? 
MUCH -- PROSPERITY FOR OUR 
PEOPLE.
>>> RUSSIA MUST ASSESS 
CAREFULLY AS TO HOW ITS ACTIONS 
ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE 
RUSSIAN PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 
MORE BROADLY. 
CONTINUING ON THEIR CURRENT 
TRAJECTORY IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO 
GREATER ISOLATION ON THEIR PART.
A SITUATION WHICH IS NOT IN 
ANYONE'S INTEREST.>>> SO TO MY 
COLLEAGUES IN THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND INTERAGENCY, 
MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE TO 
ACHIEVE OUR MISSION, ON BEHALF 
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WITH 
ALLIES AND PARTNERS. 
I CLOSE BY THINKING ALL FOR THE 
PRIVILEGE OF SERVING BESIDE YOU 
FOR THE LAST 14 MONTHS, 
IMPORTANTLY, TO THE 300+ 
MILLION AMERICANS, THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR DEVOTION TO A FREE AND 
OPEN SOCIETY. 
TO ACTS OF KINDNESS TOWARDS ONE 
ANOTHER, TO HONESTY, AND THE 
QUIET HARD WORK THAT YOU DO 
EVERY DAY TO SUPPORT THIS 
GOVERNMENT WITH YOUR TAX 
DOLLARS. 
ALL OF US, WE KNOW, WANT TO 
LEAVE THIS PLACE AS A BETTER 
PLACE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. 
I WILL NOW RETURN TO PRIVATE 
LIFE, AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, AS 
A PROUD AMERICAN, PROUD OF THE 
OPPORTUNITY I HAVE HAD TO SERVE 
MY COUNTRY. 
GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU, GOD BLESS 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GOD BLESS 
AMERICA.
>>> OUTGOING SECRETARY OF STATE 
REX TILLERSON LEAVES THE ROOM 
WITHOUT TAKING QUESTIONS, HE 
SPOKE FOR A LITTLE MORE THAN 10 
MINUTES, HE SOUNDED WINDED AND 
EMOTIONAL AT TIMES, AFTER WHAT 
HAS UNDERSTANDABLY BEEN A 
DIFFICULT 24-48 HOURS HERE OR 
MORE, SINCE FINDING OUT JUST 
THIS MORNING AFTER BEING CALLED 
BACK FROM AFRICA, THAT HE WAS 
BEING REMOVED AS SECRETARY OF 
STATE, AND MIKE POMPEO WILL BE 
THENEW SECRETARY OF STATE. 
THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT 
TWEETED, MIKE POMPEO, THE CIA 
DIRECTOR, WILL BECOME THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE, THANKS TO 
REX TILLERSON FOR HIS SERVICE. 
THE PRESIDENT LATER SPOKE TO 
REPORTERS OUTSIDE THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND SAID THAT REX 
TILLERSON WILL BE MUCH HAPPIER 
NOW, MIKE POMPEO'S DEPUTY AT 
THE CIA, GINA HASPEL KABUL  
SUCCEED HIM AS THE DIRECTOR, 
SHE WILL BECOME THE FIRST WOMAN 
TO LEAD THE CIA.
>>> MARGARET BRENNAN WAS IN THE 
ROOM AS REX TILLERSON MADE HIS 
FAREWELL SPEECH, HE WILL 
DELEGATE HIS AUTHORITIES BY THE 
END OF TODAY, BUT REMAIN HIS 
COMMISSION IN -- UNTIL THE END 
OF THE MONTH.
>> Reporter: AS YOU DESCRIBED, 
THE SECRETARY'S VOICE IS 
LABORING, CLEARLY A DIFFICULT 
THING FOR REX TILLERSON TO SAY 
PUBLICLY, AFTER BEING SO 
PUBLICLY FIRED TODAY. 
IT HAS BEEN NO SECRET THAT HE 
AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE HAD 
POLICY DISAGREEMENTS OVER THE 
PAST YEAR OR MORE, THAT HE HAS 
SERVED, BUT THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE HAS BEEN, AS HE DESCRIBES 
HIMSELF, A BOY SCOUT THROUGHOUT 
ALL OF THAT. 
HE HAS NOT AIRED A LOT OF THOSE 
GRIEVANCES, THOUGH THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH 
DISAGREEMENTS. 
THE PRESIDENT POINTED TO A 
DISAGREEMENT OVER IRAN, AND 
WHAT TO DO WITH THE NUCLEAR 
DEAL IS ONE OF THE CHIEF THINGS 
THAT HE SAW AS PUTTING HIM AT 
ODDS WITH THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE. 
BUT FOR REX TILLERSON, AS HE 
MOVES INTO PRIVATE LIFE, IT HAS 
BEEN A TREMENDOUS YEAR, HE LEFT 
THE BUSINESS WORLD, RUNNING ONE 
OF THE LARGEST ENERGY GIANTS ON 
THE PLANET, WITH DEEP 
RELATIONSHIPS HE HAD WITH 
FOREIGN LEADERS, A LOT OF 
CRITICISM OF THE WAY THAT HE 
RAN THE BUILDING, THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT COP BUT HE HAD THOSE 
RELATIONSHIPS -- STATE 
DEPARTMENT, BUT HE HAD THOSE 
RELATIONSHIPS. 
NOW MIKE POMPEO MOVES IN WITH A 
GIANT DIPLOMATICALLY -- GIANT 
DIPLOMATIC UNDERTAKING WITH 
NORTH KOREA, AND WHETHER OR NOT 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HERE WILL 
BE PLAYING MUCH OF A ROLE, IF 
AT ALL, IN THAT UNDERTAKING. 
A LOT OF QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW 
ABOUT THE PROCESS AND THE 
TRAJECTORY OF U.S. FOREIGN 
POLICY, NOW THAT REX TILLERSON 
IS LEAVING. 
MIKE POMPEO WILL BE STEPPING 
INTO THE ROLE, REX TILLERSON NOT
ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHEN 
HE WAS INFORMED HE HAD BEEN 
FIRED, BUT DID SAY HE HAD 
RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE 
PRESIDENT TODAY AROUND NOON, 
HOURS AFTER THE TWEET WAS 
POSTED TO THE PRESIDENTS 
ACCOUNT. 
>> MARGARET BRENNAN, IN THE 
ROOM, REX TILLERSON, SHE JUST 
INTERVIEWED HIM FOR 60 MINUTES, 
AND ALSO INTERVIEWED MIKE 
POMPEO FOR FACE THE NATION, WE 
WILL HEAR FROM MARGARET ABOUT 
BOTH OF THESE MEN AND THE NEW 
ROLES THAT THEY WILL BE TAKING 
ON, REX TILLERSON IN PRIVATE 
LIFE AND MIKE POMPEO AS THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE. 
LATER TONIGHT ON CBS EVENING 
NEWS. 
MUCH MORE ON LOCAL NEWS, AND 
THE 24 HOUR STREAMING SERVICE, 
ON CBSN, FOR NOW, I AM  JEFF 
GLOR IN NEW YORK.
