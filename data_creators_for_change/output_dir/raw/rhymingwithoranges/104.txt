55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,810
blossomed into an offline one it turned

56

experiment with what you're looking to

133
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,560
do right I was knew that I was

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,570
interested in writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was English</font>

135
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,210
major I grew up reading a lot of books a

136
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,790
lot of books<font color="#E5E5E5"> and writing on fiction but</font>

137
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,100
I never had that opportunity to make

138
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,950
something of it and getting out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

139
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,630
comfort zone and going somewhere new I

140
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,450
gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out so I mean even if</font>

141
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,210
it's if it's Asia it's your wherever it

142
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,350
is it's a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Asia especially</font>

143
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,090
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of opportunity you vote an</font>

144
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,140
article I think it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger and in</font>

145
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,160
we've got regards to being kind of the

146
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,020
advice for being the Western guy in

147
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,240
China and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the most out of</font>

148
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,640
that experience but I got the impression

149
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,190
you felt I may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be wrong but I got the</font>

150
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,750
impression that you felt that the time

151
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">for going there as a westerner and</font>

152
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,460
having basically the world is your

153
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,650
oyster I had the impression that you

154
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,050
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time had and it always</font>
