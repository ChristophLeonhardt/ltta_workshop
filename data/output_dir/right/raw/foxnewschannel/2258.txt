MARK STEYN TO DISCUSS WHAT

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,388
HAPPENED AND WHAT IT MEANS.

5
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:09,490
BUT FIRST, OVER THE PAST MONTH,

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,626
A CARAVAN OF CENTRAL AMERICAN

7
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:12,326
MIGRANTS HAS GRADUALLY MADE IT

8
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:15,863

00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:17,231
WAY TO TIJUANA, OPPOSITE

10
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:17,832
SAN DIEGO.

11
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:18,399
AT ONE POINT MAKE SKIN

12
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,202
AUTHORITIES CLAIM THEY BROKE UP

13
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:23,437
AND AMERICAN MEDIA DUTIFULLY

14
00:00:23,437 --> 00:00:24,405
REPORTED THEY DID.

15
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:26,007
THEY DIDN'T.

16
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:27,208
THAT WAS A P.R. GESTURE AND A

17
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:27,642
TEMPORARY ONE.

18
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:28,676
IN FACT, DURING PART OF THE

19
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:31,646
TRIP, MEXICAN POLICE ESCORTED

20
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:32,280
THE MIGRANTS NORTHWARD.

21
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,783
IN OTHER WORDS, THE MEXICAN

22
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:36,617
MIGRANTS ABETTED ILLEGAL

23
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:37,618
IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY AS

24
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,020
IT'S DONE FOR MANY YEARS.

25
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,887
TONIGHT, THE CARAVAN IS ON OUR

26
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:41,622
SOUTHERN BORDER.

27
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:43,391
RATHER THAN WAIT FOR THE

28
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,559
CROSSING STATION TO OPEN, MANY

29
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,161
OF THEM JUMPED THE FENCE.

30
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:48,095
SOME WAVED HONDURAN FLAGS WHEN

31
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:49,797
THEY GOT TO THE TOP.

32
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:51,966
THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING.

33
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,401
WHEN YOU ARRIVE IN A COUNTRY TO

34
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,302
CONTRIBUTE TO IT AND ASSIMILATE

35
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:57,205
INTO ITS CULTURE, DON'T WAVE THE

36
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:58,439
FLAG OF A FOREIGN NATION.

37
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,776
THAT'S WHEN YOU DO IN TRIUMPH

38
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:02,977
WHEN YOU INVADE A COUNTRY.

39
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:04,178
ACCORDING TO BORDER CONTROL, AT

40
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:05,078
LEAST ONE MEMBER OF THE CARAVAN

41
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:07,615
HAS A READY ADMITTED TO BEING A

42
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:08,816
MEMBER OF MS-13.

43
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:10,418
ALL OF THAT SHOULD WORRY US.

44
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:11,185
THERE'S ONLY A FEW HUNDRED

45
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:13,187
PEOPLE IN THIS CARAVAN, BUT

46
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:14,021
THERE ARE BILLIONS MORE AROUND

47
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:14,755
THE WORLD WHO LIVED AMID

48
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:17,191
VIOLENCE AND POVERTY IN

49
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:18,626
VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

50
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:20,661
THEM WOULD LIKE TO RELOCATE TO

51
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:21,195
SAN DIEGO.

52
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:22,763
THE LEFT ARGUES WE HAVE NO MORAL

53
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:23,531
RIGHT TO STOP ANY OF THEM FROM

54
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,933
DOING THAT.

55
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,802
HERE IS TURNING TO A NICKEL

56
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:28,736
RAMUS OF TIJUANA DANCING THE

57
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:30,972
U.S. GOVERNMENT AS CRIMINAL FOR

58
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:32,240
TRYING TO ENFORCE OUR OWN

59
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,773
FEDERAL LAW.

60
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:33,074
WATCH.

61
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:36,377
>> THE METHOD FOR BORDER

62
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:38,412
PROTECTION, STOP REJECTING

63
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:39,046
ASYLUM-SEEKERS WHO TRY TO

64
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:41,415
PRESENT THEMSELVES AS A PORT OF

65
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:41,716
ENTRY.

66
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,017
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

67
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:46,187
YOU KNOW YOU TURN PEOPLE AWAY.

68
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:47,088
YOU COMPLAIN THEY ARE BREAKING

69
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:49,156
THE LAW BY ENTERING ILLEGALLY.

70
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:50,324
YOU ARE BREAKING THE LAW AND YOU

71
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:51,359
ARE FORCING THEM TO BREAK THE

72
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:51,792
LAW.

73
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,396
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CARAVANS.

74
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,264
>> Tucker: SOMETHING YOU

75
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,532
DEFTLY WANT SOMEONE TO CONTROL,

76
00:01:58,532 --> 00:01:59,600
SCREAMING IN A BULLHORN.

77
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,202
THIS IS NOT IMMIGRATION.

78
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:01,902
IMMIGRATION HAPPENS WITH THE

79
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,205
CONSENT OF THE HOST COUNTRY.

80
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:05,139
THIS IS HAPPENING BY FORCE

81
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:06,807
WITHOUT OUR CONSENT.

82
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,008
A GOVERNMENT THAT CARES ABOUT

83
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:08,743
ITS OWN CITIZENS WOULDN'T ALLOW

84
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:10,110
IT TO HAPPEN.

85
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,614
BAD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE

86
00:02:13,614 --> 00:02:15,082
YOUR HOME AND EVERYBODY KNOWS

87
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:16,117
THAT.

88
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,085
THE LEFT IS DEMANDING WE LEAVE

89
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:22,189
OUR DOOR OPEN.

90
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,357
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE AMAZING

91
00:02:23,357 --> 00:02:23,991
PEOPLE.

92
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,559
THEY SAY FAR BETTER THAN YOU

93
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,727
ARE, MR. ENTITLED AMERICAN.

94
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:30,197
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WITH

95
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:30,898
HENRIQUE AZEVEDO OF UNIVISION

96
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:34,402
AND HE MADE THAT POINT.

97
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:36,304
IF YOU ARE RIGHT UP AGAINST A

98
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:37,038
COUNTRY TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL

99
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:37,872
AS PEOPLE ARE SHOOTING EACH

100
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,273
OTHER IN THE NUMBERS YOU JUST

101
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:40,441
DESCRIBED, WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE

102
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,143
TERRIFIED TO LET THEM IN?

103
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,145
>> I THINK YOU ARE NOT GETTING

104
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:44,612
THE CRIMINALS.

105
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:45,813
YOU ARE GETTING THE BEST OF

106
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:46,881
MEXICO, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

107
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:49,216
WILLING TO WORK 2-3 SHIFTS A

108
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,584
DAY, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

109
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:51,419
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS --

110
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,220
B1 HOW DO WE KNOW THAT?

111
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,356
>> THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING

112
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:56,090
THE VIOLENCE, THAT'S WHAT YOU

113
00:02:56,090 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE GETTING.
