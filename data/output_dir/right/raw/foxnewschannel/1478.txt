1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:00,459
SOUTH KOREA.

2
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:02,561
>> Sandra: PETE KING IS A

3
00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:03,996
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE HOMELAND

4
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:04,530
SECURITY COMMITTEE.

5
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,299
GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON.

6
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,234
BREAKING NEWS.

7
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:10,135
PULL OUT OF THE SUMMIT.

8
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:10,970
YOUR THOUGHTS.

9
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,371
>> I WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT ALL

10
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:14,206
DAY YESTERDAY AND HE WAS STILL

11
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,809
HOPEFUL AT THAT TIME THAT THE

12
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,078
SUMMIT WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD.

13
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:20,546
HE WASN'T 100% BUT THOUGHT IT

14
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:22,548
WAS GOING IN THE RIGHT

15
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:23,115
DIRECTION.

16
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:23,882
THE STATEMENT FROM NORTH KOREA

17
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:25,884
MADE IT CLEAR TO THE PRESIDENT

18
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:27,820
AT THIS TIME IT SERVED NO

19
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,554
PURPOSE.

20
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,656
I THINK IT IS IN BASEBALL A

21
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,090
LONG SEASON.

22
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,791
THIS IS -- I DON'T THINK IT'S

23
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,092
OVER.

24
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:34,660
I THINK THE SUMMIT IS NOT GOING

25
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,627
TO BE HELD.

26
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,730
I THINK THE DIALOGUE THAT WAS

27
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,131
BEGUN WILL CONTINUE AND IT

28
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:41,734
SHOWS THE PRESIDENT IS NOT JUST

29
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,068
LOOKING FOR A DEAL FOR THE SAKE

30
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:45,537
OF MAKING A DEAL.

31
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:47,773
IF NORTH KOREA ISN'T GOING TO

32
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:49,441
BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH HE ISN'T

33
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,043
GOING TO GO THROUGH THE

34
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:51,910
THEATRICS OF A SUMMIT.

35
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,512
STILL A WAYS TO GO AND THE

36
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,947
PRESIDENT HAS A NUMBER OF YEARS

37
00:00:54,947 --> 00:00:57,082
LEFT IN HIS ADMINISTRATION,

38
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:57,983
HOPEFULLY THE NEXT

39
00:00:57,983 --> 00:01:00,185
ADMINISTRATION AND I BELIEVE

40
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,587
THAT THE NORTH KOREA DOES SHOW

41
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:02,788
THEY ARE CONCERNED AND WHY THEY

42
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:05,090
WANTED THE SUMMIT IN THE FIRST

43
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,625
PLACE AND THAT IF THEY CAN PLAY

44
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,193
GAMES WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP HE

45
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,094
SHOWED TODAY IT WON'T WORK.

46
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:11,663
>> Sandra: THE ADMINISTRATION

47
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:13,832
POSITION AS OF YESTERDAY WORDED

48
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:14,500
BY MIKE POMPEO.

49
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,467
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

50
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:16,769
COUNTING ON US TO GET THIS

51
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:17,069
RIGHT.

52
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,772
IF THE RIGHT DEAL IS NOT ON THE

53
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:21,273
TABLE WE WILL RESPECTFULLY WALK

54
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:22,274
AWAY AND THEY HAVE.

55
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:25,444
IN THAT LETTER FROM THE

56
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:26,645
PRESIDENT TO KIM JONG-UN

57
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,047
MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT SAID

58
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,448
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND HAVING

59
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,583
TO DO WITH THIS MOST IMPORTANT

60
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,885
SUMMIT, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE

61
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,920
TO CALL OR WRITE.

62
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,088
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE

63
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:37,990
IT CLEAR HE DOES WANT TO

64
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,992
NEGOTIATE IF THERE IS A PURPOSE

65
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:40,459
IN NEGOTIATING.

66
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,428
AND IF NORTH KOREA IS SERIOUS,

67
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:43,429
THE PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO

68
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:44,163
MEET THEM.

69
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:49,468
HE IS NOT GOING TO GO FOR THE

70
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:50,869
THEATRICS OF A SUMMIT.

71
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:53,205
HE WON'T MAKE A DEAL LIKE

72
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:54,139
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID WITH IRAN.

73
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:57,709
HE WANTS IT TO BE A PRODUCTIVE

74
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,111
SERIES OF TALKS AND

75
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,545
NEGOTIATIONS.

76
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:01,513
THE WAY NORTH KOREA WAS GOING

77
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:02,714
THE LATEST STATEMENT THEY WERE

78
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:03,882
MORE INTERESTED IN MAKING A

79
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,517
SHOW AND A POINT RATHER THAN

80
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:07,386
ACTUALLY BEING SERIOUS ABOUT

81
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:07,753
THE TALKS.

82
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,321
SO I UNDERSTAND WHY THE

83
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:10,021
PRESIDENT DID IT.

84
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:15,494
AND AGAIN WE HAVE A GREAT DEP

85
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:18,664
-- DIPLOMATIC TEAM.

86
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:21,233
THEY WON'T RUSH INTO ANY SUMMIT

87
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,668
IF THERE ISN'T A REASONABLE

88
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:23,368
EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS.

89
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:24,536
>> Sandra: YOU HAVE MIKE POMPEO

90
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:26,605
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR

91
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,539
SCREEN THERE TESTIFYING RIGHT

92
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,875
NOW BEFORE THE SENATE FOREIGN

93
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:30,409
RELATIONS COMMITTEE.

94
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,678
HE WAS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

95
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:33,212
COMMITTEE YESTERDAY.

96
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:34,580
CONGRESSMAN KING, WHAT DOES

97
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,748
THIS DO TO OUR RELATIONSHIP

98
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:37,916
WITH SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA?

99
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:41,153
>> I THINK IT SENDS A MESSAGE

100
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:42,654
TO CHINA THAT DONALD TRUMP,

101
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:43,956
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT JUST

102
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:44,890
INTERESTED IN MAKING A DEAL FOR

103
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,325
THE SAKE OF A DEAL.

104
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:48,427
TO ME IT PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON

105
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:48,727
CHINA.

106
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,762
CHINA HAS A LOT TO SAY HERE

107
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:52,598
ABOUT NORTH KOREA'S CONDUCT AND

108
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:54,733
NOW I THINK THIS CAN PUT MORE

109
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:55,834
PRESSURE ON CHINA TO PRESSURE

110
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:56,969
NORTH KOREA TO COME TO THE

111
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,404
TABLE AND DO IT IN A REALISTIC

112
00:02:59,404 --> 00:02:59,671
WAY.

113
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,874
CHINA CAN BE THE KEY HERE AND

114
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:03,175
SO THIS PUTS PRESSURE BACK ON

115
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:05,043
THEM AND IT SHOWS THEM THAT THE

116
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:06,378
PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS WHEN IT

117
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:06,979
COMES TO NEGOTIATIONS.

118
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,148
>> Sandra: I HAVE TO LEAVE IT

119
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:09,648
THERE.

120
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,016
DO YOU THINK THIS MEETING

121
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:11,717
HAPPENS?

122
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:13,152
>> I WOULD SAY NOT NOW BUT

123
00:03:13,152 --> 00:00:00,000
STILL A GOOD CHANCE OF IT
