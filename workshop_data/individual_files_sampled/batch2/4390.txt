also with us Pulitzer prize-winning historian Jon Meacham Meechum delivered one of the eulogies that Barbara Bush's funeral on Saturday and Joe will begin there and what a great job he did we certainly will yes so many people this weekend talking about Barbara Bush and really agreeing with John's assessment that she really has been for such a long time viewed as America's first lady America said goodbye to Barbara Bush Jon Meacham this weekend you were there and delivered the beautiful beautiful words in her memory talk to us about the event the extraordinary talk to us about the extraordinary man the Barbara Bush lived with for so many years and just talked about the woman you remembered well I was thinking this morning this is the first Monday morning the first week of George HW Bush's life that he's opened without Barbara Bush since 1941 without him without her very much in his life and he was a rock all day Saturday it was what was so interesting to me actually was it was a family funeral that happened to intersect with the American family and the life of the nation and it felt very much like that inside st. Martin's Church in Houston as you know when you're when you're around these presidents and these public servants everything for all the stuff we talk about all the time falls away and you're reminded of the essential humanity of these people these families who yes they asked for the job yes they seek our votes yes they seek ultimate power and in the world's longest experiment and republicanism but there are also families and their people who instinctively reach out respectfully and affectionately and yeah we oh we oh we overused the phrase the end of an era but every once in a while a cliche is true because it's true and this was one it really was and Myka there were there were wonderful moments throughout the weekend that we got to see from the outside and the picture of the presidents and the first ladies certainly there seemed to be something reassuring in that and you had a group of people that I know that most of us have been critical of from time to time throughout our adult lives but never once looking at that picture did we ever question whether everything they were doing even if we disagreed with it they were doing because they believed it was in the best interest of this country the best interest in protecting our homeland the best interest in preserving the Constitution of the United States and that is right now obviously something that many of us do have concerns with with what's going on in this White House but it was maybe an end of an era as far as George HW Bush and Barbara Bush in the world that they occupied in Connecticut and Texas in Washington DC but that picture it seems to me it really does speak a thousand words that what we're going through is not the norm and I suspect that we will be seeing seeing well let's just say be in in in coming years will find presidents that that I think most Americans will be able to unify behind yeah and the picture is reassuring but kind of hard to go from that picture to this thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
