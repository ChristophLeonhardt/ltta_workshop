U.S. EMBASSY OPENS HERE IN
JERUSALEM.
SHANNON?
SPEED WHEN IT IS A BUSY TIME IN
THAT REGION.
BENJAMIN HALL REPORTING LIVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
REACTION TO THE OUTBREAK OF
HOSTILITY, IT HAS BEEN SWIFT.
AMID FEARS THAT IRAN WILL RAMP
UP ITS NUCLEAR AMBITIONS.
>> IF THAT HAPPENS, YOU COULD
HAVE A DRAMATIC ESCALATION OF
CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
TO THE POINT THAT IT WOULD
REALLY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD CONTAIN
FAT CONFLICT OR WHETHER WE ARE
ON THE PRECIPICE OF A WORLD WAR.
>> Shannon: RETIRED FOUR-STAR
GENERAL AND FOX NEWS SR.
STRATEGIC ANALYST
GENERAL JACK KEANE JOINS US
TONIGHT.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHANNON.
>> Shannon: THE SYRIAN WAR HAS
OPENED UP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
IRAN TO MOVE FACILITIES, PEOPLE,
EVEN WEAPONRY INTO SYRIA, GIVING
IT A MUCH CLEANER SHOT AT
ISRAEL.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYS WE WILL
NOT STAND FOR THIS.
"THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
MUST PREVENT THE ENTRENCHMENT OF
THE FORCE IN SYRIA, IRAN CROSSED
A REDLINE AND WE RESPONDED
PROPORTIONALLY."
HOW BIG IS THE PROBLEM?
SPEAK OF THE PROBLEM IS HUGE.
WITH THE IRANIANS HAVE DONE,
SIRI REPRESENTS A STRATEGIC FOR
THEM.
EVERY SINGLE YEAR SINCE THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN WAS
FORMED IN 1980, THEY SAID THAT
THEY INTEND AS A STRATEGIC
OBJECTIVE TO DESTROY THE STATE
OF ISRAEL.
THEY HAVE 130,000 MISSILES AND
ROCKETS IN HEZBOLLAH'S HANDS
RIGHT NOW AND LET GO MY LEBANON.
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS
REPLICATE THAT IN SOUTHERN SYRIA
WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
ROCKETS.
THEY ALREADY BROUGHT IN TO PROP
UP THE ASSAD REGIME TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF THEIR PROXIES.
THAT IS WHY WE SQUANDER THE
OPPORTUNITIES TO PUSH BACK ON
THERE'S A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
IT HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS
PROBLEM, WHERE OUR CLOSE ALLY IN
THE REGION IS BEING THREATENED.
IT'S VERY SOVEREIGNTY IS BEING
THREATENED BY THE IRANIANS.
WHERE ARE WE HEADING WITH HIS?
THE ATTACK THAT THE IRANIAN
SLIDE WAS DONE BY A HEAD OF THE
FOREST, WORKED FOR A KNOWN
MILITARY LEADER, WORKS FOR THE
SUPREME LEADER.
A COMBINATION OF THE CIA AND
SPECIAL OPERATION FORCES.
SO THIS IS A CALCULATED MOVE ON
THEIR PART TO REALLY ENCROACH ON
ISRAEL.
ISRAEL HAS DRAWN A REDLINE,
SHANNON.
THEY WILL GO AFTER THEM.
THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO LET THEM
RAIN MISSILES AND ROCKETS ON
TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM FROM
MULTIPLE LOCATIONS, WHICH WOULD
OVERWHELM THEIR DEFENSES.
IF THAT HAPPENS, WE WOULD HAVE A
WAR WITH ISRAEL AND LEBANON AND
ALSO WITH IRAN.
THERE IS A PATH HERE WHERE WAR
COULD BREAK OUT WITH ISRAEL AND
LEBANON AND IRANIANS, FOR SURE.
>> Shannon: WHAT SHOULD WE
MAKE OF THIS?
IRAN'S PRESIDENT HAS -- WE THINK
OF IT IN TERMS OF THE AYATOLLAH
CALLING THE SHOTS, THE SUPREME
LEADER, BUT HASSAN ROUHANI SAYS
THIS, HE'S TALKED TO THE GERMAN
CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL, SAYING
HE DOES NOT WANT TO NEW
TENSIONS.
"IRAN HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT TO
REDUCE TENSIONS IN THE REGION,
TRYING TO STRENGTHEN SECURITY
AND STABILITY.
THAT'S ALLEGEDLY PART OF A PHONE
CALL THOSE TWO GOUDA.
>> THAT IS A BOLDFACE LIE.
THE FACTS DON'T SUPPORT ANY OF
THAT WHATSOEVER.
THEY ARE NESTLING UP TO THE
EUROPEANS.
THE IRANIANS ARE NOT GOING TO
PULL OUT OF THIS DEAL INITIALLY
BECAUSE IT IS TO THEIR ECONOMIC
BENEFIT TO STAY IN IT.
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE SANCTIONS
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND I
HOPE THEY ARE COMPREHENSIVE AS
THEY POSSIBLY CAN BE, SECRETARY
STEVE MNUCHIN SAID THEY WOULD
BE.
THEY DON'T WANT SANCTIONS FROM
THE EUROPEANS.
THAT IS WHY WHAT THEY WILL STAY
IN A DEAL FOR THE NEAR TERM.
I TRUST THAT OUR SANCTIONS ARE
TOUGH AND I THINK THAT WE ALSO
SHOULD BE SANCTIONING EUROPEAN
COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING
BUSINESS WITH THEM.
WE WORKED FOR MONTHS TO TRY TO
BRING THE EUROPEANS AROUND.
THEY AGREED ON A SECRET SITE
PROBATION BEING REMOVED, THEY
AGREED ON BALLISTIC MISSILES
PROBATION BEING REMOVED, AND
THAT BEING ADDED TO THE NUCLEAR
DEAL.
THEY DID NOT AGREE ON THE SUNSET
CLAUSE AS BEING REMOVED AND THAT
MEANS THAT IRAN HAS A PATHWAY TO
A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
WHY DIDN'T THEY AGREE TO THAT?
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE IRANIANS
WOULD BULK AND AS A RESULT OF
THAT, SANCTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE
IMPOSED BECAUSE THE IRANIANS
WOULD PULL OUT OF THE DEAL AND
THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE
FINANCIAL INTEREST THAT THEY
HAVE IN IRAN RIGHT NOW.
THAT IS THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET
THAT WE HAVE.
NOTICE THAT OUR SUNNI ARAB
ALLIES IN ISRAEL ARE ALL FOR THE
DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT MADE.
THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT DECISION
ENHANCES THEIR SECURITY.
IT DOESN'T DO WHAT SECRETARY
LEON PANETTA IS SUGGESTING, ON
THE CUSP OF POSSIBLY WORLD WAR
III.
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> Shannon: WITH THE EMBASSY
MOVE COMING NEXT WEEK AND TOP
OFFICIALS BEING THERE, IT WILL
BE A PLACE TO WATCH.
CERTAINLY AS THE TENSIONS EITHER
