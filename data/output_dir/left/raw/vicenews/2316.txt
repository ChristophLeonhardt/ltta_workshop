1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,490
there's some of the different orbit

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,020
materials we would call this sausage

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,590
boom it like soil doesn't like water so

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,179
it you can put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water and it</font>

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,769
won't soak in water but it'll soak up

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,470
oil so you have you know diapers and

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,650
pads that they use to mop up the oil

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,810
like they're doing behind us now you

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,460
know they're out there now walking you

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,410
know coring holes and open up slots and

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,390
he's cutting the groove in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ice to</font>

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,670
drain the oil to a collection spot so I

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,340
mean as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can imagine I got one two</font>

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,360
three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six seven eight nine ten</font>

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,980
plus the support crew over there guys

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,320
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> tipard holes trying to cut</font>

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,649
slots to drain the oil and we will get

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,750
you know if we get five gallons of oil

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,460
out of there today it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good day</font>

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,100
for us our production<font color="#CCCCCC"> our recovery of</font>

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,530
oil out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the waters just we're not</font>

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,270
really getting much with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300</font>

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">something barrels out of the pipeline in</font>

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,079
this immediate area less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,260
barrels actually out of the water so

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,850
pretty much what is in the water is

27
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,250
there and going you know we aren't going

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,439
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recover it this isn't out of the</font>

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,990
ordinary for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an operation like this well</font>

30
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,060
don't necessarily cover all of it yeah

31
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,040
majority of it situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> like me never</font>

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'll be clear about that we never</font>

33
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,119
recover all the oil somebody who tells

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,610
you that's telling you stories good

35
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,100
conditions you get half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the oil that</font>

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,930
hits<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water and the spills that</font>

37
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,400
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked on have they been</font>

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,290
pipelines that are pretty old and

39
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,900
infrastructure like all built in the

40
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,369
56th easy so I'm gonna warn you now I

41
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get stuck policy oh but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,680
suggest to you that eighty percent of

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
the pipeline breaks we go or an older

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,909
lines if I were king of the world I'd be

45
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">replacing pipelines and if I with king</font>

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,689
of the EPA but just like I really

47
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,880
helping people replace pipeline but from

48
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,380
a management perspective the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pipeline's</font>

49
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you've worked on it the boulders</font>

50
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,619
yeah the old I mean that's you know we

51
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,360
try to do risk assessments and you know

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,579
contingency planning and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest</font>

53
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,530
factor for risk is the age of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,420
pipeline even though the pipe was

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,790
upgraded in 72 the crossing itself was

56
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,979
from the 50s we need to make an effort

57
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help replace these older lines that's</font>

58
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,239
where we see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most spills that's</font>

59
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,669
where the risk is

60
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,120
from my standpoint is a spill responder

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,110
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a lot more newer</font>

62
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,270
pipelines because we move lots of oil in

63
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,920
this country I mean that's just I drove

64
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,950
to get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here right so you drove to get</font>

65
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,020
out here to come talk to me you know we

66
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,209
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the oil until as long as we do I</font>

67
00:02:26,209 --> 00:00:00,000
would like it in a safer infrastructure
