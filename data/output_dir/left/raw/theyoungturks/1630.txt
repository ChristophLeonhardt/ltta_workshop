1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,500
RECENTLY THERE WAS A
CONTROVERSY WITH MICHAEL COHEN

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,750
ACCEPTING PAYMENTS FROM
NOVARTIS, AT&T, AMONG OTHERS, HE

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,900
OF COURSE IS DONALD TRUMP'S
PERSONAL LAWYER, HE GOT OVER $2

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,410
MILLION FROM THESE PEOPLE AND
THEY WANTED TO INFLUENCE POLICY

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,410
OF COURSE.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,950
FOR EXAMPLE, AT&T
WANTED TO GET THEIR MERGER

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,040
APPROVED WITH TIME WARNER.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,560
HOWARD KURTZ SAYS THAT'S NOT

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,870
THAT BIG A DEAL.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,870
WHY?

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,230
HE MAKES A
GOOD POINT, HEAR HIM OUT.

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,650
LET ME TAKE A BROADER VIEW AND
THAT IS THE MEDIA IS SHOCKED TO

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,530
DISCOVER THAT THERE IS GAMBLING
IN CASABLANCA.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,530
THEY HEAR ABOUT

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,059
THESE BIG COMPANIES -- I'M NOT
DEFENDING THIS PRACTICE BUT DC

16
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:40,609
IS A SWAMPY PLACE, THIS HAS GONE
ON FOR MANY, MANY

17
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:44,960
ADMINISTRATIONS WHERE YOU HIRE
SOMEONE WHO IS A FRIEND OF

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,089
SOMEBODY YOU HAVE HIRED FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU ARE

19
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:53,030
LOOKING FOR ACCESS AND SOMEBODY
WHO CAN CARRY YOUR MESSAGE.

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,920
OKAY, TOTALLY AGREED.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,280
IT
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, WHERE

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,629
CORPORATIONS COME IN AND HIRE A
LOBBYIST, THEY HIRE FRIENDS OF

23
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,309
THE SENATORS, THEY HIRE FAMILY
MEMBERS OF THE SENATORS AND

24
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:06,030
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY HIRE
PEOPLE WHO KNOW PEOPLE INSIDE

25
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,090
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND ON TOP OF
THAT THEY GIVE THEM CAMPAIGN

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,300
CONTRIBUTIONS.

27
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,090
SO IF KURTZ
WANTED TO MAKE A POINT, FOR

28
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,080
EXAMPLE LET'S TAKE A RANDOM
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, DIANE

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,750
FEINSTEIN -- QUICK QUIZ, WHO HAS
GOTTEN MORE MONEY FROM THE

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,410
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY,
MICHAEL COHEN OR DIANE

31
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,870
FEINSTEIN?

32
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:35,680
DIANE FEINSTEIN 
HAS

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,630
GOTTEN OVER $1 MILLION FROM THE

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,170
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY,
INCLUDING AT&T.

35
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,240
OH, BUT THAT'S

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,160
OKAY, THAT'S JUST A CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTION, OR INDEPENDENT

37
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
EXPENDITURE.

38
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,080
BY THE WAY, THAT
DOESN'T EVEN COUNT THE DARK

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,690
MONEY AND THE SUPER PACS.

40
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,080
IN
REALITY SHE ALONG WITH ALMOST

41
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,550
ALL THE OTHER SENATORS HAVE GOT
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BRIBES, I

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,980
MEAN INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES
AND CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, FROM

43
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,940
AT&T, THE TELECOMMUTE NEGATIONS
INDUSTRY, AND JUST ABOUT EVERY

44
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
OTHER INDUSTRY.

45
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,230
SO IS IT TRUE
THAT CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT IN

46
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,229
WASHINGTON?

47
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,229
ABSOLUTELY.

48
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,370
DOES IT
REALLY MATTER IF AT&T PAYS

49
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,450
MICHAEL COHEN OR UNITED STATES
SENATOR?

50
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,450
WHY ARE THEY PAYING

51
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,840
EITHER ONE?

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,340
BECAUSE THEY WANT
THEIR MERGER APPROVED AND THEY

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,980
WANT LOWER TAXES.

54
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,370
DOES ANYONE
THINK THEY ARE DOING IT FOR

55
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,370
THEIR HEALTH?

56
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,420
DOES ANYONE THINK
THEY ARE DOING IT FOR A

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,420
DIFFERENT REASON?

58
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,930
MICHAEL COHEN,
WE WOULD LIKE TO BE CORRUPT, BUT

59
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,319
DIANE FEINSTEIN, WE ARE DOING IT
FOR HEALTH.

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,319
WHEN IT COMES TO

61
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,090
FEINSTEIN AND ALL THE OTHER
SENATORS WE ARE DOING IT FOR

62
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,140
HEALTH AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN
CHARITY BUT MICHAEL COHEN,

63
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,200
THAT'S CORRUPTION.

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,120
DON'T GET ME
WRONG, MICHAEL COHEN, DEFINITELY

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
CORRUPT.

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,380
BUT SO IS PAYING ALL
THE SENATORS AND REPRESENTED US

67
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,960
AND BUYING THEM OFF.

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,480
SO NOW THAT
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS LAWYER GETS

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,569
CAUGHT, ALL OF A SUDDEN HOWARD
KURTZ IS LIKE, NOBODY IS SHOCKED

70
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:04,440
BY THIS, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S A
SWAMP.

71
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
REALLY, HOWARD, DOES

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
EVERYONE KNOW IT?

73
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
IS THAT WHY
YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,210
FOR DECADES AND TV?

75
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,180
NO, YOU
NEVER TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPTION

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,180
OF THE SENATORS AND HOW MONEY
GIVEN BY CORPORATIONS IS TO

77
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,640
MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFIT AT OUR
EXPENSE, YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,370
THAT.

79
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,880
DO OTHER PEOPLE ON CABLE
NEWS TALK ABOUT IT?

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
CNN?

81
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
NEVER.

82
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,349
MSNBC, THE SO-CALLED PROGRESSIVE
CABLE NEWS OUTLET, LAUGH ALONG

83
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:33,500
WITH ME, NEVER.

84
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,030
THEY SAY THE
HONORABLE GENTLEMAN FROM

85
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,061
CONNECTICUT AND CALIFORNIA, AND
THESE ARE ALL GOOD PEOPLE, THEY

86
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:41,560
ARE DEBATING IDEAS -- NO THEY
AREN'T. ARE GETTING LEGALLY

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,840
BRIBED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

88
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,150
SO
YES, IT IS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE

89
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,230
AND THEY ARE ALL AS GUILTY OF
IT.

90
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,090
SO WAKE UP TO WHAT IS

91
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,319
HAPPENING, INCLUDING THE FACT
THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WON'T

92
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,310
COVER IT BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE
BRIBES GO TO TELEVISION ADS, AND

93
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,140
THEY ARE TELEVISION COMPANIES.

94
00:04:02,140 --> 00:00:00,000
WOLF-PAC.COM, GO AND FIGHT
AND FIX THIS PROBLEM.
