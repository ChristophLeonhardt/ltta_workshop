hell Michigan is an unincorporated part of Livingston County Michigan and what they have is this fun little thing where they elect a new mayor every 24 hours and recently a gay resident of Hell Elisha Daniel was elected the mayor I love this guy and he is hilarious now he's a comedian but he used his new political position to make a funny political statement now here's what he tweeted as of today August 30th 2017 I am the legal mayor of hell Michigan this is real I'm the mayor of Hell now here's where things start getting interesting growing up I was always told that homosexuals would go to hell now the heterosexuals are trying to take this from us too as of today I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical heterosexuals out of this town I love it alright so he put this out as a notice on his Twitter account the notice goes on to say that it is that its purpose is to keep straights from coming into the town and procreating having more straight children to take rightfully gay jobs in hell he also wrote has so many layers it's an onion it's so keep on peeling I'm peeling all right he also says I love straights but my number one priority is the safety of my town until the heterosexual threat has been reviewed we cannot allow them to enter until we figure out what the what the hell is going on we can't allow these straights in we just can't I mean what do we we need better vetting oh it's so good okay there's more though there's more he also says yes I am the first US mayor to ban heterosexuality but I hope my act of bravery will inspire fellow politicians to ban straights as well and then he finishes with make he'll gain again no so funny now obviously he's not serious about banning straight people but he's making a really funny he's making a serious political point in a funny way and I give him props for it very clever so first off I mean let's just dissect all the layers as quickly is what you said that hell was for gay people I didn't say it you said right so I I'm trying to do what you say the Bible says now hell is only for gay people well you can't argue with it we're with the dude right and then say in a wall if you say it's discriminatory well that's what you do do to other groups so when he makes the reference to we have to have a serious vetting of these straights and I need hey look safety is my number-one priority in this town exactly what they say about Muslims in the Trump administration and then on the issue of gay rights or straight rights just like no I want to take away straight rights just like you took away gay rights so if you're like outraged by that shouldn't you be outraged too taking away gay rights in the same exact way I mean being straight is a choice it's a choice I mean that's what that's what I hear from the right wing all the time they could go gay they could get into that kind of situation and they would love to but but they've made a choice like this is either or they could go either way they've made a choice to be straight so in hell you got to make a choice too or in this particular town in Michigan you got to make a decision to goes gay if you don't sorry you lost your rights you didn't it's your fault now even though he was meant to be mayor for 24 hours he did get impeached hilarious he says although I enjoyed my time as mayor I've been informed that I've been impeached as mayor of hell this will not affect my presidential run and then he tweeted to Donald Trump saying impeach was fun Donald Trump you should try it I love this guy you're so good it was really funny Lajja Daniel knew American Hero so you can't complain about the guy unless you're willing to do what he asks of in in the other direction so if you say hey you're right do you don't ban straight people we won't pin Gabe or we won't have different rights for gay people and straight people or Muslims and non Muslims or all these different kinds of people that are actually just human beings and we're all the same so the way that he flipped a shoe on the other foot for I can look I know the right-wing mind for a second as they're reading this even though they know it's a joke they were outraged through look you can't do that to straight people well why can't you do it to straight people but you can do it to gave people watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded a stream it watch it anyway you like a TYT Network calm /join
