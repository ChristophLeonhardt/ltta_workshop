it was a painful day for the relatives of those killed in the 1982 war between the United Kingdom and Argentina they traveled to the Falklands that experie die lands the Argentine's called Malvinas to put a name on their loved ones graves last year a forensic study identified the remains of 90 soldiers out of 122 that were buried under gravestones that read Argentine soldier known only to God but on Monday Malala was able to put her son's name to a grave at the Darwin cemetery it's a very strong new feeling because I found my son I was able to speak to him as a mother and ask him questions address him with my feelings with my pain but it is a feeling of peace because now I know where he lies following 36 years of such struggle but now I can come here to Malvinas and be with his cross the identification was possible thanks to an agreement between Argentina and the United Kingdom with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross as a military man this has huge significance to me there is a huge honour between all militaries but I think in particular the British military and the Argentine military there is huge respect form from both sides of what has happened here in 1982 Argentina lost the war with Britain after the military dictatorship in Buenos Aires ordered the invasion of the British controlled archipelago which lies around 500 kilometers of the coast of Latin America the identification of the Argentinean soldiers is seen by many as a step towards the improvement of the relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom a new relationship that will include not only dialog but also cooperation on important issues such as illegal fishing and the search for oil in the southern Atlantic some War veterans continue to insist the islands belong to Argentina but believe that dialogue should prevail we have to negotiate so we never again have war and this is coming from someone who was there through dialogue through agreements and I hope that one day we can travel to the islands without a passport but on Monday it was all about putting the past to rest especially for those who have been waiting to give their loved ones a proper burial for so long terasawa al Jazeera Buenos Aires
