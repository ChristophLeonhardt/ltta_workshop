you really gonna give me a thousand those yeah domination or general election he wins general election okay okay I'm gonna be a man of my word and I'm gonna make that bad what can I do I'm a man of my word so now I explained why I thought that was now the other guys were saying no he's got no chance the more they said it the more I thought he had a chance now as you see in this explanation that not all the details about the policies came to fruition but the general idea was right that they that people were under met estimating Trump's chance of winning because politics is actually simpler than people realize anyway here we are back into October 2015 here was a conversation that's it I'm moving them up to twelve and a half percent chance of winning the whole thing I had him at zero for the nomination I had him at one percent for the nomination I had him at five percent for the nomination tonight I'm moving up to twelve and a half percent not for the nomination but for the general election okay this Republicans love alpha males the guy is keep it simple stupid okay he keeps it simple so that kind of braggadocio clear bully that you hate John lack of intellect lack of any substance they love you're under estimating Donald Trump's ability to change all of his positions that has no principal he has no shame Donald Trump is super right-wing a lot of things now and then when it comes to general election he'd be like what do you mean of course you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna increase food stamps I'm gonna increase a Valentino spree education okay he doesn't care right I'm talking about that guy immigrants I'm keeping them out so I can give a good guy immigrants here and Latinos in the country everything they want chicken in every pot I'm horrified it has no shame right here and by the way a third of his positions are far more progressive than the Republican positions yeah so he may come out and say hey wait I'm the guy who wants to cut who wants to increase taxes on hedge funds well and Hillary Clinton said during the debates that she represents Wall Street now he didn't do all that but he did a lot of it okay so what were my two principle thesis keep it simple stupid Republicans are not that bright they'll like the alpha male that's keeping it simple and Trump has no shame or no principles and that will help him win I'm not saying told you except for the graphic next to me that says told you even down to the him saying oh y'all take away the hedge fund tax breaks just today it is confirmed that even though he did say in the campaign he will not be taking away the tax breaks for hedge fund guys why cuz he has no shame he knew that he just needed to win he didn't actually need to deliver on any of those promises so I'm gonna ask for help here on how much I should make Jimmy pay okay but before I do because I'm the most reasonable man in America I want to show you the very end of that clip and we'll have the link to the whole clip down below as well look away so we go through a ten minute explanation and then Jimmy at the end panics a little bit and says this like that you're getting a little scared so he joked about five to one so let's let's go to the public here let's go to you you guys and you help me decide white tea network.com / the bed how much should Janke make Jimmy pay $1,000 cuz that was the bet $100 for a 10 to 1 bet that's the one we shook on $500 because at the end we said 500 won okay or C come on that was all in good fun let him go let him go don't make him pay you now I'm I think I'm gonna do whatever you guys say okay so this poll actually matters of all the polls we've ever done this probably will have the most effect and Jimmy will probably vote a thousand times so out vote um okay I know which what I'm gonna vote for look we'll see if you guys are you know which way you come out on it I will tell you this if Trump had lost what I've given Jimmy the hundred dollars absolutely right so your call your call and I'm not looking for a pound of flesh overall nothing but fun and Jimmy's great check out his show you're gonna have nothing but fun he was raging during the elections he's still raging today cuz he's right about that you just watched the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network com less joy
