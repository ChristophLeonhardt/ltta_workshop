1
00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:03,205
ya id rather be a lover than a fighter

2
00:00:03,565 --> 00:00:06,345
cause all my life i've been fighting

3
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:09,895
and i've never felt the feeling of comfort

4
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:12,255
all this time iv'e been hiding

5
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:15,525
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah

6
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,015
I'm so used to sharing

7
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:22,465
Love only left me alone

8
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:24,215
But I'm at one with the silence

9
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:28,615
I found peace in your violence

10
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:31,735
Can't tell me there's no point in trying

11
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:33,735
I'm at one

12
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,755
and I've been quiet for too long

13
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:37,655
 

14
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:41,195
I found peace in your violence

15
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:44,655
Can't tell me there's no point in trying. I'm at one

16
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:48,835
and I've been silent for too long

17
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:50,955
 

18
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:56,105
 

19
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:04,605
I found peace in your violence

20
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:07,395
Can't tell me there's no point in trying

21
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:09,055
I'm at one

22
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:11,495
and I've been quiet for too long

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
 

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,260
I'm in need of a savior, but i'm not asking for favors

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,100
My whole life, I've felt like a burden

26
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:23,945
I think too much, and I hate it

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm so used to being in the wrong,

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm tired of caring

29
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:33,715
Loving never gave me a home

30
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,765
so I'll sit here in the silence

31
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:40,855
I found peace in your violence

32
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:43,845
Can't tell me there's no point in trying

33
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:47,095
I'm at one, and I've been

34
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:48,095
quiet for too long

35
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:49,785
 

36
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:52,875
I found peace in your violence

37
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,965
Can't tell me there's no point in trying

38
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:57,435
I'm at one

39
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:01,485
and I've been silent for too long

40
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:03,545
 

41
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:05,995
 

42
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:07,805
 

43
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:09,335
 

44
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:12,195
 

45
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,795
I found peace in your violence

46
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:19,755
Can't tell me there's no point in trying

47
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,765
I'm at one

48
00:02:21,705 --> 00:02:24,615
and I've been quiet for too long

49
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:25,775
 

50
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,845
Thanks for watching!

51
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:33,425
 

52
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,835
 

53
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:39,695
 

54
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,525
 

55
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:45,145
 

56
00:02:45,955 --> 00:00:00,000
