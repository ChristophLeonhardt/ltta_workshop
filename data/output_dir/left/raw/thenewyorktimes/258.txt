1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,870
“My name is Naomi and
I’m 11 years old.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,880
I represent the
African-American women who

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,100
are victims of gun violence.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,375
I’m here to say, 'Never
again,' for those girls, too.”

5
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:18,845
“Never again! Never again!”

6
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:21,190
“Never did I think I
would be herded like cattle

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,500
by a shower of bullets

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,100
that left me scarred and rattled.”

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,150
“My brother, he was
in high school when

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,970
he passed away.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,140
You hear pops thinking
they’re fireworks.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,040
They weren’t pops.”

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,240
My nephew, Daishawn Moore —

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,130
he was taken away on May 28, in the year of 2017,

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,880
two weeks after his 16th birthday.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,960
And to the politicians that believe that their right to
own a gun comes before our lives:

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,570
Get ready to get
voted out by us,

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,750
the future.”

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,330
“In the wake of the
tragedy on February 14th,

20
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,080
we as students, as youths, decided that if adults

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,980
weren’t going to take action,

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,860
we would.

23
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,750
When Joan of Arc fought
back English forces,

24
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,320
she was 17 years old; when
Mozart wrote his first symphony,

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,940
he was 8 years old.

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,080
To those people that
tell us that teenagers

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,430
can’t do anything,

28
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,799
I say that we were the
only people that could have

29
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,965
made this movement possible.”

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,720
“We will not stop until every
man, every woman, every child

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,650
and every American can live
without fear of gun violence

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:27,660
and to that I say, 'No more.'
We can and we will change the world!”

33
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,540
“Today is just the beginning.

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,780
Parkland and the rest of the world
have been sprinting.

35
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,700
But these sprints are just warm-up laps.

36
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,500
As of now, we have officially started
our marathon

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,057
that will last until we make a change
for safer gun policies.”

38
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:07,146
"Save our kids, save our kids."

39
00:03:19,448 --> 00:00:00,000
"Hey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go."
