an explosive new report on the special council's probe has revealed a mysterious additional lead and the investigation of potential collusion The New York Times has now reported that Donald Trump jr. and other trump officials met in addition to the Russians also with an emissary to two Gulf Arab countries and an Israeli businessman to discuss how they could help his father win the 2016 election as The Times notes it's the first indication that countries other than Russia may have offered assistance to the Trump campaign The Times reports quote investigators have questioned numerous witnesses about what foreign help may have been pledged or accepted and about whether any such assistance was coordinated with Russia the meeting in question which took place at Trump Tower in August 3rd of 2016 was arranged by Eric Prince a private security contractor and informal Trump advisor Prince introduced Donald Trump jr. and campaign aide Stephen Miller to Jorge nadir the lebanese-american advisor to the United Arab Republic social media specialist Joel's m/l who proposed his services to help the Trump campaign by the way these parallel the social media effort conducted by the Russians in the 2016 presidential election as The Times reports the plan involve using thousands of fake social media accounts to promote mr. Trump's candidacy on platforms like Facebook it's unclear what kind of help if any was ultimately provided however two people familiar with the meeting said the Trump campaign official did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners an attorney to mr. Amell denied that his clan was involved in the election Donald Trump juniors learners also released this statement saying of the meeting that they pitched mr. Trump jr. on his social media platform or marketing strategy he was not interested and that was the end of it I'm sure right now by Betsy would have reported with The Daily Beast and an MSNBC analyst general Rubens our Washington Post opinion writer an MSNBC contributor enjoy Haynes is a national security reporter with NBC News thank you all let's start with that Betsy tell us what we know about this additional information about Trump's gathering or seeking or accepting or listening to advice from other countries about how to beat Hillary Clinton look this might be the closest piece of evidence yet to the possibility of their having been some sort of illegal activity involving the Trump campaign and people working for foreign governments the federal election campaign law the statute that governs all campaigns in the United States makes it really clear that it is against the law to solicit help from foreign nationals on a campaign I spoke with a campaign attorney earlier today who said that would also include soliciting help from foreign nationals through their emissaries even if his emissaries themselves are US citizens so depending on what happened in that conversation there could have been illegal activity well Jorge Nader jumps to mind as the guy was also involved in that meeting in the Seychelles what is his role he's one of these mystery guys that I served like moving in and out of not sure what country they really are loyal to you're shaking your heads over these sort of transnational figures that seem to be always available for a hustle or something on they on the edge of the illegality here you really don't know who he's working for is he working in this capacity just for this Israeli company does he have some connection to the Russians it seems awful coincidence awfully coincidental that he should also appear in the Seychelles but consider what this meeting means just like that meeting in Trump Tower which was in June a few months earlier you have dime jr. you have a senior member of the campaign this case apparently Stephen Miller the other instance it was not only pound Paul Manafort but the president's son-in-law sitting down with people who represent a foreign government eagerly waiting to be told something that will help their candidate in this case dung Trump become president the United States frankly I think Donald Trump jr. for exactly the reason that Betsy outline has probably also stepped over the line already stepped over the line in the Russia meeting because there he was eager to get the information he started off by asking to be in the meeting what do you got that's sort of solicitation don't you think so this not only makes clear that there's a pattern of doing this but it may be some of the same characters who are involved in much of this these people do get recycled well as I mentioned then you just did Eric Prince and George NATO are best known for holding a secret meeting in January of 2017 with a Russian oligarch over in the Seychelles a remote nation in the middle of the Indian Ocean the reported purpose of that was to establish a back channel between the incoming Trump administration and the Kremlin itself however in his testimony before the House Intelligence when he Prince omitted several facts about how that meeting came about now it it also appears Prince failed to disclose his August meeting at Trump Tower to the committee as well involving the Emirates and this Israeli guy in that testimony prince described having only limited contact with trump campaign officials when asked to confirm that he had no other formal communications or contact with the campaign he replied correct well furthermore he said the only contact he had with Donald Trump jr. was at a campaign event and that he ran into him a couple times during the transition well that does not appear to be accurate and light of what we're now learning sure yeah this reminds me every time we have one of these meetings we hear about with foreigners it's as if it's it's a meeting of accounting talking new business oh we got some new clients possibly here so you got some new we're ringing the bell for new business they seem to be having an open window or door even for anybody coming from some other country that might help them pull it up set against Hillary because it looked like an upside coming then if it was gonna be a win that's right I mean and if we think back to this time an excuse that we've heard a lot is that these are political novices that's something that people loved about Trump as a candidate he was a business guy he wanted to talk to everybody he didn't understand all these very just kind of in the weeds federal election campaign rules that would have kept him from meeting with these people but from our reporting all the way back in December Chris we were told that the Trump campaign was actually briefed and warned that Trump himself was briefed and warned about outside countries trying to intervene in his campaign Russia and others and so when you have that information that you're given as soon as you get the nomination why then would your son and other people close to your campaign be soliciting this kind of advice from foreign countries we don't know how far it went if it was a list of options what they decided to solicit where it ended but it is clear that they had this meeting they looked like they were very much open to the idea much in the same way that they were meeting with other people like the Russians in June of 2016 that this was somewhat a common place I mean and that obviously especially points out is against US law so they can't plead ignorance in this case because as we pointed out they were warned that other countries would be tried with the secrets when the warning coming who gave it and was it before after they'd already been meeting in June with the Trump Tower crowd so I was thinking about that this would have been after the nomination and we know that the convention was in July so technically the Trump Tower piece they could complete ignorance on that but not in this case not in an August meeting that's being reported we understand that this would have come from the FBI from people in the counterintelligence committee or community who would say look we understand from our intelligence that there are efforts to get inside your election and you need to be mindful of these this is right around the time Paul Manafort quit Jennifer in this case ignorance of the law is not an excuse all you have to have for a violation of the campaign law is that you knowingly met with someone who is a foreigner and solicited or received help that Donald Trump jr. definitely did and he may be ignorant he may be foolish but he may also be a law breaker and that's the problem I think the Trump team team is looking at it's no wonder that dong Trump has been blowing up and going nuts over this this is the collusion and we have not just one instance in June in Trump Tower with the Russians but two more countries how many more countries are we going to get to before this is over I can hear a conversation guess what Dad I guess he calls him dead guess what Dad I got some dirt coming on Hillary we could turn this election around this could be the long ball this could do it I can't imagine not telling him that let me go back to Betsy on this in terms of the whole thing the Israeli expert on unmet on social media that was in this meeting we're hearing about right now at the new Trump Tower meeting apparently without laying a playing out a plan very similar the ones the Russian used in terms of these bogus sites all kinds of them out hundreds of them where you can start putting out so much bed comp with like a compliment on your opponent that there's no way to deny it getting into the public mainstream into the bloodstream that's right and social media was an incredibly potent tool that people outside of the United States use to try to influence American elections not just in terms of putting things on social media and now in terms of pushing fake news stories or putting out you you know memes or images that suggest that Hillary Clinton was a criminal and needed to go to prison but Russians actually use social media to organize real life in-person protests related to the campaign and they use social media to organize protests during the transition so social media as a tool is not just constrained to the internet it actually also affects people's real lives where they go in their everyday business and they weren't stirring up our racial conflicts in this country to take advantage of them exactly that's right and so social media is a major vulnerability and it's something that people in the intelligence community are trying to monitor more carefully how is social media being used to try to influence American elections the other piece is important of course is that we have another election coming up in six months and we're just barely now starting to figure out the extent to which bad foreign actors may or may not have tried to attempt try to infiltrate and undermine the American election system space coming good so this is just coming at a really vital point in the American political disallow at the remember elections were the sentence at stake of course in the entire House of Representatives sake Julia what do you make of Rudys putting out the word that he's hopeful it'll be over and over before he what he calls the Comey period the Comey he's got a phrase for it now that in other words 11 days whether likes what hurt Hillary so let's just read it from Tony it was Trump's lawyer Judy Ally is downtown the New York Times that when it comes to the investigation of potential obstruction of justice that portion of the report from lower the special counsel hope stood finished by September 1st if Rudy's correct then appears more has lengthened his timetable to complete the obstruction probe NBC News had previously reported in April that's a month ago that more would say me to finish the report as early as May or as late as July so it's not imminent it's sometime basically in the fall and my question let's go to let's go to Jimmy on this the question is is he really well who's calling this is Rudy talking them into being done by September 1 or is the honestly relaying news from Muller that it's going to be September 1st well that's a good question when when we look at that timeline I want to go back to that story that you showed when we've said that it was as early as May or as late as July that was it a really critical point when it looks like Trump was going to walk away from ever agreeing to a voluntary sit-down with Robert Muller that was shortly after the Cohen raids Trump was furious he had just brought on Giuliani Giuliani had promised to wrap it up soon and Trump didn't want to do an interview and so at this point those negotiations are starting to warm up again we're starting to think that possibly they could agree to a limited set of questions a narrower scope they're having those conversations again and so with the prospect of an interview that would push back the timeline because an interview isn't just existing in a vacuum after people would interview the president first of all they'd have to prepare a lot they do the interview and then they'd have to take that information and go chase it down elsewhere so now that that's back on the table it pushes off the timeline as far as where Giuliani is getting his information we do know that there's often discourse between trumps legal team and Moeller's team but he could also be saying this because he wants to give his client a finite time and Betsy and I talked a lot about how in this case it seems like lawyers want to calm down their client at the time I'm here because I don't want him I think it's Karen feeding anyway Thank You Betsy we have to go Jennifer I'm sorry we have to go to ennifer thank you so much Jennifer Rubin Julie Ainsley and Betsey Woodrow there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube
