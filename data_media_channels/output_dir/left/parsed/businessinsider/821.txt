think of President Trump is the Martin
Luther King of healthcare Oh Geoffrey
when I was a kid granted he did not
introduce the the civil rights bill
because he said it wasn't popular he
didn't have the votes for it etc dr.
King kept putting people in the streets
in harm's way to put the pressure on so
that the town would be introduced and
dr. King was marching for civil rights
because people did look like me
we're being we're being beaten dogs were
being picked on him basic human rights
were being withheld from these peoples
merely because the color of their skin
so let's not equate dr. Martin Luther
King jr. a humanitarian and Nobel Peace
Prize winner to the vagina grabbing
President Donald Trump
