mr. bash welcome so yesterday i want to put up a david korn tweet because he put together a number of allegations the president's thrown out which have gotten us and investigators all a tizzy first it was unmasking is the real scandal no Obama bug Trump that's the real scandal no FISA warrant is the real scandal no uranium one is the real scandal know that behind Foreman and the Trump campaign is a real scandal no Jeremy what's going on here in your view yeah it's distraction bingo Chuck we've got deep state we got witch-hunt we got wires tapped we got unmasking and now we have the word spy gate and the president's really just trying to I don't know if it's distract from those other headlines you reference or just the underlying issue which is that his campaign his inner circle is being investigated very professionally very expeditiously very aggressively by Bob Muller I want to bring up the Donald Trump jr. thing because this was a Chris Coons letter today Hugh Hewitt Chris Coons is not alleging that he did lie to Congress but he put out a transcript I'm gonna read the transcript real quick you're you're a legal guy we've talked a lot about Russia did other foreign governments offer a provide assistance to the Trump campaign Trump jr. none that I'm aware of did other foreign nationals offer to provide assistance to Trump campaign Trump jr. no did you directly or indirectly seek foreign government or foreign nationals assistant for the Trump campaign no are you aware of anyone else seeking foreign government or foreign national assistance for the Trump campaign Trump jr. I'm not now the lawyers statement for Trump jr. seemed to indicate hey it was vague so maybe it will mean he didn't technically lie to Congress do you think Trump jr. has a problem here I think senator Coons is one of the smartest most stable centrist in the Senate and what he did by putting it out was simply he didn't make any allegation just raise the question yes read this read this it speaks for itself there's an explanation that what we have to be forthcoming from Donald Trump jr. as to what the distinction is between what he said and what actually we know to have happened it doesn't mean he was lying it means that it's a very poorly chosen transcript set of words he ought to have been more expansive as sessions ought to have been when he talked about Russians originally be more expansive before Senate Committee not less what do you make of this week in this Spygate I saw you at Lindsey Graham going he wouldn't have called it that and he's not comfortable with that this morning senator Graham said call it a confidential informant do not call it spy gate spies work for foreign governments I'll ask John Cornyn about it tomorrow but it's working it's working in the minds of the public as Spygate president Trump has gotten really good at nicknaming things and the thing I think one of the reasons why he was probably successful on the campaign trail is because we can all tick off crooked Hillary lyin Ted low-energy Jeb the the fact that he understands how to market things he understands how to market ideas this goes into the idea that he is a victim of an overreaching Justice Department he's been saying this over and over again and there's some evidence with polls that Republicans are starting to say hey all of this stuff adds up to something I think in really in reality he's just trying to say this report that Robert Moore is gonna come out with it's you shouldn't listen to it it's a partisan and I think they're trying to get ahead of that Howard every one of his allegations gets debunked but it doesn't mean it doesn't have an impact oh it definitely has a political impact in the world that he cares about which is among his supporters this is a perfect explanation for why he's where he is but the difference between the campaign trail and now is that he wanted some support for the next step he wanted to take against the Justice Department here on this line of inquiry the Spygate line of inquiry he didn't get it the Thundering silence from all the Republicans immediately after that means that this Avenue is effectively blocked it seems like this isn't gonna be the excuse to fire rod rod this is not him he's probing along the wall here looking for one way in to get that done this is not going to be it I don't think Jeremy back I want to go back to Trump Tower to meeting I mean I think that's the best way to describe this now are the August 1 is now Trump Tower 2 let me give you a description here and I'm curious what you think how how the intelligence community would have viewed this so three months before the 2016 election small group gathered at Trump Tower to meet with Donald Trump jr. one was an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation another was an emissary for two wealthy Arab Prince's the third a Republican donor with a controversial past in the Middle East as a private security contractor the meeting was convened primarily to offer help to the Trump team now what that help was you know there's it's not fully is it is it about the campaign itself it was at a quid pro quo for the Iran nuclear deal there's a lot of speculation about the avenues of where which is where this could go how likely would it have been that a meeting like this would have suddenly hit the radar of the intelligence community before the election unclear I actually think the fact that the Intelligence Committee turned its sights on Russian aggression and potentially efforts by the Russians to interfere in the election and ties to US persons meaning people in the Trump campaign means that it had to cost you a very significant threshold if the campaign which is meeting with foreigners you know there's a lot of back and forth between emissaries of foreign governments who come and they say I want to educate you about this issue or that policy issue or hey when you get into office we'd like to talk to you about you know our our situation that's different then we want to come help the campaign that's clearly what the Russians did in the first set of Trump Tower meetings I will put this Chuck the second set of Trump Tower means quite a lower level of concern unless the intelligence community got specific information they collect the specific information that it was directed by government to influence the election I'm curious and for the panel here that's with me do any of you think that it would if they could prove a quid pro quo on pulling out of the Iran deal Hugh does that become problem well that would be hugely I don't think we're close but that there is a sort of that is a whiff of ventilation in there there's a new ontong between Saudi Arabia the Gulf states Bahrain and is Egypt Jordan and Israel that says come together like a Beatles song to come against Iran but if someone paid for that that would be a huge problem I think it was Donald Trump's intuition and he campaigned against the Iran deal from day one well I think the big picture here we keep having to stand back farther and farther Chuck it's like we have to go from thirty to forty to fifty thousand feet to see the whole big picture I think it would have been intelligence community malpractice for people in our organizations not to have worried about the Trump campaign what it would reach out to do and what it might attract by way of interesting donors from the very beginning everybody knew that the banks in New York wouldn't lend him money that other people in the construction industry wouldn't let him money that after his bankruptcies in in in Atlantic City he was scouring the world for cash they had to have known about that even before that so yeah did he put the whole campaign up for sale that's the question you know you mean Bob Muller may find this network and what Howard's alleging is there that it looks how it smells and it looks like that this was for sale or that was for sale and all this stuff but it doesn't it isn't connected it isn't Russian collusion it isn't that that's survivable for president Trump uh it depends because it depends on who goes down if it's some if it comes Jared Kushner and it's son and some of the people that are even more close because we already have 19 people indicted that could be problematic for the president because then if he pasta then charts are giving out pardons to his children I think that that becomes a political problem that this president will have that will be unlike what the president has faced in the past and I think that the idea is that Robert mother and I think why President Trump hates this investigation yes there's the collusion issue but all of these people with all these complex financial issues means that Robert Muller if he goes digging is gonna find something and obviously he's already finds found something because five people have pleaded guilty no this feels like he's found a lot more Hugh but it may not be all on the initial mission like that's the confusion had President Trump is going to end up carrying around the Inspector General's report he's gonna carry it under his army Howe Attorney General as a hoe read this one not that one oh I think I think it's not as convinced the IG report is going to be as helpful to just one side put it that way interesting for what it's worth Jeremy I want to ask you one final question here and it says it's the specificity and this goes to the Roger stone WikiLeaks situation it's the specificity of his denial that I that frankly I think we're all trying to read and he said this to me I had no advance notice of the content source or the exact disclosure time of the WikiLeaks disclosure Assange himself has said so in fact the Sanchez said in his own tweets and in interviews that Roger stone never predicted anything and already said in public that's what he said to me what do you read into that what's missing in that denial in your view well WikiLeaks is an agent of the Russian Federation even Mike Pompeo when he was CIA director made that clear and it's clear to the US intelligence community that WikiLeaks has been controlled by the Russian Federation and they're an effort to basically put information into the u.s. political system to do Russia's bidding and so the question isn't did he have advance notice of the content and all those specific caveats is did he reach out and try to say hey look we're interested we want to know what you're doing we welcome it if he welcomed it and there was connectivity then it's another one of the meetings between the Russian intelligence services and Trump officials and it's you know the question is did the president know about it this with Bob Mahler he'll give the answer but I want to end with it a question that Phillip Baum wrote today in the Washington Post which is this if there was all this collusion why were they why did they have to keep asking Julian Assange about the clay Hillary Clinton emails collusion thus far proven but what I've always been wondering somebody organized those emails for Julian Assange and that somebody had to be an American they was too well curated when it came out they knew which reporters to target which days it was well organized it wasn't a typical WikiLeaks Tom I've always thought who helped and I wonder if that's what they're asking Roger stone about all right guys Jeremy bash thank you very much when you meet Howard I love the way he was looking at me he's like he goes they know the American media landscape as well as we're driving around in the
