well we will finally be covering the Seth rich conspiracy turns out there is one but not in the ways that some people thought so if you don't know Seth rich was a person who worked at the DNC he unfortunately was killed and police say it was during an attempted robbery now that set off a lot of conspiracies because people started saying that he is the one who had leaked the DNC emails to WikiLeaks well it's not just people we know who it was and now there is a shocking twist in the story now Fox News had put that story out in the first place they have now retracted it the guy who put it out whoa among the people who put it out and did an investigation on a for Fox News was a guy named rod wheeler well rod wheeler is now suing Fox News saying you guys said I had some information on this investigation when I didn't you made up my quotes Wow and he is revealing what was the actual conspiracy which was to lie about Seth Rich's murder in order to distract from the Russian investigation so who is the guy who put him up to it according to the lawsuit it is a guy named IDI Buttowski he also goes on Fox News from time to time but mainly he's a very wealthy Republican donor so he contacted wheeler whose expertise is law enforcement he was former homicide detective and now is a crime analyst on Fox News so Buttowski calls rod wheeler and says hey we're looking to the seth rich story and in fact even the president is interested in it now that is going to be super relevant we're gonna get to that a little bit later in the story now wheeler a Fox News commentator and private investigator hired by wealthy right-wing investor at burtowski to investigate the murder in May claimed to have evidence of contact between rich and WikiLeaks and alleged that police were covering it up so those are some pretty heavy charges and he said that's what burtowski told me and and we went to go investigate that now the person who wanted eventually reporting it on Fox News was a person named Malia Zimmerman she's a so-called reporter for Fox News now she is not an opinion host she's supposed to be straight news for Fox News now she had two quotes from rod wheeler in the story rod wheeler now says they were wholly made-up he that he never said these things so here is the original story from Zimmerman my investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between seth rich and wikileaks said wheeler wheeler now says no I never said that another part of the story my investigation shows someone within the DC government a Democratic National Committee or Clinton team is blocking the murder investigation from going forward wheeler said that is unfortunate Seth Rich's murder is unsolved as a result of that now think about how atrocious this is they're basically implying that either someone at the DNC or Hillary Clinton's team murdered someone else that was part of the DNC team Seth rich and is now using the police to cover-up that murder first of all that's nuts second of all it didn't happen they made it up and third of all what I mean you were accusing them of murder but I don't know have they no shame and I guess the answer to that is of course they don't and I guess now rod wheeler realizing that he got played thinks oops I didn't know they were gonna make up quotes about me and I didn't know what the plot was from the first place so now they take Zimmerman's what does Fox News do next News do next they take Zimmerman's article and they run wild with it this Sean Hannity comes and says this quote blows the whole Russia collusion narrative completely out of the water aha now we get to why they're doing this in the first place because they think if we can distract people and get them to think that the Russians didn't put out those stolen emails it was that guy Seth rich and then Hillary Clinton had him murdered well then obviously it wasn't Russia so we're done with it and we'll land a investigation first of all what a dumb dumb plot it was uncovered right away that this part about how they set it up and who they send out with but the fact that it was false was immediately apparent and even Fox News had to retract the story so now we find out the details of how they made it up so now we'll go to David Fulton Phil cat NPR wheeler alleges he was told the Trump administration was monitoring their progress whoa okay this takes it to a whole different level and this is not something we knew before so apparently this went all the way up to Sean Spicer they had a meeting but Taos key did and and the guys working on this from Fox News with Sean Spicer at the time the White House press secretary Spicer now confirms that they had that meeting and he said well I mean Bartowski is a wealthy Republican donors so I did him a favor and I took the meeting it doesn't mean anything and you know you can judge for yourself if you believe Sean Spicer is part of it but whether the president's involved is also something that's going to come up in a second but Spicer and the White House definitely did take a meeting with the guys who made up the South Ridge story so now back to NPR Doug Witter wheelers lawyer is now claiming that his client quote unfortunately was used as a pawn by Ed burtowski Fox News and the Trump administration to try and steer away the attention that was being given about the Russian hacking of the DNC email so that was the whole point of this in the first place let me do a quick timeline for you guys so you understand exactly the context here and this is from media / NPR in here so those two news organizations had this in his report folk and Phil provides a stunning timeline of how the report came to be according to the lawsuit May 9th Trump fires FBI director James Comey who was overseeing an investigation into the Russian election meddling May 10th sermon and Buttowski call wheeler to say they have an FBI source confirming emails were sent from seth rich to wikileaks we now know of course that's not true in May on May 11th Zimmerman sends wheeler a draft of her story which is to run initially on the network website it includes no quotes from wheeler and later of course she inserted the fake quotes May 14th according to these allegations May 14th burtowski sends an email to Fox & Friends host Ainsley Earhardt Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade quote coaching them on how to frame the rich story in the email but tao-tsay claimed the story would refute the notion of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia and finally on May 15th Fox & Friends covers a story in the morning after it was published on Fox news.com on affiliate Fox 5 DC it goes national before unravelling completely wheeler would later claim that the quotations the Zimmerman's report were quote fabricated and untrue so now we know Spicer at least took a meeting but was the president involved well we have text sent from Bartowski to rod wheeler it is now in evidence the text says quote not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article he wants the article out immediately it's now all up to you but don't feel the pressure in other words if Buttowski is right and I hope the authorities talk to him and get him on the record and under oath if Buttowski was telling the truth there it went all the way up to the president now by the way it would not be the first time that the president got involved in his own PR historically he's done that many times including the story that just came out today about how he helped to write Don Jr statement on the Russian lawyer meeting that he had so now back to law news even after we lore presented his concerns regarding the allegedly fabricated quotes the Fox News he was told to think of the story as an important political narrative that would replace the Russia's story and that he needed to quote stick to the script man there is a ton of stuff to investigate here so I hope that investigators are getting busy figuring out who did this because there's some pretty serious stuff the accusation at foxnews.com published Malia Zimmerman's story to help the track from coverage of the Russian collusion issue is completely erroneous according to Jay Wallace that is fucking Fox as president but listen that court carefully was certain in a very lawyerly way they're saying the accusation that this story was done to help the Trump administration is false they are not saying they didn't make up the story they're not saying that they weren't involved with Buttowski they're not even saying that they didn't make up the rod wheeler quotes they're just saying well you can't read our mind so you don't know for a fact that we were trying to help the Trump administration you can tell in their denials because they check with their lawyers if they did it or not that is a non-denial denial it gets better there's one more from their statement from their denial that gives you a sense of what they actually have he they said we have no evidence that rod wheeler was misquoted by Zimmerman they didn't say he was he wasn't misquoted they said we have no evidence that he wasn't misquoted that he was misquoted so in other words I didn't investigate it so right now I don't have any evidence that we made it up they're not denying it they're just saying I don't have the evidence yet that is a terrible denial well how about Bartowski because he's probably gonna stand up for this is not going to hiding or anything and tell us the truth right well interesting here's a tweet Edie Bartowski appears to have deleted his Twitter account this morning which probably won't please a judge might be destroying evidence and you can see there if you go to his Twitter account it says sorry that page doesn't exist by the way when are you guys going to learn people can get your old account and all the tweets in it so stupid why don't you just plant a giant red flag on your account going here check this out I'm trying to destroy evidence gee I wonder if he's guilty but I love his excuse you're gonna love it too on the phone with Ed Bukowski he tells me he's suspending his own Twitter account temporarily because quote people are so mean yeah that's probably why not because if the investigation is going on about all the lies that you made up and how it might be connected the Trump administration and Fox News know it's just cuz people are mean on Twitter you just found that out by the way okay you must be a real investigator no wonder you were a Fox News analyst and then finally the lawsuit quotes a May 14th voicemail Bartowski left reveal wheeler claiming he had quote the full attention of the White House on this but Bukowski now assists he was joking it's the excuse they use every time after getting caught red-handed saying something terrible or misleading or lying that's just a joke it's so funny when I tell you that the president is reading your article you should immediately print it and you should make sure that you take off all the pressure from him on the Russian investigation what a funny joke that is a miserable defense please try that in court please if
