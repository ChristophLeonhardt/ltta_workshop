who is it that's the question of the night who did it who is the author of the New York Times op-ed piece who the president calls gutless and anonymous and is now demanding that the New York Times must turn over that person to the government that person has already been turned over to the government by Donald Trump Donald Trump chose the person who wrote today's op-ed piece that has become the president's obsession it's one of Donald Trump's best people we've got the best paper I know the best people we're gonna use our best people the best people the best people I know guys that is so good and now their gut les it's one of them and it's someone who knows what the cabinet was thinking early on about possibly invoking the 25th amendment to remove Donald Trump from the presidency The Times used only the words senior official to describe this person so a member of the cabinet or someone who is in the room with members of the cabinet all the time a cabinet-level official the person still works there so it is not the first SEC the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or HR McMaster at Reince Priebus or former economic adviser Gary Cohen who does appear to be a significant source of Bob Woodward's new book which is a detailed book length version of the op-ed piece that describes an incompetent irrational president whose staff is constantly manipulating him and in the words of the op-ed piece quote working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations it's easy to dismiss most of the cabinet right off the bat because most of them have never demonstrated even the slightest disagreement with the president and most of them have never publicly demonstrated the capacity for the kind of thinking about government and how it should work that is demonstrated in this op-ed piece so it's not Steve minuchin or Wilbur Ross or Ben Carson or Rick Perry or Betsy DeVos or Linda McMahon who ran a wrestling business before becoming a senior official in the Trump administration there is every reason to believe that the author of the piece is an experienced politician who knows the workings of Washington well and knows how to deal with the New York Times at the highest levels that leaves out almost everyone else James mattis yep sessions ryan's inky sonny perdue Alex a czar and so that leaves us with a short list that includes people like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Director of National Intelligence dan coats and ambassadors of united nations nikki Haley the New York Times did use the word he to describe the author of the piece but they have since tried to walk the back-back that gender disclosure saying that it's the quote the use of the word he was an error but there are very few senior officials in the Trump administration who are women and nikki Haley works in New York City she is not in Washington often enough to be accepted by The Times as an authority of what's really going on inside the Trump White House day-to-day and nikki Haley has a future or at least wants to have a future in Republican politics so nikki Haley would never take the chance of destroying her career in Republican politics by being exposed as this author eventually will be as the betrayer of Donald Trump inside the Trump administration at the highest level that brings our guessing game down to Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence the op-ed piece has a heavy emphasis on foreign policy take foreign policy in public and private president Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia and North Korea's leader Kim jong-un and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us two allied like-minded nations the rest of the administration is operating on another track one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly and we're allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals both Mike Pompeo and Dan Coates have said in no uncertain terms that Russians directed by Vladimir Putin did indeed attack our 2016 election dan coats and Mike Pompeo are both doing what is described in that section of the op-ed piece calling out Russia for meddling and advocating sanctions against Russia the piece says the president quote expressed frustration that the United States continued to impose sanctions on the country for its malign behavior but his national security team knew better such actions had to be taken to hold Moscow accountable this isn't the work of the so-called deep state it's the work of the steady state and so the one unit inside the Trump administration that is called out for specific praise in this op-ed piece is the national security team Mike Pompeo and Dan Coates are members of the national security team Mike Pompeo served as the trump CIA director before becoming the trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Dan Coates are both former members of Congress they're both men who successfully ran for federal office campaigned got out there made speeches Mike Pompeo became a member of the House of Representatives dan coats first entered the House of Representatives and then was elected to the Senate the op-ed piece has a flow in a suite to it that resembles a political speech the op-ed piece is a campaign speech against Donald Trump it has the high mindedness of an ambitious campaign speech both Mike Pompeo and Dan Coates are capable of the kind of thinking and phrasing and pacing that went into this campaign speech against Donald Trump but only one of them has no expectation of ever making a campaign speech again in his life Mike Pompeo is an ambitious former member of the Republican House of Representatives who is 54 years old and has he hopes a bright political future ahead of him in his dreams he would become the second former CIA director elected President George HW Bush was the first and so Mike Pompeo has a future in Republican politics too protect which leaves us with 75 year old Dan Coates who knows that Director of National Intelligence is his last job in government dan coates was a reliable Republican senator who could be counted on in every party line vote as a senator he always cared about things like deregulation tax cuts increased military spending which happened to be the only three Trump agenda items that get positive mention in the op-ed piece dan coates idea of a leader was Ronald Reagan who was elected to the presidency when dan coates was elected to the House of Representatives and his friend Bob Dole that was a leader - Dan coats Bob bill was the Republican leader of the United States Senate when dan coates was a senator and dan coates is the only member of the Trump administration who has ever had public moments like this moments after the president appeared to be siding with Vladimir Putin over you you personally by name you stood up and spoke out I'm wondering why did you do that I'm not surprised we're starting with Russia I was just doing my job just doing my job that is what I watched n coats do every day that I worked in the United States Senate in the 1990s he was just doing his job I disagreed with him on almost every policy question but he appeared to be a serious Republican senator trying to do his job he wasn't one of the first people reporters would go to when there was breaking news in the Senate but he is one of those people now we have some breaking news the White House has announced on Twitter that Vladimir Putin is coming to the White House in the fall again you vitomir Putin yeah okay that's gonna be special were you aware of that just want to clarify I think I might based on my reaction I wasn't aware of that well would you recommend that there not be a one-on-one without no takers if I were asked that question I would look for a different way of doing it the dan coates who I watched at work every day in the United States Senate is not someone who could easily abide a Donald Trump in the presidency and so based on the process of elimination you have just seen and based on the content of the op-ed piece which delivers specific praise to only one person by name and that person is Dan Coates old friend and the United States Senate Senator John McCain my guess my educated guess is that the author of the New York Times op-ed piece is John McCain's old friend Dan coats the New York Times says that the author of the piece approached the newspaper through an intermediary recently it sounds like the approach came after John McCain died 11 days ago I'm sure Dan coats has been thinking about John McCain a lot recently and he has probably been asking himself what would John McCain do and Dan coats might have finally decided that what John McCain would do or what he would want Dan Coates to do would be to tell the American people the truth of what they needed to know about the President of the United States I'm wondering when you watch that in Helsinki what was your gut reaction watching him validate Vladimir Putin's assessment over yours well my thoughts there were that I believed I needed to correct the record for that that this is the job I signed up for and that was my responsibility obviously I wished he had made a different statement but I think that now that has been clarified based on his late reactions to this and so I don't think I want to go any further than that that was as far as Dan Coates was willing to go publicly two months ago today I think maybe Dan Coates went further than that a lot further let the guessing begin the Washington Post says the donald trump has narrowed his list of suspects of who wrote that op-ed piece to people who work quote on national security issues or in the Justice Department and I for once agree with Donald Trump I think if someone works on national security issues and I think it's Dan Coates so who did it we'll ask our guest joining us now Jennifer Rubin the conservative opinion writer at the Washington Post and MSNBC contributor Jason Johnson politics editor at The Root comma and MSNBC contributor and Ron Klain is back with us and Ron I'm gonna let you go first because I started tweet from you earlier today saying that you had a guest on this we have not shared notes I have no idea what your guess is you had no idea what mine was until I just revealed my big Dan Coates guest with the big wind up to it Ron Klain who wrote it so Lawrence I also said that tweet at someone I share something in common with and that's my fellow Hoosier Dan Coates there you go I share you're guessing for a lot of the same reasons I mean he's someone for whom there is no love lost between him and Donald Trump one of the few members of administration to publicly differ with the president as you say you have to be from the national security team to write that piece it sites our handling of Russia is a success no one but someone from the national security team would think that and then it does have this political overlay the language about free markets and free people that the embracing of tax cuts is a major success that's a Republican politician and then the the ending kiss for John McCain so you have that all up I think it fits dan coates like a glove with the final point that he is near the end of his career doesn't really care about the consequences I do think all the signals point to at being former senator coats Jason Johnson go ahead so in high school we learned the theory that Shakespeare was Shakespeare actually an individual was actually a collection of people who put things together oh I don't think there was one person I actually thought it was Mike Pompeo and probably someone like either Sarah Huckabee Sanders or Kellyanne Conway here's the reason why I always I agree with you Lawrence it was somebody in the sort of the national security apparatus but the language was so flowing the language was so flowering the use of the word lodestar which had people running off after Mike Pence you need a communications expert to put this together as well so I actually think while one person they may use he or she from the New York Times I actually think this was probably put together by two or three members of the administration who are all concerned who can then also say they have plausible deniability I would just footnote that with a career senator like dan coates has the people at his side who could help him polish that and it was very polished a Jennifer Rubin who do you think I think it's someone one level down it was very interesting that Jennifer Palmieri who as you know worked in the White House and said you know I'm pretty familiar with the sourcing rules for the New York Times it could be someone much lower down and that to me makes more sense in one respect because of this there was one phrase in their free markets free people free ideas that's a Russell quote that's kind of a brainy wonkish deputy or undersecretary type I think either in the State Department or perhaps working with Dan Coates it's not the guy at the top of the food chain and it is someone who would have had a lot of contact with Trump maybe made overseas trips with him maybe have been in the room with cabinet officials but that to me makes a lot more sense and as you point out that language doesn't sound like Dan Coates who's kind of a by-the-book kind of guy now the problem is of course even when their name is on an op-ed the people don't necessarily write their own material they have speechwriters and they have staffers but on something like this I don't think the person is gonna trust another person to write it because that's one more person to identify am so I'm going with a State Department or a natural security deputy kind of person who's one level down well I think every member of the cabinet and every senior official can expect their next question they get from a reporter to be did you write that up edie piece and we're gonna see people saying no and we might have someone refused to answer and that person rockets to suspect number one as soon as that happened
