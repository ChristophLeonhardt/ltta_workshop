from Raymond another Catholic question but this this one's pretty good Michael since you're a Catholic allow me to ask this why do y'all worship false idols I know the candle burning is from African voodoo but Saints elected by men Mary isn't divine you can't gain admission to heaven through your works you do good works because you are godly and saved why do you call priests father they're not your father God is the father then you have an earthly father but priests aren't him sounds pretty contrary to Christianity I don't know if Raymond is just some arch Catholic who's trolling me with this with this letter but maybe not there's a lot of confusion about the Catholic faith I think that's why the majority of the mailbag questions are about that so let's go through all of your objections Raymond and I will dispel your confusion beginning with candle burning as some part of African voodoo the fluorescent lightbulb is a relatively new invention for most of history everybody everyplace used candles to light the way and by the way candle light gives off a much more beautiful light than does Al Gore's stupid light bulbs with mercury on them so I think the candles are fine I don't think it's confined to African voodoo I think it's the way to illuminate the world other than the Sun and the Son of God Saints are not elected by men that's absolutely true very often people say well Catholics worship Saints and that's idolatrous or polytheistic or something Saints are those who have everlasting life in Christ Saints are referred to in many instances in the Bible and the church acknowledges that certain people are Saints through a process called canonization so that's not all the Saints there there are more people in heaven than the church is called Saints but some we know are in heaven and the way we know this is because of the Magisterium of the church that is based on a number of scriptural instances but in particular Jesus says to Peter you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church whatever you bind in heaven of whatever you bind on earth will be loosed by bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth will be loosed on in heaven you have the keys to the kingdom of heaven so there is an authority that Christ is giving to Peter and and then to the Apostles to have some say and to to bind and to loose and have the keys to the kingdom of heaven so by definition Saints have everlasting life we ask Saints to pray for us now sometimes people say you're praying to the Saints you're worshiping the Saints that isn't the case we ask people to pray for us all the time we go in and we say hey you know Bob is having surgery next week can you pray for us hey I'm going through a rough time please keep me in your thoughts and prayers what you're asking for is a sort of intercession but you're asking it to regular old fallen crummy people you're asking me to pray for you I'm not even Catholic I know I am well I'm praying for Marshall really for many reasons not just as heresy and so why would you be comfortable asking Joe Schmo to pray for you but you're not comfortable of asking people that we know have life by definition they're alive they're the people who are living they have everlasting life it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me I think it's a just a misunderstanding of what it means to pray next point Raymond has is Mary isn't divine that's true the church has never said Mary is divine sure we agree you're I think that's a straw man you can't gain admission to heaven through your works yeah it's also right the church has never held that you can gain admission to heaven through your works the church has actually explicitly condemned this as a heresy this was a fifth century era was it was a heresy developed in the fifth century by Pelagius the Pelagian heresy why do we call priests father only God is the father if we call anyone else other than our daddies father then that's diminishing God I don't see any scriptural basis for this at all the Bible is replete with examples of people being referred to as father who are not literally the parents of children but who are in positions of spiritual authority and responsibilities just to go through a few in Genesis Genesis 45 8 so it was not you who sent me here but God and he has made me a father to Pharaoh and Lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt that's Joseph in job I was a father to the poor and I searched out the cause of him whom I did no in Isaiah in that day I will call my servant le Hakeem the son of Hilkiah and I will clothe him with a robe and will bind a girdle on him and will commit authority to his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem into the house of Judah and finally st. Paul and first Corinthians says I do not write this to make you ashamed but to admonish you as my beloved children for though you have countless guides in Christ you do not have many fathers for I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel I don't think that all of those scriptural examples are heresy or blasphemous or disrespectful to God at all you know one aspect of this where it ties back to politics is I reject ideologies per se obviously we indulge them a little bit but the one thing I know about ideologies is that they're not true the reason that ideologies are not true is because they're rationalized abridgements of tradition of reality they can't possibly comprehend all of reality and so the one thing that I know about religious sects founded by men is that they aren't true and they aren't true because I can understand them and if I can understand them then they aren't they aren't true they're clearly founded by men I can't I can understand Calvinism I cannot understand the Catholic Church which for many people would be the reason why they would be Calvinists for me it's the reason I'm a Catholic because if I can't understand it then there's a fair shot it wasn't founded by men if Noah nobody in history has really been able to encapsulate and understand this thing it's a good evidence that perhaps it was as it says instituted by Christ on earth GK Chesterton converted to Catholicism for precisely this reason he said that all these different sects are attacked for being too conservative or too left-wing or to this or to that but only the Catholic Church is attacked for both at the same time it's attacked from all sides which might suggest that it has the the right idea and just to hit this point because a lot of the questions you brought up I think could be answered with a googol result I I Google these things all the time if you're worried is that something isn't clear then I think you should look a little harder because shallows are clear shallow religion is clear shallow thinking is clear profound things are deep and murky that isn't my line that's the line of father rut ler it makes a very good point if something is so clear that you or I can understand it I'm skeptical I'm skeptical of it and I think we should approach our politics and certainly our human interactions and absolutely our are off or God with that same humility on that note I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show try to survive the weekend we'll be back on Monday and I will see you then
