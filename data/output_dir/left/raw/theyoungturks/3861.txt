1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,470
OFTENTIMES AFTER A NATIONAL
TRAGEDY HITS POLITICIANS

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,380
ARE TOLD THEY SHOULD NOT EXPLOIT
THAT TRAGEDY FOR POLITICAL

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,380
REASONS.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,999
A RECENT EXAMPLE IS DONALD TRUMP
TRYING TO PUSH FOR HIS TAX CUTS

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:23,310
BY USING HURRICANE HARVEY AND
HURRICANE IRMA AS EXAMPLES.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,869
KEEP IN MIND THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

7
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:29,850
PROGRAMS WHO HAVE SPENT A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,180
AND TIME TO HELP PROVIDE RELIEF
TO VICTIMS OF THESE STORMS.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,190
THAT TAKES MONEY.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,260
IT IS WHY IT IS A CURIOUS
ARGUMENT MADE BY TRUMP THAT

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,190
THESE TAX CUTS WOULD ACTUALLY
HELP AMERICANS WHEN IT

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,309
COMES TO THESE TYPES OF
TRAGEDIES.

13
00:00:48,309 --> 00:01:04,590
HE PROBABLY PUSH THE RED
BUTTON AFTER HE TWEETED THAT.

14
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,190
PEOPLE ARE REALLY SUFFERING
AND THEY NEED RESOURCES, SO

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:16,230
LET'S CUT TAXES SO WE WON'T HAVE
THE RESOURCES TO HELP THEM OUT.

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:24,430
JUST TO GIVE YOU NUMBERS ON HOW
DISASTROUS THIS HAS BEEN.

17
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:32,710
THIS IS ACCORDING TO A
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE.

18
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,390
ALSO KEEP IN MIND TRUMP DID NOT
USE THIS STORM TO PUSH A

19
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:50,740
POLITICAL AGENDA.

20
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:57,360
HE IS SOMEHOW POLITICIZING THE
STORM TO SUPPORT HIS PROPOSAL TO

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,470
CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY GOT IN
SOME CASES I THINK IT MAKES

22
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:09,320
SENSE TO USE A CRISIS OR TRAGEDY
TO MAKE A POINT.

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,300
I THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE A REALLY
GOOD OPPORTUNITY HERE TO

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,580
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE
CHANGE AND HOW THESE STORMS

25
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,800
WILL BECOME MORE SEVERE AND
WILL HAPPEN MORE OFTEN IF WE

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,450
DON'T DO SOMETHING TO CUT CARBON
EMISSIONS.

27
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,641
BUT TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND IS
LIKE YEAH, CUTTING TAXES IS

28
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:32,340
ACTUALLY GOING TO HURT SO LET ME
EXPLOIT THESE STORMS TO CUT

29
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,630
TAXES.

30
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,700
WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING IF
WE DID SEE SOMETHING LIKE A HUGE

31
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,260
TRAGEDY AND SAY THIS IS WHY WE
NEED SINGLE-PAYER MEDICARE.

32
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260
THEY DON'T DO THAT THOUGH.

33
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,420
WHEN THE BE GREAT AFTER A BIG
CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE TO SAY

34
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:03,760
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?

35
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,850
IT IS NEVER HAPPENING BECAUSE
DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO BEHOLDEN

36
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:17,840
TO THEIR DONORS WHICH IS WHY
THEY CAN'T STAND UP FOR ANYONE.

37
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,970
I FEEL LIKE USUALLY WHEN
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS,

38
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:31,040
COMMON SENSE SAYS WHAT CAN WE DO
TO MITIGATE IT IN THE FUTURE?

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,560
FOR SOME REASON IF DEMOCRATS TRY
TO FIND SOLUTIONS AS SOON AS A

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:45,709
TRAGEDY STRIKES THEY ARE
IMMEDIATELY CRITICIZED AS

41
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,280
POLITICIZING THE TRAGEDY.

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,540
EITHER YOU ARE INCREDIBLY WEAK
AND SO AFRAID OF CRITICISM

43
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,990
THAT YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR
YOU JUST NEVER REALLY

44
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,810
BELIEVED IN THESE POLITICAL
ISSUES YOU CLAIM TO SUPPORT.

45
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,490
BOTH OF THOSE ARE TERRIBLE.

46
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,569
I THINK THAT IS PART OF WHAT
IS WRONG WITH OUR SOCIETY.

47
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,370
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A
NATURAL DISASTER AND YOU

48
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,460
KIND OF SAY WE REALLY NEED TO
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE YOU

49
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,880
ARE NOT POLITICIZING ANYTHING.

50
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,970
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A
WORTHY CAUSE THAT IS 100%

51
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,769
NECESSARY FOR THE PLANET.

52
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,690
THAT IS WHAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS,
IT CAUSE THAT IS NECESSARY

53
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,380
FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE PLANET.

54
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:32,020
TRYING TO USE A NATURAL DISASTER
AS A REASON FOR TAX BREAKS IS A

55
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,250
RIDICULOUS CLAIM THAT INVOLVES
SO MUCH MENTAL GYMNASTICS IT

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,260
WOULD TAKE 12 NOVELS TO JUSTIFY
IT.

57
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
RIGHT.

58
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,380
I WANT TO GIVE YOU GUYS SOME
STATS.

59
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:55,040
WE WILL GET TO THE CLIMATE
SCIENCE AND A SECOND.

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,570
I WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT THESE
TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY WILL

61
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,410
ACTUALLY DO TO THESE GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE

62
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,750
RELIEF TO STORM VICTIMS.

63
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:17,970
HERE IS WHAT TRUMP PROPOSES WHEN
IT COMES 

64
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,880
TO TAXES.

65
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:38,290
BUT IT IS MUCH NICER TO BUILD
MOATS AROUND OUR ESTATES

66
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,070
AND HAVE THE POOR LIVING IN THE
STREETS.

67
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,380
LET'S GET TO HOW THIS WOULD
IMPACT HURRICANE RESPONSE.

68
00:05:49,380 --> 00:06:13,180
CHUMS BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD LEAD
TO SOME FUNDING CUTS.

69
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,419
THE COAST GUARD HAS DONE QUITE A
BIT OF IMPORTANT WORK FOR

70
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:22,240
THE VICTIMS OF HURRICANE HARVEY
AND IRMA.

71
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,980
HOWARD TAX CUTS GOING TO
HELP THESE PEOPLE?

72
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,990
PLEASE SHARE THAT INFORMATION.

73
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,840
SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY PEOPLE THAT
BENEFIT FROM THESE PROGRAMS THE

74
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,360
MOST WELL SOMEHOW DRINK THAT
CONSERVATIVE KOOL-AID AND

75
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,350
THINK I AM STRUGGLING TO PUT
FOOD ON THE TABLE BUT I

76
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,650
WANT THOSE TAX CUTS FOR THE
RICHEST IN THE COUNTRY SO I

77
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:54,740
CAN BE SCREWED OVER WHEN A
TERRIBLE STORM HITS.

78
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,009
THAT MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE
WORLD.

79
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,240
CONTINUE VOTING FOR TRUMP
PLEASE.

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,880
THERE ACTUALLY IS ONE WAY THAT
THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE.

81
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,350
IF EVERY SINGLE RICH PERSON IN
THE WORLD BEHAVED LIKE HARRISON

82
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,200
FORD, MAYBE THE TAX CUTS WOULD
BE OKAY BECAUSE IN THAT CASE

83
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:18,690
THEY WOULD ALL ñ OTHERWISE IT IS
POSTED

84
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:30,850
JORDAN FRENCH MADE A
COMMENT TO ME RECENTLY ñ

85
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,890
I WANT TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY
WHERE I RELIES SOLELY ON

86
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,240
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS.

87
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,669
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING SOME OF
THOSE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS

88
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,210
THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE NEWS
LATELY AND HOW COMFORTABLE THEY

89
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,919
ARE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST
CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE.

90
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:51,729
IF YOU ARE GAY AND NEED HELP THE
CHURCH GOING TO HELP YOU?

91
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:52,729
I

92
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,820
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A
SITUATION WHERE WE ARE

93
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,660
COMPLETELY RELIANT ON PEOPLE
VOLUNTEERING TO HELP, WE NEED TO

94
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,669
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN
PLACE ONCE TRAGEDY STRIKES.

95
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,430
THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE
IN THEIR HEAD THAT IF

96
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,240
GOVERNMENT DIDN'T DO IT WE WILL
JUST HAVE CHARITIES DO IT.

97
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,680
WE HAVE HAD CHARITIES IN THIS
COUNTRY SINCE WE STARTED.

98
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,970
THERE IS A REASON WHY WE HAD
INSTITUTE MEDICARE.

99
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,970
YOU KNOW WHY?

100
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,380
BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE QUIT WORKING
THEY GO INTO POVERTY AND

101
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,480
DIE WITHOUT MEDICINE BECAUSE
THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

102
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,100
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE MEDICARE.

103
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,300
BEFORE MEDICARE THERE WAS A 33%

104
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,060
POVERTY RATE AMONG SENIOR
CITIZENS.

105
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,159
A DECADE LATER IT WAS 11%.

106
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,149
DO YOU THINK CHURCHES
COULD OF DONE THAT?

107
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:39,389
WE HAD CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES
BACK THEN, BUT WE STILL HAD

108
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,089
33% OF SENIORS LIVING IN
POVERTY.

109
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,720
THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE
THAT WHAT WE JUST LET THE

110
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,540
CHURCHES DO IT ñ THEY DON'T
FREAKING DO IT.

111
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,779
WE HAVE THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD THE FACE OF THE

112
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,079
EARTH HAS EVER SEEN.

113
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,709
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY 1
MILLION TIMES OVER.

114
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:01,210
BUT THE GUY WHO RUNS THE AMAZON
OF ASIA, IT IS NOT CHINA THAT IS

115
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,959
SCREWING OVER OUR ECONOMY, IT IS
US BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

116
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,600
HOW TO DISTRIBUTE OUR INCOME.

117
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,649
WE HAVE MORE WEALTH IN
AMERICA THAN WE HAD 10

118
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,569
YEARS AGO OR FIVE YEARS AGO.

119
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:11,769
PEOPLE ARE POOR.

120
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:12,769
WHY?

121
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,209
BECAUSE WE HAVE A FAILED
SYSTEM.

122
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:18,790
WE CALL A SYSTEM THAT TAKES THE
RICHEST COUNTRY AND RENDERS

123
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,759
HALF OF ITS PEOPLE
POOR OR LOW INCOME?

124
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,629
THAT IS A FAILED SYSTEM.

125
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,339
THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THE
CHURCH IS GOING TO FIX THAT

126
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,519
SYSTEM IS FUCKING BULLSHIT.

127
00:09:29,519 --> 00:10:29,209
TURN OFF YOUR 

128
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:30,209
A.M.

129
00:10:30,209 --> 00:00:00,000
RADIO.
