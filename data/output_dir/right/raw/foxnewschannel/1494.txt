1
00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:01,404
AND UNSEEN SEGMENT.

2
00:00:01,404 --> 00:00:04,540
BUT FIRST, UNBRIDLED POWER OF

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,708
THE SURVEILLANCE STATE.

4
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:07,977
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

5
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:08,411
ANGLE.

6
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:11,981
WAS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN --

7
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:13,216
COMPRISED OF PRIVATE CITIZENS

8
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:14,984
SURVEILLED BY THE OBAMA

9
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:15,451
ADMINISTRATION?

10
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:16,752
WAS INFORMATION COLLECTED AND

11
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:18,855
THEN RETAINED ABOUT THEM?

12
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:20,690
THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT

13
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,258
SHOULD FRIGHTEN EVERY AMERICAN

14
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:24,961
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR POLITICAL

15
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:25,795
AFFILIATION.

16
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,530
WAS THE GOVERNMENT SPYING ON

17
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,298
ITS CITIZENS?

18
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:31,033
WELL, WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT

19
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:32,134
CARTER PAGE ON THIS PROGRAM

20
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,836
EARLIER IN WEEK WAS TARGETED

21
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:35,905
AND SURVEILLED BY THE F.B.I.

22
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:38,107
HE WAS APPROACHED BY AN F.B.I.

23
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:39,208
INFORMANT WHO WAS REPORTEDLY

24
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,910
SENT OUT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH

25
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,680
PAGE AND OTHER TRUMP CAMPAIGN

26
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:44,981
AIDES.

27
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,782
THE BIG QUESTION, DID

28
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:48,517
PRESIDENT OBAMA OR

29
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:49,318
HIGH-RANKING WHITE HOUSE

30
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:51,554
OFFICIALS KNOW OF, AND

31
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:52,488
AUTHORIZE SPYING ON A

32
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:53,489
POLITICAL OPPONENT?

33
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:54,857
MAINLY, TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN

34
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:55,324
STAFF.

35
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,159
WELL, THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT

36
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,794
THE FIRST TIME THE GOVERNMENT

37
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:00,229
SURVEILLED CITIZENS OR

38
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:01,597
CAPTURED INFORMATION ON THEM.

39
00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:03,699
I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO A

40
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,035
HEARING FROM 2013 WHEN SENATOR

41
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:10,172
RON WIDEN POSED THIS -- RON

42
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:11,340
WYDEN POSED THIS QUESTION TO

43
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,509
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

44
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:14,510
INTELLIGENCE JAMES CLAPPER.

45
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,778
>> I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN

46
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:17,313
GIVE ME A YES OR NO ANSWER TO

47
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:17,813
THE QUESTION.

48
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:19,215
DOES THE N.S.A. COLLECT ANY

49
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:21,217
TYPE OF DATA AT ALL ON

50
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:22,618
MILLIONS OR HUNDREDS OF

51
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,455
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS?

52
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:27,223
>> NO, SIR.

53
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:30,359
>> IT DOES NOT?

54
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,094
>> NOT WITTINGLY.

55
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:33,262
>> Laura: THEN YESTERDAY,

56
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:36,032
CLAPPER APPEARED ON "THE VIEW"

57
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,533
WHERE HE TRIED TO DEFEND

58
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:38,367
HIMSELF AGAINST TRUMP CHARGES

59
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,169
THAT HE IS BASICALLY JUST A

60
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:40,603
LIAR.

61
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:41,370
>> THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING ME

62
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,204
A LYING MACHINE.

63
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:45,174
WELL, OKAY.

64
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:45,541
[LAUGHTER]

65
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,443
WHAT THAT STEMS FROM IS AN

66
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:48,911
EXCHANGE I HAD WITH SENATOR

67
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:50,646
WYDEN FIVE YEARS AGO IN MARCH

68
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:54,750
OF 2013 ABOUT SURVEILLANCE

69
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,652
PROGRAM AND HE WAS ASKING ME

70
00:01:56,652 --> 00:01:58,187
ABOUT ONE AND I WAS THINKING

71
00:01:58,187 --> 00:01:59,488
ABOUT ANOTHER.

72
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:01,424
SO, I MADE A MISTAKE.

73
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:02,325
BUT I DIDN'T LIE.

74
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,593
THAT IS WHAT OCCASIONED --

75
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:05,394
>> Laura: YEAH.

76
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:07,229
OCCASIONED THE LIE.

77
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,066
WELL, EVEN MEGAN McCAIN

78
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:18,107
COULD SEE THROUGH CLAPPER'S

79
00:02:18,107 --> 00:02:18,574
OFFISCATION.

80
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:20,343
>> IN 2013 WHEN YOU WERE ASKED

81
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:27,516
ABOUT IT YOU SAID NO.

82
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:28,918
THAT IS A LIE.

83
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:29,418
>> NO, IT ISN'T.

84
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:30,586
I WAS THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING

85
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:31,020
ELSE.

86
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,421
>> WHAT IS HE THINKING ABOUT?

87
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:33,689
IT'S A LIE.

88
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,925
IT AMAZES ME THAT HE CONTINUES

89
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,994
TO GO ON NATIONAL TV AND

90
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:39,061
SHAMELESSLY WITH A STRAIGHT

91
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,429
FACE DENY WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW

92
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:41,063
TO BE TRUE.

93
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:43,399
INFORMATION LEAKED BY EDWARD

94
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:47,103
SNOWDEN, THE NATIONAL SECURITY

95
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,304
CONTRADICTS CLAPPER'S CLAIMS.

96
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:49,805
THE QUESTION FROM WYDEN WAS

97
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:52,808
SIMPLE AND CLEAR.

98
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:53,976
WYDEN HIMSELF CALLED OUT

99
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:55,611
CLAPPER FOR THIS REPEATEDLY.

100
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,814
I THINK THE MOST DAMNING

101
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:00,316
MOMENT OF "THE VIEW"

102
00:03:00,316 --> 00:03:01,384
APPEARANCE IS THIS ONE.

103
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,152
>> WAS THE F.B.I. SPYING ON

104
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:04,286
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN?

105
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:05,154
>> NO, THEY WERE NOT.

106
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:08,057
THEY WERE SPYING ON -- A TERM

107
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:10,059
I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE ON

108
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,060
WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE DOING.

109
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,029
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WERE THE

110
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:14,096
RUSSIANS INFILTRATING TRYING

111
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,998
TO GAIN ACCESS AND LEVERAGE.

112
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:20,503
>> I LIKE HOW HE DOES THIS.

113
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:20,903
SPYING.

114
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,071
LIKE HE DOESN'T LIKE THE TERM.

115
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,773
HE IS THE MAN WHO OVERSAW

116
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:25,508
MASSIVE SURVEILLANCE AND INTEL

117
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:26,509
COLLECTED BY SPIES.

118
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,711
HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TERM

119
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:29,078
"SPYING"?

120
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,312
ARE YOU KIDDING?

121
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:32,081
THE LAUGHING MAKING IT VERY

122
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:32,481
BELIEVABLE.

123
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:34,083
NONE OF THIS WAS LOST ON THE

124
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,818
PRESIDENT WHO TODAY TWEETED

125
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:37,019
"SPYGATE" COULD BE ONE OF THE

126
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,988
BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDALS IN

127
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:39,355
HISTORY.

128
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:42,792
THEN HE DOUBLED DOWN.

129
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:43,559
>> President Trump: IF YOU

130
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,294
LOOK AT CLAPPER, HE SORT OF

131
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:48,130
ADMITTED THEY HAD SPIES IN THE

132
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,432
CAMPAIGN YESTERDAY

133
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,766
INADVERTENTLY BUT I HOPE IT'S

134
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:52,768
NOT TRUE.

135
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:54,236
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS.

136
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:55,504
WE NOW CALL IT "SPYGATE."

137
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:56,806
YOU'RE CALLING IT "SPYGATE."

138
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,207
A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAVE

139
00:03:58,207 --> 00:03:58,641
HAPPENED.

140
00:03:58,641 --> 00:03:59,909
>> Laura: BAD THINGS,

141
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:00,609
MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE BEEN

142
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:01,977
HAPPENING FOR SOME TIME NOW.

143
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:04,013
REMEMBER WHEN CLAPPER AND

144
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,648
SALLY YATES WERE CONFRONTED BY

145
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:06,615
SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY ABOUT

146
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:08,384
THE UNMASKING OF TRUMP

147
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:08,751
OFFICIALS?

148
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,219
THEY WERE SURVEILLED,

149
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,689
REMEMBER, AT TRUMP TOWER.

150
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:14,824
>> MR. CLAPPER, DID EITHER OF

151
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,725
YOU REQUEST THE UNMASKING OF

152
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,060
MR. TRUMP, HIS ASSOCIATES OR

153
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:27,970
ANY MEMBER OF CONGRESS?

154
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,304
>> YES.

155
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:31,574
IN ONE CASE I DID.

156
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:33,275
I CAN SPECIFICALLY RECALL BUT

157
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,176
I CAN'T DISCUSS IT FURTHER

158
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:34,910
THAN THAT.

159
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,079
>> DID EITHER OF YOU EVER

160
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,115
REVIEW CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IN

161
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:40,382
WHICH MR. TRUMP, HIS

162
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:41,851
ASSOCIATES OR MEMBERS OF

163
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:45,688
CONGRESS HAD BEEN UNMASKED?

164
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:46,789
>> OH, YES.

165
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:47,456
>> YOU HAVE?

166
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,892
CAN YOU GIVE US DETAILS HERE?

167
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:52,928
>> NO, I CAN'T.

168
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:54,396
>> MISS YATES, HAVE YOU?

169
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:55,097
>> YES, I HAVE.

170
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:58,100
NO, I CAN'T GIVE YOU DETAILS.

171
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,034
>> Laura: THERE IS LITTLE

172
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:00,803
DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WE HAVE

173
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:03,172
WITNESSED AN OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE

174
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:04,140
OF OUR INTEL AND LAW

175
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,307
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

176
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,510
NOT BECAUSE BRENNAN OR COMEY

177
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,044
OR CLAPPER WERE CONVINCED THAT

178
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:10,880
RUSSIA WAS RIGGING THE

179
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,313
ELECTION.

180
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:14,049
BUT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO

181
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,417
HOBBLE A MUCH BIGGER THREAT.

182
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,219
DONALD TRUMP.

183
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:19,722
THE OBAMA CROWD WAS SO BRAZEN

184
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:20,856
AND SO CONFIDENT THAT THEY

185
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,458
WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING I

186
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,726
THINK IN THE END THEY WERE

187
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,828
REALLY SLOPPY.

188
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:29,231
AT LEAST SERVE TRUMP

189
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:29,832
ASSOCIATE -- SERVE TRUMP

190
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:30,933
ASSOCIATES ARE SUSPECTED OF

191
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,836
BEING YOU ARE VAILED.

192
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,739
BANNON, CONAN, JARED KUSHNER,

193
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,507
CARTER PAGE, GEORGE

194
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:38,941
PAPADOPOULOS.

195
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:42,545
WE ALSO KNOW THAT FOUR TOP

196
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:43,379
OBAMA OFFICIALS REQUESTED THAT

197
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,383
THE NAMES OF AMERICANS BE

198
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:47,750
UNMASKED.

199
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,818
FOR SAMANTHA POWER THIS WAS

200
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:50,819
REPORTEDLY NEAR DAILY

201
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,488
UNDERTAKING IN THE 2016

202
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:52,855
CAMPAIGN.

203
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,823
THAT YEAR.

204
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:55,157
2016.

205
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,626
HERE IS WHY ALL THIS DEEP

206
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:58,460
STATE INTRIGUE MATTERS.

207
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,030
THE OBAMA TEAM HAD A MATERIAL

208
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,864
INTEREST IN SPIKING THE

209
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:03,499
HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL PROBE

210
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:07,836
AND MAKING WAY FOR THE TRUMP

211
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,305
THEIR CAREERS AND THEIR

212
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,907
LEGACIES HUNG IN THE BALANCE.

213
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:13,943
AS ANDY McCARTHY OF

214
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:15,177
"NATIONAL REVIEW" POINTS OUT

215
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:17,479
IN A COLUMN TODAY HAD HILLARY

216
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,647
WON THE ELECTION MANY OF THE

217
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:19,748
OFFICIALS WOULD HAVE RETAINED

218
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:21,050
THEIR JOBS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN

219
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,818
ABLE TO COVER WHATEVER SCHEMES

220
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,687
THEY RAN DURING THE OBAMA

221
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:25,120
TENURE.

222
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,989
THEY SIMPLY COULD NOT PERMIT

223
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,358
TRUMP TO TAKE THE PRESIDENCY.

224
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:30,559
AND ONCE HE WAS WITHIN

225
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,894
STRIKING DISTANCE, I THINK

226
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:33,229
THEY GOT REALLY DESPERATE.

227
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,530
DESPERATE TO WRAP UP THAT

228
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,632
HILLARY PROBE SO MAYBE SHE

229
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:37,733
COULD TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE

230
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,202
LIKE THEY THOUGHT DESPERATE TO

231
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:41,870
COLLECT DIRT ON TRUMP TO

232
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,138
DESTROY ANY CHANCE OF THE

233
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:43,639
CANDIDACY.

234
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,507
IT'S A RICH IRONY THAT THE

235
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:46,709
VERY PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THAT

236
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,044
THEY WANT TO STOP RUSSIAN

237
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:50,512
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS,

238
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:54,650
ADOPTED THE TACTICS OF A

239
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,317
TOTALITARIAN STATE.

240
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:57,052
LIKE RUSSIA.

241
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,188
TO STIFLE POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

242
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,856
AND TO SUBVERT THE ELECTION OF

243
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:01,690
DONALD TRUMP.

244
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,160
GIVEN ALL OF THAT, IT MADE ME

245
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,862
HOWL WHEN CHUCK SCHUMER SAID

246
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:07,730
THIS YESTERDAY.

247
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,599
>> THE PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR IS

248
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,837
THE KIND OF GROSSLY AUTOCRATIC

249
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:17,273
BEHAVIOR WE'D EXPECT IN A

250
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:18,073
BANANA REPUBLIC.

251
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:22,444
NOT A MATURE DEMOCRACY.

252
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,647
>> Laura: NO, CHUCK.

253
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,315
BANANA REPUBLIC IS A PLACE

254
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:29,952
THAT OPPONENTS ARE SPIED UPON,

255
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:32,488
CHARGE AND UNJUSTLY

256
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:33,255
IMPRISONED.

257
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:35,758
WHAT TRUMP IS ATTEMPTING TO DO

258
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:36,725
IS EXPOSE CORRUPTION IN THE

259
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:37,559
INTEL AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

260
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,560
SERVICES WHICH CONGRESS AND

261
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,264
THE PRESIDENT MUST EXERCISE

262
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:43,499
THEIR OVERSIGHT OVER.

263
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,567
IN THE WAKE OF 9/11,

264
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:46,535
CONSERVATIVES WERE WILLING TO

265
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:48,337
TRADE PRIVACY FOR SECURITY.

266
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:49,405
WE'RE NOW BEING PHOTOGRAPHED

267
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:50,005
BY THE GOVERNMENT.

268
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:51,373
HOW MANY TIMES A DAY?

269
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:52,675
CAN'T EVEN COUNT.

270
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:55,144
OUR MONEY, AND OUR PERSONS ARE

271
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,745
TRACKED AT HOME AND ABROAD.

272
00:07:56,745 --> 00:08:01,650
WELL, WE THE PEOPLE AND OUR

273
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,452
ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD NOT

274
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:06,555
BE ENDLESSLY TRAIL AND TREATED

275
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:07,890
LIKE DANGERS TO THE STATE.

276
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,591
WE SHOULDN'T SPIED UPON FOR

277
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,292
POLITICAL REASONS.

278
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:11,860
THE EVER EXPANDING

279
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,928
SURVEILLANCE STATE IS A THREAT

280
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:15,497
TO THE FREEDOM, AND SOME

281
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:18,801
WITHIN THE AGENCIES THINK THEY

282
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:26,909
ARE ABOVE THE LAW.

283
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,110
THEY ARE NOT.

284
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,712
THIS PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE

285
00:08:29,712 --> 00:00:00,000
MANIPULATE AND HE IS INSISTING
