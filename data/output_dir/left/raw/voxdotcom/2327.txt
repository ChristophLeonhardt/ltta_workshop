Serious talk about a brokered convention
Brokered convention

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,320
The Republican party would be signing a suicide
note if there is a brokered convention

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,539
The brokered convention. It’s sort
of the white whale of politics. Exciting,

4
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:17,570
extremely rare, and honestly, pretty unlikely
to happen.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,830
But whether it happens or not, understanding
how it works is key to understanding the primaries.

6
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:32,200
A brokered convention happens when one candidate
fails to get support from more than half the

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,120
delegates in the convention’s first round
of voting.

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,590
Right now, the candidates are crisscrossing
the country in the hopes of winning a bunch

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,820
of state primaries.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,820
Because those victories translate into more
delegates at the party convention.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,370
For example, take Iowa. The winner of the
caucuses there gets more Iowa delegates the

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,920
bigger their margin of victory

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,070
And even candidates who don’t come in first
place in Iowa can still get a share of the

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,970
state’s delegates.

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,170
But take Florida. The winner of that primary
gets all of that state’s delegates...no

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,440
sharing required.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,310
Once the delegates from all the different
states have been counted up, we could have

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,409
a situation where no one candidate has 51
percent majority. Then we’d have a brokered

19
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:13,850
convention.

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,960
Neither party has had a brokered convention
in decades. But here's an example of how it

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,020
played out in the past, for Republicans in
1948

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,179
In the first round of voting, Thomas Dewey
got the biggest share...but he was still short

23
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:27,490
of a majority.

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,499
Dewey’s supporters went to the delegates
who had supported other candidates in the

25
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:32,799
last round and basically said

26
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,320
Why don’t you join the winning team and
vote for Dewey?”

27
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,549
It worked. By the third round of voting, Dewey
clinched the nomination.

28
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,249
In recent years, there haven’t been many
surprises at conventions because so many primaries

29
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:50,530
are early in the year. That means the winners
get momentum early, the losers drop out, their

30
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,520
delegates pledge to other candidates, and
the need for a convention fight goes away.

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,149
But this year really is different. The possibility
of Trump or Cruz as a republican nominee is

32
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:04,539
scaring the hell out of the republican establishment,
who know both of those candidates are unlikely

33
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:06,579
to win in the general election.

34
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:11,530
But with Trump and Cruz polling so strong,
a divided convention might be the only hope

35
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,880
for an establishment candidate like Rubio,
or Kasich.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,800
So who knows? Maybe this year, the myth will
become reality. If that happens, we'll definitely

37
00:02:19,940 --> 00:00:00,000
be there.
