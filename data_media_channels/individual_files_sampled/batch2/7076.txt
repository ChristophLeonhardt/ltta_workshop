if you have a bank account or if you have access to banking if you wanted to bank you might be surprised to find out that for many many many Americans they don't have access to that and that is extremely consequential it can be a financially crippling burden to not be able to actually go to a bank and do that sort of thing the options that you then have to turn to are incredibly costly and purposefully so they spend a lot of lobbying money to keep it that way but there are some ideas that could fix this problem of lack of access to banking and senator Krueger Kristin Gillibrand has a proposal that was released today that follows on from some thinking about this that's been going on for several years that could possibly fix the problem her legislation would require every u.s. post office to provide basic banking services central goal of the bill is to replace risky financial products like payday loans sure Tom but earlier with regulated alternatives and here's what's interesting about this system is you'd be adding on banking services to a very widely available service the postal system has 30,000 locations in nearly every community 59 percent of them are in so-called banking deserts or zip codes that have either no bank branches or just one effectively a monopoly and so this would create competition or just simple access to literally millions of Americans in fact more than one-quarter of American households 34 million homes are either unbanked meaning they lacked someone with a bank account altogether or underbanked relying on payday loans or other so-called alternative lenders to supplement the services of a traditional bank and in many cases being underbaked can actually be worse long-term than being unbanked and in particular the unbanked rate among black holes' households is eighteen point two percent compared to seven percent for the population as a whole so while this legislation would help many many many Americans for certain communities people color things like that it could actually be even more helpful we have some additional numbers on how much this could could help financially but what do you think about this idea and understand this is something a lot of progressive think tanks have been talking about for a while Bernie Sanders has been proposing something like this for years he was on a vise about a week go talking about some sort of plan like this but it's something that he's been pushing for literally years so I'm gonna give you a couple more numbers and then tell you why this is way more important than just public option for banking which is great so the numbers at the US Census the average payday loan is three hundred seventy-five dollars by the time borrowers pay it back they have five hundred and twenty dollars in interest and fees on top on top of the 375 they have to return so that is back-breaking the annual income with the underbanked is twenty five thousand five hundred dollars and they spent nearly ten percent of their income on just paying back money yeah it's unreal so in this case instead of paying hundreds of percentages that's a weird way of putting it but some of the percentages in interest that they gave or 100% 200% 300% which is unbelievable you should be called loan-sharking right now at the post office if they do it there it just be a little bit about the Treasury bond so which is a little above 2% do you have any idea what kind of money that would save to millions of families across the country it could change their lives yeah so instead of losing 10% of their income to paying back interest in fees they pay a reasonable interest rate they can only borrow up to $1,000 it's a great idea now the more important point is look at all these senators competing to have a more and more progressive policy positions so remind me again who's gonna win the primaries so the idea was well the establishment will reassert itself and the voters in the Democratic Party are not really that progressive they just they just want remember Hillary couldn't also want a corporate tax cuts just not as much as Trump and the idea was that's what Democrats want they want everything for corporations but not quite as much as as the Republicans etc that idea has been defeated now it doesn't mean they're not gonna do it wants to get into office so I'm not I'm not naive but right now everyone who's thinking of running for president Gillibrand Booker comma Harris etc are all competing to be more and more progressive years out from the primary that's right so it turns out the voters did want a progressive so the establishment was wrong and once again we were right if we weren't right you think Gillibrand and Booker and all these folks would be rushing to the left no they'd be rushing to the right or the middle etc and by the way at this point and the reason why I think this story is so important and almost a watershed moment I know that's little grande it's because this is not faint progressive this is actual progressive so now remember Gillibrand doesn't take corporate PAC money anymore so I'm beginning to think that that's begun to work like wait I don't need the payday lender money I in fact I can't even take it if I'm not taking corporate back money I don't need the banker money and Gillibrand in New York you stick a lot of banker money why don't I pass something that's popular it'll help me get elected and it'll be good for my constituents it's really crazy it's like so you have unpopular views so you need corporate money to run ads to fool people into getting you to the office instead why not just do what people want and then you don't need the money at all and the country benefits so this isn't I believe and you could say hey no Jake not yet and I hear you and under date an establishment has earned our skepticism but I believe that this is not just pretending anymore that we have reached them home in where they have actually become begin begun to be cut to become progressives yeah this is a great bill she's got her name on it if let's say Gillibrand goes all the way through and runs for president as we think and wins whether you want her to or not now she would have to propose this it's one of her signature proposals she would have to push for this and either way we will continue to watch her it's our job of course it's not like we're like oh we're done with it now we trust the politicians from now on we're gonna stay on them but also credit where credit is due yes and it turns out we were right about the voters and now they've got to come cater to you which is a great place to be if you like this video bless your we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through
