WE START IN WEST VIRGINIA WHERE

16
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,968
WE HAVE AN INTERESTING RACE AND

17
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,204
WE HAVE A VERY VULNERABLE SEAT

18
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,240
THAT'S HELD BY JOE MANCHIN.

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,343
>> JOE MANCHIN HAS BEEN ELECTED

20
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,479
FOR 36 YEARS, DONALD TRUMP WON

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,450
THE STATE BY 42 POINTS.

22
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,218
THIS IS -- ROB: SHOCKER.

23
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,486
>> THIS IS WHAT MAKES HIM

24
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:52,886
VULNERABLE.

25
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,321
THE QUESTION IS THERE'S THREE

26
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,790
REPUBLICANS IN THE PRIMARY,

27
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:03,297
JENKINS, MORRIS AND BLANKENSHIP,

28
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,864
JENKINS, CLEARLY TOSS-UP RACE,

29
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:10,971
VERY COMPETITIVE, MANCHIN WILL

30
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:16,610
HAVE HANDS FULL.

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:23,317
BLANKENSHIP, IF HE WINS, MANCHIN

32
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,453
WILL HAVE A BREATHER.

33
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,688
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING

34
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,223
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD SEND

35
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:32,659
OUT A TWEET DON'T VOTE FOR

36
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,628
BLANKENSHIP, WE WILL SEE.

37
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,798
ROB: ALL FIGHT TO GO SEE HOW --

38
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:41,101
THEY ARE ALL TIEING --

39
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,802
>> SURE.

40
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,670
ROB: WE HAVE OHIO NEXT AND

41
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,205
ANOTHER POSSIBLE VULNERABLE

42
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:45,706
SEAT.

43
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,075
>> BROWN IS NOT AS VULNERABLE AS

44
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,145
JOE MANCHIN BUT DONALD TRUMP DID

45
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,614
WIN THE STATE BY 8 POINTS,

46
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,582
BIGGEST MARGIN IN OHIO SINCE

47
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,117
1980's AND BROWN IS A LITTLE

48
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,586
BIT NERVOUS, JIM, THE REPUBLICAN

49
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,054
CONGRESSMAN IS HEAVILY FAVORED

50
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,390
TO WIN THE PRIMARY BUT BOTH

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,159
CANDIDATES ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

52
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,826
DONALD TRUMP.

53
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,194
ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

54
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,896
ROB: THE GOVERNOR THERE KASICH,

55
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:10,564
NEVER-TRUMPER REPUBLICAN

56
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,465
GOVERNOR INTERESTING TO SEE WHO

57
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,834
WILL TAKE THAT SPOT?

58
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,936
>> THE ONE THING IT WON'T BE

59
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,905
ANYBODY LIKE JOHN KASICH, THEY

60
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,573
ARE BOTH RUN GET AWAY FROM HIM,

61
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,241
THEY ARE BOTH SAYING WE ARE THE

62
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:25,712
BEST SUPPORTER OF DONALD TRUMP,

63
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,282
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TAYLOR ALSO

64
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,349
HOPE TO GO TAKE THE SHOT, THEY

65
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,084
ARE BOTH AS I SAID, THEY ARE

66
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,920
NEVER KASICHS AT THIS POINT AS

67
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,489
OPPOSE TO NEVER TRUMPERS, ON THE

68
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,091
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WE HAVE RICHARD,

00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,793
CHANNELING ELIZABETH WARREN AT

00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,996
THE CONSUMER FINANCE BUREAU, BUT

71
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,965
HE'S ONE OF THE MORE MODERATES

72
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,500
IN THE RACE, HE'S FAVORED.

73
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,202
AT THE END OF THE DAY N OHIO IF

74
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,337
THINGS GOES AS WE EXPECT IN

75
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,772

CAN BE -- CAN BEAT JOE DONLY,

89
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,277
IT'S BEEN A COMPETITIVE RACE,

90
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,678
QUESTION FROM THE REPUBLICANS,

91
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,680
CAN THEY UNIFY.

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,184

>> BY THE WAY, MOST OF THE

95
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:44,091
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON ARE AT

96
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,492

REDRAWING OF THE DISTRICTS, A

99
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,764
LOT OF CONFUSION, A RISK HERE

100
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,165
FOR THE REPUBLICANS THEY

101
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,368

102
00:03:54,368 --> 00:04:00,641

WON BY 134 VOTES TWO YEARS AGO,

117
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,203
THIS IS A PLACE WHERE THE

118
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,571
REPUBLICANS ARE REALLY HOPING TO

119
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,741
