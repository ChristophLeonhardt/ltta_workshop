POLICE DEPARTMENT, WORKING IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRE 
DEPARTMENT AND SHERIFF's OFFICE 
BEGAN THE EVACUATION OF 
APPROXIMATELY 150 FOLKS FROM 
THIS COMMUNITY. 
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE FOLKS 
WENT TO SHELTERS. 
WE THEN TRANSITIONED ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY FROM THE EVACUATION 
MODE TO THE SECURITY MODE 
MAKING SURE THOSE AREAS THAT 
HAD BEEN EVACUATED ARE SECURE. 
IN ADDITION TO THAT I WOULD JUST
ADD THAT WHILE THINGS ARE 
PROGRESSING POSITIVELY AND WE 
ARE KEEPING OBVIOUSLY POSITIVE 
THOUGHTS IN MIND, IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE ALL 
CLEAR HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN YET. 
WE ASK THAT FOLKS NOT RETURN TO 
THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN 
EVACUATED UNTIL -- ENGINEERING 
FOLKS TELL US IT IS OKAY TO 
RETURN. 
I ASK YOU BE A LITTLE BIT 
PATIENT AND MAKE SURE WE ARE 
NOT GOING BACK NOW BECAUSE IT 
IS NOT TIME. 
I WOULD ASK MEMBERS OF THE 
PUBLIC's TWO OTHER THINGS. 
ONE THING I UNDERSTAND THIS IS 
INTERESTING, A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WANT TO COME OUT AND VIDEOTAPE 
THIS AND MAYBE TAKE SELFIES. 
THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THAT. 
THAT DOES IS IT CAUSES US AS A 
POLICE DEPARTMENT TO PULL VITAL 
ASSETS FROM OTHER AREAS TO MAKE 
SURE YOU DON'T HURT YOURSELF 
AND YOU ARE NOT IN A PLACE YOU 
ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE. 
I'M ASKING YOU NOT TO DO THAT 
RIGHT NOW. 
SECOND THOSE BARRICADES YOU SEE 
UP THERE ARE MEANT FOR YOU NOT 
TO PASS THEM. 
PLEASE DO NOT JUST TAKE IT UPON 
YOURSELF TO MOVE THE BARRICADE 
AND GO AROUND IT. 
THE BARRICADE IS THERE FOR A 
REASON. 
I WOULD ASK YOU NOT TO DO THAT 
EITHER BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS 
VITAL STAFFING ISSUES WE ARE 
DEALING WITH AND WE NEED THOSE 
FOLKS WHERE WE NEED THEM. 
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT. 
WITH THAT I WILL NOW TURN IT 
OVER TO JENNY HUNTINGTON HUMAN 
SERVICES. 
. 
>> HELLO. 
-- AGENCY HAD THE GREAT 
PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THE RED 
CROSS AS WELL AS LYNCHBURG CITY 
SCHOOLS TO OPEN AND OPERATE THE 
SHELTER LAST EVENING AT THE 
REQUEST OF THE EMERGENCY 
OPERATIONS GROUP. 
WE HOUSED ABOUT 98 FOLKS LAST 
NIGHT IN OUR SHELTER AND FED 
THEM BREAKFAST THIS MORNING. 
SOME OF THEM ARE ON THEIR WAY 
TODAY, OTHERS REMAIN AT THE 
SHELTER. 
WE HAVE ABOUT 90% OF THOSE 
FOLKS WHO ARE EVACUEES AND ONCE 
THE DAM IS SECURE AND PEOPLE 
WHO CAN RETURN TO THEIR HOMES 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. 
ABOUT 10% OF OUR FOLKS WERE 
ACTUALLY DISPLACED BY THE FLOOD 
THERE. 
HOMES OR APARTMENTS ARE DAMAGED 
BY ONE WATERS AND REHOMING THEM 
WILL TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME. 
THE SHELTER WILL BE OPEN UNTIL 
THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED, AND WE 
WILL BE WORKING WITH THOSE 
FOLKS IN THE COMING DAYS TO 
HELP THEM DEVELOP A HOUSING 
PLAN FOR SAFE HOUSING OUTSIDE 
OF THE SHELTER. 
AS MENTIONED, THE SHELTER ALSO 
HAS A PET COMPONENT, AND THE 
LYNCHBURG ANIMAL SHELTER HAS 
BEEN VERY HELPFUL ALLOWING 
PEOPLE TO BRING THEIR PETS 
BECAUSE IT DID INCREASE THEIR 
COVER. 
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 
SHELTER ARE ELDERLY OR DISABLED 
IN SOME WAY AND THOSE PETS ARE 
VERY COMFORTING TO THEM AS WELL 
AS THE CHILDREN THAT ARE THERE. 
SO THAT HAS BEEN VERY 
SUCCESSFUL. 
THE RED CROSS HAS BEEN 
INSTRUMENTAL PROVIDING STAFF TO 
HELP. 
THE PAPERWORK, THE ACTUAL 
EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS COTS AND 
BLANKETS, PROVIDING THE FOOD, 
EASY CLASS IS THE LOCATION OF 
THE SHELTER ON MEMORIAL AVENUE. 
WE ARE STILL ACCEPTING PEOPLE 
INTO THE SHELTER IF THEY NEED 
ASSISTANCE DUE TO BEING 
DISPLACED BY THE FLOODWATERS, 
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO AND 
TAKE AS LONG AS THE NEED IS 
THERE. 
NEXT, I WILL LET YOU HEAR FROM 
-- CITY MANAGER, BONNIE SURRCHEK
SURRCHEK. 
>> I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY 
SAYING THANK YOU TO EVERYONE 
INVOLVED IN THE RESPONSE AND 
RECOVERY, SPECIAL THANKS TO THE 
UNIVERSITY OF LYNCHBURG FOR 
THIS SPACE AND THE -- ON THE 
SPUR OF THE MOMENT. 
I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF 
THE CITY TEAM, MANY OF WHICH 
YOU HAVE HEARD FROM, BUT MANY 
OF WHICH ARE SITTING BEHIND THE 
CAMERAS AND MANY OF WHICH ARE 
OUT IN THE FIELD DOING THE WORK 
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT 
NOW. I 
ALSO WANT TO THANK COUNTLESS 
COMMUNITY PROPERTY OR -- 
CITIZENS FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND  
AS WE SPEND THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS AND PERHAPS WEEKS WORKING 
TOWARD RESILIENCY FROM THIS 
EVENT. 
THAT INCLUDES THE FORMAL PART OF
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE. 
WE NOW OPEN IT FOR QUESTIONS 
THAT I WILL MOST LIKELY DEFER 
TO THE APPROPRIATE STAFF. 
>> Reporter: MR. MITCHELL COULD 
YOU TELL US WHAT GOES INTO 
DETERMINING WHEN THE DAM IS 
STABLE? 
WHAT ARE THE FACTORS YOU LOOK 
AT? 
>> A NUMBER OF THINGS WE LOOK 
AT. 
ONE IS HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS 
ACTUALLY DONE TO THE DAM BY THE 
OVERTOPPING OF THE SPILLWAY. 
SECOND, AND MOST IMPORTANT 
THING WE LOOK FOR, IS ANY TYPE 
OF SEEPAGE THROUGH THE BASE OF 
THE DAM. 
IF THERE IS NO SEEPAGE THAT 
MEANS WATER IS STILL NOT 
PENETRATING THROUGH THE DAM SO 
AS LONG AS WATER IS NOT 
PENETRATING THROUGH THE DAM 
ITSELF, IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE 
STABLE. 
>> TALK OF OPENING A SLUICE 
GATE, IS A TRUE. 
>> THERE IS IT EMERGENCY 
SPILLWAY THAT IS CLOSE. 
WE HAVE TO EXCAVATE THE END OF 
THE SPILLWAY THAT GOT COVERED BY
DEBRIS WHEN THE DAM OVER TOP. 
THE TO EXCAVATE THAT PROBABLY 
TOMORROW MORNING AFTER THE 
STORMS PASS AND OPEN THAT GATE. 
THAT WILL ESSENTIALLY LOWER THE 
WATER LEVELS IN THE LAKE. 
IT MAY NOT DRAIN THE LAKE 
COMPLETELY BUT DEFINITELY LOWER 
THE WATER LEVELS AND MAKE THE 
DAM OVERALL MORE SAFE. 
>> Reporter: HAS THIS BEEN AN 
ONGOING CONCERN? 
IT IS AN EARTHEN DAM I KNOW IT 
HAS BEEN IN PLACES 1935. 
ARE THERE OTHER CONCERNS? 
>> DEFINITELY HAS AN INADEQUATE 
SPILLWAY BY TODAY'S SAFETY 
STANDARDS. 
IN CONJUNCTION WITH UNIVERSITY 
OF LYNCHBURG NOW TO COME UP 
WITH A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE. 
IT IS A VERY COMPLICATED 
SITUATION WITH THE CITY THAT 
ACTUALLY OWNS THE DAM THE 
UNIVERSITY OWNS THE LAKE AND WE 
ARE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF 
FACTORS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL 
Ãº 
WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. 
IT HAS BEEN A CONCERN AND WE 
HAVE PLANS IN THE WORKS TO 
ADDRESS THAT IN THE FUTURE. 
>> Reporter: CAN YOU CLARIFY 
WHETHER ARE NOT THE DAM IS 
CLASSIFIED. 
>> IS CLASSIFIED AS A HIGH 
HAZARD DAM CLASSIFICATION 
DETERMINED BY THE IMPACTS OF 
THE DAM IF IT WERE TO FAIL. 
IF THERE ARE STRUCTURES 
DOWNSTREAM OF THE DAM, IN THIS 
CASE THE ROADWAY AND UTILITIES 
ACROSS THE DAM, THERE IS 
RAILROAD TRACKS DOWNSTREAM SO 
IF IT WERE TO FAIL IT WOULD 
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND 
BASICALLY PUT LIVES AT RISK 
WERE IT TO FAIL ALL OF A 
SUDDEN. 
FROM THAT STANDPOINT, IT IS 
CLASSIFIED AS A HIGH HAZARD DAM
. THAT IS A STATE 
CLASSIFICATION. 
>> Reporter: YOU TWO STUDIES, 
DID THIS COME OUT IN ANY OF 
THOSE STUDIES, ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT? 
>> IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN, 
ACTUALLY A STUDY DONE BACK IN 
1980 BY THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS 
BUT DETERMINED THAT THE DAM 
SPILLWAY WAS INADEQUATE TO PASS 
A LARGE VOLUME OF WATER. 
UNTIL RECENTLY, THE DAM WAS 
GRANDFATHERED IN TO THE DAM 
SAFETY REGULATIONS, BASICALLY 
ANY DAMS BUILT BEFORE A CERTAIN 
DATE DID NOT HAVE TO COMPLY 
WITH THE NEW DAM SAFETY 
REGULATIONS. 
IT WAS KNOWN, HAS BEEN KNOWN 
THAT THE SPILLWAY WAS 
INADEQUATE TO PASS A LARGE 
VOLUME OF WATER COMING THROUGH 
THE WATERSHED. 
THAT IS A RELATIVE TERM THOUGH, 
BECAUSE BY TODAY STANDARDS, 
DAMS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED TO 
PASS A PROBABLE MAXIMUM FLOOD. 
THAT IS LIKE A ONCE IN A 
THOUSAND YEAR OR 10,000 YOUR 
EVENT. 
A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASING 
CAPACITY OF THE SPILLWAY. 
>> Reporter: HAVE THEY TRIED TO 
FORTIFY THE DAM? 
>> THERE IS TWO OPTIONS THAT 
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. 
ONE IS TO FORTIFY THE DAM SO IF 
IT OVERTOPPED IT WOULD NOT 
ERODE AND BREACH AND FAIL. 
THAT IS ONE OPTION THAT HAS 
BEEN LOOKED UP. 
THE OTHER WOULD BE TO BASICALLY 
DRAIN THE LAKE, REMOVE THE DAM 
AND BUILD A BRIDGE OVER 
BLACKWATER CREEK. 
THOSE ARE TWO OPTIONS BEING 
CONSIDERED LONG-TERM. 
>> Reporter: WHEN WILL 
ULTIMATELY THE DECISION BE 
MADE? 
>> THAT PROCESS IS CURRENTLY 
BEING HANDLED BY PUBLIC WORKS. 
THEIR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE 
ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT? 
>> WE ARE STILL STUDYING THAT. 
WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER THE 
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WE FEEL 
EVENTUALLY POTENTIALLY LAKESIDE 
DRIVE COULD BECOME FOUR LANES 
IN THERE AND THERE MIGHT BE AN 
ADVANTAGE TO BUILDING A BRIDGE 
AS OPPOSED TO FORTIFYING THE 
DAM. 
SO WE ARE STILL STUDYING THAT, 
DETERMINING WHAT OUR BEST 
OPTION IS FOR THE LONG TERM. 
>> Reporter: IS THE CURRENT 
SITUATION SPEEDING UP THAT 
PROCESS ALL? 
>> CERTAINLY I THINK AS WE TALK 
AND WORK FURTHER INTO THIS 
PROBLEM, CERTAINLY THAT IS 
SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE TO TALK 
ABOUT AND FIGURE OUT WHERE DO 
WE GO FROM HERE LONG-TERM. 
YES, ABSOLUTELY. 
>> Reporter: THE STUDY BEGAN? 
>> I CANNOT GIVE YOU AN EXACT 
DATE I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK 
WITH YOU. 
>> Reporter: WITH PREVIOUS 
KNOWLEDGE -- 
>> WE WERE WORKING ON IT, LONG-
TERM PROCESS, PARTNERSHIP WITH 
THE UNIVERSITY OF LYNCHBURG AND 
IT REQUIRES CAREFUL STUDY. 
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR OPTIONS 
AND WE HAVE BEEN MOVING TOWARD. 
RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES FOR THE 
CONSTRUCTION SO WE HAVE IN 
FORWARD VERY DELIBERATELY. 
CERTAINLY I HAVE NEVER EXPECTED 
THE DAM TO TOP. 
IN MY CAREER I HAVE SEEN 
OVERTOPPED A COUPLE OF TIMES 
AND IT HELD. 
THIS HAS BEEN AN UNFORTUNATE 
INCIDENT AND WE HAVE TO MOVE 
FORWARD AND FIGURE OUT WITH THE 
RIGHT SOLUTION IS. 
>> JUST ANOTHER POINT RELATED 
TO THAT. 
A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE STATE 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY PASSED 
LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRED THE 
STATE TO REEVALUATE THE PROBABLE
MAXIMUM FLOOD AND PROBABLE 
MAXIMUM PRECIPITATION EVENTS. 
BASICALLY ANY DAMS IN THE 
PROCESS OF BEING DESIGNED OR 
RENOVATED BASICALLY THE PROCESS 
WAS PUT ON HOLD FOR ABOUT A 
YEAR UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF 
THAT STUDY, TO SEE ULTIMATELY 
THE DAM HAD TO BE ABLE TO PASS. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER DELAY IN THE 
PROCESS. 
AS WERE WE -- AS WE WERE 
APPROACHING THE FINAL DECISION 
THE ISSUE CAME UP MOVING THE 
PROCESS FURTHER AS WELL. 
HAS THE HIGH HAZARD DAM 
DESIGNATION EXACERBATED BY 
DEVELOPMENT HERE, MORE PARKING 
LOTS HIGHER THAN THE DAM 
ITSELF? 
>> WELL, THE HIGH HAZARD 
CLASSIFICATION CAME ABOUT, DAM 
SAFETY REGULATIONS REVISED 
ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO AND INCLUDED 
ANYTHING -- REALLY NOT WHAT IS 
UPSTREAM OF THE DAM THE 
DETERMINES THE CLASSIFICATION 
IT IS THE SIZE AND WHAT IS 
DOWNSTREAM THE DETERMINES THE 
CLASSIFICATION. 
THE RISK OF THE DAM FILLING IS 
THE RISK THAT IS WHAT IS 
DOWNSTREAM THAT DETERMINES THE 
CLASSIFICATION. 
>> Reporter: FOR PEOPLE WHO 
SUSTAINED DAMAGES IN THEIR 
HOMES WHO CAN THEY REACH OUT 
TO? 
>> THAT WOULD NOT BE A QUESTION 
FOR ME. 
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED 
FROM THE MOST RECENT TORNADO 
WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO CREATE AN 
AFTER ACTION RECOVERY TEAM. 
WE WILL DO THE SAME FOR THIS 
EVENT. 
WE ARE BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT 
HOW TO CREATE A RESPONSE. 
>> Reporter: CAN YOU TALK SOME 
-- ABOUT SOME OF THE SHORT-TERM 
REPAIRS TO THE DAM YOU ARE 
DOING IF ANY? 
>> WE ACTUALLY HAD A CONFERENCE 
CALL WITH AN ENGINEER. 
WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT 
ENGINEERING FIRMS WORKING ON 
THIS RIGHT NOW. 
WE HAD RILEY WILSON, A LOCAL 
ENGINEERING FIRM THAT WENT OUT 
AND DID THE VISUAL BOOTS ON THE 
GROUND INSPECTION THIS MORNING, 
ALSO WORKING -- --
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
OFFICIALS GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE 
VIRGINIA DAM FLOODED DUE TO 
RAIN. 
PEOPLE IN LYNCHBURG HAVE IN 
ORDER TO EVACUATE. 
THE TOWN COULD BE UNDER 17 FEET 
OF WATER IN JUST 7 MINUTES. 
>>> ANOTHER STORY WE HAVE BEEN 
FOLLOWING, NEW NEWS ON THE 12 
-YEAR-OLD GIRL ABDUCTED AT A 
WASHINGTON DC AIRPORT. 
SHE HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN FOUND. 
POLICE HAVE CONSIDERED JINJING 
MA TO BE IN EXTREME DANGER 
AFTER SHE WENT MISSING AT 
REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT. 
THE 12 -YEAR-OLD WAS VISITING 
THE U.S. FROM CHINA AND WAS 
WITH A TOUR GROUP AT THE TIME. 
POLICE SAID SHE APPEARED TO 
WALK OFF WITH AN ASIAN WOMAN 
WHO APPROACHED HER AT A 
RESTAURANT. 
THAT SET OFF A SEARCH FOR HER. 
NOW THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR 
MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN 
SAY SHE HAS BEEN FOUND SAFE. 
WE WILL HAVE MORE AS WE 
LEARNED. 
>>> A QUICK BREAK, MORE NEWS 
WHEN WE RETURN.
