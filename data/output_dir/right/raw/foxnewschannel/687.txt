DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

9
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:17,869
IT COULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON

10
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,870

IT PLAYED ON WEDNESDAY.

19
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,583
I THINK IT'S POIGNANT.

00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:34,152
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO IT AND I

THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ABLE TO GET

24
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:47,498
AWAY WITH BLACK SITES AT OUR

25
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:48,466
BORDER WITH SEPARATION OF

26
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:48,833
CHILDREN.

27
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:49,867
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BLACK

28
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:50,168
SITES.

29
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,970
>> WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN ARE

30
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:53,705
BEING KEPT AND HUMAN RIGHTS

31
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:55,907
ABUSES ARE HAPPENING WITHOUT ANY

32
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,982
WON THE PRIMARY.

33
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,316
SHE'S VILLAINIZING I.C.E. IN

34
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,317
THAT SOUND BITE.

35
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:08,353
THAT WAS MY TAKE-AWAY.

36
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:12,290
WE'RE SEEING THAT WITH OTHERS.

37
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,192
SOME ARE COMPETING IN THE

38
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:14,559
PRIMARIES.

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,828
WHEN YOU VILLAINIZE AN AGENCY

40
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:18,496
LIKE THAT, YOU START TO GET

41
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:18,830
EXTREME.

42
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,200
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

43
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,369
WE'VE SEEN ALEXANDRIA

44
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,970
OCASIO-CORTEZ SAID EARLY ON IN

45
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,972
HER CAMPAIGN SHE WAS FOR

46
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:28,473
ABOLISHING I.C.E.

47
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:29,907
THIS IS A POSITION SOME OTHER

48
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:32,744
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF

49
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:34,645
PEOPLE IN SWING DISTRICTS, IN

50
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:36,881
HOUSE RACES, THESE COMPETITIVE

51
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:41,753
I WOULD BE SKEPTICAL THEY WOULD

52
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:42,687
TAKE THOSE POSITIONS.

53
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:44,389
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CAST AS

54
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,323
EXTREMES OF THEIR PARTY.

55
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:47,625
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

56
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:48,726
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ WON IN

57
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,628
A VERY DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT.

58
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,263
SHE KIND OF CAN GO OUT THERE, BE

59
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:53,698
MORE LIBERAL THAN SOME OF THESE

60
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:56,200
FOLKS IN OTHER RACE AS WELL.

61
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:59,470
LIZ:  AS WE START SORT OF SEEING

62
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:01,572
THIS PRIMARY SEASON CONTINUE,

63
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:03,608
WHEN YOU SEE RHETORIC LIKE THIS

64
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,743
AND THEY ARE THE EXTREMES, DO

65
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:08,246
THE ESTABLISHMENT CHARACTERS,

66
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:10,281
LIKE NANCY PELOSI, DO THEY WANT

67
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:10,948
TO REIN THAT IN.

68
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,617
>> IT DEPENDS ON THE DISTRICT.

69
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:16,254
YOU SEE LEADERS LIKE LEADER

70
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,590
THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE THEY

71
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,492
DON'T SEE THAT AS A WINNING

72
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:22,727
MESSAGE, ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF

73
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:23,961
THE COMPETITIVE HOUSE RACES THAT

74
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:25,129
THEY'RE TRYING TO UNSEAT

75
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,530
REPUBLICANS.

76
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,597
THEY'RE TRYING TO TALK TO VOTERS

77
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:27,732
WHO SUPPORTED REPUBLICANS IN THE

78
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:30,101
PAST AND SAY TO

79
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:30,134
PAST AND SAY CO

80
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:31,335
PAST AND SAY CHOOSE A DEMOCRAT

81
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:31,669
INSTEAD.

82
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,937
THEY DON'T WANT TO GO FARTHER TO

83
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:34,906
THE LEFT AND I COULD SEE LEADERS

84
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:37,175
KIND OF PUSHING BACK ON THAT.

85
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,609
LIZ:  WE'RE LOOKING AT LIVE

86
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,243
PICTURES.

87
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,779
YOU SEE THOUSANDS IF NOT TENS OF

88
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,481
THOUSANDS, IF NOT HUNDREDS OF

89
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,755
THE FAR LEFT SPEECHES, YOU COULD

90
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:51,989
SAY CAMPAIGN SPEECHES TAKING

91
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,291
PLACE IN THESE RALLIES.

92
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:54,292
HOW FAR LEFT ARE DEMOCRATS GOING

93
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:55,960
TO BE GOING THIS SEASON?

94
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,495
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

95
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,363
I THINK TO THE EXTENT OF

96
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,802
COULD MAYBE ENERGIZE VOTERS,

97
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:06,537
ESPECIALLY LATINO VOTERS, A

98
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:08,673
BLOCK OF VOTERS THAT HASN'T

99
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:09,874
TRADITIONALLY TURNED OUT AS WELL

100
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,210
FOR DEMOCRAT AS THEY HOPED.

101
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:13,411
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

102
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:14,312
WHAT REPUBLICANS DO ESPECIALLY

103
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:15,947
ON IMMIGRATION, SOME OF THE

104
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:17,548
DEMOCRATS -- SOMELY, SOME OF THE

105
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:18,583
-- SORRY, SOME OF THE

106
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,118
REPUBLICANS THAT YOU SEE PUSHING

107
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,819
FOR CONGRESS TO ACT ON

108
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
THIS ISSUE ARE FOLKS IN

109
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:25,156
DISTRICTS WITH HIGH HISPANIC

110
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:26,557
POPULATIONS, PEOPLE WHO SEE

111
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:27,525
INACTION AS SOMETHING THAT COULD

112
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:28,826
BE A PROBLEM FOR RE-ELECTION.

113
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:30,828
LIZ:  WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST

114
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,330
SURPRISE ASIDE FROM THE NEW YORK

115
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:34,165
RACE, WHICH WAS THE 14th

116
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,800
DISTRICT, WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST

117
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,201
SURPRISE ASIDE FROM THAT?

118
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:40,538
>> THERE WERE FOUR NEW YORK CITY

119
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,141
INCUMBENTS FACING DEMOCRATIC

120
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:43,541
CHALLENGERS.

121
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,209
THREE OUT OF THEM WON EXCEPT FOR

122
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,310
CROWLEY, OF COURSE, WHICH WAS

123
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,879
SORT OF INTERESTING.

124
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,448
ONE CONGRESSMAN LOST BY A -- WON

125
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:51,415
BY A SMALL MARGIN.

126
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,384
SO THAT WAS SORT OF SURPRISING.

127
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,188
OF THE NIGHT.

128
00:03:57,189 --> 00:00:00,000
LIZ:  WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
