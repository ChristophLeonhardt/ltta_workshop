he's your first well Rio's my first as well my first and puppy I got a little dog I used to make fun of guys that walk around with dogs like this I'm like that's your tiptoes now look at me now I'm one of those people people and asking them what's a I'm on business from home you know what I think your mom should do if your mom should manage your career you're so beautiful after meeting some new friends in the park Stephen continues his search for max or anything that slightly resembles him is my my little prince yeah that sure looks like a leash fit for royalty we're going hey guys you guys are here for can we do a quick check on round we all know Rios got 20/20 vision but we're happy that you guys noticed too how many days you guys been here for the convention today it's nice because we all go to different schools really great to be able to be and silurian it is save is in Chicago you did the convention you're going back now you look sir in four very different states mm-hmm so what do you guys think like everything going on politics is that America right now ultra-conservatives versus ultra liberals which I'm related to a few just say it right and almost now that's becoming so polarized I think we got to talk about are you guys optimistic about your future are you feeling like America is still a place where you can be who you want to be or has it changed for me I'm optimistic about my own future I look it up to be they have supportive family that encouraged me to like pursue my dreams and succeed as much as possible but I'm just with the current state of the country for people of color I'm worried that if I were to have children that's a very honest observation right now where's it gone way to going yeah I'm a first generation in America so for me I feel like the opportunity is still there I think I can still pay my own way life will still be fairly the same for me regardless what's going on with you know things like that life is a bit different in terms of people being a little bit more emotional and reactive in terms of certain topics just kind of try to shy away from overall I think as we gone across the country on the great American pilgrimage and I would tell people because they're gonna be peace well will there be continued protests I think most people's fear is just come from lack of understanding of each other make the effort to learn more about each other then it seems to me young lady like I now have one more pilgrim who has join the pilgrim Stephen never heard from these pilgrims again I just want you know you have your members of the pilgrimage while you're here anybody bothers you you let me know let's strengthen my now he needs to go take his puppy celebrity now pretty bad thank you so much Steven and Rio head back to the RV for a quick nap and still no sign of Max where is Max Keiser we have no idea about your sudden passing I've only just learned you were yourself thin taking your last wrong turn you're apt got up to you as we all know it would I tell you I'm sorry if only I could so I write these last words and hopes to put to rest these things that I never got off my chest I remember when we first met my life turned on each breath but then my feelings started to change you talked about war like it was a game still some more fond of you those that didn't like to question or argue and I secretly promised to never be like you it said one does not leave a funeral the same as one enters the mind gets consumed with death but this one quite differs I speak to you now because there were no other takers to proclaim that mainstream media has met its maker join me every Thursday on the Alex Salmond show and I'll be speaking to guess in the world of politics sport business and show business I'll see you then what politicians do is something we don't do they put themselves on the line and they get accepted or rejected so when you want to be present why would you wanna be or someone will want to be aggressive that's it like to be present what's the right when the phone rings at 3:00 in the morning can't be good for I'm interested always in the wise and the house I played for many clubs over the years so I know the game inside out but all isn't only about what happens on the pitch for the final score it's about the passion from the fans it's the age of the super manager billionaire owners and spending 220 million on one player but it's an experience like nothing else on earth because I want to share what I think and what I know about the beautiful game I agree to want more transfer and this is my new team after a quick catnap Steven heads out to speak with more people around the city hi where you guys from get out of here I made a movie about a guy from Oklahoma once his name was laying Frost I received what we call a second you ever see that movie I'm an actor and it looks like Rio is quickly learning to follow in the footsteps of most celebrities and show up late to set your name Jake you know you guys so you guys are from Oklahoma we live on a small farm we actually live next door to Toby Keith's singer he's got hired six acres waiting and you're just visiting because all the Sun is gonna apply to University of Chicago for college college interviews and you got your whole life figured out don't you not entirely for an 18 year old do you know what you want to study already or you're not sure I'm looking a lot of anthropology anthropology maybe that's very interesting work very gratifying if I can pull it off well if you stay on it listen you can do anything that's part of what we're doing here is we're we're talking to folks great American pilgrimage it's mean and our being with my dogs driving around saying hey to folks like what do you do for a retired retired law enforcement of course you're gonna have a perception of certain things I mean you're gonna have a perception of what's best for your sons post this most recent election maybe want to just go out and listen and I learned a lot from all aspects of people's opinions and judgments and political perspectives and things like that we've had amazing conversations but I'm just the host because that part of the problem to me is it I haven't been listening I'd know a whole lot more among other folks if listen oh that's what listening sounds like it's just a journey to try to hear people's hearts about what America means to them what would your response to that that what does America mean - it means freedom that means you can do whatever you want to do or be whatever you want to be I always tell my sons you're not gonna get anything by standing around and waiting for somebody to give it to you all right what about you tell your old are you don't what you do wonderful we do everything ourselves if we need to something made we make it ourselves to fix whatever we need to fix self-sufficient on the farm pretty much yeah the welding thing doesn't come natural me we do it's fun a lot of people don't want to work like that a lot of people don't want to get hot and sweaty and dirty and and I don't like to either but those are skills and things that are going away to these next generations so what's been your experience in Chicago we've been looking around it was it all work work work look it at the school as my wife Allison I love the history of everything which I do to me and my younger son we look at how everything is built and how everything's been made that's not Chinese today deep doodad you like pizza I do I've got a sample for deep dish great to meet you guys good to meet god bless you after helping this family discover one food item that everyone knows about in Chicago Stephen decides to head to a restaurant to meet up with an old friend and hopefully fine skies so we were over at this barber shop with Sumi Powell and whose incredible incredible just to come to Chicago and and and hear from local people what's going on what do they think what why do they think certain problems exist hey finally oh there he is you know I've been on the desert you know hitchhiking my way here or looking where Steven be you know leaving me out there you ran off with that motorcycle check like I know where to go I had no ride I was in the middle of Dakota's funny that's not how we remember it all right brother if I understand correctly Stacy if you have to head out for a Kaiser report exactly all right yeah god bless you buddy all righty I finally found you you know it took me like half an hour look at all our Chicago we thank you for your commitment to the pillar know we didn't have an extravagant budget but this is what was this Donny Greco oh don't I know no friend of Fela you might know named William Baldwin oh yeah the cute one really of the handsome barman I got it well this young man and young William used to galavant together really so I'm coming to Chicago I got a cup said mr. Craig because he's got one of the best restaurants in the entire city this is your wife Oh Mike it's it harder coming down the road is fantastic the garlic the onion everything uh thank you it turns out as I was saying low eating seafood young man here frequency establishment huge fan of the Kaiser report yeah yeah we were surprised to would you please be sure to say hello did let's talk max nice to meet you right what's your name max what your name is max yep I love that day what's a good name nice to meet you say you're a Chicago yeah I've been here my whole life really you watch our show I've been watching it for about two years so are you the only one in your circle friends that watches my show because whenever I show up at the town it's usually one person and they are kind of like it's a secret the guilty pleasure I'm actually scheduled to be in shark metal part 7 which will start shooting sometime in 2024 I would say it's a bit of a guilty pleasure what do you say how old are you I'm 26 I studied finance at a University of Chicago called DePaul University all right one of Chicago's School of Finance is quite famous Milton Friedman and all those guys right there that's right is that you follow me in that footsteps into that monitor school because if you're all gonna have to stab him chapter one of Max's version of how to win friends and influence people threaten bodily harm um I was originally thinking that way and I sort of changed my mind he was in my show no it was more of other things the people in finance I didn't really seem to get along with right so your finance are you doing more business or I sort of segwayed out of finance actually into I got interested in data science alright so data science and money mmm this sounds like a prelude to Bitcoin are you getting into Bitcoin and crypto currencies I wish I'd gotten into Bitcoin ten years you've got two kids I got two kids right Ally inhaler so how are we doing about that how's the house how's life on the blast smart they're making good choices they've got the tiger mountain on their back you know making sure they're doing everything right you say that you raise them old school or new school I'm more old school I have to say cuz a lot of the influence came from Grandma right you know that's a tradition we know and we grew up so we try to instill those good values and but you know they progress into the society today yeah it's a lot out there today that we never had to experience now you're the next generation are you a millennial I am a millennial so you are a millennial yeah millennial that's great that do you have the biggest demographic ever since the baby boomers this bigger than the baby boomers the Millennials 26 years old so I think that puts me in the category there seems to be a lot of discussion in this country about where we're going as a country you've got the power to change the world that's that's something I think about actually is right so I think of the younger group as a bit more liberal than the older and older group are we gonna change as a demographic as a whole of this country but sometimes it doesn't seem that way it seems like we're going in Reverse sometimes it's sickly like cyclical I am Not sure so there's less cohesion yeah tribalism yeah right and that's gotta be worrying to some degree what's gonna bring together max I mean you watch my show you're into the Crypt oh yeah my name I'm relying on you just all these problems you know we'll be here forever what are you gonna do I don't think I'm the solution from the pro okay that's great news max so like there's a few things that are in there there was learned by Grandma that apply to the menu here some ponies Graham yeah there's grandma Karen jela yeah a lot of other grandma influences in this food for better you made the linguine with the white clams yes that was fun to watch you kill back to my roots tell me about Chicago a little bit is it a you hear different stories about Chicago different things going on you know what's the truth tell me the real deal so I think I've seen sort of all sides of Chicago I've worked a tutor on the south side so experienced some of the gang violence you see there there was one night where the parent there was a parent-teacher conference and as the parents were leaving the school there was a shooting and five before shots and then the Northside everything is great and dandy is just the amazing difference between the two sides how does it affect you your young guy you're starting out and it's just a place to grow your business your family or is it becoming too stressful or too much violence or did what how do you feel about that I think it's sort of like up-and-coming areas in Chicago are good it's I would still recommend you still love it I still love it they're still happening it's a great sports town yeah exactly you got did I do have an inferiority complex about being you know not as great as New York City and sad you know tell the truth I think I think Chicago's got New York beat what that's crazy talk now it's a good thing Steven didn't hear that great to meet you Oh nice meeting you all right keep it real thank you brother food was the best hey this kids a millennial so I was really nice to me I didn't manage to rip him off about fifty thousand and crypto he didn't really uh no idea they got his phone open it's no coders we're all white up but I just scanned it with my phone I got like fifty thousand from this kid yes so you know that's the way I'll explain later would be adults all about Wow no I'm only kidding I'm only that's a joke of course he was a very nice guy and I actually gave him $5.00 with a - did you really see much yes would you leather - protects it free - sure okay get your back swallowing what it is hundred dollars of - to my friend that was fantastic of you yeah but now fortunately for you mr. Grecco has an offer for you oh it's just some of the most delicious food Chicago has to offer what do you recommend eggplant parmesan or one of the best pizzas in the city brother you're singing my song it's my favorite hardly wait after Steven and Max reunite they continue on the pilgrimage and head toward the Northeast to the birthplace of America on the great American building while running first City Council they think I'm gonna selling religion or selling solar it's either you're selling solar or you're there for religion and you're selling souls oh that wasn't funny it didn't work did it tell me how you met bill a friend I had a little cafe called a sweet bean cafe and he was here filming Flatliners so my place they gravitated to we bonded we became friends we started hanging out it's been a lifelong friendship I was at his wedding he was at my wedding bachelor party I don't know what she's talking about right there I don't recollect when I prove you that saying any such activity nor if I did recollect I would not be able to disclose such elimination it was it's been a good one yes
