“I believe that
I am championing
the Second Amendment
in the 21st century.”
This is the man who’s
trying to disrupt
the U.S. firearms industry
and test the limits 
of the First Amendment.
“I think access to the firearm
is a fundamental human dignity.
It’s a fundamental human right.”
30-year-old Cody Wilson 
is a self-described
gun rights advocate and 
crypto-anarchist,
which means he believes
in decentralization
of information.
He’s also been 
labeled one of the
most dangerous people
in the world.
“It’s become kind of 
culturally edgy
in the gun world
to have your own
ghost gun.”
Wilson started 
Defense Distributed in 2012
and later used it
to share the plans
for one of the
first, functioning
3-D printed guns,
a plastic pistol
he called “The Liberator.”
Now he’s trying to let anyone
download blueprints
to make guns at home.
“Defense Distributed’s goal
isn’t really personal armament —
it’s more the
liberation of information.
It’s about living in
a world where you just
download the file
for the thing
you want to make 
in this life.”
Wilson claims that it’s
his First Amendment right
to upload blueprints 
for firearms
ranging from handguns
to AR-15 rifles.
But critics say his methods are
a form of open-source terrorism.
Plastic firearms will
be able to slip
through metal detectors.
Guns printed without
serial numbers
will be difficult to trace.
And some fear the
mass production of
unregulated firearms could
fall into the wrong hands.
Defense Distributed first
published its blueprints
online in 2013.
The Obama administration
ordered the company
to pull its files.
But the designs had
already been downloaded
more than 100,000 times.
Since then, Defense Distributed 
has been embroiled
in a multiyear 
legal battle.
Although the 
Trump administration
appeared to 
have cleared the way
for Wilson to publish his blueprints,
his multiyear 
legal battle is ongoing.
