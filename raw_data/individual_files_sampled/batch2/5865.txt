let's begin today with that extensive interview that even by President Trump standards is extraordinary in it he dismisses the law he excuses fraud that rips off the American taxpayer and suggests that the economy depends on him being president and that's just for starters we've got a great team here to break it all down for us but we have to start with the details of that interview itself the president sitting down with Fox and Friends Ainsley Earhardt yesterday for 22 minutes and turning on Michael Cohen so completely now dismissive of the man he employed for more than ten years there was a lawyer for me for one of many you know they would say the lawyer and then they like to add the fixer well I don't know him is a fixer I don't know where that term came from but he's been a lawyer from they didn't do big deals did small deals not somebody that was with me that much you know they make it sound like I didn't live with without him I understood Michael coned very well what turned out he wasn't a very good lawyer frankly president Trump also insisting he did not know about the payments to Stephanie Clifford better known as stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal until later on did you know about the payments later on I knew later on but you have to understand easily what he did and they weren't taken out of campaign finance that's a big thing that's a much bigger thing did they come out of the campaign they didn't come out of the campaign they came from me that statement about the timing so provably false that for only the second time in its existence the Washington Post fact checkers call it a lie not misleading not misinformed his explanation of the payments they've concluded is an outright lie in the bigger picture it does bring to mind a Watergate era question of deep interest to investigators now did the president know and when did he first knowing so after turning completely on his longtime friend Michael Cohen the president also doing something of an about-face on Paul Manafort remember that's a guy he once dismissed as only working for him for a very short period of time but now not ruling out a pardon and in fact had nothing but praise for convicted mana for though he was very critical of his attorney general Jeff Sessions for his decision to recuse himself from the investigation what kind of a man is this and by the way he was on the campaign you know the only reason I gave him the job because I felt lousy he was an original supporter he was on the campaign so the end game some Democrats see for this investigation is impeachment but the majority of Democrats on the hill yesterday steer clear of any talk of the i-word while during the interview the president put the I in impeachment I guess it says something like high crimes and all I don't I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's done a great job I'll tell you what if I ever got impeached I think the market would crash I think everybody would be very poor hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
