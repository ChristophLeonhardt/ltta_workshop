1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,150
There are so many different kinds of date
labels.

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,049
Creme fraiche.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,680
I don’t even know what creme fraiche is.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,940
Oh that’s something else.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,040
It can be REALLY confusing to know what all
these labels indicate.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,440
A lot of times you just throw away food that’s
past whatever date you see.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,360
But you’re actually throwing away tons of
perfectly good food because many times,

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,860
these dates don't mean what you think they mean.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,980
Say you have a carton of eggs with a label
that says “sell by January 1st.”

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,290
If they’re in your fridge past that date,
you might throw them away thinking they’re

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,340
probably bad.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,200
But “sell by” is just a label for retailers
to know when it’s time to take food off

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,940
their shelves, so they can manage their inventory.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,160
It actually doesn’t tell you anything about
the safety of those eggs.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,560
And that’s not the only misleading label
on your food.

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,680
Part of the problem is that there are way
too many labels to begin with.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,850
Walmart, one of the biggest food retailers
in the country, surveyed its label suppliers

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,229
and found a total of 47 different kinds of
date labels on their products.

19
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,200
Almost all of these labels indicate the quality
of food.

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,560
Manufacturers put down dates to suggest when
food will be at its best.

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,639
Or when its taste and freshness will start
to deteriorate.

22
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:24,740
These labels are useful indicators of food
quality, but they’re widely misinterpreted

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,440
as a sign of food safety.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,929
This national survey about perceptions of
labels found that about 84% of people would

25
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:33,490
at least occasionally throw away food that’s
past the date on labels.

26
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,080
This confusion around date labels has created
a massive food waste problem in the United States.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,500
All the uneaten food waste costs us over $200
billion each year, and two thirds of that

28
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,509
comes from households.

29
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:51,490
It costs the average family of four somewhere
between $1,500 and $1,800 a year to purchase food

30
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,270
that then ends up in the trash.

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,560
And I think it's probably not a family in
America that wouldn't like to have $1,500 dollars

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,039
back in their pockets.

33
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,060
This is JoAnne Berkenkamp, a senior advocate
at an environmental group that has studied

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,780
the impact of food labels.

35
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,799
People often assume that they're federally
regulated.

36
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
And in fact that's not the case with the exception
of infant formula.

37
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,280
So it really is up to food manufacturers to
figure out what they're going to do with those

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,770
dates on their particular products.

39
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,170
Yeah, the label makes sense if you’re a
little baby,

40
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,800
but for everything else, it’s often up to the
state governments to decide if they want date labels

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,980
and what those labels should say.

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,120
That’s where it gets really confusing.

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,600
In Georgia for example the law says that “Expiration
Date” is interchangeable with "Best by,"

44
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,160
"Best before," "Use by," and "Sell by" dates.

45
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,260
But in Minnesota a product needs to have
a “quality assurance date” which can be

46
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,940
a date of manufacture or packaging, a freshness
date, an expiration date, or a shelf display date.

47
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,060
And a state like New York says “Date labels?

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,460
Fughetaboutit!”

49
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,200
I don’t deserve love.

50
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,440
In total 41 states plus Washington DC require
some kind of food date label.

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,100
So there's this real amalgam of different
rules from one state to another and that contributes

52
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,930
to confusion for consumers.

53
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,070
And it also makes it harder for food processors
and manufacturers to comply with those rules.

54
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,390
You know, most larger food companies are shipping
food across state lines and so trying to comply

55
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,600
with that patchwork of regulations is just
tough for the food businesses as well.

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,830
So what can be done to fix this labeling problem?

57
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,760
Many experts think that the best solution would
be a federal regulation that standardizes

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
all date labels.

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,980
And what would this new label say?

60
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,020
One way to avoid confusion would be to remove
visible “sell by” dates.

61
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,870
Instead, packages could have a scannable barcode
that would still allow stores to track their

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,320
inventory without confusing customers.

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
Another way would be to standardize labels
for safety and for quality.

64
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,930
Foods where there is a safety risk could say
“safe if used by”, which wouldn’t be

65
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,819
applied to most foods that don’t really
expire.

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,860
For quality they could say “peak quality
guaranteed before” instead of just “best by."

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,580
Having a standardized label would remove a lot of confusion, but even then, we

68
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,160
shouldn't treat these dates like gospel — when
you're trying to decide if your food is

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,180
safe to eat, your best bet is still just trusting your
senses.

70
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,980
And if we all band together and do our part,
maybe, just maybe, I can some day figure out

71
00:04:22,980 --> 00:00:00,000
what creme fraiche is.
