1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,730
For millions of years the earth has been perfectly good at absorbing carbon

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:12,630
dioxide our forests seas and streams suck the gas up acting as natural carbon sinks that

3
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:17,038
was until humans came along and tipped the scales if we

4
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:21,119
Continue to burn fossil fuels at ever rising rates

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,719
We could warm the planet by 7 and 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century and the impacts of that would be catastrophic

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,949
there have been various attempts to capture this harmful co2, but they've all come with significant compromise until

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
now

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,039
Five four three two, one igniter on

9
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,540
The reason this team is so happy is because they've just

10
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:15,449
Completed the first successful ignition of the first co2 powered turbine in the world's first carbon neutral

11
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,499
Natural gas power plant, their company is called net power

12
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:24,749
It'll be the first truly zero emission power plant in the world

13
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,239
in a traditional gas power plant

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,809
The burning gas creates steam which turns a power generating turbine creating a lot of excess co2 in the process

15
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,779
Previous attempts to capture that co2 have reduced efficiency and led to higher costs of production

16
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,019
Generally, it was thought that carbon capture on natural gas was not economic

17
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,379
So what we had to do was start with a blank sheet of paper

18
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,829
enter this man Rodney alum

19
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:59,368
He developed the system now referred to as the alum cycle. I set myself the objective of

20
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,649
Devising something which would remove hundred percent of the co2 from the fossil fuel with no increase in the cost of electricity

21
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,369
Rodney actually did most of his work on what's called quadrille paper

22
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,319
He has a point five millimeter mechanical pencil and a four function calculator

23
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:26,209
And booked tables to look up his data when a complex computer model was created to check Rodney's calculations

24
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,819
Rodney's pretty much right I

25
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,109
Selected co2 is the fluid in the turbine rather than the steam or air which we use

26
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,619
previously in steam systems or gas turbine systems

27
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,470
And it worked

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,869
We in effect turned the problem into the solution

29
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:57,739
In Rodney's design since the co2 is used to spin the turbine and as part of an entirely closed loop it never enters the atmosphere

30
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,079
It's captured by default

31
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:09,199
And because the co2 power system is just as efficient as traditional natural gas plants the cost per kilowatt hour is the same

32
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,589
We've designed a power cycle that is cheaper and cleaner rather than more costly

33
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,940
imagine when you have

34
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,499
economics driving a solution instead of policy aspirations

35
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,828
Although the co2 never enters the atmosphere the alum cycle still generates a carbon by-product

36
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,029
Which leaves us with the problem of what to do with all that carbon?

37
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,860
4,000 miles away engineers in Iceland have an interesting take on how to keep the captured co2 out of the atmosphere

38
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,639
Shoving it directly into the ground

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,860
Perfect is an R&D project that we started about 12 years ago with the objective of developing methods and technologies for

40
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,819
capturing otherwise emitted co2 injecting it into

41
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,629
basaltic formations

42
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:17,409
we know that certain chemical processes are already happening in nature for example in vicinity of

43
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,039
Volcanoes this year - dissolves into groundwater and forms new types of rock by interacting with themselves

44
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,599
And we thought why not try and accelerate this process at an industrial scale

45
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,660
Very simply carb fix takes the captured carbon and mixes it with water which

46
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,400
basically creates Seltzer

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,579
They then take the fizzy liquid and inject it deep into the earth where the carbon chemically bonds to the basalt rock

48
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,919
Instead of co2 turning into rock in hundreds to thousands of years

49
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,280
This would happen within the timeframe of a few years

50
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,150
Here we have an example of a vein

51
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,810
This is then a small fracture

52
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,310
Where we would have dissolved part of the Passats and then we fill it up again with the carbonates and that's where we see these

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,649
pores filling up with cold sites

54
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,770
If we take all passes available on earth, theoretically we could use it to

55
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,509
Permanently store much more than all co2 that we would emit from burning all fossil fuel available globally

56
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,940
But carb fix is still operating at a small scale and it would take

57
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,279
Serious interest from industries and governments to grow to a size that would affect climate change worldwide

58
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:35,930
In

59
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:42,340
The meantime net power won't be burying its co2 under the ground. They'll be selling it for cold hard cash

60
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:46,959
But cause for the first time we capture carbon dioxide it

61
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,389
very inexpensive prices

62
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:56,499
We open up whole new industries for reuse and recycling co2 that can be useful in building materials

63
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,400
chemicals plastics in a myriad of other applications

64
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:07,299
But one of the most common uses of industrial co2 is actually extracting fossil fuels from the ground

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,759
In the u.s. You're actually injecting over 20 million tons a year of co2 for enhanced or recovery at the moment. I

66
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,030
Think I think if you do if you're sensible about the way that hydrocarbons are used and you have a

67
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,389
integrated idea as to how you're going to how you're gonna

68
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,500
utilize that hydrocarbon in a clean way and that part is key if net powers excess co2

69
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,060
Essentially leads to more oil being extracted. It's not a stretch to imagine

70
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:45,789
It will mostly be used in traditional carbon spewing plants not clean ones like net power

71
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:55,389
It very much appears that you know, the age of fossil fuels is likely coming to a close

72
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,909
some of these technologies for

73
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,110
capturing a sequestering carbon

74
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,009
Might help provide sort of that bridge

75
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,389
It's gonna take a decade or two to to really make that transition in our global energy economy. I'm very optimistic

76
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,739
All the technologies there and we just need the will

77
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,729
That's really happening now

78
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:26,159
If we really want to succeed in in fighting climate change and we need to bring down the co2 levels in the atmosphere

79
00:07:27,369 --> 00:00:00,000
There is no silver bullet. There is no one solution. We have to use all the methods available
