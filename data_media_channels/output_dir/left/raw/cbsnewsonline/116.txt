14
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:31,030
THE LIST. 

15
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,233
THE FACE OF THESE HOSTILITIES, 

16
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,135
IN THE SUMMIT'S AFTERMATH WE 

17
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:39,072
SAW AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO  

18
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:39,539
APPEARED DISMISSIVE. 

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,507
WE HAVE HEARD THIS SOME 

20
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,908
AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BUT AS OF 

21
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:45,078
YET HAVE LITTLE IDEA WHAT THOSE 

22
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,613
MAY BE OPEN THOUGH THE 

23
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,314
PRESIDENT HAS EXTENDED AN 

24
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:52,519
INVITE TO PUTIN TO COME TO 

25
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,954
WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS THE 

26
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,756
IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE 

27
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,790
UNDEFINED AGREEMENTS. 

28
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,461
THE PRESIDENT RECENTLY MET THE 

29
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,162
PRESIDENT OF NORTH KOREA. 

30
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,830
ONE OF THE MOST ARE THELESS 

31
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,765
LEADERS ON THE PLANET WHO HAS 

32
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:06,599
CONTINUED TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR 

33
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,569
WEAPON THAT COULD HIT THE 

34
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,102
UNITED STATES. 

35
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:11,738

AND KILLED HIS UNCLE BACK HOME 

37
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,710
AS ESSENTIALLY MURDERED AN 

38
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,112
AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT AND 

39
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,315

00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:22,615

ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN ARE 

44
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,354
STUNNED BECAUSE OF LACK OF 

45
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:28,554
FOOD. 

46
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:30,990
IN THE FACE OF THESE REALITIES 

47
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,661
THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED HIM 

48
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:41,067
VERY TALENTED AND THAT HE LOVES 

49
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:41,367
HIS PEOPLE. 

50
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:41,600
REALLY? 

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,804
AT THE NATO SUMMIT THE 

52
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:45,838
PRESIDENT NOT ONLY PUSHED NATO 

53
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:48,174
MEMBERS TO DEDICATE MORE OF 

54
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,209
THEIR BUDGETS TO DEFENSE, A 

55
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,578
GOAL WE ALL SHARE, HE WENT ONTO 

56
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,147
B ERA TE THEM, QUESTION THE 

57
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,815
PREMISE OF NATO AND IN MY 

58
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,116
OPINION USED FALSE OPINION TO 

59
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,819
TURN PUBLIC OPINION IN THE 

60
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,620
UNITED STATES AGAINST THE 

61
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:00,887
ALLIANCE. 

62
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,456
HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO CAST 

63
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,458
DOUBT ON THE UNITED STATES 

64
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,559
WILLINGNESS TO ENFORCE ARTICLA 

65
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,560
OF THE NATO TREATY. 

66
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,731
WE WANT TO KNOW IF THIS IS REAL 

67
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,234
OR JUST ANOTHER OFF THE CUFF 

68
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:14,534
STATEMENT. 

69
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,969
AND THE CONFRONTING OF OUR 

70
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,469
PARTNERS GOES BEYOND 

71
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,538
TRADITIONAL SECURITY AND 

72
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,839
EXTENDS TO THE ECONOMIC SPACE 

73
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,106
AS WELL. 

74
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,709
I KNOW YOU ARE AWARE OF MY 

75
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,943
STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE 

76
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,345
ADMINISTRATION'S ABUSE OF ITS 

77
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,979
AUTHORITIES AND USING SECTION 

78
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,549
232 TO PUT IN TARIFFS IN THE 

79
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,251
NAME OF NATIONAL SECURITY. 

80
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,518
SO FAR WE HAVE ZERO CLARITY 

81
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:34,354
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AS TO 

82
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,557
WHAT THE END GAME IS ON THE 

83
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,759
TRUMP, PENCE TARIFFS WHICH IN 

84
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,428
REALITY ARE A MASSIVE TAX 

85
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,596
INCREASE ON AMERICAN CONSUMERS 

86
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,565
AND BUSINESSES AND NOW THE 

87
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,866
ADMINISTRATION APPEARS READY TO 

88
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,868
OFFER WELFARE TO FARMER WHO 

89
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,603
WOULD RATHER HAVE TRADE THAN 

90
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:50,803
AID. 

91
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:51,938
AS YOU KNOW SENATORS HAVE GONE 

92
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,539
TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN GROUPS TO 

93
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,441
DISCUSS THESE ACTIONS AND NOT A 

94
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,410
SINGLE PERSON THAT I'M AWARE OF 

95
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,144
HAS LEFT THOSE MEETINGS WITH 

96
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,848
THE SENSE THAT THERE IS A 

97
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,416
COHERENT STRATEGY DRIVING THESE 

98
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:03,682
POLICIES. 

99
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:04,851
THE ADMINISTRATION TELLS US 

100
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,584
DON'T WORRY, BE PATIENT. 

101
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,587
THERE'S A STRATEGY HERE BUT 

102
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,589
FROM WHERE WE SIT IT APPEARS 

103
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,190
THAT IN A READY, FIRE AIM 

104
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,359
FASHION THE WHITE HOUSE IS 

105
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,328
WAKING UP EVERY MORNING AND 

106
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,628
MAKING IT UP AS THEY GO. 

107
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:20,266
THIS IS A FIRST IN A SERIES OF 

108
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,501
HEARINGS WE WILL HOLD IN COMING 

109
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,836
WEEKS DEALING THE TROUBLING 

110
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,638
DYNAMIC I HAVE DESCRIBED, ONE 

111
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,141
IN WHICH WE ARE UPSETTING OUR 

112
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,643
FRIENDS AND PLACATING THOSE WHO 

113
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,444
CLEARLY WISH US ILL. 

114
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,945
THIS SERIES WILL DEAL 

115
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:34,847
SPECIFICALLY WITH RUSSIA AS 

116
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,450
PERHAPS THE MOST TROUBLING 

117
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,318
EXAMPLE OF THIS EMERGING 

118
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:38,585
REALITY. 

119
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,685
I HOPE HA IN YOUR POSITION YOU 

120
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,487

121
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,489
PROVIDE US WITH THE ANSWERS WE 

122
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,991
NEED TODAY AND AS WE MOVE 

123
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:45,791
FORWARD IN OUR FUTURE HEARINGS 

124
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,393
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 

125
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,162
TESTIMONY AND I WANT TO THANK

00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,664

131
00:03:59,038 --> 00:03:59,438
SENATOR MENENZED. 

132
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,141
>>  LET ME START BY SAYING 

133
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,243
APPLAUD YOU FOR MAKING THIS THE 

134
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,547
FIRST OF A SERIES OF OVERSIGHT 

135
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,080
HEARINGS ON RUSSIA. 

136
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,948
THE COMMITTEE HAS GONE FOR 

137
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,352
ABOUT A YEAR WITHOUT A FULL 

138
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,087
COMMITTING ON RUSSIA OR NORTH 

139
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,454

THIS REGARD. 

142
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:20,692
NOW IT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN A 

143
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,361
THREE RING CIRCUS OF A DEBACLE 

144
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,997
OF A MEETING, I WALK BACK OF IF 

145
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,400
THE PRESIDENT TRUSTS HIS OWN 

146
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,368
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, THE 

147
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,870
SUGGESTION THAT IT MAY BE EVEN 

148
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,839
OKAY FOR A UNITED STATES 

149
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,873
DIPLOMAT TO BE INTERROGATED BY 

150
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,941
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE AND THE 

151
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,442
REALITY TV SUMMIT THAT WAS 

152
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,345
LITTLE MORE THAN A PHOTOGRAPH 

153
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,748
OP WITH A DICT ATO TO MERIT ONE 

154
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,415

SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. 

158
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:52,091
THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE 

159
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,694
ARE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF

FOREIGN POLICY INTERESTS. 

163
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,000
UNFORTUNATELY ALL WE HAVE COME

169
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,983
ALIES. 

170
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,452
WE HAVE NOT SEE ANY DEALS OR 

171
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,787
STRATEGY THAT PUT AMERICANS OR 

172
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:21,753

RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. 

188
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:50,683
SENATOR GRAHAM AND I AND OTHERS 

189
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,684
PLAN TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION 

190
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,354
IN THE COMING DAYS TO ENSURE WE 

191
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,689
HAVE THE TOUGHEST TOOLS TO GO 

192
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,456
AFTER RUSSIA BAD ACTORS. 

193
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:01,461
AS OF THIS MOMENT WE FIND 

194
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,828
OURSELVES IN A SITUATION. 

195
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:03,496
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECTED 

196
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,131
OFFICIALS IN THIS BODY AND 

197
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,332
MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S OWN 

198
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:10,002
CABINET HAVE HEARD MORE ABOUT 

199
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,205
THE MEETING FROM PUTIN AND HIS 

200
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,006
ASSOCIATES THAN FROM OUR 

201
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:14,306
PRESIDENT. 

202
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:17,076
WE KNOW THAT THE KREMLIN STATE 

203
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,344
RUN MEDIA HAVE A DUBIOUS 

204
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,579
COMMITMENT TO THE TRUTH BUT WE 

205
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,380
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS 

206
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,684
BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE WAS IN THE 

207
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,785
ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED. 

208
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,587
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT AND 

209
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,324
I BELIEVE THEY DESERVE TO KNOW 

210
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:31,691
WHAT HAPPENED. 

211
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,426
I HAVE SERIES QUESTIONS ABOUT 

212
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,927
THE SUMMIT THAT TOOK PLACE 

213
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:35,628
NEARLY TWO MONTHS AGO. 

214
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,531
IN THAT TIME WE HAVE YET TO 

215
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,232
HEAR OR SEE ANYTHING THAT 

216
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:41,601
PROVIDES US WITH REAL 

217
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,904
CONFIDENCE THAT NORTH KOREA AS 

218
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,205
THE PRESIDENT GLOATED NO LONGER 

219
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,208
POSES A LATE TO THE UNITED 

220
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:53,546
STATES OR THAT WE HAVE A 

221
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,314
STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE A 

222
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:55,881
VERIFIABLE DENUCLEARIZATION 

223
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,181
AGREEMENT. 

224
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,550
WE HAVE ONLY SEE A VAGUE 

225
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,386
AGREEMENT OF PROMISES TO MAKE 

226
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,921
MORE PROMISES BUT OF WEAKER 

227
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
COMMITMENTS THAN NORTH KOREA 

228
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,389
HAS PREVIOUSLY MADE. 

229
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,624
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH 

230
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,125
KOREA SEEM TO REMAIN FARAH PART 

231
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,396
ON EVEN BASIC ISSUES LIKE THE 

232
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,297
DEFINITION OF DENUCLEARIZATION. 

233
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,933
IN FACT OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS 

234
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,501
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION'S 

235
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:20,606
WATCH NORTH KOREA HAS PERFECTED 

236
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,507
ITS MISSILES, AND TESTED IT'S 

237
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:25,511
LARGEST NUCLEAR DETONATION 

238
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,580
RATHER THAN ANY STEPS TO 

239
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,080
DISMANTLE ITS PROGRAM. 

240
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,049
IT SEEMS THE LEADER OF NORTH 

241
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,918
KOREA GOT EVERYTHING HE WANTED 

242
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:32,418
INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL 

243
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,220
RECOGNITION AND THE SUSPENSION 

244
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,620
OF UNITED STATES MILITARY 

245
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:35,921
EXERCISES. 

246
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,256
THIS WEEK'S REPORTS OF 

247
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,623
DISMANTLEMENT AT A LAUNCHING 

248
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,525
STATION MAY BE GOOD NEWS BUT IT 

249
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,061
MAY BE A SIGNAL THAT NORTH 

250
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,832
KOREA HAS COMPLETED ALL THE 

251
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,432
TESTING IT NEEDS TO. 

252
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,934
FRANKLY THE AGREEMENT SEEMS 

253
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,836
MORE OF THE ART OF CONCESSIONS 

254
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,371
THAN THE ART OF THE DEAL. 

255
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,939
WE ARE WEAKER FOR IT. 

256
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,107
LAST WEEK RUSSIA AND CHINA 

257
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,710
BLOCKED A UNITED STATES REQUEST 

258
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,013
TO IMPOSE PENALTIES ON 

259
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,014
SANCTIONS VIOLATIONS CALLING 

260
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,583
OUR MAXIMUM PRESSURE POSTURE 

261
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,317
INTO QUESTION. 

262
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,619
AS YOU KNOW I HAVE INTRODUCED 

263
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,420
OVERSIGHT LEGISLATION ALONG 

264
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,056
WITH SENATOR GARDNER TO PROVIDE 

265
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,024
THE SORT OF SUPPORT AND 

266
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,194
GUIDANCE THAT THIS EFFORT NEEDS 

267
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:15,761
AND EXERCISE THE OVERSIGHT 

268
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,363
RESPONSIBILITY CONGRESS OWES TO 

269
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:17,830
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

270
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,266
GOAL THAT YOU HAVE LAID OUT 

271
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:20,967
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ARE 

272
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:21,367
INCORPORATED. 

273
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,636
FINALLY LET ME RAISE ONE MORE 

274
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,204
DEEPLY ALARMING ISSUE THAT 

275
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:25,604
BROKE THIS WEEK. 

276
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:28,107
I UNDERSTAND THAT DESPITE ITS 

277
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,408
ABILITY TO STOP THE RIDICULOUS 

278
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,144
IDEA THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS 

279
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,347
ABOUT TO ALLOW INTERNET POSTING 

280
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,417
OF DO IT YOURSELF 3D PRINTABLE 

281
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:38,850
FIREARM BLUEPRINTS. 

282
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,153
WHY ON EARTH WOULD THE TRUMP 

283
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:41,988
ADMINISTRATION MAKE IT EASIER 

284
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:47,760
FOR TERRORISTS AND GUN MEN TO 

285
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,395
PRODUCE UNDETECTABLE PLASTIC 

286
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:49,595
GUNS? 

287
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:54,066
I REMAIN DEEPLY CONCERNED BY 

288
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:54,800
THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEWS. 

289
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,168
WE NEED STRATEGIES ACROSS THE 

290
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,237
WORLD BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THE 

291
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,940
LACK IS CHAOS AND CONFUSION OR 

292
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,273
EVEN WORSE. 

293
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:02,942
I RECOGNIZE THE PRESIDENT 

294
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,610
CONSIDERS HIMSELF TO BE A 

295
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,512
MASTERFUL DEAL MAKER AND A VERY 

296
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:06,946
STABLE GENIUS. 

297
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,247
WE NEED TO CALL THE PRESIDENT'S 

298
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,315
STATEMENTS OUT FOR WHAT THEY 

299
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,585
ARE, AT THIS POINT I FIND THEM 

300
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,419
TO BE MISLEADING AND 

301
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:13,719
UNTRUTHFUL. 

302
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,887
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 

303
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,623
TESTIMONY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE 

304
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,657
TRUTH REALLY IS. 

305
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:18,991
THANK YOU. 

306
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,359

WE WELCOME YOU AGAIN AND -- YOU 

310
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,767
CAN SUMMARIZE YOUR COMMONS.

WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 

312
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,371
TESTIMONY. 

313
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:32,771
>>  GOOD AFTERNOON.  

314
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,890
THE LAST FEW WEEKS I HAVE 

315
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,559
ENGAGED IN THREE AREAS OF 

316
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,594
PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THIS 

317
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:55,894
COMMITTEE. 

318
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:56,795
NORTH KOREA, NATO AND RUSSIA. 

319
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,197
THE SUBJECT OF RUSSIA I WANT TO 

320
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,765
BRING SOMETHING TO YOUR 

321
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,467
ATTENTION RIGHT OFF THE BAT 

322
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:01,700
TODAY. 

323
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,572
TODAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

324
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,673
IS RELEASING THE CRIMEA 

325
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,006
DECLARATION.

ONE PART READS AS FOLLOW. 

329
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,948
THE UNITED STATES CALLS ON 

330
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,349
RUSSIA TO RESPECT THE 

331
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:20,352
PRINCIPLES AND TO END ITS 

332
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:20,919
OCCUPATION OF CRIMEA. 

333
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,720
END OF QUOTE. 

334
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,088
I WANT TO SHOW THIS COMMITTEE 

335
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:26,792
THAT THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT 

336
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,094
AND WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE 

337
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:30,329
ANNEXING OF CRIMEA. 

338
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,598
WE STAND TOGETHER WITH THE 

339
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,101
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN OUR 

340
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,602
COMMITMENT TO UKRAINE . THERE 

341
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,671
WILL BE NO RELIEF OF SANCTIONS 

342
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:43,476
UNTIL RUSSIA RETURNS CONTROL OF 

343
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,542
THE PENINSULA TO UKRAINE. 

344
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:50,950
THIS FORMAL EYES UNITED STATES 

345
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,851
POLICY OF NONRECOGNITION. 

346
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,185
THERE'S ANOTHER PROGRESS.  

347
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:02,728
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. 

348
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,997
ONE THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN 

349
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:05,865
ENGAGING IN SOMETHING THE STATE 

350
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,134
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON 

351
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:08,534
AS WELL.  

352
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:27,519
IN DECEMBER. 

353
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,521
IN LATE APRIL I STARTED 

354
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,289
EXECUTING ON THE STRATEGY OF 

355
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,292
SECRETARY STATE AND TODAY ON

359

THESE PRINCIPLES HAVE DIVIDE 

360
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,318
OUR ACTIONS ON NORTH KOREA. 

361
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,886
THE PRESIDENT'S DIPLOMACY 

362
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,221
DEESCALATED A SITUATION WHICH 

363
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,623
THE PROSPECT FOR CONFLICT WAS 

364
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,224
RISING DAILY. 

365
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,592
AMERICANS ARE SAFER BECAUSE OF 

366
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,092
HIS ACTIONS. 

367
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,829
AS FAR THE GOALS ON NORTH 

368
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,163
KOREA, NOTHING HAS CHANGED. 

369
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:16,001
OUR OBJECTIVE REMAINS THE 

370
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:16,902
FINAL, FULL, DENUCLEARIZATION 

371
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,170
AS AGREED TO. 

372
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,072
FOLLOW UP TO THE PRESIDENT'S

375
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,041
ON JULY 5TH I TRAVELED TO NORTH

SINGAPOR. 

379
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,016
WE ARE ENGAGED IN PATIENT 

380
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,419
DIPLOMACY BUT WON'T LET IT DRAG 

381
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,054
OUT TO NO END. 

382
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,523
I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE 

383
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:37,956
DISCUSSIONS I HAD. 

384
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:40,926
THE PRESIDENT REMAIN UP BEAT 

385
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,228
ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR 

386
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,297
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

387
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,665
PROGRESS IS MANY HAING. 

388
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,634
WE NEED CHAIRMAN KIM TO FOLLOW 

389
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,568
THROUGH ON HIS MINTMENTS. 

390
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,536
UNTIL THEY ELIMINATE THEIR 

391
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,539
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OUR 

392
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,909
SANCTIONS AND THOSE THAT THE 

393
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,011
UNITED NATIONS WILL REMAIN IN 

394
00:12:59,011 --> 00:12:59,244
EFFECT. 

395
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:00,045
MULTIPLE UN SECURITY COUNCIL 

396
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,413
RESOLUTIONS REQUIRE THEM TO 

397
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,284
ELIMINATE ALL OF THEIR WEAPONS 

398
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,685
OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND MISSILE 

399
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,687
PROGRAMS. 

400
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,890
THOSE WERE PASSED AND THEY 

401
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,324
REMAIN BINDING. 

402
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,059
WE NEED EVERY SINGLE NATION TO 

403
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,327
MAINTAIN THE ENFORCEMENTS OF 

404
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,863
THOSE SANCTIONS TO WHICH EVERY 

405
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,630
NATION IS COMMITTED. 

406
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,733
THE PATH AHEAD IS NOT EASY BUT 

407
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,935
OUR HOPES FOR ASSEVER WORLD AND 

408
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,603
A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR NORTH 

409
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,037
KOREA ENDURE. 

410
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,273
THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 

411
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,908
ALSO CALLS FOR PEACE THROUGH 

412
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,208
STRENGTH. 

413
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,510
THE PRESIDENT'S ENGAGEMENT ON 

414
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,112
NATO HAS HE RESULTED IN GREATER 

415
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,549
BURDEN SHARE THAT WILL 

416
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,950
STRENGTHEN THE ALLIANCE AGAINST 

417
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,217
THREATS. 

418
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:42,555
ALLIES HAVE SPENT MORE THAN $40 

419
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,255
MILLION IN INCREASED DEFENSE 

420
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,556
SPENDING SINCE 2016. 

421
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:45,891
THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS OF 

422
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:51,230
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE IN THE 

423
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,563
YEARS AHEAD. 

424
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,331
LAST YEAR'S 14.4 BILLION IN NEW 

425
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:57,469
SPENDING WAS A 5.1 INCREASE IN 

426
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,540
THE LARGEST IN A GENERATION. 

427
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,408
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS 

428
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:07,246
DEMANDING THAT EVERY COUNTRY 

429
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,414
MAKE IT'S OWN COMMITMENT. 

430
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:12,918
NATO WILL REMAIN A PILLAR OF 

431
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:13,785
AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY. 

432
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:16,088
WE KNOW WEAKNESS PROVOKES OUR 

433
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:16,688
ENEMIES BUT STRENGTH PROTECT 

434
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:17,356
US. 

435
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,357
THE MORE EVERY MEMBER 

436
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,460
CONTRIBUTES THE BETTER THE 

437
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,561
ALLIANCE CAN DEFER THREATS. 

438
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,298
THIS IS THE INCREASED 

439
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,033
COMMITMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT 

440
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,266
WANTS. 

441
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:28,767
FROM THE OUTSET THIS 

442
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,369
ADMINISTRATION THE NATIONAL 

443
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,270
DEFENSE STRATEGY AND THE RUSSIA 

444
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,439
INTEGRATED STRATEGY THE 

445
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,640
APPROACH HAS BEEN THE SAME. 

446
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,110
TO RAISE THE COST OF AGGRESSION 

447
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,746
UNTIL PUTIN PICKS A LEFT 

448
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,714
CONFRONTATIONAL FOREIGN POLICY 

449
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,650
WHICH KEEPING THE PROGRAM OPEN 

450
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,050
FOR DIALOGUE. 

451
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,351
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA 

452
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:52,124
POSSESS OVER 90% OF WORLD'S 

453
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:52,491
NUCLEAR WEAPON. 

454
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,826
THEY 14 NOT HAVE A BAD 

455
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,159
RELATIONSHIP. 

456
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,294
THIS IS NOT JUST IN OUR 

457
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,062
INTEREST BUT IN THE INTEREST OF 

458
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,395
THE ORLANDO. 

459
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:58,897
HE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT NOW IS 

460
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,299
THE TIME FOR DIRECT 

461
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:00,766
COMMUNICATION AND OUR 

462
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,466
RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO MAKE 

463
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:04,069
SEARCH TO PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT 

464
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,703
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY, 

465
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,040
HOWEVER REMOTE IT MAY BE TO 

466
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,942
REVERSE THE NEGATIVE COURSE OF 

467
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:10,342
OUR RELATIONSHIP. 

468
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,543
OTHERWISE THE ADMINISTRATION 

469
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,712
WILL CONTINUE TO IMPOSE TOUGH 

470
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,948
ACTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA IN 

471
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:16,949
RESPONSE TO ITS ACTIVITIES. 

472
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,884
WE CAN'T MAKE PROGRESS ON 

473
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,488
ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN UNLESS 

474
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,690
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM. 

475
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,993
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT FOR 

476
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:28,460
YEARS. 

477
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,661
I'M REFERRING TO STOPPING 

478
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,997
TERORISM STOPPING THE CIVIL 

479
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:32,965
WAR IN SYRIA, ENSURING SECURITY 

480
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,802
FOR ISRAEL AND HUTTING TOWN ALL 

481
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,037
OF IRAN'S MALIGN ACTIVITIES. 

482
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,605
ON THE SUBJECT OF IRAN THE 

483
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,540
PRESIDENT HAS SAID IRAN IS THE 

484
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,475
NO THE SAME COUNTRY AS FIVE 

485
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,444
MONTHS BASSOS OUR CAMPAIGN OF 

486
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,745
FINANCIAL PRESSURE, AND OUR 

487
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,448
FULL THROATED SUPPORT FOR THE 

488
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,752
PEOPLE OF IRAN IN ARE HAVING AN 

489
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:53,985
IMPACT. 

490
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:56,689
WE SOUGHT TO LOOK AT IF RUSSIA 

491
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,289
WANTED TO IMPROVE OUR 

492
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,559
RELATIONSHIP BUT MADE CLEAR THE 

493
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,494
BALL IS IN RUSSIA'S COURT. 

494
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,896
WE DEFENDED AMERICA'S STRATEGIC 

495
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,530
INTERESTS IN SYRIA AND UKRAINE 

496
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,032
AND I MADE CLEAR TO THE RUSSIAS 

497
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,602
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES FOR 

498
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,236
INTERFERENCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC 

499
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:11,536
PROCESSES. 

500
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:12,671
I WOULD ADD THAT THE PRESIDENT 

501
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,072
IS A WARE OF THE CHALLENGES 

502
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,874
THAT RUSSIA POSES TO THE UNITED 

503
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:16,474
STATES AND OUR PARTNERS. 

504
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:19,511
HE HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF 

505
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,011
ACTIONS TO PROTECT OUR 

506
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:20,311
INTERESTS. 

507
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:25,384
AS JUST A FEW PIECES OF PROOF I 

508
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,086
WOULD PSYCHE TO SITE THE 

509
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:27,386
FOLLOWING. 

510
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,589
213 SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA GROUP 

511
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:30,989
ANDS INDIVIDUALS. 

512
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:31,623
60 RUSSIAN SPIES EXPELL FROM 

513
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,360
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN 

514
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,565
THE CLOSURE OF THE CONSULAT 

515
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,434
ACTION IN SEATTLE. 

516
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,969
THE CLOSURE EVER RUSSIA'S 

517
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,437
CONSULATE IN SAN FRANCISCO. 

518
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,374
CUTTING UNITED STATES STARRING 

519
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,776
BY RUSSIA BY ALMOST 70%. 

520
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,379
150 MILITARY EXERCISES HAVE 

521
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,213
BEEN PARTICIPATED IN EUROPE 

522
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:55,714
THIS YEAR ALONE. 

523
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,884
MORE THAN 11 BILLION HAVE BEEN 

524
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,487
PUT FORWARD FOR THE EUROPEAN 

525
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,020
DEFENSE INITIATIVE. 

526
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,423
WE MADE DEFENSIVE WEAPONS 

527
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,223
AVAILABLE TO UKRAINE AND TO 

528
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:05,523
GEORGIA. 

529
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,626
JUST LAST WEEK THE DEPARTMENT 

530
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:07,925
OF DEFENSE. 

531
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:10,028
THIS IS AFTER THE SUMMIT ADDED 

532
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,998
ANOTHER $200 MILLION IN 

533
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:13,832
SECURITY COOPERATION FUNDS TO 

534
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,098
UKRAINE. 

535
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:17,336
NONE OF THIS HAPPENED FOR THE 

536
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,670
EIGHT YEARS THAT PRECEDED 

537
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,069
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

538
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,771
IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU. 

539
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,673
THERE'S A LONG LIST I'M HAPPY 

540
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,073
TO GO THROUGH IT. 

541
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,709
I'M GUESSING SOMETIME TODAY I 

542
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,909
WILL GET THAT OPPORTUNITY. 

543
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:25,544
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. 

544
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,945
FINALLY I WANT TO YOU KNOW THAT 

545
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:33,285
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID ACCEPTS 

546
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,219
THE CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIA 

547
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,187
PLEDLED IN THE ELECTION. 

548
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:36,821
HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAPPENED. 

549
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:37,055
I KNOW. 

550
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:42,161
I BRIEFED HIM ON IT FOR OVER A 

551
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:42,928
YEAR. 

552
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,029
THIS IS PERFECTLY CLEAR TO ME. 

553
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,497
I AM ALSO CERTAIN THAT HE 

554
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,233
DEEPLY RESPECTS THE DIFFICULT 

555
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,635
AND DANGEROUS WORK THAT OUR 

556
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,435
PATRIOTS IN THE INTELLIGENCE 

557
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,803

00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:48,566
CAN ANSWER FOR ME. 

744
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:49,033
>>  GREAT. 

745
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,402
>>  YOU AREN'T GOING TO ANSWER 

746
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,771
ANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD 

747
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:56,141
GET US TO THE TRUTH. 

748
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,076
AS CIA DIRECTOR YOU SAID YOU 

749
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,710
EXPECT RUSSIA TO CONTINUE ITS 

750
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,981
ATTACKS BY ATTEMPTING TO 

751
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,450
INTERFERE IN THE MIDTERM 

752
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:05,750
ELECTIONS. 

753
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,152
IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH PUTIN 

754
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,788
I HOPE THE PRESIDENT LAID OUT 

755
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:10,255
THE CONSEQUENCES OF 

756
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,289
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2018 

757
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,891
ELECTION BUT I KNOW YOU CAN'T 

758
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,158
TELL ME. 

759
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:13,491
>>  I CAN. 

760
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:15,093
>>  YOU WANT TO SHARE THAT ONE. 

761
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,229
THAT ONE YOU WANT TO SHARE? 

762
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,798
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS DISCLOSED 

763
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,064
THAT ONE. 

764
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,400
THE PRESIDENT DISCLOSED WHAT HE 

765
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,301
SAID TO PUTIN ABOUT RUSSIA 

766
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,402
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTIONS 

767
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,770
AND HE SAID THAT HE IS 

768
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,374
CONFIDENT THAT AS A RESULT OF 

769
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,041
THAT CONVERSATION PUTIN 

770
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:30,942
UNDERSTANDS IT WON'T BE 

771
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:31,209
TOLERATE. 

772
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:35,080
>>  I WISH HE SAID THAT IN 

773
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,946
PUBLIC IN HELSINKI. 

774
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:38,250
WE ARE WORKING ON A BILL TO 

775
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,283
HOLD RUSSIA RESPONSIBLE. 

776
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,285
GIVEN THAT YOU ASSERT THE 

777
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:40,852
ADMINISTRATION IS TOUGH ON 

778
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:41,987
RUSSIA WILL YOU COMMIT TO 

779
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,321
WORKING WITH US ON A NEW 

780
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,422
SANCTIONS BILL? 

781
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,590
>>  YES. 

782
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,994
>>  THANK YOU. 

783
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:49,827
>>  NORTH KOREA. 

784
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:53,098

NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU SINCE 

791
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,275
SINCE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING 

792
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,076
AS IT RELATES TO NORTH KOREA. 

793
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:09,781
DID NORTH KOREA AGREE WITH OUR 

794
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,849
DEFINITION OF DENUCLEARIZATION 

795
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,717
MEAN THE REMOVAL OF ALL NUCLEAR 

796
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:13,452
WEAPON FACILITIES, TECHNOLOGY 

797
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,419

798
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,922
>>  I THINK I CAN ANSWER BUT 

799
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,624
LET ME START BY SAYING I'M 

800
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,124

00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:29,801
THOSE. 

806
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,203

WITHOUT DISCLOSING THE CONTENTS 

808
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,538
OF THE NEGOTIATION. 

809
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,542
I AM VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE 

810
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,679
NORTH KOREAS UNDERSTAND OUR 

811
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,447
DEFINITION OF DENUCLEARIZATION 

812
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,448
THAT GOES FROM INFRASTRUCTURE. 

813
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:43,948
>>  WE UNDERSTAND THAT. 

814
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:46,184

AND THEY. 

819
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,523
>>  THEY UNDERSTAND IT BUT 

820
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:51,856
DIDN'T AGREE. 

821
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:55,327
DID THEY AGREE TO END THE 

822
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:55,827
PRODUCTION OF URANIUM? 

823
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,961
>>  I WOULD WELCOME THE CHANCE 

824
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,930

830
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,577
>>  DID -- DID NORTH KOREA 

831
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,479
AGREE TO END THE PRODUCTION OF 

832
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:18,083

LET ME SAY THAT AS FAR AS WHAT 

863
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,267
HAPPENED AT THE NATO SUMMIT. 

864
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,969
VERY FEW AMERICANS HEARD 

865
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:11,970
ANYTHING EXSEPTEMBER THE 

866
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,572
ARGUMENT THAT WENT ON ABOUT THE 

867
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:14,839
FUNDING. 

868
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,540
NOW I KNOW THE PRESIDENT

BELIEVES AND I KNOW YOU BELIEVE 

870
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,011
AND I BELIEVE AND I THINK MOST 

871
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,712
EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT NATO IS 

872
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:22,914
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MILITARY 

873
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,816
ALLIANCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

874
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,049
WORLD. 

875
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,519
AS YOU POINTED OUT IT'S ONE OF 

876
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,620
THE PILLARS OF OUR NATIONAL 

877
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,954
SECURITY AND ONE THAT WE NEED 

878
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:34,359
TO SUPPORT AND ONE WE NEED TO 

879
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:34,659
WORK WELL. 

880
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,862
THERE ARE VERY FEW DOWNSIDES OF 

881
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,964
NATO BUT THERE IS ONE AND THE 

882
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:42,967
PRESIDENT HAS -- UNDER SCORED 

883
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,169
THAT PUBLICLY AND WELL. 

884
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,737
HIS PREDECESSOR ATTEMPTED TO DO 

885
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:46,037
IT. 

886
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,038
ALL THEIR PREDECESSORS TRIED TO 

887
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:47,605
DO IT. 

888
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,008
ALL THOSE OF US THAT MEET WITH 

889
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:50,909
THE EUROPEANS FROM TIME TO TIME 

890
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,545
UNDER SCORE IT AND THAT IS THE 

891
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,315
FUNDING OR THE LACK OF FUND 

892
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,116
THAT THE EUROPEANS HAVE DONE. 

893
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,987
ONLY EIGHT OF THE -- THE NATO 

894
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,321
NATIONS ARE ACTUALLY MEETING 

895
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,221
THE COMMITMENT OF 2%. 

896
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:10,527
THE FIRST OF ALL THE PRESIDENT 

897
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:11,863
IS TO BE COMMENDED FOR UNDER 

898
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,164
SCORING THIS AND GETTING THEM 

899
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,700
TO START TALKING ABOUT IT AND 

900
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,568
NOW FINALLY STARTING TO AGREE 

901
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:16,935
TO THAT. 

902
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,002
THERE WERE OTHER THINGS THAT 

903
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,337
WERE LOST AS FAR AS THAT 

904
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,771
MEETING AND I WOULD LIKE TO YOU 

905
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:24,642
TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS FOR A 

906
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:24,975
FEW MEMBERS. 

907
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:28,847
NUMBER ONE IS ON THE DETERRANT 

908
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:32,417
SIDE SPEEDING UP THE TIME TO 

909
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,952
TAKES ALLIES TO PUT TOGETHER 

910
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,620
AND DEPLOY FORCES. 

911
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,355
THE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE MOBILITY 

912
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,658
AND ENHANCE THE SPEED AT WHICH 

913
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,859
THEY CAN MAKE DECISIONS. 

914
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:45,630
THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND 

915
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,465
INCREASE IN ALLIED RESILENCE 

916
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,567
AGAINST TERRORIST THREATS 

917
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,703
THROUGH A NEW FRAMEWORK TO 

918
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,239
SHARE BIOMETRIC TASTE DATA AND 

919
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:59,144
OPPORTUNITY FOR MACEDONIA TO BE 

920
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,411
INVITED TO JOIN NATO. 

921
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:04,015
THAT WAS A POISIVE STEP. 

922
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,750
COULD YOU COMMENT ON THOSE 

923
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,152
VOLUNTARY IMPORTANT STEPS 

924
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,654
FORWARD THAT HAPPENED AT THE 

925
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:09,887
SUMMIT? 

926
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:14,859
>>  IT WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE 

927
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,260
SUMMIT. 

928
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,194
FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 

929
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,695
SECRETARY GENERAL HE SAID AMONG 

930
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,864
THE MOST PRODUCT I HAD BEEN A 

931
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,131
PART OF. 

932
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:24,669
HE HAS BEEN DOING THIS A LITTLE 

933
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:25,537
WHILE. 

934
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,741
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 430. 

935
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,443
30 SQUADRONS, 30 BATTALIONS, 

936
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:31,776
AND 30NAVAL. 

937
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,144
IT'S SOMETHING NATO HASN'T BEEN 

938
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,445
READY TO DO IN SOME TIME. 

939
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:35,546
NOW THERE'S A REAL COMMITMENT. 

940
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,949
WITH VERY TO MAKE SURE THAT 2 

941
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:38,249
HAPPENS. 

942
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,952
IT WOULD BE I GREAT THING TO 

943
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,787
DETER RUSSIA IF WE CAN GET 

944
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,489
THOSE COUNTRIES AND OUR ALLIES 

945
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,723
TO GET TO THAT LEVEL. 

946
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:46,324
YOU TALKED ABOUT BURDEN 

947
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,492
SHARING. 

948
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,595
IT SEEMS TO GET ALL THE FOCUS. 

949
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:56,167
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE 

950
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,769
EUROPEANS ARE AS COMMITTED TO 

951
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,337
DEFERRING RUSSIA AND NEED TO 

952
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,372
SHOW THAT THROUGH THEIR DOLLARS 

953
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:01,773
AND LEADINESS.  

954
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,189
TALKED ABOUT THE RISK THAT 

955
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,158
CREATES TO THE AYALA,AS AND THE 

956
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,793
EVENT THAT RUSSIA SHOULD DECIDE 

957
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:25,997
TO USE ENERGY AS A WEAPON TO 

958
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,699
COERCE FORMERLY ORRIN FORMERLY 

959
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,400
GERMANY OR OTHER COUNTRIES. 

960
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,903
HE RACED TO THE FOREFRONT AND 

961
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,737
THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 

962
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,872
UNDERSTAND THAT RISK AND 

963
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,641
SUPPORT AMERICA AND OUR 

964
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,276
POSITION ON THAT AS WELL. 

965
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,844
AND TALKED ABOUT THE NATO 

966
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:40,545
MISSION. 

967
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,446
IT'S NEW ROLE IN FIGHTING 

968
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:41,746
TERRORISM. 

969
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,948
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SO 

970
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,883
MANY OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRY 

971
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:46,651
THAT HAVE STEPPED FORWARD. 

972
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,286
EVEN JUST THIS PAST FEW -- I 

973
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:52,290
GUESS IT'S NOW TWO WEEKS SINCE 

974
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,623
THE SUMMIT. 

975
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:55,894
OVER A THOUSAND ADDITIONAL 

976
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,428
COMMITMENTS FROM ALLIED NATO 

977
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,598
PARTNERS HEADED TO HELP US IN 

978
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,700
OPERATION LESS LUTE SUPPOR  IN 

979
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,101
AFGHANISTAN. 

980
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:03,634
IT'S A GREAT COMMITMENT. 

981
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:04,402
SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT WORKED 

982
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,471
HARD ON AT THE SUMMIT AND GOOD 

983
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:06,971
OUTCOMES FORMER. 

984
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,974
>>  THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

985
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,208
YOU ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR 

986
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:14,345
THOSE GREAT SUCCESSES AS IS THE 

987
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,647
PRESIDENT FOR LEADING IN THAT 

988
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,048
REGARD. 

989
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,349
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT OUR 

990
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,651
FRIENDS AND ALLIES, FEATHERS 

991
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,052
WERE RUFFLED A LITTLE BIT JUST 

992
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,888
BECAUSE WE SAID THEY WEREN'T 

993
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:24,355
PAYING THEIR BILLS. 

994
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,590
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME 

995
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,225
TIME AND I THINK WE WILL 

996
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,860
TOLERATE THAT BUT THEY HAVE GOT 

997
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,194
TO STEP UP AND I KNOW YOU UNDER 

998
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:33,164
SCORED THAT AND THE PRESIDENT 

999
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,399
HAS UNDER SCORED THAT. 

1000
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,870
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IRAN FOR 

1001
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,603
JUST A MOMENT. 

1002
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:42,573
ONE OF -- THE BIG UNREPORTED 

1003
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:45,376
STORIES AS FAR AS FOREIGN 

1004
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,946
RELATIONS IS CONCERNED IS THE 

1005
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,414
ISSUES AND THE DIFFICULTIES 

1006
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:53,551
THAT THE IRAN PEOPLE ARE HAVING 

1007
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:53,851
INTERNALLY. 

1008
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:54,418
FINANCIALLY AND OTHERWISE. 

1009
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,287
I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT IN A 

1010
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,790
CLASSIFIED SETTING BUT THERE IS 

1011
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,491
SOME OPEN REPORTING ON THESE 

1012
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,594
SOURCES AND THE GOVERNMENT 

1013
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,595
THAT'S THERE IS STRUGGLING WITH 

1014
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:04,795
THIS. 

1015
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:05,697
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY 

1016
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,698
THEY TRIED TO POKE THE 

1017
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,700
PRESIDENT THE OTHER DAY TO TRY 

1018
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,803
TO TAKE THEIR -- TRY TO TAKE 

1019
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,271
THE HEAT OFF OF THE -- HEAT 

1020
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,073
THEY ARE GETTING AT HOME. 

1021
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,542
COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT 

1022
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,977
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON 

1023
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:19,277
INTERNALLY? 

1024
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:24,482
KNOWING THAT WE ARE IN -- IN AN 

1025
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:24,882
OPEN SETTING? 

1026
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:28,486
>>  SENATOR THERE IS -- HUGE 

1027
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,288
ECONOMIC CHALLENGE INSIDE OF 

1028
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:30,588
IRAN TODAY. 

1029
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,324
IT'S AN ECONOMIC STRUCTURE THAT 

1030
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:33,657
DOESN'T WORK. 

1031
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:41,466
WHEN YOU ARE A COUNTRY OF THAT 

1032
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,033
SCALE THAT FORMENTS TERROR, 

1033
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:47,471
CONDUCTS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS 

1034
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:52,243
IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, 

1035
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:52,843
PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR ASSAD, 

1036
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:55,480
THAT'S EXPENSIVE. 

1037
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,681
I THINK THE IRAN PEOPLE PEOPLE 

1038
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,883
ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT'S NOT 

1039
00:31:58,883 --> 00:31:59,484
WHAT THEY WANT. 

1040
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,587
THAT THE IRAN EXPANSION THAT 

1041
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,387
THE SUPREME LEADER SO FAVORS IS 

1042
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:04,021
NOT WHAT THEY WANT. 

1043
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:09,226
I THINK ARE YOU STARTING TO SEE 

1044
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,462
THECONOMIC IMPACT COMBINED 

1045
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:11,963
THAT 2 WAS.  

1046
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:25,543
THE UNDERSTANDING HAS BEEN 

1047
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,811
RAPID OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. 

1048
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,180
> Y. IT'S -- I THINK THAT IT'S 

1049
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,681
-- ITS BEEN GOING ON LONGER 

1050
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:30,981
THAN THAT. 

1051
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:33,985
>>  ITS BEEN GOING ON LONGER 

1052
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:34,986
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE 

1053
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:35,319
ACCELERATION. 

1054
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,220
>>  THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT. 

1055
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,356
>>  THANK YOU. 

1056
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:43,394
>>  IF I COULD JUST -- ONE 

1057
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:43,961
INTERJECTION. 

1058
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,129
I KNOW THE WORDS PAYING THEIR 

1059
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,198
BILLS MAN ABOUT SPICE WE NEED 

1060
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,532
EVERY NATO COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE 

1061
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:51,235
CONTRIBUTING 2% TO DEFENSE AND 

1062
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,907
I HAVE NOTICED THOSE NEAR THE 

1063
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,174
RUSSIAN BORDER ALWAYS DO. 

1064
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:57,909
THERE'S -- THAT'S A 

1065
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:58,709
MISUNDERSTANDING. 

1066
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,879
WE WANT THEM TO CONTRIBUTE AT 

1067
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:02,146
LEAST 2%. 

1068
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,315
THEY ARE NOT NOT PAYING BILLS 

1069
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,617
TO THE UNITED STATES AS 

1070
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,685
SOMETIMES IS PROJECTED, IS THAT 

1071
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,386
CORRECT? 

1072
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,422
>>  THE SHORT FALLS THAT THE 

1073
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,924
PRESIDENT IDENTIFIED ARE IN TWO 

1074
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:13,191
BUCKETS. 

1075
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,725
THERE IS A NATO COMMON FUND 

1076
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:15,692
THAT'S CONTRIBUTED TO BY EVERY 

1077
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:18,062
NATION AND THE UNITED STATES IS 

1078
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,330
BY FAR THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR 

1079
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,832
OF THAT FUND AND THEN MONEY 

1080
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,733
THAT ARE PAID FOR NATIONS TO 

1081
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:25,236
RAISE THEIR OWN MILITARIES AND 

1082
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:25,770
TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. 

1083
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,405
THAT'S THE 2% NUMBER TO WHICH 

1084
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:27,738
WE HAVE BEEN. 

1085
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,574
>>  DEPTHS NOT -- IT WOULD BE A 

1086
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,708
MISUNDERSTANDING TO SAY -- TO 

1087
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,343
MAKE IT APPEAR THAT THEY AREN'T 

1088
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,346
PAYING BILLS TO THE UNITED 

1089
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,080
STATES. 

1090
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,180
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

1091
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,616
THAT'S CORRECT. 

1092
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:39,884
>>  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 

1093
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,619
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE 

1094
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,621
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INVITE 

1095
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,556
MR. PUTIN TO THE UNITED STATES 

1096
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,725
TO FOLLOW UP ON THE 

1097
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,460
UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED IN THE 

1098
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:49,693
SUMMIT. 

1099
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:51,829
CAN YOU BRIEFLY SAY WHAT THOSE 

1100
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,931
UNDERSTANDINGS IROR AGREEMENTS 

1101
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,033
AT THE MEETING? 

1102
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:56,300
>>  SURE.

1103
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,467
I CAN --  

1104
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,620
IT'LL BE BUSINESS LEADERS THAT 

1105
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,120
WANT TO PARTICIPATE. 

1106
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,222
I UNDERSTAND THIS WENT ON FOR 

1107
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,458
YEARS AND YEARS AND WAS . 

1108
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,893
>>  IF WE COULD DO IT BRIEFLY. 

1109
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,128
I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO GIVE A 

1110
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,495
COMPLETE THING. 

1111
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,364
>>  IT'S WHAT YOU ASKED FOR. 

1112
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,866
>>  I UNDERSTAND. 

1113
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,400
BUSINESS TO BUSINESS. 

1114
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,068
NEXT ISSUE. 

1115
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,436
>>  THE PRESIDENT -- HAS ASKED 

1116
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,572
US TO LOOK AT REESTABLISHING A 

1117
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,206
COUNTER TERRORISM COUNCIL THAT 

1118
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,208
WAS HELD AT THE LEVEL OF THE 

1119
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,210
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 

1120
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,147
MANY YEARS BUT HAD STOPPED. 

1121
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:46,216
I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. 

1122
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,652
>>  COUNTER TERRORISM 

1123
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:49,320
COOPERATION. 

1124
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,456
>>  WE ARE WORKING TO SEE IN 

1125
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:54,824
SYRIA WHAT ARE THE 

1126
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:55,927
POSSIBILITIES THAT CAN BE 

1127
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,529
ACHIEVED SO THAT THE NOW 

1128
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,566
BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN MILLION 

1129
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,834
DISPLACED PEOPLE HAVE THE 

1130
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:04,868
OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN. 

1131
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,637
WE MADE IT CLEAR IT SHOULD 

1132
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,905
HAPPEN IN GENEVA BUT WE ARE 

1133
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,508
WORKING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET 

1134
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,410
RUSSIA TO BE MORE COOPERATIVE 

1135
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,179
IN TERMS OF DRIVING TOWARD A 

1136
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,915
POLITICAL RESOLUTION THAT WOULD 

1137
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,884
TAKE DOWN THE VIOLENCE LEVELS 

1138
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:20,818
AND CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO START 

1139
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:25,490
A LIKAL RESOLUTION OF THE 

1140
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,990
PROCESS IN SYRIA. 

1141
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,059
>>  ANY DISCUSSIONS ON 

1142
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,560
SANCTIONS, ON YOU SAID THERE

>>  NO SENATOR. 

1146
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,102
>>  WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION 

1147
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,705
ABOUT -- CERTAIN NAMES 

1148
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,940
ASSOCIATED WITH HIM CAME OUT. 

1149
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,343
WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ON THE 

1150
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,310
THE SANCTIONS? 

1151
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,645
>>  THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE. 

1152
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,714
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU WILL 

1153
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:50,848
REFERRING TO. 

1154
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,150
LET ME MAKE CLEAR. 

1155
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,217
THE UNITED STATES WILL DEFEND 

1156
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,651
OUR TEAM IN THE FIELD AND THE 

1157
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,854
TEAM THAT'S BEEN IN THE FIELD 

1158
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,457
WHEN IT RETIRES AND LEAVES THE 

1159
00:35:59,457 --> 00:35:59,890
FIELD. 

1160
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,624
WE UNDERSTAND THAT AMERICANS 

1161
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:01,559
DESERVE THE PROTECTION OF THE 

1162
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,761
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BOTH 

1163
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,563
DURING THEIR TIME IN SERVICE 

1164
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,096
AND AFTER. 

1165
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:09,366
>>  WAS THERE ANY AGREEMENTS 

1166
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:12,737
REACHED IN REGARDS TO UKRAINE? 

1167
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:12,970
>>  NO.

1168
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,404
AGREE TO DISAGREE. 

1169
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,606
THAT IS -- THE UNITED STATES 

1170
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:21,712
POLICY HASN'T CHANGED YOU CAN 

1171
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:21,979
SEE THAT. 

1172
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:22,312
$200MILLION. 

1173
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:23,214
SINCE THE HELSINKI SUMMIT 

1174
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,048
PROVIDED TO THE UKRAINE YANS. 

1175
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,117
I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF 

1176
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,684
CONCERN THAT -- I SAW IT. 

1177
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:30,655
I COULD FIND YOU ALL THE QUOTES 

1178
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,255
IF YOU WANT. 

1179
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,690
CONCERNS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1180
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,891
WOULD MAKE A CHANGE IN POSITION 

1181
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,524
WITH RESPECT TO. 

1182
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:36,093
>> AND YOU MADE THAT CLEAR. 

1183
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,962
>>  AND THERE IS NO CHANGE. 

1184
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,632
IT IS -- IT IS A POLICY THAT 

1185
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,834
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 

1186
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,568
REFUSED TO UNDERTAKE. 

1187
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:50,141
I HERE COMPARISONS -- IT'S 

1188
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:50,541
IMPORTANT. 

1189
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,074
COMPARISON MATTERS HERE. 

1190
00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:53,277
THERE'S A NARR ATIVE THAT IS HE 

1191
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,045
IS WEAK ON RUSSIA WHEN THE 

1192
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,545
OPPOSITE IS TRUE. 

1193
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,447
>>  I HEARD YOU TALK AND BRAG 

1194
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,048
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SANCTIONS. 

1195
00:36:58,048 --> 00:36:58,882
>>  THEY WERE JUST FACTS. 

1196
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:01,952
>>  FACT THAT THE CONGRESS 

1197
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:04,555
PASSED THE STATUE THAT REQUIRED 

1198
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,057
SANCTIONS TO BE IMPOSED AND THE 

1199
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,493
SANCTION THAT ARE TO BE IMPOSED 

1200
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,461
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IMPOSED. 

1201
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:15,633
THE FACTS ARE THE 

1202
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,300
ADMINISTRATION SOUGHT A WAIVER. 

1203
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,303
I WANT TO POINT OUT AND WE HAVE 

1204
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:19,803
HAD THIS FROM PREVIOUS 

1205
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:22,139
ADMINISTRATIONS BUT NOT AT MUCH 

1206
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,374
AS WE ARE HEARING TODAY THAT 

1207
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,343
WHAT CONGRESS IS REQUIRING YOU 

1208
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,278
TO DO YOU FUND RELIGION AND ARE 

1209
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,046
TAKING CREDIT FOR IT. 

1210
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:29,847
IN REALITY YOU HAVEN'T PUT IN 

1211
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,115
ON TIME THE SUBSTANTIAL 

1212
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,316
SANCTION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED 

1213
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:32,649
BY CONGRESS. 

1214
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:34,251
>>  FOR OF ALL THAT'S NOT TRUE. 

1215
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,154
WE HAVE PASSED A NUMBER OF 

1216
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,090
SANCTIONS UNDER THE PROVISIONS 

1217
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,724
AND IT'S ALSO TRUE, MY BEST 

1218
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,258
RECOLLECTION OF THE 

1219
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:42,560
CONSTITUTION IS THAT THE 

1220
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,494
PRESIDENT SIGNED THAT LAW AS 

1221
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:43,761
WELL SO. 

1222
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,795
>> AND HE COMPLAINED WHEN HE D. 

1223
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,798
>>  I THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING 

1224
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:48,065
THAT LAW. 

1225
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:48,498
WE APPRECIATE IT. 

1226
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:51,769
WE THINK IT MAKES GOOD SENSE. 

1227
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,736
THE PRESIDENT SIGNED IT. 

1228
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:55,072
WE HAVE PASSED SANCTIONS UNDER 

1229
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,242
THAT VERY LAW. 

1230
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:58,875
WE HAVE PASSED SANCTIONS THAT. 

1231
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,678
YOU JUST -- PREVIOUS 

1232
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,647
ADMINISTRATIONS DIDN'T DO? 

1233
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,281
>>  PLEASE READ THE PRESIDENT'S 

1234
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:07,384
COMMENT AND HE SIGNED THE LAW. 

1235
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:09,420
IT'S VERY INTERESTING. 

1236
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,422
LET ME MOVE ONTO OR POLICY.  

1237
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,003
IN NORTH KOREA WE HAVE A 

1238
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,771
COUNTRY THAT HAS A NUCLEAR 

1239
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:28,171
WEAPON WEAPON. 

1240
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:30,508
THE PRESIDENT HAS MET WITH THE 

1241
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:31,942
LEADER OF THAT COUNTRY AND HAS 

1242
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:36,580
AT LEAST GIVERREN A SIGNAL TO 

1243
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,282
SOME COUNTRIES THAT IN FACT 

1244
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,383
THERE MAY BE RELAXATION. 

1245
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,485
WE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH 

1246
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,120
CHINA TODAY AS I UNDERSTAND. 

1247
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,791
IN IRAN WE HAD A COMMITMENT FOR 

1248
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,460
A SHORT TERM ENDING OF THEIR 

1249
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,227
NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 

1250
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,895
WE WERE ABLE TO ISOLATE IRAN, 

1251
00:38:51,895 --> 00:38:56,100
GETTING THE SUPPORT OF CHAIN A 

1252
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,568
RUSSIA AND EUROPE AND WE WERE 

1253
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,504
ABLE TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE 

1254
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:06,410
DOWN IN REGARD TO THE NUCLEAR 

1255
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:06,677
PROGRAM. 

1256
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,979
NOW BY PULLING OUT WE DON'T 

1257
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:09,980
HAVE ANY SHORT TERM COMMITMENTS 

1258
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,982
BECAUSE THEY AR ALREADY 

1259
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:12,983
SANCTIONED UNDER THE UNITED 

1260
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:13,216
STATES. 

1261
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:15,619
WE HAVE BEEN ISOLATED, NOT IRAN 

1262
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,021
AND OF COURSE IRAN TODAY WAS 

1263
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,322
NOT -- PURSUING A NUCLEAR 

1264
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:18,823
PROGRAM. 

1265
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:22,426
I AGREE WITH YOU THERE MAY 

1266
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:23,660
BELONG TERM ISSUES. 

1267
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,896
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME 

1268
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:30,334
UNDERSTANDING OUR STRATEGY IN 

1269
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,502
REGARDS TO PREVENTING NUCLEAR 

1270
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:31,935
WEAPONS LAST POINT. 

1271
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:33,370
WE HAD A HEARING IN THIS 

1272
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,738
COMMITTEE AS TO WHAT IS 

1273
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:36,006
NECESSARY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 

1274
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,476
NORTH KOREA ON GIVING UP 

1275
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:38,975
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

1276
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:40,744
THE FIRST THICK THEY TALKED 

1277
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:41,545
ABOUT. 

1278
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,783
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FULL 

1279
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,952
DECLARATION AND A TIMELINE OF 

1280
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:48,285
DISMANTLING. 

1281
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,587
I'M GETTING MY INFORMATION NOW 

1282
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,922
FROM THE SOUTH KOREA'S, NOT THE 

1283
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:52,323
AMERICANS. 

1284
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,124
SOUTH KOREA HAVE BEEN REPORTED 

1285
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,425
TO SAY YOU ASK FOR THAT 

1286
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,227
INFORMATION AND YOU HAVEN'T 

1287
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,729
BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT 

1288
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,398
INFORMATION FROM KIM OR HIS 

1289
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:01,798
REPRESENTATIVES. 

1290
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:02,265
WHAT HAVE WE GOTTEN? 

1291
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:03,667
IN NORTH KOREA AND WHY ARE WE 

1292
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,502
ALLOWING NORTH KOREA TO 

1293
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:08,806
CONTINUE TO HAVE A NUCLEAR 

1294
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:13,544
WEAPON WHEN THE STRATEGY IS 

1295
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:19,749
THAT AS LONG AS -- IRAN IS 

1296
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:22,319
DOING ANY TYPE 67ENRICHM. 

1297
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,522
>>  THAT WAS A LONG QUESTION. 

1298
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,956
LET ME TRY TO UNPACK IT. 

1299
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,959
LET ME GIVE YOU THE COMMON 

1300
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:29,193
THEME. 

1301
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,629
WE WANT NEITHER IRAN NOR NORTH 

1302
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,399
KOREA TO HAVE THE CAPACITY OF 

1303
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,166
CREATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ENRICH 

1304
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,735
URANIUM OR BUILD A WEAPONS 

1305
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,369
PROGRAM. 

1306
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,103
THAT'S THE MISSION. 

1307
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,869
IT DRAWS THEM TOGETHER. 

1308
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:42,106
THAT SETS CONDITIONS FOR THE 

1309
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:42,706
PRESIDENT'S UNDERSTANDING OF 

1310
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:43,907
HOW ONE ACHIEVES THIS IN THE 

1311
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:45,009
WORLD AND THAT'S THE MISSION 

1312
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,410
STATE WE ARE UNDERTAKING IN 

1313
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,712
EACH OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. 

1314
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,513
THEY ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES 

1315
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,282
AND WE ARE WORKING ON THE 

1316
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,819
APPROACH IN EACH PLACE WE THINK 

1317
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,186
INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD. 

1318
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:58,989
I KNOW A MISSION YOU SHARE. 

1319
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,824
>>  SECOND IN INTERJECTION. 

1320
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:03,761
I MENTIONED WAS MADE OF A 

1321
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,698
WAIVER IN THE NDA A BY 

1322
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,098
SECRETARY MATTIS. 

1323
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:12,069
HE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE DEMOTED 

1324
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,037
TO THAT LEVEL, I KNOW. 

1325
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,739
I SUPPORT THAT. 

1326
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,541
THE PURPOSE OF THAT WAIVER, WAS 

1327
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,444
TO ALLOW COUNTRIES THAT WERE 

1328
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,613
DEALING WITH THAT WE WISH TO 

1329
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:28,285
BUY AMERICAN MILITARY EQUIPMENT 

1330
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:32,289
TO BE WEANED OFF RUSSIAN 

1331
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,091
EQUIPMENT TO PUT IN STRATEGIES 

1332
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,260
WORKING WITH THEM TO PUSH BACK 

1333
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,261
AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES. 

1334
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:37,861
IS THAT CORRECT? 

1335
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:41,265
>>  YOU CAPTURE IT VERY WELL. 

1336
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,467
WE BOTH PUT FORWARD THIS 

1337
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:43,868
PROPOSAL. 

1338
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,536
A REQUEST FOR THE WAIVERS. 

1339
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,238
THESE ARE COUNTRIES WITH 

1340
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:47,771
HISTORIC RUSSIAN WEAPON 

1341
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:48,138
SYSTEMS. 

1342
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:51,976
IF WE DENY THEM THE CAPACITY TO 

1343
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,845
HAVE SPARE PARTS THEN WE LIKELY 

1344
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,615
TO DRIVE THEM TO THE HANDS OF 

1345
00:41:58,615 --> 00:41:58,949
THE RUSSIANS. 

1346
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,485
WITH REWORKING TO WORK IN THE 

1347
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,919
EFFECT OF THE STATUE. 

1348
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:03,420
IT'S PRETTY NARROW. 

1349
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,590
>>  CAN I REPLY TO THAT? 

1350
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,291
>>  GO HEAD. 

1351
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,493
>>  MY POINT IS THAT THIS IS AN 

1352
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,296
ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE 

1353
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,364
DEVELOPMENT OF THE BILL. 

1354
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,666
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DEBATE 

1355
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,735
IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THE WAIVER 

1356
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:21,171
REQUEST BY THE ADMINISTRATION. 

1357
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,039
I TAKE -- I DISAGREE WITH THE 

1358
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,041
CHAIRMAN AS TO IF IT WAS 

1359
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,442
HANDLED RIGHT THAT THE 

1360
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,345
COUNTRIES HAD OVER A YEAR TO 

1361
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:28,678
RESOLVE THAT. 

1362
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:32,082
>>  IT HAD BECOME AN ACUTE 

1363
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,550
ISSUE AND IT'S DEFENSE RELATED 

1364
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,485
ISSUE.  

1365
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:42,626
. 

1366
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:42,993
>>  THANK YOU. 

1367
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:49,166
JUST WATCHING TO SEE IF THEY 

1368
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:49,733
RESET MY CLOCK. 

1369
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,667
LIKE AN NBA GAME. 

1370
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:51,935
>>  RESET THE CLOCK. 

1371
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,971
>>  IT'S ALL RIGHT. 

1372
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:54,704
WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. 

1373
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:58,976
I WILL TELL YOU WHEN IT'S TIME 

1374
00:42:58,976 --> 00:42:59,209
IS UP. 

1375
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,545
ON THE -- WHEN PUTIN DECIDED TO 

1376
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,579
INTERFERE IN THE ELECTIONS YOU 

1377
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,981
WOULD AGREE HE UNDERTOOK A COST 

1378
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:04,381
BENEFIT ANALYSIS. 

1379
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,016
THIS IS WHAT THE PRICE WOULD BE 

1380
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:06,483
FOR THIS? 

1381
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,652
THIS IS THE BENEFIT I WOULD 

1382
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:08,985
GAIN FROM IT. 

1383
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:12,589
SO, WE WHERE IT LEAVES US IS WE 

1384
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:14,091
HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS. 

1385
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,026
WE HAVE TO DEFEND AGAINST 

1386
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:16,526
POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE. 

1387
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:17,661
I THINK THE OTHERS WE HAVE TO 

1388
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,898
MAKE SURE THE PRICE IS HIGHER 

1389
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,298
THAN THE BENEFIT. 

1390
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,367
THAT POINTS TO -- ONE OF THE 

1391
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,168
THINGS YOU MENTIONED AND THAT 

1392
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,002
IS WHEN WE HAVE DONE. 

1393
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,970
IF YOU START TO LINE UP SOME OF 

1394
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,039
THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE IN 

1395
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,575
RESPONSE TO THAT AND OTHER 

1396
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:36,080
THINGS IT'S AN  EXTENSIVE LIST, 

1397
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,980
INCLUDING THINGS WE HAVE ASKED 

1398
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,283
FOR YEARS SUPPORT OF THE NEW 

1399
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:44,421
POSTURE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN 

1400
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:44,722
EUROPE. 

1401
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:48,292
THE VARIETY OF ORDERS FROM THE 

1402
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:48,792
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. 

1403
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,596
SANCTIONSAND I KNOW THERE'S 

1404
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,031
MORE TO COME. 

1405
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,266
SEVERAL ROUNDS OF DESIGNATIONS. 

1406
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,033
TERROR AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIME. 

1407
00:43:57,033 --> 00:44:00,371
EXPORT RESTRICTIONS ON GROUP 

1408
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:01,504
THAT VIOLATED THE INF TREATY. 

1409
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:04,508
WE CLOSED CONSULATES IN SAN 

1410
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,375
FRANCISCO, SEATTLE, AN 

1411
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,377
ANNEX234DC, A TRADE OFFICE IN 

1412
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:09,446
NEW YORK AFTER THEY POISONED 

1413
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:16,286
NERVE GAS ATTACK IN THE UK. 

1414
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,521
WE EXPELLED 60 OTHER DIPLOMATS. 

1415
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,022
OBVIOUSLY EVEN THAT PRICE IS 

1416
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:20,124
NOT HIGH ENOUGH BECAUSE THE 

1417
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:20,624
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

1418
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:23,827
CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THEY ARE 

1419
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,331
POSTURED AND ARE ACTIVELY 

1420
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,132
ENGAGED IN BOTH ATTACKING OUR 

1421
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:37,540
DEMOCRACY AND MORE OF THAT IN 

1422
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,008
THE FUTURE. 

1423
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,011
THE QUESTION AND -- IT TAMES TO 

1424
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,611
DO THREE THINGS. 

1425
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:42,412
ONE DEFINE INTERFERENCE. 

1426
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:44,782
IT'S NOT JUST FIVE RUSSIAN GUYS 

1427
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:45,082
ON TWITTER. 

1428
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:48,085
IT'S DEFINE IT IN TERMS OF ITS 

1429
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:48,986
MEANING TO OUR REPUBLIC. 

1430
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,187
REQUIRE THAT THE DIRECTOR OF 

1431
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:50,921
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TO ISSUE 

1432
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,924
A REPORT WITH IN 0 DAYS OF THE 

1433
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,492
ELECTION ABOUT IF INTERFERENCE 

1434
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,395
HAPPENED AND PUT IN STATUTE A 

1435
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,630
MENU OF -- VERY CRIPPLING 

1436
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,931
SANCTIONS AND THE PURPOSE OF 

1437
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,633
THAT WOULD BE SO THAT PUTIN 

1438
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,600
KNOWS BEFORE HE MAKES THE 

1439
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,935
DECISION GOING TO 18 OR IN THE 

1440
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:05,168
FUTURE. 

1441
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:08,305
THIS IS THE PRICE I WILL PAY IF 

1442
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,406
I DO THIS AGAIN. 

1443
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,039
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A DEFER 

1444
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:15,579
ACT TO GET ON THE FRONT END OF 

1445
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:15,745
IT. 

1446
00:45:15,745 --> 00:45:18,515
ON THE CONCEPT OF BUILDING IN 

1447
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,583
DETERRANTS ON THE FRONT END IS 

1448
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,685
THAT NOT AN APPROACH WE CAN 

1449
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,887
TAKE TO HOPEFULLY DEFER HIM 

1450
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,256
FROM DOING THIS IN THE FUTURE 

1451
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:26,856
BY MAKING CLEARLY UNDERSTAND 

1452
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:33,130
HOW HIGH THE PRICE WOULD BE IN 

1453
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:33,863
COMPARISON TO THE BENEFIT? 

1454
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:38,635
>>  I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT 

1455
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:39,536
IS A COST COMPARISON. 

1456
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,203
PUTTING ON INFORMATION WITH A 

1457
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:43,006
FAIL SAFE IF YOU WILL ABOUT 

1458
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,008
THING THAT WILL FOLLOW HAS THE 

1459
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,543
LIKELIHOOD OF BEING SUCCESSFUL 

1460
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,478
IN RAISING THE COSTS IN TERMS 

1461
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:49,713
OF HOW HE WORKS OUT RISK 

1462
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,382
ASSOCIATED WITH -- A WIDE RANGE 

1463
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:52,715
OF ACTIONS. 

1464
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:55,185
>>  LET ME -- YOU WILL BE ASKED 

1465
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:55,886
PLENTY ABOUT RUSSIA. 

1466
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,987
I TONIGHT WANT TO UNDERMINE 

1467
00:45:57,987 --> 00:45:58,188
THAT. 

1468
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,423
I THINK THE SINGLE BIGGEST 

1469
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,223
NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT IN THE 

1470
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:02,593
LONG TERM TO THE UNITED STATES 

1471
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:02,860
IS CHINA. 

1472
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,560
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 

1473
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,965
END OF THE COLD WAR WE ARE IN 

1474
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,134
COMPETITION WITH A NEAR PEER 

1475
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:12,436
ADVERSARY AND IT'S MILITARY, 

1476
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,904
ECONOMIC, WE HAVE SEEN THEIR 

1477
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:14,705
IMPRESSIVE AND MASSIVE MILITARY 

1478
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,907
BUILD UP, THE LEAPS THEY ARE 

1479
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,474
MAKING IN TECHNOLOGY. 

1480
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,310
WE SEE THAT THE WORK THEY ARE 

1481
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,778
UNDERTAKING TO SORT OF DESTROY 

1482
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,813
THE UNITED STATES WORLD ORDER 

1483
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:26,316
AND REBUILD IT TO ONE MORE OF 

1484
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:26,649
THEIR LIKING. 

1485
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:31,989
WE HAVE SEEN THE GAINS THEY 

1486
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:32,755
HAVE DE. 

1487
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:35,259
CHINA MOBILE WILL BE THE ONLY 

1488
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,260
ONE TO BUILD 5G NETWORKS BY 

1489
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,861
2020 AND MANY OF THESE ARE NOT 

1490
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,230
THE RESULT OF HARD WORK BUT 

1491
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,934
THEY ARE THE RESULT OF PROPERTY 

1492
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,836
THEFT, FORCED TRANSFERS AND THE 

1493
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:46,136
LIKE. 

1494
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,771
THIS IS PART OF A TACTIC THEY 

1495
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:48,604
HAVE USED FOR A WHILE. 

1496
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:49,539
THE CHINESE AND THE SOUTH CHINA 

1497
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:51,375
SA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF IT. 

1498
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,977
THEY DON'T MAKE THESE BIG 

1499
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,211
SWEEPING CHANGES. 

1500
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:58,749
IT'S SORT OF A SUSTAINED, SORT 

1501
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,917
OF SLOW BUT MORE ASSERTIVE 

1502
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,854
DEMANDS, CREATING NEW NORMAL AS 

1503
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:04,454
LONG THE WAY. 

1504
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,989
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE 

1505
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,624
SOUTH CHINA SEA IS EVIDENCE OF 

1506
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:07,824
THAT. 

1507
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:08,925
THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMS TO 

1508
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:18,769
WORK IS COMMITTED AND   SUSTAIN

1509
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:19,035
ED WORK. 

1510
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:20,137
OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP, 

1511
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,238
SUSTAINED COMMITTED PRESSURE 

1512
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,540
AND THE OTHERS HELP OF OUR 

1513
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,241
FOREIGN PARTNERS. 

1514
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,642
WHAT I'M TROUBLED BY IN REGARDS 

1515
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:26,643
TO THE ADMINISTRATION POSTURE 

1516
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:31,315
ON THIS IS -- ON THE WORKING 

1517
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,417
WITH, GETTING THE HELP OF 

1518
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,117
FOREIGN PARTERS IS COMPLICATE 

1519
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,320
BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE TRADE 

1520
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,653
DISPUTE WAS THE EU AND JAPAN, 

1521
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:38,922
MEXICO AND CANADA WHICH WE 

1522
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,390
SHOULD HAVE TEAMED UP WITH TO 

1523
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:40,923
PROPER CONTINUITY THEM. 

1524
00:47:40,923 --> 00:47:42,292
I UNDERSTAND TRADE IS A PROBLEM 

1525
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,061
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT 

1526
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,696
MY -- I DON'T KNOW WHY WE 

1527
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,497
DIDN'T ADDRESS CHINA FIRST AND 

1528
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,067
THEN DEALT WITH THE ALLIES 

1529
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:50,667
SECOND. 

1530
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,703
THE OTHERS THE SUSTAINED AND 

1531
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,770
COMMITTED ESCALATING ACROSS THE 

1532
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,171
RELATIONSHIP. 

1533
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,538
ON THAT FRONT I'M PUZZLED BY 

1534
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:57,240
THE DECISION THE ADMINISTRATION 

1535
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,874
MADE ON ZTE. 

1536
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,643
I KNOW THAT WASN'T A STATE 

1537
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:00,076
DEPARTMENT ISSUE. 

1538
00:48:00,076 --> 00:48:01,845
IT WAS A COMMERCE ONE. 

1539
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,147
I AGREE THAT IF THE ZTE ISSUE 

1540
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,650
WAS A SANCTIONS VIOLATION THE 

1541
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,051
PENALTIES IMPOSED HAVE BEEN 

1542
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:08,384
DEVASTATING. 

1543
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:09,353
ZTE IS MORE THAN A SANCTION 

1544
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,621
THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES. 

1545
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:13,590
ITS PART OF A BROADER, 

1546
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,190
COMMUNICATION THREAT THAT THE 

1547
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,292
CHINESE INDUSTRIES POSE TO THE 

1548
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,593
UNITED STATES AND TO THREATEN 

1549
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,295
TO SHUT THEM DOWN AND THEN PULL 

1550
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,565
BACK FROM IT IS NOT THE SORT OF 

1551
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,800
COMMITTED AND SUSTAINED 

1552
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,401
ESCALATING ACROSS THE 

1553
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:24,968
RELATIONSHIP. 

1554
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,603
THE CARVING OUTS OF ONE 

1555
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,004
COMPANY, SENDS IN THE MESSAGE 

1556
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:30,574
THAT THEY CAN PICKAWAY AT 

1557
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,275
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THAT 

1558
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,342
RELATIONSHIP AND UNDERMINE OUR 

1559
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:33,543
WILLINGNESS TO SUSTAIN PRESSURE 

1560
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,445
ON THEM TO GET A GETTER DEAL. 

1561
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,980
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATE 

1562
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,749
DEPARTMENT'S ROLE WAS IN THAT 

1563
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,784
DECISION BUT MOVING FORWARD 

1564
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,487
WHEN IS OUR BROADER STRATEGIC 

1565
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:44,488
APPROACH TO THE THREAT THAT 

1566
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:47,290
CHINA POSES BECAUSE THEY SEEK 

1567
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:47,690
TO OVER TAKE US. 

1568
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,193
>>  YOU HAVE LAID OUT WHAT IS 

1569
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:53,463
THE PRINCIPAL CHALLENGE FOR THE 

1570
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,599
UNITED STATES OVER THE COMING 

1571
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:55,832
YEARS. 

1572
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:56,166
MAYBE DECADE. 

1573
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:56,633
THE ISSUE OF CHINA. 

1574
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:57,467
THEY ARE -- YOU TALK ABOUT THEY 

1575
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:01,671
HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS AND THE BIG 

1576
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:01,938
ECONOMY. 

1577
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,740
THAT PUTS THEM IN THE POSITION 

1578
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,542
TO COMPETE IN A WAY THAT A 

1579
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,577
COUNTRY LIKE RUSSIA WITH AN 

1580
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,479
ECONOMY SMALLER THAN ITALY 

1581
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,481
CAN'T MAINTAIN OVER SOME PERIOD 

1582
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:11,748
OF TIME. 

1583
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,782
SO WE DO NEED A BROAD RESPONSE 

1584
00:49:12,782 --> 00:49:14,551
AND I THINK ALL OF THE WEST, 

1585
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,486
NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES WAS 

1586
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,120
TO SLOW IN SEEING THIS. 

1587
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,123
YOUR POINT ABOUT HOW THEY 

1588
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,857
TURNED UP THE HEAT SLOWLY 

1589
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:22,726
OVERTIME. 

1590
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:23,927
THAT RECOGNITION IS THERE BUT I 

1591
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,595
DON'T THINK THE STRUCTURE IS IN 

1592
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,531
PLACE TO RESPOND TO THAT. 

1593
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,166
I WAS WITH OUR AUSTRALIAN 

1594
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,434
PARTNERS YESTERDAY AT A MEETING 

1595
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:34,704
WITH THE SECRETARY AND OUR 

1596
00:49:34,704 --> 00:49:35,805
STRAYING YAN COUNTERPARTS. 

1597
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:36,306
THEY JUST PASSES A 

1598
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:36,773
NONINTERFERENCE RULE. 

1599
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:37,674
THEY ARE GETTING UP TO SPEED IN 

1600
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,978
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU ALL TOOK 

1601
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,580
A LOOK WERE GETTING UP TO 

1602
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:43,813
SPEED. 

1603
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:49,553
WE ARE BEGINNING TO STRIKE THAT 

1604
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,121
THINK WILL DO WHAT HAS 

1605
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:51,388
HAPPENED. 

1606
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:51,955
ALLOW AMERICA TO PREVAIL. 

1607
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,424
>>  THANK YOU. 

1608
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,727
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1609
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:57,094
SENATOR SHEEN. 

1610
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,228
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1611
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:58,595
MR. SECRETARY. 

1612
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:03,033
I WANT TO THANK YOU, ASSISTANT 

1613
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:03,733
SECRETARY MITCHELL FOR YOUR 

1614
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:07,804
HARD WORK AND COORDINATION ON 

1615
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,305
THE EFFORTS TO RELEASE PASTOR 

1616
00:50:09,305 --> 00:50:09,572
BRUNSON. 

1617
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:12,009
HIS MOVE FROM PRISON TO HOUSE 

1618
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:12,809
ARREST IS A POSITIVE 

1619
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:13,210
DEVELOPMENT. 

1620
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,213
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO 

1621
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,914
DID IN TERMS OF GETTING HIM 

1622
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,617
BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. 

1623
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:21,284
ALSO PRESSING THE TURKISH 

1624
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,286
GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE THE OTHER 

1625
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,455
AMERICANS THEY ARE HOLDING. 

1626
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,657
IT'S A POSITIVE STEP. 

1627
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,327
THANK YOU FOR THAT. 

1628
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:35,265
I AM CONCERNED MR. SECRETARY 

1629
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,467
BECAUSE ITS BEEN A WEEK.  

1630
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:55,619
WE HAVE HEARD A NUMBER EVER 

1631
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,285
STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS 

1632
00:50:56,285 --> 00:50:58,855
INCLUDING THOSE WHO WERE 

1633
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,724
PRESENT IN THE MEETING ON IRAN. 

1634
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,260
INDICATE THAT THEY STILL DON'T 

1635
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:08,798
HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF 

1636
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,569
WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AND WE ARE 

1637
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,237
SEEING THE KREMLIM RELEASING 

1638
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,238
THEIR OWN READ OUTS AND 

1639
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,239
BROADCAST NEWS OF VARIOUS 

1640
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,341
AGREEMENT THAT THEY SAY WERE 

1641
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:19,208
REACHED IN THAT MEETING. 

1642
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,811
SO, FOR ME THAT IS WHY I'M SO 

1643
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:24,147
CONCERNED AND WHY I WANT TO 

1644
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:28,018
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS AGREED TO 

1645
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:28,784
IN THAT MEETING. 

1646
00:51:28,784 --> 00:51:30,220
ON SYRIA, THE PRESIDENT SAID 

1647
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,756
THAT -- AT HIS JOINT NEWS 

1648
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,692
CONFERENCE THAT THE TWO LEADERS 

1649
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:36,259
DISCUSSED SYRIA AT LENGTH. 

1650
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:36,960
THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF 

1651
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,262
DEFENSOR THAT INDICATED THAT 

1652
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,565
THE TWO LEADERS AGREED TO 

1653
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,166
MILITARY COOPERATION IN SYRIA. 

1654
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:43,566
DID THEY DO THAT? 

1655
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:47,337
>>  SENATOR, THE UNITED STATES 

1656
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,538
POLICY WITH RESPECT TO 

1657
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,705
DECONFLICTS WITH RUSSIA HAS NOT 

1658
00:51:49,705 --> 00:51:50,040
CHANGED. 

1659
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,908
I WILL DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT 

1660
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:52,942
OF DEFENSE FOR DETAILS AROUND 

1661
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:53,142
THAT. 

1662
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:55,645
THAT -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 

1663
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,447
POLICY THAT WAS IN PLACE WITH 

1664
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,049
RESPECT TO THEIR EFFORTS TO 

1665
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,550
KEEP AMERICAN PILOTS SAFE AND 

1666
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,918
KEEP AMERICAN FORCES SAFE IN 

1667
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:02,986
SYRIA, THAT POLICY HAS NOT 

1668
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:03,486
CHANGED. 

1669
00:52:03,486 --> 00:52:06,689
>>  DO YOU KNOW IF THEY 

1670
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:07,390
DISCUSSED THAT POLICY? 

1671
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:07,824
IF THEY DISCUSSED. 

1672
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:12,095
>>  I DO KNOW THEY DISCUSSED 

1673
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:12,328
SYRIA. 

1674
00:52:12,328 --> 00:52:12,862
THEY ABSOLUTELY DISCUSSED 

1675
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:13,563
SYRIA. 

1676
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,765
THE FOCUS OF THAT DISCUSSION, I 

1677
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,468
THINK THE PRESIDENT SAID WAS AN 

1678
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,836
EFFORT TO FIND A POLITICAL 

1679
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,638
RESOLUTION THERE AND TO GET THE 

1680
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,039
DISPLACED PERSONS THE 

1681
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,173
OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO SYRIA. 

1682
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:26,243
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT 

1683
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,444
TALKED ABOUT ONE MORE ITEM. 

1684
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:29,312
AS THE PRESIDENT SHARED I FEEL 

1685
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,449
LIKE I CAN AS WELL. 

1686
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,451
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT -- 

1687
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,418
AMERICA'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT 

1688
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,620
TO ENSURE THAT ISRAEL WAS 

1689
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,222
SECURE FROM THREATS IN SIR WHY 

1690
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:39,489
AS WELL. 

1691
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,790
THAT TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED BY 

1692
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,391
THEM AS WELL. 

1693
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:56,640
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS  

1694
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,141
>> THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN 

1695
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,276
U.S. POLICY WITH RESPECT TO OUR 

1696
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:00,277
ACTIVITIES IN SYRIA. 

1697
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:00,610
I UNDERSTAND. 

1698
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,578
THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION. 

1699
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:02,545
>> IT IS WHAT MATTERS. 

1700
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:09,019
IT IS WHAT MATTERS. 

1701
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,053
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT PRESIDENT 

1702
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,288
TRUMP HAS DIRECTED US TO DO THE 

1703
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,422
FOLLOWING THE MEETING WITH 

1704
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,058
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND WHAT HE TOLD 

1705
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:16,159
THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM TO 

1706
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,661
DO AND HOW HE WANTS US TO 

1707
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:18,728
DEPLOY HIS FOREIGN POLICY 

1708
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:18,995
STRATEGY. 

1709
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:24,901
>> DO YOU KNOW IF THE FROZEN 

1710
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:25,535
STABILIZATION FUNDS FOR SYRIA, 

1711
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,137
$200 MILLION, WAS THAT EVER 

1712
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:27,771
DISCUSSED? 

1713
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:31,574
>> THERE HAS BEEN -- WE ARE 

1714
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:32,676
STILL WORKING TO REVIEW THAT 

1715
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:33,009
POLICY. 

1716
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,010
THAT IS A STATE DEPARTMENT 

1717
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:34,411
POLICY. 

1718
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,145
WE ARE REVIEWING IT. 

1719
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,546
IT WAS THE SAME THE DAY BEFORE 

1720
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:43,787
AS IT WAS THE DAY AFTER THE 

1721
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:44,621
PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH 

1722
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:44,988
VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

1723
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,456
>> DO YOU KNOW IF IRAN WAS 

1724
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,257
REFERENCED IN THE CONTEXT OF 

1725
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,658
SYRIA IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS? 

1726
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,694
>> AGAIN, IT IS NOT FOR ME TO 

1727
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:51,528
DISCLOSE THE CONTENTS OF THOSE 

1728
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:51,895
CONVERSATIONS. 

1729
00:53:51,895 --> 00:54:04,474
I CAN TELL YOU THAT EACH TIME I 

1730
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,308
HAVE SPOKEN WITH PRESIDENT 

1731
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,576
TRUMP, BOTH BEFORE THE HELSINKI 

1732
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,811
SUMMIT AND AFTER, IRAN HAS BEEN 

1733
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,745
A CENTRAL POINT THAT WE HAVE 

1734
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,180
FOCUSED ON WITH RESPECT TO U.S. 

1735
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:10,747
POLICY IN SYRIA. 

1736
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,881
I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL 

1737
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:12,415
REMAIN SO. 

1738
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,449
>> SO IN AN INTERVIEW, THE 

1739
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:21,057
GENERAL WAS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 

1740
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:22,392
A DEAL HAD BEEN MADE IN SYRIA 

1741
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,193
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

1742
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,327
VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND HE SAID, AS 

1743
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,228
YOU INDICATED, THAT HE HAD 

1744
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,129
RECEIVED NO INSTRUCTIONS TO 

1745
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,364
CHANGE WHAT HE IS DOING.  

1746
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:33,169
HE WENT FURTHER ON TO SAY, AND 

1747
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,838
I QUOTE, I WOULD WANT TO MAKE 

1748
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:35,939
SURE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING 

1749
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:36,973
THAT WE STEPPED INTO LIGHTLY. 

1750
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,208
I AM NOT RECOMMENDING THAT, AND 

1751
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,542
THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY BIG STEP 

1752
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,043
AT THIS POINT. 

1753
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,144
IN RESPONSE TO HIS COMMENTS, 

1754
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,078
THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 

1755
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,279
PUT OUT A STATEMENT AND ALSO 

1756
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:54,290
POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND, 

1757
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,492
AGAIN, I AM QUOTING THE RUSSIAN 

1758
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:55,792
MEDIA. 

1759
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,726
THEY SAY MINISTRY, I MEAN. 

1760
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:57,827
WITH HIS STATEMENT, THE GENERAL 

1761
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:58,862
NOT ONLY DISCREDITED THE 

1762
00:54:58,862 --> 00:54:59,395
OFFICIAL POSITION OF HIS 

1763
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:00,796
SUPREME COMMANDER IN CHIEF BUT 

1764
00:55:00,796 --> 00:55:04,234
ALSO IS ESTIMATED THAT THE 

1765
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:04,934
ILLEGALITY UNDER INTERNATIONAL 

1766
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,269
LAW AND U.S. LAW OF THE 

1767
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:06,903
MILITARY PRESENCE OF AMERICAN 

1768
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:07,670
SERVICE AND IN SYRIA. 

1769
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,539
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT OUR 

1770
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,607
RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO THE 

1771
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:11,708
RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 

1772
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:19,249
WITH RESPECT TO THIS STATEMENT? 

1773
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,450
>> SENATOR, I GUESS THE 

1774
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,050
RESPONSE WOULD BE MOST 

1775
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:21,951
APPROPRIATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT 

1776
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,720
OF DEFENSE AND NOT FROM THE 

1777
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,791
DEPARTMENT OF STATE. 

1778
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:28,925
BUT I WILL HUMBLY SUGGEST TO 

1779
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,226
YOU THAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE MORE 

1780
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,261
CONFIDENCE IN THE GENERAL THAN 

1781
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,429
THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF 

1782
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:32,696
DEFENSE. 

1783
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:37,567
>> I DO HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN 

1784
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,601
THAT STATEMENT AND THAT IS WHY 

1785
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,569
I AM RAISING THIS QUESTION, 

1786
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,071
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR 

1787
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:41,805
RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN 

1788
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,106
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OUGHT TO BE 

1789
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,240
VERY STRONG TO SAY, THEY HAVE 

1790
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:53,583
NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT WHAT OUR 

1791
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,684
GENERALS ARE DOING IN SYRIA. 

1792
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,585
THAT IS NOT THEIR BUSINESS. 

1793
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,419
THAT IS OUR BUSINESS. 

1794
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,854
I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT IS A 

1795
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,988
POINT THAT WE MAKE VERY 

1796
00:55:58,988 --> 00:55:59,254
STRONGLY. 

1797
00:55:59,254 --> 00:56:00,356
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT 

1798
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,591
SYRIA A LITTLE OVER TWO WEEKS 

1799
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:01,791
AGO. 

1800
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,159
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE 

1801
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,627
WORK THAT OUR MILITARY HAS BEEN 

1802
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,996
DOING IN NORTHEAST SYRIA ALONG 

1803
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:07,964
THE TURKISH BORDER. 

1804
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:08,732
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE 

1805
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:13,569
WORK OF THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC 

1806
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:18,541
FORCES, AND WHAT I HAVE HEARD 

1807
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,876
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, BOTH FROM 

1808
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:20,977
THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WERE 

1809
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:21,845
STARVING AND FROM THE 

1810
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:22,812
CIVILIANS, SYRIAN CIVILIANS, ON 

1811
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:23,613
THE GROUND WAS, PLEASE DON'T 

1812
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,248
LEAVE US HERE TO THE FATE OF 

1813
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:30,653
EITHER A SIDE OR THE RUSSIANS 

1814
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,055
OR OTHER FORCES THAT MAY COME 

1815
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:32,789
INTO THAT PART OF CEREAL. 

1816
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,891
AND PLEASE, JUST A LITTLE BIT 

1817
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:39,696
AND HELP FOR RECONSTRUCTION 

1818
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,197
EFFORTS WOULD GO A VERY LONG 

1819
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:41,397
WAY. 

1820
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,399
THAT PART OF SYRIA HAS 

1821
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:42,699
STABILIZED. 

1822
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,333
THEY ARE INTO RECONSTRUCTION. 

1823
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,267
THEY ARE SENDING BACK PEOPLE 

1824
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:45,401
WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED TO 

1825
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:49,238
THEIR HOMES AND IT WOULD BE, I 

1826
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:54,177
BELIEVE, A REALLY TERRIBLE 

1827
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,212
REVERSAL OF POLICY FOR US TO 

1828
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,747
LEAVE THOSE FOLKS AFTER WHAT WE 

1829
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,549
HAVE DONE AND TO TURN THEM OVER 

1830
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:17,467
TO THE RUSSIANS OR TO THE 

1831
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:17,901
SYRIAN FORCES. 

1832
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,002
>>> SENATOR, IF I MIGHT, JUST 

1833
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,136
SO THE FACTS ARE CLEAR, THE 

1834
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:20,904
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IS THE 

1835
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,238
ONE THAT ENABLED RUSSIA TO HAVE 

1836
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,339
THE CAPACITY THAT THEY HAVE IN 

1837
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:23,740
SYRIA TODAY. 

1838
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,375
BUT I AM NOT DEFENDING AT THE 

1839
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,075
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, MR. 

1840
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,010
SECRETARY BUT I WANT THIS 

1841
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,744
ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE WHAT 

1842
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:28,211
IS WORKING. 

1843
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,712
THAT YOU ARE ADVOCATING FOR THE 

1844
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:30,179
CONTINUATION OF THIS 

1845
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:30,713
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY. 

1846
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:31,481
I THINK THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT 

1847
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,281
FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND. 

1848
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:33,483
>> SENATOR FLAKE. 

1849
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:37,987
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

1850
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:38,821
SECRETARY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. 

1851
00:57:38,821 --> 00:57:42,492
I WANT TO COMMEND THE STATE 

1852
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,826
DEPARTMENT FOR QUICK STATEMENTS 

1853
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:46,696
WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE OF 

1854
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,398
THE CONVERSATION AS IT WAS 

1855
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,801
BETWEEN PRESIDENT PUTIN AND 

1856
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:55,872
PRESIDENT TRUMP REGARDING 

1857
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,740
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS LIKE MR. 

1858
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,742
McCALL AND OTHERS TRAVELING TO 

1859
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,580
RUSSIA TO BE INTERROGATED BY 

1860
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:12,322
THE RUSSIANS. 

1861
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,256
THE STATE DEPARTMENT CAME OUT 

1862
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,190
AND SAID IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE 

1863
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:14,757
DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S 

1864
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:15,792
STATEMENT THAT SAID THAT THERE 

1865
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:16,793
WAS AN INCREDIBLE OFFER. 

1866
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:17,994
IT TOOK THE WHITE HOUSE EIGHT 

1867
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,028
-- A FULL THREE DAYS TO 

1868
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:23,600
CONTRADICT THAT STATEMENT THAT 

1869
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,534
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAD MADE, BUT 

1870
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:25,535
THE STATE DEPARTMENT QUICKLY 

1871
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,402
SAID THAT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. 

1872
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,172
SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. 

1873
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,473
>> SENATOR FLAKE, YOU GIVE ME A 

1874
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:31,908
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH CREDIT. 

1875
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,443
I AM DOING MY LEVEL BEST EVERY 

1876
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,280
DAY TO IMPLEMENT THE 

1877
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:37,914
PRESIDENT'S POLICIES AND THAT 

1878
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:49,792
STATEMENT WAS FROM THE UNITED 

1879
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,325
STATES PRESIDENT'S STATE 

1880
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:50,626
DEPARTMENT. 

1881
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:50,893
>> OKAY. 

1882
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:51,928
BY THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT 

1883
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,062
SAID THAT IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE 

1884
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,364
OFFER AND SO THAT IS WHY I 

1885
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,398
POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCE IN 

1886
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:55,999
COMMENDING YOU. 

1887
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:56,399
PLEASE TAKE IT. 

1888
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:57,634
WITH REGARD TO WHAT ELSE WAS 

1889
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:58,835
SAID DURING THAT MEETING, I 

1890
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,936
KNOW THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN SOME 

1891
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,070
INDICATION ABOUT WHAT WAS 

1892
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,472
DISCUSSED. 

1893
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,906
LET ME JUST GIVE A SENSE OF HOW 

1894
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:04,807
RUSSIA IS CHARACTERIZING THAT 

1895
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:05,107
MEETING. 

1896
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:08,544
THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE 

1897
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:09,178
PRIVATE MEETING LIKE THIS. 

1898
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,813
MANY OF US VOICE STRONG 

1899
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:13,349
CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING A PRIVATE 

1900
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,785
MEETING LIKE THIS WITH NO 

1901
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:23,026
READOUT. 

1902
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:23,326
OFFICIALLY. 

1903
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:23,826
FOR WHAT HAPPENED. 

1904
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:24,861
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A 

1905
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:25,662
PRIVATE MEETING LIKE THAT IS 

1906
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:26,362
HELPING VLADIMIR PUTIN'S 

1907
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,397
MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP WAS, 

1908
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,197
QUOTE, BETTER THAN SUPER. 

1909
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,666
RUSSIA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAS SET 

1910
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,367
THE LEADER SUMMIT IN HELSINKI 

1911
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,336
WAS FABULOUS. 

1912
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,804
THAT WAS LAB OR OFF WHO ALSO 

1913
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:42,478
SAID THAT. 

1914
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,312
THE REMARKS REPORTED BY THE 

1915
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:44,414
RUSSIAN NEWS AGENCY SUMMED UP 

1916
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,314
THE MOOD THAT DONALD TRUMP 

1917
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:46,649
SIDED WITH THE KREMLIN OVER HIS 

1918
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:47,550
OWN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, SO 

1919
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:54,290
THEY ARE REPORTING THAT AS WELL.

1920
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,625
HERE IS HOW ONE NEWSPAPER IN 

1921
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,325
RUSSIA CHARACTERIZED IT. 

1922
00:59:56,325 --> 00:59:57,360
DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED TO 

1923
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,061
DOMINATE VLADIMIR PUTIN ANOTHER 

1924
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:58,995
TABLOID SAID A QUIET, MODEST 

1925
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:02,198
DONALD TRUMP HAS PALED IN 

1926
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:03,232
COMPARISON WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

1927
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:04,233
IT IS CLEAR THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN 

1928
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,501
HAS OUTMANEUVERED THE U.S. 

1929
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,271
PRESIDENT. 

1930
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,071
THAT IS THE RUSSIAN MEDIA, 

1931
01:00:09,071 --> 01:00:09,739
úCHA 

1932
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:10,907
AND WE HAVE NO READOUT TO 

1933
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:11,741
DISPUTE ANY OF IT. 

1934
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,942
ALL WE HAVE ARE THE STATEMENTS 

1935
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:17,013
BY THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY HAVE 

1936
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,247
MADE AN INCREDIBLE OFFER, FOR 

1937
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:19,248
EXAMPLE, TO HAVE THE FORMER 

1938
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,249
U.S. DIPLOMATS SHIPPED OFF TO 

1939
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,284
RUSSIA TO BE INTERROGATED. 

1940
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:32,595
I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT, ONE, A 

1941
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:33,696
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME WILL BE 

1942
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,131
HAD BEFORE A NEW MEETING TAKES 

1943
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:35,732
PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO. 

1944
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:37,467
BY THE WAY, I THINK IT IS GOOD 

1945
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,568
THAT OUR PRESIDENT OF THE 

1946
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:39,402
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT SPEAK AND ME 

1947
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:39,702
TOGETHER. 

1948
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:40,670
THAT IS A GOOD THING. 

1949
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,205
I DO NOT THINK IT IS A GOOD 

1950
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,639
THING TO MEET IN PRIVATE WITH 

1951
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:44,841
ONLY AN INTERPRETER PRESENT 

1952
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:50,079
WITH ALL -- WITH NO READOUT SO 

1953
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:50,779
THAT WHATEVER IS CHARACTERIZED 

1954
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:51,748
IS ONLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE 

1955
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:52,782
RUSSIAN SIDE, SO ANY RESPONSE 

1956
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:53,616
OR THOUGHTS ON THAT? 

1957
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:54,884
>> SO I HAVE A PERSONAL 

1958
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:55,184
EXPERIENCE. 

1959
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,051
I HAD A PRIVATE CONVERSATION 

1960
01:00:56,051 --> 01:01:00,422
WITH NORTH KOREANS. WE DID NOT 

1961
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:01,557
ISSUE A READOUT ON THE 

1962
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:07,730
CONVERSATIONS. 

1963
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,197
QUITE INTENTIONALLY. 

1964
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:08,865
AND THE NORTH KOREAN PRESS 

1965
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,266
CHOSE TO CHARACTERIZE IT BUT WE 

1966
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,300
THOUGHT IT WAS IN AMERICA'S 

1967
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,402
BEST INTEREST NOT TO RESPOND TO 

1968
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,736
FOR TAT ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE 

1969
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:14,070
CONVERSATION. 

1970
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:14,804
WE KNEW THE TRUTH. 

1971
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,372
WE KNEW WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE 

1972
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:16,939
THERE. 

1973
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:23,846
AND IT IS THE NORTH KOREAN 

1974
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,548
PRESS AND SO I ASSUME THAT MOST 

1975
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:26,282
REASONABLE PEOPLE WILL DISCOUNT 

1976
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:26,882
IT FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY THE 

1977
01:01:26,882 --> 01:01:42,165
SAME THAT THE -- ONE MIGHT THE 

1978
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,132
RUSSIAN PRESS. 

1979
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:43,732
THESE ARE IMPORTANT DECISIONS 

1980
01:01:43,732 --> 01:01:44,500
ABOUT HOW MUCH TO DISCLOSE 

1981
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,201
ABOUT PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS THAT 

1982
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,235
WERE HAD BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS 

1983
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,236
THAT YOU MAY HAVE AN 

1984
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:48,404
EXPECTATION THAT YOU WILL HAVE 

1985
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,004
ANOTHER PRIVATE CONVERSATION 

1986
01:01:49,004 --> 01:01:50,239
ONE DAY AND THE ABSENCE OF 

1987
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,073
THEIR BELIEF THAT THAT PRIVATE 

1988
01:01:51,073 --> 01:01:51,874
CONVERSATION HAS THE CAPACITY 

1989
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,409
TO REMAIN IN THAT BASE REDUCES 

1990
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,210
THE FREEDOM TO HAVE THOSE 

1991
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:54,577
CONVERSATIONS. 

1992
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:55,845
I KNOW YOU HAVE HAD THIS IN 

1993
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:56,345
YOUR LIFE. 

1994
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,046
YOU HAVE HAD PRIVATE 

1995
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:57,780
CONVERSATIONS AND YOU VALUE 

1996
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:57,980
THEM. 

1997
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,382
IT WAS JUST YOU AND SOMETHING 

1998
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,616
ELSE IN THE ROOM AND WAS 

1999
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:01,617
IMPORTANT AND YOU DID NOT GIVE 

2000
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:02,318
ANYONE A READOUT. 

2001
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,553
YOU WANTED TO HAVE THE CHANCE 

2002
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,720
TO DO THAT AGAIN BECAUSE YOU 

2003
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,922
THOUGHT YOU COULD MAKE REAL 

2004
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:06,956
PROGRESS WITH THAT PERSON. 

2005
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:08,157
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT NORTH 

2006
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:08,390
KOREA. 

2007
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,158
YOU BROUGHT IT UP. 

2008
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,093
YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU TRAVELED 

2009
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:22,338
TO NORTH KOREA TO CONTINUE ON, 

2010
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:24,507
AS YOU PUT IT, TO FOLLOW UP ON 

2011
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,141
COMMITMENTS MADE IN SINGAPORE. 

2012
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:25,875
LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE 

2013
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:26,408
COMMITMENTS FOR A MINUTE. 

2014
01:02:26,408 --> 01:02:27,510
YOU MENTIONED THAT THEY HAVE 

2015
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,244
COMMITTED TO DENUCLEARIZATION. 

2016
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,145
THEY MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT 

2017
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,479
READOUT THAN WE DO ON WHAT THAT 

2018
01:02:30,479 --> 01:02:30,746
ENTAILS. 

2019
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:32,081
BUT SO FAR, THEY SEEM TO BE 

2020
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:32,915
WALKING BACK ANY COMMITMENT, 

2021
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,383
REAL COMMITMENT, THAT WAS MADE 

2022
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,051
THERE. 

2023
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:36,586
WHAT COMMITMENT, FIRM 

2024
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,587
COMMITMENT, OTHER THAN 

2025
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:38,821
DISCUSSION OF RETURNING 

2026
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:39,088
REMAINS? 

2027
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:47,363
I AM NOT DISCOUNTING THAT. 

2028
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,164
IN TERMS OF DENUCLEARIZATION, 

2029
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:48,898
WHAT REAL COMMITMENTS WERE 

2030
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:49,198
MADE? 

2031
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,600
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 

2032
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,533
THE PRIVATE COMMITMENTS THAT 

2033
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:51,933
HAVE BEEN SHARED. 

2034
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:53,469
I DO NOT THINK IT IS FAIR TO 

2035
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,971
CHARACTERIZE THEM WALKING BACK 

2036
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:55,371
FROM COMMITMENTS. 

2037
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:59,408
REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE. 

2038
01:02:59,408 --> 01:02:59,642
RIGHT? 

2039
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:01,010
IT ALL DEPENDS WHAT YOU DRAW AS 

2040
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,412
THE PROJECTED LINE TO SAY ARE 

2041
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:04,614
WE IN A BETTER PLACE OR A WORSE 

2042
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:23,733
PLACE THAN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN 

2043
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:24,533
ABSENT THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT? 

2044
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:25,601
ONE CAN DRAW A COUNTERFACTUAL 

2045
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:26,769
REFERENCE AND WE WILL NEVER 

2046
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:27,737
KNOW WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN. 

2047
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:29,171
I WILL CONCEDE THAT THERE IS AN 

2048
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:30,172
AWFUL LONG WAY TO GO. 

2049
01:03:30,172 --> 01:03:31,407
I'M NOT TRYING TO OVERSELL THE 

2050
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,208
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE HAVE 

2051
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,442
HAD TO THE PATH OF 

2052
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:33,842
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

2053
01:03:33,842 --> 01:03:34,777
THERE REMAINS A GREAT DEAL OF 

2054
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:35,344
WORK TO DO. 

2055
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,278
IT WILL BE HIGHLY CONTESTED. 

2056
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:37,313
THE MODALITIES, THE MEANS, THE 

2057
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,915
TIMING IS -- I AM CONFIDENT WE 

2058
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,049
WILL BE DISCUSSING FOR A PERIOD 

2059
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:40,349
OF TIME. 

2060
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,450
TERE HAVE BEEN PUBLIC REPORTS 

2061
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,785
AND I KNOW THE UNITED STATES IS 

2062
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:43,986
TRACKING THE DISASSEMBLY OF A 

2063
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:44,654
MISSILE ENGINE TEST SITE. 

2064
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,588
SOMETHING THAT CHAIRMAN KIM 

2065
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:45,988
COMMITTED ORALLY. 

2066
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,089
IT WAS NOT IN THE WRITTEN 

2067
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:47,990
AGREEMENT ITSELF, BUT THE 

2068
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:48,925
CHAIRMAN COMMITTED IN HIS 

2069
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:49,525
CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT 

2070
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:49,926
TRUMP TO DO. 

2071
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,460
THEY ARE BEGINNING TO DISMANTLE 

2072
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,361
THAT. 

2073
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:53,462
THAT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR 

2074
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:53,996
MISSILE PROGRAM. 

2075
01:03:53,996 --> 01:04:05,608
IT IS A GOOD THING. 

2076
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,241
STEPS FORWARD. 

2077
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:06,642
>> THANK YOU. 

2078
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:07,843
QUICKLY BEFORE THE TIME IS 

2079
01:04:07,843 --> 01:04:08,477
OUTCOMES SOMETHING COMPLETELY 

2080
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:08,777
DIFFERENT. 

2081
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:09,411
THE COUNTRY RWANDA RIGHT NOW, 

2082
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:10,913
AND YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH 

2083
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:11,847
THIS BECAUSE OF THIS WEEK'S 

2084
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:12,848
FOCUS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AS 

2085
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:13,649
INDICATED A MOVE TOWARDS SEVERE 

2086
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:14,283
RESTRICTIONS ON RELIGIOUS 

2087
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,284
FREEDOM, PARTICULARLY FROM OUT 

2088
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:15,617
WIDE GROUPS. 

2089
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:17,119
WHAT ARE THE PLANS OF THE STATE 

2090
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,054
DEPARTMENT TO LET THEM KNOW 

2091
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:31,667
THAT IT IS NOT IN THEIR OWN 

2092
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:32,468
INTEREST NOR OURS? 

2093
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:33,302
SENATOR, I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS. 

2094
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,870
I WILL NEED TO GET BACK TO IN 

2095
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,405
TERMS OF WHAT ACTIONS -- I KNOW 

2096
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:37,540
THAT WE WILL CALL IT OUT. 

2097
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,174
I KNOW THAT WE WILL LABEL IT 

2098
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:39,809
FOR WHAT IT IS. 

2099
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:44,447
WE DO NEED TO SEE -- IT IS 

2100
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:44,680
TRAGIC. 

2101
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,147
ANYWAY. 

2102
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:45,748
I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS. 

2103
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:47,183
IT IS A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US. 

2104
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:47,884
>> THANK YOU. 

2105
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:48,251
SENATOR CAN'T. 

2106
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,652
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIR AND MR. 

2107
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:49,952
SECRETARY. 

2108
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:50,953
A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS. 

2109
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:51,887
I WAS VERY DISCOURAGED AT THE 

2110
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:53,322
HELSINKI SUMMIT WHEN THE 

2111
01:04:53,322 --> 01:05:08,204
PRESIDENT BASICALLY WAS OFFERED 

2112
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,405
A CHOICE IN SOME OF THE 

2113
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,139
QUESTIONS THAT HE BELIEVED U.S. 

2114
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,374
INTEL OR DID HE BELIEVE THAT 

2115
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:12,008
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S PROTESTATIONS 

2116
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,209
THAT HE HAD ENGAGED IN HACKING 

2117
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,210
OF THE ELECTION AND HE 

2118
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,211
BASICALLY SAID MY OWN PEOPLE 

2119
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,746
HAVE MADE A GREAT CASE TO ME. 

2120
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:34,964
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS MADE A GREAT 

2121
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,799
CASE TO ME AND I DO NOT SEE WHY 

2122
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,600
RUSSIA WOULD HAVE DONE THIS. 

2123
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,901
HE CAME BACK AND CORRECTED IT 

2124
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:40,036
THE NEXT DAY IN THE UNITED 

2125
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,670
STATES BUT AT THE END HE SAID I 

2126
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:42,738
BELIEVE MY INTEL COMMUNITY BUT 

2127
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:44,173
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT 

2128
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:45,274
THERE AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN 

2129
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:45,808
SOMEONE ELSE. 

2130
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,209
THIS DRAGGED ON FOR A COUPLE OF 

2131
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:47,510
DAYS. 

2132
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,344
YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE. 

2133
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:49,945
YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF 

2134
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:50,780
CONSTITUENTS THAT USED TO BE 

2135
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,781
EMPLOYEES AT THE CIA. 

2136
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,815
PEOPLE COME UP TO ME VIRGINIA 

2137
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,417
AND SAY THAT I AM WITH THE IC 

2138
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,451
AND THEY ARE VERY DEMORALIZED 

2139
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,052
BY THIS. 

2140
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,053
THEY HAD TO MORALIZE THEM WHEN 

2141
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:57,987
STANDING NEXT TO VLADIMIR 

2142
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:58,721
PUTIN, THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS 

2143
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,122
WERE TO SUGGEST THAT HE TRUSTED 

2144
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:00,956
VLADIMIR PUTIN OVER THEM. 

2145
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:01,957
THERE WAS THE SUGGESTION WHEN 

2146
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:02,792
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT IT 

2147
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,093
WAS AN INCREDIBLE OFFICE -- 

2148
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:04,894
OFFER, THAT HE WAS ALSO 

2149
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:05,661
POTENTIALLY WILLING TO THROW 

2150
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:06,862
NOT JUST THE INTEL FOLKS UNDER 

2151
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:07,964
THE BUS BUT THE STATE 

2152
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:08,764
DEPARTMENT DIPLOMATS UNDER THE 

2153
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:09,899
BUS THAT LIVE IN VIRGINIA, TOO. 

2154
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:10,799
THEY FEEL THE DEMORALIZATION 

2155
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:11,734
ABOUT YOUR COMMONS TODAY THAT 

2156
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,602
WE ARE GOING TO GO TO BAT FOR A 

2157
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:14,070
CURRENT REFORMER. 

2158
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:14,937
THAT IS VERY, VERY HELPFUL. 

2159
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:16,572
WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS 

2160
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,073
OUR MILITARY. 

2161
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:17,606
OUR MILITARY LEADERSHIP. 

2162
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:18,607
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE YESTERDAY 

2163
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:20,242
IN THE WASHINGTON POST. 

2164
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:24,179
GENERAL JOSEPH F DUNFORD,

2167
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,550
BEEN BRIEFED ON HELSINKI EVEN 

2168
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,418
THOUGH IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS MORE 

2169
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:33,189
THAN 1 MILLION TREAT -- TROOPS 

2170
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:33,856
OVERSEAS BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY 

2171
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:35,324
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO 

2172
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,327
BRIEFING OF GENERAL DUNFORD 

2173
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,361
ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK

CHAIRMAN DUNFORD. 

2178
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,107
>>> YOU DO NOT DISPUTE -- YOU 

2179
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,108
HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE 

2180
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:53,342
WAS A BRIEFING OF GENERAL 

2181
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:53,943
DUNFORD TODAY ABOUT THE 

2182
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:54,910
HELSINKI DISCUSSION? 

2183
01:06:54,910 --> 01:07:00,449
DO YOU? 

2184
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,650
YOU READ ME A PIECE FROM THE 

2185
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,050
WASHINGTON POST. 

2186
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,285
>>> I AM ASKING YOUR KNOWLEDGE. 

2187
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,553
DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT 

2188
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,554
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SHARED 

2189
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:06,255
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT U.S. RUSSIA 

2190
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:09,125
MILITARY ISSUES WITH THE JOINT

01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:10,626
I HAVE SPOKEN WITH CHAIRMAN 

2193
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:11,560

2194
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,260
I WAS WITH HIM YESTERDAY. 

2195
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,696
WE HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE A 

2196
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:14,696
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. 

2197
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:16,298
YES. 

2198
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:16,932
ABOUT OUR PLANS. 

2199
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:17,232
ABSOLUTELY. 

2200
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:18,134

2201
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,468
FIRST TIME HE WAS BRIEFED ABOUT 

2202
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:19,768
IT. 

2203
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:20,569
>> THAT IS POSSIBLE. 

2204
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:21,670
TONIGHT I WAS GOING TO ASK 

2205
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,671
ABOUT THE GENERAL. 

2206
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:23,205
THE INFORMATION THAT THE 

2207

2210
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:33,349
RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY. 

2211
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,050
THIS IS AN INTERESTING 

2212
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:34,450
STATEMENT. 

2213
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:41,490
THEY WENT AFTER GENERAL HOTEL, 

2214
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,725

WITH HIS STATEMENTS THE GENERAL 

2218
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:49,465
NOT ONLY DISCREDITED THE 

2219
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:59,641
OFFICIAL POSITION OF HIS 

2220
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:00,275
SUPREME COMMANDER IN CHIEF -- 

2221
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:01,644
ARE YOU AWARE OF WHAT THE 

2222
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:02,578
OFFICIAL POSITION IS THAT IS 

2223
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,212
BEING REFERENCED IN THAT 

2224
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:03,512
STATEMENT?. 

2225
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,613
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK WITH 

2226
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:05,648
THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 

2227
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:06,248
TO NOW. 

2228
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,283
>> YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WE 

2229
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:08,584
ARE CONCERNED IF IT IS BEING 

2230
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:09,485
REPORTED IN RUSSIAN PRESS AS 

2231
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:10,719
THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE 

2232
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:11,454
TALKING ABOUT OFFICIAL 

2233
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,288
POSITIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

2234
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:12,621
HAS OUTLINED. 

2235
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:14,823
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW, THE 

2236
01:08:14,823 --> 01:08:15,824
STATEMENTS DID NOT VIOLATE ANY 

2237
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:17,026
OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE UNITED 

2238
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:17,259
STATES. 

2239
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,527
>>> YOU SEEM TO BE GIVING A 

2240
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:19,694
GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT TO THE 

2241
01:08:19,694 --> 01:08:22,331
RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. 

2242
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:23,566
>> I MIGHT NOT SHARE THAT SAME. 

2243
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,466
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT JOSEPH 

2244
01:08:25,466 --> 01:08:33,542
HOTEL. 

2245
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,010
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF 

2246
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,212
THE STATEMENTS THAT HE MADE 

2247
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:36,946
INCLUDING THOSE THAT WE READ 

2248
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,947
VIOLATE ANY POSITION OF UNITED 

2249
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:38,413
STATES? 

2250
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:40,180
>> IF YOU WOULD, IT IS BEST TO 

2251
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:44,453
APPROACH THE GENERAL AND THE 

2252
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,187
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. 

2253
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:45,888
WE ARE THREE ORDERS REMOVED. 

2254
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,122
>>> IF I COULD INTRODUCE, THERE 

2255
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:48,290
IS AN INTERESTING ARTICLE IN

THE DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT

PLEDGE TO HALT MILITARY 

2265
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:08,143

STATE DEPARTMENT. 

2273
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:15,716
THE PENTAGON CAUGHT BY SURPRISE

PUSHES FOR IRAQ IS TO GET 

2275
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:17,452
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION.

IF I COULD INTRODUCE FOR THE

01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:40,809
RECORD. 

2283
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:41,777
I WORRY ABOUT AN ADMINISTRATION 

2284
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:42,944
THAT WOULD TAKE UP VLADIMIR 

2285
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:43,746
PUTIN POSITION OVER THE INTEL 

2286
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,380
COMMUNITY AND THE 

2287
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,180
ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD 

2288
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,282
SUGGEST THAT IT MIGHT BE A 

2289
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,316
GREAT DEAL TO CONSIDER HANDING 

2290
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:48,417
OVER A FORMER DIPLOMAT FOR 

2291
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:48,750
QUESTIONING. 

2292
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,318
I WORRY ABOUT THE 

2293
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:50,051
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS CATCHING 

2294
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:50,853
THE PENTAGON OFFGUARD. 

2295
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,020
THAT IS NOT CONSULTING WITH

JENNA FOR -- GENERAL DUNFORD OR 

2297
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:54,156
BRIEFING HIM A WEEK AFTER A 

2298
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,190
SUMMIT OF THIS IMPORTANCE TO 

2299
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:55,557
OUR MILITARY. 

2300
01:09:55,557 --> 01:09:56,792
MR. SECRETARY, YOU ARE AWARE OF 

2301
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,193
THE BAN, THE CURRENT BAN  ON 

2302
01:09:58,193 --> 01:10:11,173
RUSSIAN AND MILITARY -- AND 

2303
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:11,840
U.S. JOINT MILITARY OPERATIONS. 

2304
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,508
ARE YOU NOT? 

2305
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,009
>> I AM AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE 

2306
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:14,543
OF THAT PROVISION. 

2307
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:14,843
YES. 

2308
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:15,911
>> THE PROVISION BANS ANY USE 

2309
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:16,445
OF FUNDS. 

2310
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,379
IT IS IN THE NDA. 

2311
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,581
ANY USE OF FUNDS TO SUPPORT 

2312
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:19,515
JOINT RUSSIA AND U.S. MILITARY 

2313
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:19,915
OPERATIONS.  

2314
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:20,916
IT GIVES THE SECRETARY OF 

2315
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:21,750
DEFENSE THE ABILITY TO 

2316
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,551
UNDERTAKE A NATIONAL SECURITY 

2317
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,986
WAIVER IF HE THINKS THAT IT IS 

2318
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:24,620
THE RIGHT IDEA. 

2319
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,420
DOES THE ADMINISTRATION ACCEPT 

2320
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,555
THE LEGALITY AND BINDING NATURE 

2321
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,923
OF THAT PROVISION OF LAW? 

2322
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:35,998
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THE 

2323
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,299
DOD GENERAL COUNSEL IS THE 

2324
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,300
RIGHT PERSON TO ASK ABOUT THE 

2325
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,034
INTRICACIES OF THE PROVISION 

2326
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,735
THAT HAD TO DO WITH COMPLEX 

2327
01:10:40,735 --> 01:10:45,708
ISSUES THAT SPAN THE GAP 

2328
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,009
BETWEEN, I THINK OF WHAT YOU'RE 

2329
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:47,843
GETTING BETWEEN THE COMPLETION 

2330
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:48,344
AND COORDINATION. 

2331
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:59,555
IT IS A COMPLEX UNDERTAKING. 

2332
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:00,789
NOT A WAIVER THAT THE STATE 

2333
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:01,590
DEPARTMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY. 

2334
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,191
BROADLY, YES, THIS 

2335
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,025
ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWS THE LAW 

2336
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,226
OF THAT IS THE QUESTION. 

2337
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:05,494
>>> YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF A 

2338
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:06,362
LEGAL CONCERN THAT THE 

2339
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:07,062
ADMINISTRATION HAS ABOUT THIS 

2340
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:08,163
NDA PROVISION, ARE YOU? 

2341
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:08,697
I AM NOT. 

2342
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:09,698
>> YOU ARE NOT AWARE -- 

2343
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:11,433
>> WE WANT TO BREAK OUT OF THIS 

2344
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:11,733
