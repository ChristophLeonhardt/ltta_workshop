Here we are, in a very unusual
space, with six main windows
into neighboring cells.
If you look straight up
or straight down, everything
looks about normal.
The cells above and below us
are just like the ones we're in.
Let's move downward and 
follow this infinite column of cells
as we watch more cells
come into view.
In this direction, space behaves
the way we're used to in
everyday life â€” it's euclidean.
But what about the cells
around you to the side?
You'll notice something
different going on.
The four cells directly around you look
pretty similar to the
one you're in, but as you look
towards the horizon, they appear
to become taller and narrower.
Let's go towards the horizon and 
see what shape these cells actually are.
You could think of this as the
cells themselves warping
and changing shape as we move.
But the way I think of it,
and the way this model was
programmed, has all cells as
being the same, unchanging shape
to begin with, and it's space itself
that is warped.
Along the horizontal plane,
this space is hyperbolic.
It's curved in such a way that
there's more room to fit more
cells, and that's why they
appear squished from afar.
Now let's see what space looks like
when it's curved hyperbolically 
in all directions equally.
As we move towards the horizon,
every cell is still the same,
but rather than there being
just more room horizontally
for more cells, making them appear
thinner, there's more room vertically
as well, making them appear smaller 
in height than they really are.
In the euclidean space we're used to, 
only four cubes can fit around one edge
or four square cornered rooms.
But here in hyperbolic space,
we can fit six cube-shaped rooms
around a single column.
Let's go back to the space that's 
hyperbolic in just two directions
and euclidean in the third.
The horizontal beams
connect four cells as we'd 
expect from euclidean space.
The vertical beams, on the other
hand, connect six cells.
Let's start in this olive green cell 
and move around one of the columns.
First, we move straight into
a neighboring teal cell.
At the center, we'll turn left 
90 degrees and go straight into
the sky blue cell.
From the center of this one,
we'll make another 90 degree left turn 
to move into the light peach cell.
From there, 90 degrees brings us
not to the original olive green cell,
but this coral orange cell.
Another 90 degree left, and
we're heading into the deep red cell.
And finally, our last turn,
will bring us back to the 
olive green cell we started in.
The path we took around
that column was a regular
hexagon with six right angles.
And that's the kind of thing that
can happen when your 
space is curved.
