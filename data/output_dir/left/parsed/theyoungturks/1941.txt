>>MARIAH CAREY HAS OPENED UP
ABOUT A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION
THAT SHE HAD BEEN SILENT ABOUT
SINCE 2001.
BACK IN 2001 SHE WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER,
AND SHE CLAIMED SHE WAS IN
COMPLETE DENIAL ABOUT IT AND
DIDN'T SEEK HELP, HOWEVER
RECENTLY SHE DID SEEK HELP AND
IS IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE, AND I
COMMEND HER FOR OPENING UP ABOUT
THIS BECAUSE IT HELPS TO DO AWAY
WITH THE STIGMA RELATED TO
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND
HOPEFULLY IT LIBERATES OTHER
PEOPLE WHO ARE COPING WITH THE
SAME THING.
SHE SAYS --
>>
>>ACCORDING TO PEOPLE --
>>
>>SO I READ INTO THE CONDITION
A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THERE ARE
ALL SORTS OF STEREOTYPES ABOUT
BIPOLAR DISORDER IN THE MEDIA
AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT
IS.
THERE ARE THESE BOUTS OF
SEVERE DEPRESSION AND THEN WHEN
IT COMES TO THAT HYPOMANIA WHAT
HAPPENS IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS
CONDITION CAN'T SLEEP, THEIR
MIND IS WIRED, THEY ALWAYS FEEL
GUILTY BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE
THEY AREN'T DOING ENOUGH FOR
THEIR CAREERS, IN FACT SHE
TOUCHES ON THAT A LITTLE BIT --
>>
>>SHE'S GOT TWO KIDS, AND IT'S
HARD ON THE PEOPLE AROUND PEOPLE
WITH BIPOLAR IF THEY AREN'T
TREATED, SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO
RECOGNIZE IT, AND IT'S GREAT,
BUT IT WILL BE A CONSTANT
STRUGGLE.
MEDICATION, THERAPY,
IT'S NOT EASY, SO I AGREE WITH
YOU TOTALLY, THAT TALKING ABOUT
IT, REACHING OUT, BEING HONEST
ABOUT IT, AGAIN, REMOVING THE
STIGMA.
IT IS FIXABLE BUT YOU
HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUS ACTION, AS
SHE SAID IT'S A PROCESS AND
AN ARDUOUS ONE, SO GOD BLESS HER
FOR TALKING ABOUT IT.
