a deadline for terror groups to pull out of a buffer zone around Sirius last rebel-held stronghold as past with jihadist fighters staying put for more details now we're joined in the studio by you gorged on of ego with this deadline now gone what are the chances in it of these jihadis moving well actually this is the biggest intrigue about this whole deal because today is the second deadline and today was the day when all rebel factions who are in the northern province of Idlib today they were supposed to make the biggest concessions of all they were supposed to withdraw troops from the 20-kilometer also buffer zone in the province now one thing to understand about Eid Lib it is a mess in a sense that there there are so many groups that are controlling various pockets of the province and it is indeed one hell of a task to control and to see through their withdrawal of their compliance with the deal what's not making things easier is because for example the anatra front the most formidable force in the Syrian province hours before the deadline here's what they had to say we have not abandoned our choice of jihad and fighting towards implementing our blessed revolution pounds the deal publicly like a couple of other groups more radical groups have done but like when you look at their statement it does indeed look that they are ready to continue the fighting and that they are willing to keep on fighting the Assad army and so it doesn't really look like compliance with a deal now this deadline was only one of the things wasn't it agreed on by Turkey and Russia what were the other key points well the another key point was - for rebels for all the factions in Eid Lib to withdraw heavy arms from the buffer zone they were this was like a first step of self and it was supposed to happen on the 10th so 5 days ago and largely from what we've seen so far we haven't seen too many reports of violations of that so largely even despite some even despite groups denouncing the deal so far so good it seems that they're complying but one thing is to withdraw heavy weapons and another thing is to withdraw your own fighters essentially moving frontlines closer to what they see as their home as their last stronghold and for Turkey it is de facto a guarantor of the guarantor of the rebels complying with the deal it is again a very difficult task because not only there is a lot of groups to control to see them complying with the deal but also sometimes groups say one thing and then do another and but so far Russia has been saying that while turkey is doing its best to see the deal succeed the load on this - upon your source the agreements are being fulfilled with our Turkish partners having the main role they're actively fighting to get all groups to co-operators so ultimately today and the next following days will be key to understanding if the deal is on the way to being successful or whether the groups of all those various factions in ed Lib whether they will continue fighting okay you go thanks to the update you got was you down off there you
