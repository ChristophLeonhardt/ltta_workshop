robert muller apparently has a new mandate are you gonna love this the new york times is reporting robert muller is now looking at crumbs tweets yeah Trump's tweets let me read you something here I got it on the screen in front of me but Muller is apparently according to New York Times and other outlets reviewing Donald Trump's tweets I want to read you an excerpt here from the New York Times just have to find that on my Twitter timeline but here's what they wrote you can quote mr. Muller will stitch together several episodes and counters and pieces of evidence like the tweets to build a case that the president embarked on a broad effort to interfere with the investigation think about that I'm Robert Muller I've got nothing got nothing I've wasted almost 22 to 25 million in taxpayer dollars I've interviewed hundreds of people I've strong-armed others I've destroyed lives I've taken down careers all to get Donald Trump impeached cuz he wasn't supposed to win I got nothing but I'm gonna piece together tweets and emails and phone calls and come up with a case for obstruction of justice of an investigation that was investigating no underlying crime because now we know the FISA warrant was predicated upon the junk dossier which kicked off the whole investigation Muller never should have been appointed this has become the biggest joke in American history the biggest joke in American history but now he's looking at tweets and the claims are incredible that by Trump saying things like homies a bad FBI director that's obstruction of justice by saying things like I should have picked a different attorney general than Jeff Sessions and he was going to recuse himself mm-hmm we're treating Jeff session should have told me he was going to recuse himself that's obstruction of justice apparently now having an opinion as president of the United States is obstruction of justice it is about the dumbest thing I've ever heard now you could say I'm a partisan I am but I've got prosecutors FBI agents retired and current but I speak to who are saying okay this is now gone past anything we can defend this is now Muller's probe way past and we some of these people hate Trump they're like even we as ethical professionals can no longer defend what we see here there's clearly something else at work here because this eat about justice and it is long past time for Donald Trump he now has the political cover after the FISA warrant and this ridiculous nonsense about looking at tweets Donald Trump needs to thoroughly clean house at the top of the DOJ Rosenstein needs to go sessions needs to go Muller needs to go most importantly America needs to get back to business we're gonna have GDP numbers released today they could approach if not exceed 5% we're doing to this country but we're allowing robert muller to do to this country is a tragedy and it needs to end today i want to bring you these segments every day and i'm bringing you the these segments live every morning 7:30 a.m. on the rebel youtube channel i'm a new show declassified alive check it out as always thank you so much for watching have a great weekend
