so one last we left our epic story our epic story last week it looked like the Democrats were going to run this government shutdown into the ground their goal here was to make sure that Trump was in the middle of a government shutdown on the first anniversary of his inauguration they're outside gold may have been to make this thing last beyond the inauguration should be on the the State of the Union address so the Trump would actually have to speak about the State of the Union in the middle of a government shutdown that looks like that's about to end and when I say about tenth I mean like right now as we are recording this show it looks like they're about to take a vote that will end the government shutdown which lasted all in all three days two and a half days and that comes to an end as Mitch McConnell the Senate Majority Leader offers the Democrats virtually nothing he says we will have a short-term CR a continuing resolution that funds the government through February 8th that takes us past the State of the Union address and he says before we get there we will have a vote on T ah so we'll try another three weeks to come up with a vote on Jacka if not then I guess we'll have another government shutdown on February 8th when Democrats tried to attach deck legislation to the government did to the government budget to the continuing resolution remember that's how this whole thing went down in the first place we needed to fund the government the Democrats said we're not going to fund the government unless you give us daca unless you give us Obama's executive amnesty and shrine and law Republicans said we're not gonna do that unless you give us some concessions Democrats said no and then we went into this government shutdown that started Friday night and is over by Monday morning so it really is not even worth the worth the time here here was Chuck Schumer last week blaming Trump for it suggesting that it was all Trump's fault this government shutdown I love the the shutdown clock on CNN yeah I came back online Saturday night and but when I left for Sabbath the government had not yet shut down I came back on Saturday night and lo and behold everything was the same like literally all of the things were the same and no one's check had not gone out it's the you have to wait till the first of the month from people's checks to not go out people were still going to receive their Social Security the government was still gonna collect all of its revenue you know the government was gonna continue to function a 90% of the government continues to function during a government shutdown 88 to 90 percent of the government continues to function as essential services during government shutdown and yet we were supposed to believe look at that counter on CNN that this was the end of the world right oh my god we're counting down to Armageddon the asteroid is finally gonna hit her here was Chuck Schumer blaming Trump for it although Trump really had little to do with it the Senate Minority Leader who thought that he was going to get a when out of this now it's possible Schumer can still get a win out of this if Mitch McConnell then makes a bad daffodil
