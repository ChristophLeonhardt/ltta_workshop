is the blame<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they're</font>

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
specifically talking about the video

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,140
professor who is an advertiser in some

60
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,030
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> games what happens is you get</font>

addicted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a zing a game</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to</font>

62
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,270
advanced more quickly in the game you

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,070
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy some virtual goods like say</font>

64
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,300
you're playing mafia wars and you want

65
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,550
to buy a<font color="#CCCCCC"> handy a fancy submachine gun</font>

66
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,260
well you need to usually need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> insert</font>

67
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,060
money into the game you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

68
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,620
them your credit card or your cell phone

<font color="#E5E5E5">number to pay for more virtual</font>

70
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,350
currencies you buy that submachine gun

71
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,600
but to go and do that you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

72
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,959
page and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says wait before you buy</font>

73
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Netflix would like to buy this gun for</font>

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,830
you or<font color="#E5E5E5"> this currency for you but you</font>

76
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,650
that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice business model</font>

77
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Netflix gets a new customer the customer</font>

78
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,780
gets to play the game longer zinc it

79
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,070
gets a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from netflix</font>

80
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,530
problem is is that sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

81
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,540
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these offers don't come from</font>

82
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,070
nice companies like Netflix that come

83
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,780
from companies like video professor

84
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,650
which will say hey try how to learn to

85
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,990
buy and sell on ebay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll send it</font>

86
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,940
to you free and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't like it you</font>

87
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,300
know whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's over but the problem</font>

88
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">is is they actually do charge you they</font>

89
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,959
ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your credit card ten bucks</font>

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,080
and they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge you 10 bucks for</font>

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,060
shipping<font color="#E5E5E5"> and handling and then if you</font>

92
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,680
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it right back like within a</font>

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,880
very short<font color="#CCCCCC"> limit amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of time they</font>

94
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,470
charge you<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 dollars for the whole set</font>

95
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,420
why do we keep following this falling

96
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,970
for this because they put in huge

97
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,250
letters all it causes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shipping</font>

98
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,540
handling it's a really scummy business

99
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,030
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we fall for it because they're very</font>

100
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,170
clever about it and they're making<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

101
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,120
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money and they're good at tricking</font>

102
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,900
people how come gsi commerce paid so

103
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,720
much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> rue la la says intellect get</font>

104
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,980
one the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this one is that well</font>

105
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,600
excuse me GS i paid about 350 million

106
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,250
dollars and an hour and our guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

107
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,739
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think about that does seem high</font>

108
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,360
when you compare it to like what you pay

109
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,420
for overstock com but the truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is</font>

110
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,489
that well first off rue la la came with

111
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,370
more than just ruelala.com also<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart</font>

112
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">bargains count calm came bundled in with</font>

113
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,510
it but the other the difference is

114
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,608
between overstock.com<font color="#CCCCCC"> and rue la la and</font>

115
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:21,899
stuff like that is that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

116
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,120
actually some high margin specialty

117
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,270
items sold on ruelala there may

118
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,039
specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of private</font>

119
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,050
shopping experience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

120
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other variable is that</font>

121
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,650
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of exclusivity when it</font>

122
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,930
comes to these private shopping

123
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,940
destinations<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's also a gilt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> groupe</font>

124
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,710
which is a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> business and I think</font>

125
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,419
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are willing to pay a little bit</font>

126
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">more when they think they're buying</font>

127
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,370
something that no one else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

128
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,169
so the next question is from Sammy the

129
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,330
walrus the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourth who asks has there</font>

130
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">been any internal debate as to what si</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

131
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,280
should focus on quantity or quality of

132
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,379
stories there has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> internal debate</font>

133
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,060
and we'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we decide</font>

134
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,460
our next question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Sammy the</font>

135
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,139
walrus again this guy has a lot of

136
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,720
questions and he says Yrsa I writers

137
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,610
generally mocked and argued with by

138
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,270
commenters more than any other tech blog

139
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,650
the easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer would be to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

140
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,479
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter our comments like a lot of</font>

141
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,759
tech blogs some some sites make you try

142
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,130
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they have people who carefully</font>

143
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,590
monitor those things but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth is is</font>

144
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,469
we like we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind people taking</font>

145
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:27,199
issue with what we're saying or<font color="#E5E5E5"> are us</font>

146
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,789
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get interesting</font>

00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:31,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation going and sometimes we like</font>

148
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,120
to provoke you guys so then<font color="#CCCCCC"> scott kidder</font>

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,030
asks us up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I see actually asked me</font>

150
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,219
when are you shaving off the moustache
