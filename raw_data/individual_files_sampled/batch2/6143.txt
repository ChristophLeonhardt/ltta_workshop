Judge Napolitano has been making a lot of sense lately which is strange now the latest example of him making a lot of sense is when he was talking about Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh and he is saying something that I've actually heard a lot of other Republicans say conservatives say and so I just found that all fascinating and I wanted to share it with you take a look the Washington establishment sometimes known as the swamp right want it wanted judge Kavanaugh and the people around the president wanted judge Kavanagh led by Don Magan the White House legal counsel longtime friend of judge Cavanaugh and and they prevailed but are you suggesting yes I'm saying that this is I am disappointed in the president because this is not the type of person that he said he would pick justice Gorsuch was this person is at the heart and soul of the DC establishment against whom the president real okay so man I got to give me a pallet I know a lot of credit so what what I'm looking for in this country is an honest debate we don't have to agree all the time we as long as you're not doing talking points and you're not just reflexively on one person side or one party side but you actually care about your ideology whether you're right wing left wing somewhere in the middle of cetera that's a democracy that we're supposed to have that of what I can't stand is the talking points on television and of course the politician is just representing their donors so I've got a million disagreements with Napolitano and some of his opinions are kooky but he has been really principled through the Trump administration and he was on several shortlist for Supreme Court now that's crazy but he's just the guy on TV but you know Trump's nuts and so I forgot that he was a potential Trump nominee right do you think maybe he's salty no no no quite the opposite I give him more credit because knowing that he could have been on that he was on summer let's at least according to Trump he continued to from time to time criticize Donald Trump it's not the first time doing he's doing it it's now been at least a half a dozen times so he's being honest and whether you agree or disagree I super appreciate the honesty yeah I do too and I agree with you I think the biggest issue in terms of polarized politics in America is that you don't have honest actors anymore we have people who I mean especially when it comes to someone like Trump there are people on the right who have been raging against things that Trump is doing for decades right and then Trump comes into office does exactly what they criticize other presidents of doing and then they immediately change their tune and Napolitano hasn't yeah and then you see so many others who think they might be able to get a good job like oh she's the greatest here's Napolitano who could have an unbelievable job that you know would be nuts that it that if he was you know nominated but he you know there's some percentage chance and no he's not pulling his punches unlike the other betas in the Republican Party who are like oh I failed to go for take my bananas Napolitano is standing on principle look I will not forget that that is that's that's fantastic and and by the way he's right about Cavanaugh's background now you might love the Republican Party but that guy is deeply enmeshed in Karl Rove George W Bush Jeb Bush and standard establishment Republican politics serving the donors and doing whatever they want look I'll tell you even a quick example here one of the cases that Cavanaugh ruled on was a case involving SeaWorld a killer whale had killed one of the trainers and and they were seeking you know workman's comp if you you can't get workman's comp from getting eaten by a killer whale or Kenny it for so now it would have been okay in my opinion for a conservative judge to go yeah but it doesn't qualify because of X Y or Z but kavanah didn't rule that he ruled no OSHA doesn't even have the right to regulate SeaWorld so the killer whales can go kill people all they like that work at SeaWorld and OSHA which which his job is to protect workers is not allowed to protect the workers now why does he do that because he is a swamp monster he has gotten everything he got from corporate donors so that's him raising his hand saying just like or such yeah so I disagree with the Paul taught Oh on that one saying I will let corporations do anything to their workers what was the Gorsuch ruling again there was a there was a truck driver who was freezing to death his company ordered him to stay and freeze to death he he didn't he went to safety and they fired him every other just judge that looked at it and said yeah you don't have to freeze to death if your company orders it Gorsuch says yes you do they had every right to fire you because you didn't listen to the orders you should just stood there by the way it's not an exaggeration he was freezing to death he'd already gotten frostbite he started loose feeling in his limbs so he was on the precipice and Gorsuch says I don't care if a corporation tells you to freeze to death you'll freeze to death Cavanaugh says I don't care every killer whale ate you if if a corporation says that was your job you shut up and you do your job and the government is not allowed to protect you so that's to Cavanaugh's they're amazing lastly to end on a fun note if you go back and watch the beginning of that video I love hexxus reaction he's the most pro Trump guy he's the guy I was talking about the beta who's a good job right and he thought he might get a couple of positions in the administration too so in the beginning he's like Napolitano yes right and then as the paul tono explains the Kavanagh is a swamp you see hexxit good Paulito no Trump criticisms is that you know the fox and friends especially whatever he's on they start off you know like jovial everything's great and then they do change their demeanor as Napolitano toxic yes in this case the other two hosts were fine but look at the exit on the video not happy two easy ways for the young turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a
