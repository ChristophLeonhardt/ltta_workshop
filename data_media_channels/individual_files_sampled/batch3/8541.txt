RELATION TO JESSE. GUYS? STEVE: THANK YOU, BRIAN. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS POLITICAL ATTACKS HAVE GOTTEN VERY LOW THE LATEST TACTIC FROM THE LEFT RELEASE OF PRIVATE INFORMATION LIKE PHONE NUMBER, ADDRESS RELEASED ON THE WEB. THAT IS KNOWN AS DOXXING. AINSLEY: THIS WAS DONE TO SEVERAL SENATORS AND CORY GARDNER'S WIFE EVEN RECEIVED A VIDEO ON CELL PHONE CONTAINING GRAPHIC FOOTAGE OF A MAN BEING BEHEADED. HOW FAR WILL THESE POLITICAL ATTACKS GO? JOINING US NOW IS THE HOLSEY OF FOX NATION TOMI LAHREN. SHE HAS SEEN THESE ATTACKS FIRST HAND AND THEY ARE UGLY, AREN'T THEY, TOMI? THEY ARE UGLY AND GETTING WORSE. I HAVE TO SAY FOR THE RECORD I HAVE BEEN DOCKED. I HAVE HAD THINGS SENT TO MY HOME BOTH IN TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA. I HAVE HAD PEOPLE CONFRONT ME IN PUBLIC. THIS IS NOT JUST SOMETHING SENATORS GOING THROUGH IT'S ANYONE WHO SITS RIGHT OF CENTER, ANYONE WHO IS A TRUMP SUPPORTER. WE ARE ALL TARGETS OF THIS AND EXTENDS BEYOND THIS WHOLE PUBLIC OFFICE. THE AVERAGE CITIZEN, IF YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT SHOULD BE CONCERNED AND IN DANGER. AINSLEY: IT'S INCITING VIOLENCE. WHAT IF IT GETS OUT OF HAND? SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE DANGERS. I HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE. I AM WORRIED ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE ON CAMPUSES. IT'S UNREST. NOT JUST PROTESTING AND SIGNS. IT'S BECOMING PHYSICAL AS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN PORTLAND. GETTING WORSE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. FOR AVERAGE CITIZENS AND MY FEAR IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE AS WE GET CLOSER TO MIDTERMS AS REPUBLICANS KEEP WINNING. WE HAVE GREAT VICTORIES. AS MUCH AS WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT OUR VICTORIES. THE LEFT IS MORE UPSET THAN EVER ABOUT THEIR LOSSES AND TAKE IT OUT ON US EVERY CHANCE THEY GET. STEVE: THERE WAS ANOTHER CLASH IN PORTLAND. ANTIFA WERE PROTEST AGO POLICE SHOOTING THERE. AND ONCE AGAIN, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE WONDERING WHY AREN'T THE POLICE SHUTTING THESE THINGS DOWN? WHEN VIOLENCE ENSUES. WELL, OF COURSE. AND BEYOND THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ANTIFA, I HAVE SAID THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE, WHEN I LOOK AT THESE MEMBERS OF ANTIFA, I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WOULD STAND UP AND SAY THESE ARE NOT TRULY DEMOCRATS. I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY ARE TRULY DEMOCRATS. WHAT I REALLY THINK OF ANTIFA IS THESE ARE ADULT CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN THEIR MOTHER'S BASEMENT WHO ARE UPSET AND ANGRY AND WANTS AN EXCUSE TO GO OUT IN THE STREETS AND WREAK HAVOC ON THE CITIZENS. YOU ARE SEEING IT HAPPEN NOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND SPECIFICALLY IN PORTLAND TERRIFYING WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO AVERAGE CITIZENS ON THE STREET. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS. JUST AVERAGE CITIZENS AND BEING ATTACKED IN THEIR OWN TOWNS. IT'S ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS. STEVE: ONE OF THOSE CARS THAT WE SAW SOMEBODY DID $8,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO IT THEY DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT. I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE THEY DON'T KNOW WHO DID T AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS CHAOS. NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE SEEING IN OUR STREETS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS IS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY UNHINGED. SO AS I SAID BEFORE, I HOPE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PARTY AND LEFT COMES OUT AND SAYS THESE MEMBERS OF ANTIFA DON'T REPRESENT US. BUFF I HAVE YET TO SEE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FOLKS LIKE MAXINE WATERS WHO CALLED FOR THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR MAYBE IN A LESSER CONTEXT BUT CERTAINLY CALLED FOR THINGS LIKE THIS AND HARASSMENT. I HOPE THEY CAN COME OUT AND RECOGNIZE THE KIND OF INFLUENCE THEY ARE HAVING ON PEOPLE. THIS IS GETTING BEYOND POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. THIS IS ACTUALLY DANGEROUS. AINSLEY: WHEN I SAW THAT VIDEO, I REMEMBER YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT A RESTAURANT. THEY THREW ICE ON YOU. THEY THREW A DRINK ON YOU. SEE THAT VIDEO OF THAT GUY IN FRONT OF HIS CAR. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET HURT. WHEN IS THIS GOING TO END OR IS IT GOING TO GET WORSE? START WITH PEOPLE BANGING ON CARS OR THROWING WATER AS THEY DID ON ME AND GET PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. WE SAW OF COURSE IN EUROPE THE ACID THROWING. THAT'S MY BIGGEST FEAR THAT WILL BECOME THE NEW WEAPON AND MORE DANGEROUS. IT STARTS AS FUN AND GAMES IN THEIR MINDS IT STARTS AS A JOKE AND SOME MEAN GIRLS THROWING SOME THINGS. I THINK IT'S GOING TO TURN MUCH MORE UGLY ESPECIALLY AS WE HEAD INTO MIDTERMS. AS EXCITED AS WE ARE ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION. I THINK CONSERVATIVES AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S GETTING NASTIER THAN EVER. AINSLEY: IS IT WORTH IT FOR YOU. DO YOU THINK ABOUT STOPPING. ABSOLUTELY NOT. BECAUSE IF WE DO THEY WIN. WE HAVE DEEP OUR VOICES STRONG AND VILLAGE LENGTH. TAKE THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS THE WORSE THINGS WE COULD DO WOULD BE TO STOP AND BE INTIMIDATED BY PEOPLE LIKE THAT. STEVE: PEACEFUL PRO-ACCESSES, FINE, IT'S WHEN IT CROSSES THE LINE THAT'S WHEN IT SCARES ALL OF US.
