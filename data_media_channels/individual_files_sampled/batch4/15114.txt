the crybabies won't shut up about a so-called people's vote and you know what fine let's do it hear me out on this one okay so before you think that I've suddenly become a remainer and that I want to give the people an opportunity to change their mind and reverse brexit and suddenly I don't respect the outcome of the vote let me assure you that's not the case just out the gate here but hear me out on this one because I think it's interesting so I've said before that the idea of the people's vote is a scam right so it's an it's a pretty simple scam but one that seems to be working so the people that have the power to influence brexit tell the people that Briggs is a bad idea and it won't work and then they use their influence within Parliament to make the process so convoluted so difficult so problematic that then they can then go back to those same people who they said it won't work to and say look we tried it's not working maybe we should just have a people's vote and change our minds it's at course a scam and today I was scrolling through Twitter as normal and I keep seeing more and more posts about this so-called people's vote as if we didn't have a vote in 2016 already and it got me thinking you know seeing these people with these big signs outside of Parliament and screaming and shouting at the top of their lungs you know what fine let's do a people's vote but let's do it properly okay so see the people's vote they say is about ensuring maximum democracy right they think it's more democratic to have another vote and make sure people are certain about it so that's what the left's claiming this is really is about democracy well then you know if this was about democracy then they'd be doing it in a way that represents the outcome of the first referendum wouldn't they if this was about democracy the people's vote would allow people to decide on the the kind of brags that that we have and not whether or not we have brags it at all because we already made that decision if this was really just about ensuring that we have a say on the final deal then that referendum that people's vote that they're calling for would not include an option to remain in the European Union because we've already made that decision this is meant to be a referendum on the deal for leaving the European Union is it not so maybe maybe we should just do what the left is technically asking for if they're so concerned about democracy and if they're so concerned about having a final say on brexit maybe we should give it to them and here's how I propose this work there should be 2 options on this people's vote one option should be to leave the European Union on the deal agreed upon by the government and the European Union the checkers deal and what options should be to leave the European Union with no deal and to begin trading on World Trade Organization rules that's fair isn't it if they're left have been honest with us all along if they really are concerned about democracy and whether or not we have a say on the final deal then this option this referendum offering them the chance to take the checkers deal or leave on a No Deal basis this should keep them satisfied surely so come on mrs. may let's do it that's other people's vote a real people's vote if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
