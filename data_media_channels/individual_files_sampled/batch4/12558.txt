anonymous sources close to the Trump administration have been telling major media outlets that they are close to the Trump administration but wish to remain anonymous the sources tell journalists that sources in the FBI are telling journalists that they are in the know about investigations of the Trump administration that anonymous sources close to the administration are telling journalists they are in the know about one knowledgeable source familiar with other knowledgeable sources told reporters close to sources in the know about the Trump administration that reporters had sources within the FBI closed two investigations into sources in the know about the Trump administration the source asked not to be named for fear his mother might find out he had used her phone to make a long-distance call whereupon she might force him to get a job again sources familiar with sources in the Oval Office say the office sources are anonymous but in the know about conflicts within the Trump administration the sources say that sources close to Steve Bannon tell sources close to Reince Priebus that Priebus is now on the outs with Bennett who in turn is on the outs with Trump according to anonymous sources close to Trump who wishes to remain anonymous but can't because he's President of the United States sources with tries to Capitol Hill met with reporters who wish to remain anonymous in the same parking garage where sources in the Nixon administration told reporters that trump's firing of James Comey was the same as Nixon's firing of Archibald Cox according to sources close to Comey who wished to remain anonymous the sources in the parking garage then parked the reporter's cars and received a $2 tip from reporters who wish to remain anonymous according to anonymous sources Washington Post reporters now say intelligence sources close to the Washington Post tell anonymous sources that Trump revealed intelligence sources to the Russians according to Russian sources close to the Washington Post sources close to their sources and intelligence the story from the anonymous sources comes hard on the heels of the story from anonymous sources saying Trump fired sources close to Comey for reporting the Comey sources were investigating ties between sources close to the Trump administration and the Russian sources who wish to remain anonymous the anonymous sources in the FBI confirm that the sources within the intelligence community are viable but wish to remain anonymous since the intelligence sources are anonymous and why should they get to be anonymous if the FBI sources can't be anonymous it's just not fair The Washington Post confirms however that their sources are reliable according to sources within the Washington Post who wish to remain anonymous the result of all these stories is an immense constitutional crisis that is sure to end with Trump's impeachment and the appointment of Hillary Clinton to the presidency according to sources within the imaginations of journalists who wish to remain anonymous because their imaginary this is mainstream media news trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show

seventy nine dollars and free shipping an incredible deal for a suitable fits you better than anything off the rack ever could let me tell you what's happening to me let's talk about me for a minute or this is a personal experience that I'm having over the weekend I wrote a piece was kind of based on one of the shows I did it was called the president roll on the planet hysteria and it was the most read piece as several of my pieces I'm proud to announce was in most great piece I wrote it for PJ Media but it was on Real Clear Politics and it was the most read piece of Real Clear Politics that day and all weekend long I got attacked by the Trumper okay and the Trump is writing me sending in comments and all this stuff you're you're a RINO you're not a real trump supporter you're dishing our president and all this stuff and it was about you knows all the stuff I say on the show that yes president Trump has many flaws and he does all these things that are wrong but the press has gone it has become hysterical and they are just attacking him in ways that don't really make sense in terms of for instance the way they covered oh let's just say Barack Obama you know so it's kind of it is the way they cover george w bush but it's amped up to shrill yesterday i did a show basically talking about some of this and some of the things that i see the press doing and then people started attacking me for being a trump you know apologist that everything Trump does I make an excuse for so I'm getting here from both sides okay now that that can either be a good sign or a bad sign and if it means you're an idiot and everybody can see you're an idiot or it means you're actually telling the truth and you're offending everybody and I want to at least try to explain why I am saying the things that I'm saying because it's not about Donald Trump to me see I think people have Trump blindness I think Trump is a big eccentric interesting character and I'm all in favor of talking about that but that's not what's going on that is not the street let's put it this way everybody has to pick what the story is everybody oh the real stories this or the real story is that and I do not think right this minute that the real story is Donald Trump Donald Trump is a flawed guy I've been saying this forever there are things about him that I really hate I had I had a about a 5% fear when I voted for Donald Trump and I voted for him because I thought Hillary a hundred percent fear of what Hillary was at a five percent fear that Donald Trump was Hitler it's about the coy Republican presidents are always Hitler I thought this guy I'm pretty sure 90 bucks I'm sure that's not true bad a little bit of a doubt in there okay so right so I voted for him you know kind of squinting my eyes and kind of reaching out to the vote in the voting booth and you know taking the hit of this 5% fear that 5% fear is now largely gone I do not think even think he's much of an authoritarian I mean I think he's acting well within the guidelines of the American Constitution I don't think he's usurped anybody's power I don't think he's stepped on anybody nobody is getting arrested for making a video in the dead of night as they did during the Trump during the Obama administration no reporter has reported getting bugged as they did during the Obama administration you know so I see him acting within certain parameters that that that are really important to me the parameters of the Constitution those are really important to me so my fear about them has kind of receded now do I agree with everything he does by no means do I agree with everything he does he's far to the left of me he has very very Democrat big government instincts that make me crazy I don't like it all that but still acting within those parameters plus when I when I voted for him I said that my best guess was that he was going to be a kind of mediocre middle-of-the-road president he's been better than that because he's done some things to the right that I really like like the rolling back regulations and of course the appointment of the judges gore search and the other judges he's put on so why do I keep not attacking him why am I not picking on everything he does and saying well this was wrong and that was wrong and this was wrong it's because I feel that the press and the state being the permanent state I don't know what to call this if phrase deep state sounds like too much of a thriller novel but the permanent state will call it the bureaucracy and the press our team to overthrow the results of an American election people elected this guy rich people you have that map we have the map of the election which people voted for him those people all those people between Manhattan and LA like all of them I'd like top one by seven million I think people in the heartland of America all those people voted for him and the press has gone insane and the state the bureaucracy has gone insane do you remember what what Trump said during his inaugural remember his dark inaugural dress weather just that one quick cut of Trump during the inaugural number eight today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people power doesn't like when you do that okay it does not like it now if Trump were Hitler if I thought Trump was really a bad guy who was going to subvert our country and subvert our Constitution then it would all be about him but since it's not and I can I could sit here and say oh I agree with this Magritte and disagree with that and this he did wrong and as he did right and I like this you know the good Trump bad from thing which I think is fine I think that's fine but Trump to me is a manifestation of what they call a critic or a cry from the heart of the American people they sense something was going terribly terribly wrong in with the direction we were going and it was Trump who enunciated now did he announce it did he enunciated out of cynicism was he just picking up on it and repeating it back to them that's that's a good question we can talk about that another time but he was that cry from the American people and it's that cry it's that cry that our media which is a Democrat hack machine and the bureaucracy are fighting against and trying to overturn and that's why I keep talking about that it's not it's not to apologize for trop it hasn't nothing to do with Donald Trump for me it has to do with the manifestation of that cry the people and I'll talk about that a little bit more but let me just talk about yesterday's latest great big scandal or like every day is a great big scandal I'm sorry but for me the president firing Comey may have been badly handled but that's not a scandal - when the president fires a guy who works at his pleasure that is not a scandal I'm sorry if I thought it was going to overturn an investigation yes scandal it will it no absolutely not there's absolutely no way that firing James Comey I mean if up now appoints Ivanka like I said to the FBI then then that's a scandal but if he appoints what we suspect he will some typical you know law enforcement guy or something like that it's going to be fine all the investigations that have turned up nothing for the last 10 months will still go on the professor will still be able to blow them out of proportion so yesterday remember that Trump was got it seemed to me like a troll he was sort of trolling the press by meeting with the Russian ambassador and the Russian Foreign Minister yesterday the Washington Post breaks a story that obviously it's a it's a complicated story but the basic idea that was during this meeting where Tillerson was there and McMaster were there was there the Trump said something about information we had from which the Russians could have deduced that we had a partner in the Middle East who had given us this information of a partner in the Middle East obviously didn't want to be revealed we don't so with no idea whether this is true or not we do know that it's virtually impossible for Trump to reveal classified information because Trump's the president he can say it's not classified anytime he wants right but the idea is he might have shared some information from which they could deduce a source in the Middle East well huh you know how do they knows I mean first let's go back we getting these denials from McMaster one of the only two important people who was there these are the National Security Adviser so here is let's get him today yesterday he made a quick speech but let's look at that number 12 today where he was facing I think this is Karen Tumulty from the Washington Post who broke the story sure I thought try to see into some detail that this report those conversations of the Russian are you denying that you revealed information that was in the US by a intelligence partner so what we don't do is discuss what is and what it wasn't classified what I will tell you is in the context of that that that discussion what the president discussed with the Foreign Minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the President and and any leaders with whom he's engaged and received from an intelligence partner I'm not going to be the one to confirm to confirm that that sort of information that could that could jeopardize it could jeopardize our security that you have these types of intelligence sharing relationships with the US will stop providing that information no I'm not concerned at all that that conversation was wholly appropriate to the conversation and I think it wholly appropriate what the expectations are of our intelligence partnership okay so at the same time we're going to stay on Facebook and YouTube so you can hear Christian Toto talking about the movies from Hollywood in toto but let's finish this first I mean so very is McMaster saying this didn't happen basically it was all totally appropriate Trump tweets as president I wanted to share with Russia at an openly scheduled White House meeting which I have the absolute right to do facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety humanitarian reasons plus I wanted Russia to greatly step up their fight against Isis and terrorism worst case scenario it sounds to me like he told them something that maybe you know maybe they can deduce something I'm not I don't know these are anonymous sources who weren't in the meeting anonymous sources who weren't in the meeting calling up the people in the meeting saying nothing bad happened but it's hard to parse you know there's no way to deny something so you can't say the guy is parsing parsing that they used to do this to people all the time however here's my question if it's true that somebody in the administration after this meeting came out somebody in the meeting said we better call up the CIA and make sure they know about this so they call up the CIA let's say you're in the CIA you get this call and you think oh man this guy this clown really made a blueberry or really did a dumb thing you know inexperienced president non-politician doesn't really listen to his briefings really made a dumb mistake what's the first call you're gonna make the Washington Post you know if you're a patriot is that who you're going to call the Washington Post had if the Washington Post had it then the New York Times had it then BuzzFeed had it in the Wall Street Journal at it these guys are after the president they're trying to bring him down and listen to the way the Wall Street Journal not a it's not a left-wing paper but it's new sort it's news reporting is to the left though it's op eds are to the right here's the way they said this this was the latest in a string of controversy all stemming from investigations into mr. Trump's associates and presidential campaign over ties to Russia now I ask you how is that stemming from that how does this stem from that the next sentence is mr. Trump last week fired mr. Comey who was heading up the investigation into the ties between Trump associates and Russia and testifying about the probe all I'm saying is that's that is narrative writing that is telling you that this is somehow connected to this investigation and Comey was fired to stop this investigation this is a narrative writing and the idea here is not that you believe each and every scandal what when the when the Russian narrative of Comey was fired to kill the Russian investigation narrative when that really became illogical and stupid the next narrative comes along and the thing is to keep up a constant from beat of hysteria so that when Trump who let's face it as a chaotic guy he's a chaotic guy he may be a bit of a bum blur he certainly in experienced heat talks he's got a big mouth so when he really does something wrong right when he really makes a mistake and as every president does the atmosphere will be like it will be like leaked gas and it will be like a spark going off and it'll blow up that's the point that's what they did to george w bush with hurricane katrina it was one fake non scandal scandal after another and then when he did make some mistakes during hurricane katrina although all the reporting about it about Katrina and what was happening in New Orleans it all turned out to be ridiculous and false Bush did make a couple of errors they got him you know because there was this atmosphere that this has been going wrong and wrong and wrong and wrong and now look the whole disaster has and that's what they're trying to do to this guy and all I'm asking is to ask yourself why that's happening forget about Trump forget about his personality forget about he does this how he treats women forget all that stuff is he right is this is his infrastructure program too far to the left is his are his judges too far to the right does he think too much of Putin forget about all of it he's a manifestation of a cry from the people who were left behind and those people are all the people in between New York and LA they are all the people who are not being taught addressed by the bureaucracy they're all the people who globalization has shafted and the thing that globalization is that because it's not just the left who likes globalization it's conservatives too because it's free trade and it kind of it kind of gives a a poke in the eye to the union's it basically says the union's oh you asked for so you know I would i would say conservatives don't necessarily dislike unions but their unions suspicious as they should be because unions are necessary evil both of those things are true this is not public sector unions which are a complete scam but private unions are both necessary and evil you know they ask for too much they destroy industries they destroy jobs but without them we know that people get abused okay so they are necessary evil so conservatives kind of like globalization but think about this for a minute globalization means that if I can have my one piece of my iPhone made in indochina and one piece of my iPhone made here and there and another place I can assemble these all together while I the manager the the top guy the intellectual guy the elite guy I make a fortune and you get a cheaper iPhone which is great but the guys who made those things in America get shafted they get shafted and the thing about it is is the thing that made me an intellectual that made me that made the country that turned me into the smart wonderful guy I am who's making so much money that was done by those workers who are getting shafted now and they are screaming they are screaming that while you well the President of the United States was talking about who gets to use the bathroom in their school you know you guys ignored us we want somebody to speak for us we're tired of the immigrants coming into our communities we're tired of you not you telling us who to like and what to be like and what marriage were tired of all that stuff we just want the economy to work again Obama was the first president ever never had an economy growing to three percent these people got shafted they got shafted by the left they got shafted by the right they got shafted by globalization they were left behind and now they're speaking out and as Trump said they want the power returned to the people and that power doesn't like that and that is why I'm hammering the press because I feel what they are doing is unpatriotic it's dishonest and it's wrong and it has nothing to do with Donald Trump Donald Trump as his good days and as his bad days I hope he has more good days than bad days but what is going on is wrong this is an attempt to overturn the results of an honest legal election and the press should be ashamed of themselves and they should be we should fight it's too bad the right is for too long let the press go the way it goes because we don't have the instruments to investigate the way they do we can only commentate like this and so that's what I'm doing all right let's bring on Kristin is have we got him now good luck Chris we've been waiting Kristin dodo is an award-winning journalist film critic and podcaster he's the founder of Hollywood in Toto calm and host of the weekly Hollywood in Toto podcast each IT podcast which offers a right-of-center perspective on entertainment news which makes you virtually unique it makes you virtually unique because the only pro krishnan is that one of the few people actually understands the entertainment it's Trickey talks about it from the right he's got movie reviews on several radio stations across the country including WTOP FM in Washington he also co-hosts Denver's Mike Rosen at the movies radio show on KOAT news radio as well as the weekly Hollyweird segment on the Michael Brown show find him on Twitter at Hollywood in Toto tio tio how you doing Kristen I'm good happy that's a long a long arc and I wanted to tell people because not people don't hear about you enough because like it's it's just so rare that somebody talking on the right knows what he's talking about so it's good to talk about so you were at a piece that I just thought was terrific called how reporters hide damning info on liberal storms and this is a question that I think a lot of us on the right worry about why can these guys you know why can they get away with saying the stuff they say what why can the left left-wing stars why don't they suffer the box office it and so on or do that well it's two things one the media does cover-up for them so not enough people know about it if people knew what joss whedon the director of the avengers says on twitter they would be aghast i mean i have liberal friends who i share it with on twitter and they're horrified but what he says I mean he weaponized cancer-stricken teens to make fun of Paul Ryan and Donald Trump that was one of his more recent I think he'll that tell a story so people know what what is so Paul Ryan was meeting with some cancer-stricken teens and I just forget the specific context but it was a picture that Ryan had tweeted out with him and the teens just talking about what he was up to you know reaching out to different sort of constituents joss whedon retweeted that and said something about how donald trump was looking for a new wife our new girlfriend but these these aren't exactly tens so he was mocking the looks of these young teenagers in order to attack Trump I mean it was a gas even Whedon who is reprehensible on Twitter eventually took it down but took a while and he just said on Mother's Day what was his post on Mother's Day about the I'm glad my mother's dead or something like this because because she wouldn't see this sort of this expletive filled country that were in right now okay yeah so now that's sweet I mean that's a real basic mom of a brick shit so so Josh Whedon what what is you know what he's up to at the moment I mean he's a big time guy right you know he's between projects but he's in serious discussions if it hasn't been already inked to direct a Batgirl film again he is mister comic-con geek he's very talented he's very good at what he does so it's a perfect project for him so but people don't know about this other side of him so what why don't they know well because if you look at the Hollywood Reporter and deadline.com and all these major websites they don't report on it they ignore it okay but if Scott Baio who is not the biggest star in the galaxy I'm sad to say if he mentioned something about erin moran dying and maybe accusing her of being you know gaveling in drugs in her final days incorrectly that's bein stream news that's all over that he has to apologize for so these guys are running interference for the for these guy I mean I remember LaDonna all right she made that speech about blowing up the White House one can only imagine what would have happened if somebody had said I mean I remember a clown a rodeo clown said something about Obama and lost his job basically yeah he had death threats against him to my clan so did they do these guys feel I mean will Josh Whedon when his movie comes out and is it whatever his next project comes out will he suffer at the box office for this you know I don't think so in part of it because the projects like that are so big and the brand is so strong and the connection to the audience is more about the superheroes and sort of the saving the day that I think really hardcore conservatives who are involved in this and invest in this will not be enough to kind of sway the box office now every case is different like Amy Schumer I think she's basically made her brand toxic because she's been so aggressive and so partisan and so mean-spirited so that when her new movie comes out it's going to have a harder time at the box office because so many people are aghast at her so it will suffer but you know a big franchise superhero brand I think it's more it's much more bulletproof frankly yeah I'm now shoe murder didn't sure we get attacked from the left though in her last movie the movie she made with Goldie Hawn it's amazing they said it was racist it was insensitive it was it was white girls going off to a foreign land and getting trouble and and meeting people who had brown skin who are bad frankly I defended her it's a mediocre movie it's not racist yeah I mean you can have a character from America go to a foreign land and get kidnapped you can't just wipe that out as a possibility that is a story point it could be good it could be bad it could be in between but you can't say that that can't be done unless they must they have more empowered people of color or in case you change the color of the stars it's it's absurd - all they cited you just know within you so with that that's all they see is a call is people's call I mean yeah he's left ISM is racism essentially so how bad I mean recently the show and I have to admit I have not watched the show of Takashi last-man-standing yes last-minute thing it was cancelled I know that it was a very fiercely anti-obama show or at least the character would talk about you know being against Obama and all the stuff and it got cancelled it's been on for a long time right it was on for years six years is that I mean everybody's up in arms about this it was very popular show is that an economic decision or do you think it's a political listen I think it's both sort of the ABC is saying that the the costs were getting too high but were there a negotiation period was there sort of a give-and-take I mean a lot of time is a lot of wiggle room in these shows where you could say okay we can adjust the salaries we can kind of maybe have different partners producing kind of defray the costs this is a show with very strong ratings you know after the election some studio heads genuinely said hey maybe there's a part of the country we're not addressing maybe we need to think about that make more content that speaks to them and then they can sell a Last Man Standing which is one of the few shows that does that directly and just before we got to be on the air here Tim Allen tweeted out he was blindsided by ABC real he took a few days to comment on it but he just sent it out via Twitter so Wow he did not know this was going to happen yeah and this was I think this might be his first comment of any capacity but the bottom line is that this is the show that is rare yeah with good ratings and a big star and an audience and an anchor for your network why would you want to kill it you know one of the things that bothers me about this can we play a cut wall a Christian is on one of the things that really bothers me about this take a look at this some at this Colbert cut this is Colbert last night you got I have something to say here Donald Trump if you're watching first of all you're a bad president please resign second of all so here here's what I worry about right when when way I'm still laughing hold I know I know the hilarity never ceases hey you know the write quite reasonably we get so disgusted with this stuff that they essentially turn their back and walk away and I get this every time I talk about this I get emails and comments saying oh I never go to the movies anymore I don't watch TV anymore they're all this leftist you know garbage and all this stuff but meanwhile Colbert is essentially training his audience to cheer at a remark like that I mean well by what but you know it's not a funny remark it's it's like the guy is a professional clown telling the President to resign I mean can you imagine somebody there's not one comic on late-night who's not to the left of center not one and all that's like 5 to 7 comics I've lost count it bothers me that that the right is deserting basically the entertainment media so they have no Colbert has no reason to speak to the right because his audience is growing because all the lefties are going there so what's the answer I mean is there stuff for instance have you seen anything recently that you've loved that you just thought spoke to you as a conservative you know not as a conservative as a movie goer for sure actually the movie get out was interesting kind of poked a little fun at progressives in also - yeah there is pseudo racism or their actual racism disguised as sort of tolerance and the infiltrator came out late last year it's on Amazon Prime it's very good but as far as sort of things with a right-of-center bent I'd be hard-pressed to come up with that but you know I actually had a story at Hollywood in toto a couple days ago why is no channel putting on a right-of-center talk show host this we've got Jim Jim Jeffries is coming soon he's a liberal Sarah Silverman's coming up soon she's a liberal you've got an entire array of people who are all left-of-center or worse I mean she's economically speaking you can have the country who wouldn't you what conservative wouldn't tune in for that even if the jokes are mediocre even if the guy or gal was was flat-footed at first yeah yeah I made there's such a hunger for that it's why Fox News worth it all is successful right and now with no entrepreneur no streaming service say hey this is a no-brainer right and nobody I mean nobody's imitated even South Park which is at least a libertarian show and nobody has done anything for younger people basically you know Fox News must have an audience from 62 dead I mean Blue Bloods you know blue bloods which is a very is a fairly conservative show it's still it's a show for older people which is fine you know it's not like that audience shouldn't be served but I find young people to be very antic and libertarian they want to be left alone they think people should be free they get that message and I and I just don't understand why we don't fill up that space on how well it's the power brokers in Hollywood our left-of-center they will fund different projects I mean you think about what they do fund remember a couple years ago that movie truth with Dan the Dan Rather story yeah who who in their right mind thought you know it that's a box-office hit ya know it wanted to tell the story and they wanted to reframe the narrative that's what the point was yes that's it doesn't even matter that it's failed because that boo is going to pop up on cable and stream services for the next 50 years right and that narrative will be pushed against the truth and that's why like the path to 9/11 by Cyrus no Oscar which basically told the truth about Bill Clinton not killing Osama bin Laden when he had the chance it's never been released on DVD the Disney Company will not let that happen as long as a Clint any Clinton might run for president which is forever perfectly so what is it anything coming up that you wanted before you go let me ask you about anything any films coming up that we should look forward to you know alien covenant comes out this week and Ridley Scott's behind the camera again equals he created alien he also did Prometheus which was not that good he actually recently had a made a call about that one so I'm kind of curious about that you know other films it's summer blockbuster season I mean spider-man homecoming it's the you know this is kind of the silly season when it comes to film so nothing is kind of look truly kind of getting me to excited play war for the Planet of the Apes maybe kind of fits that bill yeah because those first two films have been very solid very thoughtful really good science-fiction so I'm hopeful for that what he Harrelson's the star here of course the real start the Apes but yeah yeah I don't know we'll see you know and I'm the only person in America didn't like guardians of the galaxy vol 2's no no everybody saw it here and didn't like either they they said it was kind of a bomb all right Christian toto from toto from Hollywood in toto it's good to see you and we'll do this again sounds good thanks thanks a lot it really is it really is so unfair the way that's christened Toto find him in Hollywood in toto calm and also on Twitter at Hollywood in toto writes really good stuff and it's just you know to many of our people just had abandoned Hollywood an empty entertainment industry completely so that the people only people left commenting don't know what they're talking about but the thing about Christian is yeah like the movies he knows good movies when he sees them and it makes a big difference alright stuff I like you know I I want to talk about this film this is the other of these small films I watched over the weekend and I really liked it I will warn you that my wife found it a little slow so it may be a guy film in some way that I didn't realize but this is a movie about capitalism and what I liked about it is that it got both the good and the bad of capitalism and I always talk about you know we systems are like language you know that language never quite expresses the deepest things you know you can't really talk about God about love about all the most important things because language is a rude tool and systems are the same way capitalism is the closest we've ever come to a free-market system but it has a lot of flaws it does overdue overdue things sometimes you know we talk about somebody asked me recently a young person asked me recently I frequently say that the idea of objectifying women is a false idea made to make men's natural urges and lusts and desires made to make them sound like they're bad like it's bad that men like to look at pretty girls oh that's objectifying women and somebody said well is don't commercials where they show sell you a product with a beautiful girl isn't that objectifying women and he said you know commercials that's objectifying men it's essentially saying to them oh look at this you can have this girl if you buy our car which is nonsense you know so so essentially that's all commercials do that and commercials do in fact cheap in our discourse and we like we've come to accept them we've come to accept the way they manipulate us that's that's one thing that cap that's not so good the way it sells drugs so that they invent a drug that maybe helps people who have a chemical imbalance and are depressed and they start to sell it to you like if you're depressed at any time and all this so here's a movie that just gets this right it's called the founder and you may not has anybody seen it no okay and it's it's about Ray Kroc who basically discovered two brothers selling hamburgers the two brothers who were named McDonald's and he discovered them and he took this idea and he saw what a great idea was and he took it to the obviously to the next level and it is about the good of that and the incredible creativity that capitalism inspires and rewards and it's about how that creativity gets somewhat corrupted as things get bigger and bigger and bigger because it is part of capitalism that things get bigger and bigger and bigger Michael Keaton is the star and other great performance he's really a terrific actor and he's got a kind of Renaissance recently he plays Ray Kroc and here's a sequence this terrific sequence where what he realizes they're having a hard time as they get bigger and bigger they're having a hard time keeping the standard of the restaurant up and this is very important to these McDonald brothers that these restaurants keep a high standard and Kroc suddenly has an inspiration he suddenly realizes that there are people in America called Americans who want to do a good job because they have good values and he goes out he starts to collect people to franchise to run these franchises who he knows will be good at what they do because they believe in the American values and he goes out and sells them and this is a montage of him selling McDonald's franchises too you know lodges temples synagogues any
