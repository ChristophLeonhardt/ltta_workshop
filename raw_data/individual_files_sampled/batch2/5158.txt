earlier this morning we told you how yesterday the president's military parade in Washington has been delayed until 2019 that news coming after a defense official told NBC News earlier in the day that the estimated cost for the parade had skyrocketed to 92 million dollars now President Trump is taking credit for the delay tweeting moments ago the local politicians who run Washington DC poorly no a windfall when they see it when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it never let someone hold you up I will instead attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date and go to the Paris parade celebrating the end of the war on November 11th maybe we will do something next year in DC when the cost comes way down now we can buy some more jet fighters is that all too predictable Tyler take incredible rum that he invented yeah get it down you know like it wasn't gonna happen it was a dumb idea to begin with I mean there's no reason to have there's no event to celebrate a military parade people don't want it the Pentagon doesn't want the military doesn't want it the only person who would see the one is Donald Trump I mean because you saw a nice parade of France on Bastille Day I just can't forget that and but it just goes to show how much again Donald Trump always brings it back to himself I am going to do this I did this so the parade was to celebrate our country our veterans and yes he ran into a lot of trouble like we mentioned earlier like having tanks go down Constitution Avenue that's a right I might rip up the yeah so that couldn't just a little problem okay again we shouldn't be surprised that yeah when you see such a weak leader who cannot come up with any real plan but he has to back away from it and that's what it does well no my parade I got my paper my parade was my parade okay all right coming up next on Morning Joe I have a friend he used to like France used to and he was going to France and I said how's your trip going he goes where France he said I'm not going to France because France is no longer France I have a friend every year he goes to Paris I haven't seen him in a while pareo the city of lights he's telling me for years pari pari I see him like a month ago how was Paris this summer well I don't go to Paris you kidding me it's no longer Paris I have a friend he's a very very substantial guy he loves the City of Lights he loves Paris I hadn't seen him in a while and I said Jim let me ask you a question how's Paris doing Paris I don't go there anymore Paris is no longer Paris that is the president talking about his mysterious friend Jim who apparently no longer goes to Paris nobody really knows who Jim is and there are some other nameless characters that the president uses in his favorite anecdotes who may or may not actually exist people explain that next time Morning Joe thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
