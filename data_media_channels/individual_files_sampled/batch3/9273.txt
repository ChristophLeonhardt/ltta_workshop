THEY SET UP $25,000 TO COVER THOSE COSTS. ROB: ANGELA MERKEL IN MIDST OF OPEN-BORDER CRISIS THAT COULD PUT HER OUT OF A JOB AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO STOP FROM HAPPENING HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE NO WALL, WE HAVE NO BORDER SECURITY. WITHOUT A BORDER, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. ROB: BUT WITH A RECORD-NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS ON AMERICA'S DOORSTEP, WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO STRENGTHEN THE BORDER? JILLIAN: IS THE PRESIDENT'S TOP APPROACH WILL SAVE AS THE SAME FATE AS GERMANY. JOINING US RIGHT NOW NIGHAL FARAGE, JOINING US LIVE HERE IN THE STUDIO. GOOD MORNING. JILLIAN: SO NICE TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GERMANY? YOU KNOW, SHE WAS THE MOST POWERFUL EUROPEAN LEADER, BEEN IN POWER OVER DECADE, DOMINANT FIGURE NOT JUST IN GERMANY BUT EUROPEAN UNION, ONE DECISION HAS COMPLETELY RUINED HER CAREER AND LEGACY AND I THINK IT WAS THE WORST DECISION ANY WESTERN LEADER. AS MANY OF YOU WANT TO COME, CAN COME, OVER A MILLION PEOPLE CAME TO GERMANY. WE HAVE NOW SEEN IN THE LAST 4 YEARS OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN EUROPE KILLED OR MAINED BY REFUGEES. A NEW PARTY IN GERMANY EMERGED, IT'S GETTING NEAR 20% OF POLLS AND PUT ABSOLUTELY FEAR OF GOD INTO THE ESTABLISHMENT. SHE'S GOT TWO WEEKS TO TRY AND CONVINCE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO CHANGE DIRECTION BUT IT'S A BIT RICH, ISN'T IT, FOR THE PERSON WHO OPEN THE DOOR AND TO SAY IT'S TIME TO GET TOUGH. SHE'S FINISHED. ROB: THE PRESIDENT SAYS GERMANY HAS HIGH-CRIME RATE THAT GOES UP, HE GETS LOM PASTED BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, 2015-2016, WHEN ALL THIS BECAME A PROBLEM, THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE WENT UP SOMETHING LIKE 10% OF GERMANY. OH, YEAH. DON'T FORGET CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN. REFUGEES, YOUNG MALES UNDER THE AGE OF 30, THEY COME FROM CULTURES IN WHICH WOMEN AREN'T SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. IS ANYONE SURPRISED? THE HUGE RISE IN SEXUAL CRIME. LOOK, IMMIGRATION LED TO BREXIT VOTE, IMMIGRATION LED TO NEW ITALIAN GOVERNMENT, IMMIGRATION WILL FINISH OFF ANGELA MERKEL AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ELECTED ON A VERY TOUGH TICKET OF DEALING WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND NOW YOU'VE GOT THE LIBERAL MEDIA SCREAMING AT EVERYTHING HE DOES, BUT THE ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN IF TRUMP IS NOT HOLD TRUE AND REALLY TIGHTEN IMMIGRATION, MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT AND VOTED FOR HIM WON'T DO IT FOR HIM. IT'S A KEY ISSUE HERE TOO. JILLIAN: THERE'S BEEN 27% INCREASE IN ASIGH RUM SEEKERS JUST IN 2017. YOU MENTIONED PRESIDENT TRUMP AND TOUGH STANCE, YOU ALSO SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS HOUSE, THIS WEEK RAMPED UP ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BORDER, SEPARATION OF FAMILIES, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE UNITED STATES CAN GERMANY AND WHAT WE CAN DO GOING FORWARD? IT TURNED OUT MANY OF THOSE WHO WERE CALLED CHILDREN WERE IN FACT, OVER 18. UP WITH OF THEM TRIED TO BLOW UP LONDON SUBWAY. SO IT'S VERY EASY TO BE COMPASSIONATE BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IN THE CASE OF AMERICA AND BORDERS, MANY OF THE CHILDREN ARE BEING USED AS MEANS TO GET OTHER PEOPLE IN, MANY WHO AREN'T EVEN FAMILIES. YOU'VE GOT TO, TRUMP HAS GOT TO STAY TOUGH ON THIS AND IGNORE ALL THE SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LIBERAL MEDIA. ROB: IS THE TOUGH PART BEING PRAGMATIC WHILE NOT APPEARING TO BE SOLE ES, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, THIS IS BEING ABUSED AS RECORD BREAK. THIS IS NOW A THOUSAND PERCENT MORE PEOPLE THAT NEED ASYLUM. THIS IS THE LOOPHOLE AND THEY ARE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO AND COACHED HOW TO DO IT AND HERE THEY ARE. IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. ONE THING HE HASN'T DONE YET, HE HASN'T BUILD THE WALL, MAYBE IT'S TIME HE STARTS IT. ROB: THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON THAT. HE'S TRYING TO GET THE FUNDING, THAT'S THE HARD PART. THAT'S THE HARD PART AND OBVIOUSLY CONGRESS. HE HAS TO GET THIS THROUGH, HE NEEDS TALKING TOUGH IS ONE THING BUT DELIVERING IS WHAT REALLY
