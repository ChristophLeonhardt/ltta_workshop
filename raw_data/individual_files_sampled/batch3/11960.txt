elsewhere virtually all computers including smartphones and tablets it seems to at risk now two major security flaws discovered in processing chips no breaches have been reported yet but the bugs could potentially allow hackers to get hold of users passwords photos and emails both floors apparently work by exploiting the way your device handles your data it's supposed to be isolated and locked up but this meltdown bug potentially lets hackers grab it while it's being sent to apps requesting it the problem affects Intel chips used by almost all Apple devices the specter bug meantime works a bit differently but affects almost all machines and cloud-based servers it tricks applications into leaking your private info scary makes it harder to fix the floor now in late November it appears Intel's CEO sold off a large chunk of his shares after he was apparently made aware of the problem with the chips Igor's Danoff takes a closer look at the extent of the threat posed by these new security flaws here's a safe bet if you own a computer or a smartphone a newfound vulnerability has almost certainly opened the gates to your most intimate information whether you have a PC a Mac a Linux run computer or an Android phone it doesn't matter this hole could be built in to billions of devices worldwide have some pictures you're not too proud of well a hacker can access an awful lot more your passwords encryption keys emails and cached files all of the above from the comfort of their living room you can slip onto a malicious website have your private data exposed and you won't even know about it a perfect crime security experts say the attack leaves no traces behind what's particularly embarrassing normally companies won't publish this kind of information until a fix has been released this time however someone's been trigger-happy with sharing the problem which means hack is everywhere now know about it too while security updates are only beginning to come out and the fix itself is expected to come for many at a cost researchers say computers that came out just three years ago could suffer up to a 30% performance tumble factories of course are downplaying the potential impact saying the average user won't notice the difference Igor's done of Artie
