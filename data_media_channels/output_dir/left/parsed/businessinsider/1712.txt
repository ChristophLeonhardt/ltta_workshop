our power comes with a responsibility to
lead
people have to get to know that they can
count on you that you won't say one
thing one day and something totally
different the next and it certainly
takes more than trying to make up for a
year of insults and insinuations by
dropping in on our neighbors for a few
hours and then flying home again that is
not how it works American leadership
means leading with our values in
pursuing of our interest in protection
of our security at our best the United
States is the global force for freedom
justice and human dignity
