on Friday the Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit it will be his second foreign trip this week ahead of the engagement he was asked by journalists whether he will be bringing any gifts for his Chinese counterpart Dean dr. Muhammad or Sandhya will you bring me give this here it won't be a surprise if I say in advance what exactly I'm bringing I told you before how Chinese businessmen told me how Chinese love Russian ice cream I promised them I'd bring some over myself and so I brought you an entire box of ice cream as a gift let it be a secret between me and you I will whisper it to you later the interview touched on various topics from regional security to birthday's presents to football Anisha Sethi has more details there's no doubts that President Putin will be bringing a gift along with him during his state visit to China on June the 8th to meet President Xi Jinping the two are very good friends and President Putin will share a birthday with him as well let's take a listen the Chairman C Chien ping is the only world leader with whom I have spent one of my birthday's I just have not had that kind of relationship with anyone else and my schedule did not allow spending my birthday with any of my other foreign counterparts but I was able to do so with Xi Jinping now during the three-day state visit President Putin will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit also known as the SCO and together these countries make up the fourth largest production of world GDP and they also make up 43% of the world's population now it's also a security organization as well so the topic of North Korea will no doubt oblique on earth but when talking about the Korean Peninsula in the interview President Putin said that they want to go down the path that will defuse tensions between North Korea syrota courteous carrucha was the North Korean leadership has taken unprecedented steps towards de-escalation of tensions and frankly I did not expect that yeah I can understand the North Korean leadership when they say that for the full denuclearization of the peninsula they need absolute guarantees of their security and how else could it be it is not possible to imagine it any other way especially after the tragic events that happened in Libya and Iraq the North Koreans remember them very well I still hope that this meeting a very brave and mature decision u.s. president donald trump has made to have direct contacts with North Korean leader Kim jong-un will take place and we all expect a positive outcome during this interview and Sam's got the chance to ask President Putin and some questions and they were obviously football-related seeing as their football World Cup which kicks off on June the 14th Dustin that's a difficult one there are many title contenders there are latin-american teams like Argentina and Brazil we also know that the German team showed great game at previous tournaments and a high quality of football was also demonstrated by the Spanish team I am sure there are going to be other title contenders but the strongest will win yes I have a couple of footballers who might consider extraordinary and who can obviously lay claim to the title among Russian and Soviet players it is live Yushin among foreign footballers it's Pele well I also like Maradona
