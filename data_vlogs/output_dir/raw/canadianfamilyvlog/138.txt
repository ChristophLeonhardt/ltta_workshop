00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,950
what a morning I had today I don't know

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,440
if any of you have kids that take a bus

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,019
and are frustrated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,910
bossing system because that's me this

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,550
morning I am so frustrated I've got all

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,560
the daycare kids in the morning plus my

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,510
own kids and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abney to</font>

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,330
the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the street</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the bus</font>

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,960
stop in minus 32 weather with blasting

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,480
wind with two babies like is that

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,020
honestly really fair when the bus drives

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,840
right by my house yeah that's right it

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,780
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly by my house and turns the</font>

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,180
corner like it's at a different corner

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,180
so my house is on one corner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus</font>

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,100
stop is on the other corner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">street and I'm just so frustrated by</font>

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,199
this so I called and they said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,270
would look into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they said they</font>

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't make exceptions for some parents</font>

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">not others and like there's lots of bus</font>

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,170
stops that go by people's houses and I'm

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,530
like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> but she's the only one at the</font>

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,520
stop so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really does it make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense no why</font>

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,600
can't you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> move it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the other</font>

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,460
corner it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not that big of a</font>

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,140
deal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would really help me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out I</font>

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,790
didn't play the pregnant card but i

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,770
think i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call back again today</font>

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,420

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to call me back cuz you said you would</font>

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,259
you didn't anyways so this morning I was

33
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I'm not gonna bundle</font>

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,930
the street when it dries right by<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">house so I thought Avenue we'll just</font>

37
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,740
catch the bus at the driveway<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

38
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,540
see the bus coming you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> run out and</font>

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,450
we'll catch it so we did that and the

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,460
bus driver<font color="#E5E5E5"> refused to take her she said</font>

41
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that um we she can't stop at an</font>

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,049
unregistered stop that she has a

43
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,240
built-in GPS on her bus that they can

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,970
see if she stops elsewhere and there's

45
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,369
stop sign there too so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's just</font>

46
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,290
stopping her stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> signs not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that big of</font>

47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,270
a deal but she says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she could lose</font>

48
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,159
her job and she's got feed her family

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,650
and she<font color="#CCCCCC"> understands frustrating</font>

50
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,690
but she can't do it and she refused<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,890
take her to school even though she

52
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,180
stopped and talked to me she still

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,340
refused to put out any on the bus so I

54
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,419
was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> upset this morning and Avenue</font>

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,550
