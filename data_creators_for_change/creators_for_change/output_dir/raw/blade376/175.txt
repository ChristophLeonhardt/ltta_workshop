pages and pages from people telling me

26
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,670
about their personal experiences telling

27

me how they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the edge of life</font>

28

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,640
has advice which is objective because i

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,570
everyone in a constructive way

35
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,580
furthermore because it's a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,460
consistent advice and people can view it

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,799
whenever they feel comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

give any more justification for the
