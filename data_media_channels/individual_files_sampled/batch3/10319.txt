the first thing you need to know about Newton or Calliope said it was restricted goki as it used to be called about 30 years ago was completely off-limits for foreigners and the reason for that was this the gas car factory during the Second World War the factory was forced reduce military equipment and because of that it got completely flattened by German bombs look at that that's how hard you have to push amazingly enough it took only a hundred days for the local community to completely rebuild the band and it was then when they was up and running that the city became a restricted zone I'm just gonna go free I'm totally half a car this is now a multi-billion dollar operation and around 20,000 people work here it used to be a lot more actually five times more but then these fellows arrived I think it's everyone's lunch hour now I'm on my own the factory is mine I'm completely on my own I could actually now make my own car and no one would know better
