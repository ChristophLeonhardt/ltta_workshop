yeah of course I want to say thank you very much to mr. Putin I wrote him a letter and you know appealed to him so I really appreciate that he signed off and realized his that it means very much to me not to be Russian I've said before I said a lot that I feel like I've been rushing for a long time I feel like I already have it in my soul in my heart and this is just official this just makes it official for documents you know I have a school in Krasnogorsk and fun to make many world champions from our school and it makes it easier to be Russian citizen it makes it easier to travel it makes it easier to do business it makes it easier to do some of the work I want to do and of course in the future when I want to be involved politics it's a necessity I need to be a official Russian citizen and like I said I have it in my heart but this makes it official just makes it easier for me to do some of the things that I wanted you to help other people and especially work with my school yes I finally got the Russian citizenship and when I come from Miami salmon Miami now when I come next week I hope to take the oath to get the passport I had a you know long haul it's taken a couple years three years since I applied for it but I went the long way you know I didn't go through any political party I went through just like an ordinary person that had the Russian soul that loves Russia and I had many people help me right now I don't have any plans to renounce my US citizenship and the reason for this is simple I have I have children our family in the United States and it's important to me to be a part of their life but in the next few years when I get into the more into politics and try to really help people be in a position where I can really help people and make a run for the State Duma then it's a necessity that I renounce my US in ships oh and that's that's my plan you know I'm for Russia and I'm gonna dedicate my life to making Russia even better than it is you
