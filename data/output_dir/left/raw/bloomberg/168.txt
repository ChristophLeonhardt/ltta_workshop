401
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:10,671
GOOGLE HAS STRUGGLED TO COME UP

00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:12,874

IT'S CLOSEST TO APPLE'S FACETIME

00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:29,457
OBVIOUSLY GOOGLE WINS A LOT OF

411
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:30,825
THINGS.

412
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:31,626
BY A THEY TRYING TO DO THIS?

PRIMARY MODE OF COMMUNICATION

415
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,001
WHICH IS MESSAGING PLATFORMS.

416
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,336
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:42,136
PEOPLE ON THIS PLATFORM IT IS

418
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:42,837

MONETIZATION POTENTIAL OF THIS

00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:49,844
MASSIVE AUDIENCE BECAUSE MORE

00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:51,712

MESSAGING PLATFORMS.

426
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:54,949
FACEBOOK AND SNAPCHAT AND THE

00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:57,785

432
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:05,927

00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:10,198
FOR EVERY USER.

435
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:10,998
THERE ARE FEATURES THAT ARE A

436
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:12,934
LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,970

THAT.

00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,577
THOSE THINGS, IF THEY CATCH ON,

442
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:26,114
APPLE CAN REPLICATE.

443
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:29,083
FACEBOOK MESSENGER OR SNAPCHAT

444
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,218
CAN HAVE THAT.

445
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:31,719
IT WILL BE A BIG UPHILL BATTLE.

446
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:35,189
EMILY: FACEBOOK AND SOME OF

00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:36,023
THESE ASIAN MESSAGING COMPANIES

448
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:38,426

HOW OPTIMISTIC ARE YOU THAT

450
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,695
GOOGLE WILL BE ABLE TO CATCH UP?

451
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:44,599
JITENDRA: IF YOU LOOK AT THE

452
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:45,399
HISTORY OF GOOGLE TRYING TO

453
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,001
CLOSE THE SOCIAL NETWORK GAP,

454
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:48,269
THAT DID NOT GO WELL.

455
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,739
THERE WAS THIS DILEMMA.

456
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:52,573
AT SOME POINT IT WILL COME UP

457
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:54,375
AGAIN.

458
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:58,045
EVEN THE AI-RICH FEATURES, IF

459
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:01,382
THAT CATCHES ON, FACEBOOK WILL

460
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:02,684
NOT BE THAT FAR BEHIND.

461
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:03,518
THEY ALREADY HAVE THE AUDIENCE

00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:06,454
IN THE ENGAGEMENT.

463
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:08,789
IN BETWEEN THE TWO PLATFORMS YOU

464
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:09,590
HAVE ONE BILLION PEOPLE IN EACH

465
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,793
ONE OF THEM AND GROWING.

466
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:12,627
THIS WILL BE AN UPHILL BATTLE

467
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:14,195
AND GOOGLE WILL HAVE TO FACE THE

468
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:17,565
DILEMMA OF SHOULD WE BUY OR

469
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:18,032
BUILD.

470
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:22,103
EMILY: WHAT IS THE MONETIZATION

471
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:24,071
POTENTIAL OF VIDEO CHAT APPS

472
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:25,740
LIKE THIS FOR GOOGLE?

473
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,574
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN THEY MAKE?

474
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:29,710
JITENDRA: IT'S JUST ABOUT THE

475
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,778
MESSAGING PLATFORM.

476
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:31,546
EVENTUALLY THEY CONVERGE.

477
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,314
NOW THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

478
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:34,549
ONES.

479
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:37,518
PROBABLY THE STRATEGY IS IF ONE

480
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,353
OF THEM CATCHES ON, THEY CAN

481
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:40,488
INTEGRATE THE OTHER AND GET THE

EARLY LEGS.

00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:50,865
ONCE THE ORGANIC INTERACTION

488
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:51,666

00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,568
RISE.

490
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:56,971

00:16:57,772 --> 00:16:58,205
ICEBERG.

THEY DO SO MUCH.

00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:08,348
UNIVISION IS SAID TO BE BUYING

498

GAWKER MEDIA FOR $135 MILLION.

499
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:15,857
THIS ACCORDING TO REUTERS.

500
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,191
UNIVISION WAS ONE OF TWO

501
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:19,393
BIDDERS, WITH DAVIS TAKING A

502
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:22,696
FORMAL OFFER FOR GAWKER.

00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:26,601

00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:38,012
AIRBNB HAS A ZERO CHANCE OF

00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:38,845
REACHING A HIGH LEVEL CHANCE OF

510
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:40,848
 SUCCESS THERE.

EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW AND THOUGHT

RECENT UBER DEAL.

THEM.

525
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:25,546
THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN MORE TIME

526
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:26,380
TO ELIMINATE GOOBER, BUT THAT

527
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,415

U.S. STARTUPS AND THE SHARING

00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:37,424
ECONOMY BUSINESS, LIKE AIRBNB

531
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:38,192
WHICH IS TRYING HARD TO BREAK

532
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:39,627
INTO CHINA AND LOOKING FOR A

533
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:40,428
CHINESE CEO?

534
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:45,166
>> I THINK LOOKING FOR CHINESE

535
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:45,800

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,103
THAT IS SOMETHING  UBER NEVER

537
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:51,005
DID AND IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR

00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:51,772
ANY AMERICAN COMPANY OPERATING

539
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,041
IN CHINA.

540
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,842
AIRBNB IS SMART TO LOOK FOR A

541
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:55,342
CHINESE CEO.

542
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:59,847
ITS BUSINESS IS CULTURALLY

543
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,716
DIFFERENT TO BE RUN IN CHINA.

544
00:21:01,716 --> 00:21:04,518
I THINK MOST OF THEIR EFFORTS

545
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:05,920
ARE TRYING TO GET CHINESE

546
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,754
TOURISTS TO STAY IN AIRBNB

547
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:08,789
ABROAD, WHICH IS OK.

548
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:11,725
BUT IF THEY WANTED, AND BUILT AN

549
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:13,627
AMERICAN LIKE FRANCHISE, I THINK

550
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:16,564
THE USER BASE, THE HABITS OF

551
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:19,834

00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,403
EXPECTATIONS ON PEOPLE WHO LEASE

553
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:25,439
OUT SPACE AND PEOPLE WHO TRY TO

554
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:28,075
RENT SPACE ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

555
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:28,943
THEY WILL BE IN FOR A CULTURE

556
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:33,114
SHOCK.

00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:34,915

HOW LIKELY WILL THEY BECOME AN

APPLE-LEVEL OF SUCCESS IN CHINA,

00:21:56,704 --> 00:21:57,271
I WOULD SAY ZERO.

568
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:59,907
EMILY: WHAT ABOUT LESS THAN

569
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:01,976
APPLE, LIKE AN AIRBNB LEVEL OF

570
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:04,879
SUCCESS IN THE U.S.?

571
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:10,985
>> THAT IS ALSO ZERO.

572
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:16,123
IF THEY WANT AN UBER TYPE

573
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:16,957
OPPORTUNITY THEY PROBABLY HAVE A

574
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:17,291
SHOT.

575
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,959
EMILY: OBVIOUSLY FACEBOOK IS

576
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,996
STILL BLOCKED IN CHINA, TWITTER

577
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:25,733
IS STILL BLOCKED IN CHINA.

578
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,600
WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF THOSE

579
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,368
COMPANIES EVER BEING UNBLOCKED

580
00:22:27,368 --> 00:22:27,768
IN CHINA?

581
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:32,873
>> I THINK IT IS ALMOST NOT

582
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:33,641
RELEVANT FOR THOSE COMPANIES

583
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:35,976
ANYMORE BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY

584
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:38,345
WERE ACCESSIBLE, USER HABITS ARE

585
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:40,114
VERY WELL FORMED.

586
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:44,151
USERS LOVE USING WECHAT AND

587
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,986
OTHERS.

588
00:22:45,986 --> 00:22:48,222
I THINK THERE IS NO CHANCE USERS

589
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:49,857
WOULD MIGRATE TO THEIR SERVICES

590
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:50,758
EVEN IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE.

591
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:54,695
EMILY: HOW ABOUT GOOGLE?

592
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:55,562
YOU KNOW THIS BETTER THAN ALMOST

593
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:57,531
ANYONE.

594
00:22:57,531 --> 00:23:00,568
GOOGLE'S OWN STRUGGLES IN CHINA.

595
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:01,402
DO YOU SEE GOOGLE EVERY COMING

596
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:02,903
BACK TO THE COVENANT -- EVER

597
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:04,205
COMING BACK TO THE COUNTRY?

598
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:08,275
>> THEY WILL HAVE TO TRY A

599
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,043
LITTLE HARDER THAN THE OTHER

600
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:09,843
COMPANIES BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT

601
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:12,613
CHOSE TO LEAVE.

602
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:13,447
GOOGLE HAS A VERY DIVERSIFIED

603
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:14,348
LINE OF PRODUCTS.

604
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:18,118
I THINK IT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

605
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:19,386
TAKE THE LEAST SENSITIVE

606
00:23:19,386 --> 00:23:22,122
PRODUCTS TO TRY TO LAND IN

607
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:24,592
CHINA.

608
00:23:24,592 --> 00:23:26,460
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT IS

609
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,295
HARDWARE-RELATED AND DOESN'T

610
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:31,098
HAVE TO DO WITH SOCIAL NETWORKS,

611
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:31,865
AND USER DATA OR CENSORSHIP.

612
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:33,501
EMILY: WHAT ABOUT THE SEARCH

613
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:34,335
ENGINE?

614
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:37,371
>> SEARCH ENGINE WILL BE A

615
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:39,406
LITTLE DIFFICULT.

616
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:42,109
GOOGLE PLEDGED NOT TO DO

617
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:45,045
CENSORSHIP.

618
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:45,879
THAT WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO

619
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:46,580
ENTER FOR THE TIME BEING.

620
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,648
EMILY: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

621
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:48,549
REVERSE.

622
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,552
WECHAT HAS HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN

623
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,420
CHINA BUT DIFFICULTY ENTERING

624
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,655
THE U.S. MARKET.

625
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:57,558
THEY HAVE 700 MILLION USERS.

626
00:23:57,558 --> 00:23:59,793
WHAT IS A LIKELIHOOD THEY WILL

627
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:01,028
BE ABLE TO MAKE THE REVERSE

628
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:01,895
HAPPEN AND BREAK INTO THE UNITED

629
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:02,530
STATES?

630
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,801
>> I THINK ALSO PRETTY LOW.

631
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,602
THERE ARE A FEW NOTABLE

632
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:10,671
EXCEPTIONS, BUT I WOULD THESE

633
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:13,007
THEM AS EXCEPTIONS.

634
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:13,741
THE BEST TEST FOR CHINESE

635
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:15,242
COMPANIES THAT WANT TO GO ABROAD

636
00:24:15,242 --> 00:24:17,511
ARE TO GO TO THE COUNTRIES THAT

637
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:18,679
ARE SIMILAR TO CHINA.

638
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,148
THAT IS COUNTRIES THAT ARE

639
00:24:21,148 --> 00:24:23,617
BECOMING WEALTHIER, DEVELOPING

640
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:25,853
COUNTRIES WITH LARGE

641
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:26,654
POPULATIONS, HIGHLY DENSE

642
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:29,656

643
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:30,724
TRY NEW THINGS.

644
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:33,761
COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA, INDONESIA,

645
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,796
BRAZIL.

646
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:37,698
EVEN THE MIDDLE EAST.

647
00:24:37,698 --> 00:24:42,336
IF I WERE A CHINESE ENTREPRENEUR

648
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:44,872
DECIDING TO GO ABROAD, THOSE OF

649
00:24:44,872 --> 00:24:45,940
THE COUNTRIES I WOULD FOCUS ON.

650
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,707
NOT THE UNITED STATES.

651
00:24:46,707 --> 00:24:50,811

755
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:53,734
BETTING ON.

756
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:58,605
KAI-FU: WE ARE FOCUSED ON

757
00:31:58,605 --> 00:31:59,740
SEVERAL THINGS.

758
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,542
ONE IS WE ARE STRONG BELIEVERS

759
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,678
IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, IN

760
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:07,614
CHANGING THE FUTURE OF CHINA

761
00:32:07,614 --> 00:32:08,849
ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

762
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:10,717
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLIES

763
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:13,887
TO BOTH TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES.

764
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:18,925
MAKING THINGS LIKE INSURANCE,

765
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:20,560
BANKING, HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS

766
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,530
BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AND

767
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,366
HELPING USERS GET MORE VALUE.

768
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:27,033
MAKE MORE MONEY FROM

769
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,001
INVESTMENTS.

770
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:31,104
GET YOUR DISEASE TREATED MORE

771
00:32:31,104 --> 00:32:32,172
EFFICACIOUSLY.

772
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:35,309
LEARNING MORE IN SCHOOL.

773
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:36,142
CHINA HAS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF

774
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:37,210
DATA THAT CAN BE MINED.

775
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,044
WE THINK THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO

776
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:40,981
USE AI ON BIG DATA.

777
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:42,549
WE ALSO BELIEVE IN AI

778
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:44,985
APPLICATIONS IN BUILDING

779
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:47,154
COMPUTERS THAT CAN SEE, HEAR AND

780
00:32:47,154 --> 00:32:49,323
UNDERSTAND.

781
00:32:49,323 --> 00:32:50,156
A COUPLE OF INDUSTRIES WE THINK

782
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:51,925
ARE VERY EXCITING ARE THE

783
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:54,094
SECURITIES INDUSTRY FOR

784
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:57,264
COMMERCIAL HOME, AS WELL AS

785
00:32:57,264 --> 00:32:58,098
GOVERNMENT.

786
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:01,201
WE THINK ROBOTICS IS VERY

787
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:04,838
EXCITING, ESPECIALLY FOR CERTAIN

788
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:06,706
VERTICAL SEGMENTS OF THE HOME

789
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:08,975
SUCH AS WATCHING YOUNG KIDS AND

790
00:33:08,975 --> 00:33:10,210
OLDER PEOPLE.

791
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,945
WE ALSO THINK ROBOTICS AND

792
00:33:11,945 --> 00:33:14,147
COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS, LIKE

793
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:16,316
THE AMAZON T THE IS VERY

794
00:33:16,316 --> 00:33:19,486
EXCITING FOR THE MANUFACTURING

795
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:20,587
ECONOMY LIKE CHINA.

796
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:21,421
THESE ARE PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST

797
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:23,423
INVESTMENT THINGS IN CHINA.

798
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:26,026
WE LOOK AT ENTERPRISE SERVICES,

799
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:28,361
WHICH IS NOW FLEDGLING THE

800
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:29,463
STARTING TO TAKE OFF.

801
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:34,701
WE LOOK AT THE CREATION OF GREAT

802
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:35,402
CONTENT AND RECREATION AND

803
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:35,902
ENTERTAINMENT.

804
00:33:35,902 --> 00:33:37,571
THE NEXT STAGE BEYOND MOBILE

805
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:40,841
GAMES IN CHINA.

806
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:41,675
WE THINK THAT IS A BIG AREA AS

807
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:42,042
WELL.

808
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:45,445
EMILY: WE HAVE TOUCHED ON THIS.

809
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:47,547
PART OF THE REASON IT IS

810
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,348
DIFFICULT FOR U.S. COMPANIES TO

811
00:33:48,348 --> 00:33:50,550
EXPAND IN CHINA OR FOR CHINESE

812
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,284
COMPANIES TO EXPAND IN THE

813
00:33:51,284 --> 00:33:53,386
UNITED STATES, ARE THERE

814
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:54,554
CULTURAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS?

815
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:56,523
IS IT REGULATORY ISSUES?

816
00:33:56,523 --> 00:34:01,495
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST COMMON

817
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:04,598
THINGS AND REGIONS AND

818
00:34:04,598 --> 00:34:05,398
RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE U.S.

819
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:06,199
AND CHINA AT THIS LEVEL, THE

820
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:08,735
INVESTING LEVEL, THE

821
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:09,536
ENTREPRENEURIAL LEVEL FAIL?

822
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,806
KAI-FU: IF YOU'RE A CHINESE

823
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:13,572
ENTREPRENEUR THAT WANTS TO

824
00:34:13,572 --> 00:34:15,542
PROMOTE HIS APPLICATION AND THE

825
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,344
U.S., YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF

826
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:19,946
FACEBOOK BEFORE.

827
00:34:19,946 --> 00:34:20,614
HOW DO YOU DO FACEBOOK

828
00:34:20,614 --> 00:34:22,815
PROMOTIONS?

829
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:23,617
WHAT DO YOU USE TO DISTRIBUTE

830
00:34:23,617 --> 00:34:25,585
YOUR APP?

831
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:28,822
10 DIFFERENT APP STORES.

832
00:34:28,822 --> 00:34:29,623
THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS TO GET

833
00:34:29,623 --> 00:34:31,690
YOUR APPS TO THE TOP IN THOSE

834
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,060
STORES.

835
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,893
BUT A GOOGLE PLAY, IT IS OWNED

836
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:36,329
BY ONE COMPANY THAT IS VERY

837
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:37,731
STRICT PRINCIPLES OF HOW TO

838
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:39,632
OPERATE.

839
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:43,069
IN CHINA IF YOU ARE DOING A

840
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:45,804
SECURITY APPLICATION, YOU JUST

841
00:34:45,804 --> 00:34:46,572
GO AND SELL TO THE PROVINCIAL

842
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:47,007
GOVERNMENT.

843
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:48,708
IN THE U.S. THE OPPORTUNITIES

844
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:52,978
ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

845
00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:54,947
YOU HAVE TO NOT ONLY BE FULLY

846
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:57,250
CUMBERSOME WITH THE AMERICAN

847
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,018
BUSINESS, BUT DROP ALL YOUR

848
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:58,618
PRACTICES IN CHINA.

849
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:01,788
THE REVERSE IS THE EXACT SAME.

850
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:03,556
ALSO ON TOP OF THAT, YOU ARE

851
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:06,760
DEALING WITH VERY AGGRESSIVE

852
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,830
PEER COMPETITIVE ENTREPRENEURS.

853
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,734
YOU ARE DEALING WITH VC'S THAT

854
00:35:14,734 --> 00:35:15,502
WILL QUICKLY GIVE YOU A LOT OF

855
00:35:15,502 --> 00:35:16,269
MONEY BUT A LOT OF PRESSURE.

856
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:19,205
YOU ARE DEALING WITH COMPETITORS

857
00:35:19,205 --> 00:35:22,642
WHO MAY NOT FOLLOW THE SAME

858
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:25,045
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND MAY

859
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:27,047
CREATE PR NIGHTMARES FOR YOU.

860
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:27,781
YOU ARE DEALING WITH VERY

861
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:28,949
DIFFERENT THAT'S OF GOVERNMENT

862
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:29,749
REGULATIONS.

863
00:35:29,749 --> 00:35:33,720
-- SET OF GOVERNMENT

864
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,088
REGULATIONS.

865
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:36,022
AT GOOGLE I HAD TO DEFEND THE

866
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:37,891
COMPANY.

867
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:39,626
WE WERE A MONTH LATE WITH SOME

868
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:42,896
TAX PAYMENTS AND WE BECAME

869
00:35:42,896 --> 00:35:45,866
HEADLINE ABOUT BEING TAX

870
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:52,005
EVASION AND BEING PROSECUTED.

871
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:55,041
WE HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH SEARCH

872
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:59,713
TERMS AND THOSE WERE BLOWN UP AS

873
00:35:59,713 --> 00:36:04,084
A PRO-JAPANESE SEARCH.

874
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:06,152
IN THE SINO JAPANESE WAR

875
00:36:06,152 --> 00:36:06,987
ANNIVERSARY.

876
00:36:06,987 --> 00:36:09,723
THESE ARE RIDICULOUS,

877
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:13,026
OUTLANDISH, FABRICATED RUMORS

878
00:36:13,026 --> 00:36:15,161
CREATED BY PERHAPS OUR

879
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:15,962
COMPETITORS ARE PEOPLE THAT DID

880
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:17,564
NOT LIKE US.

881
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:18,398
THEY WERE SPREAD OUT EVERYWHERE

882
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:18,932
IN HEADLINES.

883
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:21,301
VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN CLARIFY

884
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,235
OURSELVES.

885
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:25,004
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF ISSUES

886
00:36:25,004 --> 00:36:25,672
THAT MAKES IT EXTREMELY

887
00:36:25,672 --> 00:36:26,206
DIFFICULT.

888
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:29,609
I WOULD GENERALLY ADVISE

889
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:32,178
AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS TO FIND A

890
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:33,079
PARTNER IN CHINA IF YOU WANT TO

891
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,050
GO TO CHINA, AND THE SAME OF THE

892
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,751
CHINESE PARTNER TO FIND AN

893
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:38,318
AMERICAN PARTNER.

894
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:41,454
SET UP AN ARRANGEMENT WHERE

895
00:36:41,454 --> 00:36:42,122
THERE IS AN ALIGNMENT OF

896
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:43,256
INTERESTS.

897
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:46,459
MAYBE LET THEM INVEST IN YOU AND

898
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:47,227
LET THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THEIR

899
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:51,164
HOME COUNTRY TAKE THE

900
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:52,031
DECISION-MAKING RESPONSIBILITY

901
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:56,202
AND DRIVE YOUR COMPANY FORWARD

902
00:36:56,202 --> 00:36:56,970
IN THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY

903
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,437
UNDERSTAND.

904
00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:59,639
DON'T TRY THIS YOURSELF.

905
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,573
DON'T THINK YOU CAN HIRE SOMEONE

906
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:03,577
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

907
00:37:03,577 --> 00:37:04,444
THERE ARE MANY CASUALTIES BEFORE

908
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:07,814
YOU AMONG THE GREAT COMPANIES

909
00:37:07,814 --> 00:37:09,382

WHY WOULDN'T REGULATORS TRY TO

944
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:45,131
HOLD OF THIS DEAL?

945
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:45,932
PETER: IT IS A GOOD QUESTION.

946
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:49,702
THE TWO COMPANIES WILL PROBABLY

947
00:40:49,702 --> 00:40:51,971
END UP WITH MORE THAN 90% OF THE

948
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:53,206
RIGHT HAILING MARKET.

949
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:55,208
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FACTORS IN

950
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,209
CHINA THAT WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO

951
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:57,143
THIS DEAL BEING APPROVED BY

952
00:40:57,143 --> 00:40:59,312
REGULATORS.

953
00:40:59,312 --> 00:41:00,146
A BIG PART IS THIS INDUSTRY IS

954
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:02,315
SO NEW AT THIS POINT IT IS NOT

955
00:41:02,315 --> 00:41:03,149
CLEAR THAT THEIR COMPETITION IS

956
00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:05,318
GOING TO BE.

957
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:07,320
DEFENDING ON HOW YOU DEFINE THE

958
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,589
MARKET YOU CAN SEE LOTS OF

959
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:10,423
COMPETITION AND DECIDED WITHOUT

960
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:12,158
MUCH COMPETITION.

961
00:41:12,158 --> 00:41:13,793
ONE OF THE THINGS OUR SOURCES

962
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:15,928
TELL US IS IT IS EASY TO DEFINE

963
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:17,830
THIS MARKET MORE BROADLY AS

964
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:21,200
TRANSPORTATION IN GENERAL, IN

965
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,868
WHICH CASE THERE ARE OTHER

966
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:22,535
COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE

967
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:23,269
TRANSPORTATION IN ADDITION TO

968
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:25,171
DIDI AND THE COMBINED UBER.

969
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:28,241
NOT INCIDENTALLY YOU HAVE A

970
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:30,243
CHINESE COMPANY BUYING ONE OF

971
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:31,010
THE FORWARD COMPANIES THAT IS

972
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,345
BEEN COMPETING WITH THEM

973
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:32,912
IMPRESSIVELY.

974
00:41:32,912 --> 00:41:36,315
IT IS A GOOD CHANCE REGULATORS

975
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:37,016
WILL GIVE THIS APPROVAL.

976
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:40,453
EMILY: DO YOU THINK THE

977
00:41:40,453 --> 00:41:41,187
ANTI-MONOPOLY BOARD IN CHINA

978
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:41,854
WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?

979
00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:45,024
AREN'T THEY REQUIRED TO COME IN

980
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,593
UNDER OUR DEALS INVOLVING

981
00:41:46,593 --> 00:41:47,427
COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN $60

982
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:48,328
MILLION IN REVENUE?

983
00:41:48,328 --> 00:41:50,430
WHICH YOU WOULD ASSUME DIDI

984
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,733
MAKES.

985
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:54,500
PETER: DEPENDS ON HOW THEY

986
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,569
DEFINED THE REVENUE AND HOW THEY

987
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:57,837
REPORT THAT REVENUE.

988
00:41:57,837 --> 00:41:58,671
REGULATORS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT

989
00:41:58,671 --> 00:41:59,539
THIS.

990
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:02,709
IT IS TOO HIGH PROFILE DEAL.

991
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:03,476
IT INVOLVES THERE HE HIGH

992
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:04,477
PROFILE NAMES IN THE COUNTRY.

993
00:42:04,477 --> 00:42:06,412
THEY WILL LOOK AT IT.

994
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:08,347
ONE OF THE REGULATORS SAID THEY

995
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:13,686
DID MADE -- THEY DO NEED TO MAKE

996
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:14,854
AN APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL.

997
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:15,655
THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE WILL

998
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:16,589
LOOK AT IT.

999
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:18,558
THE ANTI-MONOPOLY BUREAU.

1000
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:22,428
CHINA IS A COMPA -- COUNTRY

1001
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:23,329
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS USED TO

1002
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:26,733
REGULATING BIG COMPANIES.

1003
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:28,968
IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE UNITED

1004
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:29,669
STATES WHEN IT WITH THEIR

1005
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:30,436
FREEWHEELING COMPETITION IN THE

1006
00:42:30,436 --> 00:42:32,205
PRIVATE SECTOR.

1007
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:32,939
THE GOVERNMENT IS MORE

1008
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:33,606
COMFORTABLE REGULATING

1009
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:34,340
BUSINESSES ONCE THEY GET A BIG

1010
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,675
SHARE OF THE MARKET.

1011
00:42:35,675 --> 00:42:38,111
YOU CAN SEE A REGULATOR APPROVED

1012
00:42:38,111 --> 00:42:38,811
THE DEAL AND WATCH PRICING

1013
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:41,013
CLOSELY TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE

1014
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:43,082
TRYING TO GALS CONSUMERS.

1015
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:43,950
INDICATES -- THEN THERE COULD BE

1016
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,484
SOME ACTION.

1017
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:48,121
EMILY: TALK ABOUT THE ROLE

1018
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:49,889
SUBSIDIES PLAY IN THE MARKET.

1019
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:51,891
PETER: THE TWO COMPANIES WERE

1020
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:54,694
QUITE VOCAL ABOUT THE FACT THAT

1021
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:55,628
ONE REASON FOR THIS MERGER IS

1022
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:57,864
THEY WERE SUBSIDIZING THEIR

1023
00:42:57,864 --> 00:42:58,998
BUSINESSES SO MUCH.

1024
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:00,633
THEY WERE OFFERING SUBSIDIES

1025
00:43:00,633 --> 00:43:03,970
BOTH TO RIDERS AND DRIVERS.

1026
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:07,273
RIDERS SO THEY WOULD TRY THE

1027
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:08,141
SERVICES AND TAKE THAT INSTEAD

1028
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:10,176
OF A CAB OR PUBLIC

1029
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:11,344
TRANSPORTATION.

1030
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:12,178
AND THE DRIVERS WOULD COME ON

1031
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:14,847
BOARD AND GIVE UBER MORE DRIVERS

1032
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:18,051
IN A CERTAIN AREA OR D MORE

1033
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:23,523
DRIVERS -- DIDI MORE DRIVERS.

1034
00:43:23,523 --> 00:43:24,357
ALSO REGULATORS HAVE, AND SAID

1035
00:43:24,357 --> 00:43:26,859
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A MARKET

1036
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:27,627
DRIVEN LARGELY BY SUBSIDIES.

1037
00:43:27,627 --> 00:43:28,995
THEY SEE THAT AS A DISTORTION OF

1038
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:30,263
THE MARKET.

1039
00:43:30,263 --> 00:43:35,234
THEY COULD PULL RIDERS AWAY FROM

1040
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:36,035
A WHILE AND CAPITAL FROM AREAS

1041
00:43:36,035 --> 00:43:36,802
THAT ARE MORE SUSTAINABLE FROM A

1042
00:43:36,802 --> 00:43:37,336
PROFIT STANDPOINT.

1043
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:40,273
EMILY: PETER L STREMME FROM

1044
00:43:40,273 --> 00:43:42,441

1045
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:43,343
UPDATE.

THEY HAVE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT

THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND

1071
00:44:33,426 --> 00:44:34,260
HOW THEY ARE COMPETITIVE TO UBER
