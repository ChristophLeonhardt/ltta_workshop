"THE FIVE" ."

00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:08,481
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN JUST

3
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:10,649
RELEASED A CAMPAIGN AD DISGUISED

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,386
AS A DNA TEST OR MAYBE IT WAS A

5
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:15,888
DNA TEST DISGUISED AS A CAMPAIGN

6
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:17,289
AD.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,824
SHE LADLES HER DNA RESULTS WITH

8
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,760
SOME RELATIVES IN MUSIC AND

9
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:21,527
INCLUDES ME.

10
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:22,528
I AM TOUCHED.

11
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,764
THAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME I TAKE

12
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:26,665
THE SUBWAY.

13
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,900
>> I HEAR SOME OF YOU ARE

14
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:28,901
REPUBLICANS.

15
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:31,137
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM CALLING

16
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:32,104
HER POCAHONTAS?

17
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:33,706
>> I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.

18
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:35,741
>> I THINK IT'S SILLY.

19
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:38,277
>> Greg: WHAT DOES WARREN

20
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:39,945
TRANSLATE INTO CHEROKEE AS?

21
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:42,915
>> SEGMENTS OF NATIVE AMERICAN

22
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:47,353
AND ANCESTRY.

23
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:49,288
>> THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO CALL

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,924
MY MOM A LIAR.

25
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,893
WHAT DO THE FACTS SAY?

26
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:55,895
>> THE FACTS SUGGEST YOU

27
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,563
ABSOLUTELY HAVE NATIVE AMERICAN

28
00:00:57,564 --> 00:00:59,732
ANCESTRY IN YOUR PEDIGREE.

29
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:01,534
>> Greg: HER NATIVE AMERICAN

30
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:04,069
ANCESTRY MAY DATE BACK SIX TO

31
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,375
TEN GENERATIONS.

32
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,977
POTENTIALLY 11,000 -- USING SUCH

33
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:15,047
STANDARDS, I AM ASIAN WHICH

34
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:18,517
IS WHY I CAN'T GET INTO HARVARD.

35
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:19,952
NO WONDER SHE HAD TO RELY ON

36
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:23,322
SENTIMENT AND VICTIMHOOD.

37
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:25,224
THIS ISN'T ABOUT HISTORY BUT HER

38
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,525
STORY AND FIXING IT BECAUSE IT'S

39
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:27,026
A MESS.

40
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:28,861
DID SHE OR DID NOT LIST YOURSELF

41
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:30,496
AS A MINORITY IN LAW SCHOOL

42
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:31,297
DIRECTORIES WHEN IT SUITED HER

43
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:33,766
AND THEN REMOVED IT WHEN HE

44
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:34,300
DIDN'T?

45
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:35,935
IT'S NOT ABOUT HER BACKGROUND.

46
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,136
IT'S ABOUT CHEATING.

47
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:38,904
SHE IS A WHITE WOMAN OF VAST

48
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:40,139
EUROPEAN ANCESTRY WHO WENT TO

49
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,941
THE BUFFET OF IDENTITY POLITICS

50
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:43,375
AND TOOK SECONDS AND THIRDS.

51
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:44,276
WARREN IS NATIVE AMERICAN

52
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:46,145
BECAUSE SHE SAID SO.

53
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,314
SHE WINS THE 2018 RACHEL DALZIEL

54
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:48,614
AWARD.

55
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:52,117
SO IF WE ALL DO THE SAME TEST IS

56
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:53,719
HERS AND FIND SIMILAR

57
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,321
PERCENTAGES, AREN'T WE ALSO

58
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:55,955
ELIGIBLE TO CLAIM THE

59
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:58,491
EXPERIENCES OF AN OPPRESSED

60
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:00,326
GROUP AND THEIR PAST GRIEVANCES?

61
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:01,660
HER RESULTS BECOME THE STANDARD

62
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,996
FOR ANYONE CHOOSING A PATH THAT

63
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:07,500
OFFERS AN EDGE, WHO CAN SKIP

64
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,535
AHEAD IN ADMISSIONS WERE JOBS IN

65
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,336
PLACES WHERE DIVERSITY TRUMPS

66
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:12,338
EXPERIENCE AND SO DNA TEST

67
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:13,539
BECOME THE NEW AFFIRMATIVE

68
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,139
ACTION.

69
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,908
AT WHOSE EXPENSE?

70
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:17,843
MAYBE NO ONE BECAUSE IF WE ARE

71
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:19,445
ALL A LITTLE OPPRESSED, WE ARE

72
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:20,746
ALL GOOD.

73
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:21,947
GOODBYE, IDENTITY POLITICS.

74
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:23,148
IF EVERYONE IS A MINORITY, THEN

75
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:25,351
NOBODY IS.

76
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:26,752
THERE'S A SILVER LINING.

77
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,587
I THINK SHE DID THE NATION A

78
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:28,921
SERVICE.

79
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,823
WE ARE ALL NATIVE AMERICAN.

80
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:33,559
INTERESTING FACT FROM MICHAEL

81
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,527
AARON, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

82
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:38,364
THE G.O.P. SPOKESMAN.

83
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:39,532
"NEW YORK TIMES" SOURCING.

84
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:41,634
THE AVERAGE EUROPEAN-AMERICAN'S

85
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:42,535
.18.

86
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:43,869
THE AVERAGE EUROPEAN-AMERICAN IS

87
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,603
ACTUALLY MORE NATIVE AMERICAN

88
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:46,939
THAN SHE IS.

89
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,210
DID THIS BACKFIRE?

90
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:52,344
>> Dana: A LITTLE BIT.

91
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:53,879
A LOT OF THE MEDIA WERE TREATING

92
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,614
THIS AS HER RESPONSE TO TRUMPET

93
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:56,882
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GET

94
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:59,919
THROUGH DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY AND I

95
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,054
IMAGINE IF IT GOT DOWN TO THE

96
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:02,988
TOP TEN THAT HER OPPONENTS WERE

97
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,157
GOING TO USE THIS --

98
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:06,559
DONALD TRUMP WASN'T GOING TO

99
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,526
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

100
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:08,527
I THINK SHE'S OVERREACTING A

101
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:09,228
LITTLE BIT.

102
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,763
DO YOUR POINT, SHE'S NEVER HAD

103
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:12,998
TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.

104
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,301
WHY DID SHE NOT LISTED WHEN SHE

105
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:17,803
WAS APPLYING TO LOWER TIER

106
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:18,137
SCHOOLS?

107
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:20,039
ONLY LISTED IT WHEN SHE APPLIED

108
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,140
TO THE HIGHER TIER SCHOOLS AND

109
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:22,575
THEN DID NOT LIST IT AFTER SHE

110
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,143
HAD TENURE.

111
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:26,912
THAT'S THE PART -- EVEN IF YOU

112
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:28,314
ARE NATIVE AMERICAN, WHY DID YOU

113
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:29,048
LISTED WHEN YOU ONLY THOUGHT IT

114
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,350
WAS GOING TO HELP YOU GET AN

115
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:32,318
EDGE?

116
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,352
>> Greg: GOOD POINTS.

117
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:34,453
JUAN, IS THIS ABOUT TRUMP OR THE

118
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,755
PEOPLE SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO

119
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:37,356
FACE BEFORE TRUMP?

120
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:39,725
>> Juan: IT WAS ABOUT THE

121
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:40,559
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TRUMP

122
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,894
ATTACK, CALLING HER POCAHONTAS

123
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,162
AND RIDICULING HER IN THAT WAY

124
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,130
SO I THINK SHE WANTED TO

125
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:45,464
RESPOND.

126
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:47,533
NOW I THINK IT'S LIKE JIU-JITSU.

127
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:48,167
SHE THINKS SHE'S PUT THE

128
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:49,969
PRESSURE ON TRUMP.

129
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,706
THE KEY THING HERE FOR ME IS

130
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:55,574
THAT WHEN THE PAPERS ASK THE

131
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,710
FOLKS AT HARVARD, DID YOU INFECT

132
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:58,744
CONSIDER THIS WHEN YOU HIRED

133
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:01,313
HER, THEY SAID NO.

134
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:02,014
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, I

135
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:04,750
THINK THEY SAID AT THE

136
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:05,517
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THEY

137
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:07,152
FILLED OUT A FORM EXPLAINING WHY

138
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,722
THEY HIRED A WHITE WOMAN OVER

139
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:10,356
MINORITY PEOPLE.

140
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:12,324
THE WHOLE BASIS, THE FOUNDATION

141
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:13,826
OF THE TRUMP ATTACK WAS "YOU USE

142
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:16,128
THIS TO GET AHEAD FALSELY."

143
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,464
IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE, IN

144
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,164
ADDITION TO WHICH SHE HAS SOME

145
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,334
NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTRY.

146
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,636
>> Greg:        >> Katie: I WOUD

147
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:23,669
>> Greg:        >> Katie: I WOUS

148
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,702
>> Greg:        >> Katie: I WOUG

149
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:23,736
>> Greg:        >> Katie: I WOUE

150
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:25,337
>> Greg:        >> Katie: I WOU.

151
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:27,706
IN 1997, FORDHAM UNIVERSITY, THE

152
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:28,607
LOWER VIEW DESCRIBES WARREN AS

153
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:32,244
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL FIRST WOMAN

154
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:32,745
OF COLOR.

155
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,713
THEY HAD THAT CEMENTED IN THEIR

156
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:35,514
LEGACY.

157
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,149
THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THIS TODAY

158
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,651
LOOKING AT THIS, THE WAY THE

159
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:40,052
MEDIA REACTED CALMLY FOR REALLY

160
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,420
LOOKING AT THE STUDYING GOING

161
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:44,323
THROUGH THE NUMBERS, IT WAS

162
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,724
WARREN VERIFIES THAT SHE'S

163
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:46,759
NATIVE AMERICAN.

164
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,559
"THE BOSTON GLOBE" GOES THROUGH

165
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,460
A SERIES OF CORRECTIONS BECAUSE

166
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,763
FIRST THEY WERE SAYING IT WAS

167
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:51,163
1:30 SECOND.

168
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:53,932
THEN THEY GO ALL THE WAY TO

169
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,434
CORRECTING IT DUE TO A MATH

170
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:59,104
ERROR AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE

171
00:04:59,105 --> 00:04:59,905
IN 1,024.

172
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:01,674
GOING DOWN THE LINE OF THE

173
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,342
IMPOSSIBILITIES OF THE POINT YOU

174
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:05,377
BROUGHT UP IN THE SENSE THAT

175
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:06,545
SHE'S LESS NATIVE AMERICAN THAN

176
00:05:06,546 --> 00:05:09,048
THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS.

177
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:12,785
>> Juan: DO YOU THINK SHE IS

178
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,453
OWED A MILLION BUCKS BY TRUMP?

179
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:15,621
>> Greg: I WOULD SAY I THINK

180
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:17,523
IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR

181
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:18,190
DONALD TRUMP TO DONATE THAT

182
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,926
MONEY, WRITE IT OFF.

183
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:22,628
AND THEN THANK HER FOR -- HE

184
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:27,433
POINTS OUT EVERYONE IN AMERICA

185
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,133
IS NATIVE AMERICAN.

186
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:29,134
SHE HAS DONE A SERVICE.

187
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:31,637
THANK YOU FOR DOING THE WORK FOR

188
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:32,771
ME.

189
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:35,207
>> Pete: I CAN SEE THE

190
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,842
CAMPAIGN T-SHIRTS.

191
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:37,743
"I AM BLACK."

192
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:40,379
"I AM HISPANIC."

193
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:52,291
"I AM JEWISH."

194
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:52,658
WHATEVER.

195
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,258
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE.

196
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:53,692
TO YOUR POINT.

197
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:54,426
IT'S EXPLOITING MINORITY STATUS.

198
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:55,127
SHE DID IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN

199
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:55,761
WITH THE PRESIDENT DID WAS

200
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:56,462
DEVASTATINGLY LAY OUT HOW SHE

201
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:57,896
USED IT FOR OWN ADVANTAGE

202
00:05:57,897 --> 00:06:00,232
CONTINUES TO USE IT FOR OWN

203
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:00,632
ADVANTAGE.

204
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:04,103
AND NOW SHE THINKS SHE'S GETTING

205
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:04,903
AHEAD OF IT.

206
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:06,705
NO, SHE'S CREATING MORE OF A

207
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:07,840
PROBLEM FOR HERSELF.

208
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:09,108
SHE CAN'T GET PAST IT.

209
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,943
THIS WILL MAKE IT WORSE.

210
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:12,945
>> Dana: TERRIBLE POLITICAL

211
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,313
TIMING.

212
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:16,515
22 DAYS UNTIL THE MIDTERM

213
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:16,915
ELECTION.

214
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,417
DEMOCRATS LOSING GROUND WITH

215
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:19,818
MANY REPUBLICANS BUT THEY HAVE

216
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,853
AN EDGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE

217
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:22,955
HOUSE, NOT THE SENATE.

218
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:23,922
THEY HAVE ALL THIS MONEY.

219
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,257
THEY COULD'VE USED ALL DAY

220
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:26,358
TODAY, ALL THIS WEEK THEY

221
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:30,129
COULD'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT.

222
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,530
SHE HAD TO RELEASE IT TODAY?

223
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:34,500
WHY NOT DO IT THE DAY AFTER

224
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:34,867
ELECTION?

225
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:40,773
MOST OF THE DEMOCRATS -- OBAMA'S

226
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:41,406
COMMUNICATIONS PERSON WAS

227
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,308
PULLING HIS HAIR OUT SAYING WHY

228
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:44,743
WOULD YOU DO THIS TODAY?

229
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:48,213
DOESN'T HELP ANY OF THE

230
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:51,116
DEMOCRATS.

231
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:53,218
THIS STORY ABOUT THE DNA TEST

232
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:54,553
CAME THE DAY AFTER A

233
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:55,721
"WASHINGTON POST" STORY ABOUT

234
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:57,523
HOW GREAT SHE'S BEEN, ALL OF

235
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,124
THESE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.

236
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,592
ONCE THEY WIN THEIR PRIMARIES,

237
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:02,728
SHE'S THERE WITH A PHONE CALL OF

238
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:03,762
SUPPORT AND MONEY.

239
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:04,563
SHE'S DOING A LOT TO TRY TO

240
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:05,397
BUILD UP A LOT OF SUPPORT WITHIN

241
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:07,933
THE PARTY AND THEN SHE DOES

242
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:08,500
THIS.

243
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,234
>> Katie: SHE'S HAVING SERIOUS

244
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,336
PROBLEMS ON THE LEFT.

245
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:13,438
IF SHE THINKS THIS IS GOING TO

246
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,541
HELP HER BY CLAIMING THE

247
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:16,742
UNSUBSTANTIATED EVIDENCE THAT

248
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:18,844
SHE HAS MINORITY STATUS, ON THE

249
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,946
LEFT, IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE

250
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:31,023
INTRODUCTION---

251
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:33,492
INTERSECTIONALITY.

252
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:34,193
THERE'S THIS EVIDENCE IN LOWER

253
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:37,129
VIEWS THAT YOU ARE CHOSEN ON THE

254
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,264
FACT THAT YOUR NAME WAS LISTED

255
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:40,299
AS A MINORITY PROFESSOR BEFORE

256
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,134
YOU GOT TO HARVARD LAW.

257
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,135
SHE HAS PROBLEMS ON BOTH SIDES

258
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:44,136
OF THE AISLE.

259
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,505
IN THE PRIMARY FOR 2020 AND IN A

260
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:48,740

>> Juan: FROM THE DEMOCRATS'

262
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:50,976
PERSPECTIVE, I DON'T THINK YOU

263
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:54,847
ARE RIGHT.

264
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:55,948
>> Dana: I WAS QUOTING JIM

>> Juan: HE WAS SAYING TIMING

267
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,017
MIGHT BE AN ISSUE BUT NOT ALL OF

268
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:01,720
THIS OF PILING ON.

269
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:03,322
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING, TO MY

270
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:05,290
MIND, WHAT COMES OUT IS HERE'S

271
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:09,261
ANOTHER TRUMP FALLACY.

POCAHONTAS, HE LIKES TO RIDICULE

273
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:11,663
PEOPLE.

274

>> Pete: 1% CONSTITUTES AN

275
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,134
ETHNIC BACKGROUND?

00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:17,202
>> Juan: HER FAMILY HISTORY

277
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:20,706
WAS THAT HER GREAT-GRANDMOTHER

278
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:21,440
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER --

279
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:23,642
>> Greg: AND SHE LIED ABOUT IT

280
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:24,042
ANYWAY.

00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:26,245
>> Juan: TOLD HER --

282
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:27,346

283
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,081
TELL A FOLKTALE ABOUT MY MOTHER

284
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:29,781
AND THEN PRETEND IT'S TRUE.

285
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,250
>> Juan: I'M SAYING THAT WAS

286
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,718
HER FAMILY STORY.

287
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,719
SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

288
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,187

289
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:38,223
>> Greg: MY 23 AND ME HAS ME

ACTUALLY MORE THAN HER, SO I AM

292
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:44,930
WELCOMING HER TO MY FAMILY.

293
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,133
TO THE POINT, IT'S A BIGGER

294
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:51,136
POINT, IS THIS THE NEXT STEP IN

295
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:52,704
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?

296
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:53,138
DNA TESTING?

YOU HAVE TO SEND IN YOUR

303
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:02,581

304
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:05,150
I AM 1% ALBANIAN, REMEMBER THAT?

305
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:06,585
>> Katie: I WAS TOO SCARED.

306
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,754
I WAS ABOUT TO DO THAT TEST THAT

307
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:10,389
WAS SITTING THERE FOR A YEAR AND

308
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,723
I GOT FREAKED OUT READING THE

00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:14,626
TERMS OF SERVICE AND PUT IT BAC

310
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:14,927

IDENTITY POLITICS OF THE TABLE,

BUT IF YOU ARE APPLYING, YOU

314
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:21,800
REALLY WANT TO BE WHITE

315
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,168
UPPER-CLASS.

316
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,870

00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:25,337
INTO HARVARD.

318
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:26,004
>> Juan: HARVARD SAID THAT'S

319
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:30,075
NOT TRUE.

320
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:30,709
I AM SAYING UNIVERSITY OF

BUT IT DIDN'T IMPACT YOUR

00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:39,751
ABILITY.

327
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:41,186
>> Greg: WE ARE PROBABLY GOING

328
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:43,922
TO SEE HOW HARVARD REALLY THINKS

00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:45,123
IN THIS ASIAN DISCRIMINATION

330
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:45,424
