could make history. What's in your wallet? Tucker: WE ARE CONTINUING OUR EXTENDED CONVERSATION WITH CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL, DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT RUSSIA BUT YOU ALSO BECOME KNOWN FOR YOUR POSITION ON GUNS AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE VERY FEW DEMOCRATS I THINK WHO HAS BEEN HONEST ABOUT THAT. YOU SAY THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO BAN A CERTAIN SPECIES OF RIFLE, YOU WROTE A PIECE ABOUT THIS. THIS IS NOT A SECRET OF VIEW THIS IS NOT A SECRET OF VIEWO HAVE. IF YOU SAY THIS. MILITARY STYLE SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS. WE SHOULD BUY BACK SUCH WEAPONS FROM ALL WHO CHOOSE TO ABIDE BY THE LAW AND WE SHOULD CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE ANY WHO CHOOSE TO DEFY IT BY KEEPING THEIR WEAPONS. SO WE SHOULD CONFISCATE? THIS ENTIRE CLASS OF FIREARMS. WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRIED TO DO THAT? DID YOU READ THE OP-ED? Tucker: I JUST QUOTED IT EXTENSIVELY. I'M NOT CALLING FOR CONFISCATION GRID WE SHOULD INVEST IN A BUYBACK. RESTRICT ANY WEAPONS THAT AREN'T BROUGHT BACK TO HER GUN CLUBS, HUNTING CLUBS, SHOOTING RANGES. KEEP THEM THERE WHERE IT'S SAFE, NOT ON OUR STREETS, AND IF YOU ARE CAUGHT, JUST LIKE IF YOU WERE CAUGHT WITH DRUGS OR ANYTHING ELSE, THEY HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE TO GO INTO YOUR HOME AND YOU HAD ONE OF THESE WEAPONS, I'M NEVER SUGGESTING SENDING TROOPS OUT. Tucker: CONGRESSMAN FROM CALIFORNIA. CAN YOU PUT THIS BACK ON THE SCREEN PLEASE? I'M GOING TO QUOTE ONCE AGAIN. AND WE SHOULD BUY BACK THOSE WEAPONS, AND I'M QUOTING, CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE ANY WHO REFUSE WOULD CHOOSE TO DEFY IT BY KEEPING THEIR WEAPONS." IF YOU'RE GOING TO PROSECUTE PEOPLE WHO DON'T GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS. IF THEY ARE CAUGHT WITH THEM DURING I'M NOT SENDING TROOPS DOOR-TO-DOOR. Tucker: WHAT YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN? THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE LAW-ABIDING, HAVE COMMITTED NO CRIME, NO PLANS TO COMMIT A CRIME. HE WOULD INSTANTLY TURN THEM INTO FAMILIES. DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE A CIVIL WAR, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT? WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN IF WE DO NOTHING? WOULD DO YOU MARKETS WILL BE KILLED? MORE CHURCHES WILL LOSE PARISHIONERS? Tucker: I'M CRITIQUING YOUR VERY SPECIFIC SUGGESTION, AND YOU ARE A LAWMAKER SO THIS IS MEANINGFUL, WHAT YOU SAID. I TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LAW-ABIDING, THAT THEIR WEAPONS COULD BE BOUGHT BACK OR KEEP THEM AT A GUN CLUB. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP BUT KEEP THEM AT A GUN CLUB. Tucker: YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY AND YOU JUST MADE THEM INTO FELONS. THERE'S NO TROOP ROUND UP HERE. Tucker: YOU JUST MADE THEM INTO FELONS. YOU JUST SAID THAT IN THE PIECE. I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP, YOU WROTE THAT. IF I'M A GUN OWNER AND I HAVE ONE OF THE WEAPONS YOU SAY SHOULD BE BANNED AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE BRINGING IT TO A GUN CLUB, I FEEL LIKE KEEPING IT IN MY BEDROOM CLOSET. I DON'T THINK YOU ARE GIVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ONE OF CREDIT THAT THEY WILL BE LAW-ABIDING. Tucker: THAT THEY WOULD OBEY YOU. I'M SUGGESTING WE HAVE A CONVERSATION IN CONGRESS AND PASS A BAND LIKE THIS. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE PASSED BY A MAJORITY. Tucker: WOULD YOU APPLY THESE STANDARDS TO YOURSELF? I DON'T THINK OPS THOUGH. Tucker: YOUR BODYGUARDS. I DON'T HAVE BODYGUARDS. Tucker: I WAS THERE TODAY. I DON'T PERSONALLY HAVE BODYGUARDS. THEY ARE POLICE OFFICERS, THEY ARE SWORN, THEY ARE TRAINED. Tucker: THEY ARE THERE TO PROTECT YOU. I HAVE TWO BROTHERS WHO ARE COPS, MY DAD WAS A COP. I DON'T WANT THEM TO PROTECT ME, I WANT THEM TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE GETTING SHOT UP IN THE SCHOOLS. Tucker: THE POLICE TO PROTECT YOU. THIS ISN'T ABOUT CAPITOL POLICE. Tucker: IT IS THOUGH. THIS IS ABOUT THE KIDS WHO ARE DYING. THEY ARE AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY HEAR A BOOK DROPPED, THEY THINK A SHOOTER IS WALKING INTO THE CLASSROOM. DON'T THEY DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED? SELECT PROTECT THEM. Tucker: YOU HAVE THEM IN YOUR BUILDING WHERE YOU WORK. DON'T DENIGRATE THE COPS. Tucker: I'M NOT DENIGRATING THEM. YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CARE MORE THAN I DO, WE CARE THE SAME. DO YOU THINK OPS SHOULD HAVE GUNS? Tucker: I THINK YOUR BODYGUARDS HAVE THE SAME GUNS I HAVE TO PROTECT MY FAMILY. DON'T DENIGRATE THEM LIKE THAT. Tucker: IF HE COMES TO PROTECT MY WIFE ON A NETWORK YOU GO TO WORK PROTECTING THE CONSTITUENTS. Tucker: THEY ARE PROTECTING YOU ACTUALLY. WHY SHOULDN'T MY WIFE HAVE THE SAME FIREARM AT HOME THAT YOUR BODYGUARDS USED TO PROTECT YOU? THAT'S A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. Tucker: BECAUSE YOU ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME? I'M ASKING IT SINCE YOUR QUESTION. WHY SHOULD YOU GO TO PROTECT YOUR OUR COPS SHOULD NOT BE OUTGUNNED. PERIOD. OUR MILITARY SHOULDN'T BE OUTGUNNED. Tucker: WHY DON'T WE JUST LIMIT THEM TO THE SAME GUNS I CAN HAVE AT HOME? WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS? Tucker: THIS IS A REAL CONVERSATION. YOU ARE CALLING COPS BODYGUARDS, AND THAT'S DISRESPECTFUL. THEY WERE ALL HERE IN TOWN HONORING THE FALLEN AND YOU ARE CALLING THEM BODYGUARDS. MY DAD WAS A COP, HE'S NOT A BODYGUARD. HE PROTECTS PEOPLE. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. Tucker: TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE BODYGUARDS? THAT IS SO DISRESPECTFUL. Tucker: THEY ARE. THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR THEM. THEY PROTECT YOU AND YOUR KIDS AND OUR FAMILIES. Tucker: CAN I GET THE SAME IN MY OFFICE IN THE TEXT PAYERS CAN PAY FOR IT? CAN I ASK A QUESTION? IF I WALKED ON THE OFFICE, GREAT GUYS, I'M NOT ATTACKING THEM. THEY ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK AT ALL. I'M MERELY SAYING THAT YOU HAVE BETTER PROTECTION THAN I DO. AND YOU ARE SAYING THAT MY FAMILY DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN SPECIES OF WEAPON. YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT WE CAN PROTECT OURSELVES WITH BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO IN ANY WAY TAKE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT YOU AWAY FROM THE CAPITAL POLICE. I'M SAYING EVERY POLICE OFFICER IN AMERICA IS OUTGUNNED. FOR THEIR SAFETY AND THE PEOPLE THEY PROTECT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ASSAULT WEAPONS. THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO YOU.
