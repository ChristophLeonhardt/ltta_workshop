what we're really talking about is how bad the economy has gotten under neoliberalism so in 1980 up until 1980 workers pay used to be in correlation to productivity so if you produced more and you made more profit workers got more money well in 1980 that stopped so now productivity and wages are decoupled so it doesn't matter how much people make it all gets sucked up to the upper upper 1% which is why when they outsource a job that the the company makes more money but the people in the United States don't get that money doesn't get spread around to anybody so that's the problem with our economy Jack Ma who runs the Amazon of Asia said that we don't have a problem making money in America we have a problem with how we spread it around and that's exactly right and we spend it on war 14 trillion dollars since 1980 or something like that some crazy number we've been spending so here's here's what it first came up George Bush was out doing these town halls where he would talk to people he wanted to privatize Social Security and so he had to go make people try to go along with screwing over Social Security and this woman got told him about how hard she works and let's watch his response here we go people are working longer and the truth of the matter is elderly baby boomers have got a lot to offer to our society and we shouldn't think about giving up our responsibilities that right that's right yeah but nevertheless there's a certain comfort to know that the promise is made will be kept by the government yes and so thank you for asking that you don't have to worry that's good because I work three jobs and I feel like I contribute you works three jobs and now you think George Bush is gonna go that's crazy why would you someone like you have to work three jobs in America just to just to pay your bills and have a decent life why would someone like you that's I think that's why he's gonna say like we're the greatest country's middle class what is huh here we go jobs yes uniquely American in it I mean that is fantastic that you're doing that at uniquely American yes and he said it was fantastic it's fantastic three jobs he's sitting there going yeah I don't even work one job I think snaps hey yeah I temp I'm riding my bike all day I'm taking naps this is the hardest thing I do is I have to sit here and talk to you and you know Jimmy whenever I go somewhere I really want an elderly person waiting on me ah you know there's nothing better than somebody who's like in their 70s or 80s making ends meet waiting on me right I remember when I was a kid McDonald's started they would have they had commercials where senior citizens who had retired I don't know if you remember this a guy went back to work at McDonald's he was going to get a job and and it was like this feel-good commercial and at the end he comes home and his wife says how'd it go and he goes I don't know how they ever got along without me and I remember Jay Leno was like isn't that a great heartwarming commercial cradle-to-grave minimum wage isn't that fantastic and that's what they were preaching and this is what George Bush was preaching I'm gonna show it one more time here we go you don't have to worry that's good because I work three jobs and I feel like I contribute he works three jobs three jobs uniquely American in it I mean that is fantastic that you're doing that and everybody applauds yeah that old lady has to work her fingers to the bone yeah I don't think people know exactly how bad the disparity is between the rich and poor because you know a lot of people regular Americans they don't know the super rich people personally right so they don't see how bad that that gap is right I agree no you know I know someone who he makes six hundred thousand dollars a year just for sitting on a board of another company yeah yeah and he's and he spends one day each quarter so he works four days a year but for six hundred thousand dollars and in that one day that he works is not a full day he said it's like a six-hour meeting an hour and half break for lunch a lot of chit-chatting so the point is there's wealth being created by a large number of workers and then that wealth that's created is extracted yes my corporations and is given to the top executives and it's also kept by the corporations to to basically amass giant sums of money for what so I can buy out other corporations and merge and become even more powerful and then crush even more people yes that's really been the playbook for the last 30 yes four years yeah that is the playbook that's how it works and you know when you start a company now it like these tech companies they they don't really want to become a successful company they just want to build a company that's attractive enough to be bought by a bigger company that's how you make money and I learned that watching shark tank okay okay remember that guy he was on his app but he really wanted to the whole point was we're gonna sell it for twenty million dollars anyway how many industries do we see right now are worth billions of dollars but they're not making any money well amazon.com operates at a loss all right that's their business model is they don't have to have profit and they don't have to pay taxes so how do you compete against that that's called predatory capitalism that's what Jeff Bezos is the guy's the richest in the world he's in bed with the CIA and the Pentagon and he owns the Washington Post and everybody who works a lot of people work for him are on poverty and he looks exactly like dr. evil come on so let's get back to this why is this inspiring teen went right back to work after a car accident man walks 15 miles to work everything so we're showing you this stuff and fair says a healthy press would take these anecdotes of can-do spirit and ask bigger questions like why are these people forced into such absurd hardship who benefits from skyrocketing college costs why does the public transit in this person city not have subsidies for the poor why aren't employers forced to offer time off for catastrophic accidents but time and time again the medium honestly tells the bootstrap human-interest story never questioning the underlying system at work it's part of a broader media culture of anecdotes in lieu of the mackeral moralizing success rather than questioning systemic problems journalism is as much if not more about what isn't reported as what is here a local reporter is faced with a cruel example of people falling through the cracks of the richest country on earth and their only contribution is to cherry-pick one guy who managed just barely to cling on to the edge perseverance porn that's what they call it perseverance porn may seem harmless but in highlighting hand-picked cases of people overcoming hardship without showing the thousands that didn't much less asking broader questions as to what created these conditions the media traffics in decidedly right-wing tropes after all if they can do it so can you right and here's another one of those just for good measure this man is proof we all just need to keep walking no matter what life throws at us this 52 year old man walks 12 miles to work so that's a news reporter Andy Trujillo so nobody could ever complain nobody could ever complain she should this should make her hair go on fire like why isn't there public transportation for this guy why does he have to go 12 miles just to get to work are you sick and tired of corporate Democrats as much as we are and you think we can have what the rest of the world has and come watch the aggressive progresses with us on The Young Turks Network
