but aren't there other major holidays during Christmas time beside Christmas and New Year's this is usually what they ask now really there are holidays to be sure but no major ones the closest contender we have is Hanukkah which is the Jewish festival of lights but while Hanukkah is indeed an ancient holiday it dates back about 2,000 years it is a relatively minor holiday major Jewish holidays are biblical they feature restrictions on work because Hanukkah is non biblical there are few religious restrictions on work according to historian Diane Ashton Hanukkah rose to prominence in America as it did not in the rest of the world because of two reform rabbis in 19th century Cincinnati who worried their children had a little connection to the synagogue before that there is a little record of Hanukkah celebrations the rabbi's modeled the celebration in gift-giving after Christmas as Ashton explains quote they didn't see Christmas as something they could do easily because it's Christian but they did want to do something like that because it was American so kosher restaurants even started serving turkey dinners after the American custom that's Hanukkah the far less credible Pretender is Kwanzaa which is a socialist contrivance invented by a criminal LA City College Africana Studies professor named Maulana Karenga in 1966 he created Kwanzaa to be a holiday specifically for black Americans even though black Americans already celebrated Christmas ironically while virtually all African slaves were brought to America from the west coast of Africa Kwanzaa is a Swahili word meaning firstfruits that originated in East Africa which means none of the slaves brought to America would have understood it now one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa is communism bujjamma cooperative economics and Maulana Karenga himself was sentenced to prison in 1971 for felonious assault and false imprisonment after he sexually assaulted and tortured multiple women as the LA Times reported he ordered them to strip naked whipped them with an electrical cord and beat them with the karate baton Karenga then placed a hot soldering iron in one woman's mouth and against her face and tightened her big toe and a vise he finally put detergent and running hoses in their mouths and hit them on the head with toasters as the Black Power movement of the 1970s has waned so too has the celebration of the holiday on the high end of estimates point three percent of Americans acknowledge the supposed holiday that rate continues to decline so why pretend Christmas time does not center around Christmas why pretend there are so many other major holidays on equal footing there's new year on January 1st and we've long said good tiding for Christmas in a happy new year there's Chanukah a relatively minor holiday but by the way we don't say Happy Holidays instead of happy Labor Day even though Rosh Hashanah which is a far more important Jewish holiday than Chanukah sometimes occurs around the same time you don't say that we don't say happy holidays or season's greetings instead of happy Columbus Day even though Yom Kippur another much more important Jewish holiday sometimes occurs around that time well actually now we don't say happy Columbus Day either we say blessed indigenous peoples day or something like that that's another story beer is Kwanzaa virtually non-existent holiday what else is there there's Boxing Day in which no one in the United States celebrates there's the winter solstice which people pretend is a thing but nobody celebrates and of course it isn't about the the celebrants of Hanukkah or Kwanzaa or the winter solstice who are waging the war on Christmas it's the Atheist left who constantly seeks to replace clear vivid language with bizarre secular euphemisms this is the essence of political correctness that the essence of political correctness is to replace clear language with euphemisms to remove the strength of that language
