the other top story tonight the man that Donald Trump fired with Russia on his mind James Comey he's coming back how strange is it for you to sit here and compare the president to a mob boss yeah things that you know but haven't said they could damage president Romney machines coming it was president Trump obstructing justice should donald trump be impeached important story strong background trailer music as well now James Comey has only publicly spoken once so far I was under oath to Congress so the new book and these interviews will add more detail in what is still an open criminal probe of Trump but Republicans they have a counter-argument to Comey they can cast him as a disgruntled ex-employee leaks a man who Democrats many leaders used to revile and who could be spinning his own agenda now we know Donald Trump is under scrutiny for obstruction partly because of that kind of attack on witnesses slamming the FBI and tatters saying Comey is basically a lying nut job those are quotes and waging this war on commis deputy he ultimately was fired legal experts excuse me legal experts say those attacks are inappropriate for any president and especially one under this kind of investigation but could they work yeah I mean if if reasonable people think that come and mccabe are just spinning and people in the government and the FBI do spin sometimes then that may reflect a different view of this case commis word alone isn't going to bail him out with critics but evidence might and that's what's actually bigger right now tonight in this looming book tour those famous memos that are now in miller's hands do they corroborate the worst things that Comey will be saying about Trump and what about the other memos not just commis but the ones written by other people who simply SATA saw what they believe was a problem at the White House and wrote it down well those memos are starting to come out right now they might make for even better material than any choreographed book tour Rachel Maddow broke the big scoop with some of them last night reporting key passages from another senior DOJ official Dana Bente who served under Trump and guess what he backs commis account according to these notes well cloud as a result of Russia business this makes running the country difficult what can I do to relieve the cloud kept coming back to it making it hard to do business for the country I'm joined now by Matt Miller who worked at the DOJ under Eric Holder and Collette holt who knows a bit about James Comey she's not only a practicing attorney she went to law school with him at the University of Chicago good school graduating the class of 1985 thank you both for being a part of this conversation Matt the notes what do they mean I think they are important cooperating evidence to show that Jim Comey was telling the truth about his conversations with the president because of course the president has disputed that publicly there's been a little bit of a he-said he-said and the evidence from Dana bent day as well as commis memos and remember he shared his accounts with other people inside the FBI who probably took their own notes and wrote their own memos are gonna be important establishing who told the truth and I think if you look at the the notes that Rachel was able to report on last night those aren't the most damning conversation that the President had with Jim Comey he was asking him something really inappropriate that's a conversation the president shouldn't be having with the president asking him to publicly clear but it's not something illegal the more damning notes I think we will eventually see these in some context we'll see them publicly our would be the ones of the conversation of that February 14th memorializing that February 14th conversation where the president asked Jim Comey to back off of Mike Flynn and kind of see as cool see his see his way to letting him go right and you didn't even get into the candlelit dinner yeah yeah I didn't about the loyalty plan you know Colette there's an old saying if you're gonna obstruct do it by candlelight mr. Comey for so long is he does seem to be dialing up the rhetoric and I wonder whether that might backfire he was extraordinarily careful under oath and not willing to go farther than just the narrow facts he had take a listen I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I have with the president was an effort to obstruct that's a conclusion I'm sure the Special Counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there and whether that's an offense Coletta's as you know as an attorney and for the benefit of viewers there's a big difference with a somebody punched and the law section was it assault battery or was it self-defense or was it something was it something else but now we see the reports in the ABC clip I played that seemed to suggest he alludes to the president of some kind of mob boss you could argue that's a bigger statement than obstruction do you think he's getting getting out over his skis no no I don't think so I think that it's sort of finally time to take on these bullies and and frankly the thuggish behavior that your earlier segments described you know even someone as calm and cautious as Jim Comey can only take so much and he's trying to defend himself against these attacks these attempts to destroy him his reputation and so frankly I'm kind of glad that he's you know getting out there and letting people know that that really his side of the story is correct and Rachel's reporting last night just reifies that that he takes careful notes he's a good careful lawyer that's what we do and that he can defend himself yeah and the notes are so key and he was very blunt about why he took them also in that hearing under oath the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI those were lies plain and simple I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting and so I thought it really important to document since you know him what does that tell you about how he will be conducting himself going forward well I think he's gonna conduct himself the way he always has which is a straight shooter gonna tell it like it is he's going to be blunt when he needs to be and calling the President of the United States a liar is a very strong statement and I think he's going to continue to make his point that what Trump did was at best inappropriate and and certainly potentially criminal hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
