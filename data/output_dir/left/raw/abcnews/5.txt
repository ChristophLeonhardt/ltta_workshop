00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,222
BEHIND BARS.

3
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,257
THIS WAS A VIDEO EARLIER OF HIM 

4
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,258
ARRIVING TO COURT TODAY.

5
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,961
HE HAD A SMILE ON HIS FACE UNTIL

6
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:34,334
HE LEARNED THE NEWS THAT WE 

7
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,635
LEARNED MOEMENTS AGO.

8
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:39,672
COSBY WAS CONVICTED IN APRIL OF 

9
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:44,677
DRUGGING AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING

10
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,779
ANDREA CONSTAND.

11
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,681
THE JURY FOUND COSBY GUILTY ON 

12
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,719
THREE COUNTS.

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,887
LINDSEY DAVIS HAS BEEN STANDING 

14
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:59,359
BY COVERING THIS CASE FROM THE 

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:00:59,592
GET-GO.

16
00:00:59,592 --> 00:00:59,926
L

17
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,895
LINDSEY, WALK US THROUGH THIS.

18
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:09,369
>> Reporter: BILL COSBY REMAINED

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,403
MOTIONLESS, HE HAD HIS HEAD FOR 

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,272
FORWARD AND SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT

21
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:12,472
AHEAD.

22
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,541
IN THE BACK ROW, IT WAS FILLED 

23
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,676
WITH MAYBE ABOUT EIGHT OTHER 

24
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,479
COSBY ACCUSERS AND THEY HAD 

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,514
ALREADY HANDED OUT TISSUES AND 

26
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,216
TEARS BEGAN TO FLOW.

27
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,684
THEY WERE CRYING QUIETLY SO THEY

28
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,219
WOULD NOT GET KICKED OUT IN 

29
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:26,586
COURT.

30
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,621
THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS AND 

31
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,924
NODDING THEIR HEADS AGAIN AND 

32
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,157
AGAIN.

33
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,660
IT WAS QUIET.

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,695
YOU CAN HEAR PIN DROPPED IN THE 

35
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:35,962
COURTROOM.

36
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,631
THE JUDGE SAYS HE'LL HAVE TO PAY

37
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,399
FOR THE PROSECUTION COST AND 

38
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:41,901
$25,000 FINE.

39
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,537
LEADING UP TO HIS SENTENCE, HE 

40
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,739
GAVE SOME REALLY STRONG QUOTES 

41
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,675
DIRECTLY AIMED AT BILL COSBY AND

42
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:53,079
HE SAID, THE JURY'S VERDICT MUST

43
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,247
BE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR.

44
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,382
YOU ARE CONVICTED OF A SERIOUS 

45
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,183
CRIME AGAIN AND AGAIN.

46
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,119
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.

47
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,554
HE TALKED ABOUT DESPITE HOW MUCH

48
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,691
MONEY AND FAME AND CELEBRITY YOU

49
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,125
HAVE, NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.

50
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,161
>> LINDSEY, WHEN THE JUDGE 

51
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,896
CLASSIFIED HIM AS A SEXUAL LEVI 

52
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:14,367
LENT PREDATOR, HE SENT A SIGNAL 

53
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,868
THERE, HIS PENNSYLVANIA STATE 

54
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:17,570
LAW DEFINED THE SEXUAL VIOLENT 

55
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,106
PREDATOR AS A PERSON WHO HAS A 

56
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,676
MENTAL DISORDER THAT MAKES THE 

57
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,680
PERSON TO ENGAGE IN PREDATORY 

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,649
SEXUALLY BODILY DEFENSES.

59
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,452
THAT DID NOT WORK IN THE JUDGE'S

60
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,522
DECISION OF HIS ILLNESS AND 

61
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:36,855
DISABILITIES.

62
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:37,556
>> Reporter: YOU'RE RIGHT, IT 

63
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:39,525
DID NOT WORK.

64
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,193
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID 

65
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,095
SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE, YOU DON'T 

66
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,563
GET OUT OF JAIL A FREE CARD 

67
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,965
BECAUSE YOU ARE OLD OR BECAUSE 

68
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,400
IT IS TAKEN THIS LONG FOR 

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,936
JUSTICE TO CATCH UP TO YOU.

70
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,072
THE STATE'S PRISON ARE EQUIPPED 

71
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,441
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OLD OR BLIND.

72
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,709
IT SEEMS CLEAR EARLY ON THAT THE

73
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,411
JUDGE WHO GAVE A LENGTHY 

74
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,079
STATEMENT BEFORE HE GAVE THE 

75
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:00,980
SENTENCE THAT HE WAS NOT GOING 

76
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,181
TO BUY THAT.

77
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,183
HE BASICALLY SAID LOOK, WHAT YOU

78
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,987
ARE CHARGED OF REQUIRES THAT I 

79
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,923
GIVE YOU THIS TOTAL CONFINEMENT 

80
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,459
AND KEPT MENTIONING THAT HE 

81
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,194
WOULD NEEDED TO PROTECT THE 

82
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,729
PUBLIC AND ALSO THAT HE WOULD 

83
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:21,768
NEED THIS PRISON TIME BASICALLY 

84
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,771
IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE GRAVITY 

85
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,504
OF THIS CHARGE.

86
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,074
>> LINDSEY, YOU INTERVIEWED BILL

87
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,676
COSBY DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS, 

88
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,277
DO YOU THINK ONCE THE JUDGE 

89
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,312
HANDED DOWN THAT SENTENCE THAT 

90
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,980
IT HIT HIM THAT HE REALIZED THAT

91
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,481
HE WAS GOING TO PRISON.

92
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,116
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL 

93
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,786
PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD AND LABELED 

94
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,787
AMERICA'S DAD AND NOW HE'S 

95
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,791
BEHIND BARS.

96
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,091
>> YO

97
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:46,292
. 

98
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,860
>> Reporter: IT SEEMS HE HAD 

99
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,262
BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS OUTCOME.

100
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,097
TO YOUR POINT AND TO TALK TO THE

101
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,231
GRAVITY OF THIS SITUATION, THERE

102
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:56,302
WAS A QUOTE IN 1981 FROM A

FORMER P.R. EXEC, COCA-COLA, HE

MANY AS TEN YEARS BEHIND BARS.

112
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,055
>> AN INCREDIBLE FALL FROM 

113
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,824
GRACE, 60 WOMEN HAVE COME

00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,827
FORWARD AND ACCUSED HIM OF 

115
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:26,566
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING THEM.

116
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,300
I WANT TO PUT THE STATEMENT 

117
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,601
ANDREA CONSTAND SAID.

118
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,839
>> BILL COSBY TOOK MY BEAUTIFUL,

HEALTHY YOUNG SPIRIT AND CRUSHED

IT.

121
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:42,714
HE ROBBED ME OF MY VITALITY WILL

122
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:47,387
WILL -- THE FIRST CONVICTED MAN.

123
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,590
I WANT TO BRING IN YOUR SENIOR 

124
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,390
CORRES

125
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,058
CORRESPONDENT, YOUR THOUGHTS ON 

126

THE SENTENCING.

127
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,994
>> IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS 

128
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,097
JUDGE LOOKED AT BILL COSBY AS HE

129
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,334
WOULD LOOK AT OTHER DEFENDANT.

130
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,235
HE'S NOT ABOVE THE LAW.

131
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,536
THIS SENTENCE IS WITHIN THE 

132
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,304
RANGE OF WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT 

133
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,706
SOMEONE WOULD GET AND SOMEONE 

134
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,442
HAS BEEN CONVICTED AND 

135
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:16,816
CLASSIFIED AS A SEXUAL LELY VIOT

136
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,551
PREDATOR.

137
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,786
A RANGE OF NO LESS THAN THREE TO

138
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,021
TEN WAS COMPLETELY IN THE 

139
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:22,354
GUIDELINES.

140
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:25,958
ONCE HE WAS CLASSIFIED AS A 

141
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,128
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR, THAT 

142
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,799
MEANS SOMEONE THAT PLANNED THIS.

143
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,467
HOW DO YOU PROTECT THE COMMUNITY

144
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,868
FROM SOMEONE WHO CAN'T CONTROL 

145
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:36,101
HIMSELF.

146
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,236
>> THAT WAS THE DETERMINING 

147
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:37,970
POINT TODAY.

148
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,306
HE MAY BE 81 YEARS OLD AND BLIND

149
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:52,785
AND FRAIL BUT IF HE'S STILL 

150
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,587
UNDER HOUSE ARREST, HE CAN STILL

151
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,087
ATTACK THEM.

152
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,789
>> SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AND 

153
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,991
YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 

154
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,693
IN DETERMINING THIS SORT OF 

155
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,396
SENTENCE, YOU LOOK AT HIS 

156
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,697
PREVIOUS RECORD, COSBY DID NOT 

157
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,266
HAVE ONE.

158
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:07,900
THIS IS CLEARLY SERIOUS AND THE 

159
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,869
AGGRAVATING FACTORS AND 

160
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,973
MITIGATING FACTORS, HE FALLS 

161
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,809
SQUARELY INTO THIS SENTENCE.

162
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,278
>> THANK YOU, I WANT TO GO BACK 

163
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:19,578
TO LINDSEY.

164
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:20,946
>> HE DOES PLAN TO APPEAL AND 

165
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:22,515
THE APPEAL PROCESS STARTS NOW.

166
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,851
>> Reporter: YES, EXACTLY, 

167
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,686
ACCORDING TO PENNSYLVANIA'S LAW,

168
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,788
YOU CAN'T START WITHOUT AN 

169
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,524
APPEAL PROCESS UNTIL AFTER A 

170
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:31,824
SENTENCING.

171
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,092
THERE IS A LAWYER IN COURT FOR 

172
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,796
HIM TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS 

173
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,263
IMMEDIATELY.

174
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,332
BILL COSBY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 

175
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,167
AND THE JUDGE REMINDED HIM, ARE 

176
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,702
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY 

177
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:42,969
ANYTHING.

178
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,770
HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY 

179
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,240
THE PRIOR WORDS PRIOR TO THE 

180
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,341
JUDGE SENTENCING, HE CHOSE TO

STAY QUIET.

182
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,809
THIS IS A CLEAR VICTORY FOR THE 

183
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,478
DISTRICT ATTORNEY, THEY ASKED 

184
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,614
FOR FIVE TO TEN YEARS, THEY'RE 

185
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:56,649
GETTING AT LEAST THREE TO TEN.

186
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,750
LINDSEY DAVIS FOR US.

187
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,318
