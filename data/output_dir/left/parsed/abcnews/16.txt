NOW REPORTING, DAVID MUHR.
>>> POLICE AND ATF ARE ON THE 
SCENE OF A SHOOTING AT THE 
"CAPITAL GAZETTE NEWSPAPER" 
LOCATED IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND.
SHOOTING IS REPORTED INSIDE THE 
BUILDING.
A GAZETTE REPORTER WHO WORKS 
THERE NOW SAYS MULTIPLE PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN SHOT.
THAT'S NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY 
POLICE YET.
REPORTER AT THE PAPER SAYS 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE SHOT THE.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON THE 
INCIDENTS.
GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN TWEETING, 
QUOTE, HE IS ABSOLUTELY 
DEVASTATED TO LEARN OF THIS 
TRAGEDY IN ANNAPOLIS.
OUR SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT
PIERRE THOMAS IS COVERING THIS 
STORY.
>> DAVID, DEVASTATING SITUATION 
UNFOLDING.
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH A 
SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL 
WHO SAYS THE INFORMATION IS 
PRELIMINARY BUT THAT MULTIPLE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT AT THAT 
LOCATION.
TARGET APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THAT
NEWSPAPER.
THE ANNAPOLIS CAPITAL GAZETTE.
AGAIN, MULTIPLE PEOPLE SHOT.
SOME OF THE INJURIES, I'M TOLD 
BY THE SOURCE, QUITE SERIOUS, 
DAVID.
>> SO MULTIPLE PEOPLE SHOT FROM 
A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE,
PIERRE?
>> YES.
MULTIPLE PEOPLE SHOT.
SOURCES DID NOT WANT TO GIVE -- 
HE GAVE ME SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT 
SAID IT IS VERY FLUID, SO WE 
AREN'T QUITE COMFORTABLE GIVING 
OUT THOSE NUMBERS YET, DAVID.
BUT HE SAID IT IS A GRAVE 
SITUATION, MULTIPLE PEOPLE SHOT 
AND THAT SOME OF THE INJURIES 
PROBABLY WOULD PROVE FATAL.
>> PIERRE, THANK YOU.
AS WE ARE ON THE SCENE, YOU SEE 
REPORTS OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER AT 
"THE CAPITAL GAZETTE NEWSPAPER" 
IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND.
AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
BRIEFED.
IT IS A VERY ACTIVE SCENE.
THERE WERE PICTURES WHERE YOU 
CAN SEE PEOPLE WORKING INSIDE IN
NEWSPAPER WERE EVACUATING THE 
BUILDING AS THIS WAS UNDER WAY.
THERE ARE TWEETS COMING IN.
SOME OBSERVERS WHO ARE THERE IN 
THE AREA.
ONE TWEET RIGHT HERE FROM THE 
POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYING, 
CONFIRMING AN ACTIVE SHOOTER AT 
888 BESTGATE ROAD IN ANNAPOLIS.
OBVIOUSLY THE LOCATION OF THE 
NEWSPAPER.
BUILDING HAS BEEN EVACUATED.
OFFICERS CONTINUING TO SEARCH 
THE BUILDING.
RELOCATION POINT IS INSIDE LORD 
& TAYLOR IN THE MALL.
THESE GET THESE TWEETS OUT VERY 
QUICKLY FROM LOCAL POLICE 
DEPARTMENTS.
BRAD GARRETT FROM THE FBI IS ON 
THE PHONE.
WHEN YOU HEAR THE LOCATION, THIS
WAS INSIDE A NEWSPAPER WHERE 
THIS ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION IS
UNFOLDING, WHAT DOES THIS TELL 
YOU?
>> IT TELLS ME THAT THERE HAS TO
BE SOMETHING IN REFERENCE TO THE
NEWSPAPER.
I WOULD LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE 
RECENTLY PUBLISHED, IN 
PARTICULAR TODAY.
IF THERE'S SOMETHING IN AN 
ARTICLE OR EDITORIAL THAT WOULD 
LEAD THEM POTENTIALLY TO 
SOMEONE.
DID THE SHOOTER ACTUALLY SAY 
SOMETHING BEFORE HE COMMITTED 
THE SHOOTING.
IT MAY ALSO GIVE THEM SOME 
INSIGHT AS TO WHAT THE 
MOTIVATION MIGHT BE.
>> OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW A 
MOTIVE AT THIS HOUR.
WE CERTAINLY DON'T EVEN KNOW 
WHETHER THERE IS ANYONE IN 
CUSTODY.
THOSE, BRAD GARRETT, AN ANALYST 
FOR ABC, FORMER FBI AUTHORITY 
HIMSELF, ABLE TO POINT OUT THAT 
THIS IS A NEWSPAPER, THAT'S 
CERTAINLY GOING TO BE PART OF 
THIS INVESTIGATION, FIGURING OUT
WHY SOMEONE WOULD GO IN AND 
TARGET SOMEONE INSIDE THE 
NEWSPAPER.
PIERRE CONTINUES TO GET 
INFORMATION FROM HIS SOURCES.
BACK TO PIERRE THOMAS.
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?
>> DAVID, THE FBI HAS ARRIVED AT
THE SCENE.
THEY ARE ASSISTING LOCAL POLICE,
AS IS THE ATF.
WE ARE BEING TOLD BY SOURCES 
THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
THERE IS NOT MORE THAN ONE 
SHOOTER.
THEY ARE GOING TO GO ROOM TO 
ROOM TO CHECK EVERY FACILITY IN 
THE BUILDING.
ALSO, THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE ALSO 
CHECKING FOR POTENTIAL BOMBS.
THIS IS PRETTY STANDARD THAT 
THEY WOULD DO THIS.
AGAIN, EMPHASIZING, FLUID 
SITUATION.
THERE IS A PERSON THEY 
APPARENTLY ARE TALKING TO OR 
TRYING TO CONFIRM THAT THIS 
PERSON IS THE SHOOTER.
>> FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST JOINING
US NOW, YOU'RE WATCHING ABC NEWS
LIVE COVERAGE OF AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTING SITUATION AT A 
NEWSPAPER IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND.
THERE IS AN UNCONFIRMED STORY 
THAT'S BEEN POSTED ON THE "

I'M DAVID

>>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE, 
WE'RE COMING BACK ON THE AIR 
WITH MORE ON THE BREAKING NEWS 
IN ANNAPOLIS MARYLAND.
WE WANT TO LISTEN TO AUTHORITIES
AFTER A SHOOTING AT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE NEWSPAPER.
>> IT'S AN ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION.
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE 
EVERYONE IS SAFE.
ONCE THE BUILDING IS SECURE, WE 
HAVE A CRIME SCENE.
WE ANTICIPATE THIS BEING A SHORT
PRESS CONFERENCE.
WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT QUESTIONS 
FOR INVESTIGATION PURPOSES, WE 
STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
>>> WE'VE HAD A TERRIBLE 
SHOOTING INCIDENT HERE THIS 
AFTERNOON.
THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO 
DIED FROM THIS INCIDENT.
AND SEVERAL OTHERS ARE INJURED.
THOSE WHO ARE INJURED HAVE BEEN 
TRANSPORTED TO ANNE ARUNDEL 
MEDICAL CENTER AND JOHNS HOPKINS
SHOCK TRAUMA.
THOSE FATALITIES ARE SO SAD.
AND OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE
WITH THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES.
YOU CAN TAKE COMFORT KNOWING 
THEY ARE IN GOD'S EMBRACE.
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY AND 
BEING INTERROGATED AT THIS TIME.
I WANT TO COMMEND THE PUBLIC 
SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO CLEARED
THE SCENE WITHIN 60 SECONDS, AND
WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE 
FROM ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY POLICE 
AND FIRE.
STATE POLICE, HOWARD COUNTY, 
PRINCE GEORGES, SEVERAL FEDERAL 
AGENCIES INCLUDING FBI AND ATF.
WE WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE 
AGENCIES FOR THEIR QUICK 
RESPONSE AND BEING OUR PARTNERS 
IN THIS UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT.
>> GOVERNOR?
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY, FIRST OF 
ALL, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS 
ARE WITH THE VICTIMS AND 
FAMILIES.
AND I WANT TO THANK THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO 
RESPONDED TO THE RESPONSE TEAM 
WHO DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB.
THE FACT THAT THEY RESPONDED 
WITHIN 60 SECONDS.
I WANT TO GIVE SERIOUS PRAISE TO
ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY, AND THE 
CITY OF ANNAPOLIS FOR THEIR 
RESPONSE, AND WE WERE HERE 
BACKING THEM UP.
WE HAVE FEDERAL AGENCIES.
IT'S A TRAGIC SITUATION.
WE CAN'T -- WE DON'T HAVE ALL 
THE INFORMATION YET, AND WE 
CAN'T GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION 
YET.
IT'S AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE 
INVESTIGATION, BUT WE HAVE HAD 
SEVERAL FATALITIES AND SEVERAL 
PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL.
AND WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT TO THE 
PROFESSIONALS TO CONTINUE THEIR 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION.
>> LIEUTENANT, I KNOW YOU SAID 
IT'S EARLY, BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN 
THE NUMBER OF FATALITIES IN 
ANYWAY.
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU -- AT 
LEAST ANY NUMBERS YOU KNOW OF 
NOW.
>> I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE OUR 
ACTING CHIEF, WHO WILL ANSWER 
SOME QUESTIONS, BUT AGAIN, 
PLEASE -- IT WILL BE VERY BRIEF.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE 
INFORMATION WE PUT OUT IS 
ACCURATE.
SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE 
INVOLVED HERE, WE WANT TO MAKE 
SURE THAT INFORMATION IS 
ACCURATE, WE DON'T WANT TO SAY 
ANYTHING THAT WILL RUIN THE 
INVESTIGATION.
IT'S STILL BEING INTERVIEWED 
BIFF THE DETECTIVES.
I'LL INTRODUCE OUR ACTING CHIEF.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
AS CAN YOU SEE, THIS IS A VERY 
FLUID SCENE.
CAN YOU SEE WE HAVE OVER 10 PLUS
AGENCIES ASSISTING WITH ANNE 
ARUNDEL COUNTY POLICE, THE 
INVESTIGATION HAS JUST STARTED.
AS RYAN HAS SAID, WE'RE GOING TO
BE QUITE A WHILE DETERMINING 
WHAT OCCURRED, WHY IT OCCURRED 
AND HOW IT OCCURRED.
AS THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED, WE 
WERE HERE QUICKLY.
WE RECEIVED A CALL AS AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER, WE DO HAVE FATALITIES 
AND WE DO HAVE SERIOUS INJURIES.
WE ALSO HAVE MANY, MANY 
WITNESSES THAT ARE BEING 
INTERVIEWED.
AND WE HAVE AN AREA OVER BY 
LORD & TAYLOR THAT THE WITNESSES
CAN REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES.
WE HAVE -- WE ARE ASKING THEM TO
CONTACT THEIR FAMILIES SO THAT 
THEY CAN COME AND ASSIST THEM 
WITH GETTING HOME SAFELY.
AS RYAN MENTIONED BEFORE, OUR 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION 
HAS ONE PERSON IN CUSTODY.
THAT PERSON IS AT OUR CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION DIVISION DOWN IN 
CROWNSVILLE, AND WE WILL BE 
SPEAKING WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL 
QUITE FREQUENTLY AND SHORTLY I 
SHALL SAY.
AND GET THE INFORMATION.
THE BUILDING IS SECURE FROM A 
TACTICAL STANDPOINT.
THAT MEANS THAT RIGHT NOW WE 
BELIEVE THAT THERE NO OTHER 
SHOOTERS IN THE BUILDING, BUT IT
HAS NOT BEEN CLEARED FROM AN 
INVESTIGATIVE STANDPOINT.
SO ONCE THE QRT AND THE MEMBERS 
OF THE S.W.A.T. TEAM LEAVE THE 
BUILDING, THE INVESTIGATORS WILL
GO IN, AND WE WILL START TO 
PROCESS PUTTING THE 
INVESTIGATION TOGETHER.
>> ANYTHING CAN YOU TELL US -- 
>> RIGHT NOW WE CAN CONFIRM 
WHERE THE SHOOTING OCCURRED 
THROUGHOUT THAT BUILDING.
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE BUILDING IS 
WITHIN THAT BUILDING ALONG WITH 
MANY OTHER BUSINESSES AND 
DOCTOR'S OFFICES.
>> NOT AT THIS POINT. 
>> OUR OFFICERS WERE ON THE 
SCENE VERY, VERY QUICKLY, I 
THINK IT WAS AROUND 60 SECONDS, 
A MINUTE, MINUTE AND A HALF.
THEY DID ENGAGE THE SUSPECT AND 
THAT'S WHEN HE WAS TAKEN INTO 
CUSTODY.
IT OCCURRED VERY QUICKLY.
THAT WAS AGAIN JUST FOR 
EVERYONE, THAT WAS OUR ACTING 
CHIEF, WILLIAM KRAMPH.
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MAYOR 
GAVIN BUCKLEY.
>> YOU'RE WATCHING ABC NEWS LIVE
COVERAGE OF A HORRIFIC SCENE 
UNFOLDING.
LATE THIS AFTERNOON IN ANNAPOLIS
MARYLAND.
THOSE ARE THE AUTHORITIES 
GATHERED OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE NEWSPAPER LOCATED INSIDE
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SHOPPING 
PLAZA OR MALL THERE IN THE AREA.
AUTHORITIES CONFIRMING MOMENTS 
AGO, THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE 
DIED IN HIS WORDS, SEVERAL 
OTHERS INJURED, OUR THOUGHTS AND
PRAYERS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES OF
THE VICTIMS THERE AT THE 
NEWSPAPER TODAY.
HE ADDED THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN TO 
AREA HOSPITALS INCLUDING THE 
JOHNS HOPKINS TRAUMA WARD.
THE SHOOTER AT THIS HOUR IS IN 
CUSTODY, HE'S BEING QUESTIONED 
AT THIS TIME.
YOU HEARD AUTHORITIES ASK, WAS 
THE SHOOTER ON THEIR RADAR, DID 
HE HAVE A PREVIOUS RECORD OR 
HISTORY WITH POLICE, THEY DID 
NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS ON THE SCENE
FAIRLY QUICKLY, WITHIN 60 
SECONDS TO A MINUTE AND 30 
SECONDS OR SO.
THE RESPONSE WAS VERY QUICK, 
THEY ENGAGED THE SUSPECT ONCE 
THEY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.
WE ARE ALSO REPORTING THAT PHIL 
DAVIS WHO IS A COURT AND CRIME 
REPORTING FOR THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE, HE IS TWEETING, YOU SEE
IT RIGHT THERE ON THE SCREEN.
GUNMEN SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS 
DOOR TO THE OFFICE, AND OPENED 
FIRE ON MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES.
CAN'T SAY MUCH MORE, DON'T WANT 
TO DECLARE ANYONE DEAD, BUT IT'S
BAD.
THERE ARE SEVERAL DEAD, THOUGH.
HE GOES ON TO TWEET, THERE'S 
NOTHING MORE TERRIFYING THAN 
HEARING MULTIPLE PEOPLE GETTING 
SHOT WHILE YOU'RE UNDER YOUR 
DESK AND HEARING THE GUNMAN 
RELOAD.
THAT IS THE SCENE AT THE CAPITAL
GAZETTE, ANNAPOLIS MARYLAND, 
SEVERAL DEAD LATE TODAY.
SEVERAL INJURED, THEY HAVE BEEN 
RUSHED TO AREA HOSPITALS, YOU 
JUST HEARD THE COURT REPORTER 
AND CRIME REPORTER FILING A 
REPORT WITH THE PAPER ALREADY, 
IT'S WEATHER BEEN POSTED IN A 
SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEW.
HE DESCRIBES IT LIKE A WAR ZONE 
INSIDE THE NEWSPAPER'S OFFICE.
A SITUATION HE SAID WOULD BE 
HARD TO DESCRIBE FOR A WHILE.
I AM A POLICE REPORTER, I WRITE 
ABOUT THIS STUFF, NOT 
NECESSARILY TO THIS EXTENT.
BUT SHOOTINGS AND DEATHS ALL THE
TIME.
YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU'RE 
THERE, AND YOU FEEL HELPLESS, 
HIDING UNDER YOUR DESK.
HE ALSO DESCRIBES THE GUNMAN 
BEING ABLE TO HEAR HIM RELOAD, 
BUT THEN THE GUNMAN SUDDENLY 
STOPPED FIRING, HE SAYS, I DON'T
KNOW WHY, I DON'T KNOW WHY HE 
STOPPED, AND THEN POLICE 
ARRIVING, SURROUNDING THE 
SHOOTER, AS WE HEARD FROM 
AUTHORITIES MOMENTS AGO, THAT 
RESPONSE FROM A MINUTE, A MINUTE
AND A HALF OR SO.
ENGAGING WITH THE SHOOTER WHO IS
NOW BEING QUESTIONED AT THIS 
HOUR.
>> I'M DAVID MUIR HERE IN NEW 
YORK, WE'LL HAVE TEAM COVERAGE 
COMING UP FOR YOU TONIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU FOR WORLD NEWS 
TONIGHT.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
