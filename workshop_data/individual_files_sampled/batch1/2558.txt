my dad was an idea a minute kind of entrepreneur he had lots and lots of good ideas he had big ideas sadly he also had a flaw which is that he would expand either too quickly or without having first surrounded himself with a team of people who were way better at what they knew how to do and then he was he sadly would often surround himself with people who were great at making him feel like the big guy and I took both of those lessons for many many years I was right to take the second lesson to always surround myself with people who are way way better than I am way smarter but I think I made a big mistake to believe that the reason that he had two bankruptcies was because he expanded and so for that reason in a 30 year restaurant career I had one restaurant for the first 10 of those years and even Shake Shack which now has a hundred and one shacks around the world we had one Shack for the first five years and so I think an important lesson I learned was that growth itself does not need to mean that you have diminished your culture and certainly it doesn't put you out of business as a matter of fact I now believe that if you have the right kind of support that you sometimes need to expand in order to advance your culture and if you don't grow quickly enough or appropriately enough you're gonna lose the kind of talented people whose aspirations cannot be met by your small company so my big lesson was stop playing small but do continue to play wisely
