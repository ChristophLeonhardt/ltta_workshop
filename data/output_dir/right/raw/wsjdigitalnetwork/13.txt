1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,820
For years, China had been a global growth driver,

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,960
but that changed in the summer of 2015,

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,379
as a surprise devaluation of the yuan,

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,440
China’s currency, hit global markets.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,680
Their shifting currency policy

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,600
caused uncertainty for global policymakers,

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,820
so we decided to answer the big question

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,220
on everyone’s mind:

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,220
How does China set its exchange rate?

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,460
To navigate the secrecy of the Chinese government,

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,220
I had to get creative.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,340
I started with state-owned enterprises,

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,000
which often have big sway over policy.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,920
I persuaded executives to talk to me,

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,660
which opened the door to government advisors

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,840
and eventually to party officials.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,260
Based on interviews

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,780
with dozens of experts and insiders,

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,900
we offered a behind-the-scenes look

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,280
at the complex interests affecting China’s central bank.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,420
Ultimately,

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,560
we showed how China’s long-term goals

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,560
of a more global role for the yuan

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,220
was balanced against short-term financial pressures

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,120
across various industries,

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,760
a complex balancing act

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,560
on which China’s economic future depended.

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,800
Global affairs for decades to come

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,500
will depend on how China manages that scale,

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,100
and I look forward to covering all of it.

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,240
My name is Lingling Wei,

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,340
and I’m a China Correspondent

33
00:01:24,340 --> 00:00:00,000
for The Wall Street Journal.
