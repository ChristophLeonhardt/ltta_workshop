THE UNITED STATES, HE WILL BE IN THE EAST WING OF THE WHITE HOUSE ANY MOMENT, WE'LL GO NOW TO CATHERINE HERRIDGE. SEVERAL DEVICES FOUND IN NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, FLORIDA. CATHERINE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE AS THE LATEST? Reporter: DANA, AS YOU MENTIONED, WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE SUSPECT DEVICES RECOVERED ACROSS MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. I JUST WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHOTO OF THE DEVICE THAT WAS RECOVERED AT CNN. I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A COUPLE OF TELL-TALE SIGNS OF WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ALWAYS SAYS TO PAY ATTENTION TO ON THESE SUSPECT PACKAGES. THE EXCESSIVE POSTAGE. ALSO, THE EXCESSIVE PACKAGING AS WELL. YOU CAN JUST KIND OF SEE THAT. YELLOW TAPE. THEN ALSO WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS ALMOST A VERY SIMPLISTIC, ALMOST EXCESSIVE ADDRESS ON THAT PACKAGE. IT'S ADDRESSED TO THE FORMER CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN. HE IS AN ENDLESS CONTRIBUTOR FOR NBC, NOT CNN. BUT THE PACKAGE WAS RECOVERED. AS WE LEARNED EARLIER TODAY, IT WAS NOT JUST CONTAINING EXPLOSIVES, BUT ALSO A WHITE POWDER. THEY'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT IS SOMETHING SERIOUS LIKE ANTHRAX. LET'S LISTEN. RESPONDING OFFICERS IDENTIFIED A DEVICE THAT APPEARED TO BE A LIVE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. THE BOMB SQUAD RESPONDED, SECURED THE DEVICE AND REMOVED IT FOR INVESTIGATION. ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS AN ENVELOPE CONTAINING WHITE POWDER THAT WAS DISCOVERED AS PART OF THAT ORIGINAL PACKAGING. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF INVESTIGATING THAT RIGHT NOW. Reporter: IT MADE HEADLINES, OFFICIALS CONFIRMING THAT THERE WERE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE DEVICE THAT WAS RECOVERED IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK, AS WELL AS THE DEVICE SENT TO FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AT HIS RESIDENCE HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AS YOU'VE EMPHASIZED, THESE DEVICES WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE SECRET SERVICE SCREENING OF MAIL. THAT'S ROUTINE. SO IT NEVER REACHED THE RESIDENCE IN QUESTION. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TARGETED, THEY WERE TARGETED BY THE SAME PERSON OR PERSONS IS THAT THEY ARE HIGH PROFILE DEMOCRATS. BUT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS ANY KIND OF POLITICAL MOTIVATION. BUT AT THE NEWS CONFERENCE EARLIER TODAY, THEY TALKED ABOUT TERRORISM, WHICH IS AN ACT OF VIOLENCE TO PROMOTE POLITICAL. AND THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE TENSE ENVIRONMENT LEADING UP TO THE MIDTERMS. LET'S LISTEN. THIS IS A POLITICAL YEAR. IT'S A POLITICAL SEASON. WE ARE WEEKS FROM AN ELECTION. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IN THE AIR. THAT'S AN OBVIOUS FACTOR. KEEPING THE DEBATE AND THE DIALOGUE CIVIL IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. AND FOR ELECTED LEADERS WHO IN MANY WAYS SET THE TONE, IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. Reporter: JUST IN CLOSING, GOVERNOR CUOMO ALSO CONFIRMED LITERALLY IN REAL-TIME DURING THAT NEWS CONFERENCE THAT A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE HAD ALSO BEEN RECEIVED AT HIS OFFICE AND IT WAS BEING INVESTIGATED. HE ADDED THAT HE ANTICIPATED THAT THERE COULD BE MORE DEVICES IN THE DAYS OR WEEKS AHEAD. IN OTHER WORDS, THAT HE WAS CONCERNED THIS MAY JUST BE THE FIRST WAVE OF SOMETHING BIGGER,
