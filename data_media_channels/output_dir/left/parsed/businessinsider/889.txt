the coolest thing in here is the ability
to have a 360 degree view we're in New
York can you look over the borough of
Brooklyn and see the Atlantic Ocean or
go out look to the east and watch the
planes land in LaGuardia I actually
think that this is kind of a one-off
because the combination of the zoning
constraints thank God in the center of
the city really limits the ability of
anyone else to build tall thin
skyscrapers
