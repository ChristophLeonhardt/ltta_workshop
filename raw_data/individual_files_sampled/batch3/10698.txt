Frances Minister of Culture has attempted to dispel rising concerns about president McConnell's plan to tackle fake news France versus Neeson said the national media regulator as well as judges would be in charge of enforcing the new law on the one hand you have the CSA and on the other judges so it's not the executive there will be getting involved macarons proposal to crack down on fate news came a week ago however it immediately sparked a backlash with many doubting the government's not getting involved in the process between fake news machines and the professional media we run the risk of losing the truth the barriers have been destroyed presidential campaigns in almost all modern democracies have displayed their weakness and our collective failure to come up with a response I will say that the first ones who make fake news are the presidential candidates who do not keep their promises this is the real fake news that should be banned we'll take care of it is there going to be an anti fake news brigade or something this low here is it not a repressive law since we go more and more in this direction we forbid everything will prevent it from thinking so much that we no longer know how to think for ourselves will almost always come back to George Orwell's novel 1984 with the Ministry of misinformation I really feel like we're ready there and the people outside of it independent journalists nuclear vais says the crackdown on fake news is misguided even it at all I mean first if it goes through the judges it's not reassuring because most of the judges in France are on the left the sandy Katla magista to you for example they put a few years ago to the wall of the idiots or remove the king on which they they put sarkozy victims were complaining about bad sentences and things because they are on the left they know better so if they have to judge on what is a fake news it will always be the same that are condemned they feed us things which are not true so he cannot speak about a propaganda he is the champion of it the propaganda that mr. macro himself uses as the world the e says that the press is the victim is the first victim of propaganda no we citizens are the first victim of the propaganda that he organizes
