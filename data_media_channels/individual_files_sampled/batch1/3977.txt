hello my name is Angus Kennedy I'm a writer I'm an author I'm the editor of a magazine that a chocolate industry and my job is to taste chocolates they're quite an easy way of checking chocolate I've got two - chocolate pals here one is like a Stannis of milk chocolate perhaps the sort of lower end type of chocolate and one is a more of a sort of higher end higher cocoa butter higher cocoa percentage so this one is actually a 70% cocoa this is probably around to the 40 something percent there's a really really sure way of doing this so what you do is you get a piece of your bar and you just like kind of just snap it off so just listen to that I'll do it again right that's the sort of sort you can just about hear that now this is a sort of a much higher cocoa butter content so it actually sort of sets harder so it should make a different noise I'd like to kind of click that was quite a big difference so that's actually quite easier then of course you go heat it this is a fun bit so the higher quality chocolate tends to sort of make a bit of a click and harder for the noise because it doesn't melt so quickly and it's just got less sugar got less vegetable fat in it and when you meet it it should taste a little bit fruity cuz the cocoa bean is actually very fruity product so it only depends on how much they roast it that gives it that bit of flavor so cocoa beans actually mistakenly are said to be bitter but it only depends how long you roast them and ferment them for but I think having said all that you know I was brought up on this stuff so I believe this any day
