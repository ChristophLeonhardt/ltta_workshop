A PROTEST FRIDAY OUTSIDE THE U.S. EMBASSY IN SEOUL PUSHING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO GO AHEAD WITH THE POSSIBLE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN. ONE SIGN OF THE REGION WATCHING CLOSELY THE BACK AND FORTH OVER THE PROPOSED KIM-TRUMP MEETING. CHINA REACTING TO THE SUMMIT TALK. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCUSED CHINESE PRESIDENT XI OF TURNING KIM JONG UN AGAINST THE U.S. WE REALLY HOPE THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA CAN CHERISH THE RECENT AND POSITIVE PROCESS, EXERCISE PATIENCE, SHOW GOODWILL AND MEET EACH OTHER HALFWAY. PRIME MINISTER ABE A STRONG ALLY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE RESPECTS ANY DECISION FROM D.C. AS LONG AS IT REDS NORTH KOREA OF NUKES. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A SUMMIT THAT BECOMES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS AND MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON THE NUCLEAR AND MISSILE PROBLEM. STILL, AS KIM JONG UN WAS SEEN FRY INSPECTING A RAIL LINE, HIS REGIME SEEMS TO BE GOING IN A COUPLE OF DIRECTIONS, TOO. VICE FOREIGN MINISTER A KEY VOICE ON U.S. MATTERS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AGGRESSIVE EARLIER STATEMENT. BRANDING VICE PRESIDENT PENCE A POLITICAL DUMMY.
