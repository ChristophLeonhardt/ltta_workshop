the DEA has arrested dozens of individuals who they believe are involved in the over prescription of painkillers and opioids now there have been 28 people arrested none of them are people working in the pharmaceutical companies all of them are either pharmacists or distributors so let me give you the details on that the Drug Enforcement Administration arrested 28 prescribers and pharmacists and revoked the licenses of 147 people who handle controlled substances now when it comes to the revoking of those licenses it's basically when the DEA has some evidence indicating that they're doing something unlawful but they could get their licenses back if they prove that they didn't act in any unlawful way now it did not appear that the effort targeted any of the drug distributors or manufacturers that have been blamed for allowing hundreds of millions of opioid painkillers to pour out of the legitimate supply chain into the black market over the past 15 years yeah so let's talk a little bit about the distributors because that's actually an important part of this story last year the Washington Post did a fantastic job reporting about how members of Congress aggressively pushed for and successfully passed legislation that stripped the DEA of its ability to go after these distributors previously the the DEA had the ability to you know enforce the law and and see whether or not these distributors were selling or distributing a huge amount of opioids or narcotics to these pharmacies but under this new law which again passed in 2016 they were stripped of the ability to do that jeff sessions to his credit is working pretty aggressively to overturn that law because he wants to give the DEA its power back to go after these distributors now let's talk about the pharmaceutical companies of course the pharmaceutical companies haven't been targeted I mean there's no excuse when it comes to that no one in the Trump administration is going after big pharma and big pharma is the root of the problem so I'll give them a a bit of a past when it comes to the distributors but no past at all when it comes to the pharmaceutical companies yeah so I I don't mind going after doctors that over prescribing the medicine and and pharmacists etcetera and that's a lot more logical but than what Trump and Carlsen etc have been saying on Fox News and about how its Mexico what type of crosses just said we had 60,000 opioid deaths just last night on the program he said because of the Mexicans no there's no Mexicans running pharmaceutical companies so the opioids have are not brought in from outside the country they're made here and to the point Anna was bringing about distributors you know this was her story we did a little while back so I don't have the exact numbers in front of me but I believe they brought in about 20 million pills into a West Virginia town of about 3,000 people so did they know the distributor's hey I wonder if these 3,000 people in this town can really handle 20 million pills in a matter of a couple of years and of course they knew what they were doing of course they're culpable in that sense and they knew that it was causing addiction and they profited off of it but when it comes to the the head honchos the ones that actually making the drugs well they're untouchable why number one donors to politicians in the country more than oil companies more than the bankers more than anyone else the drug companies and we have an open option in our country as you know you can just buy any politician it's private financing and so they just buy them and so they go get out of jail free card we know you're the ones who are doing it but we'll blame Mexico and from time to time we'll go after the doctors or the pharmacists and maybe we'll get to the distributors later but you guys are untouchable right and I just wanted to make sure you guys had the info about the law that was passed in 2016 that protected these distributors first of all it was co-authored by representative Tom Marino who's a Republican senator Orrin was a Republican they aggressively pushed for it and it was ironically named the ensuring patient access and effective drug Enforcement Act of 26 was right and by the way Mitch McConnell voted in favor of it and later after that Washington Post 60 minutes story broke he was asked about it and he was shocked he said that he didn't realize that the legislation had this type of wording it was a three page bill and he didn't read it well read it of course he didn't read it and they keep saying how the Democrats didn't read the Affordable Care Act a bunch of liars none of them read any of the bills but much more importantly I am greatly amused by the idea of Mitch McConnell coming in here there's 'gambling in this establishment I am just shocked you mean to tell me that my Republican Party has been being bribed legally through private financing of Elections for all these years oh and the pharmaceutical companies are number one donors well I am shocked to find that out well Mitch I'm sure you are but to the rest of us we think Mitch please if you want to get the whole young
