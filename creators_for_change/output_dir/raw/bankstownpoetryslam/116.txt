her and leave him to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a perspective life</font>

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,180
that's dim his once bright eyes glazed

behind the haze of confusion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,860
infusion of emotion I can barely contain

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,850
uses a vocabulary not flourishing but

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,250
which he have uses this this he pleads

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,200
again and again and lead with the sorrow

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">I feel hollow I can't help him this this</font>

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,570
he persists my consciousness resists the

urge of patients who sprayed and snap a

course left in my face as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as his</font>

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,660
but I taste the foot away just as he in

him i know i've lost a battle a constant

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,619
battle against my skull wormy them whole

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,700
to stay afloat so I dig a moat around

myself and distance him from me but fail

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,159
to see how I hurt him just as I hurt his

gentle nature his soft hands and big

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,659
eyes and his walk it's just like yours

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,000
they say but<font color="#E5E5E5"> still he just won't talk no</font>

matter how we pray he gets frustrated
