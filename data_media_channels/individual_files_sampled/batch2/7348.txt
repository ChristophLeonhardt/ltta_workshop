Blasi Ford and Brett Cavanaugh's testimony there was an exchange between senator Klobuchar and Kavanagh that caught a lot of attention it was controversial in fact it was so controversial that later Cavanaugh had to apologize following a recess during the hearing but I want to show you that exchange so you can remember and then I'm gonna update you with what Lindsey Graham has just said about that exchange take a look I remember what happened and I think you've probably dead beer Center and and so far you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before a part of what happened that's you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you could you answer the question judge I just to you that's not happened is that your answer yeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking problem nor do i yeah look I've said this a thousand times before if I was wrongly accused I'd be snappy to if you believe he was wrongly accused which I do not but it's it's not good form even like if you're having an emotional day by the way he then let's note for the record that if he was a woman and he was having an emotional day when he's applying for a Supreme Court position probably wouldn't have gone as well for him okay but to turn around to a senator and be like oh yeah do you have a drinking problem haha do you ever black hat well it's not exactly the temperature or temperament of a Supreme Court justice right I mean the fact that he didn't seem to get it while he was doing it was almost weird and in he's otherwise a bright guy he's got a mass of other issues no but here's the thing look people are emotional I get that but one of the qualities that our Supreme Court justices are supposed to have is that dispassionately protect our constitution enforce our Constitution if he's this overwhelmed with emotion while senator Klobuchar is asking him a simple question about his drinking habits by the way you're innocent great opportunity to talk about your drinking habits and say hey you know what instead of lying which she did several times throughout this hearing I did enjoy beer when I was in college I did enjoy beer when I was in high school yes but I I never experienced being blackout drunk moving on right it's a relevant question considering the accusations against him no he had to go further look he said I like beer like 29 times but he kept denying that he drank excessively when there's it's all over the record that you would you know projectile vomit than that you know non-stop obnoxious drinking etc it's but it's still a layup if if kolba try ask me that question I have you ever trained to assess absolutely have you ever blacked out no no I'm never I've never blacked out I haven't so it's an easy answer I wouldn't get testy about that because it's easy I've never blacked out right asked and answered but he's obviously testy about it right and also just oh the optics of it do matter right you're you're being questioned by a female senator and when you snap back at her like that it doesn't look good it doesn't considering the charges against you I'm not saying that he's treating her that way because she's a woman I'm saying that when you do react to her that way the optics look especially bad considering the charges against you right that's what I'm trying to say okay so then he realized it was a bad idea and he even apologized for it after a recess take a look started my last colloquy by saying to Sarah Colonna char how much I respect her and respect to what she did the last hearing and she asked me a question at the end that I responded by asking her a question and I didn't sorry I did that this is a tough process I'm sorry about that I appreciate that I would like dad when you have a parent that's alcoholic you're pretty careful about drinking okay that's fine he apologized okay that's good that is good exactly so now Lindsey Graham he reflects back on this exchange and here's what he has to say about it this is the one that bothers me the most he apologized to Amy Klobuchar for snapping at him at her what would you do if you were accused of all these things had your life ruined here's what I think Amy Klobuchar should apologize to judge Kavanaugh and his family for being part of a smear campaign I haven't seen in over 20 years in politics your campaigns are very serious sometimes also delicious yeah you want to make sure you get the right schmear for the bagel yeah um anyway but so Amy Klobuchar who asked a perfectly fine question given the context of the accusations against him should be the one who apologizes to him after he snapped at her yeah yeah they just they're not getting it it's and they just go on and on and pile on oh yo yeah that female senator should apologize to the guy because she believed a sexual assault survivor and she should apologize for asking him any questions at all okay Lindsay that's how you want to roll you know what Trump did do that I guess could be seen as a positive depending on how voters react to it moving forward you know before Trump we thought Republicans in Congress whether in the center house of Republicans House Republican House of Representatives they're just typical Republicans conservative they disagree with us on policy but they're not monsters at least not all of them right they're just different in terms of their perspective on how to run the country but no Trump has emboldened people like Lindsey Graham to be publicly open about what kind of monster he really is yeah well look remember lazy Graham's the guy who who's never met a war he didn't want to make out with and so he recently said about North Korea it's like yeah but if the war starts most of the people die over there not here meaning not just North Korea but our allies in South Korea totally indifferent to their lives that's the kind of monster Lindsey Graham is in fact the one time that he got upset with Trump and he just did it yeah yesterday in another discussion he said he he has that Trump has to cut out that love crap with kim jeong-hoon and I you know I did a video about this over the weekend trumpeter rally said that he fell in love with Kim jong-un so he'll attack sexual assault survivors but fall in love with dictators gee I wonder if he's a bad guy can't quite tell but Lindsey Graham doesn't like that because he wants war so he just he's like no no you should keep attacking camera-shy when you attack everyone and and why is Lizzie Graham suck enough to trump so much well he lost all his buddies right so Joe Lieberman was one of the three amigos with Graham and McCain Lieberman got run out of the Senate and then after he left they brought in Kelly Ayotte to be another war monger she lost so he's she's got and then obviously McCain just passed away so he's looking for an alpha they attached himself to he's looking for a friend okay that's so sad and and so that's but that's who Lindsey Graham is he's a sad little suck-up and so he's looking for an alpha to suck up to and so but but they he doesn't have quite the courage to start a fight without an alpha so he look like let's go get him let's see we should attack right who cares if the other guys like come on let's go get him right and now he's trying to you know slither up to Donald Trump and start wars with him Lindsey Graham one of the saddest guys in the country like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young
