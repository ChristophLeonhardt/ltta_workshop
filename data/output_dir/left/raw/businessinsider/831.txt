1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,629
it is our policy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a unified Syria</font>

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:05,609
that is governed by the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Syria</font>

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,059
I think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's clear to all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reign of the Assad family is</font>

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,190
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an end but the question of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ends and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transition itself</font>

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,020
could be very important in our view to

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,769
the durability the stability inside of a

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">unified Syria and and its stability and</font>

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,789
durability of the outcome going forward

11
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:32,070
so that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not presupposing</font>

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,070
how that occurs but I think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,309
that we see no for the role for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

14
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,219
Assad regime longer term given that they

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,829
have effectively given up their

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,930
legitimacy with these type of attacks I

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,039
think it's also worth thinking about

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,329
Russia has really aligned itself with

19
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Assad regime the Iranians and</font>

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,890
Hezbollah is that a is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term</font>

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,510
alliance the service of Russia's

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,950
interest or would Russia<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer to</font>

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,250
realign with the United States with

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,189
other Western countries and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Middle East</font>

25
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,350
countries who are seeking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to resolve the</font>

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,869
Syrian crisis we want to relieve the

27
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,420
suffering of the Syrian people we want

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,150
to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a future for Syria that is</font>

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,930
stable and secure and so Russia can be a

30
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,659
part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that future and play an</font>

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,540
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> role or Russia can maintain</font>

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,710
its alliance with this group which we

33
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,200
believe is not going to serve Russia's

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">interests longer term but only Russia</font>

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:00:00,000
can answer that question
