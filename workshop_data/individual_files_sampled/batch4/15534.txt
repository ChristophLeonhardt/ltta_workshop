think tanks in the UK and the US have suggested we could rewrite the rules of global trade after brexit a new report by free-market think tanks in the UK in the US has suggested that after brags it the UK could simply rewrite the rules of global trade by setting up a free trade agreement with the USA sounds good to me the report headlined the ideal US UK free-trade agreement a free traders perspective explains how a deal could be struck with the u.s. once we leave the European Union while presuming we leave the European Union that is it says that a free trade agreement should aim for a full and fast trade liberalisation and that we should just cut all tariffs or at least get the tariffs as close to zero as we can dan Hannon MEP for the Tories you've probably heard of him throughout three free-market thinker spoken about this recently in a piece in The Washington Examiner explaining its core idea is simple what is legal in one country should automatically be legal in the other mutual recognition should cover goods services and professional qualifications if a drug is approved by the FDA then it should be good enough for the Brits if a trader can practice in the City of London he should be free to work on Wall Street where there are different standards businesses should be free to follow whichever they prefer something that will lead unprecedented ly to downward pressure on regulations and why stop at the US and Britain there are other english-speaking common-law countries whose systems of corporate government and professional credentials resemble ours shouldn't we aim to extend mutual recognition to all countries with interoperable systems and equivalent levels of GDP per head such as Canada Hong Kong Singapore Australia and New Zealand and what about Israel which is often forgot about but which has the same common law as the others and is for business purposes effectively English speaking something along the lines of what we're proposing already exists between Australia and New Zealand and is arguably the most successful trade deal on the planet doesn't that sound amazing working more with the Commonwealth and other english-speaking countries across world in other countries with large GDP s with other first world countries essentially modern forward-thinking countries with high professional standards high regulatory standards and trading with them as he says it works for Australia in New Zealand and it can work for us as well so why all the doom and gloom about brexit when it's clear that there's a simple and innovative way for us to trade with the world without being in the e u 's political union well it's revenge pure and simple they're gonna keep lying and throwing their toys out of the pram about the EU until until we rejoin I don't think that's going to happen though if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
