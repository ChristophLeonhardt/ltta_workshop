THINGS THAT ARE LUDICROUS THAT

123
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:55,770

I DON'T THINK IT HELPS THEM IN

187
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:45,714

00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:49,318
TO REACT OF SOUND ON TAPE OF

190
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:50,019
DONALD TRUMP REACTING TO THIS?

191
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,955
WHY DON'T WE DO THAT?

192
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:54,690
I WANTED TO ASK FIRST.

193
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,959
>> I SAY IT'S A VERY SCARY TIME

194
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,693
FOR YOUNG MEN IN AMERICA WHEN

195
00:05:57,693 --> 00:06:00,663
YOU CAN BE GUILTY OF SOMETHING

196
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:03,299
THAT YOU MAY NOT BE GUILTY OF.

197
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:06,669
THIS IS A VERY, VERY, VERY

198
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:08,904
DIFFICULT TIME.

199
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:10,940
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE HAS MUCH

200
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,441
MORE TO DO THAN EVEN THE

201
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:14,410
APPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME COURT

202
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:14,744
JUSTICE.

203
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:18,748
>> Jesse: I THINK HE HIT THE

204
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:19,715
NAIL ON THE HEAD.

205
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:20,716
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING.

206
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,418
I DON'T THINK MEN IN THIS

207
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:23,119
COUNTRY ARE THAT MUCH UNDER

208
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,753
ASSAULT.

209
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:25,554
HE HAS A GOOD POINT THAT ANY

210
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:26,222
ALLEGATION CAN BRING ANYBODY

211
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:27,323
DOWN IF THIS IS THE ENVIRONMENT

212
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:29,625
WE ARE LIVING IN.

213
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,926
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT.

214
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:32,561
SOMEONE THROWS ICE AT SOMEONE AT

215
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:33,896
A BAR AND DEMOCRATS WANT THE FBI

216
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:37,933
TO INVESTIGATE.

217
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:38,634
HILLARY CLINTON'S CLASSIFIED

218
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:39,435
EMAILS WIND UP ON ANTHONY

219
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,370
WINTERS LAPTOP TWO WEEKS BEFORE

220
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,439
THE ELECTION THE DEMOCRATS SAY

221
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,407
NO, FBI.

222
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:44,907
DON'T INVESTIGATE.

223
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,776
THE MORE AND MORE I HEAR ABOUT

224
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:47,510
BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE MORE AND

225
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,745
MORE I KIND OF LIKE BRETT

226
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:50,112
KAVANAUGH.

227
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:51,013
BRETT KAVANAUGH LIKES BEER.

228
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:53,115
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE COME OUT

229
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:53,649
AGAINST THEATER.

230
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,918
THINK ABOUT THAT.

231
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:56,919
>> Greg: AND ICE.

232
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,254
>> Jesse: THIS IS PROBABLY THE

233
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,188
DUMBEST THING THEY DID SINCE

234
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:01,157
THEY CAME OUT AGAINST THE

235
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,492
NATIONAL ANTHEM LAST YEAR.

236
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:04,527
TERRIBLE POLITICS.

237
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:05,895
SOUNDS LIKE THEY WANT TO BRING

238
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:06,929
BACK PROHIBITION.

239
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,598
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED, TED

240
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:10,199
KENNEDY HAD A FEW DRINKS AND

241
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,136
THINGS DIDN'T GO TOO WELL.

242
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:13,769
BILL CLINTON WAS CREDIBLY

243
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,739
ACCUSED OF RAPE BY JUANITA

244
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,407
BROADDRICK AND REMEMBER HOW NBC

245
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:18,841
TREATED THAT?

246
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:21,244
THEY SPIKED THE 18 A BRODERICK

247
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:22,745
STORY AND THEY WENT FULL ON WITH

248
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:26,916
THIS WOMAN'S CLAIMS IN THIS

249
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,084
WOMAN IS BEING RUN, AS YOU CALL

250
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:34,357
HIM, THE CREEPY PORN LAWYER.

251
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:37,093
RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT.

252
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:38,494
NONE OF HER ALIBIS CHECK OUT.

253
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:41,731
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF AND BE

254
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:42,432
NEWS SPIKED THE RONAN FARROW

255
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:44,434
STORY AND THEY GO WITH THIS?

256
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:49,539
THEY HAVE NO STANDARDS.

257
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,441
>> Greg: JUAN, YOU CAN RESPOND

258
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:54,911
TO JESSE OR ANSWER MY QUESTION.

259
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:56,713
ISN'T AVENATTI THE BEST THING

260
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,114
THAT COULD HAPPEN TO

261
00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:58,514
REPUBLICANS?

262
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:00,249
>> Juan: THEY ARE CERTAINLY

263
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,551
MAKING HIM INTO THAT.

264
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:03,853
>> Greg: HAS HE DONE ANYTHING

265
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,389
GOOD FOR THE DEMOCRATS?

266
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:08,158
>> Juan: AVENATTI HAS STORMY

267
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:08,491
DANIELS.

268
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:13,263
LET ME SAY JESSE'S AFFECTION FOR

269
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:14,164
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AS A FELLOW

270
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:16,933
FRAT BOY.

271
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,101
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

272
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:20,136
THIS STORY, UNLIKE WHAT YOU ARE

273
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:21,738
TALKING ABOUT, IS ABOUT THE

274
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:22,739
JUDGES CREDIBILITY.

275
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,208
IF HE IS IN THE BAR ENGAGING IN

276
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,711
BAR FIGHTS ON THROWING ICE, THIS

277
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,746
IS A GUY WHO SAYS HE WAS A CHOIR

278
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:30,046
BOY.

279
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:32,048
HE SAID NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS

280
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:32,414
GOING ON.

281
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:33,216
>> Greg: HE NEVER SAID HE WAS

282
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:36,419
A CHOIR BOY.

283
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,721
>> Juan: THE PRESIDENT'S

284
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:40,323
COMMENTS, THESE ARE SCARIER

285
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,125
TIMES, SCARY TIMES FOR YOUNG

286
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:42,392
MEN.

287
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:44,327
THEN DON JR. IS ON RECORD SAYING

288
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:45,595
HE'S MORE AFRAID FOR HIS SONS

289
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:48,131
THEN HE IS FOR HIS DAUGHTERS.

290
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:48,932
WOW.

291
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:51,034
IN OTHER WORDS, PROFESSOR FORD,

292
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:53,403
WHO STEPS FORWARD, PUTS HER NAME

293
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:57,140
OUT THERE, COMES FORWARD AND

294
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,108
TESTIFIES BEFORE CONGRESS,

295
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:58,575
PROFESSOR FORD.

296
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:00,710
YOUR TRAUMA, YOUR DIFFICULTY,

297
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,545
YOUR LIFETIME OF TRAUMA --

298
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,513
STROKE WHAT WE ARE REALLY

299
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:04,181
WORRIED ABOUT HIS BOYS.

300
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:07,217
HOW RIDICULOUS?

301
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:09,119
>> Greg: JUAN, YOU HAVE SONS.

302
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,054
WOULDN'T YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE

303
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:11,955
DUE PROCESS.

304
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:13,957
>> Juan: HE WAS NOT CHARGED

305
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:14,491
WITH THE CRIME.

306
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:15,959
>> Greg: COURT OF PUBLIC

307
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:16,660
OPINION MAY BE WORSE.

308
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,961
>> Juan: HERE'S THE THING.

309
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:20,197
IF YOU PUT SOMEONE ON.

310
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:22,032
YOU SAY DID HE LIE?

311
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:34,211
HE SAYS --

312
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:34,911
SPECIFICALLY HE SAID HE HAD NO

313
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:35,646
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS NEW YORKER

314
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,346
ARTICLE AND THEN IT TURNS OUT

315
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:36,747
GUESS WHAT.

316
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:37,447
HE IS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO

317
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:37,781
REFUTE.

318
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:38,715
>> Dana: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

319
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:39,983
>> Tucker: MANY SAY THIS IS

320
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:40,918
NOT A LEGAL PROCEEDING.

321
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:42,386
IT'S A JOB INTERVIEW.

322
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:43,820
DUE PROCESS DOESN'T APPLY.

323
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,155
THE RULES OF BASIC FAIRNESS

324
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:45,556
DON'T APPLY.

325
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:48,525
IS THAT THE STANDARD YOU WANT?

326
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,727
HOLD ON.

327
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:52,396
FOR DUE PROCESS, IT'S A LEGAL

328
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:53,096
TERM FOR FAIRNESS.

329
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,731
IF I ACCUSE YOU OF SOMETHING, I

330
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:56,200
HAVE TO SHOW YOU DID IT.

331
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,100
THAT DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO

332
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,936
COURT.

333
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,704
IT APPLIES TO HOW YOU RAISE YOUR

334
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:01,839
KID AND HOW YOU DEAL WITH YOUR

335
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,340
WIFE AND YOUR COWORKERS.

336
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,408
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

337
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:06,310
STATEMENT?

338
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,244
>> Juan: IT'S SUSPENDING THE

339
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:11,114
IDEA THAT SOMEHOW YOU HAVE THE

340
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:12,115
RULES OF A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING.

341
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:13,717
>> Tucker: IT'S A VERY SIMPLE

342
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:14,618
RULE.

343
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,220
HOLD ON.

344
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,222
A SENATOR SAYS YOU ARE ACCUSED.

345
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:19,290
PROVE YOU ARE INNOCENT.

346
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,691
>> Juan: NO, IT'S NOT.

347
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:22,559
>> Tucker: THEY SAID THAT OUT

348
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,294
LOUD.

349
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:24,928
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT?

350
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:27,898
>> Juan: YOU ARE DISTORTING

351
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:28,299
THAT.

352
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,301
YOU ARE NOT AS ATTRACTIVE AS

353
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,702
MOST PEOPLE WHO SIT IN THAT

354
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:32,303
YEAR.

355
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,003
>> Greg: I FIND THAT TO BE A

356
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:36,373
BIT SEXIST.

357
00:10:36,373 --> 00:10:40,477
DANA NEEDS TO CLARIFY.

358
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:40,878
LET DANA.

359
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,780
DANA NEEDS TO CLARIFY.

360
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,447
>> Dana: THERE IS SOMETHING

361
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:47,217
THAT'S UNFAIR ABOUT THIS

362
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:47,952
SUGGESTION THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH

363
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:50,487
WAS TRYING TO COACH PEOPLE

364
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:51,722
THROUGH TEXT MESSAGES THAT THEY

365
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:54,892
WOULD CORROBORATE A STORY IN THE

366
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:55,292
NEW YORKER.

367
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,093
IT'S NOT THE CASE.

368
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:57,828
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

369
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:01,132
HAVING BEEN THE SPOKESPERSON FOR

370
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:01,932
ROBERTS AND ALITO.

371
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:03,400
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE SO MANY

372
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,902
PRESS QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS

373
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:06,103
THAT MIGHT'VE HAPPENED,

374
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:06,804
JOHN ROBERTS, THE BIG SCANDAL

375
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:09,974
WAS THAT HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE

376
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:10,508
FEDERALIST SOCIETY.

377
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:11,542
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

378
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:12,743
I'VE GOT A CALL, WAS

379
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,545
JOHN ROBERTS A MEMBER OF THE

380
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:15,079
FEDERALIST SOCIETY?

381
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:16,981
WHAT HAPPENED, DO THEY GIVE A

382
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:17,748
SPEECH?

383
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:19,350
YES, I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT IT.

384
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,551
IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING

385
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,420
TO SQUASH THE STORY AND THAT'S

386
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,954
UNFAIR.

387
00:11:22,954 --> 00:11:24,021
>> Juan: NO IT'S NOT.

388
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:25,089
>> Dana: YES, IT IS.

389
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:25,756
>> Juan: I THOUGHT YOU WERE

390
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:27,325
GOING TO SAY IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

391
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:28,759
THE REPORTER FROM THE NEW YORKER

392
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,927
WAS IN TOUCH WITH HIS ADVISORS

393
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:31,762
AND MAY BE HIM THEN HE REACHED

394
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:33,931
OUT TO PEOPLE.

395
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,533
REMEMBER, DANA, HE TESTIFIED

396
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,302
THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS

397
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:39,270
UNTIL THE NEW YORKER.

398
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,471
>> Jesse: HE TESTIFIED HE

399
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,772
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE SPECIFIC

400
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:42,573
ALLEGATION WAS.

401
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:44,509
HE HAD GOTTEN WIND THAT THIS

402
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:45,276
WOMAN WAS CALLING AROUND.

403
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:47,011
YOU KNOW WHY SHE WAS CALLING

404
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:47,345
AROUND?

405
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:49,013
SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS

406
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:49,380
KAVANAUGH.

407
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,482
SHE WAS SAYING TO HER FRIENDS,

408
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:52,517
WASN'T KAVANAUGH?

409
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:53,317
NOT SURE.

410
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:54,986
HE'D GOTTEN WIND SOMETHING WAS

411
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:55,687
COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE SO HE

412
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,221
SAID TO SOME OF HIS BUDDIES, I

413
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:57,789
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

414
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,224
LET'S MAKE SURE I DIDN'T DO

415
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:01,526
ANYTHING.

416
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:02,493
[ALL SPEAKING]

417
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:03,895
>> Greg: WE'VE GOT TO GO.

418
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:06,431
I LIKE THE FACT THAT JESSE IS

419
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:10,368
DOING THE OLD SYMBOL FOR A

420
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:11,169
TELEPHONE.

421
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:12,603
[LAUGHTER]

422
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:14,872
>> Juan: ONE LAST THING.

423
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,274
TOO MUCH FOR YOU, GREG.

424
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,443
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE OTHER

425
00:12:18,443 --> 00:00:00,000
SIDE.
