the fight of our healthcare is taking center stage and incumbent West Virginia senator joe Manchin's reelection campaign so much so that a lawsuit filed in texas aimed to block the affordable care act is the focus of a new ad by mansion that we are showing for the first time exclusively on Morning Joe that's me shooting the cap and trade bill because it was bad for Western teeth hey I haven't changed I might be a few years older but I'll still take on anyone that messes with West Virginia now the threat is Patrick morsi's lawsuit to take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions he is just dead wrong and that ain't going to happen I'm Joe Manchin and I approve this message because for me it's all about West Virginia alright looking right over the barrel of a gun Joe Manchin joining us right now thanks for being on it's good to have you back so Donald Trump won your state by 40 points why do you think you're ahead in the polls well first of all I mean this is not new for me you know in 2012 when I ran for the first full term after Bob Byrd Senator Barbara Byrd died in 2010 Mitt Romney won my state by 35 points he beat Barack Obama by 35 points in 2012 when I was running and I won by over 20 opposed to 25 points almost a 60 point swing so West Virginians they go and basically the person they know Joe help me out here so again Donald Trump on your state by 40 we're hearing that people are getting more and more liberal more and more conservative that going into their camps they'll never vote for a Republican presidential candidate but or a Democratic congressman congressman or senator and yet you look what's happening in West Virginia with you you see Joe Donnelly is doing pretty well in Indiana Democrat in a very red state and you see you feel President doing really well that guy's got approval rating that I mean anybody would love to have right now what seems to be the secret for Democrats doing well in red states or I guess you could say vice versa well how would a Republican do well in blue states well hey Joe the party really shouldn't change who we are I mean if you're a Democrat or Republican you have an RD by your name you're still the same person if you try to change and I've always said this a West Virginian can shake your hand look in your eyes and see your soul you can pull it these are hardworking people they've hustled all their lives they had to get by by their own skill sets in their own good common sense and they want someone who's real who's someone who believes in what's genu who understands Westford you knows who we are that whole ad basically what it reflected back on Joe's I'm the same person I've always been this because I'm in Washington I'm in West Virginia every week and I come home oh here's much as I possibly can and I enjoy every minute I'm home but people know that I'm all about West Virginia so that's not going to change me Washington's not going to change me no one's going to change me I want work with the president when it's good for us to you and I vote with 67 percent at the time but I work with Virginian I vote for West Virginia 100% of the time that's what they're wanting in this help this health care pre-existing condition job I have about million eight hundred thousand people living my beautiful state of West Virginia eight thousand have been identified with some sort of crazy condition you say you want to represent the state of West Virginia and you know the people if you're going to throw eight hundred thousand people and for just absolute chaos that's the I think that matters 400,000 was for Ginny ins Joe wouldn't even be able to buy insurance because insurance company can it's not profitable enough and we're not going to show you at all and the other 400 would be rates so high or they put caps on that's not how we should be going and you should be looking at fix things we have effect for the health care bill and in West Virginia 80% of people benefit by the Affordable Care Act twenty percent of people getting screwed to the wall I've cretins private brought my private insurance and we have a fix for that after John McCain said historically that night what about vlogging pointing he put his thumb down said no John fussing saying that bill could be fixed here the bill be done this way or that way John saying there's no process minority I know whatsoever so the next day but Lamar Alexander and under patty Murray we had twelve East before a 12o Republican work together for instance package it's been sitting on mitch mcconnell's deaths from was to hear that would fix the people that are paying too high extreme rates it would break him down twenty thirty percent over night that's when we say Washington sucks because answers yeah and NATO that yeah H oh so we had a conversation onset Friday we were talking about what voters seem to care about and what voters didn't seem to care about now we and I said if you look at the verb eighths for a lot of polls even though they're important issues certainly important issues to protect democracy to protect their ballots but you're not going to hear people in West Virginia talking about Russia Vladimir Putin Helsinki Robert and Muller investigations you're not gonna hear that in Alabama you're not going to hear that in most states and in inver Bates what is the one issue the one or two issues that you do hear out on the campaign trail every day that West Virginians and Americans care the most about well health care when I just said yo eight hundred thousand West Virginians are directly affected with a pre-existing condition it's anywhere from high blood pressure someone who had a heart defect born with the defect I've had an artificial knee right or knee replacement John that qualifies as the pre-existing condition my rates could alter also but for everything anything on those everybody knows somebody in the family or has someone in their family is in fact health care of life-and-death matters for the first time we're getting treatment now for opiate addiction with had a horrific horrific problem here in West Virginia is horrible because these are hardworking people they pharmaceutical industries taking advantage of them high cost of health care i cost the pharmaceuticals but taking away at your insurance it's a life death matter it doesn't care what the democratic again if you're a West Virginian Joe you're taking away my grandmother for my mother of my aunt or my brother or sister or my health care because you said well you were sick before we're afraid it's going to come back and be occur if it does you're expensive for us we don't want to have you in short you don't want those money on you and Joe have an answer for the reinsurance and that's the biggest thing and again I'm so proud of we are what we call 55 united 55 saw for the first time Joe all of our education came together to rally around education you know we have teachers going to school we have school service personnel feeding me and transporting our kids we had the we had the base as far as administrators and superintendents all come together they go Heastie round saying education has got to put a party to education what we produce the 21st century work skills and they were deciding and cutting and cutting they said enough enough stood together and made them change and Republicans to listen and make sure the 55 strong showed that education and economy go hand and you can't have one without the other so health care and education or two of the things that that we hope in dear Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin thank you very much for being on with us this morning we appreciate it well it does it's great to be with you all you cannot tell you one thing if Russia or any other country wants to invade no come to West Virginia they'll have a rude awakening though which they never gave channeling Charlie Daniels Band something like that just go put your hands on a Pittsburgh Steelers fan and then my friend I think you'll understand so Steve Smith let's look at some of these races I was referencing with with the senator who came to us via Skype in West Virginia so joe Manchin's race this is a race of Donald Trump estate the Donald Trump won easily joe Manchin up in internal polls on both sides pretty comfortably you can see in Indiana another deep red state Joe Donnelly doing pretty well there Claire McCaskill in Missouri holding her own that's neck-and-neck same with Heidi Heitkamp and then you go down to Tennessee and there's Phil president that guy is like 65 25 favored abilities and he's ahead in that race - those are five states that Democrats should be 20 points behind but man they're neck-and-neck and could win all of them let's start with the Tennessee race Phil Bredesen we have a candidate who's well known former governor former mayor of the city of Nashville running against a Republican candidate on the one-to-ten coupe scale clocks in at about thirteen point three so no surprise that that he would be ahead in that race we look in we look in Indiana we look at Donnelly he's a he's he is an Indiana Senator it's a state where there's still enough proximity to the voters that you can get around that state they know who he is and they they like them I suspect they're going to return him to office you know Joe Manchin in West Virginia United States Senator former governor of the state he's known in the state he's probably looked at more in the state as a as a as a West Virginian than a Democrat and fuss you see the imagery of the of the rifle though I would say the the use of it to shoot legislation is probably irresponsible for a responsible gun owner to be able to to go and do what you do see across the the country as we head in the fall campaign I think is a is a rising wave that's going to repudiate trumpism I think this is a profoundly significant election I think people in this country understand what's at stake I think the majority opposes the tone the meanness the cruelty the vileness the corruption of it all before you get to a single issue and we're seeing that and in the generic ballots and and then the Republicans fundamentally have a nut problem in a lot of these races you have a lot of nut ball candidates you look at the Dan McReady race in North Carolina he's literally running again commander Waterford from The Handmaid's Tale who's out on the campaign trail talking about the necessity of women submitting to their husbands just extraordinary so when you look at these races and you look at it through for example the corruption Lane you know you can put Duncan Hunter seats so we have the crooked Republican Lane we have the nut Republican Lane we have the weirdo Republican Lane and then we have your normal Republicans that are just swept up in the in the tide who have shown cowardice and complicity in the age of Trump and thus they've alienated all these college-educated suburban Republican women so I think it is not good tidings heading into election day and I think Republicans on the hill and Republican staff and lobbyists know that what the writing on the wall is here which is you know the die is cast here for a pretty big defeat come come November well and Nick a week is a lifetime in politics we don't know what's going to happen the rest of September we don't know what's going to happen through October will there be another October surprise there may be but at least over the past week or two you really have seen a lot of races moving in the Democratic direction it's true I mean look I think the biggest thing for me is that Hillary Clinton is not on the ballot this year and Donald Trump is and what that means is that this is going to be a referendum for a lot of voters on trump and trumpism and they're not going to have the complexity of hillary clinton as a candidate to matter for them I don't see any Democrats who are running on Russia the only Democrat in the country is making a big deal of Russian and Pietschmann our donors like Tom Steyer the candidates are focused on the right issues for them in their races they're focusing on health care and accountability and importantly they're focused on this theme of corruption and the last time we saw that was in 2006 we saw a great thing for Democrats that's the in in in in 2006 where they basically were able to in wrap lots of different issues in lots of different races under the banner of corruption and it proved to be very successful for them in that year all right coming up ahead of this year's midterm elections there have been signal second questions about Facebook's role in the 2016 election our
