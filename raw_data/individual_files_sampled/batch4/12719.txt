my producer Colton who travels with me when we are on the road young Colton we are on the road and where we were at we didn't event in Detroit great event and we're without our security detail also now when one of the it's it's both tragic that I have to have a security detail in order to go around giving speeches but it's also fun in the sense that I really like the guys on my security detail they're all ex-military and they're a blast and they're really a kick so we were so we go to this event in Detroit great event at a church and afterward they're a bunch of off-duty police officers who are there who are fans and one of them says okay I know you need to get to the airport how about we give you a police escort I said okay sure sounds great so this this female police officer jumps into her car and we're cruising down the highway toward the airport to get on her flight and she's got her lights on and suddenly behind us pulls up another cop and this other cop pulls us over and we were like okay so why are you pulling us over and the first thing he says is because you're following a police officer and we were like well right because she's guiding us to the airport and he says really that's her it's just she's guiding you to the airport yes she's giving us an escort to the airport and he says well your brights were on like know our brights were not on you're just making that up and then because all the guys in my security detail are ex-military one of them starts to get out of the car to talk to the police officer and police officer is getting real uptight now get back in the car get back in the car Michael Donovan gets shot on the side of the freeway by a by a cop with a stick up his butt and well and here's the part that's amazing this is the best part so the police officer who was guiding us there has now pulled over on the side of the freeway as well until we say to this police officer why don't you go and ask the person in that car and he says well I don't know that's a police officer and we say well that's a police car and this officer says well you know there are people on our force who go home at night and you know they build police cars and they just ride around in them now number one that's not a thing number two if that's happening and you are posing as a police officer that's a crime so if you actually think that that is a person who has built a formal police car and is driving around with their lights on off-duty shouldn't you go arrest the person doing that you know 10 feet in front of us and not bother us eventually this police officer goes and actually asks the other police officer what's going on she says yes I'm a police officer I'm guiding these people and the guy kind of gives us a stern shake of his head and gets into his car and then drives away the reason I tell this story is as you know on the show I am very Pro police officer I think law enforcement does an amazing job overall in the United States I love police officers I defend police officers I'm one of the biggest defenders of police officers in America the reason I tell this story is because one of the narratives you hear a lot is that police action when it's when it's bad action is a result of racism something bad happens to a black person it's automatically the result of racism I am here to tell you there are some police officers who are just doof's I don't know if this guy's name was I know his badge number I wish I had it okay but this police officer was a doof he was a doof and it is important to recognize that in every profession there are dues so when something bad happens instead of immediately leaping to the conclusion then it must be systemic racism because police officers hate black folks instead we might want to think about the possibility that the police officer is just a doof the kind of doof would pull you over for following another police officer I mean frankly if you thought the police officer in front of us was not a police officer and was a civilian impersonating a police officer he should have given us a medal for making a citizen's arrest against somebody who's impersonating a police officer it was just insane it was I mean it was really funny our guys want one of the guys like well should we just we were kind of behind the other police car when he pulled over to talk to the second officer he's like should we pull up and I was like no just sit still okay this guy is super jumpy I really don't want the headline tomorrow to read Shapiro and security team shot to death by Officer four following a police officer to the airport in a guided in a guidance would be a long headline number one and number two that's just that's a bad way to go so that's my crazy story from this particular trip okay
