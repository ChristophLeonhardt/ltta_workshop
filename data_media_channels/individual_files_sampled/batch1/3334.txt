how question is great with liars or people who just haven't thought things through because they will never have thought about how to get something done either someone hasn't thought enough down the line he's not intentionally lying to you or of course a liar that's he's lying to you is never going to figure out how to get it done anyway because they have no intention of implement 7:38 55 is a is a rough ratio of the importance in sending an entire message across between what you say how you say it and the way you look when you're making that state the bottom line is on a regular basis how you say things is about five times more important what you say I can completely change the meaning from think you're really smart dude I think you're really smart those are two totally different meanings exact same words now the rule of three has to do with how many times not something is repeated for example if you are hearing yes you've got to hear yes three times in the same conversation to make sure it's up you may ask someone a question and they'll immediately say yes it's true and then you paraphrase a back of you mirror mirror them in order to get a answer again and the second time you hear yes they might be yes well that's a completely different yes than the first one and oftentimes you need to hear an answer three times to be able to listen to the subtle change
