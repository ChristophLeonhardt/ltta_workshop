1
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,950
so in 22 months in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Obama campaign</font>

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,980
you managed putting together the system

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> controlled everything obviously</font>

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">huge real-time feedback presumably some</font>

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,550
budget issues you didn't know how big<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,720
was going to be how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people you</font>

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,730
needed to hire talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that process</font>

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,070
how do you manage a process like this

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,320
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of time I mean and Julie</font>

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that my challenge was not giving away</font>

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,010
the business to a campaign yeah you know

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,540
to manage the growth of the business

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,239
overall political and none I mean I

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,910
think we had buy-in from the candidate

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,039
and his immediate team who understood

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,750
you know the guy was<font color="#E5E5E5"> community organizer</font>

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,430
20 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so he understood that</font>

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,480
the knock<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the door from a neighbor</font>

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,010
was more powerful than television spot

20
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,680
and the challenge was how do we make

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> again lower in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the barrier to entry</font>

22
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,820
how do we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so accessible how do</font>

23
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,079
I get such that if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a volunteer</font>

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">signup in Iowa someone reaches them</font>

25
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,219
within 24 hours those kind of mandates

26
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,740
crystal clear from the top allowed us to

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,920
really mobilize sort of the org chart to

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,660
respond to what we needed we obviously

29
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,550
had an incredible candidate to who

30
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,440
understood not only the power of

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology but had a message of</font>

32
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,640
engagement the fundraising was never

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> total dollars raised it was about</font>

34
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,380
total individuals given and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

35
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,709
that DNA and the fact that it was you

36
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">know he didn't have a 20 year history in</font>

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,819
politics that had lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people eager</font>

38
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,890
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> presidential campaign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

39
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,360
asked whether the same strategies could

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,340
have worked in cane or Clinton or other

41
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,709
things and I would say no I mean we

42
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,619
shouldn't we simply couldn't have

43
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,420
negotiated the org chart in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that</font>

44
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,670
it was done at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day on</font>

45
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,860
election day I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the team for the</font>

46
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,390
Digital side was more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 people</font>

47
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,940
and it was I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the largest</font>

48
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,970
headquarter based team but that

49
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,369
represented less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one percent of the</font>

50
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,840
fundraising<font color="#CCCCCC"> them the total dollar spent</font>

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,979
so it was both willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage all the</font>

52
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:04,959
more traditional stakeholders in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,890
campaign and from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,470
and always sharing in the success so as

55
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,450
we learned and we were all learning a

56
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,800
lot through the process from a tech

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,330
perspective and the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

58
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,520
strategies sort of democratizing those

59
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,440
learning so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the field guy</font>

60
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,490
gets really excited when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has a</font>

61
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,660
thousand new volunteers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't</font>

62
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect and when you really tap the</font>

63
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,190
experience of volunteers on the ground

64
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,170
and their willingness to commit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

65
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially in the primary days when</font>

66
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,470
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were states that really weren't in</font>

67
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,120
play until the primaries dragged on

68
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,040
forever when you suddenly wake up and

69
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,989
you realize you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 volunteers in</font>

70
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,420
Idaho who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really active and</font>

71
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,130
you're gonna drop a campaign staffer<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

72
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">there their job becomes a lot easier</font>

73
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">than it would have been five years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

74
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and how do you manage that communication</font>

75
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,450
just the learning you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this massive</font>

76
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,160
volunteer army yet you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

77
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,750
tight group of folks who are actually

78
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">building the technology thinking about</font>

79
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,170
the different messaging tracks and so

80
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,970
forth how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you manage that especially</font>

81
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,170
under the time pressure that you were

82
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,550
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time pressure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think actually</font>

83
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,709
helps because it keeps people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

84
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,209
bit out of the way it makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you not</font>

85
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,610
overthink things and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a lot about</font>

86
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,739
the spaghetti factor of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of throwing</font>

87
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,600
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the wall understanding the in</font>

88
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,130
the digital experience you can test a

89
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,140
lot you can send a message<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000</font>

90
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and see how they respond before</font>

91
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,160
sending it out to 13 million and so

92
00:03:16,160 --> 00:00:00,000
constantly being open to new<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font>
