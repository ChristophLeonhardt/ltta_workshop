LAWMAKERS IN TENNESSEE HAVE ABANDONED THEIR PLANS TO PROPOSE AND PASS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD OUTLAW CHILD MARRIAGES IN THEIR STATE. YOU HEARD THAT CORRECTLY, CHILD MARRIAGES OCCUR NOT ONLY IN TENNESSEE, IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY BAD IN TENNESSEE. IN FACT A RECENT INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT SO UNDERSTANDABLY LAWMAKERS IN THE STATE REALIZED THERE WAS AN ISSUE HERE. NOW, THERE ARE LAWS AGAINST CHILD MARRIAGES BUT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF LOOPHOLES PEOPLE WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. FOR INSTANCE A JUDGE COULD INTERVENE AND ALLOW UNDERAGE PEOPLE TO GET MARRIED, PARENTS COULD GET INVOLVED AND SAY THAT THEY ALLOW THEIR 10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER TO MARRY A MAN WHO IS IN HIS 30S, AND SO THEY WANTED TO CLOSE THESE LOOPHOLES. BUT THEN, ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATION GETS INVOLVED AND THEY STOP IT BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THIS LEGISLATION, IF IT PASSED INTO LAW, WOULD DO AWAY WITH THEIR EFFORTS, OR AT LEAST PUT THEIR EFFORTS, TO OUTLAW GAY MARRIAGE IN JEOPARDY. SO IN THEIR VIEW, GAY MARRIAGE IS MUCH WORSE THAN 10-YEAR-OLDS MARRYING PEOPLE IN THEIR 30S. LET ME GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS AND THIS IS WHERE THINGS START TO GET PRETTY SHADY NOW, DAVID FOWLER IS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTS TO OUTLAW SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, AND HE IS THE ONE WHO EMAILED THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER AND CONVINCED HIM HOW ABOUT WE PUSH THIS BILL INTO THIS SUMMER STUDY SESSION, WHICH ESSENTIALLY KILLS THE BILL. IT'S LIKE A GAP YEAR, IT TAKES A YEAR TO GO FIND ITSELF. BECAUSE OF WOLF PAC I KNOW ALL ABOUT HOW THEY KILL BILLS, AND THE NUMBER ONE WAY IS, WE WILL CONSIDER IT LATER. WHICH MEANS WE ARE DONE WITH IT, WE AREN'T CONSIDERING IT. SO SUMMER STUDY MEANS WE KILLED THE BILL, IT'S DONE. SO WHAT IS FOWLER'S REASONING, HIS LEGAL THEORY BEHIND KILLING THIS BILL? AND WHY WOULD THAT BILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT HIS EFFORTS TO OUTLAW SAME SEX MARRIAGE? WELL LOOK, I'M NOT A LAWYER AND I'M NOT PRIVY TO THE LAWS AND SO I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE COMMENTING ON THAT, WHETHER OR NOT THAT LEGAL THEORY IS ACCURATE, BUT WHAT I WILL SAY, AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS KNOWN, IS THAT THEY GENUINELY THINK SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS WORSE THAN KIDS GETTING PRESSURED AND FORCED INTO MARRIAGE, WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. 10-YEAR-OLD GIRLS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONSENT TO MARRYING SOME 31-YEAR-OLD DUDE. LISTEN, SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS AND THROUGH SOME OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS THAT MARRIAGE IS SIMPLY THE UNION OF ONE MAN AND ONE CHILD. BY THE WAY, THAT IS LITERAL, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF EXAMPLES IN THE BIBLE. THEY AREN'T THAT FAR OFF. WHICH GETS ME TO MY POINT THAT SOME MIGHT CONSIDER CONTROVERSIAL. YEAH THEY CARE MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF GAY RIGHTS AND TAKING AWAY GAY RIGHTS, AND THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF FRAMING IT, ANA, BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THEY DON'T MIND CHILD MARRIAGE. THEY THINK IT'S PART OF THEIR CULTURE. THAT IS A CONSERVATIVE THING. I DON'T WANT ANYONE GETTING ME WRONG, I'M NOT SAYING EVERY CONSERVATIVE IN THE COUNTRY, A CONSERVATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA THINKS IT'S AWESOME FOR 10-YEAR-OLDS TO MARRY 30-YEAR-OLDS. NO. WHAT I'M SAYING THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN TENNESSEE, KENTUCKY, SOME STATES WHERE THIS IS BEING DISCUSSED, WHO GOT MARRIED WHEN THEY WERE 13, WHO HAVE A TRADITION AND A CULTURE OF GETTING MARRIED VERY YOUNG AND THAT WAS INTERTWINED WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS OF THE WORLD, SO I THINK THEY JUST FLAT OUT DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF THE LAW. WHAT IS ONE OF THE COMMON SMEARS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE RIGHT WING WHEN IT CAME TO THE PROHIBITION OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE? WHAT WAS A COMMON SMEAR THAT GAY PEOPLE HAD TO DEAL WITH? THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GO AFTER THE KIDS. THAT THEY WOULD BE PEDOPHILES, THAT THEY WERE DISGUSTING NO, YOU ARE THE PEDOPHILES, YOU ARE SUPPORTING THE MARRIAGE OF A 10-YEAR-OLD TO A 31-YEAR-OLD, THAT'S DISGUSTING. ANOTHER CLASSIC CASE OF PROJECTION. AND LOOK, IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT, AND NOT JUST POLITICAL, THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN ALABAMA THAT DEFENDED ROY MOORE. AND IF YOU REMEMBER SOME OF THE DEFENSES WE QUOTED FROM REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS IN ALABAMA, IT WAS A LOT OF, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? WHAT, YOU DIDN'T DO THAT? AGAIN, NOT ALL CONSERVATIVES, AND I DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE I'M POLITICALLY CORRECT, I WILL CALL ALL CONSERVATIVES ALL SORTS OF NAMES, BUT THERE IS SOME SUBSET OF CONSERVATIVES, ESPECIALLY IN THAT REGION OF THE COUNTRY, WHO THINK WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL? AND IF I WANT THAT, THAT SHOULD BE PART OF MY PRIVILEGE. AND ANA, YOU ARE RIGHT, I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY, THEY SAY GAY PEOPLE THAN ARE INTERESTED IN YOUNG KIDS. STATUTORY RATE MEANS SOMEONE UNDER 16 CAN'T GIVE CONSENT, SO IF YOU ARE MARRIED TO SOMEONE WHO IS 10 YEARS OLD, THAT IS JUST BY DEFINITION OF LAW RAPE, RIGHT? IT'S NOT THAT THEY CAN'T GIVE CONSENT, THE PARENTS GIVE CONSENT. BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE CONSENT FOR YOUR KID TO HAVE SEX. YOU CAN GIVE CONSENT FOR YOUR KID TO ENTER INTO MARRIAGE, AND THAT'S THE LAW AND A LOT OF THESE PLACES. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AFTER YOU WORK OLD ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO SEX BUT TOO YOUNG FOR MARRIAGE. THAT'S THE INSANE PART, JIMMY IS IN A SENSE RIGHT, IN KENTUCKY, THEY WERE ALSO CONSIDERING A BILL TO END THE LOOPHOLES TO END CHILD MARRIAGE IN KENTUCKY AND IT ALSO GOT HELD UP BY RIGHT-WING INTERESTS, THEY CLAIM FOR OTHER REASONS, WE CAN GET INTO THAT IN A SECOND, I DON'T BELIEVE THEM ANYWAY, A WOMAN IN KENTUCKY WHO WANTS TO COMBAT THIS SAYS, QUOTE, THIS IS LEGALIZED RAPE OF CHILDREN. BECAUSE IN THOSE CASES, IF YOU ARE A 31-YEAR-OLD GUY AND YOU SLEPT WITH A 10-YEAR-OLD IN THE STATE OF TENNESSEE YOU WOULD GO TO PRISON FOR PROBABLY DECADES, AS YOU SHOULD. BUT IF YOU ARE A 31-YEAR-OLD WHO GOT THE PERMISSION OF HER PARENTS TO MARRY HER AND THEN HAD SEX WITH HER THAT WOULD BE PERFECTLY LEGAL. IT'S INSANE. BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE LAW TODAY IN TENNESSEE. AND AGAIN THEY KILLED THE BILL THAT WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE LOOPHOLES TO PROTECT THESE KIDS. SOME OF THEM ARE THREE-DAY WAITING PERIODS BEFORE HAVING A WEDDING. YOU HAVE PLANNED A WEDDING, I'VE PLANNED A WEDDING. THREE DAYS, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WE NEED TO GET THESE CHILDREN MARRIED NOW BEFORE IT GETS INSERT SOMETHING DISGUSTING THERE. IT'S LIKE WE NEED TO GET THIS KID MARRIED NOW, WE CAN'T WAIT 72 HOURS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE U.S. AS A WHOLE, THERE ARE OTHER STATES WHO HAVE LOOPHOLES LIKE THIS ON THE BOOKS 87% ARE GIRLS, ONE THIRD WERE 16 AND UNDER, 14% MARRIED OTHER MINORS, SURE, THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN TO MARRY WERE THREE 10-YEAR-OLD GIRLS IN TENNESSEE. THIS IS ALL FROM A FRONTLINE REPORT. THE YOUNGEST GROOM WAS AN 11-YEAR-OLD WHO MARRIED A 27-YEAR-OLD. ONE OF THE OLDEST PERSON TO MARRY A CHILDREN WAS A 74-YEAR-OLD IN ALABAMA, HIS BRIDE WAS 14. WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT ALABAMA CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT TO MARRY 14-YEAR-OLDS? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT STORY, AND THERE IT IS. THE STATE RAISED THE AGE TO 16 AFTERWARDS. THAT'S SOMETHING. MY POINT ABOUT CULTURE, AND KENTUCKY THE RIGHT-WING GROUP WANTS TO DEFEAT THIS LEGISLATION SAYS WE ARE JUST LOOKING OUT FOR PARENTAL RIGHTS. IN CASE THE PARENT WANTS TO CONSENT. AND THEY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF EXCUSES, I DON'T BELIEVE THEM. THESE STATES COULD END WHAT IS IN ESSENCE, AS JIMMY POINTED OUT AND AS THE EXPERTS POINT OUT, LEGALIZED CHILD RATE, BUT THEY AREN'T DOING IT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WAS MARRIED OFF AT 16 TO A PREDATOR WHO MOLESTED HER AT 14 AND CONTINUED TO, HER PARENTS PRESSURED HER TO MARRY HIM. I'VE USED THIS EXAMPLE OFTEN, IN CENTRAL ASIA THERE ARE NOMADIC CULTURES THAT USED TO KIDNAP WOMEN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOMADS AND THEY WOULD DO RAIDS, THEY STILL HAVE THAT TRADITION. SOME, NOT ALL, SOME OF THEM STILL KIDNAP WOMEN, RAPE THEM, AND THEN THE WOMAN'S PARENTS COME OVER AND SAY DON'T CAUSE US EMBARRASSMENT, JUST MARRY YOUR RAPIST. AND WE GO ALL MY GOD, LOOK AT THESE CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES, LOOK AT THESE MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS, LOOK AT THESE GUYS MEANWHILE RIGHT HERE IN TENNESSEE AND KENTUCKY, THAT CASE IN KENTUCKY, THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN ABUSED SINCE 14, HER MOM CAME AND CONVINCED HER TO MARRY HER MOLESTER, AND ONE OF HER REASONS WAS, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL? I GOT MARRIED AT 13. BECAUSE THERE IS A CERTAIN SUBSET OF CULTURE THAT IS USED TO THAT KIND OF MARRIAGE, PARTLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU HIT PUBERTY, THE BIBLE INSTRUCTS US IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO HAVE KIDS, AND YOU CAN'T HAVE SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE SO UP AND AT 'EM. SO THIS IS WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE SANCTITY MARRIAGE.
