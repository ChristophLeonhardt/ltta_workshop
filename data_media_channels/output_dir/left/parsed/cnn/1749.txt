we're trying to understand what's wrong
what happened we have no more idea what
happened now then I had an hour though
I mean we're still just completely
befuddled dumbstruck
as I told them the last time I
communicated with my brother was about
well when did we get power back five
days after the storm okay
he texted me and said how's mom I texted
him back I mean I look my mom knows what
happened yeah we all found out when our
phone started ringing with the cops at
one o'clock this morning or saying they
had nothing to do with any political
organization religious organization no
white supremacist nothing as far as I
know in I've only known him for 57 years
your father that's correct I mean here
we're all proud my father was on the top
10 list for a while his name's Benjamin
Hotchkiss paid off I believe is his name
I didn't I didn't know him we didn't
know him there's no he was in jail and
broken out of jail does he have a theory
like a history at all of he doesn't in
that parking tickets he has no criminal
record he has no record of any
affiliations he has nothing mental
illness that I know absolutely not
as far as I know once again nothing like
that he was a wealthy guy and he liked
to play video poker he went on cruises
he he sent his mother cookies from I
mean big huge crazy boxes of cookies
instead of four
