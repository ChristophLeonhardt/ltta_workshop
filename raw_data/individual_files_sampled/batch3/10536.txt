Angela Merkel is under pressure amid calls to expel the US ambassador to Germany it comes after Richard Grinnell who's been in the post for barely a month said he's working to strengthen right wing movements across Europe the German Foreign Ministry has asked him to clarify his remarks as Peter Oliver now investigates at the beginning of the last century then American President Theodore Roosevelt said that US diplomats should speak softly and carry a big stick well the current US ambassador to Germany he's opted more for shouting loudly and using that stick to smash diplomatic norms have a look at what he have to say to the right-wing news site Breitbart there are a lot of conservatives throughout Europe who have contacted me to say they're filling there is a resurgence going on I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe other leaders while ambassador Grinnell has announced himself as the alt-right cheerleader in chief in Europe some people in Berlin aren't happy that such a senior diplomatic figure is involving himself in the day-to-day running of European politics he's a high-ranking official from me from a United States and maybe needs to be a little bit more careful I cannot imagine that I never never something similar it's disgusting this person should be sent out of our country we don't do this in the US and they shouldn't do that this is horrible and the US government this is a shame sorry for that but that's my opinion he should have been more diplomatic and I believe that the right wing is not the right way to be pushing I wouldn't call this incident meddling in German affairs but as a diplomat he should be more neutral politicians on the Left say the Ambassador who's only been in the job for a month should pack his bags and go home ambassadors are representatives of their states and not her political movements u.s. Ambassador Grinnell however does not behave like a diplomat more like a far-right colonial officer we won't tolerate such behavior hunt you it is not only a breach of etiquette it is also a violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations there is an article 41 in which it is very clearly stated that ambassadors shall not interfere in internal affairs he has to go because he has broken too much porcelain in Germany he has become a real hate figure and that is not a good platform for a u.s. ambassador this isn't the first scandal at mr. Grinnell's been involved in just a few days into his tenure he upset German businesses with these comments after Washington pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal as Donald Trump said US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran's economy German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately ambassador Grinnell's brash shoot-from-the-hip style certainly seems to be from the same playbook as president donald trump but he may well find out the hard way that envoy's are expected to act and behave in a certain way whether they're at home in DC or here in the German capital Peter Oliver RT Berlin
