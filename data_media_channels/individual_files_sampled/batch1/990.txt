hi I'm for me okay and you're in the stream and I'm Malika Bella today how do you turn a moment into a movement we're discussing a new theory on power in the 21st century where the authors of the book new power so tweet us your thoughts and your questions or you can comment in our live YouTube chat and you too could be with Malika and myself in the stream hi I'm Alex Oliver the author of the driver in the driverless car how our technology can change the future and you are in the student strength in numbers is the idea that a group of people has more influence than just one person and that the collective is stronger as a whole it's also one of the guiding principles in new power that's a book about the power dynamics in the 21st century from the movements Facebook what's driving all these phenomena is the rise of new power is the essential skill of the 21st century the ability to harness the energy of the connected crowd and get the outcomes that you seek are we're seeing this deployed for good and for bad look at the old right look at the way in which they're taking memes and ideas to spread their dangerous messages around the world and look to on a side of humble look at the way people are galvanizing around gun control around refugees issues to get the outcomes they want whoever mobilizes is gonna win and a few enough understanding new power you can end up on top welcome to the new power world so this is gonna be an interesting show because we don't have a two authors with us yet we are keeping our fingers crossed this shows you that this is a live show we were hoping that in Dallas in Texas we're going to have to discuss the new idea of new power co-authors of the book Henry Tim's and Jeremy hymens they are standing right there just testing to see if I have a couple of new extra gray hairs well we get them set up Malika and I took a quiz which is a new power quiz if you look on my Twitter feed you were finding it at femi okay and I am apparently I am a crowd leader and I asked you what kind of leader you might well be and there are options there are co-opted as castle's crowds and cheerleaders apparently I am a crowd leader Malika what did you end up being I am between a crowd leader and a cheerleader but my favorite answer could be from one of our stream producers a year this is Ellie and she took the quiz as well she got she is between the Pope and Lady gaga so we're gonna give you a little teaser there and have our audience stay tuned for what those two people have in common we will tell you how to test to see where you fit in new power or old power a little bit later in the program but Jeremy hymens and Henry Tim's welcome to the show good to have you here if there was a poster child post a person poster man or woman for new power and one for old power who would you pick well I think interestingly it would almost be that the poster child for new power would not be one person hmm so you know we talk a lot in the book about the black lives matter founders and their philosophy of leadership which they described as being leader ful so a movement in which there's no one kind of charismatic leader you know at the top speechifying in which all of the energy and focus ladders up but rather one in which many leaders can emerge through a movement that works more like a current and so I think the counterintuitive answer on that is there's no one there's no one answer all right if you wanted an old power archetype you think about Harvey Weinstein okay you know he kind of holding up all this power it was very much about him gonna keep green like movies he could stop careers he could stop careers he had all of that power in his hand I couldn't spend it when he chose to and that's a very different way of exercising power than leaders who are thriving in the new power world and of course as they're talking our audience might recognize Harvey Weinstein behind my shoulder there that is why he is in one of our panels there you'll see it in the wide shots but gentlemen I wanted to bring up a another potential example this is Occupy Wall Street HD floors rights in that Occupy Wall Street prided itself on a leaderless style movement however it led to its downfall because it fell victim to conflicting goals inner competition of who will speak on behalf of the group the strategy etc groups like black lives matter and me to learn from that failure and he goes on to say those two movements face a far weaker opposition than groups like Occupy Wall Street who tackle wealth inequality wealthy elites can use their resources to tackle issues of police brutality and sexual harassment but it's harder to do when they're considered the problem no I wouldn't agree with that second comment personally I think white supremacy is a really big issue that black lives matter is facing but I'm wondering where you think Occupy Wall Street and the other groups he mentions fall in that spectrum well how you think about success so I think one easy read is kind of Occupy wasn't a success because it didn't turn into like a membership organization where they had chapters in every state was still going strong for years on but but the other way of thinking about occupy is it was a good example of actually what new power can achieve because what actually happened with occupy was all of that energy shifted a cultural narrative actually opened up kind of horizon of engagement that other organizations then came in to fill so the more generous our interpretation of occupied although I think it did have some challenges in terms of decision making was it began a relay process and then you follow that arc for the success of books like Thomas Piketty s work I mean think about all innovations like the forward foundation now put all of their focus around the strategy of addressing inequality you think how much inequality is now talked about and addressed as an issue across the US and Beyond I think you have to credit occupy starting a relay of change that went from them to other institutions but I think your reviewer is right that we're seeing some promising signs in movements like me too which are perhaps taking the energy that occupy was able to generate around something really structural in this case misogyny but are also kind of consolidating that so you know the times up kind of offspring if you like of the me to movement sort of took that energy consolidated it now what what the Occupy Wall Street movement were really ideologically opposed to was any kind of real consolidation of that energy and I do think that that was a constraint so Jenks I want to make sure that our audience watching globally have got a really good grass on this idea of what new power is what old power is and thanks to you I've got a visualization let's play a little bit of Tetris here we go all right Henry explain what's Texas doing here it was top-down the rules were set by somebody else your job was simply to make things fit into neat lines again and again and again until eventually you collapsed and a lot of institutions treated people that way they wanted people to fit into the game of Tetris where they set the rules and that's very different to the new power laws which isn't working like Tetris it's working like a very different game which is minecraft oh I've got minecraft us here talk us through minecraft but why that is the representation of new power so what's so interesting about Minecraft it's also a block based game just like Tetris but the entire universe of Minecraft is created by the people using it there are no rules really that govern Minecraft everyone is creating vast worlds within this space you know there's a story retell of the earnest people of Norway who recreated the entire state of Norway in Minecraft until an American at the very last minute plan an American flag right in the center of the of the country it's a story for our age but the point is that minecraft is made by many it's a product of the energy that its participants put into it and that's a really good way of thinking about these differences between a model based on mass participation like Minecraft and a model that's more based on compliance which is Tetris leaders what the book is about is saying we all knew the skills of approaching the world as if it like Tetris where the institutions had all the power and we drop things down and people did limited things and now we're in this world participation everyone must add their voice wants to be involved wants to be engaged you know look at the stream as an example of an effort to try and engage with the crowd in more meaningful ways so the question the book addresses is um how you deliver develop a set of skills that allow you to deal with the world where people expect minecraft dynamics not this Tetris mindset so Jeremy and Henry a question here and that arises is what happens when you have a new power model but they're using old power ideas and values and I bring up Facebook as an example because we got a video comment from a member of our community and a person who's also a journalist and an author he wrote the big bubble this is when he told the stream it's important here to remember that there is has never in the history of mankind been so much power concentrated one single company through Facebook they control more than a billion people and how we see our world how we appreciate what's happening around that and the way we interpret and the way their algorithms shape our worldview is important to understand more about and that's why we need much more transparency from them I imagine it being sort of like when you buy food and there's an ingredient list on the back side there should be something similar on Facebook that way you can say that these are the factors we take into consideration when doing the algorithm and it's how they will affect you they don't thing to disclose the recipe but they need to know the ingredients is that goes into it so where would you put facebook on the new power versus old power and also what's it what's your your your take on whether or not there should be a ingredients label we couldn't agree more I mean I think so really what the books about is saying that the people who are best able to harness our participatory energies to mobilize people other people who are getting ahead and and Facebook is such a good example of that right they're brilliantly bringing billions of people together the question is then what you do once you've harnessed that energy and I think what we do in the book is describe Facebook as a co-op term because they're taking new power but really they've been extracting a lot of value from the very people that they're trying to engage and so I think we agree and we proposed in the book the idea that this algorithm it shouldn't be like Colonel Sanders secret herbs and spices you know we should have some visibility into that algorithm we should be able to turn a dial and say I want to hear from different kinds of voices these are the people that I want in my newsfeed and I think even you know we've argued in the book that there should be a public interest test apply to that algorithm because Facebook has just become such a critical arena for democracy so the big question is this new power is going to get used by someone the question is by whom and the work of the book really is partly trying to make sure that it gets into the right hands hmm Jamie and Henry you put this really well but Pope Francis did this before you in 2017 he did a TED talk and he talked about changes in power and how people can have access to that power have a listen quanto puce a potent a quanto peu de acción ian on impetus hola gente tanto peu psyche Amato Ezra Miller Burkhart romantic ilpo Terry T Raveena a to Roman era real tree in futuro the Luminita no name Soren le mani dipole it teaching they run the leader the grande arche ele see the role responsibilities Norman my future so prosciutto Nellie mani deli persona kvitko no score last row camión - he says testicle apartheid you know Pope Francis he gets it one of the things that struck me by what you were trying to do in sharing your philosophy this idea of a power structure change is that you're doing it via Terry telling parables telling stories did you actually do anything yourself other than curate the stories you're looking at new Palin the way that it is being used did you use new power yourself did you go and see the people one of the stories was about NASA and NASA crowdsourcing did you go out and get dirty telling your stories when we first and then Jeremy did a TED talk one of the things so interesting is you started to see people grabbing this work and taking it somewhere you didn't expect they've got the frame of all Perrineau parameter okay I can see how it's worked in my world so I'm going to take it somewhere new so I'll give you an example of a group we really learn a lot from there a group of health workers in NHS in England and they've had read the original article and they've taken the bones of the article and actually built a whole set of tools curriculum C training some open source programming around the idea of how health professionals can become more powerful themselves using some of the techniques that the article kicked off so one of the most interesting kind of inputs into putting the book together itself was learning from these members of the community who had grabbed the initial ideas and made them better and what's great about a book is it's been out now for two and a half three weeks people have now finished reading what we're already seeing is people who have grabbed the ideas and are making them more interesting more relevant more valid and that's the goal of this workers is very pointed out earlier the book is just the beginning of a conversation we want to start which is those people who are acting you know on the side of the angels need to get good at this stuff quick and what will those spend the years ahead doing is really encouraging and fostering that community so the new power ends up just as the Pope said making more people walk out so Jeremy Henry of course we heard the Pope and that little clip there and we also tweeted that example out to our community asking them what they thought and there was an interesting response from Chris Tierney on Twitter he says that's not leadership it's PR he says the church still opposes homosexuality same-sex marriage contraception abortion the separation of church and state it's still actively covering up child abuse even after thousands of cases of rape were uncovered and therefore he doesn't think that's actually an example of new power I'm wondering what you our take on that is given what I what I tease our audience with this this spectrum of leadership Pope Francis can be compared to Lady gaga in some ways can you explain for our audience absolutely so I think you know that the Pope is obviously and the Catholic Church is a complicated a complicated organization it's it's really the oldest of all power institutions but what we're so interested in is what the Pope is doing to move that organization which is never easy right and we would argue he's doing more than just PR so yes there were these very powerful symbolic gestures about empowering you know the late parishioners when he became Pope but he is also trying to structure for participation he's really gone after the entrenched corruption in the church the Vatican Bank etc it was actually the first Pope in the history of the papacy who actually asked regular parishioners what they thought about the church and I think it's a very interesting question about doctrine right so you're absolutely right that the doctrine on homosexuality on reproductive rights has not really changed but what he has tried to do understanding that he has only a limited amount of leverage really even the even as Pope is he's shifted the norms so he famously says when asked about homosexuality Who am I to judge and what he was doing there was basically pushing decision making about those issues deeper down into the church rather than imposing doctrine from on high so I think there's a lot we can learn from Pope Francis especially given the entrenched are power institutions in even though it's by no means a perfect figure Desmond are we just talking about technology and digital and access and the way that the world is opened up is that what starts new power I was wondering is there a date or an era when it started and does it have a sell-by date I think it's definitely the case that the technology has shifted really a set of expectations and capacities so if you think about Jeremy as a lifetime activist and so at 13 years old you can imagine him you had a fax machine and he was chasing world leaders around the world sending an earnest faxes to their hotels imploring them to stop the Iraqi war now this was not a successful campaign and cut forward to Henry but if I may let me just show people some of the things that general that Jeremy was doing when he was younger this is he's his TEDx talk so you can look at that and you will see that when he was a little no he wasn't it just moved on a little bit but in his TEDx talk you can see him as a young man actually doing incredible activism at a really really young age carry on let's just take an example from Newsweek look at the Parkland kids who think about the tools of participation they have in their hand Jeremy's your activist has a fax machine he sends these faxes around the world to hotels in vain these Parkland kids have access to this extraordinary connective network who don't just have the ability to participate they have the expectations autism so what new power is about is in a world where the speed the scale the kind of cross-sectoral application of this work is so much faster than than it used to be how do you if you were trying to get changing the world take advantage of all of these people who don't just want to consume they want to create and it's a different set of skills right these Parkland kids as Henry said demonstrated so fabulously if I have those tools in my hands there's no doubt I could do more than I did then but there's so much opportunity out there that the problem is not everybody knows how to use those skills so the skills of mobilizing your employees or the people you have authority over are very different to how you get a much larger community or crowd engaged and that's what we're trying to pass out in the book wanted those genuinely new skills in a world in which everybody potentially can play that role of those parkland kids of playing so I want to duck suppose two things for you both so the first is a live comment we just got on YouTube this is Jay Jenkins who says Donald Trump is swimming in new power a second is a video comment this is Arun and he's a professor and author of the sharing economy and this is what he had to tell the stream hi I'm Arun sunder Rajan I'm a professor at New York University author of the sharing economy I Henry and Jeremy loving the book as you know there's so much insight your framework provides into why the sharing economy has emerged and why it's persisted so my question for you is about new power heading up against the systematic misinformation on social media that we've been witnessing over the last couple of years do you think that this increases the importance of local physical world networks in making online movement succeed so some would say that those two comments there are related one in one hand you have misinformation and the other hand you have someone who some would accuse the Trump campaign and administration of wallowing in that misinformation I'd like your take on that well it's certainly true that the people who are spreading misinformation and lies and certainly include Donald Trump in that do start at an advantage unfortunately because they're unconstrained by facts they're unconstrained by you know the ability to provoke extremism so there's no doubt that you can do that more easily I think getting people together in real life building real community is an important antidote to it but it's also important that those of us who want to build a different kind of world to the Donald Trump will actually mobilize on social media with the same passion and intensity think about that election it was the intensity that his supporters had the fact that he would retweet a white supremacist and the signal he sent was I want you to be more powerful those of us in a different mind space need to also generate passion and intensity the facts will not simply be enough so how question is what is the point of this what is the point of the book the book is to be aware of where you are in this spectrum and there work out how to leverage this new power that you have one of the ways that you entice people with trying this out is a quiz who put the quiz together was it a psychiatrist we developed the framework based on the research that we did for the book and you know it's a really useful tool for people to figure out like where are they now like what are their mindsets are they skilled in this new power world because most of us understand all panel right the question is have we got these new set of skills to go alongside them and I think it's also a question about the last of us of a set of human questions so we often confuse what's changing with the world is it's just something to do with social media right so we finally have to understand how snapchat works or what we're doing about LinkedIn but it's actually about professional identity right so I pretend to be someone who can kind of work out how to solve problems collaboratively how to work with the crowd how to engage more broadly or are you someone who is still essentially kind of issuing your press releases on to the world and expecting people to pay attention and the beginning of that isn't isn't really about digital life at all it's actually about how you think about your own power in the world and that's the conversation that the book wanted to provoke but we also have a very strong bias that there's people who are doing the work which Matt's so much right now you think about the climate scientists or the health workers or the Enlightenment voices people who are trying to make the world more just those are the people who have to get armed with new power because their opponents of doing some of this stuff really well you think about kind of the climate deniers that anti-vaxxers the Internet crazies they're really good at new power and those people who are current or attending to the institution's we all care about most they need to learn these new power skills if they're not gonna fall behind and it's also incredibly important to anyone just working in a in an institution or a company and trying to make change with that company so we really help people navigate just ordinary change including at that very local level if you're trying to rebuild your organization make it more transparent make it or collaborative we're trying to provide some really granular tools that people can use because this work is quite subtle right a lot of it is about culture isn't something we can adjust camera I know you can talk you talk for 24 minutes Mallika where should we leave the conversation I'll leave with Pedro Flores who says methods of leadership have to evolve with the generation they wish to lead and if not they'll become a relic of history rather than an institution of the future Jeremy Highland and Henry Tim's they are the authors of new power thank you for being on the stream today really appreciate your time Thanks I take a thank you
