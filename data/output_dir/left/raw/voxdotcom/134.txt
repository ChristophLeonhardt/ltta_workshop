1
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,440
It  was called "dazzle camouflage", and the irregular

2
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,410
shapes were paired with bright colors, like
this blue.

3
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,600
So when artists painted scenes like this or
this, they weren’t just playing with paint.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,760
They were showing the final defense that hundreds
upon hundreds of ships used...against torpedoes.

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,580
British artist Norman Wilkinson painted scenes
like these and specialized in nautical pictures.

6
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,780
He ran the Royal Navy’s camoufleur program.

7
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,220
Yes - “camoufleur.”

8
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,370
One who...camouflages.

9
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:04,220
Previous camoufleurs had tried shades of grey
or blue, but Wilkinson suggested dazzle:

10
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,039
unpredictable patterns, with a range of colors.

11
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,499
There were some really bright ones.

12
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,060
Hiding a ship was hard.

13
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,110
The ocean and sky were constantly changing
colors, and that made it hard to pick a single

14
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,060
shade of paint that could help a ship slip
by unnoticed.

15
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,880
But it was possible to hide what the ship
was doing.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,270
The U-Boat submarine and torpedoes were the
big new threat in World War I.

17
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,520
But the u-boat had limitations.

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,200
To shoot a torpedo, you needed to know the
angle, distance, and speed of the ship you

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,509
were shooting at.

20
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:44,770
The ship was moving and so was the submarine.

21
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,329
Now imagine a ship through a periscope from
a thousand meters away.

22
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:56,070
When you...dazzled...a ship, you made it hard
for u-boats to know where to aim.

23
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,189
Here is a normal boat and a dazzled boat.

24
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,499
On the normal boat, you can see the bow and
stern, and you can gauge key attributes to

25
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,149
guess at the speed.

26
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,360
It’s a lot harder on the dazzled boat.

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,370
Lines like these were false waves, so it was
hard to guess which direction was the bow,

28
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,849
or front of the boat, and where it was going.

29
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,939
The colors made it hard to tell how quickly
the boat was moving from one point in the

30
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:26,379
view to another, or to use a rangefinder to
guesstimate its distance.

31
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,409
Everything looked...sort of wrong under dazzle
patterns, which made a ship’s course tough

32
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:32,750
to assess.

33
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,540
Is it going this way?

34
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,769
Or is it going this way?

35
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,870
A few degrees could be the difference between
life or death.

36
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,790
You could see it, but you couldn’t guess
direction or speed to guide your torpedo.

37
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,130
Dazzle patterns were always different and
kept top secret.

38
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,150
The starboard and port sides were designed
to be unpredictable.

39
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,500
Modelers even tested visibility using tiny
boats and simulated periscopes, just to see

40
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,890
what was most confusing.

41
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,600
This is warfare at its cutest.

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,160
Even experts were fooled by the direction
of the ship.

43
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,550
Out in the ocean, tricking a torpedo saved
lives.

44
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,579
Dazzle camo inspired people from all disciplines
as it traveled worldwide.

45
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,660
One zoologist claimed to have invented it,
inspired by zebras,

46
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,160
British artists with cubist-inspired backgrounds
became camoufleurs,

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:38,360
and photo-scientists in America made their
own models too, like in this 1919 MIT thesis.

48
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,440
Even the sister ship to the Titanic became...dazzling,

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,480
when it was turned into a troopship.

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,120
At the end of World War I, periscopes and
weaponry improved, as well as strategies to

51
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,779
deter u-boats.

52
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:02,180
On the other end, dazzle paint was hard to
maintain.

53
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,569
Radar furthered the decline of dazzle’s
utility, though the camo was used in World

54
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,860
War II on ships and even on planes.

55
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,560
Dazzle inspired fashion trends at the time
and the artists who painted it on ships.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,360
Norman Wilkinson made this painting of the
dazzled ships he helped make mainstream.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,880
The u-boat’s rise and particular weaknesses
opened a unique window in history, like a

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,200
camouflage loophole.

59
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,160
For a brief period, it made sense to stand
out.

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,280
Paint fades.

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,760
But even today, dazzle lives up to its name.

62
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,160
So if you look at these dazzle ships and think
about cubism, you aren’t wrong to make the

63
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,090
connection, and you aren’t the only one.

64
00:04:51,090 --> 00:00:00,000
Pablo Picasso tried to take credit — eh,
he might have had a point.
