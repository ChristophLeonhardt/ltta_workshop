our top story Justice Anthony Kennedy retiring tonight which gives Trump another Supreme Court justice nomination the selection of a Justice of the United States Supreme Court is considered I think we can all say one of the one of the most important events one of the most important things for our country if they can swing different ways depending on who would might who there might be in the court so it's always been considered a tremendous and tremendously important thing tremendously important Democrats agree with that and they say they may chuck the rulebook and start really fighting are you guys ready to may be rip up some of the rules that have as Rachel said limited Democrats yes the : I know we're ready because I've seen these candidates people from all across America should realize that their rights and opportunities are threatened we've been playing by the rulebook we need to play by Street rules Street rules that's what McConnell did in 2016 ripping away and hijacking Obama's Supreme Court pick which then paved the way for an upset election and Neil Gorsuch to wind up on the court many people saying tonight yes elections have consequences and all this news comes amidst another development there were these elections last night and a huge primary upset self-described socialist and Democratic Party beating the number four Democrat in the house with a very radical get tough progressive message herself on television right now how are you feeling can you put it into words nope I'm joined by former DNC chair Donna Brazile let's start with your reaction there should Joe Crowley have lost and what does it mean that there's a changing of the guard well first of all Joe Crowley is a great Democrat but this was a race in which the voters in that district New York 14th they wanted change she was a progressive voice throughout the campaign talking about issues that matter at the local level he was the eldest state's person and I'm not talking about age I'm talking about experience talking about his record she was talking about what she plans to do he is talking he was talking about what he when he has done this was a young really aggressive campaigner I watched you on one of the debates when she really talked about these issues she spelled out Medicare for all she spelled out her policy positions on jobs on tuition making college more affordable she was an unabashed progressive and I tell you something it is a wake up call and I hope Democratic incumbents are paying attention yeah and this is you mentioned cuz you know Joe Crowley you worked with him he's been on this show viewers may remember him and he's done a lot of different things but this is a clear sign coming from the bottom up that people want a different reaction and that is a big context for something nobody knew was coming today my colleague Chris Matthews laying out the politics on that that if Democrats don't do everything in their power to fight it will be a political implosion on their side even before these pivotal midterms take a listen they will find a way to do it okay there are ways to slow down votes they will find that way or they will fail and if they fail they will lose their leadership the party will not accept failure on this front if you lay down like the experts to say and lay down and accept this as as history that can't be stopped you're going to see a political party in serious implosion is that right Donna look this is this is a very important Supreme Court position and I can tell you I've heard from the Bay the party today they want the Democratic Party the Democratic senators to apply the same McConnell rule to this nominee now remember mr. Trump has the right to nominate the Senate is advising consent mr. McConnell said the American people should have the right to have input into the selection I believe that we deserve input is your recall re that in 2016 mister mister mister Merrick garland was elected he was nominated by the president we have that 1/16 we have that let's look at that and get your response here it is it has been 80 years since since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year there is a long tradition that you don't do this in an election year will justice garland Judge garland get a hearing no I don't think so this nominee is not gonna be considered let's let the American people decide what do Democrats do with that rather damning hypocritical Oppo video well we continue to tell the American people this is the McConnell rule it applied in 2016 it should apply in 2018 and we have to use every constitutional mean that we have within the Senate framework and you know their rules a little arcane we have to use every constitutional framework to make that point day in and day out look that's what the Supreme Court did today and the public sector Union case what they've done this past week with regards to not just gerrymandering but a woman's right to choose this is a very important position and while very important seeing while we respect the fact that the president the president who's on the investigation by the way we respect the fact that he can nominate the Senate advise and consent I think that Senate Democrats must be on the case we should apply the McConnell rule and the McConnell rule is simple let the American people go to the polls and 131 days only four months and that should give you know the Senate enough time for them to wait until we get a chance to get our voices in the process well it's a big political fight and Donna you know mitch mcconnell's music you don't usually sing from his songbook so something must be going on the American people should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court justice I'm going to keep tweeting this every day I'm gonna remind them why they they stood up and opposed President Obama's nominee they say we don't do this in election year well this is an election year and by the way 3/4 of the nation's governors will be elected this fall this is a very important election 36 senators all 435 members of Congress let the American people have a voice in this process well you put it starkly it is summer but it is not a summer off it seems this is gonna focus the minds of a lot of people going into a very consequential election donna brazile as always we appreciate your political insights hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
