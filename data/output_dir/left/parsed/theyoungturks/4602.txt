DURING THE SENATE RECESS
REPUBLICANS ARE DOING EVERYTHING
THEY CAN TO AVOID ACTUALLY
TALKING WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE
CONVERSATION WILL GO TO
HEALTHCARE.
THEY HAVE COME UP WITH A WAY TO
CHANGE THE CONVERSATION
WITH THIS AD.
>> WHERE'S THE PLAN?
HASH BROWN
WHERE IS THE PLAN?
>>DEMOCRATS DID HAVE A PLAN, IT
IS CALLED OBAMA CARE.
IS A WEIRD
THING TO SAY WHERE IS YOUR PLAN
TO REPLACE YOUR PLAN?
NEVER
AGREE WITH REPUBLICANS ON
ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY WILL USE
IT IN A TV AD.
>>IF OBAMA CARE DOESN'T COVER
EVERYBODY THAN THE ONLY
SOLUTION IS TO KICK 22 MILLION
PEOPLE OFF OF OBAMA CARE.
DUH.
>>HELLO MCFLY.
THAT IS WHY
PEOPLE LIKE A MANCHIN ARE SO
HURTFUL TO THE CAUSE.
HE HELPS
REPUBLICANS WITH THEIR TALKING
POINTS.
IT IS PART OF HIS ROLE.
MOST IMPORTANTLY THE GUY THEY
QUOTED THE MOST OF THEIR
WAS BERNIE SANDERS.
HE SAYS THAT IS A VERY GOOD
POINT AND THEY CUT HIM OFF.
>>DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS
EMBARRASSING THAT BERNIE
DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER?
THEN I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT IS
IT.
THAT IS EMBARRASSING CENK.
>>
YOU WILL BE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT
BERNIE SANDERS DOES HAVE A PLAN.
>>WHAT?
I JUST WATCH THE VIDEO HE SAID
HE HAD YOU HAD A GOOD POINT –
>>BERNIE SANDERS IS IN FAVOR OF
MEDICARE FOR ALL.
ELIZABETH
WARREN HAS ALSO SAID SHE IS IN
FAVOR OF SINGLE-PAYER.
IS NOT
TRUE THAT DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A
PLAN, THEY DO DEFINITIVELY.
ONE
SIDE OF THE POLITICAL EQUATION
JUST DOESN'T CARE ABOUT LYING OR
MISLEADING PEOPLE AT ALL.
THAT
IS WHAT DRIVES ME CRAZY THAT
THOSE MAINSTREAM MEDIA PEOPLE,
THEY TAKE REPUBLICAN TALKING
POINTS AND READ THEM ON THE AIR.
>>I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING
THAT THEY WERE USING SO MANY OF
THOSE FAKE NEWS PURVEYORS IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
WEIRD, ALL OF A
SUDDEN YOU LIKE THE QUESTIONS
THEY ARE ASKING.
THERE IS
OBVIOUSLY VARIOUS FORMS OF
SINGLE-PAYER, THERE IS MEDICARE
FOR ALL.
IF YOU WANTED TO BE
ABLE TO POINT TO A PLAN, THAT IS
AN EASY WAY TO DO THAT.
BUT THEY
ALSO TWEETED THINGS LIKE THIS.
THEY THEN GO FORWARD IN THIS
NEXT TWEET– SO HILLARY CLINTON
EVEN RESPONDED AND PUT THE LINK
TO HER HEALTH CARE PLAN.
I DON'T
THINK IT IS NEARLY AS GOOD AS
MEDICARE FOR ALL, BUT IT IS A
PLAN.
YOU COULD – THINGS ARE
BEING DEBATED THAN OTHER
DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT FORWARD.
BEFORE THE ELECTION REMEMBER WHO
WAS IN CONTROL OF THE SENATE?
IF
THE DEMOCRATS HAD TRIED TO DO
SOMETHING WHAT IT HAVE GOTTEN
THROUGH THE SENATE?
THIS IS BS
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.
OF COURSE IT WILL JUST BE
PLAYED UNCRITICALLY AND THEIR
FOLLOWERS WILL LOVE IT.
>>MEDIA, STOP WITH THE FALSE
EQUIVALENCIES.
THE INSANE POINT
THEY ARE MAKING SPECIFICALLY
WITH HILLARY CLINTON WHO I HAVE
NO LOVE FOR IS DONALD TRUMP WON
THE ELECTION AND REPUBLICANS
CONTROL THE WHITE HOUSE, THE
HOUSE, AND THE SENATE, SO IT IS
OBVIOUSLY HILLARY CLINTON'S
FAULT THAT REPUBLICANS CAN'T
PASS A HEALTH PLAN.
WE ARE
ENTERTAINING THAT INSANE POINT?
>>OR IT IS UP TO HER TO PUT
FORWARD A PLAN WHEN SHE IS IN
THE WOODS?
SHE IS PROBABLY DOING
A LOT OF FUNDRAISING AND COMES
UP AT RANDOM TIMES AND SAYS
SOMETHING ANNOYING.
WHEN THE
STAKES ARE AS HIGH AS THEY ARE
IT IS FRUSTRATING.
WHEN THEY PUT
FOR THIS AD SAYING WE WANT TO
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM – IT IS THE
DEMOCRATS THAT DON'T HAVE A
SOLUTION.
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING
FINE IF WE CAN'T PASS THIS PLAN
WE JUST REPEAL IT AND WE DON'T
EVEN REPLACE IT RIGHT NOW.
YOU
THINK 22 MILLION IS A LOT OF
PEOPLE?
WAIT UNTIL THEY SHOW YOU
REPEAL WITH NO REPLACEMENT.
A
LOT MORE PEOPLE WILL SEE THIS
AD THEN PUSHING FOR REPEAL
WITH NO REPLACEMENT.
>>IT'S LIKE IF I PASS THE
GETTING OUT OF POLITICS
AMENDMENT
– IT IS THE MEDIA'S FAULT
BECAUSE THEY ENTERTAIN THIS
BULLSHIT.
IF THEY ARE FAKE IN
ANY WAY IT IS IN THEIR BULLSHIT
EQUIVALENCIES THAT DRIVE ME
NUTS.
>> WHEN THEY ASK THEM WHAT
EFFECTS OBAMA CARE.
THEIR FIRST
ANSWER SHOULD BE THEY ALLOWED
PEOPLE 
WHO ARE LOOKING TO
DISRUPT IT TO ADD THINGS AND
GIVE CONTROL TO GOVERNORS IN
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
AND TAKE IT DOWN SO IT COULD
HAVE PROBLEMS.
THEY CAN SAY LOOK
WHAT HE DID TO DESTROY THEIR
HEALTH CARE WHEN THEIR WHOLE
PURPOSE WAS TO DESTROY THIS
HEALTHCARE INSTEAD OF 
GETTING 
IT
TO A 
GOOD POINT WHERE IT
CAN WORK.
>>WHEN THEY SAY EVERYONE AGREES
THAT OBAMA CARE IS A DISASTER.
NO, EVERYONE DOES NOT AGREE.
I
DON'T AGREE.
IT HAS ITS ISSUES,
BUT IT IS NOT A DISASTER, IT IS
WAY BETTER THAN WHAT IT WAS
BEFORE.
AND IT IS TRIPLING THE
REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL IN
POPULARITY.
IF YOU THINK OBAMA
CARE IS A PROBLEM, WAIT UNTIL
YOU GET THE REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL.
HEY REPUBLICANS, AMERICAN
PEOPLE DESPISE YOUR PLAN.
WHY DO YOU CONTINUE ON THIS
RECKLESS PATH THAT IS
CLEARLY UNDEMOCRATIC?
