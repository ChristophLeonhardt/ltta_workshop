I came here to the neighborhoods of Detroit to see what life was like in reality and the reality is pretty horrific actually there's streets and street of burnt-out buildings here that nobody seems to want to do anything about much so weird is there not completely gutted there's still evidence of a regular life here there's people's beds there's newspapers there's you know stuff on their kitchen spoons lying around you know why would you ever listen to what politicians were promising you what they were going to do on homelessness what they were going to do for veterans that don't have housing why would you ever believe them when this is the reality of what you face everyday living in your home just across the street if you'd like to hear more of my reporting from the heart of Detroit please do join me at Hopkins worldcom you
