1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,400
LET'S GET INTO MELANIA.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,550
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,550
OH, WOW.

4
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,550
OKAY.

5
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,910
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL.

6
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,910
I
SWEAR.

7
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,910
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

8
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,910
THAT

9
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,910
WAS SO TERRIBLE.

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,720
LET'S GET ON
THIS.

11
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
THAT'S WHAT -

12
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,700
OH, GOD.

13
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,040
THERE'S SO MANY OTHER
JOKES TO MAKE ABOUT THIS STORY

14
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,490
THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF
THEM.

15
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,650
MELANIA TRUMP HATES

16
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,440
BULLIES NO MATTER HOW IRONIC
THAT MAY SOUND.

17
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,440
SHE SPOKE TO

18
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,800
THE UN ON WEDNESDAY OUTLINING
HER PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,870
MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.

20
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,710
FOLKS HEARD THIS PART OF HER
SPEECH, AND TOOK ISSUE

21
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,329
ABOUT HOW TONE THAT
THEY CAME OFF.

22
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,749
TAKE A LISTEN.

23
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:43,449
IT REMAINS OUR GENERATIONS OF
MORAL IMPERATIVE TO TAKE

24
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:48,350
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT OUR
CHILDREN LEARN.

25
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,350
WE MUST TURN

26
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,930
OUR FOCUS RIGHT NOW TO THE
MESSAGE AND CONTENT THEY ARE

27
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,309
EXPOSED TO ON A DAILY BASIS
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, THE

28
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:02,780
BULLYING, EXPERIENCE ONLINE AND
IN PERSON, AND THE GROWING

29
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,620
GLOBAL EPIDEMIC OF DRUG
ADDICTION AND DRUG OVERDOSE.

30
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
SO YOU HEARD THAT.

31
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,210
SHE
THINKS BULLYING IS BAD AND WE

32
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,180
NEED TO WATCH WHAT KIND OF
EXAMPLE WE SET OVER SOCIAL

33
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
MEDIA.

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,510
THIS OF COURSE ON THE
HEELS OF LITERALLY YEARS OF HER

35
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,930
HUSBAND ABSOLUTELY BULLYING
PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

36
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,930
THE

37
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,270
LATEST OF WHICH WAS THIS TWEET,
THIS RETWEETED GIF OF HIM

38
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,880
HITTING A GOLF BALL AND HILLARY
CLINTON GETTING HIT BY IT.

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,030
IT LOOPS TWICE.

40
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,930
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS SO
FUNNY.

41
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,430
AND, BY THE WAY, THE

42
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,820
TWEET ALSO HAD HASHTAG CROOKED
HILLARY.

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,820
SO LOOK, THAT WAS

44
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,760
THREE DAYS AGO, BUT YOU COULD
PICK 1000 EXAMPLES WHEN IT COMES

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,790
TO DONALD TRUMP, AND WELL BEFORE
HE BECAME PRESIDENT.

46
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,790
ROSIE

47
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,270
O'DONNELL IS A PIG, AND ON AND
ON.

48
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,270
IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN.

49
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,270
HE

50
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,270
ATTACKS EVERYBODY.

51
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,270
TO BE THERE TO HIM, HE IS
A DICK TO EVERYONE.

52
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,760
GOING AFTER A BEAUTY PAGEANT
CONTESTANT BECAUSE HE THINKS

53
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,860
THAT SHE HAS GAINED TOO MUCH
WEIGHT, YOU KNOW, MAKING FUN OF

54
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,630
A REPORTER WHO HAS A DISABILITY.

55
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,508
I MEAN, IT JUST GOES ON AND ON

56
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,508
AND ON.

57
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:11,509
I MEAN, THAT IS HIS MO.

58
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,069
THAT IS WHAT TRUMP DOES.

59
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,079
RIGHT.

60
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:16,430
HE CALLED HILLARY CLINTON
CROOKED HILLARY THROUGHOUT

61
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,430
THE CAMPAIGN.

62
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,470
HE CALLED TED CRUZ, LYIN' TED.

63
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,159
HE CALLED MARCO RUBIO, LITTLE
MARCO.

64
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,159
I CALLED HIM BOY.

65
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,890
OH, YOU CALLED HIM BOY.

66
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,579
WELL, THAT'S THE THING IS HIS
TACTIC IS ALWAYS UNEMOTIONAL

67
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,129
ATTACK ON SELF-ESTEEM.

68
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,129
THAT'S
WHAT IT IS.

69
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,129
HE WANTS TO HURT

70
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,999
YOUR SELF-ESTEEM, AND YES THESE
ARE BIG POLITICIANS WHO SHOULD

71
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,779
HAVE A HEALTHY SELF-ESTEEM.

72
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,439
BUT
IT'S THE EXAMPLE THAT MELANIA IS

73
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,129
TALKING ABOUT, IS SETTING AN
EXAMPLE, AND THAT EXAMPLE IS TO

74
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:49,120
GO AFTER PEOPLE WHERE THEY MAY
FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS AND THAT'S

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,760
WHAT BULLIES DO, AND YES, THERE
HE GOES AFTER POLITICIANS AND

76
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,889
YOU CAN COME BACK AT ME WITH
OKAY, THERE'S A BUNCH OF

77
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:00,510
POLITICIANS SO IT ISN'T
PUNCHING DOWN, BUT EVERY OTHER

78
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,310
EXAMPLE IS EXACTLY HIM PUNCHING
DOWN AND NOW THAT HE IS THE

79
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,340
PRESIDENT, MOST OF THE PEOPLE
THAT HE'S PUNCHING ARE DOWN.

80
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,989
ALMOST EVERYBODY,
RIGHT, BY DEFINITION.

81
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:10,989
HE'S THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.

82
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,540
EXACTLY.

83
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,829
AND I GET THAT IT
COMES OFF AS INCREDIBLY IRONIC,

84
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,900
BUT LOOK, SHE HAS FIRST-HAND
EXPERIENCE OF WHAT IS LIKE TO BE

85
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,639
MARRIED TO A BULLY, SO MAYBE
THAT'S THE REASON WHY SHE CHOSE

86
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,980
THIS AS THE TOPIC THAT SHE
CHAMPIONS THROUGHOUT.

87
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,769
THAT'S A GREAT POINT.

88
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:29,769
AS YOU
KNOW WHAT?

89
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,269
SHE MIGHT HAVE MEANT

90
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,919
THIS AS A MESSAGE TO TRUMP AND
SHE THOUGHT, WELL, BECAUSE THIS

91
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,379
IS AN IMPORTANT SPEECH, FOX NEWS
MIGHT COVER IT SO TRUMPET

92
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,819
MIGHT FINALLY LISTEN TO ME.

93
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,819
MAYBE.

94
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,010
IT'S ONLY IRONIC IF SHE LOVES
HER HUSBAND.

95
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,010
RIGHT.

96
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,010
THAT'S TRUE.

97
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,010
IT DOESN'T REALLY APPEAR THAT
SHE DOES.

98
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,760
IF SHE THINKS HE'S A BULLY,
IT'S NOT IRONIC AT ALL.

99
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,379
ALSO AS I WATCH THAT, PART OF
ME REALLY FEELS FOR HER BECAUSE

100
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:55,890
SHE DOES NOT WANT TO BE THERE.

101
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,890
SHE DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE THAT

102
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,219
SPEECH OR BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE.

103
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,809
I HAPPEN TO KNOW SOMEONE WHO

104
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:07,150
USED TO BE HER HAIRSTYLIST AND
HE HAD TOLD ME THAT SHE IS ONE

105
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,219
OF THESE PEOPLE THAT JUST WANTS
TO BE AS PRIVATE AS POSSIBLE SO

106
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,889
NOW SHE IS FORCED TO BE IN THE
PUBLIC EYE WHEN ALL SHE WANTED

107
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:13,969
WAS A SUGAR DADDY.

108
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,319
YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN?

109
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,839
IT KIND OF SUCKS.

110
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,349
NOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE
SPEECHES THAT YOU PROBABLY

111
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,200
DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT.

112
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
I DON'T KNOW.

113
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,470
I THINK SHE IS DOING THIS
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT HERSELF

114
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,820
FOR HER SON, THE YOUNGER TRUMP
KID TO BE BULLIED AND THAT'S

115
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,820
SUPER

116
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,910
UNDERSTANDABLE AND SHE GETS, BUT
THE KID ASIDE, EVERYBODY AGREES,

117
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,260
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE KID.

118
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,390
FOR
HER, I DON'T KNOW, YOU WANTED TO

119
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,350
MARRY DONALD TRUMP AND YOU
THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

120
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,540
SAD DAY FOR YOU.

121
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
THERE I DON'T
HAVE MUCH SYMPATHY.

122
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
I AM NOT

123
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,700
SAYING GO BULLY HER.

124
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,100
I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO

125
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,850
BULLY HER, BUT IF YOU ARE GOING
TO GET CRITICIZED FOR BEING ON

126
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,110
TEAM TRUMP, THAT IS NOT
REALLY BULLYING.

127
00:04:58,110 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS JUST THE CONSEQUENCE OF
YOUR DECISIONS.
