so breaks it negotiators Michel Barnier and David Davis have just announced that they've agreed on the terms of the implementation period of the UK leaving the European Union Davis told us in a press conference that once this implementation period has ended new trade deals can be signed on and Britain will have economic and trade independence for the first time in like 40 years brilliant they've also agreed on a large part of the overall withdrawal agreement which they say will ensure an orderly withdrawal from the European Union but Davis also said in his speech quote during this period those international agreements that arise from the European Union membership continue to apply as now and there we have it today's announcement is not about independence at all in fact today's announcement is that the UK's borders will remain open during the transition period until 2020 to bear in mind by the way that the next general election in the UK must be held on or before the 5th of May 20-22 so the electorate aren't gonna see any real change before the next election I suspect that's probably a ploy by the Conservatives to tell voters in the next election that if they want the job finished they need to give them yet another chance devious manipulative political scheming is just a standard for the Conservative Party these days isn't it now Davis claimed the New Deal provides certainty to business but that to ensure the agreement is faithfully and fully implemented he also announced that the government and the EU are setting up a joint committee of representatives from the UK and the EU which will be quote underpinned by a clear commitment from both sides to act in good faith don't make me laugh I mean good faith I trust the EU just as little as I trust Theresa May let's talk good faith shall we back in June 2008 when Ireland decisively rejected the Lisbon Treaty which among other things made the European Parliament more powerful forming a bicameral legislature alongside its Council of Ministers it also created the wrong term position of the President of the European Council and it allowed the European Parliament to decide the full budget and guess what the Irish rejected it and so in good faith naturally the EU just made them have another referendum they just asked the same question until the voters gave them the decision that they wanted the right decision democracy right I mean it's straight out on Nick Clegg's playbook voters also have a right to change their mind a year after they've already made a decision in a major national referendum back in the day when the Irish rejected the Lisbon Treaty a brussels official also described the voters as quote ungrateful bastards good faith my ass and now in good faith I'm sure the EU as the UK agreeing to accept all laws from Brussels for three years after the official date breaks it March 2019 that is they call it a transition period but what that really means is that breaks it won't happen until at least 2020 - and who knows what other stumbling blocks will just appear before then anyway and not only that but it looks like the people of Northern Ireland are going to be kept in the single market as a quote backstop solution so there won't be a border war between Northern Ireland and the Republic but that's just going to be solved by people and politicians ignoring the results of the referendum and if Northern Ireland's kept in the single market that Nicola Sturgeon is right why not keep Scotland in a single market - this isn't a decision for politicians to make the UK voted to leave the EU and they must deliver it but by the way the cherry on the cake is that Davis admitted that Britain's not going to be taking back control of its fisheries either which is a big point in the referendum and that the proportion of fish that British fishermen were allowed to catch within their own waters won't change at all during the transition period but somehow this is the UK protecting its fishing community's interests give me a break now what's the point in this transition period anyway what good reason is there for our country which voted to leave the European Union staying within the realms of European Union law and how is it right after 2019 when will no longer be a member of the EU will obviously no longer have any members of European Parliament but the European Parliament can still vote on legislation that's going to affect and hurt the UK this just gives the EU three more years to pass laws that might well make it increasingly difficult for the UK to actually leave the EU or at least escape some of its powers this is a power grab by the EU and it's betrayal by mrs. May and David Davis who actually I saw David Davis is a real who wouldn't quite compromise this much but clearly I was wrong and just imagine what kind of havoc Brussels can wreak on the UK through immigration in just a few years Barney I made it clear that anyone who arrives in the UK from the EU regardless of where they came from before they reached the EU will be given quote new resident status that offers legal certainty now let me translate that into a normal language anyone who comes into the UK within these upcoming three years of total EU rule while we're being undemocratically controlled by puppet masters in Brussels will be able to stay however long they want so roll up roll up British citizenship is going free and you've only got three years to claim it it's funny we've always said that the European Union is undemocratic by nature and it is our members of European Parliament don't get to propose legislation but they are given rubber stamps and expected to just sit there like monkeys stamping whatever legislation gets put in front of them and soon we won't even have monkey status the EU is punishing us by taking control for a further three years or more while we don't have many PS this is on the same page as taxation without representation we're not only going to be controlled by foreign bureaucrats but this time we're going to be controlled by foreign bureaucrats who aren't even pretending to give us some kind of democratic rights how did the British government sign off on this deal let's be honest remember when Theresa May said Briggs it means brexit and we're going to make a success of it you remember that right well I guess that was her promise made in good faith as well watch me and the rest of rebel on our brand-new rebel app which is available now on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store you
