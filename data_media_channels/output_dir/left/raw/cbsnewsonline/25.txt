CONFIRMATION PROCESS.

400
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,952
INSPIRED BY MY MOM WHO WAS A

401
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,454
TRAILBLAZER FOR WOMEN IN THE LAW

402
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,789
I'VE WORKED HARD THROUGHOUT MY

403
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,090
CAREER TO PROMOTE THE

404
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,625

A CLERKSHIP ON THE SUPREME COURT

415
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,113

513
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,892

A JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND

522
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,610
MUST INTERPRET THE LAW NOT MAKE

523
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,043
THE LAW.

524
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,013
A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET STATUTES

525
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,916
AS WRITTEN, AND A JUDGE MUST

526
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,484

00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:53,404
CERTAINLY, SWORN IN AS THE 114TH

565
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:54,439
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ABOUT

566
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,508
THREE MONTHS AFTER HE WAS

567
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,244
NOMINATED IN THAT SAME SPACE BY

568
00:27:59,244 --> 00:27:59,611
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

569
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,279
AND A LOT TO TALK ABOUT ABOUT

570
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,747
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT EAST ROOM

571
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:03,948
OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

572
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,550
WE SEE RUTH BADER GINSBURG

573
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:05,750
THERE.

574
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,719
SHE WAS THE ONLY OF THE EIGHT

575
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,255
JUSTICES THERE TO WATCH THE

576
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,657
CEREMONY WHO DID NOT CLAP WHEN

577
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,192
KAVANAUGH CAME OUT.

578
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,226
WE SEE CLARENCE THOMAS WITH A

579
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,328
BIG HUG THERE.

580
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:21,065
THE OTHER LIBERAL, STEVEN BRIAR,

581
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:24,102
SONIA SOTOMAYOR, ELENA KAGAN,

582
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:24,535
THEY ALL CLAPPED.

583
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:26,271
AND THEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE A

584
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,139
PRETTY FIERY SPEECH FOR THE

585
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,707
OCCASION CALLING WHAT'S HAPPENED

586
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,609
IN RECENT WEEKS THE POLITICS OF

587
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:34,078
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION AND SAYING

588
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:36,214
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN PROVEN

589
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:36,781
INNOCENT.

590
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,850
THE JUSTICE HIMSELF, THOESHGS

591
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,219
TOOK A MORE -- HIMSELF, THOUGH,

592
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,353
TOOK A MORE CONCILIATORY TONE.

593
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,789
HE PLANS TO BE A TEAM PLAYER,

594
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,124
AND INSISTING, I THOUGHT

595
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,125
NOTABLY, THAT THIS PROCESS

596
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,193
DIDN'T CHANGE ME.

597
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,195
HE SAID I FINISH IT WITH NO

598
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,197
BITTERNESS AND A PROMISE TO BE A

599
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,499
JUSTICE WHO WILL FOCUS ON THE

600
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,934
STABILITY AND UNITY OF THE

601
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:56,134
COURT.

602
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,435
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS HERE WITH

603
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,839
ME AT THE DESK, CAITLIN, A LOT

604
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,974
TO DIG THROUGH IN THIS LAST HALF

605
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:03,541
HOUR.

606
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,876
IF WE CAN STEP BACK.

607
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,178
MY GOODNESS, TWO AND A HALF

608
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:07,879
YEARS AGO MERRICK GARLAND

609
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,448
NOMINATED AS A JUSTICE,

610
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,816
DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS READY TO

611
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,351
TAKE CONTROL, AND NOW TWO AND A

612
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,353
HALF YEARS LATER A MASSIVE

613
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,855
VICTORY FOR THE CONSERVATIVE

614
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:17,122
MOVEMENT.

615
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,857
>> THEY HAVE TWO SUPREME COURT

616
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,657
JUSTICES, AND ESPECIALLY WITH

617
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,793
THIS SEAT REPLACING KENNEDY WHO

618
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,428
WAS CONSIDERED THE SWING SEAT ON

619
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,763
THIS COURT, THERE IS A LOT OF

620
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,165
CRITICISM FROM DEMOCRATS THAT

621
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,767
THIS WILL MOVE THE COURT TO THE

622
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:30,034
RIGHT.

623
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,436
WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING 1

624
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,272
THAT KAVANAUGH SPOKE AND THAT --

625
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,040
WAS THAT KAVANAUGH SPOKE AND

626
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,242
THAT HE TRIED TO HIT TWO POINTS.

627
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,178
HE TRIED TO STRIKE THAT

628
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,279
CONCILIATORY TONE AND MAKE IT

629
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,282
CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO BE

630
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,985
BIPARTISAN, NONPARTISAN, THAT HE

631
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,154
TAKES THIS JOB AS A JUDGE

632
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:49,420
SERIOUSLY.

633
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,488
REMEMBER, DURING HIS

634
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,457
CONFIRMATION HEARING, DURING THE

635
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,825
TESTIMONY, AFTER THE TESTIMONY

636
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:55,560
FROM CHRISTNE BLASEY FORD THERE

637
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,462
WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OF THE

638
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,864
WAY IN WHICH HE HANDLED THAT,

639
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,633
THAT HE EXPRESSED ANGER, THERE

640
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,635
WERE QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT HIS

641
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,702
TEMPERAMENT AND FITNESS FOR THE

642
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:04,902
COURT.

643
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,804
HE IS TRYING TO KIND OF SMOOTH

644
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:07,538
THAT OVER HERE.

645
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,507
HE ALSO TALKED A LOT ABOUT

646
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:09,707
WOMEN.

647
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,175
OF COURSE, THAT IS THE BIGGEST

648
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:12,277
PART OF THIS STORY.

649
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,112
HE SAID THAT HE HAS PICKED FOUR

650
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,947
WOMEN TO CLERK FOR HIM WHICH

651
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,682
WOULD BE HISTORY MAKING FOR THE

652
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:17,882
COURT.

653
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,385
AND HE VERY MUCH PLAYED THAT UP

654
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,519
INTO THE SPEECH.

655
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,454
SO TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD FROM

656
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,256
WHAT HAS BEEN A CONTENTIOUS

657
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,091
BATTLE IN TERMS OF THE

658
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,660
CONFIRMATION FIGHT, BUT ALSO HAS

659
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,028
TO KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

660
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,762
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO LINGER.

661
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:34,565
WE'RE HEADING INTO A MIDTERM

662
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:34,898
ELECTION YEAR.

663
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:37,068
THESE EMOTIONS AND THE REACTION

664
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,537
TO THIS VERY -- STILL VERY RAW

665
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,675
AND A LOT OF FOLKS HAVING VERY

666
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,909
MICKED REACTIONS.

667
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:49,013
>> KATIE WATSON IS CBS WHITE

668
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,248
HOUSE REPORTER FOR CBS.COM.

669
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:55,186
I'VE RARELY HEARD THAT ROOM SO

670
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:55,419
RA KOUS.

671
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:56,987
PAINT IS -- RAUCOUS.

672
00:30:56,987 --> 00:31:00,925
>> PAINT THE SCENE.

673
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,226
>> WHEN SENATE MAJORITY LEADER

674
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:04,095
MITCH McCONNELL WALKED IN, THERE

675
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,195
WAS A STANDING OVATION.

676
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:07,999
THIS WAS SEEN AS A HUGE VICTORY

677
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:08,766
FOR REPUBLICANS AND THE

678
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,703
PRESIDENT AFTER THIS UNDENIABLY

679
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,471
CONTENTIOUS LAST FEW WEEKS.

680
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:17,008
SO I WOULD SAY THERE'S AN AIR OF

681
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,977
CELEBRATION AT THE WHITE HOUSE

682
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,778
AS THE PRESIDENT'S SECOND

683
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,081
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE WAS

684
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:23,848
CELEBRATED AND CONFIRMED AND

685
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,783
SWORN IN FOR A SECOND TIME.

686
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,251
>> THE PRESIDENT MADE IT

687
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:30,455
POLITICAL TONIGHT SO I FEEL OKAY

688
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,656
TURNING TO POLITICS SO QUICKLY

689
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,825
AFTER THE SWEARING IN CEREMONY.

690
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:36,094
DESPITE SO MANY PEOPLE FEELING

691
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,830
SO BAD ABOUT THIS PROCESS,

692
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,465
REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING MITCH

693
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,432
McCONNELL, HAVE SUGGESTED

694
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,568
RECENTLY THIS COULD BE GOOD IN

695
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:43,901
THE MIDTERMS.

696
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,403
WHY DO THEY THINK SO?

697
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,104
>> YEAH, CERTAINLY.

698
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:48,206
WELL, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS

699
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,742
CALLED IT A RALLYING CRY FOR THE

700
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:50,975
GOP.

701
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,310
I THINK THAT REPUBLICANS AHEAD

702
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,812
OF THIS ELECTION HAVE BEEN A

703
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,781
LITTLE BIT LUKE WAURM, IF YOU

704
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,516
WILL -- LUKEWARM, IF YOU WILL.

705
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,617
BUT MANY REPUBLICANS THAT I'VE

706
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,020
SPOKEN TO SAID THIS KAVANAUGH --

707
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,321
ENTIRE KAVANAUGH SITUATION HAS

708
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,156
REALLY RILED UP THE BASE AND

709
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,693
GIVEN THEM AN ISSUE THAT THEY

710
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,261
CAN SURROUND THEMSELVES AROUND

711
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,263
AND REALLY, AS THE PRESIDENT PUT

712
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,065
IT, BECOME A RALLYING CRY FOR

713
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,299
THE BASE FOR MANY.

714
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,002
SO WE'RE JUST A FEW WEEKS OUT

715
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,437
FROM THE MIDTERMS, OF COURSE.

716
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,271
WE'LL SEE IF THAT MOMENTUM

717
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:23,341
HOLDS, BUT IT'S ONE OF THE FEW

718
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,809
THINGS THE GOP FEELS THEY CAN

719
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,344
HOLD ON TO RIGHT NOW.

720
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,280
>> THE OTHER THING IT'S DONE IS

721
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,115
COALESCED A FRACTURED REPUBLICAN

722
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:31,315
PARTY.

723
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,951
ALL THESE NEVER TRUMP PERS, WHEN

724
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,588
IT WAS A CON -- TRUMPER, WHEN IT

725
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,158
WAS A CONSERVATIVE NOMINEE, YOU

726
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,793
SAW A CONSENSUS AROUND

727
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,660
REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES WE

728
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,862
HAVEN'T SEEN IN A COUPLE YEARS.

729
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,131
WE SAW KAVANAUGH NAME CHECK

730
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,232
GEORGE W. BUSH IN WHOSE WHITE

731
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,233
HOUSE HE WORKED FOR.

732
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,100
AND THOUGH THE PRESIDENT MAY

733
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,870
HAVE SMIRKED A BIT, THE ROOM

734
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,137
APPLAUDED.

735
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,505
WERE THERE ANY SIGNS IN THE ROOM

736
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,174
OF THESE TWO PARTS 06 THE

737
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,842
REPUBLICAN PARTY BEING IN -- OF

738
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,010
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BEING IN

739
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,244
THE SAME SPACE AND FOR THE FIRST

740
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,680
TIME IN A LONG TIME BEING ON THE

741
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,181
SAME PAGE.

742
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,681
>> I WOULD SAY NOT TONIGHT.

743
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:08,352
THERE WAS AN AIR OF YOUTUBETY

744
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,487
THROUGHOUT THE -- UNITY

745
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,988
THROUGHOUT THE ROOM.

746
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,957
IT WAS FASCINATING TO SEE ALL

747
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,258
NOW NINE OF THE CURRENT SUPREME

748
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,893
COURT JUSTICES IN THE ROOM AT

749
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:16,927
THE SAME TIME.

750
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,262
I WAS TRYING TO GET A READ ON

751
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,064
THEIR REACTIONS FROM THE ANGLE

752
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,032
WHERE I WAS AT.

753
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,267
THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, PRETTY -- I

754
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,903
WOULDN'T SAY STONE FACED, BUT

755
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,538
VERY MUCH RESPECTFUL, LOOKING

756
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,041
ON, EVEN OF THE ONES WHO WILL

757
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,309
PROBABLY DISAGREE WITH KAVANAUGH

758
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,076
ON THE COURT.

759
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,912
BUT AS FAR AS THE INDIVIDUALS

760
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:35,947
WERE HERE, IT WAS CERTAINLY MANY

761
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,282
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELPED GET

762
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,717
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED OR HAVE

763
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,586
TALKED HIM UP ON FOX NEWS.

764
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:45,089
SO AROUND THE ROOM I WOULD SAY

765
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,024
CERTAINLY WHILE THERE WERE SOME

766
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,126
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS WHO

767
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,160
MAY NOT HAVE ALWAYS OR MAY NOT

768
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,461
ALWAYS BE IN LINE WITH THE

769
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,729
PRESIDENT ON EVERYTHING,

770
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,565
EVERYONE WAS UNIFIED TONIGHT,

771
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:54,966
BROOK.

772
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,134
>> YEAH, I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU

773
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,368
SAW OF THE OTHER EIGHT.

774
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,370
THEY WERE IN OUR SHOT ONLY AT

775
00:33:59,370 --> 00:33:59,703
THE BEGINNING.

776
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:01,939
I SAW ONE CUTAWAY WHERE STEVEN

777
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,574
BRIAR SEEMED TO CHUCKLE AT A

778
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:03,774
JOKE.

779
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:05,777
BUT IT WAS HARD TO GET A LOOK AT

780
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:06,443
THE OTHER JUSTICES.

781
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:09,480
FROM WHAT WE SAW, RUTH BADER

782
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,514
GINSBURG SEEMED NOT TO APPLAUD

783
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:12,683
WHEN KAVANAUGH CAME OUT.

784
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,884
DID ANY OF THEM GO UP TO

785
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,186
KAVANAUGH AT THE END?

786
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,754
I DON'T THINK THEY HAD A CHANCE.

787
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,190
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

788
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,422
>> SURE.

789
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:21,359
THAT REACTION OR LACK THEREOF I

790
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,760
GUESS FROM RUTH BADER GINSBURG

791
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,529
WAS PROBABLY THE MOST TELLING

792
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,563
MOMENT, THE MOST INTERESTING

793
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,998
RESPONSE FOR THE MOST PART AT

794
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,567
LEAST FROM THE ANGLE WHERE I WAS

795
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,668
WHERE I COULD SEE A HANDFUL OF

796
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:32,203
THE JUSTICES.

797
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,438
THEY WERE ALL VERY MUCH JUST

798
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:36,440
LOOKING ON RESPECTFUL AND

799
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,742
KAVANAUGH HIMSELF SAID THAT, YOU

800
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,809
KNOW, HEY, THIS IS A TEAM.

801
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,710
THIS IS A TEAM OF NINE.

802
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,581
HE RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS A

803
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,014
CONTENTIOUS PROCESS.

804
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:45,716
HE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THE

805
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,051
ALLEGATIONS ALTHOUGH THE

806
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,252
PRESIDENT TOUCHED ON THEM.

807
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,853
BUT HE SAID KAVANAUGH REALLY

808
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:51,889
TRIED TO MAKE THE CASE TONIGHT

809
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,291
THAT, HEY, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A

810
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,958
LITTLE BIT OF A CONTENTIOUS

811
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,694
PROCESS BUT I AM A TEAM PLAYER.

812
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,629
I'M GOING TO BE AN IMPARTIAL

813
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,030
JUDGE.

814
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,033
SO IT WAS AN AIR OF UNITY AND AT

815
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,367
LEAST ONE OF RESPECT FROM THE

816
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,169
JUSTICES AND THE ONES WHO MAY

817
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,704
NOT AGREE WITH KAVANAUGH ON

818
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,106
EVERY DECISION OR AGREE WITH THE

819
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:09,339
PROCESS.

820
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,908
>> CAITLIN, HERE AT THE DESK,

821
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,677
WHAT ELSE STRUCK YOU ABOUT THIS

822
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:16,280
AND HOW IT ENDS WHAT'S BEEN AN

823
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,248
INCREDIBLY CONTENTIOUS CHAPTER

824
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,015
IN THAT TOWN AND THIS COUNTRY.

825
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:20,251
>> WELL, THEY ARE CERTAINLY

826
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,886
TRYING 20 CLOSE THIS CHAPTER.

827
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,788
WE'RE -- TO CLOSE THAT CHAPTER.

828
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,089
WE'RE IN A MIDTERM ELECTION

829
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:25,322
SEASON.

830
00:35:25,322 --> 00:35:26,891
THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK BOTH

831
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,559
PARTIES WILL HARP ON.

832
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,994
KATIE BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT

833
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,729
WHICH IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN A

834
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:32,697
RALLYING CRY FOR THE REPUBLICAN

835
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,366
PARTY AND SOMETHING THAT HAS

836
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,601
COALESCED THE REPUBLICANS AROUND

837
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:36,934
DONALD TRUMP.

838
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,302
AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THEY

839
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,503
HOPE TO KEEP UP OVER THE NEXT

840
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:40,571
COUPLE OF WEEKS.

841
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,872
THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO DO.

842
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:45,142
WE'LL SEE IF THEY CAN DO THAT.

843
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:46,177
MEANWHILE, DEMOCRATS STILL FEEL

844
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,079
BURNED BY THIS.

845
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,480
AND THEY STILL FEEL ENERGIZED BY

846
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,948
THE RESPONSE, THE NEGATIVE

847
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,384
RESPONSE TO KAVA.

848
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:58,723
>> THEIR BASE HAS TO BE

849
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,091
ENERGIZED BY THIS.

850
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:00,858
>> EXACTLY.

851
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,628
WE SEE THAT REPUBLICANS TEND TO

852
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,830
TURN OUT FOR THE POSSIBILITY TO

853
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,199
SHAPE THE MAKEUP OF THE COURTS,

854
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,867
NOT ONLY THE SUPREME COURT BUT

855
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,302
JUDGESHIPS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

856
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,904
NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE

857
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,438
DEMOCRATS SAY WE NEED TO GET

858
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,439
INVOLVED IN THAT FIGHT.

859
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,907
WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE TO COME

860
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:19,543
OUT AND VOTE IN ORDER TO SHAPE

861
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:20,010
THE COURTS.

862
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,911
THAT HASN'T BEEN SOMETHING

863
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:22,480
THAT'S WORKED FOR THEM IN THE

864
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:22,680
PAST.

865
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,282
WE'LL SEE IF IT STARTS TO BE

866
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,282
DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND.

867
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:28,019
AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF

868
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,786
ELECTIONS HAVING CONSEQUENCES.

869
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,222
AND I THINK THAT WILL BE THE

870
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,189
MESSAGE COMING FROM DEMOCRATS

871
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:33,791
BUT ALSO COMING FROM

872
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,091
REPUBLICANS.

873
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,961
I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THEM SAY THE

874
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,228
SAME TUNE.

875
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,297
KIND OF TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH

876
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:39,730
THIS REALLY MATTERS.

877
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,299
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE PART

878
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,633
OF THIS FIRST EVER ORAL

879
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,568
ARGUMENTS TOMORROW MORNING.

880
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:47,705
A CASE ON WHAT CONSTITUTES A

881
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,639
VIOLENT FELONY.

882
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,240
IT BEGIN FOR HIM.

883
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,509
CAITLIN WATSON AND CAITLIN

884
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,210
HUEY-BURNS WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR

885
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:53,410
TIME.

886
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,513
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK

887
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:55,713
BREAK.

888
00:36:55,713 --> 00:37:00,217
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.

889
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:48,192
>>> ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS FROM

890
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,060
THE HURRICANE ZONE, FLORENCE

891
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,393
TURNS DEADLY.

892
00:38:50,393 --> 00:38:53,063
>> AT 12 NOON HIGH TIDES ROLLED?

893
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:54,231
>> RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T TELL THE

894
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,165
RIVERS FROM THE ROADS.

895
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:55,866
>> IT'S BAD.

896
00:38:55,866 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S A LOT
