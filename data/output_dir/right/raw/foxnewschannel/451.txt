1
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:02,377
REPORTED MIKE HE DIDN'T ANSWER

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,713
MY QUESTION, MR. PRESIDENT  .

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,114
IF YOU DID LIE ABOUT HIS

4
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:07,516
DRINKING, DOES THAT MEAN YOU

5
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:08,216
WILL PULL HIS --

6
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,084
>> President Trump: I DON'T

7
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:10,519
THINK HE DID.

8
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,120
WHAT, HERE'S -- I'M JUST SAYING,

9
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,121
I'M NOT A DRINKER.

10
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:13,922
I CAN HONESTLY SAY I'VE NEVER

11
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:16,123
HAD A BEER IN MY LIFE.

12
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:18,193
OKAY?

13
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:20,695
IT'S ONE OF MY ONLY GOOD TRAITS.

14
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:21,129
I DON'T DRINK.

15
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:21,496
[LAUGHTER]

16
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:22,497
WHENEVER THEY ARE LOOKING FOR

17
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:23,498
SOMETHING GOOD, I SAY "I'VE

18
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:24,733
NEVER HAD A GLASS OF ALKYL.

19
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,434
I'VE NEVER HAD ALCOHOL."

20
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,302
FOR WHATEVER REASON.

21
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,137
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I HAD?

22
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:30,305
WHAT A MESS I WOULD BE?

23
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:31,840
I WOULD BE THE WORLD'S WORST.

24
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,307
[LAUGHTER]

25
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:33,508
BUT I NEVER DRINK.

26
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:35,310
AN AVERAGE RENT, OKAY?

27
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,278
I CAN TELL YOU.

28
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:39,348
I WATCHED THAT HEARING, HE HAD

29
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:42,984
DIFFICULTY AS A YOUNG MAN WITH A

30
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:43,285
DRINK.

31
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:46,355
ONE QUESTION I DIDN'T ASK IS,

32
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:47,723
HOW ABOUT THE LAST 20 YEARS

33
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:48,924
CUSTOMER DID YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY

34
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:49,224
THEN?

35
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:49,925
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING BAD ABOUT

36
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,194
HIM IN MANY YEARS.

37
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:54,796
THEY GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL.

38
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:59,067
I GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, AND

39
00:00:59,067 --> 00:00:59,735
WHILE I DIDN'T DRINK, I SAW

40
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,336
PEOPLE DRINKING.

41
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:02,304
THEY DRINK BEER, GO CRAZY.

42
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:04,506
THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL PAID

43
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:05,007
16, 17 YEARS OLD.

44
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:08,310
I SAW A LOT OF IT.

45
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,511
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T

46
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:11,113
DO SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO

47
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,514
DO WITH THEIR LIVES?

48
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:13,715
IT'S A VERY TOUGH THING.

49
00:01:13,715 --> 00:00:00,000
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HE WAS
