in a world where every movie TV show and cartoon seems to be pushing some sort of political agenda and undertones well the movie ever just be about what it says it's gonna be about maybe affirm films the star was released nationwide November 17th it is the reselling of the greatest story ever told the birth of Jesus Christ told through the perspective of the animals around them so was this just a cash grab by Hollywood during the Christmas season will the greatest story ever told be altered and watered down and how does this stack up with other biblical cartoons let's find out I'm Ben Davies this is the real rebel Review so the star was made for about $20,000,000 opening weekend and grows ten million dollars directed by timothy record record I think it's either you say his name now a lot of the hub up in this movie another cartoon like it is really the actors and actresses you cast in those roles and this movie has a star-studded cast behind it people like Kevin Young Michael key Christopher Plummer Gabriel Iglesias Gina Rodriguez Kristin Chenoweth Kelly Clarkson Patricia Heaton Anthony Anderson Mariah Carey Tracy Morgan Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey all in this fun little Christmas movie with animals running around and talking and so it's actually pretty fun but a cast can't make a movie good necessarily so how was this well my viewer review is going to be a four out of five now of course this is impossible for me not to be a little bit biased because this is the retelling of the birth of Jesus Christ but just being in the seats and listening to the people I chuckled along with him I was getting teary eyed along with them as well you really have a drawing connection with all the characters where they bounce mom they're fun you root for them it's entertaining it's fast there's comedy and because of the in the eternal ramifications of this moment obviously I was sugar invested the entire time teddy bear the CEO of Movie Guide told me once that if you can make an audience laugh and cry you've made a good movie and it's really hard to argue against that I mean you laugh because bow the awkward donkey and his best friend Dave the masculine dove just go through so many shenanigans throughout it you root for them the entire time and there really are some emotional beats that land throughout and people in the audience will relate to wanting to break away from literally living a life walking in circles to break away and be a call to something hired to be a part of something greater like I said it's fun it's an hour and a half it's entertaining it's clean it's enjoyable it's a great family film and a very solid retelling of the biblical story of the birth of Jesus Christ now there are a few places in this movie where it does slow down there's two places where things are just happening to happen it takes a while for a pickup but you jump right back in the story when you do so I can give it a 5 out of 5 but I put 4 to 5 it's still solid I highly suggest anyone go see with their family with the holiday season now as a critic I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 and I'm gonna do that for a few reasons but first this movie did what it was supposed to do the stories move the characters are all different and interesting they're funny they're charismatic they're entertaining to watch each one of the characters motivations make sense you believed at the entire time and the symbolism is clear but not overwhelming when they talk about the specific struggles with these characters and you show what they're longing for with and what their real purpose and calling and what they can be about it's not overly complex or even young adults won't get it and see what's going on and the kids are gonna laugh and chuckle with the animals and nature of the parents can sit back and chuckle and enjoy the movie as it's going on now the other one is but kids seem to be drawn to these animal talking animal movies or whatever so they will definitely sit there and enjoy it their friends the laugh out loud through a lot of it they might even get emotional a few times adults we can enjoy their time the theatre and chuckle but then also be taken in by the real truce being spoken about in the movie the movie like I said did a good job of putting symbolism in the movie and things you can relate to you know if you're not a Christian you don't know the story entirely we all know what it's like to literally feel like you're locked into a cycle you can continuous cycle going all without spoiling the movie this is kind of what happens in the movie but like getting locked into a cycle and feeling like okay maybe if I break out of here and achieve this one thing then this is gonna be the ultimate for my life not knowing that when you do find that a lot of times it's simply a mirage that you're never going to get to that's never going to fully fulfill you the way as you wanted it to and then you can see right in front of you the thing that you've been dying to be a part of being part of something important and having a purpose and feeling like you've made a difference you could literally be carrying the greatest moment in human history on your back I mean it's it's really cool when you get to step back and watch it even even not from a perspective you can see the truth and the symbolism there now obviously it's gonna be a 5 out of 5 my faith and values in the movie I was impressed they didn't shy away from anything in the in the original story time they did to have the characters pray you see them talk talk to the Angels they didn't shy away from okay maybe this is just an interpretation of the the savior of the world in mankind they've been no bones about what the movie was about and they stayed pretty accurate to the story as much as they could obviously then the three wise men didn't get there you know right the birth of Steve's later but bunch of their stuff but you know it's it's still there they didn't they didn't like water down or alter the story with what I was afraid was gonna happen now is this the best of biblical cartoon told yet no I don't think so but you should still see it the best is still gonna go to the Prince of Egypt you have not seen that movie it is fantastic the story of Moses made in 1998 and if you want to talk about a all-star cast let me just make some people up this is crazy alright so Val Kilmer Michelle Pfeiffer say Bullock jeff goldblum danny glover Patrick Stewart Steve Martin Martin Short I mean what's a good that cartoon cast is it stud cast and it was a great movie the cartoon visual effects are beautiful the soundtrack was tremendous I mean really didn't seen the prints of you really just check that on sale but the star is also great go
