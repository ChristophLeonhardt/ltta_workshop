become any which way they can on foot in buses and trucks Central American migrants crossing into Mexico looking for sanctuary here or in the United States they usually go in small groups but every Easter activists organized this caravan to bring awareness to the plight of those fleeing poverty or criminal gangs in their homelands particularly El Salvador and Honduras it started with threats and I'm a woman and well men can do more than me we couldn't figure out any solutions except to come here and that's it the caravan organizers hope that the sheer numbers will keep them safe from the cartels which often kill and extort migrants and mean that authorities let them stay or pass through so far they've been granted free passage that's infuriated u.s. President Donald Trump who tweeted Mexico is doing very little if not nothing at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their southern border and then into the US that on the whole is not true over the last four years Mexico has drastically tightened up its southern border with the help of funding from the u.s. usually migrants are caught in a web of patrols and checkpoints there have been many accusations of human rights abuses the tolerance for caravans like this one is exception not the rule something Mexican Foreign Minister Luis videgaray highlighted on Trump's preferred battleground he tweeted every day Mexico in the u.s. worked together on migration throughout the region facts clearly reflect this the government here had hoped that its efforts to stop migrants heading through Mexico to the US would help the relationship with the northern neighbor but President Trump doesn't appear to see it that way after learning about the caravan even threatened to call off a trade deal between the countries it's impossible to know how many of the tweeted threats will turn into policy but it's another headache for the Mexican government and an unhappy signal for those who say going home is not an option John Holman al Jazeera Mexico City
