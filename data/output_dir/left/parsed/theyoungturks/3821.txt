EARLIER THIS YEAR DONALD
TRUMP CLAIMED HE WOULD PULL OUT
OF THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT.
TRUMP'S IS A LITTLE BIT OF A
WILD CARD BECAUSE HE GOES BACK
AND FORTH ON ISSUES SEVERAL
TIMES, AND SO RECENTLY THERE WAS
A EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT WHO TOLD
REPORTERS THAT IT SEEMED AS
THOUGH TRUMP HAD SOFTENED ON HIS
STANCE IN REGARD TO THE PARIS
CLIMATE AGREEMENT, MEANING THAT
MAYBE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
THAT THE U.S. WON'T PULL OUT OF
THAT AGREEMENT.
UNFORTUNATELY
GARY COHN, TRUMP'S ECONOMIC
ADVISOR, SPOKE OUT ON THIS ISSUE
AND HE SAYS NO, WE ARE
DEFINITELY PULLING OUT OF THE
PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT.
HE SAID
THAT --
EVERY COUNTRY GETS TO SET
THEIR OWN POLICY, IT'S NOT LIKE
THE EUROPEAN UNION POINTED AT
THE UNITED STATES AND SAYS YOU
HAVE TO DO THIS -- NO, EVERY
COUNTRY SETS ITS GOALS.
THERE IS
NO INTERNATIONAL COP THAT GETS
YOU IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW
THROUGH ON YOUR OWN GOALS.
THAT WAS THE CRITICISM AHEAD
OF TIME, NO ONE WILL HOLD YOUR
FEET TO THE FIRE IF YOU AS A
NATION DON'T MEET, AS ANA SAYS,
VOLUNTARY GOALS.
IT'S SO CRAZY.
EVERY TIME
DONALD TRUMP WAS TO RENEGE ON
SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT THE U.S.
HAS MADE WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES,
IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT, IT'S A BAD
DEAL.
BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT
REALLY A DEAL.
AGAIN, IT'S A SET
OF GOALS EACH COUNTRY HAS
ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE
CHANGE.
HE JUST A BELIEVE IN
CLIMATE CHANGE, SO JUST BE
HONEST ABOUT THAT.
DON'T TALK
ABOUT A BAD DEAL, JUST BE HONEST
THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
CLIMATE CHANGE.
THAT IS TRUE, BUT IF YOU TAKE
IT AS A DEAL, AND I AGREE, IT'S
NOT A DEAL, IT'S AN ACCORD --
EVEN REX TILLERSON, HEAD OF
EXXON MOBIL, SAID IT WAS A BAD
IDEA TO GET OUT OF THIS.
WHY?
BECAUSE ANY BUSINESSMAN, EXCEPT
THE MORON IN THE OVAL OFFICE,
KNOWS THAT IF YOU PULL OUT OF
THIS NO ONE WILL NEGOTIATE WITH
YOU LATER ON.
THERE ARE OTHER
DEALS THAT WILL FOLLOW THIS ON
CLIMATE SPECIFICALLY THAT IF YOU
PULL OUT OF THIS ONE NO ONE WILL
SIT DOWN AND MAKE A DEAL WITH
YOU.
EVEN TILLERSON KNEW THAT,
THE FACE OF THE PETROLEUM
INDUSTRY.
IT'S ASTONISHING WHAT A BAD
BUSINESSMAN THIS IS.
TILLERSON DID MENTION
GREENHOUSE GASES, AND YOU CAN'T
GET THESE PEOPLE TO MENTION
THOSE LOTS OF THE TIME.
THAT IS
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT, WHICH IS
WARMING THE GLOBE.
I WAS
ENCOURAGED BY THAT.
AND THIS IS
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE TOUGH
TALK ON THE STUMP I WAS TALKING
ABOUT BEFORE NOW BEING THE THING
THAT DRIVES POLICY.
AND THAT IS
WHAT REALLY CONCERNS ME MOVING
FORWARD.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE
TOUGH TALK IS WHAT YOU NEEDED TO
GET INTO OFFICE, THEN THINGS
WOULD SOFTEN ONCE WE LOOK AT
THINGS AND REALLY EVALUATE WHAT
THINGS WE CAN BE TOUGH ON AND
WHAT WE SHOULDN'T BE.
LIKE THE
IRAN DEAL, THE PARIS ACCORDS --
THESE THINGS ARE FINE.
IT WAS
GREAT THAT YOU TALKED TOUGH ON
THE STUMP BUT NOW YOU ARE IN.
NOW LET'S EVALUATE THINGS BASED
ON FACTS.
TO HAVE HIS TOUGH TALK
DRIVE POLICY, LIKE THE WALL -- I
MEAN, I GET IT, EVERYONE GETS IN
A FERVOR OVER THE WALL BUT YOU
DIDN'T REALLY MEAN YOU WANT TO
BUILD AN EFFING WALL.
WHAT HIS TOUGH TALK, HIS
RHETORIC, IS DRIVING POLICY.
THIS IS HORRIFYING.
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.
IF YOU WERE
OUT ON THE TRAIL ALL THROUGH
2017, EVERY REPUBLICAN WOULD
OPEN THEIR SPEECHES SAYING THE
FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IN MY
FIRST 100 DAYS IS TEAR UP THIS I
RUN DEAL.
THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO
IS GET RID OF HEALTHCARE,
REPEAL AND REPLACE.
AS THE OPPOSITION PARTY, THAT
IS WHAT YOU DO TO ENGAGE IN
POLITICS.
TED CRUZ, IT WAS IN
HIS BLOOD TO DO WHAT HE SAID HE
WAS GOING TO DO.
THAT'S WHY HE
LOST, AND LOST PRETTY BADLY.
BUT
YOU KNEW HE KNEW IT.
YOU KNOW HE
UNDERSTOOD IT AND JUST DIDN'T
LIKE THIS PART OF GOVERNMENT.
WITH DONALD TRUMP, HE HAS NO
CLUE ABOUT IT, IT'S A VISCERAL
THING TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE TO GET
CHEERS.
IT'S A VISCERAL THING TO
APPEAL TO HIS BASE.
AND MEMBER,
TRUMP HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN
ANYTHING LEGISLATIVELY.
REPEALING AND REPLACING THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS AN
EMBARRASSING FAILURE, AND HE
SHOWED HOW INCREDIBLY
INCOMPETENT HE WAS AS
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AS THE HEAD
OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
HE WAS
PRETTY MUCH M.I.A THROUGH ALL
THE DRAMA THAT OCCURRED IN THE
SENATE, AND HE FAILED.
IT'S EASY
TO THROW SOME RED MEAT TO HIS
BASE BY SAYING I GOT RID OF THE
PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT, I WILL
RENEGE ON THE IRAN DEAL, THESE
ARE ALL EASY THINGS FOR HIM TO
DO TO APPEAL TO THEM AND MAKE IT
SEEM LIKE HE'S ACCOMPLISHING
THINGS.
THE TRANSGENDER BAN IN
THE MILITARY, THAT'S ANOTHER
EXAMPLE.
HE TWEETED THAT OUT OF
NOWHERE WITHOUT ADVISING WITH A
SINGLE PERSON.
HE'S NOT THE
SMARTEST PERSON, HE'S NOT THE
BRIGHTEST PERSON, BUT THAT WAS
IN MY OPINION A STRATEGY.
THAT'S THE THING.
AT THE END
OF THE DAY HE'S GIVING THINGS --
AND THE ONES YOU JUST MENTIONED,
HE'S GIVING THINGS TO REPUBLICAN
NUMBERS OF CONGRESS TO TAKE BACK
TO THEIR DISTRICTS AND SAY I
VOTED FOR THIS, I VOTED FOR THIS
-- AND THESE ARE ALL
NONCONTROVERSIAL ISSUES AMONGST
THE DEEP REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE.
BUT AGAIN, THAT TWEET DROVE
POLICY.
FIRST THE MILITARY SAID
NOTHING, BUT ULTIMATELY THEY'VE
HAD TO CATCH UP WITH THAT
RHETORIC, WITH THE TRANSGENDER
BAN.
IT'S NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF IT
OR THAT IT'S NOT FRIGHTENING
WHEN THESE HAPPEN, BUT IT'S
POLITICAL, IT'S FOR GAIN, AND
IT'S SAFE FOR A REPUBLICAN TO DO
THESE THINGS.
