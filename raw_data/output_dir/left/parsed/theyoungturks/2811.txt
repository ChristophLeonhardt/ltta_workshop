>>DARRELL ISSA, IN A TOUGH
FIGHT, MAYBE THE FIGHT OF HIS
POLITICAL LIFE, WHAT'S HE GOING
TO DO?
LET'S FIND OUT --
>>[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM.]
>>DOWN GOES ISSA.
MANN, DOUG
APPLEGATE KNOCKED HIM THE FUCK
OUT.
APPLEGATE WAS HIS OPPONENT
LAST TIME, IT WAS THE CLOSEST
RACE IN THE COUNTRY, APPLEGATE
SAID I'M COMING FOR YOU, ISSA
WAS LIKE, I'M RUNNING, I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN THAT FIGHT.
IT'S
GOING TO BE A REAL BAD YEAR FOR
REPUBLICANS.
DONALD TRUMP IS IN
FANTASYLAND SO HE DOESN'T
REALIZE THAT A 32% APPROVAL
RATING FOR HIMSELF IS
DISASTROUS.
IT WILL HURT THE
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS
TREMENDOUSLY.
REGULAR RULES OF
ORDER STILL APPLY, REALITY STILL
APPLIES.
JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE
UP AGAINST THE MOST UNPOPULAR
CANDIDATE EVER DOESN'T MEAN ALL
THESE GUYS WILL BE UP AGAINST
UNPOPULAR CANDIDATES.
ISSA IS UP
AGAINST APPLEGATE WHO WAS A
JUSTICE DEMOCRAT, THAT MEANS HE
DOESN'T TAKE ANY CORPORATE PAC
MONEY, HONEST, GRASSROOTS,
UNCORRUPTED, PROGRESSIVE, HIS
DISTRICT IS BECOMING MORE
PROGRESSIVE -- ? NA NA NA NA.
HE
WAS A GONER ANYWAY, HE WAS
RUNNING FROM THIS FIGHT, HE WAS
SCARED THAT APPLEGATE WAS GOING
TO KILL HIM, AND HE WAS, HE WAS
GOING TO EMBARRASS HIM.
LOOK AT THE OVERALL CONTEXT, WE
GO TO MOTHER JONES --
>>[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM]
>>SURE, DOWN GOES ROYCE, BUT
HE'S NOT THAT RELEVANT A FIGURE.
ISSA WAS THE HATCHET MAN FOR
REPUBLICANS, HE DID ALL THE
NONSENSE INVESTIGATIONS OF
DEMOCRATS THAT WERE TOTALLY
POLITICALLY DRIVEN, AND HE WAS
ONE OF THE WORST REPUBLICANS.
SO
THE FACT THAT A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT
HAS CHASED HIM OUT OF THAT SEAT
IS AWESOME.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU
DON'T KNOW, DOUG APPLEGATE IS
THE GUY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
HERE, LET'S SHOW YOU A PICTURE
BECAUSE YOU WILL GET TO KNOW
HIM, HOPEFULLY HE WILL BE YOUR
NEXT U.S. CONGRESSMAN FROM THIS
DISTRICT, AND HERE ARE HIS LINKS
BY THE WAY, THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO LET UP, IT'S THE TIME TO HIT
THE GAS PEDAL EVEN HARDER.
AT
THIS POINT NOW CORPORATE
DEMOCRATS WILL PROBABLY GET REAL
THIRSTY AND TRY TO COME IN AND
MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE WHO
SUPPORTED BERNIE SANDERS DOESN'T
WIN THAT RACE.
THEY DIDN'T GIVE
HIM MUCH SUPPORT LAST TIME
AROUND AT THE MOST BEAT ISSA
ANYWAY.
APPLEGATE PUT OUT A
QUOTE SAYING --
>>COLONEL, WE NEED YOU TO TAKE
THAT HILL.
AND I BELIEVE HE
WILL.
AND APPARENTLY DARRELL
ISSA BELIEVES HE WILL, SO 
HE IS
GOING, GOING, GONE.
