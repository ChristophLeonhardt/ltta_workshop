24
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,250
good so yeah so what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question</font>

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,979
yeah so when climate change is reported

26
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the news it can seem like such a</font>

27
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,150
intangible force something that has yet

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come but the effects are playing out</font>

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,250
all over the world yet many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people still</font>

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,710
consider it a low priority how do you

31
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">think journalists can better cover the</font>

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,900
physical current effects of climate

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,700
change on people and ecosystems um you

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I think you you almost kind of</font>

35
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,990
touched upon the answer in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

36
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,320
question you know climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change I think</font>

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,670
many people do think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font>

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,009
something it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of very abstract and</font>

39
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,149
something that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen in the</font>

40
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but like you said these you know</font>

41
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,350
we're seeing climate change happen all

42
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,780
the time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our day-to-day lives whether</font>

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,149
it be more intense more frequent

44
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,340
hurricanes hitting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the east</font>

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,110
coast of the United States more intense

46
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,318
frequent cyclones in the Pacific and I

47
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,870
think bringing climate change from the

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,230
ABS

49
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">tract and from the future into something</font>

50
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can you can talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in these</font>

51
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of day-to-day these day-to-day</font>

52
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,440
events these these headline-grabbing

53
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,190
events you know you know natural

54
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,230
disasters and whatnot so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

55
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,739
one way the other way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

56
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,319
you know to really tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

57
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,879
gripping you know stories about people

58
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,900
who are either impacted by climate

59
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,170
change were you know we're looking in

60
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,349
our scientists who were<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking into the</font>

61
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,269
impacts of climate change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their</font>

62
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,280
effects on you know storms or

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,040
temperature or what's happening in with

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,819
the polar ice caps you know like I think

65
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">nay has chaste tree was on last week</font>

66
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about her documentary the</font>

67
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,900
documentary that her and iris produced

68
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,280
on coal ash contamination in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. I</font>

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,410
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a story that I think you</font>

70
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,060
know on the surface of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's an</font>

71
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,410
environmental story not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a climate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

72
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,180
story but I think there's a lesson to be

73
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,190
learned and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did which was you</font>

74
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,139
know coal ash is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's the</font>

75
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,630
 that like you know is produced

76
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,730
after you burn coal it's not necessarily

77
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,139
on the surface of it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a very sexy</font>

78
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,049
topic but what they did was and I

79
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought they did a great job at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

80
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,419
finding people who were impacted by that

81
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,510
water contamination and showing you know

82
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,280
the kind of emotion of that what that

83
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,590
felt like and what it felt like I mean

84
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,910
there was a there was a moment where

85
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,060
they're interviewing a mother and you

86
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,790
know she describes the moment where she

87
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,870
learned that her water was contaminated

88
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,870
and she she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like well you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

89
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,370
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all the times her kids</font>

90
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,139
were drinking that water and he could

91
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,940
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I think very much feel</font>

92
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,220
the concern that she had for her kids

93
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,629
and the way that that can that

94
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,629
contamination impacted their lives and

95
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:04,980
the concern that that brought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

96
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,790
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's that's a very similar</font>

97
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,930
strategy for talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> climate</font>

98
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,879
change which is you know when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hurricane</font>

99
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,609
sandy hit New York you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out in</font>

100
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:16,910
the communities that oftentimes aren't

101
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,070
represented in the media and going out

102
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,570
to those places and talking to people

103
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,130
about how climate climate change

104
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,020
impacted them and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you</font>

105
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,700
know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting you know story</font>

106
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,450
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on with</font>

107
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,160
you know scientists investigating what's

108
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,850
happening in the Arctic or Antarctica

109
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,320
and then you know politicians were

110
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
people in direct action movements that

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,370
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very hard to essentially</font>

112
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,140
euthanize the fossil fuel industry and

113
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,210
so I think it's like you know just

114
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,920
really getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> down into the</font>

115
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,360
nitty-gritty of like how climate change

116
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,970
is impacting people and you know what

117
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,610
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and trying to highlight some of</font>

118
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the characters whether they be you know</font>

119
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,750
champions for action on climate change

120
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,390
or you know fossil fuel interests or

121
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,030
political interest opposed to regulation

122
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,740
of the marketplace you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind</font>

123
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,050
of like focusing in on those individuals

124
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,020
which i think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish up</font>

125
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that that makes</font>

126
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,280
climate change although<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has some very</font>

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,680
particular challenges you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

128
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,360
like you were saying it's it's thought

129
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,890
of as abstract it's not about in the

130
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,870
future you know it's similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

131
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">any other stories that that journalists</font>

132
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,040
deal with which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how to make how to</font>

133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,440
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that story interesting to people</font>

134
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,240
that might not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with it or</font>

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,060
might not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested that but yeah so</font>

136
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,160
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean what what why do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you ask that</font>

137
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,730
question what's what what about that

138
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,860
well I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I just feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot</font>

139
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people tend to a lot of the articles</font>

140
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,250
coming out on climate change are not

141
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,230
might not interest so many people

142
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,810
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so so much of it is focused</font>

143
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the science or things that or</font>

144
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,070
communities that are so far removed from

145
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,600
America or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> west where climate change</font>

146
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,350
is not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much a priority for people</font>

147
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,040
yeah so and it being such an important

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">issue to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of raise it to a higher</font>

149
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,930
priority by highlighting the actual

150
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,940
current effects yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious</font>

151
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,970
what you think as an editor of how

152
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,400
journalists can do a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> job of that</font>

153
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah no I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I mean you bring up a</font>

154
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,590
very good point which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know you</font>

155
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,200
know each morning we meet at 9am in the

156
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,820
office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have our edit meetings and</font>

157
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,260
we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what stories we're going</font>

158
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,500
to assign for the day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very</font>

159
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,080
interested in what scientists are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

160
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,030
to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine how climate change</font>

161
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,689
is impacting you know you know the

162
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,939
climate system how burning how human

163
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,860
beings burning fossil fuels how that's

164
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,050
affecting you know perhaps the frequency

165
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,599
and intensity of tornadoes or trying to

166
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,460
determine the level of sea level rise or

167
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,590
what's happening in the ice caps but

168
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,710
those stories you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know while I find them</font>

169
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,469
super interesting may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be the stories</font>

170
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that really connect people with climate</font>

171
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,009
change so much and I think you know

172
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">going back to what you initially said at</font>

173
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,870
the beginning is you know bringing think

174
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,479
the key is bringing stories connecting

175
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,509
readers connecting viewers to people

176
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,849
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are impacted by this stuff or</font>

177
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,319
investigating and really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

178
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,139
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a bit more character-driven</font>

179
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,370
but it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a challenge and</font>

180
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,409
now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

181
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any silver bullet for how to convey</font>

182
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,560
the the the potential I don't want a

183
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,509
potential calamity of climate change

184
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,400
over the next century you know it's an

185
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,960
alarming issue but it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a</font>

186
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,310
challenge to convey that but but thank

187
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,419
you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your thank you for a question</font>

188
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">and yeah yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks yeah you bet your</font>

189
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,669
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right Michael so who do</font>

190
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,469
we who's up next hey so Robert we have

191
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,270
Edward a video message that you sent us

192
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,710
on skype take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to this hi Robert</font>

193
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,960
my name is edward harris and i'm

194
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,449
currently in<font color="#E5E5E5"> raleigh north carolina my</font>

195
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,180
question is now the climate change can

196
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,849
no longer be debated what technologies

197
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,680
are being developed to help the everyday

198
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,810
citizen adjust to the new climate

199
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,050
scenario moreover will climate<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

200
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,589
further exacerbate social inequality

201
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:27,710
thank you so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean taking the</font>

202
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,889
technology question first I think it's

203
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,669
important to establish that technology

204
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,339
alone will not address the core<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

205
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,750
of climate change<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the core problem</font>

206
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">what kind of change is that economies</font>

207
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,310
are burning too much fossil fuels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

208
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's emitting greenhouse gases into the</font>

209
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,080
atmosphere<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the scent</font>

210
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,120
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> the central problem is how to</font>

211
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,610
how to reduce the amount of fossil fuels

212
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">going into the atmosphere technology is</font>

213
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,170
not necessarily technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take us</font>

214
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,420
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way but really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got to</font>

215
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,390
like develop new ways of producing

216
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,860
electricity and producing goods and

217
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,280
services there's already existing

218
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,200
technologies that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be ramped up very</font>

219
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
very quickly in the US and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

220
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,680
the world their solar technologies their

221
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,160
wind energy technologies they're the one

222
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,690
of the more controversial debates around

223
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,060
the role of Technology in addressing

224
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,800
climate change<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's called</font>

225
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,370
geoengineering and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of</font>

226
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,120
deploying one of two engineering

227
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,410
technological you know technologies one

228
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,220
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> to block incoming solar energy</font>

229
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,120
block incoming sunlight before it gets

230
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the lower levels of the atmosphere</font>

231
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,220
and the other technology would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

232
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,590
remove carbon<font color="#CCCCCC"> dioxide from the</font>

233
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,620
atmosphere to help you know bring down

234
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,990
global<font color="#E5E5E5"> temperatures or help alleviate</font>

235
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,380
some of the some of the future warming

236
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,400
that may happen so so you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

237
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,630
are those are quite controversial

238
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,330
because it it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> continues there's</font>

239
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,030
like a lot of ethical and juridical

240
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,200
concerns about how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

241
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,480
because you can imagine and just to

242
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,000
explain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies a bit with</font>

243
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,660
blocking income coming solar energy it's

244
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be essentially</font>

245
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting up air you know replicating you</font>

246
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,940
know volcanoes putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up aerosols into</font>

247
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,890
the upper levels of the atmosphere that

248
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,470
would block incoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> solar solar energy</font>

249
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,020
the other would be sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feeding</font>

250
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,260
seeding clouds that would you know block

251
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,090
some incoming solar energy now the

252
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,220
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know again it</font>

253
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,070
doesn't get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core cause of global</font>

254
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,720
warming which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that human beings are</font>

255
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,330
just you know spewing too much

256
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,340
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere but

257
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can imagine some of the geopolitical</font>

258
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,490
concerns

259
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,290
the geopolitical scenarios that might

260
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,050
play out which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like well India wants</font>

261
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,779
to deploy this technology but you know

262
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,820
it messes<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the atmosphere in such a</font>

263
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,980
way that could cause you know some

264
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,649
droughts in China and so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

265
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,089
of governance issues around that and I

266
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:25,339
think more or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less there's a consensus</font>

267
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,290
that those types of technologies should

268
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,839
really not be considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a large</font>

269
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,339
scale because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems that they</font>

270
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,620
could that they could cause the other

271
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,899
the other geo engineering technology one

272
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,000
which would pull carbon dioxide out of

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,950
the atmosphere and then you could

274
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,140
condense it and shove it back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

275
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,630
ground from where it came that is widely

276
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,880
seen as something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

277
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">beneficial to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> society but that</font>

278
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,020
technology is not at a scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at a</font>

279
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,430
level of development that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

280
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,690
deployed so you know that's that there's

281
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,149
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of debate around</font>

282
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,529
geoengineering there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

283
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,270
technologies that currently exists that

284
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,420
could be ramped up you know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

285
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,730
you know as I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out saying</font>

286
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,810
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> can play a role in addressing</font>

287
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,480
climate change but it doesn't get us out

288
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,209
of the central problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

289
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:19,490
to stop burning as many fossil fuels as

290
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,550
we do that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great answer Robert you</font>

291
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,440
ready for your next<font color="#CCCCCC"> question wait and he</font>

292
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,720
had but he had a second part of that

293
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,430
<font color="#E5E5E5"> I part of it he was asking about</font>

294
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,380
how climate<font color="#E5E5E5"> change could exacerbate</font>

295
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,810
social inequality yeah so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I mean</font>

296
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,190
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really interesting way of</font>

297
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,260
looking at climate change which is you

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,149
know although climate change often gets

299
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:41,360
discussed as an issue of it in and of

300
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,690
itself and it is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

301
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,130
be addressed you know we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

302
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,079
eliminate you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to cut down</font>

303
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,820
and dramatically cut down on the amount

304
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,550
of fossil fuels that we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn the</font>

305
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,950
impacts of climate change are going

306
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,050
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be grafted over already</font>

307
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing social issues so if you look at</font>

308
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> width but if you look at sort of the</font>

309
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,570
issue of poverty income inequality

310
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,420
climate change can potentially have you

311
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,420
know can potentially exacerbate those

312
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,540
inequalities you know to a very

313
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,640
significant degree you know again going

314
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,329
back to Hurricane sandy that hit

315
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,119
hit his<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York you know the community</font>

316
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,499
some of the communities that were hit

317
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:27,589
the hardest are also ones that you know

318
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,679
are the poorest in in the city and so

319
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,519
getting aid to those communities you

320
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">know for whether that be first</font>

321
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:38,509
responders or government assistance in

322
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:41,059
rebuilding homes or potentially

323
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,129
relocating people farther away from the

324
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">coast and anticipation of future storms</font>

325
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,829
I mean these are you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

326
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,629
is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one example of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

327
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,629
that you see climate change you know

328
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:55,910
exacerbating already already existing

329
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,829
inequalities and I think that will

330
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:00,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to be the case you know in the</font>

331
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,899
US and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world until you</font>

332
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,069
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core issue of inequality is is</font>

333
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:09,259
addressed and I think there's you know

334
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,790
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the climate change movement</font>

335
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,809
within the climate justice movement

336
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,350
there is there's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want</font>

337
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,089
to say increasing but there's a

338
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,790
significant number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font>

339
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,470
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in equality with the need</font>

340
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,419
to address climate change tie those two

341
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,939
together because climate change impacts

342
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,829
people differently and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> impacts poor</font>

343
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:34,189
people much more significantly then then

344
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:36,649
then say you know focus on the hot the

345
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,509
higher income levels the one percent as

346
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,110
it were so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you answered his</font>

347
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,910
question perfectly great thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

348
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,189
Michael so what's a who's up who's up

349
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:47,749
next what's up next<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we've got Hailie</font>

350
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,399
calling us<font color="#E5E5E5"> on skype from Washington DC</font>

351
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool hey Ellie hello I keep on like say</font>

352
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">I keep on saying hello at the exact same</font>

353
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,970
time is the person in on skype so hello

354
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">hailey alright so my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is we have</font>

355
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,059
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten last years of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

356
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:08,470
hottest on record 2014 specifically and

357
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,119
then we have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like these massive</font>

358
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,339
snow days in Washington<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC which is why</font>

359
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,989
I'm home and you have great<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

360
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,059
Jim and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hof that bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> snowballs</font>

361
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,119
and person it and use that as quote

362
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,040
unquote proof that climate change isn't

363
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,799
real yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think most rational people</font>

364
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,689
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is but it's kind of</font>

365
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,339
terrifying that these people are in

366
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:31,209
positions of power and you know

367
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,529
determining how we handle climate change

368
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:34,130
at least

369
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,940
in America<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do in response</font>

370
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,740
to that how do we make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a voter</font>

371
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,620
issue how do we kind of push back on

372
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,350
these theories that because we

373
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,110
have snow climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change isn't real and</font>

374
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,090
make this go down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the American people</font>

375
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,700
and get back up into our government as a

376
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,880
priority ya know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great question</font>

377
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,610
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> chip Michael I think we have a clip</font>

378
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,670
actually of the Inhofe snowball snowball

379
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,850
right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> climate change</font>

380
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're confirming Inhofe there's</font>

381
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely no climate change in in</font>

382
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,350
Washington DC right well I'm until 2015

383
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,360
is the hottest year on record right yeah

384
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,600
so probably gonna happen well here's

385
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,880
this I mean here's the thing so Inhofe

386
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,360
has made a career out of these kind of

387
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,900
stunts couple years ago his wife and

388
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,140
kids constructed an igloo down in DC and

389
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,420
like said like oh it's Al Gore's home

390
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,490
you know poking fun at Al Gore because

391
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,490
he's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a champion of climate change</font>

392
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,990
he's you know Inhofe's called climate

393
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,310
change the greatest hoax ever

394
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,380
perpetrated on the American public and

395
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,160
he's often times used weather which has

396
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">not climate to say that there's no</font>

397
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,270
there's no climate change I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

398
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,110
this is and he plays into I think a a

399
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,720
common misunderstanding of the

400
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,190
difference between weather and climate

401
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,860
and just tries to sow confusion and

402
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,390
there's a long history of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

403
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">the climate change the fossil fuel</font>

404
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,240
industry the the political interests

405
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,880
that they fund whether they be elected

406
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,849
officials or people in think tanks use

407
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,640
that confusion to sow doubt about what

408
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,920
is a scientific certainty ninety-seven

409
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,839
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you know this</font>

410
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,730
ninety-seven percent of qualified

411
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,180
climate scientists say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a the world</font>

412
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,130
is warming and be it's because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

413
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,700
human beings there's no serious

414
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,500
scientific debate going on about either

415
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,970
of those two things there may be

416
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,310
scientific debate about say what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

417
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,150
what's the impact of climate change on I

418
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,220
mean does it make<font color="#E5E5E5"> tornadoes more</font>

419
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,230
frequent and more intense how does it

420
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,460
affect say the Indian monsoon

421
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,580
how does it affect rainfall patterns in

422
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,409
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> African Sahel I mean those</font>

423
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,529
are you know interesting ongoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> robust</font>

424
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,510
scientific debates going on but that

425
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,340
core issue of like climate change exists

426
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,110
it's happening and it's caused by<font color="#E5E5E5"> humans</font>

427
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,760
it's like there's no debate about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

428
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,820
but in half you know uses that confusion

429
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,080
about the difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> weather and</font>

430
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,130
climate to continue to so this so this

431
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,600
you know this doubt about it and you

432
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they're actually tomorrow I believe</font>

433
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,850
there's a documentary that's premiering

434
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,279
called merchants of doubt and that's

435
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,899
based off of a book done by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

436
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:24,179
historians of scientists who really dig

437
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,679
into the the intellectual history of

438
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,760
climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change deniers and it goes back</font>

439
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">through sowing doubt about the ozone</font>

440
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,559
hole<font color="#E5E5E5"> sowing doubt about connecting</font>

441
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,659
pesticides to disease to you know

442
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,960
transformations of you know genetic

443
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,840
genetic makeup going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

444
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,850
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> between tobacco smoking and</font>

445
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,250
cancer and so there's a long history of

446
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,620
this and the tactics you know are used

447
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,299
over and over again which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just so</font>

448
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,210
doubt create doubt and that way people

449
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,470
will say like hey there's an ongoing

450
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,140
debate when there's really not so I

451
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,480
don't know I'm dead what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

452
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,760
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so I mean you know</font>

453
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,399
bringing back the tobacco industry they

454
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,590
were largely funding political campaigns

455
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,330
and bankrolling a lot of lobbyists and

456
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,799
<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that's why they were so</font>

457
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,360
successful for so long until people

458
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,100
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized that cigarettes were</font>

459
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,440
still bad for you and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

460
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,850
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fossil fuel industry is</font>

461
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,450
definitely contributing largely to some

462
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,559
of these people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are still take not</font>

463
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,480
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> action on climate change because</font>

464
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,039
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the benefits that they're getting for</font>

465
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,450
themselves personally and for their

466
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,010
campaigns not at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their</font>

467
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,510
constituents obviously or else we

468
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,340
wouldn't have this issue so then what

469
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,590
what can we do to kind of go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

470
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,929
or over them to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that this</font>

471
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:51,000
issue is still being addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

472
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,549
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> even China is coming out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

473
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:55,590
measures to reduce their global

474
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,510
greenhouse gas in their carbon emissions

475
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,270
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Hoffs</font>

476
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,700
in the pocket of<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah coal industry</font>

477
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,020
maybe someone should tell them that

478
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,700
those are still union jobs and he'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

479
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,090
off that yeah now ya know excellent

480
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,710
point you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

481
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,560
you you you mentioned perhaps an

482
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,210
interesting political strategy about

483
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,980
this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm a journalist I'm not</font>

484
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,590
out there doing political organizing but

485
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,720
you know you mentioned this idea of just

486
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,910
going around them and indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you look</font>

487
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,230
at most polls of public perception about

488
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,210
climate change there's like a majority

489
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,620
of people that do believe it exists and

490
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,300
that humans are causing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

491
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,380
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be done about it</font>

492
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,270
there's widespread public support for

493
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,720
action on climate change and so you know

494
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,520
why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> go around them why not just</font>

495
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,740
organize people that are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> board to</font>

496
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,390
address climate change why fixate on

497
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,640
trying to convince those that don't

498
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe in believe it that deny it</font>

499
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,650
exists and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's an interesting</font>

500
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,450
political question and it raises

501
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,240
journalistic questions to which is you

502
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,230
know do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in in cover in covering the</font>

503
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,180
issue of climate change<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you include</font>

504
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,390
the voices of climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change deniers and</font>

505
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,640
I think the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no because if we</font>

506
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,530
were doing if we were if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were here</font>

507
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,990
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the aviation industry I</font>

508
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,730
wouldn't you know would we would we

509
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,800
suggest would you suggest including

510
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,240
somebody that doesn't believe in in

511
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,280
gravity you know it would just be absurd

512
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think with you know with you</font>

513
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both politics and with with you</font>

514
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">know looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a political issue</font>

515
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,750
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know maybe maybe it is a</font>

516
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,450
wise thing to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around them and not get</font>

517
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,560
too concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> climate change</font>

518
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,640
deniers but the problem arises<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

519
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,540
know we're not talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about just</font>

520
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,250
members of the public that are denying

521
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,450
climate change we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

522
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">people like Jim Inhofe who are in</font>

523
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,260
positions of power and it's not I mean

524
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,450
James Inhofe who denies climate change

525
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,630
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like snowball stun he oversees</font>

526
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,550
he's on the the the Senate committed the

527
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,080
Senate Energy and Natural Resources

528
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,090
Committee this is a man<font color="#CCCCCC"> that oversees</font>

529
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,000
you know regulations proposed by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EPA</font>

530
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,310
and is overseeing implementation of

531
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,310
Obama's climate change rules his rules

532
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,610
to limit greenhouse gas emissions from

533
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,230
power plants and from industry around

534
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,770
the country

535
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,180
so that is why in in half is so alarming

536
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,010
in a way it's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's in a position of</font>

537
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,420
power he's not just some night as a

538
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,400
private citizen I can't go and you know

539
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">start dealing out carbon taxes yeah</font>

540
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,510
that's right that's right yeah so we

541
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,430
ought to get Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> an half to do it yeah</font>

542
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,950
well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I think you bring up</font>

543
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,960
an interesting point which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why not go</font>

544
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,420
to Oklahoma and start<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

545
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,780
constituents about like hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

546
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,850
many of the the jobs that have been

547
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,580
created since the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Great Recession you</font>

548
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,890
know one of the fastest growing sectors

549
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,140
is renewable energy production you know

550
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,580
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an economic issue for a lot of</font>

551
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,720
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right thanks thanks so much</font>

552

quick tweet yes so what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two you</font>

555
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,610
could answer us this<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly</font>

556
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,660
what is the difference between climate

557
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,860
and weather I know you started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get at</font>

558
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">this but yeah I think there's a lot of</font>

559
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,300
confusion nothing yeah so yeah so a

560
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,050
perfect perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweet question so the</font>

561
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference between weather and climate</font>

562
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,440
really comes back to really gets down to

563
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,300
what scale of time you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

564
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,690
weather is what happens you know from

565
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,510
minute to minute day-to-day up to you

566
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,790
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a week it's how hot is it</font>

567
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,970
outside right now is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> raining it's</font>

568
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,800
weather is looking at temperature

569
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,740
precipitation what's the visibility

570
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,640
today is it is it foggy is it clear how

571
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,120
humid is it but on very very short time

572
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,410
scales that's what we're talking about

573
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,300
when we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at weather now</font>

574
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,460
climate is what one expects to happen

575
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,290
over long periods of time climate is

576
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,570
most scientists say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need to</font>

577
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,240
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and out what the the average</font>

578
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,580
temperature what the average

579
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,590
precipitation pattern is over at least

580
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,410
at a minimum 30 years three decades but

581
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,330
oftentimes climate is something that's

582
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,900
determined over centuries of looking at

583
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,270
of looking at temperature and

584
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,060
precipitation data you know whether is

585
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,670
what what is what is the atmospheric

586
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,420
conditions

587
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,730
like right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> climate is what you</font>

588
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,220
expect to happen you know here in in the

589
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,910
northeast of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States we expect</font>

590
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,190
you know our expectations of the climate

591
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,170
are that temperatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

592
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,450
cooler in the winter than they are in

593
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,730
the summer during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the summer we're not</font>

594
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,010
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get snow but during the winter</font>

595
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,280
we are going to get snow and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

596
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,870
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question it's a question of</font>

597
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,320
scale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like I was discussing</font>

598
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,520
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Haley you know those to the</font>

599
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">confusion between those two oftentimes</font>

600
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,760
gets used by climate change deniers to

601
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,090
you know so doubt about climate change

602
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,820
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great answer so I let's say our</font>

603
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,890
next caller I we have Nora calling this

604
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,490
on skype from Washington<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC great hi</font>

605
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,080
Robert how are you good<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you doing</font>

606
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,600
nor I'm good thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> note snow day</font>

607
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,310
in DC yes no day in DC so a few days<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

608
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vice published an article</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say to earth</font>

609
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,910
citing climate change is one of the

610
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,040
causes 11 of the likely causes for the

611
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,020
uprising in Syria yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so but the</font>

612
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,410
article<font color="#E5E5E5"> also states that the driest</font>

613
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,030
point of the drought was recorded in

614
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,420
2008 however the uprisings themselves

615
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,450
did not start until 2011 with the

616
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,630
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the calls for reform being a</font>

617
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,490
change in the government and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the removal</font>

618
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,910
are the lifting of you know martial law

619
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,170
as well as expanded civil rights so I

620
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,050
was wondering what you thought about

621
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,970
like where exactly is the nexus between

622
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,850
climate change and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the uprising in Syria</font>

623
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,730
because it seems that it it seems to

624
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,930
have been a more politically motivated

625
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,460
uprising as opposed to something related

626
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,730
to climate yeah I I you know I would

627
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,860
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a politically</font>

628
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,780
motivated<font color="#E5E5E5"> uprising and i think i think</font>

629
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the researchers in the report would</font>

630
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,780
probably agree and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a site</font>

631
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,370
just as background for those who don't

632
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,360
know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report that came out</font>

633
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,730
authored by researchers at columbia

634
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,140
university and the university calif

635
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,920
at Santa Barbara<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what they what they</font>

636
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,670
found or what they're arguing is that

637
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:52,040
the that the drought that occurred prior

638
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,640
to the 2011 uprising was the most severe

639
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,060
drought ever recorded in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fertile</font>

640
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,150
Crescent in Syria northern Iraq and that

641
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,510
what that drought did was drive roughly

642
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,150
a million and a half people from

643
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,510
agricultural areas in Syria into cities

644
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,410
and what happens when and also that you

645
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,960
know the lack of sound agricultural

646
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,210
policies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part of the the syrian</font>

647
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,490
state drove people out of the

648
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,670
agricultural lands into cities where

649
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,450
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them most of them you know had</font>

650
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,550
very difficult lives perhaps defined by

651
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,900
unemployment lack of adequate housing

652
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,210
access to utilities access to food<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

653
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:43,490
that these people also became part of a

654
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,290
social movement demanding reforms from

655
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,990
the Assad regime and so what what the

656
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,610
scientists are saying and I think you

657
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what we what what I think we</font>

658
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,880
conveyed through the piece is that

659
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,300
climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change didn't cause the Syrian</font>

660
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,200
uprising but was an aggravating factor

661
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,410
in that uprising and that you know

662
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,850
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was in Syria in</font>

663
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,010
2008 I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reporting there I</font>

664
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,890
was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Egypt in 2012 doing some</font>

665
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,820
reporting after the the fall of Mubarak

666
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,480
and you know obviously people have

667
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,200
long-standing political grievances in in

668
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,680
Syria in Egypt many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

669
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,830
the role of the Tunisian uprising as

670
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,410
inspiring them to take up you know to

671
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">take to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the streets to try to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

672
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,820
topple the the Mubarak regime so

673
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,170
obviously there's all sorts of like

674
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">political issues there's influence of</font>

675
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,900
other other uprisings in the region but

676
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,160
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what the scientists are saying</font>

677
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,740
is like climate change also<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced the</font>

678
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,970
social dislocation

679
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,809
that added to the political tensions and

680
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:59,679
this is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a controversial</font>

681
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,909
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a controversial idea i mean</font>

682
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is even something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the u.s. the</font>

683
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,559
u.s. Pentagon talks about they call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

684
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,860
force multiplier that climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change you</font>

685
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,330
know as I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying before with the</font>

686
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,250
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inequality climate changes</font>

687
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,890
grafted over these pre-existing things

688
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,280
and just makes them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more prone to</font>

689
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,929
conflict and yeah so I don't know

690
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,700
hopefully that answers answers your

691
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,860
question but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know just to</font>

692
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,330
sum up there saying climate change

693
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't cause it it was one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

694
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">factors and climate change will you know</font>

695
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,070
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future likely exacerbate already</font>

696
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,470
existing you know social tensions

697
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,860
political tensions okay okay cool thank

698
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,030
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it that well I mean I just be</font>

699
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,280
having gone to Syria every summer since

700
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,510
I was a kid I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember how the Iraq war</font>

701
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,679
and the the influx of Iraqi refugees

702
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,539
into Syria as well as Palestinian

703
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,909
refugees insist area caused a lot of

704
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:04,640
inflation along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

705
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,419
corruption that caused that cause lent

706
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:10,700
or that called that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause real estate in</font>

707
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,710
Syria to become the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most expensive real</font>

708
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,260
estate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all things</font>

709
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really tied to corruption</font>

710
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,559
because the government could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have easily</font>

711
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,260
made economic reforms I mean it's also

712
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,200
tied to like the devaluing of the Syrian

713
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
lira which you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my grandfather's</font>

714
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,840
time was a one dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three lira</font>

715
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240
ratio and now it's a one dollar or prior

716
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the revolution it was a one dollar</font>

717
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,070
250 later ratio sure so um well I

718
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely agree with I believe in</font>

719
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,000
global warming and climate change

720
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,480
because I am a scientist um I think I

721
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not really sure how much</font>

722
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,780
climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change in itself excluding the</font>

723
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,960
fact that the Assad regime are ignoring

724
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,240
the fact that the Assad regime could

725
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,400
have made changes in the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

726
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,659
would have allowed the people to

727
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:02,630
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live properly you know be a</font>

728
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,120
real reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen yeah no I</font>

729
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I think I under under</font>

730
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,220
and what you're saying and I would agree

731
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think you know that if the Assad</font>

732
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,330
regime if the Syrian government had

733
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,870
policies in place to address the fact

734
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,360
that this drought was so severe and

735
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,549
displacing so many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

736
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">perhaps the perhaps I think what these</font>

737
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">researchers are saying is like perhaps</font>

738
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:30,720
the the uprising would have been less

739
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,780
severe not that it wouldn't happen not

740
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,770
that you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Civil War wouldn't</font>

741
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,870
wouldn't have have occurred but that

742
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,630
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the absence of a state</font>

743
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,909
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to deal with you know</font>

744
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:48,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like corruption on top of in</font>

745
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,250
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know problems associated</font>

746
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,080
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> climate change you know there's</font>

747
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,539
going to be more conflict so but but

748
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,940
thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your questions thank you</font>

749
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,299
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you yeah peso Robert we just got a</font>

750
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,340
tweet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was sending while we were</font>

751
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,110
alive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went I wanted to read this</font>

752
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,720
for you okay Amy the great sent us a

753
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,500
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that asking us I do scientists</font>

754
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,750
have an agreement really about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

755
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly chat climate change is happening</font>

756
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">so she's saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some of the errors</font>

757
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,690
and understanding climate change might

758
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,460
be because people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know how</font>

759
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly it's happening so is there any</font>

760
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of consensus on this i think you</font>

761
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:29,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there's been some criticism of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

UN it the UN's Intergovernmental Panel

766
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,870
consensus reports every five years was

767
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,610
every five years or so which being bring

768
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,260
together all of the the the current

scientific understanding of climate

770

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisory document for governments</font>

772
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,730
around the world one of the criticisms

773
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,380
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UN process has been that it's</font>

774
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,020
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of under estimating the</font>

775
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,090
severity of climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change as alarming</font>

776

on food production<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world</font>

781
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,140
they do see it does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does there's I</font>

782
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,780
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's you know robust scientific</font>

783
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,990
evidence that the world is warming

784
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,200
faster that extreme weather events are

785
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,690
occurring more frequently and much more

786
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,970
intensely than then a lot of scientists

787
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,910
have have previously predicted and so

788
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is there's a</font>

789
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,300
debate within the scientific community

790
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,420
about you know is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bias not as</font>

791
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,250
climate change deniers say towards

792
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,290
making things more alarmist but is there

793
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,980
a bias perhaps to be to tone down the

794
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,800
impacts of climate change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's an</font>

795
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,870
open question but I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font>

796
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,310
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scientific debate going on</font>

797
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,400
about that but i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know in my</font>

798
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,440
experience it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

799
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">been covering climate change for you</font>

800
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,210
know six or seven years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now i feel like</font>

801
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,668
the predictions are happening much more

802
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:17,668
quickly about the the pace and the scale

803
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:20,219
of changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earth's atmosphere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

804
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,840
oceans great<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer so we have our last</font>

805
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,250
guide color of the day let's say hey to

00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:46,739
at awesome so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for you coming</font>

813
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,480
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the people's climate March</font>

814
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,820
and flood wall street and even Ferguson

815
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,149
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this past year I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

816
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen a lot of grassroots</font>

817
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,580
organizations really starting to connect

818
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the struggles you know seeing where race</font>

819
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,200
and gender & labor intersect with

820
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,730
environmental and climate justice and

821
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,920
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a growing interplay</font>

822
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,860
between the these like grassroots groups

823
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,860
and the big traditional nonprofits and

824
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,100
big Green's including myself you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

825
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,720
resisting the Atlantic coast pipeline

826
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,870
down here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering how do you</font>

827
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,810
see this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing interplay between</font>

828
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,700
the the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> greens and the like</font>

829
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">grassroots direct action folks pushing</font>

830
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,279
for more effective results yeah you know

831
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:39,299
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the before I answer the</font>

832
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:41,130
the connection between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the big</font>

833
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,720
greens and the direct action groups I

834
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,690
think one of the more underreported

835
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,089
stories about the climate change

836
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:49,950
movement and climate change politics in

837
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,460
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is really you know how much and</font>

838
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,740
of a contribution small direct action

839
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,420
groups have had on stopping fossil fuel

840
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,430
production stopping the transportation

841
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,490
of fossil fuels particularly you know

842
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,000
exports there's been you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> small you</font>

843
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,180
know small groups of activists in say

844
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,220
the Pacific Northwest that have been

845
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,599
that have been doing great work around

846
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,490
you know blocking the construction of

847
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,250
coal export terminals there's been

848
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,519
activists in you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plain</font>

849
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,799
States you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know bringing a lot of</font>

850
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:36,029
attention to oil by rail shipments and

851
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:38,759
you know obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> Keystone XL has been</font>

852
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:41,940
a huge issue you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

853
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,859
environmental<font color="#E5E5E5"> movement and I think</font>

854
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,750
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of there's been a lot of</font>

855
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,819
activity you know with blockades in I

856
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:52,829
think Nebraska or Kansas I can't

857
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,240
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you know they're like</font>

858
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,029
yeah everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right so</font>

859
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:59,400
significant contributions from small

860
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,980
direct action organizations you know in

861
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,349
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the campaigning of the big</font>

862
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:07,230
green groups and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think kind of you</font>

863
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,359
know so to get get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your question more</font>

864
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,029
directly I think you're what you're kind

865
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,319
of inferring is that there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

866
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,599
antagonism between these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

867
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,279
historically there has been a bit of

868
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,500
antagonism between them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

869
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not their interests aren't necessarily</font>

870
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,599
shared on an organizational level<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

871
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,210
know they may be for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment for</font>

872
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,440
protecting the environment for

873
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,390
addressing climate change but you know

874
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,069
some of the big green groups are much

875
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:34,680
more focused on lobbying and trying to

876
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,369
pass legislation in DC where you know

877
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:41,400
the smaller direct action organizations

878
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,920
are much more trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just throw a</font>

879
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,319
monkey wrench into the way the file

880
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:49,829
so fuel industry works I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one way</font>

881
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:54,059
in one example of the way in which those

882
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:57,479
groups seem to be collaborating on with

883
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:59,099
maybe not collaborating but having a

884
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,559
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a cooperative political</font>

885
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,869
strategy is as you mentioned with the

886
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:06,660
the the people's climate March so

887
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,089
people's climate March happened 400,000

888
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:11,819
people you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the streets of New</font>

889
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:14,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">York City but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after there was a</font>

890
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,160
direct action on Wall Street and you

891
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,869
know talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know trying to trying</font>

892
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:21,719
to point out the connections between you

893
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,910
know the US financial industry Wall

894
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,329
Street and its funding of fossil fuel

895
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,160
production and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're seeing</font>

896
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,400
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and you're seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit bit of</font>

897
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,140
collaboration on these issues but i

898
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,019
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there's you know</font>

899
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:38,759
activists within the climate movement

900
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:40,680
will talk about sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of diversity of</font>

901
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,890
tactics sort of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> approaches for</font>

902
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,440
different folks and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know</font>

903
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a bit of you</font>

904
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">know everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you go and do</font>

905
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:53,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">your thing in DC you know we'll do our</font>

906
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,039
thing in you know the Pacific Northwest

907
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that those antagonism still</font>

908
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">exist because you know and there's open</font>

909
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:05,519
debates about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the to tie</font>

910
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:08,249
the problem of climate change directly

911
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:11,489
to the fossil fuel industry or to tie it

912
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:13,890
to politicians who aren't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> passing</font>

913
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,959
you know cap-and-trade legislation or

914
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,739
passing a carbon tax or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

915
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:21,660
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's that's that's a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

916
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,699
open debate about what's what's the the

917
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:27,150
proper target but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I don't know</font>

918
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">I hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't know if that</font>

919
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,349
answers your question but yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font>

920
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:33,989
think it definitely starts and well I'm

921
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:35,609
also interested like maybe how you think

922
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:37,709
these dynamics are playing out globally

923
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,160
or will<font color="#CCCCCC"> play out globally in 2015</font>

924
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,809
especially leading up to the UN

925
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:45,449
conference of parties in Paris later

926
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,369
this year you know maybe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that</font>

927
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:49,259
those big mobilizations that we've seen

928
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:52,049
with you know all the the legislative

929
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:55,109
and policy folks but then all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the just</font>

930
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,299
people just everyday people coming out

931
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:59,759
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know protesting or whatever it</font>

932
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font>

933
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah no I mean certainly there seems to</font>

934
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,670
be an importance to these big

935
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,330
spectacular marches but an interesting

936
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is like if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the history</font>

937
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:16,340
of say struggles around you know

938
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,280
hiv/aids you know the act up was a

939
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization that targeted you know the</font>

940
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,190
FDA very very you know a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>
