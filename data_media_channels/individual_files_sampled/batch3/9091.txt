THE CENTER OF A CONTROVERSY OVER PAY INCREASES AT THE EPA. Shannon: JOHN ROBERTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THANK YOU. NORMALLY IT'S THE FBI ON THE SIDE OF PROSECUTORS OFFERING DEALS TO POTENTIAL CRIMINAL WITNESSES. TONIGHT, THE FORMER NUMBER TWO MAN AT THE FBI IS SEEKING IMMUNITY FOR HIMSELF. ANDREW MCCABE WANTS A PROTECTION IN EXCHANGE FOR TELLING CONGRESS BUT HE KNOWS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS. ALSO, A NEW REPORT TAKING ISSUE WITH THE FORMER HEAD MAN AT THE BUREAU AND HOW HE DID HIS JOB. CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE HAS DETAILS ON THE DEVELOPMENT. THESE BETTER GENERALS REPORT PUTS DIRECTOR COMEY'S LEADERSHIP STYLE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL EXPLORING WHETHER COMEY WENT BEYOND HIS AUTHORITY'S IN JULY 2016 WHEN HE PUBLICLY DISCUSSED THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION AND RECOMMENDED AGAINST CRIMINAL CHARGES AND RESPONSIBILITY THAT FELT AS COST THE TIME, ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH. COMEY EXPLAINED THAT LYNCH'S ARIZONA TARMAC MEETING WITH THE CLINTON DAYS BEFORE HEATHER CLINTON'S FBI INTERVIEW FROM MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WAS A GAME-CHANGER. IN ADDITION TO OTHER INTELLIGENCE, AND APPLIED LYNCH WOULD NOT LET THE EMAIL INVESTIGATION GO TOO FAR. THAT INTELLIGENCE IS NOT PUBLIC AND ITS LIABILITY AND CLEAR. ON, FORMER DIRECTOR CHOSE HIS WORDS CAREFULLY ABOUT LYNCH. I THINK WE ARE BOTH TELLING THE TRUTH. I NEVER WENT TO HER AND SEND LORETTA COME I THINK YOU SHOULD RECUSE YOURSELF.

IT'S CALLED USE IMMUNITY AND IT MEANS THE CASE TESTIMONY CANNOT BE USED AGAINST HIM IN A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT McCABE LIED UNDER OATH AND MADE A CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY HERE IN D.C. FOR LYING TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS. SENIOR SENATOR REPUBLICAN ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED AGAINST A DEAL TO SECURE McCABE'S TESTIMONY. WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FBI DURING THE COMEY YEARS WHERE APPARENTLY THERE WAS MISCONDUCT GOING ON WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPUGNED THE REPUTATION OF THE FINEST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE WORLD. AND WE NEED TO CLEAR THE AIR. IMMUNITY WOULD BE A MISTAKE. MCCABE'S LAWYER SAID "McCABE IS WILLING TO TESTIFY BUT BECAUSE OF THE CRIMINAL REFERRAL HE MUST BE AFFORDED SUITABLE LEGAL PROTECTION, ADDING IF YOU WERE UNABLE TO GET SUCH DEAL, MUGABE COULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO INVOKE HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-DETERMINATION." TESTIMONY IS SCHEDULED FOR MONDAY BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WOULD THAT HAS THE LEAD ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT THAT
