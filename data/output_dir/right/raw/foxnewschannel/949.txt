STOPPED FOR A DOCUMENT OF

79
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:35,853
INCIDENT.

>> I KNOW THE REPUTATION OF ROB

81
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:37,288
ROSENSTEIN AND THAT IS ONE OF

82
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:37,855
IMPECCABLE CHARACTER.

83
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:38,589
AND I KNOW THE REPUTATION OF IT

84
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:39,323
DEVIN NUNES, AND THAT IS ONE OF

85
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:39,924
MISLEADING, OBSTRUCTING,

86
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:40,625
ATTEMPTING TO INTERVENE IN AN

87
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,058

INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SIGN THIS

91
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:43,594
LETTER TO ROB ROSENSTEIN

92
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:44,295
REJECTING ANOTHER BRIEFING BY

93
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:45,029
THE FBI SAYING, ANYTHING SHORT

94
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:45,930
OF PROVIDING THE RECORDS THAT

95
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,331
ARE UNDER SUBPOENA IN THEIR

96
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:50,334
OPENING AND IS AN OBSTRUCTION OF

97
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:50,668
JUSTICE.

98
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:52,203
TUCKER?

99
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:53,337
BREAKING THAT STORY IN THE FIRST

100
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:53,638
PLACE.

101
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:57,341
ROD ROSENSTEIN'S RECENT BEHAVIOR

102
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,577
IS NOT THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF THE

103
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:00,578
DOJ APPARENTLY VIEWING ITSELF AS

104
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:03,347
BEYOND BEYOND NORMAL OVERSIGHT.

105
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:04,649
MONTHS AGO, WE DISCOVERED THAT

106
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,884
FBI AGENTS PETER STRZOK AND

107
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:11,289
OTHER PAGE WERE USING THEIR

108
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:12,723
PERSONAL VIEWS INTRUDING ON

109
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:13,491
THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT DUTIES.

110
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,626
HOW FAR WILL THAT GO INTO WELLS

111
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:16,127
MAY BE INVOLVED?

112
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,528
THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW

113
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:20,131
THAT BUT WE DON'T BECAUSE THE

114
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:22,500
DOJ KEEPS TRYING TO CENSOR THE

115
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,901
TEXT MESSAGES BEFORE RELISTING

116
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:24,335
THEM.

117
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:25,503
HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE.

118
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:30,641
IN A SEPTEMBER 2015 TEXT, HE

119
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,375
MAINTAINS ABOUT THE HANDLING OF

120
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,444
A CASE BUT THE EXACT ROUTE

121
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:35,379
COMPLAINT WAS HER EXACT STOMACH

122
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:35,946
REJECTED.

123
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,548
THANKS TO WORK BY SENATOR RON

124
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:39,950
JOHNSON'S OFFICE, WE KNOW THAT

125
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,752
HE WANTED TO QUOTE BARGAIN AWAY

126
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:43,220
EVERYTHING AND THAT IT HAD A

127
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,194
QUOTE STOCKHOLM SYNDROME.

128
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,562
AND HOW THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY

129
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:55,132
COULD TO AVOID BRINGING CHARGES

130
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:57,134
AGAINST ANY OF CLINTON'S TEAM.

131
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,837
WHAT IS CLEAR, IS THAT NOTHING

132
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:01,739
HE SAID WAS A SECURITY THREAT

133
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:02,673
THAT WOULD REQUIRE A REDUCTION

134
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:05,343
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY.

135
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:07,578
THE DOJ WAS JUST TRYING TO COVER

136
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:08,579
ITSELF FROM KEEPING THE PUBLIC

137
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:09,780
FROM LEARNING THE TRUTH ABOUT

138
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,051
WHAT WAS GOING ON, IS NOT A

139
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:16,019
DEFENSE?

140
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,055
PROFESSOR, IT'S A VERY SIMPLE

141
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,023
QUESTION.

142
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:21,759
IS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

143
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,127
ALLOWED TO REDACT INFORMATION

144
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:24,962
SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF

145
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:26,097
PROTECTING ITS ON REPUTATION?

146
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,332
>> IT IS NOT, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS

147
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:30,601
A LONG HISTORY OF DOING SO, NOT

148
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,636
JUST IN CONGRESS BUT IN THE

149
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,139
WHAT'S REALLY FUNNY IS, THEY

150
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,240
WILL CHARGE SOMEONE WHO GIVES

151
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,376
THE MISLEADING INFORMATION, BUT

152
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:40,177
THEY WILL TELL CONGRESS THAT

153
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:42,546
THEY REJECTED CLASSIFIED

154
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:43,781
INFORMATION THAT PROVES ENTIRELY

155
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:44,215
UNCLASSIFIED.

156
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:47,918
THERE IS THIS SENSE OF ACTING

157
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,256
WITHOUT HER IMPUNITY, WHEN YOU

158
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:57,061
REDACT THESE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS.

159
00:04:57,061 --> 00:05:03,200
AND THAT MATERIAL IS CLASSIFIED

160
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,304
UNDER ANY DEFINITION.

161
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:08,739
THEY CAN DISAGREE WITH CHAIRMAN

162
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:10,408
NUNEZ, THEY CAN DISAGREE WITH

163
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:11,208
THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THEY SHOULD

164
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:15,780
ALL AGREE ON THE FACT THAT THIS

165
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,381
IS AN IMPROPER USE OF REDUCTION.

166
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,749
>> Tucker: AND IT'S BEEN GOING

167
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:20,418
ON YOU SET FOR QUITE SOME TIME,

168
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:21,819
SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE

169
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:25,122
STATUS QUO, NOT A NEW WAY OF

170
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:25,589
DOING BUSINESS?

171
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:27,992
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT IS.

172
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:29,927
I'VE BEEN COUNSELING SECURITY

173
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,163
CASES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT,

174
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:33,764
AND I HAVE REDACTED TO THE

175
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:36,500
COURTS THAT IT'S CLEARLY NOT

176
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:46,677
CLASSIFIED.

177
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:49,213
CLASSIFIED.

178
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:58,823
AND, NOBODY DISPUTES THAT ROB

179
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:00,558
ROSENSTEIN WENT OVER TO THE

180
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:03,327
CONGRESS AND THREATENED TO

181
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:04,795
SUBPOENA THE PERSONAL

182
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:05,563
COMMUNICATIONS OF MEMBERS THERE.

183
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:07,164
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

184
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:09,433
THAT AND WHAT IS ASKED SUGGEST

185
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:10,534
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

186
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:13,103
THE DOJ AND THE OVERSIGHT

187
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:18,142
COMMITTEE?

188
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:20,444
THESE COMMITTEES HAVE NOT HAD A

189
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:21,512
ROBUST OVERSIGHT RECORD.

190
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:23,147
THEY OFTEN ROLL OVER.

191
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:24,748
THIS IS SOMETHING NEW, AND

192
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:26,917
FRANKLY, THOSE OF US WHO WANTED

193
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,419
MORE OVERSIGHT HAVE WELCOMED THE

194
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,119
LAST YEAR.

195
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,054
FINALLY YOU HAVE A COMMITTEE

196
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:41,031
SAYING, WAIT.

197
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,099
AND THREATENING WEATHER IT'S

198
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:44,735
CRIMINAL OR CIVIL, STAFFERS OR

199
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,370
MEMBERS, IT'S CLEARLY

200
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,904
INAPPROPRIATE.

201
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:47,972
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT ROSENSTEIN

202
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,740
MAY HAVE FELT HE WAS BEING

203
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,242
MISTREATED, BUT THAT DOESN'T

204
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:51,775
MATTER.

205
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:54,345
YOU HAVE TO GET OVER IT.

206
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:55,079
CONGRESS CREATED THE DEPARTMENT

207
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,982
OF JUSTICE, THIS ISN'T PERSONAL.

208
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:58,782
IT IS OVERSIGHT BUSINESS.

209
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:00,784
SO NO MATTER HOW AGGRIEVED YOU

210
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:03,821
MAY BE, YOU CANNOT SPEAK TO AN

211
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:05,422
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND THREATEN

212
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:08,125
THOSE STAFFERS WITH TAKING

213
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,594
SOMETHING LIKE SUBPOENAS TO

214
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:11,061
THEIR DOORSTEP.

215
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,597
>> Tucker: CONGRESS DOES HAVE

216
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:15,699
OVERSIGHT OVER THE EXECUTIVE

217
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:16,300
AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE

218
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,067
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, CORRECT?

219
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,202
I MEAN, YOU WATCH THE OTHER

220
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,503
CHANNELS AND WOULD THINK THAT

221
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:21,205
WAS SOMETHING THAT THE

222
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:23,440
RIGHT-WINGERS MADE UP LAST WEEK.

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,175
BUT THAT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL

224
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,011
PRINCIPLE, AM I RIGHT?

225
00:07:27,011 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND
