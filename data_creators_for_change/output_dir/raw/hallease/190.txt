bucket list goal of becoming an engineer

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,310
engineering class at the local community

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">college first and then you know finish</font>

25

27
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely so I have actually been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

38
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,329

39
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,450

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you're just always winging life</font>

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,790
well you're just you try to plan but

61
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,500
you're just you're just winging it and

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,690
