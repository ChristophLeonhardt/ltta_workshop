00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:33,654
SIDING WITH NAZIS. SO THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

73
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:34,956
SO THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THE WHITE HOUSE IS COMPLETELY

74
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:36,157
THE WHITE HOUSE IS COMPLETELY FREAKED OUT BY ANONYMOUS.

75
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:38,026
FREAKED OUT BY ANONYMOUS. THEY SEEM WAY MORE CONCERNED

76
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,762
THEY SEEM WAY MORE CONCERNED THAN THE WOODWARD BOOK, WHICH IS

77
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:43,965
THAN THE WOODWARD BOOK, WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE THEY BOTH TELL THE

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,732
WEIRD BECAUSE THEY BOTH TELL THE SAME TALE.

79
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,836
SAME TALE. BUT COMMUNICATIONS-WISE, THEY

80
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,037
BUT COMMUNICATIONS-WISE, THEY DON’T HAVE A SINGLE SURROGATE

81
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,472
DON’T HAVE A SINGLE SURROGATE WHO ISN’T SEEN AS A

LAUGHINGSTOCK OUTSIDE OF THAT 32% BASE.

84
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:56,844
32% BASE. I MEAN BILL SHINE BASICALLY RUNS

85
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:58,446
I MEAN BILL SHINE BASICALLY RUNS AROUND AS BILL HANNITY’S

86
00:02:58,448 --> 00:02:58,780
AROUND AS BILL HANNITY’S PRODUCER.

87
00:02:58,814 --> 00:02:59,614
PRODUCER. HE DOESN’T REALLY OFFER

88
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:00,381
HE DOESN’T REALLY OFFER ANYTHING.

89
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:02,784
ANYTHING. SO I THINK THE CRACK IN THE WALL

90
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:03,885
SO I THINK THE CRACK IN THE WALL AND THE REASON THEY ARE FREAKED

91
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:04,986
AND THE REASON THEY ARE FREAKED OUT ABOUT THE ANONYMOUS, I THINK

92
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:05,987
OUT ABOUT THE ANONYMOUS, I THINK THE CRACK IN THE WALL OF THE

93
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:07,388
THE CRACK IN THE WALL OF THE BASE MAY BE IF SOME OF THEM

94
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,625
BASE MAY BE IF SOME OF THEM START TO BELIEVE HE IS ACTUALLY

95
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:09,991
START TO BELIEVE HE IS ACTUALLY SENILE.

96
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:12,994
SENILE. TRUMP CAN BE AS RACIST AS HE

97
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,430
TRUMP CAN BE AS RACIST AS HE WANTS, HE CAN BE AS MISINFORMED.

98
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:16,998
WANTS, HE CAN BE AS MISINFORMED. I THINK SOME OF THEM THINK HE IS

99
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:19,300
I THINK SOME OF THEM THINK HE IS NOT ALL THERE MENTALLY, THEN

100
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:20,702
NOT ALL THERE MENTALLY, THEN THEY START TO CRUMBLE AND THAT

101
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,671
THEY START TO CRUMBLE AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY HE GETS TO 36%

102
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,072
IS THE ONLY WAY HE GETS TO 36% IF HE STARTS TO LOSE SOME OF

103
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:24,706
IF HE STARTS TO LOSE SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE.

104
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:27,108
THOSE PEOPLE. >> AND THAT IS THE THING, THE

105
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,710
>> AND THAT IS THE THING, THE REASON THAT STATE RUN -- REAL

106
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:30,745
REASON THAT STATE RUN -- REAL STATE RUN MEDIA WORKS IS THAT

107
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,481
STATE RUN MEDIA WORKS IS THAT THERE IS NO ALTERNATE SOURCES OF

00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,063
IT IS BOOF THE LAW. AND IF SOMETHING MAKES IT FEEL

164
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:29,599
AND IF SOMETHING MAKES IT FEEL LIKE THERE ARE OTHER CONCERNS

165
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
LIKE THERE ARE OTHER CONCERNS THAT ARE NOT TECHNICALLY

166
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,101
THAT ARE NOT TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL, THEN THAT IS ACTUALLY

167
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,236
ILLEGAL, THEN THAT IS ACTUALLY BENEFICIAL TO TRUMP AND HIS

168
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,570
BENEFICIAL TO TRUMP AND HIS BACKERS.

169
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:35,838
BACKERS. >> AND I WONDER IF THERE IS A

170
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,539
>> AND I WONDER IF THERE IS A SENSE WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE

171
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
SENSE WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT NOTHING CAN HURT HIM, EVEN

172
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:38,541
THAT NOTHING CAN HURT HIM, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS REPORTING

173
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,842
THOUGH THERE IS REPORTING BUSINESS INSIDERS SAYING THE

174
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:41,644
BUSINESS INSIDERS SAYING THE DUMB SOUTHERNER THING MAY BE

175
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,180
DUMB SOUTHERNER THING MAY BE HURTING TRUMP IN ALABAMA, WHO

176
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:44,513
HURTING TRUMP IN ALABAMA, WHO KNOWS.

177
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,149
KNOWS. BUT TO HER POINT, IF THE REAL

178
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,952
BUT TO HER POINT, IF THE REAL DANGER IS BIGGER AND MORE

179
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:49,920
DANGER IS BIGGER AND MORE EXISTENTIAL, YOU ALSO HAVE

180
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,521
EXISTENTIAL, YOU ALSO HAVE REPORTING THAT THE THINGS WE’RE

181
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:53,056
REPORTING THAT THE THINGS WE’RE HEARING OUT OF THE WOODWARD BOOK

182
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,991
HEARING OUT OF THE WOODWARD BOOK COULD HURT THE RELATIONSHIP

183
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,359
COULD HURT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRUMP AND JIM MATTIS.

184
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,328
BETWEEN TRUMP AND JIM MATTIS. IF THERE IS ONE PERSON IN THE

185
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,462
IF THERE IS ONE PERSON IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT GENUINELY

186
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:03,066
ADMINISTRATION THAT GENUINELY DESERVES TO BE MAYBE FITTED FOR

187
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:08,371
DESERVES TO BE MAYBE FITTED FOR A SUPER DLTDMAN CAPE, IT HIM.

188
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:09,072
A SUPER DLTDMAN CAPE, IT HIM. AND THEN YOU WOULD SEE TRUMP

189
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:09,973
AND THEN YOU WOULD SEE TRUMP DOING MORE AND MORE THAT WOULD

190
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:10,841
DOING MORE AND MORE THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY DANGEROUS.

191
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,743
BE ACTUALLY DANGEROUS. >> YEAH, I REPORTED LAST WEEK

192
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,846
>> YEAH, I REPORTED LAST WEEK THE WOODWARD BOOK AXLECCELERATED

193
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:20,383
THE WOODWARD BOOK AXLECCELERATED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT JIM MADE

194
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:21,584
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT JIM MADE THE TIS AND

195
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:22,686
THE TIS AND THE -- MATTIS AND JOHN KELLY

196
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:22,986
THE -- MATTIS AND JOHN KELLY LEAVING.

197
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,421
LEAVING. AND THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW

198
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:27,490
AND THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW BREAKS ON THIS PRESIDENT.

199
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,926
BREAKS ON THIS PRESIDENT. SO SORT OF THE MORE SUNLIGHT WE

200
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:30,961
SO SORT OF THE MORE SUNLIGHT WE SHINE INSIDE THIS WHITE HOUSE,

201
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:34,464
SHINE INSIDE THIS WHITE HOUSE, THE DANGER THE CRAZIER IT MAKES

202
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:35,365
THE DANGER THE CRAZIER IT MAKES THIS PRESIDENT.

203
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:38,702
THIS PRESIDENT. >> DOES IT ACTUALLY MATTER WHO

204
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:42,072
>> DOES IT ACTUALLY MATTER WHO THE WRITERER EROF THAT OP-ED IS?

205
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:44,408
THE WRITERER EROF THAT OP-ED IS? >> THE KEY THING IS THAT THEY

206
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,509
>> THE KEY THING IS THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING BY ALL ACCOUNTS

207
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,276
ARE PROVIDING BY ALL ACCOUNTS ACCURATE INFORMATION.

208
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:47,711
ACCURATE INFORMATION. WE COULD HAVE A WHOLE DEBATE ON

209
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:49,346
WE COULD HAVE A WHOLE DEBATE ON WHETHER THIS PERSON IS A COWARD

210
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,714
WHETHER THIS PERSON IS A COWARD FOR NOT COMING FORWARD AND

211
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,916
FOR NOT COMING FORWARD AND RESIGNING AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

212
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,418
RESIGNING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT HOPEFULLY THE PRESS DOESN’T

213
00:06:54,452 --> 00:06:55,653
BUT HOPEFULLY THE PRESS DOESN’T GET TOO OBSESSED WITH THIS GARM

214
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:56,987
GET TOO OBSESSED WITH THIS GARM OF LET’S FIND OUT WHO IT IS.

215
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:58,021
OF LET’S FIND OUT WHO IT IS. IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER.

216
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:59,789
IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WE HAVE A

217
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,824
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WE HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL DEEPLY

218
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:01,625
DYSFUNCTIONAL DEEPLY DYSFUNCTIONAL WHITE HOUSE.

219
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:03,694
DYSFUNCTIONAL WHITE HOUSE. WE HAVE PEOPLE STEALING PAPERS

220
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:06,997
WE HAVE PEOPLE STEALING PAPERS OFF TRUMP’S DESK SO HE DOESN’T

221
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:07,631
OFF TRUMP’S DESK SO HE DOESN’T HARM THE COUNTRY.

222
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,666
HARM THE COUNTRY. AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO WHAT

223
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:12,002
AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO WHAT SEAN HANNITY IS SAYING, SECRET

224
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,103
SEAN HANNITY IS SAYING, SECRET SERVICE SHOULD INVESTIGATE,

225
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:13,437
SERVICE SHOULD INVESTIGATE, RIGHT?

226
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,139
RIGHT? TRUMP WANTS THE DEPARTMENT OF

227
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,773
TRUMP WANTS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE.

228
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:17,040
JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE. THIS HAS HIT A NERVE FOR

229
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:17,941
THIS HAS HIT A NERVE FOR WHATEVER REASON.

230
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:20,577
WHATEVER REASON. AND AGAIN, I FEEL LIKE THIS

231
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:22,713
AND AGAIN, I FEEL LIKE THIS MESSAGE, THIS NARRATIVE THAT

232
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:24,114
MESSAGE, THIS NARRATIVE THAT TRUMP MIGHT BE NOT FUNCTIONING

233
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:25,816
TRUMP MIGHT BE NOT FUNCTIONING OR IS SENILE, I THINK THEY THINK

234
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:28,352
OR IS SENILE, I THINK THEY THINK THAT IS THE THING THAT COULD

235
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:31,322
THAT IS THE THING THAT COULD REALLY HURT THEM.

236
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,823
REALLY HURT THEM. >> AND I THINK -- THE TEAM AND I

237
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:34,858
>> AND I THINK -- THE TEAM AND I HAD THIS DEBATE.

238
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:36,693
HAD THIS DEBATE. IF DONALD TRUMP IS GOING IN AN

239
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:37,628
IF DONALD TRUMP IS GOING IN AN INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN

240
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,830
INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN DIRECTION, IF HE IS INCREASINGLY

241
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,231
DIRECTION, IF HE IS INCREASINGLY DESPERATE, IF HE IS EMBARKING ON

00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,933
DESPERATE, IF HE IS EMBARKING ON A WITCH HUNT TO FIND THIS

243
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:43,834
A WITCH HUNT TO FIND THIS ANONYMOUS PERSON AND THE PRESS

244
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:46,670
ANONYMOUS PERSON AND THE PRESS IS PLAYING THE POWER GAME WITH

IS PLAYING THE POWER GAME WITH HIM, FIGURING OUT WHO IT IS, I

246
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,374
HIM, FIGURING OUT WHO IT IS, I WONDER IF THEN THAT BECOMES A

247
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,942
WONDER IF THEN THAT BECOMES A DANGEROUS PURSUIT IN AND OF

248
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:54,144
DANGEROUS PURSUIT IN AND OF ITSELF BECAUSE IT FEEDS HIM

249
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,146
ITSELF BECAUSE IT FEEDS HIM CONTINUING TO TRY TO HUNT FOR

250
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:57,548
CONTINUING TO TRY TO HUNT FOR THIS PERSON IN WAYS THAT ARE

251
00:07:57,549 --> 00:07:58,582
THIS PERSON IN WAYS THAT ARE DESTABILIZING AND AUTHORITARIAN.

252
00:07:58,617 --> 00:07:59,216
DESTABILIZING AND AUTHORITARIAN. >> ABSOLUTELY.

253
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:01,352
>> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT IS WHAT THIS OP-ED

254
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:01,986
I THINK THAT IS WHAT THIS OP-ED WILL ACCOMPLISH WHETHER

255
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:02,787
WILL ACCOMPLISH WHETHER INTENTIONALLY OR NOT.

256
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,089
INTENTIONALLY OR NOT. IT IS A PRETEXT TO A PURGE.

257
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,724
IT IS A PRETEXT TO A PURGE. A PURGE OF INTERNAL STAFFERS WHO

258
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:07,758
A PURGE OF INTERNAL STAFFERS WHO MAYBE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN

259
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,193
MAYBE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN THERE DOING A GOOD JOB THAT HE

260
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:10,494
THERE DOING A GOOD JOB THAT HE MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT TO GET RID

261
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,462
MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT TO GET RID OF THAT ARE NOT THE PEOPLE WHO

262
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:12,697
OF THAT ARE NOT THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE OP-ED.

263
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:14,298
WROTE THE OP-ED. AND ALSO AN ATTACK ON THE MEDIA.

264
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,167
AND ALSO AN ATTACK ON THE MEDIA. IT VALIDATES HIS CONSPIRACY

265
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:18,769
IT VALIDATES HIS CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT THE DEEP STATE.

266
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,403
THEORIES ABOUT THE DEEP STATE. AND I THINK IT WAS REALLY

267
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:20,271
AND I THINK IT WAS REALLY IRRESPONSIBLE OF THE "NEW YORK

268
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,071
IRRESPONSIBLE OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES" TO PRINT IT.

269
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:24,275
TIMES" TO PRINT IT. IT VALIDATES -- DOESN’T VALIDATE

270
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,511
IT VALIDATES -- DOESN’T VALIDATE HIS ATTACKS ON THE MEDIA, BUT

271
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,613
HIS ATTACKS ON THE MEDIA, BUT CERTAINLY GIVES FODDER FOR THOSE

272
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:32,750
CERTAINLY GIVES FODDER FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT A FREE PRESS.

273
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:34,217
WHO DO NOT WANT A FREE PRESS. HE DOES NOT WANT INVESTIGATIVE

274
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:35,653
HE DOES NOT WANT INVESTIGATIVE INQUIRIES INTO HIS CRIMES.

275
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,821
INQUIRIES INTO HIS CRIMES. HE DOES NOT WANT PEOPLE TO BE

276
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:39,624
HE DOES NOT WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK FREELY AND

277
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,859
ABLE TO SPEAK FREELY AND CRITICIZE HIM.

278
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:42,026
CRITICIZE HIM. AND IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR

279
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:42,994
AND IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR DEMOCRACY THAT WE DO.

280
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:45,930
DEMOCRACY THAT WE DO. AND SO YES, THIS OP-ED IS

281
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:47,298
AND SO YES, THIS OP-ED IS IRRESPONSIBLE, IT IS DANGEROUS,

282
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,200
IRRESPONSIBLE, IT IS DANGEROUS, STUPID AS A PIECE UNTO ITSELF

283
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:50,334
STUPID AS A PIECE UNTO ITSELF AND IT COULD CAUSE A LOT OF

284
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,003
AND IT COULD CAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE IN THE WEEKS TO COME.

285
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:54,706
DAMAGE IN THE WEEKS TO COME. >> NEVER FORGET -- THE BOOK IS

286
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:56,140
>> NEVER FORGET -- THE BOOK IS CALLED "FEAR" BECAUSE OF A QUOTE

287
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,141
CALLED "FEAR" BECAUSE OF A QUOTE FROM TRUMP THAT THAT IS WHAT

288
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,910
FROM TRUMP THAT THAT IS WHAT LEADERSHIP IS, LEADERSHIP IS

289
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:00,611
LEADERSHIP IS, LEADERSHIP IS FEAR.

290
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:01,613
FEAR. INVOKING FEAR IN PEOPLE, THAT IS

291
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:03,214
INVOKING FEAR IN PEOPLE, THAT IS WHAT HE THINKS IS LEADERSHIP.

292
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,048
WHAT HE THINKS IS LEADERSHIP. >> ALL RIGHT.

293
00:09:04,049 --> 00:00:00,000
>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
