4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,500
here in Zambia Africa that's right

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,429
Zambia Africa I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even believe it</font>

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,760
myself and this video is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first of a</font>

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,070
series of videos that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling</font>

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,279
the Jubilee project days in Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,630
those of you who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where Zambia</font>

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,480
is don't worry even up to about a month

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,099
ago I had no idea where Zambia was

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,989
either but it's in southern central

13
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:35,100
getting here was kind of a crazy journey

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,579
in and of itself it took almost 24 hours

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,290
there's about a 15 hour flight from New

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,480
York<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Johannesburg I spent a couple</font>

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours there and another three or</font>

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,289
four-hour flight from Johannesburg to

19
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lusaka which is where I am now so a lot</font>

20
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,780
of you are probably wondering Jason what

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,390
are you doing in Africa and that's a

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,449
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so for the Jubilee project</font>

23
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,840
we often talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving back about</font>

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,850
being a part of the community by making

25
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,570
an impact about taking action<font color="#E5E5E5"> and quite</font>

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,840
frankly talk is cheap it's easy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,790
to talk about trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage folks</font>

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,869
to make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference but we wanted to</font>

29
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,250
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a difference ourselves we wanted to</font>

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,840
take action to

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,969
and for me I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> an amazing opportunity</font>

32
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,310
arise where I could take up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for months</font>

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">off of work and actually moved here to</font>

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,119
Zambia to do HIV and AIDS financing work

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,530
while I travel throughout the country

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,200
and worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same Ian go I think</font>

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I've always been really really</font>

38
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:40,770
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> global poverty and global</font>

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,649
health so when this opportunity came up

40
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,890
i was thrilled and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i knew that this is</font>

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to do but hopefully</font>

42
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,409
even this series of videos is an

43
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">inspiration to folks out there to get</font>

44
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,030
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really take action and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

45
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,770
know taking action doesn't always have

46
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,750
to involve going to a foreign<font color="#CCCCCC"> country</font>

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,880
you can go anywhere whether it be the

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">inner city to your local</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> library to your</font>

49
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,060
school to help just people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,239
in your community and friends I think

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,500
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those things aren't taking</font>

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,780
action I'm really really excited to be

53
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,150
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the ground and I'm excited to</font>

54
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,540
learn a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about HIV</font>

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,099
and also about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to treat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it better</font>
