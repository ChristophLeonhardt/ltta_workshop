>> CHECK IN LATER TODAY.
>> Sandra: WE'LL CHECK IN WITH
YOU SOON.
>> Bill: IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN
THREE YEARS SINCE TWO BROTHERS
CARRIED OUT DEADLY ATTACKS ON
THE OFFICES OF THE FRENCH
SATIRICAL NEWSPAPER "CHARLIE
HEBDO".
THIS IS A SCENE FROM THAT DAY.
STUNNING STUFF.
12 PEOPLE KILLED INSIDE, 11
OTHERS INJURED.
THE ATTACKERS MANAGED TO GET
OUT OF THE OFFICE AND CONTINUED
FIRING SHOTS IN THE STREETS
OUTSIDE OF PARIS AND NOW THE
MAN SAID TO HAVE HELPED
RADICALIZE THE BROTHERS IS
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HIS PAST TO
DERADICALIZATION AND HOW HE IS
HOPING TO HELP OTHERS DO THE
SAME.
INTERESTING TWIST.
AMY KELLOGG HAS THE STORY LIVE
WITH US NOW.
WHAT DID YOU LEARN?
>> IT IS RARE TO GET INSIGHT
INTO THE MINDSET OF A JIHADIST
AND EXTREMELY RARE TO HEAR ONE
REPENT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL DOUBT THE
SINCERITY.
OTHERS SAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE
LIVED AND BEEN DISILLUSIONED
ARE THE MOST RESPECTIVE TOOLS
TO DEBUNK THE ISIS PROPAGANDA
DESPITE THE FALL OF ISIS
TERRITORY IS AS OUT THERE AS
EVER.
A FRENCHMAN OF ALGERIAN DESCENT
HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE
DERADLY INDICATION EXPERTS TO
GET FRENCH EXTREMISTS OFF THEIR

HE WAS A LOST SOUL AND IT LED
TO A CAREER AS A PREACHER AND
RECRUITER OF YOUNG FRENCHMEN TO
GO TOIR ACT TO FIGHT.
THE BROTHERS WHO MURDERED 12
PEOPLE AROUND THE OFFICES OF
"CHARLIE HEBDO" IN PARIS WERE
HIS DISCIPLES UNTIL 2005.
HE WAS CLOSE TO ONE BROTHER,
SHARIF.
THEY WERE ARRESTED FOR THEIR
ACTIVITIES.
THEY DIDN'T DO MUCH JAIL TIME.
ODDLY IN JAIL THEY MANAGED TO
DERADICALIZED WHILE ONE MORE
HARDENED.
HE FEELS A SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY.
>> IT IS I WHO GAVE HIM THE
IDEOLOGY AND ENCOURAGED HIM AT
A TIME TO GO TO IRAQ.
WHEN HE HAD DOUBTS, I HELPED
DISPEL THEM.
I PARTICIPATED IN SOME WAY.
>> IT'S INTERESTING HE SAYS THE
FACT THAT HE WAS NOT HANGING
OUT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN PRISON
HELPED HIM DERADICAL EYES AND
LONG-TIME JEWISH NEIGHBORS
EMBRACED HIM WHEN HE WAS
RELEASED FROM JAIL KNOWING WHAT
HE WENT TO JAIL FOR HELPED HIM
UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A WAY OUT
OF ALL THIS.
PERHAPS THAT'S A LESSON TO THE
PRISON SYSTEMS.
THE BOTTOM LINE NOW THERE ARE
19,000 PEOPLE SAID TO BE
