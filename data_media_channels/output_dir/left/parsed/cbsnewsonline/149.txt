HAS TO SAY. 
>> I DIDN'T MIND GIVING YOU A 
SECOND HELLO, NOT AT 
ALL. 
WE'VE NONEACH OTHER A LONG 
TIME. 
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS A LOCK TIME, 
FROM THE BEGINNING 
OF THE CAMPAIGN. 
THESE ARE SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
PLEASE SIT DOWN. 
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, THANK YOU 
SO MUCH FOR JOINING 
US, MIKE. 
I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE ACTING 
DIRECTOR HOMEN, 
WHO'S LEAVING US. 
HE'S BEEN TRULY A STAR, AND 
HE'S LEAVING, HE'S 
RETIRING. 
BUT WHERE IS TOM? 
IS HE AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE? 
TOM, STAND UP, TOM. 
TOM HAS BEEN DOING WHAT HE'S 
DOING FOR 4 YEARS, AND 
DOING IT WITH STRENGTH AND 
DEDICATION, AND YOU ARE 
REALLY OUTSTANDING, AND YOU'RE 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
REPLACEMENT IS GOING TO DO A 
GREAT JOB. 
WE KNOW HIM WELL. 
HE'S GOING TO DO REALLY GREAT. 
THANK YOU, TOM, FOR THOSE YEARS 
OF SERVICE. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE 
INCREDIBLE ICE OFFICERS, 
BORDER AGENTS AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO JOIN 
US HERE TODAY. 
IF YOU COULD STAND UP, PLEASE, 
THESE PEOPLE ARE ALSO 
SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
AND THEY'RE GOOD-LOOKING 
PEOPLE, AREN'T THEY? 
GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING 
HERE, AND FOR THE 
BRAVERY OF WHAT YOU DO, WHAT 
YOU ENDURE IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
I ALSO WANT TO STAND AND HAVE 
THE BRAVE MEN AND 
WOMEN FROM ALL OVER GOVERNMENT 
AGENCIES, WE HAVE A 
LOT, JUST -- MAYBE JUST RAISE 
YOUR HAND OR STAND, 
BUT WE APPRECIATE THE JOB 
YOU'VE DONE, ESPECIALLY 
DURING THE LAST YEAR AND A 
HALF, BECAUSE I KNOW 
YOU'VE PUT IN A LOT OF EXTRA. 
SO PLEASE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
WE'RE GATHERED HERE TO HEAR 
FROM THE VICTIMS OF AS 
LONG AS. 
WE HEAR THE SIDE. 
WE HEAR THE OTHER SIDE. 
THESE ARE CITIZENS PERMANENTLY 
SEPARATED FROM THEIR 
LOVED ONES. 
THE WORD "PERMANENTLY" BEING 
THE WORD YOU HAVE TO 
THINK ABOUT. 
PERMANENTLY. 
THEY'RE NOT SEPARATED FOR A DAY 
OR TWO DAYS. 
PERMANENTLY SEPARATED, BECAUSE 
THEY WERE KILLED BY 
CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS. 
THESE ARE THE FAMILIES THE 
MEDIA IGNORES. 
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM. 
VERY UNFAIR. 
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERYBODY. 
BUT THIS IS A VERY UNFAIR 
SITUATION. 
AND I KNEW THAT YEARS AGO WHEN 
WE WOULD BE TOGETHER 
OUT CAMPAIGNING. 
AND I SAID, "IF THIS EVER 
HAPPENS, WE'RE NEVER 
FORGETTING YOU. 
YOU KNOW THAT, LAURA, 
EVERYBODY. 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
AND THEY'RE DEDICATED. 
THESE ARE THE STORIES THAT 
DEMOCRATS AND PEOPLE THAT 
ARE WEAK ON IMMIGRATION, THEY 
DON'T WAT TO DISCUSS, 
THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR, THEY 
DON'T WANT TO SEE, 
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT. 
NO MAJOR NETWORKS SEND CAMERAS 
TO THEIR HOMES OR 
DISPLAY THE IMAGES OF THEIR 
INCREDIBLE LOVED ONES 
ACROSS THE NIGHTLY NEWS. 
THEY DON'T DO THAT. 
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE KATIE 
AND DESTRUCTION 
CAUSED BY PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T 
BE HERE, PEOPLE THAT 
WILL CONTINUOUSLY GET INTO 
TROUBLE AND DO BAD 
THINGS. 
FOR YEARS, THEIR PAIN WAS MET 
WITH SILENCE, THEIR 
PLIGHT WAS MET WITH 
INDIFFERENCE, BUT NO MORE. 
I TOLD THEM THREE YEARS AGO 
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER, 
DAY ONE, JUST ABOUT DAY ONE, I 
WOULD SAY, I SAID UP 
I HEAR YOU. 
I SEE YOU, AND I WILL NEVER LET 
YOU DOWN." 
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING 
TOGETHER, AND THEIR LOVED 
ONES HAVE NOT DIED IN VAIN. 
WE ALL KNOW THAT. 
WE CALL THESE BRAVE AMERICANS 
THE ANGEL FAMILIES, 
ANGEL MOMS, ANGEL POPS. 
THESE ARE THE ANGEL FAMILIES. 
YOUR LOSS WILL IN THE HAVE BEEN 
IN VAIN. 
WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS, AND 
WE WILL MAKE SURE 
THAT THEY'RE PROPERLY TAKEN 
CARE OF. 
EVENTUALLY, THE WORD WILL GET 
OUT. 
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A SAFE 
COUNTRY. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SAFE 
COUNTRY, AND YOUR LOVED 
ONES ARE GOING TO BE PLAYING 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
PLAY A BIG PART IN IT. 
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
SO HERE ARE JUST A FEW 
STATISTICS ON THE HUMAN TOLL 
OF AS LONG AS. 
ACCORDING TO A 2011 GOVERNMENT 
REPORT, THE ARRESTS 
ATTACHED TO THE CRIMINAL ALIEN 
POPULATION INCLUDED 
AN ESTIMATED 25,000 PEOPLE FOR 
HOMICIDE, 42,000 FOR 
ROBBERY, NEARLY 70,000 FOR SEX 
OFFENSES, AND NEARLY 
15,000 FOR KIDNAPPING. 
IN TEXAS ALONE, WITHIN THE LAST 
SEVEN YEARS, MORE 
THAN A QUARTER MILLION CRIMINAL 
ALIENS HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH OVER 
600,000 CRIMINAL 
FINANCES. 
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT. 
I ALWAYS HEAR THAT, "OH, NO, 
THE POPULATION IS SAFER 
THAN THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN 
THE COUNTRY." 
YOU'VE HEARD THAT, FELLAS, 
RIGHT? 
YOU HEAR THAT MUCH. 
IS THAT POSSIBLE? 
IT'S NOT TRUE. 
YOU HEAR THEY'RE BETTER PEOPLE 
THAN WHAT WE HAVE, 
THAN OUR CITIZENS. 
IT'S NOT TRUE. 
IN 2016, MORE THAN 15 AMERICANS 
DIED FROM A HEROIN 
OVERDOSE. 
MORE THAN 90% OF THE HEROIN 
COMES ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER. 
FINALITY PERCENT. 
AS THE RESULT OF SANCTUARY CITY 
POLICIES IN FISCAL 
2017, MORE THAN 8,000 CRIMINAL 
ALIENS -- THESE ARE 
REALLY HARD-CORE CRIMINAL 
ALIENS -- WERE IN POLICE 
CUSTODY, AND WERE RELEASED 
BECAUSE OF OUR WEAK LAWS, 
WEAKEST IN THE WORLD, WEAKEST 
IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD. 
THEY WERE RELEASED BACK INTO 
OUR CIVILIAN 
POPULATION. 
AND THESE GENTLEMEN HAD TO DO 
SOME OF THE RELEASING, 
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WERE TOO 
HAPPY, BECAUSE YOU 
KNEW WHAT YOU WERE RELEASING. 
YOU KNEW IT WAS TROUBLE, AND IT 
OFTEN COMES BECOME 
TO BE TROUBLE. 
WHERE IS THE MEDIA OUTRAGE OVER 
THE CATCH AND 
RELEASE POLICIES THAT ALLOW 
DEADLY DRUGS TO POUR 
INTO OUR COUNTRY? 
WHERE IS THE CONDEMNATION OF 
THE DEMOCRATS SANCTUARY 
CITIES THAT RELEASE VIOLENT 
CRIMINALS INTO OUR 
COMMUNITIES, AND THEN PROTECT 
THEM LIKE THE MAYOR OF 
SAN DIEGO WHEN SHE WARNED 
EVERYBODY THAT ICE IS 
COMING, AND THEY SCATTERED. 
A BIG OPERATION, VERY EXPENSIVE 
OPERATION. 
THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER. 
THEY ALL SCATTERED. 
AND WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO 
ABOUT LOOKING AT HER, 
BY THE WAY? 
I'VE BEEN ASKING THIS QUESTION 
NOW FOR FOUR WEEKS. 
SHE CAN DO THAT? 
AND WHERE IS THE OUT CRY OVER 
THE SAVAGE GANG MS 13 
AND ITS BLOODTHIRSTY CREED, 
"KILL, RAPE, AND 
CONTROL"? 
I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 
HEAR DIRECTLY FROM 
THESE FAMILIES ABOUT THE PAIN 
THEY HAVE HAD TO 
ENDURE LOSING NOT ONLY THEIR 
LOVED ONCE, GREAT 
PEOPLE. 
GREAT AMERICANS, PEOPLE THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 
SUCCESSFUL. 
PEOPLE THAT IN SOME CASES COULD 
HAVE BEEN HERE ONE 
DAY. 
COULD HAVE BEEN HERE. 
I KNOW THE WAY YOU FEEL. 
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT 
HERE, STANDING HERE. 
FIRST I'D LIKE TO ASK A FRIEND 
OF MINE FOR A 
LISTENING TIME, LAURA WILL CORE 
SON FROM PERLIN, 
TEXAS, TO COME AND SHARE HER 
STORY ABOUT HER 
INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE BOY, 
RIGHT? 
>> YES. 
>> COME ON, LAURA. 
JUST SAY A FEW WORDS. 
>> I WANT TO IT WILL YOU A 
LITTLE ABOUT JOSH. 
HE WAS BRUTALLY TORTURED, 
STRANGLED OVER AND OVER. 
HE WAS SET ON FIRE AFTER DEATH. 
HIS LAST HOURS WAS BRUTAL. 
NONE OF OUR KIDS HAD A MINUTE 
TO SAY GUNNEL. 
WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE 
SEPARATED FOR FIVE DAYS 
OR TEN DATES. 
WE'RE SEPARATED PERMANENTLY. 
ANYTIME WE WANT TO SEE OR BE 
CLOSE TO OUR KIDS, WE 
GO TO THE CEMETERY, BECAUSE 
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE. 
WE CAN NEVER SPEAK TO THEM. 
WE CAN'T SKYPE WITH THEM. 
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH 
IN THIS ROOM FOR 
WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- YOU GUYS 
KNOW THE PERMANENT 
SEPARATION. 
IT'S THE MEDIA THAT WON'T SHARE 
IT WITH OTHER 
PEOPLE. 
IT'S PERMANENT. 
WE CAN NEVER HAVE HIM BACK ON 
THIS EARTH. 
THANKFULLY I'LL SEE HIM AGAIN 
IN HEAVEN, BUT I WANT 
TO THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT, 
AND VICE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE FOR 
KEEPING THEIR 
COMMITMENT TO US. 
IT'S BEEN ONGOING. 
AND PLEASE UNDERSTAND, THERE 
ARE SO MANY MORE OF US 
THAN WHAT YOU SEE HERE THAT HAD 
THE SAME STORY OVER 
AND OVER. 
DRUNK DRIVING, KILLED, OVER AND 
OVER AND THEY DON'T 
PROSECUTE, OR THEY LET GO AND 
LOW BOND. 
THEY'RE OUT IN 30 DAYS. 
IT ISED IS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND 
IT'S TIME TO TAKE IT 
BACK. 
I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERY 
ONE OF YOU LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
YOU KNOW IT. 
YOU LOVE IT, AND YOU WANT TO DO 
YOUR JOBS. 
THANKFULLY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT 
THAT WILL ALLOW YOU 
TO DO IT NOW. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
. 
>> THANK YOU, LAURA. 
NEXT I'D LIKE TO ASK WARREN 
PENA FROM GREENFIELD, 
CALIFORNIA. 
WARREN, PLEASE COME UP. 
THANK YOU, WARREN. 
>> MY NAME IS ONE PENA. 
FIRST OF ALL,, I WANT TO THANK 
THE REMEMBRANCE 
PROJECT FOR BRINGING MY 
DAUGHTER'S NAME OUT TO LIGHT 
AND FOR CANDIDATE TRUMP TO LET 
ME SPEAK ABOUT HER, 
AND I GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
I NEED TO THANK. 
MY DAUGHTER WAS KRISTEN PENA. 
BACK IN 1990, SHE WAS 
KIDNAPPED, STRANGLED, STABBED, 
RAPED, AND SODOMIZED. 
AND HER BODY WAS FOUNDth AN 
ARTICHOKE FIELD. 
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR 28 AND A 
HALF YEARS. 
HE WAS LOS FOR 25. 
THE LAST 3 AND A HALF YEARS, 
HE'S BEEN FIGHTING 
EXTRADITION. 
AND ON MAY 3rd, GOD ANSWERED MY 
PRAYERS. 
MEXICO FINALLY TURNED HIM LOOSE 
TO US, AND HE IS NOW 
IN THE MONTEREY COUNTY JAIL, 
AND WE CAN START COURT 
PROCEDURES FOR MY DAUGHTER'S 
DEATH. 
AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY 
THAT WAS INVOLVED IN 
GETTING HIM OVER HERE. 
THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT OF 
MONTEREY COUNTY, FOR THE 
INVESTIGATOR, THE SHERIFF TOLD 
HER DON'T GIVE UP ON 
THIS. 
JUST STAY ON IT, AND STAY ON 
IT. 
AND SHE PINKY-SWORE SHE WAS 
BEGINNING GET HIM OVER

AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE 
PRESIDENT AND 
EVERYBODY. 
AND I JUST HOPE EVERYBODY CAN 
GET WHAT I JUST GOT.

THE THOUSANDS OF 
VICTIMS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. 
THANK YOU. 
. 
>> SO JUAN FOUGHT FOR MANY 
YEARS, AND IT'S HARD TO 
BELIEVE, BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY A 
GREAT FEELING. 
>> YES IT IS. 
>> DID JUST AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
INCREDIBLE JOB. 
>> S A HERE WITH US TODAY IS 
STEVEN ROENER BECK FROM 
MESA, ARIZONA. 
STEVE, IF YOU COULD COME UP AND 
SHARE A FEW WORDS, 
PLEASE. 
>> THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT. 
JANUARY 22nd, 2015, GRANT WAS 
AT WORK ON HIS 
OVERNIGHT SHIFT. 
AN ILLEGAL ALIEN CAME IN, 
WANTED TO BUY CIGARETTES. 
DUMPED A JAR OF CHANGE OUT ON 
THE COUNTER. 
GRANT WENT TO COUNT THE CHANGE, 
AND WASN'T COUNTING 
FAST ENOUGH. 
SO BASICALLY THIS MAN PULLED A 
GUN. 
GRANT DID EVERYTHING HE WAS 
SUPPOSED TO DO, AND GAVE 
HIM THE CIGARETTES. 
THE MAN WENT AHEAD AND, CUTED 
HIM AND SHOT HIM 
POINT-BLANK IN THE FACE. 
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HEAR THESE 
STORIES, AND SOME OF 
OUR MEDIA WON'T TALK TO YOU 
ABOUT IT. 
BUT THIS IS PERMANENT 
SEPARATION. 
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, I GO TO HIS 
GRAVE. 
FOR CHRISTMAS. 
WE SET UP A CHRISTMAS TREE ON 
GRANT'S GRAVE. 
I RECEIVED SOMETHING EARLIER 
TODAY, FROM DIRECTOR 
HOLMAN. 
IT'S A CHALLENGE COIN. 
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
THAT. 
TO ME, THIS IS A SIGN OF 
INTEGRITY. 
I WISH SYSTEM OF OUR MEDIA HAD 
THE SAME INTEGRITY AS 
OUR PRESIDENT, OUR VICE 
PRESIDENT, TECH TORE HOLMAN, 
ALL OF YOU IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
I WISH SOME OF OUR MEDIA HAD 
THE SAME INTEGRITY. 
AND I WANT TO THANK ALL IF YOU, 
ESPECIALLY OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FOR WHAT YOU DO. 
MR.  PRESIDENT, MR. VOMIT, 
THANK YOU. 
MEMBERS OF VOYLES, BARBARA 
GONZALES, JENNIFERRY, 
AVAC, I WANT TO THANK ALL OF 
THEM, TOO, BECAUSE 
THEY'RE HELPING GET THE STORIES 
OUT. 
SIXTY-THREE THOUSANDS AMERICANS 
SINCE 9/11 HAVE BEEN 
KILLED BY ILLEGAL ALIENS. 
THIS ISN'T A PROBLEM THAT'S 
GOING AWAY. 
IT'S GETTING BIGGER. 
THANK YOU. 
. 
>> SIXTY-THREE THOUSANDS. 
THAT NUMBER, THEY SAY, IS VERY 
LOW, BECAUSE THINGS 
AREN'T REPORTED. 
SIXTY-THREE THOUSANDS, AND YOU 
DON'T HEAR ABOUT 
THAT. 
ALSO HERE WITH US IS MICHELLE 
ROOT FROM MODELL, 
IOWA. 
GREAT PLACE. 
MICHELLE, PLEASE COME UP. 
>> THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT. 
MY DAUGHTER, SARAH BRUE WAS 
KILLED WITHIN 24 HOURS 
AFTER GRADUATING WITH A 
BACHELOR'S, 4.0 IN CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATIONS, OUT 
CELEBRATING, STOPPED AT A STOP, 
AND REAR ENDED BY ED WIN MAHIA, 
GOING 70 PLUS MILES 
AN HOUR. 
HE WAS ARRESTED, BUT THEN HE 
PAID A $0,000 BAIL, AND 
NOW HE HAS FLED. 
OUR SEPARATION, LIKE EVERYBODY 
HAS SAID, IS 
PARAMEDIC INNOCENT. 
SARAH NEVER GETS TO GO ON TO BE 
A WIFE, A MOTHER, A 
GRANDMOTHER, AN AUNT. 
MY SON DOES NOT HAVE HIS ONLY 
SIBLING ANY LONGER. 
MY LIFE HAS BEEN DEVASTATED. 
SO HAS MY DAUGHTER'S FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS. 
I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE, BARBARA GONZALES, JOHN 
FRAIRIE, AND DIRECTOR 
HOLMAN FOR ALL THEIR SUPPORT. 
THEY HAVE NEVER GIVEN UP ON US. 
ABEAC WAS A GROUP WE STARTED, 
BECAUSE WE WERE TIRED 
OF NOT HAVING NIBBLES TO GO TO 
TO GET INFORMATION. 
WHEN SARAH WAS KILLED JANUARY 
31st OF 2016, I HAD 
NOBODY. HE HAS BEEN THERE FROM 
THE BEGINNING, NEVER LEFT OUR 
SIDE. 
NOW WE JUST NEED TO GET MY 
DAUGHTER'S KILLER FOUND 
AGAIN. 
MY SEPARATION IS PERMANENT. 
SARAH IS NEVER COMING HOME. 
I NEVER GET TO TAKE A SELFIE 
WITH HER AGAIN. 
I HAVE NO MORE PICTURES OF HER. 
SO PLEASE, THANK YOU, GUYS FOR 
EVERYTHING. 
KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. 
OUR POLICE OFFICERS, OUR BORDER 
PATROL, PLEASE 
CONTINUE TO FIGHT. 
THANK YOU. 
. 
>>> MY NAME IS MARY ANNE 
MENDOSA, AND MY SON WAS 
KILLED ON MAY 12, 2014, ON HIS 
WAY HOME FROM WORK BY 
A THREE-TIME LEGAL LIMIT DRUNK, 
WHO WAS ALSO HIGH ON 
METH. 
HE DROVE OVER 35 MILES THE 
WRONG WAY ON 4 DIFFERENT 
FREEWAYS BEFORE SLAMMING HEAD 
ON INTO MY SON'S CAR. 
AS YOU KNOW, THEY COULD FILL 
THIS STAGE UP EVERY DAY 
FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS OF 
VICTIMS OF ILLEGAL ALIEN 
CRIME, AND IT WOULD JUST KEEP 
GOING. 
UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE MEMBERS 
OF A CLUB OF OUR 
CHILDREN, OUR LOVED ONES WHO 
HAVE BEEN KILLED BY 
ILLEGAL ALIENS, BUT THERE'S 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
VICTIMS EVERY YEAR WHO WERE 
AFFECTED BY ILLEGAL 
ALIEN CRIME, RAPE, ASSAULT, 
IDENTITY THEFT, THESE 
ARE THINGS THAT GO UNREPORTED, 
UNCHECKED. 
YOU KNOW, IF THE PUBLIC WOULD 
GO TO ALL 
LEGALALIENCRIMEREPORT.COM AND 
SEE THE MAGNITUDE OF 
CRIMES BEING COMMITTED BY 
ALIENS ALLOWED TO STAY IN 
THIS COUNTRY, YOU WILL BE 
SICKENED, BECAUSE THE 
MAINSTREAM MEDIA DOES NOT LET 
YOU KNOW WHO'S 
HAPPENING. 
WE ARE HERE TO EDUCATE THE 
PUBLIC OF WHAT'S 
HAPPENING, AND IF ANYBODY HAS 
BEEN A VICTIM OF 
ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIME, CONTACT 
US, BECAUSE WE HAVE 
CLOSE CONNECTIONS WITH BARBARA 
GONZALES AND ICE, 
JOHN FURY. 
WE HAVE CONNECTIONS AT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY THAT WE ARE TRYING TO 
GET PEOPLE THE HELP 
THEY NEED AND ISN'T IN THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE, YOU'VE JUST 
BEEN THERE FOR US, AND THERE 
ARE NO WORDS TO 
DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR SUPPORT AND 
YOUR CARING HAS MEANT 
TO EACH AND EVER ONE OF US, AND 
THANK YOU FROM THE 
BOTTOM OF MY HEART. 
>> THANK YOU. 
. 
>> YOUR STORY IS INCREDIBLE 
>>> I'M ONE OF YOUR LEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS. 
I CAME THE RIGHT WAY: I PAID 
LOTS OF MONEY, IT TOOK 
ME FIVE YEARS TO BECOME A 
CITIZEN, A PROUD CITIZEN. 
AND I DIDN'T DOCTORING MY SON-
IN-LAW. 
HE NAMED HIMSELF GERMAN 
CHOCOLATE. 
HE WAS BORN IN GERMANY. 
I DIDN'T DRAG HIM OVER 
BOARDERS, THROUGH DESERTS. 
I DIDN'T PLACE HIM IN HARM'S 
WAY. 
I PROTECTED MY CHILD FROM HARM, 
BUT I COULDN'T DO 
THAT ON JULY 12th, 2012. 
HE WAS 30 YEARS OLD. 
I COULDN'T PROTECT HIM, BECAUSE 
AN ILLEGAL ALIEN 
FROM GUATEMALA WITH TWO 
FELONIES, TWO DUIS. 
HE WAS PROTECTED. 
RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA, 
SANCTUARY. 
THE JUDGE, THE DA, THEY KNEW 
WHO HE WAS. 
THEY GAVE HIM PROBATION AFTER 
HIS SECOND DUI. 
FIVE WEEKS LATER, HE KILLED MY 
CHILD. 
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TO 
DELL WITH, THIS IS MY 
ONLY CHILD. 
I HAVE NO FAMILY. 
THAT'S IT. 
THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW, AND 
THEY DESERVE TO KNOW 
THIS COULD HAPPEN TO EACH ONE 
OF YOU IN ANY GIVEN 
SECOND. 
YOU HUG YOUR CHILD. 
YOU SEND THEM OFF, NO MATTER 
WHAT AGE THEY ARE. 
AND THAN YOU GET THAT UGLY 
PHONE CALL THAT WILL 
FOREVER CHANGE YOUR LIFE, AND 
THANK GOD OUR 
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT, 
MY FAMILY OF AVEAC, 
THEY RALLIED BEHIND US. 
THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES, AND 
GAVE US A LITTLE LIGHT: 
I WAS GOING TO END MY LIFE. 
I HAD NO PURPOSE, BUT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP COMING DOWN 
THAT'S COLLATOR THAT DAY AND 
TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION STOPPED ME IN MY 
TRACK. 
AND I HAD NO CLUE AT THAT POINT 
THAT I WOULD EVER BE 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
AND I THANK PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, 
EVERYBODY BEHIND ME, I THANK 
YOU. 
I THANK EVERYBODY OUT HERE. 
MAKE SURE YOU GET OUR STORIES 
OUT. 
I BROUGHT MY SON-IN-LAW. 
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE LEFT, HIS 
ARABLES. 
I WEAR HIS ASHES IN A LOCKET. 
THIS IS HOW I GET TO HUG MY 
SON. 
SO REMEMBER WHEN YOU GO HOME 
AND HUG YOUR KIDS, THAT 
THERE ARE MANY OF US, THOUSANDS 
OF US WHO DON'T GET 
TO DO THAT ANYMORE. 
AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER AND GET 
THIS DONE. 
ALL POLITICIANS, I DON'T CARE 
WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON, 
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CHILD IN A 
CASKET OR IN AN URN. 
SO GET IT TOGETHER, FOR GOD'S 
SAKE, FOR THIS 
COUNTRY, FOR OUR CITIZENS. 
THANK YOU. 
. 
>> MY NAME IS RAY TRANCHANT, 
AND I RETEARED FROM THE 
NAVY. 
I FLEW OFF OF AIRCRAFT 
CARRIERS, HAD A GREAT NAVY 
CAREER, AND THEN I STARTED MY 
FAMILY IN THE ú90S. 
I HAD TWO LITTLE GIRLS, TESSA 
AND KELSEA. 
AND THEY HAD A BIGGER BROTHER, 
DILLON. 
AND I RAISED THEM, AND THEIR 
MOTHER AND HER MOM IS 
HISPANIC, AND TESSA WAS 
HISPANIC. 
AND THEY LIVE NEAR THE BORDER 
AS WELL. 
TESSA WAS 16. 
SHE WAS A DREAMER, AND SO WAS 
HER FRIEND ALLIE 
KUNHART. 
SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD, 16 YEARS 
OLD, BOTH BEAUTIFUL 
GIRLS, AND THEY JUST LOVED 
TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. 
THEY WENT TO A WAWA IN VIRGINIA 
BATCH TO GET A PACK 
OF GUM, AND WERE STOPPED AT A 
STOP, AND AL FRAY DOE 
RAMOS WAS DRIVING AT 70 MILES 
AN HOUR. 
HE WAS THREE TIMES THE LEGAL 
LIMIT. 
HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE FOR 
DUI IN WHICH THE 
JUDGE GAVE HIM NO TIME OR 
FINES. 
HE HAD A FAKE I.D. 
FROM FLORIDA BY THE CARTELS. 
HE HAD A FAKE DRIVER'S LICENSE 
ON HIS CAR. 
AND HE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. 
AND HE NEEDED AN INTERPRETER 
FOR THE LAST DUI 
HEARING. 
HE WAS ALSO ARRESTED FOR 
DRUNKEN IN PUBLIC. úBOTTOM LINE 
THROUGH MESA, AND HE TRIED 
TO MAKE IT, AND HE WAS GOING -- 
HE WAS THREE TIMES 
THE LEGAL LIMIT. 
SO THE POLICE TOLD ME THAT AT 
THAT, IT'S LIKE 
WEARING ALMOST BLACK-OUT 
GLASSES WHEN YOU'RE 
DRIVING. 
WHEN HE HIT THE GIRLS FROM 
BEHIND, IT WAS AN 
EXPLOSION. 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD THOUGHT A BOMB 
WENT OFF. 
THE GIRLS WERE ALMOST 
INSTANTANEOUSLY DEAD. 
THEY WORKED ON TESSA FOR 
AWHILE, AND I GOT TO SEE 
HER IN THE HOSPITAL. 
THOSE FROM THE DREAMERS THAT 
THE UNITED STATES 
SHOULD FOCUS ON. 
I CAN'T MAKE AN OPINION ABOUT 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT 
ARE HERE ILLEGALLY BECAUSE 
THEIR PARENTS BROUGHT 
THEM, BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU 
THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. 
AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO BLAME, 
BUT THE PARENTS OF 
THOSE CHILDREN ARE TO BLAME, 
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF, 
"WELL, MAYBE THEY'LL FEEL SORRY 
FOR THEM, BECAUSE 
THEY'RE KIDS, AND MAYBE IF 
THEY'LL BEHAVE, THEY'LL 
JUST MAGICALLY BEAT THE 
SYSTEM." 
MY MOM CAME FROM IRELAND. 
IT TOOK HER TEN YEARS TO GET 
HER CITIZENSHIP. 
SHE HAD A SPONSOR. 
IF SHE GOT IN TROUBLE, NOT ONLY 
DID SHE GET IN 
TROUBLE, THE SPONSOR WAS IN 
TROUBLE. 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN SPEAKING 
NORTHERN IRISH NOW IF SHE 
GOT OUT OF LINE. 
THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS WITH INS 
IN THOSE DAYS, AND 
MOM LOVED BEING AN MERGE. 
I HELPED HER STUDY FOR EXAM. 
SO I'M ALL ABOUT LEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
BUT THE INVADERS AND PEOPLE WHO 
COME OVER OUR 
BORDERS AND STY TO TAKE THE LAW 
IN THEIR OWN HANDS 
AND MAYBE ARE SUPPORTED BY A 
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT 
FOR GOD SAKES I DON'T KNOW WHY 
THEY WOULD WANT TO DO 
IT, IT'S EVIL, IT HURT PEOPLE, 
AND IT COSTS US 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. 
AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO 
PAY FOR IT. 
THEY WANT US TO PAY FOR IT, THE 
OTHER TAX PAIRS. 
I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, BECAUSE WHEN MY -- 
THOSE KIDS DIED, I WAS -- I WAS 
A CITY EMPLOYEE. 
SO OF COURSE I SUED THE CITY 
AND IT JUDGE AND THE 
ADJOINING CITY WITH THE JUDGE 
THERE, AND, OF 
COURSE,, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE 
IMMUNE. 
BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE ME REALLY 
FRIENDLY WITH THE CITY. 
IT DIDN'T MAKE ME FRIENDLY WITH 
ICE, BECAUSE 
BASICALLY THEY CLAIMED THEY 
WEREN'T CALLED. 
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAID, 
"WITH CALLED THEM," 
AND IT WAS A BACK AND FORTH. 
NO ONE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY. 
BEING IN THAT SITUATION WHERE 
NO ONE TAKES 
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS 
GOVERNMENT AT ALL MEANS THAT 
YOU'RE STANDING IN A DARK 
FOREST AT NIGHT WHEN IT'S 
RAINING, AND IT'S COLD, AND 
YOU'RE LOST. 
EVERYBODY YOU TALK TO, YEAH, 
YEAH, YEAH, BUT HE WAS 
DRUNK, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF 
DRUNKS. 
LET ME TELL YOU, THE GUY 
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE 
AT THAT TIME. 
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE, 
AND WE HAD MANY 
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET HIM OUT. 
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING? 
OUR REPRESENTATIVE IS THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
THEY TOOK US IN, AND WE'RE 
GOING TO FIGHT THIS 
BATTLE. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO CLEAN IT UP, 
AND I'M VERY PROUD 
OF THAT. 
I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A PART OF 
THAT, AND I WILL 
SUPPORT YOU AS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AND MY PRESIDENT AND 
VICE PRESIDENT SUBPOENAS THEY 
NEED. 
I WANT TO THANK THE REMEMBRANCE 
PROJECT FOR STANDING 
THERE WHEN I HAD NO ONE ELSE. 
AND GOD BLESS YOU, AND I HOPE 
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO 
YOU. 
>> THANK YOU.  
THANK YOU. 
>> THIS IS SOME SELLECK, EXCEPT 
BETTER LOOKING, 
RIGHT? 
BETTER LOOKING. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
MY NAME IS ANGEL MOM AGNES 
GIBBANY. 
MY FAMILY IMMIGRATED FROM HUNG 
BAYRY. 
WE ESCAPED DURING THE 
REVELATION. 
WE COULDN'T COME TO THE UNITED 
STATES AS MY MOTHER 
PLANNED, BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS 
BORN IN YUGOSLAVIA 
AND THEY WANTED TO STAY, AND 
BECAUSE MY MOTHER SAID 
NO, THEY DIDN'T ALLOW US TO 
COME TO THE AMERICAN 
EMBASSY. 
WE HAD A CHOICE OF SOUTH AFRICA 
OR BRAZIL. 
WE WANT TO BRAZIL AND LIVED 
THERE 13 YEARS, TRYING 
TO LEGALLY IMMIGRATE TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
WHEN WE IMMIGRATED TO BRAZIL, 
WE WERE STATELESS. 
WE DIDN'T BELONG ANYWHERE, 
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 
TOOK OUR CITIZENSHIP, BECAUSE 
WE ESCAPED. 
AND WHEN WE CAME TO THE UNITED 
STATES, WE WERE 
STATELESS, AND I'M VERY HONORED 
AND PROUD TO SAY 
THIS IS MY HOME, MY COUNTRY, 
AND I WILL FIGHT FOR 
THIS COUNTRY UNTIL MY DEATH. 
THANK YOU, LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
BOARDER PATROL, 
IMMIGRATION, HARBOR, EVERYBODY 
THAT GOT ME HERE 
TODAY, AND THANK YOU FOR 
FIGHTING THIS FIGHT WITH 
US, BECAUSE TRUST ME, YOU DON'T 
WANT TO WALK IN OUR 
SHOES. 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, THANK YOU 
FOR ALWAYS STANDING 
BEHIND US. 
YOU ARE THE BIGGEST BIRTHDAY 
PRESENT I GOT, AND I'M 
STILL WAITING FOR THAT SHELL TO 
HELP BUILD THE WALL. 
I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. 
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK, IF I DON'T 
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR 
THE CITY TO BECOME A SANCTUARY 
STATE, SO I WOULD 
LIKE TO ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP IF 
YOU WERE TO ENDORSE 
US, TO FIGHT SANCTUARY 
STATE.COM TO HELP US SO WE'RE 
NOT GOING TO GO DOWN. 
BECAUSE IF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES 
ON THIS PATH, THE 
REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL 
FOLLOW. 
AND I AM SO PROUD AND HONORED 
OF YOU, MR.  
PRESIDENT, THE INTEGRITY AND 
CHARACTER THAT YOU HAVE 
SHOWN US, PULLING THE DAGGERS 
OUT OF YOUR BACK EVER 
DAY, IT HASN'T BEEN FAIR, BUT I 
WANT YOU TO KNOW 
THAT I'M VERY HONORED TO CALL 
YOU MY PRESIDENT. 
AND GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR 
FAMILY ALWAYS, AND 
MR. PENCE. 
AND GOD BLESS THIS COUNTRY. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
. 
. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT. 
THIS IS MY SON DREW. 
HE WS IN LAW SCHOOL IN SAN 
FRANCISCO IN 2010 WHEN 
ROBERTO GALO TRIED TO MAKE A 
LAST-SECOND LEFT-HAND 
TURN AND HIT HIM INSTEAD OF 
STOPPING. 
HE TRIED TO FLEE, SO HE 
ACCELERATED, DROVE OVER HIS 
BODY. 
MY SON WAS ON A MOTORCYCLE. 
HIS HELMET CAME OFF, WEDGED 
UNDER ONE OF HIS TIRES. 
HE BACKED UM, DRIVING OVER HIM 
A SECOND TIME, AND 
THEN TRYING TO GET AWAY, WENT 
FORWARD. 
BY THAT TIME A GUY HAD GOTTEN 
OUT OF A CAR AND 
STOPPED WITH HIS REAR TIRE ON 
MY SON'S ABDOMEN, AND 
FIVE PEOPLE HAD TO LIFT THE CAR 
OFF OF HIM. 
BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
SOMEBODY ELSE. 
AND YOU HEARDING A NECESSARY 
MENTION FIGHT 
SANCTUARYSTATE.COM. 
IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, I FILED 
WITH THE STATE OF 
CALIFORNIA AN INITIATIVE TO 
OVERTURN THE SANCTUARY 
STATE. 
THERE'S JUST WAY TOO MANY 
DEATHS, WAY TOO MANY 
TRAFFIC COLLISIONS. 
I SHOULD JUST ADD OWN AN ASIDE, 
WE GAVE OUT DRIVER'S 
LICENSES IN 2015, AND IN 2 
YEARS, THE FIRST 2 YEARS 
OF THAT, TRAFFIC FATALITIES ON 
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO 
BE SAFER ROADS, HAVE GONE UP 
19%. 
HIT AND RUNS HAVE GONE UP 26%. 
YET THEY'RE STILL TELLING 
PEOPLE THE ROADS ARE SAFER 
BECAUSE OF THAT. 
BUT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER -- 
SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT 
HERE, A WOMAN NAMED VERONICA 
CABRERA RAMIREZ, TO 
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHAT 
HAPPENS WITH SANCTUARY, SHE 
WAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM, 
CALLED THE SANTA 
ROSA POLICE. 
THEY ARRESTED THE PERPETRATOR. 
HE HAD BEEN DEPORTED 
PREVIOUSLY. 
ICE FILED A DETAINER. 
THE DAY THEY DECIDED TO RELEASE 
HIM, INSTEAD OF 
CALLING ICE AND ICE A CHANCE TO 
SHOW UP, THEY 
RELEASED HIM, AND 16 CAUSE 
LATER, HE MURDERED 
MS. RAMIREZ. 
AND ACCORDING TO KEVIN DELEON, 
WHO WAS THE AUTHOR OF 
THE SANCTUARY BILL, THAT MAKES 
THE STATE SAFER. 
IF YOU KEEP LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OVER HERE AND YOU KEEP 
THE STATE ENFORCEMENT OVER 
HERE, THAT MAKES THE 
STATE SAFER. 
THAT'S ABSURD, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS, 
AND SOMETHING HAS TO 
BE DONE. 
AND I HOPE, ASKING A NECESSARY 
-- IF WE DON'T KILL 
THIS IN CALIFORNIA, IT WILL 
SPREAD. 
I KNOW IT ALREADY IS IN SOME 
PLACES. 
IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE FOR 
AMERICAN LAW-ABIDING 
CITIZENS. 
ANY WAY I'D LIKE TO THANK THE 
PRESIDENT, VICE 
PRESIDENT, EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S 
HERE, DR. HOLMAN 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
YOU'VE BECOME A CREDIBLE 
FRIEND. 
JOHN FURY, BARBARA GONZALES, 
AND MY NEW FRIEND 
TODAY, CHRIS TENNESSEE NIELSEN. 
ANYWAY, THANK YOU ALL VERY 
MUCH, PARTICULARLY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
>> AND I JUST SAID, "WOULD YOU 
LIKE TO SPEAK." 
AND YOU SAID, "NO." 
SHE SAID, "I'VE BEEN CRYING FOR 
TOO LONG, FOR TOO 
MUCH." 
SO IT'S FINE. 
THAT'S GOOD. 
>>> WELL, I JUST WANT TO THANK 
EVERYBODY FOR BEING 
HERE. 
I KNOW THESE FAMILIES. 
I KNOW MANY MORE FAMILIES THAT 
HAVE BEGUN THROUGH 
THE SAME THING. 
AND I CANNOT IMAGINE IT BEING 
ANY WORSE, BUT WE 
PLEDGE TO ACT WITH STRENGTH AND 
WITH RESOLVE AND IN 
THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO HAVE 
BEEN LOST SO 
NEEDLESSLY. 
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF FAMILIES 
LIKE YOURS THAT MY 
ADMINISTRATION CREATED THE NEW 
OFFICE OF DHS, THE 
VICTIMS OF IMMIGRANT CRIMEN 
GAUGE. 
, WHICH HAS BEEN DOING, I HEAR, 
A FANTASTIC JOB. 
THEY CALL IT VOICE SO YOUR 
VOICES CAN BE HEARD. 
TODAY WE HAVE RELEASED THE 
FIRST VOICE REPORT WITHIN 
THE FIRST MONTH OF VOICE. 
WE'VE OPENED MORE THAN 2,800 
VICTIMS REGISTERED TO 
RECEIVE INFORMATION ON THEIR 
PERPETRATOR. 
WE'RE FOLLOWING THESE PEOPLE. 
WE'RE FOLLOWING THEM SO IT 
CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN BY 
THAT INDIVIDUAL. 
VOICE ASSISTED HUNDREDS OF 
FAMILIES, ALREADY 
CONNECTED THEM TO CRUCIAL 
SERVICES, SUCH AS GRIEF 
úCOUNSE 
CASES AND HELPED ENSURE 
THE CRIMINAL ALIENS THAT HARMED 
THEIR FAMILIES SO 
EGREGIOUSLY WERE DETAINED, 
REMOVED, AND DEPORTED. 
OUR FIRST DUTY AND HIGHEST 
LOYALTY IS TO THE 
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES. 
WE WANT SAFETY IN OUR COUNTRY. 
WE WANT BORDER SECURITY. 
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE IN OUR 
COUNTRY THAT DON'T GO 
THROUGH A PROCESS. 
WE WANT PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY 
BASED ON MERIT, NOT 
BASED ON A DRAW, WHERE OTHER 
COUNTRIES PUT THEIR 
ABSOLUTE WORST IN A BIN, AND 
THEY START DRAWING 
PEOPLE. 
YOU THINK THEY OAR GOING TO PUT 
THEIR GOOD ONES? 
THEY DON'T PUT THEIR GOOD ONCE. 
THEY PUT THEIR BAD ONCE. 
THEN WHEN THEY COMMIT CRIMES, 
WE'RE SO SURPRISED. 
WE'LL NOT REST UNTIL OUR 
BOARDER IS SECURE, OUR 
CITIZENS ARE SAFE, AND WE 
FINALLY END THE 
IMMIGRATION CRISIS ONCE AND FOR 
ALL. 
WE WANT SAFETY IN OUR COUNTRY. 
WE WANT STRONG BORDERS. 
WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN, BUT 
WE WANT THEM TO COME 
IN THE PROPER WAY. 
SO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING 
HERE. 
THESE ARE INCREDIBLE FAMILIES, 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
YOUR LOVED ONES HAVE NOT DIED 
IN VAIN. 
MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY 
IS BECAUSE OF WHAT 
YOU'VE HAD TO ENDURE, AND WE 
JUST THANK YOU ALL VERY 
MUCH FOR BEING HERE. 
AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL. 
THANK YOU. 
. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
. 
>> CLEARLY EMOTIONS RUNNING SO 
HIGH ON BOTH SIDES OF 
THIS ISSUE. 
YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESS 
IMMIGRATION. 
HE HOSTED FAMILIES OF PEOPLE 
KILLED BY UNDOCUMENTED 
IMMIGRANTS. 
THIS COMES, OF COURSE, AS 
CONGRESS WORKS TO COME ONE 
AN IMMIGRATION BILL AND THE 
FUTURE OF CHILDREN 
SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES 
REMAINS UNCLEAR. 
>>> MORE NEWS AHEAD. 
THIS IS CBSN.
