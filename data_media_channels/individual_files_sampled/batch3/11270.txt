yeah Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report it's time once again for the show that rocks tup oh my gosh we're rocking the boat Stacy Donald Trump is certainly rocking the boat internationally he's upsetting the New World Order he's creating his own World Order of Chaos and of course this is negotiating technique many people believe in the business world as you act so deranged and crazy that your opponent the other side of the trade table Thanks this guy we don't know what he's gonna do so we're gonna talk a little bit in this episode about these these threats of trade war and things like this I'm renegotiating NAFTA of course Donald Trump was elected primarily by people who were looking for him to cause this sort of international trade war that wanted him to pull out of NAFTA that wanted him to pull out of trans-pacific partnership and TTIP the transatlantic trade and investment partnership so all these deals he pulled out of and a lot of people on Twitter are mostly neoliberal sorts and thing and hate Donald Trump so I'm gonna look at these two tweets from this guy Luke Grohmann who's responding to people on Twitter saying oh my god basically Donald Trump has bankrupted the US we're doomed but I would like to take it one step further the u.s. has defaulted roughly every 40 years for the past 80 years 1933 in 1971 and in each of the prior two cases the default was done in binary fashion by a surprise unilateral decision of the u.s. president of course responding to Donald Trump unilaterally basically with a surprise decision announcing a trade war with these steel tariffs right well 1971 the u.s. closed the gold window that was a default yes a major default under Nixon said Oh temporary of course it became permanent and correct so applying the same standards as you would any other president Trump's doing exactly what every other president has done you know the thing about Trump is that he made a tremendous mark a success in a 1 trillion dollar economy called Manhattan and which is bigger than most countries in the world and so to be able to kind of rock and roll through the global economy like this is what a lot of people would argue is needed to rough it up to bring back some some agency for America you and I on crisis report have been talking to Dan Collins who is an American who lives in Shanghai and he has the China money report calm and he told us on Kai's report over a year ago that there's been a trade war going on for the last decade or two and but the US doesn't seem to know that they're in it the you that China has been exercising a trade war against America and America is losing that trade war so perhaps who knows trade war since 1776 I mean the world economy is a trade war I mean that that's the way trade is it's not its trade of what sometimes gets extremely hostile if you will and actually leads to hot wars you know a lot of times people make that argument but anytime you have people exchanging goods from one country to another and currencies that are predominately the US dollar the US dollar being world reserve currency is an of trade war in a lot of ways now you mentioned 1971 when the u.s. went off the gold center that was the International gold standard in 1933 they first went bankrupt according to Luke Roman when they basically made it illegal for citizens of the United States to own gold and confiscated their gold and that kept them on the gold standard the international trade standard up until 1971 now since then we've been on the US dollar standard so this is another headline relating to the US dollar and Trump between tax reform aka capital controls with US characteristics tariffs and sanctions the US appears to be accelerating the weaponization of the US dollar the US will likely soon find this to be an even bigger mistake than sending large amounts of US jobs factories and IP to China he was responding to a tweet about a Stephen Newton who says Trump's is supportive of Treasury working Russia sanctions says to expect sanctions in next several weeks on February 27th he had said to expect it within 30 days the notion of sanctions of course you know another guest of ours Jim Rickards has talked about this as usdollar weaponization of the u.s. dollar right now is the US dollar not already weaponized okay because the US dollar is backed by nothing unless you want to include the Pentagon and when countries try to get out of the US dollars the world reserve currency they tend to meet a militaristic and so it's already it's been weaponized all along and so how is this different really I mean it's always been about u.s. dollar debt being imposed on the world in exchange for cheap goods speaking of these trade deals remember I mentioned TTIP and TPP the two big trade deals that Hillary had wanted she was championing them as Secretary of State Obama was negotiating those over the years and they were so close to signing but it didn't get to the point where they could sign it before Obama left office and of course people in Wisconsin in Pennsylvania in Ohio places like this they did not want those trade deals because they already saw that the trade deals like NAFTA and well there's no real trade deal with China it's just free trade with China China has their own sort of subsidies and tariffs on their own goods and stuff like that they've their protectionist but they've already seen the Midwest saw the loss of all these jobs so one thing about why Europeans did not want for example TTIP which is a trans-pacific that transatlantic trade and investment partnership is they didn't want American chicken for example because American chicken has all sorts of bleach on it which European chicken does not by law they're not even allowed to have chicken but nobody wants the consumer themselves don't want it so here in America we see a similar thing consumers are demanding cage free cruelty free eggs for example and you see this in any supermarket in America even the biggest name supermarkets there's a huge section on cruelty free eggs well the corporation's don't like that big egg does not like this consumers are revolting against animal cruelty so the poultry industry is lobbying laws to force stores to sell their eggs so as consumers are rebelling in Iowa which is the largest seller of eggs and producer of eggs in America the big AG is forcing the state to pass laws demanding that grocery stores have to store this if they accept any food stamps or EBT you know any assistance any poor people go in there and buy eggs they they need to store cruelty eggs right the key being there the ABT card the food stamp e EBT card the food stamp program government subsidization has removed freedom of choice from the consumer in a way that is perpetuating a model of cruelty in the agricultural sector by choice by chance in other words how did these people become impoverished to begin with if it were not for the Ola Koppel ization of these corporations to push out the entrepreneurialism in America in favor of a kleptocracy corp RC and crony capitalism resulting now in consumers being forced to eat and consume eggs that are the byproduct or product direct product of chickens that are being tortured to death hmm well I guess that's not a great mark for capitalism no and here these companies said it was consumer demand and this is why they needed to torture these chickens and these chickens are kept in cages whereby they can't even move they can't move at all they can't turn they can't do anything they're just forced into these cages in California California was the first to pass a proposition to a year or two ago whereby no cruelty eggs are allowed in there grocery stores at all so this is Iowa trying to preempt that from even happening in Iowa and they're trying to also get federal law to force California to force their consumers to take these products but this is a lot of what these international trade deals that the u.s. operates under it's always on behalf of the corporation's they benefit from it it appears based on observation of places like Wisconsin or Michigan or Pennsylvania that many workers did not benefit certainly in the United States perhaps in China but certainly not in the United States from the trade deals it's these people like these big agriculture who have benefited from the trade deals and it seems to be on behalf of those so remember these are the the trade deals even TPP remember they were gonna force Japan to have to take American beef which Japanese consumers did not want to eat American beef because of things like Mad Cow and the way it's raised here compared to how its raised in Japan where they get fed beer super or sad you know when you think about it because this is the result of ultra aggressive marketing that makes things like tortured chickens hip and fashionable carne that big agriculture I remember when they used to ran a campaign of celebrating the egg that everything was exactly you know the incredible edible egg they ran for a while back many decades ago but these are now they should have the same one the incredible edible a tortured chicken egg you know but people shouldn't have the choice obviously they don't want to eat but they don't have the choice in an economy that's dominated by prison well they did have the choice max they did have the choice and that is the problem here that has presented itself to these big agriculture oligopolies that the consumer when given the choice chose to have the cruelty free eggs but they did not want the cruelty free eggs that they did not want to change their business model they they were like bad consumer we must punish them by forcing them by law get the law to force them to take our eggs whereby we stuff all these chickens into cages they're not don't allow them the option we even have that's right they're being deprived of that choice and you mentioned oligopoly zation I have this headline here yeah regarding that and the food supply the Oleg Oppel ization of food supply hits a snag German drug in Agra chemicals giant bear has suffered a setback in his first to acquire the world's biggest seed company Monsanto bear had reckoned on winning regulatory approval for at sixty three point five billion dollar take over at the beginning of this year but this week the company cautioned that it could take longer than expected to receive final clearance from EU regulators the mega merger would have made it the the world's largest supplier of seeds and farm chemicals we've seen this trend o the Obama administration had already approved this merger I think Brazil also approved it so they were just waiting for the EU to approve this huge merger I think it would have then reduced it to basically four it's always three or four right but usually for the big four banks the big four accounting firms the big for food firms like we're all on their company you know we're all in their company store that's the only option one of these four corporations you got to buy all your food from get your banking services from get your accounting services from these are the this is always how the Olga polarization works right so what the deal apparently is off no they they thought they would get read like just a stamped approval yes go ahead obviously this is the wave of the future we only need four corporations running the entire global economy the global food distribution and they expected that the EU regulators are saying wait wait wait wait wait hold on do we really want four companies controlling eighty five percent of the global food supply and seed supply so we need to think about this and now they have to wait so it could it could be approved the way things always work is I'm sure it will be approved but right now it's not being rubber stamped as easily as they thought it would be and big case we made for it should not be approved but anyway we're gonna take a break and when we come back a very exciting interview coming away so don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to New York City and speak with author professor dr. Michael Hudson who in a previous life was a balance-of-payments economist for Chase Manhattan Bank we'll get into why that's important in a second here dr. Michael Hudson welcome back to the Kaiser report me here again max Donald Trump steel tariffs are they warranted are they a good idea what's going on dr. Michael Hudson I think what they are is a shakedown they don't seem to make sense economically and I'll explain that later but I've been spending two days trying to figure out since the logic is a travesty of protectionism is going to squeeze American producers who use us steel and aluminum so there must be something else and I think that something else is he's trying to really go Trump is trying to renegotiate the tariffs with a Canada and Mexico and these are the countries that are the most highly hit in steel and aluminum exports the United States so I think what Crump is saying and he's already said well I will exempt them from these tariffs and I'll prove it I'll save them from having unemployment in their steel and aluminium industries if they give a couple of concessions and rewrite NAFTA and I think his plan to rename that NAFTA is to go to Mexico and say ok we'll exempt you from these tariffs but you have to build that wall and you have to give us other gains as well and obviously the president is not going to pay money to build that wall because his concern is with his own Mexican voters not with American voters and as for Canada they've lost out on every kind of agreement they've made since the auto agreements of the 1960's with the United States and I think Trump is saying to Canada well look you're going to have unemployment in your steel industry and especially elk in Canada's aluminum companies unless you make a give back to us and auto part trade and agriculture sheral trade and certain other trade things and of course Canada I think has reached the point at which they sort of had enough of this pushing and and they can't politically do it and still hold on to power so I think it's a no-go there and then just today Trump has come out and said well you know today's the day that the trans-pacific partnership is going to be settled abroad by many of the Asian countries and under this new deal without the United States being a member that will exclude American agricultural and other exports by giving it'll give preference to Australian to other countries so I think Trump is already said well I prefer bilateral agreements because bilaterally we can divide and conquer and smash them up and so he will then tell the Asian nations unless you make a special deal for American agriculture we're going to put special tariffs on you and it's the whole thing is going to be a weakens through your economy if you don't go along with what we're proposing for you and let's suppose that other countries say well I'm sorry we can't afford to do this we're not going when you when you come up mr. Trump and you say I'm gonna win and you're going to lose all our voters are going to read that in this paper and they're not going to let us do that so here's what's going to happen I think Trump will indeed I say okay he'll try to bully them he'll raise the tariffs on steel and aluminum in the last month steel prices have gone up 33 percent and aluminum prices 40 percent according to the Financial Times at grams and this is already squeezed companies that use aluminum and like cake makers for for our beer and people that make things out of it that now they're going to be squeezed with higher raw materials prices but there are no tariffs on the finished manufacturers coming in from Asia or Europe so this is going to be the reverse of what protectionism is supposed to be there's a long legacy of good protectionist arguments and the strategy is you import your raw materials cheaply and you try to get monopoly goods and high value-added exports but uh what Trump is doing is the reverse of the way that England and America and Germany and France all got rich on protectionism he's raising the price of raw materials and squeezing the higher manufacturers so the effect of his policy is going to be D industrialization and unemployment rather than and nobody is going to build a new steel mill or a new aluminum mill because they don't believe that these tariffs being so self-destructive of manufacturing have much chance of lasting very long so the protectionist logic of raising tariffs to enable the manufacturers to get enough money so that they can afford to invest more factories and hire more people that's not going to work there's no logic to it economically let's talk about steel I mean anytime we're talking about trade and trade policies there's a lot of moving parts and it's difficult to wade through all of the economics and the incentives going across the globe in different countries but let's just talk about steel for a second so he's obviously trying to create more high-paying jobs in the steel industry by putting on these tariffs in such a way as to level the playing field in the steel industry the recently laid off steel workers you know can go back to work so it's not necessarily about building a new steel factory but putting guys back on the floor now you've got some higher paid jobs and politically this sounds like a winner it's he said he was going to increase jobs and bring back steel so in the short term at least this seems like there's a lot of political logic to it as you point out though dr. Hudson so if American were are now suddenly getting some higher price jobs in the steel business that would infer that some high-priced workers and other countries are gonna get squeezed right so but but in the short term for political expediency this as far as cosmetics go looks like it could be a winner right it looks like it if you take into account only the what's happening with America a few jobs being created here and the question is how many jobs will be lost the Manufacturers Association the Department of Commerce the number of think tanks have already said they're going to be many more manufacturing jobs lost then steel jobs are created and for every job that's gained here as you just pointed out somebody's going to lose a job in Canada and Mexico and what do you think their response is going to be their response is going to be to retaliate and now that now they get not only do their manufacturers who can buy the steel that wasn't exported to the US to make steel goods their manufacturers can I make these steel goods and export them to the United States and a having cheaper raw materials than the American manufacturers themselves that so they can do that and Canada and Mexico and other countries get to retaliate and cherry-pick well what kind of American high-technology exports that we want to exclude and retaliate they help us well Canada has Bombardier company making rail cars and airplanes it can certainly put limits on Boeing Mexico can limit American beer and build up its own beer industry there's this is not a trade war that America can win as easily as mr. Trump thinks that he can I remember under Obama in previous administrations there was always a line about well we've made a deal we've got to honor the deal and it seems like Donald Trump doesn't have that kind of same ethos when it comes to deal making he's like this no No Deal is a deal I can't rip up this how does this play into things I mean on one hand you could say it's dishonorable but on the other hand you could say that radical approach is needed he was voted as a change maker and as a rogue element in American politics he's got to rip up these deals and start fresh but how does that play globally dr. Hudson well remember the title of mr. Trump's book the art of breaking the deal that's how he made all of his money he stiffed the suppliers when it came time to pay he'd say well I really don't like the quality I'll give you 80% of what you want oh maybe 50% of what you want if you don't like it's been five years suing me and it's really cheaper for you to take a 20% or 30% cut he stiffed the banks he said I'm sorry there's no money to pay I'm have to go bankruptcy bankrupt and wipe you out unless you renegotiate the deal same thing for labor unions well you know I promise to pay you but you know I really don't like to work I'm not gonna pay what I promised so he made us fortune by breaking the deal and in business and you know the criminal parts of society that works it doesn't work in international diplomacy so much because now a foreign countries will say wait a minute if we sign a deal with the United States like Iran signed the deal with all the other countries and then the United States can say well we're going to break the deal we broke the deal international trade deals in the 1960s we broke them in the 1970s in the 1980s that's what we do honoring the deal is for you guys we can break it any time we want any time we think we can not cause you so many problems well you can go to court you can wait to get paid you can wait to retaliate we can stall and just act quicker and hurt you this is going to make other countries believe that I think the Russian term is not agreement were they not agreement credible they won't believe that America can be part of trade agreements for military agreements or disarmament agreements the whole idea of holding two international agreements and thrown out the window typically whenever any policy changes you have Wall Street rushing in to capitalize on in some way using their over leveraged models and access to finance and their control the central bank and Donald Trump ostensibly is doing something to help American workers and will he be able to get this past Wall Street in other words world will the companies that are affected by this somehow engineer a way to maybe take this in engage in stock buybacks and other financial tricks that they're used to in other words it can Donald Trump put a policy in to help workers and in a way that shuts Wall Street out of their vulture as' kind of predatory techniques well in the past Wall Street's always been able to go to Congress because Congress is in charge of trade deals not the executive branch but what Trump has done is a very clever way of locking Wall Street out and locking Congress out this is the tariffs are not part of the trade agreement technically they're our national security our national security is being threatened you'll say bye-bye having you okay but listen if you say he's figured out a way to lock Wall Street out that sounds good to me can you stay for another segment sure well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert like to thank our guest dr. Michael Hudson if you want to catch us on twitter is Kaiser report until next time bye all
