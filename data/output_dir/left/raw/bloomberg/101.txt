00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,300
There’s a cloud looming over the future of clean energy.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,780
It’s called curtailment, and it’s the biggest obstacle to weaning the world off fossil fuels.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,100
Curtailment actually happens when we produce too much wind or solar power

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,580
at certain times of the day and we have to just — shut it down.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,020
But what if we sent that extra electricity into giant batteries,

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,980
to use when the sun goes down or the wind stops blowing?

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,520
That day just might be coming sooner than you think.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,420
The easiest way to curtail curtailment would be a massive explosion of energy storage. Ideally: batteries.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,220
There’s just one problem. Batteries are still way too expensive.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,060
Take a place like Texas. A quarter of the electricity from the Lone Star state comes from wind.

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,320
When the wind dies down, Texans just fire up a natural-gas power plant to make up the difference.

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,140
Battery prices would have to drop by half in order to compete with those Texan natural gas plants.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,620
Today, less than one tenth of one percent of the world’s electricity spends any time in a storage battery,

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,960
and even by 2040

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,440
the best forecasts say that batteries will make up just three percent of the world’s power supply.

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,800
But consider the experience curve.

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,840
Renewable energy is a technology, not a fuel, so prices follow what economists call an experience curve:

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,380
the more solar panels we make, the better we get at making them.

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,180
In fact, every time the number of panels in the world doubles, the cost to make them drops by 28 percent.

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,900
Solar power just recently became the cheapest electricity in the world, and it’s only going to get cheaper.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,740
And it turns out, the same thing is happening with batteries.

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,800
As we build more — with electric cars and electricity storage — the cost of batteries plummets.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,440
It's already dropped 80 percent in the last decade, and could do the same in the next.

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,920
Boom. At those prices, battery storage in a place like Texas suddenly becomes a no-brainer.

25
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,080
We’re already starting to see it happen in places where electricity is expensive.

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,380
In Hawaii, the rainforest island of Kauai swapped its fossil-fuel power for solar-plus-batteries,

27
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,840
And Tesla has made deals in California and Australia to install the world’s biggest battery fields.

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,920
The battery baron – Elon Musk  says his newly built, massively populated gigafactory

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,820
will spit out batteries ‘faster than bullets from a machine gun,’

30
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,940
It will single-handedly double the global supply.

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,160
And he wants to start building at least two more Gigafactories in 2018.

32
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,260
But Musk is in for an arms race.

33
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,280
Chinese companies say they’ll build capacity for about three gigafactories worth of batteries by 2021.

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,120
Samsung, LG Chem and others are also joining the fray.

35
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,100
Now, this is not a done deal.

36
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,840
If the battery revolution is going to work, tens of millions of people must

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
switch to electric cars over the next decade to feed the experience curve.

38
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,060
But there are also new technologies coming soon

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,220
like silicon anodes, solid state batteries, and lithium air that could skip us ahead on the experience curve

40
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:24,260
by more than a decade, making battery-powered trains, ships and even airplanes possible.

41
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,520
So, imagine a world where where city skies are clear of pollution, and where electricity is cheap and abundant.

42
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,900
It’s not crazy to assume that 20 years from now, over half the world’s power

43
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,860
will come from nature, backed by batteries.

44
00:03:38,140 --> 00:00:00,000
And it all might be happening sooner than you think.
