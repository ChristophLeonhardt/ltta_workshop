1
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:11,854
HOWIE: PRESIDENT TRUMP THROWING

00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:15,624
A BODY BLOCK AT LE BRON JAMES

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,626
AFTER THE NBA STAR SAID THIS.

4
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:20,362
>> IT'S A NEW SPORT TO DIVIDE.

5
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:22,465
THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T RELATE

6
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:22,731
TO.

7
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:26,602
HOWIE: TRUMP TWEETED LE BRON

8
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:29,972
JAMES WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE

9
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:33,642
DUMBEST MAN ON TELEVISION, DON

10
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:37,646
LEMON, BAN HE MADE LE BRON LOOK

11
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:39,582
SMART.

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:44,220
IS IT SMART TO BE BRAWLING WITH

13
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,855
AN NBA STAR?

14
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:47,756
MOLLIE: PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO SEE

15
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,391
THE PRESIDENT GO AFTER ATHLETES

16
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:52,328
AND THEY DON'T LIKE ATHLETES TO

17
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,329
GO AFTER THE PRESIDENT.

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,900
HE GAVE IT TO DON LEMON.

19
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,202
THE MEDIA AND SOME OF HIS

20
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,871
COLLEAGUES ONLY FOCUSED ON WHAT

21
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:05,741
HE SAID ABOUT LE BRON.

22
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:09,345
HOWIE: LE BRON SAYS WHO IS THE

23
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:14,817
REAL DUMMY, SOMEONE WHO PUTS

24
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:17,820
KIDS IN CAGES.

25
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,657
CAPRI: DON LEMON IS ALWAYS

26
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:23,692
RESISTING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP

27
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:25,895
EVERY NIGHT ON CNN.

28
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:31,934
TO TRUMP.

29
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:34,336
PEOPLE PRAISE DONALD TRUMP FOR

30
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:36,238
SAYING IF HE HAS HIS BACK UP

31
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,107
AGAINST THE WALL, HE'LL FIGHT

32
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:38,774
BACK.

33
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:42,211
THAT'S WHAT DON LEMON DID.

34
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:45,915
HOWIE: MELANIA TRUMP SAYS IT

35
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,217
LOOKS LIKE LE BRON JAMES IS

36
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:50,853
WORKING TO DO GOOD THINGS.

37
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:56,458
THE FIRST LADY ENCOURAGES THAT.

38
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:02,898
"NEW YORK TIMES" PUBLISHER A.G.

39
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:06,602
SULZBERGER HAS AN OFF-THE-RECORD

40
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:09,705
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

41
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:12,875
AND THEN SULZBERGER PUSHES BACK.

42
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:15,477
THE FACT THAT HE HAD THIS

43
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:17,980
MEETING DOES IT SUGGEST HE CARES

44
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:24,720
GILLIAN: THE MORE IMPORTANT

45
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:29,158
THING WITH THIS MEETING IS IT

46
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,327
UNDERSCORES WHAT I LOVE TO TALK.

47
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:33,729
WITH REGARD TO FOREIGN POLICY.

48
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,265
HE BELIEVES FERVENTLY IN THE

49
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,267
POWER OF HIS INTERPERSONAL

50
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:38,701
SKILLS.

51
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:43,439
IF HE CAN JUST GET THESE PEOPLE

52
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:55,651
HOWIE: I HAVE SEEN HIM DO THAT.

53
00:02:55,652 --> 00:03:00,289
SULD

54
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,325
DULDS BERGER SAID HE WARNED THAT

55
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:06,495
IT'S LEADING TO THREATS AGAINST

56
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:09,932
JOURNALISTS AND WILL LEAD TO

57
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:10,766
VIOLENCE.

58
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:14,169
>> THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS WITH

59
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:19,808
VIOLENCE, THE MEDIA NEEDS TO BE

60
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:22,845
THINKING ABOUT THEIR

61
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:23,979
INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC AGAINST

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,380
REPUBLICANS.

63
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:26,749
WE HAVE SEEN SHOOTINGS OF

64
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,717
CONGRESSMEN AND PEOPLE GETTING

65
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:29,251
ARRESTED.

66
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,686
I THINK PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE

67
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:32,888
FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS AND YOU

68
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,190
CAN'T BLAME THE RHETORIC.

69
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:37,326
HE SAYS DONALD TRUMP'S RHETORIC

70
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:40,429
IS DANGEROUS AND DIVISIVE.

71
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,567
THIS WEEK THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

72
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:48,804
HIRED SARAH JEONG AND NECESSITY

73
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:51,273
TESTIFIED IT AS IF IT'S NOT A

74
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:51,607
PROBLEM.

75
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:53,575
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT COMES BACK

76
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,444
WITH A SERIES OF TWEETS.

77
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:59,448
WHEN THE MEDIA DRIVEN INSANE BY

78
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,451
THEIR TRUMP DERANGEMENT

79
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,753
SYNDROME, IT PUTS THE LIVES OF

80
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:05,854
JOURNALISTS AT RISK.

81
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:10,125
VERY UNPATRIOTIC.

82
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,494
REVEALING THE SECRETS OF

83
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:14,596
GOVERNMENT HAS GONE ON SINCE THE

84
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:16,432
FOUNDING OF THE REPUBLIC.

85
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:20,869
CAPRI: I SUSPECT WE'LL CONTINUE

86
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,309
HIS TWEETS.

87
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,745
THE FACT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

88
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,346
THIS MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT

89
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:32,715
TRUMP AND THE NEW YORK TIMES.

90
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:35,884
WHO DO WE TRUST ANSWER WHO DO WE

91
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:39,555
BELIEVE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

92
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:40,856
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

93
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,691
STATES OR THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

94
00:04:42,692 --> 00:00:00,000
HOWIE: IF IT'S THE EPA OR HHS.
