1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,130
APPARENTLY NEARLY ONE IN
FIVE AMERICANS THINK THAT

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,740
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE IS MORALLY
CORRUPT.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,049
ACCORDING TO A POLL THAT
ASKED AMERICANS ABOUT THINGS

4
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,219
THAT THEY THOUGHT WERE
ACCEPTABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE,

5
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:24,929
ALMOST 20% OF AMERICANS SAY THAT
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE 

6
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:25,929
IS

7
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,189
UNACCEPTABLE.

8
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:36,079
NOW THERE IS A PARTY DIVIDE
THERE.

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,730
THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A
DIFFERENCE AMONG RESPONDENTS BY

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:50,739
RACE WHICH IS INTERESTING, BUT:

11
00:00:50,739 --> 00:01:26,400
LOTS 
OF INTERESTING THERE, BUT

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,660
IT 
IS INTERESTING, PEOPLE WHO

13
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,660
THOUGH

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,100
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE IS MORALLY
WRONG IS WAY HIGHER THAN I

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,100
THOUGHT.

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,570
I'VE SEEN THOSE RESULTS
IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IN

17
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,570
ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI WHERE 21
AND 29% THOUGHT, REPUBLICAN AND

18
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,300
VOTERS, THOUGHT INTERRACIAL
MARRIAGE SHOULD BE ILLEGAL, SO I

19
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,930
KNEW THAT IDEA EXISTED, I JUST
DID NOT KNOW IT WAS THIS LARGE

20
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,430
AND THEN, IS IT SURPRISING THAT
MORE REPUBLICANS THINK THAT?

21
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,960
OF COURSE NOT.

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,240
BUT 12% OF DEMOCRATS
WHO THINK THAT IT IS

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,480
MORALLY WRONG AND I AM GOING
AWAY BY THAT AND THEN WHEN

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,390
THEY SHOWED THE BREAKDOWN I WAS
LIKE ALL RIGHT, THAT IS AN

25
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,860
INTERESTING POINT, NOT ONLY
WHITES BUT BLACKS AND

26
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,330
LATINOS, SOME OF THEM THINK IT
IS MORALLY WRONG.

27
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,870
I AM DISHEARTENED BY THAT AS
WELL.

28
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,410
LOOK, EASY FOR ME TO SAY, I AM
IN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE AND I

29
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,140
HAVE BEEN A NONSTOP INTERRACIAL
RELATIONSHIPS AND I GREW UP

30
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,620
IN A MULTIRACIAL WORLD IN NEW
JERSEY AND SO I AM BLOWN AWAY BY

31
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,680
THE IDEA OF PEOPLE THINKING IF
IT IS A DIFFERENT RACE, YOU

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,062
SHOULD NOT BE IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THEM.

33
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:49,340
I LITERALLY CANNOT COMPREHEND
IT.

34
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,350
WHY?

35
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,930
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

36
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,240
ALSO YOU ARE A MORAL ATHEIST.

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,090
I THINK THE SMALL PARTS OF THE
OTHER RACES BELIEVE THAT ARE

38
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,490
ALSO SOME OF THE ONES THAT WILL
THINK, I DO NOT WANT NECESSARILY

39
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,060
WANT MY FAMILY MEMBER TO
MARRY SOMEONE OF ANOTHER

40
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,460
RACE THAT THEY THOUGHT HAVE
OPPRESSED THEM, SOME OF TIMES

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,050
THAT IS THE THING WITH THE
MINORITY.

42
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,640
YOU DON'T END UP IN A SITUATION
BECAUSE IT IS BAD FOR YOU, WHICH

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,950
ARE ALSO WRONG, BE WITH WHO
YOU WANT AND BE HAPPY BUT

44
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,020
THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS
I'M COMPLETELY GUESSING.

45
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,890
WHAT IS INTERESTING THOUGH,
THE THING THAT IS REALLY

46
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,560
SHIFTING THE MINDSET ABOUT
INTER-RACIAL RELATIONSHIPS

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,930
AND MARRIAGES IS ACTUALLY ONLINE
DATING APPS.

48
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:47,690
THAT 
IS ONE POSITIVE DEFINITELY

49
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,690
FROM DATING APPS.

50
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,430
I AM IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU,
I AM IN AN INTERRACIAL

51
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,150
RELATIONSHIP NOW AND I HAVE BEEN
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, AND SO

52
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,160
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME.

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,370
IT IS A LOGICAL, BUT I
UNDERSTAND.

54
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,930
IF YOU ARE IN ONE SOCIAL CIRCLE
AND NOTHING BEYOND THAT,

55
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,080
HOW YOU MIGHT BE CONFUSED, RAY?

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,600
YOU JUST MIGHT BE A LITTLE
CONFUSED.

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,860
I GET THAT THERE IS A GROUP
OF FOLKS WHO MIGHT THINK ALONG

58
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,450
THE LINES OF WHAT JR POSTULATED
THERE AND IT IS NOT LIKELY

59
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,600
HAVE NOT HEARD FOR EXAMPLE,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,970
SAYING BLACK GUYS SHOULD NOT GET
MARRIED TO WHITE WOMEN.

61
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,060
IT IS OUT THERE, SOME FOLKS DO
SAY THAT.

62
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,561
AGAIN, I DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT,
BUT OVERALL, IS IT MORE OF

63
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,150
A CONSERVATIVE THINK WESTERN
YES.

64
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,150
LOVING VERSUS VIRGINIA WAS ONLY
ABOUT 50 YEARS AGO.

65
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,660
UNTIL JUST 50 YEARS AGO BLACK
AND WHITE PEOPLE WERE NOT

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,600
ALLOWED TO GET MARRIED TO ONE
ANOTHER AND SOME OF OUR

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,550
STATES, SO DOES THE CULTURE
STILL REMAIN?

68
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,350
IT REMAINS SO MUCH SO THAT ONLY
20%

69
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,490
OF REPUBLICANS AND RIGHT-WING
REPUBLICANS THOUGHT THE

70
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,730
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE WAS EVEN A
GOOD THING.

71
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,220
ONLY 28%.

72
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,530
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS I GUESS.

73
00:05:06,530 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT VERY SLOWLY.
