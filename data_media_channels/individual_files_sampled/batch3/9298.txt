IF YOU ILLEGALLY ENTER OUR COUNTRY, YOU WILL BE REFERRED FOR PROSECUTION. IF YOU FILE A FALSE CLAIMS, YOU WILL BE PROSECUTED. IF YOU AID AND ABET, YOU WILL BE REFERRED OR THE PROSECUTION. Neil: ALL RIGHT. KIRSTJEN NIELSEN DOUBLING DOWN ON THE WARNING TO A CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS ARRIVING AT THE BORDER SOMETIME THIS WEEK, WE DON'T KNOW WHEN. WE KNOW A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT MEXICANS. THEY'RE HONDURANS. WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO AT THE QUARTER OR WHETHER THEY PLAN TO CAUSE TROUBLE OR IF THERE'S OTHERS BEHIND THEM. THERE'S RECORD THERE ARE. OR WHETHER THIS WILL BE MADE A BIG DEAL TO STEP UP A NATIONAL GUARD PRESENCE THERE. THIS NEXT FELLOW IS ON TOP OF IT. THIS DAVID WHORTER JOINS ME. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK. Neil: WHAT WILL HAPPEN? THEY GET THERE LET'S SAY TOMORROW, SATURDAY. THEN WHAT? IT ALL DEPENDS WHERE THEY COME FROM. IF THEY COME FROM THE PORT OF ENTRY, THE INSPECTORS THERE WILL PROBABLY TURN THEM AROUND AND HAVE THEM GO BACK SOUTH. IF THEY PERSIST, THEY'LL BE REFERRED TO AN ASYLUM OFFICER. WHAT I'M AFRAID OF, THEY'LL BE GOING BACKS INTO MEXICO AND DO AN END AROUND AROUND COMING ACROSS THE BORDER AROUND TURN THEMSELVES OVER TO THE BORDER PATROL WHO WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR PORSCHES THEIR PORSCHE THEIR POSTCHE THEIR POST,HE THEIR POST, P THEIR POST, PRO THEIR POST, PROCE THEIR POST, PROCESS THEIR POST, PROCESS TH THEIR POST, PROCESS THEM THEIR POST, PROCESS THEM, OPENING UP THE BORDER FOR THE CARTELS TO EXPLOIT WITH DRUGS AND WHATEVER ELSE COMES ACROSS. THE OTHER THING WITH THIS MIGRANT GROUP, IT'S A CONCERTED EFFORT BY AN ANTI BORDER, ANTI-SOVEREIGNTY GROUP OUT OF CALIFORNIA WHO IS ORCHESTRATED THIS ENTIRE THING AND THEY HAVE DONE IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WHY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PROSECUTED AT THIS POINT IS BEYOND ME. THEY CAN BE PROSECUTED. THEY NEED TO BE FOR ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN. Neil: WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND, AND I KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN INTO THIS, I'M TOLD THAT CARAVAN IS THE WORD OF CHOICE. WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, LARGE GROUPS OF ILLEGALS MOVING THROUGH MEXICO AND GETTING TO THE BORDER THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL. WHAT IS SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL HERE, THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT SORT OF PAVING THE WAY FOR THEM. I DON'T KNOW WHO TO BELIEVE ON THIS. I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS THAT A LOT OF THESE HONDURAN ILLEGALS HAVE VERY LITTLE DIFFICULTY GETTING INTO MEXICO AND EVEN LESS GETTING TO THIS POINT NOW. IS THAT TRUE? IT IS TRUE. MEXICO ALLEGEDLY IS A DEMOCRACY IN WHICH THESE ALIENTS COULD TURN THEMSELVES OVER FOR THAT ASYLUM TO MEXICO ITSELF. MOST OF THESE GROUPS OUT OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND SOME OF THEM ARE COMING FROM OVERSEAS FROM PROBABLY THE MIDDLE EAST OR WHATEVER, WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS ALL IN THIS GROUP. Neil: ALL RIGHT. A LOT OF THEM ARE INFILTRATED BY CARTEL MEMBERS, MS-13, SPECIAL INTEREST COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
