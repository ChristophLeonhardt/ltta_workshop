GOOD EVENING. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT. RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, WE HAVE A RARE FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT FROM THE CENTER OF MAYBE THE GREATEST SCANDAL IN MODERN POLITICAL HISTORY, THE FBI SPYING ON THE 2016 TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS. OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AND THEIR DO YOU TELLIFUL LACKEYS IN THE PRESS DENIED THAT HAPPENED. NOW WE DO KNOW THAT IT HAPPENED. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION USED GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO SURVEY A RIVAL CAMPAIGN. THERE'S NO DENYING THAT. SO INSTEAD THE USUAL APOLOGISTS ARE CLAIMING IT WAS A GOOD THING, IN FACT, SPYING ON TRUMP TO PROTECT HIM. BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. EVEN ASKING QUESTIONS, A SIGN OF DISLOYALTY, SHUT UP AND OBEY. NO THANKS. TONIGHT WE HAVE A DIRECT ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED, THE FIRST FULL INTERVIEW WITH A TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL APPARENTLY TARGETED BY AN FBI SPY. TIM CLOVIS WAS A FORMER NATIONAL CO-CHAIRMAN OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. IN 2016, HE HAD A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH A MAN BELIEVED TO BE WITH ONE OF THE FBI SPIES ON THAT CAMPAIGN. SAM CLOVIS JOINS US. THANKS FOR COMING ON. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. YOU BELIEVE YOU HAD A FACE-TO-FACE ENCOUNTER. DESCRIBE THAT MEETING. SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THE SEPTEMBER 1st MEETING I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE EMAILS FROM STEVEN HALPER, SAYING HE KNEW CARTER PAGE, AND ASKED FOR A SIT-DOWN WITH ME. HE WANTED TO COME IN AND DISCUSS FOREIGN POLICY AND TO PROVIDE SOME WHAT HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE HIS SOME OF HIS WRITINGS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE, HELP US, IN THE CAMPAIGN. I ARRANGED THAT MEETING. WE HAD THAT MEETING IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON THE 1st OF SEPTEMBER. IT LASTED ABOUT AN HOUR. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS OVER COFFEE WITH HIM HIS RESEARCH, AND IT WAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON CHINA. THEN I THINK AFTER THAT MEETING, AND THEN ON THE 27th OF SEPTEMBER I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM HIM WITH SEVERAL ATTACHMENTS. I CAN BE HONEST WITH YOU, TUCKER, I HAVEN'T EVEN OPENED THOSE ATTACHMENTS TO THIS DAY. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WAS IN THEM, BUT MOSTLY PAPERS TITLED THAT DEALT WITH CHINA. I THINK HE USED MY MEETING AS A USING MY MEETING AS A BONA FIDE WITH GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, TO HAVE A MEETING WITH HIM, THAT I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT, THAT WAS SUBSEQUENT TO MY MEETING WITH HIM ON THE 1st OF SEPTEMBER. SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM BEFORE? HE EMAILED YOU COLD? NO, I DID NOT. I JUST GOT THE EMAIL THAT ASKED FOR THE MEETING, AND HE USED THE FACT THAT HE KNEW CARTER PAGE. RIGHT. OF COURSE CARTER HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CAMPAIGN. AT WHAT POINT DID YOU BEGIN TO SUSPECT HE WAS WORKING FOR THE FBI, SEEKING TO GATHER INFORMATION SURREPTITIOUSLY ON THE CAMPAIGN? WELL, OUR MEETING WAS LIKE TWO FACULTY MEMBERS IN THE FACULTY LOUNGE. I DIDN'T THINK ANY OF IT UNTIL I STARTED TO SEE THE REPORTING THAT CAME OUT RECENTLY. THEN I STARTED TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. THEN IT MADE SENSE TO ME THAT HE WAS PROBING TO FIND A WEAK SPOT IN OUR CAMPAIGN, SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE VULNERABLE TO CONNECTING THINGS BACK TO THOSE ELUSIVE 30,000 EMAILS THAT SUPPOSEDLY THE RUSSIANS HAD. I REALLY THINK THAT'S WHAT HIS TASK WAS, WAS TO CREATE AN AUDIT TRAIL BACK TO THOSE EMAILS FROM SOMEONE IN THE CAMPAIGN OR SOMEONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAMPAIGN SO THAT THEY COULD DEVELOP A STRONGER CASE FOR PROBABLE CAUSE TO CONTINUE TO ISSUE WARRANTS AND TO FURTHER AN INVESTIGATION. I REALLY FELT AFTER HEARING ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS, LISTENING TO THE REPORTS THAT I'VE READ, THAT THIS TRULY WAS AN EFFORT TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT DID NOT EXIST. I REALLY THINK THAT WAS WHAT HIS MISSION WAS. WHY HAVEN'T YOU READ THE ATTACHMENTS TO HIS EMAILS? WELL, ONE, I WAS BUSY. I WORKED 16-20 HOURS A DAY. WE ALREADY HAD A LOT OF HELP ON FOREIGN POLICY IN AREAS OF CHINA. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANYTHING. FRANKLY, I'VE GONE BACK AND REVIEWED ALL MY EMAILS. I DIDN'T REPORT THAT MEETING TO ANYONE IN THE CAMPAIGN, SO THE MEETING WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ME AS FAR AS ANYTHING YOU COULD REMEMBER. I'VE LOOKED THROUGH ALL OF MY PERSONAL EMAILS, EVERYTHING, AND I CAN'T FIND A RECORD OF IT AT ALL. INTERESTING. THAT MEETING MAY HAVE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN A MUCH LARGER STORY. SAM, THANK YOU FOR THAT ACCOUNT.
