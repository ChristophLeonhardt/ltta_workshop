A GROUP
OF NEARLY 200 DEMOCRATIC
LAWMAKERS HAVE FILED A LAWSUIT
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP ALLEGING
THAT HE IS VIOLATING A
CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION BY
ACCEPTING PAYMENTS FROM FOREIGN
GOVERNMENTS.
WE HAVE BEEN
COVERING THOSE PAYMENTS SINCE
THE INAUGURATION, BUT NOW THE
LEGAL REPERCUSSIONS.
THIS IS THE
FIRST TO HAVE 200 LAWMAKERS.
IN
CASE YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH
THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE BECAUSE
YOU 
ARE A REGULAR PERSON: IT'S
BASED ON THIS RIDICULOUS NOTION
THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT BE
GETTING BRIBED BY FOREIGN
DIGNITARIES.
WEIRDOS.
IT IS A
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD LEVELED WITH
MONEY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT A COUPLE
OF THE THINGS THAT COULD
INDICATE THAT HE HAS VIOLATED
THIS CLAUSE.
BUT YOU DON'T GET
AS MUCH BANG FOR YOUR BUCK GOING
TO 
THE RITZ.
THIS IS SOMETHING
ABBY ALLUDED TO EARLIER ñ THAT
IS ONE TRADEMARK, THERE HAVE
BEEN DOZENS GIVEN TO THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION SINCE THEN.
WE
CAN'T SAY IN ALL OF THOSE CASES
THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN
THEM OTHERWISE, BUT IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT WAS INVOLVED IN
IT.
THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEGAL
CASES AGAINST HIM AROUND THE
SAME TOPIC.
THE DIFFERENCE IS
NOT EVERY GROUP HAS THE SAME
STANDING TO CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE
BEEN DAMAGED BY HIM RECEIVING
THESE FOREIGN PAYMENTS.
IT'S
INTERESTING THE WAY THE
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ARE CLAIMING
THAT.
IN THAT DESCRIPTION I GAVE
YOU IT SAYS THAT CONGRESS CAN
GIVE HIM PERMISSION TO ACCEPT
PAYMENTS, BUT IN ALL THESE CASES
THEY WERE NOT ADVISED, WHICH
THEORETICALLY HARMS THEM.
I'M CURIOUS HOW THIS WILL PLAY
OUT AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS
CONSIDERED SOME SORT OF
RIDICULOUS LOOPHOLE BECAUSE IT'S
NOT DIRECT PAYMENTS AND IT IS A
PAYMENT THROUGH HIS BUSINESSES
AND BUSINESS ENTITIES, WHICH HE
CLAIMED HE WAS GOING TO STEP
BACK FROM BUT HE NEVER REALLY
DID.
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A
LOOPHOLE.
I FEEL AS THOUGH THIS
WILL NOT MATERIALIZE INTO
ANYTHING BECAUSE TRUMP SEEMS TO
BE A LITTLE UNTOUCHABLE.
IT
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH NEPOTISM
IS INVOLVED IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
PEOPLE SEEM TO CONTINUOUSLY GIVE
HIM A PASS.
ANY TYPE OF ACTION
AGAINST HIM IS SEEN AS A
POLITICAL MOVE AS OPPOSED TO A
MOVE THAT IS MEANT TO HELP
PROTECT AND HELP THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
I DO SEE IT AS A PROBLEM
WHEN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ARE
ESSENTIALLY USING THEIR
FINANCIAL POWER TO SWAY HIM
IN ANY WHICH WAY.
SWAP DRAINED.
I THINK IT IS
SYMBOLIC.
ALSO THE IMPEACHMENT,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MAJORITY TO
PUSH THIS THROUGH.
THIS ALSO
GOES BACK TO THE HORRIBLE
MESSAGING OF THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
YOU ARE FOCUSING ON
SOMETHING THAT AMERICANS DON'T
REALLY CARE ABOUT.
THEY HAVE
PROVEN THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
TAX RETURNS AND THE FACT THAT
TRUMP IS A BONA FIDE BRAND THAT
HAS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ALL
OVER THE FUCKING WORLD.
THEY
VOTED FOR HIM FOR PRESIDENT.
I
NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD HOW HE
WAS LEGALLY ABLE TO RUN.
THIS IS
A LITTLE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE TO
TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
I AGREE PEOPLE SEEM INCREDIBLY
WILLING TO FORGIVE ANYTHING.
BUT
NOW THAT HE IS THE PRESIDENT I
DO THINK IN SOME CASES ñ YOU CAN
PUT TOGETHER AND ADD THAT
INVOLVES FOREIGN BRIBERY.
I DO
THINK AMERICANS ARE A XENOPHOBIC
COUNTRY.
AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
SORT OF THING WILL TRIGGER AN
IDEA THAT I DON'T REALLY LIKE
HIM BEING INFLUENCED BY THE
SAUDI'S.
ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
