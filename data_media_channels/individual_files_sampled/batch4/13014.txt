the blazes conservative millennial Ally Stuckey joins in studio to discuss the whiniest generation there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth then dr. Bickley and Emily Butler joined the panel of deplorable z' to discuss Republican propaganda my favorite Jimmy Kimmel's latest humorless hacking for Democrats and meat-eating vegetarians on Michael Knowles and this is the Michael nul show my cup it runneth over my leftist tears mug it runneth over this week yesterday you saw we had Roman come in we had we had what my first day with roaming and today back to back we're joined by Allie Stuckey all the way from Texas in the studio so we have to talk you I think you are the foremost expert on whiny snowflakes this is true my way officially you know I am in in a previous life I've been an actor I've been in numerous terrible indie movies nobody's seen except at 3:00 in the morning on cable you you are teaching me things about the art of method acting I'll show the latest clip of Ali's duckie so I just graduated from college last week and Harvard actually and I started my new job on Monday so obviously on Sunday night I wanted to go out with my friends and celebrate um it was a late night so Monday morning first day I rolled in around 10:30 set up my desk and my boss my white male boss had the audacity to come up to me and say where have you been where have I been well I've been celebrating and I've been partying and then I've been sleeping and I've been resting because you know what this is a stressful time and you know what I feel a little bit pressured and a little bit endangered right now I do not feel safe so I'll just leave and come back when you've changed your tune mr. white male boss and you know what he said to me he said you could pack up your stuff and go and I said what did you just say to me I can pack up my stuff and go I'm fired just because I was late on my first day to work because I'm not doing anything are you kidding me I mean talk about sexism this is the white male pager I can't work right here talk about discrimination so now it's Tuesday I'm back I've got my protesting signs in the trunk and I'm gonna show them who's boss and I am going to show them that this millennial generation is not taking that crap from baby virgin Xers okay we're gonna do whatever we want to and if we can't do that and if we don't feel safe then we're just gonna quit and that is a real threat give this woman an Oscar somebody get that was the most incredible performance not just of a millennial but the most incredible performance I've seen in years yeah you know I appreciate it was absolutely the words I feel endangered I feel unsafe but it really I'm not being facetious in any way you nail so many points for getting to well thank you yeah the craziness now by the way just maybe people who are listening or watching don't believe me here is a clip from my own dear beleaguered alma mater Yale from just two years ago here's a clip of an actual alright goodbye everybody I can't show after watching that but by the way just for the record that Yale student was girl named Jarrell and Luther and she who asked who the eff hired you she was on the committee that gave him his position she was a student on the committee that hired him just a little bit of fun I would have loved if he had just answered her and said well actually it was you watching that I actually do think maybe you need to up the hysteria in your own satirical but I have to ask you channeling the movie as good as it gets yeah how do you play Millennials so well okay this is my tried and true method you can adopt it if you want to for the next time you audition for an indie film so I I turn on the news I hear something I see a clip like this and I'm like wow this is this is really happening for some reason I always get in my car I don't know why I get in my car and I say okay let me like channel these people let me make sure that my brain turns to mush because it's a safe yes and tried to dial back my and what's that called EQ emotional intelligence back to like age 12 11 or something like that and then I just kind of go from there really I just turned on my camera and I start talking I don't like write it out or anything that's how easy it is because it mirrors reality so closely that's probably why the majority of people that watch them think that I'm serious do they they actually they can't tell the satire from the reality no no they can't they just blow right past the fact that it's called the conservative millennial and they just start typing away but that's just internet trolls for you this raises a real question that I have for the culture at this moment especially this generation are they beyond satire have they transcended parody to the point that the they have so embraced the absurd that it can't be funny anymore yeah you call the absurd to an absurd person it nothing rings funny there's no standard anymore right it's just sad we were talking about this earlier if you live in irony is anything really ironic anymore or is it just reality when do we lose sight of what's R&E and what's not I love irony that's probably more what this is and satire I just like playing upon the ridiculousness of the irony in which they live unknowingly but unfortunately so many people live in that space that it is very hard to distinguish between what's true and what's not but that's okay I think that's all the more reason to do it so people hear the absurdity and the logic at the core of their argument so they can say well is that really what I sound like and but do they hear it is there these millennia I mean we could do we could do the show every day about how insane this generation of people is yeah basically we do that anyway but do they do we give them in any way a bad rap like what is causing it on the one hand it's hilarious it's great to laugh at this chick at Yale who's screeching in her betters face but on the other hand it's really sad it's sad to see ignorant students right saying we don't want to learn anything we think that we know the whole world and we're going to inveigh against you and get you fired yeah well unfortunately it's kind of a long history lesson I think I think it goes back to our parents and the generation before that and then the generation before that I think the further my personal theory is the further we get away from the Great Depression and the Great War is the further we are or the closer we are to entitlement the further we are away from hard work and really understanding what it means to work hard for the for a dollar and what the value of the dollar is and not having the privilege of having helicopter parents and parents that convince you that you are special no matter what honorable mentions trophy participation trophy all those things are relatively new and we didn't choose them unfortunately our parents did and so I can't say of course it's such like a millennial to kind of shift responsibility but it's not all of our fault ability it's mom and dad's fault but really I mean that's part of it and so and then of course the last eight years of Barack Obama's presidency certainly didn't help that if we were predisposed to being entitled certainly everything that Obama stood for I think conditioned that even further and that was evidenced by the fact that Bernie Sanders received more votes from Millennials than Trump and Clinton did combined so it just kind of feeds into our predisposition for wanting free stuff and thinking that we deserve not just material things but also to be intellectually coddled that the world that the world is fair that the world owes you something but how is it this brings up two questions not all of us are insane not all of us have lost our minds babe we're gonna we're gonna go on and save America but really I mean there is this young right-wing movement that does cut through this craziness so is it that soft times can't make great men you know that you really you're a product of your times is there any way to cut through that and and then we'll have to talk about Texas in California but is there how do we rise above it when we grew up in basically a luxurious time yeah um I think probably the first thing that I always advise Millennials and especially college students to do which by the way I found out for the first time when I was speaking out of college - the other day I was talking about Millennials and you know entitlement everything we're talking about and this little old guy raised his hand and he was like oh by the way we're actually not Millennials we're Generation Z and I realized for the first time that I'm old but anyway how to break through that I mean I always tell the first the first thing I tell people is to read just read I mean our parents read so much more than we ever did all we do is scroll through our ideological echo chambers made possible by a Facebook algorithm but you know what I always say I'm sorry to contradict you Ali I always say to watch a lot of podcasts watch the podcasts send them to your friends particularly young people you bring a lot of young people on anyway that's just my two cents but you think we should read books I do I do think we get we can read books but there are other ways so if you're not a reader if you don't like to read you can also listen a podcast for example I listen to this podcast I also listen to liberal podcasts I listen to pods of America I love I love the liberal podcasts pod save America they they are maybe it's it's not proper etiquette to talk badly about people on the left doing podcasts it's terrible I mean they're so tired I listen to pods of America I'm like okay got it got the snowflake down my fiance√© sweet little Lisa turns me on to this she said like I listened to all of your shows so I wanted to listen to some left-wing there are no arguments it's just exasperation yes swear words and exasperation there's and there's more ways my favorites yeah so I think it takes more effort probably than it used to to break out of our ideological echo chamber simply because everything that has been made convenient to us in the form of you know social media and information that we get from social media it's tailored to what we already think and so because of that especially if you are on the left and all you're going to get is someone that bolsters your bias and if that's the case then feelings of entitlement and everything that we've just been talking about is only going to increase so what I encourage people to do people like you and me who are just terribly logical it's because we do break out of those echo chambers and we allow ourselves to be intellectually chat yeah intellectually challenged that kind of sounds like that's a bad thing but intellectually I guess what am I trying to say just help me to edify edified I know I just like you I'm very often overwhelmed by the strength of my own logic it's really it's the weight of glory is what it is right I feel a great weight of glory no I agree with you obviously it you need a curiosity and people who think the world owes them something often aren't that curious now this brings me to my as my sales pitch to you is that you you're in Texas yes there are a lot of great outlets like the blaze into Steve graders in Texas a lot of people are there I've never lived in a conservative place in my whole life I've only lived in New York I lived in New Haven and very liberal campus Los Angeles is it better for conservatives to live in red states or blue states or should we be surrounded by people with whom we agree or people who are absolutely out of their minds that's a really good question well I just fear for you people better over here yeah yes that y'all are gonna end up betraying us because see in Texas I'm around so many other conservatives that when the rest of the world is going crazy we're like okay this secession thing like are we gonna do it and we can kind of bond over that kind of stuff um y'all are kind of you know y'all are isolated so I just fear for you guys that y'all are gonna end up going off the deep end peer pressured into liberalism the other fear for our lives is that you know every time Steve Reder gets jihad in Texas right he can go reach for one of the 7,000 guns within arm's length yes here it's much more difficult I don't know even how y'all deal with that that's that's my biggest worry that it is true yeah it's really hard I think in California now it's illegal to possess even one round of ammo you can only have 0 round magazines and your guidance perfect yes we're gonna figure out a workaround for it hopefully I think that's my next satire video excellent there there we go I'll take a story credit because I've always I've liked being in left-wing places because it has totally you have to defend your views that's that's a really good point you become an apologist for conservatism you have yeah I mean I think Yale I totally see your fear I think most normal people go to Yale and then 97% of them become left-wing automatons but there's this great 3% that come out like more reactionary than Genghis Khan you know you come out just yeah absolutely I mean probably too far you know yeah but that you just react against it yeah and I think that's really important I think that you set a great example for the rest of us Millennials whether you're whether you're on the right or the left do you make absolutely a good point that we all should become apologists for our beliefs and I don't necessarily have to do that quite as much when I work at the blaze and live in Texas I went to school in South Carolina and then I lived in Georgia so I'm just like bouncing around to the red states this is interesting too though and I we have a game we have to get to this is I've been planning this out all morning this is I think it's the hardest game it's harder than chess or go that that Chinese game but we'll get to that in one second because I feel I see your point a lot of times people who grow up with an idea they rebel against it they get bored with it they don't it's easy to fall away the easiest way to find an ex-catholic is to see who went to Catholic school and then they always end up becoming atheists afterward because they don't like the nuns you've always been a conservative yes Christian I have yes I have I grew up a conservative Christian we grew up watching Fox News my dad's actually a politician in Texas so I know it sounds like I didn't have much of a choice they brainwashed me from an early but you didn't labelled no well I know I didn't rebel actually I would say in college my ideas strengthened even further even from a faith standpoint and from a political standpoint I didn't actually get into politics until a couple years after college when I looked around and realized that all of my very well-informed and well-educated friends just had no idea what was going on in the world and how it really to them which is why I berth to the conservative millennial and started making videos mostly for my friends and then it took off immediately and you were picked up by the place like not really not immediately it took it took a little bit but yeah I didn't take very long and now I'm on the Michael Noel's shows I'm just the peak it's all downhill from here Ali as well do you think because I asked this question a lot I always get this in the mailbag how much does the Jesus matter to the conservatism I think it was a friend of mine Elena plot once described conservatism as Jesus guns and capitalism how important is a Christianity or a belief in God to this huge generation of nuns people who grew up without religion how important is the religion to conservative policy yeah well I think that conservatism is it is necessarily a little bit subjective and so it kind of depends on what exactly you feel is most important to conserve I certainly don't think it's absolutely necessary to be Christian or even to believe in God to believe that the Constitution is inherently good and that it's a good foundation upon which we should be building our country I don't think necessarily you have to believe in a higher power to do that I think it absolutely helps I think it helps to say this is where my moral compass comes from because Jesus told me that I am supposed to love others the way that I love myself I can always go back to that and so yes it kind of I guess makes it easier in a way or they go hand in hand very well because say you don't have a faith at all it very easily to me goes into the direction of saying well why would you have to care about anyone except for you know survival of the fittest so for me they go hand in hand very well however I have a very good friend who is an atheist who doesn't believe in any way that you need a religion to be a great person or to be a conservative and it works for him so I certainly can't tell him that he's not a true conservative at least in the secular sense simply because he doesn't believe me you might yeah he might be a conservative but he might Andrew Klavan always says you can be a conservative and an atheist you just can't make sense and so it might well be the case that a conservative thinks well life liberty and property are pretty good things too to call natural rights and they might believe that and they might want to promote that and that that's all well and good by me right but they might not understand why those are natural right and what I would say to that as well and what I have told my atheist friend is that by holding on to those things without the foundation or without God being the foundation of those things you still have a faith you were just saying that you don't believe in these in anything but you actually have a faith in that and you have a faith in what our Constitution says you're just choosing to not put your faith in God but you still have a face that's a good point hopefully it won't be ripped up like the bad seeds that fall on the side of the road a warning to you atheist conservatives well parables how about that okay we're getting too serious we're getting into parables and mustard seeds so now we have to get to this game basically this is I call this game I've passed you out little cards you'll notice the cards say under 10 or over 20 the purpose of this game is to I'm gonna have Marshall read out a quote and the quote was either said by a millennial or an adult or some whiny adult or a toddler or a young child so it's gonna be you have to guess based on just the quote whether the person is under 10 or over 20 for this we're going to have to bring on our other two panelists we have Emily Butler and we have dr. Bickley the doctor himself the 8,000 d LOL absolutely thank you for joining us get ready this is a very important game the points really really matter all right is everybody ready for the questions I am ready Marshall shoot when you're clear there we go the first quote in my heart I'm still little I could have heard that a Yale over 20 okay that is a nine year old named did we all we all said over 20 whoa you are got tripped up whoa you're treating me like I'm a child you're yeah there's an obvious answer that's right under 10 under 10 you're treating me like I'm a child under 10 the answer is 21 year old Cora Miriam quickly puffs that that is a trick question that was trig leap up all right who did anyone happen who had it the doctor of course the doctor had it okay right next question next one quote sometimes I like to listen to Taylor Swift in my room and cry about cats that have died fame that's gotta be is definitely from tumblr over 28 year old god no I'm just kidding it's it is it which is it that's an eight year older it's old it's an eight year old Bickley I don't trust the rest I really got it okay one for Emily to four-bit lay the doctors lading okay next quote mom dad you need to help me oh come on yeah we're all saying over 20 it is in fact over 20 that is for your old sign I don't resist protest pathetic okay so we all go to that one next one all right never resist adulthood I really being human but some days I really wish I could just be a fairy that's how always I'm gonna say under 10 I don't think is a woman or a girl named Emily at 4 years old hey all right all right so none for Emily we got really depressing the next one is quote can I wear a bear costume at your wedding as I'm the ring bearer I am a werewolf I'm alright you go on right back at it I feel like this is a trick this is 28 year old other candidate named Riviera so who got that I get that I got it you know you don't recognize other kin when you hear it so in other kin for did you say over 22 yeah okay I have to put that so please other kin is a one of the 56 genders that now exists according to Facebook and probably every university in the country and other kin is it's like a trans species but not a real species like a fake species so like I think I'm like a werewolf I think I'm gonna hell yeah there was that well that's there that's a different thing I think they're also furries it gets very free yeah we'll get into that later I'm sorry keep going Marshall okay next one is I am made of gold treat me like it I'm gonna go on your 10 millennia all right the answer is that is a 20-something woman's sign at the woman's March rally in Washington DC is are you tonight I like that line I tell myself that in the mirror every morning I would have a poster of that on the wall I am gold alright the next one is quote it's about creating a home here isn't gimme but it's really sad than it's a gimme is Geralyn right that is Geralyn Luger a Yale undergraduate Michael's old best friend yeah that's that is that's my old my old professor Gerald Luthor coming at you quote Donald Trump is a bad man what do you say that for he just is Donald Trump is a bad man what do you say of where he just gives given that logical progression I'm gonna say over 20 I'm gonna this is Kylie six years old but I lost my lead yeah Lee got it let's see who's know ok so right now the doctor doctor Bickley and Ally are tied Oh all right let's break that tie with the next quote I don't vote I don't do no moaning yes under 10 this is famous rapper and Coachella headliner Kendrick Lamar right oh sorry quadric Donald Trump hates brown people I'll say over 20 right I could see some sunlight College person saying that whoever votes in oh yeah that's your final answer okay sure this is Chelsea Handler 42 years old LSP and ler Ali the only one not together we all knew I didn't know his handler though okay Chelsea all right next one close one I know Trump hates brown people that's the same quote I know Trump people with brown skin that's still the same is that is a different quote this is a different quote this is trying five years old it's hard to hold on I guess we had the Bickley was picking up on her system I would have missed it yeah we're tied all right guys next one quote if Donald Trump becomes president I'm gonna be super super mad and I'll move to a different world I don't know i'm actually getting nervous about this now i yeah it could have been like any celebrity I guess overt we all say over 20 okay this is it Blake five years old it's really sad that we can't differentiate it this is really sad none of us guys the last quote okay all right so by the way so right now Ali and the doctor are tied this is the type quote if he would it be elected I'm moving to Jupiter also also basically the same quote I'm gonna go under ten couple this is Sharon age 1410 just share it's sure you got it oh you both all right let's get out so Emily and I lost there's a tie between the good doctor Bickley and Ally but you know what none of that matters because there are no winners and losers here at the Michael Knowles show there are only participation trophies thank you all for participating I feel like we're all number one don't you feel like we're just all I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be this is not about an intellectual space it's about creating a home here that's what that's gonna be the morrow of my show okay panel thank you all for coming on we have got to stupid we've got to get to the important news of the day that was the news to me of the day that was the most important news to me now before we get to all of this important news about Republican propaganda and Jimmy Kimmel's craziness and meat-eating vegetarians and shrieking women who are being mean to veterans we have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I know you want to watch more we have Allie Stuckey in studio best day ever but in order to do that you have to go to daily wire calm you have to pay $10 per month $100 per year has nothing you know what you get for all that you get me you get the Andrew Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show I know what you're thinking so what so what this is what the left is tears tumblr this it is the perfect vessel for all of the leftist tears and they are flowing day by day I actually have a beautiful Jimmy Kimmel vintage 2017 in here right now it is absolutely indestructible it's made of crushed up steven crowder mugs that have been consolidated into I think titanium I think that's how titanium is made so go over to daily wire comm right now we'll be right back panel MSNBC is now reporting that quote Republican propaganda efforts reach new alarming level they're referring to a piece that's out in the AP that shows that the Republican Governors Association now has a website the Republican Governors Association is publishing a website it's called the free telegraph and it publishes stories that the Republican Governors Association wants you to hear this is obviously alarming because now Republicans have a very tiny media outlet dr. Begley as an expert what is your take on partisan media throughout American history as a doctor I feel it a millennial vaguely bad about it mm-hmm but I feel that this you know the story I looked at the MSNBC report on it which is more hyperbolic than the AAP even which is and the the sense of like there's no self-awareness with these media outlets about the absolute monopoly they have on all the major outlets the print TV overt bias even all of their reporting and they're really outraged about it and there's there's one thing that I'll give them that I think is actually legitimate I do think initially the Governors Association should have made it very clear they were actually sponsoring it they didn't for a second ap called them out they put that at the bottom of the website II with that disclosure great whatever bring it on you know what they're not asking and they won't ever ask this is why did they feel than this necessity to actually create this thing there's a reason right this there's no Democrats creating this they don't have to so they're not going to look at it like that they're gonna have the sensational headlines and the other self-awareness of MSNBC reporting on AP reporting on this yeah oh there's the echo chamber there's the echo chamber there was that study that came out that 93% of mainstream reporting about Donald Trump has been negative compared to reporting in the 40s about Obama and in the 50s about Bush there is this huge bias in the media but all of this is even relatively recent the there were always partisan media outlets in the United States there was the Tennessee Democrat there was the Oklahoma Republican and then starting after World War two we started to have the so-called objective journalist outlets Ali you're a journalist you do real news and fake news what what happened was there ever really an objective media moment in the United States I do think that it's hard to deny that we've become in our journalism increasingly biased especially when we don't have all of the facts of the story case in point Russia it's been reported as fact for probably over a year now and yet we don't even now after a year of reporting have nearly enough facts to be able to say that he is guilty that Trump is guilty of fresh collusion and yet it's been reported as fact I don't think that used to be the case I do think that in yesteryear it used to be let us gather all the facts that we have and then let us come to that conclusion but rather we start with the conclusion and then we back up from there and I think that's where it gets dangerous I do agree it's much clearer now we can clearly see which we know that MSNBC is left-leaning they say it they say lean forward on their commercials and we know that the free Telegraph is sponsored by the RGA but I'm even reminded of Walter Cronkite the so-called most trusted man in America he unilaterally conceded the Vietnam War he said the word was lost when the war was not lost so maybe it's clearer now but I think it I think was always there and just maybe more insidious Emily do you think that we need an objective media or should we just have the right in the left and the Republican and the Democrat press shops fighting with one another and we piece them together and get all the facts how do you even go about getting an unbiased media source there is no unbiased media so how would you even make one yeah we're all people we all have our own biases we're all I'm gonna write it or at least our own point of view at least our own point of view and I think that the burden is much less on media outlets first of all I think it was very funny that they called the free Telegraph like masquerading as news because I mean let's look on Vice yes any documentary that pretends to be informative even though it was like little Vox bubble videos they do or they're educating you and they're informing you it's explanatory journalism what kind of other journalism is there by the way journalism is supposed to be explanatory to know that climate change from Vox has educated me that climate change is actually the cause of the Syrian conflict hmm but they've read your attitude yeah so you know woke Emily I read in via woke you are it's it's tough it's not easy being this well but I think that first of all the lines are blurred as to what is news and what is media you know it's all information it's all biased there's no way we can come up with an unpardonable we can only make our biases clear and secondly the burden is the burden is on the reader the burden is on the absorber of information to go back and understand what that is I was listening to an NPR clip a long time ago that live on NPR the reporter said that Trayvon Martin was shot by a white man Oh white Hispanic man yeah you know that white Hispanic man there's no there's no way to like report that there's no way to like say you know George Zimmerman was not I couldn't call in you know it's up to us to know what the research is to do it on our own and to avoid fake news sites like the Washington Post in The New York Times The Daily wire perhaps and the day that's you're in the telling wire that they did the left analyst us is like the number three biggest fake news site out there I don't know that we've ever run a fake story by the way but Natalie to the left all right we need to get I mean the news is hilarious right now but you know what isn't malarious is late-night comedians Jimmy Kimmel is getting back in the humorless partisan hack business with his latest rant about Republican health care reform not only did Bill Cassidy fail the Jimmy Kimmel test he failed the Bill Cassidy test he failed his own test and you don't see that happen very much this bill he came up with is actually worse than the one that thank God Republicans like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and John McCain torpedoed over the summer and I hope they have the courage and good sense to do that again with this one because these other guys who claim they want Americans to have better health care even though eight years ago they don't want anyone to have health care at all they're trying to sneak this scam of a billy cooked up in without an analysis from the bipartisan congressional budget office they don't even want you to see it ha ha ha ha ha ha ha good one Jimmy alley do you remember when Jimmy Kimmel was funny me neither he's wrong he's factually wrong I'm sorry but do you remember when Republicans eight years ago didn't want people to have health care is there anyone that you know in Congress who doesn't want people to have health care yeah chorus we want them dying in the streets I thought right yeah yeah that's what the memo said at least from The Daily Telegraph by masquerading as a comedian and it's sad that we see people won and complete health care and health coverage and then and then just use their platform that's supposed to be one of comedy and entertainment as a way to as a way to present fake news and alternative facts and then they turn around and tell us that we're the ones who lie and that we're the ones who didn't pass our own test doesn't make any sense Emily this guy is not like Bob Hope or Johnny Carson Johnny Carson was actually a pretty left-wing guy he very rarely talked about his politics and interviews occasionally he would let it slip a little bit I favored more abortion or higher taxes or whatever virtually never on air he just was a great late-night host who told jokes whither self control among late-night comedians why is it going away first of all the Daily Show I think I think when we go back to where does news and and media begin where does entertainment start and information end it's all sort of rolling into one and then especially since we've gone through this extremely partisan political election you're looking at people who want to make politics funny and it's funny haha because everybody's gonna laugh along with me because if you don't you're you're the person in the wrong problem yeah it's like what Liz Lemon said on 30 rocks but she's like ain't no party like the Liz Lemon party because the Liz Lemon party is mandatory but I do want to ask the question is that the the one thing that I was noticing that Jimmy Kimmel didn't say there's two words charlie guard try that didn't even occur to me that is that is the defeater for era for this exact argument there that's how government healthcare works is a cryin determined family trying to save their son will be told absolutely no by the government wanting to bring him to the country with the best best health care in the world but I thought we have the worst out here I thought Jimmy Kimmel told me we have mm-hmm that like Cuba yeah yeah like Cuba with all of their empty hospitals absolutely right that that is a really great point because there's this a little bit of compassion that we feel and we don't realize that the road to hell is paved with good intentions and that a government that can give you everything you want can also take away everything you have and that and that isn't funny I ain't laughing Jimmy doctor Bickley you know the whole the this to me wraps into the argument about the discussion about the bias thing and I think there's been a you know like a more and more thorough embrace of relativism where you think well there's there's no truth you know from the left and thus you know you present your own facts right and I feel like the same thing is happening from in the entertainment business where it's like there isn't this is our our whole ideology or something like that hangs on even the entertainment industry now and it's sort of a we're all gearing up toward presenting our truth and our reality and that's sort of overtaking the purpose of the the different medium and nici episode this is he's lost that he's lost a sense of like what what am I actually here to do I'm here to entertain I'm here to in a wide audience as wide as possible that's not that's not actually was trying to do he's actually thinks that he is he's there to propagate an ideology mhm it is the tail wagging the dog and he's excoriating Bill Cassidy senator Cassidy for promising one aspect of health care reform and then changing it slightly whatever happened to if you want to keep your doctor you can keep your doctor and then millions of Americans lose their health insurance and lose their doctors you know he seems to have forgotten about that he's shocked he has the tears in his eyes is it though I wonder that I mean these guys are all professionals they're all showbiz guys is it that they are so moved by their ideology that they can't help but push it all the time or do they think it's gonna get them better ratings in this fractured politicized media environment the Jon Stewart Point is a great point because I think they saw a lot of these similar minded entertainers so like a real success story there and think that they can imitate it even no one's been able to pull it off no ever Noah can't do it who's a talented enjoyable guy that's kind of generally likable he's pretty much flopping yeah it's not he's definitely not significant like Jon Stewart Jon Stewart every week would make headlines and it would matter it wouldn't move the needle and it would move the conversation none of these guys can pull it off but I think they think they can do it you know and I I think there's so much ego I mean even his he his tests he names it the Jimmy Kimmel - Julie Q understand that he's he's in a dialogue with the with the congressman but he's but he still he embraces it he is the test mimimi and if you don't if you don't actually meet his standards you fail the test and that's what matters well that's what the framers talked about right then good good legislation for the republic had to meet the jimmy kimmel test it's in Federalist 59 or something yeah yeah the section shows surprise they're able to see that far ahead in the future to know who Jimmy was that's right well you know speaking of the the tribute that vice pays to virtue in hypocrisy according to a new study at a Britain one out of three self-identified vegetarians eat meat when they are drunk which is a little strange because I eat carbohydrates when I'm drunk I eat beets and stuff who knows different strokes for different folks Ali yes does this mean that we cannot trust how one self identifies perhaps it really made me think this study you know is that if I was in that situation I want biscuits I want bread I want toast all the things just I just wonder what it is about like them I just want a juicy steak after a few beers that it is but I think it does um yeah it does beg the question are you are we who we think we are sober in vino veritas as has always been my mantra Emily these a third of vegetarians are eating meat when they're when they're drunk does it perhaps suggest that mankind is meant to eat meat that we're built to eat meat and we should stop with these Gnostic and ridiculous heresies that tell us that we have to save Gaia by only eating lettuce and things like that um absolutely as a millennial absolutely as a millennial as a vegetarian get me a drumstick we're never supposed to eat me mm-hmm this is this is absolutely forbidden um don't eat anything that has a face that's right you know I I hear this all the time so vegetarian that leaves us with only other Millennials to be that's true they certainly don't have any channels that's right men without chests doctor you're an expert what do we make of this crazy study well again as a doctor you know I feel like there's truth that comes out when you're drunk but there's it's not all truth man does you know it's not all true have you ever experienced this you do some bad things happen when you're drunk yeah I mean sometimes it's just the thing that I don't let myself do I do yeah is that who you are that's a hard question okay does this mean that people shouldn't be vegetarians that we should eat me because they eat meat when they're drunk do you have to apply that to every alley man's heart is evil from the beginning okay maybe we don't want to indulge our darkest fantasies like Chicken McNuggets or say maybe it actually means that we're not supposed to eat meat because you are making bad decisions when you're drunk and if they're eating pepperoni when they're drunk then maybe that just means we're just all supposed to be vegetarians snaps you've convinced me we have to move on in viral video news this thing I woke up actually Ali I think you tweeted this ad this morning that's where I saw it it will get you your daily dose of outrage this will make your blood boil Marshall I might cut it off right there do you by any chance have a translation of that into English do you have any distribution of that exchange yeah that's about what I heard - that video for those of you who couldn't see is a woman in a dining establishment screaming at a military veteran for carrying in his PTSD service dog Wow Emily how has America gotten to this place um that's a really difficult question I don't think I can answer but I think it just circles back to Millennials I agree I blame Millennials - fair enough for me doctor all sad succinct are we so ungrateful why are we so ungrateful that's hard to watch man that's really hard to watch I don't I don't have a response to that video you're all it's it's actually here it isn't it is a little less coverage you can't come up with an i it's so shocking to watch that you don't believe that it's really happening you know only 2% of people in the country today have ever served in the military the 2% of the country has ever served in the US military does that explain our ingratitude during the the world wars during the greatest generation everybody served in the military or is it is the essence does the ingratitude come from ignorance of what these people have gone through Ellie it shouldn't because it's Millennials I mean we've been in a war the majority of our lives where are we we haven't no we haven't gone over there that's very true and you do make a good point but we're familiar with it probably in a way that people over here weren't when the great world or when the great wars were going on simply because of what we can see in the media and how many of our own contemporaries have fought no you said it's not a lot but we've been familiar with it our entire lives so I think the ingratitude has nothing to do with the percentage of people that have actually fought but just again this attitude of entitlement that we have been indoctrinated into feeling just the the deference that people feel both for their country and people who bought for their country it's just not where it was and almost it's become a bad thing to honor the vets and to honor the country and the flag and the Pledge of Allegiance and all of that and so I think it's just a lack of deference and just an apathy towards anything that has to do with patriotism and it taking for granted of the freedoms that we have and you're right that we have seen images of this war we've seen it on TV we've seen it all over the Internet but you know what I think I don't think they see the guy protecting their freedom I think all they see is Abu Ghraib and they see these random memes that are usually incorrect on the data that we've killed all these civilians and they have no sense why we actually went there in the first place they have no sense with regard to Iraq that the policy of the United States government since the 90s was regime change in Iraq that the policy of United Nations was regime change in Iraq that they have made they had chemical weapons programs that they had had a nuclear weapons program they don't have any of that they just see America bad and they and they hate their country they don't respect it it does seem to be echoes of the Vietnam War we is it ever thus is there any way out of this apathy and this ignorant of where our own freedoms come from solve it all for us Emily tell us the answer yeah have everybody sign up for the military well make it like Israel make it mandatory is really hard I don't know a very strong guy I don't I just kind of was hoping I could like read a blog or something don't you think that's what we need you think we need a national system I think you need to read more blogs I think you need to give up me yeah and I think you need to enlist in the militants in the military at least one others it might be helpful to the country definitely the blog mm-hmm dr. Bickley final thoughts yeah you know I think it's it's more it's even more to me it's even worse than a lack of respect or something there's actually been such an undercurrent in education of animosity vilification of the military in general and then I think also would it complicates things with Iraq and stuff it's one thing to fight against the white Germans but I think racism the idea of racism has so saturated everything you know it's like every it is it impacted the view on everything racism is the greatest evil right and so just by Americans fighting people of a different recognizably different race it's already got this negative connotation that's right World War two was the best war ever as some historians have called it because it's equal its other European but this is different that that's an insightful point that I hadn't considered how do we have every woman how do we fight the brown people that's how we're gonna leave it on dr. Berkeley's profound question in America's military future that is our panel excellent discussion today Ali thank you for coming in Ali Stuckey from the blaze Emily Butler and the good doctor himself dr.
