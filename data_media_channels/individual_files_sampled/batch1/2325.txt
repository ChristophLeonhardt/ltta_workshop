climate change is apparently by all reckoning the most difficult type of problem for people to accept it's far enough in the future and no individual is responsible everybody is responsible and there's no enemy except us but we're just trying to make a living breathing and burning stuff like everybody else if you're this guy Inhofe from Oklahoma it's literally unimaginable to you you can't imagine how a population of humans could change the atmosphere of an entire planet but we have largely by accident when I went to the World's Fair in 1964 five there were fewer than three billion people in the world when I left the World's Fair there were more than three billion now in my grandfather's day there were fewer than one and a half billion today as we record this they're 7.2 billion that's the first problem if you had an extraordinary car and some kind of extraordinary road and you can go straight up for an hour you'd be in outer space so that's the problem seven billion people the atmosphere and then the third problem or thing you got understand is carbon dioxide and a few other gases keep the world warm without carbon dioxide the greenhouse effect the world would be too cold for us to be here ovaries to live the way we extend exist the way we exist we wouldn't look anything like ourselves in other words so those three things carbon dioxide holds in heat seven billion people atmosphere really thin that's why we're changing that's how we're changing the climate the other problem with carbon dioxide doesn't go away it's not if you have a swimming pool that's dirty and you trickle in clean water long enough and drain out dirty well eventually it'll be clean but the atmosphere is once the carbon dioxides in there is not going anywhere baby stays there for centuries here's what I want everybody to do talk about it everybody talk about it all the time and then we'll get around to doing something about it if the United States were leading in better battery technology wind and solar I know there's a whole nuclear a bunch of guy on fine we were leading the way in energy production through sustainable means coal and oil would decrease in usefulness and the world would follow United States but with the United States dragging feet meaning about China whining about India and they're not playing by the same really they named me me me me nothing's getting done if the United States were out in front the whole world would follow
