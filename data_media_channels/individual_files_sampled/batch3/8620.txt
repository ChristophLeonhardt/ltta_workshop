HOWIE: JOY REID, THE MSNBC HOST APOLOGIZED OVER HOMOPHOBIC WEB POSTS SHE WROTE YEARS AGREE. BUT WHEN MORE POSTS WERE REVEALED, SHE CAME UP WITH A FAR-FETCHED EXPLANATION, THAT SHE HAD BEEN HACKED. WHICH WOULD HAVE TO HAVE OCCURRED WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE KNOWN. I GENUINELY DO NOT BELIEVE I WROTE THOSE HATEFUL THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPLETELY AIRIEN TO ME. BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND BASED ON THINGS I HAVE TWEETED AND HAVE WRITTEN IN THE PAST WHY SOME PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE ME. I HAVE NOT BEEN EXEMPT FROM BEING HURTFUL OR CRUEL TO THE VERY PEOPLE I WANT TO ADVOCATE FOR.
