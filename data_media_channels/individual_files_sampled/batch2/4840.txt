all right so not for nothing Donny Deutsch the president are successfully recruited into the White House a highly regarded attorney this week who was supposed to bring some order to the president's legal predicament as it pertains to the Muller probe it is abundantly clear and more clear by the hour that the president is far more worried about what his friend your friend Michael Cohen has on him yeah I spoke to Michael Kahn yesterday and when Giuliani had come out I said to Michael what are we making he goes in case he doesn't was talking about in Trump basically came out today and said the same thing and Giuliani came out today and said the same thing I find it interesting the great guy Giuliani that Trump talks about this is the same guy that two days ago compared the FBI people who give their lives to protect our country two Nazis where Michael Cohen who basically is the target this investigation and when the FBI showed up at his place he said they conducted themselves professionally and he thanked them so you have the discipline former US head of the Southern District Attorney former mayor of New York the president United States continually tripping over each other drooling on each other contradicting each other you have Michael Kohn disciplined who is a target here and not doing any of that fun there's an irony there I mean it doesn't look like he was it was always a disciplined attorney and that's why he's understand he will see I'm talking about right now in this situation is target also it doesn't seem to a brought discipline to that table Michael said to me look there are two people that know everything and it's Donald Trump myself and that's eventually going to come out I find if anybody has any question of why Giuliani as involved in this is the thought process behind it it was probably knowing Donald the way I do and knowing his management style I'm sure it was a momentary either Giuliani called them about you know you need tough guys out there or Trump got pissed one day at one of his lawyers and that's the way he makes these decisions and the defense of Giuliani to say he's a rookie just you know whip on years just in a court of law school I mean it's preposterous and I predict Rudy Giuliani will be out of here in two weeks this is just the beginning of what I think will be a continued circus of stupidity and we will watch it on the Thrones is Michael Cohen in a position where he knows what comes next for him no Michael Cote does not know what Scott you know Michael Conan and I've said this I've spent a lot of time and this is look I really haven't done anything wrong I don't know what they're coming with we will find that he believes he hasn't anything wrong do you think he's gonna cooperate with prosecutors here's what I think and and I think that Michael still has this very deep emotional connection to the present in the family I think that would be his last resort I think Michael ended - yeah I do think Michael can I don't know this is a fact just I just think humans if Michael Cohen has ever confronted with any serious serious jail time and it's his family or anybody else's he's gonna do what's right for his family as well as he should whether it's Donald Trump of Barack Obama or anybody else which then brings me back to why is that that is the one guy if I am Donald Trump I'm worried about and Donald Trumpkin I don't know what the strategy is I don't know what the thought process with but Donald Trump will do something and I'm gonna fourth Michael Michaels I don't understand it it's like Donald Trump is self-destructive so Michaels still in his gut is incredibly loyal and Trump has not understood that or has underestimated that or people who whispering in his ear or maybe Donald Trump knows the bodies doesn't know about where the bodies are buried it doesn't mean none of it makes sense hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
