These four American Green
Berets were killed last fall
when their patrol was
ambushed in Niger.
The Defense Department
launched an investigation
into what happened.
But helmet camera footage
from one of the soldiers
allowed us to reconstruct
some of the attack.
It’s the morning
of Oct. 4, 2017.
A convoy of around eight
American and Nigerien army
vehicles leaves the
village of Tongo Tongo
after a mission in the area.
They’re quickly
ambushed by militants
loyal to Islamic State.
Footage of that fight shows
that two American vehicles
are separated from the convoy.
The others had fled or were hit.
We see seven soldiers
taking cover.
The attackers are
somewhere in this area.
An American soldier we believe
to be Staff Sergeant Jeremiah
Johnson wearing a helmet
camera enters the white vehicle
and drives it a short distance.
He steps out and begins
firing towards the tree line.
Then, he runs for cover
behind the white vehicle,
and the video cuts
to a new scene.
Next, we only see the black
car and three soldiers —
Staff Sergeants Johnson,
Wright, and Black.
The white car has
disappeared, and we don’t
know how much time has elapsed.
Wright drives the car toward
the mark of a red smoke grenade.
The smoke could be to mask their
movements from the militants,
or to mark their position
for supporting units.
Johnson, taking
cover at the rear,
fires toward the tree line.
After they’ve reached the smoke,
there’s a cut in the video.
In the next scene, the
red smoke has cleared.
The car begins to move again,
when Johnson and Black fall.
Black is unresponsive.
Johnson regains his footing.
He moves forward and
starts searching.
It could be for support
or for the enemy.
Wright then drags Black
to cover, behind the car.
He aims back towards
the treeline.
The scene ends.
The militants are closing in.
We don’t know how much
time has passed here,
but Wright changes
his direction of fire.
He and Johnson begin running
without covering each other.
This suggests they’re
about to be overrun.
The situation is too desperate.
There are more
edits to the video,
but we’re able to map
their final steps.
Johnson is seriously wounded
and falls, but then moves
about another 40 feet.
Militant fire seems to
be coming from this area.
Wright stops running and shoots.
A short time later, two armed
militants appear on screen.
Johnson appears
to be unconscious.
Still, he is shot by the
militants at close range.
Staff Sergeant Wright
dies just feet away.
For them, the ambush is over.
