ELECTION. KRISTIN: THANKS SO MUCH, DAN SPRINGER IN LAS VEGAS FOR US. LELAND: NOW PERHAPS WE GET ANSWERS OR SOME OPINIONS. A NEW POLL SAYS IMMIGRATION EVEN ABOVE THE ECONOMY IS ISSUE NUMBER ONE FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. SO DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO MAKE A DEAL OR STAY IN THEIR CORNERS AND BLAME THE OTHER SIDE? JOINING US NOW TO DISCUSS, RADIO HOST WADE SMITH AND GARLAND MISSON. NICE TO SEE BOTH OF YOU. WADE, DO REPUBLICANS HAVE AN EXPOSED FLANK HERE IF THEY CAN'T GET SOMETHING DONE, GIVEN HOW MUCH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT IMMIGRATION REFORM? IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE DEMOCRATS HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY WHEN THEY HAD THE SUPER MAJORITY BACK A COUPLE YEARS AGO. REPUBLICANS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM GET SOMETHING DONE BUT GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS, DEMOCRATS JUST WANT THIS AS AN ISSUE THAT THEY CAN CAMPAIGN ON AND IF REPUBLICANS GET IT DONE, THEY GET IT DONE, GREAT. IF THEY DON'T, IT'S ANOTHER YEAR OF ELECTIONS. LELAND: GARLAND, TO YOU, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE HAVE REPUBLICANS DIGGING IN THEIR HEELS. DEMOCRATS THOUGH ALSO ARE DIGGING IN THEIR HEELS. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF APPETITE FOR COMPROMISE. YOU AGREE WITH WADE THAT IT'S BETTER AS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE? I THINK THE DEMOCRATS KNOW THAT TRADITIONALLY THE INCUMBENT PARTY IS KIND OF SWIMMING AGAINST THE TIDE GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE MAJORITIES IN BOTH HOUSES SO THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE OF WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED. SO FAR, THEY SEEM TO BE ARGUING OR THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE ARGUING, HEY, OUR MAJORITY ISN'T BIG ENOUGH WHICH IS STILL ADMISSION THAT THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE THINGS THEY WANTED TO GET ACCOMPLISHED. THE DEMOCRATS I THINK HAVE THE UPPER HAND. LELAND: CLEARLY REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T GOTTEN EVERYTHING THEY WANTED DONE DONE. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO SOME OF THE RHETORIC COMING FROM BOTH SIDES. TUCKER CARLSON LAST NIGHT WITH HIS THOUGHTS ON THOSE CALLING REPUBLICANS EVIL. TAKE A LISTEN. THE THING ABOUT PURE EVIL IS YOU CAN'T REASON WITH IT. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH PURE EVIL OR REACH SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE WITH PURE EVIL. PURE EVIL CAN ONLY BE DESTROYED BY FORCE. GIVEN THAT, IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE LEFT IS NOW MOBILIZING TO HARASS, FIRE AND IF NECESSARY PHYSICALLY ATTACK ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH THEM ON IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE, AGAIN, PURE EVIL. LELAND: AND WE SAW EVIDENCE OF THIS CONTINUING LAST NIGHT. THE TWEET THIS MORNING FROM SARAH SANDERS, IT'S SHAMEFUL THAT DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA EXPLOITED THIS PHOTO OF A LITTLE GIRL TO PUSH THEIR AGENDA. SHE WAS NOT SEPARATED FROM HER MOM, SEPARATION HERE IS FROM THE FACTS. DEMS SHOULD JOIN POTUS AND FIX THE BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. SHE TWEETED SHE WAS ASKED TO LEAVE A RESTAURANT LAST NIGHT BECAUSE SHE WORKS FOR THE PRESIDENT. SHE SAID SHE LEFT AND THEN SECRETARY NIELSEN ALSO PROTESTED AND FORCED TO LEAVE A RESTAURANT, TAKE A LISTEN. SHAME! SHAME! LELAND: REALLY, THESE ARE THE TACTICS OF THE DEMOCRATS? I THINK ULTIMATELY WHAT IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO IS THIS. WHEN WE GET TO THE MIDTERMS, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE POLICY, IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT WHETHER THE REPUBLICANS CAN GET A POLICY THROUGH. SO RIGHT NOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE ANGRIEST AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTING OUT THE MOST, THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE VOTING BUT THEY ONLY GET TO VOTE ONCE. WHO CAN GET CAN THE REPUBLICANS GET LEGISLATION THROUGH AND CONVINCE THE INDEPENDENTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T OUT THERE IN THE STREET OR WHO AREN'T DOING THE OVER-THE-TOP THINGS, THAT'S WHO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOCUS ON. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO IGNORE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND OF THE MOST OUTLANDISH. LELAND: IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO IGNORE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE DOES THIS PLAY INTO THE REPUBLICANS' HANDS? IT SEEMS LIKE IT MAY MOTIVATE UNDECIDED VOTERS BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. IT DEFINITELY WILL PUSH VOTERS BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WITH THE WAY THAT NIELSEN'S GETTING TREATED, WITH THE WAY SARAH SANDERS IS GETTING TREATED. REPUBLICANS LOVE SARAH SANDERS. DEMOCRATS MAY NOT LIKE HER. THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAND HER. REPUBLICANS THINK OF HER AS A SWEETHEART. SHE'S FIGHTING FOR DONALD TRUMP EVERY DAY. THE REASON WE'RE IN THIS SITUATION IS BECAUSE THE POLICY BEFOREHAND WAS 20 DAYS IN A DETENTION SENDER FOR A FAMILY, CENTER FOR A FAMILY, YOU'RE RELEASED. THIS CAN'T STAND. WHETHER OR NOT THE REPUBLICANS GET SOMETHING PASSED, IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL WIN IN THE MIDTERMS. LELAND: GARLAND, YOU GET THE FINAL WORD. IF WE RECALL BACK TO 2010, UNDER OBAMA, THE DEMOCRATS HAD A MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PRODUCE AS MUCH AS MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE AS MOST PEOPLE WOU HAVE AS MOST PEOPLE WOULDAVE AS MOST PEOPLE WOULD HE AS MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE LIKED. THEY KIND OF HAVE TAKEN A BEATING. THE REPUBLICANS ARE TALKING A LOT. THEY'VE GOT THE MAJORITY. IF THEY DON'T PRODUCE, THEY'LL PAY. LELAND: DO YOU WORRY THE KIND OF RHETORIC WE'RE SEEING NOW PUSHES SORT OF MODERATE OR UNDECIDED REPUBLICANS BACK TO BEING HARD CORE REPUBLICANS WHEN THEY SEE HOW PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED? I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT KIND OF RHETORIC IS UNHEALTHY.. I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES THE VOTERS. LELAND: REALLY. I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO VOTE REPUBLICAN ARE GOING TO VOTE REPUBLICAN. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDECIDED ARE LOOKING AT THE ISSUES. LELAND: WHY DO YOU THINK THERE ARE NOT DEMOCRATS CALLING OUT FELLOW CALL THEM PROGRESSIVES, CALL THEM WHATEVER YOU WANT, FOR THIS KIND OF AND I HAVE AND V HAVE AND VITAVE AND VITRIE AND VITRIOL THAT WE'RE SEEING NOW, IS THERE NO LINE FOR DEMOCRATS. WE USED TO CALL IT ON THE LEFT OBAMA DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. I THINK WE HAVE TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE EMOTIONALLY TRIGGERED BY DONALD TRUMP THAT THEY'RE MAKING BAD DECISIONS AND THEY'RE ACTING IN WAY THAT'S ARE UNHEALTHY FOR OUR SOCIETY. I DON'T THINK IT'S A NEW PHENOMENON. THERE'S A LINE, IT'S THE PARTY LINE FOR DEMOCRATS. THAT'S THE ONLY LINE FOR THEM. LELAND: GENTLEMEN, WE
