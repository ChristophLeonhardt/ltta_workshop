There were hundreds of people
clamoring desperately to get inside,
and when the doors finally opened,
a near stampede of anxious bodies flooded through.
But that’s just how an Apple launch event
typically kicks off.
When there’s a new flagship product
like the iPhone 7,
Joanna and I essentially put our entire lives on hold
until we cover all the bases.
At an event, Geoff and I analyze
and make sense of all the new details for our readers...
and occasionally drop a little snark.
Like Joanna tweeting about losing those AirPods
just from seeing them.
Yea, like that.
But the real work doesn’t start
until after the big event is over.
We take home early review units,
but only have five days to judge them
before they hit stores.
That means running 24-hour testing
to push these devices to their limits.
We’ve got automated web browsing
that simulates battery drain,
camera comparisons against every competitor,
I even have a special jacket to carry them all around.
We’re trying to squeeze a lifetime of conceivable punishment
into a couple of days,
so we have to get creative.
For example, to test the iPhone 7’s water resistance,
I got out my wetsuit and snorkel,
and shot an entire video underwater.
Considering how people these days
are even bringing their devices to bed,
it’s really important to put them through their paces...
Specs are one thing,
but real-world tests are what truly matter.
Luckily for us,
that’s actually a fun process,
so we don’t mind going to...
extreme depths.
Oh, I see what you did there.
I’m Geoffrey Fowler,
and I’m Joanna Stern,
Wait, we got that backwards.
He’s Geoffrey Fowler,
and she’s Joanna Stern,
and we’re Technology Columnists
at The Wall Street Journal.
