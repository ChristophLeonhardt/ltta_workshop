Justin Trudeau needs to be replaced he's wrecking the country the only party that can replace him is the Conservatives andp is far worse by the way and they have no chance anyways Maxine Bernier doesn't yet have a new party and I don't think it'd win it has to be the Conservatives perhaps Andrew Shearer thinks that you know any consumer in the countries is trapped and everyone has to support him it was Patrick Brown's thinking - so Patrick Brown once he won the leadership of his party he supported the carbon tax and other left-wing ideas for radical six gender sex add Andrew Shearer says he supports the UN Paris agreement on global warming he didn't tell us that till after he was elected leader he's for the dairy cartel he's for banning the rebel and that's not enough to disqualify him as preferable to Trudeau I acknowledge that but it's enough for good conservatives to think am I really gonna donate a thousand dollars or volunteer a hundred hours for this guy who's for the global warming cult and bans the rebel is this still a grassroots party or is it run by the weird dairy Lobby or something and and whatever the party stands for that it's still truly conservative are they going to be scared off of those items because some weirdos in the media party like Bob 5 for Laura stone or this woman from the CBC rosemary Barton who loves Trudeau passionately if they merely breathe on Andrew Shearer he's immediately gonna cave in to what they wanted the media party isn't that a problem I Know Who I am I'm the guy who's been fighting for conservative causes for nearly 30 years I've worked for Preston Mannion work for Stockwell day I supported the party under Stephen Harper and yes under Andrew Shearer sometimes it's a party members sometimes as an employee sometimes as a journalist always as an activist at the Sun News Network at the rebel where our team has produced more than 9700 videos I know who I am and I know who we are and I know what we're fighting for and so do our supporters and if they don't like it they don't have to watch it or donate to us I'm not sure you sure can say the same thing he won the conservative leadership by a whisker on the 13th ballot he is hidden from any policy fight on real things including immigration levels and extreme multiculturalism and he's shown he can't manage a caucus it might be too late for him to pull it together in time for next year's election it might be too late but he needs to get his act together and stop with the amateur hour and stop with the internal party divisions and stop treating friends like enemies and enemies like friends I will make a prediction and it's an unhappy one unless Andrew Shearer finds some courage somewhere and realizes that his true enemy is the liberal media he will lose the next election he just will and you know that'll be just fine by the dairy cartel lobbyists they have the Liberal Party all sewn up too but true consumers won't be fine with that and they'll have a conservative party much more divided much smaller and much weaker than the one that Andrew Shearer inherited from Stephen Harper what a shame that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
