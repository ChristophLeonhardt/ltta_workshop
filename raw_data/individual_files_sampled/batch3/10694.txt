hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle the Democratic Party's in big trouble the party has not come to terms with the outcome of the 2016 election they have a leadership out of touch with its base Millennials are fleeing so is their slogan now no party for white men Krauss sucking the trials and tribulations of the left i'm joined by my guess as i collar in seattle he's a writer activist and progressive youtuber in west hartford we have Julio Rivera he is editorial director for reactionary times and in news max columnist and here in Moscow we have Don debar he's an anti-war activist and a host of a daily radio program alright gentleman crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate sock let me go to you first in Seattle because you get up the earliest for this program and it's much appreciated I mean I suppose you came oh came across this walkaway movement that has taken a bit of a flash on the on the internet here I found that to be very curious because I think I instinctively everyone on this panel and a lot of people in the in the in the country already know this and and and the the inclusivity of the Democrats is what they say but in fact they're actually actively excluding people of all kinds of people different stripes and attitudes and outlooks how do you reflect upon that Zack go ahead I agree it's funny because it's great that it's going viral now but you know at least here in America I saw a lot of this happening in 2016 how media wasn't but basically that's part of what happened in the 2016 election is lots and lots and lots of Democrats who used to be very active voters active in their community completely left the party behind for a number of reasons not whole lot has changed in this 2016 but you know at least this viral video campaign is helping more people kind of be brought into the fold since that happened because as you know I think it's a very good thing that people walk away from the democratic party okay I want to go back to why you think it is later in the program holy oh basically the same thing to you because I mean I've been very very critical of the identity politics but it seems to me that since 2000 it didn't work in 2016 and it's not working now but they've doubled down on it I mean I it just you know that's the definition of stupidity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome okay I find it really breathtakingly stupid to be honest go ahead julio and west heart exactly it's the definition of insanity and they're gonna continue to do it because they have no platform quite frankly to run on i mean they can't really criticize the results on your Trump because for the traditional democratic demographics the Latinos the black unemployment has been you know at historic lows or near historic lows the entire time and I think that people they're of color and you know women and and some of those other demographics right now or feel that they're being insulted in a sense it is intellectually insulting for Democrats to make the assumption that all these groups are supposed to just you know coalesce only with the Democrats you know it should give our policy it should be about the color of your skin it should be about which party will bring the best results for you economically and otherwise who the open and let me go to dawn I thought that's what the Democratic Party used to do exactly what Julio just said go ahead Don politics is supposed to be the field in which public policy is determined and in a democratic society which people refer to the United States as they've been doing it my whole life referring to it then those decisions policy decisions are supposed to be made democratically when you have the determinations of policy made at the beginning of the process by you know big-money basically whether it's Democrats or Republicans who are the politicians that will implement those policies the job becomes then selling policy that the people don't want to people by Madison Avenue techniques which is where you get identity politics we are going to do things that are good for big banks we're going to do things that are good for the military-industrial complex we're going to do things that are good for the prison industrial complex we have to sell it to black folks this way so Hispanic folks this way so white working-class folks this way etc in other words these divisions quote-unquote that are you know things that are like in a Madison Avenue playbook are the things that have to be excited because it's determined already what's going to happen and all they're doing is trying to temper your response to it and so at the end of the day when people don't feel anything actualized through public policy discussions debates elections etc they become frustrated and they start walking away and what we're seeing happen with the Democratic Party is the logical conclusion of this process and I think it's terminal okay well yeah I mean if you look I mean with the advent of Barack Obama what did the fortunes of the Democratic Party in Congress in the White House gubernatorial races I mean really Minh twerk I don't understand why they keep doing it Zack let me go to you because I find it I I'm really insulted by politicians that pigeonhole me okay you know because of my appearance number one or some of my preferences that doesn't determine my political outlook and they insult the in the electric by for example if you're a gay person oh you must be a Democrat really why I've never understood that everyone has the right to determine what they think and express what they think in public without being a pigeon-holed and intimidated to vote to pull them to go along with the party line go ahead Zack yep you're exactly right and you know I know the gay guy and that's exactly what happened through 2016 is people just assume you're voting Democrat and so they get what point in my life did all of a sudden the Democrat like deserve my vote you know obviously Bill Clinton was the one responsible for two anti-gay federal bills while he was president you know find a president that's done more harm to the gay community than the Clintons you know so it's like it was always an odd assumption and when people only allow you to have you know I can only be gay and have the view that supporting this political party which was described perfectly the candidates are predetermined by the big-money interests and then they trying to put it on the different you know voter groups and it just assumes that every single gay person has the same political opinion every single black person has the same with political being it's completely insulting it's completely homophobic racist to assume that the entire motor group may will not do more than both of the exact thing what if a party it's absurd and most people have come and anyone telling a certain person that they have to vote a certain way based on one characteristic of them that does that it's insulting it's insulting because they take you for granted I mean and that's the worst thing a politician can do take you for granted here you know one of the things that's you know really oh the big bugs witness the new a court appointment in there is a woman who happens to be a Catholic and has a large family and it seems to me when I look at the liberal media they're more terrified that Trump will appoint a woman he's not supposed to do that he's a misogynist you know all their fuses start blowing up I actually find it very amusing to watch it's like watching adolescents okay it's it's just matray go value that they claim to hold go ahead Julio exactly it's almost like when you know the whole foreign policy thing with North Korea started you know improving people were like you know upset almost like liberals wanted there to be the constant threat of North Korea because that would have somehow proven that Donald Trump was doing a terrible job from a foreign policy perspective you know and just to kind of expand on the whole walk away saying I think that a lot of people did this a long time ago I mean you have to look at the results of elections in 2010 when the tea parties rose up when you look at 2014 where there was a big Republican revolution where a lot of House seats were gained and the Senate was retaken by the demmer by the Republicans rather and the 2016 election results you know this party has nothing to offer I can't say that enough I mean what's their platform gonna be we're gonna increase your taxes and they think that the common American the working-class American is gonna gravitate towards that this blue wave that supposedly is coming is non-existent in my opinion you know you know Don you know one of the things I find really tragic of what's going on the Democratic Party because they used to traditionally support the working-class people and and I think that was that was admirable okay I I do like having a adversarial political system because you get the best out of it to me negotiation debate and all of that that's what that's okay and I actually miss traditional liberals in because they actually had a genuine concern for the working-class people for for the everyday people if I can use that term anymore why are they I mean we see it all to the Clinton campaign is that don't worry about white men you know they lost cause you know what this and you know it's not even part of their electoral calculus which is in the end of the day that's what made Donald Trump the president I mean how did they miss this and how do they keep missing it done I don't know how they keep missing it again the problem is the a priori decisions are you know policy decisions are made that way at the beginning we're doing this and it gets done now the politicians go out and argue over whether it was a good thing or not although the mechanism by which this thing happened they're a very small group of people who were making very big policy decisions that transfer large amounts of wealth and civic bank accounts and make the rest of us basically have more problems in our daily lives so the outcome you know among the population is going to be you know this is another basis for us being dissatisfied this is bad for me I have to work longer hours I don't have as much money I'm in foreclosure I'm being evicted you know across there are millions of people that are in all kinds of distress in the United States this has been growing since the 1970s really and and unabated since the mid late 80s and there's no remedy offered in the political system so when politicians come out and start talking about division for example you're talking about an adversarial process normally we're trained to think like in courts an adversarial process is how you do your you know find truth in this case there is the adversary is between the people who are making policy and the rest of us but they have us at each other's throats arguing over what is there isn't true while all of us are having our wealth transfer to a very small group of people who make those decisions it's a public relations game really it's not a place where policy is made and that's the problem but it's what's really interesting is that we've had a series revolts we've had the Tea Party revolt we had we had the Occupy we had Occupy and we're gonna go to a short break here but I want to talk about Alexander Alexandria Ocasio Cortes when we come back gentlemen we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue a discussion on the trials and tribulations of the left stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter labelled remind you were discussing the trials and tribulations of the left okay let's go back to Zack in Seattle okay we've really beaten up on the Democrats that least the establishment Democrats now let's see another angle that's going here I don't want to give the impression that I and I hope we have it is that people leaving the Democratic Party or our Pro tump they're not all Pro Trump some of them have moved over to the GOP actually a lot of the data says the GOP is still more attractive than Donald Trump that's the topic of an entirely different program which I think it's quite fascinating because I'm a conservative and I really have contempt for the GOP so that would be an interesting topic but I want to go back to Alexandria or Casa Cortez Zak I mean she's a very interesting phenomenon and she's the the the reason the most recent eruption of the disruption in the two political parties and I give the leadership of the Democratic Party just so blinded by all of these things here they were blindsided by her election I don't feel sorry for her opponent I mean because he's a swamp character I wish more of them would he thrown out but I mean listening to her on Meet the Press democratic socialism I don't think she has a clue what it really is but it sounds nice okay it sounds nice and considering the the empty rhetoric that we have from these establishment politicians including Republicans I'm not surprised some people want to listen to that to be honest with you go ahead Zack yeah I mean she's something a little different but obviously she was supported by some elements of the New York power structure that allowed her to get to the point that she's at I agree it's good that she's removing someone who's been probably there a lot longer than he should have been however that's not really a great sign that the Democrats have really you know revitalized their brand she's you know she's got a very conflicted character in some of the things that she's presented and some of the things that are actually in her past I think that's teachers kind of representation of the Bernie Sanders aftermath Democrats think that if they use the image of Bernie Sanders that they can actually maintain some kind of you know relationship with Democratic Party voters that are leaving the party but I don't think that you know she's really a good symbol for what's going on because I don't think that this is a common occurrence and if you look at who is supporting her from a financial standpoint you're gonna see that the same Democratic Party's big donor that blew the election employee 16 and have been you know attorney people away from the party for years and years and years it's very interesting to me let me go to Julio I think one of the things he had to say right after her election is that you know ice has to be dismantled who is really surprised and really disappointed that it kind of you know there's you you eat well you have this trickle-down economics but that was trickle up ideology all of a sudden you have the people in the mainstream Democratic establishment saying we should get rid of ice I mean I'm sure this Alexandria is a nice lady I don't want to cast aspersions on her a nice 28 year old that had a privileged upbringing that it showed herself to be you know a kid from the Bronx okay good that's PR lets you know that's how it works but you know I was really amazed how this shocked outcome in the 14th district in New York and it goes into the mainstream they want to talk about ice no borders I mean again it this lunacy is a disease you know and Donald Trump is releasing their brains I guess because they can't think straight if you look at poll after poll Republicans and Democrats in majorities want better immigration policies again they're out to lunch go ahead Julio yeah I mean if you look at a lot of quotations there's a lot of good videos online did show you know Hillary Clinton talking about immigration Bill Clinton talking about immigration you know in the past thing that we needed stronger enforcement and you know this how it's Andrea of kcl Cortes to me is the worst possible manifestation of identity politics you know and she's so out of touch with a lot of the Latino people that she claims to represent I mean a lot of those people risked everything risk their lives everything they they you know and left their country to escape those type of social democratic socialist policies that they have good America good point and her story to me is a lie anyway because her dad was a an architect who had a success full business she didn't grow up in the Bronx she's not a true child with the ghettos the way she tries to portray herself to be so to me she's just a frog okay done I mean I think Julio just said it really best you know because one of the things is is that identity politics per se is not really about those individual victimized groups by white people no it's a recipe for power because this is what they want they want power that's why they can't talk about policy okay and this is one of the huge problems like Donald Trump or not and we've done so many programs on them he does have policies some I'm vehemently or against okay some that I agree with but at least up the gops got policies he can chew on okay the left just have fake pictures on on magazine covers I mean it's it's really really distressing go ahead Don let's look at the last 25 years and follow to two tracks quickly and look at this in relation to the Democratic Party and a Republican Party you had for example the globalization thing what jobs are starting to be offshore it in the 80s and 90s go to fast forward in 1999 in Seattle I think it was 1999 WTO protests and a relationship where the you know the unions and the big marches and protests against you know globalization basically the aliens ended up joining the marches because their constituents went over the heads of the organizers and said you know what these guys are talking about it right it's my job that's getting shipped overseas you know fast forward to 2008 you have the economic collapse the the people who felt so insecure this is America okay they elected the black guy that was a remarkable moment in American history and what happened nothing exactly the same thing continued policy didn't change and iota you come up to 2016 and you have in the Democratic Party Bernie Sanders who wasn't supposed to get any lift at all he was supposed to be a distraction really wins the primary was stolen from him and Donald Trump was not even a Republican every Republican in that party ran against him the entire apparatus both political parties and he ended up winning that nomination in a cakewalk and the presidency one last thing on the other track go back to the nine you know go to LA and Rodney King and everything that happened and people going in the streets over that and come straight up to you know black lives matter and the way that the Democrats relate to that they try to co-opt it but in fact the policies that came out of it if you look at Bill Clinton with mass incarceration after Rodney King all the way up to the way the people are being treated today in the streets you have this whole country huge conceptual constituencies with real needs that are not being satisfied and the public relations effort targets them based on these fake you know identities that are supposed to correspond to the constituencies but because they have nothing to do with policies that these constituencies need they're fake and and this whole thing is kind of collapsing that's what we're talking about really it's really interesting let me go back to you in Seattle I mean one of the things we can go back to the the case in New York with a Miss Alexandria I mean one take away from me is that both parties and to a much greater degree with the Democrats because they can't get that Clinton poison out of their system there I think some people really want it to finally come out here but I mean one of the takeaway from that election was we really need a return to local politics to find out what real people are saying instead of like what Don says and I completely agree instead of having Madison Avenue you know do it on a macro all the way down why don't you start listening to the people you know in the local Cafe and Bakery and and we'll find out what they really think because it seems that they're so very much at odds with the leadership particularly of the Democratic Party the Republican Party is more complicated for different reasons i we can talk about that another program go ahead Zack yeah I totally agree it and it's this kind of weird conundrum that the Democratic Party is in where they want to have their cake and eat it too they want to have their big they want to be against campaign finance reform you know it really is very fraudulent in many ways what the Democratic Party does and part of the reason they don't listen is because they're exact constituents that they're going after these kind of identity politics groups probably for the most part understand the problems of neoliberalism and they're not going to be able to get sincere feedback from these people because the Democrats have been problems are so long that they kind of have to page who they're talking who is talking points they're using to support the party as it is mouths because most people aren't brutally aware of the failures with Democratic Party so they can't even do too deep they're not listening problems because what they're gonna find out is information that they don't want to hear and they've been resistant to taking those things into consideration and making action policy achievements that they have to support the reasons they're telling that person to vote for the party at least from administration has accomplished things that's why we saw the back like their Democratic Party under Obama is she was barely accomplishing anything it's like okay why should we trust another Democrat when Barack Obama in my opinion made things worse didn't even make progress on a big picture so it's like hard to trust the democratic party when they have nothing to be responsible for having fixed in recent memory you know Julio the only the only talking point we've had since the election of 2016 from the left is to hate and undermine and dismiss everything the President of the United States said the Democratic choice of the American people I mean it it's it's painful to watch cable TV like MSNBC and CNN it's not even worth watching like why should I sacrifice that time then it will never get back in my life just to hear slurs and and and really just incredible bias it's it's such poison for our for our political dialogue there is no dialogue okay it's just one it's a one-way direction propaganda this is so damaging to the electoral process and I thought I put it squarely on the left for this go ahead Julio yeah definitely I mean all they've done is be divisive and separate America and you know just foster all this arm you know that this feeling of division within the country but the one thing that they need to understand is you cannot win a major midterm alike you cannot win a presidency without the most important demo laughing and it's the the demographic that votes the most in this country which is white men they've done any everything that they can to sort of you know attack white men in this country and Donald Trump obviously resonated with white men and the Republican Party is resonating with white men so you know they can go out there and they can pander to every particular race every particular sexual orientation and religion and all these other things until they start to come up with policies which are attractive to white men they are not going to win before we before we end the program I'm really glad that you said that because it's really interesting is that white women did too okay but oh we're told by the Democrats Hillary Clinton that men told them to vote that way I mean they even use the identity politics against themselves it's really quite extraordinary okay gentlemen that's all the time we have many thanks to my guests in Seattle where's Hartford and in Moscow and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember crosstalk rules
