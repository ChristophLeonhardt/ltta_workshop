Hillary Clinton is a bigot my goal is to
provide every african-american child in
our country with access to the ladder of
American success there certainly can be
a softening because we're not looking to
hurt people we want people we have some
great people in this country we have
some great great people in this country
Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees
people of color
only his votes not as human beings
worthy of a better future she's going to
do nothing for african-americans she's
going to do nothing for the Hispanics
she's only going to take care of herself
her husband her consultants her donors
these are the people she care about
