But I just started dancing!

You're saying that you've never danced before?

51
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,220
That was my first move!

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,360
Oh, you're lying to us!

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,640
You're a liar.

Laura: I don't really understand what's going on..
Lele: Is she giving us attitude?

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,420
Did she just give us attitude?

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,500
I know the difference between bad and good. And you my friend are good.

80
