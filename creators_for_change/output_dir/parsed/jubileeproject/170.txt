my dad told me that if I made a wish at
11:11 it'll come true it was the last
thing he taught me before he got sick
every day I wish that he would get
better but he never did
now I just wish that my life wouldn't
matter so looks like I've got you for a
thousand hours lucky me
just do what you're told and I'll make
sure your community service doesn't
become prison time

judges idea was sick joke

home from school but it got shut down

wishes down now I know you're lying I'll

part of the process
