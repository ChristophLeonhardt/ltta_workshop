Emmanuel macron has said he would for sure welcome Britain back into the EU so I've seen reports that have suggested that Emmanuel macron the french president has said that he would for sure want britain to rejoin the EU the reports that say that are wrong um I don't think he's done maliciously I just think it's an error in reporting and I think it's important that we actually look at what he really did say I'm not here to defend him I knew on micron I think he's an ass I don't like him but I think it's important to put things straight here so I did write in one of my columns actually that micron and Merkel are the worst culprits for trying to punish Britain during the brexit negotiations and in fact former brexit secretary David Davis has confirmed this but the story about Makran saying that he for sure wants Britain to rejoin the EU isn't technically right so it refers to an interview he did with Bloomberg in which the he said he would for sure welcome Britain back if we decided to have her at second referendum and therefore we join quite a different story significant but a different story so I'm not saying as well that macron doesn't want Britain to stay in fact I can pretty confidently say that in my new one micron wants Britain to stay in the EU but we must be clear and honest about the story during that same interview he was also asked about his attempt to lure bankers from London over to Paris post breaks it and he explained that because he doesn't have any midterm elections to worry about unlike President Trump for instance he isn't driven by the polls and he's completely trying to reform the country he even said that his drop in popularity is a price worth paying for having reformed his labor markets corporate taxes and more doesn't that tell you everything you need to know about this man he doesn't seem to realize that a deep in popularity isn't just something you have to accept and put up with a dip in popularity means the public don't like what you're doing it's as simple as that isn't it you dip in popularity the people don't like your policies so maybe change track or ask the people what they want politicians are held to account by the people they are servants of the people and Emmanuel macron doesn't seem to realize that and he should be looking to achieve what the voters want and not what he wants French president Emmanuel macron uh said that he would gladly for sure welcome Britain back into the EU if we had a second referendum and voted to rejoin and that comes and make claims by former brexit secretary David Davis that macron is the only person worse than angular Merkel when it comes to wanting to punish the UK and I see macron as everything that's wrong with the European Union he sums up the attitude of the EU perfectly he'll do anything he can to achieve what he wants he doesn't give a damn what the voters think he cares more about long-term results his own words of transforming a country rather than considering what the people of France actually want he said he's willing to accept a dip in the popularity dip in the polls if it means he can get his long-term results and that's exactly how the EU works isn't it well it's exactly why they have unelected leaders actually because without those pesky elections getting in the way every few years they can transform a country or a continent however they like now I think it's time for Teresa made to get tough on these Boies I say it's No Deal or Canada plus that's the way it should be and to be honest I don't really care which way it goes at this point although I am coming around to the idea that maybe in fact we should have No Deal we should consider no dear dear a more favorable option because it'd probably give us more control and an upper hand in our attempts to bring down the EU entirely because maybe our job has gone beyond brakes it now maybe it shouldn't be our job to just get a comfy deal with the EU and leave on our own terms maybe it's our duty to work to bring down this entire dictatorship to free the European nation-states if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
