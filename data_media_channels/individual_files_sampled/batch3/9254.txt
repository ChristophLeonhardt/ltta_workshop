ROUNDS SAYING THE PRESIDENT COULD PARDON HIMSELF BUT HE WOULDN'T. ED HENRY LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE STORY. HI, ED. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP RAISING THE STAKES TONIGHT BECLAIRING THE PERSON COUNSEL PROBE IN HIS WORDS BY DECLARING THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S PROBE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND HE WOULD PARDON HIMSELF IF HE WANTS THERE. MAY BE CLASHES AHEAD WITH MUELLER AND THE CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT AS WELL. THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR HE DOES NOT EXPECT TO PARDON HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAYS HE HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG. CLOSELY MATCHING THE MESSAGE OF THE WEEKEND OF THE LEAD ATTORNEY RUDY GIULIANI WHO RAISED THE SPECTER OF THIS AND THEN ADDED IT'S UNTHINKABLE THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD DO IT BECAUSE IT WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT. THE KEY TRUMP ADVISERS TELL ME AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT GIULIANI IS DOING WITH THE PRESIDENT'S BLESSING IS SIGNALING TO MUELLER THERE IS STILL A SMALL CHANCE OF ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW BUT ONLY IF THE QUESTIONS ARE SEVERELY LIMITED. THIS IS A WARNING SHOT IF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WANTS TO ISSUE A SUBPOENA TO COMPEL THE PRESIDENT TO TESTIFY HE IS READY FOR A BATTLE IN COURT. I CAN TELL YOU THE PRESIDENT OFFERED COMBATIVE TONE AS HE DID A PHONE CALL A SHORT TIME AGO WITH THE MINNESOTA REPUBLICAN PARTY CELEBRATING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF HIS FIRST 500 DAYS IN OFFICE. LISTEN. President Trump: WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AGAINST US AND THE PHONY RUSSIAN WITCH HUNT THAT IS BEING DISCREDITED. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. DISCREDITED DISGRACE. IT'S NOT EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL IN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S OPINION, IN MY OPINION, TOO. AS YOU NOTED THIS BATTLE OF COURSE COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY 20-PAGE MEM ROW THAT IS SENT MEMO SENT TO THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IN JANUARY BUT TWO OF THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL ATTORNEYS AT THE TIME. JOHN DOWD WHO IS NOW OUT AND JAY SEKULOW WHO IS STILL IN. HE SAYS THE PRESIDENT CANNOT ASSERT JUSTICE BUT HAS THE POWER TO SHUT THE INVESTIGATION DOWN WHEN HE WANTS. THE MEMO SAYS THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF DICTATED A STATEMENT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE MISLEADING ABOUT HIS SON DONALD TRUMP JR.'S 2016 MEETING AT THE TRUMP TOWELLER WITH THE RUSSIANS. THAT CONFLICTS WITH SARAH SANDERS. AND WHAT JAY SEKULOW LAST YEAR SAID MINIMIZING THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE DRAFTING THE STATEMENT. I CAN TELL YOU THE FORMER DEPUTY TO INDEPENDENT COUNSEL KEN STARR SAYS THE MEMO IS HELPFUL TO PRESIDENT. WATCH. IT'S THE LEAKING OF THE LETTER WHICH I BELIEVE HAD TO HAVE COME FROM THE CAMP OF THE PRESIDENT THAT I THINK IS SO, SUCH A BRILLIANT MANEUVER. THIS SHOWS A NUMBER OF THINGS. FIRST, IT SHOWS THAT THE MUELLER'S TEAM VIEW OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IS FRIGHTENLY BROAD. Sarah: HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DICTATE. HE WEIGHED IN AND OFFERED SUGGESTION LIKE ANY FATHER WOULD DO. THAT WAS LAST YEAR. TODAY AT THE PODIUM SARAH SANDERS AGAIN SAID THE PRESIDENT DID NOT DICTATE THAT
