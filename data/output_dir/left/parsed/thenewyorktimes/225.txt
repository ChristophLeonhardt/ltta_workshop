I’m not going to put my
lawyer's hat on because
I haven’t had a chance to
examine it as a lawyer.
I’m doing it as a friend
of Donald Trump.
I've known him for 28 years.
I’ve been in every circumstance 
imaginable with him.
I think.
I’ve seen him
with women all the time.
I know men who are
inappropriate and I don't like it.
I’ve never seen him one
time, one time act inappropriate.
I’ve never seen him one
time act inappropriate.
You know you’re
really beautiful.
I'll go backstage
before a show.
And I'm allowed to go in because
I’m the owner of the pageant
and therefore, I’m expecting it.
I’ve never seen him one
time act inappropriate.
I just start kissing them,
it’s like a magnet.
And when you’re a
star they let you do it.
You can do anything.
Whatever you want.
You can do anything.
I’ve never seen him one
time, one time act inappropriate.
This may be the
best of all.
If Ivanka weren't my daughter
perhaps I’d be dating her.
I’ve never seen him one time,
one time,
act inappropriate.
Donald, I thought
you were a gentleman.
You can’t say I didn’t try.
