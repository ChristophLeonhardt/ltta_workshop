00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,548
THE ONE THING YOU COULD SAY IN THE NEGATIVE SENSE IN A WAY THAT

49
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,018
THE NEGATIVE SENSE IN A WAY THAT WAS ACHIEVED IS THAT TRUMP WAS

00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:09,687
>> YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF THINGS GOING ON.

69
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,888
GOING ON. COMPANIES THAT ARE BEING -- THAT

00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,996
YESTERDAY LOWER PRICES. YOU’RE SEEING STOCK PRICES OF

75
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:20,198
YOU’RE SEEING STOCK PRICES OF INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES LIKE

76
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,866
INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES LIKE CATERPILLAR THAT WOULD BE

77
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,567
CATERPILLAR THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS GOING DOWN.

78
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,870
AFFECTED BY THIS GOING DOWN. AND THEN, AS YOU JUST REFERRED

79
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,271
AND THEN, AS YOU JUST REFERRED FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION, YOU

80
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,573
FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION, YOU SAW THIS ENORMOUS BLOW BACK TO

81
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,609
SAW THIS ENORMOUS BLOW BACK TO THE CRAZY IDEA OF PAYING OUR

82
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,044
THE CRAZY IDEA OF PAYING OUR SOYBEAN FARMERS $12 MILLION

83
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,879
SOYBEAN FARMERS $12 MILLION WHICH BLOWBACK CAME MORE FROM

84
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:35,880
WHICH BLOWBACK CAME MORE FROM THE REPUBLICANS AND THE

85
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,016
THE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE IF YOU’RE A

86
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,185
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE IF YOU’RE A SMALL GOVERNMENT REPUBLICAN, HOW

87
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,086
SMALL GOVERNMENT REPUBLICAN, HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY SOMEBODY HANDING

88
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:44,388
CAN YOU JUSTIFY SOMEBODY HANDING OUT $12 BILLION TO A BUNCH OF

89
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:44,722
OUT $12 BILLION TO A BUNCH OF FARMERS?

90
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,324
FARMERS? >> YOU’RE NOT MAKING AMERICA

91
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,426
>> YOU’RE NOT MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN YOU’RE MAKING

92
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,360
GREAT AGAIN YOU’RE MAKING AMERICA 1929, AGAIN.

93
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:50,428
AMERICA 1929, AGAIN. YOU HAVE SOME CHARTS FOR US.

94
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:52,163
YOU HAVE SOME CHARTS FOR US. >> WE HAVE SOME CHARTS TO FILL

95
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:55,033
>> WE HAVE SOME CHARTS TO FILL YOU IN ON WHAT’S GOING ON ON THE

96
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:56,835
YOU IN ON WHAT’S GOING ON ON THE TRADE FRONT WITH EUROPE

97
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,171
TRADE FRONT WITH EUROPE PRINCIPALLY.

98
00:02:59,214 --> 00:02:59,938
PRINCIPALLY. LET’S START WITH TALKING ABOUT

99
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:01,940
LET’S START WITH TALKING ABOUT HAVING A DEFICIT WITH EUROPE.

100
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,641
HAVING A DEFICIT WITH EUROPE. SO, WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS

101
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:06,511
SO, WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE

102
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,346
THAT ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEBT TRADE DEFICITS

103
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,715
SIGNIFICANT DEBT TRADE DEFICITS WITH BASICALLY -- OOPS, WRONG

104
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:11,049
WITH BASICALLY -- OOPS, WRONG COUNTRIES.

105
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,617
COUNTRIES. BASICALLY WITH TWO COUNTRIES.

106
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,653
BASICALLY WITH TWO COUNTRIES. ITALY AND GERMANY.

107
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,021
ITALY AND GERMANY. GERMANY, OF COURSE, PRODUCES A

108
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:18,723
GERMANY, OF COURSE, PRODUCES A LOT OF CARS.

109
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,824
LOT OF CARS. ITALY PRODUCES A LOT OF

110
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,826
ITALY PRODUCES A LOT OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND ALSO SOME

111
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:22,360
PHARMACEUTICALS AND ALSO SOME CARS.

112
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,262
CARS. WHEN YOU DRIVE YOUR FERRARI OUT

113
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:24,929
WHEN YOU DRIVE YOUR FERRARI OUT ON THE WEEKEND.

114
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:27,666
ON THE WEEKEND. >> ONLY WHEN I BORROW YOURS.

115
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:28,567
>> ONLY WHEN I BORROW YOURS. >> ITALIAN SHOES.

116
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:30,969
>> ITALIAN SHOES. >> THERE WE GO.

117
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,104
>> THERE WE GO. SO, BASICALLY, WITH THE REST OF

118
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:36,775
SO, BASICALLY, WITH THE REST OF EUROPE IN THE AGGREGATE WE’RE IN

119
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:37,876
EUROPE IN THE AGGREGATE WE’RE IN A TRADE BALANCE.

120
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,078
A TRADE BALANCE. I WOULD NOTE THAT’S ROUGHLY 15%

121
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:41,680
I WOULD NOTE THAT’S ROUGHLY 15% OF OUR TOTAL DEFICIT.

122
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,515
OF OUR TOTAL DEFICIT. NOT SURPRISINGLY, OF COURSE,

123
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:44,949
NOT SURPRISINGLY, OF COURSE, CHINA IS THE REAL PROBLEM AND

124
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,251
CHINA IS THE REAL PROBLEM AND ISSUES GOING ON WITH CHINA.

125
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,452
ISSUES GOING ON WITH CHINA. SO, THE POINT REALLY IS THAT

126
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:49,554
SO, THE POINT REALLY IS THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL PART

127
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,689
THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL PART OF THE TRADE ISSUE THAT WE’RE

128
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,291
OF THE TRADE ISSUE THAT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT.

129
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,326
TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE

130
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,761
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE BUY AND SELL TO EUROPE, YOU CAN

131
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:59,398
BUY AND SELL TO EUROPE, YOU CAN SEE THAT, IN FACT, IT REALLY

132
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,066
SEE THAT, IN FACT, IT REALLY MIRRORS WHAT THE WHOLE CONCEPT

133
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,602
MIRRORS WHAT THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF TRADE MEANS.

134
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:04,336
OF TRADE MEANS. THAT WE’RE BUYING AND SELLING A

135
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,670
THAT WE’RE BUYING AND SELLING A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS BACK AND

136
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,805
LOT OF THE SAME THINGS BACK AND FORTH TO CHINA.

137
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,675
FORTH TO CHINA. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WE SELL BOEING

138
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:12,778
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WE SELL BOEING AIRPLANES TO CHINA, TO EUROPE.

139
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:16,815
AIRPLANES TO CHINA, TO EUROPE. AND WE BUY AIRBUS PLANES FROM

140
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:17,148
AND WE BUY AIRBUS PLANES FROM EUROPE.

141
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:21,220
EUROPE. WE SELL THINGS LIKE ENGINES AND

142
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,022
WE SELL THINGS LIKE ENGINES AND MOTORS TO EUROPE, WHICH YOU CAN

143
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:23,856
MOTORS TO EUROPE, WHICH YOU CAN SEE HERE.

144
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,825
SEE HERE. AND WE BUY A LOT OF CARS FROM

145
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:28,026
AND WE BUY A LOT OF CARS FROM EUROPE.

146
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:29,795
EUROPE. PHARMA SHOWS UP IN BOTH PLACES.

147
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:33,232
PHARMA SHOWS UP IN BOTH PLACES. WE DO PHARMA BUSINESS WITH

148
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:33,566
WE DO PHARMA BUSINESS WITH EUROPE.

149
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:37,536
EUROPE. THIS IS REALLY THE EPITOME OF

150
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:38,804
THIS IS REALLY THE EPITOME OF WHERE TRADE IS.

151
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:40,239
WHERE TRADE IS. IT IS NOT SIMPLY SOMETHING THEY

152
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,041
IT IS NOT SIMPLY SOMETHING THEY MAKE AND WE DON’T MAKE AND VICE

153
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:42,441
MAKE AND WE DON’T MAKE AND VICE VERSA.

154
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,043
VERSA. AND, LASTLY, LET’S JUST REMEMBER

155
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,678
AND, LASTLY, LET’S JUST REMEMBER WHAT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE

156
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:46,812
WHAT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TARIFFS.

157
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:48,247
TALK ABOUT TARIFFS. THE SIZE OF THE TARIFFS BETWEEN

158
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,219
THE SIZE OF THE TARIFFS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU ARE ACTUALLY

159
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:53,753
THE U.S. AND THE EU ARE ACTUALLY ALMOST IDENTICAL.

160
00:04:53,763 --> 00:04:55,354
ALMOST IDENTICAL. THEY ARE BOTH LESS THAN 2%.

161
00:04:55,398 --> 00:05:03,896
THEY ARE BOTH LESS THAN 2%. THEY ARE ABOUT A TENTH OR 2/10

162
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,766
THEY ARE ABOUT A TENTH OR 2/10 PERCENTAGE POINT DIFFERENT.

163
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,735
PERCENTAGE POINT DIFFERENT. EU AND CANADA HAVE RELATIVELY

164
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:13,072

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,047
BIG TARIFFS ON EXPENSIVE CARS. WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID

00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:57,244
KNOW WHERE IT IS GOING TO GO BECAUSE IT IS A TEMPORARY TRUCE.

221
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,680
BECAUSE IT IS A TEMPORARY TRUCE. WE DON’T KNOW IF IT WILL BE
