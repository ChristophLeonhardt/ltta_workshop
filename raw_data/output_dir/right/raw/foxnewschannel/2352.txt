1
00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:01,146
THINK HE MADE CONTACT.

2
00:00:01,146 --> 00:00:02,289
>> Trace: HE MAY HAVE.

3
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:03,791
JOHN ROBERTS, THANK YOU.

4
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:06,193
I WANT TO BRING IN FOX NEWS

5
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:07,795
SUNDAY ANCHOR CHRIS WALLACE.

6
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:08,951
GET THE TONE GOING ON THIS, GET

7
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:10,497
YOUR OPINION, CHRIS.

8
00:00:10,497 --> 00:00:12,005
REALLY, YOU LOOK AT MACRON, HE

9
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:13,706
CAME IN, GOT THE STATE DINNER,

10
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:15,803
THE PAT ON THE BACK, THE HUG.

11
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:17,861
AND ANGELA MERKEL COMES IN AND

12
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,485
GETS REALLY A HANDSHAKE AND A

13
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:21,408
SANDWICH AND THAT'S IT.

14
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:22,164
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

15
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:23,811
>> I'M SURE IT WAS A NICE

16
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,818
SANDWICH.

17
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:26,513
THE WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN IS

18
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,115
DELICIOUS.

19
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,123
YEAH, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

20
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:30,517
THE PRESIDENT HAS A CLOSER

21
00:00:30,517 --> 00:00:33,498
PERSONAL RELATION.

22
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:35,028
WHAT STRIKES ME ABOUT THIS

23
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,751
ONE-TWO PUNCH BY THE EUROPEAN

24
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,581
UNION, FIRST MACRON, THEN

25
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,729
MERKEL, IS THAT THEY SEEM TO BE

26
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:42,504
GIVING UP A LOT AND THE

27
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:43,330
PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE WILLING TO

28
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,132
ACCEPT IT.

29
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:46,633
REMEMBER WHEN THIS WHOLE THING

30
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,035
STARTED THERE WAS TALK FROM THE

31
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:49,293
EUROPEAN UNION, IT'S THE IRAN

32
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:50,843
DEAL OR NOTHING.

33
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,797
AND NOW, BECAUSE OF THE HARD

34
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:54,345
LINE THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE

35
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,044
TAKING, WHETHER IT'S MACRON OR

36
00:00:57,044 --> 00:00:59,601
MERKEL, THEY SEEM TO BE SAYING

37
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,347
IT'S GOING TO BE THE IRAN DEAL

38
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,048
PLUS.

39
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:02,556
AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE

40
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,351
IRAN DEAL PLUS, THEY'RE TALKING

41
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,053
ABOUT ADDING A SUNSET CLAUSE --

42
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:07,210
THEY'RE TAKING OUT THE SUNSET

43
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,455
CLAUSE.

44
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:09,461
THE CURRENT AGREEMENT, ONLY GOES

45
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,614
TO 2025.

46
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,665
THEN BASICALLY, IRAN CAN DO

47
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:14,968
WHATEVER IT WANTS IN TERMS OF

48
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:16,040
DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

49
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,544
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT THAT.

50
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,365
THEY SEEM TO BE SAYING, THAT'S

51
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,042
OKAY WITH US.

52
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:22,124
THEY ALSO WANT TO HAVE NEW

53
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,927
LIMITS ON BALLISTIC MISSILES AND

54
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:26,273
ALSO SOME KIND OF A STATEMENT

55
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:27,480
ABOUT REGIONAL TROUBLEMAKING BY

56
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,575
IRAN.

57
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:30,232
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A TREATY,

58
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:31,435
IT'S JUST AN AGREEMENT, REMEMBER

59
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:33,689
IT WAS NEVER SUBMITTED TO

60
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,191
CONGRESS, WHAT YOU COULD GET IS

61
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:38,308
NOT ANY SIGN-ON BY IRAN OR ITS

62
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,942
ALLIES AND RUSSIA OR CHINA.

63
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,588
BUT YOU COULD GET THE EUROPEANS

64
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:43,596
AND THE U.S. SAYING, WE'RE GOING

65
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:44,747
TO ADD THESE THREE CONDITIONS

66
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:46,593
AND IF YOU VIOLATE ANY OF THOSE

67
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:47,400
THEN WE'RE GOING TO IMPOSE

68
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,896
SANCTIONS.

69
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:51,198
THAT'S ONE WAY THAT THEY ARE

70
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,800
ABLE TO KEEP THE IRAN NUCLEAR

71
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,157
DEAL BUT ALSO ADD OTHER THINGS

72
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:55,903
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS AND

73
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:57,805
THOSE OTHER ISSUES.

74
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:58,912
>> Trace: YEAH, SO THE IRAN DEAL

75
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,915
IS KIND OF UP IN THE AIR.

76
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:04,068
BUT YOU GO TO NORTH KOREA THING

77
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:07,421
AND YOU LOOK AT KIM JONG-UN

78
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:08,872
MEETING WITH MOON JAE-IN ON THE

79
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:10,074
SOUTH CROW AN SIDE OF THE

80
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:10,473
PENINSULA.

81
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,297
IT'S AMAZING -- SOUTH SIDE OF

82
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:14,078
THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

83
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:16,323
EVEN IF THIS THING ERUPTS IN TEN

84
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:17,980
MINUTES, IT COULD, FOR THIS

85
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,384
MINUTE IT LOOKS LIKE TRUMP

86
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:21,687
REALLY IS KIND OF THE PEACEMAKER

87
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:23,107
IN THIS WHOLE BARGAIN.

88
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:24,431
>> I DON'T KNOW I'D CALL HIM THE

89
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,290
PEACEMAKER.

90
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,436
I WOULD SAY THAT HE HAS BEEN THE

91
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:30,637
MOTIVATING FORCE IN GETTING KIM

92
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:33,648
TO LAUNCH THIS CHARM OFFENSIVE.

93
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:34,842
CLEARLY, A LOT OF US WONDERED

94
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:38,502
ABOUT IT, CLEARLY THE

95
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:41,503
COMBINATION OF THREATS, RAINING

96
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:44,007
FIRE AND FURY ON NORTH CAROLINA,

97
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,854
INSULTS, LITTLE ROCKETMAN, MY

98
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:47,654
NUCLEAR BUTTON IS BIGGER THAN

99
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:49,561
YOURS.

100
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:51,558
UNCONVENTIONAL BUT SEEMS TO HAVE

101
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:52,887
WORKED MAXIMUM PRESSURE,

102
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:53,888
TIGHTENING THE SCREWS IN TERMS

103
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:56,641
OF TRADE AND EXPORTS AND IMPORTS

104
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:58,422
THAT ALL OF THAT HAS AN IMPACT.

105
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:01,174
I PROMISE KIM HAS NOT DECIDED TO

106
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:02,525
SUDDENLY PLAY NICE WITH SOUTH

107
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:04,234
KOREA OR POTENTIALLY THE U.S.

108
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:06,127
BECAUSE HE HAS HAD A CHANGE OF

109
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:06,427
HEART.

110
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:07,025
HE HAS HAD A CHANGE OF

111
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,375
CIRCUMSTANCE.

112
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,830
AND HE NOW FEELS ENOUGH PRESSURE

113
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,578
THAT HE FEELS HE HAS TO CHANGE

114
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:12,633
WHAT HIS PLAN IS.

115
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,788
HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT, AND

116
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:16,691
YOUR SKEPTICISM OR AT LEAST

117
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:20,342
CAUTION IS WELL WARRANTED.

118
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:21,944
PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD HIS

119
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,547
SECRETARY OF STATE MADELINE

120
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,798
ALBRIGHT MEET WITH KIM'S FATHER

121
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:28,795
IN THE '90s, THEY MADE A DEAL,

122
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:30,272
THE NORTH KOREANS BROKE THAT.

123
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:32,099
THE SOUTH KOREANS AND THE NORTH

124
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,606
CROW ANS HAVE MADE DEALS IN THE

125
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:35,911
PAST, NORTH CROW ANS HAVE BROKEN

126
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,304
THOSE AS WELL.

127
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,666
THE KEY TO MY DAYS COVERING

128
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,110
RONALD REAGAN, TRUST BUT VERIFY.

129
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,811
YOU WANT TO ACCEPT AGREEMENTS

130
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:46,813
BUT YOU GOT TO VERIFY THEY'LL

131
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,415
KEEP THEIR WORD.

132
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:49,616
>> Trace: AND GOES BACK TO 2008

133
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:50,918
WHERE THEY SAID THE SAME THING,

134
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,319
WE'LL PULL BACK THE NUCLEAR

135
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,620
WEAPONS, GET RID OF THEM, THEN

136
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,275
THAT LASTED ABOUT A CUP OF

137
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,722
COFFEE.

138
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:57,229
PUSHES US FORWARD, CHRIS, TO

139
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:59,202
THIS SUMMIT BETWEEN THE

140
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:00,527
PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN.

141
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,930
THIS IS NOW PIVOTAL, WHEREVER IT

142
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,787
HAPPENS, IN SINGAPORE OR IN

143
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,289
SWEDEN, THIS THING REALLY IS

144
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:07,791
VERY IMPORTANT.

145
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,744
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT REITERATED

146
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:10,737
TODAY, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

147
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,239
PLAYED LIKE A FIDDLE.

148
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,047
AND, TWO, HE SEEMED TO INDICATE

149
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:17,315
THAT HE'S KIND OF GOT THIS

150
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,571
THING.

151
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:19,947
>> WELL, WE'LL SEE IF HE'S GOT

152
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:21,949
THIS THING.

153
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,827
HE CERTAINLY IS EXPRESSING GREAT

154
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,507
REQUEST AS HE DOES BUT IT TAKES

155
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:27,829
TWO TO MAKE A DEAL.

156
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:30,557
THE KEY HERE IS GOING TO BE WHAT

157
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:32,214
DOES DENUCLEARIZATION MEAN.

158
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:35,918
AND THE SEQUENCING.

159
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:36,670
DENUCLEARIZATION TO THE U.S.

160
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,871
MEANS YOU GIVE UP EVERYTHING,

161
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:40,592
ALL OF YOUR NUKES, ALL OF THE

162
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,924
FACILITY TO MAKE NUCLEAR FUEL

163
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:45,428
AND WEAPONS, GIVE UP YOUR

164
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:46,350
BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM AND

165
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,929
SHIP IT OUT OF THE COUNTRY OR WE

166
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,176
SEE YOU HAVE DESTROYED IT.

167
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,432
THE SENSE ONE GETS FROM

168
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:51,979
REPORTING OUT OF NORTH KOREA IS

169
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,581
THAT THEY'RE THINKING MORE OF

170
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,738
THE DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS

171
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:56,790
FREEZE IN PLACE.

172
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,642
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT US AS A

173
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:01,142
NUCLEAR POWER BUT WE WON'T

174
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:01,888
ADVANCE OUR PROGRAM OR DO MORE

175
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:02,945
TESTING.

176
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:03,690
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THE

177
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,897
PRESIDENT ACCEPTS THAT.

178
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:06,499
THE OTHER QUESTION, SEQUENCING.

179
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:07,995
IS IT THAT THE NORTH KOREANS

180
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:09,896
HAVE TO GO FIRST AND DO

181
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:10,903
EVERYTHING AND THEN THE U.S.

182
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:11,404
LIFTS SANCTIONS?

183
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:12,899
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE HARD

184
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,556
FOR THE NORTH KOREANS TO ACCEPT.

185
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:17,123
THEY MAY SAY WE'LL TAKE STEP A

186
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:19,127
AND YOU LIFT SANCTIONS, WE TAKE

187
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:21,964
STEP B, YOU LIFT MORE SANCTIONS.
