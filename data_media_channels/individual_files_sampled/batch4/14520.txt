the much-anticipated movie first man the true story of Neil Armstrong the first human ever to step foot on the moon made its landing in theaters this movie had it all great actors incredible performances visionary directing breathtaking special effects an incredible source material it only missed one thing why I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood first man is the fourth movie by the director Damien Chazelle and his short movie lists have all been Oscar gold and first man will be no different so most importantly does this movie live up to its potential masterpiece or fall short on its lunar landing as a viewer I give first man a four out of five and minor spoilers at Ryan Gosling's minimalist audition tape in the movie Drive has set him up to play every leading introspective man for the next 10 years and in a movie that has almost shot entirely in close-up shots you need someone with the charisma the stillness and the control of Ryan Gosling he absolutely knocks this out of the park and also the feelings created by Damien in this movie were incredible you feel the claustrophobia you feel the awe you feel the captivation you get that small taste of what the astronauts actually would have felt the practical effects were just awesome and much like the movie Mission Impossible Fallout or gravity this is a movie you definitely want to go see in theaters as a critic I give it a four out of five I really wanted to give this movie a five out of five because it really is a work of art the characters are complex the stakes are high the production is top-notch it has everything you want from a cinematic movie but it leaves out one key detail to drive the story why one of the greatest war movies of all time Saving Private Ryan balanced this really well each man had their reasons their own individual motivations to drive them in the missions but they all shared the same overall cause the same y the same backdrop it was to win the war for freedom that was why they were there they weren't just a bunch of individuals they wanted to go out there and shoot and run and gun and the movie would have suffered if they had just done it that way now in first man each individual character is complex they have their own reasons and motivations for doing something but the movie fails to give you the overall reason for doing so JFK made this reason clear in his famous moonray speech and every historian on this topic will tell you the reason why we went there and what meant including Roger el Linus the senior curator for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum he said quote the driving reason was the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union without that it wouldn't have happened unquote and this goes back to the flag planting controversy in the movie and in not including that specific scene in that motivation you remove the why they completely gloss over the Cold War and why they just start talking about look we have to get to the moon first we have to show the world why why did something risk need to be taken why did somebody lives need to be lost and this is highlighted halfway through the movie when you have protesters in the Vietnam War saying why are we spending billions on NASA like what I can't even eat people are going to the moon and I don't have a job it's because they never addressed the why it was a war of ideology as it was freedom first communism men gave their lives to win the hearts of the world we needed to show people that the greatest potential released for mankind was through freedom not produced by the crushing gears of communism and if they have kept that simple backdrop that simple motivation of why everything would have fallen into place so perfectly however because they chose not to many of these missions and the people themselves come off as a bit masochistic delusional or selfish spending all this blood and resources for what pride and rather having that theme be the drive of the mission and why we're doing in the first place and then having each individual character's motivation interpersonal struggles be highlighted to make it awesome they try to build on the drive of innovation and expanding horizons in science they literally take time the movie to show the astronauts collecting moon dust sorry no we didn't spend billions of dollars in decades and resources so we could go collect dust on the moon Neil was not sent there to collect moon dust he was there to plant a flag of freedom for the world to see my faith in values is a three out of five there really aren't any blanket value shown in the movie and again most the characters in the movie come off as a bit selfish because there's no overarching motivation for them but you do get to see Neil push forward a bit for his fellow man he loves and cares deeply for his daughter and you really get to see a man determined however it still comes off a bit selfish because you get to see the divide between he and his wife their little distance shown between he and his sons because again they don't show the selfless reasons why other than his own personal goals to get there overall this is a great movie to watch in theaters go check it out I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood did you enjoy that video of course you enjoyed that video so now you need to become a Premium Member to the rebel that way you have first
