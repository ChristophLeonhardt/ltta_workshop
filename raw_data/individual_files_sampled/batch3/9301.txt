Tucker: BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS WIFE ASHLEY APPEARED ON "THE STORY" WITH MARTHA MacCALLUM AN HOUR AGO AND HE DENIED ALL ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT RALLIED AGAINST HIM. Judge Kavanaugh: I'VE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE, NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT EVER. I'VE TREATED EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN THE BEST FOR MY WHOLE LIFE, THE WOMEN WHO HAVE KNOWN ME SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. THEY SIGNED A LETTER FROM HIGH SCHOOL SAYING I ALWAYS TREATED THEM WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. Tucker: KAVANAUGH'S WIFE CAME TO HIS DEFENSE AS WELL. I KNOW BRETT, I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR 17 YEARS AND THIS IS NOT AT ALL IT'S REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE. HE'S DECENT AND KIND AND GOOD, I AND I KNOW HIS HEART. THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH BREAD. BRETT. THEY LOOK IN PAIN, BOTH OF THEM. Martha: WATCHING IT AGAIN, THIS IS REALLY HARD FOR THEM AND I FELT LIKE THEY WERE BOTH KIND OF JUST TAMPING DOWN THE TEARS. THEY WERE THIS CLOSE TO CRYING. I THINK THIS IS OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY EMOTIONALLY DEVASTATING. I THINK THEY THOUGHT AND WE ALL THOUGHT THAT FIRST DAY AT THE HEARING WHEN DEMOCRATS TRIED TO SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE HEARING THAT IT COULDN'T REALLY GET ANY WORSE THAN THAT, THEN THEY THINK THEY ARE ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND SUDDENLY THOSE ACCUSATIONS START COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK. I THINK IT WOULD WREAK HAVOC ON ANYBODY. THEY SEEM VERY SOLID TOGETHER AND VERY UNITED IN THE EFFORT. I SAID TO THEM, AT SOME POINT DON'T YOU SAY, FORGET IT. IT'S NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE, IT'S TOO PAINFUL. BUT THAT'S NOT AN OPTION. Tucker: FOR A JOB THAT PAYS LESS THAN THE AVERAGE LAWYER SOMETIMES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR CHILDREN, WHICH WE HAVE HAD TO HAVE. ON BROADER TERMS, FOR OUR YOUNGEST. BUT THEY KNOW, IT'S BRETT AND THAT THEY THE TRUTH. AND WE TOLD THEM AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS, THIS WILL BE NOT FUN SOMETIMES. PEOPLE FEEL STRONGLY AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT. JUST REMEMBER, YOU KNOW YOUR DA DAD. Tucker: I BET THOSE GIRLS WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THIS. Martha: HOW COULD THEY BE? YOU CAN IMAGINE AT THEIR AGE, THEY ARE AT AGES TEN AND 12 IN THAT AGE, I'M SURE IT'S DEVASTATING FOR THEM. I ASKED HIM SPECIFICALLY POINT BLANK ABOUT ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND WE TALKED ABOUT THEM IN VERY SPECIFIC, GRAPHIC TERMS. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO KIND OF FRAME THAT ISSUE, BUT SHE ALSO SAID, THEY KNOW THEIR DAD. EVEN IN THE BEGINNING WHEN HE GOT ROUGHED UP IN THAT FIRST DAY, HE SAID HIS DAUGHTER CAME DOWN AND GAVE THEM A HUG THAT NIGHT. AND THE ALLEGATIONS ARE WHAT THEY ARE, HE'S GOING TO FACE THAT ON THURSDAY. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT FOR THEM. Tucker: WHEN CLARENCE THOMAS WAS APPROVED AND OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR IN 1991, HE MADE A DECISION THAT HE WAS GOING TO FIGHT BACK IN A VERY TOUGH WAY. HE WAS NOT GOING TO GO DOWN. DO YOU THINK KAVANAUGH HAS MADE THAT DECISION? Martha: KAVANAUGH WAS NOT IN CLARENCE THOMAS FIGHTING SHAPE TODAY. AND WHEN HE BASICALLY LEVELED THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, IT'S SO POWERFUL. THAT'S NOT THE FRAME OF MIND THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH APPEARED TO BE IN TODAY, ALTHOUGH HE MAY BE THAT MOOD ON THURSDAY. HE ASKED HIM SEVERAL TIMES, YOU SAY THIS IS ALL FALSE, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEHIND THIS? WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS IS COMING FROM? IS THERE SOME KIND OF POLITICAL VENDETTA AGAINST YOU THAT'S BEING PLAYED OUT? WE ALL KNOW THE CORNERS THAT COULD BE COMING FROM BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO GO THERE AT ALL. HE DOESN'T WANT TO CONJECTURE ABOUT ANY OF THAT. AND CLARENCE THOMAS CLEARLY CALLED IT WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS. A HIGH-TECH LYNCHING AND HE THOUGHT THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAD SUNK TO SUCH LOWS TO ENTERTAIN SOME OF THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM, THAT THEY ENTERTAINED. THAT WAS HIS FEELING, AND THEY PERSEVERED.
