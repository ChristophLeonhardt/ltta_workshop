00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,760
Hi everyone. So, it's been a little while and I have a lot to talk about

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,380
but today I want to talk about creativity. Again.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,420
So while I've been taking a little break from making videos,  I've been travelling for work,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,720
and I've been focussing on my mental health

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,680
and just generally trying to create an atmosphere of supportive self care, etc., etc.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,380
But in that time, I have also been SnapChatting a lot. My SnapChat is rosiannahr.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,480
and I use SnapChat a lot in general, but I feel like in the time that I was away,

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,680
I was using it more as a vlogging place, whereas before, I was using it as a, I don't know,

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,280
supplementary vlogging place.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,420
I was talking a lot about the way I feel, and the day-to-day progression,

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,260
and just what's on my mind, in longer and longer SnapChats, in a way that...

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,460
Yeah, I think that replaced the space that I usually use this for,

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,560
and I don't think that's a permanent thing, I think that's just a function of it.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,220
But it had me connect to a line of thinking connected to my dad.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,260
It made me think a lot about something that my day used to do, and something that I think I

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,840
learned from him or picked up from him, I don't really know that it was a learning point, I think it was more of a...

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,800
sometimes potentially not great crutch, in some ways.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,540
So quick aside for those of you who are new here, my dad passed away nearly 5 years ago

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,120
and that means that a lot of my thinking is informed by that discussion, is infomed by grief,

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,980
but is also informed by a sort of perspective on that relationship and what I've learnt

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,960
that I think is partly due to adulthood but is also due to having

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,380
a distance and a certain completeness to that relationship

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,800
that yeah, that informs that sorts of thinking.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,740
My dad loved technology, particularly Apple, he always got very excited when a new product came out,

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,840
and he was always about new and interesting ways that technology creates and fills needs in our lives.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,460
and the way that we work with technology and sort of work against technology

27
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,260
but particularly work with technology. I think he always saw technology as something that enabled a lot and made a lot possible.

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,900
Of course in some some ways I saw a shift in this, where he had once been a expert on computers.

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,620
Around 2000, 2002, you suddenly saw the job market change and much younger people were hired

30
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,180
and there just weren't the positions for him that there had been

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,419
he wasn't in the position of power that he had been.

32
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,580
Because despite being someone who knew computers very well,

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,340
and knew project management on computers very well, he just couldn't

34
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,140
quite speak the language people were looking for,

35
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,740
he just wasn't quite the age that they wanted, like they wanted to be able to mold employees

36
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,580
or grow employees and he didn't quite fit that description.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,600
So it was a bit of a shift, I think, looking back on how, yeah, how technology almost

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,060
replaced him in some way, or replaced the space he used to occupy.

39
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,820
It didn't crush his love of technology at all, but I was thinking about his love of gadgets

40
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,420
because he used to have a really good approach to technology and need for it

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,580
but then as he was able to do a bit less, found technology to be this sort of

42
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:01,220
excuse for what he wasn't able to do and I found that I mimicked that in my adolescence

43
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,520
and part of that comes from being able to have access to technology

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,060
and access to the internet and things like that

45
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,840
But part of that is also evident even if you don't necessarily have the money for it

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,960
and kind of spending beyond your means in that respect

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
because you somehow put an object, put this thing in your life,

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,780
as the thing that is going to make other things possible.

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,600
So an example of that is that I very much always thought that having a laptop meant that I would

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:35,200
be able to write more and create more. And in fact, to this day, I still write the most creatively in a notebook.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,380
I struggle to think in the same way when I'm typing that I do in a notebook.

52
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,500
Now of course having a laptop has made a lot of other creativity possible,

53
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,420
And that's kind of the flip side, um, of it, it has given me a different form of connection,

54
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,000
it has given, maybe, the breadth of my creativity a different angle.

55
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,520
But it has not facilitated that writing in that way that I thought it would.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,660
It has done wonderful things in terms of what I didn't know it was going to do.

57
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,140
I guess it hasn't taken away that need to motivate myself rather than creating it from something external.

58
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,780
Now that's not a universal thing, of course if we are able to get people

59
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,860
lights so that they can study, or write, or draw, or whatever it is in the evening

60
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,720
who don't have access to that at the moment.

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,860
If we can get them materials, that is a different situation.

62
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,120
But the thinking that I think I see more and more, and that is reinforced by advertising

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,000
and maybe lifestyle focus culture, is the thinking that I won't be able to do x thing,

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,720
until I have y thing. And so we, again, become the adverts for this weird formula.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,340
Towards the end of this life, and we didn't know that it was the end of his life,

66
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,120
but but in that period, especially of the last few years,

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,620
I got so frustrated with him because I would find my dad just, just coming home having bought this other

68
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,840
ridiculous, weird thing. And often it was cool software, it was Dragon Dictate, it was Rosetta Stone, it was

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,740
this thing that converted records into mp3s, there was great suff in there, but it was this,

70
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,540
in retrospect, trying to fill this void of what we can do and what we can make possible,

71
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,220
this feeling that purchasing something as the same as doing something.

72
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,320
It's something that I've just had to be so, so cognizant of, and so aware of,

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,180
like, it's so easy for me to creep something into my head, like, 'oh, maybe I'll get a vlogging camera.

74
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,900
Because that will make vlogging more possible.' I have more than enough options to do more vlogging,

75
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,240
I have, I am so fortunate, I am so privileged to have access to so many different things,

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,300
so then it just comes to me recognizing for myself, actually, that's not the issue.

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,420
The issue is time management, the issue is prioritizing, the issue is, ah, willpower,

78
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,980
the issue is x, y, z, it's so many different things, but it's not the thing itself.

79
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,000
But I think it will help me become a better creator, not just on YouTube,

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,160
but across my approach to everything, every aspect of my life,

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,560
if I stop pretending that having something will solve my problem because I'm not in that position of like, dire need.

82
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,900
In many ways I feel really weird making this video because I feel like I'm not -

83
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,240
had I made this video maybe 3 or 4 years ago, it would almost be more valid

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,580
and it's sort of something being like, "oh, I'm on the other side of this and I'm realizing that

85
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,840
you don't need all this stuff to make loads of videos'.

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,080
So on many levels, I completely get it if you choose to dismiss me out of hand.

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,840
For many of us, we replace action with purchasing, and of course purchasing is an action in itself,

88
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,060
but we see that as doing the task. And we see that as completing the making.

89
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,080
And I don't think that that is always the case. I think that there is something that can facilitate something else

90
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,660
that can make that making possible, but I don't think that it is, in and of itself, a making,

91
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,800
and I think that's the weird little conclusion that I've come to. Through some line of thinking,

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,220
my dad, and then me, in many ways mirroring that behavior, saw the buying as the making.

93
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,140
It just wasn't. It's a weird little world, and it's not the number 1 priority,

94
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,160
it's not the number 1 problem, but I think that being able to disassociate myself from that line of thinking

95
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,420
has made me a much less materialistic person and has made it possible for me to

96
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,960
to make all these steps towards that enlightening, that albatross. And just living with less,

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,100
and living a more open, a more open life in so many ways.

98
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,320
So that was today, I would love to hear your thoughts on this below, feel free to completely disagree with me,

99
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,920
and really of course feel free to run wild with any thought, but my, my main question is

100
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:25,940
for you, have you ever been at a point in your life where buying and making have felt like the same thing,

101
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,000
and your general thoughts on that, I would say. That's where I wanna end it today,

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,160
Um, I hope you're all doing well. I'm really hoping that now I feel more like,

103
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,780
up to it, you know? Space camp is back on,

104
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,980
we'll see how it goes, I might see you tomorrow but I might see you in a week. Who knows, just keeping you guys on your toes.

105
00:07:41,980 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a lot of rhyming going on, completely accidentally. I'll speak to you soon. Bye!
