bringing right now from Capitol Hill member of the Intelligence Committee independent senator angus King of Maine who coincidentally in his first race for governor had bumper stickers had said thank you to chairman Kim they loved Kim and Bangor now come on now I so first of all we want to get through yesterday you talked Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook Sheryl Sandberg during a hearing we're gonna get to that amount solutely first what's your response to the president's tweet his he says thank you to chairman Kim we will get it done together well I think it points out one of the real problems is a lack of historical knowledge and grounding this is the fifth time we've been around this dance with North Korea every time they talk about denuclearization we make some concessions they get something going and then they back away from it so the idea of declaring victory or even progress at the the thin level that we're at now is it's dangerous in the sense and I think one of your guests just mentioned this it sets up expectations that I just don't think can be met what worries me is what happens when the president realizes that this is indeed not going to work and I hope it does by the way I want to emphasize that I hope it does it might Kim might be a different guy than his father and his grandfather but if it doesn't then where are we and and do we get a lurch from maybe too much optimism to to some kind of military strike which would be you know incredibly dangerous if you talk to anybody anybody in the Pentagon so that's what's worrisome about this is this high expectation the kind of exuberance and then inevitably at least based on history there's going to be a letdown right yeah and if you were watching the show earlier see a former CIA director Brennan I was talking about not just the president tweeting something like this but a massive deflection in light of this op-ed that came out in the New York I'm sorry Chris Bella I just want to ask you a question then you can take it to the senator is there any reaction on Capitol Hill to the op-ed in the New York Times reached out to sources on both sides of the aisle last night mica the Democrats were happy to let the op-ed quote speak for itself Republicans very quiet with one notable exception senator bob Corker who I think really summarized in general what the issue has been all along on Capitol Hill with the reaction or lack of reaction to Trump he said this is quote what all of us understood from day one and it's why we've encouraged the good people like mattis to stay and that I thank him every time I see him but in a way this also in capital encapsulate the problem maker right is that no one including this author is willing to speak out on the record I was thinking about this last night and the fact that none of us can really name a single administration official who's either resigned in protest or been pushed out and then spoken out and given information on the record put their name their reputation out there right for the American people to see and to the extent though that this is a shifting point on Capitol Hill I do think it reflects the same sentiment and emotions that a lot of Republicans are having right now ahead of the midterms as they look at these plummeting numbers and they get start to get this gut sense that perhaps this is really going to hurt and in a way that may be worse than just losing the house Wow so senator King you've actually said as we talk about this op-ed that was published by the New York Times when you vote on Trump appointees you've considered the adult in the room factor that is to say you want somebody who will push back against president Trump's impulses so what's your reaction to what you read in The New York Times yesterday well I've taken some flak for voting for some of those nominees particularly on the foreign policy side but that was the driving piece of my decision I wanted to be sure that there were people there who could provide some rational argument some resistance some as they say resistance to what otherwise might be impulsive acts I think and and I disagree a little bit with your reporter if this person came forward and said who they were they'd be fired immediately and we will have lost a restraint a rail if you will a guardrail I think some of these people in this administration particularly at the upper levels are they're making a very difficult career decision they're saying I'm going to be tainted by this I don't like being involved with what's going on on the other hand if I leave what's going to be the what's going to be the guardrail and and and where do we go from from here and I I think this whoever this person is and I don't know who it is but they're there they've made a very difficult choice at least thus far to try to be protective of the national interest senator on another topic yesterday Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg appeared before the Senate Twitter Facebook talk about difficult choices Twitter is doing something to the culture that has been unheard of obviously I mean you know people on their phones looking at it what's going to happen is it gonna be regulated where are you going on this I don't think so I hope not I I'm not a I think we should try to start regulating through the internet it's I don't know where that stops I I would much rather and I think the hearing yesterday was a was a really kind of interesting one from the point of view of what goes on up here if you were watching from the audience you couldn't tell who were Republicans and who were Democrats on the committee it was more like a working group trying to jointly confront and solve a problem which is the misuse of social media particularly by foreign adversaries so I think a lot of it and it this is this is uncharted territory this is a new technology we have to try to figure out how to prevent it being misused particularly as I say by by adversaries from around the world at the same time we don't want to create constraints on the vigorous debate about about issues and by the way before I forget I just want to tell Jon Meacham I'm just finishing a soul of America think it's one of the most important books been published in this country in the last few years John thank you it's a real contribution to what's going on now and putting it in historical perspective I I couldn't resist having this opportunity need that correction snap the picture I'll be voting I'll be voting absentee in Maine King thank you very much for being on the
