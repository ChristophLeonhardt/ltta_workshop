00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
the guy to negotiate with and in the in

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,019
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> administration was the vice</font>

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:12,150
president not the president the

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,250
president's like every kid we knew in

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,809
every class along<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,970
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the smartest guy in the</font>

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,369
room and needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share that with you</font>

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,199
on a frequent basis I know the

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,609
president's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smart guy but I always</font>

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a waste of time for him</font>

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,750
to try to describe what I felt in my

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,119
presence it was a grading an irritating

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,360
characteristic which is why they did the

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,940
guy to negotiate with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,649
administration<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the vice president</font>

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,390
not the president really effective

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,030
leaders are good listeners and when I've

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,410
been around the president he's not

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,719
particularly interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in listening</font>

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,329
he's more interested in pointing out his

21
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,770
point of view why don't you get a drink

22
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,489
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mitch McConnell they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked really</font>

23
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,840
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't you get a drink</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with Mitch</font>

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,359
McConnell with Biden you didn't waste a

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,850
lot of time talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we knew</font>

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,159
we would never agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> on I didn't lecture</font>

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,260
him he didn't lecture me we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,670
the areas where there was possible

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,860
agreement and were able to get to an

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,119
outcome a very different experience from

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,729
being in a negotiating setting with the

32
00:01:17,729 --> 00:00:00,000
president
