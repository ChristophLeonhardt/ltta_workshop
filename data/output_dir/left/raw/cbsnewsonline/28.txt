1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,039
ON THE FRONT END BETTER. 

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,340
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, IT DOES 

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,508
NOT SERVE THE COUNTRY WELL WHEN 

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,509
WE HAVE THESE RAZOR THIN 

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,543
MARGINS, APPROVAL OF A SUPREME 

6
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:14,180
COURT JUSTICE OR APPROVAL OF 

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,880
LEGISLATION OR CABINET NOMINEE. 

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,516
WE HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE 

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,917
WE ARE BACK TO SIMPLE 

10
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,819
MAJORITIES, THERE'S A VOICE FOR 

11
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,221
THE MODERATE AND INCENTIVE TO 

12
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:26,993
BE PART OF THAT, THERE'S MORE 

13
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:27,594
COLLABORATION AND WORKING 

14
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:27,861
TOGETHER. 

15
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,795
OTHERWISE I FEAR FOR THE 

16
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,029
COUNTRY AND THE DOWNWARD VIRAL 

17
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,631
WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICAL 

18
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,966
DISCOURSE AND DISCUSSION ABOUT 

19
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,568
POLICIES IMPACTING MILLIONS OF 

20
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,337
PEOPLE'S LIVES EVERY DAY. 

21
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:52,885
MUCH LESS THE SUPREME COURT AND 

22
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:53,786
ALL THE THINGS THAT WILL COME 

23
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,121
BEFORE IT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 

24
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:55,387
DECADES. 

25
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:56,623
>> LESLIE, IT IS HARD TO DENY, 

26
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,057
IT IS A GOOD WEEK FOR PRESIDENT 

27
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,259
TRUMP, HE ACCOMPLISHED A GREAT 

28
00:00:59,259 --> 00:00:59,492
DEAL. 

29
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,360
HIS BIGGEST IS THE SUPREME 

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,194
COURT NOMINEE, A CAMPAIGN 

31
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,328
PROMISE HE MADE FOR SOME TIME 

32
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:02,629
NOW. 

33
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,530
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD 

34
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,596
NUMEROUS SUCCESSES THAT DO NOT 

35
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:05,798
GET TALKED ABOUT A LOT, THERE'S 

36
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:06,933
USUALLY A CLOUD AROUND THEM, 

37
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,234
THE BOTTOM LINE, HE MANAGES TO 

38
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,636
EXECUTE UPON THEM AND DELIVER 

39
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:17,143
ON THOSE CAMPAIGN PROMISES, NOT 

40
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,477
SOMETHING YOU SEE IN WASHINGTON 

41
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:19,579
AND HE DOES IT WITH SHARP 

42
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:19,812
ELBOWS. 

43
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:20,613
WE HAVE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS 

44
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:21,814
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT HIS 

45
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:22,849
CHARACTER AND STYLE, UNORTHODOX 

46
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,116
APPROACH. 

47
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,350
WHEN IT CAME TO THIS ISSUE, HE 

48
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,385
PUSHED AHEAD DESPITE THE FEW 

49
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,686
TIMES HE WAS WAFFLING ON JUDGE 

50
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,021
KAVANAUGH, I JUST MET HIM A FEW 

51
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,421
WEEKS AGO. 

52
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,357
ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE WAS NOT 

53
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,026
INVITED TO THE PARTY ANYMORE. 

54
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,595
BECAUSE OF THIS AND WHAT WE 

55
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,965
HEARD EARLIER, REPUBLICANS GOT 

56
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:51,678
ENERGIZED, THEY CAME TOGETHER, 

57
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,211
ESTABLISHED REPUBLICANS, 

58
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:52,845
CONSERVATIVES, WOMEN, THEY DID 

59
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,214
NOT WANT TO SEE A JUDGE TREATED 

60
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:54,480
UNFAIRLY. 

61
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,448
THAT LOOKS GOOD ON THE 

62
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,549
POLITICAL MAP, NOW YOU WILL SEE 

63
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,083
A CONFIRMATION. 

64
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,284
THE REAL QUESTION IS IF THE 

65
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,319
ENERGY IS MAINTAINED, I BELIEVE 

66
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,887
IT WILL BE ON THE LEFT, ON THE 

67
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,821
RIGHT, THEY HAVE SEEN THE 

68
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,223
SUCCESS WITH THE PRESIDENT. 

69
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,892
>> MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU 

70
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,926
LOOKING AT THE NEXT COUPLE 

71
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,461
WEEKS FOR MIDTERMS? 

72
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,794
>> I'M WATCHING TO SEE IF THE 

73
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:11,831
ENERGY WE HAVE SEEN STAYS IN 

74
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:17,604
PLACE AND HOW IT CHANGES. 

75
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,705
IT CAN ALL TURN AROUND, WHO 

76
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,706
KNOWS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL 

77
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,439
SAY TOMORROW. 

78
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:20,806
WE DON'T KNOW. 

79
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:28,648
SOMEBODY SMART SAID, A WEEK AGO,

80
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,083
DEMOCRATS WERE AT A NINE ON A 

81
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,284
10 SCALE, REPUBLICANS 6 1/2. 

82
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:37,190
NOW REPUBLICANS ARE 8 1/2, 

83
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,191
CLOSE TO CLOSING THE GAPS. 

84
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,425
IF THAT STATES THE CASE, IT 

85
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,426
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR 

86
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,261
DEMOCRATS TO TAKE THE SENATE, 

87
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,362
THEHOUSE IS GONE FOR 

88
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,863
REPUBLICANS, IT MAKES THE RACE 

89
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:44,731
MORE COMPETITIVE. 

90
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,732
WILL THE PASSION STAY? 

91
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:46,999
I HEARD REPUBLICAN SAY, I'M 

92
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,436
WORRIED, AFTER THE WIN COMES, 

93
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,204
ASSUMING IT DOES, REPUBLICANS 

94
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:57,677
MAY SAY GOOD AND GO HOME AND GO 

95
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,611
BACK TO WATCHING FOOTBALL WHICH 

96
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,512
IS MORE FUN THAN WATCHING 

97
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,747
POLITICS AND THEY DO NOT SHOW 

98
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,347
UP IN NOVEMBER. 

99
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,916
>> MICHAEL GRAHAM, LESLIE 

100
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,319

>>> KAVANAUGH APPEARS TO HAVE 

110
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:19,585
ENOUGH VOTES TO BE CONFIRMED 

111
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,453
AFTER TWO LAWMAKERS CONFIRMED 

112
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,153
THEIR SUPPORT FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 

113
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,622

REPUBLICAN REVIEWED HIS 

125
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,442
JUDICIAL RECORD AND LOOKED OVER 

126
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:51,284
THE FBI INQUIRY AND TESTIMONY 

127
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:51,984
OF DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY 

128

129
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:54,220
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN THEY WERE 

130
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,520
TEENAGERS.

THE CERTAINTY WAS NOT THERE. 

133
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,090
>> THE FOUR WITNESSES SHE NAMED 

134
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,259
COULD NOT CORROBORATE ANY OF 

135
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,527

AMONG REPUBLICANS, THE GENERAL 

183

00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,344
DEMOCRATS WERE DEFLATED, JOE 

187
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,781
MANCHIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING 

188
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:06,752
TO VOTE WITH DONALD TRUMP. 

189
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,653
HE USUALLY COMES THROUGH AT THE 

190
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,088
END OF THE DAY FOR DEMOCRATS. 

191
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,790
YOU LOOK AT THE AFFORDABLE CARE 

192
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,758
ACT REPEAL EFFORTS OR THE TAX 

193
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:17,029
BILL, THIS WAS A KICK IN THE 

194
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,100
TEETH, 30 DAYS BEFORE TITLE 

195
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,333
ACTION. 

196
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,735
>> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, 

197
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,536
WHAT DETERMINED JOE MANCHIN TO 

198
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,503
COME FORWARD AND VOTE YES? 

199
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,738
WAS IT THE VOTE OF COLLINS? 

200
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,573
WHY DO YOU THINK HE CHOSE TO 

201
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,074
COME FORWARD? 

202
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,543
>> IT IS HARD TO SAY. 

203
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,613
IT'S UNDENIABLE THERE'S A 

204
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,212
POLITICAL ASPECT TO IT, WHEN 

205
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:37,116
THE VOTE  WAS DECIDED, PICK A 

206
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:37,616
WINNER. 

207
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:41,587
WHAT HE WAS SAYING YESTERDAY IN 

208
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,155
HIS INTERVIEW WITH CNN, I 

209
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,690
BELIEVE DOCTOR FORD, I DON'

210
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,694
BELIEVE IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

211
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:53,199
I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED. 

212
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,233
THERE IS A QUESTION OF 

213
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,034
PRECEDENT AND STANDARD OF 

214
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,435
EVIDENCE, WHAT DOES IT TAKE OR 

215
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,770
NOT TAKE TO DISQUALIFY A 

216
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,139
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE? 

217
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,774
I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

218
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:07,580
KNOW HOW POPULAR DONALD TRUMP 

219
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,015
IS, HE WON BY 42 POINTS, HE 

220
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,583
REMAINS POPULAR IN THE STATE. 

221
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,650
WE SAW SUPPORT DIP NATIONALLY, 

222
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,085
THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY 

223
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,120
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE 

224
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,023
PRESIDENT, NOMINATE SUPREME 

225
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:17,456
COURT JUSTICES. 

226
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,225
AT THE END OF THE DAY DOSE 

227
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,629
>> WE WANT TO INTERRUPT TO TAKE 

228
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,098
YOU TO SENATOR SCHUMER ON THE 

229
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,601
SENATE FLOOR MAKING A SPEECH. 

230
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,769
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT 

231
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,804
BELONG ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE 

232
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:36,943
WAS CHOSEN BY A PRESIDENT AND 

233
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:37,643
FAR RIGHT ORGANIZATION, BOTH 

234
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,578
DEDICATED TO OVERTURNING AND 

235
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,846
UNDERMINING ROE V WADE AND HE 

236
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,550
DID NOTHING TO REFUTE THE 

237
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,785
PRESUMPTION HE WOULD WANT TO 

238
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,721
OVERTURN IT TOO. 

239
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,789
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 

240
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,624
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE WAS 

241
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:56,762
CHOSEN BY FAR RIGHT 

242
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,064
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BENT ON 

243
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:58,531
REPEALING HEALTHCARE 

244
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,632
PROTECTIONS FOR AMERICANS WITH 

245
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,833
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND HE 

246
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,669
DID NOTHING TO REFUTE THE 

247
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,438
PRESUMPTION HE WOULD TOO. 

248
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,307
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 

249
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:12,078
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE BELIEVES

250
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,212
PRESIDENTS SHOULD NOT BE 

251
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:13,846
SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATIONS OF 

252
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,883
AN KIND WHILE IN OFFICE. 

253
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,384
A DISTORTION OF OUR FOUNDING 

254
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,920
PRINCIPAL. 

255
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,155
NO PERSON IS ABOVE THE LAW. 

256
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,891
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 

257
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,028
IN THE BENCH BECAUSE HIS 

258
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:34,467
JURISPRUDENCE IS DEEPLY 

259
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,067
SKEPTICAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL 

260
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:35,968
PROTECTIONS, CONSUMER 

261
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,602

TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS WITH 

264
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,776
NATIVE AMERICANS AND A HOST OF 

265
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,312
OTHER HARD EARNED RIGHTS. 

266
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,313
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 

267
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,382
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE HAS 

268
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:52,818
REPEATEDLY MISLED THE SENATE, 

269
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,653
PUTTING INTO SERIOUS DOUBT HIS 

270
00:10:54,653 --> 00:11:00,092
CREDIBILITY AND A JUDGE MUST BE 

271
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,260
CREDIBLE, BELIEVABLE, AND HONEST

272
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,395
, ABOVE ALL. 

273
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:10,503
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 

274
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,004
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE HE IS AN 

275
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,005
EXTREME PARTISAN, SOMETHING WE 

276
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,739
HAVE SEEN FROM HIS EARLIEST 

277
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,241
DAYS IN HIS CAREER. 

278
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,175
AND RECONFIRMED WHEN HE GAVE 

279
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,044
ONE OF THE BITTEREST, MOST 

280
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,079
PARTISAN TESTIMONIES EVER 

281
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,717
PRESENTED BY A NOMINEE. 

282
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,885
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG 

283
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,752
ON THE BENCH BECAUSE OF HIS 

284
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:30,790
DEMEANOR, HIS PARTISAN CREED 

285
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,059
WILL GO DOWN IGNOMINIOUSLY IN 

286
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,662
HISTORY AND MADE IT CLEAR IT 

287
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,330
WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE 

288
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,001
FOR HIM TO RULE IMPARTIALLY 

289
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,436
FROM THE SUPREME COURT. 

290
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:47,006
JUDGES MUST BE TEMPERAMENT, 

291
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,642
JUDICIOUS, EVENHANDED. 

292
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,544
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ANYTHING BUT 

293
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:57,883
THAT. 

294
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,418
REPUBLICAN LEADERS KNEW BEFORE 

295
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,988
HE WAS NOMINATED, JUDGE 

296
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,389
KAVANAUGH WAS A FLAWED CHOICE. 

297
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,460
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP SELECTED 

298
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,160
HIM, REPUBLICANS DECIDED THEY 

299
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,232
HAD TO RUSH AND THROUGH, -- 

300
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,635
RUSH HIM THROUGH, HE BECAME A 

301
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,336
STEAMROLLER OVER TRUTH AND 

302
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,470
FAIRNESS AND BIPARTISAN 

303
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,873
COOPERATION, ANY MEANS NECESSARY

304
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,009
TO REACH THEIR DESIRED END. 

305
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,478
THEY BLAMED DOCTOR FORD AND 

306
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:29,248
DEMOCRATS FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

307
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,750
FLAWS. 

308
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,119
THEY WERE INTENT ON SHROUDING 

309
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,589
THE TRUTH BECAUSE THEY KNEW IF 

310
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,524
THE TRUTH CAME TO LIGHT, JUDGE 

311
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,493
KAVANAUGH WOULD BE EXPOSED AS A 

312
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:47,333
TRULY FLAWED NOMINEE. 

313
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,069
MY COLLEAGUES, FELLOW 

314
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:52,171
AMERICANS, WHAT IS THE 

315
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,308
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE? OUR 

316
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,109
COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE A 

317
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:57,943
RECKONING ON THESE ISSUES, 

318
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,511
THERE'S ONLY ONE REMEDY, CHANGE 

319
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:03,215
MUST COME FROM WHERE CHANGE IN 

320
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,583
AMERICA ALWAYS BEGINS, THE 

321
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,987
BALLOT BOX. 

322
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,021
AMERICANS, SO MANY MILLIONS 

323
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:13,158
OUTRAGED BY WHAT HAPPENED HERE, 

324
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,694
THERE'S ONE ANSWER, VOTE. 

325
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,864
IF YOU BELIEVE DOCTOR FORD, AND 

326
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,666
OTHER BRAVE WOMEN THAT CAME 

327
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,935
FORWARD, AND YOU WANT TO 

328
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,570
VINDICATE THEIR SACRIFICE,

VOTE. 

333
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,179
IF YOU BELIEVE THE SUPREME COURT

334
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,882
MUST PROTECT HEALTHCARE AND OUR 

335
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,051
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT 

336
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:43,322
ARE PROTECTED NOW, VOTE. 

337
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,223
IF YOU BELIEVE THE SUPREME 

338
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,590
COURT SHOULD DEFEND WORKERS, 

339
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,460
CONSUMERS, THE ENVIRONMENT, 

340
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,696

00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,598
POPULATIONS, VOTE. 

342
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,832
IF YOU BELIEVE THE SUPREME 

343
00:13:53,832 --> 00:14:00,706

344
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,340
OVERREACHING PRESIDENT, VOTE. 

345
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
IF YOU BELIEVE THE PROCESS IN 

346
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,976
THE SENATE WAS A SHAM, AND YOU 

347
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,645

00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,915
BETTER, VOTE. 

349
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,918
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT SUPREME 

350
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,956
COURT JUSTICES SHOULD CONFORM 

351
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,189
TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF 

352
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,592
CHARACTER, IMPARTIALITY, 

353
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:23,963
TEMPERAMENT AND ABOVE ALL,

HE WAS OVER SHATTERED -- 

717
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,643

731
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,698

732
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,232

RIGHT HE'S A QUALIFIED JURISTS, 

734
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,838
THE OTHER ISSUES OF CHARACTER, 

735
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,106
JUDGMENT, TEMPERAMENT THAT WILL 

736
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:46,577
TAKE A LONG TIME TO HEAL, HE 

737
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,347
HAS TO RESPECT THE NEW ROLE HE 

738
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:55,286
HAS HONORED AND GIVEN THE GIFT 

739
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:55,687
TO SERVE. 

740
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,222
I THINK THAT IS THE RESPECT HE 

741
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,556
CAN GET BACK TO THE PUBLIC, DO 

742
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,858
HIS JOB AND NOT POLITICIZE IT 

743
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,992
ANYMORE THAN HE IS RIGHT NOW. 

744
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,593
>> LINDA, I WILL BRING YOU IN 

745
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:04,262
AS WELL, IT IS HARD TO FORGET 

746
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,797
FOR DEMOCRATS AND PEOPLE ON THE 

747
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,832
LEFT, THE NAME MERRICK GARLAND, 

748
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,002
MORE THAN 400 DAYS, THE SEAT 

749
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:14,372
WAS LEFT VACANT AS THE OBAMA 

750
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,573
ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO PUSH 

751
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:16,841
THEM THROUGH. 

752
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,476
THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO WAIT, 

753
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:22,513
WE DON'T WANT TO VOTE RIGHT 

754
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:22,713
NOW. 

755
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:24,749
WE TALK ABOUT THIS MOMENT NOW, 

756
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,985
THIS IS IN THE BAG FOR 

757
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:27,318
REPUBLICANS. 

758
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,419
WE HEAR FROM THE LEFT MORE, 

759
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,656
THEY WILL WORK TO UNSEAT A MAN 

760
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,557
THAT HAS A LIFETIME 

761
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:32,890
APPOINTMENT. 

762
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:39,898
IS THAT REALISTIC? 

763
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,299
>> IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN, IT 

764
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,667
WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST TIME IN 

765
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:42,934
HISTORY. 

766
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,402
IT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN A VERY 

767
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,770
LONG TIME, OVER 100 YEARS TO BE 

768
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,003
CLEAR. 

769
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:47,071
IT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED IN 

770
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,776
THE MODERN ERA. 

771
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,378
YOU HAVE TO SEE IF IT IS A 

772
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,612
RALLYING CALL, KNOWING ELECTION 

773
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,247
DAY IS A FEW SHORT WEEKS AWAY, 

774
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,483
IT IS A WAY TO HELP PEOPLE 

775
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:05,189
CONTINUING TO FEEL DOWNTRODDEN 

776
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,090
AND UPSET ABOUT THIS MOMENT, 

777
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,225
HELP THEM STAY FOCUSED ON THE 

778
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,226
PRIZE, MAKE SURE PEOPLE TURN 

779
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:08,526
OUT. 

780
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,927
IT'S LIKE BARACK OBAMA ALWAYS 

781
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:11,662
SAID, VOTE. 

782
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:12,997
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR 

783
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:13,965
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT. 

784
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,067
AS WE WAIT FOR THE FINAL 

785
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,501
RESULTS, YOU HEAR THE PROTESTS 

786
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:24,242
HAPPENING, IT IS AN INDICATION 

787
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,676
OF WHERE WE HAVE COME, HOW FAR 

788
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:27,111
WE HAVE FALLEN AS A NATION, THE 

789
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,346
WOUNDS ARE DEEP AND THE RIFT IS 

790
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:28,946
WHITE. 

791
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:29,747
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE ONCE 

792
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,917
ELECTION DAY COMES AND GOES, 

793
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,085
ESPECIALLY IF THE HOUSE IS 

794
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,653
TAKEN BY DEMOCRATS. 

795
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,789
>> MICHAEL, I WILL BRING YOU TO 

796
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,760
WEIGH IN. 

797
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,062
WE TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF 

798
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:44,896
JUSTICE, FBI, SUPREME COURT, 

799
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:45,830
THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE THAT 

800
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,631
HAVE DOUBTS IN DEMOCRATIC 

801
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:46,964
INSTITUTIONS. 

802
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:51,436
IS THERE A WAY TO REPAIR THIS? 

803
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,904
>> WE HAVE GONE THROUGH BAD 

804
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,472
PHASES BEFORE IN THE 1960S WE 

805
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:59,077
HAD PEOPLE BEING ASSASSINATED 

806
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,011
ETC. 

807
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,681
YOU HAD REJECTION OF 

808
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,482
INSTITUTIONS, PEOPLE FORGET THE 

809
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:09,787
MILITARY WAS LOOKED UPON AS 

810
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,623
DISREPUTABLE AND HAD A BAD 

811
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:13,624
REPUTATION, LOOK WHERE IT IS 

812
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:13,857
TODAY. 

813
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:14,659
THINGS WILL CHANGE, THE 

814
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,860
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THINGS YOU 

815
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,361
CAN DO TO START MOVEMENT IN THE 

816
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:18,296
SHORT-TERM AND CAN YOU GET 

817
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,897
POLITICAL VALUE OUT OF IT? 

818
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:23,501
JENNIFER FLAKES FUNDAMENTAL 

819
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,302
ARGUMENT, THERE'S NO WIN FOR 

820
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,837
SOMEONE THAT WALKS ACROSS THE 

821
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,070
AISLE. 

822
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,839
THE OTHER SIDE SMACKS YOU WHEN 

823
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,674
YOU GET THERE AND YOUR SIDE 

824
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,144
SMACKS YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK. 

825
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,045
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND MIDDLE 

826
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,682
GROUND. 

827
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,016
>> HE RAISES A REALLY GOOD 

828
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:41,853
POINT ABOUT FAITH AND PUBLIC 

829
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,121
AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. 

830
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,556
HISTORICALLY LOOKING BACK, IN 

831
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,759
TERMS OF THE CYCLICAL NATURE, 

832
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:54,999
AFTER THE 2008 ECONOMY, THE 

833
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:55,700
DOWNFALL, THERE WAS TREMENDOUS 

834
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,534
SENTIMENT WHERE PEOPLE LOST 

835
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,136
FAITH IN PUBLIC AND 

836
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:58,469
INSTITUTIONS. 

837
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,570
THEY NEVER BELIEVED THEIR 

838
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:05,009
401(K)S WOULD DISAPPEAR 

839
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,043
OVERNIGHT OR THE GOVERNMENT WAS 

840
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,445
SO CORRUPT THE WAY THAT IT WAS. 

841
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,880
THEY LOST FAITH ALL THE WAY 

842
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,647
AROUND. 

843
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,516
THE LAST VESTIGE OF HOPE WAS IN 

844
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,550
THE COURT SYSTEM, PEOPLE ARGUED 

845
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,751
ON THE STATE LEVEL THERE'S A 

846
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,887
LOT OF BIAS, JUDGES THAT 

847
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,121
LITIGATE FROM THE BENCH. 

848
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,322
THE SUPREME COURT WAS ALWAYS A 

849
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,190
BEACON, TO TAKE THAT AS WELL 

850
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,895
AND TAINT IT IS HAVING A BIGGER 

851
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,228
IMPACT. 

852
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:31,636
IT WILL TAKE TIME TO SEE HOW WE 

853
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,237
COME OUT OF THAT, IT IS A VERY 

854
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:33,871
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR THE 

855
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:34,170
COUNTRY. 

856
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,306

00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,507

00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,704
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEY 

916
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,106
WOULD SUPPORT THIS VOTE, UNLIKE

SUSAN COLLINS, MORE QUESTIONS

REGARDING ROE V WADE AND THE 

919
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,079
HEALTHCARE DECISIONS, THESE ARE 

920
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:06,083
MORE CONSERVATIVE SENATORS, 

921
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:11,122
CORY GARDNER IN COLORADO. 

922
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,822
CORY GARDNER PLAYED AN 

923
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:12,623
INTERESTING ROLE, HE IS THE 

924
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,191
HEAD OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN 

925
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,895
SENATORIAL COMMITTEE. 

926
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,363
HE NEEDS TO FOLLOW WHAT THE 

927
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,264
PRESIDENT IS PUTTING OUT THERE, 

928
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:24,835
IN TERMS OF HIS NOMINEE. 

929
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,070
>> WALK US THROUGH THIS RIGHT

DOWN PARTY LINES EXPECTED, 

933
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,143
WHERE DOES THIS GO AS FAR AS 

934
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:32,443
PROCEDURES? 

935
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,713
>> ASIDE FROM JOE MANCHIN, WHO

VIRGINIA, AND LISA MURKOWSKI, 

938
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,321
WHO OPTED TO VOTE PRESENT LAST 

939
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:45,623
NIGHT SHE WOULD VOTE NO. 

940
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,525
SHE WOULD CHANGE HER VOTE TO 

941
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,695
PRESENT ESSENTIALLY TO CANCEL A 

942
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,196
YES VOTE OF STEVE DAINES THAT 

943
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,698
COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE 

944
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:55,900
HIS DAUGHTER IS GETTING 

945
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,134
MARRIED, HE WANTED TO BE THERE 

946
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:57,968
TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE. 

947
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:04,642
IT IS LARGELY PARTISAN WIDE. 

948
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,043
WE WILL HAVE A CONFIRMED 

949
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,912
ASSOCIATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

950
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,148
FROM THERE, WE WILL GO THROUGH 

951
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,784
THE REGULAR PROCESS, ALL THE 

952
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:14,618
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE THAT 

953
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,386
COMES WITH THAT. 

954
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,522
THE PRESIDENT USUALLY BRINGS 

955
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,890
THE JUSTICE IN, THEY TAKE THE 

956
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,760
OATH, THERE WILL BE PICTURES OF 

957
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:30,668
THE SUPREME COURT AS KAVANAUGH 

958
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,669
IS ELEVATED TO THAT ROLE. 

959
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:32,670
THEN WE GO FROM THERE. 

960
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,672
AFTER THIS VOTE, THAT'S IT. 

961
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,775
THE SENATE IS OUT OF IT. 

962
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,642
I BELIEVE SENATOR MITCH 

963
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,111
McCONNELL PLANS TO HAVE A PRESS 

964
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:41,611

966
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,217
ONE ITEM TO NOTE, THE JUDICIARY 

967
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,685
COMMITTEE'S ROLE IN 

968
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,355

DOCTOR LACEY FOR -- CHRISTINE 

970
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:58,696
BLASEY FORD. 

971
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,532
THEY MAY PURSUE MORE ON HOW HER 

972
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,701
NAME WAS LEAKED. 

973
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:07,705
I UNDERSTAND CHUCK GRASSLEY AND 

974
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,508
HIS STAFF ARE TRYING TO GET P --

975
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:15,045
PIECES AFFORD -- EVIDENCE THEY 

976
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,348
RELIED ON. 

977
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:24,655
WHETHER HE WILL BE NOMINATED TO 

978
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,556
THE SUPREME COURT BENCH. 

979
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,791
>> I WILL BRING IN MICHAEL 

980
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:32,829
GRAHAM WHO JOINS US NOW. 

981
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:34,632
IF WE CAN GO TO THE WIDER SHOT 

982
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,666
EARLIER AT THE SENATE FLOOR, 

983
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,667
THERE WAS AN IMAGE THAT CAUGHT 

984
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,268
MY EYE. 

985
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,602
IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO BRING IT 

986
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,603
DOWN, SEATED DOWN IN FRONT. 

987
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,704
WE DO NOT HAVE DAMAGE, SEATED 

988
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,340
WHERE THE SENATE PAGE IS, MAYBE 

989
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,575
HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE AGE AT 

990
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,111
THIS POINT, I'M REMINDED OF THE 

991
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,645
ANITA HILL HEARINGS, I WAS AN 

992
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:56,654
ELEMENTARY AGE STUDENT AT THE 

993
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,589
TIME, I THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT 

994
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,256
IT HAD IN MY LIFETIME OF THAT 

995
00:40:59,256 --> 00:40:59,523
DECISION. 

996
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,724
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS 

997
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:01,425
YOUNGER GENERATION THAT IS 

998
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,459
WATCHING THIS, MIGHT NOT BE 

999
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,861
ABLE TO VOTE AT THIS POINT. 

1000
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:12,002
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THEM? 

1001
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:12,702
>> MY 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER 

1002
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:13,804
ASKED ME WHEN THE ALLEGATIONS 

1003
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,039
CAME OUT, SHE SAID, DADDY, WHY 

1004
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,440
WON'T HE JUST SAY HE DID IT? 

1005
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,374
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 

1006
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,809
I THINK IT IS MEAN OF HIM TO 

1007
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,910
SAY HE DID NOT DO IT. 

1008
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,347
WHAT IF HE DIDN'T DO IT? 

1009
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,848
HE IS TELLING WHAT HE BELIEVES 

1010
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:25,282
TO BE TRUE. 

1011
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,752
SHE HAD BEEN SO CONVINCED 

1012
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,887
BECAUSE OF THE CONVERSATION. 

1013
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,089
>> MICHAEL, I APOLOGIZE, I WILL 

1014
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:32,489
INTERRUPT YOU. 

1015
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,891
WE WILL LISTEN TO VICE 

1016
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,159
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. 

1017
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,395
>> THE NOMINATION OF BRETT

RESTORE ORDER IN THE GALLERY. 

1028
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:11,061
THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. 

1029
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:11,896

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 

1033
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:47,164
VOTED IN BY THE SUPREME COURT, 

1034
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,131
MAKING IT THE MOST CONSERVATIVE 

1035
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:48,599
MAJORITY EVER. 

1036
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,268
I WILL BRING IN THE CBSN PANEL 

1037
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:51,969
JOINING US, LESLIE SANCHEZ, I

GO TO YOU RIGHT NOW, WHAT DOES 

1039
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,905
THIS MEAN FOR THE REPUBLICAN 

1040
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,939
PARTY? 

1041
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:59,944
>> HAVING A CONSERVATIVE 

1042
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,478
JURIST, IT IS A STRONG WIN. 

1043
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,279
THIS IS BEEN SOMETHING 

1044
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,149
IMPORTANT TO REPUBLICANS FOR A 

1045
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,550
VARIETY OF REASONS, HE 

1046
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,821
DELIVERED ON THAT NOT ONCE BUT 

1047
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:11,054
TWICE. 

1048
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:12,856
YOU LOOK AT THE TWEETS, IT HAS 

1049
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,292
ALSO GALVANIZED CONSERVATIVE 

1050
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,594
WOMEN, ON AN ISSUE THEY COULD 

1051
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,797
RALLY AROUND, THE APPENDED -- 

1052
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:26,537
INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM HAS 

1053
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:27,471
BEEN TALKING TO SENATOR FLAKE 

1054
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,372
AND SENATOR COLLINS, JOE 

1055
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,106
MANCHIN, THE UNDECIDED, TO 

1056
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,607
THANK THEM FOR FOLLOWING WITH 

1057
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:35,179
DUE PROCESS, NOT LOOKING AT HOW 

1058
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,513
LITTLE SIZED THIS WAS AND 

1059
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:36,880
MOVING FORWARD. 

1060
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,081
CREDIT SHOULD GO TO LISA 

1061
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:40,551
MURKOWSKI, NOBODY IS TALKING 

1062
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,685
ABOUT THAT, SHE MADE A TOUGH 

1063
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:42,686
CHOICE AGAINST HER PARTY LINE. 

1064
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:45,556
BECAUSE SHE FELT IN HER GUT AND 

1065
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,757
OTHER SENATORS, THERE IS GOING 

1066
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,726
TO BE A CLOUD AND HE WAS NOT 

1067
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:52,229
THE RIGHT NOMINEE AT THE RIGHT 

1068
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:52,429
TIME. 

1069
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,298
FOR REPUBLICANS, IT'S A WIN. 

1070
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,699
THAT CLOUD WILL CONTINUE TO 

1071
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,935
REMAIN. 

1072
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,170
>> LINDA TRAN, WHERE THE 

1073
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:11,649
DEMOCRATS GO ? 

1074
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,883
>> DEMOCRATS WILL RALLY THE 

1075
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:13,784
TROOPS, WE SAW MANY PROTESTS 

1076
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:14,485
THAT WERE EXTRAORDINARY AND 

1077
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,219
ORGANIC, PEOPLE COMING FROM 

1078
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,320
AROUND THE COUNTRY TRYING TO 

1079
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,121
MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD. 

1080
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,022
I WONDER HOW IT WILL HAVE A 

1081
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:21,392
CHILLING EFFECT ON PEOPLE 

1082
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,526
COMING FORWARD TO SHARE THEIR 

1083
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,026
STORIES OF SURVIVAL. 

1084
00:44:23,026 --> 00:44:24,361
WE SAW A VIDEO YESTERDAY THAT 

1085
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,532
WENT VIRAL OF A YOUNG WOMAN, 15-

1086
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:29,466
YEAR-OLD GIRL, CONSTITUENT OF 

1087
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,034
JOE MANCHIN, THAT CAME TO 

1088
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:31,802
WASHINGTON DC WITH HER MOTHER 

1089
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:32,903
TO SHARE HER STORY OF SEXUAL 

1090
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:33,270
ASSAULTS. 

1091
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,239
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THESE 

1092
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,940
INDIVIDUALS AND THE IMPACT IT 

1093
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,777
HAS ON THEM THAT THEIR VOICES 

1094
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,411
DID NOT MATTER AND THEIR 

1095
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:44,248
STORIES WERE NOT HURT. 

1096
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:45,249
AS DEMOCRATS GOING TO THE 

1097
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,619
ELECTION, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO 

1098
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,155
GRAPPLE WITH THAT LEVEL OF RAGE 

1099
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,690
AND TRY TO CHANNEL THAT INTO A 

1100
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,791
SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT ABOUT WHAT 

1101
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,394
CAN BE DONE ABOUT HOW CHANGE 

1102
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,397
CAN BE MADE THROUGH THE BALLOT 

1103
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,899
BOX. 

1104
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:07,705
>> HE HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE ME 

1105
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:11,675
TO MOVEMENT, A STORY ABOUT 

1106
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,376
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL 

1107
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:12,609
ABUSE. 

1108
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,478
WHAT DO WE SAY TO WOMEN THAT 

1109
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,579
FEEL LIKE THEIR VOICES WILL 

1110
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:16,146
ONLY BE SILENCED? 

1111
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:20,150
>> I THINK THE THING TO SAY, IF 

1112
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,854
YOU WANT TO SEE HOW SOMEBODY 

1113
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,088
CAN BE HEARD, LOOK HOW DOCTOR 

1114
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:27,257
FORD WAS TREATED BY THE SENATE 

1115
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:34,231
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THEY 

1116
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,165
LISTENED AND GAVE HER THE 

1117
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,066
OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HER STORY. 

1118
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,100
THERE WERE NOT PEOPLE YELLING 

1119
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,202
AT HER FROM THE BENCH. 

1120
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,770
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT GET THE 

1121
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,170
MEMO, APPARENTLY. 

1122
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:48,746
THE JUDICIARY SENATE COMMITTEE 

1123
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,747
CANNOT BE CRITICIZED HOW THEY 

1124
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,681
TREATED DOCTOR FORD, THEY MADE 

1125
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:51,882
THE CASE, I THOUGHT SUSAN 

1126
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:52,883
COLLINS WAS POWERFUL IN THIS 

1127
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:53,884
YESTERDAY WHEN SHE CALLED OUT 

1128
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:54,451
WHATEVER DEMOCRATIC STAFFER 

1129
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,352
LEAKED THE LETTER FROM DOCTOR 

1130
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,221
FORD AND FORCED HER INTO THE 

1131
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:57,521
LIMELIGHT. 

1132
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:02,659
THAT STORYLINE IS LOST RIGHT 

1133
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,894
NOW, PEOPLE ARE TOO EMOTIONAL, 

1134
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:04,794
THIS IS COMPLETELY PARTISAN. 

1135
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:05,596
GOING BACK, REPUBLICANS CAN SAY 

1136
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:10,200
WE HAVE NOT SAID, DON'T SPEAK. 

1137
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,435
WHEN YOU SPEAK, WE HAVE TO 

1138
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,439
TREAT EVERYONE FAIRLY. 

1139
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,473
SUSAN COLLINS WAS A TREMENDOUS 

1140
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,242
VOICE FOR THAT ARGUMENT IN HER 

1141
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:18,909
SPEECH YESTERDAY. 

1142
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,410
I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST 

1143
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,478
POLITICAL SPEECHES, MECHANICAL 

1144
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:25,648
STANDPOINT OF ACCOMPLISHING 

1145
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:27,017
WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO I HAVE 

1146
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:27,985
EVER SEEN. 

1147
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:32,723
I USED TO WRITE SPEECHES FOR 

1148
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:33,323
CANDIDATES, PEOPLE WOULD 

1149
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,558
COMPLAIN IT WAS TOO LONG, I 

1150
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:35,358
THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIFIC. 

1151
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:36,493
IT GIVES REPUBLICANS A 

1152
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,394
GUIDELINE FOR PASSPORT, BE 

1153
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:42,199
COMPASSIONATE, BE OPEN AND FAIR,

1154
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,600
DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR BEING FAIR. 

1155
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,269
WE ARE ALL GROWN-UPS, THERE ARE 

1156
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:50,874
TOUGH ISSUES AND SOMETIMES 

1157
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,009
THERE ARE HE SAID, SHE SAID 

1158
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,143
MOMENTS, THERE'S NO REASON TO 

1159
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,244
BE JUVENILE AT ANY LEVEL, FROM 

1160
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:59,316
DISMISSING THE WOMAN OR ALSO 

1161
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,684
SAYING ALL WOMEN SHOULD BE 

1162
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:00,951
BELIEVED. 

1163
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:01,418
NEITHER POSITIONS ARE 

1164
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,085
LEGITIMATE OR CREDIBLE, THAT'S 

1165
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,286
A PATH FORWARD SUSAN COLLINS 

1166
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:03,720
LAID OUT YESTERDAY. 

1167
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,821
>> SHE WENT POINT BY POINT, 

1168
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:07,858
TALKING ABOUT ROE V WADE AND 

1169
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:08,859
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT, IT WAS A 

1170
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:09,893
45 MINUTE SPEECH. 

1171
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,527
MICHAEL, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE TO 

1172
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:15,399
MEN WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL 

1173
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,133
ASSAULT WITH THIS? 

1174
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:19,670
WE KNOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH FOUGHT 

1175
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,737
THIS AGGRESSIVELY, FIERCELY AND 

1176
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:21,271
HE CAME OUT STRONG. 

1177
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,274
IS THE MESSAGE FIGHT IT, YOU 

1178
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:28,178
WILL SURVIVE? 

1179
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,780
>> THIS IS SUCH AN UNUSUAL 

1180
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,113
CIRCUMSTANCE. 

1181
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:33,250
WE ARE BETTER AT ADJUDICATING 

1182
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,484
CASES WHERE IT IS A HE SAID, 

1183
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,955
SHE SAID, THERE WAS AN 

1184
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,122
ENCOUNTER, BOTH PEOPLE HAVE A 

1185
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,524
DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE 

1186
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:40,824
ENCOUNTER. 

1187
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:46,029
SOMEBODY SAID IT ABSOLUTELY 

1188
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,097
HAPPENED, 100% SURE IT IS JUDGE 

1189
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:47,397
KAVANAUGH. 

1190
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,665
KAVANAUGH SAID I'M ABSOLUTELY 

1191
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:52,169
SURE IT WAS NOT ME, THERE WAS NO

1192
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:52,803
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, YOU 

1193
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:53,971
COULD NOT GO TO A SINGLE 

1194
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,172
WITNESS THAT COULD CONFIRM OR 

1195
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:55,806
BACKUP DOCTOR FORD'S STORY. 

1196
00:47:55,806 --> 00:48:01,878
YOU WERE LEFT IN A POLARIZED 

1197
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,213
AREA. 

1198
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:03,713
IT WAS LIKE POLITICS. 

1199
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:07,050
IF YOUR MAN AND YOU'RE LOOKING 

1200
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,086
FOR SOMEONE TO RALLY AROUND YOU 

1201
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,220
BECAUSE YOU ARE AN ABUSIVE JERK 

1202
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,091
AND PEOPLE ARE OKAY WITH THAT, 

1203
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,326
THIS CASE DID NOT WORK FOR YOU 

1204
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,962
IN THIS MESSAGE. 

1205
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,197
IT REMINDS PEOPLE, NUMBER ONE, 

1206
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,432
TAKE THE ACCUSATION SERIOUSLY. 

1207
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,667
NUMBER TWO, IF YOU'RE A WOMAN, 

1208
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:24,768
PEOPLE ARE READY TO LISTEN, 

1209
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:26,103
BRING YOUR EVIDENCE WHEN IT 

1210
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,038
HAPPENS SO PEOPLE CAN STAND 

1211
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,172
AROUND YOU. 

1212
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:34,478
IT IS UNFAIR ARGUMENT FROM 

1213
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:35,178
DEMOCRATS THAT SOMEHOW WOMEN 

1214
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,680
HAVE BEEN DISMISSED IN THIS 

1215
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,248
PROCESS. 

1216
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,683
IT WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR 

1217
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,684
SOMEONE TO SHOW ME EVIDENCE TO 

1218
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:41,952
BACK UP THAT CASE ABOUT THIS 

1219
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,255
SPECIFIC STORY OF DOCTOR FORD 

1220
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:45,788
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

1221
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:52,329
>> I WILL BRING MOLLY HOOPER ON 

1222
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:52,662
CAPITOL HILL. 

1223
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:53,296
YOU MENTIONED THE PROCEDURES 

1224
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:56,066
GOING FORWARD, WE ASK  WRECKED 

1225
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,901
-- EXPECT A PRESS CONFERENCE 

1226
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:06,276
FROM MITCH COLLINS. 

1227
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,011
>> AFTER THE THURSDAY HEARING, 

1228
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,947
I WAS IN THE HOUSE SIDE, 

1229
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,516
RUNNING INTO SOME OF MY 

1230
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,018
SOURCES, ANTI-TRUMP, PRO-TRUMP, 

1231
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,821
THE ONE THING THAT UNITED THEM 

1232
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,290
WAS KAVANAUGH WAS TREATED 

1233
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,059
UNFAIRLY, THEY BROUGHT UP A LOT 

1234
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,793
OF POINTS I WOULD NOT HAVE 

1235
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:29,299
ANTICIPATED. THIS ONE ISSUE, IF 

1236
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,269
ANYTHING UNIFIED REPUBLICANS, 

1237
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,272
LINDSEY GRAHAM, OF ALL PEOPLE, 

1238
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:36,573
ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF 

1239
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:40,210
CRITICS, SAID THIS ISSUE HAS 

1240
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,211
UNIFIED REPUBLICANS MORE THAN 

1241
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,479
ANY SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN 

1242
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,847
PRESIDENT. 

1243
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:45,749
IT'S NOT HE SAID, SHE SAID, 

1244
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,918
IT'S THE WAY JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

1245
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:51,521
HAS BEEN TREATED, THE WAY BOTH 

1246
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,390
DOCTOR FORD AND KAVANAUGH HAVE 

1247
00:49:53,390 --> 00:50:01,998
BEEN TREATED IN THIS PROCESS. 

1248
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:02,899
MITCH McCONNELL SAID EARLIER, 

1249
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:07,504
IT IS A SHOT OF ADRENALINE FOR 

1250
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,538
US, EXPECT REPUBLICANS TO KEEP 

1251
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:09,473
THIS ISSUE OUT THERE, CALLING 

1252
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,841
THIS A "SHAMELESS SMEAR 

1253
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,609
CAMPAIGN BY DEMOCRATS". 

1254
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:16,146
IT WILL RAMP UP REPUBLICANS, IT 

1255
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:19,716
ARTIE IS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.

1256
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:21,418
>> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU, 

1257
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,419
MOLLY AND MICHAEL GRAHAM, HE 

1258
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,888
HAS TO GO OUT. 

1259
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,724
LINDA AND LESLIE, WEIGH IN ON 

1260
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,259
WHAT MICHAEL GRAHAM SAID 

1261
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:29,526
EARLIER. 

1262
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,661
>> LET ME SAY, I THINK MICHAEL 

1263
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:38,001
GRAHAM IS A VERY INTELLIGENT 

1264
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,036
HUMAN BEING, I ENJOY HAVING 

1265
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:39,736
THESE CONVERSATIONS, I HAVE 

1266
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:41,771
NEVER TAKEN MORE ISSUE WITH ANY 

1267
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:42,772
COMMENTARY HE HAS OFFERED MORE 

1268
00:50:42,772 --> 00:50:45,509
THAN IN THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. 

1269
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:46,810
THE IDEA OF LIKENING SOMEONE 

1270
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,544
THAT SUFFERED SEXUAL ASSAULT 

1271
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,745
WITH THE ACCUSED AS BOTH 

1272
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:55,152
VICTIMS, SHOWS YOU HOW UNFAIR 

1273
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,186
THIS ENTIRE SITUATION HAS BEEN. 

1274
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,587
IT'S NOT HE SAID, SHE SAID. 

1275
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:04,094
YOU CAN'T SAY YOU BELIEVE 

1276
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,095
DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 

1277
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,430
AND IN THE NEXT BREATH SAY, SHE 

1278
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:06,963
IS CONFUSED. 

1279
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,165
YOU BELIEVE HER OR YOU DON'T. 

1280
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,299
WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS 100% 

1281
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,667
CERTAIN IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH 

1282
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:11,200
THAT ASSAULTED HER, THAT 

1283
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,768
SHOULD'VE MEANT SOMETHING. 

1284
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,170
EVEN THE WAY THAT HEARING WAS 

1285
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,137
CARRIED OUT, THE FACT THEY HAD 

1286
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:20,143
TO BRING IN A FEMALE PROSECUTOR 

1287
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:21,144
THEY REFER TO AS A FEMALE 

1288
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,179
ASSISTANT, THEY WERE NOT BRAVE 

1289
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,580
ENOUGH TO CONFRONT AND SPEAK TO 

1290
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,347
HER THEMSELVES. 

1291
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,850
THAT MEANS ALL OF THE MEN, THE 

1292
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,051
GOP MEN SITTING ON THE 

1293
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:28,885
COMMITTEE, THAT TELLS YOU THEY 

1294
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,086
WERE VERY WORRIED AND WANTED TO 

1295
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,722
SET THIS UP SO IT WAS APPEALING 

1296
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:33,123
TO THEM. 

1297
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,558
WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE 

1298
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,894
THEY CALLED FOR A FBI 

1299
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:42,098
INVESTIGATION THAT DID NOT 

1300
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,233
QUESTION THE ACCUSER OR THE 

1301
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,767
ACCUSED, YOU HEAR ALL OF THE 

1302
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,669
STORIES, TESTIMONY OFFERED 

1303
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,970
WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS FROM A 

1304
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,607
FRIEND OF CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 

1305
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,808
WHO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER 

1306
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:52,442
IN 2016. 

1307
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,579
SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT BRETT 

1308
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:56,713
KAVANAUGH BY NAME AT THE TIME. 

1309
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:57,781
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE COMING 

1310
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,949
FORD, THEY TRIED TO REACH OUT 

1311
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,517
TO THE FBI, THEIR INFORMATION 

1312
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,586
AND EVIDENCE WAS NOT TAKEN INTO 

1313
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:02,853
ACCOUNT. 

1314
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,054
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD 

1315
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:07,457
POSSIBLY LEAVE THE WAY THE 

1316
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,191
INVESTIGATION OR THE HEARING 

1317
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,327
WAS CARRIED OUT WAS FAIR TO 

1318
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:10,994
DOCTOR FORD. 

1319
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,296
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAD 

1320
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,833
A WOMAN ACCUSED, HER LIFE WAS 

1321
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,667
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE OF 

1322
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,236
THE EXPERIENCE SHE HAD. 

1323
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:23,306
SHE IS -- SHE IS LEFT WITH THAT 

1324
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,541
FOR DECADES . SHE CANNOT LIVE 

1325
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:28,678
IN HER OWN HOME, HER NAME IS 

1326
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,113
OUT THERE AND SHE IS A PIECE OF 

1327
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,648
HISTORY SHE DOES NOT WANT TO BE 

1328
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:31,948
PART OF. 

1329
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,483
YOU HAVE A GUY THAT WILL BE ON 

1330
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,384
THE SUPREME COURT, SOMEBODY, 

1331
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,585
EVEN IF YOU SET ASIDE WHETHER 

1332
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,555
OR NOT YOU BELIEVE CHRISTINE 

1333
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,722
BLASEY FORD, EXHIBIT A 

1334
00:52:39,722 --> 00:52:43,927
TEMPERAMENT IN BEFITTING OF A 

1335
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:44,828
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IT IS 

1336
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,862
DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATION AT 

1337
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:46,163
LARGE. 

1338
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:50,367
IT IS A HORRIBLE MOMENT FOR 

1339
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,367
EVERY AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY, 

1340
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:52,702
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 

1341
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:53,069
PARTY. 

1342
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:53,770
>> LESLIE, TO LINDA'S POINT, 

1343
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,405
MANY WOMEN FELT LIKE THIS WAS A 

1344
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,640
MOMENT WE HOPED WOULD LEAD TO 

1345
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,042
SOMETHING MORE AND IT DIDN'T. 

1346
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:05,982
MICHAEL HAD TO LEAVE. 

1347
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,483
MICHAEL'S POINT WAS ALSO, IN 

1348
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:08,184
THIS SYSTEM, WE ALLOWED HER TO 

1349
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:08,585
BE HURT. 

1350
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,120
YOU MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH THE 

1351
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,687
FBI INVESTIGATION, SHE WAS 

1352
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:16,626
ALLOWED IN A PUBLIC HIGHLY RATED

1353
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:17,961
, MANY PEOPLE TUNED IN TO WATCH 

1354
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:18,862
THE TESTIMONIUM BOTH SIDES. 

1355
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,064
HOW DO WE MOVE PAST THIS IN 

1356
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,266
SEXUAL ASSAULT LIKE THE IT IS 

1357
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,501
HE SAID VERSUS SHE SAID WITH 

1358
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,437
LITTLE EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION 

1359
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:29,906
TO CORROBORATE EITHER SIDE. 

1360
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,743
>> TO CORROBORATE WHAT SHE 

1361
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,512
SAID, YES. 

1362
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,646
THERE'S SO MUCH OF THAT WE 

1363
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:41,918
AGREE ON, NOT AS WOMEN OR 

1364
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:42,385
POLITICAL OPERATIVES, 

1365
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:42,985
FUNDAMENTALLY, IN FAIRNESS. 

1366
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:44,454
FAIRNESS IS THE BIG ISSUE. 

1367
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:49,659
WAS IT FAIR TO BRING DOCTOR FORD

1368
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,560
, IT WAS APPROPRIATE. 

1369
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,163
WAS IT FAIR TO CALL HER THE 

1370
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:57,600
FEMALE'S INITIAL PROSECUTOR, 

1371
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,301
SHE'S THE PROSECUTOR. 

1372
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,836
WE COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT 

1373
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:00,603
THESE FLIGHTS AND WHAT THE 

1374
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:01,604
JUDICIARY HAD TO DO. 

1375
00:54:01,604 --> 00:54:03,039
YES, THE PROBLEM IS, I WILL SAY 

1376
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,274
POLITICALLY, THE DEMOCRATS 

1377
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:08,345
OVERPLAYED THIS ACCUSATION AND 

1378
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,879
THEY PILED ON, YOU HAD ALL 

1379
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,681
THESE OTHER ACCUSATIONS, SOME 

1380
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,581
OF THEM OUTLANDISH, IT SOUNDED 

1381
00:54:12,581 --> 00:54:14,049
LIKE YOU WERE BULLYING AND 

1382
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:17,153
PILING ON BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

1383
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,589
THAT'S WHAT ACTIVATED 

1384
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,523
CONSERVATIVE WOMEN, THE WAY YOU 

1385
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:23,960
HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE EQUAL RIGHTS

1386
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,261
AMENDMENT, THE CIVIL RIGHTS 

1387
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:31,201
MOVEMENT, IT CREATED A 

1388
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:31,835
CONSERVATIVE WOMEN'S COALITION, 

1389
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:32,402
A MOVEMENT FOR US. 

1390
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:33,203
THAT'S WHAT THIS DID. 

1391
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:33,937
THE PROBLEM IS, WE WESTERNIZED 

1392
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:38,808
SEXUAL ASSAULT IN A WAY TO SUIT 

1393
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:39,509
OUR OWN MEANS. 

1394
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,744
THE PRESIDENT DID THAT WHEN HE 

1395
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:41,845
WAS MOCKING DOCTOR FORD AT A 

1396
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:42,912
POLITICAL RALLY. 

1397
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:51,087
IT MINIMIZES AND TRIVIALIZES úW 

1398
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:51,587
TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT 

1399
00:54:51,587 --> 00:54:52,188
CONVERSATION ABOUT. 

1400
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:53,423
THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO SEE THE 

1401
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:54,858
SENATE GO, YOU WILL SEE IT WITH 

1402
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:55,958
MORE WOMEN ELECTED, REGARDLESS 

1403
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:56,225
OF PARTY. 

1404
00:54:56,225 --> 00:54:57,960
WOMEN ARE KNOWN AS ELECTED 

1405
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,764
OFFICIALS, TO BE PEOPLE TO 

1406
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,898
REACH ACROSS THE AISLE, LOOK 

1407
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,900
FOR DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES, 

1408
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,037
LOOK AT COLLINS AND SENATOR 

1409
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:08,337
MURKOWSKI. 

1410
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:12,608
THEY HAD DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS 

1411
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:13,476
AND CONSTITUENCIES, THEY'RE 

1412
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,944
WILLING TO TAKE THE BULLET, 

1413
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:15,945
BACKING THEIR PARTY OR 

1414
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:21,418
CHALLENGING, FALLING IN LINE 

1415
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:21,851
WITH LEADERSHIP. 

1416
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:22,752
THAT'S WHERE THIS WILL GO. 

1417
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,954
THE RIPPLE EFFECT FOR YOUNG 

1418
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:35,999
GIRLS, CANDIDATES AND PARTIES 

1419
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,100
WILL BE HELD FOR A GENERATION. 

1420
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,835
>> I HAVE A FEELING WE WILL ALL 

1421
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,969
BE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THIS 

1422
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,271

>> FOR GENERATIONS. 

1425
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:43,673
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN SIT IN 

1426
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,275
THE SEAT FOR A GENERATION. 

1427
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,043
