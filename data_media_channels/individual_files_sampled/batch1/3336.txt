life for Bernie made up in prison isn't as bad as you would expect perhaps he's actually very well-respected in prison to the extent that you're going to go to prison people respect people who have done bigger things and there is no bigger white collar offender than Bernie Madoff so people look up to him actually is the financial guru the person go to to actually get financial advice one of my jobs in prison has been running the the commissary so it's the the place where inmates go to purchase a variety of food items things like ramen noodles a variety of flavors or to buy a pair of sneakers flip-flops to wear in the shower or maybe even a watch Bernie lives a pretty simple life now a bit being stuck in prison but he's a voracious reader there is no one that reads the paper more carefully listens to every radio show digest every piece of news more carefully than Bernie does about himself in his case but he actually spends a significant amount of time meeting with lawyers he has appointments every every week with lawyers flying in from around the world that are actually trying to understand his case in part to look at some of the proceeds and and some of the receivership about getting money back
