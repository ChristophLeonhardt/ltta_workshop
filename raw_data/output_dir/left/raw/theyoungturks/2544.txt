25
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,270

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,150
Tarantino made her do the stunt with

38
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,860
malicious intent<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there was</font>

39

<font color="#E5E5E5">it was not necessarily supposed to be a</font>

57
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,030
stunt<font color="#CCCCCC"> a she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was only supposed to go 40</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">curve that Tarantino did not expect and</font>

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
and that's what he's now<font color="#E5E5E5"> beating himself</font>

up over<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying I should have tested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't screwed down properly</font>

65
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,799
it was a sand road and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

66
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,870
straight road<font color="#E5E5E5"> also she added the</font>

67
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,360
Tarantino had instructed her<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit 40</font>

68

miles per<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or else her hair wouldn't</font>

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,920
blow the right way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what Tarantino</font>

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">is saying is now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to be clear he</font>

71
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,870
said I wish we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone one way on the</font>

72

road<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wish I had tested going the other</font>

73
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">way because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it curved in a way that I</font>

74
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,670
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought it was gonna be</font>

75
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,190
straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was sandy and you know</font>

76
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">and apparently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even going 40 miles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> per</font>

77

hour created an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he said that</font>

78
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,220
it was the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> regret of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his career</font>

79
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah yeah and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

80
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:05,319
uma<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thurman also said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she's proud</font>

81
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">of him for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the right thing and for</font>

82
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,879
his courage because he was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

83
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,280
managed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> obtain that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> footage that she</font>

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,139
desperately wanted and she wanted

85
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:17,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">closure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2003 and you</font>

86
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,590
know it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been on her mind ever</font>

87
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">since then and so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really happy that</font>

88
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,359
she was<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to share her story</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

89
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:26,530
she went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through I'm happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that she was</font>

90
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shine a light on what</font>

91
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">she went through and I'm glad that</font>

92
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,609
Tarantino<font color="#E5E5E5"> took some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibility for</font>

93
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know his part and and he you know</font>

94
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about his own negligence in this</font>

95
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,090
case yeah he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

96
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">biggest regrets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was a</font>

97
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then sometimes when you are director</font>

98
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,129
you make mistakes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you learn from</font>

99
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">them but this was a particularly</font>

100
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">horrendous mistake as he called it now</font>

101
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,400
the reason she's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mad at him is</font>

102
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,099
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he at least helped her to get</font>

103
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,260
the footage<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prove her case she's more</font>
