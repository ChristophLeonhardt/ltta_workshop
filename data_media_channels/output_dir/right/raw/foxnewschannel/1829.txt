PRIMARY.

4

THREE REPUBLICANS REMAIN LOCKED

5
00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:17,305
IN A BRUISING FIGHT FOR THE

00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,241
NOMINATION TO TAKE ON THE

7
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:20,475
STATE'S POPULAR DEMOCRATIC

8
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:20,875
GOVERNOR.

9
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,144
WITH THAT WE BRING IN OUR TALK

10
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:25,914
RADIO PANEL, RADIO HOST RJ

HARRIS FROM HARRISBURG, PA, A

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,584
FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND NOTED

13
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:29,951
EXPERT.

14
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:32,587
AND TOM HEARTLAND FROM PORTLAND,

15
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:32,988
OREGON.

16
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:34,923
I APPRECIATE BOTH YOU GUYS BEING

17
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:35,223
HERE.

18
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:35,957
>> NICE TO BE HERE.

19
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:37,325
LELAND: RJ, PULLED OUT SOME OF

20
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:39,261
THE ADS AND TALKING POINTS FROM

21
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:40,395
THE REPUBLICAN RACE IN PA.

22
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:42,731
SOME OF THE WORDS THROWN AROUND,

23
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:45,267
SLIMEBALL, DEADBEAT, PHONY AND

24
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:47,502
THOSE ARE THE NICE ONES.

25
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:50,705
UP THERE REAGAN'S 11TH

26
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:52,274
COMMANDMENT SOMEHOW GOT

27
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:52,641
FORGOTTEN.

28
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:54,709
>> WELL, IT DID AND I THINK IT'S

29
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,778
BECAUSE SCOTT WAGNER'S CURRENT

30
00:00:56,778 --> 00:00:59,381
STATE SENATOR HAD SUCH A SIZABLE

31
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:00,982
LEAD THAT PAUL MANGO THOUGHT HE

32
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:02,217
HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO REALLY

33
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:04,218
SEPARATE HIMSELF.

34
00:01:04,218 --> 00:01:06,154
NOW, THEY ARGUE WHO WENT

35
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:07,455
NEGATIVE FIRST, BUT I THINK THAT

36
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:09,824
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT PAUL

37
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:11,926
MANGO'S COMMERCIALS WERE REALLY

38
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:14,162
JUST BRUTAL AND LAURA ELLSOWRTH

39
00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:16,431
IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LOOKING

40
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:17,565
GOOD BECAUSE SHE REALLY DIDN'T

41
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:18,900
PARTICIPATE EXCEPT POINTING OUT

42
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,869
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE AT EACH

43
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,003
OTHER'S THROATS.

44
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,205
LELAND: IN THE POST TRUMP ERA,

45
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:26,441
DOES TAKING THE HIGH ROAD MATTER

46
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:26,775
ANYMORE?

47
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:28,443
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SO, IN FACT,

48
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:29,811
SUSQUAHANNA POLLING RELEASED A

49
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:31,646
POLL ON THURSDAY THAT SHOWS THAT

50
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:35,617
SCOTT WAGNER'S AT 37%, AND

51
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,085
MANGO'S AT 22.

52
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,120
LAURA ELLSOWRTH THOUGH WENT FROM

53
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,322
2% TO 18.

54
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:41,856
SO, SHE HAD QUITE A BIT OF A

55
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:44,659
JUMP AND IT'S ABOUT 22%

56
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,261
UNDECIDED, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

57
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,262
THE NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING THAT

58
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:49,230
WENT ON, SCOTT WAGNER STILL HAS

59
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,466
A PRETTY COMMANDING LEAD.

60
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:55,070
LELAND: TOM, WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS

61
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:57,038
WITH RJ IS DESCRIBING THERE IN

62
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:58,106
OHIO, IS THAT EVERYBODY IS

63
00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,374
BEATING UP ON EACH OTHER ON THE

64
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:00,575
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND YOU'VE GOT

65
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:01,876
GOVERNOR WOLF THERE, THE

66
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,445
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, WHO IS

67
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:05,046
SKATING THROUGH UNSCATHED AND

68
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:06,781
PROTECTING HIS WAR CHEST RIGHT

69
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:07,082
NOW.

70
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:09,017
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT HE'S

71
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:10,585
RECORDING EVERY ONE OF THESE ADS

72
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:11,353
OF THE REPUBLICANS ATTACKING

73
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:12,020
EACH OTHER?

74
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,521
>> YEAH, PART OF THE PROBLEM, I

75
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:14,923
THINK, THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE

76
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:16,424
RIGHT NOW IS THE TONE THAT'S

77
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:18,093
BEEN SET FROM THE TOP, FROM THE

78
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,328
TRUMP CRIME FAMILY ON DOWN,

79
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:21,396
WHERE, YOU'VE GOT THE WHITE

80
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:23,031
HOUSE REFUSING TO WALK BACK A

81
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:24,299
STATEMENT BY ONE OF THEIR

82
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,601
STAFFERS THAT JOHN MCCAIN IS

83
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:29,437
JUST DYING, DOESN'T MATTER.

84
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:30,772
IT'S REALLY TRAGIC THE TONE THAT

85
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:32,540
HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND I THINK

86
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,476
IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CORE

87
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:35,543
VALUES ANY LONGER ASSOCIATED

88
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:37,045
WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, OTHER

89
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:39,481
THAN LOYALTY TO THE

90
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,216
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, LOYALTY

91
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:43,284
TO THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY,

92
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:46,221
LOYALTY TO THE POLLUTERS, NO

93
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:47,255
LOYALTY TO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN.

94
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:48,656
LELAND: RJ WANTS TO GET IN HERE

95
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:50,058
ON A COUPLE OF THE TALKING

96
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:50,392
POINTS.

97
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:50,859
>> GO FOR IT.

98
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:53,294
LELAND: I'LL ASK YOU THIS, RJ,

99
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:56,364
THE PRESIDENT'S COATTAILS IN

100
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:57,098
PENNSYLVANIA AREN'T WHAT YOU

101
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:59,501
THINK THEY'D BE FOR A MAN WHO

102
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,835
TURNED THAT STATE RED.

103
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:03,805
>> I THINK THAT WE'RE REALLY

104
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,840
TAKING THE CANDIDATES AS THEY

105
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,975
COME HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, BUT,

106
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:11,146
YOU KNOW, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE

107
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,647
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT MARRIED

108
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:13,748
TO ALL THE THINGS THAT TOM

109
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:14,315
TALKED ABOUT.

110
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:16,050
THE TAX CUTS WERE FOR THE

111
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,818
WORKING PEOPLE.

112
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:21,022
>> THEY'RE FOR BILLIONAIRES.

113
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:22,624
>> COME ON, REAL?

114
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:25,827
I SAW AN INCREASE IN MY PAYCHECK

115
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:28,129
AND I'M A WORKING STIFF.

116
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:31,032
>> IF YOU WERE A BILLIONAIRE YOU

117
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:32,767
HAD A HE SEE A REAL INCREASE.

118
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:33,868
LELAND: ISN'T THAT HOW--

119
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:36,037
>> THAT WASN'T FOR THE OBAMA TAX

120
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:37,338
CUTS, IT WAS THE LARGEST TAX CUT

121
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:38,206
FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THE

122
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,507
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.

123
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,176
THIS WAS LARGEST TAX CUT FOR THE

124
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,243
BILLIONAIRES IN THE HISTORY OF

125
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:43,178
THE UNITED STATES.

126
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:44,779
>> ALL OBAMAS EVER DONE IS GIVE

127
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,581
MONEY AWAY AND WE WORKING PEOPLE

128
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:49,117
HAVE TO GO OUT AND PAY FOR IT.

129
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,953
THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU OUGHT TO

130
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:56,157
GO BECOME A BILLIONAIRE, THAT'S

131
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:57,725
WHAT THE AMERICAN DREAM IS

132
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:58,026
ABOUT.

133
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:58,860
>> THE AMERICAN DREAM IS RAISE

134
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,162
YOUR KIDS, HAVE A DECENT JOB AND

135
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:02,330
BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS.

136
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,666
>> AND, AND HAVE THE

137
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,066
GOVERNMENT--

138
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:05,433
AND TOM.

139
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,734
>> WE SHOULD BE JEALOUS OF THE

140
00:04:06,734 --> 00:00:00,000
RICH PEOPLE AND WAIT FOR THEIR
