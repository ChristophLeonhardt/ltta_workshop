what are the consequences of so let's assume that's true for a second what are the consequences of that what did so Putin preferred Trump but why would he prefer Trump well one of the reasons was Putin is backing Assad in Syria that's his ally Trump had said repeatedly on the campaign trail look I'm not gonna get involved in Syria let's let bladder Putin handle Isis and let's leave the Assad government alone now I hate to be contrarian here but I totally agree with them on that point now unfortunately Trump didn't actually follow through with that which gets to the point of I think the evidence being flimsy overall for some sort of a deal between the Russian government and Trump or Putin and Trump because so at the end of the day what can you point to where you say oh no he definitely did a deal with them you could point to for example oh he didn't implement the sanctions over the election meddling but yeah that's kind of a big deal well but then but then that's only one-fifth of the picture because for example Trump did just three days before that story came out jank on that Friday CNN had an article about had they just implemented a new round of sanctions over Crimea so okay he doesn't do one set of sanctions but he does a different set of sanctions then like I said he armed Ukrainian rebels who are anti Russia so it's a weird thing to do if you're that guy's puppet to arm the people who are fighting him then he bombed the Syrian government that happened a few months ago and then he they also recently the State Department announced this we're staying in Syria indefinitely you know that was a huge story to me but it got next to no coverage in the media because again that's one of those stories where if you cover that the only logical takeaway is well he's definitely not acting like Putin's puppet if he wants to permanently militarily occupy the nation to be against the government that his Putin's a lie that's a weird way to be a puppet to somebody and then like I brought up before he kept NATO troops on Russia's doorstep they're there right now and he didn't approve the Exxon oil deal so yes I grant you that okay he didn't implement the the sanctions over the so-called election that's one policy that could be viewed as pro-putin but I just gave you five others that are massively anti-putin and this goes back to the point I made at the beginning while I Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia issue is bigger to me and the Israel issue is bigger to me we haven't even discussed the Israel one in detail because if you do a deal with those governments the downsides are actually worse so the downside of a Saudi deal is we just gave a theocratic dictatorship three hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of weapons and they're bombing women and children in Yemen you know the consequences of a deal with Israel is Jared Kushner for example took a lot of money from Israeli banks and in turn the Israeli government called the Trump administration when he was president-elect and they got them to fight back against the UN they said call all the countries you have connections with at the UN and try to get them to be against the resolution condemning the illegal settlements so that's collusion where they're doing something in favor of a government and I think it's way more damaging than for example if he did Putin's bidding and stay out of Syria in fact I would have liked it if they stayed a decision so look the fact that you might like a couple of those positions whether they were derived from collusion or not and as part of a deal with Trump or not to me is immaterial yeah I don't want to do bombing in Syria either but that the but if I find out it was because Trump not out of the goodness of his heart or because he had the correct policy position did it because of what he owed the Russians I'm gonna have an issue with that on principle sure you could do that yeah and and come on look at the way that he did the Syrian bombing Oh golly gee I am going to bomb those dastardly Syrians I will bomb and an airway that they are not a runway that they are not using I will bomb old planes that they are not using the new planes are in the hangar right where I know exactly where they are but I will not bomb them but look at me getting tough on Russia well why stay there indefinitely then okay so that's point number two great question so Donald Trump is not thank God not the dictator there are a lot of things he wants to do and he keeps getting blocked everybody knows that he didn't want to do the sanctions on Russia they passed that ninety eight to two in the Senate overwhelmingly in the house and he signed it even though he said I don't want to sign it he had to sign it and then there is yes for said playing calm these thing called midstate whatever you like right more hawkish on Russia all state they're all in favor of hawkish this everywhere and including on Russia so they put a ton of pressure to heiio mr. president you got to stay in there and the knucklehead from time to time goes oh yeah okay who was the last guy in the building okay that guy all right fine yeah and and and now John Kelly's his chief of staff and he's largely driving policy now when you on the on the issue of the sanctions one of the things that they quote unquote implemented was they came up with a list of Russian oligarchs and then said okay here's a list because you made us do it because it's in this goddamn bill that we didn't want to sign now what are we gonna do about it oh nothing we're not gonna freeze their assets we're not gonna do anything it's just a list okay are you happy now so no the main thing is the sanctions and I said that he would not impose those then he was forced to sign it and then he refused to impose him anyway even though it's his legal obligation to do so gee I wonder why he did that
