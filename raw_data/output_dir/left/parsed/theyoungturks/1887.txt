>>A THREE YEAR OLD GIRL IN INDIANA
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT HER PREGNANT
MOTHER AND A VEHICLE AS THEY
WERE WAITING FOR THEIR FATHER TO
RETURN FROM THRIFT STORE.
THEY WERE IN A PARKING LOT NEAR
THE THRIFT STORE AND APPARENTLY
THE FATHER WAS THE ONE WHO LEFT
HIS GUN IN THE CENTER CONSOLE
OF THE CAR.
AT THE TIME THERE WERE OTHER
CHILDREN IN THE CAR INCLUDING
THE ONE-YEAR-OLD BROTHER.
LUCKILY THE MOTHER IS IN THE
HOSPITAL, HAS NOT PASSED AWAY
FROM THE WOUND AND IS
EXPECTED TO STABILIZE.
THE FATHER HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR
LEAVING HIS GUN IN THE CAR.
>>CHILD ENDANGERMENT.
HE DIDN'T PULL IT, OBVIOUSLY THE
THREE-YEAR-OLD DID.
IS ENDANGERING THE KIDS THAT
GOT HIM ARRESTED.
A WITNESS SAID WHAT I SAW WAS A
LADY, SHE WAS ALMOST ABOUT TO
FALL.
SHE WAS BLEEDING OUT WITH A
BUCKET OF BLOOD ON THE GROUND.
AND I JUST SAW TWO KIDS
STANDING THERE.
THE THREE-YEAR-OLD WHO
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT THE MOM HAS
GOT TO BE HORRIFIED.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HER MOM
SCREAMING AND DYING IN FRONT OF
HER SAID GOD SHE DIDN'T DIE.
AND EVERY GUN OWNER SAYS I AM
RESPONSIBLE, I WOULD NEVER DO
THAT.
AND DAY AFTER DAY, PEOPLE DO IT.
NO 
THREE-YEAR-OLD ACCIDENTALLY
HIDES A GIANT ROPE OR DRIVES A
TRUCK OR DOES A MASS STABBING.
PULLING A TRIGGER SUPER EASY.
THE WHOLE POINT OF GUNS IS
TO KILL THINGS.
>> THIS IS JUST A HORRIFIC STORY
THROUGH AND THROUGH THE WAY IT
UNFOLDED.
THE THING THE GUY YELLED
ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE
WITNESSES WHEN THIS MAN LEFT HIS
GUN COMES OUT AFTER HEARING IT
GO OFF SAYS Ã± THE BOYFRIEND WENT
OUTSIDE BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD HIM
THERE WAS A GIRL BLEEDING.
AND HE COMES OUT YELLING DID YOU
KILL YOURSELF, DID YOU KILL
YOURSELF?
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT A FAMILY WITH A SEVERE
AMOUNT OF WEIRD ISSUES NOT MADE
BETTER BY HAVING A GUN IN THE
CONSOLE.
>>I FEEL AS THOUGH IF I WAS
LIVING IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE ONE
OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT GIVE
OFF A VIBE THAT THEY ARE
CONSIDERING SUICIDE, MAYBE I
WOULDN'T HAVE A GUN IN THAT
HOUSE.
OR MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE A GUN
IN THE CAR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY
TO KIDS.
I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL YOU
SAID THAT THE WHY WOULD YOU
THINK YOUR WIFE WOULD KILL
HERSELF?
>> THE GUN, YOU THINK IT'S
GOING TO KEEP YOU SAFE.
WITH KIDS IN THE HOUSE, THE
CHANCE OF YOU ARE ONE OF THE
KIDS KILLING THEMSELVES
ACCIDENTALLY IS SO MUCH HIGHER
THAN SOME INTRUDER BREAKING INTO
YOUR HOUSE AND YOU HEROICALLY
PULLING UP THE GUN IN THE NICK
OF TIME AND SHOOTING THE GUN
FOR HE GETS YOU GUYS.
THAT ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS.
ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.
OVER 500 PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR
JUST FROM ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS.
IT'S 
THE GUNS.
