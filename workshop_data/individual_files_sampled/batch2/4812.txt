of just tonight stumbled upon evidence of shame if not accountability at least a little bit of shame in American politics it's so unfamiliar it feels like we are covering something in a foreign language but I swear this really happened today knock me over with a feather I swear this happened all right you might remember early this year we learned that Ben Carson who had been a Republican presidential candidate you ran against Trump in the primaries then he endorsed Trump for president after he dropped out of the primaries then Trump named ben Carson to his cabinet named him Secretary of HUD Housing and Urban Development you might remember early this year that we learned that Ben Carson upon moving into HUD as the head of that new agency he decided that he needed a $31,000 table for his office remember that it was kind of like a dining set I'm not clear why you'd need a dining set in your office if he dines in his office I don't know I'd dine in my office but I do so over the keyboard unfortunately but ben Carson wanted a $31,000 table to dine the way that weird little scandal shook out is that a career official at HUD told Ben Carson that he couldn't do that she was like listen there's a dollar limit on what you can spend to renovate your office you're a public servant you're spending taxpayer money it's like a $5,000 limit for you doing renovations for your whole office under no math good a $31,000 table fit under that threshold for renovating your office and so this career official at HUD told him no you can't you can't do that you're a public official now and so obviously they had to get rid of her they got that career official right out of there and they brought in someone more amenable to the ways and desires and furniture tastes of this new administration they brought in someone who had worked on the Trump campaign she's a lawyer I believe she's from Queens she had no relevant experience whatsoever but she'd worked on the campaign so they brought her in she took a look at that table in the way she saw it she actually saw that is quite a legitimate expense she approved it it is nice to have people like that you can bring in when you need them right and trust me there are many instances in which you need people like that in the Trump administration behold ryan's inky ryan's inky was a Republican member of Congress before Trump named him to run the Department of the Interior Department of the Interior is not the world's most high-profile agency one gets the sense though from mr. Zinke that he would like to make that job as high-profile as he can he you might remember he's the Trump cabinet officer who rode a horse to work on his first day on the job he used taxpayer expenses taxpayer funds to stop traffic in that entire part of Washington DC so he could show up on a horse because he thought that would be cool once he dismounted and made it inside the building secretaries Inc he soon made it a new practice at the Department of the Interior that a staff member would be assigned to I kid you not to run to the roof of the building with secretaries inky's personal flag to run that up the flagpole whenever Ryan Zinke was at his desk so everybody could tell from a distance or maybe even from a passing plane that Ryan's Enki was in the house it has been a sort of hallmark of Ryan's inky's political career that he has sometimes overdone it a little bit with the visuals when he was running for Congress he worked a lot of his fellow Navy veterans by putting the trident symbol for the Navy SEALs on the side of his campaign bus which sort of implied that the Navy SEALs were endorsing him and his candidacy that was further complicated by the fact that it only emerged after Trump nominated him to this cabinet job that what had actually derailed Ryan's inky's career in the Navy was that he got in trouble during his time in the service he got in trouble specifically for chiseling the government on his travel expenses which perhaps should have been a little bit more of a red flag the Trump administration was prepared to notice when they nominated him for the cabinet but the nominated Limi got through and since Ryan Zinke got that job at the Interior Department he has had you know tax payers pay for a private jet flight on an aircraft owned by an executive from an oil and gas company in Wyoming after he gave a motivational speech in Las Vegas to a hockey team owned by one of his biggest campaign donors he took that private jet ride from Las Vegas back to his house in Montana he's also charged taxpayers to pay for his private jet flights to Republican fundraisers and then there's the multiple private jet flights he charged to US taxpayers for flights to and around the US Virgin Islands including for what sounds like a super awesome snorkeling tour tax payers paid to fly him to that on a chartered jet ultimately Trump health secretary Tom Price who had to resign in disgrace and then Trump's EPA Administrator Scott Pruett who had to resign in disgrace they've sort of gotten all the glory for being the most flamboyant ly unsustainably corrupt members of the Trump cabinet yet but you know Ryan's inky has always been a contender do not count him out his behavior in office led ultimately to the independent inspector general at the Interior Department starting four different simultaneous ethics investigations into zenki's behavior since he's been running that agency now if you're the Trump administration that just seems like a terrible idea right an independent investigation of Ryan's inky why would we allow that why are we allowing that why would we let that go forward hey where's the dining set lady what's she doing now couldn't we get her to fix this too that is literally what they tried to do two days ago the hill newspaper was first to report on an email from HUD dining set secretary ben Carson congratulating this woman who had worked on the Trump campaign and who and who worked in Carson's office the email was congratulating her on her graduating from Ben Carson's office at HUD which is where she approved the dining set he was sending this email to let everybody in the agency know that she was on her way up because she was moving up because she was getting what is actually a really serious and prestigious job Ben Carson's email again first reported two days ago announced that this woman from his office would now be leaving HUD and she'd be moving over to the Department of Interior to become the independent Inspector General of the Interior Department wow that is a big promotion now there are obviously a few little problems with the idea of this person becoming the Inspector General at Ryan's inky's agency number one she's the dining set person she really is the person who was brought in to excuse Ben Carson's $31,000 table and that's corruption and ethics and waste problems there in that's not a great background for an intimate for an Inspector General who's supposed to ferret that kind of stuff out number two she has absolutely zero experience in anything related to the Department of Interior more importantly number three she has absolutely zero experience when it comes to investigations of any kind so did you say there are four active simultaneously simultaneous ethics investigations into Ryan's inky well this person will be perfect prayer in so Ben Carson makes this announcement to his staff we're so sorry to see you go you'll be great at your inspector general job at the Interior Department congratulations meanwhile the actual inspector general at the Interior Department the one who's doing these four simultaneous investigations of thinking she learns about this when a colleague shows her Ben Carson's email that's how she learns the news that somebody new is apparently coming on over to take her job to her credit she basically refused to acknowledge that that was any real indication that she had been fired she continued on waiting to actually hear officially that she was out of a job but for the past couple of days it looked like this was going was that the US federal government under this president was going to hit yet another new low right when it comes to the tolerance of and even the sort of celebration of just rank corruption right you've got a professional experienced independent Inspector General running for active investigations into a trump cabinet secretary she's gonna get fired she's gonna be replaced by someone with no experience whatsoever except that this new person worked for the Trump campaign and has helped them cover up ethics scandals before me for the last couple of days that looked like where this was definitely heading but then but then Shane woke up Democrats on the committee in Congress that oversees the Interior Department they wrote to what is basically the association of inspectors general in the US government the recent an association like that exists is because being an inspector general at a cabinet level agency it's a big deal inspectors general have a lot of power it's a very serious job it's a job for which independence and professionalism are seen as absolutely paramount and because of that to a certain extent the Inspector General community they kind of self police they have an association they try to make sure that these important sensitive Inspector General jobs only go to people who are capable of doing that kind of work who have a relevant experience and who can do that work with unimpeachable integrity so the Democrats it occurs to them hey maybe we should write to the association of inspectors general and say hey the dining room set from Ben Carson's office really she's gonna be an Inspector General now for a cabinet agency that's not actually how they put it they put it this way quote the mere threat of replacing an Inspector General when the head of the agency at oversees is under heavy scrutiny we'll send a signal to current and future IGS throughout the federal government that releasing unfavorable findings may threaten their job quote it creates a permanent disincentive for the candor required for an effective IG and severs the independence that is the foundation of effective oversight over federal government waste fraud and abuse so they send that off and I know at this point you're thinking Oh Democrats that's cute right you're in the minority in the house which means you don't have any real power Republicans clearly do not care about this when there's a Republican administration doing it Trump administration gets away with stuff like this and worse on a daily basis right under the Trump administration they have very quickly completely degraded any ideas or expectations that we have about corruption and abuse and nepotism and conflicts of interest so you know why bother well you bother because sometimes it works and in this case lo and behold shame makes an appearance in the Trump administration I mean kind of they're not of course you know shamefacedly admitting what they were trying to get away with here but they did get caught here they got confronted about it and now they have ended up climbing down you might have seen this headline in the Washington Post today Trump administration does about-face on its own announcement that top aide at HUD would be interiors watchdog that's a lot of words but it means they gave up on this scheme I mean the way they have decided to get out of this to climb down from this is Dinky's office telling reporters that this was never the plan we don't know what you're talking about why do you think it was the plan oh that Ben Carson email that said this was the plan that was Ben Carson just screwing up Dinky's office put out a statement today saying the email from ben Carson was quote 100% false information when he said this woman from HUD was going to become the new inspector general I mean I think this is what shame actually looks like with these guys even when you get caught and you have to climb down still pick a fight about it blame someone else pretend to still be on offense but but what they were trying to pull off with this Inspector General switcheroo there no not doing it so to the Democrats who pushed on this this is one of those rare examples that shows the fighting over the stuff sometimes works you can't win it you don't play right I mean even when it seems futile right we are we are I understand why it sometimes seems futile we are we're in a new era where the president is retaining his private business interests and keeping all of his finances secret and he's giving senior jobs to his kids and he's hired cabinet officials and senior regulatory advisors who came into government service and immediately started making policy to benefit their own business interests which they then lied about I mean it's exhausting right just just big picture imagine any other time in US history when we would be heading into a congressional election while the president's campaign chair deputy campaign chair national security adviser and longtime personal lawyer are all going to prison they're all awaiting sentencing even before this presidency made it to its first midterm election we've never been in this dire a place in terms of ethics and criminality and I'm including Watergate and teapot dome and everything else you can imagine but what are we as citizens do about it and what do we want our public officials to do about it the solution can't be to you know just lower the bar give up your expectations throw your hands up and accept okay this is how corrupt America is now I mean unless we want to go down in history as the generation that said it's okay for the federal government to become quickly more wildly and flagrantly corrupt than it has ever been in this country since our founding if we don't want to be the generation that decided that was cool and we weren't gonna peep about it that means you do have to fight about it when you find out about corruption even when you find out about some new element of it every day you have to cry foul you have to denounce it and put up a fight not because you're gonna win every time you won't but because a we all have to answer for ourselves in our lives at some point and you are complicit in it if you say nothing and be more practically if you do choose to fight every once in a while you might win and so tonight the Inspector General's Office at the Interior Department which is still intact they have started to release some of their findings on Ryan's Enki and his wife and their tax funded travel arrangements there are still multiple investigations underway apparently that Inspector General will now be allowed to stay there and complete that work hey there are misses from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date
