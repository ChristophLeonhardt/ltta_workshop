1
00:00:00,803 --> 00:00:01,236
PATRIOTS.

2
00:00:01,236 --> 00:00:02,204
>> Martha: EXACTLY.

3
00:00:02,204 --> 00:00:04,239
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

4
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,741
I HAVE OTHER REASONS.

5
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:06,942
>> GOD LOVE YOUR HONESTY.

6
00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:08,577
>> Martha: JOINING ME NOW IS

7
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:10,279
A NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER

8
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,613
FOR AXIOS.

9
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:13,048
JONATHAN, GREAT TO HAVE YOU

10
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:13,348
HERE.

11
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:14,149
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

12
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,451
ONE ISSUE THAT THE JUDGE AND I

13
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,353
DIDN'T GET TO IS THE ISSUE OF

14
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:19,822
THE DICTATION BY THE PRESIDENT

15
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:25,227
OF THE RESPONSE TO DONALD

16
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:26,395
JUNIOR'S MEETING AT TRUMP

17
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:26,829
TOWER.

18
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,464
WHY IS IT PROBLEMATIC HE WOULD

19
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:33,435
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT?

20
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:34,837
>> IT WAS PROBLEMATIC IN THE

21
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:35,938
FIRST INSTANCE BECAUSE THE

22
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:37,673
STATEMENT WAS MISLEADING.

23
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:39,508
>> Martha: HOW WAS IT

24
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:39,975
MISLEADING?

25
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:41,143
>> THEY SAID IT WAS ABOUT

26
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:41,643
RUSSIAN ADOPTION.

27
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:43,846
THE MEETING THAT DON JUNIOR

28
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:45,180
HAD WITH THE RUSSIANS.

29
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,620
AND OBVIOUSLY, THAT WAS A

30
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,020
PRETEXT.

31
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,621
>> Martha: WASN'T THAT

32
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,489
SOMETHING THAT THE RUSSIAN

33
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:54,823
LAWYER AND THAT GROUP HAD BEEN

34
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:55,958
LOBBYING FOR AND WORKING ON

35
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,025
FOR A LONG TIME?

36
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,126
>> NO QUESTION.

37
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,962
BUT AS THE TRUMP TEAM WOULD

38
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:01,563
NOW ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEETING

39
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:04,733
ALSO INCLUDED SOME OTHER FAIRY

40
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,934
RELEVANT THINGS INCLUDING THE

41
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,936
E-MAILS TO SET IT UP WHICH DON

42
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:10,806
JUNIOR AGREED WITH SAYING

43
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:11,240
THEY --

44
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,040
>> I LOVE IT.

45
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,741
COME ON IN.

46
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,343
I LOVE IT.

47
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,512
IS IT POSSIBLE -- I'M CURIOUS

48
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:17,613
ABOUT THIS.

49
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,548
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT IS

50
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:20,616
WHAT THEY LURED HIM WITH AND

51
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:23,118
THEY WANTED TO TALK TO HIM

52
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:24,119
ABOUT THE OTHER THING AND

53
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:24,987
DIDN'T HAVE THE DIRT.

54
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:26,255
THEY WANTED HIM IN THE ROOM

55
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:27,256
AND FIGURED THAT WOULD WORK.

56
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:28,357
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID WHO

57
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:29,525
WOULDN'T TAKE THE MEETING IN

58
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,927
TODAY'S POLITICS?

59
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:33,495
>> BUT THE TO YOUR QUESTION I

60
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:35,097
DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS LEGALLY

61
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:35,731
PROBLEMATIC.

62
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,766
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL TO LIE TO THE

63
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,602
NEWS MEDIA OR THE "NEW YORK

64
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:41,036
TIMES."

65
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:43,138
THE PRESENT HASN'T SPOKEN TO

66
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:45,107
ROBERT MUELLER AND RUDY

67
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,241
GIULIANI CONTINUALLY REMINDS

68
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,010
US ONE REASON HE HASN'T SPOKEN

69
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,578
TO MUELLER AND THEY'VE BEEN

70
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:51,146
RESTRAINING THAT, THEY DON'T

71
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:53,215
WANT HIM TO PURGER HIMSELF.

72
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,317
SO THIS IS RUDY GIULIANI,

73
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:56,318
LITERALLY SAID THAT.

74
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:58,520
HE SAID WE ARE SHIFTING

75
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,621
EXPLANATIONS AND THE

76
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,623
MISLEADING STATEMENTS, THIS IS

77
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:02,624
WHY WE DON'T WANT THE

78
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,926
PRESIDENT INTERVIEWED BY BOB

79
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:04,326
MUELLER.

80
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:05,227
>> Martha: WHAT IS YOUR

81
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:06,461
SENSE AT THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT

82
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:07,863
NOW ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT

83
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:08,964
ALL OF THIS?

84
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:10,465
BECAUSE TODAY, YOU KNOW, ALL

85
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:11,867
THE CONVERSATIONS I JUST SAID,

86
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,168
THE 500th DAY IN OFFICE.

87
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,303
BUT ALL THE CONVERSATION IS

88
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:15,404
ABOUT THE COMMENTS OVER THE

89
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:15,804
WEEKEND.

90
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:16,872
THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT HE

91
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:18,440
COULD PARDON HIMSELF IF HE

92
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,576
WANTED TO, AND THAT THE

93
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:21,710
INVESTIGATION IS

94
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,210
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

95
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,745
AS FAR AS THE MESSAGE

96
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,982
STRUCTURING GOES, THIS IS A

97
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,251
FAILURE.

98
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:32,054
>> SO, THERE IS TWO PARTS TO

99
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:32,554
THIS THING.

100
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:34,122
IF I READ ABOUT THE MOOD OF

101
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:34,723
THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE

102
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:36,124
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.

103
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:36,858
IT'S NONSENSE.

104
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:38,126
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

105
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:40,162
RUSSIA THE ONE WORD NOBODY IN

106
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,196
THE WEST WING TALKS ABOUT.

107
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:42,397
THEY DON'T HAVE MEETINGS ABOUT

108
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:42,664
IT.

109
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,466
IF THERE IS ANY MENTION OF IT

110
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,034
PEOPLE TRY TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

111
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:47,469
LIKE A WORD NO ONE WANTS

112
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,470
ANYTHING TO DO WITH.

113
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,439
THAT BEING SAID, THERE IS THIS

114
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,074
DYNAMIC PARTICULARLY IN THE

115
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:54,276
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SHOP WHERE

116
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,377
THEY ARE WATCHING THE SHOW

117
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:56,645
LIKE THE REST OF US.

118
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:58,347
THEY HAVE NO EARTHLY IDEA WHAT

119
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:00,482
RUDY GIULIANI IS GOING TO SAY,

120
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:02,317
YOU KNOW, TO WHOEVER IN THE

121
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:05,554
NEXT MINUTE OR ON TV TONIGHT.

122
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:06,622
IT'S THIS COMPLETELY

123
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:08,023
SEPARATION OPERATION.

124
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,424
HONESTLY, THEY VIEW IT AS A

125
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:10,258
CIRCUS A LOT OF THEM.

126
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,426
THEY SEE THIS, THEY DON'T KNOW

127
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,561
WHAT IS GOING ON, THEY DON'T

128
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,062
KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY.

129
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:16,131
THEY ASSUME THERE IS

130
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:16,999
COORDINATION BETWEEN RUDY

131
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:17,833
GIULIANI AND THE PRESIDENT.

132
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,635
BUT I THINK THEY ARE VERY

133
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:21,136
HAPPY TO BE OUT OF IT AND HAVE

134
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:22,404
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND

135
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:23,872
LEAVE IT TO THOSE GUYS AND THE

136
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:26,575
MORE WE CAN JUST SAY AS SPOKES

137
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:27,242
PEOPLE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE,

138
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:29,244
YOU KNOW, I DEFER TO THE

139
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:30,078
PRESIDENT'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL.

140
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:31,780
THAT IS THE MAGIC SENTENCE FOR

141
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,614
ALL OF THEM.

142
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:33,615
>> Martha: YOU CAN SENSE THE

143
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:34,683
FRUSTRATION IN THE BRIEFING

144
00:03:34,683 --> 00:03:35,984
ROOM TODAY.

145
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:36,818
>> SURE!

146
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:37,452
>> Martha: SARAH HUCKABEE

147
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,854
SANDERS SAID LOOK, THERE IS A

148
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:39,321
CHINESE WALL.

149
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:40,555
WE ARE NOT THE LEGAL TEAM.

150
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:41,790
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR

151
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,925
THEM, YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM.

152
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,128
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE LEGAL

153
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:48,597
TEAM DOES LEAK FROM TIME TO

154
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:50,098
TIME AND YOU CAN GET ANSWERS

155
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:51,366
FROM THE LEGAL TEAM IF YOU

156
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:53,135
PUSH HARD ENOUGH BUT THAT IS A

157
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,036
FRUSTRATION FOR THE PRESS

158
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:54,703
CORPS.

159
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:55,971
>> IT'S A FRUSTRATION FOR THE

160
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:58,140
PRESS TEAM AND I REMEMBER WHEN

161
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,708
JOHN DOWD WHO WROTE THAT MEMO

162
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,344
YOU TALKED ABOUT, ONE OF THE

163
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:03,945
AUTHORS OF IT, THE PRESIDENT'S

164
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:04,379
FORMER LAWYER.

165
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,847
I REMEMBER HE WAS GIVING

166
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,082
INTERVIEWS AND I TALKED TO THE

167
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:08,417
SENIOR PEOPLE IN THE WHITE

168
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,551
HOUSE PRESS SHOP AND THEY WERE

169
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,452
TEARING THEIR HAIR OUT.

170
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:12,020
THEY HAD NO IDEA SOME OF THIS

171
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,854
STUFF WAS COMING.

172
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,322
THEY HAD TO RESPOND TO IT.

173
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,957
SO IT'S NEVER BEEN COORDINATED

174
00:04:15,957 --> 00:00:00,000
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
