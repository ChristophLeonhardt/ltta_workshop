53
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:13,062

57
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,666
INTENTIONS ARE BEING TOLD

58
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,769

59
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,636

00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:58,908
DRAW THAT DISTINCTION.

83
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,176
TENNESSEE HAS BECOME A DEEP

84
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:00,743
RED STATE.

85
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:02,278

POPULAR IN TENNESSEE, HE

87
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,181
JUST DID ANOTHER RALLY THERE

88
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:06,382

89
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:07,917
TO GROW THE MARGIN EVEN

90
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:08,384

113
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:36,645
TO GET OUT THE VOTE.

114
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:37,947

WHAT TAYLOR SWIFT SAYS?

119
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,188
>> THAT WILL BE INTERESTING.

120
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,090

SOME FORM OF NEUTRALITY

125
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,933

00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:01,170
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPER

129
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:03,772
WAY TO GO AGAINST IT.

130
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:07,276

CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN HAS

134
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,014
