1
00:00:09,482 --> 00:00:10,248
>> Sean: ANDREW McCARTHY HAS

2
00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:13,285
A NEW COLUMN OUT TODAY AND IT'S

3
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:15,387
TITLED "DEMOCRATS, COMPLAINTS

4
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:17,088
ABOUT THE FBI INVESTIGATION OR

5
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,123
ABSURD."

6
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:20,425
HE JOINS US NOW, FOX NEWS LEGAL

7
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:21,893
ANALYST AT GREGG JARRETT, CHIEF

8
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:25,463
COUNSEL FOR THE JUDICIAL CRISIS

9
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:26,665
NETWORK.

10
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,732
CARRIE SEVERINO.

11
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,701
TO ME, ANDY, FROM THE BEGINNING

12
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:31,303
IT WAS, OKAY.

13
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:32,504
THESE ARE THE ALLEGATIONS.

14
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:33,438
NOW YOU ASK THE PEOPLE AND THEY

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,339
SAID IN EVERY CASE THAT THERE

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,110
WERE PEOPLE THAT COULD

17
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:39,911
CORROBORATE THIS.

18
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:41,613
UNLESS PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MIND,

19
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:43,281
REMEMBER UNDER PENALTY OF A

20
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:45,116
FELONY, THEY ARE GOING TO ADMIT

21
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:46,151
THEY COMMITTED A FELONY AND

22
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:48,420
CHANGE THEIR STORY.

23
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,523
I DON'T THINK SO.

24
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:52,791
>> THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT

25
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:54,492
DELAY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

26
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:55,961
THAT'S ALL IT'S BEEN ABOUT.

27
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:57,262
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THEY

28
00:00:57,263 --> 00:00:59,865
WERE NOT ABLE TO CORROBORATE

29
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:00,932
THOSE ALLEGATIONS.

30
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,500
I THINK THOSE ALLEGATIONS IN A

31
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:03,702
NORMAL PROCESS, HE WOULD HAVE

32
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:05,337
NEVER HEARD OF THEM, BECAUSE OF

33
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:06,771
THE WAY THE SENATE HAS TO BET

34
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:08,106
THOSE KINDS OF CLAIMS WHERE

35
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:10,809
PEOPLE SAY THEY WANT TO REMAIN

36
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,177
CONFIDENTIAL AND IF THEY CAN GO

37
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:13,311
INTO THE SORT OF THING.

38
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,313
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS WAS EVER

39
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:16,514
ABOUT.

40
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:18,416
THEY WERE RAISING CLAIMS AT THE

41
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:21,419
LAST MINUTE IN ORDER TO FORCE

42
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,557
DELAY.

43
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:26,291
AND EVERY DAY THE FBI

44
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:29,794
INVESTIGATION GOES ON THEY RAISE

45
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:30,562
NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DEPTH OF

46
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:34,332
IT.

47
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:34,933
AND THE WHOLE POINT

48
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:35,700
TRANSPARENTLY HAS BEEN TO PUSH

49
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,401
THIS BEYOND THEM AND TURNS IN

50
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:37,736
THE HOPE THAT THEY WERE IN THE

51
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:44,676
SENATE AND CAN BEAT THEM ON.

52
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:46,678
>> Sean: AS WE SPEAK, BREAKING

53
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,313
HERE ON FOX, IS ON THE SENATE

54
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:48,613
FLOOR.

55
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:51,316
IF HE FILES COAT CLOSURE THAT

56
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:52,884
WILL TEE UP A FOUR-DAY PROCESS

57
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:54,719
TO HAVE CONFIRMATION VOTE ON

58
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,854
SATURDAY.

59
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,389
THAT'S IF HE FILES CLOTURE.

60
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:07,532
WHY WOULD MITCH McCONNELL AT

61
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,501
9:52 P.M. EASTERN TIME BE ON THE

62
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:10,435
SENATE FLOOR?

63
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:11,503
>> WE GOT THE FBI REPORT WHICH

64
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:23,515
IS WHAT EVERYONE WAS WAITING FO

65
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,283
FOR -- SATURDAY WOULD BE THE

66
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:26,685
EARLIEST, LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES

67
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:28,320
FOR THE SENATORS THEMSELVES TO

68
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:28,887
LOOK AT THIS REPORT.

69
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:31,723
>> Sean: DO YOU KNOW ANYONE

70
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:32,424
THAT'S TALKED TO MURKOWSKI OR

71
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:32,757
COLLINS?

72
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:34,993
>> I KNOW McCONNELL IS TALKING

73
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:38,730
TO THEM, AND THEY HAD SAID JUST

74
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:39,264
ALONG THE LINES THAT

75
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:42,000
SENATOR McCONNELL AND SAID,

76
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,301
GIVE US A WEEK.

77
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:45,136
I THINK THAT WILL MAKE THEM MORE

78
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:47,005
COMFORTABLE, GREAT.

79
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:48,573
BUT WE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING NEW

80
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:49,174
OUT OF IT.

81
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:51,843
>> Sean: WHAT ABOUT THE

82
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:53,645
REPERCUSSIONS, GREG?

83
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:54,813
IT'S A DUE PROCESS.

84
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:57,115
>> IT'S SAD BUT THERE IS NO DUE

85
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:59,284
PROCESS, THERE IS NO FUNDAMENTAL

86
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:00,151
FAIRNESS, NO PRESUMPTION OF

87
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:03,288
INNOCENCE AMONG THE MEDIA AND

88
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,022
DEMOCRATS.

89
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:07,959
I FIND IT AMAZING NOW THAT THE

90
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,893
VERY INDIVIDUAL DIANNE FEINSTEIN

91
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:11,296
WHO CAN FEEL THE INFORMATION

92
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:12,697
INITIALLY NOW IS ATTEMPTING TO

93
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:17,002
CONCEAL THE FBI REPORT THAT SHE

94
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:17,902
DEMANDED.

95
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:19,170
THIS HAS BEEN CAREENING WILDLY

96
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:20,839
OUT OF CONTROL, AND THE ONLY WAY

97
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,707
TO SLAM THE BRAKES ON THIS

98
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,242
IMMINENT TRAIN WRECK IS TO BE

99
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:28,279
OPEN AND HONEST AND TRANSPARENT

100
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,916
AND YET, THAT'S NOT WHAT DIANNE

101
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,885
FEINSTEIN WANTS.

102
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:34,152
WHY?

103
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:35,620
MAYBE BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO

104
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,921
MISREPRESENT THE CONTENTS OF

105
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:40,325
THAT REPORT AND APPARENTLY OFFER

106
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:43,328
NO COOPERATION AND ONLY

107
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,029
REPUTATION OF THE ACCUSATIONS

108
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,965
THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT.

109
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:50,969
>> Sean: ANDY, DOES KAVANAUGH

110
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,537
GET CONFIRMED OR DO THE SMEARS

111
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,072
WORK?

112
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:58,309
>> I THINK HE GETS CONFIRMED.

113
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,677
I SAW YOU SPEAK TO NEWT GINGRICH

114
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:01,880
TONIGHT AND I THINK HE HAS IT

115
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:02,981
RIGHT, YOU WILL GET CONFIRMED.

116
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,517
>> I AGREE.

117
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:06,918
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE LIKE JOE

118
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,420
MANCHIN AND HEITKAMP, THERE'S A

119
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,721
THREE-POINT DIFFERENCE IN THOSE

120
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:10,121
STATES.

121
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:11,956
>> Sean: HE WON'T DO IT UNLESS

122
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:15,727
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE VOTE.

123
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:16,561
LAST PRODUCTION, GREGG JARRETT?

124
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:17,862
>> I THINK HE GETS CONFIRMED

125
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:19,164
THAT HE MAY ACTUALLY GET A

126
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:20,532
COUPLE DEMOCRATS ON BOARD ONCE

127
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,534
THEY READ THE CONTENTS OF HIS

128
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:23,701
FBI REPORT THAT APPARENTLY,

129
00:04:23,702 --> 00:00:00,000
THOSE OF US WHO SUFFERED THROUGH
