well he announced his presidential candidacy by attacking the globalist in office he railed against bureaucrats in Brussels who were pursuing a European super-state that threatened America's national identity he told his audience that his presidency would be built on a new nationalism focusing on the Forgotten Americans he wanted a wall across the entire southern border when he was denounced as a bigot by Donald Trump Pat Buchanan was his name they called him pitchfork Pat and if you really want to understand the moment we're living in now and then you might as well go back to its roots back to the 1990s back when everything seemed to be humming in America there was low unemployment the stock market was surging peace and prosperity for everyone to enjoy but that was just the surface beneath the surface there was sweeping transformation economic technological demographic and with all of that there were rising tensions and then from the right a cable television pundit who saw a chance to take advantage of it with a new kind of populism Pat Buchanan went straight from CNN to the presidential campaign trail in 1992 challenging the sitting president in the Republican primaries George HW Bush he'd won the Gulf War in 1991 but Buchanan said that it was all a waste Bush wanted a massive free-trade deal with Mexico NAFTA they called it but you can't have said that was a sellout a sellout of workers a sellout of America's sovereignty America first was his slogan a few years before Ronald Reagan had granted amnesty to millions who'd come to the country illegally and then built life's but Buchanan said enough was enough it was time to roll back legal immigration and also if you wanted to stop illegal immigration he said you needed a great big wall right along the Mexican border America's demographics were beginning to change and Buchanan declared that nothing less than the country's identity was that stake we must not trade in our sovereignty for a cushioned seat at the head table of anybody's new world order today we call for a new patriotism where Americans begin to put the needs of Americans first for a new nationalism we're in every negotiation be it arms control or trade the American side seeks advantage and victory for the United States Republican leaders stayed away from Pat Buchanan no governor's endorsing of no senators no members of Congress what he represents they said that's not us that's not our party but then came New Hampshire running against a sitting president in 1992 Buchanan got almost 40 percent of the vote and some say that Bush never recovered from that Buchanan couldn't win the nomination but he did get more than three million votes in 92 and Bush ended up a one-term er globalization continued to speed up the face of America continued to change four years later in 1996 Buchanan went for it again this time Bob Dole was the heavy favorite but in Iowa Buchanan nearly knocked him off and then eight days later in New Hampshire the unthinkable pitchfork Pat finished first the establishment is coming together you can hear them right now the fax machines and the phones are buzzing in Washington DC but you got to get together somebody's got to get out and take on this guy we got a one guy check him on they're gonna come after this campaign with everything they got do not wait for orders from headquarters mount up everybody in Rogers sound of the gun and in that moment it seemed like Pat Buchanan might actually run away with the Republican nomination Democrats they were almost giddy he was so extreme they figured he'd be easy to beat if he ever got that nomination Republicans they were terrified they were stunned to learn that so many of their own voters didn't mind pitch for Pat's rhetoric were they losing control of their own party well it turned out they weren't at least not yet in 96 the establishment had enough juice to stop Pat Buchanan dole did go on to win the nomination did go on to lose in November and Buchanan was starting to get tired of the GOP in 1999 he accused party leaders of rigging the primary race against him for 2000 rigging it on behalf of w bush buchanan decided to bolt the party he would run instead he said for the nomination of the Reform Party started a few years before by Ross Perot and that is when Pat Buchanan got some competition for the Reform Party nomination some surprised competition from a celebrity billionaire named Donald Trump Trump joined the Reform Party in 1999 he said he was looking at running for president and a lot of it was just like today he disparaged enemies with schoolyard taunts he talked about making Oprah his running mate he claimed to be doing great in the polls even when he wasn't he became a one-man content machine for cable news channels so much so similar but with one very big difference between the Donald Trump of 1999 and the one we know today that Pat Buchanan platform the Donald Trump of 1999 wanted no part of it critics accuse Buchanan of flirting with racism anti-semitism xenophobia and worse and Trump said he agreed with them he called Buchanan a Hitler lover an anti-semite he said Buchanan was only drawing support from a staunch right wacko vote Trump wrote an op-ed attacking Buchanan on slow days Trump wrote he attacks gays immigrants welfare recipients even Zulus when cornered he says he's misunderstood the tone was the same but the content of Donald Trump's message in 1999 could not be more different than what we've come to know tomorrow Pappy Kenan is announcing that he will be a candidate for the presidency on the Reform Party I just think it's ridiculous I mean any white book because look he's a Hitler lover I guess he's an anti-semite he doesn't like the blacks he doesn't like the gays it's just incredible that anybody could embrace this guy now in the end Trump backed out of that race and critics said hey that was proof he'd never been serious in the first place it was all just one big publicity Sun stunt and Pat Buchanan ended up getting 1% of the vote that November as the Reform Party candidate that's a tiny total but it nonetheless changed history when a poorly designed ballot in Palm Beach County led many Al Gore supporters to accidentally check off Buchanan's name even Buchanan said the votes were not intended for him but they were counted for him in a state that delivered the presidency to George W Bush by a grand total of 537 votes in and the Bush presidency of course or the Bush presidency gave us the Iraq war it gave us Afghanistan it ended with a financial crisis economic meltdown and it was sometime around then in post Bush America that Donald Trump did something very on Trump like according to reporting from Tim Alberta in Politico Trump picked up the phone called Pat Buchanan quote and apologized for all the hurtful things he had said he made amends bay buchanan pat sister and former campaign manager said of trump long before he got into the presidential race he reached out to Pat and apologized for what he'd done realizing it had been wrong and then in the America forever altered by war and by economic catastrophe Donald Trump set out to run in 2015 for president for real this time on Pat Buchanan's platform and here we are in 2018 in Donald Trump's America which was made in some ways by Pat Buchanan's campaign in the 90s if you'd like to know more about how we got here here's the shameless plug part that you can read my new book we read in the blue of the 1990s and the birth of political tribalism it is available
