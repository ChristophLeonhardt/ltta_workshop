WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE WHERE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS SPEAKING AFTER MEETING 
WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION 
PRESIDENT. 
LET'S LISTEN IN.

REPRESENTATIVE, DAN NEUHAUS.

REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI PHNOM. 
I WILL HAVE TO CALL HER

THAT WAS A GREAT WIN. 
THANK YOU. 
REPRESENTATIVE DAVID REICHERT. 
DAVID, THANK YOU. 
SO WE HAD A BIG DAY. 
VERY BIG. 
WE MET RIGHT HERE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO LAUNCH A NEW PHASE IN 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN 
UNION, A PHASE OF CLOSE 
FRIENDSHIP, OF STRONG TRADE 
RELATIONS, IN WHICH BOTH OF US 
WILL WIN. 
OF WORKING BETTER TOGETHER FOR 
GLOBAL SECURITY AND PROSPERITY 
AND A FIGHTING -- OF FIGHTING 
JOINTLY AGAINST TERRORISM. 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE 
EUROPEAN UNION TOGETHER ACCOUNT 
FOR MORE THAN 830 MILLION 
CITIZENS AND MORE THAN 50% OF 
THE GLOBAL GDP, IN OTHER WORDS, 
TOGETHER WE ARE MORE THAN 50% 
OF TRADE. 
IF WE TEAM UP, WE CAN MAKE OUR 
PLANET A BETTER, MORE SECURE, 
AND MORE PROSPEROUS PLACE. 
ALREADY, TODAY, THE UNITED 
STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION 
HAVE A $1 TRILLION BILATERAL 
TRADE RELATIONSHIP, THE LARGEST 
ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP ANYWHERE 
IN THE WORLD. 
WE WANT TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN 
THIS TRADE RELATIONSHIP TO THE 
BENEFIT OF ALL AMERICAN AND 
EUROPEAN CITIZENS. 
THIS IS WHY WE AGREED TODAY, 
FIRST OF ALL, TO WORK TOGETHER 
TOWARDS ZERO TARIFFS, ZERO 
NONTARIFF BARRIERS, AND ZERO 
SUBSIDIES ON NON-AUDIO -- NON-
AUTO INDUSTRIAL GOODS. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
WE WILL ALSO WORK TO REDUCE 
BARRIERS AND INCREASE TRADE IN 
SERVICES, CHEMICALS, 
PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL 
PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS SOYBEANS. 
SOYBEANS IS A BIG DEAL. 
THE EUROPEAN UNION IS GOING TO 
START ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO BUY 
A LOT OF SOYBEANS. 
THEY ARE A TREMENDOUS MARKET. 
TO BUY A LOT OF SOYBEANS FROM 
OUR FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST, 
PRIMARILY. 
SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
THIS WILL OPEN MARKETS FOR 
FARMERS AND WORKERS, INCREASE 
INVESTMENT, AND LEAD TO GREATER 
PROSPERITY IN BOTH UNITED 
STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
IT WILL ALSO MAKE TRADE FAIR 
AND MORE RECIPROCAL. 
MY FAVORITE WORD. 
RECIPROCAL. 
SECONDLY, WE AGREED TO A 
STRENGTHENED AND STRENGTHENING 
OF OUR STRATEGIC COOPERATION 
WITH RESPECT TO ENERGY. 
THE EUROPEAN UNION WANTS TO 
IMPORT MORE LIQUEFIED NATURALLY 
-- NATURAL GAS, LNG, FROM THE 
UNITED STATES, AND THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY BIG 
BUYER. 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER 
FOR THEM. 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE A MASSIVE 
BUYER OF LNG, SO THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR ENERGY 
SUPPLY. 
THEY WANT VERY MUCH TO DO THAT. 
WE HAVE PLENTY OF IT. 
THIRDLY, WE AGREED TODAY TO 
LAUNCH A CLOSE DIALOGUE ON 
STANDARDS IN ORDER TO EASE 
TRADE, REDUCE BUREAUCRATIC 
OBSTACLES, AND/COSTS 
DRAMATICALLY. 
FOURTHLY WE AGREED TO JOIN 
FORCES TO PROTECT AMERICAN AND 
EUROPEAN COMPANIES FROM BETTER 
AND REALLY BETTER THAN EVER. 
WE HAVE NEVER DONE LIKE WE ARE 
DOING. 
I CAN SAY FROM THE STANDPOINT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE 
NEVER DONE THIS WELL, BUT WE 
ARE GOING TO DO A LOT BETTER 
AFTER WE DO THIS DEAL  AND 
OTHER DEALS THAT WE ARE 
CURRENTLY WORKING ON. 
LIKEWISE, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS 
GOING TO DO BETTER, STRONGER, 
BIGGER. 
WE WILL, THEREFORE, WORK 
CLOSELY TOGETHER WITH LIKE-
MINDED PARTNERS TO REFORM THE 
WTO AND TO ADDRESS UNFAIR 
TRADING PRACTICES, INCLUDING 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT, 
FORCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, 
INDUSTRIAL SUBSIDIES TO -- 
DISTORTIONS CREATED BY STATE 
OWNED ENTERPRISES, AND 
OVERCAPACITY. 
WE HAVE DECIDED TO SET UP 
IMMEDIATELY AN EXECUTIVE 
WORKING GROUP OF VERY 
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ON BOTH 
SIDES. 
THEY WILL BE OUR CLOSEST 
ADVISORS, AND THEY ARE GOING TO 
CARRY OUT THIS JOINT AGENDA. 
IN ADDITION, IT WILL IDENTIFY 
SHORT-TERM MEASURES TO 
FACILITATE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGES 
AND SS EXISTING TARIFF MEASURES 
AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT 
TO THE BETTERMENT OF BOTH. 
WHILE WE ARE WORKING ON THIS, 
WE WILL NOT GO AGAINST THE 
SPIRIT OF THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS 
EITHER PARTY TERMINATES THE 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
WE ARE STARTING THE NEGOTIATION 
RIGHT NOW. 
WE KNOW VERY MUCH WHERE IT IS 
GOING. 
WE ALSO WILL RESOLVE THE STEEL 
AND ALUMINUM TARIFF ISSUES, AND 
WE WILL RESOLVE RETALIATORY 
TARIFFS. 
WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE 
RETALIATORY, AND THAT WILL GET 
RESOLVED AS PART OF WHAT WE ARE 
DOING. 
WITH THAT, JEAN-CLAUDE, PLEASE. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND 
JUDGMENT, WHEN I WAS INVITED BY 
THE PRESIDENT TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, I HAD ONE INTENTION. 
I HAD THE INTENTION TO MAKE A 
DEAL TODAY. 
AND WE MADE A DEAL. 
TODAY. 
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF 
AREAS IN WHICH TO WORK TOGETHER.
WORK TOWARDS THE ZERO TARIFFS 
ON INDUSTRIAL GOODS. 
THAT WAS MY MAIN ATTENTION, TO 
PROPOSE, TO COME DOWN TO ZERO 
TARIFFS ON INDUSTRIAL GOODS. WE 
HAVE DECIDED TO STRENGTHEN OUR 
COOPERATION ON ENERGY. 
YOU WILL BUILD MORE TERMINALS 
TO IMPORT LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS 
FROM THE U.S. THIS IS ALSO A 
MESSAGE FOR OTHERS. 
WE AGREED TO ESTABLISH A 
DIALOGUE ON STANDARDS. 
AS FAR AS AGRICULTURE IS 
CONCERNED, THE EUROPEAN UNION 
CAN IMPORT MORE SO BEANS FROM 
THE USA. 
WE ALSO AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER 
UNDER REFORM OF THE WTI. 
THIS, OF COURSE, IS ON THE 
UNDERSTANDING THAT, AS LONG AS 
WE ARE NEGOTIATING, UNLESS 
PARTY WOULD STOP THE 
NEGOTIATIONS, WE HOLD OFF 
FURTHER TARIFFS, AND WE ASSESS 
THE EXISTING TARIFFS ON STEEL 
AND ALUMINUM. 
THIS IS A GOOD, CONSTRUCTIVE 
MEETING. 
THANK YOU, DONALD TRUMP. 
>> THANK YOU, AND -- [ APPLAUSE 
] -- I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE BY 
SAYING, THIS WAS A VERY BIG DAY 
FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE. 
A VERY BIG DAY, INDEED. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> 
>> WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND THAT THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION PRESIDENT, JEAN-
CLAUDE, DISCUSSING THE TRADE 
MEETING THAT THEY JUST HAD. 
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE -- 
THEY HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW PHASE 
IN RELATIONS BUT HE SAID THAT 
THEY HAVE AGREED TO WORK TOWARDS
ZERO TARIFFS AND AND ZERO 
SUBSIDIES. 
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID THAT 
THE EU WILL START ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY TO BUY A LOT OF 
U.S. SOYBEANS. 
HE ALSO SAYS THAT THE EU WILL 
IMPORT MORE U.S. LIQUEFIED 
NATURAL GAS. 
DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT HE AND 
YUNKER HAVE DECIDED TO SET UP A 
WORKING GROUP TO CARRY OUT A 
JOINT TRADE AGENDA. 
THEY BOTH SEEMED TO SAY THAT IT 
WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING.
