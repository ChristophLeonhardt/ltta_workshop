adhering to the ceasefire they're not adhering to the ceasefire because they continued to sponsor and back Bashar al-assad's government violence in the rebel and terrorists held to Moscow suburb escalated earlier this month with both sides accusing each other of targeting civilians the humanik Security Council unanimously adopted a month-long ceasefire resolution across the country additionally Russia has also sponsored a five hour daily truce to help civilians escape the violence in eastern Goethe however terrorists shelled the humanitarian corridor that was set up for this that's according to Russia's Defense Ministry which had helped establish the route before it was attacked just minutes later not a single civilian was able to leave the end clav on Tuesday with the Russia sponsored truce now into its second day Russia's top diplomat has stressed that militants are still disrupting the humanitarian operation dealer Schmidt wk me export Salima the militants entrenched in Goethe continue to shell Damascus preventing a deliveries and the evacuation of people who want to leave we call on the members of the so-called American Coalition to ensure the same humanitarian access to areas in Syria under their control including the rook ban refugee camp and the entire territory surrounding our town our comparisons are now being drawn between the ongoing liberation of Eastern Goethe and the former militant and clav of Aleppo in 2016 artis Igarashi Danoff takes a closer look the tangle of violence in east guta is morphing into aleppo 2.0 watching the mainstream media's coverage is almost like traveling in a time machine back to 2016 President Assad and his Russian Ally are accused of unleashing all-out war against the people of Goethe Russia and the Syrian government are launching an offensive SADS Army has fired hundreds of missiles and mortars on civilian home and hospitals hospitals are targets in Syria and the regime has been bombing them ruthlessly among all things east gouta is one of the last jihadi bastions just like Aleppo it's been a long time den of the nusra front and the likes here's the terrorists flag hanging off the wall during a meeting in East guta a few years ago and since then nutria and its allies have only been getting cozier their militias in East guta have a record of forcing civilians to sit tight amid the fighting and the worse it is for them the better the evidence indicates that non-state armed groups in eastern goota and in particular Jaysh al-islam are also responsible for inflating the price of food and other basic necessities they're arbitrarily restricting the movement of civilians wishing to leave and abducting and arbitrarily detaining people human shields is a tactic favored by all terrorists including those who were in Aleppo hardly surprised that minutes after Russia and Syria opened humanitarian corridors out of East guta those paths to safety came under rebel shelling humanitarian corridors for the passage of civilians are still blocked by terrorists and being shelled militants continue to use mortars and rocket systems against residential neighborhoods including areas with humanitarian corridors in the western part of Aleppo and just like an East Aleppo there are no Western reporters in rebel-held Goutham after all with those groups you never know what you're going to get a story or a price on your head instead reporters shoes are filled by young prodigies this what happens to the Shannara we can't recede of damascus under swisha in a stream buta for survey is a go by the tourists Assad regime the white helmets a group marketing itself as a civil defense initiative their volunteers work at bomb sites as diligently in scenes as they have at the scenes of jihadist executions wherever jihadi factions fest them they bring the white helmets in tow East gouta like aleppo is no exception whether it's Goethe Aleppo or any other hotbed of violence it's almost never just black or white but sticking a good versus bad label is so much easier especially when you have some stored away from the last time he goes down of RT the British Foreign Office invited the Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Ayako venko to discuss the humanitarian situation in eastern Goethe he told us that finding a solution to the crisis is a joint responsibility valid Nations is waiting to send the humanitarian aid to Eastern Goethe but how to get it there because for example the roots are full of Mines you cannot go there the terrorists are holding there's a life shield the the people they are not letting them out so we discussed with the British you know what the British could do in the practical terms and what kind of signals they could send to the whether it's in neutral position whatever to the armed people in order to save lives we need the British on board but we don't accept the statements like that the Russians are guilty for the humanitarian situation we're in the same boat were trying to do our best in order to release Syria from the terrorists
