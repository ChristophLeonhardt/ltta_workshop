WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. Reporter: LET ME FOLLOW UP ON JIM'S QUESTION. MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME FOLLOW UP ON JIM'S QUESTION THAT I DON'T THINK WE GOT AN ANSWER TO President Trump: WHICH QUESTION? Reporter: HOW OF YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS, BEING ACCUSED President Trump: I'VE BEEN ACCUSED. FALSE ACCUSATIONS. EXCUSE ME. I'VE BEEN ACCUSED, AND I WAS ACCUSED BY I BELIEVE IT WAS FOUR WOMEN. YOU CAN CHECK WITH SEAN HANNITY. YOU CAN CHECK WITH FOX BECAUSE THEY COVERED IT VERY STRONGLY. WHO GOT PAID? EXCUSE ME. WHO GOT PAID? I WAS ACCUSED BY FOUR OR FIVE WOMEN WHO GOT PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT ME. WE CAUGHT THEM, AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA REFUSED TO PUT IT ON TELEVISION. THEY REFUSED TO EVEN WRITE ABOUT IT. THERE WERE FOUR WOMEN, AND MAYBE MORE. I THINK THE NUMBER IS FOUR OR FIVE. ONE HAD A MORTGAGE PAID OFF HER HOUSE, $52,000. ANOTHER ONE HAD OTHER THINGS HAPPEN. THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT I BELIEVE WAS OFFERED $750,000 TO SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT ME, AND SHE IS THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT. THIS WOMAN IS INCREDIBLE. SHE REPORTED IT INSTEAD OF THE MONEY. SO I'VE HAD NUMEROUS ACCUSATIONS ABOUT ME. THEY MADE FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT ME. KNOWING THEY WERE FALSE. I NEVER MET THEM. I NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE. WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY TOOK MONEY IN ORDER TO SAY BAD THINGS. I HAVE HAD STORIES WRITTEN IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES," FRONT PAGE, ABOUT FOUR WOMEN, THE WHOLE TOP CENTER FRONT PAGE OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES." FOUR BIG PICTURES. WOW, THAT'S A BIG THING. WHAT'S THAT? THESE WERE WOMEN THAT WERE QUOTED SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME, NOT THE WORST THINGS ABOUT ME BUT BAD THINGS. I SAID GEE, THAT'S TOO BAD. I KNEW THEM A LONG TIME AGO. 15 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO. I SAID THAT'S TOO BAD. I'M SURPRISED. THEN I SEE THEM ON TELEVISION, NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. THE NEXT DAY OR A DAY LATER, THEY WERE INCENSED. THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP IS A NICE GUY. WE NEVER SAID THIS. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" DEVOTES REPORTING. THEY ARE FAKE NEWS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? "THE NEW YORK TIMES" WOULD NOT REPORT THAT THIS STORY WAS FAKE. THESE WOMEN SAID GREAT THINGS. NOT ONLY DID THEY NOT SAY THE BAD STUFF. THEY SAID GREAT THINGS ABOUT ME. FRONT PAGE. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE WOMEN. THEY WENT ON TELEVISION AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO WHEN I DIDN'T ASK THEM AND THEY SAID "THE NEW YORK TIMES" MADE IT UP. THEY GAVE FALSE QUOTES. AND THEY WENT ON A LOT OF SHOWS. THEY WERE REALLY INCENSED AND THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THAT'S WHY, PEOPLE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE NEWS IS FAKE AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE ARE FAKE. BUT 20% OF THEM ARE WONDERFUL, OKAY? Reporter: IF I COULD ACTUALLY ASK MY QUESTION. YOU DIDN'T LET ME ASK MY QUESTION. President Trump: YOU'VE BEEN ASKING A QUESTION FOR 10 MINUTES. PLEASE SIT DOWN. Reporter: HOW DOES IT IMPACT YOUR OPINION ON THE ALLEGATIONS? President Trump: I'VE HAD A LOT OF FULL CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME. I'M A VERY FAMOUS PERSON UNFORTUNATELY. I'VE BEEN A FAMOUS PERSON FOR A LONG TIME BUT I'VE HAD A LOT OF FALSE CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME, REALLY FALSE. I KNOW FRIENDS THAT HAVE HAD FULL CHARGES. PEOPLE WANT FAME. THEY WANT MONEY. THEY WANT WHATEVER. SO WHEN I SEE IT, I VIEW IT DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEBODY SITTING HOME WATCHING TELEVISION WHERE THEY SAY OH, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THIS OR THAT. IT'S HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES. I'VE HAD MANY FALSE CHARGES. I HAD A WOMAN SITTING IN AN AIRPLANE AND I ATTACKED HER WHILE PEOPLE WERE COMING ON THE PLANE AND I HAVE A NUMBER ONE BEST SELLER OUT. I MEAN, IT WAS A TOTAL PHONY STORY. THERE ARE MANY OF THEM. SO WHEN YOU SAY DOES IT AFFECT ME IN TERMS OF MY THINKING, WITH RESPECT TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT MANY TIMES. AND IF THE NEWS WOULD HAVE REPORTED THESE FOUR PEOPLE, I
