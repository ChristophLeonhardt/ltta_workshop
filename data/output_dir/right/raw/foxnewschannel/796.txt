1
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,725
>> HE RAN THE CLINTON

2
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:15,359
INVESTIGATION, HE RUNS THE

3
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,360
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION AND HE

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,762
HATES THE PRESIDENT BUT, THE

5
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:19,130
REPORT SAYS THAT WHILE HIS BIAS

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,266
CAST A CLOUD IT DID NOT IMPACT

7
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:23,434
THE FINAL DECISION, IS THAT

8
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:23,768
CORRECT?

9
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:25,069
>> BIASES ALL THE WAY THROUGH

10
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:26,971
THIS AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU WERE

11
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,406
NOT ABLE TO SEE THAT.

12
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:29,974
>> IN THIS COUNTRY WE CANNOT

13
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:31,109
LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE UNELECTED

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,677
PEOPLE AT THE FBI GET TO SHELTER

15
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:34,679
SOMEONE WHO I BELIEVE WAS

16
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,181
ACTIVELY WORKING AGAINST THE

17
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:37,548
PRESIDENT.

18
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:40,618
>> WHAT IS MORE TEXTBOOK BIAS

19
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:42,353
THEN PREJUDGING THIS

20
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:44,021
INVESTIGATION BEFORE IT'S OVER

21
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:46,457
AND THIS ONE BEFORE IT BEGINS?

22
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:48,159
>> Sandra: A MORE FALLOUT

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,362
TONIGHT FROM TWO DAYS HEARING ON

24
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:53,364
THE HILL.

25
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:53,965
LAWMAKERS GRILLED

26
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:56,234
INSPECTOR GENERAL

27
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:57,201
MICHAEL HOROWITZ ON WHY FBI

28
00:00:57,201 --> 00:01:01,205
AGENT PETER STRZOK'S ANTI-TRUMP

29
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:03,975
BIAS WAS NOT FOUND TO BE AN

30
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:05,576
INFLUENCE?

31
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:07,545
AND TONIGHT, STRZOK IS

32
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:07,945
RESPONDING.

33
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:09,347
A SHORT TIME AGO HIS LAWYER

34
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:11,349
RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING IN

35
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,985
PART, QUOTE ALL OF THIS

36
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:15,086
SERIOUSLY CALLS INTO QUESTION

37
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:17,221
THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE

38
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,757
DISCIPLINARY PROCESS WHICH NOW

39
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:21,559
APPEARS TAINTED BY POLITICAL

40
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:22,393
INFLUENCE.

41
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:25,229
INSTEAD OF PUBLICLY CALLING FOR

42
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,165
A LONG STATION, POLITICIANS

43
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:28,566
SHOULD ALLOW THE DISCIPLINARY

44
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:31,636
PROCESS TO PLAY OUT FREE FROM

45
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:33,571
POLITICAL PRESSURE.

46
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,673
HERE ARE NOW EXCLUSIVELY,

47
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:36,374
CONGRESSMAN BOB GOODLATTE AND

48
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:39,710
TREY GOWDY WHO CHAIRED THE TWO

49
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,111
COMMISSIONS.

50
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:41,312
THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU AND FOR

51
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:44,348
YOUR TIME TONIGHT.

52
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:45,216
CONGRESSMAN GAUDI, I WILL START

53
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,351
WITH YOU FIRST.

54
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:50,354
I KNOW THAT WAS A FIRST-TIER

55
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:52,356
HEARING OF PETER STRZOK'S

56
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:53,357
ATTORNEY AND THAT LETTER

57
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:53,858
RESPONDING TODAY.

58
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:56,427
>> I HOPE HE IS SAYS THAT WHEN

59
00:01:56,427 --> 00:01:58,162
HE COMES FROM CONGRESS.

60
00:01:58,162 --> 00:01:59,997
THIS IS THE SAME VICTIM THAT

61
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:05,369
SAID AS FELLOW CITIZENS, YOU

62
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,771
COULD SMELL THEM.

63
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:09,006
AND THIS IS THE SAME GUY WHO

64
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,407
SLEPT WALKED THROUGH THE

65
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:11,108
HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION

66
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,277
AND THEN WOKE UP AND GOT VERY

67
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:15,746
EXCITED AT THE PROSPECT OF

68
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:17,582
ENDING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OR ANY

69
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:19,150
OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

70
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,185
I HOPE TO GOODNESS THAT HE COMES

71
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:23,554
TO CONGRESS NEXT WEEK AND THAT'S

72
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:24,522
HIS DEFENSE.

73
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:25,957
>> Sandra: CONGRESSMAN

74
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,359
GOODLATTE, THAT'S A PRETTY

75
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:29,126
UNBELIEVABLE STATEMENT THAT SAYS

76
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:33,564
HE IS THE TARGET OF UNFOUNDED

77
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:35,766
POLITICAL ATTACKS, POLITICAL

78
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,301
GAINS AND INAPPROPRIATE LEAKS.

79
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,803
>> THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

80
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:41,138
QUESTION THAT ALL ACROSS OUR TWO

81
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:41,839
COMMITTEES, MEMBERS ON BOTH

82
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:44,342
SIDES OF THE AISLE ACKNOWLEDGED

83
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:47,345
HOW APPALLED THEY WERE BY THE

84
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:48,946
STATEMENTS THAT HE MADE.

85
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:50,648
AND MANY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MAKING

86
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,883
THOSE STATEMENTS USING

87
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:54,919
GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND

88
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,721
GOVERNMENT EQUIPMENT IS HIGHLY

89
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:57,221
INAPPROPRIATE.

90
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,357
IT CLEARLY REFLECTED UPON THE

91
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:00,057
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE TWO

92
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:02,760
INVESTIGATIONS WERE HIS BIAS

93
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,962
SHOWS THROUGH CLEAR AND CLEAR.

94
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:07,965
IN ANY EVENT, I AGREE WITH TREY.

95
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:10,201
HE HAS NOW INDICATED THAT HE

96
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:11,769
WOULD COME VOLUNTARILY, BUT HE

97
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:14,372
HAS NOT PINNED HIMSELF DOWN ON

98
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:15,106
WIND.

99
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:18,643
SO WE ARE EMINENTLY GOING TO

100
00:03:18,643 --> 00:03:22,146
ISSUE A SUBPOENA FOR HIM TO

101
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,147
APPEAR NEXT WEEK.

102
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:24,949
SPEED LIMITS OF THE SUBPOENA HAS

103
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,086
BEEN PREPARED BUT HAS NOT BEEN

104
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:29,487
ISSUED YET?

105
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:30,187
>> IT'S ON THE WAY.

106
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:33,758
>> SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE

107
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:34,992
PETER STRZOK TESTIFY PUBLICLY

108
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:35,393
NEXT WEEK?

109
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:36,927
>> WE ARE STILL OPEN TO WORKING

110
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,963
WITH HIM BUT HE HAS TO

111
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:43,167
UNDERSTAND HE HAS TO DO IT ON

112
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:43,768
HIS TIMETABLE.

113
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:45,369
HIS LAWYER BETTER CONTACT US

114
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:48,105
RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THE SUBPOENA

115
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:48,472
IS COMING.

116
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:49,874
>> Sandra: I THINK YOU WILL

117
00:03:49,874 --> 00:03:51,609
HEAR THAT MESSAGE LOUD AND

118
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:51,909
CLEAR.

119
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:54,045
YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE

120
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:56,380
TIMELINE OF THIS TEXT MESSAGES

121
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,452
TODAY.

122
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:09,960
AND, WHETHER THAT IMPACTED THE

123
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,729
LAUNCH OF THE RUSSIAN

124
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,264
INVESTIGATION, THAT IS THE

125
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:14,865
QUESTION.

126
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:15,199
DID IT?

127
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,966
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE

128
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,369
CHRONOLOGY, OF COURSE IN LATE

129
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:19,904
JULY OF 2016 IS WHEN THE RUSSIA

130
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:24,775
PROBE BEGAN.

131
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:27,345
WE WERE NOT EVEN TWO WEEKS INTO

132
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:27,945
IT.

133
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:29,580
WE ARE NOT TWO WEEKS INTO IT

134
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,549
BEFORE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ANY

135
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:33,417
CONCERNS POLICY THAT MAKE SURE

136
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,786
THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NEVER THE

137
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:36,620
PRESIDENT.

138
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,557
SO KEEP IN MIND, HE IS TWO WEEKS

139
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:41,759
INTO AN INVESTIGATION AND HE'S

140
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,160
ALREADY TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHING

141
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,196
THE TARGET OF HIS INVESTIGATION.

142
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:46,964
THEY HADN'T DONE ANYTHING AT

143
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:47,765
THAT POINT.

144
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:50,768
IN TWO WEEKS, THE PAPERWORK IS

145
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:51,969
NOT EVEN PROCESSED.

146
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:53,771
YET HE IS ALREADY REACHED ITS

147
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,207
CONCLUSION ABOUT WHAT THE

148
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:56,907
OUTCOME OF THAT INVESTIGATION

149
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:57,375
IS.

150
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,144
FAST FORWARD TO WHAT HE PUT ON

151
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:02,747
THE MUELLER PROBE, HE'S TALKING

152
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:07,718
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND I

153
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:09,754
HAVE NEVER IN 20 YEARS BEING A

154
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:11,889
PROSECUTOR SEEN AND

155
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,557
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT BUT THIS

156
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:14,792
AMOUNT OF ANIMUS AND BIAS

157
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,560
TOWARDS THE TARGET, AND I HOPE

158
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,463
AND PRAY THAT HE COMES NEXT WEEK

159
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,565
AND PORTRAYS HIMSELF AS A

160
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:21,999
VICTIM.

161
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,401
>> Sandra: I THINK A LOT OF

162
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:24,368
PEOPLE AT THIS POINT BASED ON

163
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:25,536
THAT SET UP ARE GOING TO WANT TO

164
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:33,978
SEE THAT AS WELL.

165
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:37,782
AND PETER STRZOK AND HIS ROLE IN

166
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:39,250
THIS LAUNCH OF THE RUSSIA PROBE,

167
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,953
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

168
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:44,855
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

169
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:45,990
THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS

170
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,392
NOT TASKED WITH LOOKING AT.

171
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:50,895
BUT HE ALSO -- LET'S JUST NOTE,

172
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:55,866
THAT SAINT PETER             SAY

173
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:55,900
THAT SAINT PETER             SAP

174
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:55,933
THAT SAINT PETER             SAT

175
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:55,966
THAT SAINT PETER             SAR

176
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:56,000
THAT SAINT PETER             SAS

177
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:56,066
THAT SAINT PETER             SAO

178
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:56,100
THAT SAINT PETER             SAK

179
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,133
THAT SAINT PETER             SAW

180
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:56,167
THAT SAINT PETER             SAS

181
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:56,200
THAT SAINT PETER             SA'

182
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,468
THAT SAINT PETER             SAT

183
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:58,803
INVOLVED IN THE HILLARY CLINTON

184
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:00,404
EMAIL INVESTIGATION, AND AT THE

185
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:02,406
SAME TIME HE WAS MAKING THE

186
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:03,974
STATEMENTS THAT TREY JUST

187
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:04,375
REFERRED TO.

188
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,478
HE WAS ALSO HELPING A PROCESS

189
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:12,149
THAT BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO NOT

190
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:13,784
FOLLOW PROPER INVESTIGATIVE

191
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:15,986
PROCEDURES WITH REGARD TO FORMER

192
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:17,988
SECRETARY OF STATE AND CANDIDATE

193
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:18,789
HILLARY CLINTON.

194
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,658
THAT IS A SHOCKING CONTRAST OF

195
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:24,995
THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO

196
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:25,996
OCCURRED IN THE FEDERAL BUREAU

197
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,164
OF INVESTIGATION.

198
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,332
SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE

199
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:31,902
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 2,020

200
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:32,636
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OR ANY

201
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:34,405
OTHER FUTURE INVESTIGATION IS

202
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:36,373
NOT TAINTED BY THIS KIND OF BIAS

203
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:37,741
AND NOT TAINTED BY THE

204
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:39,276
INAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES.

205
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:40,578
>> Sandra: ARE YOU HAPPY WITH

206
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:43,647
THE WAY THINGS WENT TODAY,

207
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:44,014
CHAIRMAN?

208
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,016
>> I THINK IT WAS A VERY GOOD

209
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,585
HEARING AND MANY PEOPLE BOTH

210
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,185
SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE

211
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:50,554
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE DECISION

212
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:52,890
THAT WAS MADE BY PRESIDENT TRUMP

213
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,158
THAT WAS MADE BY PRESIDENT TRUM

214
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:55,559
PRESIDENT TRUMP, NONE OF THEM

215
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,494
USE HIS NAME IS RECOMMENDED TO

216
00:06:56,494 --> 00:07:01,365
BUY DEPUTY ATTORNEY WAS THE

217
00:07:01,365 --> 00:00:00,000
CORRECT DECISION.
