5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,859
especially not our children the most
important and joyous role I ever had is

6
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,860
to be a mother to my young son
and what could possibly be more

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:46,260
essential focus in everyone's life then
that of loving educating and bringing up

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,449
our next generation to be happy
productive and morally responsible

9
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:59,190
adults together we must acknowledge that
all too often is the weakest most

10
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,850
innocent and vulnerable among us our
children who ultimately suffer the most

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:13,850
from the challenges that plug our
societies whether it is drug addiction

12
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:22,770
bullying poverty disease trafficking
illiteracy or hunger it is the children

13
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:31,140
for hit first and hardest in any country
and as we all know the future of every

14
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,340
nation rests with the promise of their
young people if we look at the present

15
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,960
state of children in any society we will
see the future that our world can expect

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,360
tomorrow
show me your civic lessons of today and

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,759
I will show you your civic leaders of
tomorrow

18
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,259

families today and I will show you the
patriotism and moral clarity

21
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:20,880
of your nation tomorrow our choices on
how we raise and educate our children

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,850
will in fact provide the blueprint for
the next generation if we do not

23
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:34,750
advocate a love of country to our
children and the generations to come

24
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,290
then why would our children grow up to
fight for their country's founding

25
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:48,460
principles and moral truths if we do not
teach our children the importance of

26
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,820
helping those less fortunate wherever
they may be then why would they become

27
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:02,410
caring adults who dedicate themselves to
charity if we do not ensure that our

28
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,280
youth redefine their nation of community
to reach beyond their own backyards

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,040
their own schools and their own town
halls then not then why would we accept

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,700
to see a new generation of leaders with
a moral conscience that includes all of

31
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,300
humanity when we join together as
parents caring for children whether

32
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,760
whatever they live in our own families
across the street across the nation or

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,700
across the globe we claim our
responsibility to the next generation to

34
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,980
ensure they are prepared to accept the
torch of leadership for the world of

35
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:53,110
tomorrow and make no mistake this will
always begin with us coming together to

36
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:59,230
embrace parents hoods noble calling
nothing could be more urgent nor worthy

37
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,600
a cause than preparing future
generations for the adulthood with true

38
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:12,220
moral clarity and responsibility to
achieve this we must come together for

39
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:19,079
the good of our children because through
them our future will be defined

40
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,020
therefore we must teach each child the
values of empathy and communication

41
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,699
there are other
core of the kindness mindfulness

42
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:37,870
integrity and leadership which can only
be thought by example by our own example

43
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,289
we must teach children to be good
stewards of the world they will inherit

44
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:49,630
we must remember that they are watching
and listening so we must never miss an

45
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:57,250
opportunity to teach lives many ethical
lessons along the way as adults we are

46
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,449
not merely responsible we are
accountable I hope you will join me in

47
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:10,509
committing ourselves to teaching the
next generation to live by and honor the

48
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:17,199
golden rule to unto others as you would
have them until you which is my

49
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:24,340

52
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,650
to on a daily basis through social media
the bullying the experience online and

53
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,020
in person and the growing global
epidemic of drug addiction and drug

54
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:57,419
