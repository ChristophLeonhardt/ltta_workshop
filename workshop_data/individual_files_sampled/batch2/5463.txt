welcome back tonight I'm obsessed with something that obsessed our staff this afternoon it's about the generation gap not the one between kids and their parents in the 60s the generational divide over what constitutes a generation specifically millenials who the heck are they what exactly is at Millennium do you know some millennial posers who are really aging Gen Xers or some post millennial millennial wannabes well the Pew Research Center strapped on their green eyeshades and declared today that henceforth millenials will be defined as people born between 1981 and 1996 so what does that mean the historical touchstones for Millennials then are this the 9/11 attacks the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the election of America's first african-american president baby boomers born between 46 and 64 they of course have the Kennedy assassination as a searing memory as well as the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement Gen Xers born between 65 and 80 according to Pew have a little bit of Watergate with boomers but also have the Reagan Revolution the Reagan assassination attempt and then the Challenger explosion is touchstones a sort far as I'm concerned though Hugh has it all wrong it's a pretty simple thing you're a millennial if you were not old enough to vote in the 96 election if you were you're a gen Xer if you weren't you're a millennial and guess what if you have no memory of 9/11 you don't get to say you're a millennial your gen Z but then again you may not be watching linear television that's my definition and I'm sticking to it I'll be right back hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
