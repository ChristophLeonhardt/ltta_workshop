Bolivian ambassador to the United Nations indeed the man who called today's security council meeting let's talk to him he said made the time to be with us alright thank you for your time tell us more about your concerns which which led you to call that that meeting well thank you very much our main concern is that due due to the threats that the United States is imposing on this situation and the threat to use force a unilateral action that goes against the United Nations Charter and also we are concerned about the possibility of escalation and thus that this could go out of control and we might end up with a wider conflict that than the one that's already been suffered in Syria and that's the serious concern you think it is possible yeah well I mean we believe that the United Nations Charter and its principles should guide the resolution of any any any conflict or problem the problem that we are facing is that the United States is willing to go against the Charter and we believe that the UN system as a whole not just the Security Council but the UN system should do its best in upholding the principles of the UN Charter that's why we convened a meeting that we had today and we just been informed that tomorrow we'll have another open meeting regarding the threats that the United States has sent against not just Syria in this case but against the whole UN system your colleague the usm voids the to the UN nikki Haley just a few days ago said that the Security Council has proved itself to be useless what's your assessment of the comments on it well I think that the Security Council has a lot of problems I think it has a lot of all so challenges we can talk about the need of reform of the Security Council we can talk about the privilege that the permanent members of the Security Council have that we think that we will leave that that should be changed but at this particular moment I think that the main challenge of the Security Council has is to unite and to create an independent mechanism in order to investigate the alleged chemical attacks but even if that doesn't work that doesn't allow the United States to take actions by its own so whatever happens if the United States takes a unilateral action it will be a violation of international law and the UN system should not of course accept that and as I said it will not be an attack against Syria but also an attack against the whole United Nations system and as it stands now your thoughts about the US defense secretary saying that America is the right to carry out preemptive strikes against the SADS forces to defend its own troops that's just a pretext to go in is it it is a pretext it is a prediction it right now we have what we have the information we have from from the United Nations such that there is no conclusive investigation on the chemical attack first of all second that the the only body the only organ in the in this in the international system that could approve the use of force is the Security Council before they do anything they need to have an approval and authorization by the Security Council otherwise it is also it is of course a violation of international law the problem is that the United States believes and acts as it would be as it is above any any law they believe that they have their own rules and it is not the case and Bolivia's member of Security Council has a responsibility to represent the whole the whole membership of the council 193 countries those 15 members in the council represent the wider membership and the first responsibility that we have is to upheld the purposes and the principles of the United Nations Charter and any unilateral action goes against those purposes and principles Sasha Lorenz I believe is ambassador to the United Nations thank you
