“It’s a nasty habit.
I hope to give it up one day.
But, under the situation
that I’m dealing with …
For the landlord to
get me out of
this apartment,
they would give me the money,
and I would give them the
key — that simple.
So I figured the agreement
we had was imminent
and I moved all my
stuff out of here.
But, they kind of, like,
reneged on the deal.
I can’t believe
I’m still here.
They keep on selling me a
dream that’s not happening.”
Ray Tirado lives in the heart
of New York City’s largest
Puerto Rican neighborhood,
East Harlem.
“Excuse the
conditions right now.”
It’s one of the last
affordable neighborhoods
in one of the most expensive
cities in the country.
And it’s changing
right before his eyes.
In 2015, new owners
announced a plan
to tear down Ray’s 70-year-old
walk-up and replace it
with a bigger building
with a much higher rent.
Ray, a 58-year-old
construction worker,
has been living here
for five decades.
It’s the only home
he’s ever known.
And now he’s the last tenant
left in the entire building.
The last holdout.
“I did my living room
floors, wooden.
I’ve done everything here
expecting to retire here.”
His apartment is
rent-controlled,
which means he’s only
paying $110 a month.
“This is what’s actually causing
the fly infestation.”
Ray says the
building’s owners have
tried to force him out by
letting his home fall apart.
“O.K., I don’t want to go any further
than that, because
that’s going to take, like, a 
week to go down.”
But Ray’s not leaving.
“This used to be a 
great view.”
He’s one man fighting a
real estate boom sweeping
across Manhattan
and New York City.
The landlords didn’t
wait for him to leave.
They’ve already started
demolition around him.
“There’s lots of
methods that owners
are using to try to
get people like Ray
to no longer want to
stay in his apartment.
There’s buyouts and push-outs,
there’s harassment by construction.”
Harvey Epstein
represents tenants
who, like Ray, are fighting
to stay in their homes.
“What we see more
often than not
is owners who
continue to engage
in this type of
behavior and get away
with it because there’s really
little punishment for them.”
“He is living in a building
that’s 100 years old,
all right? And,
in order to correct it
we’d probably
have to renovate
the whole building.”
Yi Han co-owns the
property and said she’s
been very fair with Ray.
Her company offered
him $800,000
to move out — an unusually high
amount for the neighborhood.
“So the profit margin
is not that big.
But we’d really like
to build something
that will fit the demand
of the neighborhood.”
But even with that
much money, Ray feels
conflicted about leaving.
He can continue
fighting to hold on
to a crumbling apartment,
or he can take a check
and say goodbye to
his family home.
“That just didn’t affect just
the residential neighborhood.
It affects the entire
character of a community.
I mean, a buyout is how
a neighborhood changes.”
East Harlem is a
2.4-square-mile
district in Upper
Manhattan and home
to New York’s largest
Puerto Rican population.
“This is like the hall
of fame of graffiti.
Your neighborhood guys
that are graffiti artists
and they come and push
their tags over here.”
There’s always been a
sense of community, family
and familiarity. 
But Ray says
that’s all changing,
fast.
“This here in the corner
was at one time
a grocery store where
I used to buy 
my sandwiches.
And then it turned
into a pizzeria
place where I
could buy my pizza.
Now it’s a hipster
spot where it’s
so expensive that you couldn’t …
even happy hour is not
a happy hour.
One of the things
that we’re trying
to protect in this
neighborhood now
is some of the small-business
owners that are being pushed
out because of the rent.
Even some of the supermarkets
are being pushed out.”
“This is a big day 
today.
I want to have my normal
life back.”
In September 2016,
Ray’s one-year battle against
his landlord came to a head.
He went to court
in a last attempt
to hold on to his home.
“I’ve been living in my
apartment for over 50 years.
The only solvent thing that
I know is my home.
And I know what I have there.”
He just wanted his landlord
to fix the apartment.
But the judge was
unsympathetic to Ray’s
arguments and pressured
him to take a buyout:
$800,000 to walk away.
“I can’t believe this.
He told me,
‘That’s more than fair.’
This is not the way I 
wanted to end this fight.
Definitely not the way I 
wanted to end this fight.”
After more than a
year of resisting,
Ray surrendered.
“I’m thinking about
leaving the furniture behind.
Take the nightstands and 
probably take
the love seat or something
like that, I don’t know.
Take something here.
We’ll feel that
out and see how that goes.”
“All these buildings here,
I know.
I grew up, I used to play in
the backyards in these places.
In the summertime we used
to have people with bongos
playing, singing some songs.
It was a pretty
good childhood.
I don’t know what’s
going to happen to that.
If you look further
down Third Avenue,
there’s a bunch of
buildings there.
They’re all boarded up.
I mean, there’s housing that’s
being needed out here.
But the greed is
saying keep it
shut until the
gentrification is here.
And we’ll make
this all high-rise.
It takes the flavor away
from this neighborhood.”
But while Ray’s neighborhood
transforms around him,
he’s been stuck in limbo.
In the 18 months after
he packed up his life,
the debt-ridden landlord
never came through.
They’ve only paid Ray $50,000
of the $800,000 agreement,
and he’ll probably never
see the rest of the money.
Now the bank has moved to
foreclose on the building,
one of the worst
maintained in the city.
“I just wish there
was more laws
to protect the
tenants out here,
I don’t know how long
this is going to go on.
I don’t know how long
I can hang and hold on.
But my inner being
and my stubbornness can’t
allow me to move out of here.
