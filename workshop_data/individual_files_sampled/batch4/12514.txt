let's just play the video just out of curiosity why do the boys what what's the point of it why do you find joy in taken innocent people find it away men do y'all okay what did I say to you know what they don't tell you at lunch Bill Cosby pick up my clothes nothing is it just you yep where's that other kids too that feel that way so they're good shoe how does that make you feel okay people that are different don't need to be criticized about it it's not their fault but if you are made side up giusto so what it bother you stay stuck like this hard but you'll probably get better wouldn't they they're just harp I really is chokes you up so many people have turned up to help him you know Sean Hannity offering thousands of dollars Donald Trump jr. offering to take him into his home he'll be fine I'm sure that with people turning up but of course you know I've worked on many help lines on I've worked on suicide lines and I know this goes on all the time and we all know it we've all been in high school high school is a jungle it's elementary schools are jungle kids or animals you know they haven't learned things yet and it's this kind of rough justice out there and when I was when I was a kid I got in a lot of fistfights and once or twice in my life I actually bullied people laid hands on people when I shouldn't have and I live with it to this day I'm ashamed of it to this day but in my defense most of the time not only was I not fighting because I was being bullied I was fighting because somebody else was being bullied that and several times and I didn't win these fights you don't get a nose like this by always winning fights I've my share but I also lost my shirt but I did step in when kids were being tormented and I have to say that no matter what the administration does no matter what parents do justice and the the events are gonna take place in the field and there's some some justice that has to be done on the field and people always say to the kids like this they say well stand up for yourself punch back and that's good advice but sometimes you know the guy who's gonna go on and become a tech giant may not be as big as the guys as a football player here's what I want to say see that was a big guy that was a big guy if you're a big guy if you're a kid and you're a big guy and maybe you're a popular guy maybe you're the football star if if you believe this kid your clique is gonna like you they're gonna slap you on the back if you stand up for this kid you will have your choice of any girl in the school let me tell you this you will be a hero and when you get to be an older person you suck to have a moral sense you won't look back a shame you will look back and be proud of yourself I am proud of the times even when I got my head handed to me I'm proud of the times I stood up because some kid had been thrown in a garbage can or somebody was being teased because he was maybe a little effeminate or whatever I those are things that this with me to this day and that I hold to my heart and if you do that there'll be a lot less of this if the kids who are strong if the kids who were popular stand-up kids like this won't have as big a problem as they obviously do
