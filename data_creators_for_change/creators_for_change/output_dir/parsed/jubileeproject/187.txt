stubborn critical but most of all
misunderstood I never realized how his
words that I once thought were critical
were actually words of love and concern
because he didn't want me to struggle in

opportunities and I've been lucky enough
to follow my dreams but I only wish I
took the time to tell my father just how
much I appreciated I mean
