young people looking out in the world with a sense of idealism and they are saying we can do much better millenials defined as those aged 22 237 in 2018 but perhaps better known by their informal description as those pesky kids ruining everything like the diamond industry the napkin industry and the housing market because how dare we pursue what we want while drowning in student loan debt and living life one bagged wine at a time but did you know my name's are set to overtake baby boomers as America's largest living generation next year and there's one other thing we should be taking over sooner rather than later Congress I mean let's be real Congress is the one thing already so broken that even as messed up Millennials couldn't make worse because while the median u.s. age was 37 point 9 in 2016 the average age of a US House representative last year was 58 and the average age in the Senate 62 keeping in mind there are age restrictions I mean you can go ahead and buy an ar-15 at 18 but God forbid you serve in the house you have to be 25 or 30 in the Senate regardless 63% of the 111th Congress is made up of baby boomers you know the people who ask questions like what is the Facebook I have to admit it oh this is just boring as beings you know and think it's cool to promote boozy corns to toddlers well this is one for the girls it's a lovely little unicorn Generation X makes up 23% the Silent Generation 11 percent while Millennials comprise a measly 2% Hoople said but the tide is changing according to money ish around 200 Millennials are or already have run for Congress during the current cycle and the boomers on both sides are scaled and nobody has Zimmer frame quite like Alexandria or Casio Cortez resulted in bipartisan attacks from both sides of the swamp but while that is expected from the majority rich white males that run our government I have a question for the American public who after being asked the question of should we have more Millennials in office voiced their disdain shouldn't our public bodies represent America if the answer is yes then you've already admitted to us needing more Millennials in office after all who better to make decisions in this country than those facing some of the most prominent adversities like I don't know debt for instance oh but who understands that more than rich Republicans running the country right no no I mean bet like those faced by three out of four Millennials who reported of being in some form of debt with a quarter of them more than $30,000 in the hole 46 percent said they were in credit card debt while 36 percent said they had student loan debt shouldn't we have public bodies to understand these issues and work collectively to overcome also Millennials are more socially active than any other generation doubling the rate of volunteering in the country over the past ten years a study carried out by Vice last year showed that of the 3,000 Millennials they sampled they performed over 13,000 actions related to causes and social issues they cared about that's an average of over a thousand actions a month this is never more represented than through Acacio Cortez's campaign she out worked her establishment opponent during our campaign going door-to-door listening to the residents in her community building an immense team of young people around her own without corporate backing and after her win she has continued her efforts in helping others in their campaigns not to mention that the shift of including more young people in office runs hand-in-hand with more women in office when asked about issues they care about in regards to the current US political system representation was outlined as a priority among young people an area that is still largely overlooked in Congress considering women only make up 1/5 of the 535 congressional seats - understand more than anything the need for representation in office as well as I need to address the everyday issues that have impacted them all while being lambasted is lazy and entitled of course and I'll leave you with this great point that I found on Twitter when asked should there be more Millennials in Congress Millennials have fought in two wars not of our own making power through an economic collapse not of our own doing pay taxes have kids and contribute into Social Security why is this even a question
