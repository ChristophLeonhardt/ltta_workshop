brand-new US submarine project set to be delivered in 2030 one could be left dead in the water before it's even got going it is been compared to two America's most costly fighter jet the f-35 which has been widely slammed by experts for its technical failures McHale Francis Santiago reports meat the Columbia class submarines the US Navy's ambitious project to replace old nuclear submarines set to be decommissioned from 2020 712 ballistic missile submarines will carry 70% of America's nuclear arsenal and are supposed to be packed with new technologies the Columbia cloth submarine program is well-positioned to provide needed capability at an affordable price on the timeline needed to meet national strategic deterrent requirements the new class isn't expected to enter service until 2031 but already at a design stage it's causing some huge concerns the US Government Accountability Office is latest report highlights quite a few problems with the super project some of the technology is yet to be developed heavy delays are expected and the costs could skyrocket Columbia class is not funded adequately to address program risks this is more likely than not that Columbia class program will exceed the Navy's 128 billion estimate of total acquisition costs ambitious expensive and of big strategic importance ring a bell anyone Columbia submarines are already being compared to the f-35 fighter jet the US military's most costly and arguably most mischievous project the f-35 assessment reports have pointed to at least 276 deficiencies in combat performance marked as critical to correct from unacceptable flight performance when breaking the sound barrier to overheating problems and cyber security vulnerabilities hundreds of issues of all kinds so why would the US pursue another ambitious project and insist it's flawless despite worrying assessments called front-loading you make a lot of big promises up front that this wonderful new technology is going to work just perfectly and then you hook in Congress to commit to funding something like this and as with the f-35 once things don't work as planned then it's not very easy to get off the hook because they've already committed the money upfront to get the project started and something that the the military-industrial complex together at the Pentagon has done for decades Congress has a long history of appropriating money for weapons systems and other military equipment that the Pentagon neither wants nor needs so ultimately this is a political issue well you see unfortunately the Columbia class submarine could mark the next big sinking of American taxpayers money I mean look the US has the largest military budget of all yet a massive chunk of it is wasted on disastrous projects which are still being carried out only because they are too big to fail miguel francis santiago RT
