you wonder about the extremism of the left here's an example of the extremism of the left so on Sunday the Chronicle of Higher Education reported on a supremely important development a male professor made a joke about lingerie in an elevator and who else was in the elevator a gender studies professor so you can predict how this thing was going to go according to Catherine Mangan his political of higher education political theory professor Richard Nedley BAU of King's College was in an elevator with a bunch of other humans including professor Simona Cerrone who teaches Women's and Gender Studies at Merrimack College says she is a professional professional useless person and sure Oni who clearly had been conditioned to submit to the patriarchy she offered to hit buttons on the elevator and that's when leave out did the unthinkable he jokingly asked for the women's lingerie department which has been like a joke since the 1950s he got an elevator with a bunch of people and then somebody says which button would you like to and they say lingerie department you know just is like a stupid joke so his buddies those jerks those patriarchal jerks they laughed how dare they so what did this lady do ok this women's studies professor complained to the International Studies Association just as an empowered woman would she wouldn't she whined to the to the male bosses of the ISA she tremblingly wrote quote I am still trying to come to terms of the fact that we froze and didn't confront him for making a joke about the women's lingerie department in an elevator ok they launched a full investigation of Li Bao why because here's what Li bout dead she wrote to him and he wrote back quote I certainly had no desire to insult women or make you feel uncomfortable and then he suggested that sure Oni who was born in Romania and raised in Israel might have misinterpreted his remark when he was young in the 1950s he said it was a standard gag line to ask the elevator operator for the hardware and lingerie floor as the one were in a department store and then you wrote like you I'm strongly opposed to the exploitation coercion or humiliation of women yes such evils continue it seems to me to make sense to direct our attention to real offences not those that are imagined or marginal by making a complaint to is a that I consider frivolous and I expect we'll be judged this way by the Ethics Committee you may be directing time and effort away from the real offences that trouble us both but this was the big problem right why is this is probably cuz he's doubling down and not only that he was mansplaining he mansplain to the gender studies professor you must never mansplain - if Gender Studies professor that she's being an idiot right too bad that you couldn't woman understand but he had to mansplain it to her and that was the big problem and Andrew Clemens lying there about woman woman understanding according to the Association this was the cruelest cut of all that leave out didn't just bow groveling Li before her and say I wish I had never made that lingerie joke I know I know it was just the same just the same as forced abortions in China but you know I really apologize now so she says it didn't feel frivolous instead the Association said that Li Bao his professor had to write an unequivocal apology Li Bao said no because he's not a ridiculous stupid moron instead he wrote an email calling the entire situation quote a horrifying and chilling example of political correctness that encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution retribution much Cerrone this email professor was steadfast she wrote quote for decades women and other marginalized groups in the academy had to put up with white men who decided what counts as violation and what is frivolous as someone who has dedicated her life to confronting sexism and other forms of discrimination and oppression in academic spaces I cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play you can hear the swelling music from behind and you get the upshot with the lights behind her and you see her in profile she looks out staring into the Sun because of the magical thing she's just done in resisting a joke about a women's lingerie department just amazing amazing courage and then people wonder why people think that gender studies professors are humorless cold you never want to spend any time in an elevator with probably because they're humorless schools that you wouldn't want to spend any time in an elevator with my goodness I know but this is the extent to which the left has gone extreme
