1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
as lots of you know I graduated recently

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,680
and now I'm part of the job hunt there's

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,879
a really fun thing when you're applying

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,649
for a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's called salary</font>

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,990
expectations and the question is do I be

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,450
realistic I expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a peanut three</font>

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,600
bits of tissue that have survived the

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,010
washing machine and also a refined on my

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,680
travel expenses or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better to be</font>

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,070
excessively aspirational<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect a 30k</font>

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,160
salary with benefits or a 20k sorry or a

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,649
15k salary when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about</font>

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">making this video I didn't know what</font>

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,430
sounded more aspirational and outlandish

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,460
30k or 20 k sad truth is people have to

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,020
get used to working for free and there

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,670
is no bigger excuse for that band<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,350
economy is bad we're in a bad situation

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,809
blah blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for free</font>

20
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,059
and for minimum wage for years and while

21
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,829
I have loved aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and i have</font>

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">loved the opportunities that it has</font>

scream<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have value value me yes money</font>

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,390
doesn't equal value but it's a sign of

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,580
it it's a symbol in our society<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,159
worth your money I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it for</font>

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,439
six years or more well-versed in social

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,210

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,130
attention to my writing my communication

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,689

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,000
myself I'm a really curious person I

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,110
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know more about the world around</font>

can be a better person and weighing my

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,450
options at this point it seems to me

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,890
that my reward for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the many years of</font>

40
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,750
hard and dedicated work that I've put in

41

either at very very low pay or at no

months<font color="#CCCCCC"> of unpaid internship I which</font>

44
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,579
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to decide whether not to</font>

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,380
trust that by the end of it I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

46
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,210
hired or I'll be offered another job in

47

a similar sector or that I'll be

48
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,390
replaced by the next intern that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

travel expenses travel expenses come and

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,810
pay my rent when people had talked to

generation is so disillusioned and so

unmotivated no wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> were disillusioned</font>

55

the illusion of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> illustrious</font>

56
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,170
has totally fallen apart and quite

57
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,789
rightly and then to top it off I mean

58
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:04,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with working</font>

our faces like that's not good enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

am so sick of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm so sick of</font>

has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a rent goodbye</font>
