>>> NOW, I'M ALL FOR GETTING
PEOPLE WITH BUSINESS EXPERIENCE
INTO GOVERNMENT.
THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE TO
POSITIONS THAT AFFECT POLICY
TOWARDS THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO
WANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN
BUSINESS-NEEDED SERVICING
GOVERNMENT, THEY'RE REPRESENTING
THE ALL AMERICAN BUSINESS.
NOT JUST THEIR OWN BUSINESS.
THAT IS A BIG PART OF THE DRAIN
THE SWAMP AGENDA.
SO WITH THE HELP OF THE
ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE, WE
TOOK A CLOSE LOOK AT OUR CURRENT
COMMERCE SECRETARY AND HIS
CURRENT BUSINESS INTERESTS.
WHAT WE FOUND WILL SHOCK YOU.

>> Reporter:  PRESIDENT TRUMP
AGGRESSIVE TRADE POLICIES ON THE
KEY PLANKS OF THE PRO WORK OF
POPULIST WORK.
RECENTLY THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE
GOOD ON HIS PROMISES BY MAKING
TARIFFS ON THE STEEL.
AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE TRUMP'S
WHO IT TURNS OUT IS NO STRANGER
TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY.
ROSS EARNED A LARGE PORTION OF
HIS WEALTH WHEN INCREDIBLY
TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN STRUGGLING
STEEL COMPANIES IN THE EARLY
2,000s.
HE MANAGED TO BUY ONE COMPANY
JUST A WEEK BEFORE GEORGE W.
BUSH IMPOSED HIS OWN TARIFFS,
DRAMATICALLY RAISING THE VALUE
OF THE COMPANY.
ROSS'S STEEL INVESTMENTS BECAME
SO VALUABLE THAT LESS THAN THREE
YEARS AFTER THE BUSH TARIFFS
ROSS SOLD THEM FOR $4.5 BILLION
SENDING A $3 MILLION PERSONAL
INVESTMENT BY ROSS INTO A
$250 MILLION PROFIT AND ALSO
EARNING HIM A SEAT ON THE BOARD
WHICH WOULD BECOME THE WORLD'S
LARGEST STEEL PRODUCER.
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, RIGHT?
JUST A SMART BUSINESSMAN WHO
MADE A LOT OF MONEY AND NOW
PUTTING HIS EXPERTISE TO WORK IN
GOVERNMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF
ALL OF US.
BUT IS IT, THOUGH?
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S STEEL TARIFFS
INCLUDEDED A NUMBER OF
EXCEPTIONS, WHICH MEANS BIG
BUSINESS FOR COMPANIES THAT
BRING STEEL FROM THOSE COUNTRIES
TO THE UNITED STATES.
NAUTICAL BOAT HOLDINGS IS ONE OF
THEM.
WHEN IT WAS STARTED IN 2013,
INVESTORS SPENT MONEY ON SHIPS
FROM CHINA.
THEY BEGAN SHIPPING PRODUCTS IN
2015 AND SINCE MAY 2016, 458 OUT
OF THAT 735 SHIPMENTS TO THE
UNITED STATES, THAT 62% HAVE
INCLUDED STEEL FROM SOUTH KOREA.
ONE OF THE COUNTRIES WITH AN
EXCEPTION FROM STEEL TARIFFS.
THE FATE OF THAT EXEMPTION IS
NOW IN THE HANDS OF WILBUR ROSS.
GUESS BRINGING STEEL HERE AND
WHO REMAINS AN OWNER.
IT'S KIND OF UNBELIEVABLE EVEN
FOR REGULAR VIEWERS OF SWAMP
BUT THE ANSWER IS, WILBUR ROSS.
HE'S NEGOTIATING OVER SOUTH
KOREAN STEEL IMPORT WHILE MAKING
MONEY FROM IMPORTING SOUTH
KOREAN STEEL.
BUT NOT ONLY IS ROSS STILL AN
OWNER OF NAUTICAL BOAT HOLDING,
HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE
COMMERCE DEPARTMENT IS LISTED AS
A DIRECTOR OF NAUTICAL BOLT
SHIPPING.
A BUSINESS ASSOCIATED, EVEN
THOUGH SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE
RESIGNED FROM THE COMPANY IN
2017.
AND NAUTICAL BAULT IS NOT THE
ONLY COMPANY HE'S INVESTED IN
WITH MASSIVE CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST.
NAVIGATOR HOLDINGS IS A GAS
SHIPPING FIRM WITH A NUMBER OF
CLIENTS INCLUDING A MAJOR OIL
COMPANY IN TURKEY WHICH HAS
RECENTLY BEEN CONSIDERED FOR
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.
ROSS BOUGHT A 19% STAKE AND
INCREASED IT TO 39% IN 2018.
HE ALSO SERVED AS A COMPANY
DIRECTOR BETWEEN 2012 AND 2014.
IN NOVEMBER 2017, EIGHT MONTHS
AFTER JOINING THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION, ROSS ANNOUNCED
THAT HE WOULD DIVEST FROM
NAVIGATOR HOLDINGS.
BUT AS OF TODAY, THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE HE'S KEPT THAT PROMISE.
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE END OF
IT.
ROSS'S PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM WL
ROSS AND COMPANY ALSO CO-FOUNDED
AND PARTIALLY OWNS ANOTHER
SHIPPING COMPANY.
THE TRANSPORTATION RECOVERY
FUND.
THAT ONE SPECIALIZES IN THE
IMPORTING OF AUTO PARTS.
DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT AFFECT
WILBUR ROSS'S HANDLING OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PROPOSED
TARIFFS ON AUTO IMPORTS?
BUT, WATED, THERE'S MORE.
ACCORDING TO SEC FILINGS IN
2014, ROSS'S FIRM OWNS 32% OF
ANOTHER COMPANY CALLED DIAMOND
SHIPPING.
ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST
OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF TANKERS.
ROSS EVEN SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF
THE COMPANY UNTIL JOINING THE
COMMERCE DEPARTMENT.
LIKE NAVIGATOR HOLDINGS, ROSS
PROMISED TO DIVEST FROM DIAMOND
SHIPPING IN NOVEMBER 2017.
BUT, AGAIN, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
HE ACTUALLY DID.
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF
DIAMOND SHIPPING, IN OTHER
WORDS, WILBUR ROSS'S CLIENTS.
IT'S QUITE THE MOTLEY CRUE.
THERE'S TWO OF THE LARGEST
ENERGY COMPANIES IN RUSSIA.
RUSSIAN-STATE OWNED INDUSTRIAL
GIANT AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PRODUCER OF NATURAL GAS.
ANOTHER CLIENT IS PETRO CHINA.
THE CHINESE STATE-OWNED OIL AND
GAS COMPANY.
THE BRUTAL COMMUNIST
DICTATORSHIP IN BEIJING MAY BE
PLANNING WORLD DOMINATION, BUT
LET'S NOT LET THAT STOP
AMERICANS DOING BUSINESS OF THEM
WHILE IN OFFICE.
TALK ABOUT GLOBALISM, WAIT, HE'S
NOT DONE.
THERE'S ANOTHER REAL CHARMER ON
THE DIAMOND SHIPPING CLIENT
LIST.
PDVSA.
WHAT IS THAT, YOU ASK?
OH, JUST A STATE-OWNED OIL
COMPANY OF VENEZUELA.
LOOK.
ROSS IS NOT THE FIRST BUSINESS
PERSON IN GOVERNMENT WITH
BLATANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMERCE
SECRETARY A BILLIONAIRE HEIR TO
THE FORTUNE BOUGHT ANOTHER
COMPANY THAT BOUGHT A BUILDING
THAT THEY THEN RENTED TO THE
U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK, PART
OF THE OWN COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
FOR $1.4 BILLION A YEAR.
THE DEPARTMENT EVEN AWARDED A
$10 MILLION GRANT TO A CLEAN
ENERGY COMPANY CO-CHAIRED BY HER
OWN COUSIN.
BUT THIS STUFF FROM WILBUR ROSS
IS IN A DIFFERENT LEAGUE OF
SWAMPINESS.
DID WILBUR ROSS TELL PRESIDENT
TRUMP ABOUT THESE CONFLICTS?
DOES THE PRESIDENT KNOW THAT THE
MAN NEGOTIATING TARIFFS DESIGNED
TO PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS FROM
IMPORTS IS MAKING MONEY FROM
SHIPPING THOSE IMPORTS TO
AMERICA?
IT IS TRULY ASTONISHING.
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS BACK
FROM SINGAPORE, LET'S HOPE HE
FINDS TIME TO TOSS WILBUR ROSS.
BY THE WAY, WE REACHED OUT TO
WILBUR ROSS'S OFFICE ASKING IF
THEY HAD ANY COMMENT ON OUR
