SEAN DUFFY REFERENCED HIM.

00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:17,149
VOWED TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,250
THE RUSSIAN COLLUSION THAT SO

11
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:18,917
FAR NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO

12
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:19,751
PROVE.

13

CONTRIBUTOR ANDY McCARTHY.

17
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,093
IF SCHIFF TAKES CONTROL OF THE

18
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:31,963
HOUSE INTEL, WHAT MIGHT WE

19
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:32,998
EXPECT SPECIFICALLY?

20
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,833
>> I ANY WE EXPECT EXACTLY WHAT

21
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,869
WE HEARD -- I THINK WE EXPECT

22
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,571
EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD FROM YOUR

23
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,006
LAST PANELIST, UNTIL MICHELLE

24
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,808
CALLED HER OUT ON IT, WHAT YOU

25
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,177
ARE GOING TO GET IS, YOU KNOW,

26
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,878
LET'S LOOK AT THE TRUMP TOWER

27
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,114
MEETING, LOOK AT THE FINANCING

28
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,482
BEHIND TRUMP'S BUSINESS EMPIRE,

29
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:54,619
LET'S IN PARTICULAR LOOK AT THE

30
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,221
FINANCING OF HIS REAL ESTATE

31
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,023
ASPECT OF HIS BUSINESS.

32
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,391
OF COURSE THEY'LL SAY THEY NEED

33
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,793
THE TAX RETURNS FOR THAT.

34
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:03,962
AND WE WILL BE OFF TO THE RACES.

35
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,130
THAT'S WHAT IT WILL BE FOR

36
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,598
HOWEVER LONG IT LASTS.

37
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,166
ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE OF GREAT

38
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,201
BENEFIT POLITICALLY TO THE

39
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:09,601
PRESIDENT.

40
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,103
BUT I DON'T THINK THE COUNTRY

41
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,637
WILL LIKE IT.

42
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:13,638
>> Laura: THEY'LL ALWAYS

43
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:15,907
OVERREACH, TRY TO TANGLE

44
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:17,709
EVERYTHING UP, AND TANGENTIAL

45
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,611
ISSUES THAT WILL NOT HELP A

46
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,812
SINGLE AMERICAN, HAVE A BE JO,

47
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,881
HOLD A BE JO, AND RAISE WAGES.

48
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:23,582
NONE OF THAT IS GOING TO BE

49
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,084
ACCOMPLISHED.

50
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,586
IT'S PAV LOEFIAN WHERE THE

51
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,087
DEMOCRATS SAY, LIKE THEY'RE AT

52
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,589
THE GATES AND THEY JUST WANT TO

53
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,490
RUSH THE GATES AND GET THE STUFF

54
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,858
DONE.

55
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,792
ANDY, I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT A

56
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,328

00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,710
AND ONE OF THE CHIEF

00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,644
BENEFICIARIES OF THESE FOREIGN

00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,314
WEISSMANN.

66
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:57,282
OF COURSE ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR

00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:57,849
PEOPLE IN THE MUELLER

68
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,718
INVESTIGATION.

69
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,852
WHAT'S GOING THERE?

70
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,387
>> YEAH, THIS HAS BECOME A

71
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,290
REALLY BIG PROBLEM, LAURA.

72
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,292
I WROTE ABOUT IT A FEW MONTHS

00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,863
FINANCIAL FRAUD INVESTIGATION IN

75
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:12,230
NEW YORK.

76
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,732
THIS WHOLE IDEA OF THE FBI AND

77
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,767

TRADING INFORMATION, AND THEY'RE

81
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,574
GETTING FAVORS OUT OF THIS,

82
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,408
THEY'RE GETTING TICKETS TO

83
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,910
SPORTS EVENTS, THEY'RE GETTING

84
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,444
ALL KINDS OF BENEFITS OUT OF IT.

85
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,047
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING

86
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:29,681
AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

87
00:02:29,682 --> 00:00:00,000
