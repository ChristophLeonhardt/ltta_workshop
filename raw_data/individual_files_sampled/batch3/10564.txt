hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle to the summit can Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un's start a meaningful peace process as well as what's Italy's democratic process means for the EU and much much more on this edition of cross them cross nothing the summit I'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Dimitri Babak he's a political analyst with Sputnik International and in London we cross Alexander Matthias he is a writer on legal affairs as well as editor-in-chief of the dur√°n dot-com all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate let me go to London first let me go to Alex I just do a quick update and what's going on on the on the Korean Peninsula this time last week a trumpet said no now he says yes what I think is in play is really the the inter-korean dynamic here this is where the real peace process but there is one going to be one it originated there and it's going to continue there and we'd have to see where the u.s. stands but even if the u.s. does change its mind one once more it doesn't mean a peace process is over go ahead Alex in London I think you are correct to point out that this actually started as an inter-korean dialogue the Koreans first started to talk to each other properly back in January when Kim Jong on basically made a speech a new year address he said let's go to the Olympic Games and we've seen this thing take off now I also think you're absolutely right to say that it is the United States which is being pulled along there are some people in the United States who I think are not happy with this process but ultimately what can the u.s. do if South Korea agrees to discern or Korea agrees to disarm to get rid of its nuclear weapons and South Korea says the US troops must go does the u.s. say no to those two things well I think some people would like it to you know and I think it's really interesting let me go to Dima here I mean you know in looking at the mainstream media it is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula not North Korea only also the North Korean leadership has made it clear very wisely from a diplomatic point of view is that they're not demanding a complete immediate withdrawal of American troops that would be proud of some part of some kind of process here I mean they are displaying a step-by-step process Donald Trump through his last other Ames's about it seems to be picking up on that he said there won't be a deal made in one meeting smart okay because there won't be one on top of it we have an international charm offensive going on you usually don't say North Korea and charm but now we are meeting with President Putin so this is having a ripple effect well I mean it's it's very easy to out charm the United States with these days Michael pants said that developments in North Korea could take who could go along the Libyan model you know we won't remember what happened to Libby and what's going on there now so it's not a very appealing perspective but you know the way Trump handles it on the 13th of June you know one day after the presumed summit South Korea has local elections and they have midterm elections to their Parliament so it's very important for president moon jae-in who did a lot for peace on the peninsula to come to this election with some kind of a result well he's already I mean there's already results in it this is all about a process mark there's still a lot of landmines in the in the incan going to and I and I want to say it's not there's nothing wrong with being cautiously optimistic but we do see the past okay lack of goodwill on all sides including the United States the last time this yeah there's nothing wrong with being consciously optimistic but I'm not at all cautiously I'm not I'm not optimistic cautiously or not I mean the landmines are so huge I mean just the fact that the two Koreas are speaking to each other is already a progress that I I think we should recognize and we we should have we should lower our expectations for this right but I mean we have figures in the administration we have Bolton we have Pompeo we have NS and others right we have the u.s. deep state we have Japan which does not want to see the two Koreas unified as it has historical animosities with Cuba we have the South Korea deep state because they have a conservative military and intelligence apparatus which is not very happy with their own president right and some of the gestures he's making towards we have can't remember that just a few weeks ago when the US pushed defense drills with North Korea that wood was going to involve strategic assets including b-52 and f20 bombers and f-22 fighters both nuclear capable that already almost sunk these talks so it would take only a very small military provocation and it's not like we haven't seen as before exactly to to not only sink this but to send us in the other direction let me go back to London Alex here one of the things that is okay I'll take marks you know he's not cautiously optimistic and I think that balances us all out on this program here but you know bringing the Russians on board the Chinese on board certainly elements of the South Korean political leadership I agree with mark there's going to be the deep state that's going to be very hesitant but this is creating a momentum and anyone that's involved in negotiations and it particularly Donald Trump with the art of the deal no one wants that how have the perception out there that they didn't follow through and I think this is part of the dynamic that is being played out right now go ahead Alex talking about momentum let's talk about this off on summit I mean the deep state people like Bolton deliberately tried to sabotage the Kim Trump summit that was why they were bringing up this business about Libya that was why all those drills happened and yet in spite of all of that in spite of Trump saying the summit is called off the summit is back on and the reason it is back on is because the Koreans the two Koreas responded why talk to each other and that is the momentum but mark is absolutely right there are all sorts of people who don't like this Japan might want to go along with this eventually but it is not going to be happy to have 80 million population career economic giant and arrival on its doorstep and it wanders veinte Korea South Korea which I have there is no love loss between Koreans and John no no none but I think I'm gonna change gears here but at the end of the day it's all about country's sovereignty South Korea maybe want to claw some of it back and Japan will have to think about its dependence on the United States if the deal is made alright let's ditch change gears here Deema I was watching the Italian elections with great fascination essentially the the powers that be we're putting a brake on democracy the two parties that won more than 50% of the vote and then they backtracked here and now we have the EU first lecturing the many figures in the EU lecturing the Italians about how they should vote but the democratic process is inching ever so slowly forward in Italy is what kind of message is that sending Brussels and the rest of the membership of the EU well I think the message is don't trust the mainstream media who calls anyone who disagrees with the European Commission populist far-right dangerous marginalized politicians the 5-star you know and the Northern League they have won together you know if we add their percentage of the world they they want more than 50% of the vote of the people who actually came to the polls they had the full right to suggest their prime minister when the president said Roma Tyrell and tried to sabotage it that was a scandal but obviously there are some changes taking place in the you because I think two years ago three years ago the European Commission would simply you know push their idea through you know because the Northern League and and that the five-star committed a mortal sin they called for an end to anti-russian sanctions in their so-called government contract but now when the head of the European Commission jean-claude Juncker oh you'll carry French when he is saying unquote in this I do think we have to reconnect with Russia not forgetting what our difference are but the Russia bashing has to be brought and and appalled when such things you hear from the head of the European Commission something has to change inside I I think maybe you know again consciously optimistic is it there may be the awareness it's not the rise of the populist left it's not the rise of the populist left and right but it's really the failure of the center of the centrist parties and are they going to get on board and understand that people are going to vote for alternatives so I don't think you understand the danger that this populist democracy presents to the European Union finance like you're lecturing us all now more because thankfully the Italian figurehead president rightly recognized that the euro is greater than democracy right and acted to defend it by preventing this this joint far right far left governments finance minister who was very critical of the euro from being appointed the EU s budget chief I think said it best gone through injure he says it is unacceptable unacceptable for Italians to vote for populist the markets will teach them how to vote okay Alexander reacted that because I think that was really the best quote of them all but but you know it gets down to either you promote and work or work through the process of democracy or you don't and in this case we had glaring polar examples of one or the other go ahead why have these two parties the five-star movements and the Northern League now become the dominant parties in Italy they've become the dominant parties in Italy because the mainstream parties in there in Italy the democratic party will form a communist party by the way some people might be interested to know became essentially transmission belts for the orders they were getting from Frankfurt and and Brussels they were no longer responding to Italian electorates they were responding to what they were being told to do from the EU center now given that this has failed in Italy we've had 20 years of economic recession and stagnation there we have a 35 percent unemployment amongst young people we have had lower living standards it is uncle Alex they're gonna jump in here gentlemen we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on real news stay with arty welcome back to crosstalk we're all thanks for considering I'm Peter LaBelle to remind you we're discussing some real news okay do you might want to go back to the Italy youth story here when it on the tail end of what Alexander Mackerras had to say in London all of this is going on with a looming trade war with the United States so add that into the mix well there is a big split in the yuan on economic matters particularly on the so called North stream you know the gas from Russia going to Europe and it's exactly the same kind of split that we have on the attitude of the you to Trump's pullout from the Iran deal Poland and some other East European states there for the Iranian power out they want to protect Trump from criticism from the U and they're against the North Stream project and what is very interesting is the cynical attitude of the United States I mean the spokeswoman for the State Department Sandra old kik denied encoding the malicious rumor according to which the US only opposed the pipeline in order to sell gas to Europe well it's not a malicious rule exactly true it's the same kind of a malicious rumor that we've heard about about Iraq not having weapons of mass destruction before the American invasion or about the Russians on this Bobtown could been actually a research we're gonna get to that story okay since you brought it up mark in a nutshell explain this resurrection of a Russian journalist in Ukraine who's anti-russian okay I think I got that right okay so this journalist opposition activists are Arkady Bab chenko he's a veteran of the Chechen war he tried in the Russian side and the Russian side he tried to get out of military duty by claiming mental illness in fact he got caught bribing a doctor to claim he was mentally ill he ended up not serving when his parents broke into his commander's office and threatened to chain themself to the radiator then he volunteered to go back to the second chechen war as a contract soldier then he became anti-war then he became anti Russian government and this is a guy who really has no love for his country and the country doesn't have much love for him he celebrated the death of children in a fire in Quetta MO recently saying burn and burn he so he celebrated the death of a Red Army choir and journalists that were on route to Syria for a performance saying they were as guilty as Putin and he posted on social media that he promised to come back to Russia on the first NATO tank coming into Moscow so this guy's quite a caring let me go to me Dima can you fulfill you know get bring us up to the to the present here I mean I mean this this whole scam here I mean the reason why I I'm interested in this story I'm not interested in didn't interested in this guy at all okay well he's a character I mean Hollywood stuff here but they love the Western journalists exactly how they react to this they they took it as gospel from the government in Kiev that the Russians are behind it there's not any evidence whatsoever that is the case let me tell you that he is their most famous Russian journalist living now in Ukraine you know and he has been before that story happened because he also covered the don't possible from the Ukrainian side he was with the Ukrainian soldiers bombin dounia's he's now employed by ATR which is funded by the u.s. they probably and and Russia is such as military the American Embassy rush you know is such a totalitarian country after bombed in Donbass he returned to Russia lived here for three years and only left again for Ukraine in 2017 in the end of 2017 so when the news came that his body was found by his wife right next to his apartment after three shots of course all the officials in Ukraine and in the West with a notable exception of President poroshenko himself started saying that they're sure it was Russia let me just quote the Ukrainian Prime Minister here the Russian totalitarian machine didn't forgive Bob Janko his honesty and his high principles he was a true friend of Ukraine which told the world you read about the Russian aggression well if it's the kind the same kind of truth that bob has spread about his death then you can imagine what kind of true the Ukrainian they let me go back to London to Alexander the story for me the only importance of this story is the fact that shows that Western media will take anything hook line and sinker from the from the the folks in Kiev that will paint Russia in a very negative light and we do have the World Cup opening up in Russia very shortly this is just another way to tarnish Russia's reputation go ahead Alex well indeed if you actually look at the British the media reaction when Bob Janko turned up alive there is a huge sense of betrayal and anger with Ukraine surprise surprise surprise angry because of a gift then they expose this narrative as in this case a falsehood and an awful lot of people are very upset and angry with Ukraine for doing that that is one of the most remarkable things people who say well the terrible thing about this story is it's going to mean that Putin and the Kremlin propaganda machine are going to be able to exploit this to prove that other things I am certainly not exploiting anything I'm just you shining the light on this because that is the only antidote to this kind of propaganda here mark go ahead jump in okay so the this whole sordid I mean it obviously has some good planning here the Ukrainian MP who was in on this said that it was done in the style of Sherlock Holmes because Sherlock Holmes also did something like this and it was very successful for him I hate to tell it to this Rada MP but Sherlock Holmes isn't a real character we had a fake killer who actually used to be part of these Ukrainian old victim a fake victim the the world's first verified crisis actor right Lazarus blue returning just like the scribbles from the dead I think they must have shot him with with with certified Nova Chuck dummy blanks only ten times more powerful than VX which means essentially harmless right the supposedly the guy who hired this killer they're saying who has links to Russian intelligence he says he's actually linked to Ukrainian counterintelligence there may be a business angle because he is partner and and somebody's release it all this German Ukrainian venture to build Cyprus site sniper scopes for the Ukrainian intelligence services and there's a disagreement over who owned this company so some people say that was all part of an elaborate corruption scam she loved our line of business it was so entertaining it's so Ukrainian sorted let me just put in a nutshell the reaction of the Western press to all of this affair box includes alive but Putin still killed him that is the reaction and come from from Canada I think he found the most hilarious headline about this the pop chinco stunt may end up feeding the Kremlin spin machine so how Patrick Comstock actually comments on that I just love it those pesky Russians will use our lies to prove that we actually lie this is impossible this is unacceptable but in fact if you analyze the story there is something in common something in common that the Bob Schenker murder has with Trump Russia collusion story both never happened but there was a hysterically action and the very well oiled cold war propaganda machine started working in the West and now it just can't stop you know with Bob junket has to stop abruptly because of his resurrection withdrawn because before we started this program demon I was pointing out that you have newspaper clippings and those are those are physical you can save them but in this day and age people just wipe the internet clean okay I want to change topics here Alex I want to go to you an important sorry it's not getting a lot of coverage is that the US wants to move anti-missile defenses in the THAAD system into Europe presumably because of the withdrawal the United States from the Iran deal that Iran is somehow a threat to Europe this is this is very provocative behavior on the part of the u.s. considering Europe is staying with the deal with the Iranians go ahead Alex but it isn't surprising and I think the point to make about anti-ballistic defenses and all the rest is that the United States has been driving these now for at least twenty years and he's going to continue doing so and he's looking for every opportunity to do so and the primary country that they are directed against is Russia that is to me irrefutable irrefutably true you know it's interesting because I don't see the security necessity mark but these systems are very expensive aren't they I mean someone's going to be cashing in on this they're extremely expensive but I'm sure the Trump administration would try to get the German government to foot the bill his constant complaints you're gonna say to the German come and go no you can't import your cars their cars li not a distinctive Mercedes Benz but you have to take more insuring them but they're not spending enough on their NATO spending to counter the Russian threat that is actually far closer to them so the US wants they're already putting these missile defense systems in Poland Romania Alaska at sea in South Korea now they want to put them in Germany there's also talk about a new US military base on the East Germany towards the border with Poland the Polish government is now begging Trump they want to pay Trump two billion dollars for US military forces to put a base in their country while people around the world are protesting for the thousandth u.s. for military us to occupies that it is bizarre their behavior it's because everyone in Poland has an auntie in Chicago here I mean let me go to D mater is rapidly running out of time here but I mean one of the interesting things is that at the end of the Second World War NATO was put into place to keep the Americans in the Germans down in the Russians out exactly it seems that the Trump administration is doing everything possible to rearrange the countries maybe they keep Germany down but it's pushing the United States out and we had we had Makram visiting st. Petersburg with quite a few overtures towards Vladimir Putin even calling themself in equal to the Russian president the problem is that a lot of anti Russian resolutions ideas they're enshrined in the use documents so it will take a long time for Europe to get rid of this pressure from the United States but I hope Europe will sooner way to liberate itself not by the liberal in European Union itself but by some other form you know probably individually ten-second smart yeah we have a further stretch Colombia is asking right this is another expansion while Trump is is preaching against NATO and saying that Europe isn't spending enough on NATO defense Paulin wants us military bases that in Germany now Columbus is this is just as foreign policy lawless gentlemen we've run out of time many thanks to my gifts in Moscow and in London this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rolls okay this is the extended version of our program but we have political potpourri mark sloboda you're up first what's on your mind yeah I think first we ought to hear our message on anti-propaganda narratives and Richard Stengel ER at the Council of Foreign Relations US government funded rolling up you'll be the last question but I just want to weigh in on that for one second so there's another word for master narratives it's called history basically every country creates their own narrative story and and you know my old job at the State Department was what people used to joke as the chief propagandist job we haven't talked about propaganda propaganda I'm not against propaganda every country does it and they have to do it to their own population and I don't necessarily think it's that awful in this the message I take from that is that one country can do it but no one else is allowed to do no one else is allowed to have their own narratives only one meta-narrative and it come and they admit it they admit it it's an extraordinary horse's mouth Richard Stengel er he it used to be the number four at the US State Department and he jokes that he was in charge of State Department propaganda where we're not laughing Richard he was then the editor of Time magazine during the Obama years right from US State Department to running our media right that's control of the narratives again the free Fourth Estate supposedly right and now he's lecturing us from the Council of Foreign Relations why we should accept this media I think this this confluence between state intelligence and media the Fourth Estate is so dangerous max Blumenthal said it best having 4x Intelligence Agency principals Comey clapper Hayden bredren on book tours and or dominating anti-trump commentary is a great way to counter Trump's narrative of a deep state coup yep deep state is really actually in charge of everything including the man Alexander let me go to you they're very open about it too I mean it's it's kind of the you know expose deep state I mean there's it's no longer shrouded in darkness was it it's out of the club there you go out of the closet and everybody can see just how ugly and perverse it is go ahead it calls into question its effectiveness because if propaganda can be seen as propaganda by many people and the people who are practicing it brag openly that it is propaganda then it starts to be challenged and becomes less convincing and we also see the other side of this picture which is a rather dark one which is when propaganda becomes so important then of course you have to start suppressing those people who are telling things which are country okay well I mean essentially the message is there's good propaganda and there's bad propaganda mark finish empire but propaganda against its own citizens he's got no problem with the US government propagandizing its own citizens that is what he said that's how wars have been started every country propagandize is its own population so populations in different countries have absolutely different ideas about what actually happens between them right so when he says that we used to jokingly call they used to jokingly call myself the chief propagandist well I mean the joke the best joke just happened in Ukraine because obviously no one except poroshenko and a few people in the Ukrainian security service knew about this terrible provocation around arkady babka so-called murder and and poroshenko was the only one who didn't comment it on the first day accusing Russia he waited until Bob gingka was resurrected and then what did you say I congratulate our Ukrainian security service which gets more and more effective every day in resisting the Russian aggression and he keeps telling the same kind of lies - to argue miracle - to a man Omicron I mean don't be confused he's telling them the same things he is telling their population the problem is they're willing to believe it and not only your you think you're absolutely right and I'm glad I'm glad you let me go up at the back to Alexander in London I'm glad Dima brought this up because it really shows this is just another glaring example of how the Fourth Estate the media are in bed with the powers that be they're just a conveyor belt a sonographer of the powers that be and no wonder people watch this program ok because they because we are one of the few alternatives out there go ahead Alexander Mackerras from London if we're talking about the media in the country I know best which is Britain on so many topics now it seems to speak with one voice especially if I have to say on foreign policy and of course it is the voice that you would expect it to say if it was acting in unison with the powers that be in in the government and in the Foreign Office the function of the media in Britain in a democratic society this has been at least let me let me ask you a question because I think it's very important I mean you're in the UK how did you feel with about this whole Tommy Robinson saga I mean I'm not I'm the last I'm the last person that will stick up for all of his views because I have to find a lot of his views to be quite odious okay but the lack of due process and shutting down the media I find horrifying it's terrifying and it's like Europe you live in the country that gave us a modern sense of the rule of law and due process how did you react to all this well to the point so did many other people in Britain it provoked protests and it provoked petitions and unsurprisingly actually because when the media space becomes so controlled yeah that it no longer dialogue any longer it becomes a reflection of the national conversation then obviously people are going to feel increasingly resentful and angry so it was not clever what was done yeah stupid and it was wrong I don't even understand the rationale for the D noticed forbidding yeah I don't even I don't understand the Russian I don't like Tommy Robinson I don't have anything positive to say about him I think is odious I think he's repulsive right but the the d notice forbidding media from reporting on it is is unfathomable to me where were operating on media teams right where where the the the media is as alexander said simply working as transmitters of information and they are extremely partisan in this during this babichenko affair where they claimed a journalist was murdered and he resurrected like descrip miriam elder a journalist on russia and she used to be a foreign policy now she's a BuzzFeed she spoke about the collective trauma that journalists experience now in Ukraine there have been talking about our trauma that we have to go through all the room there have been eleven journalists and media workers killed in the past three years four years since the West back might on porch seized power they have all been critical of the new regime that seized power I don't remember her for any Western journalists expensing a you know experiment expressing a collective palette a trauma over the dress of and race tenon or Oleg booze inna or aundrea riccelli the Italian journalists they didn't even comment when these journalists were killed why because these journalists were working for the other team yes who were working for the Ukrainian government about the Ukrainian government line who were murdered like pavel sherry met and poroshenko the president whenever he was asked about their investigations said he couldn't comment on anything he led the investigation do it but let me quote him he will do everything possible not to leave any parts of this investigation that is not accessible to journalists well he has shown his attitude to journalists during this 20 hours when all the journalists were sure that investigators were basically questioning Bob Jenkins wife that they were indeed looking for of all the traces of the murderer but in fact if we look at the world there are quite a few mega Bob Jenkins operating around the world there was a mega box incorporating before the war in Iraq there was a bob concur in Robert Morris Commission there is a bunker hiding us creep out from the John list so that she reads statements translated from English instead of coming up at a real press conference so we have mega Bob Jenkins around the world basically Bob can calls against us yes all right gentlemen we run out of time here I hope you've enjoyed the extended version of our program and I hope to see you next week remember crosstalk rules you
