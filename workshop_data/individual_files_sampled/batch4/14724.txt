I know it was a little dark there so you'd be forgiven for thinking those were Isis militants pulling down a statue but no that was on American soil and those were protesters at the University of North Carolina toppling a Confederate statue the protesters many of whom I'm guessing were students since UNC school years started yesterday apparently covered the monument with banners saying for a world without white supremacy then snuck behind the banners to start putting a rope around the statue it's at this point that if I were campus police I'd wonder just what the heck is going on I mean you don't install $390,000 in surveillance cameras and security and then just let that happen and it wasn't like this was out of the blue either Oh No there were clashes between protesters and police earlier in the day and get this police apparently arrested only one person for concealing their face and resisting arrest no one was arrested for property damage and no one was arrested for this the protesters are now linking arm and arm and there appear to be people who are actually lying down in the middle of the street as well of course none of this is surprising when you remember what happened to protesters in Durham North Carolina who tore down a Confederate statue last August that's right nothing let's hear what some of you NC zone students had to say about the statue it signifies a nation that was wholly unamerican against our values it's been like a year to allay controversy and debate I mean we spoke about it in high school and thing so the fact that it's down and I was here to witness it it's just so much amazing he's covered in black blood he was raised on black blood that's his foundation on Monday I went to silence damn I poured my blood and red ink on the statue that last woman was UNC graduate student Mya little who yes had previously poured ink and apparently her own blood on the statue but if any of these bright-eyed bushy-tailed revolutionaries given a thought as to where exactly this purging of history ends is it Robert Ely in the Confederacy is it Abraham Lincoln how about Thomas Jefferson give these savages an inch and they will take a mile free campus unmasked I'm Rob chin shock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
