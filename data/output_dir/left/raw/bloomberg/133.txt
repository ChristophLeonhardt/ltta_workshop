1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,700
Agriculture has not really innovated materially in the past 10,000 years.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,920
It’s an industry that it hasn’t really benefited from technology.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,860
One thing that we want to do is to disrupt agriculture

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,700
in a way that can produce food that is both high-quality but also is affordable.

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:36,000
Over the next five years the middle class population of China is expected to top 550 million people.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,140
And by 2025, there will be over 200 Chinese cities each with a population over 1 million.

7
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,180
That’s a lot of mouths to feed.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,200
A Beijing start-up thinks it has a way to grow more food.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,940
We started out by building a farm inside of a shipping container.

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,940
Part of the reason for that was that

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,600
they are mobile, they are modular and they are highly standardized.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,760
And at any given time there is over 10 million idle containers in the world.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,120
Alesca Life’s vertical farm in central Beijing

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,840
can produce up to 60 kilograms of vegetables a week with no soil.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,500
It uses only recirculated water, a few LED lights and a monitoring app.

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
Here’s how it works -

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,880
seeds are placed in sponges and grow up to 17 days.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,500
Then the plants are moved a few feet away to a nursery area

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,200
and finally into a finishing area where roots dangle in beds of fertilized water

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,360
until the produce is ready for harvest.

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,440
Because our container is climate-controlled

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,540
it allows us to do a full harvest 26 times a year.

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,240
And a typical farm can only rotate their land anywhere between four to six times.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,300
And really the challenge is what can you grow profitably more than what can you grow.

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,040
The high costs to set up and run the farm

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,920
means Alaska Life sells its vegetables for about 13 times more than traditionally grown vegetables.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,040
For now Alesca Life’s customers are mostly in the high-end restaurant business

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,940
who can afford to pay for reliability and high quality.

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,640
Restaurant manager Stefano Censi recently stopped at the container farm to check on the flavor of arugula-

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,220
a green that is hard to come by in China.

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,320
Yeah, It’s good.

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,780
It definitely has energy. It’s nice.

33
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,220
It really kicks in at the end.

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,280
A fifth of China’s farmland is mainly contaminated by heavy metals,

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,260
and Alesca Life is betting wealthier consumers will be demanding healthier food.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,800
The Chinese government has been funding scientists like Professor Yang Qichang

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,440
to research vertical farming.

38
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,320
Container farms have popped up around the world

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,160
and Alesca Life has deals with countries in the middle east to test their technology in the desert.

40
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,500
Co-founder Stuart Oda thinks if his company can grow vegetables in the sand dunes

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,640
we might one day see farms in even harsher environments.

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,900
There’s enough challenges here on earth for us to be tackling at the moment,

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,860
but after we can solve some of those challenges

44
00:03:01,860 --> 00:00:00,000
it’ll be nice to look into supporting food production in outer space.
