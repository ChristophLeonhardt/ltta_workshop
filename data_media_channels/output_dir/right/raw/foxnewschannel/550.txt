1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,278
FOREMAN TEAM AND TENDENCIES

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:11,216
RESEMBLING A DISPOSITION.

3
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:16,120
>> Martha: JOINING ME NOW,

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,822
NIGEL FARAGE, AND A FOX NEWS

5
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:17,222
CONTRIBUTOR.

6
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:19,691
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF

7
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:20,425
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REMARKS ABOUT

8
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:21,827
IRAN AND HIS RESPONSE?

9
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:25,497
>> FIRST, HIS RESPONSE IS A BIT

10
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:27,966
RICH FOR THE WORLD'S FIRST

11
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:29,067
ISLAMIC EXTREMIST REGIMES AND

12
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,003
WHICH HAS NOW BEEN IN PLACE FOR

13
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:34,172
40 YEARS TO ACCUSE OTHERS OF

14
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:36,108
RACISM, EXTREMISM AND NAZISM

15
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:39,278
WHICH FRANKLY IN MANY WAYS IS

16
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:41,713
ALL THAT MAY BE ENCOMPASSED OVER

17
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:42,548
THESE DECADES.

18
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:44,550
THIS IS I THINK WITHOUT DOUBT

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,552
THE MOST DANGEROUS AND

20
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:48,720
UNPLEASANT REGIME IN THE WORLD.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,789
TRUMP, AND CLEARLY JOHN BOLTON

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,958
BEING THERE NOW IS A VERY

23
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,359
IMPORTANT INFLUENCE.

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,462
TRUMP IS CALLING OUT IRAN, AND

25
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,764
HE SAYS YOU GUYS ARE SPONSORING

26
00:00:58,764 --> 00:00:59,965
TERRORISM, SPREADING IT ACROSS

27
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:00,966
YOUR BORDERS.

28
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,301
THE DEAL THAT OBAMA STRUCK WITH

29
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,970
YOU DID NOT WORK.

30
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,572
FAR FROM TAMING YOU, IT MAY DO

31
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:07,372
WORSE.

32
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:09,508
AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S VERY

33
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:10,242
INTERESTING BUT OF ALL THAT WAS

34
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:15,347
SAID TODAY, I THINK YOU END BY

35
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,349
TRUMP, IRAN HAD THE MOST

36
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,150
INTERESTING THING.

37
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,453
BECAUSE TODAY OF ALL DAYS, THE

38
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:24,356
EUROPEAN UNION'S FOREIGN

39
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:25,991
MINISTER WHO BY THE WAY IS

40
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:29,161
UNELECTED, SHE SAID TODAY THE

41
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,130
E.U. IS FACILITATING EASIER

42
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,964
TRADE WITH IRAN.

43
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:36,635
SO YOU HAVE TRUMP ON COLLISION

44
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:41,373
COURSE, FOR THE GOOD GUYS AND

45
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:42,541
THE BAD GUYS.

46
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,643
>> CLEARLY THIS IS ALL OVER THE

47
00:01:44,643 --> 00:01:47,312
IRAN DEAL AND TRUMP'S DECISION

48
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:49,548
TO PULL OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL.

49
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:51,550
AND, THE E.U. PUSHED BACK TO

50
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:51,984
THAT.

51
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:52,851
PRESIDENT TRUMP CLEARLY CALLED

52
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,386
FOR THE ALLIES TO RALLY

53
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:54,753
TOGETHER.

54
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:56,321
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WILL

55
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:59,958
CHANGE THAT IN TERMS OF THE

56
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,293
PERSPECTIVE FROM THE U.K. OR THE

57
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:04,763
REST OF EUROPE?

58
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:07,566
>> AS FAR AS THE E.U. IS

59
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:11,704
CONSIDERED, NO.

60
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:13,005
WE SHOULD EMBRACE THEM

61
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:13,939
ECONOMICALLY.

62
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,407
THE TRUMP BOLTON IDEA IS, THESE

63
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:19,378
GUYS GIVE IT A CHANCE WITH THE

64
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:19,945
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

65
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,547
THEY ABUSED THIS AND BECOME EVEN

66
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:22,648
MORE TERRORISTIC AND SPREAD THAT

67
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:25,551
BAD MESSAGE ALL OVER THAT

68
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:26,352
REGION.

69
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:27,053
SO KNOWN.

70
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,455
THOSE TWO POSITIONS ARE

71
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:30,156
UNCOMPROMISING FROM A BRITISH

72
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:33,559
POINT OF VIEW, AND IT'S VERY

73
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,560
INTERESTING.

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,696
BREXIT, WHICH WOULD MAKE US

75
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:37,496
INDEPENDENT ULTIMATELY, THE U.K.

76
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:39,732
WILL HAVE TO DECIDE.

77
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:43,269
ARE WE WITH AMERICA OR WITH THE

78
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:43,569
E.U.?

79
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,204
>> Martha: THAT WILL BE A BIG

80
00:02:45,204 --> 00:02:47,340
MOMENT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP TO BE

81
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,608
SURE.

82
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:54,580
HE SAT DOWN AT THE U.N. WITH THE

83
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,314
PRESIDENT OF KOREA, AND HE SAID

84
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:59,151
SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING ABOUT

85
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:01,821
THE FUTURE OF THE PROGRAM IN

86
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:02,421
NORTH KOREA.

87
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:05,458
>> CHAIRMAN KIM ACTUALLY WANTS

88
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,060
TO ACHIEVE THE COMPLETE

89
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,398
DISPOSITION OF NORTH KOREA.

90
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:14,467
IN ORDER TO MAKE PROGRESS, HE

91
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,103
WANTS TO HAVE THE SECOND

92
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:19,405
NORTH KOREA SUMMIT AS SOON AS

93
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:21,374
POSSIBLE.

94
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,743
>> VERY STRONG CLAIM.

95
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:24,277
KIM WANTS TO HAVE A

96
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,045
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA

97
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,847
WITHIN THE FIRST TERM OF

98
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:28,314
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

99
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,750
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

100
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,152
>> WHETHER I BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

101
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,754
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

102
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:35,388
WORLD LEADERS WHO ARE SET

103
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:38,758
ENEMIES SITTING DOWN TALKING

104
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,359
TOGETHER IS A GOOD THING.

105
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:47,400
WINSTON CHURCHILL USED TO SAY,

106
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,634
DRAW DRAW IS BETTER THAN WAR

107
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:49,168
WAR.

108
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:50,970
AND I WOULD WELCOME A SECOND

109
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,972
MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.

110
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,574
NOTHING BAD COULD COME OF IT.

111
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:56,342
>> OBVIOUSLY THE WORLD BODY AND

112
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:58,678
THE U.N. IS A CONTROVERSIAL

113
00:03:58,678 --> 00:03:59,145
PLACE.

114
00:03:59,145 --> 00:03:59,946
THE PRESIDENT SAID SOMETHING

115
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:02,649
TODAY THAT GOT THE A CHUCKLE

116
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:04,784
FROM THE CROWD.

117
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,152
I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTIONS.

118
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:08,187
>> IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS MY

119
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:08,922
ADMINISTRATION HAS ACCOMPLISHED

120
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:11,958
MORE THAN ALMOST ANY

121
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,159
ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF

122
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:25,305
OUR COUNTRY.

123
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:25,538
OUR COUNTRY.

124
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:27,507
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT REACTION,

125
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,007
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

126
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,243
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU THINK

127
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:32,579
OF THAT MOMENT, NIGEL?

128
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,414
>> DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER, EVER

129
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:37,951
UNDERSELL HIS ACHIEVEMENTS.

130
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:42,155
HE DID IT IN FRONT OF A VERY,

131
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,723
VERY SKEPTICAL U.N. AUDIENCE AND

132
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:45,158
THEY LAUGHED, WHETHER IT WAS

133
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:46,593
WITH HIM OR AGAINST HIM, IT

134
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:47,527
DIDN'T MATTER.

135
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,129
IT WAS THE LATEST MOMENT OF THAT

136
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,163
SPEECH BECAUSE HE WENT ON FROM

137
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:54,835
THERE TO ATTACK MUCH OF WHAT

138
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:58,005
THAT STANDS FOR.

139
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:01,141
AND I SPENT 25 YEARS FIGHTING

140
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:03,477
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AGAINST

141
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,478
GLOBAL BUREAUCRACY AND TO ME

142
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,913
THAT SPEECH TODAY WAS AN

143
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:13,120
ABSOLUTE WAY.

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:00:00,000
AND ALL OF IT YOU HEARD TODAY IN
