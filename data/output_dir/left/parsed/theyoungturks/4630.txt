SO, A MOTHER OF A BOY WITH A
RARE GENETIC DISORDER TWEETED
OUT HER HOSPITAL BILL.
ALLISON'S SON ETHAN WAS BORN
WITH A RARE SYNDROME,
WHICH IS A RARE GENETIC DISORDER
IN WHICH ORGANS FORM ON THE
WRONG SIDE OF THE BODY.
SHE TWEETED OUT HER HOSPITAL
BILL, SAYING THAT IT SEEMS
FITTING THAT WITH THE TRUMP
DEBATE RAGING I GOT THIS BILL
FROM ETHAN'S MOST OPEN ñ MOST
RECENT OPEN-HEART SURGERY.
YOU WILL SEE THAT SHE IS ONLY
GOING TO BE PAYING $500, BUT
DON'T WORRY, SHE WON'T MAKE US
DO ANY MATH, SHE TWEETED THAT
WITHOUT INSURANCE SHE WOULD GO
$231,000 ABOUT.
SHE HAS COMMENTED EVEN MORE ON
TOP OF THIS.
SHE SAID, I DID NOT FOLLOW
POLITICS BEFORE NOVEMBER, I
WAS OVERSEAS FOR BOTH OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ELECTIONS.
I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT HOW
LOUD EACH SIDE YELLS, IT
PAINTS THESE ISSUES AS IF THEY
ARE BLACK AND WHITE WHEN
THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT THAT.
IT REDUCES OUR KIDS TO A LINE IN
A BUDGET, NOBODY REALIZES
THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE BEHIND IT.
I KIND OF DISAGREE WITH ONE
POINT HERE, WHERE SHE SAYS,
I HAVE BEEN SHOCKED BY HOW
LOUDLY, IT PAINTS THESE
ISSUES AS BLACK AND WHITE WHEN
THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT THAT.
I THINK THAT HEALTHCARE IS A
BLACK-AND-WHITE ISSUE FOR
ME, I THINK IT SHOULD BE
AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE.
AM I WRONG IN THINKING THAT?
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING, BECAUSE
YESTERDAY I WAS LISTENING TO
PATRIOT RADIO, WHICH IS ñ I KNOW
WE ARE ON PROGRESS RIGHT NOW,
AND I GUESS PATRIOT IS THE
CONSERVATIVE COUNTERPART TO THIS
RADIO STATION, AND THERE WAS A
DOCTOR WHO CALLED IN, AND HER
THOUGHTS ON HEALTHCARE ARE SO
DIFFERENT FROM THE THOUGHTS THAT
WE DISCOVER ON ñ THAT WE DISCUSS
ON THE SHOW.
SHE THINGS HEALTHCARE
SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR
CATASTROPHIC ISSUES, NOT FOR
PREVENTATIVE, HEALTHCARE,
ADDICTION, IT SHOULD BE USED FOR
ANYTHING, UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC HAPPENED
TO YOU.
SO IF YOU HAVE CANCER, THAT'S
WHEN IT WOULD COVER CERTAIN
THINGS.
THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS
BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE THINGS
LIKE YOU, GRACE NOT EVERYONE
THINGS LIKE US.
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
WHO WORK IN THE HEALTHCARE
PROFESSION WHO THINK THAT HEALTH
INSURANCE SHOULD ONLY KICK
IN WHEN IT COMES TO SERIOUS
TERMINAL ILLNESSES, WHICH
IS ABSURD.
THE WAY TO AVOID THESE TERMINAL
ILLNESSES OFTEN TIMES IS
PREVENTATIVE CARE.
ONE THING I'VE BEEN VERY
FASCINATED BY IS CUBA, NOT
ONLY FOR THEIR MEN, BUT BECAUSE
OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
ANA HUMANIZES US.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
AND IT'S IS INTERESTING BECAUSE,
BACK WHEN CUBA HAD RESOURCES
FROM THE SOVIETS, THEY ACTUALLY
HAD INSANELY GOOD HEALTHCARE.
NOW, OF COURSE THEY LOST A LOT
OF RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THE
FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION, BUT
THEY STILL HAVE THE BEST
PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE.
PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE IS SO
IMPORTANT.
THIS IDEA OF LIKE, WHO CARES
ABOUT PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE?
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO WORK THAT
WAY.
THE REASON WHY PEOPLE IN CUBA,
WHO BY THE WAY, MANY OF WHICH
LIVE IN POVERTY, THE REASON WHY
THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY IS SIMILAR
TO OURS, EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE
THE SAME RESOURCES AS US, IS
BECAUSE THEY FOCUS ON
PREVENTATIVE CARE, IT IS SO
IMPORTANT TO THEM.
SO, YOU KNOW, I LOVE THIS STORY,
NOT BECAUSE OF THE TRAGIC
CONDITION THAT HER SON HAS TO
GO THROUGH, BUT BECAUSE IT
PROVIDES SOME PERSPECTIVE.
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NOT
PERFECT.
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
ABSOLUTELY DOES DESERVE TO BE
CHRIS EYES, BECAUSE FOR SOME
PEOPLE IT HAS NOT WORKED OUT AND
IT HAS BECOME MORE COSTLY;
HOWEVER, THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT HELPED OUT.
THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF
THAT.
HE HELPED MY MOM WHO HAD A
CHRONIC DISEASE, A
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.
ANYWAY, YOU GUYS JUMP IN.
WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT HEALTH
INSURANCE, THIS IS A REALLY BIG
TOPIC, WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT
HEALTH INSURANCE IS, THESE
INSURANCE COMPANIES, AT THEIR
BEST, REALLY DO THAT YOU WANT
YOUR HOOK FOR A HUGE MEDICAL
BILL, AS WE HAVE JUST DETAILED.
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THESE
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE
BEGINNING TO BACK OFF ON A LOT
OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
COVER.
AND SO, THIS IS PART OF, JUST
A SEGUE INTO A GENERAL
DISCUSSION INTO WHAT'S
HAPPENING.
INSURANCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE
REALLY HAVE TO HAVE, BECAUSE
THERE ARE SO MANY HEALTH ISSUES
AND MEDICAL ISSUES THAT CONFRONT
US AND OUR FAMILIES, BUT THOSE
THINGS THAT ARE COVERED, THE WAY
THAT THEY ARE COVERED, THE WAY
THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES PUSH
BACK ON COVERAGE, IT'S A REAL
PROBLEM, AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN
EMERGING ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY
IN A VERY VERY SHORT TIME.
I MEAN, EVEN A BIGGER ISSUE THAN
IT ALREADY IS.
THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL
BANKRUPTCIES HAVE GONE UP I
THINK SOMETHING LIKE 61% SINCE
THE 1980S.
YOU HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY,
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN
DEAL WITH THE MEDICAL BILLS.
SO, FACING CATASTROPHIC MEDICAL
BILLS, WELL, THAT WOULD EASILY
BANKRUPT ANYONE.
I MEAN, MOST REASONABLE
MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE.
SO, ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,
THIS HEALTH CARE DEBATE,
AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY
DEBATE, IT'S PART OF A BIG
DEBATE, AND BIG PROBLEMS THAT
THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO HAVE
TO FACE, AND WE ARE BACKSLIDING
ON THEM I THINK, EVERY DAY.
ABSOLUTELY, IT'S A BIPARTISAN
ISSUE AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO
GET INVOLVED.
