Walter wanted to start with you and just get your view of where we are right now in this Cavanaugh nomination the president announcing yesterday that he's expanded it the FBI can talk to whomever it wants to talk to as long as that investigation is complete by Friday do you view Cavanaugh as more or less likely to be nominated than he was a week ago Morgan more likely more confirmed and I do think you needed a little bit of a break in this fever I mean this was getting the whole country was polish you're not gonna find out with an FBI investigation exactly what happened but we took a breather they're going to investigate in fact there's been a lot of breaks recently in the past couple of weeks even this u.s. USMC a the new trade agreement you know the problem for me is that trumps bullying hard on nasty tactics we just saw another clip of it there sometimes work and this gets you kind of conflicted because I think this trade deal is a good thing I think that it's going to succeed probably in the Cavanaugh case and so this incivility the fact that it can work so well is a little disconcerting to me so you're saying and again the case of trade where he pushed Justin Trudeau around and he bullied him but it got the result he wanted and perhaps the result that you and others who want free trade wanted as well yeah I mean it's not a revolutionary agreement it's pretty good agreement it did better things he bullied Trudeau around and it worked he pushed Cavanaugh ice assumed to do that I found grotesque testimony we blamed it on you know people who wanted to get back for the Clintons and everything else and that seems to have worked so it's always a bit good to see the country having things that work but also bad when it's incivility bullying and nastiness do it shouldn't we ask whether in both of those incidents there is a potential downside that then comes back to bite us from that tactic now bullying you may have got the trade deal it's a little bit better than after but it's basically the same in the protests Justin Trudeau has been bullied by the President of the United States and he's not going to totally forget that that will be part of the American Canadian relationship going forward we don't know whether it weakened that relationship but it'll have an impact on the relationship in the way that it does if you have a massive blowout with somebody who's meant to be a friend in the case of the Cavanaugh thing yeah maybe you can bully somebody through and you can get Cavanaugh to adopt that tone during the committee hearing but there are senators who were concerned about that tone who didn't particularly like the way that he spoke to Amy Klobuchar the way that he spoke to Dianne Feinstein even on the Republican side there was some queasiness about adopting that turn so yeah it can get results but I think we shouldn't ignore the fact and it's a bit like giving the economy a massive sugar high of tax cuts right there are costs to some of this behavior absolutely I mean I'm one of those Jesse would call crybabies like you who think it shouldn't have been done this way the better way and you have friends of christenings Wheatland I think the way that he attacked her yeah I could come back to on but we've been saying for two years this is all going to come back to haunt and it hasn't yeah and I'm just saying I feel a little disconcerted that his tactics which I find a bit repelling have kind of worked in the past couple of weeks and in some ways some of the fever is broken so Jeffrey Goldberg where are we right now in this Cavanaugh story I mean we're at the point now where people are debating the definition of blacking out when you drink we're going back 1985 to see a police report about where Judge Cavanaugh may or may not have thrown ice at someone in a bar heaven forbid what do you see as you watch all this play out I'm just waiting for squee to show up all answers will be delivered I'm with Walter I think the momentum is behind this nomination the barring barring a new revelation some dispositive piece of information about what happened that night or that day I find it hard to believe that the three wavering Republicans will do anything but vote to confirm and you know it's funny I woke up this morning thinking along the lines of Walters thinking even more so I thought wait Trump could win reelection I thought to myself you know it's you know we're talking about that we're time een this is no I haven't had that thought in a couple of months because it's been so chaotic but you know there's this the the he got the best of the Canadian Prime Minister obviously there are people in my universe in the foreign policy universe who would like to see him get the best of the North Koreans not Canada but you know you go for your easy marks but you know there there is a brute effectiveness to this method of governance he and I think you're exactly right you know the performance by Kavanagh in that hearing room was directed at making sure that Donald Trump stayed behind him he's Donnell he Donald Trump wanted to see a fighter and he got a fighter you know this is uh this is not an we'll see what happens but I think it's heading toward confirmation at this moment yeah let's let's kind of keep this discussion going because it's very interesting and and Jeffrey the point you raised about you think that Donald Trump could get reelected I would put on the table that if the election were held today Donald Trump would be reelected but let me ask this question what is happening to this country when we have a president of the United States who last night goes to Tennessee or Mississippi but he's going to a couple of other states this week a president in the United States who in the midst of all this glamorous events going on in this country takes to the country like an arsonist to burn down another political party to vilify people individually and it's a country now where it's no longer Democrats versus Republicans it's now Coastal's versus the inner country it's obviously liberals versus conservatives but we've taken another step it's now women versus men and all of it is fed by the president United States and on the front page of the New York Times yesterday there's a story migrant children moved under cover of darkness to a Texas tent city isn't even talking about is this who we are is this who we are becoming as a country and does this fuel Donald Trump's re-election yeah I think that's the big question and I think the next election will probably turn if we get another candidate with the Democrats nominated another candidate I would hope it would be on this question which is are we a better country than this are we more civil than this because the notion of a president winning by dividing the country is problematic and I think you got most of this nation saying let's take a breather now let's come back together let's calm things down I wanted to turn it if I made to Jeffrey I mean I used to Jeff I used to be your partner as you know in this Atlantic Festival you're doing I'd love to hear some of the people you're going to have at the festival this year and I know you're coming down to New Orleans to visit me in a week or two and we have dinner
