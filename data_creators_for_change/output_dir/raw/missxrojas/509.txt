00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,949
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so I'm home from uni now</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,740
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so strange so absolutely</font>

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,839
completely entirely bizarre I can't even

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">film in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my bedroom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment this is</font>

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,200
a room that used to be my bedroom when I

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,059
was about five until I was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,130
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> my room is just covered in so</font>

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,410
much stuff I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how I ever</font>

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,590
acquired that<font color="#CCCCCC"> monster like it's all just</font>

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,779
stupid amounts of things like random

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,609
things as well like I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay on my</font>

12
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,740
clothes and shoes and stuff and then I

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,400
have cocktail shakers and like a

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,679
builder's jacket like a back a hi-vis

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,920
jacket and policemen hat just Brandon

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,420
thing just feel so strange to be back

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,430
the fact that I finished my first year

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,379
at university I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is what is</font>

19
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,180
striking the most time it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,770
so quickly and I know that such a cliche

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">right that's just how it feels I can't</font>

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,910
wander into people's rooms I used to

23
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,590
always be wandering to George's room

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,449
Georgia came in this video in a while

25
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,770
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she's got her own YouTube</font>

26
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,360
channel which again you should check out

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,460
Georgia<font color="#E5E5E5"> Buchanan go and ice also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

28
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">wandering to Emma's room hills and</font>

29
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,430
they're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the next part along then</font>

30
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,870
my door would always be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to people</font>

31
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,030
would be wandering in or Jimmy ring on

32
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,559
Bradley would always be like walking

33
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,420
past and I'd go how the corner<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

34
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,100
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're hi Johanna smoker and Liz</font>

35
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,750
then we'd walk across the courtyard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> E</font>

36
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,430
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found the room that was unlocked</font>

37
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,770
it was so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much fun and we'll never have</font>

38
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,799
that holds experience back and

39
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,030
everything's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change now isn't</font>

40
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,159
it it's such a good first year you<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew</font>

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was so much fun especially third time</font>

42
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,220
I know a lot of people say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

43
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,960
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms a favor but third time was</font>

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,700
absolutely mind because my exams was

45
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,009
done so quickly and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to enjoy</font>

46
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,630
myself especially when the Sun came out

47
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got Twitter see and stuff and the</font>

55
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,549

56
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,189
people saying i'll see you in 2011

57
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,110
