well just before Christmas something happened in Canada and you know the timing of these things that gets lost in the holidays but I wanted to talk about it even though it's January and it's this a member of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation a woman of color who was active in race relations was fired by Justin Trudeau because she was a critic of radical Islam now she is a promoter of Islam in the sense that we are and Raheel Raza and Tareq Fattah and Salim and Sewer that is a an Islam that coexist with the West a patriotic Democratic liberal Islam progressive Islam critical of political Islam let me tell you the woman I'm talking about her name is Christine Douglas Williams and in fact she's the author of a book about liberalism and let's put the book on the screen here right now it's called the challenge of modernizing Islam now she was on the board of the Canadian race relations foundation now just give me one minute of history on that before I introduce Christine that was created by Brian Mulroney and the Japanese Canadian community to promote harmony so that for example the history of Japanese internment seventy-five years ago would not be forgotten so private money from the Japanese community plus government money from Maroni set up this race relations foundation well the problem about taking government money is you also have to take government direction and so when Christine Douglas Williams was found to have criticized radical Islam well Justin Trudeau would not tolerate that and so that liberal white man fired this woman of color based on her comments about Islam which is not a race but rather a set of ideas joining us now via Skype is Christine Douglas Williams nice to see you again Christine welcome to the show Thank You Ezra it's a pleasure did I accurately summarize what the Canadian race relations foundation is about and why you were sacked by Trudeau you did I'll add one other thing that I think is important the Japanese redress was all about when they finally signed that document with brian Mulrooney they did it so that such human rights violations will not happen again they want to make sure in that agreement that Canada was a place that was safe for everyone that equal rights and human rights will be practiced and will be celebrated in Canada I guess one of those human rights is freedom of religion and political freedom you dared to criticize radical Islam and one of the examples that the government told the Toronto Star I mean it was all very murky there was no formal on-the-record statement that I know of they just sacked you and then they leaked their reasons to the Toronto Star but I would take them at face value is that you criticized political Islam Muslim Brotherhood style political Islam in Iceland and apparently that is now a racist thing to do of course politically Islam it's not a race it's it's an ideology um are they basically weeding out anyone who is against the Muslim Brotherhood interpretation of Islam well that's how it appears to me Ezra based on motion m103 first of all it's important to be said that the Canadian race relations foundation functions under the Heritage Department and I want to clarify something I know one is even assuming why I got fired even though all evidence points to it I was given a letter a registered letter from Melanie Joly highlighting that this was the issue I I was very active on the Canadian race relations foundation as chair of the investment committee on the executive committee the human resource committee but here's what she said I have become aware and I'm quoting this note here of language used in your online articles and blogs that appear to be inappropriate and inconsistent with the CRF mandate vision of promoting diversity and inclusion and respect for democracy which is strange because that is exactly what I'm pursuing when I was on that board and also in my work off that board because I don't see color or creed when it comes to promoting human rights for all yeah well I want a quote from the Toronto Star they interviewed the president of the Canadian race relations the chairperson Albert Lowe and I just want to quote from the star because they asked Albert well what's Christine Douglas Williams live and Albert said we always appreciated her positive contributions she's always supportive of positive race relations and he he said I saw quite a number of participants in the Muslim community say they were very warm to her and always positive and friendly and I believe that to be true I don't know you well but I see you from time to time and I think it's that I mean and I feel the same way about when I see some of these Muslim progressives that I just described I think what Justin Trudeau and his cabinet Minister Melanie Joly are doing is they're purging anyone who supports progressive Islam and they're replacing them with people who support Islamic supremacism and you see that in Trudeau himself he has no compunction about going to the Wahhabi mosque in Montreal he brags about it there is no one to fundamentalist in Islam for him that's my hypothesis for what's going on I think your hypothesis is absolutely correct Ezra and I would go further to say that when one looks at the progressive Muslims they are not in support of this word Islamophobia that is a word that is in the organisation of Islamic Cooperation Observatory and it has a specific meaning which actually includes criticism of Islam now if one goes to the website and looks up what that means it talks about anti-muslim bigotry which I'm completely against but it also mentions criticism of Islam and how insulting it is to Muslims therefore they are promoting it as an anthem was a form of anti-muslim bigotry and attempting to outlaw criticism of Islam which is really a form of Sharia law and blasphemy laws that we see the OIC promoting globally yeah well it doesn't surprise me one bit that you were purged from this organization any organization that takes money from Trudeau is going to have to bend the knee to Trudeau and although I find it unacceptable that you were kicked off I don't find it surprising especially given that the cabinet minister who sent you the letter is also the one who be implementing m103 the anti Islamophobia censorship motion so it doesn't surprise me one bit what what has been the reaction from people who have dealt with the race relations foundation I read what the chairperson Albert Lowe said the toronto's to the strong start he was very supportive of you I I don't know who deals with the race relations foundation I don't know if they're all just sort of government hangers on who just do whatever Trudeau says because he pays them I don't know if there's actually any progressive Muslims who would have complained that you were kicked out what has there been mean or have people just sort of said good we never liked her anyways glad she's gone like what what has been the the political reaction the reaction from the community you you dealt with I will start by even saying aren't Mickey who signed the agreement with Brian Rooney is a wonderful person I have always gotten along fantastic with him when I have gotten that warning letter he he does not take sides but he certainly knows people and understands he has been very good to me the chair has been very good the co-chair the spokesperson because I was a member of the Executive Committee at any time I could have been not a member because you actually as an appointee you express an interest of a committee you may be able to contribute to and it's up to the executive that's there the Chairman to decide well or we are and you know we not putting her on that committee so I have had support they have not taken sighs publicly because obviously they have to run the Canadian Race Relations Foundation they're also operating under Melanie Jolie's Department but they have a vision for all of Canada their vision is harmony for all of Canada not just one specific group right an Albert law has written a piece called about politicizing race relations now which really was about some of the efforts that we're seeing today to do just that and it takes it out of the mainstream to to try to say while race relations belongs to one specific group namely in this case Islamists who have actually turned it around to be Islamophobia that has become the branding of anti-racism initiatives as we see with m103 yeah now you were appointed because of course the federal government it's run by Trudeau now it used to be run by Harper you were appointed under the Harper government and then reappointed less than three years ago has anyone from the conservative opposition benches spoken out or in any way shown support for you or objected to this politicization of the race relations foundation I have gotten a couple of emails personal private emails of support I don't know what the conversation is behind the scenes but I will tell you which is related to this I am very concerned what with what I see going on among traditional conservatives for example and I know this is provincial Patrick Brown when the anti Islamic phobia motion was went through the Ontario legislature he advised all of his his caucus to vote for it he supported it and he actually declared that there is Islamophobia and he made the mistake whether it was a mistake whether he was being politically correct I don't know which one to state that Islamophobia is a problem there's no phobia against against Muslims in this country and against Islam it needs to be questioned like every other religion like every other ideology there's no phobia anti-muslim bigotry is the word that should be used and Islamophobia is an agenda from the OIC it needs to be flatly rejected and I think some people in our side are being taken in by it they don't understand the background and then maybe some of them also want the vote from them via the Muslims that we see coming into the country that are actually Pro Islamists so there could be a political component as well even on our side yeah well I see this as the beginning of an ideological litmus test to work anywhere in the public square I mean the race relations foundation is one thing but I wouldn't be surprised if soon any public servant any policeman any judge who dares anyone anywhere in public like a teacher at a public school if anyone honors something that is skeptical of even radical Islam that they would be purged I really see this as the the snowflake that's going to turn into an avalanche have you heard of any other skeptics of radical Islam who have been purged or threatened in the in the federal government or in the provincial government a teacher and I can't mention names here but I have gotten a string of emails about a teacher that was being harassed because she mentioned a few offensive things that when you look at the the string of emails it was not in the least bit offensive we have come to a point and this is a big concern of mine where any criticism at all of radical Islam it's going to be deemed racist this is not kind of Canada that that we have built that we have evolved in as a nation offending someone is a person's right to do so and to be offended I get offended when people start criticizing or in fact not criticizing Christianity I get offended when people start mocking Christianity with the most obscene cartoons but I'm not going to start lashing out and and trying to interfere with that person's human rights to do so if somebody wants to be a jerk let them be a jerk it's their it's their democratic right to be one and if I'm offended well I'm offended but this this agenda that we see driven by the OIC and it's being taken up by our governments it's an extremely dangerous one I was an example because I was a director at the Canadian Race Relations Foundation from the Heritage Department but what happened to me it's gonna happen to everyone if you think about it now the way the world is today I have heard personally that people just domi look I can't say a word about Islam in my workplace I had a radio guy in the States at a very big radio station saying look I have to be careful what I say here because if I say anything to offend Islam I can get socked this is not the kind of world we want to be living in if we proclaim that we are interested in even continuing our evolution in democratic rights and freedoms particularly the way we have flung open our borders to all kinds of immigrants coming in we have lost control of our democracy esra yeah you know just as you were talking and made me think I think there was a principal in Ontario who was interrogated or suspended just for sharing an anti radical Islam comment on her personal Facebook page so I think it is coming along well Christina it's a it's good to talk with you even though the the subject matter that brings us together is unhappy and I'm glad you're speaking out about it and hopefully we can keep in touch with you in the weeks and months ahead let me just ask you in closing what you're doing now I mean I know the race relations foundation was not a full-time job what you have the book out called the challenge of modernizing Islam what else are you working on these days what else are you doing I continue to write for jihad watch I'm the public affairs and media consultant for the International Christian embassy in Jerusalem Canada I continue my private consultations I'm writing another book and so this this year what really upsets me about this and people say well did it impact your income this was not an issue of income I did most of my work pro bono anyway this was more of an issue of it was something of ethics it was something that I held in high esteem to fight for human rights and what I do in my private time at Jihad watch it was also fighting for human rights but this was the issue and it really is a warning to all Canadians right well very interesting thank you for taking the time and I hope you continue to speak out for human rights and for Canadian values thanks for joining us today thank you as an all the best yet all right you too well that is Christine Douglas Williams with a very interesting story about a purge of anyone who reports to or is paid by the Canadian government an ideological purge I think it's a premonition of what's to come from m103 that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra lavance show normally it's behind
