so anytime I anytime I get into a subject like this I'm always reminded by folks in the comment section that I'm not a theologian I'm not a philosopher I'm not a scientist and thus I'm not qualified to discuss these sorts of matters and it's true that I am I am none of those things however I do reject the idea that you have to be a specialist in order to think about and talk about the deeper questions in life I think that's a very sad way to to view life and to go about life you know to view it as something that can only be discussed by highly qualified academics and the rest of us just have to sort of walk about our merry way and never think about these things that that's not how I see it I I think that even normal people like myself and you can and should have these discussions so so here goes I've always thought that two of the best arguments for the existence of God are these the argument from consciousness and the argument from morality now I don't know if they are the best to me they're the best they are to me the most compelling so they're so compelling that even if every other argument for God was disproven which which wouldn't happen but even if it did happen I would still think that a belief in God is the most rational thing based on these two arguments now I'm not gonna get into the whole argument from consciousness thing it's I think it's you know familiar enough to most people who've who've thought about these matters in essence you know if God does not exist then only physical matter and physical processes exist only the physical world exists but if that's the case how could matter by chance without design thought intention assemble itself in such a way as to create consciousness how do you get love from dust even even with you you start with dust even if you add billions and billions of years on top of it how does it ever become love what about what about anger happiness empathy and so on how does a material thing derived from material and nothing more develop abstract ideas no other animal can do this nothing else on earth can have abstract ideas dolphins are very intelligent aquatic animals but even the most intelligent dolphin cannot think about the idea of say freedom much less can a dolphin desire freedom you know much less can the dolphin look at itself and say I'm a dolphin I am me but I wish I were more than me you know a dolphin can't do that but if there is no God then this is kind of the entire story of mankind man desiring to be free from himself to be more than what he is more than material right there it's a very sad terrible story there's no God you have these these biological creatures which are ourselves that have developed somehow this desire to not to be more than us but how could material develop a desire to be more than material and again why hasn't any other material developed that desire why isn't any other material developed that capacity most of all how could a totally physical thing originating from Stardust become aware of itself that's the trickiest thing for atheists I think they might say that well the brain is a computer and so all the things I mentioned love empathy anger sadness so on are just functions of the you know come fancy computer system that we got in our heads but of course there's already a problem with that argument because computers are designed designed we should say by humans who have the capacity to design things like computers because of their consciousness so an atheist who discounts God by saying well the brain is just a computer might as well discount God by saying well the human body is just like a sculpture yeah and find me a sculpture that sculpted itself find me a computer that built itself but even more to the point we are aware of ourselves so it's not just awareness that the atheists have to explain but self-awareness how could a clump of dust however evolved ever come to know itself as a clump of dust and why is it that no other form of matter or assemblage of matter has ever developed this ability and why isn't there any computer even the most advanced computer in the world does not know itself as a computer so if this is a function of a computer system in our heads then why can't other computers demonstrate the same ability outside of science fiction novels so that's one argument I just said I'm not gonna get into and then I did the other argument is the argument from morality and as that argument goes we know that objective morality exists and objective morality cannot exist without a transcendent source there can be no transcendent source for morality without God who is that source thus God exists now I think that's compelling argument personally an atheist can go to general directions with that argument maybe there are other direction this is all based on what I've you know what I've encountered from atheists it seems to me that an atheist will generally go to directions that argument he can argue that objective morality does not exist morality is subjective it's relative so that's moral relativism of course or he can argue that objective morality does exist but it has some other source that isn't God now here's the interesting thing I've noticed it seems that modern atheists and secular people are not as likely to be a vowed relativists that is explicit pronounced moral relativists that seems to be kind of not as fashionable among atheists and secular people as it used to be it's not like it wasn't a 19th century what is more common now what's most common I think is a kind of secular objective morality that often expresses itself as a half-baked relativism it's very confused you know so the average person in in in our culture is very fond of saying things like this is my truth or don't impose your morality on me your morality talking about morality as if it's a thing that you can own and you have your very own version of it or they'll say just do what makes you happy you know those kinds of things and they'll say this especially when they when their own actions are challenged or when something that they personally find acceptable is criticized but often these very same people will condemn things like racism rape slavery pollution and do so by appealing very forcefully to some objective standard condemning the wrongdoer for breaking some kind of moral code that apparently we're all supposed to abide by so in practice I would say the average secular person is really neither a moral absolutist nor a relativist but kind of a mix which by definition makes him a relativist yet few people seem to want to embrace moral relativism the way that Richard Dawkins does Dawkins who famously said that a bit of quote mild pedophilia isn't so bad if it happened a long time ago because the moral standards were different back then which is a consistent morally relativistic position to hold even though it's also horrifying most secular people it seems don't go that far they they try to maintain the appearances at least of an objective morality even if they abandon the objective you know that argument whenever it suits them to abandon it now when an atheist and I keep saying atheist or secular person by the way so understand that I mean avowed atheist as well as the average person in society who isn't necessarily settled on the god question but lives and operates as if there isn't a God so it's kind of a de facto atheist I'm calling them all atheists for the sake of this discussion so anyway when an atheist tries to argue for objective morality it seems the argument hinges almost always on utilitarian grounds that's almost always what it seems to come down to now there is another theory there's kind of a platonic theory of morality as an objective thing that exists in the abstract just kind of floating out there in the ether and I think that's serious basically unintelligible so I'm not going to focus on it and then a third option of course is the Darwinian idea of morality as a product of evolution humans evolved a moral sense because it helps us live together as people in a in a cohesive society but this is still moral relativism that's not really objective morality because in this view morality is no more significant than opposable thumbs it's just a thing that developed biologically to make our lives easier so we have opposable thumbs and opposable thumbs are helpful but nobody would say that we have some kind of obligation to use our thumbs nobody would say that they say you have your thumbs it's great you haven't nobody says you must use your thumbs you have to use them yet morality is all about obligation it's all about what you know you ought to do such-and-such you ought not do such-and-such so morality is all about so in evolved morality might partly explain how we got to this point without completely annihilating ourselves only partially annihilating ourselves but it doesn't explain why in the world I should actually act according to it now that that's what it doesn't explain so evolved morality explains how we got here but now that we're here it doesn't explain why I should actually abide by this thing anymore than explains why I would have some sort of obligation to use my thumbs throughout the day what if I don't want to use them I won't use them so that leaves us with the third option for atheists something like what Sam Harris argues for he says that morality is morality is is basically that which brings about human flourishing a morally right action is an action that brings the greatest good you know to the greatest number of people I was also I was listening to a debate with a moral philosopher teaches philosophy at Yale I believe shelly kagan um and he defined morality very simply as as this he said morally wrong action his action that that hurts someone or fails to help them and morally right action is action that helps someone or refrains from hurting them now I think this definition works pretty well with sam Harris's definition and I think they both fail to provide any basis at all for objective morality and here's why first of all the Kagan's point it's true that it hurts someone when I steal their car but the question is not whether a thing hurts someone the question is why should I care that I hurt someone why shouldn't I hurt someone so you haven't gotten to the ought but you have to get to the ought because that's the whole point second to Harris's point it's true that slavery does not lead to the human flourishing of slaves but why should I care about the slaves and who says that slaves are supposed to flourish and take the United States in the early 19th century most citizens of the country weren't slaves what if it could have been argued that slavery helped the greatest number in that environment flourish wouldn't that make it morally right by this standard on the atheistic view why in the world should the greatest number sacrifice their own comfort for the sake of the minority but so often in practice that's what that's that that is what morality requires that's often when morality you know comes into into focus and comes most into play is when a person in position of power has to make a sacrifice for someone who doesn't have power or when the majority has to sacrifice for the minority that's really when you get to you know that that's when moral claims are the most relevant but it seems like on the atheistic view there's just no scenario where that should ever happen third it seems that in order to establish an objective moral standard for human beings you have to first establish that human beings themselves possessed some kind of moral worth or moral value themselves so the only way to argue that I should steal kill enslave etc is to first argue that the people who would be hurt by such actions have themselves moral worth and unless you're a radical vegan or environmentalist you have to argue that they have more moral worth than say a squirrel or a cockroach if we can agree that it's a greater evil to kill a child than a cockroach you have to explain what actually makes the child more valuable objectively not just what makes him more valuable to me but what makes him objectively more valuable so that even if I didn't recognize his moral worth he would still have it so you have to explain what makes them more valuable what makes life in general valuable and then what creates this kind of high right hierarchy it seems that atheist arguments for morality all of them sort of start by assuming the moral value of human beings without explaining how they arrived at that assumption it seems to me that if human beings are only a random assemblage of matter then they have no claim no objective claim to being any more important than any other kind of matter in the atheistic view we are we are all tiny little clumps of stuff wandering around on a tiny speck called Earth which itself is hurtling through the endless abyss of space and soon in the blink of an eye from the cosmic view we're gonna fade back into the nothingness from whence we came so if that's the case you would have a hard time convincing me that my own life matters but someone else's why just like that they're going to be gone anyway I could zoom out and see the earth you know from that from another solar system none of us would matter at all we're all just little ants already no we're all just little ants on this little ball that's spinning around in space who cares why should I care about them and again from the from the cosmic standpoint soon enough the entire earth itself will be destroyed so why does it matter now you can point out that I do care about other people's lives even though I'm saying all of this you can point out that life is easier for all of us most of the time if we act like we care about other people's lives but you haven't explained why I have some sort of objective duty to care about other people because a duty by definition is something given to us um assigned it to us right that's what a duty is which is why anytime anyone says to you do this or don't do that you can all you always have the instinct to respond says who anytime someone tells you not to do something or to do something you always want to know by what authority are they telling you that so the question to atheists again when it comes to morality is says who fourth point Kagan in that same debate he he grapples with this question he says that well if every commandment needs a commander if every requirement needs a require er er then the commander and the require er would be us society it's wrong to kill rape steal etc because we all say so that's what makes it wrong it is the consensus of a civilized society an obvious and very significant problem here if morality is decided by democratic consensus on what basis can we condemn historical slavery considering that almost everyone in the world for thousands of years thought that slavery was fine in fact how can the minority I go back to this point again how can the minority ever make a moral criticism of the majority if morality is decided by majority consensus how can a person ever claim that something most people do or most people support is wrong how could you go to a fundamentalist Muslim country and say that it's wrong to execute homosexuals when everyone there thinks it's right fifth point every atheistic system of morality that I've ever encountered seems to completely ignore the moral implications of of our private actions and our private thoughts and this isn't a point that's that I hear even even Christians when they're arguing this you know about objective morality and everything I don't often hear them bring this point up I mean everything I've said so far you know you get William Lane Craig or someone like that has already made these points way better than I've made them so it's like you don't even need to listen to anything I've just said just listen to him but now this next part I don't I unless I missed it I don't often hear this point brought up so maybe it's a bad argument that I'm about to make but to me it's it's just something I I think about and and I haven't heard atheist really address it so I'm gonna go with it so you you have the issue of private actions and private thoughts okay if if morality is only what helps people and immorality is only what hurts people well again you haven't explained why I should care about hurting or helping people or why people are worth helping or why they're so valuable that I shouldn't hurt them but even putting all that aside what about the private and interior lives of people what about everything that goes on inside me is all of that outside of the moral framework entirely is a completely morally irrelevant what I think now you may say that it is okay well let's take some extreme examples extreme though not at all though not at all you know fantastical so take for instance a person who indulges in rape fantasies in his head new doesn't just have a thought pop into his head about raping someone but actually indulges the thought and enjoys thinking about it or take a man who indulges in pedophilic fantasies take even a man who watches child pornography and i know there you might argue that watching child pornography is wrong because you are in some way supporting the child porn industry which is true so fine but let's just say hypothetically you got a man who stumbles across a DVD lying on the street filled with child porn stumbles across a laptop that's got a bunch of child porn downloaded on it and so he watches it now you would probably in steven as an atheist i think you would instinctively say that he's wrong for watching but why it's not hurting anybody people were hurt in the production of that pornography but that's already happened he isn't lending any material support to it whatsoever he isn't practically adding to the misery of the victims so why is it wrong and what about the pedophilic fantasies which he engages with in his mind or the man with the rape fantasies or a woman who sits around all day dreaming of all the violent things she'd like to do to the people that she hates again i think instinctively you'd say that these thoughts are wrong and it's wrong to indulge those thoughts but on what basis it's not hurting anyone an atheistic morality seems always I mean that there's a million verses of it but it always basically comes down to don't hurt people 6th point you might try to argue that it isn't wrong to indulge in hateful thoughts or violent thoughts or pedophilic thoughts or whatever if you're an atheist then I guess you'd have to say that even if you don't fully believe it yourself I think instinctively and you instinctively you know that these thoughts are wrong but if you're forced to engage with this argument I assume the probably say well you know it's not really wrong there's another problem why would a person feel guilty for those thoughts where does the guilt come from now if you've ever had a very hateful thought about someone if you've ever had someone that you really hate and and you had a thought where you wish harm to fall upon them right see if you've ever had that thought in your head then you've probably felt guilty for that thought but why it seems that guilt in such a circumstance is a biological anomaly in the atheistic view anyway because you didn't hurt anyone with your thoughts you didn't do anything to society nobody knows about it nobody's affected by it at all it's just you and your thoughts and according to atheist that's it I mean you're completely alone with your thoughts nobody else knows has no effect on anybody so why would guilt ever come into play now you might say that it's a biological response but a biological response to what if morality is all about evolution we're all about what society says we're all about what hurts people or any other atheist definition of the term then how in the world and why in the world did guilt for thoughts ever arise doesn't hurt anyone doesn't affect society so why is the guilt there I think that's it you know sensitizing question for atheists because you have not only do you have to explain to go to the first thing I mentioned you have to explain where do these abstract concepts come up you know like an abstract idea where did that how did we develop that ability but then we have the guilt for an abstract idea and where did that come from here's the point I think atheists will say that IIIi think what it comes down to it most a the average is if they're being honest and if they're just you know speaking from their heart I think that they will instinctively as I said they will distinctively say that the person who indulges in hateful thoughts is doing something wrong just as they will call the man with the child porn immoral they'll say he's doing something amor right just as they'll condemn slavery even when the slavery benefits most people in society just as they'll call homophobia wrong even when most people in a society have agreed that it's right just as they'll probably condemn the Aztecs who engaged in human sacrifice on an unprecedented scale and most people were not sacrificed and the non sacrifice people considered the sacrifices to be something that helped them flourish yet I think a theist would would would probably condemn that just as they'll certainly condemned the Nazis even though only a minority were herded into camps and everyone else could have lived prosperously under Nazi rule if it weren't for Hitler's world domination goals and he hadn't done all that then things probably would have worked out okay for the rest of the Germans yet atheist would condemn that as wrong just as most of them presumably will would condemn the systematic extermination of the mentally ill and criminals even though the existence of those types of people in some ways detracts from the pleasure and well-being of everyone else and also there the lives of those people by the atheistic by the atheistic view could not possibly have as much value as the life of a healthy and law-abiding person yet that's the stance that most atheist people seem to take why why won't these atheists and these secular people just embrace moral relativism and admit that nothing is objectively immoral there are things that for collective convenience we should outlaw but that doesn't mean that they're actually wrong in some objective way why won't most of them take that view the objective nature of morality is clearly apparent to everyone even Richard Dawkins the avowed relativist now keep in mind the the the qualifier that he put on his statement about well pedophilia was okay back when everyone thought it was okay that's more relativism but even then he says mild pedophilia he puts that really weird qualifier on it of ultra mild pedophilia was okay but beyond that that wasn't okay so he felt the need to stipulate mild even as he tears down the moral law he can't bring himself to tear it all the way down so it's clear to me that everyone whether they admit it or not looks at the moral code as a thing that exists as a as a real objective thing as a thing we ought to follow as a thing that we live under as a thing that we should live according to as a thing that would still be there intact even if nobody in the world recognized as a thing that says that slavery is wrong and so slavery will always be wrong even if tomorrow everyone in the world thinks it's okay it's still wrong seems like basically everyone views morality in that light they view it in a word as a transcendent thing but there is nothing transcendent in a purely material world which to me tells us that we are not living in a purely material world so that's why I think objective morality is pretty good evidence for the existence of God got that in exactly 30 minutes I feel pretty good about that as well thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed
