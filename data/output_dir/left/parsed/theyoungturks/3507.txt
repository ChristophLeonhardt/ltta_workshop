IN THE WAKE OF THE DEVASTATING
WILDFIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
THAT HAVE LEFT 42 PEOPLE DEAD
AND 200,000 ACRES COMPLETELY
DESTROYED THERE ARE SOME RIGHT
WING WEBSITES THAT ARE BLAMING
AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT FOR
THE FIRE IS AN COMPLETELY
FALSE AND UNSUBSTANTIATED
HEADLINES DOES IT TAKE A
LOOK AT SOME OF THESE.
BREITBART SAID:
AMERICAN NEWS 24/7 SAID:
BEFORE I GET INTO THE STORY, NO
HUMAN IS ILLEGAL THANK YOU VERY
MUCH TOP OF THESE RUMORS FLARED
AFTER OFFICIALS ARRESTED A
27-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO IS KNOWN TO
DEPUTIES THAT HE HAD STARTED A
FIRE TO KEEP WARM.
ACCORDING TO SONOMA COUNTY
SHERIFF ROB GIORDANO:
BEFORE WE GET INTO SOME OF THE
DETAILS OF THIS, THIS FIRE THAT
HE STARTED THE HE ADMITS TO
STARTING, HE SAYS HE STARTED THE
FIRE TO WARM HIMSELF OUT THAT HE
STARTED HE TRIED TO EXTINGUISH
SOME OF IT AND THAT DEPUTIES WHO
FOUND THEM EXTINGUISH MOST OF IT
BEFORE ANYONE CAME THAT THIS
HAPPENED ON TUESDAY AND
THEN THE SONOMA FIRE STARTED
OVER A WEEK AGO.
SO JUST TIMELINE WISE, THEIR
FACTS ARE LITTLE MUDDY BUT THEY
POSTED THAT ON MONDAY, HE HAD
BEEN ARRESTED.
HERE'S THE REALLY INTERESTING
PART ABOUT THIS STORY IS THAT
THE SONOMA COUNTY SHERIFF
SERGEANT SPENCER CRUM SAID WHEN
HE GOT CALLS FROM BREITBART NEWS
AND IMPOSE ALL THEY ASKED ABOUT
WAS GONZALEZ'S ETHNICITY AND
WHETHER ICE HAD PLACED IT
IN OUR NAME.
THEY DIDN'T ASK ANY FOLLOW UP
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS ARSONIST,
THEY JUST REMINISCE REDMAN
PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER
RAN WITH THE STORY SO
THERE'S THIS ENTIRE CONSPIRACY
THEORY THAT AN UNDOCUMENTED
IMMIGRANT WAS AN ARSONIST AND
THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T HAVE
SANCTUARY CITIES AND SANCTUARY
STATES BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
NICE SCAPEGOAT THOUGH.
IT IS CRAZY HOW QUICKLY IT
ESCALATES.
IT'S IRONIC THAT
IT'S A WILDFIRE STORY, THAT IT
JUST CATCHES ON THAT FAST.
THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPENED
THAT THEY KIND OF HAD A
FILTER OUT FOR.
DOESN'T INVOLVE A BIG STORY,
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT RANDOMLY
KIND OF INVOLVES ANY OTHER
WEDGE ISSUE WE'RE TRYING TO
PUSH?
IF THEY OVERLAP EVER, NOW WE
HAVE OUR SPIN ON IT.
AND THEN YOU SEE THE WAY IT GOES
FROM BREITBART TO AMERICAN 24.
IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND I THINK
THE STORY WAS RECEIVING VERY
LITTLE ATTENTION BY CONSERVATIVE
MEDIA UNTIL THEY COULD ATTACH
THIS NARRATIVE TO IT WHICH I
THINK IS UNFORTUNATE AND I PINE
FOR THE DAY WE CAN RETURN TO
OBJECTIVE REPORTING.
SO I HAVE BEEN READING
BREITBART AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING
ARE YOU OKAY.
YOU NEED ANYTHING?
KNOW BECAUSE I THINK IT IS
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE OTHER SIDE IS READING.
SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AND
THESE ARTICLES IN THE
HEADLINES ARE SO CLICK BEATTY.
THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF
MAKING CLICKETY ARTICLES AND
SO I'VE BEEN CLICKING ON THEM
LIKE NO WAY THIS CAN BE TRUE.
I GET SUCKED INTO A TRUE.
NO WAY THIS CAN BE TRUE THEN YOU
CLICK ON IT AND YOU READ THE
ARTICLE AND OFTEN TIMES THE
ARTICLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE HEADLINE AND THEY'LL SAY
SOMETHING, IT'S LIKE WHEN TMC
SAYS SO-AND-SO TELLS THIS PITCH
TO STEP OFTEN THE PERSON
DID NOT SAY THAT AN INTERVIEW.
THEY JUST COME UP WITH BS
EXPLANATIONS AND THEY ARE
BANKING ON THE FACT THAT THEIR
READERS ARE READING THE
ARTICLE THAT THEY ARE SEEING THE
HEADLINE AND SHARING THAT.
THAT IS WHAT THEIR BANKING ON
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK INTO THESE
ARTICLES, THERE OFTEN TIMES NOT
EVEN ADDRESSING THE HEADLINE.
THOSE SAY THAT THERE IS AN
ARSONIST AND THEY WILL IMPLY
THAT IS RELATED TO THE SONOMA
FIRES BUT THEY DON'T GO INTO AND
GIVE ANY ACTUAL FACTS.
RIGHTS, BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU
LOOK AT THIS ONE IT IS LIKE
ISIL DETAINER ISSUED FOR
SUSPECTED WINE COUNTRY
ARSONIST IN SONOMA JAIL.
THE IDEA WAS THAT SOMEONE CALLED
THAT THERE WAS A FIRE.
THE LOCATION IS WINE COUNTRY.
THIS GUY, DID ICE ISSUE A
DETAINER?
WE DON'T KNOW BUT SOMETHING
HAPPENED THERE.
DIAGRAMMING THE SENATE, WHERE
IS THE NOUN?
THAT IS THE THING THAT
IS A FORMULA.
THEY CREATE A WORD CLOUD AND IT
IS WEIRD.
THERE'S THIS ONE, WHILE BACK
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF NEW
YORK TIMES THING ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENS I BREITBART AND VERY
OFTEN THEY SAID THAT THEY COVER
THEIR BASES IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.
THEY DO SALACIOUS HEADLINES BUT
IF YOU COME AFTER THEM,
TECHNICALLY THE ARTICLE DOESN'T
HAVE ALL THE THINGS OF THAT
HEADLINE IMPLIES.
THEY WILL HIRE PEOPLE OF THE
ETHNICITY THAT THIS ONE
GOES AFTER SO THEY SAY, I HAVE A
MUSLIM, INSTEAD OF A MUSLIM
FRIEND IT'S A MUSLIM EDITOR.
THEY BETTERED IT AND IT IS
FINE.
IT IS FRUSTRATING.
SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT'S
HAPPENING IN ITALY IS ITALY, ON
OCTOBER 31 IS GOING TO START
HAVING, 8000 SCHOOLS OR
SOMETHING, IS GOING TO HAVE A
FAKE NEWS CURRICULUM THAT THEY
TEACH TO THEIR KIDS IN
PARTNERSHIP WITH FACEBOOK AND
OTHER COMPANIES LIKE THAT,
THEY ARE GOING TO, FACEBOOK
OBVIOUSLY, WHETHER THEY ARE
GOING OUT AND EARNESTLY
TRYING TO STOP THIS OR IT'S A PR
STUNT, I DON'T CARE.
I LIKE THAT IT IS HAPPENING AND
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
WE ALL PUT PRESSURE ON PEOPLE TO
ASK BETTER.
SO THEY'RE GOING TO LAUNCH THIS
AND THEY ARE GIVING KIDS A BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT THINGS THEY CAN DO
WHEN THEY SEE A STORY AND I LIKE
THAT THEY ARE DOING IT WITH KIDS
BECAUSE THAT'S GREAT.
I WANT THE CHILDREN ARE FEATURED
I THINK THEY SHOULD DO WITH
GROWN-UPS.
I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS
PEOPLE THINK THAT IF THEY
SEE SOMETHING IN A HEADLINE
FORMAT WITH AN ARTICLE
AFTER IT, IT IS NEWS.
I FEEL LIKE NOW IT'S JUST SO
TRIED TO SAY, BUT IT'S
WORTH IT, THEY'RE HAVING KIDS
CALL EXPERTS, REPORT THE
STORY AND FIX IT.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
I DO THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
I THINK IT'S AMAZING.
REALLY QUICK, I WANT TO CIRCLE
BACK TO THE STORY ABOUT THE
SONOMA WILDFIRES BECAUSE EVEN
THOUGH SOME OF THESE RIGHT WING
OUTLETS TRIED TO USE
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AS A
SCAPEGOAT, PEOPLE IN NORTHERN
CALIFORNIA HAVE ACTUALLY
BEEN VERY WELCOMING TO
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND
THEY SAID IF THEY DO GO TO
SHELTERS DURING THIS, THERE
WILL BE NO ICE OFFICIALS THERE.
THEY SAID THEY WILL BE SAFE AND
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT WHILE THEY ARE
FLEEING THE FIRES I THINK
THAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE.
