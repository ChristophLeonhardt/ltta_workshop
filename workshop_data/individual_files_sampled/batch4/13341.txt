not satisfied with restoring the economy destroying Isis and completely crushing our dishonest left-wing media Donald Trump has now begun to perform actual miracles that's right the president has maneuvered MSNBC into searching the Bible for advice on how to run the country yes using his magic power to plunge the left into the darkness of its own mindless rage Trump somehow induced left this Muslim reporter Ali Velshi to make the argument that the words of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ should override American law when it comes to immigration sticking with the spirit of what would Jesus do we actually did dig through the Bible to find passengers that lent themselves to the current border practice of separating migrant children from their parents and I want to begin with Matthew chapter 19 verse 14 but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven in the wake of this miracle transformation of a leftist Muslim into a right-wing evangelical Christian president Trump says he now has plans to feed starving multitudes using only a single Big Mac and a side of fries while the media tries to prove the multitudes weren't as big as he said they were he'll also calm storms at sea using only the best words and he'll make Democrats pro-life by suddenly announcing his full support for abortion actually that could work Trump told Fox and Friends quote my miracles are the best miracles and it's not just me saying it many many people have said my miracles are great unquote meanwhile MSNBC has announced this new show the Rachel Maddow gospel hour according to a network press release the lesbian Michael Knowles look-alike will quote use this holy hour to rail against homosexuality as being out of keeping with the

telling you it's here and tomorrow I'll told you I love told you I'll told you that I told you ok this is the way the press works all the fake scandals all the fake Asteria all the shouting over things that matter Oh Donald Trump pulled the Martin Luther King bust from the White House oh no he didn't never mind you know the correction that goes on page 112 after the scandal so-called goes on page 1 Donald Trump said that there are nice great people on the knots in the Nazis never said it it never happened but they Russia collusion that's the perfect one the Russia collusion also never happened just like constant drumbeat of hysteria to build and build the tension and the sense that something is wrong that something terrible has happened and then finally finally they get their hands on something that has some kind of emotional valence some kind of emotional truth even if they're not telling the truth about it and they think now now we got them this is a turning point everything that happens after this depends on how Donald Trump acts right now and if you don't believe me you got to go back to 2005 you probably don't remember Hurricane Katrina big deal exactly the same thing with George W Bush they had the same kind of scandals oh he lied about you know they're being WMD in weapons of mass destruction in Iraq well he didn't lie he used the same intelligence that everybody else had and all the Democrats said the same thing we need regime change and when he went into Iraq to have regime change suddenly it was like oh he lied there are no WMDs they the Valerie Plame scandal I won't go into it now is utter nonsense complete nonsense had a special prosecutor investigating that big deal it was utter nonsense but then Hurricane Katrina hit ok and let just so you remember Hurricane Katrina was a disaster in New Orleans and all along that southern coast New Orleans was run by corrupt Democrats for like a hundred years every now and again a Republican would wander through but mostly they turn for governor and a mayor of of New Orleans governor of Louisiana and mayor of Lawrence was a couple years in office than a couple years in prison it was they were absolutely corrupt the Democrats and they would funnel money that any federal money they got they would spend on their own patronage and they didn't put it into the levies where a lot of it was supposed to go the storm hit the levees broke the city flooded it was a disaster people were you know drowning people were out of homeless terrible whose fault is this after a hundred years of democratic governance george w bush's george w bush called the governor of louisiana and said you want help with this and she said no no no it's fine and then george w bush everything that happened there was was the fault of w and the republicans and the administration cracked here is a montage just to show you how they treated george w bush for yeah I guess he blew too hard and he caused the storm and then the levees collapsed which he had nothing to do with and here's their reporting on it if the majority of the hardest-hit victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans were white people they would not have gone for days without food and water forcing many to steal for mere survival their bodies would not have been left to float in putrid water they would have been rescued and relocated a hell of a lot faster than this period we've repeatedly given tax cuts to the wealthiest and left our most vulnerable American citizens to basically fend for themselves and once again Bush finds the photo-op some black folks to hug some white men it bond with for years we have cut our taxes cut our taxes and let the infrastructure throughout the country go and this is just the first of a number of other crumbling things that are you did government neglect turn a natural disaster into a human catastrophe and was it rooted in racism George Bush doesn't care about black people the president's image of compassion was shaky to begin with even though he calls himself a compassionate conservative Bill Clinton felt your pain George Bush flew over it this in arguably in arguably a failure of leadership from the top of the federal government how is this happening in the united states and the other refrain was had this been Nantucket had this been bossed Cleveland Chicago Miami Los Angeles how many chocolates River and the administration cracked they basically did not come out and defend themselves until until the day Bush left office when he finally pushed back when he finally pushed back now Donald Trump is enforcing the laws at the border and they're calling this what do they call it no tolerance or no what is the word they use zero-tolerance policy so you're a tolerance policy is enforcing the law it has nothing to do with zero tolerance it has nothing to do with zero there's nothing to do with tolerance it is just the rule of law they're just enforcing the law and we've got these people coming over they use children to get through some of them are real families and it is tragic I'm not we're not throwing these children under the bus here that's not the point I'm just saying that all we're doing is enforcing the law at the border listen to the way they have picked up on this because they think they've got that there Katrina moment going well the images of concentration camps families being cut apart and their children are being marched away to showers another being marched away to showers are they're being told they are just like the Nazis had said that they were taking people showers and then they never came back look bottom line Donald Trump increasingly looks like Hitler and Nazi Germany's look like dick concentrate it's rewarding I said this yesterday but increasingly Donald Trump is turning this nation and to Nazi Germany and turning these into concentration camps what's happening is very American in that this is how the country was founded this is what happened 76 years ago to japanese-americans in internment camps now look I I know we're not Nazi Germany all right but there is a commonality there and it would be controversial but I felt a warning flavor so it's so concerned about what's going on yeah it our all of us are so concerned we see these heartbreaking images and it's so so awful so this is causing panic on the right and you see the Wall Street Journal you know these people who don't understand what's at stake who don't understand that the PlayBook this is not about the children of the border it's not about the children of the border we can fix that that needs to be fixed and we can fix it it's not about that is about undermining the administration and it's about seizing this moment this is what everything they've done all the lies they've told all the panic they've created all the disaster scenarios that didn't pan out this is what they were waiting for that I told you they were gonna do this and they're doing it and then we watch the right bill o'reilly today and you know with love Bill O'Reilly I'm not attacking him personally but he sent out a tweet well you know the administration is right to enforce the law but they can't stand up against these crying children they'll be destroyed you know in the Wall Street Journal saying keep saying this new Trump policy it's not a new Trump policy to separate children from their parents that's what they want you to think it's a neutral policy to enforce the law they cast they have to separate the children when they put the when they put the parents in prison when they incarcerate them they have to separate the children that's what they're doing so they're just following the law now let's pause here for a minute to talk about why this matters why you know we keep using this phrase of the rule of law and it sounds heartless it sounds mean it sounds like I don't care about these children and I do and I'll get to that in a minute here's why the rule of law matters this is a cell phone this is a smart phone okay I'm holding it up if you're listening this is a smart phone it is a tool it's a tool for doing something with it I can get on the internet I can talk to people I can do research I can do anything I want with this amazing instrument what if Nancy Pelosi came along and said oh my god the children are suffering because Clavin has this phone get rid of the phone we'll still be able to talk to each other we'll still you know it's about hard it's about feeling it's about compassion it's about Jesus get rid of the phone and we'll still be able to talk to each other well of course you know that's nonsense that's a tool that's a tool for communicating without that tool I'm just shouting at people right without that tool I can't get on the internet the law is a tool in this country for equality and freedom the law the rule of law is our tool for equality and freedom you cannot throw it away and have your equality in your freedom any more than you can throw away that phone and still get online but in the palm of your hand okay here's how it works I'll use LeBron James because I know it drives the left mad whenever I use the LeBron James LeBron James is privileged he has stuff I don't have I have exactly the same amount of desire and drive to be a pro basketball player that he does but he got born with the talent he got lucky so he's got millions more dollars than I have he plays sports he's famous he's got all this stuff that I don't have if LeBron James does something really bad beats up somebody say if I beat up somebody we go before a judge the rule of law is supposed to be the same for both of us that's the way that we are equal that is the way we are equal and it's the only way that equality can be preserved once you start to say well you know LeBron James I kind of dig him I've watched his games and Clavin I don't know who he is you know so so let's put Clavin in jail but you know I've used some hard let's have some compassion once the rule of law falls apart we're no longer equal now LeBron James is money his luck his privilege overrides me and my and my fair treatment only by obeying the rule of law do we have equality what about freedom freedom is the same thing right you're free if if the law we elect representatives our representatives make the law these guys represent us that's why they're called or representatives they represent us so they go and they make the law on our behalf right if that law is just thrown aside is disobeyed by because somebody in at MSNBC thinks it's not nice then we have lost our power through our representatives when Barack Obama said I am NOT going to I'm not going to support the Defense of Marriage Act we're simply not going to prosecute people who violate the Defense of Marriage Act he became king he's King now but the laws that my representatives passed don't matter anymore you don't like the defensive Marriage Act override it veto it get right have your representatives go to Congress get rid of it get rid of the law that's how you do it that's how it works if they're not doing it you are not free if they're not enforcing the law so it's hilarious it's hilarious see the people who enforce the law saying what do you did this is incredible you're enforcing these laws how can you do that change the law it's up to you so if you want to see whether these guys are serious I mean because they do not want to help these children they just want this moment they just want the Hurricane Katrina moment moment Ted Cruz came out and he said you're right this is terrible here's a law that we can pass here's Ted Cruz all of us who are saying these images of children being pulled away from from moms and dads and tears we're horrifying this has to stop I am this week introducing legislation to protect kids and parents act that will mandate that kids must stay with their parents and it will also expedite the proceeding if they if the Democrats vote for this I will eat my shirt okay I'm telling you he wants to double the number of federal immigration judges authorize new temporary shelters with accommodations to keep families together mandate that illegal immigrant families must be kept together absent aggravated criminal contact provide for expedited processing a review of asylum cases those are the cases that take so long and why the children have to be taken away according to court ruling and that can only be fixed through the legislature what the Democrats want what the left wants what the press wants aside from undermining this administration is they just say oh well let the people go into the country they'll come back when we need them and then when we want to deport them they'll just report in for deportation they want the open borders because they know that's how their voters get in they are not trying to solve the problem let me stop for just a minute to

when we were doing that Father's Day show with the god-king Jeremy boring and Bannon Knowles the Ben had this moment where he said one of the things he does to keep peace with his wife is when he/she starts to talk to him he stops her and he says is this one of these things where I just listen to your problems or is this one of these conversations where I'm supposed to solve your problems I don't know and my wife said to me I liked what what Ben said there I like the Benson and I said forget it forget it when you tell me your problems I am going to solve your problems I do not have a mode of just listening to your problems what do you want to do with your problems if not solve them you want to frame them you know I love women I do I love talking to them I love listening to them however just because a person happens to be a woman that doesn't mean the crazy thing that you saying isn't crazy a woman says dude I don't want you to solve my problem I just want you to listen to my problem if I have the capacity to solve it I want to solve it that is what Ted Cruz is doing and if the Democrats come back and say oh no you know we don't want to actually solve pass any laws we don't want to build a wall we don't want to defend our borders we just want to sit here and talk about how you're abusing the children you will know that this is what I say it is it is what they are hoping will be a Katrina moment now here is the difference Trump is standing up to them and I want to see how long he can do this despite the you know cries from the right-wing press oh they will never withstand this blow you'll never withstand the emotional thing what about the children the children crying and all this stuff Trump is standing up to him he made a speech but I gotta say I listen you know how I feel about Trump I don't I like a lot of the stuff he's done I don't always admire him as a person I had mired him yesterday I really did check out cut number six this is Trump striking back against the Democrats I'll say it very straight immigration is the fault and all of the problems that we're having because we cannot get them to sign legislation we cannot get them even to the negotiating table and I say it's very strongly the Democrats fault their obstruction or they're really obstructionist and they are obstructing the United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility won't be you look at what's happening in Europe you look at what's happening in other places we can't allow that to happen to the United States not on my watch for the rest of the world you look at everything that's taking place pick up your newspapers this morning and you see we want safety and we want security for our country if the Democrats would sit down instead of obstructing we could have something done very quickly see you can say that's playing politics but it's playing politics back it is fighting back and is what the Bush administration did not do Karl Rove has talked about this Karl Rove Bush's w's advisor he said we should have fought back we didn't realize how much they hated us we didn't realize they weren't going to give us a fair break we should have fought back Trump knows and he gets it and it's driving them mad and I'm telling you the situation with the children can be fixed it won't be fixed because the Democrats do not want it fixed the press does not want to fix this is what they want what is happening right now is what they want and you know Kristin Nielsen the head of the Department of Homeland Security who's in charge of this stuff she came out made the most rational arguments where she said it's cowardly for the people who passed the laws to tell us not to obey the law Congress and the courts created this problem and Congress alone can fix it until then we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States those who criticize the enforcement of our laws have offered only one countermeasure open borders the quick release of all illegal families and the decision not to enforce our laws this policy would be disastrous its prime beneficiaries would be the smuggling organizations themselves and the prime victims would be the children who would be plunged into the smuggling machines and get gang recruitment on the trip north there's a lot of misinformation about what DHS is and is not doing as it relates to families at the border and I want to correct the record here are the facts first this administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border we have a statutory responsibility that we take seriously to protect alien children from human smuggling trafficking and other criminal actions while enforcing our immigration laws it's all about this I mean what she just said it's completely in arguable you know I love that thing with Jon Stewart saying it's in arguable then he repeats it this is like Twitter people think on Twitter if you say something over and over in capital letters that somehow magically becomes true that was like Jon Stewart it's an arguable it's an arguable it's arguable except it's not true it's not true so you can argue about it you know this is a we we quoted a jazz shot hot air he's doing a great job and he's no big trump supporter or anything like this the New York Times a former newspaper the one of the other things that they're panicking about and it's so they're panicking about so much at the Trump administration is Scott Pruett at the EPA right he's dialing back these intrusive illegal unconstitutional regulations that the EPA uses to control like how long you run the water in your bath they come over say you know that bath is a public waterway and we're going to you know regulate that that was the Obama administration's policy and Pruett has been dialing this back and dialing back and holding the EPA accountable it is a completely unaccountable lawless organization and he's holding it back so they've had one pretend scandal after another with Scott Pruett the New York Times runs on the front page for Prewitt aides the boss's personal life was part of the job senior staff members at the Environmental Protection Agency frequently felt pressured by Scott Pruett to help in personal matters to obtain special favors for his family according to interviews with four current and former EPA officials he says at least three EPA staff members were dispatched to help mr. Pruitt's daughter Makenna obtain a summer internship at the White House the current and former staff members said that's page one the next day page a17 and you know there's little correction boxes they have they have a little correction box an article on Saturday about senior staff members at the Environmental Protection Agency who said they frequently felt pressured by Scott Pruett to help in non work matters included an item that erroneously described mr. Pruitt's use of his position for personal matters while a Virginia lawmaker William Howe said he wrote a letter of recommendation to the University of Virginia law school on behalf of mr. Pruitt's daughter he actually wrote it while mr. Perot was the Attorney General of page every it's a seventeen in other words the entire thing didn't happen it was a non-existent thing but if they keep hammering him and then put the apology like down on the a seventeen where nobody ever sees it it creates this this aura of hysteria this aura of wrongdoing and then one day because we all make mistakes Pruitt will make a mistake and will do something that they can nail him on even if it's unfair and they'll say yes but this is just part of the string of hysteria that we you know that we created this part of the string of corruption that's what they're doing to trump now on the border he should stand tall he should fight him back he should you know get his people out there let you know one when Kerstin Nielsen was making that speech when she was talking to the press somebody one of the reporters was playing an audio of children crying I mean that about says it doesn't it if children cry the rule of law goes out the window if the rule of law goes out the window so does your freedom so does your equality Trump is doing the right thing the law should be fixed Ted Cruz is right they should fix it so they can have so they can enforce the law and keep families together where possible that's what they should do but that's not what the Democrats want that's not what the press wants they just want this Katrina moment all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but remember the mailbag is tomorrow so come to the Daily wire.com subscribe it's only a lousy ten bucks a month to come on it's ridiculous you hit the podcast button hit the Andrew Klavan podcast hit the mailbag ask questions about anything you want I will answer and those answers are guaranteed correct I mean where else will you get a deal like that I mean come on guaranteed correct and you know for 90 days but after that they may not be true all right we got got a really good interview with John Miller coming up I come on over to the daily wire calm alright John Miller is a pal and also one of the best writers about important popular fiction and he has written a book called reading around journalism on authors artists and ideas I like to talk about authors artists and ideas the news has been so overwhelming that we never get a chance John is the director of the Herbert H Dow the second program in American journalism at Hillsdale College he runs their journalism department he's also a national correspondent for a National Review he writes for The Wall Street Journal all the time but his piece is when I read them about pop not when I say pop fiction I don't mean just the latest spy novel I mean the great popular writers of English and American history it's it's like eating cake it's like just it's such a it's so great to see a mind like John's engaged with this kind of literature we talked together here it is John it's great to see you thanks for coming on thanks for having me Andrew I gotta tell you I love when you write about writers I love it I love this book I really do I mean I it's one of those things you can dip into and you know you don't have to read from beginning to end right away but I just I just love your stuff on especially on popular culture but also on some of the classics it's just great I mean well thanks so much I appreciate your saying that so we're gonna talk about this but before we talk about this you are you are the head of the journalism department that Hillsdale is that right yeah I've run the journalism program at Hillsdale College in Michigan okay so here's here's what I want to ask you I want to ask you a couple of things one is Hillsdale College has this wonderful reputation of being kind of different from all the other universities it doesn't desert I know I know they're your employer so you can't bite the hand but what is what is different about Hillsdale why is it so admired well first it's a small liberal arts college and you know only 1400 students here but it's college as it should be unlike a lot of schools that are moving away from a traditional classic curriculum we ask that of our students we demand that of them so that so they come and they get they get trained in these great works and they get from great teachers here and what do you teach in journalism what's your philosophy that you bring to that well the first the first point is we believe you learned journalism by doing journalism so we don't teach it that much primarily we get the students to work on the campus newspaper and to work at the campus radio station and to learn how to write learn how to talk and and learn how to perform in these in these different kinds of media that's that's cool so if you've learned journalism by doing journalism they can't go to CNN for instance exactly exactly although CNN ought to hire my people yeah yeah they probably would that would change everything when you know I I hammer the journalists all the time because I really do feel that they are living in a make-believe universe in which they're oppressed in which they're heroic and in fact they're just spewing the Democrat line I mean I I know it's an old song and the Conservatives are always singing it but am I am I totally wrong about this you know I say that that journalism has has has has never been better than it is right now and it's never been worse than it is right now and it's never been better in the sense that we have so much information available at our fingertips I remember when I when I got into journalism 25 years ago if I wanted to and as a young reporter in Washington DC if I wanted to know what President Bush said at last week's press conference you know I couldn't google it I had to you know call the White House press office and begged them to fax me a transcript right and maybe they would do it and maybe it would come through and maybe the fax machine would actually have paper rolled up in it and all that kind of stuff um you know but now it's just it's just at our fingertips and it's at the fingertips of everybody and so our ability to gather information and put it together and assemble it as journalists never has been better and so I think I think well I like to think that it's really helped my work when I write on on politics and candidates and elections and policies and so on and so forth having said all that you're right there's plenty of rotten journalism out there and sometimes I like to say you know we shouldn't we shouldn't let 99% of all journalists give the rest a bad name yeah all right let's talk about reading around which is a series of books a series of pieces on authors artists and ideas and of course one of the things that I love so much about this is it says you have a quote here a blurbs is one of the best literary journalists in the country from The Chronicle of Higher Education you are there's no question about this one of the things I love about it is your you write about you write seriously about genre writers and as a genre writer and as somebody who takes your writing seriously it is wonderful to see that one of the first pieces I ever read by you that I just thought was utterly great was there a piece about HP Lovecraft explaining a little bit for people who don't know who HP Lovecraft is explain a little bit who he was and why you feel he's an important writer so he's one of the great horror writers in American literature if we think you know sometimes Edgar Allen Poe is called the greatest horror writer in American literature and that's that's that's an ok claim that's that's a defensible claim I kind of prefer Lovecraft and think he's better than Poe but he's in that tradition of of you know the sort of macabre iiters who enclose include Edgar Allan Poe or Ambrose Bierce and so on and and and Lovecraft wrote primarily in the 20s and 30s he wrote for these pulp magazines that nobody took seriously he was poorly paid and a lot of what he wrote frankly is trash it's not worth reading but when he is good he is really really good and he has a handful of stories about a dozen some of them short stories some of them almost novella links stories that just make my head spin and when I discovered them as a teenager they just they just made me think longer and deeper and harder about a lot of first things and so he's a genre writer he wrote for these trashy pulp magazines and yet he's dealing with some of the some of the biggest questions out there about you know why are we here does the universe care and so on and so forth and his answers to those questions are often troubling and I find myself in adulthood disagreeing with them and yet he's riveting yeah yeah now he's a terrific writer and you as you say at his best he is really good you and I share a kind of fascination with actual ghost stories which is a kind of very very it's kind of like jazz it's a very limited sphere you write M R you write about Mr James in the book Arthur making two writers I just love what is it about these stories I cannot stay away from them I do not go a year without reading at least one collection of them what what do you think it is that is so amazingly gripping about them that's that's a great question I asked that of myself all the time and I'm answering it in different ways you know Edith Wharton a great American novelist who wrote her share of ghost stories talked about the fun of the shutter you know the idea that that that that that a good ghost story can can create a kind of pleasing sensation and I think we can spear Ian that when we just enjoy it and and and can scare us and it's paradoxically there's we can take a kind of pleasure in that I like stories that are haunting that that leave me thinking leave me leave me checking behind the curtains before I go to bed and that's not for everybody is it my wife can't stand it and this this is this is you know not everybody likes a good horror movie yeah you know even even the good horror movies there are plenty of bad ones I mean not not everybody's into that but I've always I've always found pleasure in it and and one of the things that a good ghost story does is that it attacks some of the materialist assumptions that are out there in our culture all the time right now it's that there's supernatural stories of course they can't be explained through through normal science and if you're like me and you believe as you know the lot the famous line from Hammett there there there's there's more there's more in heaven and earth Horatio than it's dreamt of in your philosophy if you believe that that's true or that maybe it's true a good ghost story can can can really speak to that I had a student once who very sweet young lady who said mr. Miller why do you why do you like ghost story sort of appalled at the notion this is a good church-going kid you know she goes to church every Sunday morning and so forth and I said to her you know if ghosts are real it means that there's life after death and that just stopped her in her tracks not it made her think differently about the whole thing and I don't know if ghosts are real you know Charles Dickens said you know Archer mr James I think said I'm willing to consider the evidence if you present it to me yeah and if you know of course I approached a lot of this stuff with skepticism but if ghosts are real it does mean that there is an afterlife and that has a pleasing possibility too I agree that there's something under the chill that is encouraging I've never had ten people in a room and asked if anyone has seen a ghost and gotten and I've always gotten someone who says yes if you have ten people in a room someone has experienced something ghostly I never have but I have to have you read Susan hill at all no you should try her she wrote the woman in black which has been running in the West End forever and they made it into a bad movie but it's her ghost stories are absolutely terrific you write about Frankenstein but moving on to from ghost stories to the Gothic you write about Frankenstein and said something really surprising which was he felt I mean obviously Mary Shelley is always held up by feminists a great writer it is a great book but you actually peg it as an anti-feminist book in some ways well so so Frankenstein written two centuries ago by Mary Shelley when she was a teenager for crying out loud is in some ways the very first work of science fiction we sometimes think of it as a horror novel and it does have elements of horror that's for sure but but that that's a legacy of the universal monster movies from the 1930s more than anything else but it's it's a serious work of fiction that deals with with ethics and our responsibilities to each other and what it means to be a person and and so on and yes she's often put forward by feminists as a great feminist hero and part of that is the mere accomplishment of a woman in that world writing what she did and it wasn't unheard of I mean this is the time of Jane Austen of course one of the great geniuses of our language so so women women did have plenty of achievements back then but it was harder that's for sure and so she's presented as a kind of an important figure you know you go-girl Mary Shelley you know that that's sort of a thing and and I think we can give them that sure but but it's also a cautionary tale about about broken homes and bad parenting and and and and and and a lot of the things that we might associate with with with contemporary feminism and and Mary Shelley Mary Shelley a complicated figure and Frankenstein is a rich book with lots of different meanings and possible interpretations but one of them is a quite conservative reading that says don't mess with things you don't understand and sometimes sometimes the things that are closest home and dearest to us are in fact the most important you know the other thing that you do in this book reading around journalism on authors artists and ideas you you take certain writers seriously who are not normally taken seriously guys that I really like and I read all the time guys like Dean Koontz and Daniel Silva I'm working my way through Silver's stuff I find it just addictive and isn't he great he's so entertaining I like them I like the fact that the guy goes and kills the enemies of the Jews which is everyone you know it's like if some if you're some Danish guy he kills you for something happened in Denmark you know thousands of years ago but no he really is entertaining you Koontz is just you know a riveting riveting writer what is it you see that these guys are doing you call Dean quince and an artist of ideas which I agree with what is it you see them doing that other people don't get well first and foremost they're entertaining writers I mean I pick up a Daniel Silva book and I'm just gonna get caught up in the story and enjoy turning the pages I want to know what's going to happen same with Dean Koontz they're just great storytellers on the surface but beneath it all they're dealing with quite serious topics Dean Koontz has has considerations of bioethics government you know overweening government I mean his topics change from from from story to story Daniel Silva of course you mentioned his great hero is Gabriel Ilan who is who is with the Israeli Secret Service and he and he marches around the world mostly Europe trying to defend Israel against its enemies and and you you you you read this book and it's a great story it's a great espionage story it's you know it's always cat and mouse games with him and the terrorists and so forth but beneath it all is a sense that that the State of Israel is worth defending that freedom is not for free and and that we've got to fight for these causes and that Israel is Israel as a worthy state and needs friends in the world yeah and he doesn't whitewash is really either but he just says you know this is a good place and it deserves to live so one of the questions I get asked all the time is because if books have kind of gone out of fashion a lot of people don't read anymore they're their vision is very limited if you don't read books I really believe this if you don't read actual books your your vision of the world becomes incredibly pinched and small where would you begin if you wanted to set educate yourself to the great literature how would you how would you start to do that well do you know I think I think it has to start in childhood frankly to to develop to develop that habit of reading when you're young and the enjoyment I'm gonna catch up though you say Here I am but what if it's what if what if yeah what if what what what what's what's uh where do we start now yeah first I would say yeah if you're not in the habit of reading go pick up a Daniel Silva book or a Dean Koontz book and just enjoy the story you can then think you can think hard about the topics and learn a lot and so forth ultimately what are the great books you know very quickly we get to Homer and the Iliad and the Odyssey and the Aeneid and and and by Virgil and and and all of that and Dante and Milton and so forth that's all great stuff you can ease yourself into that too I mean there are great works of American literature too we can pick up right now Huckleberry Finn yeah what a great book that is yeah and I'll tell you we just did at Hillsdale College we just did an online course on Mark Twain and I have a piece in that I do a little roundtable with with the lecturers I learned so much about Mark Twain just taking that course and and I always thought he was a he was a good writer and actually teach some of his journalism here at Hillsdale College um but I just rediscovered Huckleberry Finn in a way that was unexpected and profound because of these great lectures so that that's another way take take an online course with Hillsdale College so we have them on Shakespeare we have them on Jane Austen and as I mentioned this this Mark Twain one was was really good a read Ernest Hemingway yeah another another great writer with a gives us a lot to chew over and and and who's who's who's deceptively simple he's very easy to read very easy to read john miller one of my favorite writers about writers reading around journalism on authors artists and ideas it really is a terrific book john you did a great job thanks drew thanks for reading it it's great seeing you alright sexual follies I would like to respond to an op-ed that recently ran in The Washington Post it was called why can't we hate men was by Suzanna Danuta Walter's the director of the women's gender and sexuality Studies program at Northeastern University she's unemployed she's not doing anything she says it seems logical to hate men I can't lie I've always had a soft spot for the radical feminist smackdown for naming the problem and no uncertain terms I've rankled that the but we don't hate men Prada stations of generations of would-be feminists and found the men are not the problem this system is obfuscation too precious by half this is here in the land of legislatively legitimated toxic masculinity masculinity is it really so illogical to hate men for all the power of me to and time's up in the women's marches only a relatively few men have been called to task and I've yet to see a mass wave of prosecutions or even serious recognition of wrongdoing on the contrary cries of witch hunt and the plotted resurrection of celebrity offenders came quick on the heels of the outcry over endemic sexual harassment and violence so men the world has little place for feminists anger women are supposed to support not condemn offer sucker not dismissal we're supposed to feel more empathy for your fear of being called a harasser than we are for the women harassed so men if you really are with us and would like us to not hate you for the millennia of woe you have produced and benefited from start with this lean out so we can actually just stand up without being beaten down pledge to vote for feminist women only don't run for office don't be in charge of anything step away from the power we got this and please know that your crocodile tears won't be wiped away by us anymore we have every right to hate you you've done us wrong because patriarchy it is a long time past to play hard for Team feminism and win here's my response pounced and that's my response to this op-ed you know as long as you're using the cars and computers and air conditioning and birth control pills invented by men you should be just so happy to have us around as long as you are raising the children who are given to you by man and having fathers who have taken care of you as long as you were being pulled out of burning buildings by men having police show up at to protect you the fact that there are bad guys in the world and they are bad guys in the world and that in some ways bad guys were worse than bad women because they're stronger and have more power it's fine but that you say that this is a whole problem with the sex and you're gonna hate us hate you back baby that's all I gotta say as a nonsense op-ed it should never have run it's just a piece of garbage all right tomorrow we've got the mailbag ask your questions I will answer them in all your problems will be solved I mean it come on it's a great deal hi I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Klavan show the Andrew Clavin show is produced by Robert Sterling executive producer Jeremy boring
