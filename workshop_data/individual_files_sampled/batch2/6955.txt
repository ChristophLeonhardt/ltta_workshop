Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio there's a video that state-run television and media in North Korea keeps playing over and over again following the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong moon in Singapore that video features Donald Trump saluting a North Korean general now I actually didn't know this but our president is not supposed to salute members of the military in it for any other country it's considered disrespectful US presidents generally salute US service members and it makes sense when you think about it now this video that we're about to show you again is being run over and over again in North Korea and you'll understand why take a look so when I first saw that I saw it all over the news this morning and I was like I don't care but it did remind me of something that's important first of all follow up before this meeting was even gonna take place he was asked Donald Trump was asked have you been preparing for this I don't need to prepare it's all about attitude it's about touch that's what I do and he said I've been preparing my whole life yeah I know you're practicing whether you salute others soldiers especially soldiers of a dictatorial government that runs concentration camps and by the way he's also communist but you I'll be preparing my whole life you've been preparing for nothing you schmuck so first of all that propaganda video put out by North Korea was hilarious on a couple of different fronts you got a little snippet of it there the rest of it was like this person like screaming with joy like that's what it sounded like so I remember Obama got criticized when he once gave a salute with a coffee in his hand race he had coffee and there was a marine I believe it was and he wanted to salute the marine so like Fox News I guess what it's like thriller coffee like in the middle of the tarmac and then salute right but Fox News is going nuts over this they're like how could he possibly salute a general of a country led by a dictator no no no I love I love the comparisons to Obama's mistakes because Oh Obama made a couple of mistakes when it came to saluting okay so that coffee mug thing certainly did get a lot of criticism and then there was a situation back in 2009 that Obama got a lot of hate for in 2009 during his first visit to Japan as a President Obama bowed deeply from the waist when greeting the Japanese Emperor eliciting criticism from conservatives who said the gesture projected weakness on the world stage okay let's hold on for a second Trump just gave away all the goodies before getting a concrete nuclear deal from North Korea I would argue that that's weak but you know conservatives are happy with what's going on and by the way I think overall people are happy that this is a diplomatic approach and I get that but Trump was not a good negotiator so far he might be in the future in future meetings we'll see but my favorite my favorite Trump tweet there's always a trump tweet from years ago that connects to a current modern-day story Trump said this the amateur first Barack Obama was caught bowing to the Saudi King but now the President of Mexico I don't even know if that was true of course that wasn't true he didn't there's no tradition in Mexico of bowing look what I can't stand is the hypocrisy of yes both sides but yes Jim Otte Republicans do it way way worse okay so in our case I don't care that he saluted their general I just don't care who cares it has no effect at all right if Obama had done it I'd say look I guess he shouldn't have done it who cares Trump does the same exact thing right now for conservatives like he bowed to the Senate I showed you at the time when we were on the air when Obama did the thing with Japan ass out here then I showed you pictures of George Bush in and the Saudi King making out okay they didn't make out but almost they held hands and they walked around the his rest so-called ranchers afaik he sold it the minute that the presidency was over it was never real the press never called him out on that he was just playing games but anyway he held hands with a Saudi King and then I think they might have kissed on the cheeks or something and I don't know which parts they touch anyway but like what the Coe servers are like way to make out with the Saudis that is strong leadership Obama bow to the Saudis and then Trump his first visit is to Saudi Arabia not to Canada in Mexico which is traditionally the first reason to the president and they're like way to go bow to the Saudis first genius move always thinking Obama coffee in his hand Trump salutes a dictator is General they're like haha Bravo Peace Prize Nobel Peace Prize just come on man Sean Hannity how often do you vomit in your own mouths while doing your show because the way he kissed Trump's ass he would have pilloried Obama if Obama went and met with kim jong hoon and got nothing it was a big promise of later North Korea will be nuclear ice how I'm not gonna tell you yeah are we gonna verify no truck tweeted I can't believe Obama's not verifying Fox News does so I'm so sick of it this is not like the the salute itself is not important the hypocrisy surrounding it is is what drives me crazy right I totally agree with you if there weren't that angle of hypocrisy and also Trump's claims that he didn't need to prepare because he was preparing his own his own whole life it doesn't matter it was a mistake he didn't know what he was doing he usually doesn't know what he's doing I would give him a pass if he were any other president who does actually do his homework but that's last thing that's why they prepare the president for protocols now if you're a plumber and you don't know what to do with a North Korean general fine hey if you just won the presidency and you don't know what to do with a North Korean general or the Queen or the Pope fine but you know what responsible adults do they go hey what's the protocol when I go to meet the Queen am I supposed to curtsy remember that is right do I ride the popemobile or do I not ride the popemobile I want to be respectful of other people without hurting our own country stature that's right okay that's what a smart responsible person does they do just a little bit of homework Trump like I got this I know what I'm doing I don't want to do haha and head he's like Bravo way to not study you jackass two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit
