Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING 24 HOURS EVEN BY THE ACTION-PACKED STANDARDS OF 2018, THERE HAS BEEN LOTS OF DRAMA AND WASHINGTON. AS YOU WELL KNOW, RUDY GIULIANI REVEALED ON THE SHALE ON HANNITY SHOW THAT PAYMENTS COHAN MADE TO A STAR STORMY DANIELS, WHICH SEEMED LIKE A MAJOR STORY AT THE TIME. BUT WITHIN HOURS IT WASN'T EVEN THE BIGGEST STORY OF THE DAY. NBC NEWS REPORTED THAT FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD WIRETAPPED COHEN'S PHONE, IT AND RECORDED A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT THEN THAT STORY CHANGED. THE NEW ACCOUNT REPORTS HE SIMPLY RECORDED THE NUMBERS THAT HE DIALED AND NOT THE CONTENT OF THE CALLS MADE OF. AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW, AT 8:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME. ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT NBC SCREWED UP, BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL WE CAN BE CERTAIN OF. IF NBC'S FIRST STORY WAS WRONG, WHY DO WE ASSUME THE SECOND WAS RIGHT?

THE FBI CAN'T DESTROY YOUR LIFE BECAUSE YOU TALK LIKE A CHARACTER FROM "THE SOPRANOS," THOSE AREN'T FELONIES. BASIC NORMS WERE VIOLATED, ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE IS AN ANCIENT AND VITAL CONCEPT, AND SO IS PRIVACY. LET'S HOPE THEY HAD A VERY GOOD REASON FOR DOING IT. THEY'VE BETTER HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE THAT MICHAEL COHEN WAS DOING SOMETHING AWFUL IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THIS. IT TURNS OUT THAT ALL OF THIS WAS ABOUT A FINANCIAL SEDIMENT WITH SOME STAR WHICH IS BY THE WAY A STORY THAT NOT A SINGLE AMERICAN IS HONESTLY SHOCKED OR THREATENED BY NO MATTER WHAT ANDERSON COOPER TELLS YOU. IF THAT IS ALL IT'S ABOUT THEN WHAT WE ARE WATCHING IS A GROTESQUE VIOLATION OF CIVIL
